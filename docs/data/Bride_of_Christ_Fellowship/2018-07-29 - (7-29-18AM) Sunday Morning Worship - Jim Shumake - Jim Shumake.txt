feet here we'll have our brother Jim come preach God's Word let's sing all and all his congregation and I know what that's like to invite another minister in your pulpit Amanda I just thank God for the opportunity to say something for him this morning him and I'm not a great teacher as your pastor is and I've always admired brother Jesse since the first I met him and see how God has used him and I just think the great deal of him and his ministry here and what he's doing pray to God which is continuing to bless the little congregation here also amen if you have your Bibles this morning I want to get right into the word I I've been noted known at home to sometimes be lengthy so I've tried to cut the thought down this morning the best I can but I've been preaching a little fought at home on knowing we are the variety as we see the Day approaching and I want to continue maybe some of those thoughts have I preached six message along this looking at the characteristics of the Spirit of God and to try and put that all into one it's kind of hard so or two too so drive it mess this morning to just head in that direction and you just pray for me if you would if you have your Bibles turn with me to Hebrews the tenth chapter I heard your pastor quote this as I was sitting in the back as he was praying this one portion of the this scripture in hebrews hebrews chapter 10 and we'll start at the 22nd verse see what the Lord would speak to the body of Christ this morning amen ask it you pray for the congregation home where the Brian ministered for me this morning in the morning service brother Joe Martin will be ministering this evening in the evening service and I pray that God would use both the brothers and the church there would be blessed from having heard the Word of God good to see brother John and to Lisa and every one of you here this morning and haven't seen you for some time and pray that God would say something I don't feel worthy to stand before the purchase the blood of Jesus Christ I never do but by God's grace a man will say something that would be a blessing a man that's all we could ask this morning it means you love the Lord this morning Hebrews chapter 10 verse 22 reads like this let us draw near with a true heart of full assurance having faith of faith hard sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with the pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised oh isn't it good to know that he's faithful this morning here we find a promise in the book he's faithful he men to fulfill the promise amen he said let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not for Sanat forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the Day approaching let us pray Heavenly Father Father we come to you this morning grateful hearts to be in your house Lord God we are so thankful for what you've done for us lord we're God and your death on the cross your shed blood that we could stand here Lord God amen justified in your sight like we never sinned in the first place a for us Lord and as we gather here this morning we pray father that you would guard my lips let's say something is contrary to the word but let all things be said to honor the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and to bring this portion of the body of Christ just a little closer to you father Lord God as we see the Day approaching Lord God we want to have a boldness or a confidence as the Word of God says here in Hebrews or God to stand fast in this day that we live Lord God not let the devil amen blow us about father God but to know who we are and who we are in Christ Jesus Lord God as we look into your word this morning we pray that you would help us each one to look Lord God with an open heart with an open mind father God and to take the Word of God and allow it to have a practical out working in our lives father we commit ourselves unto you and to these people or God we ask that you would just speak words it would encourage someone we can leave this place say that's been good to be in the house of the Lord today we commit ourselves in his body of Christ 1 we could leave this place say that's been good to be in the house of the Lord today we commit ourselves in this body of Christ in your hands in jesus name amen you can be seated this morning I've been preaching his thought at home as you see the Day approaching knowing we are the bride him in knowing we're the bride you know and I and I'm what I begin to look and think of this is I'd I'd counseled some people and talked to subpoenaed said stuff like oh I hope I make it and I want to know that I'm part of the bride I want to be sure that I am in the amend and they would have questions and things and I would say well you know they said well I remember the day that I got saved and I remember I spoke in tongues and I remember I shouted and I remember I took a lap around church I said glory that's all good I like all that stuff I mean I get a little bit crazy sometimes I mean one day brother Jack got excited in the church and he'd come around in front of the church and he tapped me on a shore said brother Jim come with me I said hey I'm with you we took a jericho march around the church they met when the brother would preach and I thought well glory I felt good hey man but you know that doesn't make me the bride of Jesus Christ amen I remember a bed of the Bible the prophet of God saying it he said he saw people that spoke in tongues a man and drank blood out of the human skull he said so it's not speaking tongues it's not not cutting your hair if you're a woman it's not it's not quit smoking or drinking always things that make you a bride of Jesus Christ is not paying your tithe or coming to church and doing all these things a man that you can point to and say I can know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm a bride of Jesus Christ how many want to know beyond a shadow of a doubt hey man but we had have a comma shirts in our heart that we are the bride of Jesus Christ I've been good to see sister Wendy a man I think R and daughter somebody said that you sent greetings and I thank God for that good to see each one of you here this morning a man but it's begin to think on this I began to talk to these people and find people wanting to know for certain that I am in the bride how many wants the nose hurt you're in the bride hey man but it's not all these things I mean it's not how long you grow your hair how long you wear your dress and all I believe in all that I believe if you're a Christian you will address the proper attire I believe you will act a certain way you will you will shun certain things they made in your life and accept and embrace others but it's not that that that that proves that you're the Bride of Christ but as I begin to look at these things I began to think about knowing you're the bride when you become the bride the Bible tells us you become bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit is that right so if we are the same with him we become one with him and one with that spirit whatever that spirit and compelled him to do as the bride it will compel us to do the very same thing is that right so we can look at the Word of God and find out what the spirit compelled Jesus Christ to do and say if it's not complete to do the same thing or if I'm not doing the same thing I can tell you all day long I bribed you can look at me and say something doesn't ring true here something's not quite right here how many believes that so when I looked at this I said we can draw near with a heart of full assurance of faith amen having a heart sprinkled from evil concert our bodies washed with pure water the word amen we can hold fast the profession of our faith we don't have to waver we can know in this hour that we are the Bride of Christ amen amen all these things might change amen all this other stuff might change you may never speak in tongues you may you may do something you may make mistakes but does that make you not the bride it may be because you do those things no what makes you the bride is when you manifest the same works that he did because his spirit is in you they make how many believes that this morning we look over and st. John the fourteenth chapter amen in the 14th chapter say John I just want to read this it's kind of lengthy but just bear with me if you would jesus saith unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have not seen him from this point forward you're gonna know if you see me you've seen the father why would they say that because he would do in the very same things the word goes on and tells us that the father compelled him to do he didn't do anything that what the father didn't compel him to do Jesus said he seemed if I been so long time Philip said show us the father and it will suffice with us he says and jesus saith unto Him have I been so long with you and have not known me Philip he he that has seen me has seen the father how say us now then show us the father believe that believe thou not that I am in the father and the father that in me the word that I speak unto you there not of myself amen he said but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works nor does everything he does was because that spirit of the father was in her does everything he does was because that spirit of the father was in him nobody believes that that's more than amen he says believe that I'm in the father and the father me or believe me for the very works sake he said the very works that he was doing were the works of the Father amen whatever the far did whenever the spirit was of the father the son did the same works because of the spirit that was in him there was characteristics of the spirit that were being manifestly declared through the body of Jesus Christ is that right he says verily man I said he who that believeth on me the worst thing that I do shall he do also if you really are the bride this morning you will do the same works that Jesus Christ hid is that right is that okay hey man hey we all want to say amen to that but church it's time to examine ourselves as we see the Day approaching because we want to know if we are really the bride or not amen amen you know you look around here every Church claims to be the bride every Church claims that they have the messies every Church claims that they are the one the church there is only one bride it goes home with me from Akron tonight she sits right there amen it doesn't matter what you claim a man it's what the word says this place what the Spirit says this morning he says boy said the works that I do show you do also and greater works than he showed you because I'm going to the Father he's going away but Church even he wasn't gone very long he was only gone tell me how many knows he was only gone 10 days Amy he said he wasn't going going to to the Father him in but he says you're going to do the very works that I do you're going to do the very same things that I do you are going to do he says he said but I'm going to father whatsoever you asking my name I'll do it the father may be glorified in the son and if you ask anything in my name I'll do it if you love me keep my Commandments but then he goes over speaks this I don't have an iPad I'm old school I put everything on paper is that alright and I had had somebody lapped me said why don't you put the preacher tongue why don't you put all that stuff on an iPad you will have to carry all them papers around I pushed the wrong button and lose it all I pushed the wrong I'm old school him and I can hardly use a smartphone but maybe I put it on paper is that all right a man if I lose this is my fault but I don't have to worry about pushing a button and have they disappear in the cloud someplace they made a man we go on over then any honda verse 16 it says i pray the father and he'll give you another cub that he may abide with you forever we're talking about the characteristics of the spirit being manifested in the Bride of Christ of this hour he said even the Spirit of Truth amen he said that comfort of the Senate is the Spirit of Truth amen he sent in his own spirit into the bride amen that who said though whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knoweth him him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you hey man where is the spirit pound is found in the bride of Jesus Christ she becomes bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of Spirit amen that spirit will be in you he said I will not leave you comfortless I thank God for that promise this morning his promise he is faithful the Bible say he is faithful to be to bring his probation and your comfort list I will come to you the world won't see me no more but you're gonna see me because I look for list I will come to you the world won't see me no more but you're gonna see me because I live you'll live also and that that here's the thing that I like him here I don't have to bank on anything else he says that that day you're going to know it's not gonna hope so it's not gonna wonder so it there's a time when you are going to know a man he said you will know that I am in the father and you and me and and you you're going to know that he's there hate me Curt amen how many know he's there this morning hey they're not because you grow your hair or wear a certain kind of clothes it's because that spirit is in there manifesting the same life that was in him how many believes that this morning a man so I want to look at that it says and I want to look at this and find out if that spirit is in him is going to cause me do the same works a man as we see the Day approaching I want to see those works being manifested in my life how to see their bank good to see you hey man how many want to see those spirits he says we see that Day approaching I want to since he wanted us to preach the message every one of us to preach the message hey man he said not so much with our mouths but our very spirit our very live was to be lived voices living al Canary Spirit of Christ amen how many want to be that this morning hey man he says and Jesus amen we look over here if we are to manifest the Spirit of Christ and we see the last day approaching the Bible tells us here in Hebrews that we are to assemble ourselves together and exhort one another and much more as we see that Day approaching not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together why did Paul say that well the writer of Hebrews say that because he said that Spirit of Christ would be in us in the last day and the last day he's coming back for a bride who is bone of his bone flesh is flesh spirit of his spirit so as we see the Day approaching he wants to see that very life of Christ being lived out the Spirit Christ being lived out through a body hey man how many believes at this point it's okay if I take my coat off my Jesse tried to pull it mines underneath here and that's what I was looking for I mean nobody can find mine's hid under there they always throw it in a chair but that's alright a man you can put it wherever you want a man some people want you to keep your coat on him and I don't like fighting with a coat I'm in a man so I'm fighting the devil this morning is that Alright so we want to see the Spirit of God manifested in our lives amen let's go back and see the life of Christ and the works that the Spirit did in his life when he was down the earth a bit is that Alright if it's going to be the same thing let's go back so we look back in the Bible let's take a look at Luke Luke 40 or Luke the fourth chapter the fourteenth verse the Luke 14 hey man this is the spirit God manifesting itself in Christ Jesus amazed that sad that all right Luke excuse me Luke 14 Luke 4 verse 14 we read these words and Jesus returned in power of the Spirit we find Jesus the man Christ Jesus but he says in Christ Jesus he's returning in the power of the Spirit the Spirit is in him is that Alright amen and the spirit in him compelled him to do exactly what the Prophet said we are to do in this age the Word of God said where do we are to find ourselves gathered together hey man when the church doors open on Sunday where are we we're finding ourselves someplace gathered together a man with the Word of God hey man is that Alright they said he returned the spirit of power in the Galilee and there went out of Fame of him through all the region round about and a bit and it says and he began to tour in the Galilee and there went our fame of him through all the region round about and a bit and it says and he began to teach in their synagogues he began to teach her said well brother Jim I'm not a teacher hey man he said brother Jim I'm not a preacher brother Branham says every one of us if that spirit of Christ is in our very lies like Paul said my speech in my preaching was not with enticing words of some man's wisdom but it was in demonstration of the Spirit and the power of God demonstrated out of our lives hey man it will demonstrate the very spirit the very life of cried you will be lived voices preaching out the gospel that spirits in you this morning hey man how many believes that and not only will you be doing that but it'll be hard to keep you from doing that amen it will be if the true full measure of the Spirit is in you it will compel you to do that amen how many believes that hey man Jesus returned the spirit of power and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to dad's would have been where he'd been brought up at was as it was his custom notice that it was his custom this is just the way he did it curse they could say where'd brother Jim this morning he may ask some work brother Jim oh he's over a church over there on the other side of the tracks that's where he always is on Sunday I bet he not in a ball game or a picnic or some family doing is it to her because that's where the Word of God would compel him to be if that spirit see anything they say all right now but I'm not a legalist person amen I'm not going to lead illegals I know there's times when you can't and there's certain extenuating search but if that spirits gave you a man it will compel you when it is absolutely nothing else could keep you from it hey man you will be there you will be there church it's time to start checking up on your live sporting him in our lives living epistles our lives the Lindt written word of God being manifested amen as we see the Day approaching we can have a confidence we can have a boldness to know when we see the Spirit of God God manifesting itself the same way it did in Christ he said it mastered him he came as was his custom he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and he stood up to read the Word of God hey man you know what he made you say well brother Jim I'm not I'm not gonna stand up at church and read to her God you might not but the Word of God tells that I think I have this quote wrote down here some place of the scripture wrote down the Bible says you are written Epistle known and read of all man your very life reads the gospel your very life reads the scripture where life is lived out voices of the Word of God how many say amen to that if it's not it's time to start can up how many believes that this morning he says it was his custom he woke and he began to preach the Word of God amen is that Alright maybe you know what you did to your neighbor when they saw you get dressed for church and they were out sitting there drinking a cup of coffee on the on the on the porch this morning they saw I lived a voice preach the Word of God say he's going to the synagogue again this brother gonna be at the synagogue he's there every Sunday it's living that word of God before him they there that they bled boys preaching the word because the spirit in you compels you it did him brother branham said you have tape this is Christ that we're talking about the mystery of God being revealed in a bride him and the Spirit of God being manifested in a bride in this morning he said when he was brother Brad says you've got tapes on this Pitino how we have got to come here together he didn't say it'd be a good idea he didn't say it'd be nice if you would he says you have got to you know what hey may God or Christ couldn't have stopped himself from going into that to that because the Spirit of God was in him compelling him to go and preach the gospel how many knows that to be the truth he said the Spirit of God was in him hey man it annoyed him to preach the gospel hey man is that right brother Brad says you've got to come here together to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said don't stay home if God is in your heart he said you can't hardly wait for those doors to open out yonder and get in here to fellowship with the bud and if you don't feel that way it's time you got the prayed he said you know why if you don't feel that way because you're not manifest in that spirit because that's the spirit within him he had to be there he couldn't wait to get there he just could yeah I'll bet he got up that morning said it's Sunday I can't wait to get to church I'll bet he got up and said oh boy I just can't wait to go to the picnic no he didn't say that and say I can't wait to go to the family reunion no he said I'm going to the synagogue that's my custom that's why I am every Sunday I will be there my family don't even bother to ask me oh we're gonna have it here because I know you won't be there hey hallelujah Church it's still the word it's still the word he says cuz we're in that he said if you don't feel that way is time you got to pray and why because the spirits not manifest in the life that was in Christ that's the spirit that's what could he did the spirit compelled him to do that he said if you don't feel that same way you better get to praying you better say Lord God I need a fresh anointing of your spirit this morning here he says cuz we are in the asked how many believes were in the last days we are in the last days is it all right to read a quote of the Prophet amen he says where the Bible exhorted us to much more he's quoting Hebrews much more as we see the Day approaching a man to love one another with Christian love double love one another to love one another he said by this will all men know you are my disciples when you have that love one for another amen when Jesus returned the Spirit of the Lord was upon him church came in and it compelled him to go and preach the gospel hey man why did he preach the gospel because he saw me lost he saw you lost he saw people lost a man that day and he loved them and loved him and he didn't want to see him remain lost so I began to preach the gospel he saw people that were sick and he didn't wanted to remain sick so I began to preach the gospel amen amen he began to show them I bet that the spirit in him would do the works of healing a man do the works of salvation do the works of delivering a man that may knows that this morning but if the spirits in us it will cause us remount the very same thing to the world how may a man I want to tell everybody God the healer and go around sick oh I'd better tell everybody God's a way maker go around I just don't know what I'm gonna do something's wrong there Church the spirits not right that all right amen the Spirit of the Lord is upon me he said if the spirit Lord is upon you him it will do the same thing he did he said the Spirit of Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor a man church a bed there every one of us is poor him in one way or another this morning hey I might be poor in this I might be poor that but when I come and hear the gospel I'm enriched every time I'm enriched every time hey there he says he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to Kathy they been recovering of sight to the blind and the Senate liberty them that are bruised amen he was compelled by the Spirit of God was in him to preach the gospel to preach deliver amen to preach that God is a way maker hey man if that spirits in us it would cause us to do the same thing this morning how many believes that he says and he said and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now that might not sound like a whole lot but when you think about that what is the acceptable year of the Lord then I know what the acceptable year do what the prophet said the acceptable year of the Lord was he said the acceptable year of the Lord was the year of Jubilee you know happening to your Jubilee a made it to your Jubilee amen there was a trumpet sounded amen and then no matter how long you'd been sick no matter how long you've been in prison no matter how long you've been bound the Lord how long you've been in captivity no longer how long

didn't know which way to go but now he has sent me on that way and he is that way he showed me that way and your life ought to be screaming that if the spirits in you set free me he said that spirits enough to preach that same deliverance to the church this boy how they I like that thank God for a prophet I wouldn't know what the acceptable year of the Lord was for profit it wouldn't have meant so much to know that he was just preaching acceptable here in the Lord but church oh very nice to preach my God is a healer my god is a deliverer amen I told some of the brothers at the church they meant if you didn't know me well before I become a Christian you wouldn't me if you knowing the things that I said the things that I and how I conducted myself but it didn't matter how long I've been like that when the Spirit of God came I was set free I was delivered by sin were put in to see him cons forgetfulness hallelujah Amen I thank God for that this morning Amen His grace was sufficient to me it still is no matter how long a man our lives ought to be screaming that to the world this morning a man except that we although the Bible teaches the year of Jubilee when the slaves and the prisoners brother Branham says had been taken prisoner he made a mighty give a son or a daughter pay the debt he said they were in bondage no matter how long they've been in bondage I like that he says no matter how long they they're supposed to stay in bondage a bit you know what they say oh this is just something that your heredity you'll never be delivered it you have to stay the rest of your life that's a bunch of hogwash aiming at the bunch of baloney why because the Spirit of God and me preachers they deliver it they made a year who believe me he said hey man no matter how long you've been in bondage a man he's supposed to stay there when the year come of Jubilee and the trumpet sounded every man can go free if it wanted to go free Church you can preach that your very life to you we preach it you can go free if you want you and I'll show you the one that can set you free hey man hallelujah your life ought to show it hit me Amen how many believe say Amen Paul put it like

brother Jim that was back in Bible times how many ever reached even coffee so devotional that he puts out on if you know Stephen cuff John does okay amen I read this in one of his things and I thought boy this would go good right here so you throw all right if I share that this more amen brother Stephen coffee does a little devotional called our daily strength a man blueberry coffee son Stephen amen he said you read oh that was back in Bible times he says but he says as if the Bible times had ended I thought well what in Bible times in how many knows the Bible we are living out Bible time we are living out our portion of this great symphony he says he says he said tonight today right now is still Bible times I said absolutely hey man today we live out the scriptures through our very lives a man we live out the same scripture we live out the very same spirit through our lives him in this morning he said today the Bible is coming alive through prophecy and the bride of Jesus Christ they made today the the Word of God is coming to pass he said and now he'd live in that same gospel that same portion and it was without measure in him but now we are living out our measure because Christ and living in us a man how many believes that this morning so there it is he said the Apostle Paul encourages as we see the last days approaching together excuse me to encourage see they approached it at Christ's return to get his bride to not forsake - coming together exhorting ourselves one another we must prepare ourselves to draw close to Lord as we see that day approaching him how many wants to do that I want to be prepared I want to know when he shows up I want to have a fool I want to draw a full heart full of assurance in faith knowing hey man how can you know her brother Jim because you spoke a tongue no because his Spirit is manifesting the same life out of my body Amen hallelujah he said you don't have to believe me because I do this he said believe me for the very works because they're the words that the father has done he made he said believe me for the very works because they're the words that the father has done he made that father's work should be out of us brother Brian put it like this and God had a provided way all these things happen back in the Old Testament were an example what we can have if we take the same Road he said how do I want to take the same Road the reason he can do that because he took the road to the spirit dwelling him not my will but your will be done him here he said all will take the same road we can do the same thing that they did the Bible said they escaped the edge of the sword they done all these different things had their dead raised up you know he said but he's all that was Bible times he said this is Bible time Bible times don't end they started when the Spirit of God Pentecost and they're still going on how many how many believes that I believe that with all my heart this is the end time for the day approaching I don't want to have to go and check up or make sure I want to know before the day gets here I want to have a calm assurance I want to have a heart full of assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled amen with the washing water of the word hey man I want to have the blood apply to me I wanted to Spirit within a minute hallelujah then I don't have to bank on what I've done or how I grow my hair or what I do or where I go to church I have to bank on what my confidence on that spirit living out the life of Christ in me program said if it's not there is time you got to praying because we're at the last days we're at the last days this is the end he said four seven four out of seven I have said nothing seen nothing but men steaming their own word above mine hey man I've seen churches say well we got it because we say this or we got it because we've their esteeming their word making the Word of God of none effect that's why the prophets said this he said I've seen it so so at the end of the age he said I'm gonna spew them out of my mouth what age was that that was this Laodicean Church age that we're living out the very last clicks of right now how many believes that he sounds spear mouth then it's all over I'm going to speak though I'm still going to speak yes I am I am here in the midst of the church he never left hey men I am here in the midst of the church he never left hey man he came back on the day of Pentecost he said I'm here in the midst of the church how many believes that this morning the Amen of God he meant the faithful 'true will reveal himself he'll be by my prophet oh yes oh yes it is so because you read revelations 10 7 he says in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets a man maybe they're not going to be any mystery they're not gonna be I wonder if it's over I wonder if this is God the mystery of God's gonna be declared in this last day hey man it's going to be declared through a prophet hey man who a prophet who calls a bride back to the original Pentecostal father's how many knows that this morning he made temperance he says that's where he says there it is he says he is sending of indicated properties sitting a prophet after almost 2,000 years hey man how many knows we're living out this very portion of the Bible this is that Bible days didn't end is that this is Bible day he said this is it he's sitting up indicating property sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he's sending some 104 from organization educational world religion as John the Baptist in Elijah of old were he will hear only from God how many knows that we had a prophet in our day that did that he will have thus saith the Lord hey man how many knows he had to say that well their prophet could say thus saith the Lord only a prophet and saved us said you get these people thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord amen I wonder about that that's another sermon I won't get into that I mean this is Jesse Pope but he can preach it how he wants let's say at the Lord and he said it he said he will say have thus said Lord and he will speak for God who how can he speak for God because God spirits in him the works that he did will he do he will do the very same thing he will preach the very same word hey man how many believe that this morning he says he will be my mouth he left us there he will speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in Malachi 4 6 will turn the hearts of the children how many children we got here this morning he will turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers amen he will bring the elect of the last day they will hear of indicator propagating the exact truth as it was with the ones excuse me as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and listen to this church listen to this we're talking about the manifesting Spirit of Christ he says and those elect with him in that day we'll be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body be his voice and perform his works she said do you see it do you see it he said those elect will be the ones that knew the very works what did John say over here in the scripture we read he said the works that I do show you new and greater works than these you do because I'm going the Father time said in my spirit and my spirit in you you'll do the very same works that I did hate me that's why the Prophet could say that this morning there is a body in this day who would going to manifest the works of Christ because God's Spirit will be in her hallelujah girl manifesting some other kind of works I wonder what kind of spirit you're up this morning amen he says in the last days there's again another people in the land who are under there who under their messenger will be the final voice voice it won't be some church's voice it won't be some denominational voice it'll be the voice it won't be some church's voice it won't be some denominational voice it'll be the voice of the Spirit of God speaking out hey man declaring him and the same thing that Christ did preaching the same doing the same work same n that he did and what did he do he manifestly declared him an the day of deliverance he manifested declare the day of Jubilee true him and he manifested declared that he had no matter how long Satan thinks he's got a hold of you and a habit or a problem that you're having amen there is a time when that spirit enters it that he no longer has control and I've been set free I heard the Jubilee I heard the trumpet sounding in my day I be set free he says oh yes he says in your very life ought to be screaming that out just as his was the Bible says when he was when he was when he came into the temple what did he do he said the Lord the Lord had anointed him amen to preach the Spirit of God upon him because they anointed me to preach the gospel church amen if the spirits on earth will do the very same thing we will preach the gospel the ability of I can't preach a man you can just preach it by your very life for your very life he said like I said to begin with he said what brother Bram said what what we need in Jeffersonville is thousands of lived voices he says cry it out the sweet thundered out the Word of God him here he said that's what we need not only in Jefferson billet but in Albion Pennsylvania and Akron Ohio he needs to have a voice that lived the Word of God lived out through that voice Amy Amy he said yes it is he said yes sir the church was no longer the mouthpiece of God the church so to speak denominational Church and he's confounded her through the Prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her the voice of God listen the voice of God will you can't have a voice of somebody they've had like brother BAM said he said if I'll come up here and told you I had the spirit of Michelangelo in me he said you'd expect me to be some great sculptor or painter or what he was if I told you I had the spirit of Beethoven in me you begged me to get up here and play on the piano like brother Laursen brother yeah look I mean hey some great concerto or something hey man that bait could that spirit would be in me hey mean is that right if I get up here and I say now I'm gonna play the fifth symphony and I go something sounds like chopsticks you say I don't think you got the spirit of bait oh but you know what we're claiming to have the spirit of god and we're playing some big rinky-dink Tintin in a church we ought to be streaming out at the gospel hymn and I delivered the power of God in here how do I believe that this morning a man we can't de base it on what we think we know what we're doing I mean we have to base it upon the same spirit that was in him manifested itself through us manifestly declared that Spirit of God in hallelujah he says yes it is for it says he can find he said yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation 22:17 the boys would be in the bride the spirit and the bride say come they're saying the same thing their spirit photographs after one place I don't have the quote he said total quote me all of it but he said the spirit in the bride will say come the same spirit that seen the bride will say the same thing you had because it's not our spirit saying it it's his spirit he said he said his spirit in the bride say come and once more once more the world were here direct from God him here wait a second direct from God yeah it says the world will once more in this land to see Nate here directly from God yeah it says the world will once when this land to see Nate here directly from God hey man who's he going to hear he says oh they will hear directly from God but the voice will be in the bride but he'll hear not from the bride he'll hear directly from God just like they did at Pentecost just like they did at Pentecost now we're going to be the voice of God it's like it was at Pentecost I'll better go back and see what it was like if the prophecy is going to hear from voice of God in a bride amen and we all claim well I got the voice of God let's see if it's the real voice of God he said it's like it was at Pentecost let's go back and look and see how it was at Pentecost maybe you know we go back to Pentecost we find a bunch of believers that were trying to follow Jesus try we find him run in him and we find him scared we find him a bed not knowing what to do him it's the first little bump in the road him and even though the scripture said it would be that way that island themselves fearful they find themselves without power they found himself unable to convince anybody that Jesus was the Christ and is that right but you know what he told him he says you go and wait you go and wait you until in Jerusalem until you be endued with power even he knew what it took he knew what it took to manifest the word he said you can't preach the gospel you can't do the Great Commission until you're in dude with the Spirit of God that spirits got to be in you huddled someplace they met one with another and guess what they were doing they were exhorting one another Oh remember when they did this I can just see him in that upper room I wasn't there but I wished I had to be he's I just see him at unapprove Oh remember when he said this he did that old the God he said that same power would be enough maybe and they prayed a little harder Church I think we need to start praying a little bit harder but notice the spirit a man was propelling them he told him you going gather together assemble ourselves together and he says and wait for the power of the Spirit to come and he says that they were sitting at a per room and the Spirit of God fell on them they come down at a table roof they weren't afraid anymore when they come down out of the upper room brother Jesse Peter and John comes strutting down out of there and it wasn't some proud thing it wasn't some pride thing look at me who I am but they came in with a confidence hey they came with a confidence they drew with heart full of the surveys having our hearts sprinkled from an evil their bodies washed with pure water they came down out of there with the whole spirit all over them hey man is that right and when they came down with the holy spirit all over him guess what they begin to do the spirit that was in Christ caused him to preach deliverance amen they come down there and they walk by the gate beautiful and they're sad some guys that had been there for his whole life I mean he had been their whole life he'd been lame from his mother whoom this cartel this is that right he'd been lame from his mother's womb and when Peter and John walked down out of there now no longer their spirit of fear but a spirit of boldness a spirit of confidence when they came down out of that Peru they walked up and said silver and gold I don't have a man they were true believers silver and gold I don't have any but such as I have I got something that's worth more than all the gold I got something's worth more than all the silver I got something worth saving a fortune hey man seek I seek it as a precious jewel Oh God I thank God for what I got this morning at Peter a man and John knew what they had they had a heart full of assurance a man that they could preach the same gospel that he preached because they had to say spirited him that he had it and what did he do he walked down there he said I don't have silver and gold but what I got I can give to you I can give to you he said I could take you by the head and you can rise up and look even though you've been there don't care how long you've been there don't care how long maybe what was it him now preaching the year of Jubilee the apprec come down he said preaching the acceptable year of the Lord he come now preaching the year of Jubilee the priest he come down he said preaching the acceptable year of the Lord when the Spirit of God is in a we will preach the same gospel that Jesus preached and we will manifestly declare what we're preaching is real this morning church that Spirit of God is in a is real he said we have not because we ask not he come down he says he said I don't have any silver a gold that you're asking for but I got some it's a greater treasure I got something that's able to set you free he preached the year of deliverance he preached the year of Jubilee he took him by the hand and immediately his ankle bones received straight and he went jumping and leaping and praising God hallelujah church amen when was the last time we saw a brother or sister come into church him and it was afflicted it and brother Jesse come down her brother Jim come down it says I don't have a doctor's degree I don't have a PhD to help you with this I cried psychiatric problem you have but what I have I have they can deliver you from that Hey we got that same power within us to do the same thing he said we will do the very same thing we will point them to a God who is more than able how many believes that this morning a man he says that you know what they said about these people in acts 4 chapter he said after this man was glorifying God and the people all began to look at them Amy this is one of the other portion of the thing I tried and right here but man we'd be here all day if I did but I preached amen one of the other characteristic Spirit of Christ was he humbled himself he made himself of no reputation a man is that right and when they began to point at them and say and begin to hold on to them say oh look at what these men did look what a lot of people do in this message you know they have some great ministry people began to look at them and they start to puff their chest out say yeah I got a thousand people coming to my church boy I'm really something if that's not the spirit Christ Church something wrong right away that's another whole message I don't want to get into that hey man but he made you know what it said he humbled himself and the Spirit was in him that caused him to Humble himself to take upon himself a form of a servant a man he meant he'd made himself of no reputation even though he had the power of God any man Peter and John done the same thing they says don't look at us like we've done this don't look at us like this is something that weird some great thing that we can do he says very John Jesus Christ the one whom you crucified that's the one that's why this man stands here whole that's why he's here this morning they made Church of that spirit enough will have the power to do that well we won't make a big deal over at a man we will just preach that word and say important to the one who's more than able hey man he preached the gospel hey man the one that did this was the same one that can deliver your soul from Hell him he says when they saw the boldness of Peter John they perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men hey man just like old brother Jim they marveled and took knowledge that they had been with Christ a man they didn't look what they were they saw Christ in them they saw the spirit in and they say there's something about him he act just like that fisherman that they used for here just like that carpenter rather that they used to follow around church that's what I wanted to say about me this morning that's what they ought to be saying about you this moon maybe you could Church that's what I wanted to say about me this morning that's what they ought to be saying about you this moon maybe you could tell me all day long you're the Bride of Christ but if that same spirit to do the same words that have the same desire that he had is not in a it's time we got the praying how many believes that this morning we're in the last days I mean who we are to gather together to exhort to build one another up you know what when you come here and testify what God did for you the last week you know what that does that just builds up the body that just exhorts them maybe when God set you free when God delivers you when God comes here you're on your tear rescue comes on the scene and in any area of your life Amen we ought to be screaming it out to everybody that will hear him to preach the gospel look what God did for me I mean and he ain't no respecter person would do the same thing for you how many believes that this morning later on we find the same disciple they're being scattered after team was persecuted Amen I preached another message on that him in the same series he said and some of them were men of Cypress of cyrene which when they've come to expect Antioch spoke to the Grecian speaking preaching the Lord Jesus Christ there they are they're scattered the same spirit where they do their preaching no matter where they go there's preach in Jesus Christ wherever they go and the best spirits in you when you're at work you'll reach in Jesus Christ to all your buddies hey man amen wherever you are if you're at the school you'll be preaching it to all your schoolmates wherever you are if you're at Walmart you'll be preaching Jesus Christ they've been just by your very life say man he says then you can't wait and every opportunity you have you'll find yourself because that custom if the spirits then use that that was his custom that right and when they came him they were preaching the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bible says in acts 11 21 and the hand of the Lord was with them and a great number believed and turned to the Lord because of their preaching of the gospel because of their living out because of the spirit that was in a being lived out through them they preach the gospel that says in many many how many want many in your neighborhood how many more many in your family hey man even he said you got to preach the gospel and if the Spirit didn't you you will preach the gospel and if you're not it's time to get a fresh filler this morning he says who then really he said they tell you that they came to ears of the church was in Jerusalem they sent Barnabas that he should go as far as an he heard what was going they met her the revival going let's get down there get it see the Spirit of God compelled him I want to be where the revivals hot and heavy and when he came and seen the grace of God and was glad what did he do he said he exhorted a man why did he do that because the Spirit of God was in him how do you know brother Jim because the next verse say that was he exhorted them all with all the purpose of heart they would cleave to the Lord I mean you know what that word clean means it means to become one with man it means remember when that guy one of David's mighty man he said he slew all those Egyptians were those uh enemy I can't remember what it was Philistines or whatever was the Bible said that the sword clave to his hand they become one with his head when he swung that sword it was one of him church that's what we are we're to cleave to him become one with him bone of his bone flesh misplace quickly become one with the Lord had the same spirit him in before he was a good man he was preaching the gospel he was preaching that they should become one with him and his spirit would be been in dwelling them doing enable them to do the very same thing he says because he was a good man full of the Holy Ghost he had the spirit if the spirit was in him that made Christ do that it made him do the very same thing this morning how many believes it he said he was full the whole ego and a faith and much people were added to the Lord he preached the gospel by his very demonstration by his very manifestly declaring the Spirit of God that was in him he said they need from Tarsus to seek soul and they had found they brought him back in and it came to pass that the whole year what did they do they assembled themselves together how many want to do that this morning a man they assembled themselves together themselves together with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called Christians why they were christ-like they were first called Christians at Antioch because they were christ-like they were saying all this for brother Jim amen I got two or three paise I don't know if I'll get to my cut two or three things out I want to say but and I try to be brief this morning but church what are you trying to say but I'm trying to say that it as we see the Day approaching we can know that we are the bride of Jesus Christ because we're born of his bone flesh respect that spirit of the Spirit have been happy to know brother Jim because the Spirit that was it him compelled him to do certain things and if that same spirit sat us it'll compel us to do the very same thing in fact as you can't do anything else you know that you can't do anything else amen it's a spirit hey man you watch a little duck you watch a little duck a man in a few months a man that duck might be swimming out there on your pond behind your house we got him to come and swim around on our palm behind how but here brother Bram said all of a sudden one fall days the wind will blow across that pond and a cold chill from across that pond he said and you'll see one little duck out there he'd put he's a little honker up in the air and he'll let out a scream and he'll head south just as fast as he can't tell all the other come with me why did he do that he can't help but do that why because there's a spirit in him amen he's a duck if he doesn't he'll die and there's a spirit in us if we're sons and daughters of God will do what he did or we'll die hey man we have to have the same spirit in us in it how many believe that this morning oh he said that's it man is always glorifying God rejoice what God has done there's this quote I was talking about there saying he what he will do and they're ignoring what he should be doing right now what he is doing right now what he should be doing right now the same thing he did that were glorifying God for what he did all other what he did look how he walked down there and he preached delivers to the captive leave preached the year of deliverance him and he preached the year of Jubilee acceptable your Lord I mean he is a spirit upon him he gathered with her brothers and sisters he came tersh it was this custom oh look what he did in that wonderful hymn in and one day he'll gather us all together and we'll all sit around and we'll exhort him a one another will he's God it will be ever learning he made more and more about the scriptures him and we're over there how many knows that to be the truth sure we will he said if we're gonna do that over there and we're gonna do that over there he said we'll be doing the very same thing right here because it's the same spirit that'll cause us to do the same thing here it is he said am and always talk and he said but they're missing what he's doing right now they believe what he's done and shout about they talk about what you're going to a glorify God but what is he doing right now they ignored he said it's just the nature of man to do that that's just the way you see he said but we don't have that nature anymore if the Spirit dwells in you that nature's naughty he said but we don't have that nature anymore if the Spirit dwells in you that nature is not in you you're out preaching that word Amen you know what Jesus said he said I am the vine you are the great he said if it's out of the same vine we're living off the same it'll bring forth grapes I know what you're thinking brother Brian said I know what you're thinking he said I saw an orange tree growing lemons one time he said no that's man-made idea grafted in that's something that man grafted in it's just living off the church it's just living off a bad that body said but it's not true fruit of the vine it's not manifesting the true fruit of the Spirit it's not manifesting that true fruit of the Spirit just some man-made grafted anything living off the Church of this day hey man he said but if that Brian by never brings forward another branch it will produce an orange if it's an orange tree halli if they said if this church ever brings forth another church at this Brad and brings forth another church he said it will be another church like it was at Pentecost and they'll write another book of Acts behind it hallelujah how they believed that this boy fruit did it bear these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they will cast out Devils a man how many believed that you had that power within you this morning the same power that he had in Luke 14 when he said the Spirit of God is upon me caused me to preach the gospel to preach deliver a man to preach deliverance to the captives area to preach the gospel hey man to the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives to recover his sight to fine and deliberate heed of them that are bruised and held down and depressed under me he said that same spirits in you when it brings forth another Church in this our church how can I know that I am bride bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit he said I'll produce the very same thing he did he said and we'll hear once again from God like it did at Pentecost it'll be a Pentecostal Church like it was in his day like the first church he made he said oh the second church rises up the mystical body of Christ have the same signs he says let alone the world see me no more you'll see me I'll be with you even in you even to the end of the world Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Church of the Living God that's who it is that's the kind of witness he'll have in this day the same witness that he was in his day how many believes that this movie a man I believe with all my heart a man if it's going to be the same kind of witness to do the same things he did a man will gather like he did he says when the spirit was upon him it caused him to go to the synagogue if that spirit Sepang off church it'll cause us to go to the synagogues when the doors are open why said it was just his custom it was just his manner Church why was it isn't matter because the spirit in him was compelling him to do that church if that spirits in us this morning amen and we don't have that compelling desire to be in the house of God when the doors are open I think we need a refilling of that spirit I think we do refreshing of that spirit this morning you know that we don't it's you know so many people too refreshing of that spirit this morning you know that we don't it's you know so many people were banking on the fact that they believed God sent a prophet I thank God that I believe God sent a prophet so many people are banking on the fact that I pay my ties or I don't cut my hair I don't do all these things or I spoke in tongues or I shout and do this even I believe in all my stuff which church how I know that I'm bone of his bone flesh flesh the spirit of the Spirit is the Spirit will live out through me the same exact life that he had when he was on earth and if we examine ourselves this morning and it's not living out then something is wrong something wrong for nearly 2,000 years God had been making this masterpiece because he struck and he cut a master cut a piece off of him and cut a rib to make him a wife and now the perfect masterpiece that he struck at Calvary they got a piece off of him in in it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament but he said he struck a piece off of him at Calvary him in Alleluia you know where that piece was he said Oh in the New Testament there's another piece to be fulfilled a man he fulfilled the old test but there's another piece there's Bible times to be lived out right now he says he says see he was the old force in the new he says Christ come the masterpiece to fulfill the old now his bride now his bride how can you know that your bride his bride will fulfill everything that the two new testament says will be for this day another masterpiece in the making how many believes that this one would you stand your feet with me I pray that I wasn't too long I don't even know when I come out amen try it I tried not to be here this morning I mean another man's pulpit amen but brother Bram says you've got tapes upon how we are to babe if the spirit of God's in us we've got tapes how we are to behave ourselves how many know is that this maybe he says if the Spirit of God is in you you have got to come together because when the Spirit of God was hidden in return he said he found himself gathered together when the Spirit of God was in his samples they found himself gather together exhorting one another preaching building one enough he says even more so as you see the Day approaching yes so if you were only able to come Sunday morning amen make it Sunday night and make it Wednesday night that make it Bible study then make it whatever you can name it then if you can't come together and Jesse not having served call your neighbor get together with him I mean well the spirits in you that's what you'll desire him in there'll be a hunger and thirst for righteousness a man he said we've got to come together you can't you've got to come together to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you can't stay home if God is in your heart hey man there it is if God is in your heart you can't stay home he couldn't stay home a man if he's in our heart we can't stay home hallelujah we've got to be
