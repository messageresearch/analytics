========================================

sorry children you know what you know we normally do the studies but it kind of felt like since i didn't get to preach a whole sermon i couldn't i want to preach a full sermon second timothy 3 13 second timothy 3 13. i like to look at the mighty men again i thought i was done with this but then i heard a sermon i was listening to invisible union and then i was listening to another and i just felt kind of inspired to preach maybe one or two more sermons on mighty men second timothy 3 13 2nd timothy 3 13. second timothy 3 13. so verse 13 gives us the prophecy of the age we're living in it's the most deceptive age right as we saw even this morning are we live nothing okay so as we saw this morning people can sit in any church and think everything is saying or everything is okay they're all secure and uh people can be so deceived that they won't even move when the holy spirit's moving on them may god help us to be sensitive to the holy spirit when the holy spirit moves on us we'll respond that's a great that's a great attribute to have that's a sensitivity to the holy spirit that we praise god verse 13 says by evil men and seducers shall act worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou the things which thou hast learned and has been assured of think about what you've learned in the gospel of jesus christ what have you learned and what are you certain of see because this is the only way to overcome deception okay this is what paul gives us here knowing of whom thou hast learned them you learn them from paul you learn them from the prophet today it's from brother branham praise god pointing us to the word verse 15 and that from a child timothy thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise or i would say mighty that's kind of where i'm getting this thought for the mighty men and women their scriptures make the wise unto deliverance or salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness let's read verse 17 together ready one two three that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works that god has blessings to remove his word you may be seated praise god what kind of feels good to be free here tonight my god's going to have to worry about anything if i say something wrong i'll just i won't put it on the live stream you know wednesday night i did speak on some personal things related to beliefs i had about the message so i did not make that sermon public i didn't want to offend people um but if you'd like to hear it let me know i still have a link to it by god's grace i was kind of making uh doctrinal stands you know where i stand on certain things regarding the greater works and the double portion and uh son of god son of man david so i just kind of felt like i think i'll keep that in-house you know by god's grace but if anyone would like to listen to that again or you didn't get a chance to listen to it you could certainly do that um i guess i was really enthused i was under a was under a strong burden to you know show where i stood with the word of god on some of these so i hope that was a blessing more winning wednesday i'll preach a second part to that son of man son of god instead of david so i did a lot of preachers i'm going to preach i'm sorry i did a lot of teachings i'm going to preach kind of tonight my god the lord will help me here by god's grace so uh the purpose of this series part five we want to increase our faith in god uh so he can work mightily in our lives and as we saw the might will come from the inspired word of god praise god uh in an age of deception the strength that we need to pull from will be the written word of god the holy spirit directing us to the word praise god to speak the word of god because the word of god is mighty it's the mighty weapon uh tim or paul told the corinthians it's mighty for the pulling down of strongholds praise god hallelujah no oh yeah i have slides i'm sorry did i tell you that my phone um so david's mighty men if you look at it were mighty because they never lost a battle they might have lost a few men in there but as far as i understand they never lost the battle as far as somebody correct me if i'm wrong here my second memory okay i couldn't find one in the scripture where they lost a battle they were mighty men and so neither do we have to lose a battle and what i mean by a battle is a calculated attack of the enemy it may last five minutes may last five hours may last five days but we don't have to lose that battle praise god we can win that battle praise god it may be a spirit of fear or spirit of depression that was trying to come upon us right or a spirit of sickness that might come upon us well we might even get sick a little bit but that don't mean we lost the battle praise god we didn't give up and forsake the lord and quit well i'm giving up and i'm done with it you know we never lost the battle praise god amen we might struggle we might battle praise god we might fight we might feel weak but we never lost praise god as long as we keep faith in god's word we never lost we never have to say i was defeated we can still say with god's help all things are possible praise we don't have to so i'm looking like that you know we always hear that quote my man says when the bride knows who she is she'll be an invincible army i believe we are that praise god not going to be we are praise god if i was invincible brother william i would have already left praise god that's right the devil already would have defeated me and made me quit and give up and i would have ran back to the pentecostal church or the chapel or something like that but by god's grace the word of god makes us invincible praise god mighty to the pulling down of strongholds i mean invincible like he's never going to get me off the course he might he definitely gets punches on me every day definitely he'll punch me but that doesn't mean i lost the battle i'm still standing here i still got the sharpest most active living weapon god's ever given to man that's his word hallelujah praise god i might get some uh pains i might get some scars no doubt i get some scars you get you get struggles you feel frustrated you feel weak hopeless helpless but you never quit you never lose the full battle praise god so i think that quote is for now i think the bride's always been invincible praise god amen no matter what they did in the first church age second third with constantine they were still invincible praise god when they saw them asunder they were still invincible because they never stopped fighting for truth amen hallelujah amen that's what i'm talking about the battle for truth the battle to keep your testimony the battle to never give in to the enemy praise god the battle to never say uh i give up or i quit or it's not true or maybe i was wrong well i'm always wrong the bible's always right though not the devil tell me i'm wrong i do get wrong sometimes but the word is never wrong jesus says never lie his word is true his word is the present truth this revelation is right it's thus saith the lord and we've got the mighty weapons of god's word and we're not going anywhere praise god god's word cannot be moved this finger cannot be shaken but it cannot be i'm standing as a soldier in the kingdom of god [Applause] i look at the mighty men i see you and i brothers that can't be moved sisters children that can't be moved they're not moving they're still battling we're still driving out to amrit we're still driving driving out the philistines hallelujah and the hittites and each one we're still driving them out i haven't quit i haven't given up the land i haven't given up uh my possessions praise god i'm still fighting for my possessions i'll keep fighting for yours too you just keep fighting for mine in other words keep praying for me praise god i'll keep praying for you hallelujah we won't give up praise god we might lose a few uh we might get a few hits on us or something like that not feel like we lost but we've never lost the battle yet praise god because i'm still standing you're still standing praise god amen amen hallelujah i just thought this was an interesting prayer brother man prayed for men to be mighty in the land he's actually talking about the uh businessmen's association christmas christian businessmen association before the seals we consecrate our lives to you as i've asked my brothers and sisters here to do so i do myself oh god i lay myself on the rock like the eagles he's not about the eagle how his beat gets filmed over and he's got to beat that beak now i've never seen it but i heard a preacher said he used to have a pet bird and the pet bird his beak would grow like that and he had to beat his beak to get all the all the crust off there so i thought that's a good that's a real life example praise god he had a pet bird growing up and the bird would have to smack its beak until it broke off all the extra whatever it was you know cartilage or whatever it was whatever that whatever the nail this thing is there uh the mineral in your body but what i'm saying see like a lather on the rock he said oh god with every prayer i know how beat everything ungodly away from me lord amen that's our prayer praise god i pray that you'll mold me until i can reflect your life granted lord help me be true and honest let me want to beat your hearts help me to always be strong and brave amen help me father to carry the word to the unmissionary lands of the world granite father bless this businessman's association may it live and may it prosper and go on and see the coming of the lord and get many souls ready praise god see that's what we want to see we want bride of christ fellowship praise god to prosper in the things of god amen to go on to see the coming of the lord and get souls ready for the rapture of jesus christ amen when he becomes a rapturous bride he said give us men of honor men of integrity men that's great men now later he said don't call anybody great but we know what he's saying in god's eyes right who spend their own living take off their time now here's how he says how this is why they're honorable men they spend their own money they take off their time to bring the gospel support ministers to come in and spread the word god we love them and we pray that they'll be mighty in the land and used in your hand praise god mighty men among us praise god we want mighty men mighty women children everyone can be mighty in the lord praise god as we've seen with our children get some of these testimonies recently by god's grace it's been wonderful to see that so just a good i just thought this was a good quote that helped you to see how can we be mighty let's be honest praise god let's be strong and brave amen let's tell the truth praise god let's if we got to use let's use our own money praise god let's use our own money to support the gospel let's use our own time let's invest more time in the things of god amen amen see and god use us help us to be mighty in this area and in in your hand by god's grace amen amen now remember god's mighty power was constantly working in paul mightily right he had the baptism holy ghost now so god mightily empowered paul to labor and strive to preach so he was striving with him that's what i thought this morning was really striving i was really striving just to pull one person up i mean striving i was you don't sweat that fast but i was sweating within 20 minutes i was trying to preach so hard without shouting here you know without spinning or something like that trying to be real good pulpit managers that's right you don't have many but uh he said i am empowered and i'm striving to preach the people to teach them and to warn every man praise god hallelujah this was how god worked mightily in him you see church when you're laboring for somebody you're praying for somebody that's god mightily working in you praise god you want to witness for someone or you want to see someone heal and you just devote a little extra time a little extra prayer or get on your knees or you lift their name up to god whenever you're working with others and trying to get christ more in their lives be a blessing in them that's the mighty work of god working in you praise god this is not limited to preachers praise god because eternal life is living for others amen amen this was paul's commission to live for others to preach and what's not everybody's commission to preach but when you give of yourself praise god when you give up your time when you give up your money and you witness or you do something to try to encourage someone to come to christ it's god working in you mightily to be a blessing to someone else praise god hallelujah it cannot be limited just there for preaching in other words if you don't preach you can still have the mighty power of god work through you praise god and so preachers i know even myself sometimes i disappoint myself why is the power of god working more through me right i just want to be humble i can be more humble i can be more dedicated praise god i can be more consecrated but when i see the spirit of god striving in me to warn teach or preach i know it's like paul it's god's spirit working mightily in me praise god because i'm not a lover of self i'm not a lovers of pleasures i'm the lover of god amen you are you praise god we're lovers of god we're lovers of the word we love god we keep his commands amen amen now here's our text this was paul's command how to overcome in the age of the greatest deception it's not the darkest age the dark horse rider proved that that was the darkest age during the dark ages about a thousand years my brother called satan's uh eden if i'm not mistaken or saints millennium there it is it's like the pope's millennium basically that's right uh satan's millennium 900 some years of dark ages that was the darkest time jezebel religion that's right complete jezebel religion but in our day it's the most deceptive day according to paul and jesus where he said uh because iniquity abound the love of god shall wax cold so we less love today it's very hard to find real christian love today that's why church we gotta just pour it out on each other praise god we gotta we gotta just be willing to show love even if we don't get love back we gotta show love praise god you gotta just smile and take it praise god just show it up amen be different praise god now i'm gonna just break this down a little bit here so we see the warning of deception people are gonna think they're saved when they're not right people are going to think they're sanctified when they're not how about this one for this morning people are going to be filled with the holy ghost when they're not they think they are but they're not see but paul says continue this is the age of deception so continue in what you've learned see how learning is a good thing as aggression if you don't learn in church something's wrong with you or something's wrong with me hopefully there's nothing wrong with any of us hopefully we're writing god's perfect will but if we're not learning something's wrong somewhere either the preacher or yourself we should be learning praise god i'm constantly learning like the mighty man that's been all new to me praise god something i've never really preached before praise god that's why i go to those new books like colossians and ephesians philippians i love i always learn something new in there wow never do this look at that constantly learning and it's such an encouragement to me praise god to see how this is christians of old this is how they overcame and if they overcame i could overcome greatness amen if they only had 10 years left if they gave everything they got to the earthquake cave then i'll give everything i got to the tribulation cup praise god because i don't know the day of the hour i just had a friend i see him uh a couple of times a month i pick up our uh farm milk at his house he's 69 wasn't he okay and i talked to him on thursday his name is tenny uh i talked to him on thursday and we just got talking about i was talking about god oh he's not like he had he had four kids at one time what do they call that quadruplets he had four kids at one time his wife had four people can you imagine four diapers i know this guy's the same of course now he went to the catholic church so but i just try to encourage him you know anyways you know he's an older gentleman for some reason on thursday i just took a little time at his house and i picked up the milk and put in my car and i'm like i said tenny you know how's your family he said i'm still taking care of my little granddaughter from six a.m to noon so my wife can do things and then he owned a trailer park i said you know someone just came over me i said brother i said god loves a faithful husband i said god loves a faithful dad like you men to your children and your grandchildren said god loves that i said half the country has fallen away and we still got half that you know conservative you know i said we're a part of that good half you know and i just we went on talking and i just when i was leaving i said 10 god bless you i said you've lived an awesome life jenny you have lived an awesome life you've you've provided for your wife your kids and now you're serving your grandchildren you have lived an awesome life saturday morning i got a text that he passed away when i left his house the thought came to me you were talking to him like he was gonna die i just brushed it off i just brushed it off like oh no no it's like i was building him up like i said i said god saw all your sacrifices you made for your children god saw all that you did for your wife and your children and he's a catholic guy but i said god saw all that and god loves a faithful father because god is a father then two days later i get the news that he passed away church we're not guaranteed anything in this life you can see somebody a few days they could be gone right i'm not sure how i got on that but the point i want to make is that you know the bible said continuing the things i was learned i'm not sure how i got them i guess i just want to say let's be ready to go at any time by god's grace ready but that was a great reminder to me lord help me to be ready i want you to always give help me to be faithful praise god because i never know the man says when god's going to pull our card and say time to come home son got to come home so we'll go to his funeral hopefully this week and i'll be able to you know talk to his widow and maybe oh yeah i gave his son both my books before i give him his son both my books three sons and a daughter but just uh let's be always ready serving the lord praise god redeeming the time for the days are evil so it's a time of deception but continue in what you've learned i love this what you've been assured of that's right there's a lot of things you know when we do the kids bible studies that i say i don't know right there's a lot of questions we have how's this going to work out can that person be saved i don't know but paul tells us what you've learned and what you know is certain you keep doing that praise god amen in other words if you know the lord jesus christ baptism is right you keep spreading that praise god amen amen you know god is one person keep sharing that hallelujah praise god the things you're assured of god cares for me god loves me praise god he's forgiven me pray god the cross was the greatest day and then the resurrection was the greatest weekend those are the greatest events my hope is in nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness amen amen what you've learned the servancy right the godhead predestination the seven seals what we've learned what we are assured of praise god continuing there to this age of deception praise god don't let him down continue in them see what he says no and you learn them from the prophet of god but everyone tells that thus says the lord well that's enough for me praise god you've got the word of god in the back he's got thus saith the lord and the word to back it up praise god see because timothy knew from a child he was trained by his mother and his grandmother see how you mothers are so important where's all the mothers and grandmas so important had his mother not enough numbers that was a green his god god had his timothy's mother and grandmother train him up so he would be the most like-minded as the prophet of god that's right i like mom and that i see two i would see a mom and grandma team back there amen mom and grandma teamed up and just planted these scriptures in his heart and his soul in his mind just planting them this is the word this is the holy scripture if you if you believe this you'll be saying timothy praise god just scripture after scripture lay it in there week after week memory verse after memory verse sermon after sermon just lay it in there you've been assured of it you've learned it you know it's right praise god it's the holy scriptures it will make you wise in other words this scripture will save you this scripture you can rest your soul on it this scripture will lead you whole praise god amen amen the holy scriptures are able to make you wise unto salvation learn from your mom or your grandmother amen do you say anything about the preachers in here no i'm sure the preacher did a good job i'm sure but he says the holy child you've known this as a child you planted these scriptures in your halloween like i said our hope doesn't rest on a preacher our hope doesn't rest on the tape our hope has an anchor in heaven praise god it's behind the veil it's our hope is a person it's not a thing it's a person it's jesus christ the amen amen amen so continue in them what you've learned and you can be assured of continuing that amen uncertain we'll just put that on the shelf praise god that's right and yes your shelf is going to get full sometimes if you've lived in this if you if you live in the same place for more than a year your shelves are going to get full pretty fast all right when i first got my calls i'm like crazy oh man i got so much room in here now it's overflowing time to go to goodwill praise god but you know it's true like that's how it is with god too right you know god i've all you learned so much about god but then there's like well i wonder about this and then all the girls ask me this one this one this one and now my shelf is full there's all it's okay god will take him down a new season praise god amen i'd rather be filling myself with thoughts about god than other things than women is that right see it's continuing in what you've learned things that you're certain of holy scriptures and your faith is in jesus christ so this is how we'll overcome in this age the holy scriptures that you're taught that you'll learn that you know work keep believing those amen continue with those praise god one what i've always just said this thing brother william this ain't even a sermon or it ain't even a scripture one of the brotherhood of sermons called be certain of god 1959. i've been in trouble you know numerous times where like uh i'm fearful right okay i'll just be fearful like is this going to happen how's it going and i will just quote the title of that sermon i'll just preach it to myself like that song says i'm going to preach to the word he's already song when i'm afraid like when i was afraid i would i missed my flight and i wouldn't be able to see my family on time i just start recording that that sermon title it ain't even a verse i say be certain of god be certain of god and somehow at the last moment i make the flight by god's brain or something that would seem really uh really impossible it'll work out now of course you could take that back to the scripture because all the scripture says you can be certain of god's prophets maybe he's any scripture he's faithful you know god is faithful anything is possible with god you know is anything too hard for the lord from genesis you can use that anything but the point i'm making is that as we battle to be mighty we've got to look back to the holy scriptures and it will it will make us wise to overcome our battles right now it will make us wise to go in the rapture and a wise to make us be a part of the millennium praise god and the future of brexit amen amen amen most people don't most churches don't realize about the millennium they don't even realize it they only realize about the future home you know we have such understanding so may god help us to continue in the things that we know of and we are certain of praise god amen what's been given to us thus saith the lord with the scripture praise god amen now paul after this he goes into this thought all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine to teach you also reprove as we said this morning like a rebuke right find your faults right so you know preachers have a delicate balance you've got to preach and find thoughts with people but not make it personal you know why because when i'm like this i've got three fingers pointing back at me and if you follow me around enough i'm gonna make mistakes right so i i've gotta lay out false and brotherhood even says a preacher looks at what the people are lacking but man says and tells them to start there and give them what they can uh receive to help them he says start with their their weak points he says that's right preachers should be able to see the church and say how can we get more spiritual how can we improve our services praise god amen so the word teaches us it convinces us or convicts us finds our faults it corrects us which restores us to the right mindset and it gives us instruction to be more pure in our lives amen scripture does this now were you counting church that's like five that's four things i think in that scripture right uh doctrine reproof correction instruction yeah so there's four wars number deliverance earthly number praise god so scripture helps you in those four ways on earth that the man of god may be perfect or fitted so imagine a warrior with all the armor that fits not like david and saul whereas saul's like take my armor that didn't fit him amen what fit him was the sling praise god he knew how to use that by god's grace amen that's what fit him praise god and that's all he needed glory david was thoroughly furnished praise god unto the work of slain goliath amen he didn't need all the saul's fittings and off saw his clothing and saw his armor he didn't need all that denominational armor praise god he had the armor and the weapons that god had already proved to him amen god had already proved these are right he's learned how to use your praise god like the verse says continue david and what you've learned what you know that works david was assured the slain worth amen he see the word praise god and that's how we are denominationalism creed don't work but the living word of god works it changes lives amen amen it slays giants praise god it moves mountains praise god it brings down strongholds amen hallelujah here's some more complexes amen right takes away dissolves all of our doubts amen praise god amen see the scripture here makes us fitted truly that's an interesting word throughly used to be thoroughly but throughly furnished which means perfectly supplied to every good work so anything god wants me to do it the scripture i must first be taught the scripture of doctrine i must be shown my faults glory i must be restored to a right mind i must have a pure life and then if i've got all those praise god then i am fitted and i'm supplied to do every good thing god wants me to do praise god i'm invincible like that you're invincible if you let the scripture be your weapon and let it teach you correct you praise god believe it praise god let the scripture shape your life hallelujah amen amen [Music] i'm trying not to teach i'm trying to preach that's right so faith in the holy scriptures makes you mighty or wise unto salvation see makes you mighty not foolish as we heard this morning not o fools slow to believe why don't you believe the message why don't you believe the bible no we're wise we believe the bible praise god we've got faith in the word of god i believe when i open up the word of god god's gonna pour something out to me and give you understanding praise god amen hallelujah i believe if i keep preaching this we'll see more lives change for the good amen praise god more people will know jesus christ and him crucified if i just opened up this book and preached all that it says amen amen amen see it's faith in the holy scripture that's been revealed to us praise god hallelujah amen it makes us wise know that we can conquer jesus we can overcome yes we can win the battle we can finish the race amen we can win the war we can defeat the fires again we can be victorious amen amen hallelujah amen thank you jesus i love this those women were training them up from a child it's like they knew he was going to be a mighty man or you're not like other boys you're special like they said this morning we want to be special for god all right we're going to be used by god one of the wise virgins that's what i mean we're all special about it but god's grace but he trained him up put these scriptures in his heart well then paul says my i see i see the faith that's in you timothy i see it in your mother and your grandmother then just put this word in there that's what that's what god told moses just talk about it when you're sitting down talking about it when you're at the table put the scriptures on your doorpost praise god put it on your watch put it on your phone put it everywhere you go praise god put the word and surround yourself with the word of god amen it says everywhere you see it's all you think about praise god it's always there it's like a shield protecting you praise god amen it's like a layer of protection praise god it's there and you can access it and anytime you need it you just pull it down and use it praise god amen it's always there hallelujah so i just thought you know i heard a sermon i listened to uh uh invisible union bride of christ good wonderful message i listened to another sermon by a different preacher and i got to stop from the preacher so i'm gonna have to take this with you that was a good one visible union that's a good one there praise god i may preach on that later by god's grace now to see faith in the scriptures now we'll look at different topics here and just give you some scriptures you can fight with i'll tell them hey man you know sometimes i get so busy just in my life and paying the bills and cleaning the house and doing up teaching and all i got to do all the things that i do is a man a family sometimes when trials come i actually forget to quote the word of god and like god has to have one of my kids encourage me or my wife or kind like wake me up that's right yeah i gotta fight here okay yeah you know i'm human praise god we all get busy and and i just reminded that this week that you know when tribes come or things what we need to do is write to the word of god praise god so see your faith will make you overcome uh will make you mighty to overcome fear and you can use these scriptures i was quoting this this morning while we were watching that video i didn't watch this video too much i was all nervous i was quoting this i said lord you're with me even though i walk through the valley of shadow of death you're with me i'll fear no evil yeah i'm all nervous who am i am i going to offend somebody am i going to i said lord you're with me right here praise me i was quoting that your rod and your staff you're coming so this is a scripture when we're afraid let the holy spirit bring this to our hearts yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil amen think about that you're in a valley right of the shadow of death so death is looming over you and death shadows upon you and david says even in that i won't be afraid praise god that takes some real anointing right there that guy was anointed man that's why he could say that praise god for thou art with me and i rod and thy stab they comfort so he's like a shepherd so dave recognizes i'm like a sheep praise god i'm in the valley but the shepherd's right here with me praise god that's why he's not afraid i can feel the shepherd's hand i can feel his step i can feel this rod i know he's right here with me praise god so there's no reason for me to fear my protectors here praise god i can overcome fear because jesus is here praise god amen it's a comfort to know where i can feel his ride in his staff that's right i get a little off he's gotta hold me back amen you gotta attack me on the back i'm gonna go a little slow that's a comfort to me where god keeps me alive right now amen so when we're afraid may the holy spirit bring us this i will fear no evil for thou art with me your rod and your staff they comfort me lord let your presence comfort me in the midst of the valley of shadow of fear the phrase in the midst of fear comfort me praise god so i forget about my fear and all i can think about is that he's with me i knew that david did praise god this one my mom taught me from a young age that god has not given us a spirit of fear god will not send you that box of rattlesnakes praise god god will not send that deliverer to knock on your door praise god god does not give the spirit of fear now he allows it praise god he allows those temptations to come but what he's trying to get inside your house praise god because after you hear the knock on the door he's trying to get power in there loving there and a sound line so that when you open the door and you see something fearful you'll be able to slam the door and you'll be able to dwell in your house in peace and safety and strength with no fear that's what god gives us not a spirit of fear but a spirit of power amen amen hallelujah amen thank god amen amen god didn't send this to me i don't have to have it praise god he didn't want this for me yesterday he tested me with it sure did but he already gave me the power to overcome it amen hallelujah amen why because he's with me amen wherever i walk the shepherd is with me he's got power he's got love he got a sound mind for me he has all these things for me if i'll just take them from them just receive his gifts praise god this one i was reading the scripture this was a blessing too faith in the holy scriptures make you mighty to overcome many afflictions and we were we were speaking a few months ago but amen seem like you've been through numerous affections just distresses right and this scripture just reminded me of you and this is what i think brother desmond bryant i think might have mentioned this one here about being contrite the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart the church when you're broken god's not far from you god's right there with his man god sees you remember the bible said jesus won't even break a bruise read praise god we'll see like a plant that's got a broken leaf on it we'll just rip it off you know that's not jesus he won't even break a bruised reed be so gentle see so the lord is so close when our hearts are broken and he saves those who are of a contrite and a repentant spirit praise god amen so forgive me lord forgive me i'm broken i've sinned against you i've made some mistake i i've done wrong lord god forgive me i repent and right there the bible said god's right there with you praise god amen let me say like this whether you feel it or not the bible says the lord is praise god and all scripture is god breathed amen our scriptures inspired god's writing their church and we don't even see it but god opened our eyes so we can see the king is in the camp amen amen it says many are the distresses of who denominations the backsiders the workers of iniquity god lets the righteous go through many afflictions these are not related to sin this is just what god allows you to learn in other words god let us get distressed and it wasn't anything we did it was just god allowed it to test us say because look what's next many you have many distresses in this life but the lord delivers them out of some of them amen is that right no god delivers from all of them praise god until it's your time to go home god's gonna deliver you from all of them praise god [Applause] your distresses your times of uh of fear times are broken god's right there i say like this sometimes i think god has to break us that fellowship with us sometimes we get so busy maybe we're not talking to god like we ought to so sometimes god will have to break us just to have some fellowship with us where you really cry out to god lord i need you lord i gotta have something praise god it's life and death amen let's be honest what percentage of our prayers are 100 percent sincere see we just it just is a cycle we go through it's normal it's a cycle right where we have to that's why paul said die daily in other words have revival every day at some point during the day we should pray a real sincere prayer if not it's just insincere and so perhaps god will allow us many distresses to show us that we need him praise god which will draw us closer to him and then i've tried remember brother and i said we'll just see just see try it see every that's how it comes across pulpits every time you're sick any problem just speak and speak it like it's going to go away but the bible says many are the afflictions and it's preached like you don't have to have any afflictions we're the bride you're the queen of heaven and you're perfect and all these things like that but the bible says the holy scripture says that i if i'm righteous i'm gonna have many distresses but that's okay it's gonna draw me closer to god god is actually closer to me praise god and then god will come around and deliver me from all my distresses amen you see that process i really believe that prosperity thing is slipping into the messes churches because you never hear about well what's god's will for the situation it's just like speaking speaking promises probably that's true but here the bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but church god will deliver you out of them all amen let's say this together say god will deliver me ready god will deliver me from them all ready from them amen god will deliver you church from the lord hasn't he done it praise god has he done thus far praise god delivered us from our afflictions our mistakes oh yes our secret sins our presumption of senses from the jim great shot that was so beautiful masterpiece message yes we thought i would say it's like masterpiece theater here god sent us the best preachers to give us exactly right down to our lives it's beautiful the lord delivereth them out of them all praise god in other words you're a mighty man you're mighty women you get delivered you've overcome you don't lose you get victory you win praise god amen i win by the grace of god amen amen we have to fight there's going to be afflictions there's going to be distresses but i win because the lord is not to me i could have went on my own but somebody else greater than me is here praise hallelujah that's jesus revenge faith in the scriptures makes you overcome revenge well i'm going to get her back she said that way too loud dearly beloved avenge not yourself don't get back at people but rather give place unto wrath for it's written vengeance is mine i will obey god's the one who's going to pay somebody back you don't have to pay anybody back with evil god will pay them back with you therefore if your enemy hunger if he thirsts give him drink for in so doing thou shall keep coals of fire on his head it just according to the bible it just burns them up burns him up you know when i was a sinner i had a christian friend and he would always do good to me i'd laugh and make fun of him and that's what it did to me it kind of burned my head up because i knew i was wrong in other words conviction came upon me right when someone's good to you and you're not good to them that burns conviction on your head yeah praise god yeah my mom taught me this one too you haven't quoted as much as the uh spirit of fear but it's so true be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good right god works all things to our good praise god and we should always be good to everybody praise the lord amen someone's done us wrong say i'm not going to pay them back god's going to pay them back but even like i pray church even as we pray for our politicians i pray first help them to repent of their murderous ways amen that's my first prayer and if they can't be saved then god bring them down but vengeance is mine the lord will repay praise god amen overcome evil with good faith in the holy scriptures makes you overcome lust right like jesus said lust of the eyes if you look on a woman you've already committed adultery with her already in your heart and look what he says here if your right eye offends it offensively pluck it out cast it from the for it's profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not thy whole body should be cast into hell what is scripture here's one i use a lot i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me praise god amen that's not going to be a part of me that's not going to be bothering me that weight is not going to be on me praise god but i'll do like paul said in hebrews 12. i'll lay aside these weights amen we'll lay aside the weights that easily present us and run the race with perseverance amen amen these are scriptures we need to quote scriptures i'll set the wicked thing before my eyes my heart will be pure i didn't put this one on there but jesus said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god how many want to see god i want to see him on the good side praise god i don't see him with mercy [Music] and so that's the scripture lord created i love that one too psalm 51 created me a clean heart i'll just play that song i just go because when i come before the lord and i failed or something i just but psalm 51 created me a clean heart right because we all have we all have ink uh unclean hearts at times right sure that's been a great scripture i wish you would put that one on there but that's been a real help to me created me a clean art you know what god does it praise god amen amen see faith in the scriptures also makes you overcome mightily it helps you overcome impatience that's right when you've got to have something now here's some beautiful scriptures psalm 64 4 for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither have the eye seen o god beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him amen man can't hear it man can't see it man can't even imagine what god has prepared for those who are waiting now on god to fulfill his word amen amen hallelujah amen amen you can't imagine it and we'd like to talk about it praise god we know he'll do exceedingly abundantly but none of us can even come close to imagining what god is going to do as we wait upon his coming praise god it is so great it hasn't entered into man's mind we can't see it with our eyes we can't hear it like that sermon really laid out what god's going to do you won't do it it's something god has put deep in his heart praise god yes it's something god has saved hallelujah for the right time in season amen like brother i'm trying to explain about the marriage up of the lamb but the rams of that table will be miles long and we'll look across the table in the saints we neighborhood will be sitting across the table he says then we'll look down there we'll see all the heroes of the faith praise god like the hymn of heaven we see the heroes of the faith and then jesus will come and give us communion he'll step out and he'll start serving communion if you imagine the bread and the wine he'll start serving us like we try to hear it we try to see it we try to imagine it but church is going to be beyond that she said i will not drink this wine or this cup with you until i drink a new in my father's kingdom you imagine he's waiting two thousand years now time does nothing to jesus but he's waiting 2 000 years to drink of that communion i won't drink it until i'm in my father's kingdom with my people praise god that's a long time to wait so george just be encouraged and that sure this encourages me too even if the rapture doesn't come in my day i know god has something great prepared yeah amen for me because i'll be the dead in christ that rise first right praise god so whether i see it or not it doesn't matter god has great things prepared i'm waiting on him praise god i'm not trying to make his word come to pass i'm just speaking his word i'm just believing it i'm just applying it to my daily life praise god and it's making me wise under the rapture praise god amen amen amen either way i'm waiting i'm not trying to be a prophet i'm not trying to be something i'm not i'm waiting on god i'm being i'm being assured i'm learning the things that i need to do and be assured of praise god hallelujah and i'm assured of them and they will bring me with the wisdom i need in order to be ready for the coming of the lord praise god and it's assuring me a certain future with christ amen amen lord oh my see when i preach like this i wear on my voice faster that's why sometimes it's easier to teach but then wait upon the lord shall renew their strength amen they shall mount it with wigs as eagles that's right they shall run and not be weary oh yes they shall walk and not be faked see one time the pastor asked me he said have you ever felt like quitting i said well one time and then god sent me brother amen and sisterhood you know and then they said well how do you do it then i told my amen i said i lay right here at the altar that's me waiting on the lord to fulfill his word that's me pleading with god lord please fulfill your word lord fulfill your word and he's like i will i will i will be patient wait on me praise god and then it gives me strength to rise up like the eagle and soar praise god that's right and understand that he will work it out perfectly in his own time i can't even imagine what he has prepared for us praise god but i'll wait on him because i know he's worth waiting for praise god amen amen and remember we read this a few weeks ago the eyes of the lord run to and fro he's trying to find the mighty man his eyes are going all over the earth all around the sphere of the earth to show himself strong in behalf of them whose heart is perfect that means that peace god's looking for somebody who has peace in their heart that he can show his strength in that's what he's looking for today lord help my heart to be at peace tell me not to be moved by events that happen in my life help me not to be flustered help me not to be flighty help me not to be shaken help me to be solid help me to be assured of what i believe praise god and then if my heart's at peace then god will show himself strong in my life praise god amen amen hallelujah your faith in the scriptures will make you mighty to overcome any insufficiency of your basic needs just to just have faith in god's word just have faith in the holy scriptures how do you believe that paul says i know how to be a base i know how to be humbled and i know how to have increase with finances i know how that little much everywhere in all things i'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry so there's times god will struck me this is a time of less you're not going to eat as much this is a time you're going to have to be full and have plenty of food both to abound here you're having a season of increase but then you're going to have a season to suffer now why aren't the prosperity people preaching this you see what i'm saying they just they only take they only take this and they apply it to a football game or they apply to the stock market they don't apply it to it's actually written to help people who don't have enough food we don't have enough clothes that's what it's actually written for in other words i can make it with less because christ is in me he's mighty in me praise god that's what it's actually for but it's used the wrong way so i told you this in football we'd always write this we write philippians 4 13 on our wristbands yeah i can do anything i can score touchdowns i can tackle people ridiculous and then i mix it up i'd be like is it 3 14 or 4 13. i'd be like that every friday what one is that where's it at the bible i can't find that i'll just do 4 13 or i'll just do 3 14. we were so carmen we wanted god's blessing but we didn't want to love god we didn't want to keep his commands right now when you go down further six verses later i love this church when you have less or you have little this is the scripture to quote my god not another god my god shall supply all my needs praise god according to his riches in glory by christ jesus amen my god will supply whatever i have need of you know i was listening to a podcast last week and talked about the famines in africa which we've we've sent some relief and a a a listener wrote in and said is god cursed africa the preacher is like no it's just a season i know that was a good answer because he says look at europe and africa from just a hundred years ago it was flip flop europe had famines and diseases but yet their church was on fire mm-hmm john wesley yeah 100 so now it's 300. okay sorry now it's flipped europe has no revival at all they hardly have any churches there they're spiritually dead but yet africa their numbers are rising all the time yet with family yet with less yet with struggles see that's true so the natural thing with paul his natural needs whether he had food or not wasn't an indicator of how he was close to god or not it was a season of tests it was showing him that the strength of christ is perfect in every situation amen amen hallelujah amen whether you have little oh yes or whether you have much i thought that was one of the wisest answers i've heard in a long time which one would you rather be in a dead place where you have all this kind of food with no revival or would you be in a place where they're suffering but there's revival and your stomach hurts waiting on god to supply food all right that's real that's real revival right there praise god because that's what paul had praise god amen there's going to be seasons where i've got food seasons where i have less but i can do all things through christ who strengthens me praise god that's real faith church amen that's real faith and these scriptures church will make you wise unto salvation amen or wise when you struggle or when you suffer or you have hard times these scriptures will make you wise in the difficult times it'll prepare you for heaven that's what i'm saying amen to prepare you for those pearly gates amen to the streets of gold and the transparent city it'll prepare you to live in that holy city because for god all things are possible and my god will give you everything you need praise god if you didn't give it then it wasn't it wasn't god's will then but he's going to give you everything that you have need of amen praise god everything i need of my god shall supply and breathe i'm talking about fighters now i'm talking about mighty men women men and women amen praise god amen as i'm talking about people that know how to overcome trials and god help us all praise god this is what we're learning to be god is trying to raise us up i guess amen is that right god wants to raise you up where are you raise your faith amen faith in the holy scriptures faith in christ jesus amen i'm almost done bear with me here i've been a good audience twice today okay twice different buildings you can follow me up there to akron uh northern akron so i appreciate that god bless you all i told paul said they're the sweetest people i said i shouldn't say the sweets in the world you know i don't want to do that greatest thing again i'll say like this the sweetest people i could ask that's right so i tell my wife i said honey i want to call you the greatest woman in the world i say you're the best for me that's just it yeah i don't want to exhaust her over any other sister i don't exaggerate brothers already so i just say well you're the best church i could ask for that's right okay is that okay amen hebrews 13 when you have insufficiency let your conversation be without coverages don't talk about things you wish you had when you're lacking don't focus on what you don't have but be content with such things this is holy scripture this makes you wise unto salvation why because he's promised i'll never leave you amen lee i'll never forsake you praise god amen austin laramie i will never leave you nor will i forsake you amen that's what he said that's what god said be content don't talk about what you don't have be thankful for what you do have amen you've got christ with you amen his presence is not unto us amen in the midst of trump that's mighty men and women many are afflicted but god is right with us delivering us out of every one of them praise god amen and i know the devil is going to test us he always does he's gonna test us no matter what whether we preach or not he's gonna test us so let's be strong in the word let's be mighty to fight and let's be let's be strong and brave and honest let's be mighty men and women for god's kingdom and we're gonna fight either way hmm hallelujah like i was talking about this morning how jesus rebuked you remember i had to repent last week or a couple weeks ago i preached about mighty men the next day i'm complaining about inflation i felt like the holy spirit said you fool you just preach something mighty man that's right and i'd ask god for you that's a shame church i'm ashamed i'm still ashamed of that i gotta give up a few uh luxuries in life i felt like the holy spirit rebuked me on that that's foolish don't complain about that humble yourself and that's what i found i found god humbling me amen and that's not a bad thing that's a good thing in other words mr beatrice i know how to be a base i also know how to bound that's true that's when we rejoice right very nice oh god send a bonding blessing send the increase but there's times where god's not going to send the abound it's going to be a season of a base so he's going to let he's going to let you lack some things he's going to say just be content so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper amen i will not fear what man shall do so man is affecting things that you don't have like like today our president and all the government you know they're affecting through inflation things that we don't have but we don't complain we're content and say the lord is my helper i will not fear what man or governments will do to me amen is that right i'm giving you scripture church i need these scriptures praise god i'm giving them to you because i'm the one who needs them too we all need them anyway when we're insufficient when we lust when we have fear right when we have all these issues there's scriptures we can go to there's certain weapons we can take out amen of our armory praise god and take him and fight the enemy and drive him back and say i will conquer in jesus name praise god amen thank you jesus amen glory when i feel like god doesn't see me i can be mighty in the scriptures god does see me amen i feel like god don't care about me god doesn't care about me humble yourselves therefore to the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care on him for he cares for you amen do you feel like no god doesn't see me no peter says god does care for you that's right if it feels like he's not it's because he's trying to humble you humble yourself remember you've got to make that choice god can make the situations come to your life but you can either choose to be prideful in those situations or you can accept the humility humble yourself that's something god can't do god can bring you to a situation where he wants you to be humble but he can't force you to be humble we've got to humble ourselves that's right because he cares for us he's going to allow many distresses brother austin lydia he's going to give us many afflictions he's going to allow it but he cares for us amen praise god this is the great test of faith ah this is the great hall of critics amen brother said if you want to make the hall of fame he said first you gotta walk through the hall of critics amen amen our whole lives are walking through a crowd a hallway of critics the devil criticizing this other preachers criticizing us there you know these people criticizing denominations people criticism you just gotta walk through praise god amen they say the lord is my helper he cares for me praise god amen amen i gotta wear that holy dress why you gotta why you gotta stop watching uh sports and why can't just come and have a beer with us i can't see god cares for me praise god he wants me to walk through the fire praise god amen he never let me he's close to me praise god he cares for me he will he will be with me praise god amen he will not forsake me that's right that's right as i battle the enemy he will not forsake me amen impossible he'd have to delete these out of the bible thank god it's not a digital bible because he'd have to come down he'd have to somehow take invisible ink and just scrap church and they ain't going anywhere thank god this ain't going anywhere i said your sword ain't going anywhere crazy amen i said your promises aren't going anywhere erased your victory's not going anywhere praise god you've got the victory you're more than a conqueror he made you a mighty man or woman praise god amen amen because he cares he cares so much american amen they left us all these promises when you feel like i don't see you no he cares for him but what i need to do is cast all my care on him that's when you know he cares amen when you cast all your cares on him then i know he cares for you didn't jesus say fear not mega church is that what he said he said don't be scared you little flock of sheep that's right hmm fear not your little sheep flock little little small flock it's your father's good pleasure so in other words god loves to do it god loves you to give god loves to give the holy ghost to people amen praise god amen god loves to give you the power amen the power to overcome praise god the power to be victorious god loves is his good pleasure he wants to see you be born again he wants to see him become mighty in the word of god he was deceiving a soldier on the front lines praying fasting getting almost faithful typing wearing modest clothes god wants to see you on the front lines overcoming in his name amen amen representing the kingdom of god that's what we did this morning we went there and we represented this is what the kingdom of god the is of god is not ahead the kingdom of god is right here praise god amen amen amen is molding us into soldiers in the kingdom of god amen hallelujah god's god's attitude is like oh i can't wait to give this to this brother i can't wait to give the kingdom to this sister oh i love to give the kingdom to this brother it's his good pleasure because i know the character in their heart i know what they're going to do with it just like job i can trust him in the storm i can trust him in every trial he's perfect by the blood she's perfect by the blood it's my pleasure i love to see them have the power of the holy ghost fill us with power lord praise god you know you're punching the air a lot when your buttons come out i don't that look at this one that's beautiful jeremiah 32. think god doesn't see you he said i'll give you one heart one way this is israel that they may fear me forever for the good for the good of who the good of them church why do we have one heart here how come we don't have divisions here we're arguing and fussing and people want to have a different pastor why don't we have division here because god's with you because this god is doing you good so most churches have divisions in fights like that right now you stop if you want to talk to somebody about that talk to brother jim about that god has made him a rock in that area he has just stood between different groups he stood there with the love of jesus christ see god you see we have one heart here why for the good of us we have one heart so we'll be a real example of christianity this is what a unified church looks like that's right we're not divided like that song says we're not divided all one body we one in hope and doctrine one in charity amen our christian soldiers amen so it's for the good of you and your children after you the next generation amen god darius who's going to be the next pastor here who's going to preach all these years who's going to preach every service when it's easy and when it's hard who's going to do it i like doing it i thank god i can do it but it's for us and our children that's right if there's another generation and i'll make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good that's right but i'll put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from it so what keeps you close to god is the fear of god right the love of god god places love into your heart god place something in me where i can't turn away from him all i can do is turn to him amen it's the love of god the fear of god praise god it's god's love that he's poured into our hearts amen amen amen god said i'll do that i love that don't you love that i wills brother i heard the preacher say that don't you love the i wills of god that's not like he will he will it's i will that's a personal god saying that that's right i will not turn away from you amen god will not turn away from your prayers amen amen i will not turn away from you i will and i will put my fear in your heart amen grant it lord help me to fear your name all the days of my life amen he will do it he said i will like that he will put the fear of god in our hearts amen look at verse 41 this is so tremendous yes i will rejoice over them to do good how does god that's how god feels about israel god rejoices over the jews god rejoices you imagine god happy jesus happy you rejoice in spirit in one place you know but he said yeah i'll rejoice over them to do them good in other words it'll be my pleasure to give them the kingdom praise god i'll happily give them these blessings praise god and i will plant them in this land assuredly with what's he going to do with not just a job he's not going to pay somebody else to do it he's not going to ask the angels to do it he said i'm going to do it with my whole heart and soul praise god amen amen amen this ain't a job for an angel like shadrach meshach and abednego let's say the angel job this is a god-sized job i'm gonna bring my people back i'm gonna put the love of god in them i'm gonna put the fear of god so we're all one praise god we're not divided we're one in hope and faith and doctrine i'm gonna just take care of this first row here we're one and we're one in faith we're all united in christ jesus i'm going to put my spirit in there they're not going to fear and i'm going to bring them back with all that's in me there can be nothing more to god than his heart and soul the heart and soul is the very center of his being and god said with the very center of my face i will keep my promises i will put you in your position [Applause] he's going to do that with his heart and soul for the jews what about us in other words amen i picture like this he's going to put us in the position for the rapture with all of his heart and his soul praise god he will every law that the government passes so that every move of the world council churches with all of his heart and soul he's going to slowly bring that pressure on the squeeze on and he's going to make us ready to place us lord not in a natural land but in a spiritual land praise god hallelujah at the merits supper of the lamb with all of his heart and all of his souls amen amen for thus saith the lord i love him amen like as i have brought all this great evil upon these people so i bring upon them all the good that i promise them praise god church god don't have evil promise to us we have many afflictions that we have to go through but he also promised to deliver us out of homelessness amen it's not evil to kill us it's not evil to destroy us it's not evil to discourage us it's tests it's afflictions of distresses to show us that he always delivers amen it shows that he'll be faithful to deliver us from all of our trials we must not wonder where's god god's right there god's waiting for the right time to deliver you just hang on the word believe the word god is not he's for you with all his heart and soul oh my he was that his whole heart and soul for the jews what about the brother what about the bloodball pride amen that's the old testament what about the new testament jesus said this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the release of your sins god is not going to hold your sins against you can't say that this god's already released them he's not i'm going to hold this against sister look i'm going to hold this against the brother austin i'm gonna hold this sin brother we haven't committed against him no he's already released amen and he's already tossing to see if he gets it he don't even see it anymore christ god that's what he said he said i take your sins and they're cast in the sea of forgetfulness that's what remission means to pardon you the man said you had a book of sins and jesus took his blood i wrote in the book pardoned p-a-r-d-o-n-e-d you're all your past life has been forgiven oh you're past wrongs god is forgiven he's washing him he washed them away that's what his covenant did a covenant is a promise a promise is a testament it's an oath god is going to keep his word if anybody's going to keep his word it's god amen amen won't be the president i'll tell you that amen even me i'll i'll i'll fall short i'll make a mistake but we know god will never make a mistake we know god will always keep his word amen amen paul says it like this he says he's quicken you he's made you are dead he's made you alive having forgiven you all your trespasses amen he don't hold one thing against you brother amen amen now do we have to yeah we have to suffer like joking we have to deal with our mistakes here but god is not holding anything against you in heaven he has released it he has sent it away like the two guns right the one that died and the scapegoat bye goat bye bye sins bye you go off in the wilderness left all alone devoured done away with that's what he did to your sin your sin is done away with amen i think it's cast away it's forgiven it's remitted by the grace of god through the blood of jesus christ amen that's your covenant that's right and church he did it with his whole heart and soul he did it with the soul of jesus christ praise god amen so god said to my soul i'll place the jews back but he said to to redeem the gentile bride he said i'll give my son soul as an offering for sin that's right jesus christ he gave the soul for you and i in other words he gave everything he had oh my god didn't spare any of his strength amen god didn't spare any of his love god did not spare anything when he brought you to himself when he wanted to show you his covenant and his promises he spared no expense he gave the greatest thing you could do the son i saw the soul of his son he offered that as a sacrifice for your sins that's how much god loves you praise god amen amen it pleased the lord to bruise his son he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin but jesus would see his seed his spiritual offspring verse 11 he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied god saw jesus on the cross that satisfied his wrath by his knowledge on my righteous servant he'll justify many that means declare you righteous amen amen even though you did everything wrong and jesus did nothing wrong it's a perfect substitution the divine substitution my servant my son because he made his soul offering for sin he gave his own soul as offering for sin he shall justify many people amen for he shall bear their iniquities jesus took the punishment of your iniquities your lawlessness jesus paid for our lawlessness and he paid for with all of his soul and the church said amen god just don't leave these verses in here for another there's something to it he gave that's that's why paul said i wish i could be cursed that my brother might be saying same thing substitution there it is right there right substitution i wish they could take my place and i could take their place he so loved them he wished i could give my soul that's exactly what jesus did because he so loved the world he gave his soul as an offering for sin praise god oh no better sacrifice can be made amen than the sweet sinless soul of jesus christ the holy soul jesus being offered as a sacrifice for you and i and now he's justified you he took your iniquities away he's released your sins your pardon you're forgiven amen amen so you could be a mighty woman today and not let these temptations make you fall to make you a mighty man where you can go through the most difficult seasons of your life and still say i can make it through this season because i can do all things i can make it through all seasons through christ who strengthens your name praise i'm god done i think i just get lost in heavenly places don't even ask me what time it is oh my lord have mercy i thought there's no way this would even take me half an hour to preach right there's the holy spirit i'll close with this one we'll close this and i'll maybe preach it wednesday we'll kind of see how the lord directs i would like to finish that son of man son of god son david oh yeah i'm sorry here's more about our covenant now the god of peace that brought again the dead from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd and the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant what does this covenant do it makes you perfect in every good work amen to do his will in other words god wants you to do the perfect will of god the blood of christ made a way for it think about that you don't have to slip into the permissible of god like jonah right you don't have to do that like like moses moses missed out on the prophet because of his pride and anger and rebellion we don't have to do that because our covenant is a greater covenant the blood makes you perfect in every good work to do god's will work it in you that which is well pleasing insight through jesus christ to whom we glory forever and ever amen amen there's a reason i'm going through these here well you know what where am i okay romans 4 6 are we still in god knows where i am yeah yeah when i feel unseen by god okay i put these in here for a purpose when you feel unseen by god the bible says even as david describes the blessedness of this man whom unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin we want to be blessed church on this life but really the greatest blessing we can have is for the holy spirit to say william i'm not imputing your sin unto you amen that'd be the greatest blessing we could have amen in this earth amen i will not impute your sin unto you amen i will remit it amen praise god amen that's the greatest blessing i could have amen amen without works without works yes you're justified and forgiven without any words amen it's a gift of grace praise god and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised in other words this faith was already inside of him but time was going to bring it out amen amen in other words i wanted for 19 years i got done this morning oh but after that 19th year oh the holy spirit started to deal with me and the faith that was set was in there the whole time and finally come out the the light of the sun finally shone on it the waters of the spirit finally fell on it and now the righteousness that i always had now it can be seen by others praise god amen same thing for you you couldn't come forth till the right time in season that righteousness was always inside you i know you were walking to church in the snow man this guy was walking alone to church in the snow hallelujah yeah i i can see the righteous of god in you each one of us it manifested at different times but that righteousness was already in you the whole time that that potential the potential to serve god that's right and the bible says you had it yet being uncircumcised like like abraham he hadn't had the covenant yet but yet god saw god foresaw god knew you would accept it that abraham might be the father of all them that believe though they not yet be circumcised that that righteousness might be imputed unto them also speaking to the gentiles yes just as abraham already had this righteousness before the covenant came so did you you already had the righteousness it just you didn't know about it yet until the word of god came to you amen because faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of god let's see i better stop one two three four i got 19 more to go we better stop let's stand here i'll try to change that up i didn't think i had that much here let's musicians can come by guys grace i want to see if anyone needs prayer and i want to sing this new song here by god's
