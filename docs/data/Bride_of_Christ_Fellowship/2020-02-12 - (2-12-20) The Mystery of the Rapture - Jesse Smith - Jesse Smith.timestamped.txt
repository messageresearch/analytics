[30:01] let's take our Bible Saints lets us
[30:04] stand for the reading God's Word like
[30:05] use it deeply let's go to first
[30:11] Corinthians chapter 15 as you see by the
[30:13] title kind of had a just waiting in the
[30:17] the balances here to preach on the
[30:20] rapture mystery kind of goes along with
[30:23] the book I'm writing this is a chapter I
[30:26] finished a while ago but I like to have
[30:29] preached down through the chapter and
[30:30] then see about the inspiration that
[30:33] comes to me if I want to add anything
[30:34] else or willing to it I'll be taking it
[30:37] from a perspective as it's new to people
[30:41] and then trying to use as much scripture
[30:44] as we can by God's grace so maybe it
[30:50] Lord willing it'll feel like little
[30:51] Bible study I like to look at this
[30:52] thought here tonight first Corinthians
[30:54] chapter 15 verse 51 and 52 first
[31:04] Corinthians 15:51 and 52 all right let's
[31:29] read let's read fifty one together and
[31:34] then I'll read 52 here at the house 51
[31:37] all of us in the children on three one
[31:40] two three behold I show you a mystery we
[31:45] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[31:49] changed
[31:50] I'll read verse 50 to myself in a moment
[31:53] in the twinkling of an eye at the last
[31:56] Trump for the trumpet shall sound and
[31:59] the dead shall be raised incorruptible
[32:01] and we shall be changed that's that one
[32:05] more word of Prayer if you have a need
[32:05] on your heart to make it known unto God
[32:07] let's have weird
[32:08] they were grateful to be gathered here
[32:11] Lord through livestream father we ask
[32:13] God that your Holy Spirit would bless us
[32:15] here that we could receive your word
[32:16] rejoicing and father claimant quoted as
[32:19] a promise Lord God and knowing that Lord
[32:22] will either be changed while we're
[32:24] living or changed as the dead in Christ
[32:26] so Lord that's a great promise and
[32:28] father we believe that with all of our
[32:29] hearts Lord God
[32:30] quicken your word to us afresh sure
[32:32] tonight in Jesus Christ's name
[32:34] no reason amen god bless you I'll try to
[32:53] set our timer so we can be timely here
[32:56] tonight Lord willing also brother Jose
[33:01] it has to be one time recently too to
[33:05] look at the the order of kind of the
[33:09] body change so Lord willing at the end
[33:11] of the service or the end of the
[33:13] teaching here tonight
[33:14] I'll stop and do that and read some
[33:17] quotes and then show the the related
[33:19] scriptures that show the order of the
[33:22] body change and we know it's a great
[33:28] thing where Paul says he's showing us a
[33:33] mystery what a blessing too to be able
[33:36] to know a mystery straight from the
[33:39] Apostle Paul and in the book this will
[33:43] be the last chapter out of the twelve
[33:45] mysteries this will be the last one and
[33:47] I think it was very fitting that it
[33:49] would be the last one because the
[33:51] rapture is the last event of the Gentile
[33:54] dispensation so we know the New
[33:57] Testament right now is given over to the
[33:59] Gentiles of course there's a few Jews
[34:01] there's a remnant in every age just like
[34:03] in Paul's day Romans 11 says there's a
[34:06] remnant according to the election of
[34:09] grace so even in Paul's day all the way
[34:11] up to today there are a small group
[34:13] there always has been a small group of
[34:15] Israelites who had their eyes open to
[34:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we're
[34:20] filled with the Holy Ghost they're
[34:21] called
[34:22] the remnant of Israel those who can
[34:24] receive Christ now the rest were blinded
[34:27] the rest of the nation were cut off and
[34:30] the Bible says we were grafted in the
[34:33] Gentiles were grafted in to the holy
[34:35] tree so I think this is very fitting to
[34:37] be the last of the mysteries because it
[34:40] is the last event we believe also it is
[34:43] the literal happening of the seventh
[34:45] seal because there's only seven seals
[34:47] and we know they're given the open book
[34:50] and when it's it's open it's given to
[34:53] the Gentiles according to revelation 10
[34:55] 11 is taken to every people a nation and
[34:58] kindred and tongue Gentiles so this is a
[35:01] mainly a Gentile event but as we said it
[35:04] dude does include a remnant so it's the
[35:08] final event of the Gentile dispensation
[35:10] and as you know immediately after the
[35:15] Gentile rapture God cuts off the Gentile
[35:21] people from having access to the baptism
[35:25] of the Holy Ghost at that moment he
[35:27] grafts back in Israel and they get to
[35:30] hear two prophets preached to them the
[35:32] same message we believe right now that
[35:34] Jesus Christ is the Messiah don't do
[35:36] great signs miracles and wonders so much
[35:39] so that we believe those two prophets
[35:41] will be literally Moses and Elijah
[35:44] because they're described as having the
[35:46] same ministries as revelation 11 teaches
[35:50] but let's get back to the rapture it's
[35:52] the unknown day an hour that Jesus
[35:55] Christ seek early and physically comes
[35:58] back to earth he doesn't touch the earth
[35:59] though because the Bible says we will
[36:03] see Christ in the air so as he descends
[36:06] he stops in the middle of the air and he
[36:09] doesn't touch this sin soaked earth and
[36:12] there he receives his bride what we
[36:15] would call their wedding day praise God
[36:18] so we know the rapture is our wedding
[36:21] day it's the day that the Bride of
[36:23] Christ physically is given to the groom
[36:28] the other bridegroom rather and so when
[36:33] the bride comes face-to-face with the
[36:35] groom
[36:36] we know that's the wedding day praise
[36:38] gods that's what we're living for most
[36:40] events in life the happiest are the
[36:43] wedding days right and the birth of
[36:45] children but God has designed his his
[36:49] Redemption story the climax of it would
[36:53] be the rapture of the New Testament
[36:55] church the wedding praise God and we
[36:57] know he has a marriage supper and a
[36:59] honeymoon and then he has a future home
[37:01] which is the happily ever after praise
[37:04] God so that's what we're describing
[37:07] tonight the rapture and I'm sure this
[37:10] would be good for our young children as
[37:12] well and a good review about the
[37:14] Scriptures for the adults so
[37:17] specifically it's called a rapture I'm
[37:20] sorry so the rapture is called a mystery
[37:22] in 1st Corinthians 15:51 specifically
[37:28] called a mystery and we know that the
[37:33] mysteries of God are all to be finished
[37:36] according to revelation 10 7 that just
[37:39] excites my heart to know that if Paul
[37:41] calls something a mystery and I am
[37:45] someone who knows the revelation of the
[37:48] mystery that excites me because I see
[37:50] that I'm part of prophecy being
[37:53] fulfilled in other words I'm not on the
[37:55] outside looking in trying to understand
[37:58] the mystery I'm on the inside I know a
[38:01] revelation in this revelation of a
[38:04] mystery the mystery of a rapture and
[38:06] it's by God's grace it's an open
[38:09] invitation to all but it's wonderful to
[38:12] be a part of that to know that we are a
[38:14] part of the fulfilling of revelation 10
[38:17] 7 the mysteries are finished and then
[38:20] they're taken around the world it's a
[38:22] great blessing to know that praise God
[38:26] now God is currently fulfilling the
[38:30] prophecy of Revelation 10 11
[38:32] by sending apostles and evangelists all
[38:36] around the world teaching the revelation
[38:39] of the rapture mystery and of course all
[38:42] the other mysteries as well but these
[38:44] are all part of the finished mystery of
[38:47] God
[38:48] and they're all being taken and preached
[38:50] around the world right now we're happy
[38:53] to do our part but as I've said before
[38:57] I'm sure many people have this desire at
[38:59] some point I desire to take the
[39:02] revelation of the mysteries overseas
[39:04] myself by God's grace in fact I've got
[39:06] another email today from a brother and
[39:08] Kenya asking me when are you going to
[39:09] come and preach these revelations to us
[39:12] as I said well now's not the season the
[39:15] Paul said I'll come to you at the
[39:18] convenient season and I can see this is
[39:20] a season of my life to Shepherd my
[39:22] family to Shepherd or the Saints and
[39:25] Akron I believe there will be a season
[39:27] Lord willing that I can take the
[39:30] revelations God has revealed to us
[39:32] through his prophet and now here through
[39:35] the the fivefold ministry more even more
[39:39] scriptures all the same revelation just
[39:41] more scriptures and I'd like to take it
[39:43] around the world to fulfill revelation
[39:46] 1011 let's just read a since I keep
[39:48] mentioning it revelation 10 11
[39:58] revelation 10 1 to 7 is the open book of
[40:02] the seven sealed book coming down to
[40:04] earth verse 7 but in the days of the
[40:07] voice of the seventh angel he shall
[40:08] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[40:09] be finished as he hath declared to his
[40:12] servants the prophets so all the
[40:15] prophets the Old Testament looked for a
[40:17] time when God would reveal all his
[40:20] mysteries like for example you think of
[40:23] Ezekiel you know and you think of Isaiah
[40:26] and I say I said a virgin shall conceive
[40:28] and Isaiah said there'll be a new
[40:30] heavens and a new earth
[40:31] Ezekiel said dead bones will rise and
[40:34] the breath of God will come into them
[40:37] well really that hasn't happened yet
[40:38] that's the 144,000 and then Ezekiel said
[40:42] a new heart a new spirit and then my
[40:44] spirit speaking of the three works of
[40:46] grace these are all mysteries these are
[40:48] all great things that they were looking
[40:51] forward to coming to pass but the Bible
[40:53] says in Revelation 10 7 there's a time
[40:56] when all these mysteries are made known
[40:58] and they're finished praise God and then
[41:01] they're finished because the book is
[41:03] open the mysteries are made known and
[41:05] then it's taken around the world verse
[41:09] 11 and he said unto me thou must
[41:11] prophesy again before many peoples and
[41:14] nations and tongues and kings now we
[41:17] know John himself couldn't accomplish
[41:19] that because he was already 92 95 years
[41:21] old at the time of this vision on the
[41:23] Isle of Patmos so this was speaking of a
[41:26] spiritual John a spiritual group that
[41:29] way at the end time will eat the
[41:31] revelation of the open book and then
[41:33] prophesy and take it around the world so
[41:36] we're happy to be fulfilling that I'll
[41:38] say like this we're prophesying again in
[41:40] this nation amen fulfilling verse 11
[41:45] where it says and nations praise God
[41:48] we're happy to do that by the grace of
[41:49] the Lord now
[41:53] next though as you know the word rapture
[41:56] is not in the King James Bible but many
[41:59] of us use it because it's a it's a
[42:01] common term that we all can understand
[42:04] like we like yesterday we were at the
[42:06] middle school and even these middle
[42:07] schoolers understand from the movie left
[42:09] behind or the book series left behind
[42:12] every they know even living in Christian
[42:15] homes they know there's going to be a
[42:17] taking away of God's people at some
[42:19] point we believe we have the true
[42:21] revelation of that but a lot of people
[42:24] that know anything about God or the New
[42:26] Testament or Jesus Christ know there's
[42:29] going to be this momentous future event
[42:32] where God is going to take his people
[42:34] away and we just refer to it as the
[42:38] rapture the scripture word is caught up
[42:42] which means a snatching away quick
[42:46] snatching away in the Greek another name
[42:50] you might call it if people don't want
[42:52] to use rapture they can call the
[42:53] catching up experience or they can call
[42:55] the first resurrection that's what it's
[42:58] called a Revelation 20 verse 5 you can
[43:01] call the rapture the catching up or the
[43:05] first resurrection there's other names
[43:06] you can use now something argue that we
[43:10] shouldn't use it and some people even
[43:14] will say like
[43:15] like we say since the word Trinity is
[43:17] not in the Bible we shouldn't use it but
[43:20] that's not exactly the right thinking
[43:21] because with the rapture the definition
[43:25] of the event is in the Word of God but
[43:27] with the Trinity neither the the word or
[43:30] the definition is in the Bible the Bible
[43:33] never says God is three persons so it
[43:37] can't be that and in fact last week
[43:39] church I heard I don't know if I shared
[43:42] this with you or not but the group that
[43:45] one of the groups that left the message
[43:47] now believes God is three persons and
[43:50] they asked a friend to describe it and
[43:52] they described the Godhead as three
[43:56] persons and they said maybe person isn't
[43:58] the best word so they said three minds
[44:01] now to me that was really surprising
[44:03] they believe in one God who has three
[44:06] different minds but yet one God not to
[44:09] me that would be a great confusion like
[44:11] a God that had three different minds
[44:13] would be very confused because we the
[44:16] Bible says we must have a sound mind I
[44:19] know that speaking of humans but we're
[44:21] in the image of God and so see that's
[44:24] just one example when people leave the
[44:25] revelation of the hour they will go too
[44:29] far extremes they will go to our
[44:31] erroneous extremes trying to understand
[44:34] God and it will always be wrong because
[44:37] they'll add their own words but we are
[44:40] to be the group that stays with the word
[44:42] of God we only say what the word says we
[44:45] live by every word we do not add to the
[44:47] word of God and I just want to share
[44:49] that just as a warning to someone also
[44:53] has encouragement to us to stay with the
[44:55] word it doesn't even make sense to say
[44:57] God has three minds but does make sense
[45:00] to say God is manifest as father he his
[45:03] father manifests himself in the flesh as
[45:06] a son first
[45:07] Timothy 3:16 and then the manifestation
[45:10] of the Holy Spirit and first Corinthians
[45:11] 12 is given to every man to profit
[45:14] withal so we can say God is one God in
[45:17] three manifestations we can say that
[45:19] because that's not a man's word or it's
[45:22] not a denominations word that's a word
[45:25] of st. Paul praise God that's part of
[45:27] Paul's doctor
[45:28] so I just want to share that that there
[45:31] is a difference between Trinity and
[45:33] rapture because rapture definition is
[45:36] right in the scripture now what's the
[45:39] confusion in the book I'm starting with
[45:42] a little introduction and that's the
[45:44] introduction I just talked about and
[45:45] then I have to show this is a book of
[45:48] revelations of mysteries I have to first
[45:50] show what is the confusion about the
[45:52] rapture so the confusion about the
[45:56] rapture centers around when it will
[45:59] occur most people admit there will be a
[46:02] rapture most people can see that in 1st
[46:05] Thessalonians 4 and first Corinthians 15
[46:08] most people can admit that I know there
[46:10] are small groups that believe the
[46:12] rapture already took place and they're
[46:16] wrong I mean you could say Jesus's
[46:17] rapture already took place that's true
[46:21] you could say the Saints the Old
[46:24] Testament that were resurrected with
[46:27] Jesus were then raptured to heaven you
[46:29] could say that raptures already taking
[46:30] place but you can't say that the rapture
[46:36] of the dead in Christ has happened yet
[46:38] the one that Paul was talking about even
[46:41] twenty or thirty years after Jesus
[46:44] ascended and went to heaven
[46:46] there was he was looking for a future
[46:48] rapture that hasn't happened yet and it
[46:51] would be the first resurrection not the
[46:53] second resurrection it would be a
[46:55] separate resurrection a separate rapture
[46:59] so the confusion is when will it occur
[47:05] most Bible students as you could read
[47:08] online well leave it'll be one of three
[47:10] different future times somebody even
[47:15] will either be pre-tribulation or in the
[47:19] middle of the tribulation or at the end
[47:22] of the tribulation
[47:23] so the rapture is always connected to
[47:25] tribulation and that's because the Bible
[47:27] speaks of judgment falling right after
[47:31] the tribulation I'll try it right after
[47:33] the rapture okay so the Bible speaks of
[47:36] Sun and destruction so let's go to that
[47:38] first Thessalonians 5 verse 1 let's go
[47:40] there
[47:41] and just show you that
[47:51] now first ice loadings for 13 to 18 is
[47:56] the rapture then verse 1 says but of the
[47:58] times and seasons brethren you have no
[48:00] need that I write unto you for
[48:01] yourselves know perfectly that's the day
[48:03] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[48:05] night now that's perfectly describing
[48:08] the catching up the snatching away as a
[48:10] thief would snatch away something in the
[48:14] night verse 3 for when they shall say
[48:17] peace and safety then sudden destruction
[48:20] cometh upon them as travail upon a woman
[48:23] with child and they shall not escape
[48:27] so the rapture comes like a thief in the
[48:30] night then write for that sudden
[48:31] destruction I think I read this a few
[48:34] weeks ago we're told to watch your prey
[48:36] and verse 6 we're not children of the
[48:38] darkness will not be will not be
[48:40] surprised by the rapture because we'll
[48:42] know the season of the rapture but verse
[48:45] 9 is what we look at for God hath not
[48:48] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[48:51] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[48:55] so we can't say the sudden destruction
[48:57] will come upon the raptured Saints
[48:59] because the Bible said we're not
[49:01] appointed to wrath were appointed to
[49:04] salvation or deliverance
[49:06] praise God so that's the confusion now
[49:12] there's a so there's three groups there
[49:15] that believe that anything pre-trib
[49:17] mid-trib or post-trip but I do want to
[49:20] say there is a small group that says the
[49:22] rapture has already taken place we know
[49:27] for sure it's not happened yet and it's
[49:30] still a future event because pause last
[49:33] letter before his martyrdom Paul
[49:36] condemned those who said the rapture was
[49:40] passed already saying their false
[49:42] doctrine was overthrowing
[49:44] the faith of some that's in 2nd time 2nd
[49:48] Timothy 2 17 and 18 Paul condemned them
[49:54] because they were saying
[49:55] the rapture was already taken place so
[49:59] Paul said their false doctrine was like
[50:01] gangrene there's like a flesh-eating
[50:03] virus so we know false doctrine eats
[50:07] away at people's spiritual lives and
[50:09] when they teach and believe false
[50:11] doctrine it opens the door to sin and
[50:14] the evil spirits and if not repented of
[50:16] instead of growing in grace they're
[50:19] gonna grow in unbelief or grow in a
[50:22] growing sinful habits so Paul also wrote
[50:27] in Titus saying Christians should deny
[50:30] worldly lusts in this present world
[50:32] looking for that blessed hope and the
[50:35] glorious appearing of the Great God and
[50:38] Savior Jesus Christ in Titus 2 12 and 13
[50:44] this is the glorious event Saints were
[50:48] still looking for 2000 years later
[50:50] praise God the appearing of Jesus Christ
[50:55] so there's also confusion about who will
[50:59] be in the rapture is it for everyone on
[51:02] earth there's people that believe that
[51:04] everybody will be raptured or is it for
[51:09] a smaller group a faithful spirit
[51:13] spirit-filled group of remnant
[51:16] Christians so I believe you'll find the
[51:21] scripture will answer these questions
[51:23] the scripture takes away all confusion
[51:26] the scripture shows the rapture is a
[51:29] pre-tribulation event and it's only for
[51:33] the Holy Ghost filled Saints those who
[51:36] have the born-again experience the
[51:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:42] [Music]
[51:43] praise God
[51:45] now let's go back if we can the 1st
[51:47] Corinthians 15:51 let's read verses 53
[51:52] and 54 to get the full understanding
[51:57] here
[52:06] now we read verses 51 and 52 for our
[52:09] text notice we're all changed our bodies
[52:18] are all changed not everyone will die
[52:20] corn numbers 51 not all Christians have
[52:23] to die but all Christians will be
[52:26] changed when they'll be changed at the
[52:29] last Trump now we'll get to that a
[52:31] little bit how there's a shout voice
[52:33] Trump that's a crucial part of the
[52:35] revelation of the rapture there's three
[52:38] phases to the rapture of the shout voice
[52:41] and Trump verse 52 says the rapture
[52:46] happens so fast happens in the twinkling
[52:48] of an eye just back dry and that's how
[52:51] fast the rapture will take place so
[52:57] children will we have time if we're not
[52:59] ready what we have time to have a long
[53:00] prayer meeting to get ready for the
[53:01] rapture yeah no you just have to be
[53:04] ready you just have to be sealed you
[53:07] just have to have oil like the parable
[53:10] of the ten virgins you just have to have
[53:13] it ready you don't have time to go and
[53:15] try to get more oil or you have to have
[53:18] the oil ready you have to be living in
[53:21] the victorious power of the baptism of
[53:24] the Holy Ghost you got to be living more
[53:26] than a forgiving life you have to be
[53:28] more than justified if to be more than
[53:30] sanctified you have to be filled with
[53:32] God's Holy Spirit praise God and if they
[53:34] have that oil in your soul the Holy
[53:37] Spirit in your soul
[53:38] ready to leave in the moment of the
[53:41] twinkling of an eye verse 53 actually
[53:51] let me read fit to 52 again in the
[53:52] moment wink of an eye at the last Trump
[53:54] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[53:55] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[53:57] shall be changed for this corruptible
[54:03] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[54:06] must put on immortality so when this
[54:12] corruptible shall put on incorruption
[54:14] and this mortal shall put on immortality
[54:16] then shall be brought to pass
[54:18] the saying that is written death is
[54:20] swallowed up in victory praise God
[54:25] let's go back and read that the children
[54:27] you know which prophet said that Paul is
[54:30] quoting a prophet who mentioned the
[54:32] rapture this was about 900 800 years
[54:37] before Jesus any guesses
[54:42] those Isaiah let's go to Isaiah 25 Paul
[54:46] is quoting Isaiah I shared that this
[54:51] week with a good friend it's amazing how
[54:54] the paul quotes isaiah where when we
[54:57] read isaiah 25:8 try to imagine you're a
[55:00] jew and see you see if this scripture
[55:04] reminds you of a rapture a body change
[55:11] let's actually start at verse 6 and in
[55:15] this mountain shall the Lord of hosts
[55:16] make unto all people a feast of fat
[55:19] things a feast of lines on the leaves of
[55:22] fat things full of marrow of lines on
[55:25] the leaves well refined just speaking of
[55:28] a great festival right wine festival
[55:33] verse 7 and he will destroy in this
[55:36] mountain the face of the covering cast
[55:38] over all people and the veil that is
[55:41] spread over all nations so this is a
[55:45] feast where all nations will have the
[55:46] veil taken off now the Bible talks about
[55:49] that in Corinthians Paul says right now
[55:52] there's a veil over Israel and they
[55:55] can't recognize Christ but he said when
[55:58] they see Christ that veil is taken away
[56:01] so this is speaking of a time when all
[56:03] nations will have the veil taken away
[56:06] verse 8 he will swallow up death in
[56:10] victory so this is what Paul is quoting
[56:13] and the Lord will wipe away tears from
[56:17] off all faces and the rebuke of his
[56:20] people shall be taken away from off all
[56:23] the earth for the Lord has spoken it now
[56:27] children just by reading those three
[56:29] scriptures you see
[56:31] you read anything about a trumpet
[56:33] sounding no.32 anything about shouting
[56:37] no so see God hid the rapture scripture
[56:43] in this Jewish scripture this is what I
[56:45] was telling the brother God hid a
[56:47] Gentile scripture in a Jewish scripture
[56:51] because God loves to hide things from
[56:54] the eyes of the wise and prudent but
[56:56] reveals them unto babes such as would
[56:58] learn this just looks like a feast it
[57:00] looks like a feast after all nations
[57:03] have been saved and everything that all
[57:06] we're just coming to Israel to have a
[57:07] feast and it may be that it may be that
[57:10] because it sounds like that it speaks of
[57:11] a holy mountain and it speaks of all
[57:14] nations having a great feast
[57:17] it looks like the Millennium right it
[57:19] looks like or we say even maybe the
[57:21] future home one of those but here in the
[57:24] middle of adversity he says he shall
[57:27] swallow up death and victory and then
[57:31] Paul says death will be swallowed up in
[57:34] victory so we can clearly see children
[57:40] that in our bodies is death right you
[57:44] all don't feel it yet wait to get my age
[57:47] wait to get to be an adult then you'll
[57:49] start feeling death I can't jump as high
[57:52] or run as fast as I used to I can't lift
[57:55] as many weights as I used to I can feel
[57:57] it I can feel I'm getting weaker not as
[57:59] fast I'm not getting I used to always
[58:01] get stronger stronger stronger now I'm
[58:03] just getting weaker weaker weaker matter
[58:05] how much I exercise death is in our
[58:08] bodies but the Bible says that the
[58:11] rapture death gets swallowed up in
[58:14] victory that's a great promise that
[58:17] we're looking for not all of us will
[58:18] have to go to the grave some of us will
[58:21] have our death inside of our bodies
[58:23] swallowed up in eternal life so I just
[58:28] want to share with everyone that's where
[58:30] the rapture scripture comes from hidden
[58:32] in there just like the resurrection of
[58:34] Jesus Christ was hidden in Psalm 16 at
[58:37] the very at this second half of the
[58:39] verse in Psalm 16 where David said he'll
[58:43] not leave my soul in hell
[58:45] neither will he let my body see
[58:47] corruption praise God the greatest event
[58:49] that ever happened the resurrection of
[58:51] Jesus Christ
[58:51] pinin in one scripture in Psalm 16 he
[58:56] received the same thing the same type of
[58:57] thing
[58:58] God hiding his revelation inside of a
[59:02] scripture that even goes to the Jews
[59:06] praise God now let's go to first
[59:11] Thessalonians 4:15 first item is 4:15
[59:24] let's read 15 through 18 for this we say
[59:41] unto you by the word of the Lord so this
[59:43] is a Paul prophesied some person
[59:45] disagree with me recently and and said
[59:47] that Paul wasn't a prophet and this is
[59:49] what I mentioned Paul says this is by
[59:52] the word of the Lord I just read it
[59:54] earlier today in 1st Corinthians 7 Paul
[59:56] says this is I speaking speaking of
[59:59] marriage and divorce but then he says
[1:00:00] now this is I not the Lord and other
[1:00:03] times he says we say this by the word of
[1:00:05] the Lord so the same thing is true for
[1:00:07] our prophet brother Branham there be
[1:00:09] times he'll say his opinion but there's
[1:00:12] other times he says this is not me this
[1:00:13] is the will of the Lord and so that's
[1:00:15] how you have to operate with every
[1:00:17] prophet you have to recognize when God
[1:00:19] speaking or when man is speaking so Paul
[1:00:23] says clearly this is the word of the
[1:00:24] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[1:00:27] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:00:28] prevent them which are asleep for the
[1:00:32] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:00:34] with a shout with the voice of the
[1:00:37] Archangel and with the Trump of God
[1:00:39] there's a Trump that Paul mentioned
[1:00:41] earlier in 1st Corinthians 15:51 and 52
[1:00:45] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:00:49] so we know more about the order here
[1:00:52] dead Christians their bodies are gonna
[1:00:56] rise first before our bodies are changed
[1:00:59] and we believe if this rapture is
[1:01:03] anything this resurrection is anything
[1:01:05] like Jesus resurrection then we believe
[1:01:08] we'll see the dead in Christ rise first
[1:01:10] according to Matthew 27 the Bible said
[1:01:13] the Saints in the Old Testament that
[1:01:14] resurrected with Christ were went to the
[1:01:16] city of Jerusalem and were seen by many
[1:01:19] after Jesus's resurrection so we believe
[1:01:23] the Lord willing that we'll see the
[1:01:25] resurrected Saints now if we saw that
[1:01:30] what our faith be low or would our faith
[1:01:33] be high our faith would be extremely
[1:01:36] high and then we would feel oh this is
[1:01:39] the rapture season we would we would not
[1:01:42] only just have the word we would have
[1:01:44] spiritual supernatural experiences to
[1:01:48] base our faith upon right and so that's
[1:01:53] that's what we believe that that's what
[1:01:55] we believe will be the faith of the
[1:01:58] father's restored right because the
[1:02:01] early fathers they saw Jesus Christ
[1:02:03] resurrected to the nut they saw a dead
[1:02:06] man raised again and he was alive and he
[1:02:09] would come there in the room he
[1:02:10] disappeared he come and disappeared and
[1:02:12] that raised their faith and raised her
[1:02:15] face so much that they would be
[1:02:16] crucified for Christ so I believe our
[1:02:20] faith of our faith has to match the
[1:02:22] original Saints God will give us those
[1:02:25] same experiences we'll see the dead
[1:02:27] raised again and that will help raise
[1:02:30] our faith to produce or to be ready for
[1:02:34] the rapturing grace for the changing of
[1:02:37] a moment and a tweet coming I believe
[1:02:39] that will be part of the latter rain in
[1:02:41] other words when God's anointing is
[1:02:42] falling upon us we'll reverse ship and
[1:02:44] rejoice but we'll also because that
[1:02:46] anointing will see the dead in Christ
[1:02:48] rise as well and the reason we'll have
[1:02:52] the ability to see them is because the
[1:02:54] Holy Spirit will give us eyes to see
[1:02:56] praise God amen hallelujah so that's why
[1:02:59] Jesus said ask of me for the ice out and
[1:03:02] I'll give you that ice out praise God
[1:03:05] amen now verse 17
[1:03:10] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:03:13] be caught up together with them in the
[1:03:15] clouds to meet the Lord in the air so
[1:03:18] shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore
[1:03:21] comfort one another with these words
[1:03:24] everybody no matter how many times you
[1:03:26] heard about the rapture you ought to be
[1:03:27] comforted by hearing these words read
[1:03:29] tonight I'm comforted my children you
[1:03:32] should be comforted for a Scott because
[1:03:35] we know Christ will bring all those that
[1:03:37] were in him in the Holy Spirit baptism
[1:03:40] go bring them back with him and we'll
[1:03:42] meet them in the air and you have to
[1:03:44] worry about will I recognize them or not
[1:03:46] you won't worry about that because you
[1:03:48] will recognize them the anointing of the
[1:03:51] Holy Spirit will be upon you and that's
[1:03:53] proven in Matthew 17 because Peter James
[1:03:56] and John member went up into a mountain
[1:03:58] to pray
[1:03:59] did they wonder who was talking to Jesus
[1:04:02] or did they know right away they knew
[1:04:05] Peters like we know Lord
[1:04:06] there's Moses and Elijah did they ever
[1:04:10] see those men alive on earth no how did
[1:04:13] they know it was the anointing of the
[1:04:15] Holy Spirit let them know praise God
[1:04:18] so see we don't have to worry about
[1:04:21] anything God is the one who's gonna
[1:04:23] accomplish the rapture and isn't gonna
[1:04:25] be you and is that gonna be our effort
[1:04:26] it's gonna be God's leadership in the
[1:04:28] rapture it's gonna be God's grace in the
[1:04:30] rapture we're just going to keep walking
[1:04:32] one day at a time just like Enoch but
[1:04:34] then one of those days will be the last
[1:04:35] day that'll be the day we walk close
[1:04:38] with God God sends that latter rain and
[1:04:40] that will cause it so annoyed us to see
[1:04:43] the dead in Christ it annoyed us to be
[1:04:45] able to be ready for that last Trump so
[1:04:48] our bodies can be changed in a moment
[1:04:50] and a twinkling of an eye praise God
[1:04:53] praise God thank you Jesus so we want to
[1:04:59] be caught up together with them in the
[1:05:00] clouds and we won't have to wonder who
[1:05:03] they are we'll know who they are because
[1:05:05] Peter James and John knew them men that
[1:05:08] lived I think it was they lived 1,500
[1:05:09] years Moses was 1,500 years before
[1:05:11] Christ and Elijah was I believe nine
[1:05:13] hundred eight hundred years before
[1:05:14] Christ so there's no way Peter James and
[1:05:17] John could have known them they had have
[1:05:20] known them by the Holy Spirit praise God
[1:05:24] wonderful so now after reading these
[1:05:28] scriptures now you know who will be in
[1:05:29] the rapture there's two groups of people
[1:05:32] that will be in the rapture the dead in
[1:05:34] Christ and the living Christians the
[1:05:38] dead in Christ were the Holy Ghost field
[1:05:41] Christians who died over the past 2,000
[1:05:44] years this group is resurrected first in
[1:05:47] immortal bodies Paul said the dead shall
[1:05:50] be raised incorruptible and they rise
[1:05:52] first
[1:05:55] John correctly describes the rapture as
[1:05:57] the first resurrection because the dead
[1:06:00] in Christ are being resurrected right
[1:06:04] they're actually being resurrected from
[1:06:06] the dead the living Christians of the
[1:06:10] group Lord willing we hope to be a part
[1:06:12] of if God chooses that we live to see
[1:06:15] the rapture this group will be changed
[1:06:18] from mortal bodies to immortal they'll
[1:06:21] be like Enoch and Elijah the only two
[1:06:23] people who never had to die everybody
[1:06:26] else had to die Paul says the bodies are
[1:06:31] swallowed up in victory now this is the
[1:06:37] group that received the oil of the
[1:06:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost or eternal
[1:06:42] life during their lives and they're
[1:06:44] called wise virgins in Matthew 25 1 to
[1:06:48] 13 by Jesus Christ so those are the only
[1:06:52] two groups that will be in the rapture
[1:06:54] of the dead in Christ the dead
[1:06:55] Christians Holy Ghost field and then the
[1:06:57] living Holy Ghost field Christians and
[1:07:00] that's why the Bible calls the baptism
[1:07:04] Holy Ghost a mystery in Colossians
[1:07:06] chapter 1 verses 25 to 27
[1:07:09] he said the mystery that was hid from
[1:07:11] ages Paul calls it a mystery he said
[1:07:14] that mystery is Christ in you the hope
[1:07:16] of glory praise God now this might be
[1:07:25] shocking to some but the rest of the
[1:07:28] entire world population which is a huge
[1:07:31] population right because right now we're
[1:07:33] getting close to I think either seven or
[1:07:35] eight billion people on the earth might
[1:07:38] be closer
[1:07:38] 8.now so the rest of the world
[1:07:41] population who denied Christ as
[1:07:44] unbelievers and also along with the
[1:07:47] foolish version who didn't have the oil
[1:07:49] ready to go they'll have to suffer and
[1:07:54] die during the tribulation period or at
[1:07:57] the Battle of Armageddon and they'll
[1:08:00] miss the one thousand year millennial
[1:08:02] reign with Christ
[1:08:05] now the foolish version our virgin right
[1:08:08] to the word they they don't they don't
[1:08:12] try to marry the world they stay living
[1:08:16] a life separated unto the Word of God
[1:08:18] but they're just missing the oil they're
[1:08:21] missing the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[1:08:25] they missed that thousand-year
[1:08:27] millennium because they were foolishly
[1:08:28] avoiding getting a closer deeper walk
[1:08:32] with God they didn't want the full walk
[1:08:35] with God they stopped short of having a
[1:08:37] really deep and sincere loving walk with
[1:08:41] God revelation 20 verse 5 explains us
[1:08:45] the Bible said the rest of the Dead
[1:08:48] lived not again until the thousand years
[1:08:52] were finished that's an important major
[1:08:56] Scripture when it comes to the
[1:08:58] revelation of the the rapture the rest
[1:09:01] of the Dead lived not again until the
[1:09:04] thousand years were finished so the
[1:09:08] bodies of the rest of the world
[1:09:10] population the foolish virgin remained
[1:09:12] the graves according to Jesus and after
[1:09:17] the thousand-year millennium though be
[1:09:18] raised for their judgment at the great
[1:09:22] white throne judgment which is called
[1:09:25] the second resurrection and that's found
[1:09:30] in Matthew 25:31 246 and revelation
[1:09:33] 20:11 215 now I believe the souls of
[1:09:41] those foolish virgin go to the heavenly
[1:09:44] dimension to wait for the resurrection
[1:09:47] and I believe they go under the altar
[1:09:50] just like the
[1:09:52] saved blinded Jews go under the altar
[1:09:54] according to the fifth seal okay because
[1:09:58] we know the Jews under the altar don't
[1:10:01] do not have white robes okay which
[1:10:05] represent eternal life they can't go to
[1:10:08] hell because they lived faithful they
[1:10:10] had a testimony they had the testimony
[1:10:12] of keeping the Word of God
[1:10:14] well the foolish version has a very
[1:10:16] similar testimony they kept the Word of
[1:10:18] God they were virgin to God's Word to
[1:10:21] what they knew but they were just
[1:10:23] foolish to going further into the
[1:10:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:28] so that's where I believe the foolish
[1:10:31] virgin goes because I don't see how they
[1:10:33] can go down because Jesus took paradise
[1:10:37] up from the heart of the earth
[1:10:39] he changed paradise from Abraham's bosom
[1:10:41] the heart of the earth and I believe he
[1:10:43] took it up near the throne of God
[1:10:45] because remember in heaven there's one
[1:10:49] altar spoken of in heaven and that's the
[1:10:51] altar of incense and that's spoken of in
[1:10:55] numerous scriptures but there's one
[1:10:57] altar of incense in heaven and if
[1:10:59] there's an altar of incense then Hebrews
[1:11:01] the sixth chapter I believe says there's
[1:11:04] also a veil in heaven there's a very
[1:11:07] similar setup as it was in Moses
[1:11:10] tabernacle as there is in heaven there's
[1:11:12] an altar of incense a golden altar it's
[1:11:15] got four horns on it the Bible says and
[1:11:17] then there's a veil and then there's
[1:11:20] must be Christ's throne right there and
[1:11:23] so the Bible says our hope is behind the
[1:11:27] veil it's entered in behind the veil in
[1:11:30] the holiest in heaven so I believe by
[1:11:34] God's grace the foolish virgin and the
[1:11:37] the faithful Jew are there under the
[1:11:40] altar of incense in heaven because I do
[1:11:45] not believe they could go to hell's
[1:11:46] prison house if they're indeed virgin
[1:11:53] now let's look at as we get ready to
[1:11:56] finish up here you got about 20 more
[1:11:59] minutes by God's grace let's look at
[1:12:02] that word caught up again in 1st
[1:12:04] Thessalonians 4
[1:12:05] 17 this word supports a pre-tribulation
[1:12:10] rapture it's the Greek word harpazo
[1:12:14] which means to cease to carry off by
[1:12:17] force to claim for oneself eagerly to
[1:12:21] snatch out or away so that means the
[1:12:25] rapture is Jesus eagerly seizing or
[1:12:28] snatching away his bride his wife so
[1:12:32] that he may take these Christians to
[1:12:34] heaven or the father's Kingdom with him
[1:12:37] for a wedding in the sky followed by a
[1:12:41] marriage supper praise God
[1:12:45] so at the very same moment so
[1:12:47] simultaneously simultaneously his Christ
[1:12:50] snatches away his bride takes in the
[1:12:52] heaven the inhabitants of the earth are
[1:12:55] left behind and go through a temporary
[1:12:57] torment and judgment sudden destruction
[1:13:01] the Bible calls it for their sins in the
[1:13:04] great tribulation period for rejecting
[1:13:07] the gospel now there are six reasons let
[1:13:13] me go through these six reasons I'll
[1:13:14] just go through them quickly so the
[1:13:17] children know there's also a video on
[1:13:19] YouTube of this that I have that lays
[1:13:22] out there's six reason the rapture is
[1:13:24] pre-tribulation so let's kind of hit
[1:13:28] these and maybe just read one scripture
[1:13:29] in each one and then after that I want
[1:13:32] to show just a quick order of the
[1:13:34] rapture and then we'll be finished up
[1:13:37] here tonight by God's grace I hope
[1:13:39] you're comforted tonight praise God
[1:13:41] God's Word is such a comfort praise the
[1:13:43] Lord so the first reason the rapture has
[1:13:47] to be a pre-tribulation cuz now when we
[1:13:50] looked at the when when is it and who is
[1:13:52] it for we we looked at the who is it for
[1:13:54] now when is it it has to be before the
[1:13:57] tribulation the first reason is the
[1:14:00] Great Tribulation is described as
[1:14:01] trouble for Israel the foolish virgins
[1:14:04] and sinners but not for Holy Ghost
[1:14:07] filled Christians Holy Ghost filled
[1:14:12] Christians are already washed in the
[1:14:13] blood of Jesus Christ and do not need
[1:14:16] any purifying
[1:14:20] they don't need any purging they don't
[1:14:22] need any trouble because all their
[1:14:25] troubles have been washed away by the
[1:14:26] precious blood of Christ amen now where
[1:14:29] do we get this word trouble it's from
[1:14:31] Daniel 12:1 it literally says there's a
[1:14:35] time of trouble and notice it's for
[1:14:37] Daniel's people or thy people Israel so
[1:14:45] knowing the trouble Israel must endure
[1:14:47] teaches us Jeremiah 30 verse 7 is
[1:14:55] speaking of the same event
[1:14:57] so Daniel caught it trouble and Jeremiah
[1:14:59] calls it trouble he calls it Jacob's
[1:15:02] trouble in Jeremiah 30 verse 7 both
[1:15:08] clearly reference Israel ok Daniels
[1:15:12] people now the foolish virgin
[1:15:15] experienced trouble because there's two
[1:15:18] parables Jesus tells about Christians
[1:15:21] having trouble the first one is the
[1:15:25] foolish versions being locked out of the
[1:15:27] marriage
[1:15:27] in Jesus's parable of the the parable of
[1:15:31] the ten virgins in Matthew 25 verses 10
[1:15:34] and 12 10 11 and 12 they missed the
[1:15:38] marriage supper spoken of in revelation
[1:15:42] 19:7
[1:15:43] they missed the marriage in the parable
[1:15:45] which is the marriage supper according
[1:15:47] to revelation 19:7 because they didn't
[1:15:51] have the oil or the baptism the Holy
[1:15:54] Ghost and that's taught in a Zechariah
[1:15:56] chapter 4 where the Bible says not
[1:15:59] finding the might not by power but by my
[1:16:01] spirit saith the Lord how are those two
[1:16:04] olive trees causing the light to burn it
[1:16:07] was through the oil and God said that's
[1:16:09] my spirit saith the Lord a second
[1:16:14] parable is Matthew 22 verses 10 through
[1:16:17] 13 it describes those invited to a
[1:16:20] marriage but don't have a wedding
[1:16:23] garment which represents the Holy Ghost
[1:16:26] baptism because Jesus said you'll be
[1:16:29] clothed or endued with power in Lu
[1:16:33] 24:49 and noticed these without the the
[1:16:37] wedding garment are cast into outer
[1:16:39] darkness with weeping and gnashing of
[1:16:41] teeth
[1:16:42] that has to be the tribulation period so
[1:16:47] C so the tribulation is trouble for
[1:16:51] Israel and now we've seen two scriptures
[1:16:53] where it's trouble for the foolish
[1:16:55] virgin that didn't have the born-again
[1:16:56] experience sinners get the most trouble
[1:17:00] because Jude 1:15 says the tribulation
[1:17:03] is going to execute judgment upon all
[1:17:05] that's Jude 1:15 so it's a great time of
[1:17:12] trouble it's a great time of judgment
[1:17:15] executed upon the unbeliever reason
[1:17:20] number two there's no mention of
[1:17:22] Christ's bride or church in the Great
[1:17:25] Tribulation text in the book of
[1:17:27] Revelation the word church appears 19
[1:17:30] times in Revelation but it's absent from
[1:17:34] revelation 3:20 2 - revelation 22:16 the
[1:17:39] the church is not mentioned in
[1:17:41] revelation 8 during the four trumpets or
[1:17:43] revelation 9 during the fifth and sixth
[1:17:46] trumpets and the first woe when the
[1:17:51] second woe passes in revelation 11 the
[1:17:53] bride is not mentioned during the final
[1:17:56] harvest of Revelation 14 there's no
[1:17:59] mention of the bride there's no mention
[1:18:01] of the bride in Revelation 15 and 16
[1:18:03] when the seven last plagues and seven
[1:18:05] last vials are poured out the reason
[1:18:10] Christ's bride is not mentioned in those
[1:18:12] tribulation texts is because she's with
[1:18:14] her bridegroom Jesus Christ in heaven
[1:18:17] enjoying the three and a half years of
[1:18:19] the marriage supper of the Lamb thank
[1:18:23] God for that
[1:18:24] the next time the bride is seen in the
[1:18:26] book of Revelation once she's seen a
[1:18:32] couple times she's seen in Revelation 10
[1:18:35] but she's still doing her earthly
[1:18:37] ministry she's seen in revelation 6 with
[1:18:41] the first four seals because she's got
[1:18:44] the anointing of the first
[1:18:45] I was heard of the four beasts yeah that
[1:18:47] surround the throne of God but after
[1:18:49] those times the next time she's seen is
[1:18:52] in Revelation 19 verses 5 to 21
[1:18:55] she is the army that's riding white
[1:18:58] horses behind God's own son who is the
[1:19:02] leading one right there at the Battle of
[1:19:05] Armageddon which takes place at the very
[1:19:09] end of the Great Tribulation Period
[1:19:13] reason number 3 the brighter true church
[1:19:15] is specifically promised a pardon from
[1:19:18] God's divine wrath we already read that
[1:19:20] in 1st Thessalonians 5:9 there's
[1:19:26] numerous other scriptures all of them
[1:19:28] point to Jesus's bride escaping wrath so
[1:19:36] the other scriptures that say that our
[1:19:38] first Estonian is 5 4 1st Thessalonians
[1:19:40] 1:10 Romans 5:9 revelation 3:10 all of
[1:19:48] those scriptures say that the true
[1:19:50] church escapes wrath and tribulation
[1:19:53] thank God for that
[1:19:55] Luke 21:36 says the same will be
[1:19:59] accounted worthy to escape all those
[1:20:01] things that shall come to pass David
[1:20:05] also says will escape he said in the
[1:20:07] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:20:10] pavilion and the secret of his
[1:20:13] tabernacle he shall hide me and set me
[1:20:15] up upon a rock the word wrath is used 13
[1:20:25] times in Revelation and each time it's
[1:20:28] connected to the great tribulation text
[1:20:31] listed under the second reason brother
[1:20:39] Branham uses the symbolism of a physical
[1:20:43] husband like myself with a physical
[1:20:45] husband like myself ever put my wife
[1:20:48] through a time of purging or great
[1:20:50] persecution in order just so we could be
[1:20:53] married of course not that's because
[1:20:56] she's already found grace in my sight
[1:20:58] already love her already know she's as a
[1:21:01] pure heart so it is with Jesus Christ
[1:21:03] his bride is already washed in his blood
[1:21:06] through repentance and sanctification
[1:21:08] the batson Holy Ghost she doesn't need
[1:21:11] to go through a tribulation period to be
[1:21:12] purged or go through trouble because
[1:21:15] she's already confessed her sins all the
[1:21:17] wrath of Christ has passed and she
[1:21:20] stands before her husband with no
[1:21:22] condemnation because she is in Christ
[1:21:25] Jesus she's already found favor in his
[1:21:28] sight the Bible causes a glorious church
[1:21:31] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:21:33] thing in Ephesians 5:20 7 praise God
[1:21:38] we're called blameless harmless without
[1:21:41] rebuke in Philippians 2:15 Jesus blood
[1:21:45] forgives all of our trespasses in
[1:21:47] Colossians 2:13 hallelujah Christ wife
[1:21:51] has no condemnation and no man shall lay
[1:21:53] anything to the charge of God's elect
[1:21:55] corner Romans 8:1 and 833 Christ bride
[1:22:02] is the wife of his own choosing and
[1:22:05] Christ chooses a bride who is blameless
[1:22:07] without spot wrinkle or blemish praise
[1:22:11] God that got 10 minutes left here and
[1:22:13] I'll finish up here reason for the
[1:22:24] true churches foreshadowed to receive a
[1:22:26] pardon from God's divine wrath we see
[1:22:35] three examples of this Enoch who is
[1:22:38] namings dedicated in Hebrew was raptured
[1:22:43] and he didn't taste death the Bible said
[1:22:48] he walked with God he was not for God
[1:22:51] took him he was the seventh generation
[1:22:54] from Adam
[1:22:55] which is a type of the seventh Gentile
[1:22:59] church age called the Laodicean Church
[1:23:01] in Revelation chapter 3 so like Enoch
[1:23:05] escaped the wrath of the flood of Noah's
[1:23:09] day so will the seventh church age
[1:23:12] escape the destruction the worldwide
[1:23:14] destruction of fire won't be water this
[1:23:17] time it'll be fire this time alright now
[1:23:32] there's two other scriptures that speak
[1:23:34] up believers escaping the wrath of God
[1:23:36] Noah escaped the wrath of God and then
[1:23:40] lot escaped the right wrath of God so we
[1:23:45] see all righteous people escape the
[1:23:50] wrath of God another parable of Jesus oh
[1:23:59] yeah the parable rear efference of jesus
[1:24:02] shows that we escaped the wrath of God
[1:24:05] as well if we have the wedding garment
[1:24:09] according the parable of the wedding
[1:24:11] garment we escape the outer darkness and
[1:24:18] then the parable of the ten virgins we
[1:24:21] escape the trouble or the the
[1:24:26] tribulation of being outside the
[1:24:28] marriage house in Matthew chapter 25 as
[1:24:31] well okay
[1:24:32] reason number five almost ever two more
[1:24:35] to go Jesus and Paul taught the rapture
[1:24:37] was
[1:24:37] eminent at an unknown day just like an
[1:24:40] approaching thief so in other words we
[1:24:45] don't know the day or the hour but all
[1:24:46] the other views can could calculate the
[1:24:50] exact day where it might take place
[1:24:54] Jesus taught this on four occasions and
[1:24:57] Paul taught it twice Jesus said no man
[1:25:00] knows the day or the hour no not the
[1:25:02] Angels but my father only
[1:25:06] later in the same chapter Christ said
[1:25:08] this that if the good man of the house
[1:25:11] had known in what watch the thief would
[1:25:13] come he would have watched it would not
[1:25:15] have suffered his house to be broken up
[1:25:16] therefore be ye ready for in such hour
[1:25:20] as you think not the Son of man cometh
[1:25:23] that means we must make every hour an
[1:25:25] hour where we think the Lord may come
[1:25:28] back that will make us ready for the
[1:25:31] coming of the Lord Matthew 25:13 is
[1:25:42] another one where Jesus says watch you
[1:25:44] therefore for you know neither the day
[1:25:46] nor the hour wherein the Son of man
[1:25:48] cometh in Revelation 3:3 jesus says if
[1:25:51] therefore thou shalt not watch I will
[1:25:54] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[1:25:56] not know what hour I will come upon thee
[1:25:59] so that's quite striking five times
[1:26:01] Jesus says that we don't know the day or
[1:26:04] the hour meaning we have to be ready at
[1:26:06] all times
[1:26:09] Paul twice says Christ comes as a thief
[1:26:12] in the night
[1:26:13] first Thessalonians 5 verses 2 & 3 part
[1:26:17] 2 through 4 Paul says it twice that he
[1:26:20] comes as a thief now the mid tribulation
[1:26:25] which is a false view of the rapture and
[1:26:27] the post tribulation rapture which is
[1:26:32] another false one they could potentially
[1:26:34] count or number the day of Christ's
[1:26:37] coming the mid Tribulation Period could
[1:26:41] just count 1260 days in order to figure
[1:26:48] out when the rapture would be because
[1:26:49] that would be the halfway point of
[1:26:51] in your period and of course the post
[1:26:55] tribulation people would have to double
[1:26:58] that to have seven years of days and if
[1:27:01] they counted all those days then they
[1:27:02] could know the day of Christ's coming
[1:27:07] see the rapture must remain a secret for
[1:27:09] two reasons
[1:27:10] Satan could do great damage if he knew
[1:27:13] the timing of Jesus's Second Coming just
[1:27:18] think about the awful things they did
[1:27:20] the Devils did at Jesus first coming
[1:27:24] they knew the time of his first coming
[1:27:26] so what did they do
[1:27:27] they anointed Herod and he slew all
[1:27:29] those poor precious Hebrew boys right
[1:27:33] from two years old under so that's why
[1:27:36] Jesus has to hide that day an hour from
[1:27:39] Satan because Satan could do great
[1:27:40] damage he would try to stop people from
[1:27:43] being raptured and secondly a seeker
[1:27:49] rapture reveals good and evil hearts
[1:27:52] according to Jesus's own words he said a
[1:27:55] good faithful wise servant will be ready
[1:27:58] for the rapture and he'll be serving
[1:27:59] spiritual meat in due season but the
[1:28:02] evil serpent
[1:28:03] or evil servant rather he behaves as
[1:28:07] though the raptures delayed he starts
[1:28:09] getting into it we call a spiritually
[1:28:11] drunken state so a real Christian has
[1:28:16] the love of God in their hearts
[1:28:18] motivating them to be ready at any time
[1:28:20] or season for Christ's company all right
[1:28:23] in the last one here before we do the
[1:28:24] order the sixth reason the rapture is
[1:28:27] the removal of the grace of God for
[1:28:30] Gentiles in preparation for the
[1:28:32] Antichrist and this has taught multiple
[1:28:36] scriptures Romans 11 mostly teaches this
[1:28:39] and second Thessalonians 2 2 to 13 so
[1:28:48] let me stop there because I need a
[1:28:50] couple minutes here to go through the
[1:28:52] order by God's grace I'll stop there but
[1:28:56] let's look at one more scripture one
[1:28:59] more little order here so here's the
[1:29:02] order brother Jose asked me to preach
[1:29:03] this and I hope
[1:29:05] this is the right one brother Jose if
[1:29:07] not forgive me and let me know which one
[1:29:08] it was
[1:29:10] now here's what brother Ram says in who
[1:29:15] is this Melchizedek he said therefore
[1:29:17] the theophany if you have died and
[1:29:20] entered in that theophany speaking the
[1:29:21] dead in Christ he says what happens the
[1:29:24] theophany comes down to the earth to
[1:29:27] pick up the Redeem body so that when the
[1:29:32] dead in Christ rise first they rise
[1:29:34] because that theophany comes down and it
[1:29:36] picks up that glorified body but the
[1:29:39] glorified body is the dead body of the
[1:29:41] saints that was swallowed up in life so
[1:29:43] it's a resurrected life but then that
[1:29:46] theophan has to come down and meet the
[1:29:48] glorified body and then those with the
[1:29:52] three bodies the dead in Christ now
[1:29:53] alive in Christ they'll rise right we'll
[1:29:56] see them but that happens first
[1:29:59] the theophanies have to come down to get
[1:30:01] the glorified and the natural body
[1:30:03] that's now swallowed up in the glorified
[1:30:05] body that's the first thing that happens
[1:30:08] he says and then if you're here in the
[1:30:11] air you take the body to meet the
[1:30:14] theophany
[1:30:15] there you are and caught up to meet the
[1:30:18] Lord in the air so I'll just go real
[1:30:21] slow as I close here first Christ
[1:30:25] descends from heaven the Bible said the
[1:30:28] Lord himself shall descend in 1st
[1:30:30] Thessalonians 4:16 so the Lord himself
[1:30:32] shall descend and first the dead in
[1:30:36] Christ rise first there theophanies
[1:30:39] descend and they join up with the
[1:30:43] physical body and the glorified body of
[1:30:47] course the glorified swallows of the
[1:30:48] physical first and then the theophany
[1:30:51] and glorified all unite into one body
[1:30:55] and then Lord willing we'll see them in
[1:30:57] our physical bodies right and then we'll
[1:30:59] stop seeing them because they'll race
[1:31:01] with Jesus in the air and then the Bible
[1:31:05] says at the last Trump
[1:31:07] now that Trump already sounded rights
[1:31:09] because that's when the dead in Christ
[1:31:10] rise after we see them we which alive
[1:31:14] and remain shall be changed in a moment
[1:31:17] and caught up to meet the Lord in the
[1:31:19] air so our physical bodies get swallowed
[1:31:23] up in a glorified body so we'll go from
[1:31:26] feeling tired and maybe you know worn
[1:31:28] out or something instantly having a
[1:31:30] brand new body no more pain and then
[1:31:32] this glorified body will rise to meet
[1:31:36] our theophany in the air praise God and
[1:31:44] once that happens the scripture will be
[1:31:48] fulfilled death will be swallowed up in
[1:31:51] life and then first Thessalonians 4:17
[1:31:53] comes the past so shall we ever be with
[1:31:56] the Lord praise God remember there's
[1:32:01] three kinds of bodies there's
[1:32:02] terrestrial or flesh bodies the ones we
[1:32:04] haven't see now this is called the earth
[1:32:06] the house of our tabernacle there's the
[1:32:08] second theophany body which is called a
[1:32:11] celestial body it's waiting for us it's
[1:32:14] an eternal body waiting in the heavens
[1:32:16] it's a house not made with hands and
[1:32:19] it's our house from heaven yet it
[1:32:23] doesn't eat it's a very similar to an
[1:32:24] angelic body that the Angels have and
[1:32:28] then the third body is a glorified body
[1:32:31] which is this body glorified or made
[1:32:35] eternal or perfect and then that
[1:32:38] glorified body can eat and drink as well
[1:32:41] just like Jesus's body could eat fish
[1:32:43] after his resurrection and brother
[1:32:47] Branham says through those three bodies
[1:32:51] so once you have the understanding of
[1:32:52] those bodies he says we see plainly
[1:32:55] through those bodies you plainly see the
[1:32:58] complete secret of our lives not in
[1:33:02] journey and death and where we go after
[1:33:06] we die
[1:33:07] so those three bodies tell the whole
[1:33:09] story of our lives
[1:33:11] physical body right theophany waiting
[1:33:15] but then this body's got to be swallowed
[1:33:17] up in a glorified and meet that
[1:33:20] theophany and then those three bodies
[1:33:21] combine to one and then we are ever with
[1:33:24] the Lord so that's such a beautiful
[1:33:28] quote there he says the state
[1:33:30] ages of eternal purpose he had in a
[1:33:33] secret has now been revealed these three
[1:33:38] stages of our bodies what a great
[1:33:40] revelation and we'll stop right there so
[1:33:43] children let's stand here let's that
[1:33:53] word prayer here Heavenly Father Lord we
