[Music] in spite of the store [Music] [Music] the race of gods could be back in the house of Lord with all the saints had a wonderful time this morning and appreciate everybody's patience you know we start a little later I try not to preach two hours tonight okay I got to crazy there's such a great wonderful presence of the Lord and so great to have such a wonderful time worshiping the Lord I trust the Lord spoke to your heart and trust he'll do the same for us here tonight I like to go to a strange text first chronicles 18 I like to preach a just a little maybe see a little thought but it's I haven't really had all the time I wanted to vote to it but I almost want to start it I want to preach on garrisoned by prayer I just want to look at prayer and fasting a little bit tonight by God's grace and I've got this you know from a quote from brother Branham in 1961 which I'll read in just a moment but years ago I preached this little thought how Joshua and Israel didn't possess all the land God had actually promised them and judges chapter 1 says because God was going to use the rows remaining inhabitants to prove Israel but then later some 800 years later David he finally through all of his victories he finally possesses the full land and when he does he sets up Garrison's and then brother Branham says these represent prayer so let's read first chronicles 18 verse 6 so we see David you know brother Branham said it types Christ you know David types Christ Salomon types the Millenium so here David is on such a role as far as such a string of victories because of his obedience to the Lord verse 6 then David put Garrison's in Syria Damascus and the Syrians became David's servants and brought gifts thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went so see how these Garrison's provided him protection praise God let's have a word of Prayer here mean on your heart just make it known unto God Heavenly Father Lord we just bow our heads one more time in your divine presence we wherever two or three gathered there you are in our midst we're thankful that you're here Lord here tonight my promise help us to recognize your presence Lord God yours revealed in simplicity help us to see the simplicity Lord of your word tonight and father list let your presence be felt that our hearts be change and Lord molded to be more like you fed strength and encouraged edified for the glory of God let your kingdom continue to grow in our arm it's Lord God in our lives and each person find their position Lord God as we've been laboring on these thoughts and father will give you all the glory in Jesus Christ name the church said Amen god bless should be in seated praise God I think I'll start with this quotation here and well then we'll move on from there by God's grace this is from Revelation chapter 4 part 3 it's a 1961 so he says he's I'd have to do a interpreter here tonight so I go a little faster here Jose did a great job brother thank you sir a great job appreciate you we'll see if this continues how we might be working together for a little bit here you don't know you're gonna resign a great job great job sir brother Branham says in 1961 he said and God he's praying as I go out yonder in the field to face the foe may I realize that I'm garrisoned every hour by prayer and I just struck me I have this I've had this quote laying in my notes for like years I want to preach on that one I want to preach on that one time and so I preached it up in Albion you know a few weeks ago at the Labor Day meetings and it was a real blessing and so I kind of want to bring it here you should I preached everything here first but I just kind of added it in there wasn't in my notes it just kind of was added in there the Holy Spirit kind of brought to my memory but I think I could spend a lot more time on it here of course he said oh he said may I realize I'm Garrison every hour by prayer oh how I depend on that garrison notice he depends upon it he's got to have this the enemy approaching but know that the garrison hold because mothers know so who he says here who's praying for him mothers and fathers and boys and girls Christians born-again with the experience heaven bound people is on their knees praying Oh God give deliverance amen beautiful huh in that glorious and father we pray we pray that you'll let us get out into the enemy's lines out yonder and conquer every precious soul he said that's waiting do Lord and bring them out of darkness into light for we ask it in Jesus name Amen in that beautiful quote when I first heard that years ago that just struck me as when I was preaching on the revelation seers well I'm still not done with it but I'm still on it but I just want to bring out a few things out of here how brother Graham likens Garrison's unto prayer now as I mentioned just briefly you you remember that where Joshua didn't possess everything because God had held him back and we know that Joshua crossing over into the promised land represents the the book of Acts church it represents believers today right we God saves us out of Egypt and we come through the waters of the Red Sea praise God and we see all of our addictions and all of our love for the world we see them all drowned in the blood of Christ amen and then we come out into the hot scorching wilderness of sanctification to prove us whether we will possess the land or not whether we'll believe it or not and then the leadership of the word the word goes before us right God leads us over Jordan and leads us to possess the promised land amen and we know bro BAM said that Joshua of course types out Ephesians right so it's the modern so our modern church is the the anti-type of Joshua praise God and there there's was of course a natural possession as well but it typed that what's what's going on spiritually today praise God and so knowing that I want to bring up a few more scriptures here I and I didn't really I guess I didn't have time to put them all together but what happened was they overcame Jericho right they defeated Jericho and then after that they went to AI and then you know the story Bri you know kind of vaguely how they spent years fighting and then after a while Caleb stood up and said it's time to possess the land praise God we been fighting we've been driving these guys out but now it's time for me I've been fighting for everybody else now it's time for me to possess the Promised Land and then he did that at 85 years old so if you get a little older don't feel bad you got victories ahead of you a man like Brendan was telling me her life's been changed amen so she's been seen a lot of great victories in her life by God's grace and that's what we all want to see we all want to see God helping us overcome praise God and then we know of course you know that they got established in Joshua and and then all the saints after that come out but finally pretty soon they got a prophet and a king right with Samuel and Saul and then they got a David praise got a man after God's own heart praise God and bro man that course symbolizes that with Christ and brother man talks about how you know David's mighty men knew he was coming into power praise God and how we know Christ is coming into power hallelujah amen of course it's not all it's not a perfect type you know but we just see that we see that the symbolism there in other words we're fighting for Jesus Christ amen his kingdom is going to expand to every last Soul as we saw in Wednesday night it's not gonna fill the earth in fact it's gonna get smaller and smaller the Roman Catholic Church and the daughters are gonna fill the earth there that's that grain of mustardseed parable Jesus told but ours is gonna grow in the sense that it's gonna get it's gonna go all the way around the world to get every last predestinated seed in other words every child of God is gonna possess his land every child of God is going to be born again and then when that happens then it's time for the transition over to Solomon over to the Golden Age praise God amen thank the Lord for that the Golden Age a time of peace praise God and Solomon did have peace as long as he loved the Lord of course that's where we know that after we started loving the women in his older days that's when he started falling away in building houses of idolatry so I just you to see a few things here let's go to proverbs 25 28 I just want to I just want to start with this because I feel like this is a message for mature Christians this isn't for beginners when we talk about prayer and fasting this isn't for beginners it's for mature Christians that are borned again and I think you'll see as we go along and look at some of these scriptures I think you'll see that that's true proverbs 25 28 Thank You Lydia wonderful he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls now I just want you to see the symbolism here a city let's say Jerusalem right you know Nehemiah Ezra servable they had to rebuild the wall around the city of course that's not the same time as we're talking now but I'm just using it as an example when they came back the first thing they did was rebuild the house of God so they could sacrifice and it wasn't until years later that they finally built the wall right so so symbolically they got to build up christ-like character and here Solomon of all people of all people talking about self-control which he lost later on alive mercy of course he didn't have access to the Holy Ghost so I'm not I'm not degrading him or anything like that but just it's striking the person who wrote about it fell from it and in other words we want to live and practice what we preach we've got to be faithful we have we have more responsibility because those seals have been loosed we know and so he's likening unto a wall around a city as self-control and that's temperance which is on the Statue of a perfect man right faith virtue knowledge temperance it's a four step so the Bible likens when you can build a life of self control where you crucify the the passions of your flesh the Bible likens to that now your city has walls but but you still got a huge country Ezreal still had miles and miles and miles of country where enemies can seep in are you with me where invaders can slip through the backdoor right they can they can encroach upon the land and so that's what I want you to see this is what I mean by I think you again you you but that you're but you're going there you're building up a life of character where now you've got faith virtue and knowledge now you've got temperance now you've got self-control and it's like a wall around your home city or your capital right it's a wall around your your soul we'd say you know you got self-control because the Bible says if you can't rule over it it's like your walls are broken down praise God and if I like what the Bible says I like how the Bible picks it up in the Old Testament I forget which prophet it was but the Bible said that the God's Spirit would be like a fire a wall of fire around his people praise God amen hallelujah which represents a greater fortification a greater protection God's own spirit protecting his people praise God the fire of the Holy Ghost amen so there's a great sea I haven't really fully developed that thought I'd like to study on that a little more and so we see that that that a wall around the city is a great achievement remember the people rejoice and in Ezra's day in Nehemiah they rejoice they shouted some of them wet because you know that wasn't as big the temple wasn't as big but but when they got the wall built all the enemies were astonished mother did that quickly that's what we rejoice in when we see God do a great work amongst us praise God God will save somebody clean them up film what the Holy Ghost and just go like that what a great work of God amen maybe it took us no longer maybe took them a little shorter but it just goes to show how quickly God can get somebody's life in order praise God look at the Apostle Paul nah he was hating Christians the next week he's filled with the Holy Ghost my through I think was three days later when it because he was blind for three days praying and fasting and then he gets the Holy Ghost he said arise received thy sight be baptized and received the Holy Ghost not mine within four days we've three days three days afterwards he's already got the Holy Ghost God does a quick and mighty work amen B a short quick work we know for the rapture to thank the Lord but now if you are gonna expand your territory then take more battles more victory I think that's what we're singing our lives right as time goes on as the world gets darker we've got to be able to fight like brother Bram said that quote we've got to be able to fight to go out there and challenge the enemy to possess more land how many want to possess more of the land in your life like you feel like there's like I'm sure Jose feels that bang oh no no no you brothers sisters feel like there's more for me to do there's there's more to like we saw the quote last week life is more than just going to work and coming home it's even more than just coming to church and go back home there's greater things about it as far as saving souls seeing the sick healed let us sing God change people's hearts do great things amen there could be nothing greater than saving a soul praise God and that's what we want to see but we know of course you know Jesus had a few there be that find at the end time we know there be fewer and fewer but we can't let that discourage us we've still got to be able to be warriors and go out there and fight against the enemy praise God I like that quote that's why I think that was such a special quote let me just read that again real quick so it's all my mind you'll let us I pray you let us guard the enemy's lines and conquer every precious soul that's waiting amen hallelujah so now the garrison as you've seen the time of David now he sets them up so garrison symbolizes the protective favor or the hand of the Lord it's more than where I can control myself not to worry about you know lusting after this or struggle with that or my my mouth get me in trouble so much I mean you got that you know you yeah that's the wall around the city but this garrison represents you have protection on your entire borders praise God which Joshua didn't have that they didn't have the privilege of that right even in the life of some of the Saints here let me look at the Old Testament here even life of some of the old Saints it was a great thing when Jonathan started conquering the Philistines remember that let's read it us go to 1st Samuel 13 verse 3 it was a great thing see the Philistines were kind of defeating the Israel right they were kind of they they were they were overpowering them right it was a great thing when Jonathan starts fighting for God in God's name right fighting for Israel and God's name and he starts getting victories by defeating Philistine Garrison's right because they were they would had moved in and encamped in on God's inheritance that land wasn't the Philistines that was the Israelites land amen in other words we can say like this your health is your land amen your good health that's part of your inheritance amen I mean so like this this is the most important one you're lost loved ones that's your inheritance ain't ahead hallelujah and the enemy will move in or maybe you're born that way that it was already moved in and it's our job by the grace of God to go out and push back to Garrison's right to increase the land or to possess all of our inheritance hey like my band prayed and souls that are in prison now remember he was praying and pleading with Lord expand your Hara Tori praise God and let us see our family serving the Lord hallelujah now I says Jonathan smoke the garrison of Philistines that was in chiba or giba and the Philistines heard of it and saw blew the trumpet throughout the land saying let the Hebrews hear praise God now he does this a a number of times here's another one let's go to chapter 14 verse 6 yeah this whole chapter is about this where he Jonathan sneaks in with his armor-bearer and they defeat some Garrison's of the Philistines and then Saul takes all the credit you know how he was he just saw he would he wanted the people happy you know or he wanted the love of the people instead of David a little bit of encouragement he was kind of jealous verse 6 and Jonathan said to the man that bear his armor come and let us go over unto the garrison these uncircumcised it may be that the Lord will work for us for there's no restraint I love this to the Lord to say by many or few Amen what a revelation this guy had he said we know we're call of God to fight against these Philistines and he said perhaps God will deliver us in or deliver them into our hand because it doesn't matter to God the numbers God's not looking at the natural numbers God's looking at his will amen God's looking at what is he doing right now amen and so we know he gets the victory praise the Lord hallelujah and he actually gets the revelation in verse 12 yeah the revelation comes there in verse 12 14 12 and the men of the garrison answered Jonathan his armor barbers had come up to us and we will show you a thing and Jonathan said in his armor armor bear come up after me for the LORD hath deliver them into the hand of Israel oh my in that glorious that's what we want to see we want to see the Lord deliver our loved ones from the enemy praise God we want to see oh it's God's will to save this loved one it's God's will to heal this sick one amen and we want to see the the land possessed because it's our possession it's our inheritance praise God and so that's where this is such a beautiful picture here of God's people starting to get to those outer realms and possessing all that God has for them amen amen now in other words like we said last Sunday that we can know God's will for our life and I only know it but do it because the anointed ones the end times in Matthew 7 they knew the will of God they just didn't do it and so Jesus says I never knew you so see the only way to know God is to know his possessions for you and actually achieve and and possess all that God has for you that's the only way you know God amen is to do his will praise God oh that's beautiful amen hallelujah yeah there's parallel passages here I'll just read them 2nd Samuel 8 6 I guess the day you can put it up there remember the Bible said church this Bible said how it's gonna go be encouraged he said step by step little by little you'll take the land amen brother bang we've been at this for 13 years let's keep going brother little by little we'll take this land right amen little by little ain't gonna be an easy thing but it's gonna be constant battles constant prayers right you some garrison my prayer amen I'm protected by prayers and what's keeping me what's keeping you is our prayers one for another praise God amen second Samuel 86 then Dave would put Garrison's in Syria of Damascus and the Syrians became servants to David and brought gifts and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went now it repeats in verse 14 second samuel 8:14 and he put Garrison's and eat them throughout all eat them see not look he's starting to possess the other land see Edom he's starting to drive out I mean starting to go into other territories possess those territories throughout all Edom put he Garrison's and all they have eaten became david servants and the Lord preserve David with herself with her server he went I Got News for if you don't know a church but right here is your Edom right here praise God don't you want to push out push out all the all the slavery of the flesh praise God and be truly devoted and say like this so your ministry your personal ministry as we pass out that paper whatever may be your personal ministry can reach its full it's the fullness of its fruitfulness can say like that so you can reach your fruitfulness remember the foolish virgin doesn't really produce any fruit for God it's only that last kind of heart and they'll produce thirtyfold sixtyfold or a hundredfold only those who are born again with honest and seer sincere hearts will bring forth fruit unto God hey man so see as the bride of Jesus Christ with the revelation of the word we should also seek God for the revelation of his will for our lives the ministries for our lives that we can do all that God has for us to praise God and we can see fruitfulness in our lives think about that as some of those scriptures that we are I put on the sheet here you remember when Tabitha died those women were so sad but they came up and going Peter look at these clothes he did what a testimony mine she just look at what a mighty testimony look how many look all the hours she invests in clothing the poor see even though she'd pass they're still testifying look at the memorials of her life praise God look at all the people this is just proof see she devotes she put her hands to work clothing people that didn't have any clothes and God thought so much that he said I'm gonna raise her from the dead Peter get them all out of here raise this woman from the dead he said get up Tabitha as he got up amen get up see she had she had more did she must have more to do for the kingdom of God and that was part of ministry now that the beautiful part of that too is that Peter had seen Jesus do that oh that's what good that's what's good for us if we see God do a miracle like like we've seen before if we've seen God do America that we should learn from it whether it's through us or not and then the next time it comes up we should be able to be victorious in that one that in that way like the one time I was in Guyana I was gonna go pray for this dear woman and she fell down before I could get to her and I was all confused she actually hit her head on a chair as she fell and I thought mine that doesn't seem to be the Lord but I didn't know better so I just everyone was rejoicing but I was like okay well I just go down and pray for anyway and as soon as I did she started fighting and pushing against me because that was a demon that did that the demon didn't want me to lay hands on her so I learned the next time so I learned from that I come back and preach at Albion a few years or a year or two after that and the same thing happened with a man John Graham was right there he could tell you about he was right there I went to lay my hands on this woman and pray for and she fell down and I thought oh I know that's that devil that's that trick of the devil I've seen that before and as soon as I went to I can still see you in my mind because I went to pray for her she was laying flat on her back she started kicking and punching like that but I just I just found a way to put my arm on her head on her shoulder something started praying and pretty soon it all passed by and she rose up happy and and that demon was cast out by God's grace was he learning from that learning from these situations is is what we need to do praise God so Peter learned from that how Jesus raised the person from the dead the Jairus daughter so he applied that now to Tabitha now that's what we need don't we we need to have experiences with God learn and then be able to work it out ourselves the next time in other words we need to grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord praise the Lord so hope that's a good example I always try to think of examples in my life where I've learned some of these things because I don't want to preach about things I don't know who I want to preach about things that I know praise God I know it's the literal truth of God all right so again we see the Lord is preserving David wherever he went so that's why I said when when we are establishing a very consistent prayer life then the Bible said it's God's preservation it's God's protection it's kind of the hedge that God put around job he must have been so faithful right all those memory you prayed for his children if something happened god forbid if anything would happen here's a sacrifice for them god if anything should happen and it's a good thing he did it too right and so see it was like a hedge and and because of his faithfulness got it honor that that faithfulness and he put a hedge around that well that's what we see garrison should be but a man realized the only success I have is because people are praying at Garrison's for me amen there's a garrison in Jeffersonville maybe there's a garrison in Arkansas there's a garrison not in Florida there's all these Garrison's and they're just their soldiers who at their posts of duty ready to fight off any enemy and ready to pray for the success of God's army amen hallelujah now the easiest way or the simplest way we can apply that is just to pray for our services pray for our the people here yes we want to extend that many a Wednesday night I'll pray for all the pastor's I know I'll pray for brother Brooks on a Wednesday night brother Jim schumake you know for the cam I'll pray for all the pastor's brother Samuel brother Randy I'll pray for all the pastor's I don't know why but on Wednesday night I always think of those brothers now what is it it's it's me and it's you as we pray together it's us at our outpost and our garrison spot and we have a duty to stand there and protect God's servants amen God's people praise the Lord so see this gear represents the favor the protection you might even say the hedge of the Lord brother Ram said he needed it every hour of his life amen praise God so see this garrison is more when we have a garrison a prayer it's more than just like well I don't smoke anymore I don't cuss anymore I don't do pornography anymore it's more than that that's just that's temperance that's a great thing that's a wall around the city but we're talking about expanding God's blessing over our lives so it reaches the very outskirts the very extent of our lives so we achieve all the fruitfulness amen that we achieve all that God wants us to achieve amen ha the news like I love what the Bible said that David did all the will of God for his generation amen except the one thing with Bathsheba and Uriah everything else he fulfilled all of it see because he was a man after God's own heart amen so now with Garrison's numb there's there's only 19 scriptures about Garrison's but that's the that's the main idea I want to get across is that they symbolize Israel reaching the but the God ordained boundaries for their lives gonna say like that like I wrestled with us all the time but I just trust God's gonna give me a revelation is is having a small church is that the is that the predestinated boundary of my life if it is I'm happy with that I've been here for 13 and a half years I'm happy there but I just wonder in my mind that's something I need to seek the Lord on Lord is this the boundary or is there a zero is there more for us now there can be more like spiritually but I just mean like more like bigger because that's how the American mind goes right and so see you probably wonder the same you know what is the extent of my life like brother Graham always had that desire right but the Jose to go out west you know you know there's just more to my life I just feel like there's more there's something more than I need to do in my life and eventually God's gracious hand let him out last amen to meet the angels send him back to preach the seals and then send him back out amen and he met his destiny in the West - to receive the king so the true revelation of God's Word amen and that he was given that not so you could just talk about it but he could live by it Amen he said this is the sword that I live by oh god help us to live by this sword amen see then he reached the extent or the fullness of God's assignment for him can I say like that it was so striking when he was telling me this - then at other churches that she's visited their preaching on being in your position right there preaching and I've been preaching on that for like six months well nine months actually nine months I started it on New Year's Eve night 2018 and I watched a sermon I watched a sermon this week I thought you'd be interested of her brother from Uganda remember I told you about the revival in Uganda brother Nathan Erickson told me about that remember that he said hundreds of thousands well I thought I forgot about it but I saw a preacher at Bissell church this week and he preached on God's purpose for your life I'm like huh I have to tell Mindy that hey so seem like got it but anyways he said God he's got you know a strong accent but it's really good English he said he is pastor we're not past but he's overseer of over a hundred churches like God has just take the message and it is exploding in Uganda right now a church here Church and then pretty soon it's just exploding out there amen oh the harvest is plentiful amen so you got to pray for those laborers amen you know we're hearing this we're listen now if you picture us spiritually we're in this barren wasteland you know where we're like that one little outpost garrison you know in this it's all just spiritual wasteland but over there I mean the fields are white or white with harvest and those brothers walk in there and brother amen they bring him in by the scores you know here's twenty songs here and he's now as an apostle over over a hundred churches and they and they do ministers meetings he was saying that and they teaching the message - they don't have any message book they're all you know Pentecostals or a former Pentecostals or Methodists in that amazing like God is God is doing all these great things thank God that we get to hear about it because it's an encouragement so over here like my is there any when is the rapture and they're like there's tons of souls that need to hear Christ before the rapture can happen they're like Maggie there's many more all out there we're like we're like when is he gonna come he might wait a while and see but we've got to be faithful and do our part praise God sound about you but I tell my wife this you know I tell my wife at some point I want to retire from teaching and just go out and preach you know I'm I always tell her I'm gonna take you with me honey I don't know how much you'll want to travel that's sometimes the conditions aren't so nice but I'd love to go I said I just feel better hey men like there's a poll out there I just feel there's more hey I'm gonna go do more for the kingdom of God but don't get me wrong this is a great thing pastoring is a great thing what if you didn't have sheep food right you be starving to death but we will thank God that we can be fed praise God thank God that we can be a garrison for the kingdom of God but see in our own lives we have to make sure that we're constantly praying for the ministry here in Akron of course and then also for missionaries because brother Adam as a missionary was trusting in the prayers of the people I need your prayers every hour right because I'm going out there and I'm fighting against the foe praise God and you and I fight against foes daily right uh-huh so see the power of dedicated prayer this is mature this is the mature Israel through David they got mature they got a prophet a king a priest they've got a maybe they've got it all set up now the ministry is all set up and now he's able to set Garrison's will you you faithful soldiers now let me read the dictionary calls it like this garrison is a station a place where one stands it's a military post and it's a it's a it could also be a pillar set to mark the Philistine conquest and it can also be a place to collect taxes right it said that about David right he got gifts there so it showed that this is their outer boundaries it also means to place fortified post I like that one a fortified post you know I like that because my bestest that's your post of duty a man this is our garrison praise God and the soldiers of God gathering here to watch right it's a watching station in case there any enemies that come in amongst us so brother an amen now it makes sense brothers and sisters now it makes sense to me why Jesus says watch and pray in other words he's telling them stay at your posts of duty stay at your garrison and you watch and pray from that garrison that's your post of duty and so see when people don't come to church but the hoes they see what happens they fall out they don't have protection they're not protecting or not protecting other people and that's what the Bible says they forsake the assembling they've abandoned their posts of duty and that's why it's such an awful thing to miss Church or to fall out of church because you leave your protection and you also leave your inheritance and it hinders other people's walk with the Lord when we're not at our posts of duty that's right because we're here to build up and edify the body of Christ and if you're not here to protect the body Christ help them then they're missing out praise God so see this is a place a garrison is a place of maturity it takes time to develop that habit of praying every morning right it takes time of develop that habit of reading your Bible every day and praying every night before you go to bed it takes time to develop that and this is what David eventually constructed he was the first one to do that Joshua can you imagine he could you can stand there and you could say Moses didn't do this Joshua didn't do this God called me to do this they could have but God kept it from him but I've got I get to actually walk in the fulfillment of the promise that's exactly what we've got today amen we've got revelation we got the Bible reveal the mysteries restored to us that the other prophets the Bible said the prophets longed to see this day but you and I get to experience it walking at Amen oh they could have but God saved something for us amen these 11th hour workers aren't you glad God save something for you Oh God saved you a little bit of work before the the workers are called in praise God oh my church he gave us a fortification he gave us a place of safety and protection where we're supposed to stand and he calls it up place of prayer hallelujah now this I'm just gonna bring this back up so you remember it and I'll look at a few more things here where's that thought okay yeah there's remember in season 6 after it lists the full armor of God what is the first thing that Paul mentions afterwards prayer for everyone sofie's in 6 I believe it's 18 Lydia if you can pull it up there what does a fully armored sister with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the full armor of God what is her duty in life what is a brother who has the full armor of God on what is one of his greatest works it's the stand at his garrison at his post of duty and pray amen and be in contact with God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching see there just watch him pray see it is right there watch it watch it your post of duty state your garrison right kind of reminds me of the Watson what on the night men we were talking about that kind of reminds me of that watchman one of the night of course that was in the city wall but see that's why they built Garrison's so somebody could watch further than the city so God's inheritance could be protected someone's got to be on the outer realms in church where the outer realms because we're the highways and hedges that parable Jesus tells a parable and he starts by inviting all the people around him they reject it so he says go to the streets get the MAME the heart the withered the blind bring them in and he says we still got rooms she's had a great healing ministry right then he says fine then go out to the highways and hedges because my house my marriage banquet is going to be failed amen hallelujah it's going to be filled and so he says praying always with all prayer and supplication the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints cause in their in their not all all prayer all perseverance and for all saints Oh God see that's why I say then praise the Lord this is a fully armored Christian and let me remind you this speaks to me still when David fell he was supposed to be out in battle see but it was the the Bible said it was the time or the Seas in a battle of springtime but instead of going deeper into battle or inside this deeper into prayer he took a little vacation from prayer and he fell into lust and then a murdering spirit and a lying spirit right lying Daltry lust and then murder all that but see thank God he had a little link God had enough honesty that when the Prophet said you're the one he said you're right god help us to be like that praise God if we get out of step a little bit we make a mistake we fall short of us to be honest enough to admit our mistakes then we can get back to where we should be oh yes praise God so see he left off the battle prayer is the battle praise God and remember the armor of God is connected to the rapture go to first Thessalonians 5 I like this red haven hallelujah 1st Thessalonians 5 the armour of God is completely connected to the rapture God's only gonna rapture fully armored soldiers because but man said Peter went on the day of Pentecost and put on the full armor of God on the day of Pentecost 1st Thessalonians 5 now this is right after the rapture in chapter 4 verse 16 and 17 verse 1 what are the times and seasons brethren you have no need that I ride in you for yourselves know perfectly that the day the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night all right so see he said I don't need to write to you about the time of the rapture because you know Christ is gonna come as a thief in the night you know it's gonna be surprised verse 3 for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape so the world now even her brother Paul LaFontaine preaching on this listen to his Wednesday sermon peace and safety that's what the world wants now just give us peace just give us safety all right they want to be protected from you know ar-15 rifles in which who doesn't we all want to be protected from that but see they're so concerned about safety and then peace you know with with Iran and all the Middle Eastern countries there that are filled with hatred towards Israel they want it they want peace and safety that's what they'll be saying at the time of the rapture now he says you're not children of the the night you're children of the day go down to verse 8 but let us who are of the day be sober see we got to put on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation praise God see we got to know we're safe we got no gods jesus is coming back for me praise God if you don't come back for anybody else he's coming back for me praise God I've got that hope I'm saved I'm delivered praise God verse 9 for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ praise God now after this there's a beautiful scriptures about keeping the Holy Spirit mine these are just so beautiful but ya know notice add a 5 verse 11 edify comfort yourselves together and if I one another see we should strengthen one another here at the church right let's go down to verse 14 now we exhort you brethren warn them their unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men if we see somebody struggling let's be the ones that encourage them not rebuke them let's be the ones that encourage them you might be in line later on might be an order later on but let's be one to encourage them himself can we pray about it right now let's try to do that let's try to pray if you see a need let's pray right now let's pray buzz and so say well I'll pray for you later pray right now pray always for all men with all supplication praise God many times I find when I say that I'll pray for you later I forget then I got to write it on my phone which I thank God for technology but it's better to pray right now invite the presence of the Lord that's right now verse 16 rejoice evermore see you're a soldier you're praying all the time but he said rejoice evermore pray without ceasing there it is right there amen so see how that connects the fusion six it's the same writer same author same Holy Spirit same writer Paul - so see we were able to pray rejoice pray without ceasing verse 18 everything give thanks this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise that prophesy see look at that he's getting in the gifts like we said this morning let the Holy Spirit flow through you praise God if God's moving and open up your mouth and let him let him speak praise God and we shall show this morning how it works through us right it's been working through dreams you know it's been working through going to pray for people like most of those times that even happen in the church I think the only one was the tongue interpretation to happen in the church all the other ones were out in the home but see that proves we're walking with the armor of God not just a church everywhere we go amen we don't take the armor off when you leave Church you keep it on praise God you keep it buckled on hallelujah despise not prophesying all right wonderful so can everybody see this thought it's a real simple thought but can everybody see it I'm I'm protected you and I are protected and cake kept safe every hour through prayer if you don't feel safe if you don't feel something in that your life is right stop and pray it'll be a garrison to you Bill Graham said I'm garrison every hour by prayer now let me find a place to close I got I had all these other notes here and I've been reading this book it's a real good book shaping history through prayer and fasting I love this title and it's true I think about Daniel like Israel's history was shaped by prayer and fasting and it's just a beautiful book here I just started I kind of jumped ahead to chapter six so but I'll get back to chapter one I want to go right to the fasting and prayer it's a I can't wait to read it this man actually this man and the preachers their evangelical - I'm sorry they're charismatic and an evangelical they went and prayed for Ronald Reagan before he got shot Lincoln and so he was showing how the prayer and fasting of the just in their little way protected and saved his life that's powerful that's powerful I thought my oh we need to do that we need to pray for people like I told you a few weeks ago but I don't bang if I told you that I was praying and fasting for the abortions to stop well at least I got a little bit that one week in the same week Ohio defunded Planned Parenthood and then on the national level the federal government cut or I'm sorry Planned Parenthood rejected the government's 65 million dollars all in the same week out or the week after I prayed and fasted for that and we've done that off and on but to me that I mean they're so gonna do it but I just thought wow it's a step in the right direction we know the world we know America is gonna be lost we know all these things that'll never come back but if lives can be saved praise God then let's be about that praise God because the Bible said pray for those who rule pray for those in rule that are an authority over you pray for them that you might live a life and all godliness and peace praise God well that was such an encouragement to me and sister winning out we should tell your testimony sometime can I share a little bit okay sister Wendy was praying and fasting for the people in Hong Kong and right after praying and fasting they got some good victories then they did they shelf the law okay they were gonna add this law that they were gonna be able to take Hong Kong citizens to China right but they you know that you saw the protests my it might still be going on but they shelf that law and they were gonna send tanks China was gonna send tanks in but they decided not to do that and I appreciate that I don't think it's coincidental that those things didn't happen I think it's the hand of Almighty God because this in God just wants one person you did for his will God he just wants to remember the RAM said he just wants to get one man or woman in his own hand hey hallelujah amen the power praying faster than we forget this so I'm thankful the Holy Spirit's bringing it back to our remembrance garrison where garrisoned were protected by prayer and fasting and we'll also go out and possess more land through prayer and fasting now let me close with this thought this chapter six I just started to highlight and reading it it's it's it's called this fasting intensifies prayer so if your prayer life seems a little off you know we all go through it probably weekly monthly if it seems off then the way to get back to it is through fasting and of course fasting was a regular practice of the early church my there's so many good examples in here let me just find the one they go through Jesus's example and I think it'd be worth it to do that oh yeah let's yeah let me just close with this stuff let's go to Luke chapter 4 I think this is a good thought Luke 4 verse 1 Thank You Lydia so in the scripture Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness and we know he fasted 40 days right so notice right after being born again where God sent him to a wilderness to learn how to fast and pray so obviously Jesus remember Jesus that I do nothing except the father shows me first so if he was gonna achieve all of God's ministry for him God was showing him you've got to begin you the way to enter into this ministry is through prayer and fasting I think you and I understand that you and I are not going to enter in a ministry unless we're praying and fasting as far as like finding our position in life if Christ had to do that I mean and he was a perfect man with he's tempted but he never gave in if he had experience if he had to learn to die to self through starving the flesh I think we need to learn that too because Paul does it the Apostles do it we don't have time maybe let next week Lord willing how many one enter in there they're there their ministry praise God I feel like and I you do you do too you probably have entered into it but you want to see a greater benefit of greater fruitfulness to it I do I know I do I believe I've entered in my ministry but like I said I still feel there's even there's more things for me to do for the glory of God but remember this is a great thing I'm not I'm not being any discontent brother I love this you know there's just you know you want to make sure you do I caused you to do and who would ever thought like you'd ask my wife I never thought I'd be a pastor you can ask her she knew me before I was a Christian I never thought I'd be a preacher preaching three sometimes five times a week but it's all to glorify Jesus Christ and we just want to do God's will now at the end of the chapter let's go to Luke not into the chapter but Luke 4:14 after this prayer and fasting Luke for 14 and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit so he goes in the wilderness full hour of it in other words he knows how to yield to it amen and then what does he do he does the Merrick okay 'no can you imagine so just speak just pour that i'll just speak it it'll turn water into wine see he had preparation now he's in the power of the spirit he fasted he prayed he's been with god amen in other words God's hand upon him like we saw this morning amen God's hand was upon him and now I could do these things what a beautiful example and I remember Jesus puts that same thing on you and I see fasting was the final phase of preparation for Christ before he entered into his public ministry and we all want to see God do public things in our lives right we want to see soul saved we want to see people on the job being saved we won't you want to see your co-workers say don't you you want to see your family safe we'll see maybe it requires a little more consecration a little more consecration I feel that way too I mean I've always felt all these years that I there's somebody in Copley I need to win to the Lord and bring him in the message we've had a few visit but brother bang I feel like there's I honestly feel God didn't send me over there just to teach them ABCs I like ABCs I had enough of them sometimes I feel like it but I like to go to algebra sometimes at least algebra but I just feel like there's got to be a predestinate seat out there don't you feel like that I feel like the reason I'm out there is not just to teach ABCs I want to teach spiritual algebra out there you know there's got to be a soul I pray for I prayed him fasted I've wrote it down I've I've wept God's give us Souls out of coplete for the message of the hour so I'm just hanging on until God takes me out of there I just feel there's got to be more to me being up there it wouldn't be awesome to see that happen in six months or year would that be awesome to see somebody you becoming the message through copy I'm not prophesied I'm just saying I just want to see the further ment of my work praise God now Jesus exceeds the works that I do shall he do also so Jesus said that we can do the same thing as him right now Lydia pull-up John 13 16 and let's stand I've got to get you standing there else I'll just pre keep reaching I stand all this is good this is rich praise God how they taste and see that the Lord is gracious isn't God gracious John 13 6 verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that has sent greater than he that sent him now apply this now to Jesus's ministry and our ministry who's greater Jesus or the bride I hope you say Jesus if not you've got a idolatry spirit on you a selfish I - your spirit worshiping yourself Jesus Christ is greater than all of us and if he had to fast and pray and devote time to that to enter into his ministry we're not greater than him well I don't need to fast and pray no the reality is we need to fast and pray - it needs to become a greater part of our lives if we want to possess the land and if we want to set up Garrison's in our lives praise God hallelujah I believe God's done that sister Karen I believe that you know with you with your family moving in and praying and all the ones brother Jose God look at the protection God has placed around us the spirits we have had come in here they don't stay very long when Iced not to Pat us on the back ground that's to say thank God for His grace and you know sometimes people can hang her I mean people brother BAM said the some Satan will anoint someone with the wrong spirit and he'll torment the people in the church he or she I'm thankful that those that the wrong spirits that have come in here God has effectively and graciously moved them out and protected our lives so that we can continue serving the Lord right in the sweetness of the fellowship and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord the thankful for that we are seeing protection we are protected by the prayers of the saints amen I believe that so that was John 13-6 the servant is not greater the Lord I want to read right out of here if fasting was a necessary part of Jesus's own preparation it must play a part in the disciples preparation because we're not more spiritual than Jesus and don't even try to think you are I don't think anybody does here but we can't ever think we're you know cuz we hear it all the time the brides the word she's the work she's the bride she's the word she's the word well yeah but you got to submit to the word your that's in your soul but your you got to get your mind and body to obey that word it doesn't do any good just say I'm the word on the word on the word you've got to live the word I've got to live the word we've got to become that word see we hear so much so sometimes we forget we've actually got to live that we've got to manifest that and become that musicians if you'll come here let's make the transition here are you blessed by that garrison my prayer what a blessing my that's been on my heart for years he's been laying there and my potential sermon ideas I didn't get to go through the full extent maybe Lord willing next week but I just felt led to preach that tonight I hope that was a blessing that's what I want my life I want to achieve the fulfillment of my ministry I want to reach the apex of it in other words I want to ascend Everest praise God wherever that apex is I know there I know there's a valley coming brother being pretty
