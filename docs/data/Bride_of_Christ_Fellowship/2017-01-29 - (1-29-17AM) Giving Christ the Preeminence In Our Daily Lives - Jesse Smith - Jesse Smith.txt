specials thank you brother Loris appreciate each and every one that had the song on their heart there praise the Lord [Music] this morning I'd like to um turn in our Bibles to Colossians chapter 1 we'll just read Verse 18 i' like to uh I kind of just want to follow up from last Sunday I I really enjoyed uh being there with brother cam we had some wonderful meetings and some good testimonies and I was just really blessed to see how God's really revived their church over there they got a real good revival going on and four new Souls have come to the Lord so it's really great to see that uh God moving there uh with the Saints there brother cim laboring they're just doing a wonderful job serving the lord so we're very thankful and encouraged and uh so Colossians chapter 1 vers 18 but I got to hear Brother gab's sermons I listened to those a couple times each and really enjoyed them I kind of want to just follow up and do a little more on that I've been uh telling my wife and uh emailing different brothers and and saying I'd like to preach a little more on the family so we'll do a little bit of that but uh if you heard brother Gabe's sermons last week uh uh it just kept hitting the same things over and over uh deal with the home church family technology and all you know complacency and being in the right condition so I just really felt led to uh continue on that I was just so blessed like I was just sitting on the edge of my spiritual seat listening to it I listen to it all week and also listening to marriage and divorce from brother brandom all week just enjoying that that message there but Colossians 1:18 let's read this here by God's grace let's read it together we just have one verse uh let's begin on three 1 two 3 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence let's just bow our heads in word of prayer if you have a need on your heart that you'd like to give him preeminence in within your life or like to have his will for an area of life just somehow make that known unto the Lord let's just bow our heads heavenly father my hands raised Lord we want to give you the preeminence this morning uh we want to give you first place in our lives Lord so we just pray see the need on the Heart Lord God see the need behind the hand Lord behind the prayer behind the tear behind the desire Lord behind the song hear our our our cries Lord from our hearts and I pray you just Minister by your word as you always do you are the word Discerning our our souls and spirits and Bone and the Sunder Lord and rightly dividing everything Lord help us this morning to get out of your way Lord and may you be glorified minister to the needs of the Saints live streaming but also most importantly the home home church here Lord God this little flock you've called us to gather in Lord may the great Shepherd the Lord Jesus Christ come and feed his sheep this morning guide us to Green Pastures and pure Waters Lord God and we thank you for that Lord and we just pray now we ask all these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you be seated praise God so let's look at this here uh thought by the grace of the Lord Malachi if you'd like to switch over over here buddy you want to um just show some quotes this morning want to look at uh giving Christ the preeminence in our daily lives so we want to look at this thought and uh just kind of continue on what brother Gabe was brought out you know and it was very wonderful I was listening to it he was using some of the very quotes I've been mentioning lately so I just made a little visual there we got priorities in life and we got to first we got to obey Jesus Christ and so our title this morning is giving Christ preeminence in our daily lives that's kind of what his sermons kept going over um and uh I was really I really enjoyed all the teaching you know like his pictures he does pictures a lot better than me but uh I sure appreciate everybody's got their gifts and calling and I sure appreciate his gift amen I was so glad uh that you could hear uh from the Holy Spirit and uh and I know some of the things he was preaching God was dealing with me on and uh I know he's dealing with people in the church on those things oh brother van I'm sorry I can switch it over sorry about that buddy that work okay you'd have to shut down Chrome itself and then start all over so the live stream just off okay okay yeah would probably best just to stop it and try it again but if you don't how to try again it's okay I mean we just okay thank you darling so let's look at this thought here giving Christ prence in our daily lives you know technology like I said does really good about 99% of the time and this must be the 1% this morning you know but uh usually it works really great like I said really great um so our text was just one little scripture Colossians 1:18 I just want to focus on preeminence you know brother Gaye brought out some great quotes I'm going to try to bring out uh those uh and then a few more by the grace of the Lord uh so the word preeminence I thought what does preeminence actually mean you know if they gave it a a definition in the Lexicon it mean
