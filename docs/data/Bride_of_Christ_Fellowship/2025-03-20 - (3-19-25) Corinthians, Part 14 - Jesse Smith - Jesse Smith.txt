========================================

I'm thinking it's going to be a shorter sermon that might be hard for people to believe but I think it's shorter and then if that's the case then I'll just share some thoughts about uh the Deeds of nicadan and so forth like that so I appreciated brother Simon uh preaching that and I requested that because I I thought I'd be here and uh since I know that he he and cam have studied uh deeper in those topics I wanted to hear I want to hear like the fresh Revelation on it like any other fresh Revelation so I got to listen to it today by God's grace I was blessed and so um if there's a little time afterwards I'll uh just share a few thoughts on that by God's grace to just kind of add to it I wish I one thing I wish I wish I could have saw his pictures up here I was straining at the you know the YouTube screen I'm like I can't too blurry just just not enough pixels there so but uh thankful for God's grace here uh 1 Corinthians 10:15 by God's grace I think this is part 14 I might have put 15 on the internet but we'll get that figured out here by God's grace I don't want to get too far from this series uh I could have kept going on the spirit of burning but I had to done a little more study um but i' studied on this one here so uh we'll look at this here tonight by God's grace 1 Corinthians 10:15 now we've uh preached uh chapter 10 here uh verses 1 to 15 but I'm going to start at 15 by God's grace so let's read this we'll just read one verse there and then have you be seated let's read that on three one two 3 I speak as to wise men judge ye what I say may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated by God's grace we'll take uh I do think I have slides honey if you'd like to uh put them up there I'm going to set a timer here and see how as I was studying this I thought well I don't think I'll I don't think it'll take me too long to preach for this but you never know all the thoughts from all the other sermons you listen to you know they kind of come out sometimes and um we'll kind of see how this goes here by God's grace but we read our text now this chapter has three different topics according to CI scoffield uh we looked at uh the first Set uh a while back it would have been back in February Israel in the wilderness was a warning example I think there was four warnings uh there in chapter 10 uh remember one was uh fornication idolatry murmuring and I can't remember the last one um so let me go there by God's grace and then we'll look at that just a review that yes idolatry fornication oh tempting Christ tempting Christ and then uh murmuring against others or against God hallelujah so we don't want to complain we want to keep our bodies pure Hallelujah right we don't want any Idols in our life right nothing that we go to more than we go to Christ a lot of people go to the bottle or they go to the cigarette pack or whatever or they go to porn or whatever they go to they go to that for pleasure we got to go to Jesus Christ for all our pleasure Hallelujah that's the word of God hallelujah now we uh also saw then uh here now that we'll get to the next topic I think we can finish the chapter tonight uh by the help of the Lord if God would be gracious to us we'll look at fellowship at the Lord's table demand separation so Paul kind of starts getting down you know he mentioned this earlier in chapter 8 but now he's going to kind of get down to cutting it right here telling exactly what to do because remember there was people that were fresh they were fresh in the message right they're just coming into Christianity and they they get invited to this Temple you know Temple of uh Apollos or something Aphrodite and they know it's going to be after all the the false worship and and they're just going to go there and eat right and they just think well I'm just going there to eat I'm not going to partake in the worship I'm not going to partake in the prostitution but it's a free meal it's kind of an honor you know these guys got money and and I'm hungry right they didn't have two-day delivery like Amazon like we do right so you know they had they more Agricultural Society it was a lot of hard work to get some food you know wasn't eat you couldn't go just go buy some steak you know down a Chipotle but for whatever reason they just thought it was uh part of the you it was acceptable but uh Paul has to come down and right here in chapter 10 he kind of cuts it right there and you're going to see what he says here just lays it out uh precisely that's verses 16 to 22 and then in uh to end the chapter it's verses 23- 33 the law of love and how it relates to eating and drinking by God's grace okay so we've now we're into the uh the fifth section here we looked at the introduction standing in Grace now church if ever a church needed Grace it was this one now all of us do how many know our church needs Grace amen unmar favor which means we didn't earn it God just gave it right and then of course there's Mercy something different right Mercy is when you're you're guilty but God shows you Mercy Grace is just a gift but Mercy is when you deserve worse but you get less thank God for grace and and mercy but if any church in the Bible that we can read of in the New Testament needed Grace it was the Corinthians and then we saw how they were divided and uh God's helped us here to become United by God's grace because we've had to separate Le out of our church Hallelujah has to be done right if not like I told different different intervals if not then we become uh we became uh we come under the influence of evil spirits run the church instead of the Holy Ghost how Hallelujah right so we must be very careful uh not to be divided into factions and clicks people call them today clicks uh try to show love to everybody praise God so make sure you tell everybody God bless you when you see them hallelujah or as they're going make sure you tell everybody God bless you see how their weeks going and like we said a few weeks ago talk about Jesus hey say did you hey what you been reading your Bible lately so that'll make you more accountable too make sure you read your Bible make sure you got an answer ready I was going into that Fellowship on and I I told you remember I was I was going to that Fellowship last Sunday there or Saturday with my family and friends and I prayed before I went in and I got numerous opportunities to witness the word of God to people because I remember last Wednesday night I pray said God help me to remember this prayer when I go to that and I remember the prayer because God reminded me but I just saw it again before you walk into any uh Place have something you're ready to say by God's grace I also had answers to tell them why I was growing my hair long too by God's grace so but I was prepared to pray Hallelujah uh now and then after the division he had to get into how sexual immorality was actually being celebrated because they failed to repent of it uh the man sleeping with his stepmother which even the pagans wouldn't do and then uh we looked at the sanctity of body and marriage your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and then marriage there's only one cause now as we saw in 1 Corinthians 7 people can divorce for any reason but they cannot remarry and still be in the sight of God as being holy if they marry again they'll be adulterers Hallelujah and then last week when brother Rod was here now if you noticed when brother Rod's here what do I do I try to preach on brother brandom because he's starting to re he's starting to understand it more by God's grace he said every time I come I learn more about brother Brandon so if you notice I try to study I got two sermons ready when I know he's coming so if he comes I got it if not I can preach my regular messages because you all you can say Amen you've heard most of those things before but how enjoy reminders as well by God's grace I need them too I forget brother said that brother said that brother I forget all these things there's and brother was always pointing us back to the word of God hallelujah now I wasn't perfect but I mean the majority of the time I'm never claiming a man's perfect outside of Christ does everybody understand that so like last week I said everything brother brand preached was was from God now I didn't you know that was hyperbole you know everybody understands that right we're not worshiping brother brand I'm not going to join Joseph in that that group I'm not joining the tape Church movement but I'm just saying in general the the general theme of his life was to point us back to the scriptures Hallelujah that's what he said in the church age book his his goal was to restore a true relationship between God and man and that's what I've got how many got the same thing tonight you have a real relationship not with the domination right not with your uh not with a church Creed or or not with a church membership but you have a real relationship with Jesus Christ how do you know because he talks to you and you do what he says that's the way you know you obey what he said because Jesus said if you love me keep my commands Hallelujah quite an introduction here I didn't know I was going to do all this and then the fifth part was uh we're looking at tonight Christian Liberties and their warning so Paul says you I of all these Liberties so many new people remember Jesus said you have much people in this city there was many Believers in Corinth so it's going to be a lot of sin see the more people you got the more sin you got bigger Church bigger problems little church little problems amen hallelujah now verse 15 I speak as to wise men judge you what I say the cup of blessing which we bless so see that's why when we have communion I always bless the symbols it's a symbol it's a cup of blessing when you take communion it's a blessing I won't let PE some people take it because they're not obeying the word of God and I don't want them to suffer they could get sick and weakly or die if I let them take a cup of blessing when they're living in a in a a disobedient condition to the word of God hallelujah that's right is it not the communion of the blood of Christ Hallelujah the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ so Paul now returns now he gets back to eating and drinking because that's what he talked about in chapter eight right chapter nine was Paul saying this is how preachers live right preachers are allowed to take ties and offerings that's the way God set it up but then I I got also got to make sure uh that that I I constantly keep my body and be into subjection I live a life of of self-discipline Hallelujah and not just the preachers everybody everybody's got to remain discipline to the Holy Spirit or else Paul said I could be a cast away too people people could fall away we didn't expect it but it's going to happen if they don't if they don't keep the sin out of their lives they're going to fall away that's right so now he says now the communion cup is a blessing we see it's it's a cup of blessing and now Paul returns his whole point here is to to show the sin of trying to partake of both cups we're going to see an example brother gives here tonight uh in a story you've heard it before but I think it'd be a refreshing to you verse 17 for we being many are one bread so as a church we are bread right and that gets back I'm going to preach on this hopefully again soon I've been studying on this uh the seven feasts of Israel the Feast of Weeks is when they waved two loaves of bread before the Lord and they both had leaven in them it represent the Jew and the Gentile Hallelujah and that represent the day of Pentecost amen the Holy Ghost fell and now the Holy Ghost unites us all as one body together hallelujah we're one bread we're so intertwined right we're so intertwined but when leevan comes in what does the Holy Spirit do takes it out so we can be one bread again Hallelujah so we see that so we're supposed to be United like bread how many bread makers we got it there don't raise your hand if you don't if you feel embarrassed I know my wife can raise her hand on that one I know my daughters are trying to learn can you once you make that bread can you separate all those grains again and go back do you see individuals selfish individuals in there no you see a body living for each other and the church said Hallelujah you can't you can't go back and separate well this one that one it's one they're United we're a family Hallelujah that's right Glory one body and we're all partakers of that one bread speaking of the communion table behold Israel after the flesh are are they are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers so the the priests which partakers means a partnership a fellowship an associate a companion of the altar so when Israel would partake uh a member Church in every they had five sacrifices in the four sacrifices they got to eat something but in the burn sacrifice they ate nothing so with the four other ones they would actually partake and eat some of their sacrifice whether it was wine right whether it was meat whether it was uh bread as well they got to partake of it so they were partaking with God they were feasting in the presence of God hallelujah amen they were eating and enjoying the benefits that God gave them with God and with God's servants Hallelujah they were one body so they had this Fellowship they had this Association at the Lord's table hallelujah thank God right so Paul shows that you need the body of Christ and how communion promotes this Unity that's why I want to do it now I think I do it every three months now or four months I can't remember I I I appreciate sister Emma getting me helping me do that you know she didn't recommend that but I was like well if you need know in advance I'm going to start doing that in advance something that uh meets our needs now when I was at brother brookses we did communion uh the first Sunday of every month every single month and that was fine okay but I just haven't felt led to do that I like to spread it out a little bit more by God's grace uh you know and then brother R says in the early church they communion every time they gathered because they were so uh just so captivated you know with uh the the the day of Pentecost look what happened on the day of Pentecost and look what happened days after that you know they were captivated uh they had their first love Hallelujah so it's really something now he says we Fellowship I'm sorry communion promotes the unity which he emphasizes in the next chapter we'll see and then we fellowship with Christ and his body through communion and we're cursed if we judge the body the wrong way so that's how you know always look at things long term people that disobey the word they're going to live in curses but people that obey the word they're going to live in obedience now doesn't mean they're not going to suffer like job they might suffer and suffer awful but see ultimately you know if we have the discernment of the Holy Spirit we should be able to know who's living right who's living wrong right because a tree is known by its fruit know by fruit Hallelujah and so see we fellowship with Christ okay through that and we're cursed yes we're cursed according to we'll get to that later in chapter 11 we read it every time at Communion but just a fresh reminder that there are temporary curses in the New Testament now will those fall on Holy Ghost filled Believers I don't believe that I believe it'll be just be the Justified and the Sanctified I cannot imagine a holy ghost filled believer would fall under a curse like that right because we don't see in the scripture we see Peter you know disassociating I had another one too I just forgot another one there's a couple examples New Testament where people get off the word of God there I think I had one or two other ones but we don't see Peter coming under a curse because of that but we see him getting rebuked and God help us to accept a rebuke Hallelujah if you really love God then when you get rebuked you'll love God more and the person who rebuked you Hallelujah that's right because that's what Proverbs says rebuke a wise man he'll love you now won't that doesn't mean it's not going to sting a little bit you know it's going to Sting the Flesh and the church said I'll say this you know it's going to Sting the pride as well the human spirit it's going to sting but in the end you love the person Hallelujah verse 19 what say I then that the that the idols anything or that which is offered and sacrificed to Idols is anything so notice if you remember in chapter 8 verse4 Paul said the idols were nothing so we know Idol are nothing we know witch doctors and witches it's nothing it's demon powers it's nothing right but here now he shows them that are that they're fellowshipping with the Devils when they eat with pagans in their temples so going on the devil's grounds means you're going to start fellowshipping with demons and church it's usually by a dirty joke or something to get your get your guard down make you laugh and feel comfortable usually something real small right so imagine they wouldn't they would not have thrown a prostitute right in the uh right in the presence of those Corinthians Believers it would have started with something dealing with the food like a little joke about making fun of Jesus or making fun of Paul or making fun of one of the other Christians and you laugh a little bit then then the devil's got your guard down that's that first step right in the Sin process right sin conceived I'm sorry sin enticed entices you to laugh or entices you to look just look a little bit something you shouldn't look at then it conceives then you do the sin then comes death now God always make help us repent before it gets to the four step right because we all sin some of us sin every day and the church say Amen verse 20 but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to God and I would not that you should have fellowship with Devils so think of the bars think of the adult clubs what do they when they pay their money that's a form of sacrifice they're sacrificing to the gods of sports or the gods of alcohol or the gods of sexual morality and the church said they're sacrificing their time and money for that it's a form of worship Hallelujah and that's their fellowship with demon powers Hallelujah that could be like a could be like a comedian Club too anything like that it could be a theater right a movie theater same thing when you pay money and you accept that and you go in there and it's an evil thing you're actually fellowshipping with demons now not us I'm saying we but hopefully not us by God's grace now remember this story now this was something too it just came to me while I was praying here at the altar before service it seems like Christians can get possessed with demons if they're just Justified and they or they lose their sanctification that's what it seems like but a holy ghost filled Saint will never be possessed by a devil because Satan sealed out and and Christ is sealed in because I thought about this I'm like wow brother random cast The Demon out of this young lady here and I was like yes I've cast demons out of people to messed churches before at least six times I think so this is a fresh thought I haven't had this thought before so that was something interesting now and the the example would be Saul Saul was justified he was saved the the anointing came on Saul but it left him because he got jealous and then the evil spirit came on then David had to play like you and then the demon left and the church said so we got some good examples there's good couple examples by God's grace have to find some more now not full not not not fullblown out you know uh foaming at the mouth or like some people have said they've seen who was that told me that the other day one of these preachers told me the other day that they actually saw a a woman possessed with a demon crawl like a snake right in front of him brother R talked about it he's seen demons do that which preacher was that remember somebody was telling me that that they've seen that demons uh anoint women or men and they crawl like snakes right in front of them and then they pray to cast out the demons now I don't think a a a saved Christian I don't think that could happen to a saved Christian but look what happens when Nelly Sanders goes on the devil's grounds now watch watch this she became possessed with the Devil by dancing to worldly music so be careful what you pass your foot to church I've got to be careful too I lived in the world a long time I didn't like it I don't like that I did but I've got to be careful not to say those lyrics or you know start tapping my foot it just it's because it's sometimes it's just a human reaction everybody acting like they're perfect out there all the time you know I'm just kidding uh then this was the first time brother B cast a demon out of a person it's someone who is already a member of the church his church and it looked that evil spirit look like a bat now that's scriptural because of Revelation chapter 9 talks about that one of the Demons has hair like women on hanging down from its wings so picture that a bat-like demon and long hair hanging down on the wings of a bat or it looks like a wings of a bat okay so this was fellowship with Devils Now watch how it happens how many ever know Nelly Sanders I guess a whole lot of you well she said well you know what maybe if I walk the steps up there maybe I'll be able to testify to some of the them so she went to the she went by the dance club or we'd say like the bar today or uh I don't know what do they call dance clubs today clubs nightclub thanks it's not in my life anymore uh so she walks by one she hears music she's like oh maybe I'll go testify to them that's the wrong place to testify maybe now look there's another key word maybe if it's a if God ain't send you in there don't go in there it's not a maybe issue it's a it's got to be a thus sayith the Lord good because Jesus went into Sinners houses but he never sinned Hallelujah and a woman by herself that's usually not how God Saves people oh see you're right on the devil ground say of it shun the very appearance of evil she walked up top of the steps stood there for a few minutes first thing you know she's in a boy's arms on the floor doing the Chubby Checkers the twist or something who knows I don't know then she come to herself she was standing there crying going on oh I'm lost now for good so this is what demon possession will do it'll make you think you're lost crying laying on the floor and the church said think about it think about people's behavior think about people how they look how they act think about when they're emotional think about that it can be a form of being maybe being be maybe just being possessed with one demon in the story it's one demon she's possessed with now that remember uh uh Legion uh that was what 3,000 I forget the actual number I have to go look it up what was it 2,000 thank you you can look it up in the Lexicon but even that's not thus sayi the lord it's just somebody's best guess it's a lexicon um Mary Magdalene seven demons now she was living in adultery so a person that will sleep with many partners without repenting they have at least multiple demons we don't we don't know the exact number but she had seven by sleeping around and did you did you see that news uh there was some overseas in uh she slept with a 100 men in one day it was all over the news how many demons is she filled with I would say 700 7,000 maybe my goodness he says uh oh I'm lost now for good I thought well I don't know much too too much about the Bible but I believe Jesus said in my name they shall cast out devils look at that just a brand new Christian and Wayne had sobered up and said was sitting there now this is in brother Ram's house watching now devil I don't know who you are brother Ram said but I'm telling you now this is my sister you ain't got no business withh holding her she didn't mean to do that she just stopped for a minute now look the devil leaves but she must have repented because you can't make a devil leave because the devil has uh legal rights unless the person repents Hallelujah so while she's crying there she must have repented when brother random uh goes to cast The Demon out right she must have or else it' be like Moses when Moses got in trouble for magnifying himself with his own gift praise God remember when he smoked The Rock he said God said speak no I'll smoke I'll Smite it and he got in trouble for that he never got into the baptism of the Holy Ghost for his day the type she just stopped for a minute that's where she made her mistake though see but you're going to have to come out of her you hear me that you hear me look at his Elementary way to talk to Demons now you don't have to say that you just have to say in the name of Jesus give it a few minutes give it a give it a second give it give it some time the Demon's going to move if if if if the legal rights have been met if that sin's been confessed the devil has to go has to go I'm talking about in your life too when you're rebuking Spirits trying to get in your mind just trying to tempt you and God so helped me God at the Judgment bar knows that screen door begin to open and shut so when the devil went out it opened and shut it's by itself plumpy plumpy there at the door pump K plump K plump I thought and she said bill look at there look at there I said yeah what is it she said I don't know I said neither do I the door wasn't pumpy Pump It shutting like that I thought what's the matter here what's the matter I looked again and I said leave her Satan in Jesus name come out of her when I said that it looked like a great big bat about this long rose up from behind her with long hair hanging down out of its wings and off its feet like that was going ooh started right towards me just as hard as it could come and I said Lord God the blood of Jesus Christ protect me from that church the only you got one protection that's the blood of Jesus Christ that's all you got and church that's all we need Hallelujah that's all you need remember when I cast out Devils the the first time I I said as soon as I said uh the sister wants to be forgiven as soon as I said the blood of Jesus Christ is against you that woman the devil started fighting through the woman it's the first time I cast out deves I brought the blood of Jesus Christ because blood paid the price for her Freedom amen so the the the de the demon has no more legal right to be there because Jesus Paid the price for her Freedom hallelujah amen Jesus died on the cross so she could be forgiven saved set free and so when the blood of Jesus Christ is spoken the demons have to flee hallelujah oh there's wonderful working Power in the Blood tonight Hallelujah there's wonderful working Power in the Blood Hallelujah and Wayne jumped up in the bed looked here it was a big Shadow circled around went around went down behind the bed out the bed went weighing next to room as hard as he could go I got Nelly took her home come back mom went in there shook the sheets and everything there wasn't nothing in the bed what was it a devil went out of her what happened she stopped for a moment brother knocks the pulpit two times that's all don't stop at all when God sinks his word in your heart just take the sword and start chopping and cutting Hallelujah all right right so see there's an example of going on the devil's grounds just like these Corinthians were going on the devil's grounds well no wonder they're suing each other no wonder they're sleeping around divisions in the church getting drunk at the Lord's table no wonder because they're fellowshipping with demons on demon grounds and so they get demons in their minds Hallelujah they get anointed with evil spirits Paul said neither give place to the devil don't give him a place Hallelujah now look here now he starts laying it down here he starts telling the truth now you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils that's why my wife and I we've seen all these people come to the message soon as they start dabbling with movies or as soon as they start dabbling with something where they go on the devil's grounds Sports you name it or whatever uh universities and certain clubs and universities as soon as they go on the devil grounds see you later they take demon powers we don't see them no more because they've been fully given over to those things they're going on the devil's grounds remember we said last week Jesus said come out of her my people hallelujah be not a partaker come out and be separ sayith the Lord and I'll receive you Hallelujah then I'll be a father unto you see because Satan's your father when you're on the devil's grounds Hallelujah cannot partake of the Lord's table end of the table Devils you can't do both right either love one hate the other or hate hate one love the other right do we provoke the Lord to jealousy the answer is no let me answer that for you no we're not supposed to provoke the Lord by flirting with the world are we stronger than he the answer is no no you're not stronger than God Paul's saying you cannot partake of both without consequences right balam remember balam partook of both cups sometimes you go for enchantments other times you go to God and what was his consequence hell was his consequence see the people that often do this if if they partake of both if they can't love the message but love the world they're on their way to Hell amen if they don't get delivered of that because you cannot do both he just said it right there thus say the word you cannot drink of both really you're only drinking of one and the church said so see when they come to church they a't get nothing out of it they're lives aren't changing They Don't Really Love Jesus they're just coming to church to make themselves uh uh not feel so much condemnation Hallelujah that's right church but really if they're partaking of the devil's cup they're serving Satan Hallelujah but how many enjoy the cup of the Lord hallelujah thank God we get to drink of the pure Waters of Life Living Waters and it gives us joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah oh thank you Lord remember balum went to hell the Bible said The Mist Of Darkness that's where he's going to spend millions of years not eternity but he's going to spend millions of years in a midst of darkness and then there's flames right we see it in Luke 16 and then there's torment and there's desire for just one drop of water and that's before the that's before the white Throne judgment that's not even the Lake of Fire that's just hell that's just shol right quite a sobering thought verse 23 all things are lawful to me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not so Paul repeats what he said remember he said this in chapter 6 verse 9 by saying just just because something is lawful doesn't mean it's spiritually beneficial eating in Pagan temples doesn't build up anyone's Faith right and I'll say like this you got to be careful even with Applebees and places like that if it's like a sports bar something like that or they got a bar there you got to be real careful with that right not to get involved with that now for me especially someone who used to be in the sports if I go in a place like that we either gotta leave or I got to sit so I'm not looking at the TV screens because that's a that's a a quick Temptation oh who's the latest player what's the score just it's all the old things it's the old life but that guy is supposed to be dead Hallelujah right but Satan tries to resurrect the well the flesh the sinful nature is always there he tries to anoint that again AR fresh see eating in the Pagan temples doesn't build up anyone's Faith rather it's a sin against Christ and it's a wound to the believer's conscience if you go on the devil's grounds and someone see a weak Christian sees you do something and that they think they can do it or they get confused you've wounded their conscience you've hurt their walk with god oh is sister so and so really a Believer is brother so- and so really a believer that you just sinned against Christ because you did something publicly that should not be done praise God hallelujah let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth so in every choice we should be trying to serve other people what would help other people's Faith yes I've got Liberty yes I enjoy Liberty all these things but he says don't make your Liberty a stumbling block to younger Christians that's why church I just like going home I just want to go home go to bed early it's really all I want to do like I told even in the past sometimes I I've regretted going to certain sporting events I told you in the past I've regretted because I wasn't ready for what was going to be there the music and the cheerleaders I'll say like that I regretted it and so I avoid that I learned praise God that's right now verse 25 whatsoever is sold in the shambles which is the meat market or grocery store for us it actually says grocery store in the Greek surprising that eat asking no question for conscious sake so whatever you go to the market don't ask any questions it's okay you know it's not you know it's not there's nothing evil spirit that's going to get on you for the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof so the location of where you get the food and where you eat it is important so he says if you go in the temple that's different that's different if you go in that Pagan Temple where there's prostitutes and the lights are down all these people that turn on their lights in church you better watch that that means something bad's going on right and we it's we've been seen it this these last few years all these preachers fall these last few years I'm talking about mega church uh preachers they just Fallen they're falling like flies because there are evil sins done in the dark behind the scenes so it's important where you get the food and where you eat the food it's important where you eat it and around who right you got to be very careful what you do Hallelujah so for us it's going to be which restaurant you go to be very careful which restaurant you go to and where you sit when you go there for brothers or who whoever might battle uh you know things for the past with TV screens and so forth or even music verse 27 if any of them that believe bid or I'm sorry believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed which means you wish to go or desire to go whatsoever set before you eat asking no questions for conscience sake but if any man say to you this is offered and sacrificed unto Idols eat not for his sake that showed it and for con ience sake so see be a light to The Sinner remember you got to live holy before them when are they ever going they're never going to go to church the only church they going to see is in you right and also for your conscious sake for the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof Hallelujah so now now that we see okay now that we know now we're in we're mature Believers we know we don't need anything around a sin a sinful group of people where there's a lot of sin going on prostitution gambling all these things right dancing sinful dancing I me how many weddings have we left honey because uh it was time of the reception there's all this dirty music I'm like let's get out of here that's that's the sign it's our time to go I don't want to see them dance and rub their uh body parts against each other and immorality what a bunch of Filth hallelujah it's time for us to go see you later that's what you have to do conscious I say not thine own but of the other for why is my Liberty judge of another man's conscience so now he goes to the other side one side is just avoid it all but another side is wealth there's nothing going on there and there it's not offered to an idol and it's at a certain place maybe it's like a market or something but it's of course it's not the Temple of Apollos or Aphrodite then also don't let your Liberty be judged don't come under condemnation church we got to find the balance of the Holy Spirit I like what brother Simon said like David in every situation find the mind of Christ wasn't that great that's what I did after service I didn't know uh I was I was being asked are we going to have a second service you know what I did I was like I just heard the preaching I don't know let me get on my knees and pray I said if Simon's feeling good Lord then because remember his stomach hurt too after leaving that that that meal but his stomach's tougher than mine no doubt about it I'm just an old I'm just a young fell my sto my stomach's not tough enough but I just said Lord it's in your hands if he's feeling good then let them have service Simon's like ah we'll have service praise God I feel great so I thought well maybe people are tired I know people are tired you know maybe I know all these things but Lord I want it to be in your hands Hallelujah and there are a lot of good questions up there young people young people and even Zion forgot three questions that's okay if I only forget three things I'm pretty happy like you see if I only forget three song lyrics I'm I felt I did pretty good that day everybody's nice did not laugh at me thank you verse 30 first if I by Grace be a partaker why am I evil spoken of for that which I gave thanks see here's the other side don't let your Liberty be evil spoken of so see if first see if if there's any sinful things around avoid sin like the plague but if you're in a spot where there's no sin going on and somebody offers you some food there yeah you can have that so Paul strongly defends our Christian Liberties when we're not wounding the consciences of others like like in Colossians 2:16 And1 17 so if we're not wounding then we are to enjoy your Christian freedoms and the church said enjoy your freedoms just enjoy life just be thankful like Simon said all this Christian persecution there's hundreds of Christians being slaughtered all around the world yes we pray for them we should be sad but then you know after we prayed and we it's okay to enjoy life but we still should try to do something about those other groups praise God and that's what I need to learn I'm asking God to Lord show me what I can do by God's grace what can I what can I do for these people other than pray now if prayer is enough then then praise God I'll do that so if you're not wounding somebody enjoy your freedom but all but also always pay attention where you're eating and where what who the people that are around you be cautious of them verse 31 whether therefore ye eat or drink I love this verse or whatsoever you do do all to the glory of God hallelujah so we glorify God while keeping the Commandments and also while enjoying our liberties because we have pure consciences Hallelujah all right so can everybody see the balance there Paul cuts it off he says you cannot drink both cups but if you're in a spot where it's not so much it's not obvious and there's no Pagan sin going around and there's no dirty stuff around and don't let also don't let your Liber to be judged right so just use the wisdom of the Holy Spirit verse 32 give none offense neither to the Jews nor the Gentiles nor to the Church of God even as I please all men in all things not seeking my own profit but the prophit of many that they may be saved so what does this all boil down to let's try to have some people saved praise God Jesus said few there be that find it there's going to be very few people save think about that all these people that claim to go to church and they put Jesus stuff there on their Facebook on Sunday or whatever their Twitter or ex or whatever they do not many of them are going to be saved very few are going to be saved that's why we should always think about what are we doing in public what do people see about our lives when I was on Facebook I was very careful what I put on there because I didn't want to cause people to stumble now are there always going to be haters yes someone's always drinking haterade always it's like it's on constant tap at their house they got water they got haterade right next to it so they they probably mix them up all day that's probably what they do you know you can't please evil spirits right so that's why you really got to know where you stand right like we talked about with holidays and Liberties you really got to know where you stand with Liberties praise God all right Hallelujah and we just want to see people saved I think when I was leaving Saturday Zion might have saw me I shook so many hands I talked to the people my my main thing was make sure you love Jesus Christ with all your heart God bless you uh I was telling the married couples there there's two people that are going to get married I went up there to the brothers I said Brothers Keep Jesus at the center of your life uh Keep Jesus at the center of your marriage you have a good marriage you can't do anything unless you put Jesus at the center of your marriage and they said okay brother okay brother okay I'm preaching Adam there so even though I didn't preach on Sunday I did preach Saturday praise God very short sermons though sometimes probably people wish I preach them short here too so we should focus on pleasing others so that they might be saved God may God save some people hallelujah that's all we want to see just some people saved by the grace of God okay now oh Glory now I would that was my previous is ending but okay all right I'm going to greet the live streamers love you all we're to call live stream God bless you all love you all that's 40 minute sermon right there praise God I knew it was going to be short
