[0:00] 26 is our text.
[0:03] Now, tonight by God's grace, u for the
[0:06] kids Bible study, you of course we'll
[0:08] take questions and answers, but uh I
[0:10] like to go through the bride age. Sister
[0:12] Naomi and I were talking about that in
[0:13] the parking lot a couple months ago. I
[0:15] made a video on the bride age. You know,
[0:17] there's six quotes about uh the bride
[0:19] age from God's prophet, Brother
[0:21] Brandham. And so, I'd like to uh maybe
[0:24] teach on that tonight uh by God's grace.
[0:30] So, look forward to that uh by the grace
[0:32] of the Lord. And then I'll get back to
[0:34] angels maybe on uh Wednesday, Lord
[0:37] willing,
[0:38] by God's grace. Matthew 11:25
[0:42] and 26. We're looking at God hiding
[0:44] himself in simplicity and revealing
[0:46] himself in the same. That's the full
[0:48] title from March uh of 1963. Brother Ram
[0:51] preached this series on the seven seals.
[0:55] Now last time we looked at the
[0:56] importance of uh teaching. Brother Ram
[0:58] said the greatest sermons he ever he
[0:59] ever had a part of was the sermons on
[1:02] the seven seals. He called it a great
[1:04] teaching. He told us not to add to it.
[1:06] Don't add our interpretation. Then he
[1:08] said if you got something different idea
[1:10] that doesn't pertain to salvation. He
[1:11] said that won't hurt a bit. You know he
[1:13] said uh a lot of your lot a lot of the
[1:15] questions came after u the rapture and
[1:18] so forth regarding the Jews and the
[1:20] tribulation and Daniel 70 weeks and so
[1:22] forth. So, we looked at that and saw the
[1:24] importance of teaching. It's so
[1:26] important uh to teach the word of God.
[1:28] Hallelujah. Just like think in your
[1:30] life, it's so important for you to learn
[1:32] your job or so important for you to
[1:34] learn how to be a good father or mother
[1:36] or a husband or a wife. Like we need
[1:38] constant teaching in order to be the
[1:41] people God's called us to be.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Jesus said, "Teach
[1:45] them." He said, "And I'll be with you
[1:46] all the way to the end of the world."
[1:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Teaching them to observe all their
[1:50] commands. Now friends, if we're honest,
[1:52] we've all got commands we can learn to
[1:54] obey. Hallelujah. Brother Jesse
[1:56] included. Hallelujah. All God's people
[1:57] included, but uh we're getting closer to
[2:00] the coming of the Lord. No man knows the
[2:01] day or the hour, but we'll keep pressing
[2:03] on by the grace of God. Hallelujah.
[2:05] Mark, I'm sorry. Matthew 11:25-26.
[2:08] I'll read 25, then we can all read 26.
[2:11] And at that time Jesus answered and
[2:13] said, I thank thee, oh father, Lord of
[2:15] heaven and earth, because thou hast hid
[2:18] these things from the wise and prudent,
[2:20] and hast revealed them unto babes.
[2:24] Hallelujah. So we can see how God sees
[2:26] us, right? God sees us as his young
[2:28] children.
[2:30] Let's read 26. One, two, three. Even so,
[2:33] father, for it seemed good in thy sight.
[2:36] I'm sorry. May God add his blessing to
[2:38] ring his word. You can be seated there.
[2:41] The word babe there in the Greek means
[2:43] an infant, a little child.
[2:47] Childish or unttaught, unskilled. Is
[2:50] that how you feel sometimes? Even as a
[2:53] Christian, I'm just I'm just like a
[2:55] child. I don't have the skills I'd like
[2:57] to have. I'm so immature. I wish I was
[3:00] more mature.
[3:01] But you're not alone because Jesus said
[3:03] all of his children are like that.
[3:04] Hallelujah. We're not the wise and the
[3:06] prudent. The wise means you're an
[3:08] expert.
[3:09] You're learned. You are a uh he said one
[3:12] you're a philosopher. You're a orator.
[3:14] You're a theologian. You've got the best
[3:17] plans and the best means for executing
[3:20] out all your plans. And God Jesus said
[3:22] God hides it from those wise people,
[3:25] right? Talking about worldly wisdom.
[3:27] Prudent means intelligent uh having
[3:30] understanding, wise and learn. So the
[3:33] worldly wise and the worldly prudent,
[3:36] God has hid it from them. Hallelujah.
[3:38] because they don't want it. They don't
[3:40] want the simplicity of God's word, but
[3:42] God reveals it to the babes such as
[3:45] would learn. Hallelujah. So, uh, let's
[3:48] look at this thought here. And I'm going
[3:49] to watch my time again. If we have two
[3:51] services, I think in the past I used to
[3:53] preach just an hour. So, we'll see that.
[3:55] And I prove that on Wednesday nights, I
[3:56] can preach just an hour, sometimes 45
[3:59] minutes. Hallelujah. So, we can do it.
[4:01] All things are possible to them that
[4:02] believe in it. But uh remember we preach
[4:05] in this series through God I'm sorry
[4:07] recognizing your day in his message
[4:08] which brother Ram says our day is
[4:10] Leodysa it's the last church age we
[4:12] recognize God sent uh the seventh church
[4:15] age messenger the seventh angel brother
[4:17] Brandham is God's prophet to finish the
[4:19] mystery of God. Second was serpent seed
[4:21] where God originates this in Genesis
[4:23] 3:15 but now it's a spiritual seed. It
[4:26] started as a natural seed but now the
[4:29] two seeds are spiritual. Satan's seed
[4:31] and God's seed. Hallelujah. And the way
[4:33] you know God's seed is you take
[4:35] everything back to the word of God. If
[4:36] you're God's seed, you'll take
[4:38] everything back to the word
[4:39] &gt;&gt; because the word of God is a seed.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As Jesus said in the book of
[4:44] Luke,
[4:45] the word is a seed. Hallelujah. And then
[4:48] we looked at perfect faith, which is uh
[4:50] perfect faith is just revelation of the
[4:52] will of God. You know the will of God
[4:54] and you so you can have perfect faith in
[4:56] the will of God. Hallelujah. Then we
[4:59] looked at the breach. how Revelation 4
[5:01] and 5 is the breach between the church
[5:03] ages, Revelations 1, 2, and 3, and the
[5:06] seven seals, Revelation 6, hallelujah,
[5:08] and then Revelation chapter 8. And so we
[5:11] see that the it is the lamb's redemption
[5:15] uh that happened, right? The lamb went
[5:16] and took the book and then the book was
[5:19] sent down in Revelation chapter 10 to a
[5:21] seventh angel and then we're to eat the
[5:23] book and prophesy it again. Now, uh
[5:26] that's what we see today, right? The
[5:27] Bible said the book is sweet in your
[5:29] mouth. So, it's wonderful to talk about
[5:31] and testify, but then it's bitter in
[5:33] your belly. It's hard to deal with the
[5:36] persecution. It's hard to even obey all
[5:38] of it. Hallelujah.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; Because you have this inner war. There's
[5:41] a constant war in your members, the
[5:43] Bible says.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; So, it's wonderful to sing about it.
[5:46] Great to sing about it. And it's so good
[5:47] to testify and praise God about it. But
[5:50] when it starts getting deeper part of
[5:52] you, it becomes bitter. There's
[5:54] challenges to obeying the word of God.
[5:56] Hallelujah. But God will give us grace.
[5:58] Amen. Every child, it's been like that
[6:00] for every single child of God. But we
[6:02] can overcome. We just got to keep eating
[6:04] the book. Hallelujah.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; We just got to deal with the digestion.
[6:07] Hallelujah. Amen. Then we looked at the
[6:10] message of grace. God's amazing grace
[6:12] for all of his children. Uh and then
[6:14] double grace at the end time. The Bible
[6:16] said the headstone comes with shouting,
[6:18] crying grace, grace unto it. So we see
[6:21] there's extra grace at the end time. And
[6:24] then we looked at the coming of the
[6:25] Lord, the the rapture mystery, the
[6:26] pre-tribulation rapture is scriptural
[6:28] and it's been more attacked recently.
[6:30] And I think it's because the foolish
[6:32] virgin or maybe even the makeelievers uh
[6:34] they feel bad they're going to be left
[6:36] behind, right? They they don't uh
[6:38] they're upset that Jesus is going to
[6:40] snatch away his bride and they they know
[6:42] in their conscious they know they're not
[6:44] ready for that.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; So they want to attack that. They want
[6:48] to get people to doubt that. And then
[6:50] that brings them into deception to not
[6:52] be ready to not watch and pray for the
[6:54] coming of the Lord because he comes like
[6:56] a thief in the night. No man knows the
[6:58] day or the hour.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; Right. And then we looking at God hiding
[7:01] himself in simplicity for four services.
[7:03] We we've only got through the
[7:05] introduction, the first hour of the
[7:07] sermon by God's grace. But here we go.
[7:10] Um we'll get into the his main thoughts
[7:13] here in just a moment, but I'm going to
[7:14] read a couple paragraphs. Now after he
[7:16] reads his text he makes this uh and he
[7:19] he quotes Isaiah 35 and brother Ram says
[7:22] though a fool shall not heir therein. He
[7:25] says it's so simple and we know that God
[7:28] is so great till we expect it to be some
[7:30] great something and we miss the simple
[7:32] things we stumble over simplicity.
[7:35] That's how we miss God is by stumbling
[7:37] over simplicity. God is so simple until
[7:40] the scholars of these days and all days
[7:43] miss him a million miles.
[7:47] So, Brother Ram says scholars in their
[7:49] ideas about God and the rapture are a
[7:52] million miles away.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; Right, church? That's why it's hard to
[7:57] have fellowship with denominational
[7:58] people sometimes if if they're so
[8:00] focused on their own thoughts and ideas.
[8:03] You can't have fellowship if our minds
[8:05] are a million miles away. We're thinking
[8:07] about the rapture. We're thinking about
[8:08] the Holy Ghost. We're thinking about
[8:10] Jesus coming. And they're thinking about
[8:12] trying to get the whole world to be
[8:13] Christians. Now, that's a nice thought,
[8:15] but that's a million miles away from the
[8:17] truth. The whole world is going to go
[8:19] into the Antichrist be system. That's
[8:22] the revival they're going to have. Now,
[8:24] we can pray for generational revivals
[8:26] like I have. Uh we could pray for like
[8:29] regional revivals, but there's going to
[8:30] be no national revival. I was even
[8:33] reading this week in the days of
[8:34] Hezekiah, even he even Hezekiah wrote
[8:37] all these letters out to Judah and
[8:40] northern Israel and most of the people
[8:42] laughed him to scorn. He wrote letters
[8:44] like he said, "Let's keep the feast.
[8:46] Let's have revival. Let's rededicate
[8:48] this house of God. Let's get our houses
[8:50] in order." And most of them laughed him
[8:52] to scorn. But the Bible said there was a
[8:54] small remnant that wanted to come back,
[8:56] get their lives cleaned out, wanted to
[8:58] destroy the altars. Hallelujah. wanted
[9:00] to take away the the grove places and
[9:02] the hive places where they worshiped and
[9:05] sacrificed children, all these things.
[9:07] But there was a small remnant. Thank God
[9:09] for that little remnant. Hallelujah.
[9:11] Amen.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; Even, you know, even a great man like
[9:13] Hezekiah, people wouldn't humble
[9:15] themselves and follow him. So, we're
[9:17] nobody great. So, why do we think lots
[9:19] of people are going to follow us? Amen.
[9:21] It's going to be a small Jesus said it's
[9:23] a little flock. Hallelujah. And so, God,
[9:25] help us to be strong. Whether small,
[9:27] great. Some churches are greater in
[9:29] number. But God, help us to be faithful
[9:31] and realize that the reality of the
[9:32] gospel comes in simplicity. Hallelujah.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Not something great and so far off with
[9:38] theology where he says they're a million
[9:40] miles away. Because in their intellects,
[9:43] they know that there's nothing like him
[9:45] so great, but in Revelation, he makes it
[9:48] so simple, they go plum over the top of
[9:50] it and miss it.
[9:53] Now, Brother Ram says this is right
[9:54] before he preaches the the seven seals.
[9:56] Remember he said, "Now study it all. And
[9:59] you people who are visiting here, when
[10:00] you go to your motel rooms, take these
[10:02] things and ponder over them. We don't
[10:04] have time to break it down as it should
[10:06] be broke down, but I want you to do it
[10:08] when you get to the hotel or wherever
[10:10] you're staying. Gather together and
[10:13] study over it." So, this is what I want
[10:16] you I mean, this is what this is my main
[10:17] theme over many, many years. The main
[10:20] thing, Brother Ram says, is get alone
[10:21] with God and study the sermons that
[10:24] you're hearing.
[10:25] So, brother Chris, I had a good question
[10:27] last week. You know, how many notes
[10:28] should I take? And I said, just take
[10:30] enough notes where you want to go and
[10:33] study that out further tomorrow,
[10:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Because that's what brother said. Take
[10:39] what you're hearing today, go study in
[10:41] your hotel rooms, he said, and God will
[10:43] reveal something to you.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; So, when you see me take notes when
[10:47] Simon's here or Brother Diggs or
[10:48] whoever, that's what I'm doing. I I'm
[10:50] not taking notes on everything, but I if
[10:52] I feel if I feel something like that's a
[10:54] thought, oo, that's something I I need
[10:56] to study that out, I'll write it down
[10:58] and then I'll look it over the next day.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Bam encourages that.
[11:04] Don't let these sermons just go in one
[11:06] ear and out the other.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[11:09] &gt;&gt; If God is in me, if God's in you, then
[11:12] and God's in every pastor, church, if
[11:14] God's in every pastor, then God's giving
[11:17] them thoughts for the the the people of
[11:19] God. And we're supposed to benefit from
[11:21] those thoughts.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh like remember Ephesians 4
[11:25] said it's for the equipping of the
[11:27] saints. So God sent brother Simon to
[11:29] equip you. And then Austin and Malachi
[11:31] were talking about how that helped them
[11:32] a couple weeks ago. Remember that
[11:35] it that's equipping you so you can be a
[11:37] better Christian. So brother Chris,
[11:40] that's my uh advice. Amen. My godly
[11:42] advice. Do like brother Brandham. Go
[11:45] write down what's most important and go
[11:47] study it in your room tonight.
[11:49] Hallelujah. Or tomorrow morning by God's
[11:52] grace. Study that out. Let that impact
[11:55] you. Take something from the scripture
[11:57] that God wants you to have.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Because that's what brother Brandham
[12:01] said.
[12:02] He said, "Ponder over that." So church,
[12:04] when was the last time, so let me just
[12:06] ask humbly. When was the last last time
[12:08] you pondered over something from a
[12:10] service? Hallelujah. That's what we
[12:13] should do. We should ponder over what's
[12:15] been said, take it back and and and look
[12:18] at the word of God and say, "How does
[12:20] this apply to me? How can this relate to
[12:23] my life? What was God wanting me to
[12:25] see?"
[12:26] &gt;&gt; And then in that, you'll see something
[12:28] greater that God wants you to have.
[12:31] Hallelujah. That's supposed to be like
[12:32] the first the first step. And then you
[12:35] in your own studies, you go home and
[12:37] study that out and God will show you
[12:39] something. In other words, the idea,
[12:40] remember we preached on it last year.
[12:41] The idea is to meditate on the things of
[12:44] God. Actually, it might have been this
[12:45] year. I looked at all the meditation
[12:46] verses from David in the spring. That's
[12:49] what he wants us to do. Now, there's so
[12:51] many things that will take our
[12:53] attention, but God wants us to meditate
[12:55] on him.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ram says, "Go study
[13:00] on this." Now, church, I've done this
[13:01] with the seven seals because I preached
[13:03] over 125, last time I counted sermons.
[13:05] Now, this is over the last 15 years. I
[13:08] think I started in 2010 preaching on
[13:10] this the re the book of Revelation. But
[13:13] for every one of those services, I'd sit
[13:14] in my study, think it over, pray about
[13:17] it. What does this mean here? Well, how
[13:19] can that fit in here? And you just
[13:21] ponder over it, and God will reveal more
[13:23] of it by his grace. And then we won't go
[13:26] off into some false idea or some false
[13:29] doctrine or something like that. We
[13:31] won't be led astray, but we'll be led
[13:33] further into the word of God.
[13:37] We don't want to miss him a million
[13:38] miles,
[13:41] &gt;&gt; right? And I don't know if you saw it.
[13:43] My wife shared it with me. The White
[13:44] House a couple weeks ago put out let's
[13:46] pray or let's have peace and safety.
[13:47] Now, does that sound familiar to
[13:49] anybody?
[13:50] &gt;&gt; That's 1 Thessalonians chapter 5. When
[13:52] the world is saying peace and safety,
[13:54] then come sudden destruction. That's
[13:56] speaking of the tribulation period. But
[13:58] look that that that phrase is already in
[14:00] use by the white house which is
[14:02] controlled by the mystery Babylon,
[14:05] right? The mother harlot, right? Because
[14:08] this is the beast out of the land. She's
[14:10] the beast out of the sea, right? But
[14:11] then that beast changes form or the same
[14:13] evil spirits in the beast out of the
[14:14] land. So they're already getting the
[14:17] wording of it. Now church, what we want
[14:18] is peace and safety in the Holy Ghost.
[14:20] Hallelujah. Yes, we appreciate natural
[14:22] peace and none of us want to go through
[14:24] trials and suffering or persecution, but
[14:27] our greatest desire should be that the
[14:29] will of God be done in our lives.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there are, just so you
[14:34] know, the beast is already picking up
[14:36] that language, peace and safety. I tried
[14:38] to find the actual post this morning. I
[14:40] couldn't find it on the drive to church,
[14:42] but uh maybe my wife if maybe I just got
[14:44] to go look in my text with my wife. I'll
[14:45] try to find that by God's grace just so
[14:47] you can see it.
[14:50] He says, 'Now study that.' He says, 'Y
[14:51] yeah, go to your hotel rooms, study it
[14:53] out.
[14:56] So think about that, church. The
[14:57] Catholic scholars and the Protestant
[14:59] scholars miss it by a million miles
[15:01] because who are they looking to unite
[15:03] with? The current Pope Leo. That that's
[15:05] who they think is going to help unite,
[15:08] &gt;&gt; you know, and God bless Charlie Kirk,
[15:09] but Charlie Kirk put the post out, you
[15:11] know, and I love Charlie Kirk, but he
[15:13] even him in his his understanding, he
[15:15] said, "We have a new pope to enter in a
[15:17] new era of Christianity." Now, I'm
[15:20] adding my own idea, but God rest his
[15:22] soul. I believe he's saved. But that was
[15:24] his thought. That that's as far as he'd
[15:27] been taught. And church, think about
[15:29] that. That's off a million miles,
[15:32] right? Think about that. And and think
[15:36] and think now, think about all the
[15:37] scholars and all these things. Think
[15:39] about all the denominations. They're off
[15:41] a million miles and church. And and look
[15:44] and think they're think spiritually now.
[15:46] They're driving still further away from
[15:48] the truth. They're further getting away
[15:50] while God has brought you to the truth.
[15:52] Hallelujah.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, you're not millions of
[15:55] miles away. You're right here in the
[15:57] presence of God. Amen. With the Bible,
[16:00] with thus sayith the Lord. Hallelujah.
[16:02] With a modern day prophet. Hallelujah.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; With tapes, sermons recorded pointing us
[16:07] to the word of God.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Like, in other words, we're not looking
[16:11] for a woman president to rise up. We're
[16:13] looking for Christ to rise up in the
[16:15] bride. Amen. Amen.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; We're looking for the bride to rise up.
[16:18] Hallelujah.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; They got the different ideas, church.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; But see, this ought to make us so
[16:24] thankful. And I'm thankful again,
[16:26] brother says, I'm thankful for every
[16:27] Catholic or Protestant who's saved. If
[16:29] any man or woman is trusting in the
[16:31] blood of Jesus Christ, they will be
[16:33] saved.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Few there be that find the
[16:36] narrow road."
[16:38] &gt;&gt; Thank God, church, we're not a million
[16:40] miles away, but we're right in the
[16:43] middle of the road. I'm sorry. Not
[16:44] perfectly, but we're close to the middle
[16:46] of the road. Hallelujah. Amen.
[16:50] Brother Ram said they miss him by the
[16:52] way that he reveals himself. Now,
[16:54] church, how's he going to reveal himself
[16:56] in the word?
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he might use a dream, brother
[16:59] Chris, brother Jose, he might use
[17:00] something, a dream or vision, but that
[17:03] vision and dream will always line up
[17:04] with the word of God.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; When I was raised in Pentecostal church,
[17:08] how did he reveal himself to me when I
[17:10] went to the Bible studies? Because the
[17:12] truths I was taught are the same from
[17:14] Genesis to Revelation. He's one God. The
[17:17] water baptism, the serpent seed. That's
[17:19] what first struck my eyes. Oh, I can see
[17:21] that from Genesis. There's two seeds
[17:23] from Genesis to Revelation. That's the
[17:25] first thing that opened my How did he
[17:27] reveal himself? Through the word of God.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Just a simple way. Like you can sit in a
[17:32] Bible study. You don't have to sit in a
[17:34] church uh with stained glass windows to
[17:36] hear God. You can meet God in a simple
[17:38] room like this with just painted walls
[17:40] and a couple pictures up on the wall.
[17:42] You can meet God in a simple place with
[17:44] this. Yes, that's how we always meet
[17:46] God. Hallelujah.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Is in simplicity. Brother Ram says it
[17:49] over and over again in this series. He
[17:50] says, "Look at Jesus. Where did they
[17:52] have to receive him? In a stable.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; He was a baby in a stable." That's how
[17:58] simple God was. Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; He put his own son. He put his own uh
[18:02] image, his own body, his own temple that
[18:05] he created. It wasn't revealed in some
[18:07] great mystical church or some great
[18:09] scene. It was humility in a baby.
[18:12] Hallelujah.
[18:14] &gt;&gt; And look how many people missed it.
[18:16] Almost everybody missed it. Amen. If it
[18:19] wasn't for the angels, the shepherds
[18:21] would have missed it. They all would
[18:22] have missed it. But God let the elect
[18:24] hear the word of God and have the
[18:26] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; The same is true today. Hallelujah.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; You'll find him in a little humble
[18:34] church in Akran, Ohio. Hallelujah.
[18:36] Or Napoleon, Ohio. Or Ankenne, Iowa.
[18:39] Hallelujah. Wherever it may be.
[18:42] Hallelujah. Up in Sheffield, Ohio.
[18:44] You'll find God hiding himself in
[18:46] simplicity.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; He's so great, yet he hides himself to
[18:51] make himself known to the least.
[18:55] So remember church, always remember,
[18:56] we're not the greatest, we're the least.
[18:59] That's what Brother Ram says. He makes
[19:00] himself known to the least. But some
[19:02] people call themselves the greatest. We
[19:04] can see they're breaking this quote. He
[19:06] said, "Don't try to get the great
[19:09] because he goes over the top of it, but
[19:12] listen to the simplicity of God and then
[19:14] you find God right here in the simple
[19:17] way."
[19:19] Hallelujah. So God reveals himself to
[19:22] the least and he reveals himself to a
[19:24] simple group of people.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, simple like, "Brother
[19:28] Jesse, just show me that in the Bible.
[19:29] I'll believe it." That's simple.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't have to give you a
[19:33] miracle. I don't have to prove this or
[19:35] do that. You don't have to do that. God
[19:37] revealed himself in the simplicity of
[19:39] the word of God.
[19:41] Hallelujah.
[19:43] Now, I want to get to this next thought.
[19:44] There's two more uh paragraphs here and
[19:46] then we'll get to where he starts
[19:47] preaching finally after about I think
[19:49] it's about 58 minutes or hour and some
[19:52] minutes here. The next thing brother
[19:55] said, "High polished worldly wisdom
[19:57] educated always misses him." He says,
[20:01] "And I know there's school teachers, two
[20:03] or three that I know sitting in here.
[20:05] And I'm not here to contradict school
[20:07] and education and try to support
[20:09] illiteratess.
[20:11] I'm not here for that." But what it is,
[20:13] the people have placed so much on that
[20:15] until even the seminaries, they're
[20:17] missing the very thing that God has put
[20:20] before them.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; So, Brother B is clear. You know,
[20:23] education is not bad. Education is only
[20:26] bad when they try to take you away from
[20:28] the word of God.
[20:30] Hallelujah. That's the only time it's
[20:31] bad. Like I said, I'm glad the doctors
[20:33] that saved my wife and Tulsi were
[20:36] educated.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; I will forever be grateful for their
[20:39] education.
[20:41] But when you go to college and they try
[20:43] to instill woke uh indoctrination and
[20:46] you try to tell you lies that there's no
[20:48] God and evolution, that's from hell.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; That's the education that's from the
[20:53] devil.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know how much you get in middle
[20:55] school, Anna. I don't know how much you
[20:57] y'all get in high school, but you should
[20:59] be able to tell if you got the spirit of
[21:00] God, you'll be able to sense that right
[21:02] away. That's wrong. They're trying to
[21:03] give me some lie. I'm only going to take
[21:05] the truth. Amen. I won't be educated in
[21:07] lies. I'm going to be educated by the
[21:09] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like Jesus said, "Come and learn
[21:13] of me." Learning is not a bad word.
[21:15] Learning is a good word because that's
[21:16] what happens when you get revelation.
[21:18] You learn the understanding of God's
[21:20] word.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:25] So, see, there's nothing wrong with
[21:26] education because he says there's two or
[21:27] three school teachers in Brandham
[21:29] Tabernacle. Well, we got one here today.
[21:31] Hallelujah. He's the one preaching.
[21:34] He said that that's why I'm not against
[21:35] the brethren who are the denominations.
[21:37] I'm against the system of denominations
[21:40] because it tries to magnify itself and
[21:43] educate its ministers to such a place
[21:45] till they don't have to have the proper
[21:48] until if they don't have the proper
[21:50] schooling education, they're ousted.
[21:52] They have to stand the psychiatrist test
[21:54] and so forth. I never think that was
[21:57] God's will to test a minister by
[21:59] psychiatry, but to test him by the word
[22:03] of God.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; So listen, church, that that's that's
[22:07] how we know who's called to preach. It's
[22:09] not how much education they have, it's
[22:12] how much revelation they have.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Even like I've said, you know, all of
[22:16] our brothers in here, some of you may be
[22:18] called to preach in the future. The way
[22:20] we know you'd be called is because you
[22:22] stay with the word of God.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Not because of how nice you can talk,
[22:26] how loud you can get, how emotional you
[22:28] can get. That has nothing to do with it.
[22:31] It has to do with your revelation of the
[22:34] word of God.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; You don't add to the word of God. You
[22:38] don't take away. If there's an error you
[22:40] don't understand, you just say, "This is
[22:41] my opinion. This is why I think this. I
[22:43] could be wrong." You just humble
[22:45] yourself. Because the Bible said
[22:47] teachers offend in all many things. We
[22:49] looked at that, remember last time in
[22:51] James,
[22:51] &gt;&gt; teachers will be judged more harshly.
[22:54] I'm going to be judged more harshly. So,
[22:56] I want to be open to correction. You and
[22:57] I want to be open to correction.
[22:59] Hallelujah.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; He says it tries to magnify itself. He
[23:07] says, "Test a preacher by the word."
[23:09] See? See, it's just the word would be
[23:12] God's way of testing his men that he
[23:14] sent out to have the word preach the
[23:16] word. Hallelujah.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; So, I'm thankful uh friends by God's
[23:22] grace. And remember, church, brother
[23:24] Brandham didn't bring Sister Ma, Joseph,
[23:27] Rebecca, and Becky, as far as I know.
[23:30] Sarah, I'm sorry, Sarah. Brother Ram
[23:32] left them in Arizona to get their what?
[23:35] Education. That's how much brother
[23:37] Random appreciated his children being
[23:40] educated. And and and children, we want
[23:42] you to be educated so you can read your
[23:44] Bible.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; And then you if you have children, you
[23:48] can teach your children the Bible.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; And then if you have a job where you
[23:51] have to read like I do, you can read. I
[23:53] got to read and follow these directions,
[23:55] right? At my job, things I got to teach.
[23:58] So at your job, you can do a good
[24:00] example as a Christian. You can read,
[24:02] you can write, you can uh you can have
[24:04] logic, right? You can understand right
[24:06] and wrong. You can defend what you
[24:08] believe. Amen. Hallelujah. That's the
[24:11] benefit of education.
[24:13] And brother Ram left his wife and
[24:15] children and they missed out on the
[24:17] revelation of the seven seals physically
[24:21] because brother so highly valued
[24:23] education.
[24:25] All right. Everybody can see that. Is
[24:26] that okay? By God's grace. Is that fine?
[24:29] I got 40 minutes left. Hallelujah.
[24:32] Now, now let's finally get brother takes
[24:34] this text. He finally starts preaching.
[24:36] Now, is anybody listening to this
[24:38] lately? Raise your hand if you listen to
[24:39] God hiding himself. Nobody's listening
[24:40] to it lately. Okay. All right. That's
[24:42] that's fine. Hopefully, you're in the
[24:43] church age book or something by God's
[24:45] grace. Stay in stay in the message
[24:46] somehow. The revelations God gave to
[24:48] brother Brandon. But the first character
[24:50] he brings up in God hiding himself in
[24:52] simplicity. Any guesses? He's going to
[24:54] start in Genesis, Noah.
[24:57] That surprise anybody?
[25:00] He says Noah lived in such a educated
[25:03] time. He said the pyramids proved it.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; The pyramids survived the flood.
[25:09] He said uh the embalming of ancient
[25:12] Egypt and their mummies. He said those
[25:14] are the two examples he gave. He said
[25:16] that technology showed they're further
[25:18] advanced than we were in some ways. I
[25:21] don't know in all the ways, but they
[25:23] were further advanced in numerous ways
[25:25] than we are. And brother Ram said there
[25:27] was hardly any illiteracy among them at
[25:30] all. Think about that. They're so smart
[25:31] to make the pyramids and embalm uh the
[25:34] bodies and make them last till they're
[25:36] still in pretty good shape today.
[25:39] He said there wasn't hardly any
[25:41] illiteracy at all. But yeah, church,
[25:44] what do we find? Only eight were
[25:46] actually saved.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; See, church, that's why you can never
[25:50] trust your wisdom to know that you're
[25:52] saved. You can only trust in the blood
[25:54] of Jesus Christ.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Think of that. The Bible said the whole
[25:58] earth was filled, right? And God looked
[26:00] down from heaven and the Bible said it
[26:02] grieved him to actually see it. He knew
[26:05] what happened, but it grieved him and he
[26:06] said, "I regret that I even made man."
[26:09] It was such an awful time. And remember,
[26:11] that's to be repeated in this day.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; As it was the days of Noah, so shall be
[26:17] in the days of the coming of the Son of
[26:18] Man. So, how many people really are
[26:20] saved out there? Very few. Thank God
[26:23] you're one of the few. Hallelujah,
[26:25] church. Thank God you're not a million
[26:27] miles away from the truth, but you're
[26:29] right here near it.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; God has driven you right to the truth.
[26:33] Hallelujah. And you can find it. That's
[26:36] what I see in my life. God led me here.
[26:38] Right. Just like Jesus, he went looking.
[26:40] He left the 99. He went looking and he
[26:43] brought me in. The Bible said he lifted
[26:45] me up, put me on his shoulders, and he
[26:47] carried me and brought me to the
[26:49] sheepfold. And the church said he did
[26:51] the same for you. He went looking for
[26:53] you until he found you. And then he
[26:55] carried you on his strongest part of his
[26:56] body. He brought you to him. It's God's
[26:59] strength that brought you to the truth.
[27:01] It's God looking for you that brought
[27:02] you here today. You're here because of
[27:04] the love of the good shepherd.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Glory. Amen. I did not
[27:11] go looking for him. He came looking for
[27:13] me. Right?
[27:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "God, searching through that
[27:19] great economy at their day in their
[27:21] systems could not find the right type of
[27:24] man until he found an illiterate maybe
[27:28] farmer by the name of Noah." So he
[27:31] bypassed all those wise engineers. My we
[27:33] can make this pyramid, that one, the
[27:35] Sphinx. We can embalm bodies like this.
[27:37] They had their laboratories, their
[27:38] modern day, I'm sorry, their modern day
[27:41] laboratories for their day. And brother
[27:42] Ram said, "God looked in there, couldn't
[27:44] find anybody to save. He finds Noah out
[27:47] here, and we'd say an illiterate farmer.
[27:50] He's just a farmer. He's just average.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; He's less than average.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; He ain't even mediocre.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Does farming in any wise compare to
[28:02] pyramids as far as greatness?" Uh, what
[28:05] do you do? Uh, I just I just farm. I
[28:07] plant seeds and I harvest. Oh, mean you
[28:10] don't build pyramids. You don't build uh
[28:12] structures that are hundreds of feet
[28:14] tall and uh have these huge blocks of
[28:17] many many tons that take superpowers to
[28:20] move. You don't do that. No, I just take
[28:23] care of sheep.
[28:25] I just take care of animals. That's all
[28:26] I do. And I I plant things. Which one
[28:29] did God choose? The humble one.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; That's why we know, church, he's chosen
[28:34] you.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why we know we have
[28:37] confidence. He could have chose us
[28:39] because we're nothing.
[28:41] We're the least. He didn't go to the
[28:42] greatest. He went to the least.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. Amen. I thought this
[28:48] might encourage somebody today.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; I think it is. Hallelujah.
[28:54] He said he found a illiterate farmer,
[28:56] maybe Noah, a sheep herder, and gave him
[28:59] a message to preach to the people that
[29:01] was so simple to their scholarships of
[29:04] that day until the people stumbled over
[29:06] the simplicity of the message. You mean
[29:08] God's going to destroy all these cities
[29:10] we built? God's going to destroy all
[29:12] these instruments and God's going to
[29:14] kill all these animals and all we got to
[29:16] do is get into the ark to be saved.
[29:18] That's it. That's your message for
[29:21] today. And Noah's like, "Yes, that's
[29:23] thus sayaith the Lord. I mean, surely
[29:26] God's a loving God, Noah. Look at all
[29:28] these people. Look at all these
[29:29] children. Look at all these mothers.
[29:31] Look at all these beautiful animals. I
[29:33] mean, surely God's not going to do that.
[29:34] I mean surely we can just have our own
[29:36] civilization and we can just keep going
[29:38] on serving God the way we are. No, God
[29:41] had one way that was thus sayeth the
[29:43] Lord.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; A simple humble way. And church, there's
[29:48] one way out of the tribulation and
[29:50] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[29:52] Amen. There's only one way out of it.
[29:54] You must be born again. Jesus says,
[29:57] &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah. Thank God for the ark of
[30:00] Jesus Christ." Hallelujah.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; He's the way out. Hallelujah. He's our
[30:04] ark today. Praise God.
[30:09] He said the people stumbled over the
[30:10] simplicity.
[30:13] You mean we've got to all anyone who
[30:15] wants to be saved has to join your
[30:16] church? Now, we'll never get to that
[30:18] point, church, because we know it's a
[30:19] universal rapture.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; I'm never going to get to that and
[30:22] isolate myself or be elitist or anything
[30:25] like that. We know we're nothing. But if
[30:27] we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[30:28] we've got the token for the rapture.
[30:31] But in Noah's day, it was get in my
[30:33] church or you're not going to make it.
[30:35] For us, it's get in my savior, Jesus, or
[30:38] you're not going to make it.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; It's not about the church. It's not
[30:41] about a physical church. It's about the
[30:43] spiritual church. It's the body of Jesus
[30:45] Christ. Hallelujah. It's the bride. It's
[30:48] those who are born again. It's those who
[30:50] are in Christ and Christ is in them.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:56] Brother Ram said, "Yet in the message
[30:58] yet his message in the face of science
[31:01] was radical."
[31:04] Isn't that the Isn't that the same as us
[31:06] today? We're going to go in a rapture.
[31:08] God's going to change people's molecules
[31:11] around the world, some daytime, some
[31:13] nighttime, in the moment, in the twink
[31:15] of an eye, and they're just going to
[31:17] vanish away. Brother Jesse, yes. Our
[31:19] message is radical
[31:22] &gt;&gt; because that's what First Thessalonians
[31:23] 4 says. Hallelujah. That's what First
[31:27] Corinthians 15 says. It's a shout,
[31:29] voice, trump. Hallelujah. The dead in
[31:32] Christ will rise first. They'll meet
[31:34] Christ in the air. And then we which are
[31:36] alive and remain shall be snatched up
[31:39] and meet the Lord in the air at the last
[31:42] trump.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; It's radical. It just doesn't sound like
[31:45] like it's possible.
[31:48] But yet it's the truth. He said, "How
[31:50] could there be rain in the skies in
[31:52] those day when there was no rain up
[31:54] there? It just it didn't make logical
[31:57] sense. How could people be raptured all
[32:00] around the world? Doesn't make any
[32:02] sense. And meet up in the sky. Which
[32:04] sky?
[32:05] Eastern? Western? Which sky? Northern?
[32:08] It just doesn't make sense to them. It
[32:10] don't have to make sense to us. We just
[32:12] believe it
[32:14] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says it. Hallelujah.
[32:18] It's a simple message of building an
[32:20] ark, constructing of something to get
[32:22] into that there's no water to float it.
[32:25] Okay? There's no water. There's no rain
[32:28] uh in the sky. There's there's no water.
[32:31] This doesn't make any sense.
[32:35] See, but he became a fanatic
[32:38] and become what we would call he said,
[32:40] excuse the expression, an oddball.
[32:43] See, the message will always make you an
[32:46] oddball to the smart, intelligent
[32:48] people.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; You're just going to be different,
[32:51] church. Just get used to being
[32:53] different, especially our sisters. And
[32:55] may God give them an extra great reward.
[32:57] I pray. Brother Ram has one quote about
[32:59] it. He doesn't doesn't give a scripture.
[33:00] He said because the women have to uh
[33:03] look so different from the women of
[33:04] today, he said they'll get a greater
[33:06] reward. I hope that's true. I'm still
[33:08] looking for that scripture, brother
[33:09] Mercy. Hallelujah. Because then I can
[33:11] encourage my wife and my girls and all
[33:12] the all the girls here. Uh I hope they
[33:15] get a greater reward if they sacrifice
[33:17] more. God knows hallelujah. God knows
[33:19] how to do it.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; It just looks so radical. And we and the
[33:25] the believer of every day becomes a
[33:28] fanatic to everybody else.
[33:31] An oddball. And nearly all God's people
[33:34] are oddballs. He says, "I'm glad to be
[33:36] one of them.
[33:38] They're different from the modern trend
[33:40] of civilization. So, they become odd and
[33:43] strange. Let me just say this. Brother
[33:44] Rod loves how uh we dress up here at our
[33:47] church. You ever see Rod? He's got that
[33:49] suit and tie on. He's from the old the
[33:51] old uh the old Pentecost way.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; He's like, "You should wear he's he's
[33:56] like, "Brother Jesse, I love how your
[33:58] people wear their best clothes. You
[33:59] should wear your best clothes to
[34:00] church." Praise God.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; It it's so different, right? Because now
[34:04] they go in jeans with holes in them and
[34:07] and uh shorts and hair all over the
[34:10] place. They don't even bother to comb
[34:11] their hair. Shirt just t-shirts, regular
[34:14] t-shirts and and flipflops on if they
[34:18] wear that. It just it's a total
[34:21] disgrace, right? It's not it's not the
[34:24] attitude like I'm coming where judgment
[34:26] is going to start. Judgment begins at
[34:28] the house of God.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Think about church. How would you dress
[34:32] if the judge you're going to see a judge
[34:34] and he had your life in his hands? How
[34:37] would you dress? I would get I'd get
[34:39] everything in order to make it look like
[34:40] I cared, like I wanted mercy from that
[34:43] judge.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But see, that's just one
[34:47] example of how we'll always be the
[34:49] oddballs.
[34:51] We take church as, yes, it's a place of
[34:53] grace. It's also a place to be
[34:55] corrected.
[34:57] We're getting judgments from the judge,
[34:59] the Lord Jesus Christ, not me. I just
[35:01] preach the judgments he shows me, but I
[35:03] can't preach all of it. So, God's got to
[35:05] send four other gifts in here.
[35:06] Hallelujah. Now, we need some more
[35:08] apostles. I'll tell you that. Amen. And
[35:09] we need some minor prophets. We
[35:11] definitely need that. Hallelujah. But,
[35:14] uh, the Bible said there's there's
[35:15] different kinds of gifts, right? And
[35:17] there's different measures of gifts.
[35:19] Some people are greater, some some less.
[35:21] Hallelujah.
[35:25] So see all God's people, he said they're
[35:28] they're a peculiar people,
[35:31] he said, a spiritual priesthood, a royal
[35:34] nation offering spiritual sacrifices to
[35:37] God, the fruit of their lips, giving
[35:39] praise to a name. Uh if you got your
[35:41] Bibles, pick them up. First Peter 2:9,
[35:43] pardon me. So let's read these verses.
[35:46] Brother's laying a foundation with Noah.
[35:49] This is what we are. This is what we're
[35:51] called to do. Give God praise.
[35:55] Worship him. Pray. Center your life
[35:58] around the word of God. Don't let
[36:00] anything take you away from the word of
[36:02] God.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; And your office as a king and priest
[36:07] unto God. Don't let anything ever take
[36:09] you away from that.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Like over the years, like I said, over
[36:13] the years, you know, we we see when
[36:15] people fall away, the first thing they
[36:16] do is they stop coming Sunday night.
[36:18] Then they stop coming Wednesday night
[36:20] and then they're hardly there on Sunday.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; See, they've left. They've forgotten
[36:25] that God called us to be a royal
[36:29] priesthood.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But be ye a chosen
[36:34] generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
[36:36] nation, a peculiar people, that ye
[36:39] should shoe forth the praises of him who
[36:42] has called you out of darkness into his
[36:45] marvelous light. All right. Now, this is
[36:46] making me think of a scripture here. So,
[36:49] just keep that up there, hun just a
[36:50] second.
[36:53] See, you're a chosen generation. So, God
[36:55] chose you to be a priesthood. And
[36:58] priests offer praise. Priests offer
[37:01] sacrifices.
[37:03] Yes, it's a sacrifice to come to House
[37:05] of God. Yes, it's a sacrifice to get
[37:07] cleaned up and dressed up. But that's
[37:09] what God called you to do. God called
[37:11] you to come here to intercede for the
[37:13] lost
[37:14] &gt;&gt; and also keep yourself lined up with the
[37:16] word of God. Amen. Hallelujah. To keep
[37:20] myself, all of us, we're called, that's
[37:23] our duty.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; That's our our purpose in life is to be
[37:28] a spiritual priesthood. If nobody else
[37:30] will come to the house of God, if nobody
[37:32] else will worship and take this serely,
[37:34] I will because I'm part of this
[37:36] priesthood. Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; If nobody else will lay at the altar, if
[37:41] nobody else will fast and pray or give
[37:42] arms, if nobody else will do that, I'll
[37:45] do it because I'm part of the royal
[37:46] priesthood of God.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:51] And then we should show forth the
[37:53] praises of him. See, praising Jesus all
[37:55] the time who has called you. I'm
[37:57] thankful he called me out of darkness.
[37:59] I'm thankful to be a child of the light.
[38:01] I'm thankful to come to God's house. I'm
[38:04] thankful to praise his name. I'm
[38:06] thankful I can read the Bible. I'm
[38:07] thankful I can give God glory. I'm
[38:10] thankful that I'm walking in the light.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not walking in darkness. I'm not a
[38:15] child of darkness. I'm a child of light.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; It's a privilege of our lives to come to
[38:23] church and worship. Now, pull up um
[38:28] second 2 Chronicles 38. I just saw this
[38:32] yesterday and I highlighted these three
[38:33] steps.
[38:36] God just wants us to do three steps.
[38:37] Now, remember, I made a video and I
[38:39] preach on this about about King Ahaz
[38:42] abandoned the house of God. In other
[38:43] words, he shut the doors. Nobody went
[38:45] into worship. And I liken that unto
[38:47] Brennham Tabernacle, right? That was
[38:49] King Ahaz. I preached on abandoned. It
[38:51] was on a Wednesday night a couple months
[38:52] ago. It's got over 4,000 views, which
[38:55] kind of surprised me. Oh, yeah. And one
[38:57] preacher in South Africa even showed it
[38:59] to his entire church. He show and I I
[39:00] got the video of it if you want to see
[39:02] it. And everybody's clapping. and
[39:03] they're not clapping for me, but they're
[39:04] clapping because they're actually in
[39:06] church and they're not sitting home
[39:07] playing tapes. They weren't clapping for
[39:09] me. I'm nobody. But I was It was like a
[39:11] church of maybe four or 500. I was like,
[39:13] "Praise God, God knows how to get his
[39:15] word there, right?
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Of all the preachers,
[39:18] God used a little preacher in Akran,
[39:20] Ohio to encourage them to keep coming to
[39:22] church.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; And I don't even go to their church. I
[39:24] don't even know them." So, a brother
[39:25] sent me that link. I was like, "Glory."
[39:27] Uh 2 Chronicles uh 30:8, hun, there's a
[39:31] three-step process. 2 Chronicles 30:8.
[39:36] There's a three-step process in here.
[39:38] So, remember Hezekiah, remember the
[39:39] first thing he did was open the doors of
[39:42] the house of God. And then they took, I
[39:43] think it was 16 days to clean out
[39:45] everything in the house of God. They
[39:47] destroyed all the temples. They took all
[39:48] the unholy things out.
[39:51] And once they got it set up, he sent all
[39:53] these letters out, but only a little
[39:54] group came in to worship God. That was
[39:57] the revival group.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; You're the revival group.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; You know what revival means? Made alive.
[40:04] How many are alive today in Christ
[40:06] Jesus?
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not dead to Christ. I'm not dead uh
[40:09] to the Christ and loving the things of
[40:11] the world. No, I'm in love with Jesus.
[40:12] Amen. Am I fighting the good fight every
[40:14] day? Yes, I am. I'm fighting against the
[40:16] greatest battle ever fought in my mind.
[40:18] But I love Jesus. Hallelujah.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the light.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Now, look at these three three steps
[40:24] that Hezekiah or the Bible records. Now,
[40:27] be not stiff necked. In other words, sit
[40:29] at home as your fathers were, but yield.
[40:32] So, let's all say yield. Ready? Yield.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Yield yourselves unto the Lord. And
[40:36] let's all say enter. Ready? Enter. So,
[40:38] first you got to yield yourself and say,
[40:39] God, I'm taking your way, not my way.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; And then he says, enter into his
[40:45] sanctuary. So, first you got to yield,
[40:47] God. I'll do what you want. I'll enter
[40:49] in the sanctuary which he has sanctified
[40:52] forever. And here's the last one. Let's
[40:54] say it together. Ready? Serve.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Yield. enter the church and then serve
[41:00] God's purpose.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord your God that the
[41:04] fierceness of his wrath may turn away
[41:06] from you. Now, you've read your Bible
[41:08] enough. We don't need to go to the book
[41:09] of Acts, but you know in the book of
[41:10] Acts, they had to gather more as they
[41:12] saw that day approaching, right? After
[41:14] they were baptized, Acts chapter 2, it
[41:15] said they stayed with the apostles,
[41:17] their fellowship, their doctrine, the
[41:18] breaking of bread, communion, like we
[41:20] had last week. And the church said,
[41:22] &gt;&gt; "That's that's what we're doing. That's
[41:24] why we're trying to be like the book of
[41:25] Acts." But man said that the the true
[41:27] church will always try and strive to be
[41:29] like that original book of acts church.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; But this was a prefigure this was a
[41:36] prophecy or a type of what we do as
[41:38] well. We enter into the house or sorry
[41:40] we yield to God. We enter in and then
[41:43] say God how can I serve you?
[41:46] Hallelujah. And that's part of the
[41:48] mystery of God. The mystery of God's
[41:51] will for your life. How do you serve
[41:53] God? Well, we know attend church, pray,
[41:56] fast, give alms, pay tithe. We know all
[41:58] those things. But even outside of that,
[42:00] you need to find your service for the
[42:02] ministry of God.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe it's prayer. Maybe
[42:06] it's fasting, right? More fasting. Maybe
[42:08] it's uh the gift of faith, the gift of
[42:10] wisdom, the gift of miracles, right?
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Uh the gift of tongues, the gift of
[42:14] interpretation. Maybe it's one of those.
[42:16] Gift of discernment.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Gift of knowledge. And you
[42:20] got to find where are you called to
[42:22] serve.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Yield, enter, serve. Brother Chris,
[42:38] &gt;&gt; it seems uh sometimes, brother, they
[42:40] catch it when they're young and
[42:42] sometimes they catch it when they're
[42:43] older. It kind of all depends God's time
[42:45] or season. Like for example, Moses when
[42:47] he was born, there was he was a goodly
[42:49] child. There was some anointing on him
[42:50] kind of like brother Bram there was a
[42:51] there was a pillar of fire when he was
[42:52] born but he didn't actually get into
[42:54] that until he was 80 years old and then
[42:57] Abraham was the father of our faith and
[43:00] he did not get into his calling until he
[43:02] was 75
[43:04] right but then you got children like
[43:05] Solomon there was blessing on his life
[43:07] he was beloved of the Lord even from a
[43:08] child right uh I just saw Josiah started
[43:11] king when he was eight years old eight
[43:14] years old and yeah and but he was called
[43:17] for that so in other words. God has the
[43:19] mystery of your life and he'll manifest
[43:21] your gifts at just the right time.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God had to manifest my gifts
[43:26] when I was about what 21. They saw me
[43:28] doing Bible studies and Tim is like,
[43:29] "You need to preach, Jesse. You need to
[43:30] preach." I said, "Wait till I'm done
[43:31] with football. I can't do both at the
[43:33] same time." And then I finally yielded
[43:35] and the it's been history since, you
[43:37] know. And then, like I said, those two
[43:38] people always knew I'd be a preacher
[43:40] before I even knew I was going to be a
[43:41] before I even thought about preaching
[43:42] really. So, uh, the gifts and callings
[43:45] of God are without repentance. That's
[43:47] what Romans 11 says. You remember that
[43:49] one? Okay, let's read that. Romans
[43:51] chapter 11. Uh, the gifts and callings
[43:53] of God are without repentance and
[43:54] they'll activate in the right time and
[43:56] season of your life.
[44:05] Now, let me just use some examples in
[44:07] the church. I hope this is okay. Um,
[44:13] Romans 11.
[44:15] Now, yeah, it's verse uh let's start at
[44:18] 28 so brother Chris can get a little
[44:19] background. This is talking about how
[44:21] Israel is yet to be saved as a nation.
[44:24] But remember, there's only going to be
[44:25] 144,000 of them saved.
[44:28] Verse 28, as concerning the gospel, they
[44:30] are enemies for your sakes, but as
[44:32] touching the election, they are beloved
[44:34] for the father's sakes. So there's
[44:37] there's elected there's elected Jews,
[44:40] and that glorifies Abraham, Isaac, and
[44:42] Jacob, right? Because they stayed
[44:43] faithful. They recognized the Messiah,
[44:45] right? That's what all they were
[44:46] Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, that's what all
[44:47] they're waiting for was the Messiah.
[44:49] Okay.
[44:52] Um verse 29, for the gifts and calling
[44:55] of God are without repentance. In other
[44:58] words, there's gifts and there's and God
[45:00] there's gifts in Israel's life, right?
[45:02] Uh there's calling on their life and
[45:04] it's without repentance. Other words,
[45:06] God's not going to repent of it. And
[45:08] also another way you can take that is
[45:10] even with even if they don't repent
[45:12] those gifts are still in their lives and
[45:13] they're going to manifest at the right
[45:14] time. Like Judas is scar he was given
[45:17] all those gifts and the Bible said he
[45:19] was just as equal as all the other
[45:20] saints all all the other apostles
[45:22] because when they when he betrayed him
[45:24] Jesus said one of you is going to betray
[45:26] me. Everybody looked around and they
[45:28] looked is it me? Is it me? They didn't
[45:29] look at Judas and say I always knew it
[45:30] was that devil Judas right because he
[45:33] had his gifts were just as powerful as
[45:35] everybody else.
[45:42] Well, I don't know about that. That's a
[45:43] good question, buddy. I'll think about
[45:44] that one. I've never thought about that.
[45:47] Uh, he definitely had the gift of
[45:49] healing because he cast out devils. So,
[45:51] when when he was before he was possessed
[45:53] of Satan, he was filled in his mind with
[45:55] the spirit of God and he cast out
[45:56] devils. Yeah, good question, brother.
[45:58] Great question. Let's give him two
[45:58] claps. I get ready uh for our ninth
[46:00] service here. And I'm only preaching 40
[46:03] minutes so far. Hallelujah. So, there
[46:05] you go, brother. Uh the gifts and
[46:06] calling of God, great question. Are
[46:08] without repentance. So there's there's
[46:09] gifts in every life here. Now, I always
[46:11] use Malachi and and Victoria and Lydia.
[46:13] If you're a musician, your gift is
[46:15] healing because David when he played it
[46:18] cast off evil spirits,
[46:20] &gt;&gt; right? It's healing. You heal through
[46:22] music.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Okay? But that might not be all in
[46:25] Malachi's life or Lydia's life. Okay? Uh
[46:28] we're seeing uh discernment in our
[46:30] sister Lena's life. I believe brother
[46:32] Jose has a gift of either healing or
[46:33] faith or miracles because of those
[46:35] prayer cloths he sent out over the
[46:36] years. People have got testimonies that
[46:39] they've been healed.
[46:41] Um, Sister Karen Sanders said Zur has a
[46:44] special gift on her life. Now, I don't
[46:45] know what that is, but perhaps the Lord
[46:47] will show it to us. By God's grace,
[46:48] it'll manifest. One time I wrote it
[46:50] down. One time, uh, Zur walked by Sister
[46:52] Karen Sanders and she said, "There is
[46:54] something on that sister, some anointing
[46:56] of God." Hallelujah. So, we want to we
[46:59] want to be mindful of that. Praise God.
[47:01] Amen. Hallelujah. Now, in Sister Nomi's
[47:04] life, we're seeing the gift of faith.
[47:05] Hallelujah. We're seeing that rise up by
[47:07] God's grace. In other words, when when
[47:09] God anoints her to pray, God comes down
[47:12] and answers it and responds. That's a
[47:15] gift of faith. I know it's going to
[47:16] happen. God showed it to me. Now, in my
[47:18] life, of course, I see teaching over the
[47:20] years. I've seen healings. I've seen a
[47:21] few miracles. Uh discernment to judge
[47:24] situations. I've seen that a little bit
[47:26] in my life. And I'm not saying I got all
[47:27] of them. I'm just saying like
[47:30] each one of us, you know, if we're
[47:31] yielded to the spirit of God, we'll see
[47:33] more of them in our life as we're
[47:35] yielded.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; We'll see. And remember, Brother Ram
[47:37] said God can pick you up. He can use you
[47:39] for tongues this day. He said he might
[47:41] never use you for tongues again. He
[47:43] might use your interpretation. He might
[47:44] use you for miracles. It's whatever God
[47:46] wants to do.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; So, it's the mystery of God's will for
[47:51] your life. And like I said, my wife,
[47:53] I've seen so much wisdom out of my
[47:55] wife's uh mind prayer for me. She cast
[47:57] out the demon when the demon was choking
[47:59] me. Um, she called on Jesus, Jesus,
[48:02] Jesus. And instantly that choking left.
[48:05] So, I've seen the power of God in my
[48:06] wife's life as well. Now, all that I
[48:08] don't know how I got to there by God's
[48:10] grace, but Hebrews 13:15, let's pull
[48:12] that up there. Hallelujah.
[48:16] This is the scripture Brother uses about
[48:18] how Noah was in simplicity. His message
[48:21] was simplicity. He was the oddball. He
[48:24] was the one. He was the one to be a
[48:26] worshipper. Remember how many know the
[48:27] Bible said, "What was he a preacher of?"
[48:30] Righteousness.
[48:32] Righteousness. Do what's right. That's
[48:34] what he preached. Was he a tape player
[48:36] of righteousness or a preacher?
[48:38] &gt;&gt; I thought I should throw that in there.
[48:41] Hebrews 13:15. By him, therefore, let us
[48:44] offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[48:46] continually. That is the fruit of our
[48:48] lips, giving thanks to his name. So
[48:50] church, every day try to find a time
[48:52] where you can give God thanks
[48:55] &gt;&gt; because that's your priesthood. That's
[48:58] what God has called you to do. Think
[49:02] about that, church. Think about this.
[49:03] Everybody else is going to complain.
[49:04] You've got to give God thanks.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Everybody else won't give. They'll
[49:10] praise the Cleveland Browns. They'll
[49:12] praise uh they'll praise beer and
[49:14] alcohol. and they'll praise the movie
[49:16] Hollywood stars, but you and I are to
[49:18] praise Jesus Christ.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; That's our priesthood. Hallelujah.
[49:22] That's our calling. We're a royal
[49:25] priesthood. Hallelujah. We've got divine
[49:29] nature. Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Our lineage is in heaven. Hallelujah.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Our father is in heaven. Hallelujah.
[49:36] He's a king of heaven and earth.
[49:38] Hallelujah.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; That's our priesthood. Praise God.
[49:41] That's what Noah was.
[49:45] Brother Ram said, "We are so smart and
[49:47] intellectual in our churches till we can
[49:49] build a million-doll building or $10
[49:51] million building, but yet trying to
[49:53] build one better than the Methodists or
[49:56] the Baptists build one better than the
[49:57] Presbyterian." And the Pentecostals got
[49:59] in the rat race. So, we don't want to
[50:01] join the rat race. We just want to hang
[50:04] out with the doves.
[50:06] Hallelujah. Or we just want to hang out
[50:09] with the lambs. Amen. Let's not join the
[50:12] rat race. Now, we never could because we
[50:13] don't have enough money. So, thank God
[50:15] for keeping us from that the rat race.
[50:18] But, but the he said, "But the thing of
[50:20] this is we're so smart and so set on our
[50:23] ways until we fail to humble ourselves
[50:25] to realize that God's in the little
[50:28] mission on the corner." Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Church, if you just drove through Akran
[50:32] day, how many churches did you pass? I
[50:34] mean, big mega churches, right? Huge
[50:36] mega churches. We drove by Faith Family
[50:38] last night. The whole parking lot.
[50:41] I mean,
[50:43] the whole parking lot's full.
[50:46] Hundreds of cars. And if if some if you
[50:49] ask somebody, "Where's God today?" Do
[50:52] you think anybody would point to our
[50:53] church? But yet, where is God today?
[50:58] God's right here.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; God's here because he's provening it by
[51:04] his word.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Now, we appreciate the truth that they
[51:07] have at Faith Family. I don't know what
[51:09] they preach lately, but but from what
[51:13] I've seen, you know, women preachers and
[51:15] and crossdressing and cutting hair and
[51:17] no modesty standards, right? And
[51:20] speaking in tongues might used to be the
[51:22] evidence because they used to speak in
[51:23] tongues on their live stream, then they
[51:24] took it off. So, I don't know what I
[51:26] think they're moving away from the
[51:27] Pentecostal to more like a general
[51:29] gospel, like a Joel Olstein type of
[51:31] thing. Now, I don't know. That's just my
[51:32] guess. I could be wrong. I'm open to
[51:34] correction.
[51:35] But see, we we've got to keep with the
[51:38] uh we got to keep with the full word of
[51:39] God. If there's a Bible command in here,
[51:42] then we're the priesthood. We're
[51:43] supposed to make sure you know it and
[51:45] you do it.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the priests were to
[51:48] do. Tell the people the word of God so
[51:50] you can live it. Hallelujah.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're the royal priesthood. We're
[51:55] not a million miles away from the truth.
[51:57] We know the truth. The truth has set us
[51:59] free.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:05] I got 11 minutes. Can you bear with me?
[52:07] 11 more minutes. Amen, sir.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; You're all so kind. Hallelujah. So
[52:13] patient. Think of this. Years and years.
[52:15] I've been coming up. I'll be pastor 20
[52:17] years in June. We're coming up on that.
[52:19] Unbelievable. And it's just it's just
[52:21] flown by. It's just like it's like I
[52:24] never get enough time to preach. I never
[52:25] get to where I want to go. It just seems
[52:27] like I just love the word of God more. I
[52:29] want to know more of God's word. It's a
[52:32] joy to preach the gospel to you because
[52:34] it transforms your lives. Hallelujah.
[52:36] Like it transformed mine. Amen.
[52:40] He said they failed to see God in the
[52:43] little mission on the corner. And again,
[52:46] we have three witnesses last few months,
[52:48] Adam, Brendan, Rod, all come in here and
[52:50] say, "It's different in here. The
[52:53] worship is different. The presence of
[52:55] God is here." In fact, Adam told me on
[52:57] the phone this week, he said, "God lives
[52:59] at your church." And I thought, well,
[53:00] only by his grace until we would grieve
[53:02] him. God, help us not to grieve your
[53:04] Holy Spirit.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Remember, he said he felt the presence
[53:07] of God as soon as he got into Akran. And
[53:09] he kept he said uh when he left, he
[53:11] tried to buy uh chewing tobacco. He
[53:13] couldn't buy it. He got down the road,
[53:15] I'll buy it on the turnpike. He couldn't
[53:16] buy it there. He got home, he couldn't
[53:17] buy it there. And now he's free from
[53:19] chewing tobacco after almost 30 years,
[53:22] about 28 years. He said, "God took it
[53:24] from me at your church."
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, thank you, church. Thank you
[53:29] for being a place where God can come
[53:31] down and take out people's addictions.
[53:33] Praise God.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; It didn't it didn't leave any other
[53:36] place. It left here.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; To show us to show us who's among us.
[53:40] It's the Lord Jesus Christ among us.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:48] What did I want to show? Okay, I think
[53:49] I'll go one more. If I got 10 minutes,
[53:51] I'll go one more here. Uh and then
[53:53] tonight we'll look at the bride age. U
[53:56] yeah, let me I want to I want to pull up
[53:58] a visual. Just bear with me just a
[53:59] second. This kind of came to me. Okay,
[54:04] now
[54:05] uh let's try to get done with I think I
[54:07] get done with Moses here.
[54:10] Let me look for this here.
[54:19] Look for this. Uh I wanted to show that
[54:21] visual. I updated the visual on the
[54:22] middle of the road. kind of wanted to
[54:24] show that again. Let me see. I think
[54:25] that might be okay. Now, with Moses,
[54:28] yeah, he just has a short section on
[54:29] Moses. Now, think about this church.
[54:32] Brother Brham mentions eight people in
[54:34] this sermon. I'm I just showed you Noah.
[54:37] He goes to Moses next. He ends with
[54:39] himself
[54:40] about God hiding in simplicity. But I
[54:43] could preach a sermon on every one of
[54:45] these, just a separate sermon on every
[54:46] character, could I not? And just show
[54:49] God was so simple. Look how God was
[54:51] simple in Noah. It wasn't some great big
[54:53] thing where it was, you know, more
[54:54] magnificent than the ancient Egypt. It
[54:57] was God hiding himself in simplicity.
[55:00] You had to be a part of, we'd say, uh,
[55:02] we a renegade oddball type of church,
[55:05] right? A renegade oddball type of
[55:08] church.
[55:10] Okay. So, let me plug this in and then
[55:13] uh, Kesha, let's see if it'll go. And I
[55:15] got 10 minutes here.
[55:19] Oh, you know what? I better take off Let
[55:20] me take off the uh the case. That way we
[55:24] can
[55:30] Let's see if it'll pull up. I just made
[55:31] an updated. Okay, now it's got
[55:33] downloads. Just give it give it a second
[55:34] here. So, Moses, let's look at Moses.
[55:37] Oh, there we go.
[55:40] Let's see if that'll work.
[55:44] We'll just give it a second here.
[55:52] coming up. That's okay if I don't. I can
[55:54] actually try on my laptop. I just want
[55:57] to give you a more updated on the uh
[56:00] middle of the road. Brother says we got
[56:01] to stay right in the middle of the road.
[56:07] No, come up. Okay, no problem. Let me
[56:12] try this other one now. So, let's uh
[56:14] finish with this here.
[56:17] Moses. So, let me go through these
[56:19] quotes and then we'll try to find it on
[56:20] here. Moses is the second example. This
[56:22] is at the hour and 28 minute mark.
[56:24] Remember, this is a three-hour sermon.
[56:28] Uh, Brother Bam says he said in Moses
[56:31] day, it was another time of deliverance
[56:33] when God is just about to do something
[56:35] to deliver his people. God sends a
[56:37] message to the people and it's so simple
[56:39] as we'll catch in the breaking of these
[56:40] seals. That was my purpose in bringing
[56:43] this. Okay. So, Brother Brham brings
[56:46] this this message, God hiding himself in
[56:48] simplicity because God's bringing a
[56:50] message to deliver his people from dark
[56:53] denominationalism.
[56:55] That's an actual quote from brother
[56:56] Brandham. He's bringing us out of the
[56:58] dark denominations into the light of the
[57:00] bride of Jesus Christ. So, God's got to
[57:03] send a message to bring us out. And it's
[57:05] the open book. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[57:07] The book, the seals have been broken.
[57:09] Now, we know the revelations. We have
[57:10] thus sayith the Lord on the mysteries of
[57:12] God. They're finished. And that brings
[57:15] us out of dark denominationalisms in
[57:17] order to get ready for the rapture of
[57:19] the bride of Jesus Christ. Okay, simple,
[57:21] right? Very simple.
[57:24] He says, we find out then the breaking
[57:25] those seals is so simple that the smart
[57:28] miss it a million miles. I hope that God
[57:29] anoints me for it. See, it just goes
[57:32] over the top.
[57:34] He says, now church, notice what do they
[57:37] miss? Just basically just some simple
[57:39] things. They miss the anointing of the
[57:41] four beasts. If you asked a Catholic,
[57:43] "Which anointing of the four beasts do
[57:45] you have?" What what do you think they'd
[57:46] say? They'd say, "I don't know. I just
[57:49] pray to Mary. I just pray to St.
[57:50] Michael, right? I just take the
[57:52] Eucharist."
[57:54] Right? Would Would they know? See, they
[57:57] don't even know what their anointing is
[57:58] for today.
[58:01] Now, church, if they're not careful,
[58:02] they're going to get the anointing of
[58:04] the beast system, the one world church,
[58:07] uniting with the government, right?
[58:09] That's the anointing they're going to be
[58:10] under. So they missed that. So this
[58:13] means they have no flying eagle
[58:15] anointing as we looked at on Wednesday.
[58:17] They're not getting renewed like the
[58:19] eagle, right? They're not around the
[58:20] fresh word. They're not watching and
[58:22] praying like they ought to be. They're
[58:24] they're looking for everyone to unite
[58:26] with Pope Leo. The bride's not going to
[58:29] unite with anything except thus say the
[58:31] Lord. Hallelujah.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; He says uh they don't have the
[58:36] revelation of the Antichrist. They're
[58:38] missing that a million miles. They don't
[58:39] know the deeds of the nickels, the
[58:41] doctrines, the doctrine of Balum, the
[58:43] Jezebel religion. They don't know thus
[58:45] sayith the Lord from the prophet of God.
[58:47] They don't know that the voices of the
[58:49] seven thunders have uttered the
[58:50] revelations contained in the seven
[58:52] seals. They don't know any of this.
[58:53] They're missing all this. I'd say a
[58:55] million miles, maybe 10 million miles.
[59:01] He says, and notice what God done. He
[59:04] brought forth a child, Moses, a simple
[59:06] human being. He could have ordained the
[59:08] sun if he wanted to deliver them. He
[59:10] could have ordained the wind to deliver
[59:11] them. He could have ordained an angel to
[59:13] deliver them. Oh, hallelujah. God can do
[59:15] whatever he wants to do. Well, how do we
[59:16] know that, brother Brandham? God won't
[59:19] leave his program. And the church said,
[59:22] &gt;&gt; "How do we know God's going to send a
[59:24] prophet?" Well, because he did it in the
[59:26] previous days, he's got to do it again.
[59:29] He does not leave his program.
[59:33] That's the reason we know this day. It's
[59:34] got to be simple. Now, he always works
[59:36] in simplicity, but God in the beginning,
[59:39] he could have made the son to preach the
[59:41] gospel, the winds, an angel, but he
[59:43] ordained man for that purpose, and he
[59:45] never changes it. He never ordained
[59:47] denominations. Aren't you glad, church?
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're not sitting in a
[59:51] denomination today? Because God didn't
[59:53] ordain it. God ordained to be just an
[59:56] organic holy ghost fil churches with no
[59:59] legalism over them with just bibleelving
[1:00:02] uh Christians preaching the gospel
[1:00:04] living the word of God not tied down to
[1:00:07] any man no headquarters the only
[1:00:09] headquarters is heaven
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; that's what God ordained not a
[1:00:13] denomination
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; think of that if we were ordained by a
[1:00:16] denomination someone could just make the
[1:00:18] decision I'm moving Jesse Smith now some
[1:00:20] of you might like that but they they
[1:00:22] could move me out of Akran and send me
[1:00:24] down there to Cincinnati or something
[1:00:26] like that
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; just by the snap of a finger at
[1:00:28] headquarters. But you know, we have a
[1:00:30] greater headquarters. We have God.
[1:00:31] Hallelujah.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; And if God ordained me to be here, I
[1:00:34] want to be here as long as I can.
[1:00:36] Hallelujah. Doing God's will. Praise
[1:00:38] God.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; But think of that. A few men could get
[1:00:40] mad at me or they could just remove me
[1:00:42] right out. But if God's for me, who can
[1:00:44] be against me? Praise God.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every year, church, I'm sure
[1:00:48] you know this. Every year, the
[1:00:49] denominations have summer gatherings and
[1:00:52] they change some of their bylaws. Like
[1:00:53] this year, I think it was the Southern
[1:00:55] Baptist, they voted, some of them
[1:00:56] allowed to vote and have women
[1:00:58] preachers. Every year, they have these
[1:01:01] convent denominational conventions and
[1:01:03] they make suggestions on how they can
[1:01:05] improve the denomination and it creates
[1:01:08] a filthy, we'd say, spewed out system.
[1:01:12] The tables are full of vomit. Aren't you
[1:01:14] glad we had clean tables last week?
[1:01:16] Amen. Naturally, but also spiritually.
[1:01:20] See, we're not under the control of a
[1:01:21] denomination.
[1:01:23] So, if something's wrong here, pray God,
[1:01:25] give Brother Jesse a message. Give the
[1:01:27] preachers a message. Give a sister a
[1:01:29] gift in the church. God, we want
[1:01:31] something to change. We need the Holy
[1:01:32] Spirit to move. God, have your way.
[1:01:34] Praise God. We're not controlled by men
[1:01:36] and other men around here. We're
[1:01:38] controlled and moved by the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And I've seen that in every situation.
[1:01:45] Uh when whenever there's trouble, just
[1:01:47] pray to God. Trust in God and stay with
[1:01:50] the word. God will work it out in time.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. Don't get outside
[1:01:54] that word. You stay right with that
[1:01:56] word. Pray,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; fast, seek God's face. God knows how to
[1:02:01] work it out.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:05] Brother said he never ordained Hosea
[1:02:07] would like this one. He never ordained
[1:02:08] denominations. He never ordained groups
[1:02:10] of men. He ordained men to preach the
[1:02:12] gospel. Not machinery, not machinery,
[1:02:15] mechanical devices, or any angelic
[1:02:17] being. It was man.
[1:02:21] God didn't ordain machines to preach.
[1:02:24] Hallelujah. Like they do today. God
[1:02:25] doesn't ordain that. God ordained a
[1:02:27] living man who has the spirit of
[1:02:29] burning. Amen. Whose lips have been
[1:02:31] touched by the coal of fire from the
[1:02:33] altar. They've had a sealing angel seal
[1:02:36] their soul with the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:38] Ghost. That's who God's called to lead
[1:02:40] the church. Hallelujah.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God that's always been his
[1:02:44] program. Noah, Moses are his examples
[1:02:47] thus far.
[1:02:53] Now, I love this quote and let me just
[1:02:56] end with this before I get to the
[1:02:57] visual. I still can't believe that don't
[1:02:58] work. I don't I got a new phone because
[1:03:00] I gave Mali he needed a new phone. So, I
[1:03:02] got a new phone. There's some setting on
[1:03:04] here. Try it one more time.
[1:03:08] Just weird. Every other phone worked
[1:03:10] like that. I think it's just a setting.
[1:03:12] I probably got to try it again there.
[1:03:14] Unless Simon maybe Simon, you know how
[1:03:16] he he has to hook up. Maybe I didn't
[1:03:19] switch something back. You know, maybe
[1:03:21] something like that.
[1:03:25] All right. Not going to play very
[1:03:26] nicely. Okay. All right. Well, I'll
[1:03:29] still look it up in just a moment. Let
[1:03:30] me close with this here. Oh, yeah. I'm
[1:03:31] right at 1 hour right now. Okay. 20
[1:03:33] seconds.
[1:03:34] Let me close with this quote. This
[1:03:36] beautiful quote. Now, God hid himself in
[1:03:39] simplicity in Noah and Moses. And the
[1:03:41] church said,
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; now look at this. I want you to bring
[1:03:44] this out. This is a good this relates to
[1:03:45] brother Chris's question. When does the
[1:03:46] gift manifest? Look at this quote. I
[1:03:47] love this. God bringing deliverance
[1:03:50] through Moses had to train him in
[1:03:53] wisdom. Look, for 40 years, he trained
[1:03:55] him in wisdom
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; to let him fall.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Church, it looks like now it looks from
[1:04:02] our minds like that 40 years was just a
[1:04:04] waste. like he wasted. He wasted 40
[1:04:07] years. It wasn't a waste.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; God built him up for 40 years just so he
[1:04:13] could fall.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. We think, "Oh, I
[1:04:18] feel like I've wasted years of my life."
[1:04:19] Church, you haven't wasted nothing. If
[1:04:22] you're living for God, there's not been
[1:04:24] anything wasted in your life. And I'll
[1:04:26] say like this. Even if you got a call in
[1:04:27] the life for your future, you haven't
[1:04:29] wasted anything. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:04:34] For 40 years, brother, I said, "God,
[1:04:36] build him up in let him get built up
[1:04:37] with ancient Egypt wisdom just to let
[1:04:40] him fall to show Moses you cannot lean
[1:04:44] upon the arm of your own understanding
[1:04:47] or anybody else's understanding."
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, God will let you fall.
[1:04:52] God will let you make mistakes just to
[1:04:54] just to prove to you that you cannot
[1:04:56] lean on your thoughts or anybody else's.
[1:04:59] You've got to lean on God. Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; And he let him do it for four decades,
[1:05:06] 40 years.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Let him think, "Oh, I've got the
[1:05:10] training. I know how to run military. I
[1:05:12] can deliver these people. Yes, I can
[1:05:14] calculate how to get them out. I'll use
[1:05:16] this machine. I'll use that. I use that
[1:05:17] war tactic." And God let it fall to the
[1:05:20] ground just to show them, you cannot
[1:05:22] trust in other things. You cannot trust
[1:05:24] in the wise and prudent. You've got to
[1:05:26] be a baby in my sight. Hallelujah.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:30] You've got to be a child before God. If
[1:05:33] God if God's going to use you, church,
[1:05:37] you can't trust in how much you know,
[1:05:39] what you've been through, what you've
[1:05:41] learned naturally. You have to lean upon
[1:05:44] you cannot lean upon the arm of the
[1:05:45] flesh. You've got to lean upon God's
[1:05:48] arm.
[1:05:49] I forget which king it was. I think it
[1:05:51] was Asa. I've been reading through
[1:05:52] Chronicles and Asa had this awesome
[1:05:55] testimony. But then one time something
[1:05:57] came up with another king and he paid
[1:05:59] money so some king would back him up.
[1:06:01] And God sent a prophet with thus sayith
[1:06:03] the Lord. He said because you trusted in
[1:06:05] man. He said now you have enemies
[1:06:08] against you. I thought what a lesson for
[1:06:11] us when problems come up just we just
[1:06:14] try to throw money at it or do we say
[1:06:15] God help me out Lord God. Money could
[1:06:18] help but Lord what do you want done?
[1:06:23] God had to train him in wisdom to let
[1:06:25] him fall to show you cannot lean upon
[1:06:28] the arm of your own understanding or
[1:06:29] anybody else's. Let him fall to show his
[1:06:33] hand. So God will let you fall to show
[1:06:36] your hand can't bring deliverance. Only
[1:06:39] God's can.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; And church, do we know is Moses in the
[1:06:45] Hall of Fame of faith? Did he make it,
[1:06:46] church? Oh yeah, he made it. Praise God.
[1:06:50] You mean you can make it in the hall of
[1:06:52] fame of faith and have mistakes? Yes.
[1:06:54] That that's the only people that get put
[1:06:55] in there actually. They have to make
[1:06:57] mistakes first and realize I can't do
[1:07:00] anything for God. I've got to lean on
[1:07:02] God.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; I can't trust in flesh. I can't trust in
[1:07:06] men or women. I can only trust in the
[1:07:08] living God. And then God can use me.
[1:07:14] Are you hearing the word of God today?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Let him fall. God let him fall to show
[1:07:22] his hand. Can you see it? Brother Bram
[1:07:24] says God's purpose in doing so was to
[1:07:28] display himself in humility.
[1:07:33] God raised him up and let him fall flat
[1:07:35] on his face as a murderer, let alone as
[1:07:38] a murderer
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; to show him you can't trust in your
[1:07:43] muscles. You can't trust in your your
[1:07:46] wisdom. You can't trust in any of that.
[1:07:48] God cannot use any of that. He can only
[1:07:51] trust you as you trust him. Let's stand
[1:07:54] to our feet by God's grace.
[1:07:57] That was an hour and two minutes,
[1:07:59] church. How many enjoyed the word today?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; I'll show you that visual later. That's
[1:08:05] why we got two services by God's grace.
[1:08:07] Musicians could come. Amen.
[1:08:19] I think that thought fits very well for
[1:08:20] us today. Brother Chris asked, you know,
[1:08:23] when is God going to use your gifts? I
[1:08:24] say like this. God will use your gifts
[1:08:27] when you've fallen on your face and
[1:08:28] failed so many times that you finally
[1:08:30] make the decision, God, I'm going to do
[1:08:32] what you want me to do. I'm going to
[1:08:34] trust in you. Great, great question,
[1:08:36] brother.
[1:08:38] Hallelujah.
[1:08:40] God will let us go through all this, try
[1:08:43] human understanding, and that plan will
[1:08:45] fall, fail miserably, and then we'll
[1:08:48] say, "God, I need you to bring this to
[1:08:51] pass."
[1:08:53] Let's bow our heads. I'm sure, church, I
[1:08:55] don't have to I don't have to ask you to
[1:08:56] raise your hand. I'm sure all of us want
[1:08:59] God to bring something to pass in our
[1:09:01] lives.
[1:09:03] And we try. We can try with all of our
[1:09:06] might like Moses,
[1:09:10] but we got to become like a baby
[1:09:13] and God will reveal
[1:09:16] his plan of deliverance. Hallelujah.
[1:09:24] With our heads bowed, church,
[1:09:28] I trust the Holy Ghost spoke something
[1:09:30] to you.
[1:09:32] And I trust there's something in here
[1:09:33] that you can go and study tomorrow.
[1:09:37] Or maybe you've already got a leading of
[1:09:38] the Lord. Maybe you're already in the
[1:09:39] seals. Maybe you're already in the
[1:09:40] church ages. And so, yes, keep doing
[1:09:43] that wherever God's leading you. But you
[1:09:44] got to get alone and ponder the word of
[1:09:47] God. You've got to meditate on the
[1:09:49] things of God. And friends, as you know,
[1:09:51] it's the greatest time of the day when
[1:09:53] you get to think about God.
[1:09:57] No better thought than God. Hallelujah.
[1:10:03] Thou my best thought by day or by night.
[1:10:07] Be thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart.
[1:10:10] Hallelujah.
[1:10:15] Let me pray for you, church. And let's
[1:10:17] pray for one another if we could by
[1:10:18] God's grace.
[1:10:20] Father God, I'm so happy to be here
[1:10:22] today. Judgment begins right here at the
[1:10:25] house of God.
[1:10:27] Lord, the world, they don't want their
[1:10:29] lives judged. They don't want to know
[1:10:30] right from wrong. Lord, we want to know
[1:10:32] it right here, Lord God. I want to know
[1:10:34] right from wrong, Lord God. We are a
[1:10:36] royal priesthood. Simon preached on it.
[1:10:39] The priesthood shows the difference
[1:10:40] between holy and unholy.
[1:10:44] So Lord, today in my humble, simple way,
[1:10:47] I'm just trying to preach what you
[1:10:48] placed on my heart. These thoughts of
[1:10:50] I've studied.
[1:10:52] Oh God, help us to realize we're a royal
[1:10:55] priesthood. And deliverance will not
[1:10:57] come by our thinking, by our plans. Our
[1:11:02] plans will fail. Deliverance will come
[1:11:05] by God's simplicity.
[1:11:09] By doing what God said, by trusting in
[1:11:12] God. Lord, I trust in you today, Lord
[1:11:15] God.
[1:11:17] I want to say that aresh. I want to
[1:11:19] trust in you, Lord God. I don't just
[1:11:21] want to throw money or or throw words or
[1:11:24] something at a situation. I want to look
[1:11:26] to God. Lord,
[1:11:30] what is your will for this situation?
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:33] I want to run to Jesus when I've got
[1:11:35] problems. I want to run to prayer. I
[1:11:38] want to run to the Lord. God, show me,
[1:11:40] Lord, the path.
[1:11:43] Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[1:11:47] Now Lord, I pray as brother Chris had
[1:11:49] mentioned about the gifts. Lord, I just
[1:11:50] pray each person can find their place.
[1:11:52] Lord God,
[1:11:54] Lord, sometimes you let us go so long to
[1:11:58] teach us that we're going to make
[1:12:00] mistakes and fail so we can trust in
[1:12:03] you. God, help every person to trust in
[1:12:06] you today. Lord God, we are oddball
[1:12:10] church. We're a little unknown,
[1:12:12] insignificant, radical church.
[1:12:16] So radical. But yet, Lord, as others
[1:12:18] have told us, your presence lives here,
[1:12:21] God. Oh Lord, just keep dwelling amongst
[1:12:24] us, Lord God. Please never leave us or
[1:12:26] forsake us. If that would happen, it
[1:12:28] would be the worst thing, Lord God. The
[1:12:29] worst thing that your presence couldn't
[1:12:31] dwell amongst us anymore.
[1:12:33] That people couldn't be delivered.
[1:12:35] People couldn't be saved.
[1:12:38] People couldn't get power in their lives
[1:12:40] by the Holy Ghost. That'd be the worst
[1:12:41] thing if you left and you forsook us, oh
[1:12:43] God. And that would only be because we
[1:12:46] forsook you, Lord God, because you are
[1:12:48] faithful. You are kind. You're gracious
[1:12:50] and loving.
[1:12:52] As many as you love, you rebuke and
[1:12:54] chasen, Lord God.
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:12:58] Oh Lord, we thank you, Lord God,
[1:13:02] for your grace, Lord God.
[1:13:04] Thank you for raising us up so we could
[1:13:06] fall
[1:13:08] on our faces and realize only God can do
[1:13:11] it. And we've got to take your way, Lord
[1:13:15] God. Your ways are better than our ways,
[1:13:19] Lord God. Your thoughts are higher than
[1:13:22] our thoughts, Lord God. As high as the
[1:13:25] heavens are above the earth,
[1:13:29] so high are your mercies, Lord God.
[1:13:31] Extended to us, Lord God.
[1:13:37] So, Father, I pray you meet the people
[1:13:39] where they are, Lord. If they need
[1:13:40] prayer with me, I'll be happy to pray
[1:13:41] with them. if they need to talk it over
[1:13:44] with you, I pray they'll stay in the
[1:13:45] sanctuary and talk it over. May we be
[1:13:47] mindful if people are praying to exit
[1:13:49] quickly, Lord God. But Father, we want
[1:13:52] this time to be beneficial, Lord God.
[1:13:55] We don't want it to go in one ear and
[1:13:57] out the other and forget what we heard.
[1:13:59] We don't want to be hearers only. We
[1:14:01] want to be doers of the word of God.
[1:14:06] We're so thankful we're not a million
[1:14:08] miles away, Lord God. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:14:12] I didn't leave the chapel to keep going
[1:14:15] millions of miles more away. I left the
[1:14:18] chapel so I could come to the middle of
[1:14:20] the road.
[1:14:22] I could come right down the middle of
[1:14:23] the highway of holiness. Lord God, I
[1:14:25] don't want to go away from you, Lord. I
[1:14:27] want to draw to you, Lord God.
[1:14:31] Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] As you said, Lord Jesus, come unto me
[1:14:36] all ye weary and heavy laden, and I'll
[1:14:39] give you rest for your souls, Lord. My
[1:14:41] soul has rest in this place or any
[1:14:44] message church where there's the
[1:14:46] presence of Jesus Christ. Lord God,
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:52] Lord, we all get weary. So we come to
[1:14:53] you, Lord. We come to yoke up with you
[1:14:57] to learn of you, Lord Jesus. Teach us,
[1:15:00] Lord God, that if we fall on our face,
[1:15:02] it's only an opportunity for us to trust
[1:15:05] you. Take your ways. Your ways are
[1:15:08] better. Hallelujah.
[1:15:12] Grant it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
