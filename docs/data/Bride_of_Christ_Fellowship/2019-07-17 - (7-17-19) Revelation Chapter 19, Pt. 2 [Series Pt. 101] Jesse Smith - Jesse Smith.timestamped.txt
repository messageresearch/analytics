[30:13] unto the Lord our God and I'll read
[30:16] verse tube for true and righteous are
[30:18] his judgments and now he's a judge right
[30:21] for he hath judged the great which
[30:24] did corrupt the earth with her
[30:26] fornication and hath avenged the blood
[30:28] of his servants at her hand and again
[30:32] they said hallelujah and her smoke rose

[30:56] Granite Lord in Jesus Christ's name the
[30:59] church said amen god bless you being
[31:01] seated praise God like two
[31:07] look at revelation 19 tonight and Liddy
[31:12] I'm gonna switch over here in just a
[31:13] moment so I can just show just a few
[31:15] slides here so yeah you can switch over
[31:20] Liddy whenever you're ready huh so let's
[31:26] look at revelation 19 we'll see how far
[31:28] we get by the grace of the Lord let me
[31:39] pull up my notes by God's grace this is
[31:44] part 2 of Revelation 19 last time we
[31:47] look mainly at the mark of the beast
[31:49] which was there in verse 20 but I like
[31:51] to go back to the beginning of
[31:52] revelation 19 and just build build from
[31:56] there as we go all right here we are so
[32:04] that's I'm just going to read here I'm
[32:05] gonna start reading and then we'll break
[32:07] this up into the parts that we see part
[32:11] 101 before that door I like to just
[32:14] remind us of these quotes brother Brown
[32:15] was preaching in 1961 he just got done
[32:18] with the church age book and he says are
[32:20] you enjoying the revelation and then
[32:23] this is the quote where he says he said
[32:25] you know I wish we just had now about to
[32:27] March or April just to put up a great
[32:29] big canvas across the back and just come
[32:31] down in daytime and draw out the
[32:33] pictures and the whole chart and just
[32:34] raise them up and down like window
[32:35] shades you know like I've always dreamed
[32:38] sometime of having a great big
[32:40] tabernacle somewhere where I could reach
[32:41] down and pull this chart down come all
[32:45] the way across the platform and
[32:46] revelation and the interpretations the
[32:49] Lord has given me and take a pointer and
[32:50] start through there and bring these ages
[32:53] down then when we get through with that
[32:55] raise that one up pull the other one
[32:56] down like this and start on that and
[32:58] teach it through oh that would just be
[33:00] like a little heaven wouldn't it just
[33:02] sit complete winter through just sit
[33:03] down with the Lord amen I love that call
[33:06] I'm just gonna keep reminding us of that
[33:07] because one day if the Lord tarries I
[33:09] want to write a book on just the whole
[33:10] revelation like we did with the
[33:13] immodesty book and then hopefully we
[33:15] want God will raise up one of my
[33:16] children or one of any child and they
[33:18] can learn how to do graphics real well
[33:20] we can make some real good
[33:21] graphics because that's what brother
[33:22] brand wanted to do he wanted to have
[33:24] just a beautiful presentation of all the
[33:27] revelations I like that the revelations
[33:28] and the interpretations and just have it
[33:31] all laid out on a beautiful just
[33:34] presentation so the Lord willing at one
[33:37] point I sure would like to do that I
[33:39] think that'd be pretty pretty wonderful
[33:40] lay it out and then all the people that
[33:43] can hear it to hear it by God's grace
[33:45] now all that want to hear it
[33:47] so revelation 19 let's look at these
[33:49] thoughts here I'm going to just pull up
[33:53] the themes first I kind of outline my
[33:56] video series on themes and then
[33:59] revelations or key revelations and then
[34:01] the timing so there's a couple themes in
[34:04] here there's the heavens praise at the
[34:05] horse judgment the marriage supper of
[34:08] the Lamb and then Christ's return on a
[34:10] white horse Armageddon yeah so let's go
[34:14] back to that let's look at the themes
[34:15] first and we'll try to preach these by
[34:17] the grace of the Lord now verse 1 I'm
[34:20] gonna just read verse 1 to 6 is the
[34:22] first theme it's this theme of heavens
[34:25] praise at the horse judgment
[34:28] revelation 19 1 and after these things I
[34:31] heard a great voice of much people in
[34:33] heaven saying hallelujah salvation and
[34:35] glory honor and power unto the Lord our
[34:37] God for true and righteous are his
[34:40] judgments for he hath judged the great
[34:42] which had corrupt the earth with
[34:44] her fornication as avenged the blood of
[34:46] his servants at her hand this is quite a
[34:49] scripture here okay we've seen now God
[34:52] he transitions over to the judge and
[34:56] he's he's truly judging this this
[35:00] mother harlot we looked at the last few
[35:02] weeks and all of heaven many voices in
[35:06] heaven are rejoicing at this that
[35:08] judgment is being done mine for 2,000
[35:13] years this has been corrupting the
[35:17] world right 2,000 years and you know God
[35:22] really gave her a warning about a
[35:24] thousand years ago according to church
[35:26] ages I believe was in Thyatira where
[35:28] Jesus says I've given her space to
[35:30] repent and she hasn't repented right God
[35:34] issued that
[35:35] turning all the way back there and she's
[35:38] failed to repent but here God is pouring
[35:42] out he's already looks like he's already
[35:44] poured out his wrath first said he hath
[35:45] he hath judged the judgments in the past
[35:48] heavens rejoicing much people are saying
[35:51] Alleluia power glory honor to the Lord
[35:55] he's poured it out and the Bible said
[35:57] he's avenged the blood of his servants
[35:58] at her hand now church that's something
[36:01] we just got to remember when we see and
[36:03] justices out in the world we have to
[36:05] remember God is going to pour out or God
[36:08] is gonna avenge those right we have to
[36:10] remember that there is a law of reaping
[36:12] and sowing what's over man sews that
[36:15] shall you reap and sow all the evil and
[36:17] it breaks our hearts doesn't it here
[36:19] about the evil murders and and all the
[36:21] all the wickedness that's done it breaks
[36:24] our hearts to hear about it but God is
[36:27] going to avenge all the innocent blood
[36:30] amen because he's just he's righteous
[36:34] praise God he's holy amen and so church
[36:37] as much as it doesn't break our hearts
[36:39] to see the news you know times when when
[36:41] people are mistreated or abused and
[36:43] people go missing and they find them
[36:45] later their bodies and it just it it
[36:48] grieves us but we have this we have this
[36:50] confidence doubt in our hearts that God
[36:52] will bring all things to judgment amen
[36:55] he'll make every wrong right
[36:57] and thank God Church that even in our
[37:00] thank God we can rejoice in the fact
[37:02] that God is going to help us to make all
[37:05] of our wrongs right right now before
[37:07] that day of judgement amen we go through
[37:10] our judgments right now so we don't have
[37:12] to worry about that day of judgment amen
[37:14] thank God because this in church you
[37:17] know God God allowed Moses to be a
[37:19] murderer but God forgave him and God
[37:22] still used them for the kingdom of God
[37:24] amen
[37:25] God let David be an adulterer and a
[37:28] murderer but God still used him for the
[37:31] kingdom of God amen
[37:32] God let Paul hold coats while Stephen
[37:37] was being stoned but God still used him
[37:39] Miley for the kingdom of God amen so let
[37:42] us not focus on the guilt and shame of
[37:45] our mistakes let us repent move on and
[37:47] press on
[37:48] the mark of the high calling in Christ
[37:50] Jesus taking that like Doug Paul said
[37:53] forget those things amen and press on
[37:56] toward the mark of the high calling in
[37:58] Christ Jesus amen because see we we're
[38:02] not you know we're not in this group
[38:04] were that actually we're the group in
[38:05] probably in heaven where the group in
[38:08] heaven saying Alleluia God is going to
[38:10] avenge all the wrongs God's going to
[38:12] make all wrongs right hallelujah
[38:15] I believe that group is a search I
[38:17] believe that group is us it's many the
[38:19] Bible said much people didn't say Angels
[38:22] glory it's an achievement that's you and
[38:26] I saying all praise all strength all
[38:29] glory to God
[38:30] who avenges all things hallelujah amen
[38:34] we don't see it on this side do we we
[38:37] don't see it very often on this side
[38:39] well I do want to say this you know I've
[38:41] been felt that limb felt little
[38:43] convicted here anybody misunderstands me
[38:45] you know I just wanted to say this said
[38:47] I you know I've been watching the news
[38:49] lately and and I appreciate our
[38:51] president I just want to say that I do
[38:52] appreciate our president many times and
[38:55] I'm if I've done in the past with Obama
[38:56] or George Bush forgive me I never want
[38:59] to condemn individuals I never want to
[39:01] put anything on any individuals the
[39:04] Bible said we should pray for those are
[39:05] in power because they're God's ministers
[39:08] and God placed them there for us right
[39:12] that's what Romans 13 says and you know
[39:15] they all make mistakes right just like
[39:17] we all make mistakes I I make mistakes
[39:19] but I appreciate the fact that our
[39:22] president is at least standing up for
[39:23] people and I appreciate he stood up for
[39:26] Israel and I just want to make sure I
[39:27] say that we've talked about that before
[39:28] but kind of I said I mentioned on Sunday
[39:31] how Trump signed that for the churches I
[39:34] think that might have been a wrong move
[39:35] but let's pray for him anyway praise God
[39:37] I always want to add that you know I
[39:39] know Barack Obama did those things about
[39:41] homosexuality and I tried to pray for
[39:47] I still pray for that want to make sure
[39:48] I say that that while we're here you
[39:51] know we won't see all the judgments but
[39:52] we can pray that God will lead those
[39:54] people in authority it's a very corrupt
[39:56] system and we should keep praying for
[39:57] them as long as we're here in the flesh
[39:59] praise God
[40:00] so I want to make sure I I state that
[40:03] because I kind of felt checked on Sunday
[40:05] you know I I do appreciate all the good
[40:07] things like we got the lowest the lowest
[40:10] job unemployment numbers ever in our
[40:13] country more people are working that's a
[40:15] good thing Church we know this there's
[40:17] going to be less and less people saved
[40:19] you know as time goes on but we but our
[40:22] job is to give everyone an opportunity
[40:24] to be saved praise God and so we're
[40:27] thankful for all these things and we
[40:28] need to keep praying I just don't want
[40:30] to put the wrong slant on something I
[40:32] want to pray for all mankind now and
[40:37] I've been learning a lot about history
[40:38] like I said on Sunday like through this
[40:40] man David Barton he's a man who owns a
[40:42] thousand documents from our early church
[40:44] fathers and our church fathers had a lot
[40:47] of faith in their hearts George
[40:49] Washington the member keith randolph was
[40:52] here he's read books about him and i've
[40:53] been listening to david barton and in
[40:56] all his writings he talks about how God
[40:57] is in control God is in control
[41:00] God's raised up this nation God's been
[41:02] blessing this nation we got to enjoy our
[41:05] blessings and worship Christ with all we
[41:07] have while we have the liberties praise
[41:09] God we should enjoy this before as we
[41:12] said before they shot our doors
[41:13] it may happen in our lifetime it may not
[41:15] but we ought to take not take for
[41:17] granted the liberties that we have now
[41:19] praise God we ought to just rejoice and
[41:21] say thank God for all that's been done
[41:24] that God can be glorified in this nation
[41:26] this nation's done more than any other
[41:28] nation to spread the gospel of Jesus
[41:30] Christ praise God and that's why we've
[41:33] had good golly we had a good godly
[41:34] founders remember George Washington was
[41:37] a man of vision praise God
[41:39] he saw visions he prayed that before
[41:42] before attacks he would pray and ask God
[41:45] to give victory and God gave him victory
[41:47] he had many struggles but God gave him
[41:49] victories I get Valley Forge and
[41:50] different ones I can't remember all the
[41:52] the battles now but he was a man he went
[41:56] through hardships and battles and and
[41:58] even Lincoln our
[42:00] her to her David Barton talk about
[42:02] Lincoln and and he said both Lincoln row
[42:05] about George Washington and how the
[42:07] pressures of their their duties drove
[42:10] them to their knees church that's what
[42:13] our that's what our trials should do
[42:15] they should drive us to our knees amen
[42:17] we should come here we should we should
[42:19] come here we got burdens we should get
[42:21] on our knees and cast them under the
[42:23] Lord and get down to business with God
[42:25] just not you know we just shouldn't not
[42:27] and say okay I'm I'm gonna do that we
[42:29] should actually do that we should
[42:31] actually cast our cares upon the Lord
[42:33] this is our time to get closer to God
[42:35] right now because faith comes by hearing
[42:37] the Word of God amen so I just want to
[42:41] make sure I say that you know as I'm
[42:42] looking at all this vengeance you know
[42:44] and and it's a holy vengeance it's not
[42:47] evil vengeance this is a holy vengeance
[42:50] that God is pouring out and it's hard
[42:53] with politics you know because I watch
[42:55] the news I just sometimes I want
[42:57] vengeance to happen upon these left-wing
[42:59] Democrats that say such evil things and
[43:02] they blaspheme the name of Lord but
[43:04] Church I'm human too we've all got to
[43:06] say Lord vengeance is not mine
[43:09] vengeance is yours saith the Lord we got
[43:11] to pray for mercy on these people that
[43:13] God will open their eyes every now and
[43:16] then it happens you know there's like
[43:18] that man Lee Strobel if you never heard
[43:19] of him he was a he was a famous
[43:21] journalist for the Washington Post and
[43:23] he was the atheist and he said about he
[43:26] said about he's a journalist so he said
[43:28] about two years of his life to disprove
[43:30] Christianity he was an atheist a
[43:32] drunkard he hated Christianity but
[43:34] people were praying for him his wife was
[43:37] praying for him and a man at the
[43:39] Washington Post one of their best riders
[43:41] is about 30 years ago as he studied all
[43:44] the facts around Christianity all the
[43:45] science and archaeology he became a
[43:48] believer amen whatever your
[43:52] testimony is he God's got to have a
[43:53] journalist on the day of judgment amen a
[43:56] journalist who found salvation of course
[43:59] he's not a message believer but I
[44:00] believe he's saved amen God's got to
[44:03] have a schoolteacher praise God God's
[44:07] got to have a security officer God's got
[44:11] to have a mother you know house
[44:12] and office workers God's got to have
[44:15] each each gain every kind and God loves
[44:18] his people praise God hallelujah and so
[44:22] we got to be faithful we have to find
[44:24] all those remaining seeds all those weak
[44:28] seeds that we can glean for the glory of
[44:29] God hallelujah I'm just thankful for
[44:33] God's grace to save a wretch like me
[44:34] praise God
[44:35] but see there's just looking at this
[44:38] thought of vengeance the many people in
[44:41] heaven are rejoicing because God has
[44:43] done what's right now this is deserving
[44:45] church this is deserving that praising
[44:48] Jesus because he's pouring out what they
[44:50] deserve praise God we all like to see
[44:55] that you know we all like to see people
[44:56] get what they deserve don't you alright
[44:59] you see when someone works hard I like
[45:00] to seem to get a promotion because
[45:03] that's what they deserve like Jesus said
[45:05] if you're faithful a little you're
[45:06] faithful as much will the same stir on
[45:08] the other side of people won't repent
[45:09] then they need to know they need to face
[45:11] the judges for that you know they they
[45:14] need to know that it was wrong what they
[45:16] did so here heaven is rejoicing they're
[45:22] praising God God was so patient as we
[45:25] said for 2,000 years
[45:27] he gave her space to repent and she
[45:29] repented not she was guilty of the blood
[45:33] of all God's prophets and servants but
[45:36] they all waited upon the timing of God
[45:38] to part his vengeance because venge does
[45:40] mine saith the Lord praise God that's
[45:43] what Romans 12:19 said vengeance is mine
[45:45] sayeth the Lord that's why we
[45:52] the RAM says you know Rome is our enemy
[45:54] and we must program says we must fight
[45:56] Rome see we got to understand that
[45:58] doesn't mean fight with our fists and
[46:00] fight with guns that's not what it means
[46:02] it means fight in prayer we've had glory
[46:05] amen
[46:06] those that will wrestle against
[46:07] spiritual wickedness in high places now
[46:10] if it ever came down the war yeah we
[46:13] would fight just like the early
[46:14] foundation fathers did yeah they had to
[46:17] fight for our rights to worship that's
[46:19] fine if the Lord leads us to do that but
[46:22] I don't see it in Scripture hopefully we
[46:23] don't have to but there's nothing wrong
[46:25] with that there's a time for war there's
[46:26] a time for peace God led them to fight
[46:29] for their freedoms but the Bible said
[46:33] here vengeance is mine and and God God
[46:37] waited patiently November let's go to
[46:39] zico 33 because I don't know the last
[46:41] time I've read this Zico for 311 God
[46:44] doesn't delight when people die when we
[46:47] could men die in fact when the saints
[46:50] die God loves it because the Bible said
[46:52] precious is in the side of the Lord is
[46:53] the death of his Saints but God doesn't
[46:55] like it when sinners die and I imagine
[46:59] God's not gonna like pouring out wrath
[47:01] upon Babylon but he has to do it because
[47:03] he's a righteous judge he has to punish
[47:07] iniquity and the only way he's Justin
[47:10] doing it is if he gave them time after
[47:12] time space the repent think about that
[47:15] space years a centuries decades he gives
[47:19] him so much space to repent zekiel 33:11
[47:23] saying to them as I live saith the Lord
[47:25] I have no pleasure in the death of the
[47:27] wicked but that wicked turn from his way
[47:29] live turn the attorney from your evil
[47:31] ways for why will you die o house of
[47:33] Israel can you hear God's heart think
[47:35] about that
[47:36] God's heart is saying the same thing
[47:38] tonight you know too we say Pope Francis
[47:40] he's knocking on his heart's door saying
[47:42] why will you do this won't you turn
[47:44] won't you turn to the truth God doesn't
[47:46] delight in the death of the wicked every
[47:48] sinner in every man at the strip club
[47:51] tonight every woman in the bar getting
[47:53] drunk tonight watching the game the
[47:55] baseball game whatever the god is
[47:57] knocking on their hearts won't you turn
[47:59] he's knocking turn turn turn but if they
[48:02] refuse God has one choice he has to lay
[48:05] upon
[48:05] the judgments but this is God's heart
[48:09] he has no death in the pleasure of the
[48:11] wicked oh the loving heart of God go to
[48:18] Jeremiah 21 as I told you I've been
[48:20] reading through the Book of Jeremiah I'm
[48:21] almost a I'm almost done there's fifty
[48:24] chapters on think I'm on 36 Jeremiah 21
[48:27] this is a striking chapter and I want
[48:33] you to see church this is a very
[48:36] prophetic thing of what's happening now
[48:39] at the in chapter 21
[48:42] Zedekiah is this evil king he's the last
[48:46] king of Judah and he's hoping for a
[48:49] miracle Nebuchadnezzar is already
[48:51] surrounding Jerusalem and they're hoping
[48:54] for a miracle
[48:55] he said go ask the Prophet and let's and
[48:58] they're speaking positive things and
[48:59] that's where churches are all doing
[49:00] today speak good things speak speak good
[49:03] things you know denominations I'm
[49:04] talking about mega church the speaker
[49:06] thing speakers they all think there's
[49:07] all this revival hope for America when
[49:09] there's not there's hope for individuals
[49:12] but not for the whole nation but look
[49:14] what he says here look at verse 1 and 2
[49:16] the word which came unto Jeremiah from
[49:18] the Lord when King Zedekiah said unto
[49:21] him pastor the son of melchi ax and
[49:23] Zephaniah the son of messiah the priests
[49:25] saying enquire I pray thee of the Lord
[49:27] for us for Nebuchadnezzar king of
[49:29] Babylon maketh war against us if so be
[49:31] that the Lord will deal with us
[49:32] according to all his wondrous works that
[49:35] he may go up from us look at this
[49:37] they're saying O God God send your
[49:40] prophet and give us good words that
[49:42] you'll do wonderful works who wants to
[49:45] guess what Jeremiah said Jeremiah said
[49:49] no he said I'm just we're not gonna read
[49:51] the whole chapter but he said he's going
[49:54] to precede you without walls and he's
[49:56] gonna burn down the city look at verse 5
[50:00] and I myself will fight against you with
[50:02] outstretched hand and with the strong
[50:04] arm even in anger and fury and in great
[50:06] wrath my the King says do under swigs
[50:09] come on Jeremiah give us a prophesy let
[50:11] the prophets say good things that God's
[50:13] gonna rescue the people of God even
[50:15] though we're surrounded like the days of
[50:17] Hezekiah like the days of Josiah like
[50:19] the
[50:19] days of ASA right are those kings that
[50:21] were surrounded but God delivered them
[50:23] they were looking back at just the good
[50:25] things they wanted the good blessings of
[50:27] God without doing the good things of God
[50:29] amen
[50:31] church if we want the good things of God
[50:33] we've got to do good things we've got to
[50:36] live holy if we want supernatural things
[50:38] we got to live supernaturally close to
[50:41] God amen that's what brother says in the
[50:44] statue ever made he said that's the
[50:45] reason God has a new more miracles
[50:47] amongst us because we're not getting
[50:49] built up into the things of God
[50:51] now that's we're just referring to
[50:53] individuals but see like I'm thankful
[50:56] that we see in our ministry you know cam
[50:57] you know pray or praying here then that
[51:00] Holy Spirit comes in the room people
[51:01] getting filled with the Holy Ghost when
[51:03] we're there in the pointing that woman's
[51:05] eye sights being healed there I thank
[51:07] the Lord for those things that God with
[51:08] us praise God I'm talking about as a
[51:11] group as as a group as a church if we
[51:14] all start seeking God we'll see more of
[51:16] God because when you draw nigh to God he
[51:18] draws you can't help but he shows up in
[51:21] the supernatural amen now go down to
[51:28] verse 13 behold I am against thee o
[51:33] inhabitant of the valley and the rock of
[51:34] the plain say the Lord which say who
[51:36] shall come down against us or who shall
[51:37] enter in our habitations see they're all
[51:39] being prideful who's gonna take away our
[51:41] houses you know they're all prideful the
[51:43] Jews are prideful
[51:44] even though Nebuchadnezzar is making war
[51:46] against them and surrounded them verse
[51:48] 14 but I'll punish you according to the
[51:49] what the fruit of your doings see saith
[51:53] the Lord and I will kindle the fire and
[51:54] the force thereof and it shall devour
[51:56] all things round about it so they're
[51:58] saying God deliver us like the days of
[52:00] old
[52:01] but God's saying you haven't turned you
[52:03] never turn back to me praise God
[52:05] and then in preceding chapters I'm sorry
[52:10] preceding chapters you'll see God tells
[52:13] etic ayah you need to leave the city now
[52:16] or you're gonna die instead of the kind
[52:18] of refuses I'm not listening that
[52:19] prophet on the but then at the very end
[52:22] he tries to leave but then you know he
[52:24] gets his eyes plucked out and dies and
[52:26] everything so in other words that God
[52:28] gave him so many warnings to the Prophet
[52:30] but he kept turning it down turning it
[52:32] down any
[52:33] never turned from his wicked ways and so
[52:36] this is what God is doing with America
[52:38] and the entire world they won't turn
[52:41] from their evil ways they're hoping for
[52:43] miraculous but they're not submitting to
[52:46] the miracle-working God amen just like
[52:49] the days of elide remember the days of
[52:51] Eli when they got the ark and they all
[52:53] they were surrounded by the Philistines
[52:55] and they got the ark and the Bible said
[52:57] they all shouted but then they got
[52:59] whipped by the Philistines
[53:00] remember that see people can have the
[53:03] Ark the word we've got the message the
[53:05] hour but if we don't live close to God
[53:07] we're going to get whipped Oh but if we
[53:09] live close to God we're going to put
[53:11] that devil on the run amen that's the
[53:13] thought I'm going to bring out at the
[53:15] numerology God told Israel if one of you
[53:19] is in the land and your faith on the
[53:21] land one of you shall chase away 100 and
[53:24] they said five of you were chase away
[53:26] 300 and then God saw an anointing men
[53:30] right like Samson one of you he drove a
[53:33] thousand killed a thousand Amen see when
[53:36] people obeyed the Lord and live the Word
[53:38] of God God back to mouth praise God and
[53:41] God who the same thing today God will
[53:43] back us up if we'll just do what he
[53:45] tells us to do hey glory we'll look at
[53:48] that one on Sunday Lord willing there's
[53:50] a whole bunch of those see if we shout
[53:55] without the character then we're not
[53:58] going to get the victory now we can all
[54:01] be taken on a guilt trip by the devil
[54:04] but Church if we honestly repent then
[54:07] we've gotta we gotta say God forgive me
[54:08] we've got to say God let me feel your
[54:10] forgiveness we've got to move on from
[54:12] the past move on from the guilt and
[54:14] realize we're walking the light weren't
[54:16] overcomer God doesn't remember that God
[54:19] forgives us of that and now we can be a
[54:21] real soldier for Christ amen you know I
[54:28] told the children you know before that
[54:29] woman got healed on two Sundays ago at
[54:32] brother camps her I say before she got
[54:34] healed I made a little mistake on
[54:36] Saturday and I apologize to the children
[54:39] remember that children I laughed at
[54:41] something I shouldn't have laughed at
[54:42] and I apologize to the children I went
[54:44] home and I apologized
[54:47] and see I repented of it beforehand and
[54:51] god bless us with good services people
[54:52] repent and people get healed thank you
[54:54] thank the Lord for that people's lives
[54:56] being discerned
[54:57] you know keeping them from quitting Amen
[55:00] God strengthen that me to keep it but
[55:02] see I made a mistake I laugh to
[55:04] something I got in the flesh I got to
[55:08] natural I got to carnal but before I
[55:11] came up to preach I relayed them pray
[55:13] for half an hour that's God to forgive
[55:14] me got up at 5:30 to pray and seek God
[55:16] and fasted all those things to try to
[55:19] get right see if we repair and live the
[55:22] Word of God that we can shout with the
[55:24] ark and the art the part of the ark will
[55:26] move for us amen glory see because we
[55:30] all fall short of the glory of God we
[55:32] got to move on from the guilt and just
[55:34] at church I was honestly struggling that
[55:35] morning God are you gonna move today
[55:36] again forgive I made this mistake but
[55:39] God came through amen he showed me the
[55:42] glory of forgiveness amen hallelujah
[55:45] that he looks beyond my faults and see
[55:47] my needs amen hallelujah that Heatley is
[55:51] faithful that proved to me that he's
[55:53] faithful and just to forgive us of all
[55:55] unrighteousness amen hallelujah thank
[56:00] the Lord see we still got character the
[56:03] fact we do say we're sorry shows we got
[56:05] character
[56:05] the fact you do repent shows you got
[56:08] good character oh they do because you're
[56:11] recognizing your wrongs now hope that
[56:13] helps their church God was giving Israel
[56:16] the fruit of her doings and what year
[56:19] was this six oh nine so you know David
[56:23] ruled a thousand BC so for 400 years God
[56:26] sent prophet after prophet warning them
[56:28] live right live right live right and
[56:30] finally God said fine if you don't live
[56:32] right I'm gonna judge you through

[57:05] whole battle for America was Elvis
[57:07] Presley or preachers like brother
[57:09] branham and the more the majority said

[57:16] look at that it was it was Judas and
[57:18] Jesus right there brother my goodness

[58:40] and a voice came out of throne saying
[58:42] praise our God all ye his servants and
[58:45] ye that fear Him both small and great
[58:47] all right there I am I'm one of those
[58:49] small ones I'm not a great one I was

[1:03:37] give God all of our will that's our
[1:03:40] victory that's our victory in the
[1:03:42] love divide that we buy love choose to
[1:03:45] do all of God's will and we sacrifice
[1:03:47] all of our will he said I like that word
[1:03:51] Oh mine she's made herself ready

[1:03:59] little pipe pull this out the other end
[1:04:01] say blessed is he that overcome you had
[1:04:06] nothing to overcome he just pushed you
[1:04:07] through but you've got to make decisions
[1:04:11] for yourself I have to make decisions
[1:04:13] for myself and doing that we show our
[1:04:15] faith in respects to God this is how God
[1:04:18] is going to give us rewards in heaven
[1:04:20] it's based upon our decisions that we
[1:04:22] made
[1:04:23] remember God told brother Branham
[1:04:24] through that guy who spoke in tongues I
[1:04:26] forget his name a great portion of
[1:04:28] having to wait you because you chose the
[1:04:30] harder way Church let me tell you you're
[1:04:32] choosing the harder way tonight there's
[1:04:35] a lot of things you could be doing at
[1:04:36] home and working to try to get more
[1:04:38] money you could be going to bigger
[1:04:40] churches you know denominational
[1:04:42] churches that compromise on the Word of
[1:04:43] God but you and I are choosing the
[1:04:45] harder way and got a bless you for that
[1:04:47] and you'll get the victory and love
[1:04:49] demand for that amen hallelujah there's
[1:04:53] a lot of churches I would like like to
[1:04:54] have your membership tonight but they'll
[1:04:56] get you to compromise on God's Word
[1:04:58] right
[1:05:01] but see you've got something to do he's
[1:05:04] not gonna push you through a pipe and
[1:05:06] say you overcame buddy see we've got the
[1:05:09] lay down our will and we got to give it
[1:05:12] to God because she makes herself ready
[1:05:16] by heard by her own death to self will
[1:05:19] right does that help by God's grace he
[1:05:23] said he can't push you through a little
[1:05:24] pipe and call you an overcomer it's just
[1:05:27] like the promised land now that
[1:05:29] co-starred on here but brother man said
[1:05:30] God said God told Joshua take the whole
[1:05:32] thing
[1:05:33] now you go fight for it take one step at
[1:05:36] a time right now did God fight for them
[1:05:39] yes there's times God fought for them
[1:05:41] like a Jericho and there's other times
[1:05:43] remember when Joshua defeated a I'd
[1:05:46] remember that
[1:05:47] Joshua win there and actually killed
[1:05:49] them he sent 5,000 over here remember
[1:05:52] the story a I was a big city
[1:05:54] he set 5000 on the
[1:05:56] bush over here hiding behind some force
[1:05:59] pizza and then he took a small group he
[1:06:01] led them in there thought he drew out
[1:06:03] all their armies glory he fought him and
[1:06:09] drew and he drew all their men outside
[1:06:10] the city and then they blew the horn
[1:06:12] darker girl and then the ambush came in
[1:06:15] five thousand men all snuck in the back
[1:06:17] door and they killed and destroyed
[1:06:19] everything with their own hands with
[1:06:22] their own swords
[1:06:24] see sometimes guy wants to fight for you
[1:06:26] other times God wants you to fight yeah
[1:06:30] but he can't find all your battles
[1:06:33] really or else then you're not an
[1:06:34] overcomer what did you overcome
[1:06:37] Oh God carry me through to the rapture I
[1:06:40] can't read my Bible and pray anymore I

[1:08:26] 10 and I fell at his feet to worship him
[1:08:28] and he said unto me see thou do it not I
[1:08:30] am thy fellow-servant and of thy
[1:08:31] brethren that have the testimony of
[1:08:33] Jesus worship God for the testimony of
[1:08:35] Jesus is the spirit of prophecy praise
[1:08:38] God there's a lot in there but notice
[1:08:42] even when we look at on Sunday when we
[1:08:44] looked at Joel chapter 2 about the
[1:08:45] prophecy of the latter rain that's the
[1:08:48] spirit of Jesus working in our church
[1:08:49] the spirit of Jesus is trying to point
[1:08:51] out the prophecy that we're supposed to
[1:08:54] recognize and live today right that's
[1:08:57] the Spirit of Christ Christ is pointing
[1:09:00] us to the prophecy that we've got to
[1:09:02] fulfill amen
[1:09:04] now let's look at this real quick here
[1:09:10] there's numerous scriptures well there's
[1:09:16] so many well let's real quick
[1:09:19] got communions go to Matthew 26 29 let's
[1:09:22] just look at that thought real quick
[1:09:24] Matthew 26 29 see it's a marriage supper
[1:09:36] 26 29 now he does communion verse 29 but
[1:09:41] I say to you I will not drink henceforth
[1:09:42] of the fruit of this vine until the day
[1:09:44] when I drink it new with you in my
[1:09:47] father's Kingdom look at that he's he's
[1:09:51] having communion with all these apostles
[1:09:53] who were pretty soon are gonna be
[1:09:54] scattered like sheep her high church
[1:09:58] look how loving Jesus is he knows
[1:10:01] they're all gonna forsake him he know
[1:10:02] he's got to go the cross all by himself
[1:10:03] but he promises them I know you'll get
[1:10:06] it right I know you'll overcome praise
[1:10:08] God amen even though you're gonna get
[1:10:11] defeated here you're gonna be scattered
[1:10:13] I know you're not gonna quit you're
[1:10:14] gonna overcome praise God and then I'm
[1:10:18] gonna have communion with you at the
[1:10:19] marriage supper of the Lamb amen he
[1:10:22] knows Peter's gonna deny him glory oh
[1:10:24] yeah he knows they're all gonna scatter
[1:10:27] like chickens and run away he knows that
[1:10:31] but he realizes that that once they get
[1:10:33] the Holy Ghost they're gonna be Eagles
[1:10:35] amen see because programs they never got
[1:10:38] the full armor of God so they got to
[1:10:40] Pentecost oh thank god so he promises
[1:10:45] I'm gonna eat supper with you and he
[1:10:47] knows they're gonna deny him in a matter
[1:10:49] of hours right they're gonna walk over
[1:10:51] to Garden of Gethsemane they're all
[1:10:52] gonna fall asleep they're gonna get up
[1:10:54] the sort the soldiers are going to come
[1:10:56] Jesus is gonna speak they're all gonna
[1:10:58] soldiers have fall down they're gonna
[1:11:00] get up Peter's gonna try to cut off
[1:11:01] Malka says here come here and he cuts
[1:11:04] him off thinking that thinking that he's
[1:11:07] fighting real good Angie's gonna be like
[1:11:10] if you take the sword you're gonna die
[1:11:11] with the sword he picks up the air off
[1:11:13] the ground and puts it back on Malka
[1:11:15] says head in love MA and he still says
[1:11:20] knowing all that he still says we're
[1:11:23] gonna have communion together when this
[1:11:25] is all said and done oh god help us to
[1:11:28] see how God lovingly forgives us and how
[1:11:31] we have a place at that marriage supper
[1:11:32] of the Lamb
[1:11:33] if we just repent and continue serving
[1:11:35] Christ they met Omaha glory what a
[1:11:39] blessing that is their promise is supper
[1:11:42] see it's promised in the scripture now
[1:11:48] let's uh let's jump to the fine linen
[1:11:52] here now go to Titus chapter 2 the
[1:11:55] righteousness of saints Titus 2 verse 5
[1:12:02] yeah let's look at this fine linen here
[1:12:04] this is one of the symbols in key
[1:12:06] revelation I'm gonna jump ahead yeah the
[1:12:08] white garments I think I'll just yeah
[1:12:13] probably wanna close with that in just a
[1:12:14] few moments here give it 15 or 20
[1:12:17] minutes here uh Titus okay I was having
[1:12:22] trouble fine Titus - praise the Lord
[1:12:34] Titus - oh no I'm sorry
[1:12:42] Titus three I wrote down the wrong
[1:12:43] scripture forgive me now this is a real
[1:12:49] good scripture uh yeah that's the start
[1:12:51] of verse 1 because there it is I was
[1:12:52] talking about the United States subject
[1:12:55] to principalities and powers to obey
[1:12:56] magistrates to do every good work to
[1:12:59] speak evil no man that's what I was
[1:13:00] saying forgive me I know when I ever
[1:13:02] speak evil against any man I just want
[1:13:04] to condemn any evil that they do but I
[1:13:07] gotta remember I do evil - and I want to
[1:13:09] be merciful praise God speak evil of no
[1:13:12] man to be no brawlers but gentle showing
[1:13:14] all meekness unto all men for we
[1:13:16] ourselves also wear sometimes foolish
[1:13:19] disobedient deceived serving divers
[1:13:21] lusts and pleasures living in malice and
[1:13:23] envy hateful and hating one another
[1:13:26] how many can say amen to that I used to
[1:13:28] live in a lot of hate I hated different
[1:13:29] people in school I hated my dad I hate a
[1:13:31] lot of people but God has given me Grace
[1:13:34] and victory verse 4 but after that I
[1:13:36] love it the kindness and love of God our
[1:13:39] Savior toward man appeared glory now if
[1:13:43] I works of righteousness we have done
[1:13:45] but according to his
[1:13:47] mercy saved us by the washing of
[1:13:49] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[1:13:53] Ghost which he shed on us abundantly
[1:13:55] through Jesus Christ our Savior that
[1:13:57] being justified by His grace we should
[1:13:59] be made heirs according to the hope of
[1:14:01] eternal life now see that with it's not
[1:14:03] all righteousness that we have right the
[1:14:08] Bible said that we have righteousness is
[1:14:11] symbolic of white garments right so it's
[1:14:15] not our righteousness but it's the
[1:14:17] righteousness of Christ praise God when
[1:14:20] you believe in Christ and trust in
[1:14:22] Christ that his blood was shed for you
[1:14:24] then the righteousness of Christ comes
[1:14:26] upon you amen so that's what's why I
[1:14:32] want to read right there and
[1:14:35] righteousness the Bible said is like a
[1:14:38] garment praise God
[1:14:39] it's like a garment so let's look at
[1:14:46] another scripture here there's matters
[1:14:47] so many scriptures I think I'll just hit
[1:14:49] the highlights here it's a garment so
[1:14:53] let's go to Luke 24:49 here's the
[1:14:57] promise of you getting a garment this is
[1:15:00] the promise of you and I getting the
[1:15:02] righteousness of Christ Luke 24:49
[1:15:15] 24:49 and behold I send the promise of
[1:15:21] my father upon you but tarry ye in the
[1:15:24] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:15:26] with power from on high
[1:15:28] amen now endued means clothed right so
[1:15:33] if you look it up in the Greek and dude
[1:15:34] means clothed so he said way in wait in
[1:15:37] Jerusalem until you're clothed with
[1:15:40] power from on high right amen
[1:15:44] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is when
[1:15:47] a person puts on an eternal garment of
[1:15:50] power
[1:15:50] it's a garment of righteousness and it's
[1:15:53] the righteousness of saints amen
[1:15:56] let's look at a few more there's quite a
[1:15:58] few scriptures on this so everybody can
[1:16:00] see it
[1:16:00] hopefully by the grace of the Lord we're
[1:16:03] not going to read it but Matthew 22
[1:16:05] speaks of the parable of the wedding
[1:16:07] garment one one guy tries to slip in
[1:16:11] there and he tries to get in the wedding
[1:16:12] supper without the garment and Jesus
[1:16:15] comes in there one last time and I typed
[1:16:18] that to the rapture or maybe the maybe
[1:16:21] the squeeze or the latter rain right
[1:16:23] before the wedding the King slips in
[1:16:25] there one more time and he finds a man
[1:16:27] who's not born again and he kicks him
[1:16:28] out see God is going to let the Holy
[1:16:31] Spirit take out everybody who's not born
[1:16:33] again out of the bride and at the last
[1:16:35] moment before the rapture it's all going
[1:16:37] to be broad numbers here I like that see
[1:16:40] he's got a purge he's got a purge the
[1:16:43] foolish from the wise right before the
[1:16:44] wedding amen other day of the King steps
[1:16:48] in the king himself Christ the Holy
[1:16:50] Spirit comes in to make sure that
[1:16:52] there's everybody who's there has a
[1:16:54] wedding garment on hey man
[1:16:57] see I believe that's that last sweep the
[1:16:59] King coming in obably that's a latter
[1:17:00] rain the latter rain will push out any
[1:17:03] foolish virgin and only the elect will
[1:17:05] be there for that meeting in the air
[1:17:07] amen hallelujah see it's a garment the
[1:17:12] Holy Ghost is a garment on your soul
[1:17:15] I'll say like that it can't be on your
[1:17:18] body because we don't see it it can't be
[1:17:20] on your spirit because your spirits open
[1:17:21] all the time to attacks from Satan right
[1:17:24] but the soul is the nature of the spirit
[1:17:27] and the soul is the real person praise
[1:17:30] God and so the soul is clothed with the
[1:17:33] righteousness of Christ holiness praise
[1:17:36] the Lord that's right now there's quite
[1:17:40] a few and I think like I said let me
[1:17:41] just finish with this thought I just
[1:17:42] want to I'll stay with this thought here
[1:17:44] so fine linen and clean and white is
[1:17:48] symbolic of the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:50] Ghost or eternal life let me read you
[1:17:53] the quote brother Ham says it plainly
[1:17:55] this is from the Sardis and Church age
[1:17:57] he says in the second resurrection the
[1:18:01] souls under the altar or the Jews are
[1:18:04] set forth as given white robes and of
[1:18:08] course eternal life or there would be no
[1:18:10] point of right white robes so go to
[1:18:13] revel a
[1:18:14] in six nine through eleven see she's
[1:18:27] made herself ready how is she ready
[1:18:28] she's born again baptized with the Holy
[1:18:30] Ghost praise God
[1:18:33] revelation 6:9 and when I opened the
[1:18:36] fifth seal these are the Jewish seal I
[1:18:38] saw under the altar the souls of them
[1:18:40] that were slain for the word of God and
[1:18:42] for the testimony which they held not
[1:18:44] for the testimony of Jesus Christ just
[1:18:46] for the word of God the Old Testament
[1:18:47] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[1:18:49] how long O Lord holy and true that's not
[1:18:52] dust thou not judge and avenge our blood
[1:18:55] on them that dwell upon the earth and
[1:18:56] white robes were given unto every one of
[1:18:59] them
[1:19:00] where are they given white robes that in
[1:19:02] heaven why because they didn't get on
[1:19:04] earth because I didn't know Jesus Christ
[1:19:06] but we get it on earth if we know Jesus
[1:19:09] Christ now amen glory see the Jews are
[1:19:13] given white robes later they're given
[1:19:16] eternal life but the Bible said go Jesus
[1:19:18] I go to Jerusalem until your clothes
[1:19:20] with the power from on high the
[1:19:22] righteousness of saints hallelujah amen
[1:19:27] Superman said see they're given eternal
[1:19:29] life which are of course he says is
[1:19:31] eternal life which is white robes how
[1:19:37] many believe that now go to second
[1:19:39] Corinthians five will prove it here
[1:19:41] right in the word sing Corinthians five
[1:19:48] verse 1 this is what I was saying
[1:19:50] earlier once this body of flesh drops or
[1:19:56] you know in death or gets swallowed up
[1:19:58] in life at the rapture then my voice
[1:20:02] will not be just my voice won't be a
[1:20:04] human voice it'll be a divine voice I
[1:20:06] won't be making just human carnal
[1:20:08] comments I'll only speak what eternal
[1:20:10] life would speak that's what I always
[1:20:13] desire I joke too much I get in the
[1:20:16] flesh too much now I'm too carnal I make
[1:20:18] mistakes but when I get that new body no
[1:20:21] more mistakes amen I'm just a lie I'm a
[1:20:24] pure reflection at all reflection of the
[1:20:27] life of Jesus
[1:20:28] amen yeah first one sacred there's five
[1:20:31] one four we know that if our earthly
[1:20:33] house of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:20:35] we have a building of God I love it
[1:20:37] a house not made with hands eternal in
[1:20:40] the heavens ha ha ha
[1:20:41] I've got eternal body in heaven waiting
[1:20:43] for me amen glory for in this we groan
[1:20:48] see we're going now in our earthly
[1:20:49] bottles everybody's earnestly desiring
[1:20:52] to be clothed appalled with our house
[1:20:53] which is from heaven clothed see the
[1:20:58] clothing see Paul saying your soul is
[1:21:01] going to be clothed with an eternal body
[1:21:04] it's eternal life right now verse 3 if
[1:21:09] so be that being clothed we should not
[1:21:11] be found naked now what's he saying
[1:21:13] a soul is naked without eternal life
[1:21:16] right so like that rich man that died
[1:21:20] the Bible said Jesus gave the parable
[1:21:21] and he's carried down to hell right by
[1:21:24] the Angels he must have been a naked
[1:21:26] soul there have been no eternal life
[1:21:28] right and he goes off you know to Hell
[1:21:31] where he's tormented he must is so must
[1:21:34] have went there naked somehow I don't
[1:21:35] know what that looks like
[1:21:36] I have no idea but Paul says we don't
[1:21:40] want to be found naked if by this oh we
[1:21:45] won't ever so clothed in the
[1:21:46] righteousness of Christ a head glory a
[1:21:48] then verse 4 for we that are in this
[1:21:54] tabernacle do groan being burdened not
[1:21:57] for that we would be unclothed but
[1:21:59] clothed the part that mortality might be
[1:22:02] swallowed up of life amen
[1:22:05] see we're growing and we're designed for
[1:22:09] the whole thing the whole body to have
[1:22:11] eternal life we're groaning for that but
[1:22:13] the soul has already got it if it's born
[1:22:15] again well that's right verse 5 now he
[1:22:19] either hath wrought us for the self same
[1:22:21] thing is God who has also also given
[1:22:23] unto us the earnest of the Spirit
[1:22:26] therefore we are always confident
[1:22:28] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[1:22:30] the body we are absent from the Lord for
[1:22:33] we walk by faith not by sight
[1:22:35] we are confident I say and willing
[1:22:37] rather to be absent from the body and to
[1:22:39] be present with the Lord wherefore we
[1:22:42] labor that whether present or absent we
[1:22:44] may be accepted of him amen and that the
[1:22:46] truth whether or no matter where we are
[1:22:49] we just want to be accepted by God for
[1:22:52] we must all appear before the judgment
[1:22:54] seat of Christ that every one may
[1:22:56] receive the things done in his body
[1:22:57] according to that he hath done whether
[1:23:00] it be good or bad
[1:23:01] see that's why Paul says I'm willing to
[1:23:03] beat this body under subjection because
[1:23:05] I'm gonna be paid back for whatever I
[1:23:07] let this body do amen
[1:23:08] right we want to bring this body into
[1:23:13] full obedience to the Holy Spirit now so
[1:23:17] can everybody see that
[1:23:18] Paul says we're groaning to have eternal
[1:23:20] life that glorified body but the Bible
[1:23:24] says your soul is already walking with
[1:23:27] the white garment on so let's read that
[1:23:28] let's go to Revelation chapter 3 verse 4
[1:23:33] it's available to us right now Church
[1:23:37] and really as we said Sunday if you've
[1:23:42] got a soul of power if you got power in
[1:23:45] your soul you'll live the doctrine of
[1:23:46] Christ
[1:23:47] you'll live the life because it's right
[1:23:49] here in the scripture revelation 3 for
[1:23:52] now has a few names even in sardis which
[1:23:55] have not defiled their garments huh see
[1:23:59] and they shall walk with me in white for
[1:24:03] they are worthy see making the right
[1:24:07] decisions just making the right
[1:24:08] decisions makes you worthy of gods of
[1:24:10] God's rewards praise the Lord see Jesus
[1:24:16] says right there it's a red letters
[1:24:17] they've not defiled their garments now
[1:24:20] Sardis was Martin Luther's age so he
[1:24:23] must've been one of those Holy Ghost
[1:24:24] field saints that was walking even
[1:24:26] though he smoked and drank he didn't
[1:24:27] know better he he must had his garment
[1:24:31] there that was not defiled
[1:24:34] or maybe he repent that in his life we
[1:24:37] don't know I don't know and they shall
[1:24:41] walk with me in white the sea church our
[1:24:45] souls either got clothing right or
[1:24:49] they're naked and Jesus
[1:24:52] there's going to be some of them that
[1:24:54] walk with me in white amen they go to
[1:24:58] verse 5 for he that overcometh the same
[1:25:00] shall not be clothed I'm sorry the same
[1:25:02] shall be clothed in white raiment and I
[1:25:04] will not blot out his name on the book
[1:25:06] of life and I will confess his name
[1:25:07] before my father and before his angels
[1:25:10] praise God now go to revelation 3:18
[1:25:14] this is our age I counsel thee to buy of
[1:25:20] me gold tried in the fire that makes me
[1:25:22] rich and white raiment see he's offering
[1:25:25] it again right to Church ages later he's
[1:25:28] still offering this white raiment hey
[1:25:30] head out of the area and white raiment
[1:25:34] now mayor's be clothed and that the
[1:25:36] shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[1:25:38] amen
[1:25:39] they go to revelation 7 verse 13 and one
[1:25:46] of the elders answered saying unto me
[1:25:47] what are these which are waiting arrayed
[1:25:49] in white robes and whence came they and
[1:25:52] I said to him Sir thou knowest he said
[1:25:53] to me these are they which came out of
[1:25:55] Great Tribulation and have washed their
[1:25:57] robes and made them white in the blood
[1:25:59] of the Lamb Amen praise God I know ya
[1:26:03] see God is somehow he's given us
[1:26:07] garments and we have the choice to take
[1:26:09] those garments to the cleaners or not
[1:26:11] amen and our cleaners is a fountain
[1:26:15] filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's
[1:26:17] man oh yeah I take I take a lot I take
[1:26:22] all my clothes to the cleaners I just go
[1:26:24] there and drop him off but somebody else
[1:26:26] washes him but in the spiritual the
[1:26:29] Bible said that they took their robes
[1:26:31] and made them white in the blood of the
[1:26:33] Lamb praise God
[1:26:35] amen see it'd be foolish for me to come
[1:26:38] up here and preach and I got all the
[1:26:41] stains of Genevieve throwing her food on
[1:26:42] my pants on Sunday I'd be foolish that
[1:26:45] could up here all dirty like that I've
[1:26:47] got to take my garments to be washed and
[1:26:49] the same thing is true in a judgment
[1:26:51] it'd be foolish to know you're condemned
[1:26:53] for lying or stealing or lusting or
[1:26:56] committing evil or murdering it'd be
[1:26:58] foolish to try to appear before God
[1:27:00] dirty so that's why Jesus invites
[1:27:03] everybody to come and receive a me why
[1:27:06] that you may be closed amen that the
[1:27:08] shame of your nakedness do not appear
[1:27:10] just dip in this run and this blood will
[1:27:13] clean everything off your garments amen
[1:27:15] glory and that's what we have tonight we
[1:27:19] have a chance tonight to bring our
[1:27:20] garments and dip them in the blood of
[1:27:22] Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:25] and the angel said do you know who these
[1:27:27] aren't John's like I don't know these
[1:27:30] are the ones that went to the the Lamb
[1:27:32] of God dry cleaners if you ever started
[1:27:36] dry cleaning business Lydia call it the
[1:27:37] Lamb of God dry cleaners it would be the
[1:27:39] cleanest garments ever get some organic
[1:27:42] soap or something like that but that's
[1:27:45] what that's what the Bible says in the
[1:27:47] Bible gives us that picture they made
[1:27:50] them white in the blood of lamb they
[1:27:55] made the choice to take their dirty
[1:27:57] clothes the dirty government's to the
[1:27:58] dry cleaners
[1:27:59] I've said to the cleaners and they made
[1:28:03] them white in the blood of the Lamb and
[1:28:06] God said because you did that now you've
[1:28:08] got eternal life praise God
[1:28:13] so what does white raiment what is fine
[1:28:15] linen clean and white represent the
[1:28:17] righteousness of saints where does it
[1:28:20] come from from Jesus Christ now go back
[1:28:23] to sin curtains five because it just
[1:28:24] kind of came back to me this are real
[1:28:25] from era scripture but need to we need
[1:28:29] to have it here to kind of pinch the
[1:28:31] nail down here this is the sticker in
[1:28:43] these five yeah yeah yeah now this is
[1:28:54] this is a good portion here I'm gonna
[1:28:55] close with this because it's already
[1:28:56] 8:30 okay I'm gonna cause of this let's
[1:28:58] go to verse 14 sankirtan is 5:14 all
[1:29:00] this beautiful chapter my goodness this
[1:29:02] is perfect this just ties it all
[1:29:04] together this chapter right here ties
[1:29:06] this teaching on the righteousness of
[1:29:08] saints as eternal life as white garments
[1:29:11] or white raiment verse 14 for the love
[1:29:14] of christ constraineth us because we
[1:29:16] thus judge that if one died for all then
[1:29:18] were all dead and that he died for all
[1:29:22] that they which live should not
[1:29:23] henceforth live unto themselves but unto
[1:29:25] Him which died for them and rose again I
[1:29:28] mean living for Christ tonight you're
[1:29:30] here because you want to live for Christ
[1:29:31] yes
[1:29:33] wherefore henceforth know we no man
[1:29:35] after the flesh so see Paul saying I
[1:29:37] don't look at people's flesh I look at
[1:29:39] what's behind the flesh I look and see
[1:29:42] as there is their soul right with God
[1:29:44] see yea though we have known Christ
[1:29:47] after the flesh yet now henceforth know
[1:29:50] we him no more see the bodies up in
[1:29:51] heaven we don't know Christ after his
[1:29:53] fleshly body we know him after the
[1:29:54] spirit verse 17 therefore if any man be
[1:29:58] in Christ he's a new creature old things
[1:30:00] have passed away behold all things are
[1:30:02] become new and all things are of God who
[1:30:05] hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:30:07] Christ has given to us the Ministry of
[1:30:10] reconciliation to it that God was in
[1:30:15] Christ not a second person the first
[1:30:17] person was in Christ amen reconciling
[1:30:22] the world unto himself not imputing
[1:30:24] their trespasses unto them and have
[1:30:27] committed unto us the word of
[1:30:29] reconciliation see so just as we can
[1:30:34] claim that Christ is not going to give
[1:30:37] me what we did what I deserve we can
[1:30:39] tell it to other people even though
[1:30:41] you're down even though you're
[1:30:42] distressed even though you're
[1:30:43] discouraged even though you feel guilty
[1:30:45] God has given us the Ministry of
[1:30:48] reconciliation God's not going to give
[1:30:50] you what you deserve because you're
[1:30:51] trusting that Christ paid the price for
[1:30:53] your sins
[1:30:54] see that's the Ministry of
[1:30:57] reconciliation he's not imputing your
[1:31:00] trespasses unto you he forgave you of
[1:31:03] them he took the punishment of it if
[1:31:05] you'll put confidence in his sacrifice
[1:31:08] ah this religion is the best religion
[1:31:10] there everyone's amen glory amen thank
[1:31:13] you Jesus God reconciled us to himself
[1:31:16] praise God verse 20 now then we are the
[1:31:21] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[1:31:23] beseech you by us we pray you in
[1:31:26] Christ's stead be reconciled to God amen
[1:31:29] in Christ that in Christ place be
[1:31:32] reconciled to God
[1:31:35] verse 21 free ëthe made him to be sin
[1:31:39] for us who knew no sin that we might be
[1:31:43] made what the righteous of God in him to
[1:31:45] stand in that beautiful when Jesus was
[1:31:49] made sin he took our sin remember that
[1:31:51] was that divine transfer remember that
[1:31:53] perpetuation that's what it means Christ
[1:31:56] became our wrath taker all of our wrath
[1:31:59] was put on Christ which means all of
[1:32:01] Christ's righteous was put on us amen
[1:32:04] that's the exchange innocent for guilty
[1:32:07] this is God's way to save and what does
[1:32:12] it mean it means the bride has made
[1:32:14] herself ready she's recognized Jesus is
[1:32:17] offering me his righteousness for my
[1:32:19] unrighteousness and all I've got to do
[1:32:22] is go to the fountain filled with blood
[1:32:24] and say Jesus I'm sorry forgive me
[1:32:27] cleanse me and I said like this cleanse
[1:32:29] all of me sanctify all of me that you
[1:32:32] can fill me with the Holy Ghost that I
[1:32:34] got wash all my garments amen and let me
[1:32:38] be clear with power from on high
[1:32:40] okay let's sing Jesus Messiah praise God
[1:32:44] he became sin that knew no sin now hope
[1:32:48] that helps and I want to take I kind of
[1:32:50] felt led that was gonna be as I was
[1:32:52] preparing I kind of felt led that was
[1:32:53] gonna be the main thought for the night
[1:32:54] that though the righteousness of saints
[1:32:57] is the white garment how could anybody
[1:32:59] see that in the Word of God oh it's all
[1:33:01] the way through there hope everybody can
[1:33:02] see that that right now church we can
[1:33:06] have white garments we can walk with
[1:33:09] Christ in white praise the Lord praise
[1:33:12] God despite our mistakes that despite
[1:33:17] our failures
[1:33:19] it can be washed away when we say
[1:33:22] forgive me Lord I'm confessing it I was
[1:33:24] wrong I was guilty make me innocent
[1:33:28] forgive me
[1:33:29] praise God in other words justify me
[1:33:32] praise God
[1:33:33] declare me righteous Amen that's the
[1:33:36] thought I want to bring out and as I
