[20:12] putting up with me praise God okay like
[20:14] to take our Bibles here tonight by God's
[20:16] grace if you just stand in honor of the
[20:18] reading of the
[20:23] word I'd like to U change my thought
[20:26] tonight you know thought about going
[20:27] into
[20:28] I want to maybe go into Ephesus but I'd
[20:31] like to uh take that thought on uh
[20:35] Groves and
[20:36] Bale Idol bail so i' like to just call
[20:39] this a little I'm just going to start
[20:41] tonight uh and let's go to Judges
[20:43] chapter six we just call it throwing
[20:46] down the altar of Bale just want to look
[20:48] at that here tonight this thought was
[20:51] inspired from like I said a message out
[20:54] Minnesota and then brother Dale Smith
[20:55] shared a few things with me so I'm not
[20:57] done with the study yet but I just want
[20:58] to get a start on it tonight and then
[21:00] when I you know Minister on next time um
[21:02] we'll be able to just quickly backr
[21:05] because just to say my voice I just want
[21:07] to preach maybe about 45 minutes
[21:10] okay I want to put a little cough drop
[21:12] in my mouth you know when it's done then
[21:15] I know I'm
[21:17] ready no really I want to try to
[21:20] preserve my voice I wrote it I have
[21:22] asked God to help me uh spare my voice
[21:25] so I can keep making videos and
[21:26] preaching and song what I need to but
[21:29] Judges chapter 6 please verse 25 just a
[21:32] beautiful text
[21:36] here so as you're aware you know um to
[21:40] apply this to
[21:41] today as I want to I just want to uh
[21:44] study as I've studied on Bale I'm just
[21:46] bringing out how ba worship is disguised
[21:49] today that's kind of what I'm I'm
[21:51] getting at because as I study baale I
[21:54] see a lot of the same Spirits uh working
[21:56] today just just without the name
[21:59] Baal uh and baalism you know worship of
[22:02] Baal was rampit uh the time of Israel
[22:06] and so you know most people most
[22:07] churches today don't bow down to Baal
[22:10] but when they accept many of these
[22:11] spirits and do the worship of Baal um
[22:15] then they're really worshiping that you
[22:17] know the spirit Antichrist spirit Spirit
[22:19] of s but uh it used to be called baale
[22:22] uh and now some people still worship of
[22:24] course baale but what I'm seeing a lot
[22:26] of these worship
[22:29] sacrifices they made it's it's see it's
[22:31] visible today and so I want to start on
[22:33] that and then I'll get later onto the
[22:36] other portions on Bale okay judges 6:25
[22:41] we'll just start with there and we'll
[22:42] read that in verse
[22:44] 28 and it came to pass the same night
[22:46] that the Lord said unto him take thy
[22:47] father's young bulock even the second
[22:50] bulock of seven years
[22:53] old and throw down the altar of Baal
[22:56] that thy father hath cut down the Grove
[22:59] that is by
[23:00] it and build an altar unto the Lord thy
[23:03] God upon the top of this rock in the
[23:06] ordered place and take the second
[23:10] bolock and offer a burnt sacrifice with
[23:13] the wood of the Grove which Thou shalt
[23:15] cut down isn't that great how God uses
[23:19] uh materials that belong to the enemy
[23:22] for his glory here they're going to use
[23:24] wood that was cut down for the as part
[23:26] of the Grove for the wor of Bale and
[23:28] they're going to use that for the
[23:30] worship of the Lord that reminds us how
[23:32] Goliath I'm sorry Goliath sword was used
[23:35] by David right that sometimes the
[23:37] weapons of the enemy or the the tactics
[23:40] of the enemy can be turned around and
[23:41] used by God for
[23:42] good verse 27 then Gideon took 10 men of
[23:46] his servants and did as the Lord had
[23:48] said unto him and so it was because he
[23:50] feared his father's household and the
[23:52] men of the city that he could not do it
[23:53] by day that he did it by
[23:55] night when the men of the city arose
[23:57] early in the morning Behold The Altar
[23:59] Bale was cast down and the Grove was cut
[24:01] down that was by it and the second
[24:04] bolock was offered upon the altar that
[24:06] was built let's just have one more word
[24:08] of prayer if we can just bow our heads
[24:09] here tonight pray
[24:13] here Heavenly Father Lord we love you
[24:15] again tonight thank you for this word
[24:17] thank you for the songs that we sung
[24:18] break this word to us Lord we know we're
[24:20] not gathered in vain Lord we're just so
[24:22] grateful to be here I pray you speak to
[24:23] your children here God and Lord help us
[24:26] as we go through this to recognize this
[24:27] Spirits uh that used to be recognized as
[24:31] baale worship and help us to recognize
[24:34] them today dear Lord and uh Lord it'll
[24:38] strengthen us it it'll help guide us
[24:40] Lord further into the true worship of
[24:42] Jehovah which we know is Jesus Jesus is
[24:46] salvation we thank you dear Lord for
[24:48] your mercy and your love and I just pray
[24:50] you speak to us here tonight bless your
[24:51] saints that are pressed out and anyone
[24:53] that's live streaming in Jesus Christ's
[24:56] name everybody said amen am amen God
[24:58] bless you VNC praise
[25:00] God okay so I just want to start like I
[25:02] said I'll try to uh I'm even going to
[25:05] start the timer here just so I can I
[25:07] really I really do got to take better
[25:09] care of myself God knows that I really
[25:11] do I had a whole week and a half off of
[25:13] preaching and now my voice is already
[25:14] hor just from preaching one time so I
[25:17] really got to pray and ask God to help
[25:19] me by God's grace yeah brother Craig can
[25:22] come in here and brother Brooks can come
[25:23] in here preaching two services and they
[25:25] they're a little horse but they can
[25:27] still sing preach and I I can barely
[25:29] talk I think I've done worn out my voice
[25:32] and really God touch me and helped me by
[25:35] his grace I was listening to you know I
[25:37] went on my computer and I was listening
[25:38] up see I wanted to see a sermon I
[25:41] preached a while ago about U Pick up the
[25:44] pen and write and I listened to it and
[25:46] my voice was so loud and so strong I
[25:47] thought boy my voice is really
[25:48] struggling right now so I can tell it's
[25:50] gotten weaker and weaker as time goes on
[25:53] because I've been teaching in the new
[25:55] Bible club and all that you know so just
[25:57] kind of takes a wear and tear on me but
[26:00] uh anyway I do want to make sure I don't
[26:02] go too long here I just want to start on
[26:05] this thought now uh I got kind of two
[26:09] two uh definitions on Bale I got one
[26:12] from the Bible dictionary and then the
[26:13] britanica and then what I'll do is after
[26:16] I get the definitions down uh we'll see
[26:18] how it's in the scripture and we'll look
[26:21] at Gideon um and I want to bring in this
[26:23] little thought that brother Dale showed
[26:24] me because Dale the Dale went to a
[26:26] museum uh he was preaching he said
[26:29] somewhere overseas and they had a museum
[26:31] of what baale worship really was like in
[26:33] the days of Egypt and different places
[26:35] where they had bail worship um and it
[26:38] was pretty awful but I want to first
[26:39] show a little background here okay so
[26:41] here this this is the smiss Bible
[26:45] dictionary it says Baal is the chief
[26:48] male
[26:49] deity and
[26:51] ashth uh is the chief goddess of the
[26:54] Canaanites and the Phoenicians okay so
[26:56] maybe it wasn't in uh Egypt maybe it was
[26:59] just in the Holy Land there near the
[27:01] Holy Land Canaanite I can't remember
[27:04] exactly where he saw but he was in some
[27:05] born country they had a a a museum where
[27:09] it it had a reconstructed alter of baale
[27:13] okay and it was all drawn out okay now
[27:18] um Bale means Lord in the sense of owner
[27:21] or possessor okay so that's what it just
[27:23] means
[27:24] Lord
[27:26] now
[27:28] this Bible dictionary says terrible
[27:32] licentiousness which is lustfulness or
[27:34] lustful
[27:35] acts fleshly desires was not only
[27:39] sanctioned as part of baale worship but
[27:42] it was the a part of the formal worship
[27:44] of Baal okay so terrible acts of lust of
[27:48] the flesh were a part of the worship of
[27:51] Baal uh and then he goes into you know
[27:53] the plague from Jehovah that destroyed
[27:55] 24,000 Israelites and numbers we we
[27:58] going to get to that eventually uh that
[28:00] was Bale peor right Bale
[28:03] peor um so I got a few things on that as
[28:07] well now peor is just a mountain peak in
[28:11] Moab okay so I looked this up as well
[28:13] what I always wonder what Bale peor was
[28:15] and different places I'm sure you're
[28:16] familiar with in the Bible they're
[28:17] called Bale something right Bale peor
[28:20] they Bale all kinds of different because
[28:21] I looked up Bale and studied a little
[28:23] bit of the scripture so a lot of places
[28:25] were named because of the Bale worship
[28:27] and So ba was another Lord uh another
[28:30] God he's the male deity uh and now as
[28:33] far as Bale
[28:35] peor the Bible says sorry the Bible
[28:38] dictionary says it's a mountain peak in
[28:39] Moab belonging to a certain range I'm
[28:43] just now the prophet balum was conducted
[28:47] by bik that he might look upon the whole
[28:50] host of Israel and curse them from Bor
[28:53] so from this mountain
[28:55] peak Okay so want to look at that here
[28:58] and uh glean some truths from this uh so
[29:02] we're famili familiar with it by the
[29:03] grace of the Lord because I think it'll
[29:05] be be a real good help to you because we
[29:08] start seeing like I said we'll get into
[29:09] all these
[29:10] things so Bor was worship uh where balum
[29:15] taught the children of Israel uh to
[29:18] worship falsely now let's see how he did
[29:20] it so let's go to numbers 31 please 15
[29:23] and
[29:26] 16 this is a striking thing like we said
[29:29] balum is always a striking figure in the
[29:31] scripture because he had visions and God
[29:33] talked to him face to face uh well kind
[29:36] of like that I guess Vision to Vision
[29:37] we'd say U and yet he could be so
[29:40] anointed by God to see visions and get
[29:43] in entrance as the Bible said and yet he
[29:45] would turn around and do witchcraft and
[29:47] all kinds of things and the Bible said
[29:49] you know before he met with Jehovah he
[29:51] was into Witchcraft and other things and
[29:53] enchantments that's the word
[29:56] enchantments so now after if you're
[29:58] familiar with the story after baric
[30:01] asked uh uh balum to to curse Israel
[30:05] what did Bam say he said no he said
[30:07] whatever God has said that's what I'll
[30:09] do whatever God said that's what I'm
[30:11] going to say now what he did though was
[30:14] the Bible said it even calls it out in
[30:16] the
[30:16] Revelation uh the teaching of Baal the
[30:20] teaching of Baal was to teach the
[30:22] Servants of God to fornicate now if your
[30:25] numbers 31 and 16 so this is what he
[30:28] does he balam
[30:30] cannot curse and say thus sayith the
[30:32] Lord I'm going to curse Israel he can't
[30:35] do that because whatever God is blessed
[30:37] he can't curse Glory God's blessed our
[30:40] lives amen so they can't be cursed but
[30:44] what he does what he can do is teach
[30:47] them false Doctrine and that's what
[30:49] balum does so we really got to be
[30:51] careful with false Doctrine especially
[30:53] with marriage and
[30:55] divorce okay because look what what he
[30:57] says Moses is instructed by God on what
[31:01] to do with these women that were left
[31:03] over the ones that have had fornication
[31:05] the ones that had not had fornication so
[31:08] look at verse 15 and Moses said unto
[31:10] them have ye saved all the women
[31:12] alive behold these caused the children
[31:16] of Israel who caused them the women so
[31:20] balam's
[31:21] Ministry after he couldn't curse Israel
[31:24] was to go into these moabit women and
[31:27] teach them how to seduce Israelite men
[31:30] to have fornications or
[31:34] adulteries so see he was a special uh he
[31:38] had a special Ministry to the women
[31:40] right of Moab oh this this dirty dirty
[31:44] dirty false prophet bam was right Bible
[31:47] said the myth of of darkness is reserved
[31:50] forever form him so we know he was lost
[31:52] yet he talk he talked with God through
[31:54] visions and so forth so Moses says are
[31:57] the women alive behold these cause the
[32:00] children of Israel through the Council
[32:03] of balam so balam's Ministry was working
[32:06] on the women to let them what learn how
[32:08] to be sexy teach them how to uh temp men
[32:11] and so forth or maybe uh you know we can
[32:14] just kind of interject some thoughts or
[32:16] maybe just to have them uh condone
[32:19] sexual acts whatever more you know to
[32:21] leave their husbands like I said this
[32:23] ties in with marriage and divorce
[32:25] because if people aren't careful if
[32:26] they're not right with the word of God
[32:29] they could preach in such a way where a
[32:30] man would divorce his wife and marry
[32:32] another well and if it was against the
[32:34] word of God what have they done they've
[32:36] done the same exact thing through the
[32:37] false conso of a false teaching of the
[32:40] word of God they've caused people to
[32:42] commit fornication right that's why with
[32:44] marriage and divorce we wait upon the
[32:46] Lord so it was through the women so
[32:50] bal's Ministry was a Ministry to the
[32:52] sisters right he he deceived them
[32:56] finishing verse 16 to commit trespass
[32:58] against the Lord in the matter of peor
[33:01] and there was a plague among the
[33:03] congregation of the
[33:05] Lord now therefore kill every male among
[33:08] the little ones and every kill every
[33:10] woman that hath known Man by lying with
[33:15] him but all the women
[33:18] children that have not known a man by ly
[33:21] with him keep alive for
[33:24] yourselves okay now let me just pause
[33:26] right here I want to share uh the the
[33:29] history that brother Dale shared with me
[33:31] while we were at Outback Stak house
[33:33] there U just talking because that
[33:35] morning I'd preach on Gideon okay now
[33:37] let me get back up a little bit with
[33:38] Gideon now how you Lear the story of
[33:39] Gideon I went and did research on Gideon
[33:42] according to the Bible it had been 47
[33:44] years since there was a miracle in
[33:46] Israel when Gideon was on the earth now
[33:49] I'm not sure how old he was when uh that
[33:52] come along but if you go back and look
[33:53] in judges 5 Deborah uh and uh was it
[33:57] baric or Bao I'm not sure which one B uh
[34:01] they had gotten a victory remember and
[34:03] by Deborah's prophecy and they had sung
[34:05] the songs and the Bible said because of
[34:07] that Miracle they had peace for 40 years
[34:10] right and then the Bible said in chapter
[34:12] six that they went and worshiped
[34:15] baale uh and because of that God let
[34:19] them become impoverished by the mid
[34:21] minites for how many years seven so 40
[34:25] plus seven if you just the Bible doesn't
[34:27] record another miracle for 47 years now
[34:30] there may have been but we know there
[34:31] was no deliverer because that's what the
[34:33] Bible That's the purpose of the judges
[34:34] right to show the deliverers from Israel
[34:38] okay so it had been about 50 years since
[34:40] there was a miracle a real move of God
[34:42] stirring of God because God gave them
[34:44] peace for 40 years and sometimes Church
[34:46] don't we enjoy that don't we enjoy peace
[34:48] when we get a great Victory and God
[34:50] gives us Deliverance in our lives don't
[34:51] we enjoy the peace that it brings
[34:53] sometimes you wonder why why is it more
[34:54] going on well sometimes God wants us to
[34:55] just enjoy peace
[34:57] Glory thank God for
[35:00] that okay so been 47 years now and then
[35:03] brother brother BR says and the Bible
[35:05] says it too but I'm just you know going
[35:06] off the sermon 1961 it was uh December
[35:09] 30th I'm sorry December 31st 1961 they
[35:12] had the watch Night Service where
[35:13] brother BR preached that God be with us
[35:15] whever all the Miracles okay so I'm just
[35:17] I'm pulling quotes out of there but
[35:18] brother BR said because uh of the
[35:22] impoverishment of the midianites the
[35:24] people began to cry out to God and the
[35:26] Bible say God sent them a prophet right
[35:30] God sent them a prophet and because uh
[35:34] of their sin the prophet rebukes them he
[35:36] said you haven't remembered Joshua you
[35:37] haven't remembered Moses and he said the
[35:40] reason uh this impoverished happened is
[35:42] because you haven't obeyed the voice of
[35:44] the Lord so let's go back there let's go
[35:46] to judges six so we can just hit that
[35:47] highlight there trying to build up to
[35:50] that to kind of show you U where this
[35:53] thought came from and I really want to
[35:55] like I said I really want to dig into
[35:56] the word and uh really study on bail
[35:58] worship because like I said I just gave
[36:00] you one example of how bail worship
[36:02] allowed fornication amongst people that
[36:05] uh uh should not have done it even the
[36:08] Israelites that had the word of Moses
[36:10] even they got seduced by it so it must
[36:13] be preached it's important uh by God's
[36:17] grace
[36:18] okay so judges
[36:21] 6 I'm sorry I turned the wrong way
[36:25] here
[36:29] now the prophet is said at the beginning
[36:31] of the chapter there Judges chapter 6
[36:35] and
[36:37] uh verse eight that the Lord sent a
[36:40] prophet under the children of Israel now
[36:42] go down to verse 10 and I said unto you
[36:44] I am the Lord your God fear not the gods
[36:46] of the amorites in whose land you dwell
[36:49] but you have not obeyed my voice so the
[36:52] prophet comes to say you know God has
[36:54] been Supernatural among you he's done
[36:56] great things he's delivered you but you
[36:57] haven't obeyed the voice of the Lord so
[36:59] every time God's people backslide what
[37:01] does God do send a messenger to get them
[37:03] to repent amen praise God and we're
[37:05] grateful for that and brother R said
[37:07] look the Bible never gave his name and
[37:12] he said I'm sure that's how the prophet
[37:13] wanted it because a real Prophet doesn't
[37:15] want any
[37:17] Glory right he wants God to get the
[37:20] glory now brother Randon makes a
[37:22] statement I don't have the quote in
[37:23] front of me but he makes a statement he
[37:24] said I am telling you this to encourage
[37:26] heard you he said that as soon as a
[37:28] prophet leaves the scene God comes on
[37:31] the
[37:32] scene Glory so what of I I'm typing this
[37:34] to today and that's where we can type
[37:37] Gideon's Ministry to today because a
[37:39] prophet came and preached when the
[37:40] people cried out you know because
[37:42] churches went denominations and churches
[37:44] uh uh you know the Roaring 20s and all
[37:47] these things like that all the
[37:47] wickedness and all so forth that rose up
[37:49] sexual Revolution and here God raises up
[37:52] a prophet with the sword of the king he
[37:55] gives his message even marriage and
[37:57] divorce and goes off the scene and now
[38:00] say I'm going to encourage you as soon
[38:01] as a prophet leaves God himself comes on
[38:04] the scene because the angel of the Lord
[38:07] comes under
[38:08] Gideon Hallelujah that's a beautiful
[38:11] type and brother Graham gave that type
[38:13] and the people really enjoyed that when
[38:14] we ministered that it was a real
[38:16] blessing for me to see that as well okay
[38:19] so now now I'm sure he's I'm sure
[38:21] starting to get familiar with you right
[38:23] so uh we know he's you know at the
[38:25] threshing FL he's trying to hide his his
[38:28] uh his crops you know from the minites
[38:31] and the Lord comes and says you're a
[38:32] mighty man of Valor and he said if God
[38:34] With Us where all the Miracles okay so
[38:36] we know this um and then uh Gideon says
[38:40] wait right here I want to bring you a
[38:42] present and by this I'll know that you
[38:45] you're sent from God okay because he
[38:46] doesn't realize this as an angel yet uh
[38:49] because later he realizes it so what
[38:52] happens is uh he starts asking God for
[38:55] signs I don't know if if everybody's
[38:57] been listening to the Ephesians services
[38:59] but brother brandom said the Corinthian
[39:02] Church was a church that needed signs he
[39:04] said they always had to have a tongue
[39:06] always had to have a Psalm always had to
[39:07] have a prophecy he said the Ephesian
[39:09] church was not that way the Ephesian
[39:11] Church could just hear the word and
[39:12] believe it and move on with God but he
[39:15] said the Corinthian Church had to have
[39:16] something Supernatural something loud or
[39:18] some song or some type of
[39:21] sign uh in order for them to know it was
[39:23] God and brother Bram said that's fine he
[39:25] said God will work with you whatever way
[39:27] you are amen now listen I should say
[39:31] listen this is important to me because
[39:33] I've asked God for signs
[39:35] before okay and so I relate to Gideon a
[39:40] lot okay I don't know if you have or I
[39:43] don't know which one of us but I have
[39:45] asked God for numerous
[39:46] signs okay the one sign was should I be
[39:49] a pastor I don't know if I told you this
[39:50] I was sitting on top of in I was sitting
[39:52] in the bathroom I think I was sitting on
[39:53] the side you know where where the tub is
[39:55] I think I'm just sitting there rest I
[39:56] think I just you know helped Lydia at
[39:58] the restroom when she was little before
[40:00] he started the church you know and she
[40:01] walked out and I'm just reading my Bible
[40:03] I'm like Lord do we start a church or
[40:04] not so I just was praying I was real
[40:06] sincere cry almost crying I said Lord
[40:07] just show me and opened up my Bible I
[40:10] just I need a sign from you and the
[40:12] first scripture was the one about
[40:14] Timothy where Paul told Timothy don't
[40:16] let any man despise your youth but you
[40:18] be the
[40:19] example uh and that right there
[40:21] quickened it to me yeah thank you Lord I
[40:23] must be an example as a as a minister as
[40:25] a preacher here in
[40:27] a and then the other most important one
[40:29] well the other one was am I called to
[40:31] preach uh this was before the one I just
[40:34] told you about so I preached one sermon
[40:36] in acon brother Tim Myers encouraged me
[40:38] to preach and like I told Brother
[40:39] Benjamin last night when we were
[40:40] fellowshipping I said brother I said
[40:42] when I was in school I or I growing up I
[40:44] never thought I'd be a preacher but as
[40:46] soon as I got in the message and I heard
[40:47] Samuel brownie preach and brother Donnie
[40:49] Reagan I knew I was going to be a
[40:51] preacher something in me was just
[40:52] pulling I I was like I'm going up there
[40:55] one day I just had wait a few years you
[40:57] know so I heard it 2001 I started
[40:59] preaching in 2004 so I just waited three
[41:01] years there but I knew I didn't tell
[41:03] anybody I didn't brag about it I just
[41:05] knew there's a call for me I gotta go up
[41:07] there it was like when I was hear
[41:09] brother Donnie Preacher Brother Samuel I
[41:11] wasn't nervous about like I knew I I've
[41:13] got to go up there too
[41:15] um but after I preach preached my first
[41:18] sermon in akan brother Brooks called me
[41:20] up and he said brother I heard you
[41:22] preach brother Tim told me you preach
[41:23] would you like to preach in aan I said
[41:24] well I'm ly up I said well if it's the
[41:27] will of the Lord so I prayed about it
[41:28] and I was humbled by that and I just
[41:31] asked for a sign and uh it was a it was
[41:34] a PM service and I asked the Lord uh
[41:36] Lord if you're in this speak to us uh
[41:38] and I fasted a couple days in the week
[41:40] beforehand just praying asking God my
[41:42] title was a deep and desperate call okay
[41:45] I preach said there and uh that was a
[41:47] sermon where brother Stephen said he got
[41:48] Victory he got deliverance from video
[41:49] games that Ser I remember him at the
[41:51] altar weeping and crying that was really
[41:53] wonderful okay but anyways I was in the
[41:55] AL I was in the um the pastor study
[41:58] beforehand I just said Lord Give Me A
[42:00] Sign I need a sign and God knows after
[42:02] we sang uh Amazing Grace should always
[42:04] be my song of Praise I Ste at the altar
[42:06] or the pulpit rather and we just had a
[42:09] prayer and as soon as we got in with the
[42:10] prayer I announced my text and sister
[42:12] Karen gave like a word of knowledge it
[42:14] must been a word of knowledge or a word
[42:15] of discernment or something and it
[42:17] basically was for telling about what was
[42:19] going to be preached on and then I
[42:20] preached on it it was really wonderful
[42:23] and then the whole altar was filled I
[42:24] remember just going back and forth I was
[42:25] just cross and so amazed like man what
[42:28] are all these people I can't believe
[42:29] they're all touched by the word of the
[42:30] Lord you
[42:32] know and that was another time I asked
[42:34] for a sign the next one was the one
[42:35] about brother amen most you know about
[42:37] that I said Lord if you don't give me a
[42:38] sign or give me a soul I think I'll just
[42:40] go into evangelism because it seemed
[42:41] might that might be the best thing to do
[42:44] uh because I was just kind of
[42:44] discouraged you know about the church
[42:46] and things like that and then God gave
[42:47] me brother amen so what I'm saying just
[42:50] I'm just saying all that to say that if
[42:51] you need a sign from God God will work
[42:53] with you with your sign aren't you glad
[42:55] he does that I'm so glad he does it uh
[42:57] but brother ad said just don't don't try
[42:59] to figure out just wait for God to show
[43:02] you he said he might not speak it to
[43:04] your ear but he might show you sometime
[43:06] throughout the day so we just got to ask
[43:08] God for it and then wait upon it oh the
[43:10] other one was the church when we rent
[43:11] into the second place that we rented in
[43:13] that old garage remember that uh that
[43:16] morning I I was praying and fasting I
[43:18] said Lord if you want us to rent that
[43:19] place bring it to pass and just a few
[43:22] hours later I got a call saying you know
[43:24] we'll give it to you for this price and
[43:25] we'd like guys to rent it and so forth
[43:27] like that so I that was a sign God gave
[43:30] me immediately right away answer to
[43:32] prayer okay so his Gideon's first sign
[43:36] was the present which it would have took
[43:38] two or three hours to uh to prepare this
[43:41] meat and broth and so forth and it was a
[43:43] burnt offering it was a peace offering
[43:46] and a drink offering a meal offering as
[43:48] well all those into one and remember
[43:50] fire comes out of the rock so the fire
[43:52] comes out of Christ because Christ is
[43:53] The Rock right 1 Corinthians chapter 10
[43:56] fire Holy Ghost fire comes out of the
[43:58] Rock and consumes the sacrifice glory
[44:01] and then he knows he's in the presence
[44:02] of an Angel okay now a second sign he
[44:05] asked for uh the
[44:08] fleece uh the fleece on the wool and the
[44:10] floor if the D be on the fleece only it
[44:12] would be dry upon the Earth and it was
[44:14] so okay so the do was so the fleece was
[44:18] wet now the third sign was uh where it
[44:21] was wet on the ground and not on the
[44:23] fleece okay so look he he's asking God
[44:27] first three times he's asking God for
[44:29] signs and God gives him every sign
[44:31] because he's called of God and that's
[44:33] what we can expect God's called us to be
[44:34] the bride of Christ we can expect God to
[44:36] give us our signs right now the
[44:39] beautiful one later is in the is in
[44:42] chapter uh
[44:45] seven yeah chapter
[44:47] seven God gives him an option do you
[44:50] want to sign I don't know if you ever
[44:52] knew that so he asked for three signs so
[44:55] God just keeps working with him with
[44:57] signs that ought to be an encouragement
[44:59] to us church if God's worked with us
[45:01] with signs before he'll keep working us
[45:03] with
[45:04] signs okay so it's in chapter 7 verse 9
[45:09] and it came to pass the same night that
[45:10] the Lord said unto him arise get thee
[45:12] down into the host for I deliver into
[45:13] thine hand but if thou fear to go
[45:16] down go thou with furah thy servant down
[45:20] to the host and thou shalt hear what
[45:23] they say and afterward shall thine hands
[45:25] be strengthened to go down into the
[45:27] host then went he down with furah his
[45:30] servant unto the outside of the Armed
[45:32] men that were in the host isn't that
[45:34] isn't that kind of God God looks down at
[45:37] Gideon's heart and he says You' still
[45:39] got fear in your heart and your hands
[45:41] aren't very strong you got weak hands
[45:43] still after all these victories because
[45:46] remember his church went from 30,000
[45:48] down to 300 how many do that that's
[45:51] quite a that's quite a reduction in your
[45:53] church services right 30,000 down to 300
[45:57] that's right
[45:59] so I'm sorry I think it was 32,000 down
[46:02] to 300 if I'm not mistaken so God says I
[46:06] still I see you still have fear so in
[46:08] order to help you be strong and not
[46:11] doubt if you want it you go down to the
[46:14] tents and listen and I'll strengthen
[46:16] your faith in other words I love how God
[46:18] works with us right and even when we're
[46:20] weak God will encourage us to be strong
[46:23] and not fear amen he'll give us the
[46:26] vindications we need he'll give us the
[46:28] strength that we need so God gives him
[46:30] that and most of you are familiar with
[46:31] maybe some of you aren't but he goes
[46:34] down there and he starts listening into
[46:35] the tents of the mid nights and one of
[46:37] the guys wakes up and says I had a dream
[46:39] I had a dream that a barley cake a big
[46:41] barley loaf rather was rolling down the
[46:43] mountain and it knocked over our tents
[46:46] and this was the this was the the word
[46:48] of the Lord through Gideon and Gideon
[46:51] hears it and the Bible said he fell on
[46:52] his knees and started worshiping the
[46:54] Lord for this fourth sign that he had
[46:56] and he starts giving God praise he goes
[46:58] up there and say we got the victory I
[47:00] thought that was a beautiful type what's
[47:02] what's what's a loaf in the Bible
[47:03] anybody know it's a body because the
[47:05] Bible says you are the bread right
[47:07] that's the Bible says that in First
[47:09] Corinthians that we are the body we are
[47:11] the bread so it was showing that
[47:13] Gideon's uh 300 Gideon's body of
[47:16] Believers was GNA continually keep uh
[47:19] pick up speed and was going to destroy
[47:21] the armies of the enemy praise the Lord
[47:24] and we are the body of Christ so we can
[47:26] expect not an individual Ministry to
[47:28] overcome Satan but we can expect a body
[47:31] Ministry Hallelujah the five-fold
[47:33] ministry the church the Le all the songs
[47:36] musicians everybody working together we
[47:39] can expect like Gideon after the prophet
[47:41] left the scene glory after the prophet
[47:43] leaves the scene we can expect God to
[47:45] work with us to have a body Ministry
[47:48] picking up speed getting closer and
[47:50] closer to the Lord and overcoming the
[47:52] enemy amen glory I like that
[47:57] now that's just a short one review of it
[47:59] but um hope that was a help now in
[48:02] chapter six go back to judges six now
[48:04] this is what I want to
[48:06] share this was our
[48:11] text now we read 28 through
[48:16] uh I'm sorry
[48:19] 25 and uh down to 30 I think it was
[48:22] pardon sorry I'm a little confused up
[48:24] there
[48:26] had the different scriptures copied and
[48:28] pasted there yeah
[48:30] okay yeah 25
[48:34] 26 27 okay all right
[48:38] now this is throwing down the altars of
[48:41] Bale okay now we read that for our
[48:45] text now after Gideon is aware now that
[48:49] God is with him the next step that he
[48:51] knows God is with him is to clean out
[48:53] his house right I preach on that over at
[48:55] brother cams and Minnesota when we
[48:57] preach on the sword Lord and Gideon once
[48:59] God gets you in his hand and you know
[49:01] God's with you then he asks you to clean
[49:03] out your
[49:04] house praise God and uh he didn't say
[49:07] you know it's an option Gideon for you
[49:09] to clean up he said you must in order
[49:11] for you to defeat the midianites and
[49:12] drive them out in order for you to be a
[49:14] deliverer of your people you've got to
[49:16] clean out the Abominations of your
[49:18] father now I'll say like this for us
[49:20] some of us might not live with our
[49:21] fathers not might might not live with
[49:23] our mothers but we got to go we got to
[49:25] get the Traditions that they might have
[49:26] instilled in us that weren't okay with
[49:29] the word of God that didn't line up with
[49:31] God's word okay like I think of you know
[49:34] the M culture I think of brother van I
[49:35] think of you know different Traditions
[49:37] that they have as we talked some of them
[49:39] don't line up with the word right I
[49:41] think of my traditions I had growing up
[49:44] the tradition of you know watching too
[49:46] much Sports you know and uh all kinds of
[49:49] evil things like that it's still a
[49:50] tradition right you know it's still
[49:52] something you do that you just always do
[49:53] you just you always do that well it
[49:56] needs to be cast out in Jesus name amen
[49:59] so that's that's what we're getting at
[50:01] we're looking at types like
[50:03] this now for those of you uh
[50:07] remember Gideon's dad had an altar of
[50:11] Bale okay and around it was a Grove and
[50:14] of course a Grove is like a a small
[50:17] Forest we'd say uh where trees have
[50:20] grown up and then you have inside of it
[50:24] uh under rather under this canopy or
[50:26] protection of Grove of a Grove you have
[50:29] an altar of baale now here's where I
[50:31] want to get to with brother Dale's
[50:32] testimony the day I went to this Museum
[50:35] and had a a whole set up of of Bale
[50:37] worship and here I'm going describe it
[50:39] in a little bit more gentler
[50:41] terms Bale worship was so evil uh at
[50:45] least in this area like I said I don't
[50:46] remember the area where it was which
[50:48] country but he said it was so evil it
[50:51] started off as small things for example
[50:53] you would just bring food to baal's
[50:54] altar
[50:56] okay and you would sacrifice food you
[50:58] leave bail You' leave bail some food or
[50:59] something like that but the deeper you
[51:02] got involved into it it got you more and
[51:04] more uh more and more sinful he said and
[51:07] at the advanced stage they would start
[51:10] sacrificing their own
[51:12] children okay uh and then and so here
[51:15] here's here's what he read and brother
[51:17] Dale is a really thorough man I need to
[51:19] ask him for the reference what I need to
[51:20] do I talked to him yesterday I didn't
[51:21] ask you he said their main festivals
[51:25] they would have uh underground or kind
[51:28] of like ditches built okay leading up to
[51:31] the Altar and they would take their
[51:33] children and kind of uh guide their
[51:36] children through the waters to clean
[51:37] them as a
[51:39] sacrifice which was totally awful and
[51:42] then they would uh once they were washed
[51:44] and clean then they would offer them and
[51:46] kill them unto
[51:48] baale now that's awful right but what do
[51:51] we have in our country
[51:54] abortion right
[51:57] so can everybody see that same Spirit of
[51:59] murder there it's not called bail
[52:02] today right it's not called bail worship
[52:05] today but it's still Antichrist Spirit
[52:08] right it's still murder so once you got
[52:10] to be an advanced bail
[52:12] worshipper certain festivals throughout
[52:14] the the year you would bring your
[52:16] children and he said he read all about
[52:17] this and it was all you know uh
[52:19] reference and everything like that and
[52:22] then once the children were gone what
[52:23] they would do is they would engage in
[52:25] more types of drugs they would have
[52:27] drugs as part of their worship and then
[52:29] they had three or four days of we'd say
[52:32] uh sexual
[52:34] sins okay and then brother Dale read in
[52:37] these certain tribal peoples or whatever
[52:40] more many STDs would break out and the
[52:44] people would be plagued and they had no
[52:46] reason why they would they would have no
[52:48] idea why and so this is what baale
[52:50] worship led to okay it started off
[52:53] really simple and small and then pretty
[52:55] soon you're just giving you know your
[52:57] your finances to that church or whatever
[52:59] more and then pretty soon it starts
[53:01] killing your family then it starts
[53:02] killing
[53:03] you okay so I wanted to bring that out
[53:07] and when he said that I was like M now I
[53:09] can start seeing how these things have
[53:11] become a part of uh you know certain
[53:13] churches we'd say that condone certain
[53:17] sins now let's do this
[53:19] here let's uh turn to a few scriptures
[53:22] here
[53:24] now
[53:27] and uh I want to look at let's look at
[53:29] some of this B worship I want to read I
[53:31] have one two three four five I have six
[53:34] examples so let's go to numbers 25 first
[53:37] here's the the fornication and adultery
[53:40] here let's let's look at this here we
[53:41] read a little bit about it earlier Bor
[53:43] but let's start right there let's
[53:45] continue on that rather numbers
[53:51] 25 and there's a this is a huge subject
[53:54] because Brother Band mentions
[53:55] uh Bale and asth in the church age book
[53:57] about 15 times he said that was the
[54:00] spirit that got into the Catholic Church
[54:02] okay and that's what we see there so I'm
[54:04] not going to be able to go get there I
[54:06] didn't study far enough on it but I just
[54:07] kind of looked ahead a little bit to see
[54:09] where it would lead the study would go
[54:12] numbers
[54:15] 25 okay now one through 15 are all good
[54:18] and then 16 and 18 uh we don't have time
[54:22] to read all that
[54:24] here okay let's just read one through
[54:26] three here and Israel Abode in shm and
[54:29] the people began to commit whoredom with
[54:31] the daughters of
[54:32] Moab and they called the people unto the
[54:35] sacrifice of their gods and the people
[54:36] did eat and bow down to their gods so
[54:39] they don't start with the fornication
[54:40] right they start with eating they start
[54:41] with feasting they start with just
[54:43] having Fellowship right what we would
[54:45] call Fellowship uh so get they get them
[54:48] to eat and then once they eat they get
[54:50] them to bow down and after they bow down
[54:53] then they commit these sexual acts
[54:55] doesn't that sound very similar to what
[54:57] brother Dale described to me in the
[54:58] museum sounds very similar you start
[55:01] with food and you do the worship and all
[55:04] these things these rituals and then
[55:06] comes the uh the fornication acts and so
[55:09] forth verse three and Israel joined
[55:12] himself un Bor and the anger of the Lord
[55:13] was kindled against
[55:15] Israel now I don't know what the plague
[55:17] was that broke out of Israel but can you
[55:19] kind of get an idea here what kind of
[55:20] plagues might break out the Bible might
[55:23] have called STS plagues right we don't
[55:25] know for sure it seems like it but now
[55:27] we can understand why would God kill
[55:29] 24,000 people that went to Bale peor
[55:33] well it's probably because these
[55:34] diseases spread and because it was
[55:36] getting it could not get amongst the
[55:38] True Believers right it was spread
[55:40] amongst those that were disobedient and
[55:41] so forth like that but God wanted to
[55:44] keep the people pure from those things
[55:46] so God allowed them of course you know
[55:49] to uh to kind of cleanse the the the the
[55:52] group there now let's go to verse 16
[55:55] numbers
[55:58] 25:16 remember this is after Phineas had
[56:01] taken the spear and threw it through uh
[56:04] uh the two that were in the
[56:06] tent one's the Israelite leader and
[56:09] other one was a motis or midan itish
[56:12] woman sorry okay verse 16 and the Lord
[56:16] spake unto Moses saying Vex the
[56:18] midianites and smite them for they Vex
[56:21] you with their
[56:23] WS wherewith they have beged you in the
[56:26] manner of peor in the manner of Cosby
[56:30] the daughter of the prince of Midian
[56:31] their sister which was slain in the day
[56:32] of the plague for peor
[56:36] sake okay so I hope everybody can
[56:40] understand this now this is just one of
[56:41] the ideas of baale worship here now
[56:44] brother Rand says this is what the god
[56:46] of Satan is the God of this evil age and
[56:48] brother brandom uh of course preached
[56:50] how this is Satan's Eden which is people
[56:52] going to a church that looks like a
[56:54] Christian Church chur but yet worshiping
[56:56] Satan okay so when a church preaches
[56:59] false Doctrine it's like a balum spirit
[57:01] right uh that allows them to commit
[57:03] fornication that's why it's so important
[57:05] that we have for or I'm sorry so
[57:07] important that we have marriage and
[57:08] divorce down pat we got to have it down
[57:11] pack we can't have divorces and
[57:13] remarriages and all these things and
[57:14] marrying people that have already been
[57:16] through different relationships and
[57:17] things like this it's got to be done
[57:19] right with the word can you say
[57:20] Amen so see I believe if marriage and
[57:23] divorce is misinterpret it it becomes a
[57:26] spirit of bail right a spirit of false
[57:29] Doctrine and it brings pollution to the
[57:31] church now I'm at 32 minutes just give
[57:33] me about 10 more minutes like I said
[57:34] we'll try to go about 45 by God's
[57:38] grace so it was like this either kill
[57:40] them right like Phineas or they're going
[57:42] to kill you they'll spread their evil uh
[57:45] to your family so God said have those
[57:47] 24,000 slain because the plague is
[57:50] spreading all because they just want to
[57:52] worship with him they just want to have
[57:55] some fellowship but sin was all behind
[57:57] it lust was behind it okay the next one
[58:01] was child sacrifice so go to Jeremiah
[58:04] 195 Jeremiah
[58:16] 195 Jeremiah 19:5 now this of course is
[58:19] you know further down the the the line
[58:21] of the timeline the times of Jeremiah
[58:26] but this again backs up what the brother
[58:29] had seen in the museum
[58:31] there let's read verse three though
[58:34] because they have forsaken me and have
[58:35] estranged this place and have burned
[58:37] incense in it unto other gods whom
[58:40] neither they nor their fathers have
[58:41] known nor the kings of Judah and have
[58:43] filled this place with the blood of
[58:46] Innocence okay so innocent Souls
[58:48] innocent people they have built also the
[58:51] high places of ba to burn their sons
[58:54] with fire for burnt offerings unto ba
[58:57] which I commanded not nor spake it
[58:59] neither came it into my mind amen this
[59:02] is a good scripture right here to prove
[59:04] how children are innocent before the
[59:05] Lord did you catch that Glory they
[59:08] filled their place with the blood of
[59:10] Innocence well the only innocent ones
[59:11] could be those who either repented right
[59:13] or those who are not aware of their sin
[59:15] nature yet like children this scripture
[59:17] proves that okay and then this backs up
[59:20] the history that brother Dale saw there
[59:23] remember and then the Bible said it was
[59:25] the most Lous type of terrible sins okay
[59:29] so now we have fornication adultery
[59:31] bowing down eating sacrifices unto their
[59:33] gods child sacrifice as well and like we
[59:37] saw with abortion it happens in America
[59:40] and I've seen some different memes on
[59:41] Facebook and they're all many of them
[59:43] are true uh like they say you know one
[59:48] one child was uh one gorilla is killed
[59:50] right because of a child remember that
[59:51] at the zoo a few weeks ago one one
[59:54] gorilla's killed everybody gets upset
[59:55] but yet there's 10,000 abortions done
[59:57] and nobody says a word isn't that
[1:00:00] hypocritical by that's that's true bail
[1:00:03] worship here in the US amongst the
[1:00:04] Sinners uh that do those type of
[1:00:07] things okay so child sacrifice is part
[1:00:10] of bail worship and what is it the
[1:00:12] churches allow it right the churches say
[1:00:14] oh it's okay you know it's okay it's not
[1:00:16] really a human being yet there's some
[1:00:17] churches that allow that and it's right
[1:00:19] there it's it's disguised as a real
[1:00:23] worship when it's not
[1:00:25] okay now uh the food and gold and silver
[1:00:28] sacrifices is in Hosea 2
[1:00:31] and8 Hosea Daniel Hosea so if you got
[1:00:33] that Hosea 2 and8 let's read through
[1:00:36] that I just found it very striking here
[1:00:38] that they would the Bible would have all
[1:00:41] these descriptions of baale worship and
[1:00:44] then our brother saw the same thing I
[1:00:47] just thought it was very striking to me
[1:00:49] verse eight Hosea 28 for she did not
[1:00:52] know that I gave her corn and wine and
[1:00:54] oil and multiplied her silver and gold
[1:00:56] which they prepared for baale see God
[1:00:59] had blessed them with crops you know uh
[1:01:02] corn oil silver and gold and all these
[1:01:04] precious metals but yet they chose
[1:01:06] instead instead of enjoying them or the
[1:01:08] blessings of God they chose to give them
[1:01:10] unto
[1:01:14] baale that's
[1:01:16] right so see this is all part of the
[1:01:19] worship it might start off as small
[1:01:20] things maybe eating and bowing and just
[1:01:22] being around it we have to be careful
[1:01:24] who we associate with even in the in the
[1:01:27] message denominations especially if
[1:01:29] there's false Doctrine you got to be
[1:01:30] really careful about that and like I
[1:01:32] said I'm not being not having try to be
[1:01:34] a critical spirit I'm trying to save
[1:01:36] people's lives right we're trying to
[1:01:38] save people's lives and keep them pure
[1:01:41] okay now here's one that's quite
[1:01:43] familiar First Kings
[1:01:44] 18:26 but I'm GNA approach it a
[1:01:46] different
[1:01:47] way First Kings
[1:01:53] 18:26
[1:01:57] okay these are the prophets of Baal in
[1:01:59] the time of Elijah and Jezebel and Ahab
[1:02:02] and remember they were worshiping Baal
[1:02:04] they were Baal
[1:02:06] prophets 26 through
[1:02:11] 28 okay and they took the bulock which
[1:02:14] was given them and they dressed it and
[1:02:16] called on the name of balum I'm sorry ba
[1:02:18] from
[1:02:19] morning morning even until noon saying
[1:02:22] oh ba hear us but there is no voice nor
[1:02:24] any that answered and they leaped upon
[1:02:26] the altar which was made and it came to
[1:02:28] pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and
[1:02:30] said cry aloud for he is a
[1:02:32] god neither he is talking or he is
[1:02:35] pursuing or he's in a journey or
[1:02:37] peradventure he sleepeth and must be
[1:02:38] awake and they cried aloud and cut
[1:02:40] themselves after the manner with knives
[1:02:41] and Lancet till the blood gushed out
[1:02:44] upon
[1:02:45] them okay so one of the more of the
[1:02:47] characteristics of male worship is it
[1:02:50] can have more physical movement than the
[1:02:52] true worship right we don't did you see
[1:02:54] uh remember brother Brooks mentioned
[1:02:55] this when he was here he said do you
[1:02:57] ever see Elijah jumping around leaping
[1:02:59] around no he just knew what God was
[1:03:01] going to do now did David leap and dance
[1:03:03] sure did the man that was healed the
[1:03:05] gate a beautiful leap and dance sure but
[1:03:07] in this case they had more outer worship
[1:03:10] than even Elijah had so it's not on of
[1:03:13] course outer worship and then they had
[1:03:15] cutting of
[1:03:17] themselves and that's where we get any
[1:03:19] type of cutting of yourself now we today
[1:03:21] will see it as tattoos or earrings
[1:03:24] or any other self mutilation now I'm
[1:03:27] going to bring out one here Church
[1:03:29] there's a self mutilation going on that
[1:03:30] I'm not sure if you're familiar with but
[1:03:33] it's when a man or a woman have
[1:03:35] surgeries in order to stop having
[1:03:37] babies now that's that's pretty
[1:03:41] serious now the reason I believe now
[1:03:43] that just might that might be my opinion
[1:03:46] but
[1:03:46] listen I like anyone to show me any
[1:03:49] Scripture where God says to stop having
[1:03:53] children and I've asked people this and
[1:03:55] people have come to me and said well
[1:03:56] yeah brother J I know we disagree we
[1:03:58] talked about this before he said but I
[1:03:59] just feel like God told me we're done I
[1:04:02] said that's fine you you gotta go with
[1:04:04] whatever leadership you have but I said
[1:04:06] show me that in the Bible okay show me
[1:04:09] in the Bible where God said it's okay I
[1:04:12] I don't want you have no more
[1:04:13] children now it's possible God may do
[1:04:15] that but what is I'm saying is that
[1:04:19] people so often can't find the will of
[1:04:21] God for different things in their lives
[1:04:22] am I called to preach am I called to
[1:04:24] need them I called you this but yet when
[1:04:25] it comes to children they can find the
[1:04:27] will of God right
[1:04:29] away after having two kids oh we're done
[1:04:31] or one kid we're done we're gonna have
[1:04:32] surgeries and they cut
[1:04:35] themselves and brother Ben this might be
[1:04:37] wrong but I think it's right and you can
[1:04:39] maybe ask your parents but when I talk
[1:04:41] to my parents my dad is the youngest of
[1:04:42] 10
[1:04:43] children
[1:04:45] 10 my my grandparents had children until
[1:04:48] they couldn't have anymore my mother is
[1:04:49] the third child of eight and they had
[1:04:51] one die by uh died after birth
[1:04:55] so I'm saying like this brother bang s
[1:04:58] Wendy our
[1:04:59] generation is the first generation
[1:05:02] that's really had all these mutilations
[1:05:05] and these selfs surgeries right because
[1:05:07] the generation before us well my dad
[1:05:09] well actually maybe it was my dad
[1:05:10] generation I should say it like that
[1:05:13] maybe it was my dad the Baby Boomers
[1:05:14] maybe it was the Baby Boomers they're
[1:05:16] the first ones who come out and say
[1:05:17] we're gonna try to limit our family
[1:05:19] number because of financial concerns
[1:05:21] right or because we can't handle
[1:05:23] children
[1:05:24] but if you just go two generations back
[1:05:26] from my generation two generations go
[1:05:29] back to my grandparents in America
[1:05:32] they're still having as many children as
[1:05:33] they can have now you tell me and I've
[1:05:37] heard uh medical things a medical report
[1:05:40] say this too uh show me one other
[1:05:43] country outside of westernized cultures
[1:05:47] show me one other country that has
[1:05:49] surgeries to limit the number of
[1:05:50] children no other countries have it
[1:05:52] Africa don't have it right all these
[1:05:54] other countries that are not westernized
[1:05:57] because they value life they value
[1:06:00] children they value families but look at
[1:06:03] the countries that are so intellectual
[1:06:05] and westernized and all these things
[1:06:07] like that they try to limit the number
[1:06:08] of children through what self-mutilation
[1:06:10] they have someone cut on them in order
[1:06:12] to limit the images of God that come out
[1:06:15] of them right because every child is the
[1:06:17] IM is in the image of God I know that's
[1:06:19] rough I Don't Preach that too often but
[1:06:21] it ties in perfectly here
[1:06:24] they sacrifice bigger families for what
[1:06:27] the benefit of
[1:06:29] finances can everybody see that that's
[1:06:32] why they do it and isn't it sad Mercy I
[1:06:35] know like in China what they have a
[1:06:36] limit of two children or something like
[1:06:38] that I'm not sure one one oh my
[1:06:40] goodness um Mercy Lord uh how many years
[1:06:44] have they done that you know Russia I
[1:06:45] know Russia had a limit at one time
[1:06:46] different places have had limits we
[1:06:48] don't have a limit here but it's the
[1:06:50] same idea because of the pressure of
[1:06:53] whatever they feel uh they just they
[1:06:56] they self- cut them they get they get
[1:06:58] cut they basically get cut in other
[1:06:59] words they get mutilated in order to
[1:07:02] stop having images of God come forth and
[1:07:05] that's wrong so that's what I said and
[1:07:07] then they and then they uh and then it's
[1:07:09] okay from the pulpit the churches allow
[1:07:10] it and they Don't Preach against it so
[1:07:13] like I said it's okay to limit children
[1:07:15] if Mom's going to die if there's a a
[1:07:18] there's a there's a concern mom might
[1:07:19] die brother said yeah then then you
[1:07:21] might want to limit the number of
[1:07:22] children but again just if we if we're
[1:07:24] going to be Bible Believers and take
[1:07:26] everything back to the word let's find
[1:07:28] it in the word of God okay so that's
[1:07:30] where I'm taking that one self
[1:07:31] mutilation like I said earrings tattoos
[1:07:34] anything cutting on the body and then of
[1:07:36] course and even in child sacrifice so I
[1:07:38] think child sacrifice and self
[1:07:40] mutilation that kind of goes together
[1:07:42] they're not afraid to be cut uh for the
[1:07:45] wrong
[1:07:46] reasons okay just two more here I'm at
[1:07:48] 42 minutes so we'll finish up with these
[1:07:50] by God's
[1:07:52] grace
[1:07:54] okay so Jeremiah
[1:08:01] 12:16 now this one I hope you'll
[1:08:04] understand this one okay this in this
[1:08:06] case they had to make a promise or swear
[1:08:08] by the name of
[1:08:11] Baal 2 Kings
[1:08:22] 10:22
[1:08:25] sorry I was turn the wrong here Second
[1:08:27] Kings
[1:08:30] 10:22 because we don't want any false
[1:08:33] Spirits in here uh we don't want any
[1:08:34] false Doctrine for it'll produce death
[1:08:37] false Doctrine produces death uh
[1:08:39] spiritually it's fornication spiritually
[1:08:41] against the Lord so we must stay with
[1:08:43] the word of
[1:08:44] God Second Kings
[1:08:49] 10:22 and he said unto him that was over
[1:08:51] the V bring forth vestments for all the
[1:08:53] worshippers of ba and he brought them
[1:08:55] forth vestments did I get the wrong
[1:09:03] one G read 23 and J went and jadab the
[1:09:08] son of re Rich into the house of ba and
[1:09:10] said unto the worshippers of Baal search
[1:09:12] and look that there be here with you
[1:09:13] none of the Servants of the Lord but the
[1:09:15] worshippers of Baal
[1:09:18] only okay this is where he tricks them
[1:09:20] and then slays all the baale worshippers
[1:09:22] Glory okay I must wrote the wrong
[1:09:24] scripture I'm sorry about that that's
[1:09:26] where he exterminates baale worship
[1:09:29] amen
[1:09:32] uh okay I think I got it mixed up okay
[1:09:34] this is this yeah this is the special
[1:09:36] clothing I'm sorry this is special
[1:09:37] clothing yeah this is vestments this is
[1:09:39] not swearing by his name this is
[1:09:41] vestment okay
[1:09:43] so again they had special clothes for
[1:09:46] worshippers of Baal that weren't your
[1:09:48] regular Israelite clothes okay doesn't
[1:09:50] that remind you of achen right the
[1:09:52] Babylonian G
[1:09:54] and so see what is that tying with our
[1:09:56] modesty standards right they had special
[1:10:00] clothes okay and prostitutes are known
[1:10:02] in the Bible for what uh uh wearing gold
[1:10:05] and too much expensive jewelry making
[1:10:07] the outward more important than the
[1:10:10] n-word okay so see your clothing bail
[1:10:13] worship impacts your clothing as well
[1:10:15] gives you different clothing special
[1:10:17] clothing than what you normally wear as
[1:10:19] a follow of Jehovah so they change they
[1:10:23] change so much and here's the last one
[1:10:25] they swear by his name Jeremiah
[1:10:29] 12:16 yeah that's it sorry Jeremiah
[1:10:34] 1216 now I really believe this is an
[1:10:36] inspired thought like I said because I'm
[1:10:38] seeing I've seen these and and continue
[1:10:40] to see them uh you know amongst churches
[1:10:43] and things like this when people don't
[1:10:45] take a stand or rightly divide the word
[1:10:46] of God I just thought I'd bring this out
[1:10:48] here because I want to preach more on it
[1:10:50] so the Saints can see this I'll get to
[1:10:53] the Groves the Lord willing next
[1:10:55] time hey Jeremiah 12:16
[1:10:59] okay verse 15 we'll start there and it
[1:11:01] shall come to pass after I pluck them
[1:11:03] out I will return and have compassion on
[1:11:04] them and bring them again every man to
[1:11:07] his Heritage and every man to his land
[1:11:10] this will come to pass if they will
[1:11:11] diligently learn the ways of my people
[1:11:12] to swear by my name the Lord liveth as
[1:11:16] they taught my people to swear by ba by
[1:11:18] Baal then shall they be built in the
[1:11:21] midst of my people all right so God was
[1:11:24] going to have God was going to allow
[1:11:26] some foreigners to live near Israel
[1:11:27] there as long as they were taught to
[1:11:29] honor the ways of the Lord okay that's
[1:11:32] why Jesus said go into all nations and
[1:11:33] teach them to observe all things that I
[1:11:35] command we're supposed to teach all the
[1:11:37] observations of baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:11:40] the gifts of the Spirit any command of
[1:11:42] Jesus Christ we're supposed to teach him
[1:11:43] all amen that's not legalism because
[1:11:46] remember legalism is excessive things
[1:11:48] that are too far but to teach all the
[1:11:51] commands of Christ that's exactly what
[1:11:53] Jesus Jesus wants amen and then the
[1:11:55] Great Commission will be
[1:11:58] fulfilled all right I think we'll stop
[1:12:01] right there why don't we stand to our
[1:12:02] feet by the grace of the Lord here
[1:12:03] that's 40 I've went about 47 minutes
[1:12:05] little bit
[1:12:14] over all right yeah let's stand to our
[1:12:16] feet by God's
[1:12:21] grace and now uh as we'll get to next
[1:12:24] time by God's grace the reason this
[1:12:27] meant so much to me is because I had so
[1:12:29] many people come up to the altar when I
[1:12:30] preach
[1:12:31] this and I didn't preach on Bale worship
[1:12:34] this is all new to me but when I
[1:12:35] preached on the
[1:12:37] Groves we saw how Groves was like this
[1:12:39] Forest that was built up and Gideon
[1:12:42] Gideon's dad would sneak in there with
[1:12:44] all the men of the town if you read the
[1:12:46] scripture they wanted to kill gon for
[1:12:48] cutting down the Grove after they would
[1:12:51] do their outward religious worship to
[1:12:53] Jehovah they would sneak down into the
[1:12:55] Grove like that and they would worship
[1:12:58] baale and they would do all these evil
[1:13:01] things and what is it it was secret sin
[1:13:04] right and it kind it ties in perfectly
[1:13:06] with this morning's message anything we
[1:13:08] do in secret that we're scared of
[1:13:10] somebody finding out is a Grove in our
[1:13:12] life can everybody see that by God's
[1:13:13] grace they snuck in there did all these
[1:13:17] evil acts aail who knows what Gideon's
[1:13:19] dad was doing look at all these things
[1:13:20] that they did it kind of depending on
[1:13:22] how advanced you were you know to the
[1:13:23] Bale
[1:13:24] religion but the idea and the purpose
[1:13:27] behind this is to show you that these
[1:13:29] Spirits are still working today can
[1:13:31] everybody see how the spirits are still
[1:13:33] working and they cause people to sin
[1:13:36] secretly and if if even that
[1:13:39] advances it goes to the spot where you
[1:13:41] have like the sins of Sodom where the
[1:13:43] Bible said they're defiant and they
[1:13:45] don't care they're bold and they'll
[1:13:47] declare their sin before everybody
[1:13:48] that's Isaiah chapter 3 the Abominations
[1:13:51] they're not scared who sees them sin
[1:13:53] they so bold with their sin uh they're
[1:13:55] just prideful and arrogant against the
[1:13:57] Lord and so we want to make sure we look
[1:13:59] at that now I'm going to read one more
[1:14:00] scripture First Kings
[1:14:02] 18 so think about our lives that's why
[1:14:05] we're here think about our lives think
[1:14:07] about things that we do in the privacy
[1:14:09] of our own home that's why I brought it
[1:14:11] out B worship was connected with secret
[1:14:14] sin God didn't want secret sin God
[1:14:16] wanted public worship right God don't
[1:14:18] want people sneaking off and doing
[1:14:20] lustful things God wants everybody out
[1:14:22] in the public Everything Seen that's why
[1:14:24] I think live stream's a good thing the
[1:14:26] whole world sees what you're doing well
[1:14:28] that's how it is all no matter what
[1:14:30] right you want everybody to know that we
[1:14:32] love Jesus we're serving him we're
[1:14:34] keeping away from sin and we have
[1:14:35] nothing to hide but see when people
[1:14:37] start hiding away from fellowship hiding
[1:14:40] away from other churches right hiding
[1:14:42] and doing things there's there's a
[1:14:44] reason you need to be concerned about
[1:14:46] that and so we want to make sure we have
[1:14:48] the right
[1:14:49] Spirits okay I just want toh read this
[1:14:52] where Elijah said
[1:14:54] verse 21 Elijah came unto all the people
[1:14:56] and said how long haot you between two
[1:14:58] opinions if the Lord be God follow him
[1:15:00] but if baale and follow him and the
[1:15:01] people answered him not a
[1:15:04] word praise the Lord all
[1:15:08] right let's have word of prayer if we
[1:15:10] can by God's
[1:15:12] grace Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:15:14] this word of God here tonight Lord we're
[1:15:16] looking at throwing down the altars of
[1:15:21] baale Lord we see this type of worship
[1:15:24] this satanic type of worship we can see
[1:15:27] Lord I can see and I hope to I hope it's
[1:15:29] right I hope I've tried to keep the
[1:15:32] balance of the word here Lord and try to
[1:15:35] watch and discern Spirits dear
[1:15:37] Lord as we said not to be critical but
[1:15:40] to keep others from it dear Lord and if
[1:15:43] people we meet that are caught in these
[1:15:46] things Lord we would have the heart we
[1:15:49] would have the desire to correct
[1:15:52] them
[1:15:54] and Lord the Bible says he that turns
[1:15:56] someone away from Air saves a multitude
[1:15:58] of
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:01] sin Lord I imagine Lord different
[1:16:07] ones Lord I would imagine everyone
[1:16:10] there's times where Satan comes to tempt
[1:16:12] them all alone in their own little Grove
[1:16:15] Lord if it goes to
[1:16:17] sin Lord in those times where we're
[1:16:20] being tempted may we look up to you if
[1:16:22] we
[1:16:23] fallen short may help us quickly to
[1:16:26] repent and throw down any
[1:16:27] altar that might be build it up that we
[1:16:30] might be a holy vessel unto thee dear
[1:16:33] Lord keep us Lord from these spirits
[1:16:37] of selfishness Lord
[1:16:40] God keep us from the spirit of hiding
[1:16:43] keep us from the spirit of Pride to say
[1:16:47] my way is better than God's way Lord
[1:16:50] help us to walk in your path Lord
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:55] and Lord as we look at this later

[1:16:59] just pray it would speak to their hearts
[1:17:01] and lives dear Lord as we got to start

[1:20:36] how we want to be pleasing to the
[1:20:38] Lord I I have a special prayer request
[1:20:40] if you could just pray for me
[1:20:45] tonight I think the Lord's doing
[1:20:46] something in our brother Benjamin's life
[1:20:48] there he's at work right
[1:20:50] now he's really trying to get back to
[1:20:52] the the Lord and there's so much things
[1:20:54] he's told me that him being here today
[1:20:57] was the real hand of God and he was the
[1:21:01] one to come up in the weekend and crying
[1:21:03] minute probably 15 minutes after service
[1:21:05] he was still
[1:21:06] worshiping thanking the
[1:21:10] lord I just would really like if we
[1:21:12] could pray for
[1:21:13] him told him I like some on summer
[1:21:16] vacation I like to spend a lot of time
[1:21:18] with him what it reminds me of is when
[1:21:21] brother Craig and brother Brooks would
[1:21:22] spend time with me I first giv me the
[1:21:25] message so I really would like prayer
[1:21:27] for that I want to be able to give back
[1:21:30] and do what these brothers did for me
[1:21:32] they became my family
[1:21:34] right and I told him I said we don't
[1:21:36] have to study the Bible all day we can
[1:21:37] study for an hour to go
[1:21:39] Fe but it's a sacrifice for my
[1:21:43] family I really feel like I need to be
[1:21:45] there for
[1:21:48] him he's had numerous testimonies like
[1:21:51] you said but if you you would let's just
[1:21:53] have a word of prayer for Benjamin
[1:21:54] please I really feel like this is an
[1:21:56] important time I remember when he first
[1:21:58] came and gave his heart to the Lord we
[1:21:59] prayed for him and you know he just told
[1:22:02] me he got distracted and then God
[1:22:03] brought him back so let's pray some more
[1:22:06] that this week God can really do
[1:22:07] something in his
[1:22:09] life and make those tears uh we see the
[1:22:13] well the tears will fall and then we'll
[1:22:15] we'll reap right tears go forth and we
[1:22:17] bring uh I can't remember the exact
[1:22:20] scripture but she's bringing in the
[1:22:22] precious sheep right that's right tears
[1:22:24] go forth first but then precious sheep
[1:22:26] come later by God's grace let's pray for
[1:22:29] our brother pray for me too Father in
[1:22:32] Heaven Lord we just pray for our brother
[1:22:33] Benjamin Lord God we thank you that he
[1:22:35] was here this
[1:22:37] morning Lord to see a grown man 26 years
[1:22:40] old weeping and crying trying to get
[1:22:43] right with you after all he has gone
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:47] through Lord the the stories are just
[1:22:52] heart-wrenching Lord of all he's had to
[1:22:54] endure because of his
[1:22:57] decisions father may this be a time lord
[1:23:00] where we can be a strength and a help to
[1:23:04] him I remember when I first came in I
[1:23:06] really needed Fellowship I really needed
[1:23:08] somebody there for me so I pray for my
[1:23:12] family and I that we'd be able to give
[1:23:14] him that
[1:23:16] Fellowship granted Jesus and I pray
[1:23:18] you'd Break Every Chain in his
[1:23:21] life all these chains of Idols Lord God
[1:23:24] as we heard tonight Lord everybody
[1:23:26] battles something different but they're
[1:23:28] all Idols lord they're all Idols that
[1:23:31] need crushed and
[1:23:32] stomped and torn down in our lives Lord
[1:23:35] we battle our own Lord our brothers
[1:23:38] freshly coming out of this so Lord may
