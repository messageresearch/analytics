want to teach on the east gate and if that's all right if we could turn to Genesis to little study seems like a gave people a little bit understanding a little better to understand the where the danger lies okay so we want to I just heard brother just sent me a cobra Lu crown from Nepal just sent me a quote he said Balaam and Moses had the exact same anointing an exact same spirit the Holy Ghost was on both of them he said the only difference was the teaching so that struck right down into me so I want to kind of go along those lines about the grace of God the Eastgate hopefully don't mess it up Genesis 2 swoon but sure where she's going maybe I should teach you let's see here I have an old computer so I might have to buy a new one when these days oh you're right there that's okay we got peace like a river we can we can relate rabbits is great so I unplugged it now if I plugged it back in so let's see if you're okay right now I have to do how do we present that remember how is yours um see there you go okay awesome amen praise Lord mine as my cousin Anna me should say st regular the struggling he called st regular no absolutely he's funny I was good to see my cousin Adam there he's had a long journey um but ain't over yet you know God's God well jesus said I'm the hotly was one and that will make you feel like a million dollars [Laughter] mm-hmm praise the Lord Genesis 2 verse 7 will read two scriptures here then will say what a prayer Genesis 2 verse 7 because in the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the Lord verse 8 God the Lord God God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he deformed let's say a word prayer during father Lord Jesus Lord we just yield ourselves Lord everyone Lord just yielding to the Holy Ghost Lord we love you Lord your only hope Lord and Lord we know you're the only one that will stand on Judgment Day for Scott Lord as you come back to grab your bride and each one's judged Lord and the works are burnt thoroughly to see what's of God and what's not and the Lord Jesus we just love you Lord we're trusting in that saving blood Lord we're trusting in the Holy Ghost making us sinless in the soul God we're so sinless loaded that we're not worthy just going to tribulation god that will not worthy to see death or death or even taste of it Lord we're counting on those things Lord we believe them Lord may we just just be so reverent well God we love you Lord bless I still study Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have her seats are the grace of God I want to teach on the East Gate on the east of gate so here's what we read here it says and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he'd formed okay so now this is the beginning God is now starting to deal with with man and flesh of flesh man God creates the entire world and he picks this little area up and he calls the whole Dominion the whole domain Eden but then he says in the eastward part the very east part not the north not the West not the south but on the east part of this region Asst state country province way to say God has eat and he places a little garden here he planted a garden eastward in Eden notice Adam didn't plant it even planet but God Himself planted the garden right there all Adam had to do was keep the garden pure that's all he had to do was work the tools whatever God gave him to do and he didn't have to specifically make anything speak anything the existence and and planted himself but it was already good to go he just had to keep things in order now as we continue on by the grace of God Genesis 2 and 8 says and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and Genesis 3:22 this is a after the fall says and the Lord God behold man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever correct therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims not singular cherubim but plural cherub limbs to cherubims right he says what and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the Tree of Life which tells me what there was only one way into this garden it was on the east side of that garden was the entrance into what would God's perfect place for man this isn't he placed on the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims notice it's like flaming sword and if you don't like the Holy Ghost you wouldn't make it back into that garden it's what the world with the Holy Ghost power amen the word was fire amen absolutely and as the fall has taken place we find now after the fall twins being born Adam knew his new Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain said I've got to the man from the Lord we know that's the second line in the Bible and she the the the second false preacher in the Bible and she began and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground he's in the price of the time he came to pass that brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord he says the fruit of the ground and offering the Lord and Abel also brought forth the first thing with his flocks in the Panther up and the Lord had respect and Abel and to his offerings correct now notice what the Prophet says here in 53 he says look here he says but when I see Cain they wanted it seen they more immoral they were he's all mortal sorry they they've got to get away they've got to get find favor with God he says and they go out and get some different ones he's the fruits of the field and so forth to make a sacrifice to find they try to appease the wrath of God the judgments of God that's been passed upon them Cain toiled a hard he says no doubt raised a nice crop of fruit he's now watch Cain was just as religious just as much of a gentleman in every respect that Abel was just a pure Christian and he wanted to be closer to God two brothers rise up in the church he says and we want to grow closer to Christ he says in every aspect the Abel was now not by good works we are saved by his mercy then they both came up to worship before God he says I believe it was at the east of the gate the exact same place where them cherubims were guarding with flaming swords that he believed he says he says there was the altar was set there right by the entrance there and to order him to bypass those angels they have to cover that altar with blood of course we know that's what God was looking for but each brother brought forth their sacrifice one was fruits he said the other one was what the Lamb of God Lamb of God he says and I believe they called right before his presence there where that flaming sword was running around the east side of the guard like that guarding the Tree of Life so everything's pointing east everything's pointing east everything's pointing to the east side absolutely now next we see Cain rejected and as my old pastor brother brother Brooke said God actually gives Cain an opportunity for the holy ghost he said if you would have just done like your brother he said I would give you the Holy Ghost why because it was first towards him he was the older but he failed Genesis 4:13 and Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear behold thou has driven me forth from this day the face the earth he says I'm from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive I beg abide in the earth and so gonna pass to everyone that finds me shall slay me so here God gives him what the mark the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him we know that was the first person with the soul that got the mark of the beast in fact that was the mark of the beast that mark marked the Beast and fluid that beast seed line correct now did when Cain left the present Lord because we know after that directly as he takes the mark the Beast the Bible says he left the presence of God he says Cain left the presence of God so so did this caused him to become an atheist altogether and lose his religion did he start a rock-and-roll band and did he did he go and do devil signs and did he do this and to do that and all these worldly things no he was just as religious now look what happens and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord he leaves now and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the East of Eden the exact same area or location the same general specific direction the opening of the Garden of Eden was it was on the east side which is where near the east gate he did not go north he did not go west or south across the globe and sail stormy seas and go through deserts but he stayed in the exact same area location he stayed right there and he was still on the presence of God though he was close to the gate this study came from this one quote I'm gonna show you right here look what the Prophet says him he just reads Genesis 4:1 partner 50 girls the only travel man hand was was by horse or by foot and he goes out by gentleness my thought see science has done is he's he said that's the devil you know that that's right brother branham yes sir he says now he lets goes to Genesis forces and Cain went out from the prints of Lord now wash the first thing he done you tell me you tell me when you think we got enough cuz here I'm stopping anyway see Cain went out from the prints Lord that's there he made his mistake and there is where you will make a mistake and there is where I'll make a mistake the very minute we walk out of the presence of God he's dealing with Genesis 4:1 he says Cain went from the presence of the Lord and dwelt a Nod on the East of Eden and locals upfront the inspiration the spiritual eagle revelation and eyes he says see how religious it was this was not a worldly move this was not an anti ah--this or anti that or some kind of new idea move he says this was religious and we know this because the prophet no he says see how religious it was he says went around to the east side he says the east side I read this quote nothing in the east side what is so prevalent or prominent what is so important about the east side of Eden I thought on it for about a week the east side the east side I'm thinking the east side in Toledo so we know hi we have the the west side and we have the east side now the east side of Toledo is across the river and they say their East Siders a little bit different and about five about five years ago I did a job on the east side weight high school right on the east side of Toledo and they are different I am a witness there is a different mentality I work with the gentleman from from that east side area and he has a little bit different mentality there the way he thinks is completely almost backwards the way I think and everyone else around us he's thinking different it's almost like survival mode I can't even explain is different but here he says he says look how religious see how religious it was but notice if we think spiritual if this was a religious move the rest should be religious to and came when of the presence of Lord and dwelt in Land of Nod on the East of Eden and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and he builded a city he started making himself a kingdom making himself a name religious name building his empire in religion verse 40 I'm sorry Genesis 4 verse 19 and Lamech took unto him two wives that seed what now dealing with two churches instead of one absolutely now he says for it instanced 53 his furnaces many of them like that from the how look like how that formal religion he said he calls it formal religion beginning Kane how it come all the way out and come down through the sons of Noah ham out of ham head he had Nimrod Nimrod but the tower bable bable comes down to the king at his time and all in all to revelations Babylon how that little seed started way back there at the east side of the gates of Eden coming on down winding out all kinds of costs and everything started back there winding themselves because it was a religious smooth he says he says and it was formal religion that's right but notice the Prophet could look at that scripture and he could identify by what action right now we've covered this I think I've hit this here before but I wanted in Luke 14 1 and it came to pass when he went on the house and one the chief priests to eat bread on the Sabbath day that they washed him watch to Jesus Christ he says and behold there were certain men before him they were had to dropsy and jesus answered spake to lawyers and Pharisees saying it is is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day and they held their peace and they and he took him and healed him and let him go and answered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day and they could not answer him for these things and he put forth a parable to those things forbidden when how he marked how they chose out the chief roomed so he marched them by what outward action by a movement by choices they make the way they set up their shop the way they carry themselves and conduct their actions he marks them by their actions because what it's the follows the same line they were watching him and Christ did exactly the actions that a true Christian would do and he watched them and he says he said this goes all this is he says he marked them just like all the way back to Cain correct now I start on what is the significance of the east the east side these gate what is it and then I thought about Moses he says in Hebrews 85 says who served unto the example the shadow of the heavenly things as Moses was emerged of God when he was when he was about to make the tabernacle he says see saith he that that will make all things according to the pattern showed thee in the Mount when Moses went up into that mountain got into the presence of God God actually showed him the pattern of the tabernacle he was to build on earth correct absolutely so what exactly now he may have saw it by vision but John was actually taken up into heaven he was on the spirit and the Lord's Day taken up there and look what he saw in Genesis 4:1 he goes there he sees the throne he sees one standing or the sat on the throne that was Jesus Christ he says in verse six and before the throne there was a sea of glass like in the crystal in the midst of their throne round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind he says the first beast was like a lion notice the order he places the order how he sees him exactly how the church ages went he says the first because beasts like a lion the second beast like a captain third beast like a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle exactly showing a pattern one of the Gentile anointings absolute sure and that's exactly what Moses saw because he arranged the camp the exact same way in Ezekiel one and one he says and now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month and the fifth day of the month I was among the captives by the river of Chebar that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God so not only did Moses see visions of up there he says but Ezekiel here was able to catch the exact same vision and look at what he's seeing in verse 5 also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was the appearance they they had the likeness of a man correct and every one had four faces they had four wings and all these things he says in verse 10 he says for as for the likeness of their faces they had for they four had the face of a man the face of the lion they four had the face of an ox on the left side and they four also had the face of an ego see so they see the exact same thing that Moses saw and John saw it even better Amen yes so what's important with the East right but if we go back now to how God had Israel built informed in numbers 2 verse 25 the standard of the camp of dance shall be on the north side by their armies and the captain of the the children and shall be a he's or the son of what's his name now Ephraim was on the west side standard Ephraim Reuben was on the south side and then of course we start the chapter here with Judah and Judah was on the east side toward the rising of the Sun amen and all the others twelve tribes we know these things right three on each side ride short and then each three were under a certain sign or standard right absolutely Dan was the Eagle Ephraim was I believe the the man Reuben was the ox or vice versa and we know Judah was the lion correct and this is a picture I got when probably when the best pictures I I like how he drew this out notice this setup this is the tent this is the tabernacle right here I know it's kind of cooked but I kicked this to the east side just turn it to just turn to the right side okay amen now this is how it was set up in the wilderness here's the east side right here there's only one way in the holy place there's only one way in it's on the east side as well the holiest of holies only one way in it is the east gate this right here is the east gate but as we continue on by the grace of God look at here in numbers 334 8 and this is this is very important right here but those that encamped before the tabernacle towards the east even before the tabernacle the congregation eastward shall be Moses and Aaron and his sons keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the shorter Israel and the stranger that come with nigh shall be put to death so not only not only the Judah and the four others reside there but the priesthood in camp right on the east side and the Prophet could look and see Cain's set up on the east side he's and look how religious Cain's setting up on the east side exactly the order of the priesthood absolutely I think that's powerful yes ma'am now think on this now Jesus comes out of the tribe of Judah correct not just one side because here in Matthew one is doesn't jacob begat joseph the mary of the husband or joseph the husband of mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ he says so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations and from David and the carry over Babylon is fourteen generations and from the carrying away into Babylon the Christ are fourteen generations now the birth of Jesus Christ on this wise when he was with mother his mother and Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together he was found with the child of the Holy Ghost and as you go down here by the grace of God since the beginning Abraham begat Isaac Isaac we had Jacob and Jacob begat Judas which is Judah right so on this side of the genealogy it ends it stems from Judah but then I've heard this is what mary side and then Joseph side or however but if you look at the other side here in Luke 3 and 20 I guess if he was 2000 to 33 there he says which was the son of I'm Abinadab which was the son of Aaron which the son of Esther on which his son of Ferris which was the son of Judah so both sides Mary and Joseph stemmed from Judah all right and we know by scripture revelations 5:5 that Jesus Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah that's where Christ would come out of because he would come from everything comes from the east when he comes back to the earth on this side it'll be from the east side absolutely it'll be from the eastern sky sure everything the Sun rises in the east like we shared this morning absolutely and the Bible says the armies of heaven will follow the lamb absolutely so the moon will come as well from the east sure now now what's so special about this line or the alliant the east gate this lion here in 1st Peter 5:6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you he says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion already in the ephesian church age even before then this is Peter still alive this was before the Ephesian this is the pure church Satan was already tapping into the lion anointing right he says as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour now like how Barnes puts this he says walking about seeking whom he may devour devour he says naturist have observed that a lion roars when he is aroused with hunger for when he is most fierce and most eagerly seeks his prey absolutely sure so he was so upset by Jesus Christ coming and dying on the cross coming and down to hell taking the keys of death hell in the grave and then not set in captivity captive that he's now angry it gets him fired up like I thought I was defeating you here you come and want me Amen sure so comes back up that same spirit that fed that came off Christ fella Pentecost in the same spirit that was on Judas now comes back as a line anointing as well as a lion roaring angry but then if you look he says because your adversary the devil the cow he comes as a lion he says the word here the adversary the word here used is a forensic term and signifies a court adversary it goes back to the law all one that litigates a point in law or opposes another an action or suit he says at law the Jews have adopted this word into language and explains it Bible ah a law adversary didn't you do this sister didn't you do that brother this how about that brother he just did the other day what were you thinking in your head over there brother sister oh my and he tasted lawyers is it you know you're a sinner you'll never make it he said this is time comes right out of what the roaring of the lion the one lion brought forth just blazed the law did away with the law this lying and going to now of Satan now places the law back he says Satan accuses men of the breach of law and please the justice might take place and punish would be inflicted in which he pursues with great violence and diligence absolutely the line anointed sure now continue on he says everybody it's just becoming a neurotic age everybody's all built up haven't got no time and that builds it out to a place that breaks up things it causes people to have hard feelings when they snap them off and say things they don't mean to say he says now everybody's guilty I'm guilty you're all guilty says we do things under pressure that we wanted to do otherwise so they they've they've got an access pressure built up today I believe before I go any further I might say this I believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing I believe it's the devil and he brings it back to what and we know the coming of the Lord his hand and the Bible said in the last days he says now look how the prophet places us he says that in the last day the devil would go about roaring lie a line he places that scripture to the last days the end time and where are we getting convicted right here in the mind our greatest battle and not only does he fight you you fight yourself and condemn yourself he says that the devil would go about like a roaring lion and he could get you under pressure hurrying and running over something you'll make decisions that you want to make if you'd sit down and think it over a man indeed me now demonology 53 he says we know that Satan has gone out like a about like a roaring lion everywhere devouring what he will wearing religious cloaks as a lion as someone that's been behind the back side of the desert what would with the lion a tribe of juda a man sure of course sin in Matthew 7 verse 13 enter you in at the strait gate right no way I'll taught this the Prophet was the one that brought this out so beautifully he said it's not straight like this like a ray like a lion he says but it's straight St a i.t right amen because because Strait is what the gate what is that gate that is the east gate he says in the narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it right he's dealing with the east gate what is the word straightening it is a narrow passage of water connecting two seas or Lord's areas of watery saints of God we were in the world amen but when we went the waterway what Hitler hid the baptism we went from the worldly people and we're planning on going to a heavenly people oh man absolutely we're leaving what from this people and we're going to that people amen but it has to go the straight way the narrow gate the east gate we have the Strait of Gibraltar the Straits of Florida the Strait of Dover the Hudson Strait there's this probably like a hundred streets in the world by the grace of God Denmark Strait the Hudson Strait the straits of mackinac the straits of magellan absolutely sure chains of God we must be so close like we said before how many people how many pastors have fallen away and preachers in this message falling away I know of so many even come to our church in little Napoleon Ohio get behind a pulpit and preach a masterpiece and I'm just going to Wow and where are they today Beck's led back to what denomination Baxton to this to that they had to be they had the ability to bring the Word of God to tie one time we had this one brother he come on a Friday and Friday nights we have prayer meeting and my pastor's wife's just being observant we all went in to pray and we we usually pray for about an hour I don't have you know how it usually goes when everybody kind of gets tired who everyone get up and what we pray the past my pastor's wife sister Julie was sitting back with the children and she watched his brother go like this and he was the guest minister didn't even pray one minute got out and went on Senate bench on the outside the vestibule and got on his phone did not even pray he comes back Sunday morning Sunday night and preaches masterpieces but you could not even pray for a minute and within one year his back slid back into the world but what we find him at the east gate he was able to step behind the east gate and bring the word he found himself what in a Levitical position he placed himself right there and we're praying for the brothers soul we're praying for this for this although whoever but we must be always so careful on these things amen now all through the for those twins Abel and Cain and Abel Isaac and Ishmael Jacob and Esau we know the types of this but I find it amazing that when the King of Kings the Lord Jesus Christ comes the Lion of the tribe of Judah comes in man form God in flesh that his one adversary would be named Judas which is the same word as Judah that this is uncanny only God could write a story like this there would be what as as a roaring lion he was a preacher the Prophet said he had a Holy Ghost filled ministry God Jesus Christ would send the people out two by two he would heal the sick raise the dead signs wonders and miracles come back rejoicing with the other eleven but he was he was he was a false seed absolutely his name was Judah also in Genesis 29 verse 35 and Leah or Leia how you say it she conceived again and bare a son and said now I will praise the Lord therefore she called his name Judah and left bearing that word Judah means praise so that's anointing that lying anointing will get on a man and come up here and be able to preach and this and that and he's looking for praise as well and in John 12 41 says these things saith Isaiah's when he saw his glory and spake of him nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue for they loved the praises of men more than the praise of God oh my on the east gate the Eastside Judah means praise the lion anointing romans 2 verse 28 for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that on that circumcision but which is one outward which is our in the flesh but he is a Jewish as one an inner lead and the circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and now the leather letter whose praise is not of men but of God so we must watch these things the Jesus said he said watch and pray watch with your spiritual eyes and be able to catch things he says pray get her and get into the spirit of prayer and praying God will real things absolutely when the Antichrist himself comes he says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed he says what the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself all it is called God or that is worshipped notice he actually comes now and gets right to the Eastgate but his whole thing was say to me know Satan as a roaring lion he wants the worship as well he says I will be like the Most High he's I'll be most like God absolutely what he wanted that position but he goes to the east gate and every Sunday every Wednesday around the world minister after Minister every church that has service their pastor will get behind entering at the east gate and perform a service but is he is he giving them what they need thousands and thousands hundreds of thousands of Ministers in the world today maybe a million or so hundreds of thousands of pastors in Thailand pastors after pastors I don't women and they're looking to rule they're looking to lead absolutely now this is our set up right here obviously the East Gate right there one way in and we know there's the altar the brass base and the holy place in the holiest of Holies the east gate is so important because directly right there is the altar represents repentance just like the Earth's repented early with crying and breaking up with the Fountains of the deep the altar must be hid and then the brass basin which is the baptism right there the natural baptism baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and those that the Eastgate will teach these faults sometimes they will oh you don't have to repent just sign your name right here just come to church you don't throw a pet and they'll totally bypass the altar oh maybe they do have a hit the altar brother let's repent or wherever let's say the Lord's Prayer but then they baptize them father son Holy Ghost and all these priests in the world today are doing these things depending on the revelation how they're taught in their churches absolutely and then now we come to the message the message of the hour thanks guys we got this dialed and I believe we understand it must be a real true heart felt born religion religious I was like this a letting go of yourself a real dying out now why did God not accept Cain's sacrifice because he says it did had and there was no sound to it it was an uncertain sound God was looking for what the voice of a dying lamp that land must die it was a bleeding out that's the voice that God recognizes someone who wants to die on the altar because what he said Jesus said well my time is coming to you just go ahead and do yours a man and in this day Christ could say I already did it you do it too absolutely it must be a real repentance heartfelt dying out sin killing religion for repentance absolutely every day not just then every mistake amen and we know the true baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ right but when they take people into the holy place what's in the holy place the altar of incense okay we got it alright guys we gotta we gotta make sure we pray very very key that was right before the holiest of Holies and the people the ministers will take him right there we gotta pray absolutely and they'll take him and examine the golden candlesticks and that's the riches right there that's made out of gold that's back in the oil and the poor all these mysteries right out of there everything deal with the Gentiles preach it back and forth the forth and back and forward frontward absolutely back and forth all the way and though hid the twelve loaves of bread the shewbread right there they're going to the Old Testament bring the types and this and that but are they getting people took the holiest of holies are they getting people right there it depends on what Minister what priest is at the east gate No thank God I mean brother Jesse but I came and we were sat on her brother Brooks and he was all about these skate he was he was all about the Holy Ghost there was so many of his sermons that were titled something to do with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost City the power the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost this the Holy Ghost that amen praise God that's what we want a mind that's what we need and you know what he also pushed praise praise is heavy a man it's the form of worship lifting up God giving him we just had Thanksgiving what a week ago did we give thanks to Jesus Christ for everything come on there are refugees in Pakistan they're refugees in Thailand that came in afford to have a Thanksgiving and we sat down had turkey ham and mashed potatoes tamales maybe tacos and we're giving thanks to God for giving us freedom of religion a man praise be to God but saints of God the real freedom is right here the holiest of Holies that's where you know you've had that experience something has taken place not just God putting giving you newest spirit but hitting putting his spirit within us a man absolutely I was so careful by the grace of God I won't be much longer this one do a little bit during Israel's six-day war it was a miracle war they say lasted the short war of six days so during that war Israeli paratroopers from the 55th paratroop Brigade came through the eastern gate of Jerusalem called the Lions Gate and that's how they conquered right there it was not until Israel itself went through the east gate did they gain true some back what does that show tell me anyone related here anyone can pick what I'm trying to tell you Israel was they are gonna have to go through the Gentile way the east gate themselves to be restored amen that 144,000 will have to go that God provided where Hinna a couple of weeks ago is here and preach the forfeiting the seven churches they forsook it but they're going to have to partake in anyhow you guarantee them two prophets will be baptized the name of Jesus Christ and that we stand there for a while going through 144,000 amen and one day and they'll receive the baptism of the holy ghost what are those ordering 144,000 they are actually the bridal chamber yes they serve the bride for all eternity those 144,000 will be in the Millennium the prophecy and they will serve the bride of Jesus Christ their servants Israel's servants but the Gentile is the wife of God hey man praise the Lord Jesus any man praise the Lord that Eastgate is oh so important keep our spiritual ears open our spiritual eyes keen sharp when I go when I go to a service a lot of times I'll just I'm an eagle I just in my sytem I'm eagle and I'll watch everything I listen to everything because I want to pick things up if there's something good I want it if there's something bad I want to see exactly where it came from I want to see exactly the motive I want to see exactly what's going on absolutely we must be we must be able to catch the spirits around as the environment we're in see pick up this pick up that see what's going on around here just sort it and then try and make changes by the grace of God absolutely we are what we are the Messiah adds we are what the eagle lets if we have to be able to get to a point coming up soon we will be able to control nature once again we'll be back into that what manifestation of the sons of God and the Bible says all of creation is groaning for it and he said well he's now all we also within ourselves are growing for the manifestations of the sons of God absolutely but the only way to get back to that point is to go through that east gate and to make sure you hit everything on the way through amen let me see if I got some more notes here by the grease gun this is our new this is what the new the New Testament style right here everything is spiritual correct the outer court is what the body the spirit the holy place in the holiest of Holies of the soul the new birth and the Word of God placed in there now I do see different this is I think actually switched Luke and Mark should be over switched but other than they got everything in correct absolutely I don't know how many people have seen that one before anyhow by the grace of God Saints we must be very very careful for us to miss the rapture it'll be the most tormenting mental tormenting time we'll ever have and that leads what right in to the tormenting or the torture of the Great Tribulation is that the fourth version we rounded up and killed yes we're facing we're in that hour we are in the season of this thing we must be so like I believe it's brother Jesse's preached one time and he thought he said something about being deadly sincere we must be so sincere and the angel of God came to the Prophet said you must be more sincere we have to be exactly right everything we must do our very very best and we'll full count on the grace of God we'll try it well trust on the blood of Jesus Christ will believe in the Holy Ghost to cover the rest but we must do our absolute best I mind if you understand by the grace of God I know the short one but I just wanted to touch that the Eastgate I'm just and I kind of shared this cuz I'm just worried I'm worried for the people in the message and if we as and I'm just a really young minister myself but have we ever as a ministry have we gotten the people to if we entered got everybody entered into the Eastgate and on into the holiest of Holies are we able to push them that way and get them that way lead them as lambs that way are the people in the condition for the rapture are people really in this message really in the condition for the rapture are they ready to go are we totally dead to ourselves is there anything if we wake up at 3 a.m. in the morning and the voice of God says go do this will we do it here right wake up and Lord says quit your job what would I do it or don't go to work today call him and say you can't come in I need you to do this has anyone ever heard those things we're not probably not in that condition yet but we will be there has to be a bride there has to be more a more sincere walk more consecrated way just like I shared this morning I've seen three Eagles this year eating roadkill that shows me the condition of the bride and I broke my heart when I seen it absolutely every time I'm thinking what are you doing why are you eating this isn't there other things you can eat I mean God mercy dekat he's something fresh you know but I see these Eagles two of them I had to stop and wait and they're eating on the road I just kind of inched for heading that way and then they flew off I look back in the mirror they flew right back to it what is that telling us in the natural what is that telling us in the spiritual look at the condition there's a deception coming there's a major major deception coming yes Judas's are among us we must be very in tune with the Holy Ghost we must be able to rightly discern not only the Word of God but the spirit of the person about on behind the pulpit it must be at that condition we have to work our way into the presence of God to where he'll speak to us remember the cleft of the rock I told on that last Thursday john the divine laid in the bosom of christ he laid right there taking communion he laid right in the cleft of the rock and faith wanted to know something so faith asked love and then love could you tell me the secret lord and he did the prophets and you cannot beat your type you don't think there's gonna be a people whose gods who God is going to reveal who's who we must enter into this place the cleft of the rock that is think on this Jesus was put into a rocky cave or grave it was hewn out of the rock and that dead body was placed in there the stone was rolled away Christ the dead body was in the cleft the rock it was sealed in there what took place what happened in there a resurrection Lazarus was put in a rock cave stone rolled over what took place in there what is this white tent envisioned they come out said what happened I don't know I don't know but I'm healed what happened I don't know I don't know they have to get to the cleft of the rock the Bible says the bride maketh herself ready and she comes out of the closet we have to get back to the cleft the rock there's a scripture in the Old Testament where the bones of Israel were laying outside the caves entrance they were laying outside the caves entrance had those bones been inside the caves entrance and the cleft of the rock they would have lived absolutely anyhow let's just say a word of Prayer I know it was a short but I feel like that was important to share during father Lord Jesus we just love you Lord and Lord God even as Moses and the real priests of God stand at the east of gaze and sigh and cry for the abominations done in the holy city Lord remember that sighing crying God was not a none of the sins in the world Lord he was in the sins in the church yes they were crying out for Israel to be saved and to be made right and Oh God the Prophet said don't pray for America don't pray for this or that but we got to pray for one another pray for all the seed of God to come out and or Jesus Lord may we be ever so watchful and know God show us Lord please keep us the Bible said to be so close the anointed ones the endtime would be so close God Lord to deceive the very elect if it was possible Lord and Lord even then all our hearts Lord even the forefront of our mind God we don't want to be deceived Lord please keep your bride in this hour we know you will Lord we're just trusting that each one here Lord is the Bride of Christ that we're looking forward to our body change to our great come up hither to our changing and Lord Jesus Lord we just need your presence so much more in our lord please be with us Lord keep us Lord God give us Lord a double portion of the Holy Ghost that baptism Lord Lord towards all the sinners burn out of us toward God give us strength God Lord and Lord Jesus or give our pastor brother Jesse eyes and ears to discern who to let behind the pulpit Lord Lord grant him supernatural ability got Lord God given Holy Ghost filled wisdom Lord to discern someone who just wants to get by the Eastgate God and receive glory or praise Lord or to deceive or to bring forth a false word lord give him eyes to see and ears to hear and with God greater and greater Lord Lord Jesus we just love you Lord best to hear his lord we know his short Lord but Lord we wanted to convey this little thought God we just love you Lord grana in the name Jesus Christ amen [Music] Saints I just I just worry a lot about this age you know even the prophets said about Abraham whenever Abraham made a mistake brother Graham said he said he he doubted slightly he always said slightly when he told his wife out twice he said he doubted slightly he always put that little bit of grace in their form and saying sometimes I think about myself and I doubt slightly man am I ready am I am i real have I really received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I see the continual battles in this flesh I see the continual mind battles eating me up and I say Lord have I arrived am I ready to go but just like a brother said he says we can't do it ourselves but we know how to ask for it we have to ask for the Lord Jesus Christ - Lord finish this work make I want you to live through this vessel God controlling not sinless flesh but sinful flesh God having full control of a body that was born in soon if the devil thinks he got a smack in the face by the living Jesus Christ when with no sin what is he gonna he's going to be beside himself he goes haywire in the Great Tribulation because now God has used the people who have a sin in their vessels to warp him just like crashed it amen amen that's all promise amen for sure you can count on it because the Word of God guarantees it amen that's why we have to look at the seed the Bible says we're sinless when I go out and I do something bad or listen Ed I shake myself repent I'm sinless once again because what you have to be worthy to miss this to make this rapture you have to be counted as the Bride of Christ Christ is sinless and he's coming for a sinless bride and that comes through what the sealing of the Holy Ghost absolutely but I just see if you want to come thank you for a hack giving your attention Saints we appreciate that talk about the Satan trying to copy the genuine hey man that religious spirit perhaps there was only way one way to know he said that's the word test Jesus said I lead and guide you into all the truth of the word man you find people say oh I can do without the preaching on either preaching that's a good test right there any mine we need more preaching of the word any man remember we need more preachers brother Graham said for the rapture he said do all you can he said then God will take care of the rest [Laughter] a lot of shaving down for you and I he said but together we'll make it a race of God help me Lord because we're alternately trusting in him we do what we can in our ability and God honors that but the rest will be made up by the grace of God amen thank God brothers have a wonderful message for a beautiful beautiful Judah Judas is the name Judah that's striking I read that a few years ago I forgot all about that look how close it was Jesus from the Tri Oh Judah and there's Judas or Judah in the program so there's twins it was twins both form from Judah named Judah but one was actually from the tribe of Judah Amen hallelujah what a thought I thank God for His mercy and his love and how do you know what one sells out the word one stays with the word how men are gonna sell out the world to have received Christ that's what we've done we must sell out the world and gain Christ but see the st. Judas he's gonna sell out Christ the word to gain the world you're they're gonna sell out one of the other either gonna be fully devoted one of the other either sold out to the word or told out to the world money cares of this world we're sold out for Christ here thank God we're so out for Jesus Christ hey man I'm so happy about that praise Lord in the Lord struck something to me in the holy place the sanctification you have the the bread 12 loaves the seven the candlesticks the Rams are the seven candlesticks we just went over last week he said without the illumination of those candlesticks the brilliance of them he said you'll never get into the holiest of holies in other words the seals you know the seven seals and then those twelve loaves had just struck me today those twelve those loaves were presented the bread and there's 12 New Testament Bible mysteries isn't that striking and Scofield lists him right here he lists eleven of them but there's actually 12 because he missed one of them and brother Ram brings that out in the message as serves us as the endtime in that striking seven Church ages twelve new testament mysteries then prayer so we've got to know those that was beautiful beautiful just struck me the seven twelve and you got your your prayer that brings you in we have to know those mysteries we have to know all that and that will bring in us bring us in the presence of God to be born again my this word is really opening and Simon preached the forfeiting of the church ages where he the Lord showed to him the church ages were in the book of Joshua the book of the church ages was in the book of Joshua and also due to Romany man this thing is coming alive by the grace of God and we're just and like this even this morning's message we're just seeing more and more of what we already know was the truth and it's showing us more proof infallible proofs that this is the word of the hour it's not making us doubt or making us weaker but it's confirming everything we've already heard shown it's more and more the truth that we can arrest our souls upon thus saith the Lord from the Word of God want to thank the Lord you know for his word and and also thank the Lord for sending brother Simon this week and it was truly a blessing when I got his text and said do you still want me to preach on Sunday it's like a wave of relief when over me Oh hallelujah I forgot all about that so we were feasting on manna from heaven and that's why I'm happy tonight we'll just singing though windows of heaven are open the blessings are falling too now there's joy joy joy in my soul for Jesus makes everything right I gave him my old time garbage he gave me a robe up you I'm feasting on men from heaven that's why I'm happy to the windows of heaven are Obed the blessings are all into now there's joy joy joy in my soul since Jesus made everything right Laurie I gave him my old tattered carpet he gave me a robe up you are feasting on Nana that's my happy - now let's see one more time the windows of heaven are oh god blessings are falling - there's joy joy joy in my soul since Jesus made everything right I gave him my old tech garments he gave me a robe up you ha I'm feasting on manna from bed and that's why I'm happy yesterday I just asked the Lord to help me remember this but yesterday I was talking to somebody about all my things my friend Brian floor you know I was saying I said we have such a hard edge to live in because the Bible said Jesus had to shorten the days that the elect might be saved that even someone would be saved so we're coming down where the door is closing and fewer and fewer people are gonna be saved here in America we have the hardest time we put we pour hours in the studying and praying you guys pray hours at the church we pray before service you know we devote all this time and it seems as we're seeing less but it's the hour that we're living in Jesus said the love of many here's a second one the love of many shall wax cold because iniquity abounds the love of many shall wax cold so we're getting we're living in a colder age there's fewer people to be saved right the Bible said they love pleasures more than lovers of God we're living in such a difficult age living right but we must not be discouraged we must trust in the Word of God we're gonna have to battle we're going to we may have smaller numbers who knows we who knows but we've got to be convinced that we're in the right and that we know Jesus Christ we have a real personal experience we've been in the holiest of holies
