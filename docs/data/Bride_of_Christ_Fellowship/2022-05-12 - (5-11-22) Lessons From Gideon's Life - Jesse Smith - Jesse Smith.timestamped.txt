[1:33] there's so many great lessons here in
[1:34] the bible don't you just love just
[1:36] combing through the bible just scripture
[1:37] by scripture i just i'm just
[1:39] so blessed by that brother ray said he
[1:41] laurae said sunday's message was the
[1:43] best mother's day message he ever heard
[1:44] that was encouraging to us you know just
[1:46] thankful that uh god could bless each
[1:48] one you know and minister thank you for
[1:50] your prayers for one another too that
[1:51] was really beautiful is everybody
[1:52] praying for one another and
[1:54] loving god and worshiping god and thank
[1:56] you for praying for our mothers and
[1:58] trying to be encouragement to them
[1:59] praise god
[2:00] and the fathers and the soon-to-be
[2:02] mothers by god's grace
[2:04] little ones when they grow up they might
[2:05] be mothers you know so just what a great
[2:08] time in the lord
[2:10] and uh
[2:11] so thankful for god's amazing grace
[2:13] judges chapter eight
[2:16] so
[2:17] as we go into judges eight we start
[2:19] seeing gideon's downfall into what we
[2:22] would we would call a maybe a
[2:23] backslidden condition
[2:25] you would see
[2:26] up to now this man has been just a model
[2:29] of faith
[2:31] but here beginning in verse one we start
[2:33] seeing in verse two and three you start
[2:35] seeing his downfall
[2:37] remember we can learn lessons from even
[2:39] mistakes right how many ever learn
[2:40] lessons from your mistakes
[2:42] yeah even that nature
[2:44] vote as high as i can go to
[2:47] yes we constantly learn oh like next
[2:48] time when this comes again the next time
[2:50] i'll overcome it next time
[2:52] by god's grace and that's what we see in
[2:54] gideon's life remember these people
[2:55] couldn't have the baptism holy ghost
[2:57] like you and i could have
[2:59] so while we while we can understand a
[3:01] little bit about them having struggles
[3:02] we should live a life that's a higher
[3:04] spiritual life than them
[3:06] because remember the least in the
[3:08] kingdom of heaven jesus said is greater
[3:09] than john the baptist that's
[3:11] relationship that's by blood
[3:13] praise god so it's the blood of jesus
[3:15] christ that washes away all our sins
[3:17] takes us out of the power of darkness
[3:19] into the power of god's light in his
[3:21] love
[3:22] judges eight verse one
[3:28] let's just read verse one just for
[3:30] time's sake it's already seven 15.
[3:31] hopefully the live streamers now got it
[3:33] on there by the grace of the world
[3:35] okay yeah my wife just got it hopefully
[3:37] stephanie gets it there soon i just got
[3:38] the email
[3:40] okay all right we'll be looking at the
[3:41] phone hopefully much more unless i got
[3:43] notes on there let's read first one
[3:44] together this first one then we'll have
[3:45] a little word of prayer all three one
[3:48] two three and the man of ephraim said
[3:51] unto him why hast thou served us thus
[3:54] that thou called us us not when thou
[3:57] went us to fight with the midianites
[4:00] and they did chide with him sharply so
[4:03] as soon as he gets this major victory
[4:05] the victory
[4:07] we would think would be impossible
[4:09] as soon as he gets the victory he starts
[4:11] getting rebuked by his brother
[4:13] ever sound familiar god does something
[4:15] in your life god blesses you and then
[4:17] all of a sudden
[4:18] adversity comes right away
[4:20] just had a great testimony now there's
[4:21] adversity the very next moment right
[4:23] yeah that's the life of a believer
[4:25] but you know god's called you this life
[4:26] and how many are going to overcome in
[4:28] this life amen we should expect
[4:30] blessings also expect trials yes and say
[4:32] god give me the grace to go through my
[4:34] trials
[4:35] help me to have the right testimonies
[4:36] let's buy our heads for one more word of
[4:38] prayer if you ever need on your heart
[4:39] let's just make another to the lord i
[4:40] have needs here tonight
[4:42] i'm sure we have many many sick and
[4:44] afflicted out there you know in families
[4:46] and then also
[4:47] just our friends around this nation and

[6:05] night it's important to you lord god
[6:07] this night this service is important so
[6:09] are minister to us in jesus christ's
[6:10] name and everybody said amen amen god
[6:13] bless you your being praise god
[6:19] everybody believe they can learn some
[6:20] good lessons from gideon's life amen
[6:23] you're gonna see you're gonna you might
[6:24] be a little shocked here some other
[6:26] things if you haven't heard gideon's
[6:27] life in a while
[6:29] might be a little shocked to
[6:31] look at some of the things from his life
[6:32] here tonight but i'm sure be a blessing
[6:34] to you
[6:39] so we begin chapter 8 and we see now
[6:42] gideon
[6:43] gets some
[6:46] criticism from his brothers in the lord
[6:48] this is the tribe of ephraim
[6:51] right so now he begins getting
[6:52] criticized every got criticized by
[6:53] another christian oh yeah yeah we all do
[6:56] it right we all get criticized and
[6:57] sometimes if we're honest we criticize
[6:58] other people too
[7:00] we're all guilty another brand member
[7:02] that's the one thing about the brother
[7:03] man battle was a critical spirit
[7:05] and i could say too i battle that also
[7:07] we're just human right
[7:10] sometimes we forget where we come from
[7:13] sometimes we forget what we used to
[7:14] struggle with and also how long we
[7:16] struggled with it right
[7:18] hallelujah
[7:19] yeah you know as austin and i talked
[7:21] about getting the holy ghost i said i
[7:22] got to remind austin you know but
[7:24] awesome it took me almost two and a half
[7:25] three years to get the holy ghost
[7:27] and then my mind goes back all the
[7:29] trials i went through and all the hard
[7:31] times and
[7:32] all the all the doubts and everything i
[7:34] went through and how come god didn't
[7:35] send me america how come god never gave
[7:37] me an angel
[7:38] but i'd be frustrated sometimes how come
[7:40] brother brown got to see angels and i
[7:41] don't i'm praying for him you know just
[7:43] things like just human mind battles you
[7:45] know yeah that we would face and
[7:47] i want to see visions you know i want to
[7:50] i want to hear that i just love to hear
[7:51] the voice of god sometimes that would
[7:52] frustrate me because i hear brother
[7:54] branham oh he got to hear the voice of
[7:55] god
[7:56] you know i didn't get to but you know i
[7:58] i had to learn that the just doesn't
[8:00] live by
[8:01] experiences the just lives by faith
[8:04] amen hallelujah now we thank god for
[8:06] experiences and then we have to have a
[8:08] bible-based experience
[8:10] but the just the righteous ones the ones
[8:12] that love god live by their faith which
[8:14] is the revealed will of god
[8:17] so how many living by that tonight
[8:18] praise god
[8:20] in other words whether i feel it or not
[8:21] i know god's word is true praise god
[8:23] amen and i will act in obedience to the
[8:26] word of god that he's revealed to me
[8:29] amen amen right
[8:31] that's that's this is coming to me right
[8:33] now so maybe this would be fresh here i
[8:34] don't know
[8:35] you know different times we hear people
[8:36] say you got to get baptism after baptism
[8:38] of the holy ghost the different ones we
[8:40] love and then there's other brothers on
[8:42] the internet that say that you get one
[8:44] holy ghost baptism but then many
[8:45] fillings
[8:47] but i just think that's
[8:50] i think that's exalting experience too
[8:52] much
[8:54] because the bible never says that
[8:56] the bible says you get a transformed
[8:57] mind every day
[8:59] and that's the refilling that they're
[9:01] really talking about but some of them
[9:02] actually believe your soul gets a
[9:04] refilling like your soul can leak out
[9:06] the holy spirit imagine that how could
[9:08] your soul have a leak in it
[9:10] it's sealed amen
[9:13] to the day of redemption amen
[9:16] now seals you know that we that men make
[9:18] can leak right they can break
[9:20] but do you think god's seal can break
[9:22] impossible amen
[9:24] hallelujah now the mystery is we have to
[9:25] feed our souls still brother
[9:27] or david says my soul thirsts for the
[9:30] living god
[9:31] so that's that's a little mystery there
[9:33] you know still working on that one by
[9:35] god's grace
[9:37] meditating on that one
[9:39] but the reality of it is is that a
[9:41] believer is sealed and uh he's got to
[9:44] he's got to get uh he's got to have a
[9:46] real we'd say a fresh experience every
[9:48] day so what i mean by that also is that
[9:50] some people will only expect god to move
[9:52] at a big service when a guest preacher's
[9:53] there or you visit another church and
[9:55] they have a special meeting which we
[9:56] love special meetings i love special
[9:58] meetings i'm trying to tell my children
[10:00] not to take that attitude like god can
[10:02] only move at a special meeting god can
[10:03] move tonight praise god we see that a
[10:05] few months ago god can move on wednesday
[10:07] night he could answer prayer the next
[10:09] day amen
[10:10] lord
[10:11] it's just all about god's timing really
[10:14] it's really about god's timing because
[10:15] god doesn't move when we want him to
[10:17] move god moves when he knows it's the
[10:19] best time to move amen
[10:21] that's the point i'm making is that some
[10:23] people live by experience which thank
[10:24] god for experiences they keep us they
[10:26] keep us encouraged as i was praying
[10:28] earlier lord encourage us you know and
[10:30] move them out and encourage it but at
[10:31] the same time
[10:32] i know god is faithful god knows the end
[10:35] from the beginning
[10:36] and so i shouldn't doubt him
[10:38] he's worthy of my song we try to sing
[10:40] that song he's worthy my song no matter
[10:42] whether it's in the good time or the
[10:44] hard time whether he says yes or no or
[10:46] wait he's still worthy of him amen
[10:49] so i gotta i gotta be humble enough to
[10:50] wait
[10:51] make my requests on the goblin and wait
[10:53] and see what god will do about it praise
[10:55] god
[10:56] okay so i just want to lay that i just
[10:58] thought i'd lay it in there i wasn't
[10:59] really expecting to say that
[11:01] but you know let's quickly go over the
[11:03] positives first of gideon's life just
[11:05] brief i'm just going to go real fast
[11:06] be like a machine gun here
[11:10] god often uses the least to do his will
[11:14] so if you if you feel like you're
[11:15] nothing then you're a prime candidate
[11:17] for god to use you amen
[11:19] god shows up david was the least amen
[11:22] gideon was the least in this house
[11:24] hallelujah
[11:25] hallelujah leah was the was not the
[11:28] beloved one right but she had more
[11:29] children than rachel amen
[11:31] she built the house of god right you
[11:33] know just think of that
[11:34] different ones
[11:36] moses had a stuttering problem amen
[11:38] right and god used him to speak those
[11:41] plays and miracles how they speak the
[11:43] word to the people of god amen god often
[11:45] uses those that are despised
[11:48] gideon was brother anderson was a
[11:50] scriptural man
[11:51] he was asking where the miracles were
[11:54] now church we can do that same thing
[11:55] with respect lord i'm in this message
[11:57] lord you've moved before but i want to
[11:59] see more miracles where where's more
[12:01] miracles
[12:02] what that does is it creates a hunger
[12:04] for god
[12:05] it'll make you come to church with more
[12:06] expectation praise god
[12:08] that's the scriptural question
[12:10] right
[12:11] we want to see god move so where's
[12:14] where's scott where the miracles you can
[12:15] ask that respectfully because remember
[12:16] elisha did
[12:18] right he said where's the god of elijah
[12:20] amen hallelujah in other words it's like
[12:22] romans that's calling jesus on the scene
[12:24] of your life
[12:26] how do you want jesus on the scene of
[12:27] your life amen i got five miracles we
[12:30] need right here i want jesus on the
[12:31] scene of our lives amen actually now
[12:32] there's six or seven now with my cousin
[12:35] having kidney cancer and all these
[12:36] things we need jesus on the scene of our
[12:38] lives amen that's why i got to pray even
[12:40] if i don't feel like it i got to pray
[12:42] and be more desperate praise god so i
[12:44] got to get this guy and his feelings and
[12:45] get his thoughts away and i got to get
[12:47] into the channel the mind of god
[12:50] amen
[12:52] also
[12:56] i want to say
[12:57] we have to rid our houses of idols great
[13:00] lessons here
[13:03] we must do that if we want to see all
[13:05] the victories we've got to rid our
[13:06] houses of idols
[13:07] it's a process
[13:12] also you see
[13:14] when you make a sacrifice to confirm
[13:16] something
[13:17] many times god will answer you because
[13:18] he made a sacrifice and asked god that
[13:20] angel to wait so for that sacrifice to
[13:22] be consumed so when you make a sacrifice
[13:25] wait for god to see uh wait wait for god
[13:28] to answer that praise god
[13:30] amen
[13:32] like church many times for me it's
[13:33] giving a sacrifice of money to somebody
[13:36] i know it's going to return sisterhood
[13:37] but i don't know when it's going to
[13:38] return
[13:39] sometimes it returns faster than other
[13:41] times
[13:42] right but it's a sacrifice and i know
[13:44] i'm waiting for god to vindicate
[13:46] right
[13:49] i think we can all relate to that one
[13:50] yeah
[13:51] we help out people financially but we
[13:53] don't always know when the blessing is
[13:54] going to come we don't know what the
[13:55] vindication it might be years down the
[13:57] road
[13:58] years down the road
[14:00] and then finally just at that moment
[14:01] you're not expecting it there it is
[14:03] there it shows up amen
[14:05] how do you praise god
[14:07] so if you make a sacrifice expect god
[14:10] some point he'll back it up
[14:13] and it's okay we learned
[14:15] to prove god's word or test god with a
[14:18] respect
[14:19] because that's what gideon did
[14:21] prove his word in other words go to him
[14:23] in prayer ask him god show me a sign
[14:25] right you did that on numerous occasions
[14:26] at least three occasions he asked god
[14:28] for a sign he tested the lord
[14:30] and he did it now i'm not going to i
[14:32] just kind of slow down i'm not doing
[14:33] that machine gun so i gotta go faster
[14:34] here i just said i was going to do
[14:35] machine gun i didn't do machine gun okay
[14:37] uh we learned god will sometimes break
[14:39] his natural laws to help us learn
[14:41] spiritual laws like the wet and dry
[14:42] fleece
[14:44] god will break a natural log to show you
[14:46] a spiritual law if you ask god you shall
[14:48] receive amen amen hallelujah
[14:52] then god says with faith
[14:54] and the quality of faith not the
[14:56] quantity of people
[14:58] right and we also learned that god
[15:00] doesn't want people to be prideful when
[15:02] he does a miracle right right or else
[15:04] he'll hold off on it or he won't do it
[15:06] or he'll use somebody lesser to do it
[15:08] that's a lesson from gideon
[15:10] god will use a smaller group that's
[15:12] humble than a bigger group that's
[15:13] prideful
[15:15] all right
[15:16] then we also learn faith battles fear
[15:20] and fear remains there but faith will
[15:22] ultimately overcome that
[15:24] hallelujah getting their faith all the
[15:27] way to the same night the same night
[15:29] that he went against the minions he had
[15:31] fear all the way but faith finally got
[15:33] the victory in church don't you know
[15:35] perfect love will cast out all fear
[15:37] praise god
[15:39] hallelujah
[15:41] then we learn god's word as a sword when
[15:43] he speaks
[15:45] like he spoke to those many knights with
[15:47] a dream about gideon
[15:49] and then we also know that our our
[15:51] mouths are a sword as well
[15:53] when we speak god's word amen
[15:56] we saw last week how brokenness makes
[15:58] our life shine
[16:00] praise god
[16:01] being broken before the lord crying
[16:03] before the lord worshiping the lord
[16:04] trusting god in the midst of your
[16:05] hardest tribes
[16:07] that brokenness shines the light of god
[16:09] and it drives the enemy away can you say
[16:11] amen
[16:12] it drives the enemy of discouragement
[16:14] away amen it drives the enemy of fear
[16:16] away it drives the enemy of doubt away
[16:18] praise god amen
[16:19] it drives an enemy of strife that's what
[16:21] minnie and i mean strife division
[16:23] competition criticism it drives that
[16:26] enemy away when you're broken and you're
[16:28] shining your life for jesus and you're
[16:29] standing there with the word saying i'm
[16:31] going to overcome that enemy i'm going
[16:33] to get victory over safety i'm here to
[16:35] fight and i'm here to win by the grace
[16:36] of god amen amen
[16:39] all right now let's look at some lessons
[16:40] here in chapter eight okay i'll try to
[16:41] go faster all right
[16:44] verse one
[16:46] the men of ephraim
[16:49] look at the pride that these men come in
[16:53] god just got rid of the pride
[16:58] with all those what was it uh
[17:00] did you have thirty two thousand you
[17:01] have twenty start with or
[17:03] 30. you start with 32. so with those 31
[17:07] 000
[17:08] let me do my subtraction 700.
[17:11] there's either fear pride and now the
[17:14] very first thing right after the victim
[17:16] rather than testimony is now pride
[17:18] starting to get back in
[17:19] yeah
[17:20] they say why didn't you call us now the
[17:22] right what would the right answer be for
[17:23] this can anybody know what's the what
[17:25] what should gideon's answer been to this
[17:26] why didn't you call us when you went up
[17:28] against the midnight what would the
[17:29] answer be what's anyone know the answer
[17:34] yeah because god said there's not going
[17:35] to be that many how many gods say
[17:38] 300. wouldn't that be the right answer
[17:41] why don't you call us well god never
[17:42] told me to call you that the right
[17:43] answer
[17:44] but what is gideon answer
[17:46] gideon doesn't answer that
[17:49] so here is we see the first step gideon
[17:51] starts moving out of the will of god at
[17:54] church this applies to all of us
[17:57] when we forget what god has told us to
[17:59] do when we forget what the word says
[18:01] when we just get go back to instead of
[18:03] being real strong in faith we just get
[18:04] back to regular everyday talk
[18:07] we lose
[18:08] we lose that influence that we were
[18:10] under
[18:11] right
[18:12] so he starts losing the influence of the
[18:14] spirit that he's under
[18:16] they tied with them sharply
[18:18] they rebuke why did you call us look at
[18:20] verse 2
[18:21] he said to them what have i done now in
[18:23] comparison of you
[18:25] is not the gleaning of the grapes of
[18:27] ephraim better than the vintage of
[18:29] ebenezer in other words he's saying
[18:31] weren't you aren't you isn't your tribe
[18:32] way better than my tribe
[18:35] that has
[18:36] nothing to do with it
[18:38] that's not the reason that gideon
[18:40] did that that's not the reason that
[18:42] gideon didn't call them was because your
[18:43] tribe is is greater you guys are way
[18:45] greater we just wanted something to do
[18:47] that's not why
[18:48] so here we see gideon's first step
[18:51] away from
[18:52] walking
[18:53] faithfully with the lord
[18:55] bless you verse 3.
[18:57] now look what he goes on to say god has
[18:58] delivered into your hands the princes of
[19:00] midian orban seed and what was i able to
[19:03] do with the comparison of you
[19:05] see god deliver those princes what could
[19:06] i do
[19:07] in comparison to you you're so great
[19:09] your tribe is so great
[19:11] he's missing the whole point of this
[19:14] he starts matt gideon starts magnifying
[19:16] them
[19:18] pride
[19:19] church what's the first thing that comes
[19:21] in that usually it's pride
[19:23] right you maybe it's not a lust of the
[19:24] flesh thus the eyes just pride
[19:30] so to get these guys calmed down he says
[19:32] you're so great
[19:35] that's called flattery the church said
[19:38] if somebody's mad at you
[19:39] oh just start praising them oh you're so
[19:41] much stronger than me you're so much
[19:42] greater than me that's not the right
[19:44] answer
[19:45] there's none great but god amen amen
[19:48] jesus said there's nobody greater but
[19:49] god
[19:52] now gideon starts pumping them up to get
[19:54] him to calm down that's the wrong thing
[19:56] he did and it was not the right thing to
[19:57] do
[19:59] why didn't you call us well you're so
[20:01] great we just need we're just a little
[20:02] try we just we just needed a little
[20:04] something to do the size of the tribe
[20:07] has nothing to do with it
[20:08] the size of the church has nothing to do
[20:10] with it it's the size of the faith amen
[20:12] [Music]
[20:13] it's the size of dedication it's the
[20:15] size of love it's a sign of humility
[20:18] amen we must be big in humility praise
[20:20] god amen
[20:24] then their anger was well abated toward
[20:25] him in verse three
[20:27] when he had said that oh so
[20:29] when somebody rebukes you
[20:32] flatter them and pump them up and then
[20:35] that will calm them down that's the way
[20:36] to handle it that's not the way to get
[20:38] that
[20:39] right
[20:40] because you're just lying through your
[20:41] teeth
[20:42] church look how quickly we lose the
[20:44] anointing
[20:46] notice i said we
[20:49] because we all fall short of the glory
[20:50] of god amen
[20:53] he just saw he just broke those you know
[20:56] he just jesus broke those pots and
[20:58] the sword of the lord and gideon
[21:01] then he got a couple victories of the
[21:03] sword and then here he forgets all about
[21:05] that
[21:06] and the anointing has left him now we're
[21:08] going to see a lot of the anointing
[21:10] leaves him
[21:12] a lot of the anointing leaves getting in
[21:13] this chapter
[21:17] and let me just say like this church
[21:18] this is why after gideon there was no
[21:20] more rest until
[21:22] i think if i'm not mistaken david's time
[21:26] hundreds years
[21:28] so in other words gideon was god's last
[21:30] chance
[21:31] can i get another leader like joshua
[21:34] god was trying to find another joshua
[21:36] caleb somebody with a heart
[21:39] that had a different spirit somebody
[21:40] that wanted to follow god all the way
[21:42] praise god this was god's last chance
[21:45] before david
[21:46] can i find somebody that will obey
[21:49] everything i say
[21:52] i'll make sure i make sure i give them
[21:54] all the signs they need he gave him 12
[21:56] signs jersey
[21:57] he gave him twelve thousand lords in
[21:59] other words
[22:00] i'm trying to raise up another justice
[22:02] my last try
[22:04] let me see let me of course god knew
[22:07] but he was given getting that
[22:08] opportunity i'm giving you one more try
[22:12] and let's see if we can turn this people
[22:13] back to their fathers there
[22:15] back to their atmospheric fathers
[22:17] hallelujah amen
[22:19] give him one more try
[22:22] remember he's the fourth judge out of
[22:23] 12.
[22:24] so after him was going to be eight
[22:25] judges that were even worse than getting
[22:27] now what i mean by that gideon was good
[22:29] but you'll see the end of his life was
[22:30] pretty pretty sad
[22:32] if you read the rest of the chapter
[22:34] the end of his life is pretty sad
[22:38] but i say like this he was kind of like
[22:39] a foolish virgin i'll say it like that
[22:42] because in his day who was the real
[22:43] real ones that dedicated and served god
[22:46] with all their hearts joshua who just
[22:48] lived a few hundred years before him
[22:51] right
[22:53] look at verse 4.
[22:56] and gideon came to jordan and passed
[22:58] over he and the 300 men that were with
[22:59] him faint yet pursuing them
[23:03] now you're going to see later there's
[23:04] still about i think it was how many
[23:06] thousands i think it was 12 thousand
[23:14] no there's still fifteen thousand men
[23:15] left
[23:16] a hundred twenty thousand men have
[23:18] already died because of that
[23:20] uh
[23:21] the lights they put up and the shouting
[23:22] and they attacked each other and then
[23:23] gideon's battles 120 000 are already
[23:26] dead there's about 15 000 left
[23:29] and gideon's still going after them yet
[23:31] he's faint he's tired
[23:34] verse 5
[23:35] and he said unto the men
[23:37] i'm sorry i skipped no i'm sorry verse
[23:38] 5. he said to the men of suck off give i
[23:41] pray you loaves of bread unto the people
[23:43] that follow me for they be faint and i
[23:44] am pursuing after ziba and zao muna
[23:48] kings of minion
[23:51] all right let me see there
[23:55] all right verse 6 and the prince of
[23:57] succoth said are the hands of ziba and
[23:59] zamunda now in thine hand that we should
[24:01] give bread unto thine army
[24:04] in other words we we're not going to
[24:06] give you bread until those guys are dead
[24:09] why because these these guys were jews
[24:10] as well they knew as long as they're
[24:12] still alive they might get the victory
[24:14] and then they might punish us for
[24:16] supporting you
[24:17] right so we've got some jews that are
[24:19] afraid
[24:20] to stand with god's people which is no
[24:23] surprise they're a bunch of idolaters
[24:24] right just like eden's dead
[24:27] israel was filled with idolaters
[24:30] verse seven and gideon said therefore
[24:33] when the lord hath delivered now here's
[24:34] a little prophecy here you still got a
[24:36] little bit of anointing on it had
[24:37] delivered ziva and salva muna into my
[24:39] hand then will i tear your flesh with
[24:41] the thorns of the wilderness and with
[24:43] briars
[24:45] how about that
[24:48] all because they wouldn't give them a
[24:50] little bread
[24:51] does that sound fair
[24:53] no it doesn't
[24:55] remember one time dave was going to do
[24:56] that remember that
[24:58] remember dave was going to kill those
[24:59] men that didn't help him and his people
[25:01] right before he met abigail remember
[25:02] that
[25:03] he said i'm going to go kill him who
[25:04] stopped him abigail
[25:07] and david said my the lord hath kept me
[25:09] from doing a wickedness a great sin
[25:14] in other words gideon starts getting
[25:16] this angry spirit about getting revenge
[25:20] he starts getting really mad like i'm
[25:22] gonna get revenge on them
[25:24] they wouldn't give me any food they
[25:25] wouldn't give me any bread when i come
[25:26] back i'm gonna get the briars out the
[25:28] thorns out and i'm gonna rip your flesh
[25:30] up with him that's what this guy says
[25:33] guess what he does it
[25:38] does that remind you of elisha with the
[25:39] she-bears
[25:41] god's true servant but
[25:44] when they get in the flesh what happens
[25:46] they can make a lot of mistakes
[25:48] right
[25:50] god help us to stay in the spirit praise
[25:51] god
[25:53] god help us
[25:54] to do good to bless those who curse us
[25:57] hallelujah
[25:58] to do good to those who speak evil
[26:00] against us hallelujah
[26:03] pray for those who despitefully use us
[26:05] amen but get him done do that gideon
[26:07] says you mistreat me i'm gonna
[26:09] i'm gonna tear you up when i get back
[26:11] i'm gonna put no look he instead of
[26:14] letting the lord have revenge gideon
[26:15] started getting revenge
[26:17] but the bible says avenge not your sins
[26:19] they said let god avenge you hallelujah
[26:22] amen let god fight your battles amen
[26:25] he can spend all that time and energy
[26:27] praising the lord or doing sacrifice or
[26:29] doing something for the kingdom of god
[26:31] in his day
[26:33] but instead he wanted revenge i'm going
[26:34] to get them back
[26:37] what do you mean you said that about me
[26:38] i'm getting you back
[26:41] that mean he was just fired up
[26:46] like he had anything to do with the
[26:47] victory anyway like it was right
[26:49] like 300 guys really were strong enough
[26:51] to defeat 120 000.
[26:56] see what happens um see what happens
[26:58] when people get a little bit of power
[27:02] see what happens when people some people
[27:04] get a few testimonies that are really
[27:06] powerful
[27:08] if they're not careful they get puffed
[27:10] up like well
[27:12] god must be with me more than everybody
[27:14] else
[27:15] i'll just start prophesying and i'm not
[27:18] i think i know what's right
[27:21] now church notice in this chapter do you
[27:22] ever see gideon get the fleece out again
[27:27] do you ever see gideon go into prayer
[27:29] real sincere prayer the rest of this
[27:30] chapter
[27:32] go ahead and read it you're not going to
[27:33] find it
[27:35] where's all that lord i want to see
[27:36] miracles and lord
[27:38] give me a sign i need i got some fear
[27:42] i said he's got some revenge
[27:45] he said he's got some anger i can't say
[27:46] it like this you got a rage monster can
[27:48] i say it like that
[27:52] he knows what i'm talking about
[27:54] rage monster
[27:59] verse eight
[28:00] and then he went up thence to penuel
[28:02] another group of jews and speaking of
[28:04] them likewise and the men of anyone
[28:06] answered him as the men of suckle off
[28:08] that answer now to his brethren has said
[28:10] we're not giving you any foods
[28:13] and he speak also unto the men of penul
[28:14] saying when i come down in peace i will
[28:16] break down this tower they does more
[28:18] than break down their tower they must
[28:19] have a beautiful tower you know watchmen
[28:21] be on the tower watch them what other
[28:22] night they must have a beautiful tower
[28:24] well gideon does a lot more than break
[28:25] down the tower he kills every man in the
[28:27] city
[28:28] is that
[28:29] is that fair punishment
[28:31] would any judge ever say yes because he
[28:33] didn't give you food yes you can kill go
[28:35] ahead and kill all the men in the city
[28:37] that's not fair at all
[28:38] that's that's called murder
[28:42] but remember didn't it
[28:43] uh didn't saul do the same thing
[28:45] right king saul and they had a
[28:48] three-year family because of that yeah
[28:51] well see that's why god gave them no
[28:53] more rest until david because gideon had
[28:56] this perfect i mean it was laid out
[28:57] perfectly this was the perfect
[28:59] opportunity
[29:01] you defeated 120 000 i mean uh this is
[29:04] national or this is the best tent for a
[29:05] national revival you got a leader who
[29:07] really obeys god and
[29:09] he cut down all the uh his name's hugher
[29:11] i mean of all names he cuts down idols
[29:14] and he cuts down idly uh uh idolatrous
[29:17] grows this is the guy
[29:19] yeah
[29:20] but then his humanity comes back in so
[29:22] fast
[29:24] rather than seeking god and asking god
[29:26] for more than i said lord he never you
[29:28] never see him ask god for anything else
[29:29] in this chapter
[29:34] verse 10. now zeba and zamunda were in
[29:37] car corps and their hosts with them
[29:38] about fifteen thousand men all that were
[29:40] left of the host of the children of the
[29:41] east so see there's only fifteen
[29:43] thousand left
[29:44] for their fellow hundred and twenty
[29:46] thousand men that drew the sword they'd
[29:47] already had a hundred and twenty
[29:48] thousand casualties how many was in
[29:51] akron but last time what was the
[29:52] population factor what was it again 190
[29:54] 190 000 okay so a little less than the
[29:57] city of akron
[29:58] casualties
[30:00] from god's victory not gideon's victory
[30:02] god's victory
[30:04] and giving went up by the way of them
[30:05] that dwell in tents on the east of nova
[30:07] and jog bihay and smoke the host for the
[30:10] host was secure
[30:13] so see now we're now we're seeing
[30:15] gideon's sword right the sword of the
[30:16] lord and now we're seeing what the sword
[30:18] of gideon
[30:20] can this guy fight yes he can fight
[30:23] now he's got confidence i'm a fighter
[30:26] but he takes it too far
[30:29] he doesn't uh
[30:31] he doesn't deal justly with these two
[30:33] groups
[30:34] the men of sukkoth and the man of pen
[30:35] you well it doesn't deal with them
[30:36] justly
[30:38] it's not it's not fair to kill someone
[30:41] if they won't give you some bread yeah
[30:43] right right that's not fair
[30:46] verse 12
[30:47] and when ziva and zamunda fled he
[30:50] pursued after them and took the two
[30:51] kings and a midian zebra zamunda and
[30:53] just discomforted all the hosts and
[30:56] getting the son of joash returned from
[30:58] battle before the sun was up
[31:00] and caught a young man of the men of sup
[31:02] cloth now remember that first place that
[31:03] returned him down the first place that
[31:05] turned him down he caught one of their
[31:06] young men and inquired of him and he
[31:08] described unto him the princes of
[31:09] so-called and the elders of even three
[31:11] score and seventy men so he finds that
[31:13] man said what are the names of all the
[31:14] leaders in that city and he gave him the
[31:16] names of 70 men
[31:18] so now look church he's got a hit list
[31:19] he's got a list he's going to kill
[31:21] then that's not for me
[31:23] hit list
[31:24] that's what does that sound like it's
[31:26] god
[31:27] any god
[31:28] just because you didn't give me bread
[31:30] just because you're a little afraid now
[31:31] look they were afraid like he was afraid
[31:32] there it is
[31:34] they both were afraid amen at one point
[31:36] like he couldn't see he couldn't have
[31:38] patience with somebody
[31:40] who was battling fear when he used to
[31:42] battle fear ah there it is right there
[31:44] that wasn't my notes
[31:47] see you can people when we get we could
[31:49] become a stuffed shirt brother we become
[31:51] a stuffed shirt we think we're so great
[31:52] but yeah we forget how little we were
[31:55] how humble we were how weak we were
[31:57] without all that god did for us
[32:00] and now we look down on people because
[32:01] they don't have the faith like we have
[32:03] let's not look down on them instead of
[32:05] looking down why don't we raise them up
[32:06] church
[32:08] instead of pushing them down why don't
[32:10] we raise them up praise god
[32:12] can i pray for you can i help you can i
[32:14] do something to raise your faith
[32:17] instead of pushing them down how about
[32:19] can i help you out can i pray for you
[32:20] anything i can do
[32:22] to help you out
[32:23] yeah
[32:25] not at this time though this man was
[32:28] he was starting to lose that he was
[32:30] power starting to go to his head
[32:32] all this power all these victories
[32:34] he started thinking he was really
[32:35] somebody
[32:37] now church remember this man is still in
[32:39] the hall of fame of faith and the church
[32:42] said amen
[32:44] samson's the hall of fame of fame i
[32:45] can't wait to preach on that guy right
[32:47] goodness
[32:48] oh boy
[32:50] i have to like just
[32:51] go go over some of the stories and not
[32:53] be able to read all the stories
[32:57] but it's a reality
[33:01] he's getting victories now with his own
[33:03] sword
[33:04] he's taking the names of the people that
[33:05] wouldn't give him bread because he's
[33:06] going to go kill them
[33:09] he's going to go on a murdering rampage
[33:11] he becomes what we see you you would
[33:12] call this you call him an executioner
[33:16] right let's execute these 40. i got a
[33:17] list though they're all going down today
[33:19] because they wouldn't give us bread
[33:23] because they were just unsure you know
[33:24] who's going to win and didn't join
[33:26] didn't support me
[33:27] see that's like people today if you
[33:28] don't support our church if you don't
[33:29] come to our church you're going to hell
[33:31] that's what people say that's nonsense
[33:33] jesus said if they're not against us
[33:35] they're for us amen by
[33:38] that's what jesus said
[33:39] i say like this we got more people for
[33:41] us than against us amen hallelujah i
[33:44] don't talk about the world i'm talking
[33:45] about the churches you know there's
[33:46] probably more churches for us
[33:48] that are against us praise god
[33:50] amen
[33:52] unless they're hiding something they
[33:53] could be not they could be hiding
[33:54] something from me but the people i come
[33:55] in contact with
[33:56] they don't seem to be against me so much
[33:58] they seem to be for me
[34:00] [Music]
[34:02] now look at that
[34:05] greece four so he gets a list in verse
[34:07] 14.
[34:09] verse 15 and he came unto the men of
[34:10] sukkoth and said behold ziba and zamunda
[34:13] with whom he did upgrade me saying are
[34:14] the hands of sevens i'm going to know
[34:16] thy hand that we should give bread unto
[34:18] thy men that are weary and he took the
[34:20] hours of the city and thorns of the
[34:21] wilderness and briars and with them he
[34:23] taught the men of sukkoth
[34:25] and he beat down the tower of penuel and
[34:27] slew the men of the city he did exactly
[34:30] what he said he was going to do
[34:32] he took the thorns and tore those men up
[34:36] and the one and then the other one he
[34:37] slew
[34:41] does that sound like a we caught a real
[34:43] man of faith that was the manaface
[34:45] failures
[34:48] failure yeah
[34:53] look at verse
[34:56] 18.
[34:58] then said he unto zeba and zamunda what
[35:00] manner of men were they whom he slew at
[35:02] tabor and they answered as thou art so
[35:04] were they each one resembled the
[35:06] children of a king these are really
[35:07] royal men
[35:09] these are really royal men that he slew
[35:12] and he said they were my brethren even
[35:14] the sons of my mother as the lord liveth
[35:16] if he had saved them alive
[35:18] i would not slay you
[35:21] in other words he just wanted to
[35:23] he would have done anything to slay
[35:24] those guys he was so enraged
[35:27] he said if you were to save them alive i
[35:28] would not have killed you
[35:30] this guy was on a
[35:32] murdering murder murdering rampage
[35:39] verse 20 and he said unto jephthah his
[35:41] firstborn up in slavery now look
[35:43] gideon's first born son he says slay
[35:45] these two men
[35:47] right ziva and salmuna
[35:49] but the youth drew not a sword for he
[35:51] feared because he was yet of you see
[35:52] everybody was battling fear
[35:54] praise god everybody was battling fear
[35:56] they've been in slavery seven years amen
[35:58] oppressed seven years
[36:01] then ziva and zalmuda said rise down and
[36:03] phone us for as the man is so is his
[36:05] strength now look they're rebuking
[36:06] gideon to his face by basically mocking
[36:08] his son
[36:10] saying as a man is in other words as
[36:12] gideon is so is his son in other words
[36:13] they're saying they're saying uh gideon
[36:15] is weak like his son
[36:17] because his son won't kill us
[36:19] so what does gideon do he kills him
[36:23] and getting a rose and slew zebra
[36:25] took away the ornaments that were on the
[36:27] camel's necks now that's straight that's
[36:28] interesting right there church
[36:30] camels the camels these midi knights had
[36:32] these ornaments on them that was an
[36:33] ornament of a king
[36:35] that was a rich person's ornament like
[36:37] you're only if you have rich can you
[36:39] decorate your animals
[36:40] you know they have gold on them jewels
[36:42] all these things hanging on their camels
[36:44] well gideon he kills him he's like you
[36:47] know what i'm going to take some spoils
[36:48] of war here
[36:51] did god tell him to do that no
[36:55] but he starts saying
[36:57] look what i've done i deserve some of
[36:59] these
[37:01] you're gonna see later i deserve some of
[37:02] these treatments
[37:04] like i'm somebody special
[37:06] he starts taking things
[37:08] so in other words this is like taking
[37:09] somebody's money
[37:11] right
[37:14] now we never see god forbidding him to
[37:15] do that either
[37:16] but you're going to start singing
[37:17] remember he was prideful with the
[37:19] ephraim you can start seeing some of his
[37:20] mistakes now he's in a rage murdering
[37:22] people
[37:26] and now he starts taking
[37:28] these valuables from the slain kings
[37:34] verse
[37:36] 22 then the men of israel said in the
[37:38] gideon ruled out over us both thou and
[37:40] thy son and thy son's son also for thou
[37:43] has delivered us from the hand of the
[37:44] many nights did you check that out who
[37:46] delivered them
[37:47] huh who delivered them god did yeah but
[37:51] these prideful men are saying you
[37:53] delivered us
[37:54] and gideon never stops them
[37:57] right he believes i did it
[38:00] that'd be like someone was saying well
[38:02] i'm the one that healed your dad when he
[38:03] was sick
[38:06] it was well it was jose's prayer it was
[38:07] it was brother jesse's faith or it was
[38:09] it was your faith it was bang's faith
[38:12] it's god who did it praise god
[38:15] but be a king over us
[38:18] now this is the one time union does make
[38:20] a good statement in this chapter
[38:24] verse 23 gideon said to them i will not
[38:26] rule over here neither shall my son rule
[38:28] over you the lord shall rule you that's
[38:30] the best thing he says in the chat
[38:33] he will not take
[38:35] kingship over them but he does live like
[38:37] a king
[38:42] not church that's what we have to deal
[38:44] with in laodicea right
[38:46] because if not we're if we're not
[38:48] careful
[38:49] we'll get rich and increase with goods
[38:51] have need of nothing and then what then
[38:53] we forget about god right
[38:55] see how this ties i mean this ties in
[38:57] beautifully with our day
[39:00] we can go from one victory to being
[39:01] prideful the next day
[39:04] thinking like we had something to do
[39:05] with it
[39:07] i heard a preacher make an illustration
[39:08] he's like he's like all we are is just
[39:10] tools in god's hand right
[39:12] alls gideon was was like a rake
[39:16] and then the people want to glorify this
[39:17] rank look what the rake did look at my
[39:19] harvest look at these tomatoes i did
[39:21] look
[39:22] look at these celery look at all this
[39:23] broccoli let's make this this rake let's
[39:26] pave it with gold and let's hang it up
[39:28] let's make a memorial to this ring it's
[39:29] not the rake it's the man who used the
[39:31] rake
[39:32] it's not gideon it's god amen
[39:35] hallelujah
[39:37] all god wanted was somebody humble
[39:40] he started out humble but then he got
[39:43] prideful
[39:44] he started flattering the brothers well
[39:46] you're so much greater than that
[39:48] i didn't call you because you're so
[39:49] great and you know you guys do a lot of
[39:51] good stuff
[39:52] you don't have to do anything
[39:55] okay okay i believe that
[39:57] that wasn't it at all
[40:00] just a string of bad decisions one after
[40:03] another isn't it church don't you know
[40:04] when you make one sin if you don't
[40:06] repent it's easier to sin the next time
[40:11] right and then when you're instant you
[40:12] think i can quit are we talking about
[40:14] that i can quit i can quit uh i could
[40:16] quit something but then when you try to
[40:18] quit it's not easy
[40:20] oh i could give this up well it's not
[40:21] always that
[40:22] actually very hard
[40:25] because your your flesh has a dependence
[40:26] on it but also there's spirits in there
[40:28] as well
[40:30] there's spirits controlling you the
[40:32] bible says
[40:36] that's the one good thing he says i will
[40:37] not rule over you
[40:39] but now here's where he makes a very
[40:41] awful mistake verse 24 he takes their
[40:43] money
[40:44] and he doesn't take it for himself but
[40:46] he takes it either to set up some type
[40:48] of religious thing or some type of a
[40:50] memorial or some type of
[40:53] some type of
[40:55] spiritual
[40:57] memorial i guess maybe the best way to
[40:58] say it
[41:00] this is where it makes a big-time
[41:01] mistake it might be a trophy
[41:06] verse 24 and gideon said to them i would
[41:08] desire a request of you that ye would
[41:10] give me every man the earrings of his
[41:12] prey
[41:13] for they had golden earrings because
[41:15] they were ishmaelites and they answered
[41:16] we will willingly give them and they
[41:18] spread a garment and did cast there on
[41:20] every man the earrings of his prey and
[41:21] the weight of the gold earrings that he
[41:23] requested was a thousand and seven
[41:24] hundred shekels of gold
[41:26] beside ornaments and collars and the
[41:28] purple raiment that was on the kings of
[41:29] the midian and beside the chains that
[41:31] were about the camel's neck so look what
[41:33] gideon got gideon got a lot of things
[41:34] here
[41:35] now one one preacher said this was 40
[41:37] pounds of gold
[41:39] 40 pounds ago
[41:40] how much does that work
[41:45] plus all these purple garments remember
[41:47] lydia was a worker of purple
[41:49] those were royalty oh now you got these
[41:51] nice babylonian garments here
[41:53] all given to who get in
[41:56] what you gonna do with that kid
[41:59] let's see
[42:04] verse 27 and gideon made an e father of
[42:07] and put it in a city even in
[42:10] ophra
[42:13] and all israel went through a whoring
[42:15] after it which thing became a snare unto
[42:18] gideon
[42:19] and to his house now let me say like
[42:21] this church this did not joshua
[42:24] this did not moses this is what aaron
[42:28] did and the church said
[42:30] aaron said where's they said where's
[42:32] moses we don't know where he's at we get
[42:34] bring your earrings any money made he
[42:35] made a gold calf
[42:38] so we have the same thing give me just
[42:39] give me what you got and we'll just make
[42:41] uh e5 e5 was that garment that went on
[42:44] the outside of the high priest and on
[42:47] the e5 they put the urim and thumb
[42:50] this was a very special garment this was
[42:53] the garment of one person the high
[42:54] priest
[42:56] this is the person nature that when they
[42:58] want to know what god wanted they would
[42:59] take that in the prince of god and if
[43:01] the light shined on that then they knew
[43:03] that they got their answer from god in
[43:04] other words this is the person that
[43:06] hears from god
[43:08] so gideon says let's make a ephod
[43:10] now we don't know what he used it for we
[43:12] don't know if he tried to be a priest we
[43:13] don't know but all we know is this
[43:16] became a snare this became a trap of
[43:19] idolatry for gideon and his family did
[43:22] you catch that your sins as parents will
[43:25] ultimately affect your children
[43:28] it just didn't hurt get in and hurt his
[43:30] children as well
[43:32] you're gonna see in the next chapter i
[43:33] will probably preach it but the next
[43:34] chapter
[43:35] one of his sons i think comes along and
[43:36] kills all of his other sons
[43:39] i mean this the effects of these
[43:41] decisions went on for generations
[43:45] church that's why we never put idols in
[43:47] our lives
[43:49] for some reason you want to make this
[43:50] ephod this ephod became an idol and all
[43:54] israel went up a whoring after it kind
[43:56] of like the brass serpent
[43:59] yeah
[43:59] right
[44:01] at one time the bride servant was a
[44:03] health but then it became an idol
[44:05] afterwards
[44:06] oh we worship that worship that where's
[44:08] your back well i'm not really worse but
[44:10] i'm just praying to it but i still
[44:11] worship
[44:12] right still worship just pray to god
[44:14] amen
[44:19] so it almost it seems like it may it
[44:20] also it might be a trophy that he built
[44:22] there in the city or it might be him
[44:24] wanting to be into the priesthood he's
[44:26] associating himself well i'm not i don't
[44:27] want to be a king but you know if you
[44:29] look to me like i'm a judge and like
[44:31] some now he was a judge
[44:33] which means he judged the people but
[44:34] maybe you can look at me a little more
[44:35] like you know i hear the voice of god
[44:37] more than other people
[44:43] everybody see that yeah
[44:46] god did not like that
[44:49] this was the last chance this was the
[44:50] last chance god was going to get pride
[44:52] before david to find
[44:54] a man that could come close to joshua
[44:56] moses in their dedication to god
[44:59] and he just starts faintly
[45:01] one
[45:02] after another afternoon
[45:04] i appreciate getting the victory over
[45:06] faith
[45:08] but then gideon had some
[45:09] failures after that
[45:11] he had some failures
[45:16] see we're all shouting last week when he
[45:18] was getting the victory of the midnights
[45:19] and now we're all thinking god help me
[45:20] not to fall
[45:22] we're all thinking real hard lord help
[45:24] me not to
[45:25] exalt myself
[45:28] help me to let you take vengeance upon
[45:30] my enemies
[45:32] help me not to fight my battles
[45:35] because the battle belongs to the world
[45:38] we're thinking real deep
[45:42] don't you love the word of god this is
[45:43] amazing this is amazing a man who's in
[45:46] the hall of fame of faith
[45:47] it's over samson right as we said samson
[45:49] was in all families what did he do he
[45:52] subdued a nation the bible said yeah he
[45:54] defeated an entire nation
[45:56] with just 299 men
[45:59] then right afterwards he starts letting
[46:01] this victory go to his head well i must
[46:04] be somebody special
[46:06] my goodness god did a miracle through me
[46:08] i
[46:09] kind of deserve that money don't you
[46:10] think
[46:11] man
[46:12] i'm gonna get back at all those people
[46:14] who bad-mouth me on youtube you know
[46:16] i'm gonna get back again
[46:19] i'm gonna condemn them all i'm gonna put
[46:20] a curse on them you know that's kind of
[46:22] like equivalent to today
[46:25] no
[46:26] let god fight our mouths
[46:29] verse 28 thus was midian subdued before
[46:32] the children of israel so that they
[46:34] lifted up their heads no more like
[46:35] lifting up oh god deliver us they
[46:38] finally had peace
[46:40] and the country was in quietness 40
[46:42] years
[46:43] in the days of gideon
[46:45] so because of the faith that he had they
[46:47] gave them a generation what's 40 years a
[46:50] generation
[46:51] because of his faithfulness in that
[46:53] battle and in those battles
[46:55] god gave them 40 years
[46:57] without bondage and oppression
[47:04] verse 29
[47:05] and drew about
[47:07] let's get in the son of joash went and
[47:09] dwelt in his own house
[47:11] now here's where we see look at look at
[47:14] look at gideon's behavior now verse 30.
[47:16] and gideon had three score and ten sons
[47:18] of his body begotten did you get how
[47:20] many sons did you have
[47:22] 70 sons do you think that was just one
[47:23] wife that did that
[47:25] she'd have to have lots of triplets
[47:30] no this means before you had what many
[47:32] wives yeah does that remind you of
[47:34] somebody uh david
[47:37] 500
[47:39] how about solomon
[47:41] see this is before the kings but he was
[47:43] already acting like a king
[47:46] he said i don't want to be a king but he
[47:48] was living like the king
[47:50] i can have as many wives as i want
[47:54] i'm going to take vantage on all my
[47:56] enemies i'm going to kill every one of
[47:57] them
[47:58] yeah
[47:59] i'm going to set up my own e5 i'm going
[48:01] to set up my own worship you know church
[48:03] the bible said it was shiloh you're
[48:05] supposed to worship he set up in his
[48:06] city ophra
[48:08] he set up this ephod so there's
[48:10] something there that he did he caused
[48:11] the people to get their eyes off the
[48:13] priesthood and get it on his city
[48:20] may our worship always be directed
[48:22] towards jesus christ
[48:24] not a preacher
[48:25] not a church
[48:26] not anybody else
[48:28] as great americans as i know in brother
[48:30] brooks's life or sister karen saunders
[48:32] or brother simon has some tremendous
[48:34] miracles the tremendous miracles we've
[48:36] seen here
[48:37] as great as those are none of us deserve
[48:40] any of the credit amen because jesus
[48:42] said without me you can do what not
[48:45] without god getting to do
[48:48] so gideon didn't deliver israel god
[48:51] delivered israel
[48:52] but then gideon started believing it he
[48:54] never corrected them
[48:57] yeah it might have been me
[48:59] it might have been
[49:04] it's a very sobering story isn't it yeah
[49:09] so now he takes now look at verse 31.
[49:11] and it's concubine that was in sheechum
[49:13] she bare him a son whose name he called
[49:16] abimelech
[49:19] now let me look at that name real quick
[49:20] here
[49:23] verse 31.
[49:32] you know what this means
[49:33] father
[49:35] of the king
[49:37] abimelech means
[49:39] father of the king
[49:43] so gideon had many wives and he had a
[49:45] concubine
[49:47] up in sheechum
[49:54] bear him a son he said let's call the
[49:56] son he's the son of the king
[50:00] can you see it he's living like a king
[50:02] although he said the beginning i'm not
[50:04] your king but he's living like one
[50:10] that's like saying i'm not full of pride
[50:12] but they're living in a prideful life
[50:18] i'm not i'm nobody's special but then
[50:19] living like you're the most special
[50:21] person in here i can have as many wives
[50:23] yeah that thought just came back to me
[50:25] remember when they tested for the the
[50:28] 300 remember that what was the test one
[50:30] one one group was sensual they just
[50:32] jumped in the water the other group was
[50:34] more vigilant just watching well the
[50:36] gideon was in the good group well now
[50:39] he's in the central group
[50:40] and the church said
[50:42] the man that cut down the groves is now
[50:45] setting up an ephod and the church said
[50:47] amen
[50:49] but see we can sing that song things i
[50:51] used to do
[50:53] i do them no more
[50:56] things i used to do
[50:59] i do them no more all the things i used
[51:03] to do
[51:04] i do them no more it was a glad day when
[51:09] i was born again
[51:11] hallelujah
[51:14] but gideon could say the things i used
[51:16] to do i do again
[51:19] the things my dad used to do
[51:22] i do it
[51:23] yeah
[51:24] sure there's something about the
[51:25] precious power of the blood of jesus
[51:27] christ there's something about that
[51:29] spirit there's something about that
[51:30] power that will keep you from iniquity
[51:32] amen it'll keep you from going back
[51:36] it'll protect you amen it'll say the
[51:38] hedge about you brother austin amen
[51:40] hallelujah
[51:41] where you won't go back
[51:43] because of god's grace yes amen because
[51:46] we have access to greater promises
[51:50] greater power greater promises amen
[51:55] but austin you'll know i've officially
[51:56] backslid
[51:57] when you see me rushing out of church to
[51:59] go watch the super bowl
[52:01] you'll know i've officially backstage
[52:04] because that's what i used to do when i
[52:05] was a singer
[52:07] but the things i used to do oh i do them
[52:11] no more
[52:14] glory
[52:16] you see me get a
[52:18] cigarette out or a tin out
[52:22] cussing swearing again then you'll know
[52:24] the things that i used to do i'm doing
[52:26] it again
[52:28] but if i don't
[52:30] that means jesus has said a hedge about
[52:31] me praise god
[52:33] and i am more than a conqueror
[52:36] in christ jesus my lord
[52:39] so far it's been going on 20-something
[52:40] years things i used to do
[52:44] i do them no more thank god the things i
[52:48] used to do
[52:50] i do them no more it was a glad day when
[52:54] i was born again let's say praise the
[52:57] lord can we raise them amen that's the
[53:00] difference
[53:01] gideon
[53:03] went back he stopped living his life the
[53:05] name of his
[53:06] name his name was cutting down idols now
[53:09] he started putting them up
[53:10] at least one
[53:12] and all of israel went after that they
[53:14] bowed down and said oh this is where
[53:16] gideon got the victory thank you again
[53:18] for giving us the victory
[53:19] right he didn't stop him
[53:22] it was a snare for him
[53:24] and his family
[53:25] church of you that's what i said lord
[53:27] lord keep me from sinning publicly
[53:30] if i'm in a sin let it just be between
[53:32] me and you lord and maybe a couple other
[53:33] people you know let it be a small group
[53:35] praise god
[53:36] because getting to this public thing and
[53:38] it caused the whole nation
[53:40] to become a to god
[53:44] you imagine they just got delivered from
[53:46] seven years of oppression now
[53:48] history says they started putting up now
[53:52] uh
[53:53] history says we'll get to this history
[53:55] says they basically put up zeus after
[53:56] getting died they put up the statue of
[53:58] zeus which had a different name it was
[54:00] baal something it says it here in the
[54:02] chapter
[54:05] but before that they were secretly
[54:06] worshiping this ephod
[54:09] on gideon's watch
[54:12] but yet god was so gracious he gave him
[54:14] 40 years with no
[54:16] oppression no slavery
[54:18] all because of that those moments those
[54:21] we'd say weeks or months of dedication
[54:23] that gideon had
[54:24] let me know god is very gracious
[54:27] god is so gracious
[54:39] so he calls his
[54:40] son from the concubine abimelech the son
[54:42] of a king
[54:45] his dad wasn't a king but his dad was
[54:48] acting like a king
[54:50] verse 32 and gideon the son of joash
[54:52] died in good old age and was buried in
[54:54] the sepulcher of joash's father in ophra
[54:57] of the abbey israelites
[55:00] and as and it came to pass as soon as
[55:02] his gaze was dead that the children of
[55:03] israel turned again and went ahory after
[55:05] balaam and made baal beareth their god
[55:09] the modern day version of this is zeus
[55:13] and zeus was the father of all the gods
[55:16] he's the one that controls lightning you
[55:17] ever seen a picture of him he's got
[55:18] lightning and got a shirt off and he's
[55:20] just this tough guy
[55:24] well according to the legends he went
[55:26] and had all these adulterous affairs
[55:28] with all these other women gods and now
[55:29] has all these children
[55:32] you know what you know what the marks of
[55:33] his festivals were
[55:36] athletic contests and human sacrifice
[55:41] in other words sports
[55:44] and abortion
[55:46] they have found
[55:48] human skulls and all kinds of remains
[55:51] near altars dedicated to zeus
[55:54] and as soon as gideon died
[55:57] they went out and they set up instead of
[55:59] instead of worshiping god instead of
[56:00] worshiping the real god who delivered
[56:02] them from the midianites they set up
[56:03] idols
[56:06] let me read the baal barath in other
[56:08] words zeus we're going to worship this
[56:09] strong god who controls lightning and
[56:12] we're going to do our sports games and
[56:13] we're going to get up we're going to
[56:15] have abortions and child sacrifice and
[56:17] murders again
[56:19] and they forgot so quickly about the god
[56:21] who delivered them from the midnights
[56:25] and church what does this show us this
[56:27] is how a people lives without joshua
[56:30] this is how people tries to be
[56:31] christians without the baptism of the
[56:33] holy ghost
[56:34] don't you know in churches they let some
[56:35] women have abortions don't you know that
[56:38] they tell it's okay to have abortion
[56:39] bills that's basically abortion
[56:44] birth control for this
[56:46] i didn't read that quote on sunday about
[56:47] mother's day but brother ramsey said
[56:48] birth control
[56:49] is the shame of this nation
[56:53] because he knew it killed babies yeah
[56:55] birth control is the shame and disgrace
[56:57] of america program said yeah
[57:00] that's the real shame
[57:03] and so what am i like oh yeah easter
[57:05] where my wife and i were driving back
[57:06] from church or driving to church
[57:07] remember it's a beautiful day on easter
[57:09] or something
[57:10] i don't know almost been the week after
[57:12] mother's day anyways we saw all these
[57:13] guys on the golf course and we're like
[57:15] it's easter it's it's jesus's
[57:17] resurrection it's mother's day and
[57:19] they're out there golfing with all the
[57:21] guys
[57:22] i'm like what this is the this is the
[57:24] altar of zeus
[57:25] sports
[57:27] i can hit a ball
[57:29] into a little hole
[57:32] and i'm gonna i'm gonna spend four hours
[57:34] doing it and get drunk while i'm doing
[57:36] it
[57:37] and that's gonna be a great time of
[57:38] worship
[57:39] and they're like oh you're such a good
[57:40] golfer it's worship
[57:43] i want to be like tiger woods that'll be
[57:44] like jack nicholas whatever they are
[57:46] it's worship
[57:47] they're they worship at that
[57:51] instead of coming here to worship jesus
[57:52] christ or another church
[57:56] see that so can you see we have a lot of
[57:58] baal berries today
[58:00] athletic worship
[58:03] and human sacrifice worship
[58:05] they're literally fighting for it right
[58:07] they're literally picketing at people's
[58:09] houses for the right to murder
[58:12] right did you see that meme that i don't
[58:14] know if i put that i should think i
[58:15] shared that with austin did i share that
[58:17] meme with you but yeah yeah
[58:20] these people are so they're wicked for
[58:22] the vaccines they said if it saves one
[58:25] life get back vaccinated
[58:28] and now they're like i'll kill you and
[58:30] everyone if i can't murder and take this
[58:32] life
[58:34] i thought the lies were so important
[58:38] see they're just contradicting
[58:39] themselves they're hypocrites
[58:41] amen
[58:43] hypocrites
[58:47] if it just saves one life
[58:49] and yet i thought black lives matter
[58:50] then why are all these black babies
[58:52] getting aborted
[58:53] the fact is all lives matter
[58:56] and if all lives matter why these white
[58:58] babies get aborted
[58:59] see the thing is they love death
[59:02] they love these wicked demon spirits but
[59:04] thank god for the holy spirit that's
[59:06] here today that's rescued us amen that's
[59:09] called us out of darkness and caught us
[59:11] into the kingdom of god's dear son the
[59:13] lord jesus christ amen
[59:15] hallelujah
[59:17] verse 34
[59:19] and the children of israel remember not
[59:20] the lord their god who had delivered
[59:22] them out of the hands of all their
[59:23] enemies
[59:24] on every side they forgot about that
[59:25] victory over 135
[59:28] 000
[59:30] midianites
[59:32] they just forgot it
[59:34] oh our our worship should go to
[59:36] athletics our worship should go to these
[59:38] gods of lightning and thunder and
[59:41] war
[59:42] instead of the god who actually
[59:43] delivered them from it
[59:47] verse 35
[59:48] neither showed they kindness to the
[59:50] house of dru but jupiterville namely
[59:52] gideon according to all the goodness
[59:53] which he had showed
[59:56] unto israel
[1:00:04] kind of a rough sermon tonight
[1:00:07] after all those four sermons in a row
[1:00:09] what faith
[1:00:11] and now we see how this guy turned out
[1:00:15] it's tough it's tough to hear that isn't
[1:00:17] it
[1:00:18] it's tough to see that
[1:00:22] i want to start with starts with
[1:00:24] flattery and pride
[1:00:30] my goodness
[1:00:34] see church
[1:00:35] we've seen this chapter in his violence
[1:00:37] and in his sensuality he's no longer
[1:00:39] serving the lord he's serving himself
[1:00:44] he's not asking god for signs of wisdom
[1:00:47] he's carrying out his own agenda
[1:00:52] see but if he would have been faithful
[1:00:53] he would ask god lord what do you want
[1:00:55] me to do
[1:00:58] what do you want me to do with these
[1:00:59] people that want to make me king what do
[1:01:00] you want me to do instead of just saying
[1:01:02] well let's make an e5
[1:01:04] all right
[1:01:05] in each situation church that's what we
[1:01:07] have to learn to do we have to ask the
[1:01:09] lord what he wants us to do in each
[1:01:10] situation
[1:01:17] this screws church
[1:01:20] anointing for gifts and miracles does
[1:01:22] not prove anybody's going the rapture
[1:01:24] right yeah that's right
[1:01:27] and on top of this we just got to read
[1:01:28] matthew 24 put up matthew 24 24. one of
[1:01:31] the brother rams major revelations in
[1:01:32] fact
[1:01:33] one of the greatest revelations i
[1:01:34] believe brother man ever preached
[1:01:37] outside of the seals you know he calls
[1:01:38] that his regular commission
[1:01:39] there shall rise false anointed ones and
[1:01:42] false prophets and shall show great
[1:01:44] signs wonders in so much if it were
[1:01:45] possible they shall see the very
[1:01:47] very left
[1:01:50] anointing just proves god gave that
[1:01:52] person a gift
[1:01:53] and they actually followed the
[1:01:55] directions that god gave them and so god
[1:01:57] moved that doesn't mean the person is
[1:01:58] stable right that doesn't mean they're
[1:02:00] going to be a faithful christian all
[1:02:02] their days
[1:02:04] that just means for that one moment
[1:02:06] they obeyed god but what about the next
[1:02:08] moment right well what about the next
[1:02:11] week
[1:02:12] what about the next year right
[1:02:14] are they gonna start bending the rules
[1:02:16] so i can be more sensual or i can
[1:02:18] flatter people or i can get a little
[1:02:20] money here i can
[1:02:23] i can live better than other people
[1:02:27] so anointings for gifts and miracles
[1:02:29] doesn't prove right anyone's
[1:02:31] faithfulness
[1:02:32] over the long term it only proves what
[1:02:34] they did in that moment
[1:02:38] so real success
[1:02:40] is having the anointing every day of
[1:02:41] your life
[1:02:43] for every decision of your life and the
[1:02:45] church said amen amen that's real
[1:02:47] anointing church amen the anointing that
[1:02:49] doesn't leave
[1:02:52] amen that's the real anointing amen
[1:02:57] how many miracles did john the baptist
[1:02:58] do
[1:03:02] did he have the anointing oh you better
[1:03:03] believe the other night yeah the spirit
[1:03:05] of elijah
[1:03:06] [Music]
[1:03:08] hallelujah to turn the hearts of the
[1:03:10] fathers to the children amen to prepare
[1:03:13] a people for the lord and jesus said
[1:03:15] there's nothing greater than him outside
[1:03:17] of outside john the baptist he's the
[1:03:18] greatest ever born amen
[1:03:21] yet he's at least in the kingdom of
[1:03:22] heaven
[1:03:23] hallelujah isn't that beautiful
[1:03:26] not
[1:03:28] the wrath said the anointing just proves
[1:03:29] god was there not that he approves a
[1:03:31] person's lifestyle and the greatest
[1:03:33] example is bailey
[1:03:35] that guy had the anointing visions
[1:03:37] dreams all these prophecies right right
[1:03:39] right right but then he taught you it's
[1:03:41] okay to commit fornication
[1:03:44] and if i can't curse them maybe i can
[1:03:46] get them to fall that was worthy of hell
[1:03:49] for that
[1:03:51] he went to hell for that
[1:03:53] remember remember a few weeks ago other
[1:03:55] times he would go seek out necromancers
[1:03:58] and devil worshipers
[1:03:59] so sometimes he'd pray and seek god
[1:04:01] other times you get out the candles and
[1:04:03] make the upside down cross and you know
[1:04:04] they need to
[1:04:06] start calling on demons
[1:04:12] close
[1:04:13] let's finally close this sermon
[1:04:17] hebrews 11 32 can we close this thing
[1:04:19] already brother justice get real intense
[1:04:21] in here
[1:04:23] here's 11 32.
[1:04:26] and what shall i more say
[1:04:28] for the time with family to tell of
[1:04:30] gideon
[1:04:32] and a bear
[1:04:33] and of samson
[1:04:35] and of jephthah remember jeff knows one
[1:04:37] that said
[1:04:38] if god if you give me this victory
[1:04:39] whatever i see first i'm going to
[1:04:41] sacrifice
[1:04:42] his daughter
[1:04:44] some people think he did some people
[1:04:45] think she was just a virgin her whole
[1:04:46] life
[1:04:47] she just sacrificed her willingness or
[1:04:49] her ability to marry and have children i
[1:04:51] don't know
[1:04:52] but the fact remains
[1:04:54] made a very foolish
[1:04:56] vow to god yeah
[1:05:00] and of david also and samuel the
[1:05:01] prophets who through face of new
[1:05:03] kingdoms so how to get into through
[1:05:05] faith he subdued kingdoms
[1:05:09] wrought righteousness obtain promises
[1:05:11] stop the mouth of lions let's stand to
[1:05:13] our feet musician can come
[1:05:14] thanks lydia for taking the kill fever
[1:05:16] tonight
[1:05:17] thank you
[1:05:19] thank you god bless just give a round of
[1:05:20] applause
[1:05:23] [Applause]
[1:05:26] how many love the word of god amen
[1:05:31] it's phenomenal it is absolutely
[1:05:34] shocking
[1:05:36] to see how quickly somebody can go from
[1:05:38] anointed supernatural to sensual
[1:05:41] prideful
[1:05:42] off the word
[1:05:47] church what did brother ann tell us
[1:05:51] probably told us when you were under the
[1:05:52] blood of the sacrifice
[1:05:57] and you obeyed your covenant brother
[1:05:59] branham said
[1:06:00] like abraham
[1:06:02] god forgave you and then god would write
[1:06:04] about you and say abraham staggered not
[1:06:07] at the promise of god
[1:06:09] through unbelief and the church said
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:13] said that was for every believer right
[1:06:16] ever so sometime in gideon's life he
[1:06:18] must at the end
[1:06:19] after having all those 70 boys how many
[1:06:21] girls have you had
[1:06:23] this guy was
[1:06:25] sensual
[1:06:27] sometime at the end
[1:06:29] he said lord you forgive me
[1:06:31] i have done wrong
[1:06:32] i have brought this upon the nation i
[1:06:35] brought this shame upon my family
[1:06:38] because look he's in the hall of fame of
[1:06:39] faith
[1:06:40] how could he be there if he was a
[1:06:41] murderer
[1:06:43] the only way he could be there with all
[1:06:44] that murder was to be forgiven
[1:06:47] just like moses was a murderer right
[1:06:51] just like david murdered uriah
[1:06:53] hallelujah
[1:06:55] how could they be there but austin how
[1:06:56] could that man be in the hall of fame of
[1:06:58] faith because of blood
[1:07:02] because we have an atonement through the
[1:07:04] blood
[1:07:07] but churches don't ever think you're too
[1:07:08] far that god can't forgive you amen
[1:07:11] don't ever know don't ever let the devil
[1:07:12] tell you that
[1:07:14] god will look at you and you if you say
[1:07:15] sorry god look and say
[1:07:17] jesse never staggered the promise of god
[1:07:19] i'll say hallelujah
[1:07:21] i remember sometimes i did but the blood
[1:07:23] doesn't let god remember amen
[1:07:26] hallelujah i said abraham's staggered
[1:07:28] nut
[1:07:30] well yet we can see where he staggered
[1:07:32] there staggered there sticking there
[1:07:35] but that's the beauty of forgiveness
[1:07:39] that's the beauty of
[1:07:40] grace god doesn't see my mistakes when i
[1:07:43] confess and say lord you forgive me a
[1:07:45] church in our day
[1:07:47] we don't murder people with our swords
[1:07:48] and guns but sometimes we murder them
[1:07:50] with our words yeah right amen
[1:07:52] said that
[1:07:55] sometimes we don't commit physical
[1:07:56] adultery or physical fornication but we
[1:07:58] can commit it right up here yeah
[1:08:00] jesus said it's the same thing
[1:08:03] so how many need god's grace in their
[1:08:05] life amen
[1:08:06] anger
[1:08:08] lustful things
[1:08:09] we all need a church
[1:08:11] every single person here tonight
[1:08:14] needs god's grace and guess what just
[1:08:15] like you did you can one day
[1:08:17] be in the hall of fame of faith as well
[1:08:20] and praise god
[1:08:21] as far as
[1:08:27] heavenly father we just want to worship
[1:08:28] you for a few moments lord with this
[1:08:30] sobering message dear god
[1:08:33] as i listened this week and read i just
[1:08:34] couldn't hardly believe what i was
[1:08:36] reading how can this man i so revere
[1:08:43] i was gaining so much strength and then
[1:08:45] lord to see this i was saddened
[1:08:49] but lord i'm also reminded he lived
[1:08:50] under a different covenant he lived in a
[1:08:53] different time
[1:08:54] so lord we don't look down on him
[1:08:58] we appreciate the faith that he received
[1:09:01] to subdue kingdoms
[1:09:04] and fathers you told us through your son
[1:09:06] jesus you said remember lot's wife
[1:09:09] you told us to remember examples when
[1:09:11] people fell
[1:09:14] so we're looking back here today to
[1:09:16] remember lord help us not to flatter
[1:09:18] people
[1:09:19] help us not to be prideful
[1:09:22] help us not to take credit for your
[1:09:23] victories
[1:09:26] help us to just say like brother branham
[1:09:28] i was just there when he did it
[1:09:31] amen
[1:09:32] thank you jesus
[1:09:35] we're just there when you do something
[1:09:38] and we stand in all what you did
[1:09:42] lord may we not
[1:09:44] build again the things that we've
[1:09:45] destroyed may we not develop bad habits
