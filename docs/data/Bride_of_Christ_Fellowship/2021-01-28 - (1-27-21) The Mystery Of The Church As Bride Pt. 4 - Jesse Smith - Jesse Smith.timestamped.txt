[38:29] you've had a lot of battles with your
[38:30] family you know spiritual and i'm glad
[38:32] they go to church but
[38:33] brother jose really needs us as his
[38:34] family and so we're glad to do that
[38:37] we're so thankful brother that god
[38:39] brought us together all those miles you
[38:40] had to cross
[38:41] coming up from nicaragua just to get to
[38:43] akron all the miles
[38:44] sister naomi had to fly to get to akron
[38:48] praise god and
[38:49] so god is rich in mercy we're thankful
[38:54] that's right the smallest international
[38:57] church of all time
[39:00] so we are so thankful and i wouldn't
[39:02] have it any other way as we heard on
[39:03] sunday we need to be content and
[39:06] the holy spirit gives us power to be
[39:07] content no matter what state we're in
[39:10] and it's just receiving more of his
[39:11] strength all the time so
[39:13] god wish to bless you brother we'll keep
[39:14] praying for you and uh that if
[39:16] satan tries to bring back any boxer
[39:18] rattlesnakes we'll refuse it
[39:20] in the name of the lord great beautiful
[39:22] testimony thank god for that
[39:25] praise god so i'd like to uh just take
[39:28] about half hour here let me set a timer
[39:29] here this may be my shortest sermon ever
[39:32] unless lydia maokai can remember when i
[39:33] went shorter
[39:35] ever go short in 30 minutes okay
[39:38] and there's a reason to you know you
[39:40] know i don't know if you remember but
[39:41] usually in january february
[39:42] i cancel the evening services i've done
[39:45] that the last five or six years
[39:47] you know i'll say we'll take a little
[39:48] break right uh but i didn't this
[39:51] year and that's because we got the
[39:52] bland's driving um
[39:54] and i didn't know if karen and brenda
[39:55] would come on sunday nights that would
[39:56] be their only service they could come
[39:58] so i would never want to cancel
[40:01] someone's only service to be in the
[40:03] house of the lord so
[40:05] i haven't talked to karen or brenda yet
[40:06] so if they're streaming god bless them
[40:08] i can just remember to text them again i
[40:10] did a few weeks ago
[40:12] but i haven't done that and so i just
[40:15] want to be mindful too of my health and
[40:17] everything
[40:19] every winter i get sick because i don't
[40:20] sleep enough or i don't eat right or
[40:22] i push myself too hard or you know
[40:26] so if i can get a little bit extra sleep
[40:28] on wednesday nights i think i'll be
[40:29] healthier by god's grace
[40:31] in fact i know i will be so uh
[40:34] thank you for your patience let's just
[40:36] take about a half hour we'll try to get
[40:37] into this
[40:38] series now just so you know i am
[40:39] studying more on other series i just
[40:41] feel like i want to finish this one here
[40:43] um i've been studying on joshua i want
[40:46] to preach a whole sermon on the
[40:48] whole message on the the book of joshua
[40:49] i've been hearing all these thoughts
[40:51] i've been really enjoying
[40:52] them some from brother branham some from
[40:54] other ones i've heard online
[40:55] really good thoughts about joshua and
[40:58] just possessing the promises so i want
[40:59] to get to that series i still want to
[41:01] preach a series on the life of jesus i
[41:02] want to get to that
[41:03] i want to finish philippians one day i
[41:05] want to finish i could just get through
[41:07] that series
[41:08] but you know i had numerous testimonies
[41:10] from sunday morning service so people
[41:12] learned things they were humbled and
[41:13] people emailing me about what a great
[41:15] service that was so
[41:16] i thank the lord for that just god's
[41:18] grace we just have to stay in the
[41:20] channel of god right we have to present
[41:22] our bodies a living sacrifice
[41:24] and if we present ourselves as a
[41:25] sacrifice and it's acceptable unto god
[41:27] god will use us and so we just want to
[41:29] do that we just want to be
[41:31] led by the holy spirit uh and i just
[41:33] released the youtube video this morning
[41:35] about the 10 books
[41:36] uh the 10 best books to me i put it out
[41:39] at 6 a.m this morning and so
[41:41] if you i mentioned them briefly on
[41:42] sunday morning if you want to watch that
[41:44] you can see that
[41:45] um so that was just put out this morning
[41:48] and hopefully that will be a help to
[41:49] people
[41:50] i got one mistake in it just so you know
[41:52] over the jose there's one mistake guys i
[41:53] talk about jesus as the unleavened bread
[41:56] and i've made a mistake i kind of feel
[41:58] like i can relate to brother brandon how
[41:59] he'll make a mistake on tape
[42:01] i said the unleavened bread represents
[42:03] jesus's
[42:04] sinful life so just so you know i made
[42:07] that's an awful mistake but i
[42:09] my note said sinless life but i said
[42:12] sinful life so i'll probably go back and
[42:14] fix that but then i got to re-upload it
[42:16] so i don't know
[42:17] you know brother graham's mistakes on
[42:18] tape they just live on forever right you
[42:20] know so i don't know if i'll do it or
[42:21] not but
[42:22] i did make a awful mistake there and i
[42:23] was just reading it i just said the
[42:25] wrong word
[42:26] i know jesus lived a sinless life i know
[42:28] that
[42:29] he became sinful for me he took my sin
[42:31] upon him
[42:32] but i just made one mistake and i
[42:34] appreciate the brother who caught that a
[42:35] brother
[42:36] emailed me this morning caught it right
[42:37] away uh so i did say sorry but i'm not
[42:40] sure if i'll
[42:41] you know like brother brown will say on
[42:43] tape that he said rebecca went to marry
[42:45] her wife she married a woman
[42:48] according to that quote well it's a slip
[42:50] of the tongue you know same thing
[42:53] uh for me so you know if you watch that
[42:55] just be
[42:56] aware of that it's around the 18-minute
[42:58] mark he pointed out today so
[43:00] so let's look to the word of god here
[43:02] now ephesians 5 uh
[43:03] 32 we read that for our text here
[43:08] i just want to lay down in uh these
[43:10] thoughts here there's five attributes
[43:12] of the of the bride paulus
[43:15] for you and i now we should be really
[43:17] familiar with these
[43:18] attributes right because we we just
[43:21] don't call ourselves a church now
[43:22] we call ourselves the bride of christ
[43:25] and so if we call ourselves that we must
[43:28] live a higher calling
[43:30] or else we're just hypocrites right if
[43:32] we call ourselves a bride but we don't
[43:33] live like a bride should live
[43:35] then we're just hypocrites right we're
[43:37] sinners but we don't want to be
[43:38] hypocrites
[43:39] we want to be sincere christians praise
[43:41] god we want to be
[43:43] pure holy before the lord we want to be
[43:46] jesus's bride now we looked at verse
[43:49] uh i believe it was 20 i can look it
[43:53] real quick here
[43:55] we looked at verse uh 23 yes
[43:59] and we saw our first attribute was that
[44:01] christ must be the head of the bride
[44:04] we saw last week there i just listed 10
[44:06] quick uh
[44:08] doctrines that prove most churches do
[44:11] not make
[44:11] christ the head homosexuality
[44:14] they adulterers fornicators murdering
[44:18] babies right
[44:19] women preachers substance abuse
[44:22] uh evil things presented before your
[44:25] eyes movies
[44:26] shameful hair lengths uh false
[44:28] conversions
[44:29] and in modest clothing that's just ten
[44:31] of paul's
[44:33] doctrines how many more could there be
[44:34] that people break throughout the
[44:35] scripture
[44:37] so that they're not the head christ is
[44:39] not the head of those churches
[44:41] so if we're sincere we honestly keep
[44:43] those we have a good chance to be the
[44:45] bride amen
[44:46] a lot better chance than denominations
[44:49] now if we're born again then we already
[44:50] are bride by god's grace
[44:52] but i just want to leave that out there
[44:53] brother ram never said well uh without a
[44:55] doubt i'm the bride he said
[44:57] i'm trusting my names on the lamb's book
[44:59] of life right remember that quote from
[45:00] the the seals
[45:02] the questions answers on the seals they
[45:04] said brother branham can you prove
[45:05] you're there
[45:06] no he said i can't prove my name's there
[45:08] he said god could use me as a tool for
[45:10] something else
[45:11] he said but i'm believing my name is
[45:13] there i'm living like my name is there
[45:15] praise god
[45:17] now the second attribute is in verse 24.
[45:20] let's read that ephesians 5 24
[45:22] i won't have readers because i only got
[45:24] 25 minutes left so
[45:26] therefore as the church is subject in
[45:27] the christ so let the wise be to their
[45:29] own husbands
[45:30] in everything now this is scripture
[45:32] gotta bounce out not in sinful things
[45:35] right a woman doesn't submit this sin so
[45:38] that means in everything that's holy and
[45:40] good
[45:41] praise god so she's subject in
[45:44] everything
[45:44] so bride members uh are happy
[45:48] and they're supposed to obey every word
[45:50] of god
[45:51] just like jesus said i don't live by
[45:53] bread alone but by
[45:54] every word that proceeds out of the
[45:56] mouth of god or the mouth of god rather
[45:58] now obeying god is not should not be a
[46:00] hard thing right but it is sometimes to
[46:02] our flesh and our mind
[46:04] not to our soul but it can be a hard
[46:06] thing
[46:07] uh if we are for not living from the
[46:09] born-again experience
[46:11] so first john 5 verses 3 and 4
[46:14] for this is the love of god that we keep
[46:16] his commandments
[46:17] and his commandments are not grievous
[46:20] for what sober is born of god
[46:22] overcomes the world amen and this is the
[46:25] victory that overcometh the world
[46:27] even our faith praise god amen so see
[46:30] church
[46:30] paul's talk i'm sorry john's talking
[46:32] about this he said faith overcomes
[46:35] faith is our victory is faith but it
[46:36] means faith that continues to grow
[46:38] praise god right
[46:39] he just said if you're born again it's
[46:41] not a hard thing to obey
[46:43] and then he says faith overcomes the
[46:45] world right so faith will overcome the
[46:47] world to be saved
[46:48] but then you grow in faith right from
[46:50] faith to faith right from glory to glory
[46:52] right
[46:52] you keep growing in the things of god so
[46:55] you're born again
[46:56] and then it's not grievous it's not a a
[46:58] difficult thing to obey
[47:00] you love to obey right that's the word
[47:03] of god
[47:04] and that's why many churches have a hard
[47:06] time they talk
[47:07] they just they just take the the
[47:09] commands out of their creeds and bylaws
[47:11] because it's grievous to them
[47:13] they don't want to obey but the bride
[47:15] loves to obey it praise god
[47:17] because that's her victory amen that's
[47:19] her victory even her faith in god's word
[47:22] and obedience to the word of god that's
[47:24] her victory what other churches can
[47:25] experience
[47:27] her goal is total submission to christ
[47:30] in everything she wants to be holy
[47:32] because jesus is holy peter tells us
[47:35] this
[47:36] first peter 1 14 peter says
[47:41] as obedient children not fashioning
[47:43] yourselves according to the former lust
[47:45] in your ignorance but as he which hath
[47:48] called you is holy
[47:49] so be holy i'm sorry so be ye holy
[47:53] in all matter of conversation because it
[47:56] is written
[47:56] be holy for i am holy now where's all
[47:59] those people that say we're not
[48:00] there's we don't need the old testament
[48:02] anymore peter's quoting deuteronomy
[48:05] praise god
[48:06] where god says be holy because i'm holy
[48:09] so again we see this idea of the moral
[48:11] law right or the
[48:12] the righteous laws of the old testament
[48:14] being carried over to the new praise god
[48:17] and this isn't a man we're wondering is
[48:19] he born again or not
[48:20] peter was there he had the keys to the
[48:22] kingdom he opened up the door to them to
[48:24] get the holy ghost for the jews for the
[48:26] gentiles for the samaritans this is a
[48:28] man
[48:28] he knew something about being born again
[48:30] praise god
[48:31] and so he's polling old testament
[48:33] scriptures saying this is a righteous
[48:35] this is a moral thing
[48:37] you should be holy because christ is
[48:39] holy
[48:40] so the bride feels the same way
[48:44] all right now i'm going to move a little
[48:46] quicker that's the second attribute is
[48:47] submission
[48:48] in everything so until uh we obey
[48:53] everything we still need to come to
[48:54] church and
[48:55] hear what the lord says out of his word
[48:56] right because we're still learning to
[48:57] obey praise god
[48:59] right because it's everything everything
[49:01] now the third attribute is in verse 26
[49:04] it says that he might sanctify and
[49:07] cleanse it
[49:08] with the washing of the water by the
[49:11] word
[49:12] so the third thing the third attribute
[49:14] says she allows herself
[49:16] to be washed she lets christ wash her
[49:21] right and the bible says in first peter
[49:23] 1 22 you're purified in obeying the
[49:26] truth
[49:27] through the spirit praise god so
[49:29] obedience to the word
[49:32] is what washes you so when you obey the
[49:34] word
[49:35] you and i should feel a washing at least
[49:37] over our souls
[49:39] i had a sister in the message one time
[49:40] tell me she don't go to this church uh
[49:43] lives many miles away she said i don't
[49:45] feel washed when i obey and i said well
[49:47] you ought to in your soul right you know
[49:50] because she said she battled with
[49:51] cutting her hair
[49:52] and you know she said she don't feel
[49:54] pretty and and battles that
[49:56] doesn't feel clean well i said well i
[49:58] don't know about your mind battles but i
[50:00] said the bible says
[50:02] if you obey you feel pure in your soul
[50:05] praise god
[50:06] see the trouble is people are too busy
[50:08] listening uh to this out here right
[50:10] and paying attention to what this says
[50:12] and what's in here they got to get alone
[50:14] with god
[50:15] so they can see what their soul is
[50:17] feeling praise god
[50:19] they can feel what the soul is telling
[50:21] them praise god with the holy spirit
[50:23] inside their soul the nature of the holy
[50:25] spirit inside
[50:26] they can listen to that nature they can
[50:28] feel that nature praise god
[50:30] because when you really get down and get
[50:31] quiet when you really are still and know
[50:34] that he's god
[50:35] you feel the holiness of god you feel it
[50:38] inside of you
[50:40] so i can't i i never was a woman's i
[50:43] can't relate to
[50:44] maybe what they go through but i know
[50:45] the bible says if you
[50:47] obey you are pure in your soul praise
[50:50] god
[50:52] that's scripture can you hold this up
[50:55] here acacia acts 22
[50:57] 16. the bible says when you repent
[51:00] you ought to feel your sins being washed
[51:04] away praise god
[51:06] and now why tarist thou arise be
[51:08] baptized wash away thy sins
[51:10] calling upon the name of the lord this
[51:13] is speaking of the apostle paul amen
[51:16] right he was guilty of holding the coats
[51:18] and he dragged christians to prison
[51:20] but ananias says he said wash away your
[51:23] sins
[51:24] we should feel the cleansing washing of
[51:26] forgiveness praise god
[51:27] amen when we come up to the get prayed
[51:29] for or we confess our sins or
[51:31] when we cry and say god forgive me we
[51:33] should feel the washing waters
[51:35] how many like the warm washing waters of
[51:37] the holy spirit praise god
[51:39] saying you feel god forgiving you and
[51:42] you have confidence i'm not going to do
[51:43] that again
[51:44] i'm going to overcome i won't let satan
[51:47] tempt me like that i won't let him uh
[51:50] get me
[51:50] i'll have zeal and i'll overcome next
[51:53] time i'll be more than a conqueror
[51:55] praise god
[51:56] amen amen hallelujah
[51:59] see it's the washing power of repentance
[52:02] by obeying the word now
[52:06] church also connected this if you got
[52:07] your bible go to revelation 1 5.
[52:10] go to revelation 1 5 and revelation 7
[52:12] 14.
[52:14] the bride will submit to the washing of
[52:17] waters
[52:18] by the word and many times church this
[52:21] is
[52:21] overcoming sin in the midst of
[52:24] persecution and temptation
[52:28] i just read it this morning i was
[52:29] reading my bible
[52:31] in the prayer closet and it said you
[52:32] ought to rejoice
[52:34] when someone says something evil about
[52:36] you and i started to smile and said
[52:38] praise god
[52:39] i got different people say evil things
[52:40] you know they email me things like that
[52:43] i said praise god i ought to rejoice
[52:45] this is the washing process praise god
[52:47] because
[52:48] look what the bible says from jesus
[52:50] christ who's the faithful witness the
[52:51] first begotten of the dead
[52:52] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[52:54] unto him that loved us
[52:55] and washed us from our sins in his own
[52:59] blood
[53:00] so when we see our former sins leaving
[53:02] us
[53:03] when we see our lives as more holy
[53:06] we ought to thank god and say jesus is
[53:08] washing me with his word amen
[53:12] revelation 7 14 oh it's beautiful
[53:15] revelation 7 14
[53:16] and i said to him sir thou knowest he
[53:18] said these are they
[53:19] which came out of great tribulation and
[53:21] have washed their robes
[53:23] and made them white in the blood of the
[53:25] lamb
[53:27] amen see when you go through trials when
[53:29] you go through persecutions
[53:32] and you you call upon jesus give me your
[53:34] strength
[53:35] give me your strength to forgive give me
[53:37] your strength to love i can do all
[53:39] things through your strength lord
[53:41] when you do that and you repent of
[53:42] wrongs and you do the right thing
[53:44] it's like jesus washing you from the
[53:47] dirt right
[53:48] it's like jesus washing you uh from a
[53:50] hard day or the sweat
[53:51] or whatever it may be or you know just
[53:54] the blood or the stains
[53:56] just washing it all away he said you
[53:58] overcome
[53:59] this way by letting jesus wash you
[54:01] getting through the trials
[54:03] getting through the persecutions
[54:05] overcoming sin and doubt and unbelief
[54:07] that's jesus washing you
[54:11] that's beautiful that's the bride that
[54:13] came through great tribulation
[54:16] how did you get there she washed her
[54:18] robes white in the blood of the lamb
[54:22] hallelujah
[54:25] church we know what first corinthians 1
[54:26] 18 says pull it up there acacia
[54:34] where is the power in the bride
[54:38] how does the power of god get to the
[54:40] bride it is through
[54:42] the preaching of the cross amen
[54:46] ah we ought to we don't appreciate that
[54:48] when when when anyone's preaching on the
[54:50] power of the cross
[54:52] that jesus died to wash you that's the
[54:55] power of god amen
[54:57] we want to see it always or maybe we
[54:59] sometimes you want to see it just in
[55:00] miracles and signs and wonders we thank
[55:02] god for healings
[55:03] but the powers in the cross right the
[55:06] shed blood
[55:07] how jesus conquered every sin amen
[55:10] he conquered it and sometimes we forget
[55:12] that that's where the power lays
[55:14] amen the power lays in the preaching of
[55:17] the cross
[55:18] jesus condemned all those spirits jesus
[55:20] conquered every spirit
[55:22] because they have no right to be there
[55:24] because jesus paid for them to be cast
[55:26] out praise god amen
[55:29] he paid the price for all every sin that
[55:31] could ever be committed he paid the
[55:33] price
[55:33] he took the punishment of every sin that
[55:35] we deserve
[55:36] and the power is in the cross amen
[55:40] hallelujah thank god that's where the
[55:43] power ladies church
[55:45] when we accept the preaching of god's
[55:47] word the forgiveness of the holy spirit
[55:50] that's where the power is amen to the
[55:52] world it's foolishness
[55:53] but to us it gives us strength amen
[55:57] strength to go another week how many got
[55:59] strength to go another week can you go a
[56:00] couple more days let's see wednesday
[56:02] thursday friday saturday can you go four
[56:03] more days i should know that
[56:05] there's four days till sunday
[56:08] yes because you get power from the
[56:11] preaching
[56:11] because the preaching points you to the
[56:13] cross and that's where
[56:15] uh the the sin debt was paid that's
[56:18] where your healing was purchased
[56:19] that's where your forgiveness was
[56:21] purchased reminding you of the power
[56:23] of the cross of christ that's where you
[56:26] got washed amen oh that's where the
[56:27] blood flowed down like a fountain amen
[56:31] hallelujah the bible said that's where
[56:33] the saints get washed
[56:35] in the blood hallelujah thank god
[56:38] so the reason churches don't get washed
[56:40] is because they don't preach
[56:42] they don't preach all the word right
[56:45] they don't preach
[56:45] all of the cross they don't preach all
[56:48] of god's teachings
[56:50] and i just listed 10 of them above right
[56:55] now remember your mind must be renewed
[56:58] or washed
[56:59] the bible says uh let me read that uh
[57:03] i'm going to go to ephesians 4 22.
[57:07] well you know i don't have time to read
[57:08] that i'm let's go to titus 3 5. let's go
[57:10] to titus 3
[57:11] 5. that's a big long text here i'll have
[57:14] to preach at another time
[57:16] titus 3-5
[57:23] titus 3-5 now verse three talks about
[57:27] how he used to be ob
[57:28] or disobedient and foolish hateful
[57:30] wicked verse four
[57:31] but after that the kindness and love of
[57:34] god our savior
[57:35] toward man appeared not by works of
[57:38] righteousness which we
[57:40] have done but according to his mercy he
[57:43] saved us
[57:44] by the washing of regeneration
[57:48] and renewing of the holy ghost isn't
[57:51] that beautiful praise god
[57:53] how did god save you he washed you and
[57:56] gave you a regeneration
[57:58] right a transformation
[58:01] that's what the the scripture says
[58:04] that's what happens
[58:05] not by our works but he washed us praise
[58:08] god
[58:08] we didn't wash ourselves praise god we
[58:11] couldn't wash away like the bible said
[58:12] can a leper get rid of its spots
[58:14] we couldn't wash it away in our own
[58:16] ability a special kind of
[58:18] soap had to come a special kind of
[58:20] bleach had to come right
[58:22] to wash away our spots the bible said it
[58:25] wasn't by our works
[58:26] but by mercy merciful washing of christ
[58:30] renewed by the holy ghost so church when
[58:32] you know that your mind may be backslid
[58:35] for a while but your mind is now renewed
[58:37] and your mind's on the right things you
[58:39] know you've been washed
[58:42] hallelujah thank god amen thank the lord
[58:46] so jesus constantly washes his bride the
[58:49] bible says so
[58:52] that's the third attribute she will
[58:56] make christ the head she'll submit to
[58:58] everything and shall
[58:59] also be washed by the waters of the word
[59:06] glory now
[59:09] the fourth one is in ephesians 5 31 so
[59:12] i'm going to go back there
[59:13] ephesians 5 31.
[59:25] ephesians 5 31 for this call shall a man
[59:28] leave his father and his mother and
[59:29] shall be
[59:30] joined unto his wife and they too shall
[59:32] be one flesh paul again
[59:34] quoting what genesis the old testament
[59:36] right
[59:37] giving it authority in the new
[59:40] now that word join if you look it up
[59:42] means glued it literally means
[59:44] glue right the wife is supposed to be
[59:48] glued to the husband
[59:51] okay and so we see that christians how
[59:53] are we glued to christ
[59:54] well through our our spirit we're
[59:56] supposed to meditate
[59:58] on the things of god we're supposed to
[1:00:00] pray
[1:00:01] without ceasing amen we're supposed to
[1:00:03] stay in that
[1:00:04] constant connection we're supposed to be
[1:00:07] in constant contact
[1:00:08] with the lord now of course you know we
[1:00:12] physically gather together like glue
[1:00:14] as well like jose said we're his family
[1:00:15] amen he's our family
[1:00:18] because the bible said in hebrews 10 24
[1:00:20] let us consider one another
[1:00:23] to provoke unto love and the good work
[1:00:25] so one of the major
[1:00:27] points of coming to church is to think
[1:00:29] about other people how we can provoke
[1:00:31] them
[1:00:31] how we can help them how we can inspire
[1:00:34] them how we can stir them up praise god
[1:00:37] amen not forsaking the assemblies of
[1:00:40] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:00:42] is not letting the glue be broken right
[1:00:44] not letting the bonds be dissolved right
[1:00:48] but gathering more as we see that day
[1:00:50] approaching
[1:00:51] you can't separate the bride from her
[1:00:52] husband nor can separate the bride from
[1:00:54] the bride amen
[1:00:56] right the sad part is most people are
[1:00:59] glued to their phones
[1:01:00] right or glued to the latest sports game
[1:01:03] now that's back on
[1:01:04] it's back in season right they're more
[1:01:06] glued to that
[1:01:07] than they are glued to the church and
[1:01:10] christ
[1:01:11] oh but thank god church we can fulfill
[1:01:13] the scripture just as eve
[1:01:15] uh and adam were joined together as they
[1:01:17] became one
[1:01:18] so christ and the church will be one as
[1:01:20] well amen
[1:01:22] and the last one i'm down to a few
[1:01:24] minutes here
[1:01:26] the fifth attribute is reverence i i
[1:01:28] ended the sermon last wednesday by
[1:01:30] mentioning this
[1:01:31] go to ephesians 5 33.
[1:01:35] so all these attributes did you catch
[1:01:36] that man i never caught that until i
[1:01:37] started reading this
[1:01:39] five attributes of the bride we gotta
[1:01:41] have all of them if we're gonna be the
[1:01:42] bride
[1:01:43] we must obey in everything we must be
[1:01:45] washed christ must be our head
[1:01:48] and we must be glued and joined one to
[1:01:50] another praise god
[1:01:51] and lastly we need an attitude
[1:01:54] of reverence ephesians 5 33
[1:01:58] nevertheless that every one of you in
[1:01:59] particular so love his wife even as
[1:02:01] himself
[1:02:02] and see that she reverence her husband
[1:02:04] see that she do it
[1:02:05] that he do it right i'm sorry that she
[1:02:07] do it make sure she does that
[1:02:09] she really needs to reference her
[1:02:10] husband and husbands you really need to
[1:02:13] love your wives amen
[1:02:16] right and the bible says oh yeah that's
[1:02:17] right it's the same for the husband
[1:02:19] because the bible said he ought to give
[1:02:21] honor to the weaker vessel
[1:02:24] so it ain't just a woman who's you know
[1:02:26] real meek and quiet all the time and
[1:02:28] just reverence her husband
[1:02:30] but the man gives honor and thinks
[1:02:32] highly of his wife and
[1:02:34] wants to help her out the best he can
[1:02:36] right
[1:02:37] now you know reverence i read it last
[1:02:39] week in the greek means to
[1:02:41] be in awe of or to think awesome of
[1:02:47] so just speaking the name of jesus ought
[1:02:50] to be a sacred or
[1:02:52] hallowed thing to the bride church we
[1:02:54] got to make sure we don't make it a joke
[1:02:56] at times right
[1:02:57] we got to make sure we don't let it
[1:02:58] become too easy for us to say it or
[1:03:00] or are too common for us to say it
[1:03:02] that's why it's good that we're in
[1:03:04] church tonight praise god amen
[1:03:05] yeah because we we need reminders we
[1:03:07] need constant reminders
[1:03:09] to reverence the lord amen
[1:03:13] like if i could get to it i want to get
[1:03:14] to this thought tonight i don't know if
[1:03:15] i'll get to it
[1:03:16] oh yeah maybe i can get to it
[1:03:20] we have so many false prophets now in
[1:03:22] the charismatic movement
[1:03:23] that they don't reverence god that they
[1:03:26] don't even
[1:03:26] they they make millions of dollars they
[1:03:28] have millions of views on youtube
[1:03:30] they make all these false prophecies
[1:03:31] this is how much they only have that
[1:03:33] much reverence for god
[1:03:34] because they just constantly falsely
[1:03:36] prophesy in his name
[1:03:38] they use his name anyway to say whatever
[1:03:41] they want all kinds of
[1:03:42] false lies and false prophecies but you
[1:03:44] and i if we're the bride
[1:03:46] we won't do that we won't speak his name
[1:03:48] unless it's in reverence
[1:03:50] because the bible said let her have him
[1:03:54] in reverence see that she reverence
[1:03:57] christ jesus the lord he's not somebody
[1:04:01] you play around or boss around or tell
[1:04:03] what to do
[1:04:03] that's why if you don't answer our
[1:04:04] prayers we can raise our hands to heaven
[1:04:06] and say
[1:04:07] i still believe you lord i still
[1:04:08] reverence you praise god
[1:04:10] although my guy didn't get in the guy i
[1:04:12] voted for trump and pence right
[1:04:13] before even though my prayers weren't
[1:04:15] answered i never prayed more i ever did
[1:04:17] that don't affect me at all i'm still oh
[1:04:19] i know god will use this person to bring
[1:04:21] him back
[1:04:22] but whatever he's doing it's his plan
[1:04:24] it's not my plan
[1:04:25] i'm not trying to find my plan for my
[1:04:27] life i'm trying to find his plan for my
[1:04:29] life praise god
[1:04:31] he's got the plan for the world not me
[1:04:33] i'm supposed to submit to his plan
[1:04:35] and trust in his plan
[1:04:39] i'm not the boss of this thing it's i it
[1:04:42] never was supposed to be
[1:04:43] uh lord my will not thine be done that
[1:04:46] never was supposed to be that
[1:04:47] it's supposed to be let thy will be done
[1:04:50] not my will
[1:04:52] that's just one simple example
[1:04:57] the husband is great in the woman's eyes
[1:05:00] and it causes her to be meek and humble
[1:05:03] she's careful what comes out of her
[1:05:04] mouth
[1:05:05] she has quiet strength right
[1:05:09] and she has the treasure of a meek and
[1:05:11] quiet spirit a humble spirit
[1:05:13] now the woman the natural should have
[1:05:15] that and that should be a type
[1:05:17] of the church the church should be meek
[1:05:19] towards the lord
[1:05:21] right the church should be humble before
[1:05:23] god
[1:05:25] let's read that first peter 3 verse 4.
[1:05:28] now this is what our sisters should
[1:05:30] strive for our brothers should
[1:05:31] spiritually strive for this
[1:05:34] and then like i said honor for their
[1:05:36] wives honor if you honor somebody you
[1:05:38] don't disrespect them
[1:05:40] right you show them respect you think
[1:05:43] highly of them
[1:05:48] sisters let it be the hidden man of the
[1:05:50] heart
[1:05:52] so if we want to show reverence what has
[1:05:53] to happen our hearts have to be changed
[1:05:57] right we have to have soft hearts tender
[1:05:59] hearted the bible says
[1:06:03] in that which is not corruptable even
[1:06:06] the ornament
[1:06:06] and that beautiful that's a good thought
[1:06:08] your soul is incorruptible because the
[1:06:10] seed of god's in there praise god
[1:06:13] see your character is incorruptible when
[1:06:16] you have the character of christ built
[1:06:17] into you
[1:06:18] that's eternal life praise god that's
[1:06:20] eternal character amen
[1:06:22] doesn't corrupt even the ornament of a
[1:06:25] meek and quiet spirit which is in the
[1:06:27] sight of god
[1:06:28] a great price it's a great victory
[1:06:32] as our sisters are meek and quiet praise
[1:06:34] god
[1:06:35] right towards their husbands it's a
[1:06:37] great victory when our brothers
[1:06:39] honor their their wives that's a great
[1:06:42] victory
[1:06:42] it's a great price it's not a small
[1:06:44] thing it's a great victory
[1:06:47] glory
[1:06:56] now paul closes ephesians 5.
[1:07:00] now i notice verse 32 is that our text
[1:07:03] the mystery
[1:07:03] as christ and the church this is all
[1:07:06] about christ in the church
[1:07:09] you know a lot of times we'll use this
[1:07:10] text for marriage teaching that's great
[1:07:12] but this really this tonight this is the
[1:07:15] way
[1:07:15] it should be preached it should be
[1:07:17] preached for the church as a whole
[1:07:19] to reverence jesus christ
[1:07:23] and obey every word of christ that's
[1:07:26] really what it boils down that's the
[1:07:27] real reality of it
[1:07:30] but he ends it verse 33 nevertheless
[1:07:32] that every one of you in particular so
[1:07:34] love his wife
[1:07:35] even as himself and the wife see that
[1:07:39] she reverence her husband
[1:07:41] praise god
[1:07:45] so brothers we have a great duty as much
[1:07:46] as we love ourselves
[1:07:48] we need to love our wives that same way
[1:07:51] right that's why i tell my wife i say
[1:07:53] honey if you need something
[1:07:54] get it because that's how i am if i want
[1:07:57] something
[1:07:58] most of the time i'm going to get it
[1:08:01] because why should i wait without it if
[1:08:02] i can get it
[1:08:04] you know what i mean why should i make
[1:08:05] my life harder you know it's going to be
[1:08:07] i'll make it easier
[1:08:09] that's why god give me that money to
[1:08:10] spend what am i gonna do take that money
[1:08:12] to heaven
[1:08:14] am i gonna turn to heaven i'm gonna i
[1:08:16] need to use it here that's why the lord
[1:08:18] gave it to me praise god
[1:08:20] to take care of myself now there's a
[1:08:22] time and season that was the other time
[1:08:24] to save there's a time to give
[1:08:26] there's a season to lose and a season to
[1:08:27] get but it's
[1:08:29] it's this idea of love well if i'm
[1:08:31] taking care of myself
[1:08:33] i'm definitely going to take care of my
[1:08:34] wife that's what the scripture says
[1:08:36] so he ends this on love a husband loves
[1:08:40] and a wife
[1:08:41] reverences she stands in awe of her
[1:08:43] husband i wouldn't say nothing against
[1:08:45] that man of god
[1:08:46] i wouldn't say nothing against him he's
[1:08:48] god's servant remember that story
[1:08:50] from mishawaka i wouldn't say nothing
[1:08:53] against god's servant
[1:08:54] that's a strange situation brother man
[1:08:56] woke up in that at home he went remember
[1:08:57] went to the
[1:08:58] black man's house with his wife and he
[1:09:01] was gone but
[1:09:01] just brother man was there and his wife
[1:09:03] was there so i don't know or maybe they
[1:09:05] had kids or something
[1:09:06] but he said uh where's your husband
[1:09:08] sister
[1:09:10] and he said he left and uh he's gonna be
[1:09:12] gone for a few days and
[1:09:14] brother man said well did he leave you
[1:09:15] with any money she's like no
[1:09:17] doesn't that upset you and she said no i
[1:09:19] would never speak a word against god's
[1:09:20] servant
[1:09:22] that's a real respect right there praise
[1:09:24] god right
[1:09:26] god help us all we all need more
[1:09:27] reverence for the lord
[1:09:29] we need honor for one another and we
[1:09:31] need respect for jesus christ
[1:09:34] we can do it we are doing it by god's
[1:09:37] grace
[1:09:38] but like the bible says we can grow in
[1:09:39] this grace also
[1:09:41] there's 30 minutes i'm going to go a
[1:09:42] little bit more in 30 minutes okay
[1:09:44] i'll set another timer so paul ends with
[1:09:47] love now let me end with this thought
[1:09:49] about false prophets
[1:09:50] and i think this will make us thankful
[1:09:52] for the churches we live in you know
[1:09:53] sometimes i get discouraged or we don't
[1:09:54] see enough prophecy
[1:09:56] but that's okay because you and i should
[1:09:58] not even try to get close to prophesying
[1:10:00] unless we know it's god
[1:10:02] because if we do if we go past that it
[1:10:04] shows we lost our respect
[1:10:06] for christ we lost our reverence for the
[1:10:09] name of god
[1:10:11] when we start trying to speak for him
[1:10:13] and it's not our duty to speak for him
[1:10:16] now i don't have the video but i was
[1:10:18] gonna maybe i'll share it on sunday
[1:10:20] but anyways we the next section is
[1:10:22] judging christian groups by their fruits
[1:10:25] the bible says i told this to a work
[1:10:27] co-worker today her name is mindy no
[1:10:29] one's gonna know who it is
[1:10:30] but i gave mindy my book and she loved
[1:10:32] it and she gave it to some amish people
[1:10:34] she's not
[1:10:34] i mean her hair shorter almost as short
[1:10:36] as mine but she said she loved my book
[1:10:38] so i don't know what to i don't know
[1:10:39] what to say about that
[1:10:40] anyways she wanted she wanted five extra
[1:10:42] copies of my book i gave it to her that
[1:10:43] was last year
[1:10:45] anyways i ran into her today and she
[1:10:47] said you know where i'm doing another
[1:10:48] bible study i said great great get to
[1:10:50] know the bible
[1:10:51] she said i don't want to judge anybody
[1:10:52] and i said that's right mindy
[1:10:54] i said we don't judge their eternal
[1:10:56] destination but jesus said judge their
[1:10:58] fruits
[1:10:59] and judge their actions
[1:11:03] she's like that's good i said that's
[1:11:05] what jesus said
[1:11:07] i just read it this morning actually on
[1:11:08] the note sorry that i was right it was
[1:11:10] ready right there ready to go
[1:11:12] we're not to judge the destination but
[1:11:14] we are to look at their lives
[1:11:16] and see what's coming out of their mouth
[1:11:18] what do they believe and how do they act
[1:11:20] we're supposed to judge that
[1:11:22] that's our duty to do that the bible
[1:11:24] said prove all things
[1:11:26] test every spirit and jesus specifically
[1:11:30] says
[1:11:31] warning us about men
[1:11:34] right matthew 24 4 and jesus answers to
[1:11:37] them take heed that
[1:11:38] no man deceive you
[1:11:42] now god by god's grace i would never
[1:11:43] want to deceive you that's why i even
[1:11:45] told you my mistake on the video this
[1:11:46] morning i ain't got nothing to hide
[1:11:48] i'm a man i'm not i'm gonna be judged by
[1:11:50] christ uh
[1:11:51] hopefully on the when judgment rewards
[1:11:53] are given out
[1:11:54] not the white throne judgment my god
[1:11:56] that's my prayer
[1:11:58] but see i i would never want to deceive
[1:12:00] you i would never want to bring a
[1:12:02] preacher in here that would deceive
[1:12:03] anybody
[1:12:04] and if so i trust god would give me
[1:12:06] grace to not invite them back
[1:12:08] but jesus specifically warns us of false
[1:12:11] prophets
[1:12:13] and we can only judge groups as
[1:12:16] as they adhere to the word of god as
[1:12:18] they're glued to the word
[1:12:20] or they detach from the word of god
[1:12:22] that's the only way to judge them
[1:12:24] so church we're not being prideful when
[1:12:26] we can say this church is truly not the
[1:12:27] bride
[1:12:29] i just gave you five five easy
[1:12:32] attributes to show if it's a bride
[1:12:33] church or not
[1:12:34] and we should be able to clearly
[1:12:35] identify if a church's bride or not
[1:12:38] right because either they keep those
[1:12:39] five things or they don't
[1:12:41] and they're so obvious right outward
[1:12:44] appearance is very obvious
[1:12:46] marriage situations are very obvious
[1:12:48] right
[1:12:50] uh all kinds of other things we listed
[1:12:53] there
[1:12:54] there's so many they're so obvious and
[1:12:56] so it's not we're like we're being
[1:12:57] judgmental
[1:12:58] but we are judging what we see we are
[1:13:01] uh and can i just say like this
[1:13:03] analyzing the situation to see what we
[1:13:04] got i mean
[1:13:05] i'm not sure how house to say it we're
[1:13:08] looking at the reality of the situation
[1:13:12] when i watch these videos yesterday and
[1:13:13] today i was so blessed
[1:13:15] uh there's a minister and this was
[1:13:17] really something and i'll just have to
[1:13:19] tell you i have to show you the examples
[1:13:20] maybe sunday if i can
[1:13:21] i still want to show you examples of
[1:13:23] good and bad music and i still want to
[1:13:24] show you these examples
[1:13:26] there's a charismatic movement which you
[1:13:28] know it's called the word of faith how
[1:13:29] many ever heard of it
[1:13:30] it's big names like benny hinn right uh
[1:13:34] creflo dollar right uh kenneth copeland
[1:13:37] those are probably the biggest names you
[1:13:38] might hear of
[1:13:40] well every year they make predictions
[1:13:41] right about what the year is going to be
[1:13:43] like
[1:13:44] and they say the lord came to me in 2019
[1:13:47] and told me that it's
[1:13:48] going to be like this and then the next
[1:13:50] year is going to be like this
[1:13:52] well this one brother not in the message
[1:13:54] he went and he looked at all their
[1:13:56] predictions for 2020
[1:13:59] and i watched the video or i listened to
[1:14:00] the video today while i was driving
[1:14:02] and he put 20 preachers on their big
[1:14:04] name preachers
[1:14:05] and showed all their predictions for
[1:14:07] 2020.
[1:14:08] now who would have thought church
[1:14:12] in 2020 that we would have had a global
[1:14:14] pandemic
[1:14:15] shut down almost every section of
[1:14:18] society
[1:14:20] right shut down sports uh government
[1:14:23] the middle class restaurants hollywood
[1:14:27] so this guy i i i made a comment that
[1:14:29] when i just made this stop i said thank
[1:14:31] you for your great work he and
[1:14:32] he he ain't even a message you believe
[1:14:34] he ain't even pentecostal
[1:14:36] but i thanked him for his work and all
[1:14:38] 20
[1:14:40] 19 of them didn't say anything about
[1:14:42] anything hard
[1:14:44] now can you imagine all 20 said god told
[1:14:46] me about the year 2020.
[1:14:48] all 20 of them said blessings prosperity
[1:14:53] stadiums are going to be filled with all
[1:14:55] kinds more stadiums than ever going to
[1:14:56] be filled with people praising the lord
[1:14:58] and god on purpose look at that on
[1:15:02] purpose
[1:15:02] god showed them that they're false
[1:15:04] prophets
[1:15:06] but you should see their incomes they
[1:15:07] keep going up you should see there are
[1:15:09] youtube videos
[1:15:11] millions people keep going to these
[1:15:13] false prophets you know why
[1:15:14] because the bible said they love false
[1:15:16] prophecies
[1:15:18] put up jeremiah 5 31 it's scriptural
[1:15:21] they say they
[1:15:22] keep to themselves teachers having
[1:15:23] itching ears tell me
[1:15:25] lies they want lies and you can hear it
[1:15:28] they clap for the lies
[1:15:30] year after year after that's because
[1:15:33] church
[1:15:33] they don't have the spirit of truth but
[1:15:35] we got the spirit of truth praise god
[1:15:37] amen
[1:15:38] or we don't want lies we only want the
[1:15:40] truth of god
[1:15:42] jeremiah 5 31 it's okay to gang it up
[1:15:44] the prophets prophesy
[1:15:46] falsely and the priests bear rule by
[1:15:48] their means
[1:15:49] and my people love whose people god's
[1:15:52] people
[1:15:53] now they weren't true god's people they
[1:15:55] were just called by god's name
[1:15:58] just like today they go by the name
[1:16:00] christian but they're really not god's
[1:16:01] people
[1:16:02] because god's people god's true people
[1:16:04] they don't love lies
[1:16:06] they hate lies and my people love to
[1:16:10] have it so and what will you do in the
[1:16:12] end thereof
[1:16:15] that's uh jeremiah 5 31. and we know
[1:16:18] jeremiah is a big rebuke right it's the
[1:16:19] last
[1:16:20] one the last prophets before what was
[1:16:23] the last prophet and then zedekiah
[1:16:25] last king were taken out of out of judah
[1:16:27] that was the last king
[1:16:28] and then it was exile time for 70 years
[1:16:30] the last one
[1:16:32] and the people there they love the false
[1:16:34] prophecies
[1:16:35] so the brothers showed 20 preachers
[1:16:37] before 2020
[1:16:38] that all said good things and only one
[1:16:41] woman said well i see a crisis
[1:16:42] but then god's going to give great grace
[1:16:44] after it now can you imagine
[1:16:46] something that's never happened in our
[1:16:48] lifetime before
[1:16:49] and nobody god didn't show it to all
[1:16:51] these prophets
[1:16:54] and then after colvin struck he showed
[1:16:56] prophet after prophet the same ones
[1:16:59] said they to end and it's going to get
[1:17:01] better
[1:17:02] and it got worse and they all said in
[1:17:05] the name of the lord
[1:17:06] i cursed this coronavirus and then the
[1:17:09] election came in november
[1:17:11] and they all said trump was going to get
[1:17:13] a second term every one of them
[1:17:15] now church that that's just three and it
[1:17:18] happens
[1:17:19] every year year after year after year
[1:17:22] that's a woman that's a false bride that
[1:17:25] doesn't respect the lord
[1:17:28] because she speaks in his name lies she
[1:17:31] deceives in his name
[1:17:32] but the real bride reverences the name
[1:17:34] of jesus
[1:17:36] and won't speak anything unless it's
[1:17:38] thus saith the lord
[1:17:40] how many believe that if you want the
[1:17:43] link let me know i'll share it with you
[1:17:44] after service or something like that
[1:17:46] it's a it's amazing to see him say that
[1:17:49] and then i saw i love youtube boy yeah
[1:17:51] there's a lot of things i don't like
[1:17:52] about youtube but that's one thing i
[1:17:54] like about youtube
[1:17:55] they got those videos saved on there and
[1:17:56] you just got to click and say what'd
[1:17:57] they say last year
[1:18:00] what'd they say last month what what are
[1:18:02] these so-called prophets see
[1:18:03] they didn't see nothing they saw what
[1:18:07] they saw was the lies from satan is what
[1:18:08] they saw
[1:18:10] all right let me close
[1:18:14] we are to judge individuals and
[1:18:17] situations
[1:18:19] the bible said heretics avoid
[1:18:22] we're to judge individuals and say
[1:18:24] that's heresy
[1:18:27] and we are to avoid them jesus christ
[1:18:30] said judge
[1:18:30] not according to the appearance he said
[1:18:34] but
[1:18:34] judge righteous judgment
[1:18:37] don't look at just outside things that
[1:18:39] you see
[1:18:40] right judge righteously
[1:18:46] remember paul prayed for the philippians
[1:18:47] remember this i love this from chapter 1
[1:18:49] philippians 1 verse 9 and 10 i pray that
[1:18:51] your love may abound more and more
[1:18:53] knowledge and in all judgment
[1:18:58] all judgment that ye may approve
[1:19:02] things that are excellent that's why i
[1:19:03] want to get to that music thought that's
[1:19:05] why i'm going to get to these
[1:19:06] examples of false prophets because we're
[1:19:07] supposed to show this is go
[1:19:09] this is okay this is excellent this is
[1:19:11] calmly to worship god this way
[1:19:14] it's the right way to worship god we're
[1:19:16] supposed to be the ones approving
[1:19:17] and we should grow in this like our
[1:19:20] standards shouldn't get lacked we see so
[1:19:21] many people in the message
[1:19:22] their standards are so high but then
[1:19:24] they fall over the years
[1:19:26] that's not a real christian a real
[1:19:28] christian grows in judgment praise god
[1:19:31] it doesn't lay down the standards the
[1:19:33] christian raises up the standard amen
[1:19:37] raise up a standard against wickedness
[1:19:40] remember paul said who is the mature
[1:19:42] christian he said
[1:19:43] those that eat strong meat they he said
[1:19:46] they are
[1:19:47] skillful in the word of righteousness
[1:19:49] but baby christians can't judge what's
[1:19:51] right or wrong
[1:19:56] like i asked the brother on the email
[1:19:57] yesterday i said well is billy paul
[1:20:00] the real joseph or not he said i can't
[1:20:02] judge it
[1:20:03] because in 1951 brother ram said billy
[1:20:05] paul said joseph in 1956 he said joseph
[1:20:07] is
[1:20:08] joseph i said if both of us saith the
[1:20:10] lord which one's joseph are there two
[1:20:11] josephs
[1:20:12] and they said i can't judge well of
[1:20:14] course you can't because you're a baby
[1:20:16] right if you're a real mature christian
[1:20:18] you can
[1:20:19] you can exerci exercise discernment to
[1:20:21] know okay this one was
[1:20:22] this was just a feeling this was his
[1:20:24] personal opinion and this is the real
[1:20:26] one right here
[1:20:28] you can judge that because you know
[1:20:29] god's word doesn't contradict itself
[1:20:32] right and that doesn't make somebody uh
[1:20:34] stumble
[1:20:35] it makes somebody who's who's exercised
[1:20:38] who's mature
[1:20:39] in judging situations not according to
[1:20:41] appearance but judging righteous
[1:20:43] judgment
[1:20:44] now let's stand to our feet here
[1:20:46] musicians you can come
[1:20:48] lord willing next time church i'm going
[1:20:50] to go through catholics
[1:20:51] protestants ether and orthodox anglicans
[1:20:54] oriental orthodox mormons jehovah's
[1:20:57] witnesses you name it
[1:20:58] in the book i show all where they get
[1:21:00] off the word of god
[1:21:02] because the bride doesn't get off the
[1:21:04] word of god
[1:21:08] the bride i'll say it again the bride
[1:21:11] doesn't get off on the word of god
[1:21:14] she's in the word all the way
[1:21:17] she don't obey in some things she obeys
[1:21:20] in everything
[1:21:24] and if and if jesus wants us to obey
[1:21:27] everything he has to make a way for us
[1:21:29] to achieve it
[1:21:31] praise god is by the indwelling power of
[1:21:34] the holy spirit
[1:21:37] just feeding that power growing in that
[1:21:39] power growing in love
[1:21:41] growing in judgment paul said that's my
[1:21:43] prayer that the church will grow in
[1:21:45] judgment
[1:21:50] we want to grow in knowledge there's 1.3
[1:21:54] billion catholics there's 900 million
[1:21:58] protestants there's 270 million ether
[1:22:03] eastern orthodox there's 110 million
[1:22:05] anglicans
[1:22:06] there's 62 million oriental orthodox and
[1:22:10] there's 37 million others i guess worthy
[1:22:12] all others
[1:22:16] oh my goodness and each one claims i'm
[1:22:19] the bride
[1:22:20] i'm the right well how do you know uh we
[1:22:22] got a good we got a good measuring stick
[1:22:24] right here praise god
[1:22:25] amen the bible calls it the canon we all
[1:22:28] walk by one rule one measuring stick
[1:22:30] here's the the judgment for god's bride
[1:22:33] oh i'm so glad church we have a way to
[1:22:35] know who is the bride
[1:22:37] oh it's a mystery it's a great mystery
[1:22:40] but i speak concerning christ
[1:22:41] in the church let's have a word of
[1:22:43] prayer here
[1:22:45] just play a piece of god cover me
[1:22:50] tonight
[1:22:56] five attributes of a bride
[1:23:01] i'm gonna say lord help me to manifest

[1:23:06] myself

[1:23:52] and different churches
[1:23:55] so mysterious how can there be so many
[1:23:57] churches
[1:23:58] but it has to be that way for there's a
[1:24:00] great falling away of
[1:24:02] so-called brides they're falling away
[1:24:05] from
[1:24:06] paul's gospel
[1:24:09] as paul said you'll be judged by my
[1:24:11] gospel according to jesus christ
[1:24:13] and to change one thing is to be cursed
[1:24:17] so god there's one true bride and she
