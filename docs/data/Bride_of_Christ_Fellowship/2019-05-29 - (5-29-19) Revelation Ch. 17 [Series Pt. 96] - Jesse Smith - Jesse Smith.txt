here tonight teachers through thy word father we need more of you Lord and we ask how did you grant it to us here tonight it will give you all the glory in Jesus Christ name terrset amen let's take our Bibles here tonight let's go to revelation 17 I think I want to move on from chapter 16 I covered most of what I wanted to cover there and the revelation 17 of course is a very familiar to us but I still like to go through and just do a few thoughts on that tonight we'll see maybe we one or two services we'll see what the Lord has in revelation 17 I like to just start at verse one revelation 17 verse 1 I don't know how much my children know about this so with a small group like this I think it's okay if they hear it you know maybe their first time here in it but I have three videos on Mystery Babylon on the website and there they got a pretty good amount of views so it's a good topic it's one of the twelve mysteries of the New Testament so it's really critical that it's preached and hopefully their children get a lot out of it and not brother Aaron I hope you get some out of there too by God's grace so but parmi if there's a little bit of overlap but I just feel led to go right through and like I said maybe one or two services on this let's look to the Lord here as we looked at the scripture revelation 17 1 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the judgment of the great and sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication let's read verse five together rather on three one two three and upon her forehead was a name written Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth let's just bar heads for one more word of Prayer let's ask God to help us here tonight teach us through his word and ultimately like verse 8 says give us wisdom amen I'm sorry verse 9 gives us wisdom to understand this woman and then also stay away from all that she does heavenly father Lord we bow our heads Lord oh I lift my head to heaven I lift my eyes Lord my hands to heaven Lord as Solomon did so many years ago when he dedicated the temple the Bible said he lifted his hands to heaven Oh God and he called upon the Living God and so I do the same I'm not dedicating a church today but I'm dedicating my life afresh Oh God every day I want to lift my hands lift up holy a of the Saint Paul said and dedicate myself to you for this service Lord every service is crucial every meal we eat is crucial Lord God as as we take care of our temples dear God so Lord speak to us today and father help us to understand Lord and have wisdom as the scripture says that we might fully be a part of the true church the true Bride of Christ not false bride or this false church that we read about here the Lord it's in Holy Writ for a reason and the Lord it was so deceptive that John didn't know what he was surprised by it because the church looks so holy looks so beautiful but Lord inwardly full Lord of wicked things Lord God a cage of unclean and hateful bird so father I pray administer here now to us today bless our brother for pressing out Lord be with those livestreaming dear Jesus may your Holy Spirit minister to each person in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous bein seated here praise the Lord so like to look to a few thoughts here some of them I mentioned briefly but I like to spend a little more time on them tonight I don't have any slides I'm sorry to have time this week on a real busy week so I'm in the chapter that I wrote on this and I think I'll just hit the highlights because it's really long but I think I always wanted the highlights now there's a lot of reasons to read this of course to know who the false woman is the false church to stay away from her but as you study the false one you also get a better idea the true one now thankfully since the reason we're here that shows we already know a lot about the true church thank God for that we believe we're a part of it praise God Christ called us out of the world out of Egypt as we saw on Sunday out of Egypt by the prophet of God which we believed to be brother Branham for this day it brought his messages brought us through sanctification and and into the matches of the Holy Ghost into the promised land and now we're fighting off those seven demons a menace of seven countries that had to be driven out by God's grace we're driving them out yeah that's what I think will be a great help in this upcoming book because will cover the will cover the Bride of Christ before we cover this false one and so brother and says if you want to know a false dollar study the real dollar so in the book we'll be able to study the true dollar first and then the the the the false church should be so obvious I think is for us that's why we're here but hopefully would be so obvious to those who've never thought about it before that they'll be able to quickly see I can't be a part of false I got to be a part of the true that's what we like to experience now I want to just review a few scriptures here so we take heed because our danger our danger for us as we said probably isn't rule we'll go back and join a denomination that's not our danger the danger for us is that if if we stay at church and we don't continue on with God as we saw on Sunday with the sights riverman that we'd either camp out at the we camp out at I'm sorry the Jordan River and not go in the promised land or fall back away like Judas that's the danger for us if we started on the road we got to make sure we continue into the Promised Land now if we get in the promised land we'll never leave the Promised Land in it but I'm talking about overall as a church we don't want to leave anybody behind right in the military they don't leave anybody behind the Marines leave nobody behind I believe it's the Marines if I'm not mistaken leave no man behind is that right merica he reads a lot on the world war two he would know better and I would so we leave no man behind and as a pastor that's my burden I want to see everybody that's probably your burden too with the church the local church to see everybody fully into the promised land into the things of God you see fruits of God pouring out of their lives you see gifts of God work in their lives that's what we want to see we don't leave anybody behind so that scripture as I was prepared and came to my heart take heed so that the words there so let's go to Hebrews 3:12 I just want to take a few scriptures here and look at taking heed to our lives so Hebrews 3:12 yeah that's right I'd like to read that here the Bible said take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God that's a beautiful picture there a true picture rather of Judas of course which is that beautiful but maybe sad yeah the evil heart of unbelief and he departed from the Living God Judas is the one that left the Last Supper the Lord's Supper he's the one that left Jesus invited there Jesus we don't want him to stay there but Jesus knew he had to go do what he had to do he was free destined to do that but take heed we want to take heed go to Luke 21 please verse 34 Jesus foretells Jerusalem's destruction and some of his last words here were take heed to yourselves so Luke 21 now this take heat is an interesting definition it means to hold the mind towards pay attention be cautious about apply yourself so be very cautious so when Jesus says is he's saying look at yourselves right so Luke 21 34 take heed to yourself that's why I church is such a wonderful thing right we come here now we said on Sunday you know we come here to consider one another but part of the time too so as we're considering others we also would look real close at our lives I need to see well how did I act this morning you know how did I how did I act this week did I treat everybody at work the right way did I say anything wrong about anybody I say anything wrong about any of the children you know too we need to look at our lives real closely because Jesus said take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting or surfeiting now in the Greek that means like a headache from drunkenness so be careful your heart doesn't get a hangover I'll say like that like you're so people get so drunk Adan the things of the world they get a hangover right towards this things of God is what I'm talking about right like like tomorrow night they'll get so drunk on the NBA Finals or is it the Stanley Cup tomorrow which one is it though they'll get so drunk on that that when it comes to God it's like they got a headache towards the things of God I can't even think about that who could think about that we're so interest about who's gonna win the big Stanley Cup you know like and they're gonna they're all gonna kiss that with their dirty lips and you know are gonna take it you know to all around the world where they go and it's all got the fingerprints on it and it's jus German fest but to them they think that big Cup is is something so valuable but in God's eyes it's only gonna burn Paul says don't labor for the things that are corruptible he said run for the things that are incorruptible amen and the world loves to give out they love to have their own award ceremonies and that so ridiculous those movie stars they have well we'll just put on our own award ceremony we'll honor each other you know oh it's so prideful it's so ridiculous I've even seen churches in the last few years that have started their own award ceremonies not message but I've seen Church of Christ Church some of my former friends that they have now award ceremonies every year of who's doing the most for the kingdom of God a church can you could you even imagine that you know like who's really progressing in the city or or who's really doing a great job on social media for Jesus you know Awards like that the Bible you know the Bible said we ought not to exalt one another we are not to flatter one another but the Bible said we ought to live for the honor of God not the honor of men right oh it's so sad isn't that crazy that's what that's what people see see but what those denominations are doing they're looking at the award shows of the world because they love their movies and music and they want to try to copy it so they get all dressed up and and the women you know half-naked still even in the church ceremonies you know showing off their clothes and their body parts and things like that and trying to claim that's the true church well I Got News for you that's the false church amen that ain't the true church but see there hi there heart scan over charged with drunk with drunkenness they have a hangover in their heart because they're so drunken on the things of the world when they comes as the real reality of God's Word oh how could you that's what they told me those same brothers that did that the Church of Christ the same once told me all he's brother Ram is a false prophet the same ones and now look where we are all these years later you know we're how many years since I graduated 15 years and one of us as one side well they got their denomination there they got their hipster movement there they still speak in tongues but they got their award ceremonies and they got women to preach and Here I am I'm over here in a small little church like this but I'm preaching God's Word amen amen those small and despised and rejected not despised from heaven amen hallelujah I think sometimes I think that brother and I think all right let's just take a look back and see 15 years later where we at and some of my friends that were a part of those churches or have divorces now because of adulteries yet they could speak in tongues a mile a minute I never could speak in tongues so sometimes I look back and say well God which side are you on and we know God's on our side because we got the word amen and they said brother Branham was an antichrist sir all these things that look where they are now look where we are more in love with Jesus amen we're thankful for the prophet we've got him in his position we're not exalted in him we thank God he's a higher position than all of us because he's one of the seven stars of God but we don't worship Him we worship the one whose hand he's in amen glory so see that's just giving you a simple example and yet they speak in tongues and miracles and that's wonderful thank God for that if it's of God many times we don't know cuz Satan could impersonate a lot of that but you look at their lives you look at their stand on the Word of God and we're standing with a true Church by the Word of God hey hey man and see the cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares so see me Jesus saying take heed so that the rapture the tribulation doesn't come upon you and your unaware of it oh we're in a wonderful spot tonight church aren't we we're in a great spot tonight because we're fulfilling what Hebrews 3:12 and Luke 21 34 we're taking heed to ourselves amen and say we say Lord let my heart not be evil let me have a good heart the Bible says that I don't that I depart from the world and that I unite with Christ we don't when depart from God with the evil heart we want to draw near unite to God with a good heart that's why we're here tonight praise God the matter the number no matter the Searchers circumstances situation you know our financial situation even our physical health situation no matter what those things say we come here to take heed to ourselves to exalt Jesus Christ in our lives amen now this is echoed I meant man there's so many scriptures it's kind of hard to - I just I guess I'll just read some before Paul left Ephesus in acts 20 verse 28 he said take heed therefore unto yourselves what is he doing he's repeating the same thing jesus said and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which is purchased with his own blood amen I had to run off we had Bible Club tonight at school and I had to run off and I said where are you going I said I'm going to preach God's food to God's sheep amen I'm going to God's eternal food to God's sheep hallelujah see that's so that's what that's what Paul said to do take heed to yourselves make sure you feed God's people the Word of God now go to Roman's 11 this is a good one that really struck me as powerful Romans 11 21 so this is in the chapter of Israel being blinded or another word is called grafted I'm sorry cut off from being we're grafted but Israel is cut off from the holy tree so imagine God is like a tree well Israel was one of those branches God cut it off and he grafted us in but look what he says here verse 20 I show start verse 20 well because of unbelief they were broken up and Stannis my faith be not high-minded but fear so see we never we never turn up our nose at Jews and run they rejected Jesus well we sorted all the Gentiles right are you with mixtures all the Gentiles never you know they all stood by Pilate and all the Roman centurions and they they helped Jesus right so which means everybody would have crucified Jesus I remember Isaiah 53 said all we like sheep have scattered right all of us would have did that but is right all that time and so God said fine I'm giving enough time I'm going to the Gentiles there'll be a Gentile people that we receive me in other words I don't have mercy on the Gentiles that some Gentiles be saved amen I've saved all these Jews before the Messiah but now says they rejected I'll turn to the Gentiles I'll give them a chance to be grafted into the life of God so don't be high-minded I call or so much better than those people in Jerusalem you know no no he said fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee you have to remember that we have to take heed to ourselves that God doesn't get fed up with us right we've got to make sure we live a godly life so God as they find I'm cutting you off we'll go back to the Jews I thought that was pretty powerful there yeah that's just a beautiful chapter I remember I preached on that one time when we preached on that entire chapter now this is for preachers but 1st Corinthians 3:11 said I'm sorry 3:10 says but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon that's that's my desire I'm you something you know I try to be very careful what I build upon Paul's foundation so I'm worth the very top like I'm if I'm a real preacher at the end time that I'm like finishing the very top of this building now I want to make sure I build it upon paul's foundation Jesus Christ the chief Cornerstone right but I want to build on and Paul said take heed how you build upon it that's why even like Sunday was such a revelation Judas was genuinely justified he was genuinely sanctified and that's something that God had to correct in my ministry I never really believed that I always thought it was just pretend and you know cuz there's one we're brother and says that but the Word of God said they were sanctified and then they turned it and tried it out underfoot they stomped upon it now 1st Corinthians 8:9 is important for all of us but take heed lest by any means this Liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to them that are weak so we got to be careful what we eat careful what we consider holy days can careful about what we drink right because those are the the main things Paul lists here be careful that our Liberty don't become a stumbling block now I'll be honest I can't really think of any times where any liberties of mine have some of people because I don't drink wine at home I'm gonna drink wine at church I can't think of you know any holy days I can't think of any time where I've stumbled somebody if I have Lord to please show me you remind me so I can get that right I can't think of any time like a Liberty like that I think oh yeah I think the main Liberty brother Aaron I think I'm you we were here when I preached it was some of the things we do for Christmas how we worship at Christmas time I think that's the only real Liberty that might cause somebody you know cuz we just do gifts but I don't think there's anything wrong with what we do but it's the only thing that's may come in question as a stumbling block to people but no one's ever came to tell me that it stumbled them and caused them to sin right because I thought the only way that I could cause somebody's sin is if they saw a well the pastor buys gifts and then so foolishly they would go out and spend like ten thousand dollars on gifts and then blame it on me you know that mean the only way I think that they could blame me for something like that but that's just my experience with taking heed to myself that it don't cause somebody to stumble alright I'll go to first Corinthians 10 this is a good scripture here a lot of these things are gonna with the Catholic Church and Babylon are gonna be familiar these are more kind like refreshers so let's point them out so we can see them now this is a beaut chapter my first Corinthians 10 how I'd like to preach is the series on this book so verse 7 he tells us not to be idolaters because that's what Israel was verse 8 tells not to commit fornication 23,000 died there after Balaam and Balak invited them which brother ram typed to Constantine and the the councils where they adopted the Trinity verse 9 let us not tempt Christ verse 10 let us not murmur that's when we got to be real careful right make sure we don't complain we don't wanna complain against other people don't we definitely want to complain against God or God's servants or anyone laity anyone we don't want because we're all God's servants amen we all do something for the kingdom of God but we don't want to complain now verse 11 now all these things happen to them for and samples and they're written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come so see even 2,000 years ago Paul's like this to the end of the world see there's just two days right in God's mind a thousand years in two thousand years it's the last the last days the last two days and so it is the ends of the world verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there hath no temptation taken you such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape or to escape that you may be able to bear it wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry I speak as to why and judge ye what I say Amen one thing I love about verse 13 it doesn't say I'm faithful it says God is faithful amen God is the faithful one and in every trial God's faithfulness won't be won't reject me and allowed to be such a hard trial that I can't overcome whether it's our financial temptation or a lust temptation or an anger temptation or a depression temptation he'll never let it be so hard that I can't get the victory because he's faithful amen now let's go - let's start with now back to revelation 17 verse 9 there's quite a few more take heeds there's about four or five I couldn't get to but let's just let's just get here now - this thought on wisdom now preaches a few months ago I think how wisdom is the only requirement to recognize this woman now can I just say like this well then how important is wisdom if wisdom is the only thing that's required how important is that I mean it's huge right it's huge so first crime sorry so revelation 17 9 and here's the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth now if you got your Bible go to Revelation 13 let's just read that one reminder revelation 13:8 so to recognize her physical headquarters and then her number it takes one thing wisdom so let's read 18 here's wisdom but him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six all right now let's go to proverbs here I want to just recall this scripture proverbs 4 proverbs 4 now I want to get to verse 7 that's where I want to emphasize now we preach on the book of Proverbs all about I think what two summers it was a last summer yeah there's been last summer that's right yeah all the tremendous nuggets here in the air is such a blessing let's go to verse 5 yeah let's go to verse 5 get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding praise God now we know there's a different kind of there's a little bit different anointings of wisdom right because we know the foolish version will have at least an anointing of sanctification and wisdom where they'll recognize the mother harlot and they'll have to be martyrs in the tribulation right they'll have such level of that but remember the Holy Ghost field Christian has wisdom as well a greater portion of wisdom amen much greater portion and so wisdom is the principal thing so wisdom is actually a person right the Bible said Christ is the wisdom of God how we know that so let's go there 1st Corinthians 3 I believe I'm going off a memory because I was studying on this Saturday yeah 1st Corinthians 3 let me I need to find the verse real quick I'm sorry first Corinthians 1 I'm sorry Church sorry I thought was 3 1 verse 24 so the beautiful thing is we never have to wonder like his wisdom something separate outside that outside of the Spirit of God that have to define or or seek after and we should seek after it but all wisdom is is an attribute of the Holy Spirit a man just like faith and virtue knowledge that's always the mizzen here's the scripture to prove it to you right here verse verse 23 first Corinthians 1:23 for we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling-block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and what is he the wisdom of God amen so see some people say well if you're preaching wisdom if you're preaching about wisdom that's not really preaching the Holy Ghost well yeah you are because Christ is both the power of God and the wisdom of God amen praise God so some services will preach against sin and will preach against demons and we had a number two people that got delivered from demons couple weeks ago preach the power of God to rebuke those spirits and drive those demons back in the name of Jesus and they they do go back amen thank God for that power but also that spirit is to give us wisdom and wisdom is skillful living so this the wisdom of God will recognize that woman sits on seven hills the false church and her Pope's got a number of 666 right bakari's fill a day so the wisdom of God will direct us to that skillful decision-making so I make the decision of mine that I see that decision the woman sits on seven hills Rome sits on seven hills I can see that I can put those together and so because of that I'll get as far away from Catholicism and an organization as possible even even if it I'll sit like this which a lot of people have been willing to do but even if it divides my house or divides my marriage I'll take the wisdom of God will tell me to stand with a true Church of God amen we've seen some people come out and get a victory we said other people's fall away because they're scared to lose a relationship or that I know it's hard or scared to lose a friendship or something like that but the real wisdom of God will guide you to choose Christ and forsake everything else that's wisdom amen wears them to know well I've got this trouble my house am I gonna compromise or not in fact I was talking to one of my high school friends on texting a few months ago and I said sir why don't you go to this there's a message church in his hometown and we were good friends you know growing up I said why don't you go to this message Church in your hometown he said well which is my wife and my wife gets so mad when we talk about it my children get so mad you know because they visited the message church but they can't fight live it and I said sir I said my friend his name is Chris I said Chris if your wife gets mad the wisdom of God says a soft answer turns away wrath is that right so see that's wisdom when you get in those situations where someone's really really mad you've got to come across gentle loving sincere and when the children get mad I don't want to go there there but they are they are holy rock the music's too loud you got to come across humble well don't you like you like loud music when you go to the school band concert don't you I mean don't they of course we like loud music on your video game which he probably lets young products and play video game you see so you need the wisdom of God to bring a different angle to bring a thought to try to discern that spirit praise God that's the wisdom of God and wisdom isn't like a secondary thing the Bible said wisdom is the principal thing amen see our daily lives we must choose to walk and wisdom and not as fool's we must redeem the time Church its redeeming the time listen to a sermon redeeming the time thank God amen and I thought about that whole listen to sermon in the home that's I've thought about in the end here too that's the wisdom of God and the wise virgins God so I hope that's proven to you that wisdom is not a secondary thing it's not any less than preaching in the power of God and healing the sick and and praying for americo's is not a secondary thing it's an equal thing because Christ is both the power of God and the wisdom of God he also says in verse 30 30 yep 30 so I was gonna say 31 was 30 but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made unto us what does he made unto us wisdom Wow and that beautiful so children when you use the wisdom of God and you're like let's say you're at a fellowship and someone's joking around or saying dirty things or saying things are teasing other people when you change the subject that's the wisdom of God you could say wow that's Christ in me right cuz Christ is the wisdom of God he's made unto us wisdom so when you make the right decision and instead of speaking mad about somebody you speak something good about somebody or you change the subject right there Christ has been made unto you wisdom you can say wow this wisdom just manifested in my life in other words I see the anointing of Jesus Christ in my life amen oh that's beautiful glory and he's made what he's made your righteousness and sanctification and read so the wisdom of God is just it's a pump the anointing of the Holy Spirit remember you could always pray for more because the Bible said add the Bible said grow so you know we have a scripture we're survivors and growing Grace and the knowledge and the wisdom of Revelation oh god give me more wisdom to walk the right way praise God okay now if you got your Bible there let's go to James 1 now this is a thought I kind of mentioned in passing but I I think I'll just take a few minutes here I'm gonna set my timer here and just go a little slower over this Jesus makes it so plain to recognize Mystery Babylon that only a fool would err in salvation and be lost only a fool would be lost it's it's so it's so easy to see he makes it so easy the only requirement is wisdom you have to ask for his wisdom James 1:5 now God you got that buddy can you read it for me hey man thank you now we're liberally in the Greek it means simply openly frankly sincerely like if you ask God say God what do I do I need the wisdom of God he's gonna tell you openly but many times we missed it because it's behind somebody's bad your skin that we don't want to maybe talk to her listen to or maybe it's just playing the word and we don't catch it or we're not prayed up like we ought to but the Bible said God gives it liberally Frank I'll be really frank really sincere this is what you need to do so all that God requires in exchange for his wisdom is a selfless prayer someone who just one has the right motive god I want to please you but how many people do we know that have Catholic friends and they know the truth or we share the truth with them but they don't want to hurt somebody's feelings and so they they won't even ask God you know I'm not even gonna touch the Catholic stuff because I don't want to hurt people's feelings but that's the wrong attitude the wrong the right attitude to say God just tell me sincerely so I can find the right path in life and not be so afraid of hurting people's feelings but be more afraid of the Living God amen yes amen yeah that's right and that's the wisdom of God from Proverbs it's uh-oh especially you know us since we know so much we need to pray for more of that God give me more open doors and you know what the same thing Paul needed boldness bonus same thing Paul needed he said pray for me that I can be both in acts 4 they said God send us the Holy Ghost a refilling so we can be more bold again let me just stop and say this to when we pray for a refilling of the Holy Ghost we're not praying to be sealed again because the Bible never says you can be reseal with the Holy Ghost we are praying for our minds to be transformed our minds to be totally washed out our minds to be totally surrendered and our minds to be fully committed to the Word of God amen I've heard people preach it lately or maybe seems like you can be sealed again you can't be sealed again you're sealed one time to the day of your Redemption amen but the refilling of the Holy Ghost is God cleaning out your mind getting all your desires cleaned out so that you all you want to do is what God wants you to do and you do the works of your first love hey man Gouri hallelujah whoo wasn't somebody somebody came up for prayer I don't remember where it was maybe I was over in Toledo or Michigan where somebody came up and and oh yeah I was at Michigan and I said they asked the to get right with that for refilling of the Holy Ghost and that's what I told him I said your soul is already sealed the trouble is you have worldly desires that are clogging up your mind your spirit and when I said this she bowed her head and started crying I said think about I said you're a mother you can have your first love back I said but what were the works you first did when you first got the Holy Ghost and she put her head down and started crying kind of like the tears of joy because it set her free she realized you don't need another seal the Holy Ghost all's you gotta do is do what you first did when you said you got the Holy Ghost amen that's all you got to do is go back and act like that do those things and you will find your first love see because when you do that you don't do the sin or you don't do the laziness right you're taking heed to your life you're looking at your spiritual life and you're doing exactly what you did at the beginning you got your first love back and your refill with the Holy Ghost amen but it's not it's not another seal me again Lord seal me again well then how long does the seal last then I mean it lasts into the day of your Redemption I beg glory forgive me I'm going to spit in preachers tonight you see but the Bible never said in your seal to the next revival to the day you get a new body amen bori I think there's a great confusion about that in the message because brother Branham says you know brother branham's not confused but people are confused but the RAM says the rapture will take a refilling of the Holy Ghost well that doesn't mean we're going to be sealed again it just means we got to get our minds clear of all the nonsense all the doubts all the fear anything that's kind of any cobwebs that have kind of grown in our minds you know we're spiritual cobwebs wherever you have it little doubts or little frustrations or guilts all that just needs to be washed away all cleaned out you know all the desires cleaned up and do the first works and act like a real Holy Ghost filled sate thank the Lord amen so how do you get wisdom just ask God with the right motive and God will frankly say yes it's the Roman Catholic Church have nothing to do with denominations God will just frankly say that you need to find a new church oh how could I find a new church is there any churches how can I leave my church well you just say goodbye you're not your you're not standing with the word I'm gonna go find somebody that can stand with the word with that's how you do it now you use respect right you use respect when you look when we leave that other churches you know we try to leave with respect then ama national churches you know but God will frankly openly tell us what we need to do if we ask for is Anna isn't that a great blessing like you know some of the brothers will be praying for their job situation or you know marriage situations or you know big major decisions Church situations and the Bible said if we just ask God will give it to us liberally all right what a blessing so if God so easily gives this wisdom then that means people are praying with lustful desire so go to James 4:3 and I did mention this but I want to go slope through it so you can catch it and I think it'll be helpful why no would be helpful because it's God's working James for three now these are fighting churches Peter James is riding the Fighting Christian churches and the message of their day and they're having fights and wars among them because they're praying the wrong prayers verse 1 says from whence come Wars and Fighting's among you come not they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members you lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war yet you have not because you ask not you ask every see not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts so this proves right here most people that won't recognize that I'm talking about not us people that won't recognize the Roman Catholic Church as mother harlot most of their prayers are selfish prayers that they're at they're just asking for their lusts Oh God give us a financial blessing so we can have a big Christmas with big kind of gifts Oh God you know help me to be help me to get some more raises so I can have a bigger house and bigger bigger everything like that they're just asking for the wrong thing help our church to get bigger so you know we can build a bigger building you know they just want it's just all selfish and they never take time just say a simple prayer God can you tell me what real the real church is they'd rather not know so then they don't hurt anybody's feelings they'd rather not know but see most church members cuz most you'll be saved right most church members pray selfish prayers they only asked for their lusts God give me more food God give me better job God give me more money God give me a beautiful husband getting beautiful or handsome husband beautiful wife give me beautiful children they're just asking for selfish things rather than saying God let your will be done not by well amen how many people do you hear pray that Amen Mary for you they just want the biggest church and the most amount of money and all they're less and they just want an easy life let me find that quote brother BAM said our biggest battle are a soft living I believe he called it let me look it up real quick and over the wrong I mean it's hard sometimes when you go through tough times but brother have said the great burden of our last age is the pressure of riches I'll need to make more money oh you need to be a rich man oh that's a pressure right we face right why aren't you making more money it's your fault brother Jesse you should be making more money that's one of the pressures but man so the second one is soft living oh you're working too hard for Christ you need to slow down you seem to take care of your future save thyself listen to those those the Lamplighter books are really good the Satan's always like save yourself don't worry about other people's saviors and you can always tell that's the devil I like that well that's that's that's hey say get out here get thee behind me soft living you need an easier life you're trying to do too much for god oh god help me to do more for you her today not not not that I you know get sicker now that I hurt myself but it helped me Lord to do more help me to be a light to more people praise God and the third one bromance ed is nervous tensions scenes trying to get you nervous oh you better not do that oh you better not be too bold better not preach too hard about that so this all goes together pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions and those are the three hardest battles program says that we battle in Laodicea how many kids Amen see that's why we need the fire of God right we can't be lukewarm can't be cold we got out of the fire of God so the fire of God will help us to reject the pressure I'm not living under the pressure I don't have any pressure my riches are in heaven amen yes I need to pay the bills but I'm not pressured about that because my riches are in heaven my paydays in heaven and soft living lot I can be a rugged Christian nobody's got to Pat me on the back er nobody's got to beg me to come to church or anything like that I'm not a soft pushover or hotbed plant I'm a rugged believer amen a nervous tension I'm not gonna let these cares of the world I could care less about these things what I'll care about is the kingdom of God I've set my affection on things above amen see that's that's that's what the fire of God does takes away the pressure takes away makes us be rugged living Christians a nervous tension I always thinking brother Simon when I think of soft living Simon works hard Simon works hard and then he studies on top of that and then he'll drive here one time for the air I got sick like with the Wednesday and I called him up Wednesday afternoon I said I'm sick at work can you come preach and he came right he he got off at four o'clock he drove home and got his suit and tie and rose right over here to preach the gospel I thought that I'm trying to get him to come out again he hasn't gotten back to me I gave him some dates so just thought you know I'm trying to have him come out for us but he just and then he'll stay up on the hill preach and then drive home two and a half hours get home like 12:00 1:00 2:00 and get up at you know seven or six or seven to go work and you know now he's got to sleep a lot on Saturday to make up for that like he's not superhuman but I'm talking about we got to be willing to make sacrifices and if life is very soft well then so be it we'll catch up later let's do something for the kingdom of God amen like tonight hey man just like tonight driving an hour and a half or me I woke up at you know 5:00 a.m. and worked all day and preached even preach today and Bible clubs this is my second sermon today but it's I really live soft we want to live the way God wants us to live and God will give us seasons to relax and rest later Jesus had seasons he went to pray we know that so God would give us our seasons too now so all that's required as an honest prayer and say God show me the true church give me your wisdom to see which church this on seven hills which Church has 666 in it can you imagine it that's all they have to do to ask for their and that's all jay-z has to do that's all Tom Cruise has to do it goes the Church of Scientology where they believe in all kinds of nonsense mind over matter and all kinds of things like that that's all Mormons have to do they just say God give me wisdom to see these things and God would turn him away from the false prophet Joseph Smith to the real prophet William Branham right and I gave a Mormon friend of mine my book and brother branham's in the back hopefully he said he started reading it he goes to Taekwondo hopefully he'll read it and see that in the back we don't have much time to talk you know but Lord willing God will open up some doors I hope so all right now can everybody see that the wizard require all that's required Church is a prayer just a simple prayer he says wisdom is the principle thing therefore get wisdom so another in other words to get wisdom you gotta get praying right get wisdom well how do you get wisdom ask that's my brother Graham said the foolish version will be left behind and the wise will say go pray up see they were just praying for their needs God give me this God give me this I need this said I don't need to pay the bills I need a new car I need new tires you know I did that's good you know you got to have that but they didn't pray the right thing the right thing is God give me with them to know the false Church the true church give me wisdom to get born again amen show me the areas I need to die out so I couldn't be born again and be a true believer army now let me close with this thought I'll just close to this up this is a new thought I never preached this before about Babylon so the confusion around Babylon who this woman is it centers around her identity let me look I'm sorry let me look so no Brooklyn Jenna thought here yeah okay here's all right yeah so who is identity here not goodness I just I died i typed in seven hills oh my goodness there's uh many many cities that are built on seven hills in Africa there's four in the Americas al new New York out Albany New York Athens Texas there's one three four Cincinnati's built on seven hills did you know that uh I forgot I forgot about this new in Massachusetts there's probably there's probably 20 cities in America built on seven hills Yonkers New York New York Asia has three four five Mecca six seven eight nine ten Asia has ten cities built on seven hills Europe Oh Grafton's Greece's bill I didn't know that could be on seven hills these four five six okay that's what I got thirty or forty mercy okay so the last point I want to close with is that thought the confusion who is this woman now that might be shocking to you but there's probably a list of about fifty to seventy five cities that are built on seven hills so the wisdom of God would say okay this woman is built on seven hills now once you find out why there's about 50 to 75 cities on seven hills then what would the next step of wisdom be would it be to just give up or with the net with the wisdom of God tell you you got to dig a little hard dig a little deeper see what's the wisdom of God gonna tell you children dig a little deeper so if you type in so anybody today that didn't didn't know who's a mystery babylon city on seven hills look at Wikipedia would tell them fifty different cities so you got to go one by one and see which one it is oh my thank god yeah keep reading and church there's along with that one there's eleven so there's there's there's eleven proofs that this woman is the Roman Catholic Church now brothers and sisters this second runner-up the closest one your some of the similar ones that might be kind of close you'd say maybe New York cuz New York seems like it has a great financial headquarters right I mean huge millions of people live there a lot of rats there though a lot of not of cockroaches from what I've heard I know it's a dirty city I've been there a couple of times I never really stayed long though just preached there twice so some some not the runner up but some honorable mention or maybe New York Mecca Saudi Arabia right because that's where a lot of Muslims go so some people that think Mystery Babylon is you know the the Church of Islam that might be a runner up and Saudi Arabians are very rich because of oil all these cities that could fit it now to me those are the only two that could even get close maybe Athens Greece but that's so it's such a minor city anymore now so those are the honorable mention but the runner up who knows who the runner up is Jerusalem Jerusalem is built on seven hills how many knew that it's Mount Scopus Mount Olivet Mount of corruption nah-ah fell Mount Zion old Zion new Mount Zion and the hill on which the Antonia fortress was built Jerusalem was built on seven hills now this is pretty striking this is pretty good because I didn't know that till I started writing this book I'm like well I wonder what the other ones are and I saw a video of a man that says I think it might be how in the world is gruesome sit on seven hills and it does and it makes sense you know with Zion and different Olivet you know different we've all heard of these hills so let's take the last few minutes let's take about 10 minutes and go over this and show how Jerusalem is a pretty good runner up but Mystery Babylon is not Jerusalem the Roman Catholic Church is Jerusalem and again this is not an attack on Roman Catholics I'm many friends that are Roman Catholics good people but it's not an attack it's a call for God's people to come out of her my people that they be not partakers of her sins and her plagues the Catholic Church upholds the doctrines of devils the Bible says which are don't eat meats and don't marry right don't let the priest marry and look at all the sexual corruption that's caused and what I think the saddest part church is that the Bible said she makes merchandise of the souls of men did you know that you remember that from Scripture let's go to Revelation 18 13 so literally literally numbers to Catholic churches are only money its merchandise to them now there may be a good hearted priests the kind old priests can I say like there may be a good kind of are two priests um somewhere around you know maybe a few left but to most of them Church now this is striking most of them those numbers they're those souls are just merchandise all the money the money's gonna pour in and they give them the wafer open your mouth you know I'll put the wafer on your tongue Oh drink of this wine most of them it's just numbers they're not even sheep it's just like machines or numbers to them because that's what the Bible says look at this and cinnamon odors pointment frankincense oil wine oil fine flour wheat B sheep horses chariots slaves and souls of men Liddy go to the previous verse I think it's 12 yeah the merchandise so the mert lists all these type of merchandise and the last one it lists are souls of men to them people are just exchangeable right just like merchandise come and go that's why those priests abused those boys because those boys don't mean nothing them and they never apologize they never repent why because it's just numbers there's just money to them they don't see him as God's sheep they've been see him as gods those belong to God doesn't belong to them they're God's and if anybody was that ever special to you and you recognize that a child was of God who treated with godly respected and you'd honor that child whether it's a boy or girl you'd honor every child of God because they're God's sheep they're God's children and you know they don't belong to you they belong to God amen but to this church the souls of men are merchandise well if this person leaves my church fine go ahead they can go to another church we'll just get more people to come in we'll just have a which I have a bake sale we'll get more people to come in we just have a big Vacation Bible School will get a lot of people to come in here we'll build a gym so then their kids will want to come to our gym and then we'll then we'll have more people come to our church always which a lot of Catholics do they just build schools right private schools see how the money making thing and they got to pay that money for the private school its merchandise souls have become merchandise so Jerusalem is the closest Jerusalem is the runner-up now here's why because now we don't have time to get there but I'm just gonna read them so if you want to read them later write down or go back to listen this sermon on YouTube because Jerusalem is on seven hills also she's called a harlot in Isaiah 121 do you know that that's really yeah cuz I put these up well I sure hope I looked them up because I'm gonna put them in print hope I don't make a mistake there Isaiah 121 and I got one two three four five six seven others where she's called a harlot Isaiah 1:21 you right there can you read it right now see see why the wisdom of God is so important a lot of people believe it in fact that's what the brothers were saying on the video there's a big move to make Mystery Babylon Jerusalem now it used to be Rome everybody used to know was wrong but see they don't wanna hurt feelings there's our to move away but see how there could be kind of a little bit well I could see that two of them are clearer by history and by scripture she's called a harlot I got eight times Israel's a harlot the faithful City right she's a city who sits on seven hills a harlot City and see what's another one Jesus isn't been the Messiah in that another one makes it look like she's not the right Church right oh my goodness striking see how it could stumble people Jerusalem's also called the holy city my in Nehemiah 11:1 she's called a harlot a holy city because revelation 7 I'm sorry yeah okay so you see how they have a few similarities right oh here's another one who crucified all the prophets Jerusalem right Jesus said you're the ones who stone the prophets you've done it and then you bury up their bones and you know brother Graham said they did you repents later on so jesus said that no prophet can I think Jesus said no prophet could die outside of Jerusalem if I'm not mistaken I thought he said that there's that connection there to Jerusalem so it looks like Jerusalem is drunken with the blood of the Saints and not only the Saints the Son of God so see it can be quite a little bit confusing there but what were the Holy Spirit's how you do would it tell you just to cruise on that or tell you to dig deeper it keeps crying out God give me more wisdom over my eyes see because you got a hunger and thirst for righteousness and the Bible said you got to search the Scriptures every day whether these things be so a mess because the spirit searches the shallow things no the spirit searches the deep things yea the deep things of God so you know take you deeper than just one or two or three before right now we have four proofs but this mother harlot the real one Roman Catholic Church we gotta proofs for that I'm still searching for the fourth one by there and so you can help me without the one I want to know is how is how officially is Rome connected to all the businesses of the world like the finances now bang and I were talking about this and we were talking about how they might be connected to IMF which is an internet International Monetary Fund so the people that control the value of money they're all Catholics now they might be but I have to find proof of that so if you can find proof of that let me know I just haven't had a lot of time to dig into that one because member in Revelation 18 the cities being destroyed and all the rich people are saying they're you know they're ripping their garments like how is this happening how is this happening this is where we get all of our goods and our money go to the here now that that's the one thing I need to find more evidence on if you can help me out with that or anybody listening you know help me out with that because we know the Vatican has lots of gold we know that but how are they connected to cinnamon and wool and cotton and all those things I'd like to find some good proof on that so if you guys can find that if the brothers or sisters let me know that'd be a great help to me that would give me a 12th one but right now I can't really prove that by what I found in either dictionaries encyclopedias or books I need some more meat on that I need some I need some solid evidence all right so may God grant it because we won't we like to do that so let me finish up now here's the reasons why Israel cannot be wrong I'm sorry Israel cannot be the mother harlot first Israel does not sit upon many waters because met what are many waters they're people's multitudes nations and tongues listen this church I did research here there's only 11 million Jews in the world 11 million and 82 percent of them live in Israel United States 80% of them live in Israel United States compare that to 1.3 billion Catholics billion right 11 million you need you need a how many millions do you need to get a billion 100 is it 100 or is it a thousand hundred okay so that's not even a it's a little over tenth there's no way most of them live in Israel and the United States not even close all around the world but the Roman Catholic Church is in nearly every nation on earth with over 1.3 billion people that's the first thing where Israel Jerusalem cannot be the mother harlot because she doesn't sit on many Hills I'm sorry she doesn't hit on many waters she does sit on Seven Hills not so many waters second Jerusalem has never called Babylon of Scripture whereas Peter refers to Rome as Babylon in first Peter 5:13 did you know that first peter 5:13 let's read it we got a few minutes sir and all the sky I believe this I looked in the commentaries well at least all the godly scholars first Peter 5:13 oh you already got up there good you're fast the church that is at Babylon I'd like to get together with you salute you and so death Marcus much so now all the commentaries say he's writing to the church at Rome there this letter was going to go to Rome and so Peter caught a Babylon and that's something that the Catholic Church calls Peter than their first Pope and there he is calling Rome Babylon there supposedly their first Pope cause names them Babylon so their first Pope rats on them as Babylon that's basically what they're saying but we know Peter was no Pope Peter was a Holy Ghost filled apostle of Jesus Christ amen he wasn't some nonsense Pope all right now also Rome is the legs of iron or mattered modern Babylon like kingdom described in Daniel chapter 2 not Jerusalem because Jerusalem never ruled over the world okay Victoria honey Victoria you keep sit down darling please okay quitar to sit down Victoria sit down then thank you sweetie thank you God showed that to Daniel and God told Daniel that image is gonna come against the holy people amen glory so the legs of iron Babylon or battle on the head I'm sorry Babylon the head it was against Israel it wasn't Israel it wasn't Jerusalem it was against God Daniel's people praise God so see that's another proof third revelation 18 3 requires Babylon have strong relationship to the kings of the earth and eyes with all nations but you and I know Israel is despite despised by almost every nation under heaven and this is what the internet says Israel suffers from bias and discrimination as United Nations you ever seen those videos and the world hates Israel everybody wants to give Palestine the Palestinians the holy man give it the pal give it to those murderers you know the jihad people give it to them don't give it to Israel so that's another proof that it can't be Israel mother Mystery Babylon can't be Israel because this Babylon church is tied to all the nations and you've seen it have you seen that picture where the benedict was kissing the cora remember that or was it John Pope John Paul the second one of them there's a picture where they're kissing or on now no true man of God would kiss that they'd burn that book hate to say that but that's the truth they wouldn't kiss that there you want you wouldn't bless that you would that that's a curse book they say Jesus Christ was not the Son of God he was only a prophet a curse it is any man that doesn't believe Jesus Christ is the son of God the Bible says that let that man me Ana Thema right let him be curse anybody who changes one word of Paul's gospel let him be cursed amen oh my so sad so every hates Israel United Nations but every nation there loves the Vatican and they have diplomats almost every nation under heaven we just saw it was so shocking last year it was so shocking China now recognizes Vatican diplomats as long as the diplomats can be Chinese see that I used to think how is it China ever gonna have Vatican diplomats they hate they hate Catholicism but now it's okay as long as they're Chinese see because they'll know they'll be ever change train them up in their china ways right there Chinese culture and so they'll adopt the China the Catholic things but they'll still keep their Chinese Allegiance in other words in other words they won't be real Catholics right they'll be fake Catholics ok next last one Mystery Babylon is I love this one this a good one Mystery Babylon is condemned in Revelation 1821 let's read that let me pull that up thank you sweetie revelation 18 21 with prophecy that shall never be found or rebuilt after God's wrath destroys look at this the bombs of the mighty angel the Gaston and like a great millstone in Kassadin see say thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down and shall be no more at all so once once Russia drops that bomb on her and then all these all these vials and plagues destroy the Vatican the Bible said shall be no more fountain at all but you know the scripture about Jerusalem amen Lori brother Erin she's fallen so many times her her stones have not been left one upon another but what does she do she keeps rising amen hallelujah and the Bible says that Jerusalem is going to be rebuilt will be a peaceful habitation and will be a future Kingdom in Isaiah 2 Jeremiah three and Isaiah 65 amen how do you know you that mother hearted Roman Catholic Church Vatican will be destroyed and burped and will never be found again but God's holy city the City of God amen will rise again hallelujah and be built again hallelujah it will be the habitation of holiness and only those who are holy will ascend that holy mountain amen thank God in fact Jesus Christ will set up his Millennial throne in Jerusalem see this is before this is before the new city come I'm sorry the new heavens for the future home comes down in the Millennium for a thousand years Jesus Christ is going to set up a new Millennial temple in Jerusalem oh thank God and brother have said the last thing the sixth all purpose of Gabriel's purpose the last thing will be to anoint the most holy that holiest of Holies and what is that going to be it's going to be Jesus Christ sitting down on the throne Haven because he's the most holy and he's the anointing now we don't really need like a Shekinah the glory because we've got Jesus and he's the fullness of the Godhead bodily amen thank you Lord but see the Vatican will be destroyed that'll never rise again thank God for all the evil they've done the sin or feet but Israel no matter what they do no matter what happens in Armageddon when the fires burned and all these things no matter what happens God will rise Jerusalem back up and he'll set up a temple remember the Bible said all every nation everyone ammonium will come in worship in Jerusalem I'll come at this and give allegiance and say this is the temple of the holy God I don't know how to do it I don't know if they'll bow I'm not sure what they'll do but every nations got to come and gather and the Bible said they'll learn holiness from that city glory the Bible said all nations will gather to worship and learn the law of God while the wolf and lamb peacefully feeds together the Bible says oh thank God let me look that up real quick if you got your Bible it's good Isaiah I don't see their Isaiah to Isaiah 65 I think it's 65 it to me when we woke up the wolf and lamb is Isaiah 65 yep thank you 17 let's closer this here what a beautiful promise for behold I create new heavens and a new earth now that's the same thing Peter said remember that in 2nd Peter chapter 3 that's the fire of God the volcanic father or fire the atomic father father fire mercy and yeah the volcanic fire it belches up so fire comes down from heaven and fire comes up from the earth and just burns over everything so God can start all over again no more this trash and nonsense and adultery and fornication and drunkenness and lying and cheating and stealing it'll be a little bit of whole eNOS ain't it thank God for that I love this beautiful the farmer shall not be remembered but there it won't come to our minds glory all these prisons full of all these evil evilness and the strip clubs and the bars and all these things that won't even come because it'll just be holiness amen the law of God the holiness of God will fill the whole earth thank you but I feel like I'm going to shout amen the whole earth will be filled with the Holy Ghost Word of God amen and we'll finish that seventh day that Jesus never got God never got that full seven day because he got interrupted by Satan God said I'm gonna take the seven day and the whole earth is gonna be filled with the knowledge of God and everywhere you go the Bible said they won't need a teacher because God will just teaching the word thank you Lord that's the kind of home I want to live in by there is God it makes me long for heaven doesn't it makes you kind of make something to leave this place like I just want to go to heaven it won't even come to your mind Church so all those times people all the times me were rejected yeah it won't come to mind anymore because Jesus is there he's the only thing on our minds hahaha amen King Jesus 18 but be glad to rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create aresome or rejoicing and their people a joy Babylon can't be Jerusalem because Jesus said I create Jerusalem oh thank you Lord they see she's gonna be found again she had me found in the same place and she's gonna be a joy her people are gonna be joy and I'll rejoice in where Jerusalem and joy my people and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard her like the weeping wall right they cry and say God return to your people save your people deliver your people nor the voice of crying there shall be no more than sin infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die a hundred years old now that's what we've been taught he can't explain it I can't either but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be cursed I can't explain that either because member there's gonna be sinners but they're not gonna sin right they're not gonna sit in til the end of the millennium right when Satan's let loose and he deceives them and they all gather against Israel against rusev so they're gonna have like sin nature in him about the Satan's not gonna be there to tempt them and there'll be no sin but God's eyes they're still sinners because they're gonna betray Christ I like this well I can't wait to do this because I never built a house in my life verse 21 and they shall build houses
