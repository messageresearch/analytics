[0:42] together here by God's grace. We'll kind
[0:43] of pick up there as the Lord allows.
[0:45] Let's read verse nine. Ready? 1 2 3. To
[0:48] another faith by the same spirit. To
[0:51] another the gifts of healing by the same
[0:54] spirit. May God add his blessing to the
[0:56] reading of his word. You may be seated
[0:57] by God's
[1:00] grace. So, we'll take this text here
[1:02] tonight and we'll keep preaching on 1
[1:04] Corinthians 12. Hallelujah. It's good
[1:06] being house of the Lord tonight. God is
[1:08] good. Amen. Hallelujah. Trust
[1:10] everybody's had a good week in the Lord
[1:12] so far. Uh no real updates on anything.
[1:15] Just thankful baby's growing good and uh
[1:18] Naomi's baby's doing great. Everybody's
[1:20] doing good. So, we're thankful for God's
[1:21] love. Hallelujah. So, uh if you would,
[1:24] Hunt, we'll switch over here. I got a
[1:25] few slides. We'll just uh pick up where
[1:27] we left off
[1:29] there. And I hope this is good uh for
[1:32] the church to kind of look at your own
[1:33] life a little bit and see which gifts of
[1:35] the spirit you have operating in your
[1:37] life. Uh remember uh you know a gift
[1:40] could operate one time in your life and
[1:41] then maybe never again or it may just be
[1:44] a repeated gift or you could have
[1:45] multiple gifts used in your life. We see
[1:48] that with the preaching gifts. You know
[1:49] there's five preaching gifts and we saw
[1:51] St. Paul was a teacher to the gent
[1:53] gentiles. He was an apostle. Uh history
[1:55] says he was the first pastor at Ephesus.
[1:58] He was no doubt a prophet of God. Uh and
[2:01] uh so he fulfilled all five. Oh yeah. He
[2:03] did the work of evangelist with
[2:04] Barnabas. He said, "Hey, let's gather.
[2:06] Let's go visit all the churches we
[2:07] started. Let's go visit our brethren
[2:09] again. See how they do." So we can see
[2:11] that Paul had all five preaching gifts.
[2:13] And brother Brandham said the history he
[2:15] read on Martin Luther uh said that
[2:17] Martin Luther had all nine spiritual
[2:19] gifts as well. He had preaching gifts,
[2:21] but he also had the nine gifts of the
[2:23] Holy Spirit. So we're picking up here
[2:25] right in the seventh section by
[2:26] Scofield. This is Scofield's dividing of
[2:28] the of the book, brother 1 Corinthians.
[2:31] Uh so we're picking up here uh verse uh
[2:34] chapter 12 here by God's grace. So uh we
[2:37] look I I've seen so far in this book
[2:39] I've seen three, four, five, six, seven
[2:42] uh awful sins that Paul had to clean up.
[2:45] There was division about who was the
[2:47] best preacher and which camp had the
[2:48] best preacher. Uh then there was sexual
[2:50] immorality. uh a man was sleeping with
[2:53] his stepmother and then they were suing
[2:56] each other and then they had drunkenness
[2:58] at communion and they had pride in their
[3:01] financial superiority. The rich people
[3:03] would eat before communion and wouldn't
[3:05] wouldn't allow the poor people to come
[3:07] in. Uh and then of course uh they had
[3:10] spiritual gifts out of order. So that's
[3:12] where we're getting into now. We'll see
[3:13] the order of it in chapter 14 uh
[3:16] probably in a few weeks here. And then
[3:18] they lacked generosity especially to
[3:19] Paul. They weren't ready to give to the
[3:21] preacher Paul. Paul was the one that
[3:23] needed uh financial assistance and uh
[3:26] they weren't ready uh to give it to him.
[3:28] And Paul pointed it out that they
[3:30] weren't very generous. So think about
[3:31] that. They were rich but not very
[3:33] generous. Ever meet anybody like that?
[3:35] Right? Uh and so if we don't have a lot
[3:38] of money, let's still be generous
[3:39] anyway. Hallelujah. Because God loves a
[3:42] cheerful giver. Hallelujah. Amen. And
[3:45] then uh he said in the second book uh
[3:48] that they allowed too many false
[3:50] teachers and he says you got to get back
[3:52] to your spiritual fathers like St. Paul
[3:54] and so forth. So let's pick up here. You
[3:56] know the last two services we've been
[3:58] looking at the nine gifts of the Holy
[3:59] Spirit. Let's review the first three. Uh
[4:01] Sunday we looked at wisdom, knowledge,
[4:03] and faith. Tonight we'll see how far we
[4:05] can get in here. The nine gifts of the
[4:07] Holy Spirit.
[4:09] Uh now I'll preach it maybe uh Sunday
[4:11] maybe I'll preach how all these were in
[4:13] the Old Testament as well. So we can go
[4:15] to the Old Testament and find all nine
[4:17] gifts of the Holy Spirit in the Old
[4:19] Testament. So it' be pretty wonderful to
[4:21] see that
[4:22] u uh to so you can see how they uh it's
[4:25] the same yesterday, today and forever,
[4:27] right? Jesus is the same yesterday,
[4:28] today and forever. These nine gifts were
[4:30] always there and uh and God just here
[4:33] kind of uh we say organizes them through
[4:36] St. Paul. Hallelujah. So it's really
[4:38] wonderful to see it. Now we looked at uh
[4:41] uh the word of wisdom in the Greek. It
[4:43] means the skill in managing your
[4:45] affairs. So it's timely choices, right?
[4:47] It's sound advice to do things at the
[4:49] right time. Uh we know Rod's looking for
[4:51] this, right? For whether he's going to
[4:53] move or not, right, brother? This is
[4:54] kind of what he's looking for, right?
[4:56] He's looking for wisdom, the right time
[4:58] and season. Should he do it? Should he
[4:59] not? You know, where should he go? Uh so
[5:02] that's a situation where you need the
[5:04] wisdom of God, right? the right time in
[5:06] the right season. And it's it's declared
[5:08] through works and actions. It tells you
[5:10] what to do with your Bible knowledge
[5:12] because wisdom builds the house. The
[5:14] material is like the knowledge, but the
[5:15] wisdom is how you build. And then a wise
[5:18] man builds his house upon the rock.
[5:19] Brother Ram said wisdom is the best gift
[5:22] of the group. Amen. Hallelujah. Most of
[5:24] us would think uh tongues or
[5:25] interpretation or prophecy, but wisdom
[5:28] is the best of all of them. Praise God.
[5:30] Because wisdom manages all the other
[5:31] ones. Now, I put there's a few more
[5:33] Bible examples. Jesus said, "Give Caesar
[5:36] what's Caesars's and God's what's
[5:38] God's." Right? That was a word of
[5:39] wisdom. Brother Chris
[5:51] probably you'd get the reward for it.
[5:52] Yes. As long as you were faithful. Yeah.
[5:54] Yeah. Very good, brother. Yes, sir.
[5:56] Yeah. Uh the Bible said every good work
[5:57] will receive a reward. And the only way
[6:00] someone wouldn't is if they uh they
[6:02] brought reproach upon the gospel. Uh and
[6:04] that's in 1 Corinthians 3 says you can
[6:06] lose all your reward but still be saved
[6:09] if you don't build if you don't build
[6:10] your life upon the foundation of the
[6:12] apostles. Paul says you can lose your
[6:14] whole reward. That's like Lot, right?
[6:16] Lot had a family right there in Sodom.
[6:18] But it got all got burnt and all he had
[6:20] left was two daughters and look what
[6:22] happened. They had incest and it really
[6:24] he lost all of his reward. But look at
[6:26] Abraham out there. He never went into
[6:27] Sodom. He had a great reward. He's
[6:29] called the father of faith. Great
[6:30] question. Let's give him two claps.
[6:32] Hallelujah. So Jesus gave a word of
[6:34] wisdom, right? He said, "Give to Caesar
[6:36] what's Caesars's. Give to God's what's
[6:38] God's." Right? They were trying to put
[6:39] them on either side. But wisdom said the
[6:42] right thing at the right time. Told them
[6:44] what to do. Uh the wise virgins
[6:46] realized, "Oh, I better prepare extra
[6:48] oil in case the bridegroom terries."
[6:50] Right? It was foolish just go run out
[6:52] there and say, "I'll just take a little
[6:54] bit of oil. I'm sure he'll be here
[6:55] soon." No. Wisdom tells you prepare just
[6:58] in case, right? And I know Rod's a good
[7:00] planner for trips. So Rod's got a lot of
[7:02] wisdom for planning trips. He prepared
[7:05] extra tea and extra food and extra
[7:08] snacks. So that's a wise thing to do,
[7:10] right? Well, just in case something
[7:11] happens. In other words, let me have a
[7:13] backup plan by God's grace, right?
[7:15] That's what the wise virgin, they're
[7:16] called wise for that purpose. They
[7:19] prepared extra oil just in case. And
[7:22] then Paul shared his beliefs with uh the
[7:24] I'm sorry, beliefs of the resurrection
[7:25] in Acts 23. That saved his life. He knew
[7:29] that he knew he could divide this angry
[7:30] mob if he just said something about the
[7:32] resurrection because some of them
[7:33] believed in the resurrection, some of
[7:35] them didn't. So with that wisdom, it
[7:37] spared his life. Hallelujah. And then I
[7:40] told you Sunday about the two words of
[7:41] wisdom I gave to different brothers. One
[7:43] brother was under condemnation. I gave
[7:45] him a word of wisdom about his
[7:46] extracurricular activities. And then the
[7:49] other brother was going to quit that
[7:51] morning uh quit preaching. And I I
[7:53] preached on uh diligence and investing
[7:55] in your gifts. And he said that was a
[7:57] word of wisdom to him. And now he's more
[7:59] busy preaching than ever before. Praise
[8:01] God. Uh so I'm going to just review
[8:03] these are review. Uh knowledge was a
[8:05] deep understanding of the word of God,
[8:08] especially what's lawful or what's right
[8:10] or sinful for Christians. Jesus said
[8:13] knowledge is a key. Uh and the Pharisees
[8:16] had the key of knowledge. They had the
[8:18] key. In other words, they had the
[8:19] scripture. They could have got people
[8:21] saved, but Jesus said, uh, you weren't
[8:23] pointing them to him. So, he said, you
[8:25] were keeping yourselves out of that door
[8:27] of salvation and also everyone that was
[8:29] hearing you. So, uh, uh, knowledge is a
[8:33] key. It opens a door. Hallelujah. And
[8:36] allows you to enter into something and
[8:38] escape sin. And, Brother Brandham said,
[8:40] knowledge is like you know the Bible,
[8:42] you study the Bible, and you know
[8:43] scriptures that will open doors for
[8:46] people. Hallelujah. And that's exactly
[8:47] what we saw in the scripture. Uh how it
[8:50] opened doors uh helps you to escape sin.
[8:52] Knowledge that helps you escape sin. The
[8:54] Bible says
[8:56] hallelujah. Uh some good examples were
[8:59] Peter and Philip. They gave scriptural
[9:00] knowledge of Joel 2:28 in Acts chapter
[9:03] 2. And uh Philip gave the knowledge of
[9:06] Isaiah 53 to the Ethiopian in Acts
[9:09] chapter 8. And it opened doors of
[9:11] salvation. People got saved when they
[9:13] shared that knowledge. Praise God. So we
[9:15] can see knowledge opens doors.
[9:17] Hallelujah. And then uh this you
[9:19] probably remember this testimony. A
[9:21] brother called me up and he was all been
[9:23] out of shape. There was a man in his
[9:25] church who was saying uh you can't be a
[9:27] deacon and a preacher. And this guy
[9:30] later died of cancer because he he gave
[9:32] a false prophecy in the name of the
[9:33] Lord. And God took him off the earth at
[9:35] a very young age. He wouldn't repent of
[9:37] that. That man, he was a false prophet.
[9:40] He stood up there and said, "Thus sayith
[9:41] the Lord, I'm supposed to be pastor
[9:42] here." and he got cancer a few years
[9:44] later and died unrepentant. That was
[9:47] just in Pennsylvania. That's not very
[9:48] far away. God doesn't play around with
[9:50] his word. Hallelujah. Anyways, there was
[9:53] a man at that church and he he was all
[9:55] broke up about it because this false
[9:56] prophet was uh criticizing him and
[9:58] saying, "You can't be a deacon and a and
[10:00] a preacher." And I got off the phone. I
[10:02] said, "Okay, brother. I'll pray for
[10:04] you." And I told my wife about it, you
[10:06] know, not the not the person, but I just
[10:07] told her about the situation. And my
[10:09] wife said, "Philip was a deacon and
[10:11] evangelist."
[10:12] Like that's the first thing out of her
[10:13] mouth. I'm like, "Ah, that's right.
[10:15] That's the understanding. There's
[10:17] there's the key." So I called the
[10:19] brother back up. He started crying.
[10:20] Said, "Thank you. Now I'm free." It
[10:22] opened up the door of his understanding.
[10:24] And now he could go through the door of
[10:26] having a ministry as a deacon and a
[10:28] preacher.
[10:29] Very good. Very. That's a word of
[10:31] knowledge. Remember all these nine are
[10:33] male, male or female. And the sisters
[10:35] can all say, "Amen." Amen. So sisters
[10:38] can have wisdom. Sisters can have
[10:41] knowledge. Sisters can have all the
[10:43] other seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.
[10:45] Now, sisters can't have the five
[10:46] preaching gifts because that's for men
[10:47] only. Men are leaders of the church,
[10:49] right? Paul says that I never suffered a
[10:51] woman to teach or assurp authority above
[10:53] a man. Uh because Eve fell in the
[10:55] beginning handling the word of God.
[10:57] Okay? And so, uh now let's move on to
[10:59] faith. We look we ended with faith on
[11:01] Sunday. Faith is a conviction of
[11:03] anything, a belief. And the Bible says
[11:05] it's a substance. So when you have the
[11:07] gift of faith, it's like God puts
[11:08] something inside of you. And you can
[11:10] prove it because it's inside of you. You
[11:13] can't prove it what you see. You prove
[11:14] it with what's inside your heart, right?
[11:17] It's a substance of things hoped for,
[11:19] the evidence of things not seen. How do
[11:21] you know? I just know. God let me know.
[11:24] God put faith in my heart. Hallelujah.
[11:27] And then the Bible says it's it's the
[11:29] the proof of God's will. Jesus said,
[11:32] "And it moves mountains and makes all
[11:34] things
[11:35] possible."
[11:37] Okay, brother Ram said that's a gift of
[11:39] faith. They believe they're going to
[11:42] receive what they ask for.
[11:44] Hallelujah. So, we we saw here uh here's
[11:47] a few Bible examples that the sinceran
[11:49] said, "Jesus, you don't have to come to
[11:51] my house to pray for my servant. Just
[11:53] speak the word and I know it'll be
[11:55] done." And Jesus said, "I haven't seen
[11:57] this great a faith in all of Israel."
[11:59] Praise God. Right? See, because he knew,
[12:01] he had faith. If you just speak the
[12:03] word, I'm going to receive it.
[12:05] Hallelujah. So, he had great faith. And
[12:07] then Paul saw the crippled man's faith
[12:09] there. There was something about his the
[12:11] way that crippled man was looking at
[12:12] Paul and Paul just raised up and said,
[12:14] "I pronounce you healed in the name of
[12:15] Jesus Christ." And a man who was
[12:16] crippled got up and leaped and walked
[12:18] and praised God. Hallelujah. That was in
[12:21] Lystra. So, that man had faith. He had a
[12:24] gift of faith to know he was going to
[12:26] get healed. Praise God.
[12:29] And then I told you, you know, uh, last
[12:31] or back in April, remember we prayed on
[12:33] a Wednesday night and sister Naomi was
[12:34] screaming and shouting and and, uh, the
[12:36] Holy Ghost dropped down amongst us. And
[12:38] she said after that, she said, "The
[12:40] doctor's not going to have to move
[12:42] Tulsi." She said, "Uh, the doctor's not
[12:45] going to have to do it when you go to
[12:46] the doctor." That's quite a statement to
[12:48] say because last time God had to move
[12:50] Zion or I'm sorry, the doctor had to
[12:51] move Zion so Zion could be born the
[12:53] right way. So that was quite a thing to
[12:55] say, right? And how how do you know? You
[12:57] just know.
[12:58] just she just believed. And then uh the
[13:01] the the Saturday before we went to see
[13:02] the doctor, a midwife come over and she
[13:04] confirmed, "Oh yes, the baby's already
[13:06] moved." So we already had a vindication
[13:08] going there. And as soon as the doctor
[13:10] got that ultrasound on there, he's like,
[13:11] "Oh, see you later." He just had to find
[13:14] the head. Oh, she's already head down.
[13:15] See you later. Doctor didn't have to
[13:17] move it. Praise God. Because faith moves
[13:20] mountains. Hallelujah. That's right. And
[13:23] then uh brother Jose and I years ago
[13:25] were at one of his uh family's house and
[13:28] they wanted to have children. This
[13:29] couple, young couple couldn't have
[13:31] children. The doctor said they could
[13:32] have children. And we sang a little
[13:33] song. We probably sang only believe or
[13:35] Amazing Grace. And everybody's crying
[13:37] and Jose looked at him while before we
[13:39] left and we're crying and Jose said,
[13:41] "You're going to have a child." And I
[13:42] was really nervous in that moment. But
[13:44] Jose had faith. God had heard our
[13:46] prayers. And then nine months later, the
[13:49] baby was born on my birthday. Amen. So,
[13:52] God has a sense of humor. Praise
[13:54] God. I didn't say it. Jose said it, but
[13:56] it was born on my birthday. So, bless
[13:58] that little boy. I He's probably about
[14:00] seven or eight by now. And then uh uh I
[14:04] went to a Bible study with a a teacher.
[14:06] She was a
[14:07] coworker and she told me about this
[14:09] problem. She knew I was a preacher and
[14:10] she said, "You know, my husband and I,
[14:12] we've been married all these years. We
[14:13] can't have any children." And I said,
[14:15] "Well, hey, let's have a Bible study on
[14:16] that." So, we had a Bible study, maybe
[14:18] an hour. I went through all the verses
[14:20] on women that were barren and how God
[14:22] heals the barren womb. And then I went
[14:24] to a second Bible study and I and we
[14:26] studied more on the scripture and uh I I
[14:30] made the point where uh uh where Jesus
[14:33] said if you don't clean out the house uh
[14:35] demons will come in your house but if
[14:37] you clean out and you don't fill with
[14:38] the Holy Ghost then that demon will
[14:41] bring seven more. And I said you got to
[14:43] make sure you think the right thoughts
[14:44] about this. And somebody, a woman popped
[14:47] up in that uh Bible study and said,
[14:48] "You're wrong, Jesse. That that I just
[14:50] held my peace." I'm like, "Okay, we'll
[14:52] see." I just held my peace. I'm rebuked
[14:55] by a woman in front of these people. And
[14:57] a few days later, I was praying and
[14:59] something come over me and I said, "I
[15:01] speak to that uh barrenness. I speak to
[15:03] the mountain of barrenness. It's going
[15:05] to move in the name of Jesus Christ."
[15:07] Amen. I didn't plan to say it, but I
[15:09] walked upstairs later. I told my wife, I
[15:10] said, "I think I just spoke that this
[15:13] woman's going to have they're going to
[15:14] have a child." And they had no evidence
[15:15] they were going to have children. And
[15:17] then a few days later, I got a text and
[15:19] they got the pregnancy uh test on there.
[15:22] We're
[15:23] pregnant. And then they had a baby girl.
[15:25] And then I I saw her. She had a baby
[15:26] girl. She said, "I had a dream about you
[15:28] and we were going to have more
[15:30] children." I said, "Oh, okay. Praise the
[15:32] Lord." I just prayed for her. And next
[15:34] time I saw her, third time I saw her,
[15:36] she said, "My dream came to pass and I
[15:39] just had
[15:39] twins." I said, 'I don't know why I'm
[15:42] connected to your babies. I don't know.
[15:44] I didn't ask to be, but I guess just But
[15:47] that was a faith. I just spoke it and I
[15:49] believed it was going to happen. Praise
[15:51] God. But it wasn't my faith. It's God's
[15:53] faith. All any supernatural is God's
[15:56] power. Hallelujah. It's not our power.
[15:58] It's God's power. Now, new for tonight,
[16:00] let's look at gifts of healing. I guess
[16:01] we kind of looked at it uh a little bit
[16:04] on on yeah Sunday. In the Greek, healing
[16:07] means uh a means of prayer, laying on of
[16:10] hands of healing, remedy, or
[16:13] medicine. So, let's go through these. Uh
[16:15] brother Austin, you got a Bible there?
[16:16] Sister Lena, you got a Bible? Okay,
[16:17] Malachi. Malachi, why don't you get Acts
[16:19] 14:9? Brotherh, you want to get Acts
[16:22] 10:38? Sister Lena, you want to get Acts
[16:24] I'm sorry, you want to get Matthew 88.
[16:26] No, I'm sorry. You want to get Luke
[16:28] 22:51. Sorry, sister. And then Haven,
[16:31] you want to get Matthew 8:8. Victoria,
[16:33] could you get 2 Kings
[16:36] 20:7? Now, there's all kinds of gifts of
[16:38] healing all through the Bible anytime.
[16:40] And we know lots of people got healed in
[16:41] the scripture, right? Especially in the
[16:43] ministry of the Lord Jesus. But we want
[16:45] to look at some of these uh to kind of
[16:47] show the difference. The main thing is
[16:49] to know the difference between healing
[16:50] and
[16:51] miracles. That's the main thing to know.
[16:53] It's fair fairly simple once you just
[16:55] once you hear it preached. But there's a
[16:57] difference between healing and miracles.
[17:00] Hallelujah. So, uh, Malachi, let's read
[17:03] Acts 14:9. Faith is required for healing
[17:06] no matter how long it takes to manifest.
[17:15] All right? So, see, faith was required
[17:18] to be healed for the gift of healing.
[17:20] Right? A person has to believe so they
[17:22] can be healed. Right? All right. Now, uh
[17:26] Austin, you want to get uh Acts 10:38?
[17:40] Amen. So healing is the deliverance or
[17:43] the sending away of the oppression of
[17:45] the devil. Now the word devil means
[17:47] tormentor. So anytime somebody has
[17:49] torment in their body, right? It's a
[17:52] devil, right? And so uh healing casts
[17:56] out the devil, right? And that's what
[17:59] Jesus did. He had the anointing to cast
[18:02] off evil spirits to deliver the people
[18:05] through the spirit of God. Hallelujah.
[18:08] Now, healing comes through many means
[18:09] such as laying on of hands. So, Haven,
[18:11] you want to read that? Uh, Luke 22:51.
[18:14] I'm sorry, Selena. Yes, thank you,
[18:15] sister. Sorry.
[18:21] Amen. He touched. See, he touched. So,
[18:23] sometimes it takes a healing touch.
[18:25] Praise God. All right. Now, uh, Haven,
[18:28] sometimes it's speaking the word.
[18:30] Matthew 8:8, Haven,
[18:40] Okay. So, the servant was healed after
[18:42] the word was spoken, right? Hallelujah.
[18:46] And then it could be natural remedies as
[18:48] well. So, God could anoint somebody uh
[18:50] to get the right medicines, right?
[18:52] Herbs, natural things and give that to a
[18:55] person and God could use the natural
[18:57] means to heal as well. So, Victoria, you
[18:59] want to read that? 2 Kings 20:7.
[19:09] Amen. Praise God. So, there's at least
[19:11] three ways. There's probably there's
[19:13] probably a lot more than that, but
[19:14] there's three ways healing comes. Laying
[19:16] on of hands, speaking the word, and then
[19:19] natural remedies. God can heal that way.
[19:22] Hallelujah. And brother Ram said there's
[19:24] no such thing as the gift of healing
[19:26] because it's in the plural. It's gifts
[19:28] of healing. So God works in many
[19:31] different ways to heal the sick. Well,
[19:33] that's right. Yeah. Now I'm thinking of
[19:35] miracles, but yeah. Okay. So let's look
[19:38] at the working of miracles now. So
[19:40] miracle is faith in the powerful
[19:43] performing miracles. Now here's the
[19:46] difference between healing and miracles.
[19:48] Miracles are
[19:50] instantaneous. Happen right now. That
[19:52] that's that's a miracle when it breaks
[19:55] the natural laws of nature. Right? And a
[19:58] miracle is something that just happens
[20:00] instantly. God drops down, does a
[20:02] miracle. It's a spontaneous
[20:04] manifestation of
[20:06] healing. Uh whereas healing uh the gift
[20:09] of healing might take time to heal,
[20:12] right? It might take time uh might take
[20:15] weeks or days or months or years even to
[20:17] be healed. Uh but miracles are
[20:21] instantaneous. So let's uh maybe have
[20:23] some more readers. Uh brother Claude and
[20:24] Patrick, do you feel okay reading
[20:26] tonight?
[20:27] Brother Chris, do you feel okay reading?
[20:29] Brother Rod, you want to read? Would
[20:30] that be okay? Got you. Bible. Oh, okay.
[20:32] Lydia, you feel okay reading? All right.
[20:34] Glory. Let's read that. Let's start
[20:36] there with uh Brother Claude, you want
[20:38] to get Mark 652? Patrick, do you want to
[20:40] get Mark
[20:42] 9:39? Brother Chris, do you want to get
[20:44] John
[20:45] 2:11? And then uh Brother Rod, John
[20:50] 4:50-54. You got the long one, brother.
[20:53] Can you do John 4 50 through 54? And
[20:56] then Lydia, could you do John 12
[21:02] 17-18? All right. So, miracles are
[21:04] instant spontaneous manifestations of
[21:07] healing. Jesus did miracles frequently
[21:09] such as multiplying loaves. So, Brother
[21:12] Claude, you got that one? Mark 6:52.
[21:26] Amen. The miracle of the loaves. Very
[21:28] good, brother. The miracle of the
[21:29] loaves. That's a miracle. Spontaneous
[21:31] multiplication of fish and bread. It's a
[21:35] miracle. All right. Uh, brother Patrick,
[21:37] you want to get uh casting out devils is
[21:39] a miracle. And I've seen that about
[21:41] about seven occasions. Uh, Mark uh 9:39.
[21:45] Brother, you want to read that?
[22:01] Amen. Now, in the context, Jesus' 12
[22:04] disciples are like like, "Lord, there's
[22:06] another man casting out devils. Should
[22:08] we forbid him?" And Jesus is like, "No,
[22:10] if he's doing miracles, then he's
[22:12] speaking good things about me." Right?
[22:13] He's only he's saying good things by the
[22:15] spirit of God, right? Because uh no man
[22:17] can curse Jesus uh by the spirit of God,
[22:20] right? The spirit of God will not curse
[22:22] Jesus, right? All right. Very good. So,
[22:25] multiplying loaves, casting out devils.
[22:27] Brother Chris, you want to get uh John
[22:29] 2:11.
[22:39] Amen. Praise God. Remember when brother
[22:41] Digs was here, he said a brother told
[22:43] him about a miracle where he ran out of
[22:44] gas. He poured the water into the gas
[22:47] tank and started up and drove
[22:50] home. That that's his testimony. Not did
[22:53] Brother Digs, but a man Brother Diggs
[22:55] knows. Okay. And he had remember had a
[22:57] wife and children at home and it was in
[22:59] the middle of the night. That was quite
[23:00] a testimony.
[23:02] Cars don't run on water last time I
[23:04] checked. Not even Virginia water,
[23:08] brother. But yeah, that's a that's an
[23:10] absolute miracle, right? change one
[23:12] substance into another substance. Water
[23:15] to wine or water to gasoline. Uh curing
[23:18] a boy with life-threatening fever.
[23:20] Brother Rod, you want to read that one?
[23:21] John 4:50-54.
[23:23] Yes. Jesus saith unto him, "Go thy way,
[23:26] thy
[23:29] son." Jesus had
[23:35] spoken down.
[23:42] of
[23:50] them. So the father knew that it was at
[23:53] the same
[24:02] hour. Could you read 542, brother?
[24:12] Amen. Thank you, brother. So, when
[24:14] someone's at death's door, we'd say, and
[24:17] then they're miraculously brought back
[24:19] to life and completely healed, that's a
[24:21] miracle, right? We all have fevers,
[24:23] right? But none of us have been on
[24:24] death's door with a fever, as far as I
[24:26] know, right? My children, we all take
[24:28] turns having fevers, right? When you got
[24:30] nine kids, you just take turns. But this
[24:33] was a life-threatening. And the Bible
[24:34] said this is the second miracle that
[24:36] Jesus did after the water to wine. Okay?
[24:40] So when someone's about ready to die,
[24:42] but they get a supernatural
[24:43] breakthrough, supernatural healing,
[24:45] that's a miracle. Praise God. And then
[24:47] the raising of the dead back to life.
[24:48] Lydia.
[25:01] Amen. Wonderful. So another one uh um
[25:04] raising from the dead are miracles. All
[25:07] right. Now, brother says it like this.
[25:09] Maybe you might not have that
[25:11] spontaneous faith to bring something
[25:13] just a miracle right to you. You may not
[25:16] have that kind of faith. So I just want
[25:19] to show the difference between divine
[25:20] healing and miracles. And church, it's
[25:23] okay if you don't have uh faith for
[25:25] miracles. You're not saved by miracles.
[25:28] You're saved by grace. Amen. And
[25:30] remember, like I said Sunday, don't ever
[25:32] put gifts above salvation or anything,
[25:36] right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Never put gifts
[25:39] above love. Amen. Right. Because if you
[25:42] start going to seek gifts and don't have
[25:44] love, you're going to hurt yourself and
[25:45] other people. You're going to do damage
[25:47] to people, right? Like I told you that
[25:50] one from North Carolina where the girl
[25:52] felt she had a word from the Lord. Uh
[25:54] she tried to steal the microphone away
[25:56] from the preacher.
[25:58] Uh, and it did damage to the the I mean
[26:01] it it's like the Holy Spirit was just
[26:03] grieved and just it was we just ended
[26:04] service right there. I mean Mali
[26:07] probably remembers, maybe Lydia
[26:08] remembers. I mean the whole altar,
[26:10] everyone in the church was at the altar
[26:12] weeping and crying and this girl broke
[26:14] through to try to take and it just it
[26:16] ruined the whole
[26:18] atmosphere. It just it grieved the Holy
[26:20] Spirit because it wasn't operating by
[26:23] love. She was operating out of fear.
[26:25] Maybe there was jealousy. whatever it
[26:27] was, she didn't want her friend to court
[26:29] that certain boy. And back, like I said,
[26:31] back in the office, she repented and
[26:33] said, "I had the wrong spirit. Forgive
[26:34] me. The devil got on me." I said, "Well,
[26:36] that's a real Christian. At least she
[26:37] could repent of that." Praise God. We
[26:39] all got to be honest and repent if we're
[26:41] led by the wrong spirit, an evil spirit.
[26:43] I thought that was a real admiral. You
[26:45] know, she had her head down crying the
[26:46] whole time. That was real humility. But
[26:49] see, she didn't have it operating by
[26:50] love. If it would have been by love, she
[26:52] would have said, "Preacher, could I
[26:54] please speak this?" And if she if a
[26:57] preacher would have said no, she would
[26:58] have said, "Okay, I'll wait till later."
[27:00] But she wanted to out be out in front of
[27:01] everybody and take control and take the
[27:03] mic and try to just try to take over the
[27:07] service. And so that was selfish, right?
[27:10] It wasn't filled with love. And for some
[27:12] reason, she wanted to do it publicly
[27:13] rather than
[27:14] privately. Now, there are times for
[27:16] public rebukes, right? We just went
[27:18] through it, you know, back in February,
[27:20] we had to go through a public rebuke.
[27:22] But all that could have been handled
[27:23] before, but people won't meet, right?
[27:25] They won't they won't accept the
[27:26] one-on-one or the group, right? It all
[27:28] could have been handled differently. But
[27:30] Jesus gave us all the directions on what
[27:32] to do. Jesus showed us how to operate by
[27:35] love. Hallelujah. Amen. That's right.
[27:37] That's right. Amen. Now, I didn't get to
[27:40] that one, so uh we'll have to move on. I
[27:43] didn't get to I was going to show some
[27:44] more
[27:45] examples. Now, um look what brother Ram
[27:48] says. This is interesting.
[27:51] Uh Brother Ram said, "I have no control
[27:53] of miracles. My gift is not miracles. My
[27:55] gift is healing. All of you understand
[27:57] that, don't you? There's nine spiritual
[27:59] gifts. But many times, the angel of God
[28:01] will perform miracles. So, this is a
[28:03] little deeper thought here. Like every
[28:06] prophet, Brother Random had an angel
[28:08] that was with him throughout his entire
[28:09] life. Moses had an angel. I think it was
[28:13] Exodus 32, if I'm not mistaken. That
[28:15] angel was with Moses his whole life.
[28:18] Paul had an angel that was with him his
[28:20] whole life. Right? And so, Brother Ram
[28:23] had an angel. So, it's very interesting.
[28:25] The angel said, "You have a gift of
[28:27] healing, but uh when the people could
[28:30] receive God's word, the angel would do
[28:32] miracles." And that's scriptural, too,
[28:34] because the angels came and ministered
[28:35] to Jesus. And remember, the angel
[28:38] troubled the waters. There it is. Amen.
[28:40] In the book of John, the angel troubled
[28:41] the water. Praise God. Amen. That's
[28:44] that's fresh to me. Amen. Praise God. I
[28:46] never thought about that. Hallelujah.
[28:50] So see, just just pleasing the Lord,
[28:51] just creating a good atmosphere could
[28:53] cause angels to do miracles here
[28:55] tonight.
[28:57] Hallelujah.
[28:59] Amen. But I said, maybe you might not
[29:01] have that spontaneous faith to bring
[29:03] something just a miracle right to you.
[29:05] You may not have that kind of faith, but
[29:06] Jesus said if you had faith like a
[29:08] mustard seed, you could say to the
[29:09] mountain, "Be moved by and by, it would
[29:11] come to pass." It wouldn't vanish it
[29:13] away, but by and by it would come to
[29:16] pass. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to go
[29:18] to the next one. Now, some people have
[29:20] faith like this. Some has that much,
[29:22] some has that much. And some can go plum
[29:24] over their heads in miracles. But
[29:27] because you haven't got that much, that
[29:28] doesn't mean you can't be healed. If you
[29:31] have the least little bit of faith, you
[29:33] just stay right with it. It'll take you
[29:34] out. Will you believe that? That's the
[29:36] truth. God will make me answer for it.
[29:38] If I haven't told you the truth, can you
[29:40] accept it now on the basis of God's
[29:42] must? He must have stopped his sentence
[29:44] right there. Okay. But can you see that
[29:46] everybody has a portion of a gift right?
[29:49] In the Bible Jesus talked about you can
[29:51] have five talents, two talents or one
[29:52] talent. And a talent in in one in one
[29:55] sense is money but another sense is a
[29:58] spiritual ability. It's a spiritual
[30:00] portion of a gift that God had God has
[30:02] allowed to you. So some people now
[30:05] church we just got to make sure we just
[30:07] don't get jealous of people. Right? If
[30:09] somebody has more like as a preacher for
[30:11] me it's the devil tries to tempt me and
[30:13] say well see your church isn't as big as
[30:15] others and you can't preach like that
[30:17] preacher and the devil try to get me to
[30:19] be jealous but I don't get jealous I'm
[30:20] just happy for him. I'm just content
[30:23] because all I can do is just what God
[30:25] gave me. Praise God. If I pray, repent,
[30:28] study, uh fast, if I do if I do my part,
[30:30] God will do his part. Praise God. I've
[30:32] learned that over the course of uh I've
[30:34] been preaching since 2020 or 2004. I've
[30:38] learned that okay over the course of 21
[30:40] years of preaching. Praise God. I just
[30:42] learned that. I'm just thankful you I
[30:43] want to I want to I I I say amen for
[30:46] brother Digs just as loud as I preach,
[30:49] right? Or Brother Brian Hawkins. I No,
[30:51] now I actually I better correct that.
[30:53] I'm not allowed to be as as loud because
[30:55] I don't want to hurt people's ears. My
[30:57] wife says, Jesse, sometimes you clap too
[30:59] loud. So over the years I've actually
[31:00] clapped less loud because I don't want
[31:04] to hurt people's ears in this tiny
[31:05] little room.
[31:08] See? So, I got Let me correct that. I
[31:11] used to clap really, really loud in
[31:12] here, but it got too loud. People let me
[31:14] know I was too loud. So, I said, "Okay,
[31:16] let me calm it down a little bit." Now,
[31:18] when I preach, I am a little louder, but
[31:20] just let me know if you want me to calm
[31:21] it down. Uh, but the point is uh we I
[31:26] call there's five talent preachers,
[31:28] there's two talent preachers, there's
[31:30] one talent preacher. Now, I don't know.
[31:31] Are there four and three talent people?
[31:33] I don't know. But Jesus gives us 52 and
[31:35] one in the Bible. So I'm just going to
[31:37] stay with that. Praise God. I could be
[31:39] wrong. There could be 54 321 talents. I
[31:42] don't know. But everybody has a measure
[31:44] of faith.
[31:47] Okay. Now, prophecy. What did I I got my
[31:51] mix Did I get my slides mixed
[31:53] up? Yeah, I got my uh slide mixed
[31:59] up. What did I do?
[32:03] I must have deleted one on accident or
[32:05] something like
[32:08] that. Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. I must have
[32:10] deleted
[32:12] prophecy. Oh, accident deleted. Oh,
[32:14] yeah, cuz I duplicated it and then I
[32:16] forgot to Okay. Um, I'll go look it up
[32:20] here. Okay. I got it saved on
[32:26] here. I hope this works here by God's
[32:29] grace.
[32:39] Just bear with me here. I accidentally
[32:41] deleted a slide. I didn't mean to do
[32:45] that. That's chapter
[32:51] 13. Almost there. It's in chapter 11.
[33:00] What did I
[33:17] do? Okay, I'm almost
[33:21] there. There it is. Okay. My goodness.
[33:24] Sorry about that.
[33:27] my
[33:27] fault. So, prophecy is the ability that
[33:30] foretells the future, giving believers
[33:33] edification, exhortation, and comfort.
[33:37] Prophecies can be spontaneously
[33:38] pronounced aloud with thus sayith the
[33:40] Holy Ghost like Agabus in the scripture,
[33:43] right? Acts 21:1 or God can send a
[33:45] prophetic dream as he did with
[33:47] Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel chapter 2. When
[33:50] prophecies are pronounced in a public
[33:52] gathering, they are to be judged by two
[33:53] or three witnesses. According to 1
[33:55] Corinthians 14 verse 29 and 1
[33:58] Thessalonians 5:1
[33:59] 19-21, here are some examples uh of
[34:03] prophecies in the Bible. Jesus foretold
[34:06] Peter's three denials. Agabus prophesied
[34:09] a
[34:10] famine. Philip had four virgin daughters
[34:12] who
[34:13] prophesied. Uh, in 2013, a pastor friend
[34:17] of mine foretold the passing away of
[34:19] numerous preachers during that year.
[34:22] I'll never forget it. It was like after
[34:23] this service, we had like a prayer time
[34:25] after service and we went back in the in
[34:27] the pastor's study and uh the preacher
[34:30] said, "The Lord told me numerous famous
[34:34] message preachers are going to die this
[34:36] year." And if you know some of these
[34:37] names, uh, it was Joseph Coleman, Lee
[34:42] Vale, and, uh, I think it was, I can't
[34:46] remember the other one. Oh, Lonnie
[34:48] Jenkins. All died in the same year. So,
[34:50] the most famous worldwide message
[34:53] preachers that follow Brother Ram's
[34:54] ministry, uh, he said, "Thus sayith the
[34:57] Lord." And then there was other ones,
[34:58] too, but three of the most famous of all
[35:00] of them died that year. And I thought
[35:02] that was pretty
[35:03] striking. Uh, so that's that's one time.
[35:06] And then my, as I told you before, my
[35:07] wife and I have had numerous dreams
[35:09] where uh they were very specific, very
[35:12] detailed and came to pass, right? So if
[35:16] there's no prophet in the land, brother
[35:18] Brandham said, God will send dreams to
[35:20] people that are prophetic. Hallelujah.
[35:23] All right. Now, hopefully I got it. I
[35:25] don't have to read off of this. I hope I
[35:26] did the right
[35:30] uh Yeah. Brother Ram said, he says, "And
[35:33] there's a gift of prophecy which is in
[35:34] the church is to be judged by two or
[35:36] three judges when it's given." Now, I
[35:39] guess what I'll just say this, what's
[35:40] interesting is when the brother told me
[35:42] about the prophecy, we didn't have two
[35:44] or three people judge it. I was a very
[35:46] young Christian. I was a young pastor. I
[35:49] didn't have Oh, that's right. But it
[35:50] wasn't even publicly given. It was in
[35:52] privately given. So, yeah, I think
[35:54] there's a difference. I think when
[35:55] you're gathered in assembly and it's
[35:57] before everybody, it needs to be judged
[35:59] by two or three witnesses. Okay. So, I
[36:01] think that's what I was thinking about
[36:03] there. Uh, and then our dreams, you
[36:05] know, they weren't given publicly. They
[36:06] were just we woke up with we woke up and
[36:08] had the dreams and wrote it down and
[36:10] shared them with the two individuals and
[36:11] they they both of them were warnings,
[36:13] prophetic warnings of of of dreams and
[36:16] both came to
[36:18] pass. Now, Brother says, uh, for when a
[36:22] uh when a gift of prophecy come to a
[36:24] man, they declared him to be a prophet.
[36:26] Now, that's wrong. There's quite a
[36:27] difference between a gift of prophecy
[36:29] and a prophet. A gift of prophecy is in
[36:31] the church, but a prophet is born a
[36:33] prophet. See, that's the difference. Uh
[36:36] this man might prophesy tonight, he
[36:38] might never prophesy no more. So like
[36:41] for my case, I had one uh very specific
[36:43] dream that was prophetic. I've never had
[36:45] another one like that. Right? So So
[36:48] brother would call that that's a gift of
[36:50] prophecy of the nine gifts. But a
[36:52] prophet is someone who's a leader from
[36:54] the pulpit and says, "Thus sayith the
[36:56] Lord and G gives us prophecy and also
[36:59] gives us revelation of the word of God."
[37:02] Okay? Because a prophet is one of the
[37:04] five gifts, but a prophecy is also is
[37:07] also one of the nine gifts,
[37:10] right? So women can have the gift of
[37:11] prophesy, but they're not prophets.
[37:14] Preaching prophets,
[37:17] right?
[37:19] Okay. It might be on the woman over
[37:21] there the next night. This man back here
[37:23] the next night and that one over there.
[37:26] Okay, so that's a good great teaching by
[37:28] brother Brandham. A preaching prophet is
[37:30] born a prophet. And that's what remember
[37:32] that's what God told uh Miriam and
[37:35] Aaron. He said my servant Moses is he
[37:38] said if if there's a dreamer if there's
[37:40] a prophet I'll make myself known to him
[37:42] in dreams and visions. Okay. But my
[37:44] prophet Moses is even more than that.
[37:47] Praise God. Hallelujah. So, see, God
[37:50] will make himself known to a prophet if
[37:52] they're a prophet leader, right? And
[37:54] they'll have that their whole life.
[37:57] Okay? But a gift of prophecy could just
[37:58] be once in their life. All
[38:02] right? Now, discernment of spirit. The
[38:04] the word discern means to
[38:07] judge. It's knowledge that
[38:09] distinguishes, discerns, or judges
[38:12] between the two spirits. Right? Now, we
[38:14] talked about sister Lena having this
[38:15] one, right? Perhaps, right? on multiple
[38:17] occasions. You've seen it in your life.
[38:19] You're able to judge what spirit is on
[38:21] that person. Is that the Holy Spirit or
[38:23] is that an unclean spirit?
[38:26] Right? And discernment judges the spirit
[38:29] behind actions, word, prophecies, or
[38:32] words. That's why the Bible said, "Let
[38:34] two or three judge." You got to have uh
[38:37] gifts of discernment to judge prophecies
[38:39] that are given in the church.
[38:42] Hallelujah.
[38:45] Now, let me say one to
[38:47] my shame. Could I do that here? Let's
[38:49] see if I can pull it
[38:55] up. Yeah, I've been I've been seeing
[38:57] recently how
[39:00] uh Brother
[39:04] Brandham did you see the video I put out
[39:07] or I even read you the quote. Brother
[39:08] Ram said he was a jellyfish
[39:10] sometimes. Okay. And then brother Ram
[39:13] said,
[39:15] uh, if I can find this, I really like to
[39:17] read it. This one. Oh, there it just
[39:19] came to
[39:22] me. I don't know if I'll be able to find
[39:36] it. Okay. I don't know if I'm going to
[39:38] be able to find it. My goodness. I just
[39:41] was able to find it last time I looked
[39:42] for it. I'm just going to have to
[39:45] paraphrase it. So, to my own shame, when
[39:47] I was a very young pastor, we were in
[39:50] this prayer breakfast and uh at brother
[39:52] Cam's church. Wasn't actually in the
[39:54] church, but it was over that way. And we
[39:57] were praying. It was a men's breakfast
[39:58] and we were praying in a circle. Now,
[40:00] what's interesting the more I think
[40:02] about it, I was praying and I was
[40:04] holding hands with a brother who was in
[40:06] brother Cam's church and I knew he gave
[40:08] tongues and interpretations and I was
[40:10] praying. I said, "Lord, just please give
[40:12] us a word. Give us some type of a a
[40:14] tongue or interpretation." And the
[40:16] brother started saying, "Thus sayeth the
[40:19] Lord." Now, I'm just going to paraphrase
[40:21] it because I can't remember the words.
[40:22] This was 2012. Now, I'm remembering. And
[40:25] uh the voice said, "You already have
[40:28] everything you need." uh I'm already
[40:30] with
[40:31] you. Uh don't look for anything else.
[40:35] Everything you already need spiritually
[40:36] is already given for you. And we were
[40:39] just like, praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[40:41] Hallelujah. But now it's come out that
[40:43] we don't have everything we need.
[40:46] Right. We need rapturing faith. Right.
[40:49] Right. We need faith to have our bodies
[40:51] changed in a moment. Twinkling of an
[40:53] eye. Praise God. But in that moment, I
[40:56] received it. Right. And I didn't judge
[40:58] it.
[40:59] because I was so desperate for sometime
[41:01] and church. This is the same man that
[41:03] became the pastor over there and then
[41:05] got caught cheating with uh I'm sorry
[41:07] trying to go after a high school girl
[41:09] and now he's in
[41:11] jail. He was a message preacher. Same
[41:13] one I shared with you a couple well last
[41:16] year. Very gifted. I mean could sing,
[41:20] could preach,
[41:22] uh would give words like that and seemed
[41:25] like a couple times it was right. But in
[41:28] that moment, in that prayer breakfast, I
[41:30] didn't have the discernment. But I can
[41:31] look back now, that was what, 13 years
[41:33] ago. I can look back now and say that
[41:36] was a little off and I should not have I
[41:38] should have prayed and asked God for
[41:40] discernment. I should have questioned it
[41:42] because it was in a public setting of
[41:44] brothers. It was like a we had
[41:46] breakfast, then I preached, then we
[41:47] prayed together, and that's when it went
[41:49] forth. So that's one time I didn't have
[41:52] the discernment I needed. Praise God.
[41:55] And we all have times where we don't
[41:57] we're not as spiritual as we ought to
[41:58] be.
[42:00] Hallelujah. So, uh, brother says, "A
[42:03] message of tongues has to be before the
[42:04] church receives it." Paul said, "Let's
[42:06] leave two or three judges with
[42:08] discernment of spirit before it can be
[42:10] accepted to the church." Okay? So,
[42:12] that's of course in 1 Corinthians
[42:15] 14:29. So, now I've learned and now
[42:18] since then, we've had three times where
[42:21] tongues have been spoken, unknown
[42:22] tongues have been spoken in the church.
[42:24] And every time what did I do? If some of
[42:25] you remember I said let's pray for the
[42:27] interpretation. Now did the
[42:29] interpretation ever come? No. But we did
[42:32] what was right. We prayed for it.
[42:35] Hallelujah. And then and then remember I
[42:37] even said I said mercy I I said uh if if
[42:41] if this person keeps if if we keep
[42:44] speaking in tonesues, let them keep
[42:45] speaking in tonesues. You know some
[42:46] people might say well there's no
[42:47] interpretation and uh so then they
[42:50] shouldn't speak in tonesues uh in the
[42:52] congregation. And that's right. But if
[42:53] the person's just growing in it, let's
[42:55] give them a chance to grow a little bit.
[42:57] Let's give them a few tries. Praise God.
[42:59] Right? Because we'll just because what
[43:01] if what if the person with the gift of
[43:02] interpretation needs to get under the
[43:04] anointing more? What if he or she needs
[43:06] to grow in in the in their gift of
[43:08] interpretation?
[43:10] In other words, we in other words, we
[43:11] don't want to quench the Holy Spirit.
[43:14] Right? So that that's why it's good to
[43:17] for a while that's why for those three
[43:18] times I said, let's just pray. Praise
[43:20] God. People are speaking in unknown
[43:21] tongues. Hallelujah. Let's pray for the
[43:24] interpretation. Let's give somebody else
[43:27] a chance if they have the gift to
[43:29] interpret.
[43:32] Hallelujah. All right. But discernment
[43:34] uh is knowing what spirit is on people.
[43:37] And I felt that's what happened to me
[43:38] when we went through our division here
[43:40] back in February when when when it was
[43:42] shared with me the
[43:45] verses that I supposedly broke and I
[43:49] felt the Holy Ghost fall on me and the
[43:51] peace of God came over me. To me looking
[43:53] back now to me that was discernment. I
[43:55] can now discern that was the wrong
[43:57] spirit. And so the peace of God came on
[44:00] me and I just shook hands and said,
[44:02] "Well, I disagree." I I don't think that
[44:04] verse has nothing to do with song
[44:05] leading.
[44:07] It was about adultery. David taking a
[44:09] wife, right? David taking Bash or
[44:11] Uriah's wife. That wasn't about song
[44:13] leading. That was about adultery. That's
[44:15] right. But the Holy Spirit came on me to
[44:18] recognize and I could I could discern
[44:20] that spirit.
[44:22] Hallelujah.
[44:25] So now it just kind of makes makes sense
[44:27] by God's grace because now I knew what
[44:29] spirit it was. Now before I was nervous
[44:31] I w but when once I heard the scripture
[44:34] the spirit of God came on me to give me
[44:36] discernment. Oh now you can have peace
[44:38] because that's not even about the
[44:39] situation. I could judge the spirit
[44:41] behind it.
[44:44] Hallelujah. Okay. Now I didn't get to
[44:46] that one.
[44:48] Um so Paul said let two or three judge
[44:51] with discernment of spirit before it can
[44:53] be accepted in the
[44:55] church. Now let me do this one. Let's go
[44:57] back to Hebrews 4:12 because we read
[44:59] that on Sunday. Um, this can be used for
[45:02] a prophet
[45:04] uh but also for uh
[45:13] discernment. So, a prophet gift is very
[45:16] similar to a gift of
[45:18] discernment. Okay. So, uh Lydia, did you
[45:21] got it? Hebrews 4:12. Could you read
[45:22] that for me, hun?
[45:36] Can we all say discerner? Ready?
[45:37] Discerner. So the the word of God, the
[45:40] word of God naturally discerns. So
[45:43] discernment should happen often in our
[45:45] services. Sometimes you confess to me or
[45:48] sometimes people confess to me in the
[45:49] prayer line that they were discerned.
[45:51] Something spoke to them in the service
[45:53] that I didn't know about. Right? Because
[45:55] that's what the word naturally does.
[45:57] Sometimes I see it on your faces. You
[45:59] look at each other and you nod and
[46:00] smile. Oh yeah, we remember that. See,
[46:02] the word the word knows. God knows the
[46:05] thoughts and intents of your heart.
[46:09] Okay. And that's what that's what
[46:11] discernment is. It's able to judge the
[46:13] spirit, right? It judge your spirit.
[46:15] What were you thinking of? Right? Was it
[46:17] the Holy Spirit or the evil spirit?
[46:19] Hallelujah. But see, some people some
[46:21] people might have the gift of
[46:22] discernment but think they're prophets.
[46:24] And I'm not talking about you sister.
[46:25] I'm just saying in general like people
[46:27] like Pentecostal people, you know, or
[46:30] people that anyone that believes in
[46:31] gifts. And I love Pentecostal people. I
[46:33] was raised Pentecostal. They're sweet
[46:34] people. Now, I don't I don't agree with
[46:36] their denomination. I surely blast their
[46:39] denominations, right? Because uh
[46:42] denominations uh transgress the word of
[46:44] God by making the word of God of none
[46:46] effect. But they can be sweet people
[46:48] inside of the system. They're just
[46:49] blinded to the system. They're foolish,
[46:51] right? They got to be more wise and come
[46:54] out of that system. That's right.
[46:56] Absolutely right. Because the Bible
[46:59] says, "Come out of her, my people." And
[47:00] it's just not the Catholic Church. It's
[47:02] all the daughter churches, too. Every
[47:05] church that has a denomination is a
[47:07] daughter of the mother harlot. So, the
[47:10] people got to know to come out of there.
[47:11] Praise God. I lost my train of thought
[47:14] here. What was I saying? Anybody
[47:16] remember what I was saying? I lost my
[47:19] train of thought.
[47:21] Oh yeah, discernment and pro. Yeah.
[47:22] Yeah. Thank you, hun. Appreciate it. Ah,
[47:24] I've always said you're my backup mind.
[47:26] You're my you're my backup memory. Yeah.
[47:29] So, you see, you know, uh someone might
[47:31] have a gift of discernment and they'd be
[47:33] able to judge something in somebody's
[47:34] life, but then they automatically make
[47:38] them a prophet when they're not. They
[47:40] just have the gift of
[47:42] discernment because they're very
[47:43] similar. A prophet can have the gift of
[47:46] discernment, right? To know the
[47:47] thoughts. By vision, a prophet will see
[47:49] it. Right? But a gift of discernment
[47:52] won't have the vision. They'll just have
[47:54] the sense this is the right spirit. This
[47:56] is the wrong spirit.
[47:58] Okay? Like I met a man at at Lydia's
[48:01] graduation party two years ago. Well, I
[48:04] know this man. His name's Andy.
[48:07] Uh and he said he said this man walked
[48:10] up to him at a church service and said,
[48:12] "The Lord just told me this and this and
[48:14] that." And the man, the man Andy looked
[48:16] at me and said, "Jesse, he it's like he
[48:18] read my
[48:20] mail." Okay, so that's a gift of
[48:22] discernment, right? He was able to know
[48:24] the thoughts and intents of his heart,
[48:27] but he didn't say it with thus sayith
[48:28] the Lord, which is shows he's not a
[48:31] prophet, right? And he he said he didn't
[48:34] have a vision. And yeah, Andy said he
[48:36] didn't have a vision. He just said it
[48:38] would just comes to him as he's talking
[48:40] like God will just take over his mouth
[48:42] and just start speaking through him. And
[48:43] he's like, he's like, the man's like, I
[48:45] don't even know what I'm saying. Like,
[48:46] God takes over for me.
[48:49] Right? So, that's a gift of discernment.
[48:51] That's not a prophet because a prophet
[48:53] will stand there and say, "That's thus
[48:54] sayith the Lord." Hallelujah. Amen.
[48:58] Right? So, we got to be careful, right?
[49:00] We don't want to make discernment people
[49:02] prophets when they're not
[49:04] prophets. Hallelujah. I'm already at 8
[49:06] o'clock. Okay. All right. So, how are we
[49:09] doing?
[49:14] Okay. So, yeah, it has been admitted by
[49:16] tongues evidence people that there are
[49:18] false and true tongues for God, false
[49:20] and true tongues. For God has the
[49:22] genuine and Satan has the false. So, my
[49:24] question is, who knows what is real? Who
[49:26] understood the language to know what was
[49:27] spoken? Who has the gift of discernment
[49:30] to know? Okay. So, if somebody has a
[49:32] gift of discernment, they can know if
[49:34] that person that spoke in tongues, was
[49:36] that God or did that person make it up?
[49:39] Right? Because I've had friends that
[49:41] told me they made up their tongues just
[49:43] because they they didn't want to be
[49:44] embarrassed. Right. Yeah. And the man,
[49:48] the good man, his name is Greg, and he
[49:49] cried. He was so he was so sincere about
[49:52] it. The preacher just put the mic in his
[49:54] face and said, "Did you receive the Holy
[49:55] Ghost?" He said, "Yes." "Then speak in
[49:57] tongues." And he was put on the spot in
[49:58] front of everybody. That's a bad
[50:00] preacher right there.
[50:04] That's right. Amen, brother. That's
[50:06] right.
[50:08] Hallelujah. See, that's that's Satan,
[50:10] the God of force, right? He's forcing
[50:12] you to speak in tongues. The Bible says
[50:14] that Satan is the god of force. He's
[50:15] forcing you to do something. But God
[50:17] will lead you into something. Amen.
[50:20] Hallelujah. If if you'll surrender,
[50:21] he'll lead you into it because God's a
[50:25] gentleman.
[50:27] Hallelujah. Uh it's 8 o'clock. Uh
[50:30] tongue. Oh, the last two. Yeah, these
[50:32] are these are fairly explanatory, right?
[50:33] We've these are self-explanatory. Uh a
[50:36] tongue is a language uh speaking in
[50:38] tongues or speaking languages or tongues
[50:41] of men or angels. So there's two kinds
[50:42] of tongues. It's either a tongue of a of
[50:45] some nation around the world or it's
[50:47] angelic tongue. There's only two kinds
[50:49] of tongues, right? It's either a tongue
[50:52] you can learn and go talk to somebody
[50:53] who in their country, right, or tribe or
[50:57] it's an angelic tongue which no human
[50:59] knows. That's how angels talk. Some
[51:02] tongues are for private prayer if
[51:04] there's no interpreter. That's what I
[51:05] was talking about earlier. If somebody
[51:07] just spoke in tonesues all the time and
[51:08] we just kept praying and there was no
[51:10] interpreter, I'd walk up and say, "Well,
[51:11] I appreciate you speaking in tongues,
[51:12] but let's keep it in your private life,
[51:14] you know, would you?" Because there
[51:16] there's obviously nobody here with the
[51:17] gift of interpretation.
[51:20] Okay? Uh tongues that are interpreted
[51:23] edify the entire church and therefore
[51:25] are most
[51:27] desired. Okay? So, the most desirable
[51:29] gifts are the ones that edify the most
[51:32] group of people. Hallelujah. Brother
[51:34] said, "I've spoken in tongues several
[51:35] times and I believe it's the power of
[51:37] God." Yes. I don't believe in the
[51:38] initial evidence now is speaking in
[51:40] tonesues, but I believe there's a power
[51:42] of God makes you speak in tongues, signs
[51:44] and wonders to follow. Yes, sir. Whoops.
[51:48] I did the wrong
[51:50] button. Brother Ram said he was working
[51:53] one time.
[51:54] Uh he walked many miles. I think he'd be
[51:57] walked like he Yeah, he walked the
[51:58] railroad tracks. And he said, "I was
[52:01] coming down the track and I was along
[52:02] there. I was singing. I always sang. I
[52:04] had different places where I went to
[52:06] pray. I was going along there singing
[52:07] all at once. I come to found out I was
[52:08] speaking in tonesues, not knowing what I
[52:10] was doing. So, he would just sing so
[52:12] much that one time he just started
[52:13] singing in
[52:14] tonesues. I've heard singing in tonesues
[52:16] before. I I was raised in a Pentecostal
[52:18] church. There was tonesues quite often.
[52:21] Hallelujah. Uh so yeah, brother said
[52:24] that's how it happened to him. Sometimes
[52:25] he would just sing and then he starts
[52:26] speaking in tonesues.
[52:29] Brother man said speaking in tongues
[52:30] comes in such a combustion that the
[52:32] person hardly knows what they're doing.
[52:34] They don't know what they're saying. And
[52:35] interpretation is the same way. They
[52:37] know not what they're going to say. They
[52:39] have no more idea they're going to say
[52:41] it because it's
[52:42] supernatural. When I've when I've talked
[52:44] to people uh back at the Assemblies of
[52:47] God church where I was raised, that's
[52:48] what they said. They just open their
[52:49] mouth and the words would come out. They
[52:51] didn't plan it all out and say, "Well,
[52:53] I'm going to say this. I'm going to say
[52:54] that." They just start speaking and God
[52:56] speaks through them. Amen. kind of like
[52:58] with that discernment, that discernment
[52:59] gift, the same thing. You just start
[53:01] talking
[53:02] and starts flowing out. Okay. One time
[53:06] somebody told me it's like a it's like a
[53:08] it's like there's a container inside of
[53:10] you and it breaks and it just gushes out
[53:12] and so you just got to let it flow.
[53:14] That's what somebody told me one time.
[53:15] Brother Chris
[53:30] I don't know. That's a good question,
[53:31] brother. I don't know. I have to look
[53:32] that up. It would be it would uh the
[53:36] only way to know is would be to know
[53:37] lots of languages, right? Because
[53:39] somebody would speak in a tongue that
[53:41] nobody ever heard before, right? And so
[53:44] if it was a tongue no human ever heard
[53:46] before, then that would be an angelic
[53:48] tongue. Yeah. Good question. Give them
[53:50] two claps. Good question, man. Uh, but
[53:52] as far as quotes from brother Bram, I
[53:54] don't have any on that. U, I could look
[53:55] for some by God's
[54:00] grace. All right. U, so I'm going to
[54:02] Yeah, remember the Bible said, "Do all
[54:04] speak with tongues?" The answer is no.
[54:05] Do all have the gift of interpretation?
[54:06] No. Now, interpretation is uh
[54:10] interpreting what's been spoken by
[54:11] someone else. Uh interpretations to
[54:14] tongues should be prayed for and judged
[54:16] by the gift of discernment. So see see
[54:19] church gifts can be a lot of prayer
[54:21] right because first you pray for the
[54:23] spirit to come and then when the spirit
[54:25] gets there uh and manifest then you got
[54:28] to pray for the interpretation and then
[54:30] you got to pray you get the right
[54:31] discernment.
[54:33] So see that's why that's one reason why
[54:35] I believe maybe we don't have as many
[54:37] gifts operating because we're not
[54:38] praying enough. Right. That's what that
[54:41] that would just be my my guess. It's
[54:43] either that or uh it's not God's time
[54:46] and season. Right? Because we we can't
[54:50] and we can't control the gifts. Like I
[54:51] can't take my gift out and say, "Okay,
[54:52] now I'm going to do a miracle because I
[54:54] I control the miracles." No, the
[54:56] miracles control me. Right. God controls
[54:59] me. I don't control it.
[55:01] That's right. Yeah. I can't turn it off
[55:02] and on. Now, the only thing you can with
[55:04] that, you can turn off the tongues where
[55:06] the Bible says, remember uh the Bible
[55:08] said uh the spirit of the pro prophets
[55:10] prophets is subject to the prophets. So
[55:12] that that that's a case of a person who
[55:14] can speak in tongues, they can stop it
[55:16] if there's no interpreter. That's the
[55:18] one time we can, right? That's one time
[55:20] we can uh if somebody had the uh the
[55:22] gift of tongues, they just have to hold
[55:24] it in. Brother Brooks has told me he's
[55:26] done that. He's he's had to hold it in
[55:28] when he felt like it. Some sometimes you
[55:29] have to do
[55:30] that. And brother Bam says sometimes uh
[55:33] some will speak in tongues maybe for
[55:35] five for five minutes and other one give
[55:37] four words of interpretation. See, it
[55:39] has to be the same sound, the same rise
[55:41] and fall of the voice. So, Brother Bam
[55:42] saw it so much. He said the the
[55:45] interpretation has to match the
[55:47] tongue. Okay? Has to match the tongue.
[55:50] Now, let me see if I I want to just
[55:51] close. Yeah, I want to close with this
[55:52] here. All right. Now, let's close with
[55:54] this. Now, if you are unsure on your
[55:56] gift, wait. Because brother Ram says,
[55:57] "Satan loves to trick people and make
[56:00] them think they have gifts when they
[56:02] don't."
[56:03] So, just wait, right? Just wait. Don't
[56:08] try to say get under pressure like, "Oh,
[56:09] I gotta figure this out now. I gotta
[56:11] figure Is that how the strawberry the
[56:13] strawberries came up right now?" But all
[56:15] all winter where they're saying, "I
[56:16] gotta produce now. I gotta produce now."
[56:18] No. They waited for the time and season
[56:20] to produce.
[56:21] And that's how a Christian has to be.
[56:23] You have to just have confidence in God.
[56:25] God will manifest your gift at just the
[56:27] right time.
[56:30] Like I told you, when I first walked in
[56:32] the message church and I was a believer
[56:33] in the message, I felt a ma I literally
[56:35] felt a magnet up to the pulpit. I walked
[56:38] in that door and I'm like, I need to go
[56:40] up there and I didn't even know what it
[56:41] was. I didn't know it was like me
[56:42] preaching. I just like I felt like, man,
[56:45] I just feel something like inside of me
[56:47] drawing me. And then people would invite
[56:49] me to pray and I'd come up here and
[56:51] pray. I'd be like then people invite me
[56:53] to sing songs. And then the one
[56:54] brother's like, Jess, you need to
[56:55] preach. I'm like, I don't know about
[56:57] that. I felt inside and then I when I uh
[57:00] the first time I preached nothing really
[57:02] happened but the second time I prayed
[57:04] and fasted and said God show me and then
[57:06] I knew God called me to preach because
[57:08] people were delivered from their sins.
[57:10] Uh the whole altar was full over there
[57:12] in Lima. And so now I have no doubts.
[57:14] Praise God. I just got to remain humble
[57:16] and faithful to uh to the calling in
[57:19] life. Okay. But I just waited on it.
[57:22] Now, after I was preaching a while,
[57:24] Brother Austin, two people come up and
[57:25] said, "I always knew you're going to be
[57:26] a preacher. The first time I saw you, I
[57:29] knew you'd be a preacher." I I was like,
[57:30] "I wish you would have told me that when
[57:31] you saw me. Why didn't you tell me when
[57:33] you met me?" No, I'm just joking. Uh,
[57:36] Romans 12 3-8. Romans 12. We're closing
[57:39] with a couple verses
[57:41] here. Romans 12
[57:43] 3-8. Now, it's good to uh It's good to
[57:47] u uh it's good to wait it out. Yeah.
[57:49] It's good to go through those trials.
[57:51] It's good. It's good to go through the
[57:53] uncertainty because that's a chance for
[57:54] you to trust in God.
[57:56] You learn to wait. You learn to uh
[57:59] struggle. You learn to trust. You you
[58:01] learn to pray harder, right? Amen. You
[58:04] don't you don't want to bring reproach
[58:05] upon God. You don't want to be out. You
[58:06] don't want to be in the permissive will
[58:08] of God. You want to be in the perfect
[58:09] will of God. Amen. It's kind of like
[58:11] growing pains, right? You just got to
[58:12] Don't you want to grow? Yeah. But you
[58:14] got to go through the growing pains,
[58:16] right? Or else you ain't going to grow.
[58:18] Hallelujah. Romans 12:3, for I say
[58:22] through the grace given unto me to every
[58:23] man that is among you, not to think of
[58:25] himself more highly than he ought to
[58:26] think, but to think soberly. So if you
[58:28] think you got a five talent gift, uh,
[58:29] take it down a few
[58:32] talents. Now, if you got a one, if
[58:34] you're happy with one, you can't go any
[58:35] lower than one because everybody has one
[58:38] gift. The Bible said, uh, it's given to
[58:40] every man to profit with all. Every me
[58:42] every person has a gift at least
[58:46] one according let's finish verse three
[58:49] as God had dealt to every man the
[58:51] measure of faith. So everybody has a
[58:54] measure or portion of some
[58:56] gift. So I'm looking at these young men
[58:58] I wonder if any of them got preaching
[58:59] gifts. It's okay if they don't. Right?
[59:02] But these young men here that have just
[59:03] been with us Mercy's family. I wonder
[59:05] what gifts they got in their life. You
[59:07] know I think about Malachi and of course
[59:10] as a man I think about preachers. you
[59:11] know, Zion, you know, Andy and
[59:16] uh James, you know, the the boys in our
[59:18] church. Now we got Vander, you know, I
[59:20] wonder what gifts in his life. Austin,
[59:22] you know, Chris, Brother Rod, what
[59:24] gifts, you know, just wonder what gifts
[59:26] are in their
[59:27] life. But everybody has a measure,
[59:29] right? And remember, the Bible says,
[59:31] don't compare yourself to other people.
[59:33] In other words, don't get jealous of
[59:34] other people. Be happy for other people.
[59:36] Amen.
[59:38] Brother Ram says, "I can't be Billy
[59:41] Graham." Right.
[59:44] Right. Amen.
[59:47] You're right, brother. He said, "But
[59:49] Billy Graham can't be me."
[59:52] Right. Hallelujah. That's right. Boy, he
[59:55] really turned out awful, didn't he?
[59:59] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, yes, sir. Yes,
[1:00:03] sir. Yeah, that's right. Pride goes
[1:00:06] before the
[1:00:08] fall. But you have to look at it like
[1:00:10] that. You can do something because
[1:00:12] you're in a different position than any
[1:00:13] other person on earth. So you have a
[1:00:16] gift to meet the needs around the people
[1:00:19] that you're with.
[1:00:21] Right? And nobody else can beat nobody
[1:00:24] else can take your place until God calls
[1:00:25] you
[1:00:26] home. Right? The Bible says a gift makes
[1:00:29] room for himself. Let's read that.
[1:00:31] That's
[1:00:32] Proverbs. But I'll read that. But then
[1:00:34] we want to stay in Romans 12. This is
[1:00:36] just kind of coming to
[1:00:41] me. Yeah. Proverbs 18:16. A man's gift
[1:00:44] makes room for him. So you don't got to
[1:00:47] push your way and say, "Well, I'm going
[1:00:48] to do this. I'm going to do that." The
[1:00:49] gift does it for
[1:00:51] you. The gift comes in and and makes
[1:00:54] room for you. You don't got to make your
[1:00:55] push your way into anything. People like
[1:00:58] like people invited me up to preach. I
[1:01:00] never pushed my way to preach. They they
[1:01:02] told me to preach. They asked me to
[1:01:03] preach. Now re one reason why I was
[1:01:06] already doing Bible studies. I was
[1:01:07] already teaching all these Bible studies
[1:01:09] and Tim's like, "Well, you need to go
[1:01:11] preach, Jess. You're already teaching
[1:01:12] the word and you got people baptized and
[1:01:15] all these things." Okay, let me pray
[1:01:17] about it. You
[1:01:21] know, so a gift will make room for
[1:01:23] yourself and brings you before great
[1:01:25] men. Hallelujah. Think of Brother Brand,
[1:01:28] all the kings that he prayed for the he
[1:01:30] had vice president. He had a breakfast
[1:01:31] with Richard Nixon. Brother Brham, we
[1:01:33] have a picture of him with Richard
[1:01:34] Nixon. It brought him before great men,
[1:01:36] right? Powerful men in the in the
[1:01:38] government. Uh the congressman upshaw
[1:01:41] was healed through brother's ministry.
[1:01:42] Praise God. Now back to Romans 12 verse
[1:01:46] 4. For as we have many members in in one
[1:01:48] body, all members have not the same
[1:01:50] office. So we being many are one body in
[1:01:53] Christ, and everyone members one of
[1:01:55] another. having then gifts differing
[1:01:58] according to the grace that is given to
[1:01:59] us. Whether prophecy, let us prophesy
[1:02:01] according to the proportion of faith. So
[1:02:05] see, think about that prophecy. Some
[1:02:07] people prophesy entire books of the
[1:02:09] Bible. And Jeremiah and Isaiah and
[1:02:12] Ezekiel said, "Amen."
[1:02:15] Right? But if we had a dream, a
[1:02:17] prophetic dream, it was very small.
[1:02:19] Nothing compared to the book of Ezekiel.
[1:02:23] Because everybody has a proportion of a
[1:02:25] gift,
[1:02:27] right? Hallelujah. Verse uh verse seven.
[1:02:32] Or ministries. Now, here's what I'm
[1:02:33] talking about with the preachers or
[1:02:34] ministry. Let us wait on our
[1:02:36] ministering.
[1:02:38] So, see, if you're not sure, just wait.
[1:02:41] Just wait. Your gift will make room for
[1:02:43] you. You won't have to push yourself in
[1:02:46] anything. God will push you into it.
[1:02:49] Yeah. God will push you into it. That's
[1:02:50] right. Hallelujah.
[1:02:53] He says, uh, yeah, the Bible says, "Or
[1:02:56] he that teacheth on teaching." So if you
[1:02:57] think you can really teach something
[1:02:59] really good, just wait on it. Wait on
[1:03:00] it, right? Let God do
[1:03:03] it. Verse eight, or he that exhortth,
[1:03:06] that means to give comfort, on
[1:03:08] exhortation. He that giveth, let him do
[1:03:10] it with simplicity. Remember, don't make
[1:03:12] a show of it. Don't let your right hand
[1:03:14] know what your left hand's
[1:03:16] doing. He that ruleth with diligence. So
[1:03:19] see, ruler, preacher, pastor, right? I
[1:03:22] gota I got to be diligent. I got to be
[1:03:24] faithful, right? Whether I feel it or
[1:03:26] not, I'm coming to church, right?
[1:03:28] Whether I whether I feel good or feel
[1:03:30] bad, I'm going to come to church, right?
[1:03:32] You you got to be diligent. Yeah. He
[1:03:36] that showeth mercy with cheerfulness.
[1:03:40] Okay. So, we get some good uh
[1:03:43] instruction there. Last last set here.
[1:03:44] I'm This is my last slide here. by God's
[1:03:46] grace. Remember church, gifts are
[1:03:49] secondary because everybody has a gift
[1:03:52] whether a person's saved or lost. So,
[1:03:55] Matthew 7:21, very familiar for us. One
[1:03:58] of this was one of the most important
[1:03:59] verses I ever uh heard brother Ram
[1:04:02] preach because before I heard brother
[1:04:04] Ram, this was my biggest question about
[1:04:06] the Bible was Matthew
[1:04:09] 7:21-23. I sat there, I still see myself
[1:04:12] at Akan University. I'm reading my NIV
[1:04:14] Bible. I'm like, "What does this mean?"
[1:04:17] And then uh not a few months later, I
[1:04:19] hear brother preach the sermon called
[1:04:20] the anointed ones of the end time.
[1:04:22] Totally explained it. Matthew 7:21, "Not
[1:04:26] everyone that saith unto me, Lord,
[1:04:27] Lord," shall enter in the kingdom of
[1:04:28] heaven, but he which doeth the will of
[1:04:30] my father which is in
[1:04:32] heaven. So, anybody can say, "God, save
[1:04:35] me. God save me." That doesn't mean
[1:04:37] you're going to heaven. You have to meet
[1:04:39] God's conditions to go to heaven. Amen.
[1:04:42] Right?
[1:04:43] What's the condition? Do the will of
[1:04:44] God. Obey. And you only obey if you love
[1:04:47] God. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep
[1:04:49] my commands." So you got to love Jesus
[1:04:51] more than you love the world. You can't
[1:04:53] love the world. If you love the world,
[1:04:54] the love of God is not even in you.
[1:04:57] Verse 22. And this is what shook me.
[1:04:59] Many will say to me in that day, so a
[1:05:01] lot of people are going to be saying, I
[1:05:02] said, Lord, Lord, I called I I said the
[1:05:04] sinner's prayer, right? Or I had a gift
[1:05:07] of miracles. I had a miracle in my life
[1:05:09] or I spoke in tongues or I prophesied or
[1:05:11] I did a word of wisdom, word of
[1:05:12] knowledge. Many are going to say that.
[1:05:16] Not not a few,
[1:05:18] many. Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
[1:05:20] in thy name? And in thy name have cast
[1:05:22] out devils and in thy name done many
[1:05:26] wonderful
[1:05:27] works. So that could be praying,
[1:05:29] fasting, giving alms,
[1:05:32] uh giving with cheerfulness, right? All
[1:05:34] these things. And verse 23, and then I
[1:05:37] will profess unto them, I never knew
[1:05:39] you. Depart from me, ye that work
[1:05:42] iniquity. Jesus never said, you didn't
[1:05:45] prophesy. He never said you didn't cast
[1:05:46] out devils. So they actually did those
[1:05:48] things and they're still
[1:05:51] lost. Okay? And the secret of it is,
[1:05:53] brother Baron tells us they're workers
[1:05:55] of iniquity. So, in other words, they
[1:05:58] knew about God and they would repent for
[1:06:00] a little bit to get to get the anointing
[1:06:02] of God on them to do miracles and
[1:06:04] whatever, cast out devils, all these
[1:06:05] things, but then they would uh get that
[1:06:07] they would grieve the Holy Spirit and
[1:06:09] then they would get evil spirits on them
[1:06:11] and live like a devil.
[1:06:14] Right? So, they come in the church, God
[1:06:15] would use them because they're devoted
[1:06:17] for that short period of time, but they
[1:06:18] spend the rest of their time living like
[1:06:20] a devil.
[1:06:23] Hallelujah. Because the rain falls, the
[1:06:25] Holy Ghost falls on the just and the
[1:06:27] unjust.
[1:06:30] Hallelujah. 1 Corinthians 13
[1:06:37] 1-3. We're not there, but I did preach
[1:06:39] on that earlier in the series.
[1:06:46] And so since we understand all the
[1:06:48] mysteries in the Bible because brother
[1:06:50] Ram fulfilled Revelation
[1:06:52] 10:7 uh we have to make sure we have the
[1:06:54] love of God. So I like brother Rod's I
[1:06:58] didn't tell Rod I was going to say this
[1:06:59] but Rod a couple times and said you're
[1:07:00] really loving brother Jess and you just
[1:07:02] treat me kind and that made me feel
[1:07:04] good. You know brother Rod because that
[1:07:06] means I got charity but I also
[1:07:08] understand all the
[1:07:10] mysteries. Hallelujah. There's 12 that
[1:07:13] are called mysteries in the New
[1:07:14] Testament. And brother Ram gave us the
[1:07:16] revelation of all of them.
[1:07:19] Hallelujah. Glory. So I appreciate that,
[1:07:21] brother Rod. Verse verse one. Though I
[1:07:24] speak with tongues of men and angels. So
[1:07:26] there's two kinds of tongues. And have
[1:07:28] not charity, I'm become as a sounding
[1:07:30] brass and a tinkling symbol. Just some
[1:07:31] just a noise maker, right? It doesn't if
[1:07:34] you don't have love, it what good is it?
[1:07:35] It doesn't do any good. And though I
[1:07:38] have the gift of prophecy and understand
[1:07:40] all mysteries. Now, that's us as message
[1:07:41] believers because Revelation 10:7, the
[1:07:44] mystery of God is finished through the
[1:07:46] seventh angel. Brother Bram's the
[1:07:48] seventh church age
[1:07:50] messenger. And all knowledge and see all
[1:07:53] that deep understanding, all the keys.
[1:07:54] In other words, you have all the keys of
[1:07:56] knowledge. And though I have all faith,
[1:07:58] so I could remove mountains and have not
[1:08:01] charity, I'm
[1:08:03] nothing. See, so that just means any
[1:08:05] gift, right? Any gift you have, no
[1:08:07] matter what gift you have and how much
[1:08:09] you can manifest it, it doesn't mean
[1:08:10] anything if you don't have love. And
[1:08:13] though I bestow all my goods to feed the
[1:08:15] poor, and though I give my body to be
[1:08:17] burned and have not charity, it profits
[1:08:20] me
[1:08:21] nothing.
[1:08:24] Hallelujah. Now, we're not going to read
[1:08:26] this, but I'm just going to uh I'm just
[1:08:28] going to emphasize this.
[1:08:30] These two verses show sinners can even
[1:08:34] have the Holy Spirit on them to do
[1:08:36] miracles. And the example in the Bible
[1:08:38] is
[1:08:39] Balum. Balam had the gift of prophesy.
[1:08:42] He prophesied of the star that led the
[1:08:44] wise men to Jesus. They were following
[1:08:47] Balam's prophecy. But Balam went to
[1:08:51] hell. His prophecy was true. But he
[1:08:54] taught Israel to commit fornication. He
[1:08:56] taught him to commit sexual sin.
[1:08:59] Therefore, he went to
[1:09:00] hell. Right? So, he had the anointing
[1:09:03] for a while, but then he lost anointing.
[1:09:05] The Bible says sometimes he would go to
[1:09:07] God and other times he would go to
[1:09:10] witches. And so, that's what that's what
[1:09:12] we have today even in in churches.
[1:09:15] Preachers can preachers or anybody can
[1:09:18] do miracles, but what other spirits are
[1:09:20] they going after when they're not in
[1:09:21] church? That's the
[1:09:24] question. You got to live the life in
[1:09:26] your home. You got to be, I'll say like
[1:09:29] this, a worker of righteousness, not a
[1:09:31] worker of iniquity.
[1:09:33] Iniquity is lawlessness. In other words,
[1:09:35] that doesn't apply to me. I can still
[1:09:36] live in the world. I can still love the
[1:09:38] world. I can do whatever I want. God
[1:09:39] anoints me. I do miracles. God uses me
[1:09:41] for
[1:09:42] miracles. Yeah, God may do that. But you
[1:09:45] might be a vessel of dishonor.
[1:09:47] Make sure your life is a vessel of honor
[1:09:49] to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:09:52] So, see, he sometimes he would go to
[1:09:54] demon spirits, other times he'd go to
[1:09:56] almighty God. and God would speak to him
[1:09:58] and God would anoint him and his gifts
[1:10:00] would operate. But second Peter 2, let's
[1:10:03] let's close with that one. Second Peter
[1:10:08] 2. So when we preach on gifts, it's it's
[1:10:11] for us, we're believers, it should stir
[1:10:13] us up, but we must always keep the
[1:10:15] balance. Love is the greatest gift of
[1:10:16] all. Hallelujah. Yes, we understand all
[1:10:19] the mysteries. Thank God. But let's
[1:10:20] still be loving to each other. Let's
[1:10:21] that's the most important thing.
[1:10:25] I think you've heard the saying, "People
[1:10:26] don't care how much you know till they
[1:10:28] know how much you care." Right? Have you
[1:10:31] heard that
[1:10:32] before? I've heard that numerous times
[1:10:34] down through the years. People don't
[1:10:36] care how much I know about the Bible.
[1:10:37] They just want to know that I care about
[1:10:38] them. I help them with food and
[1:10:39] clothing, right? You know, be kind to
[1:10:42] them. They don't care if I can recite
[1:10:45] all the 12 New Testament mysteries. They
[1:10:47] don't care. They want to know, do I love
[1:10:49] people? Do I have the love of Jesus
[1:10:51] Christ? That's what they want to know.
[1:10:55] Second Peter 2:10, but chiefly them that
[1:10:58] walk after the flesh in the lust of
[1:10:59] uncleanness and despise government.
[1:11:02] Presumptuous are they self-willed.
[1:11:03] They're not afraid to speak evil of
[1:11:05] dignities. Whereas angels which are
[1:11:07] greater in power and might bring not
[1:11:08] railing accusation against them before
[1:11:10] the Lord. But these, now he's going to
[1:11:12] talk about Balum here. But these, as
[1:11:14] natural brute beasts made to be taken
[1:11:16] and destroyed, speak evil of things that
[1:11:18] they understand not, and shall utterly
[1:11:20] perish in their own corruption.
[1:11:23] and shall receive the reward of
[1:11:25] unrighteousness as they that count it
[1:11:27] pleasure to riot in the daytime. Spots
[1:11:30] are they and blemishes sporting
[1:11:31] themselves with their own deceings while
[1:11:34] they feast with you. Remember Balum was
[1:11:36] deceiving them to commit sexual sin. Oh,
[1:11:38] it's okay to comm. It's okay to have sex
[1:11:41] even if you're not married. It was a
[1:11:44] deception. He was a beast. He was a
[1:11:46] natural brute beast. Hallelujah. That's
[1:11:48] why he went to hell. He was a worker of
[1:11:50] iniquity. Think about that. He saw the
[1:11:52] star that led the wise men to Jesus. He
[1:11:54] saw in a vision. The Bible said his eyes
[1:11:56] were open. He was in a trance and he saw
[1:11:59] that star lead some them lead lead them
[1:12:01] to the
[1:12:03] Messiah. But then after that he wanted
[1:12:05] to go see some filth as
[1:12:09] well. Help us Lord. Verse 14. Having
[1:12:13] eyes full of adultery and that cannot
[1:12:15] cease from sin. See you got to get
[1:12:16] victory over sin in your life.
[1:12:19] beguiling unstable souls like telling
[1:12:21] them to commit fornication and heart
[1:12:23] they have exercised with covetous
[1:12:25] practice. See remember why did he go
[1:12:26] there? He wanted money. Hallelujah.
[1:12:29] Remember was it King Bailo or Beric? I
[1:12:32] always get those mixed up. Bareric.
[1:12:34] Bailac. Was it Bailac? Thank you. I
[1:12:35] always get those two mixed up. Bailac
[1:12:38] and Barack because I think of Barack
[1:12:39] Obama for some
[1:12:40] reason. And I don't think he's on the
[1:12:42] Lord's side. I know he's not on the
[1:12:44] Lord's side because the tree is known by
[1:12:47] its fruit.
[1:12:48] Uh, so Bailo, Bailo paid him money,
[1:12:51] remember? Because he said, "Oh, God told
[1:12:52] me not to go." Bailo's like, "Oh, go ask
[1:12:54] God again. I'll give you money if you
[1:12:57] come." See, covetous preachers, right?
[1:13:01] False preachers, cursed children, which
[1:13:03] have forsaken the right way. They've
[1:13:04] gone astray, following the way of Balum.
[1:13:07] See, Balam forsook the right way. Even
[1:13:09] God anointed a donkey to talk to him to
[1:13:12] try to stop him from going. See, God
[1:13:14] will put every red light in front of us.
[1:13:16] We must heed the warnings. Praise God.
[1:13:19] But he just went right through the
[1:13:20] donkey, too. He asked God a second time.
[1:13:23] Can I go God a second time? You've
[1:13:25] already got God's first word. Why do you
[1:13:26] need a second? You don't. But he wanted
[1:13:29] the
[1:13:32] money. He says, uh, are gone astray.
[1:13:35] Verse 15, following the way of Balam,
[1:13:37] the son of Bozar, who loved the wages of
[1:13:39] unrighteousness. See, he wanted the
[1:13:40] money. And so that that way he he knew
[1:13:43] he could get Israel to fall in sexual
[1:13:44] sin. couldn't curse them, but could
[1:13:47] brother Ram said he could uh cause them
[1:13:49] for God to punish them through their
[1:13:51] sexual
[1:13:53] sin. But he was rebuked for his
[1:13:56] iniquity. The dumb ass speaking with
[1:13:58] man's voice forbade the madness of the
[1:14:00] prophet. These are wells without water,
[1:14:03] clouds that are carried with a tempest
[1:14:04] to whom the mist of darkness is reserved
[1:14:06] forever. So that's the proof that Balam
[1:14:08] went to
[1:14:09] hell. Look at verse 19. While they
[1:14:12] promised them liberty, they themselves
[1:14:13] are the servants of corruption. See,
[1:14:16] because he wanted money. Bam was a he
[1:14:18] really wanted money. For of whom a man
[1:14:20] is overcome of the same as he brought
[1:14:22] into bondage. That's why, church, we
[1:14:24] don't get overcome by sin. We overcome
[1:14:26] sin. And you better make sure your sins
[1:14:29] don't overcome you, but you overcome
[1:14:31] your sins. Praise God.
[1:14:34] Hallelujah. We can do it. We can do all
[1:14:36] things through Christ who strengthens
[1:14:37] me. For if after they've escaped the
[1:14:39] pollutions of the world through the
[1:14:41] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:14:43] Christ, they are again entangled therein
[1:14:46] and overcome. The latter end is worse
[1:14:48] with them than the beginning. This is
[1:14:51] what happened to Judas's scared as well,
[1:14:52] right? He come out to follow Jesus, but
[1:14:54] what got him? The money. Seem like money
[1:14:56] is a common one, right? He went right
[1:14:59] back to the money and left Jesus.
[1:15:01] Betrayed him and he was uh he hung
[1:15:03] himself the son of
[1:15:05] predition. His latter end was worse than
[1:15:08] his beginning. For it had been better
[1:15:10] for them not to have known the way of
[1:15:12] righteousness than after they have known
[1:15:13] it to turn from the holy commandment
[1:15:16] delivered unto them. But it's happened
[1:15:18] unto them according to the true proverb.
[1:15:20] The dog is re is turned to his own vomit
[1:15:23] again and the sow that was washed to her
[1:15:25] wallering in the mire. Amen. Let's stand
[1:15:27] to our feet. Praise God. We'll stop
[1:15:29] right
[1:15:31] there. I can't let that be the last
[1:15:34] verse. I got to end on a positive one
[1:15:35] here by God's grace. Matthew 25
[1:15:38] musicians can
[1:15:46] come. I'm ending of course with the
[1:15:48] parable of
[1:15:54] talents. I'll just read about
[1:15:58] the the first servant
[1:16:01] there.
[1:16:05] Verse 20, Matthew 25:20. And so he that
[1:16:08] had received five talents came and
[1:16:10] brought other five talents, saying,
[1:16:11] Lord, thou deliverest unto me five
[1:16:13] talents. Behold, I have gained beside
[1:16:15] them five talents more. His lord said
[1:16:18] unto him, Well done, thou good and
[1:16:20] faithful servant. Thou has been faithful
[1:16:22] over a few things. I will make thee
[1:16:23] ruler over many things. Enter thou in
[1:16:26] the joy of the Lord. How many want to be
[1:16:29] diligent with the gifts God's given you?
[1:16:31] Praise God. If you're not sure, church,
[1:16:32] wait on it. Just be diligent in
[1:16:34] everything else. Right? When my gift was
[1:16:37] made known to me, I gave myself fully to
[1:16:39] preaching, fully to studying, fully to
[1:16:40] teaching. But before that, I was just
[1:16:42] faithful to God. Faithful to God
[1:16:44] everything I know. If you don't know
[1:16:46] your gifts yet, be faithful to God. And
[1:16:49] wait on the Lord.
[1:16:51] Hallelujah. He'll restore your strength.
[1:16:53] They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:16:55] their strength. Let's bow for a word of
[1:16:56] prayer. Father God, we're thankful for
[1:16:58] tonight, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that we
[1:16:59] can make it through these uh gifts.
[1:17:01] Numbers four down through nine. Forgive
[1:17:03] me, Lord of my forgetfulness. I lost my
[1:17:05] spot there. I deleted a slide there.
[1:17:07] Forgive me, Lord. But I believe your
[1:17:08] people understand. They can wait on you,
[1:17:10] Lord God. They can trust you, Lord God.
[1:17:12] Lord, we've heard a lot of scripture
[1:17:14] tonight, Lord God. A lot of quotes,
[1:17:16] Lord, uh by your grace trying to rightly
[1:17:19] divide the word of truth. I trust your
[1:17:21] people were
[1:17:23] blessed. And Father, as Paul told us in
[1:17:26] Romans 12, help us to wait upon our
[1:17:28] ministering, Lord God. Help us to wait
[1:17:30] upon our teaching, Lord. Wait upon our
[1:17:32] prophesying, whatever the gift may be.
[1:17:34] May we wait upon the Lord until we have
[1:17:37] strength to do it, Lord
[1:17:44] God. Lord, as we saw even in the
[1:17:46] scripture tonight, Lord, help us to be
[1:17:48] workers of righteousness, Lord God, and
[1:17:51] help us have the love of Jesus Christ in
[1:17:53] our hearts so that whatever we do, it
[1:17:56] will profit other people.
[1:17:59] Lord, how sister Naomi's uh gift of
[1:18:04] faith profited us, Lord God. That gave
[1:18:05] us a great security that God was with
[1:18:08] us. As my wife's word of knowledge for
[1:18:11] the preacher gave him a great
[1:18:12] consolation that he's in the will of
[1:18:14] God. He's not out of it, he's in it.
[1:18:16] Great gave him a great consolation that
[1:18:18] that you're with him, dear God.
[1:18:22] Lord, even me hearing those three
[1:18:23] tongues with even without
[1:18:26] interpretation, Lord, that gave me a
[1:18:27] great consolation, Lord God, that you're
[1:18:30] moving amongst
[1:18:31] us. So Lord, that's why we're thankful.
[1:18:34] That's why we want to give these
[1:18:35] testimonies of people being healed. And
[1:18:38] Lord, getting words of wisdom, word of
[1:18:40] knowledge, Lord, your spirit helping us
[1:18:41] out. We want to be mindful of these. And
[1:18:43] we want to give you thanks and praise
[1:18:45] when your spirit moves amongst us, Lord
[1:18:47] God. Hallelujah.
[1:18:49] Lord, we just want to be there when it
[1:18:51] happens, Lord God. We just want to be
[1:18:52] found faithful, Lord God. We want to
[1:18:55] hear those beautiful words, "Well done,
[1:18:57] thou good and faithful
[1:19:02] servant." Lord, may each person, Lord
[1:19:04] God, serve you with diligence, Lord. May
[1:19:07] we bring our bodies into subjection to
[1:19:09] the word of God. May we be consecrated
[1:19:11] that you can use us, Lord, for your
[1:19:13] glory, Lord God. Hallelujah, Jesus. Lord
[1:19:15] God. Hallelujah. Lord God, we thank you
[1:19:19] for tonight, Lord
[1:19:20] [Music]
[1:19:23] God. Lord, my prayer is Lord God that
[1:19:26] you would allow each person to see gifts
[1:19:28] manifest in their life, Lord
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:35] God. And of course, Lord, the greatest
[1:19:37] gift would be the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:40] Ghost, Lord, for a person to know
[1:19:41] they're born again, that something has
[1:19:43] happened to them. They are now a
[1:19:45] witness. They have power to be a witness
[1:19:47] that they didn't have before, Lord God.
[1:19:49] For Lord Jesus, that's what you said. Go
[1:19:51] up and tear in Jerusalem until you be
[1:19:54] endued with power from on high. And then
[1:19:56] you'll be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in
[1:19:59] Judea, and the uttermost parts of the
[1:20:01] earth, Lord
[1:20:03] God. Father, I want to be a witness here
[1:20:05] in Akran, in Doylestown. Lord, I want to
[1:20:07] be a witness where you place me, Lord
[1:20:08] God.
[1:20:10] Hallelujah. Lord, meet the needs of your
[1:20:12] people here tonight, Lord. We're so
[1:20:13] happy to be in your house, Lord. May we
[1:20:15] identify our gifts, Lord, and be
[1:20:17] faithful with
[1:20:19] them. And we appreciate the greatest
[1:20:21] gift, eternal life. May each one of us
[1:20:23] have that in Jesus
