[27:03] i'd like to look at music again tonight
[27:05] by god's grace i think this is part
[27:06] three
[27:11] and now let's go to ephesians 5 10.
[27:14] we'll start there that's kind of in the
[27:15] scripture i've used i preached on
[27:16] wednesday night i don't know if
[27:17] everybody got to listen to it or not but
[27:19] i'm gonna kind of review a little bit on
[27:22] that
[27:23] and then yesterday i found this little
[27:24] quote book from brother matt lightner
[27:26] i don't remember he made this years ago
[27:28] so i was reading through there this
[27:29] morning and highlighting some good
[27:30] quotes and
[27:33] you know writing some questions i have
[27:34] about you know some quotes and
[27:36] i need to read that so i'll be preaching
[27:38] more out of here
[27:39] lord willing but i forgot all about that
[27:41] and i just found uh yesterday so i thank
[27:43] the lord for that
[27:44] that was a real blessing here so let's
[27:46] go to ephesians
[27:47] 5 10.
[27:58] ephesians 5 10.
[28:02] this is a rather large subject uh this
[28:04] week i've listened to uh
[28:06] when ben narad preached it in the other
[28:08] sanctuary in 2016 i listened to that
[28:10] sermon i think about one and a half
[28:12] times
[28:13] as i was traveling and you know driving
[28:15] and things like that great message
[28:16] but it's such a huge tremendous subject
[28:19] so i'll just i'll go a little bit at a
[28:20] time
[28:22] and i'll be honest like i don't i don't
[28:24] naturally gravitate to this subject it's
[28:26] not like a
[28:26] i wouldn't say it's a easy subject for
[28:28] me to study
[28:30] because i just don't feel i'm very
[28:31] musically inclined uh
[28:34] never really have played any instruments
[28:36] or anything like that so
[28:37] just bear with me i'm trying my best to
[28:39] kind of learn
[28:41] slowly and uh and preach you know what
[28:43] the what i can
[28:44] clearly see i've always preached on the
[28:46] effects of music you know by the holy
[28:47] ghost you know i've always preached on
[28:49] that and
[28:49] how there's liberty in the holy spirit
[28:51] and uh things like that but trying to
[28:53] understand and
[28:54] and teach exactly what we can do you
[28:57] know
[28:58] to guard against rock and roll coming in
[29:00] and things like that
[29:01] that's all new to me so uh as far as you
[29:03] know trying to learn
[29:04] the language of music so uh just have
[29:07] patience with me
[29:09] it's it's more of a new subject it's a
[29:11] it's just a
[29:12] different kind of subject for me so
[29:14] ephesians 5 10.
[29:20] let's read that together just a short
[29:22] scripture let's read that on three one
[29:23] two three proving what is acceptable
[29:27] unto the lord and then remember go down
[29:29] to verse 18 and the bible said be
[29:31] filled with the spirit verse 19 speaking
[29:33] to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
[29:35] spiritual songs
[29:36] singing and making melody in your heart
[29:39] to the lord
[29:40] giving thanks we looked at that this
[29:41] morning right giving thanks always for
[29:43] all things
[29:44] amen unto god and the father in the name
[29:47] of our lord jesus christ
[29:49] may god add his blessings the ring of
[29:50] his word you may be seated
[29:57] i'm gonna do the very best i can as i
[29:59] said uh by god's grace
[30:02] you know let's do a little practice here
[30:03] let's do try the hdmi
[30:05] on this one because remember we had
[30:07] trouble last week when brother cam was
[30:08] here
[30:08] brother bank said he checked the cords
[30:10] and he said they were working
[30:12] so let's give that a shot and see if
[30:13] that'll work it'll be a hdmi cord i
[30:16] forgot to do it between services so just
[30:18] bear with me here
[30:24] let's try those uh so okay great all
[30:28] right well that hdmi is working so i
[30:30] don't know
[30:31] why we're having trouble with uh last
[30:34] week but anyways
[30:35] let's get started here
[30:39] now i want to give a few quick updates
[30:40] did you see uh
[30:42] there was two big announcements this
[30:44] week from the vatican never anybody see
[30:45] that
[30:46] i was thankful for joseph branham
[30:48] because he actually posted them on his
[30:50] email
[30:51] i saw him and i forgot about him and
[30:53] then i always get the voice of god
[30:54] emails right so i got joseph's email
[30:57] and uh he had he had him in there and i
[30:59] was like oh thank the lord i forgot all
[31:00] about it
[31:01] so i appreciate our brother you know we
[31:03] just we have differences but
[31:04] that was really helpful so let's read
[31:06] let's read that so they have two they
[31:08] put out two
[31:09] declarations this week just really
[31:12] really something
[31:13] oh is that is that okay is that mine
[31:16] okay so the first declaration which this
[31:19] one was extremely sad
[31:21] they said it's okay to get the vaccine
[31:24] uh
[31:24] even though it has i don't know how to
[31:27] say it here
[31:28] vaccines have uh
[31:33] i'm not sure how to say it with the
[31:35] children there but anyways there's a lot
[31:37] of things in vaccines we
[31:39] we don't want in our bodies
[31:42] that come from the abortion industry i
[31:44] guess that's maybe the best way i can
[31:45] say it
[31:47] and who is aware of that because she
[31:49] worked in the medical field and would
[31:50] saw
[31:51] the ingredients in vaccines and it's
[31:54] really sad it come
[31:55] a lot of their ingredients come from the
[31:57] abortion industry so
[31:59] a lot of catholics were up in arms about
[32:01] the covid vaccine right
[32:03] well the vatican put out a declaration
[32:06] this week
[32:06] saying they are allowed to have it
[32:07] because there's no other options
[32:09] now i think that is just downright sad
[32:12] and
[32:13] hypocritical but uh let me see if i can
[32:16] pull up the
[32:17] just the the beginning of the the
[32:19] article real quick so that everybody can
[32:21] see that
[32:22] here's the one we'll get to
[32:25] i like to keep uh yeah i don't know if
[32:29] i'm going to read that but
[32:31] the vatican says use a covered vaccines
[32:33] made from
[32:34] abortion industry is ethical
[32:37] and that's sad church and that's so sad
[32:40] they're so against
[32:41] those things supposedly against those
[32:43] things but then they'll let those things
[32:45] come into their bodies
[32:48] so just something to watch i mean look
[32:49] at i mean every now and then like we
[32:51] right we see their true colors right we
[32:53] see their true signs
[32:54] we saw it earlier this year remember oh
[32:57] we saw a few months ago when the pope
[32:59] come out and said homosexuality's okay
[33:01] he said they're all part of god's family
[33:03] they're all part of our family
[33:05] so see every now and then you know
[33:06] behind this pompous religious thing
[33:09] every now and then we see their true
[33:10] colors and this is one more example of
[33:13] that where they would compromise on such
[33:16] a clear black and white thing this is
[33:18] totally wrong
[33:19] right but they say there's no other
[33:21] options so it's okay
[33:22] it's not okay so i just thought i'd
[33:24] share that with you just to kind of keep
[33:26] you posted on that one
[33:27] and here's the other one this one was
[33:29] more in the economic realm
[33:31] um so here's the article from brother
[33:34] joseph
[33:36] uh but then here's the article big
[33:39] business gets its wings as leaders from
[33:41] major u.s companies partner
[33:43] with pope francis i'm not going to read
[33:45] the whole article
[33:46] but many uh big business companies met
[33:49] with the pope this week i think it was
[33:51] this week
[33:53] no i'm sorry it was a couple weeks ago
[33:54] december 8th i'm sorry it was december
[33:56] 8th
[33:56] so it was more than a couple weeks ago
[33:58] and he met with them just trying to
[34:00] encourage them
[34:01] uh you know to help i just helped the
[34:04] economy let's just i'll read that first
[34:06] part the pope means business
[34:08] uh capitalism met with catholicism on
[34:10] tuesday as some of the world's biggest
[34:12] business leaders announced a new
[34:13] partnership with pope francis
[34:15] the alliance known as the council for
[34:16] inclusive capitalism with the vatican
[34:18] aims create a more inclusive fair and
[34:21] sustainable economic landscape by taking
[34:23] pledges toward
[34:24] sustainable development goals focused on
[34:27] areas such as climate action
[34:28] peace and justice quality education and
[34:32] gender equality
[34:34] so you see they're partners partnering
[34:36] with companies and remember the bible
[34:37] said the antichrist
[34:39] is going to bring prosperity he said
[34:42] daniel said he's going to increase the
[34:43] the crafts and make crafts to prosper
[34:46] and remember he's going to have this
[34:48] message brother brown called him the
[34:49] superman right
[34:50] he got that from clarence larkin satan's
[34:51] superman he's going to promise
[34:54] peace and safety and prosperity so it's
[34:56] just interesting that he's
[34:58] meeting with these uh these companies i
[35:01] think their value
[35:02] is over 10 trillion so the value of
[35:03] these companies was 10
[35:05] trillion dollars um so just
[35:08] it's a sign right that we can see how
[35:10] the pope is going to be
[35:12] involved in world finances right and
[35:14] that's what we're told in the book of
[35:15] daniel by god's grace
[35:17] so i just thought i'd share those with
[35:18] you there um
[35:20] kind of give you an update i i like to
[35:22] do that
[35:23] so everybody can kind of uh stay up to
[35:25] date on what's going on
[35:27] uh you know you hear many times but
[35:28] church we're living in the days of the
[35:30] bible times praise god
[35:31] bible prophecies being fulfilled before
[35:33] our eyes both out in the world
[35:35] as the tares are maturing but as the
[35:37] bride is maturing as well
[35:39] amen i'm glad to be a a wheat seed
[35:41] maturing praise god
[35:43] hallelujah and i want to lay before the
[35:44] presence of the son and i'm going to
[35:46] bring forth
[35:47] uh the right fruit i want to i want to i
[35:50] want to manifest a true wheat nature by
[35:52] god's grace
[35:53] amen now as we look at this music here
[35:56] again these are the same four references
[35:58] i read on wednesday
[36:00] i'm going to look at this one towards
[36:01] the end of the message here because i'm
[36:02] going to play some examples of
[36:04] brother rams music here
[36:07] or just some songs on the tapes but this
[36:10] is
[36:11] a tremendous message i text brother
[36:13] brother ben on christmas on my brother
[36:15] this was an absolute masterpiece of the
[36:16] holy ghost i'm still it's four years
[36:18] later i'm still
[36:19] i'm still feasting on that message it
[36:21] was such a great message
[36:22] um and then the seven part series this
[36:25] is uh
[36:26] this is more like a biblical approach to
[36:28] music and then this one
[36:30] this one really shows it actually gives
[36:32] a lot of samples of worldly music so i
[36:33] said on wednesday
[36:35] i said if you struggle with worldly
[36:37] music i wouldn't recommend listening to
[36:38] all that one
[36:39] because he does play like longer samples
[36:42] just to show the difference between
[36:44] worldly music and godly music right
[36:47] but there's a lot of great information
[36:48] on that one too and then sister rebecca
[36:50] wrote an article in 1992
[36:52] i've read through a lot of it not all of
[36:54] it but i've read through i think
[36:56] eight chapters i think it's nine or ten
[36:58] chapters so i'm almost done reading
[36:59] through that one so
[37:01] by god's grace those are the references
[37:02] i'm going to use and i always want to
[37:04] give references because i know people
[37:06] criticize you if you don't and i i don't
[37:08] want to take any credit for anything
[37:09] because i'm just i'm just getting it
[37:11] from other places you know
[37:13] so let me just review real quick here uh
[37:15] we looked at our first two parts god
[37:16] created music
[37:17] the book of zephaniah said god sings
[37:20] over his people
[37:21] so god sings angels sing right
[37:26] job tells us that and then jesus said
[37:29] jesus quoted the psalms and then jesus
[37:31] sang hymns
[37:32] right after the lord's supper uh the
[37:35] passover meal right before the night of
[37:37] his crew or arrest
[37:39] now lucifer was created with a music
[37:42] ministry the bible said he had pipes
[37:45] which are tambourines
[37:47] in the translation so he'll always make
[37:50] worship music that's
[37:51] a little worldly right it's so close to
[37:54] the real
[37:56] to try to deceive the very elect right
[38:00] but the elect cannot be deceived we know
[38:02] there's nothing wrong with a tambourine
[38:03] right i really appreciate a good
[38:04] tambourine player
[38:06] so lydia acacia some of you can yeah
[38:07] sister who somebody
[38:09] some of you that can keep a beat i
[38:10] admire that because i cannot i tried it
[38:12] for a number of years in the church i
[38:14] just couldn't get it i
[38:14] don't i guess i probably should have
[38:16] practiced more but uh
[38:18] you know so so satan is very aware of
[38:20] the right
[38:21] pleasing kind of music to god uh and of
[38:24] course he'll always have his like
[38:26] death metal bands right he always have
[38:28] his rap music out there
[38:30] but he's always also going to be trying
[38:32] to do inside the christian realm
[38:34] to try to get something so close but
[38:36] then to inject something into it a
[38:38] little sensual
[38:40] and so that's what you know we'll be
[38:42] looking at hopefully the next few
[38:43] services
[38:44] uh is that sensual aspect and you'll
[38:46] hear it
[38:47] many times you'll hear it uh musicians
[38:50] they'll make their voice sensual
[38:51] right uh you can tell they're not really
[38:54] singing to jesus they're singing more to
[38:56] be popular
[38:57] but there's so many areas music has so
[38:59] many different elements that
[39:00] satan's only got to change one of them
[39:03] just one of them
[39:04] if he can just make one of them like the
[39:06] rhythm
[39:07] if he just overpowers on the rhythm or
[39:09] if he just overpowers with too much
[39:11] noise right
[39:12] or if he just overpowers on the
[39:14] percussion or if he just overpowers on
[39:17] uh the sensual voice and so we always
[39:21] need god's help
[39:22] uh to give us a good balance and i think
[39:25] we got it by god's grace i love brother
[39:26] amen and
[39:27] i really appreciate your ministry better
[39:28] it's a tremendous blessing
[39:30] uh and so um
[39:35] this is where satan is gonna try to do
[39:37] with with us now with the world he's
[39:39] always gonna have his worldly music
[39:40] right
[39:41] but he's going to try to get us to do a
[39:43] little bit of worldliness we got to be
[39:44] careful
[39:45] now the the thing of it the the danger i
[39:48] see around the message is so many people
[39:50] just do slow slow music there's no joy
[39:53] in it after a while
[39:54] right that's what i see i don't know i
[39:56] don't know if our saints and friends
[39:57] have seen that or not but
[39:59] when i sometimes visit churches they're
[40:00] just there's no
[40:02] every song is so slow that people are
[40:06] sleeping during the song service or
[40:09] there's no joy but on wednesday night i
[40:11] read through all the scriptures where it
[40:12] says
[40:12] sing a new song and they all say sing
[40:15] with joy
[40:16] so where's the joy you know so
[40:19] what i think is satan's trying to keep
[40:21] with many message churches he's trying
[40:22] to keep him so far away from maybe
[40:25] any upbeat or any uplifting type of
[40:27] music
[40:28] that he gets them so dead that there's
[40:31] no joy in it anymore
[40:34] now don't get me wrong there's also a
[40:35] very quiet worship
[40:37] song that it can just bring just as much
[40:39] joy right just as much thankfulness
[40:42] but the thing is uh we got to be careful
[40:45] with that we don't want to get
[40:46] too close we don't want to get close at
[40:48] all to rock and roll but we don't want
[40:50] to go so
[40:50] far away from from any joy in the song
[40:53] or any upbeat part of it
[40:54] where uh there's no joy there's no
[40:57] rejoicing right
[40:58] because the bible plainly says rejoice
[41:01] with your songs
[41:02] so we went over that on wednesdays they
[41:04] went through like probably 11
[41:06] verses just about new songs and having
[41:08] joy
[41:09] and praising god with loud voices and
[41:12] praising god with
[41:13] uplifted voices amen and loud the bible
[41:15] said loudly on the symbols
[41:17] loudly with the stringed instruments the
[41:19] bible tells us to
[41:20] sing joyfully praise god and so that's
[41:23] where we got it we gotta have and i
[41:25] believe we're in the middle of the road
[41:26] um and if i thought different we'd
[41:29] straighten it out you know brother eamon
[41:30] and i would sit down and
[41:32] he'd teach me some things about music
[41:35] because i don't know much about music
[41:37] but but the point i'm trying to make is
[41:38] that we we have to be careful
[41:40] now remember this too by god's grace
[41:44] brother braham saw the preview of the
[41:45] bride remember the the church that got
[41:47] off was dancing to rock and roll right
[41:50] and so we know that's that's what
[41:52] satan's going to use against the church
[41:53] in the u.s but it's probably worldwide
[41:55] by now right
[41:56] you know what i mean like all the
[41:58] churches are trying to impersonate
[42:00] uh the american church that's in the
[42:01] rock and roll so we know specifically
[42:04] we've got to be very cautious against
[42:06] rock and roll
[42:07] right and we'll get to that a little bit
[42:09] how there's certain instruments rock and
[42:10] rollers use
[42:11] and there's certain rhythms and certain
[42:14] beats they use and we just gotta avoid
[42:16] that and if we if we avoid that and we
[42:18] sing godly songs with the right lyrics
[42:20] and joy in our hearts
[42:22] and uh and uplifting songs that have
[42:25] godly lyrics that we know it's the
[42:27] freedom of a christian to enjoy those
[42:28] songs
[42:29] praise god amen so we got to be very
[42:33] careful because satan's
[42:34] he's a master at deception right he's a
[42:37] master at it and we've got to be very
[42:38] careful
[42:39] so that's what the holy spirit gives us
[42:41] discernment to know praise god
[42:43] now we looked at also that choosing to
[42:46] sing
[42:47] god's music music helps us walk in the
[42:49] spear that was what we just looked at
[42:51] earlier
[42:52] right by our text so we've got to choose
[42:53] to sing god's music
[42:55] and i like this from our hearts i
[42:57] believe the bible said make a melody in
[42:58] your heart to the lord
[43:01] and so like a lot of like the famous uh
[43:03] christian singers you can tell
[43:05] some of them are always singing for the
[43:07] lord
[43:08] like you can kind of hear their voices
[43:10] where they're singing just to be heard
[43:13] they're not really singing as a worship
[43:16] and that's why i love coming to church
[43:17] because i know i'm going to hear a song
[43:18] that worships god from the heart to god
[43:22] praise god but we've all seen you know
[43:25] famous musicians or we've all heard them
[43:27] when
[43:27] you can tell they're not really singing
[43:29] to god they're singing to make
[43:30] themselves famous
[43:32] and it's not truly worship
[43:35] and a lot of times i can a lot of times
[43:38] i can tell after the song is done
[43:40] like if they'll just smile and accept
[43:41] everybody's clapping you know what i
[43:43] mean like
[43:44] if you're singing for jesus you should
[43:45] be praising you know you should be
[43:46] praising jesus or humble
[43:48] right but some of these people sit there
[43:50] and clap and say
[43:51] oh thank you i mean come on that's the
[43:54] that's not singing in your heart to the
[43:56] lord that's singing to impress the
[43:57] people
[43:59] especially you see that on the live
[44:00] recordings when they sing live and
[44:02] everybody just clap and thank you yes
[44:05] thank you and
[44:06] throw the roses at me thank you and to
[44:09] me that's not
[44:10] to me that's not singing to christ
[44:13] because remember like brother i said
[44:14] with the preacher you want to come up
[44:15] humbly
[44:16] so you can leave happy right but he said
[44:19] many people come up
[44:20] uh proudly and then they leave sad
[44:24] right so we want to come up humbly and
[44:26] i'll say like this we want to go down
[44:27] humbly too
[44:29] okay so there's uh that scripture about
[44:31] singing your heart to the lord
[44:32] and now the bible says we need to
[44:34] identify the sounds and make ours
[44:36] easy to be understood praise god
[44:40] and so that's that's our desire too is
[44:42] our songs should always be easily
[44:44] understood to be
[44:45] christian songs praise god hallelujah
[44:50] now next um now we saw this
[44:53] on wednesday new songs can be loud or
[44:56] they can be quiet
[44:58] uh they can be songs of repentance right
[45:00] like dave that great example of
[45:02] creating me a clean heart oh god you
[45:04] know renew a steadfast spirit within me
[45:06] all right there's songs that are god i'm
[45:08] sorry forgive me jesus
[45:09] but then there's songs that you your
[45:11] sins washed away and you're happy now
[45:13] you're you're you're full of joy i'm
[45:15] forgiven i'm under the blood of the lamb
[45:17] of god amen
[45:18] so see there's there's there's times and
[45:21] seasons for all the all the kind
[45:22] different different songs right
[45:24] but the bible did say the new songs
[45:26] should be sung worldwide the bible said
[45:28] let all the world
[45:29] sing new songs unto the lord and i
[45:33] ended with this i ended part two on
[45:35] wednesday with this singing is
[45:37] contacting your heavenly home because
[45:38] brother graham said your body contacts
[45:41] your earthly home
[45:42] but then he said faith contacts god
[45:46] so when we start singing uh we're
[45:48] actually trying to contact
[45:50] our heavenly home right we're reaching
[45:53] out to god
[45:54] uh and so that that's important to
[45:57] remember a song is a
[45:59] trying to contact heaven lord i need
[46:01] your power lord i want to worship you
[46:03] and
[46:04] because remember he inhabits the praises
[46:07] so we don't always feel it maybe when we
[46:09] start but the goal
[46:11] is to contact him so that he's we feel
[46:14] his presence in our worship praise god
[46:17] because he inhabits the praises of his
[46:19] people amen
[46:21] hallelujah so that's the goal singing is
[46:24] to
[46:24] contact the spiritual world which in our
[46:27] case is the holy spirit
[46:29] now the world uses to contact the
[46:32] demonic spirit world
[46:34] right but we're using our spirits and
[46:37] songs
[46:38] to contact heaven amen
[46:41] so see worship is an invitation so i'm
[46:43] just trying to find
[46:44] in my mind like what is singing it's an
[46:47] invitation for god's anointing or the
[46:49] world they do satan's
[46:51] anointing because the bible tells us
[46:53] neither give place to the devil
[46:55] in ephesians uh 4 27.
[46:59] all right so now i narrowed this down i
[47:01] don't know if you saw or i mentioned it
[47:03] wednesday but i just narrowed this down
[47:04] we have three important duties and there
[47:06] could be more
[47:08] uh but i'm just trying to teach this or
[47:10] like i said this is a subject that's
[47:12] more challenging for me i don't easily
[47:14] grasp
[47:15] music concepts but we have the duties to
[47:18] introduce new songs
[47:20] and we have the duty to create the right
[47:23] atmosphere when
[47:24] we sing right we got to sing from our
[47:26] heart it's got to be worship it's got to
[47:27] be about lifting up jesus
[47:29] praise god and we and brother braham
[47:31] says you and i
[47:32] are supposed to create that atmosphere
[47:34] praise god right just like we saw with
[47:36] prayer
[47:37] you've got we not we have to create the
[47:39] atmosphere of thanksgiving praise god
[47:41] amen we have to create the atmosphere of
[47:43] peace in our own lives
[47:45] right that's what keeps our hearts and
[47:46] minds is the peace of god that we create
[47:48] through prayer
[47:49] the same thing's true with music we have
[47:51] to create an atmosphere here praise god
[47:54] amen hallelujah
[47:57] it is through singing the right way
[47:59] right it's singing with joy it's singing
[48:01] with
[48:01] worship it's singing with praise to god
[48:04] it's our duty brother brother man says
[48:06] don't sit there like a wall flower on
[48:08] the wall
[48:09] he says when you come to church he said
[48:10] become a part of it he said get right
[48:12] into it amen
[48:14] he said become a part of the service
[48:16] amen have you take your part
[48:17] take your position amen amen so we've
[48:20] got to do that we've got to create the
[48:21] right atmosphere
[48:23] and for me that means to me that means
[48:25] clapping singing smiling and standing up
[48:28] praising the lord shouting you know what
[48:30] i got to feel it and so i got to enter
[48:32] in
[48:33] and i gotta get my mind on the things of
[48:35] god
[48:36] i gotta feel it praise god
[48:39] and then thirdly uh this
[48:43] is this is what's gonna take the the
[48:44] longest for me to study out so
[48:46] just be patient with me i have to prove
[48:50] what's acceptable to god with rhythms
[48:53] this is totally new to me lyrics that to
[48:56] me that's easy that's the easy part
[48:58] right we can all look at lyrics and say
[49:00] okay that's scriptural
[49:01] that's not scriptural volume
[49:05] and that's a little bit uh i mean
[49:07] there's there's room there to take it
[49:08] loud too
[49:09] because i've been in some real loud
[49:10] services that have been real people got
[49:12] healed and
[49:13] you know saved and all kinds of great
[49:15] things
[49:16] and then instruments that's another one
[49:18] too where some you just got to use
[49:19] wisdom
[49:20] uh and you you prove it's acceptable in
[49:23] all these areas by identifying
[49:25] the meanings of the sounds so that's
[49:28] what the bible says remember every sound
[49:30] has a
[49:30] meaning okay
[49:34] and so let me just share of just a few
[49:36] things just from my heart here okay
[49:40] rhythm we're going to we're going to
[49:41] show you some um let you listen to that
[49:43] one song i was there when the spirit
[49:45] came we'll listen to that a little bit
[49:46] that one has a more fast beat rhythm and
[49:48] brother graham calls it a spiritual lift
[49:50] okay now there's some things with rhythm
[49:53] i'm not sure about like
[49:55] uh like clapping off beat
[49:58] okay uh but we've been to services where
[50:01] they've clapped off beat and i kind of
[50:02] like it
[50:04] you know i i think that's that's kind of
[50:05] that feels makes me happy
[50:08] makes me want to worship but rock and
[50:10] roll is known for playing like guitar
[50:12] beats and drum beats off-beat
[50:15] and there's some connection to that with
[50:17] voodoo
[50:18] so from what i understand now there's
[50:20] some offbeats that are okay
[50:22] and there's some offbeats that are not
[50:23] okay
[50:25] that's what i understand right now so
[50:27] i'm i'm not ready to preach all that
[50:29] and give you examples right now but
[50:31] that's where i want to go i want to go
[50:33] to that
[50:34] so you can actually hear some off beats
[50:37] that are right that are okay and then
[50:39] some beats that are not okay
[50:42] all right now the same thing is true
[50:44] with lyrics now some people say
[50:45] oh the lyrics if they don't mention the
[50:47] name of jesus or
[50:49] or god or lord then you can't sing them
[50:51] well that might be but there's also a
[50:53] song like you ever heard that song you
[50:54] raised me up by sayla
[50:56] you raised me up so i can stand on my
[51:00] i mean i've heard that's we sang that in
[51:02] in lima when i was going to live when
[51:03] brother brooks is my pastor
[51:04] and the song never says god one time in
[51:06] it
[51:08] so see some people make these strict
[51:10] rigid rules right like oh don't say the
[51:12] name of god
[51:13] so you can't sing it well i
[51:17] i think if our hearts are pure and we
[51:18] know who wrote it and if we can we can
[51:20] find
[51:21] some uh some connection to scripture in
[51:24] the lyrics that's okay
[51:26] now for me if i don't hear the name of
[51:27] jesus i like to insert the name of jesus
[51:30] like that king of my heart song he's
[51:31] saying did you notice how i'm inserting
[51:33] the name
[51:33] i just like to hear the name of jesus
[51:35] praise god i think it's a fine song
[51:37] it's very scriptural uh you can find all
[51:40] those scriptures about christ we run to
[51:42] christ he's our high tower you know
[51:44] we sh we hide under the shadow of his
[51:46] wings like that's that's
[51:47] plain scripture but to me
[51:51] i like to hear the name of jesus uh so
[51:54] many times
[51:54] i'll add the name of jesus i'll just
[51:57] insert it in there if i don't hear it
[51:59] enough
[52:00] so just so you know and that's that's my
[52:03] preference
[52:04] right but i believe you can sing that
[52:06] song and you
[52:07] without adding that and you can still
[52:09] worship the lord with that song i
[52:10] believe that
[52:12] but for me i like to if i can i like to
[52:14] add the name of jesus in there
[52:16] now volume like i said there's times for
[52:18] quiet songs and people are like brother
[52:20] i remember when you do prayer lines he'd
[52:21] say just play something soft
[52:24] right but because the people are
[52:26] repenting
[52:27] right they're trying to ask the holy
[52:29] spirit help me to remember if i've
[52:30] sinned against you and
[52:32] right but then there's times i'll listen
[52:34] tonight brother brown he would clap
[52:36] along and he would sing and
[52:38] meeting in the air and all these fast
[52:39] songs he'd like there's a time to clap
[52:42] he
[52:42] brother man tells them to stomp their
[52:43] feet there's a time to stop there
[52:45] there's a time for slow and there's a
[52:47] time for fast songs
[52:50] okay so it's all about really finding
[52:52] the leadership of the holy spirit
[52:54] for that particular time praise god but
[52:57] like i said i've been in services where
[52:59] it's been like at brother cams that's
[53:01] that's what i'm really talking about
[53:03] where we'll they would have loud music
[53:05] and we would just be you know
[53:07] we're everybody worshiping and yet
[53:09] people are getting healed and saved
[53:10] you know so those are good examples
[53:13] sometimes it's
[53:14] quiet sometimes it's loud but the thing
[53:18] with the world is as you know i
[53:19] at rock concerts now i don't think i've
[53:21] ever really been to one i've only been
[53:22] to christian rock concerts
[53:24] and that's before i was in the message
[53:26] but yes they did crank up the volume
[53:28] too high and there's one thing about
[53:30] when it gets too loud then you lose your
[53:32] thinking and you just
[53:33] your bot your your sensual uh
[53:36] your sensual is your body's just taken
[53:39] over by the music and you
[53:40] you lose your train of thought like when
[53:43] we were there we were like head banging
[53:45] anyone ever heard a third day they're
[53:48] like a a christian rock group
[53:49] okay so before i came in the message i
[53:51] went to a third day concert and we just
[53:53] had bang the whole two hours
[53:55] forgive me you know uh
[53:58] i'm not proud of that but i'm just
[54:00] saying that's all i knew
[54:02] at least i was in a bar right there was
[54:05] only one time i was in a line
[54:06] you know even even as a sinner i was in
[54:08] a line one time to go into a bar
[54:10] and i got halfway up the line and i had
[54:12] to leave and i never he went into a bar
[54:15] that's how much god was like i believe
[54:17] he was watching over my life
[54:18] and all my friends are like in college
[54:20] all my friends are like where'd you go
[54:21] jesse what are you
[54:22] i'm like i just couldn't go into the bar
[54:25] that was even before i was a christian
[54:27] so i thank the lord for protecting me
[54:28] that far
[54:30] but uh so if it's too loud
[54:34] you can lose control but also i've been
[54:36] in loud services where people have
[54:38] danced in the spirit and that's good
[54:40] that's great that could be a good thing
[54:44] uh so again it's it's it's about finding
[54:47] uh what god is doing
[54:49] and then instruments now we'll get to
[54:51] this one i have an article at the end
[54:53] uh rock and roll's main instruments
[54:56] are electric guitar bass guitar and
[54:58] drums
[55:00] those are the three main instruments but
[55:02] yeah i know churches you know that use
[55:04] some of those and
[55:06] they can be used okay as long as they're
[55:08] used in the right way
[55:10] right um and there's a lot of clear
[55:13] examples you know
[55:15] uh when you listen to music so
[55:18] again it takes a lot of wisdom right it
[55:21] takes a lot of
[55:22] uh discernment by the holy spirit right
[55:25] to identify the different
[55:26] meanings of sounds okay so let's go
[55:30] through this a little bit here
[55:31] i want to read just a couple more so you
[55:33] can see how music helped out brother
[55:35] branham
[55:36] and uh and then i want to play that song
[55:38] so you can hear it
[55:40] so singing this contacting god
[55:44] and receiving his strength uh the and
[55:46] this is like the power of music
[55:48] is this one of my favorite quotes of all
[55:51] time
[55:52] with brother branham sometimes i get
[55:54] kind of feeling tired
[55:55] and wore out and nerves on the edge we
[55:57] talked about anxious right don't be
[55:59] anxious
[56:01] i'll just jump in my car take out
[56:05] hold to the steering wheel can you see
[56:08] brother i'm doing this
[56:09] going down the road singing i'm so glad
[56:12] i can say
[56:12] i'm one of them or something just
[56:15] gripping
[56:16] the wheel and singing and stomping my
[56:18] foot and shouting
[56:20] i'm one of them i'm one of them
[56:26] he says well after a while i get tired
[56:29] and i return back home
[56:30] and start something else he said but
[56:33] when we get worshipping god in that new
[56:35] kingdom there will never be a tired
[56:36] moment
[56:39] so he so he felt like he was in a rut
[56:41] right he's tired he's worn out he's
[56:43] anxious
[56:44] so he'd get in the car and start singing
[56:46] god
[56:47] singing to god and loudly getting his
[56:48] foot going and he said oh i can go home
[56:50] and start something new
[56:55] so see sometimes he hadn't even had to
[56:56] leave the home to get refreshed
[56:58] you know i imagine because all the
[57:00] people sitting outside wanting to be
[57:01] prayed for probably you know just
[57:03] you know people would sleep on his porch
[57:05] people would sleep in the yard and
[57:07] uh but i just want you to see this like
[57:09] see and it was okay
[57:10] it's okay church to get our bodies
[57:12] involved in the worship praise god like
[57:14] he realized that music when you play it
[57:17] it does something to your body and you
[57:19] want to join in you know
[57:21] now the evil of it is when satan uses
[57:23] certain kind of a notes
[57:25] with electric guitar and bass guitar
[57:27] right
[57:28] who use certain kind of notes to take
[57:30] that go too far
[57:32] right and they actually have proof
[57:33] brother ben brought out some quotes i
[57:35] don't know if you listened that lately
[57:36] but brother brother brandon brought out
[57:38] some quotes from the scientific world
[57:40] where they can prove it
[57:41] certain types of music on electric
[57:43] guitar get your hormones flowing for
[57:45] like
[57:46] uh immorality the same uh
[57:51] the same type of hormones for
[57:54] immorality i guess i just say like that
[57:56] sexual morality let me just say like
[57:58] that
[57:59] okay so there are certain notes they can
[58:01] play with the electric guitar and bass
[58:03] guitar that release those hormones
[58:05] right they they can prove that and
[58:08] that's like that voodoo that's the same
[58:10] type of voodoo beats and rhythms right
[58:13] uh but there must be a way to do it
[58:16] where brotherhood says you can stomp
[58:17] your feet and clap and
[58:19] and shout and praise the lord where it's
[58:21] okay
[58:22] and it doesn't activate those hormones
[58:25] but it makes your body want to move and
[58:27] join in
[58:28] with the worship praise god
[58:33] so that's one of my favorites there i
[58:35] like that when
[58:36] you get tired so see sometimes when
[58:38] you're tired your mind is tired and this
[58:39] is what brother ben brought out too
[58:41] he said your brain has two parts one the
[58:43] thinking part and then
[58:44] uh the other part uh just like the
[58:47] praise
[58:47] the relaxing part he said that when you
[58:49] when you sing it
[58:50] your body is your mind is supposed to
[58:52] stop thinking and calculating and just
[58:54] to relax
[58:56] and that's what he was i don't know if
[58:56] you remember that but he was saying
[58:58] that's why god gave us music so we'd
[59:00] stop
[59:01] uh try for a little bit trying to figure
[59:03] things out and worry and
[59:05] and get outside of that part of our
[59:06] brain and get into the happy side
[59:09] amen and so part of that is getting your
[59:12] body
[59:12] into it right letting the the music you
[59:15] know just
[59:15] uh take care take control your body and
[59:18] worshiping and praising god
[59:20] uh stomping your feet clapping and
[59:22] shouting and praising the lord
[59:24] and rejoicing in god's spirit amen
[59:29] so he says of course he said uh he said
[59:31] we are so happy so he's basically
[59:33] talking about the millennium there the
[59:34] new kingdom
[59:35] there'll never be a tired moment uh he
[59:38] says we are so happy praise god so i
[59:39] hope
[59:40] that's a help to you here's and this is
[59:41] what it reminded me of uh we
[59:44] you know we're familiar with this how
[59:46] the bible says when the evil spirit was
[59:48] upon saul david took a harp
[59:50] play with his hands so saul was
[59:52] refreshed and was well
[59:53] and the evil spirit departed him
[59:57] okay so see how brother brown is
[59:59] discouraged he's tired he's anxious
[1:00:01] but once he gets his body and his mind
[1:00:03] into it and he shout once he gets his
[1:00:05] voice into it he breaks out of it
[1:00:08] so you see that's why we entering into
[1:00:10] worship is so important
[1:00:12] right entering into god's spirit see
[1:00:14] we're reaching out to god god i need you
[1:00:16] god change my thinking help me not to be
[1:00:18] so discouraged
[1:00:19] let me take take all my stress god bring
[1:00:22] your peace
[1:00:22] and god brings his peace
[1:00:26] here's another good one you'll like uh
[1:00:30] and look at this one today's been a
[1:00:32] terrible day for me
[1:00:34] anybody said that this week oh it's been
[1:00:36] a terrible day
[1:00:37] man brother man's at the pulpit church
[1:00:39] and he said today's been terrible
[1:00:42] and so many calls and so forth and the
[1:00:44] phones are ringing everywhere
[1:00:47] and as i walked in here brother mercer
[1:00:49] said i can tell you're nervous
[1:00:51] and i said who wouldn't it be
[1:00:55] you see our moms and dads if they're
[1:00:57] getting pulled on all day see how you
[1:00:58] can be a little nervous
[1:01:01] but now i'm quiet
[1:01:04] just the singing and relaxing i just
[1:01:07] love that
[1:01:09] i feel if we could just say amen and go
[1:01:11] home
[1:01:12] it would pay every one of us to have
[1:01:14] been here in this wonderful
[1:01:15] atmosphere so constant ringing
[1:01:19] right like with our phones constant
[1:01:21] buzzing and notifications it can be it
[1:01:23] can feel like a terrible day
[1:01:25] but just get in the right atmosphere of
[1:01:27] worship
[1:01:28] and your day can change
[1:01:31] because it's the atmosphere if we're
[1:01:33] nervous
[1:01:34] if we're stressed out the atmosphere can
[1:01:37] help us relax
[1:01:38] and forget about our terrible day see
[1:01:40] how this is just like the bible right
[1:01:42] it's just like david playing for saul
[1:01:44] terrible oh it's awful day oh but now i
[1:01:48] feel much better
[1:01:49] because i'm in the atmosphere of the
[1:01:50] holy spirit
[1:01:52] praise god well i'll tell you you're
[1:01:55] certainly blessed with some real singing
[1:01:57] he said i like good singing i just love
[1:02:00] real good singing
[1:02:01] i've always said when i get to heaven i
[1:02:02] want to get where they're singing and
[1:02:04] listen i can never get my
[1:02:05] fill of singing
[1:02:09] i love that one you know singing gives
[1:02:12] courage
[1:02:13] so see that's why it's reaching out for
[1:02:15] spiritual power singing is reach is
[1:02:17] invitation i need spiritual power
[1:02:20] you know that don't you soldiers you're
[1:02:22] going to battle you know what they do
[1:02:23] they
[1:02:24] they play the music and sing and things
[1:02:26] to give them courage and when you're
[1:02:27] going on to battle we sing
[1:02:29] and it gives us courage to go on
[1:02:32] hallelujah anybody uh ever been
[1:02:36] encouraged by a song
[1:02:37] maybe it came at a certain time when you
[1:02:39] needed a song
[1:02:40] about that i told the testimony on
[1:02:43] wednesday i don't know if you heard
[1:02:44] someone tell tonight i was at the
[1:02:46] woman's
[1:02:46] uh i was at the sisters meeting up in
[1:02:48] new york and they were doing song
[1:02:50] specials and a sister came up
[1:02:53] and she started playing some sweet notes
[1:02:55] before she sang
[1:02:56] and she said i wrote this song when i
[1:02:58] was going through the trial of my life
[1:03:01] um and in the situation this sister was
[1:03:04] being abused by her husband now she was
[1:03:06] since divorced
[1:03:08] um she was being abused by her husband
[1:03:11] and uh and everybody she started playing
[1:03:14] singing it was one of the most beautiful
[1:03:15] songs
[1:03:16] you'd want to hear and every eye i was
[1:03:18] crying everybody was crying in the whole
[1:03:20] in the whole service um
[1:03:25] but it was such a it was such an example
[1:03:28] of it was such a song of hope like it
[1:03:31] was just so
[1:03:32] showing how god never left her and she
[1:03:35] was never alone
[1:03:36] and god was able to bring her out and
[1:03:38] give her hope and protect her and save
[1:03:40] her basically
[1:03:42] and uh it just gave her a lot of courage
[1:03:44] and she said she got this song
[1:03:47] going through that storm right and so
[1:03:50] many times church will get a song
[1:03:52] uh in the midst of a storm praise god
[1:03:55] and god will send a right song
[1:03:57] at the right time when you need it
[1:03:59] praise god
[1:04:00] amen
[1:04:04] so see singing will give you courage
[1:04:05] then you look at the person well my if
[1:04:07] that if that person could get victory
[1:04:10] uh i can get victory too that gives me
[1:04:13] courage to keep going on
[1:04:15] because a song that god placed in their
[1:04:17] hearts
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:22] he said jim i want to be sure get that
[1:04:24] for me so he's requesting a tape of the
[1:04:26] song
[1:04:27] put it on that for me special so my
[1:04:29] children want to hear that
[1:04:30] when i kind of get down a little low i
[1:04:33] hear that it makes me feel good
[1:04:35] to hear good singing and billy i go to
[1:04:38] the office down there and he has
[1:04:40] constantly got them tapes of singing
[1:04:41] going on all the time
[1:04:43] and i think it kind of helps him too
[1:04:46] praise god how many know singing helps
[1:04:48] you praise god
[1:04:49] no doubt it helped billy praise god
[1:04:53] he said now you know he said there's
[1:04:56] something about a song that's got
[1:04:57] power in it we all know that we're aware
[1:05:00] of that
[1:05:01] that looks at the army when they sing
[1:05:02] the songs and play the music do you know
[1:05:04] the approach to war and the army of god
[1:05:06] is first by music the singers went
[1:05:08] before the ark rejoicing and singing
[1:05:10] then come the ark and then the battle
[1:05:12] that's right so that's
[1:05:14] the right approach he said that we come
[1:05:17] at
[1:05:17] service at night what do we do we sing
[1:05:19] the hymns of the lord then the ark the
[1:05:21] word read the word
[1:05:22] and then the battle now here's the
[1:05:25] battle church we're trying to save souls
[1:05:27] we're trying to heal the sick right
[1:05:30] we're trying to get the we to be
[1:05:32] encouraged
[1:05:34] praise god that's the battle right so we
[1:05:36] do the
[1:05:37] singing then the word and then at the
[1:05:39] end trying to get victory see victory in
[1:05:41] people's lives
[1:05:43] amen he said so the great banners are
[1:05:47] flying tonight
[1:05:48] the name of jesus christ the lord god
[1:05:50] may be exalted
[1:05:51] the enemy be put to flight praise god
[1:05:54] and god he said god win the victory
[1:05:56] tonight
[1:05:57] save souls heal the sick and afflicted
[1:06:00] cause those that are weary and stooped
[1:06:02] low
[1:06:02] to raise their heads and rejoice get
[1:06:05] glory unto thyself
[1:06:06] for we ask this in the name of the lord
[1:06:09] jesus
[1:06:09] amen oh wouldn't that be such a victory
[1:06:12] tonight if someone that's so discouraged
[1:06:14] instead of being discouraged they could
[1:06:15] they might have walked in here with the
[1:06:17] head hung low
[1:06:18] but they'll walk out with their head up
[1:06:20] look into heaven with
[1:06:21] affection set on things above that'd be
[1:06:24] a great victory church
[1:06:26] praise god that's the battle
[1:06:29] that's the battle to uh
[1:06:32] raise up their heads to get them to
[1:06:33] rejoice to get them to see how close god
[1:06:36] is to them
[1:06:37] to know that they're not alone that god
[1:06:38] is with them hallelujah
[1:06:41] amen thank the lord hallelujah
[1:06:44] now let's play this here says uh this is
[1:06:46] probably
[1:06:47] uh this is probably the fastest song
[1:06:50] i've ever heard on brother branham's
[1:06:52] tapes so let me play this
[1:06:55] uh i was there when the spirit came how
[1:06:57] many ever heard that before anyone ever
[1:06:59] heard that
[1:07:00] it's a beautiful song it's from 1962 the
[1:07:02] end sign
[1:07:04] now i want you to notice though there's
[1:07:06] a man on here he kind of loses control
[1:07:10] and i want you to listen as brother
[1:07:11] brown comes up afterwards brother
[1:07:14] branham says what a spiritual lift
[1:07:17] but then he starts getting really
[1:07:18] serious
[1:07:20] because it's a healing service okay so i
[1:07:23] just want you to see
[1:07:24] brother brother brown makes a transition
[1:07:26] it's a rejoicing song
[1:07:28] the guy's he's literally screaming so
[1:07:30] some of you might be shocked to hear
[1:07:31] this if you've never heard it before
[1:07:32] this guy is ah and brother brahm comes
[1:07:35] up and says what a spiritual lift
[1:07:37] but then he goes right to prayer because
[1:07:39] he's going right to the battle because
[1:07:42] the battle is they're sick in the
[1:07:43] building
[1:07:44] and they need to be healed praise god
[1:07:47] screaming
[1:07:47] brother man says screaming shouting
[1:07:49] that's good that's victory
[1:07:51] but he has to transition from a victory
[1:07:53] song he said
[1:07:54] that's victory for that brother right
[1:07:56] that's victory for him but now there's
[1:07:57] many sick and afflicted here
[1:07:59] and we've got to win the battle for them
[1:08:01] praise god
[1:08:03] so it's just interesting it's
[1:08:04] interesting brother brahm doesn't
[1:08:06] enter in into the rejoicing he he
[1:08:08] realizes i've got to get the word
[1:08:10] for a healing service all right so
[1:08:14] listen to this here
[1:08:15] i think it'll be a help to you by god's
[1:08:16] grace
[1:08:23] all right so here let me uh do the
[1:08:26] history search real quick
[1:08:36] thank you for your patience here okay
[1:08:38] here it is
[1:08:41] let's see if this is the beginning of it
[1:08:47] there's two songs this and this is in uh
[1:08:50] arizona i believe
[1:08:53] so the first song i'm gonna skip this
[1:08:58] oh you might as well listen a little bit
[1:09:11] they have some beautiful singing here
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:37] i know jesus will see me through all
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:41] now they have they have parts they have
[1:09:43] male parts and female parts
[1:09:46] here's the one now
[1:09:50] get ready for this guy to scream a
[1:09:51] little bit here okay
[1:09:56] i was there when the spirit came
[1:10:02] [Music]

[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:59] you hear that
[1:11:04] you hear the stomping hear that you
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:10] stomping
[1:11:24] glory
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:56] [Music]
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:11] can you look up these lyrics real quick
[1:12:12] and put them up here i was there when
[1:12:14] the spirit came i know we got the song
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:34] is
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:46] once again
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:59] all right here's brother
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:06] praise the lord for that how thankful we
[1:13:09] are for a nice
[1:13:10] spiritual lift like that but there when
[1:13:13] the spirit came
[1:13:15] now we are grateful for these services
[1:13:18] again i say and we're praying now that
[1:13:20] god will
[1:13:21] heal the sick heal all right thank you
[1:13:25] everybody like that one by god's grace
[1:13:27] that's always been uh
[1:13:29] a great song i enjoy hearing it
[1:13:31] instantly makes me happy
[1:13:33] instantly makes me joyful to hear
[1:13:35] somebody sing like that because you
[1:13:37] don't hear that very often
[1:13:39] especially around the message ranks
[1:13:41] right so you can switch back over here
[1:13:43] let me put up the exact quote but
[1:13:45] abraham says praise the lord for
[1:13:47] thank the lord for that he says we're
[1:13:48] thankful for a nice spiritual lift
[1:13:50] like that
[1:13:54] so anyone that would say oh it's you
[1:13:57] know we shouldn't shout or we shouldn't
[1:13:59] clap or shouldn't stomp
[1:14:00] well brother bram never reboot we rebuke
[1:14:02] this guy right and he even called it
[1:14:04] we're thankful for a nice spiritual lift
[1:14:06] like that
[1:14:07] but as i said he had to make the
[1:14:09] transition now he's going from songs at
[1:14:11] the beginning
[1:14:12] now he's got to bring the word right and
[1:14:14] then now then he has a battle at the end
[1:14:16] to do discernments and get people to
[1:14:19] accept their healing
[1:14:20] so brother man doesn't really join in
[1:14:21] we'd say with uh
[1:14:23] that but i want to notice the scripture
[1:14:26] too
[1:14:26] this brother must have been really on
[1:14:28] fire and the bible says
[1:14:30] is any merry let him sing songs
[1:14:33] this all this guy is doing is obeying
[1:14:35] the word praise god
[1:14:36] the word says if you're happy sing a
[1:14:38] song praise god
[1:14:40] and surely this guy was he was mary the
[1:14:42] bible said let him sing
[1:14:43] psalms praise god
[1:14:48] so i don't know if i've ever played that
[1:14:50] before but amen have you ever heard that
[1:14:51] here okay
[1:14:53] so that was uh from ensign
[1:14:57] phoenix arizona 1962.
[1:15:01] so whenever people uh whenever people
[1:15:04] try to limit what god can do in songs i
[1:15:06] always bring out this
[1:15:08] it's loud it's got shouting stomping
[1:15:11] clapping it's got piano where they're
[1:15:13] what is it called improvisation
[1:15:14] improvisation now like i say
[1:15:17] you can hear like they add little extra
[1:15:18] beats and brother bam calls it a
[1:15:20] spiritual lift
[1:15:22] so i always use this this is kind of
[1:15:24] like my judgment here for
[1:15:26] this isn't rock and roll according to
[1:15:27] brother branham it's upbeat it's loud
[1:15:29] it's clapping so
[1:15:30] in my mind without without knowing much
[1:15:32] about music this has been my example of
[1:15:35] this is real freedom right here
[1:15:37] this is loud and it's joyful it's not
[1:15:39] rock and roll right
[1:15:41] uh but it's a joyful song unto the lord
[1:15:45] so i guess as i learn more about it then
[1:15:48] i'll be able to kind of understand what
[1:15:49] was in this song that was
[1:15:51] good yet it's not rock and roll all
[1:15:53] right
[1:15:54] so that's just me growing as an
[1:15:56] individual to try to understand it
[1:15:58] now i want to play another one too this
[1:16:00] is uh
[1:16:01] this is from thirst 1965 a beautiful
[1:16:04] message here
[1:16:05] and let me read this first i think i
[1:16:07] read this when i preached part one
[1:16:08] but we didn't listen to it so i would
[1:16:10] like to listen to it
[1:16:12] just to hear how brother adam says it
[1:16:13] they're singing a song
[1:16:15] i don't remember which song it is but
[1:16:16] we'll listen to in a moment he said do
[1:16:18] you love that no wonder
[1:16:20] he said now i wonder if you've got your
[1:16:22] feet converted
[1:16:23] you don't dance anymore out there for
[1:16:25] the world see let's pat our feet to the
[1:16:27] lord
[1:16:29] so he says well you don't dance anymore
[1:16:30] but can you still pat your feet to god
[1:16:33] right he said let's pat our feet is your
[1:16:36] hands converted you don't steal anymore
[1:16:38] is your lips converted you don't lie
[1:16:39] anymore just don't get religion in your
[1:16:41] head
[1:16:42] get it all over you so brother is
[1:16:45] encouraging
[1:16:46] worship god with your whole being right
[1:16:49] with your feet your hands
[1:16:50] your ten-stringed instruments right your
[1:16:52] voice worship god with everything you
[1:16:54] got
[1:16:55] praise god he said that's right now
[1:16:57] let's pat our feet
[1:16:58] okay so again i gotta go off here sorry
[1:17:01] let me pull that up here
[1:17:03] and we can listen to it might be onward
[1:17:07] christian soldiers i can't remember here
[1:17:11] do you love that
[1:17:20] oh it's when the saints go marching in
[1:17:22] okay yeah
[1:17:26] okay here we go
[1:17:35] it's a little bit faster right
[1:17:48] [Music]
[1:17:56] is
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:09] here's the quote
[1:18:27] that's right
[1:18:51] [Laughter]
[1:19:06] i have
[1:19:10] all right i'll stop right there praise
[1:19:12] god all right can you switch back over
[1:19:13] here i want to put the rest of them
[1:19:14] almost done here
[1:19:16] by god's grace i hope that's a help to
[1:19:18] your church to see how some songs are
[1:19:20] fast you know
[1:19:21] uh and some are slower oh yeah and right
[1:19:24] after this he goes into we'll walk in
[1:19:26] the light such a beautiful light so he
[1:19:27] goes from a fast one
[1:19:29] down to a slow one and that's what
[1:19:32] we'll do that too right all churches
[1:19:34] will do that sometimes they'll go well
[1:19:35] not all churches
[1:19:36] but many churches will do that they go
[1:19:38] from a fast down to a slow
[1:19:39] and maybe then pick it back up again uh
[1:19:42] just as you let the lord but i love that
[1:19:43] how brother brown says let's pat our
[1:19:45] feet
[1:19:45] let's clap let's sing let's do a fast
[1:19:48] song right
[1:19:48] get your body moving get your whole body
[1:19:51] into the worship praise god
[1:19:54] all right now so
[1:19:58] uh let's take a few minutes on this i'm
[1:19:59] not going to be much longer just got a
[1:20:00] couple more slides here i want to show
[1:20:03] because i got more i got to do a lot
[1:20:04] more studying on this here to kind of
[1:20:06] define some of these things
[1:20:07] uh so let's look here um so in other
[1:20:10] words
[1:20:11] acceptable worship it can be loud or
[1:20:13] soft
[1:20:16] um and that could even be loud with
[1:20:19] stomping right it can stomp
[1:20:21] loud clapping repentant or joyful
[1:20:25] fast or slow and it can even have if
[1:20:29] expressed correctly it can have drums
[1:20:32] electric and bass guitars but they got
[1:20:34] to have control
[1:20:36] praise god they got to have control and
[1:20:38] not be
[1:20:39] used in a way that makes it too sensual
[1:20:42] right and so i'll try to get some
[1:20:44] examples of that in the future lord
[1:20:45] willing where you can tell where
[1:20:46] it becomes a rock and roll drum beat
[1:20:48] right or becomes a rock and roll
[1:20:50] electric guitar that's pretty easy to
[1:20:52] spot
[1:20:53] or rock and roll bass guitar i don't
[1:20:55] know about that myself i'm not really
[1:20:57] familiar with bass guitars but uh
[1:21:01] with some of these we can clearly be
[1:21:03] able to discern if it's the right beat
[1:21:05] or not
[1:21:06] okay now here i want to just close i
[1:21:08] think i'll just close with this
[1:21:09] this thought from rebecca branham so
[1:21:12] this here's a few lessons
[1:21:13] now from her chapter seven she
[1:21:16] identifies
[1:21:17] rock and roll's four attributes
[1:21:20] so these are the four i kind of
[1:21:21] mentioned earlier but i'll just read a
[1:21:23] little bit about
[1:21:24] what she was writing so she says here's
[1:21:27] the four
[1:21:28] attributes of rock and roll rhythm so
[1:21:31] that has a certain
[1:21:33] ungodly rhythm it has a lot of
[1:21:36] repetition
[1:21:39] uh the volume and then variety
[1:21:42] so i'm just taking this straight from
[1:21:44] her book or her article
[1:21:46] so she says uh rhythm rock and roll is
[1:21:49] usually four
[1:21:49] four time but not always
[1:21:52] okay so some there are some people that
[1:21:54] say you can't do a 4-4
[1:21:56] song and there's that's that group that
[1:21:58] came down from canada
[1:22:00] and came to our church and other
[1:22:01] churches and they were saying you can't
[1:22:03] do 4-4 time
[1:22:04] because of this article but we looked it
[1:22:07] up
[1:22:08] we did that at home we looked up some of
[1:22:09] the songs and a lot of hymns are four
[1:22:12] four time
[1:22:13] like one of them is onward christian
[1:22:14] soldiers onward christian
[1:22:18] soldiers marching
[1:22:21] as two i might be going a little faster
[1:22:22] now anyways it's four times at least
[1:22:25] what we saw on the internet
[1:22:26] or we saw it in the book yeah we saw it
[1:22:27] in the hymnal book
[1:22:30] so see people will take this article
[1:22:32] from sister rebecca
[1:22:34] and uh and she didn't say uh it has to
[1:22:38] be a 4-4 but she said many times they
[1:22:40] use
[1:22:40] a 4-4 rock and roll were used for for
[1:22:42] and these people just misunderstood
[1:22:44] even her article
[1:22:47] um but she says you always got to watch
[1:22:50] out for the sensual back
[1:22:52] beats which is also called syncopate
[1:22:55] syncopation
[1:22:58] and then the certain articles that will
[1:23:00] produce sensuality we talked i just
[1:23:02] mentioned that earlier
[1:23:03] okay now here's a little evernote
[1:23:06] article i found about electric guitar i
[1:23:08] was with my children at the library
[1:23:11] um it was four years ago and
[1:23:14] we were just looking at books you know
[1:23:16] and the holy spirit brought this back to
[1:23:17] my memory just this morning i
[1:23:19] i say this article four years ago i
[1:23:22] totally forgot about it
[1:23:23] and the holy spirit brought it back to
[1:23:24] my remembrance this morning so it's just
[1:23:26] interesting
[1:23:27] um and jesus promised his spirit would
[1:23:30] bring all things to our remembrance so
[1:23:32] let me
[1:23:32] go forward a little bit here so here's
[1:23:35] what the article says
[1:23:36] about electric guitar now it's really
[1:23:38] hard to read so i don't expect you to
[1:23:39] read that but i'll read it
[1:23:41] the electric guitar revolutionized 20th
[1:23:43] century
[1:23:44] popular music like its acoustic cousin
[1:23:48] it has six strings which run down a long
[1:23:50] neck over metal strips called frets
[1:23:52] but rather than having a hollow body to
[1:23:54] make the sound louder
[1:23:56] most electric guitars are solid
[1:23:58] electromagnets
[1:23:59] change the strings vibrations into
[1:24:02] electrical currents
[1:24:04] which are then amplified made louder
[1:24:06] electronically
[1:24:09] rickenbacker electro instruments
[1:24:11] produced the first electric guitars in
[1:24:13] 1931
[1:24:14] but electric guitar playing really
[1:24:16] caught on in 1949
[1:24:18] with the simple rich sounding fender
[1:24:20] telecaster
[1:24:21] musicians started using this to play a
[1:24:23] new type of music called
[1:24:25] rock and roll
[1:24:28] okay now i didn't have this but uh
[1:24:33] oh yeah over there in the corner it says
[1:24:34] this it says uh the tone knob
[1:24:37] changes the strength of the overtones
[1:24:40] sounds that are higher than the main
[1:24:43] note
[1:24:44] so let your guitar is able to go to
[1:24:46] other notes
[1:24:47] right which and stronger so that means
[1:24:49] that a stronger effect on the human body
[1:24:51] and mind right
[1:24:54] uh and then they use these stronger
[1:24:55] notes and the stronger volumes
[1:24:58] in rock and roll right
[1:25:02] they didn't they weren't used right away
[1:25:04] but it was
[1:25:05] i guess a creation or a perversion
[1:25:07] perversion of the devil right
[1:25:10] and that's how they would use electric
[1:25:11] guitars the wrong way
[1:25:15] and this was from the book ideas that
[1:25:17] changed the world so i just found that
[1:25:18] at the library a few years ago
[1:25:21] okay so i don't understand it all yet
[1:25:23] but i'm just saying
[1:25:24] electric guitar has electric means to
[1:25:27] impact the body and the mind
[1:25:30] in ways it shouldn't be affected okay
[1:25:35] so we got to be very careful with
[1:25:37] electric guitar now
[1:25:38] i just brought this quote out so you can
[1:25:40] see how brother ram didn't uh
[1:25:42] he wasn't against drums right he was
[1:25:44] just against rock and roll drumming
[1:25:47] okay because he's talking about he's
[1:25:49] talking about elisha when elisha
[1:25:51] said bring me a menstrual remember
[1:25:53] second kings chapter three i read it on
[1:25:54] wednesday night
[1:25:56] jehoshaphat said can you prophesy should
[1:25:57] we go up and he said i'll do it for your
[1:25:59] sake jehoshaphat
[1:26:00] he said bring me a minstrel bring me
[1:26:02] this how brother says it
[1:26:04] he said they got to play in the music
[1:26:05] now listen you can't be the prophet
[1:26:07] you can be one of the instruments you
[1:26:09] know that plays the music to bring the
[1:26:11] spirit down
[1:26:12] on the prophet praise god you know what
[1:26:15] i mean
[1:26:16] they begin to play they beat the drums
[1:26:17] play the instruments oh they begin to
[1:26:19] beat and play
[1:26:20] there will be a meeting in the air in
[1:26:23] that sweet sweet by
[1:26:25] and by so my brand said they got to sing
[1:26:27] a song that will bring the spirit down
[1:26:30] praise god
[1:26:31] and drums and beats and singing all
[1:26:34] involved
[1:26:35] the prophet began to get in the spirit
[1:26:37] he says and the first thing you know
[1:26:39] when he got in the spirit things began
[1:26:40] to happen
[1:26:41] that's what the matter we can't get
[1:26:42] anywhere today we don't get in the
[1:26:44] spirit of it that's right yes you
[1:26:46] got to get in the spirit of it they
[1:26:48] begin to go to clap in their hands and
[1:26:50] really having a good time
[1:26:52] and the spirit of god begins to fall in
[1:26:54] the prophet his spirit got on the
[1:26:55] prophet
[1:26:56] then they begin to see things you'll go
[1:26:58] to seeing things when you get in the
[1:27:00] sphere
[1:27:01] praise god hallelujah praise god
[1:27:04] amen so see uh we can't say all drums
[1:27:08] are bad
[1:27:08] we can't say uh can't say all loud songs
[1:27:12] are bad
[1:27:13] can't say uh all guitars are bad
[1:27:16] remember satan's gonna make it so close
[1:27:19] so close right but then he'll try to
[1:27:23] pervert one thing it'll pervert the
[1:27:24] vocals or the rhythm
[1:27:26] or one of those elements that uh we we
[1:27:28] read earlier
[1:27:30] okay so i think this one might be my
[1:27:33] last slide actually yeah this one's my
[1:27:34] last slime
[1:27:36] and so here's her uh last thoughts on on
[1:27:39] this
[1:27:40] okay so there's four rhythm now with
[1:27:41] repetition now
[1:27:43] here's one idea about repetition
[1:27:47] if you listen to the end of perfect
[1:27:48] faith um
[1:27:50] brother branham i'm not gonna play it
[1:27:52] tonight but brother graham uh
[1:27:54] is doing a prayer line and they're just
[1:27:56] doing a prayer line and just letting
[1:27:57] people
[1:27:57] pass through he's not even praying he
[1:27:59] just said receive your healing
[1:28:01] receive your healing and it goes on for
[1:28:03] 15 20 maybe
[1:28:04] 30 minutes and they just sing the great
[1:28:06] physician the whole time
[1:28:08] well if if you say it's wrong to repeat
[1:28:11] songs well then he was wrong just
[1:28:13] singing
[1:28:13] the great physician the whole 20 or
[1:28:15] minute long prayer line right
[1:28:18] so we got to be careful uh you know with
[1:28:21] some of these
[1:28:22] attributes of rock and roll right that
[1:28:24] people that people say they're
[1:28:26] they're attributes of rock and roll but
[1:28:28] yet sometimes we're led of god just to
[1:28:30] sing the same song again
[1:28:31] right just keep singing that song
[1:28:35] and so sometimes we'll see repetition in
[1:28:37] songs that's not always bad
[1:28:40] right it's not always bad
[1:28:44] so that that that's a real that's a kind
[1:28:46] of a question mark area for me i don't
[1:28:48] understand like
[1:28:49] what do you mean rock and roll
[1:28:50] repetition so i'm just saying i maybe
[1:28:51] don't understand that
[1:28:53] but i know it's not always bad to do
[1:28:55] repetition because of that prayer line
[1:28:57] in perfect faith 1963. now the volume i
[1:29:00] mentioned this earlier
[1:29:02] extreme loud music void your thinking
[1:29:04] and it's
[1:29:05] and it easily it helps you easily lose
[1:29:07] control you see that at rock concerts of
[1:29:09] course
[1:29:10] and that kind of those type of
[1:29:12] atmospheres
[1:29:13] now here's this is really interesting
[1:29:15] and this is what she ends this section
[1:29:16] with
[1:29:17] how to identify rock and roll she said
[1:29:19] rock and roll is constantly
[1:29:21] changing like recently you've seen rock
[1:29:24] and roll and rap mix right
[1:29:26] uh well
[1:29:30] like on that video series they used
[1:29:32] eminem who's a rapper
[1:29:35] uh he started getting popular right when
[1:29:37] i was leaving the world and becoming a
[1:29:39] christian
[1:29:40] right around 1999. so i listened to a
[1:29:43] few of his songs at the beginning before
[1:29:44] they were really really awful i mean
[1:29:46] they were awful then but they're really
[1:29:47] really awful now
[1:29:48] anyways they started doing crossovers
[1:29:51] between rock and rap and then rap and
[1:29:54] hip hop or whatever
[1:29:55] or country and rap and rock so they
[1:29:57] start doing crossovers
[1:29:59] and so that's the point she's making
[1:30:01] rock and roll is constantly
[1:30:03] changing to attract more people so it's
[1:30:06] so it always won't have the same
[1:30:07] rhythms it always won't have the same
[1:30:09] volume or it'll always
[1:30:11] be changing uh to keep it fresh for them
[1:30:14] for the devil worshipers right
[1:30:16] fresh for them but also attracting a
[1:30:18] larger audience
[1:30:20] so she makes the point it won't always
[1:30:22] be 4-4 time right
[1:30:23] it will always be electric guitar it
[1:30:26] won't always be the base like this
[1:30:29] so we can't we can't just pinpoint it
[1:30:31] and say it's always going to be this
[1:30:33] because satan's smarter than that right
[1:30:36] he's going to try to uh adjust things
[1:30:41] all right so she says it's always
[1:30:43] constantly changing mixing
[1:30:44] evolving to seduce more souls
[1:30:48] okay we can't say it's always one thing
[1:30:51] all right so uh in closing here
[1:30:55] i hope you saw that uh that uh brother
[1:30:59] branham got spiritual lifts
[1:31:01] uh from upbeat songs praise god hope you
[1:31:04] can see that
[1:31:05] and singing will of course as we know it
[1:31:08] helps us contact god
[1:31:10] and it'll drive away like we said
[1:31:12] anxiety
[1:31:13] stress right
[1:31:16] in saul's case a murdering spirit church
[1:31:19] a murdering spirit
[1:31:21] music will drive away and cast out a
[1:31:24] murdering spirit
[1:31:25] praise god for music amen and we've got
[1:31:28] to use
[1:31:29] uh wisdom uh to make sure
[1:31:32] we're balancing it the right way which i
[1:31:34] believe we've always done a good job of
[1:31:36] that and i believe it's only getting
[1:31:37] better as witnessed by
[1:31:39] the saints from last weekend so let's
[1:31:41] stand to our feet by god's grace
[1:31:44] if you guys can play that song here i am
[1:31:46] to worship can we play that song here i
[1:31:48] am to bow down
[1:31:51] lie to the world yeah did we see that
[1:31:53] this morning yep oh we didn't see that
[1:31:54] this morning okay
[1:31:55] that's fine we could see it again
[1:31:59] i forgot about that
[1:32:06] hope that's a good start church you know
[1:32:08] this is and i gotta tell you i'm just
[1:32:10] being honest this is not an easy subject
[1:32:11] for me to study and preach on and it's
[1:32:13] just hard for me to understand for some
[1:32:14] reason
[1:32:15] like there's really there's some
[1:32:16] subjects i just well i grab ahold of
[1:32:18] that i think
[1:32:19] i can it just seems to come to me really
[1:32:21] easily like with the fivefold ministry
[1:32:23] and you know
[1:32:24] the godhead and some of these other
[1:32:27] doctors i just
[1:32:28] i eat them all up and it seems like it's
[1:32:30] easy to study
[1:32:31] but this one has just been a hard one so
[1:32:33] i appreciate you bearing with me
[1:32:35] uh did anybody learn anything tonight or
[1:32:37] was anything helpful tonight by god's
[1:32:38] grace
[1:32:38] okay good good good praise god that
[1:32:41] makes me happy
[1:32:44] let's just remember that we always need
[1:32:45] to have a spirit of rejoicing
[1:32:47] right if our music gets so cold
[1:32:51] and stale like brother ben said he said
[1:32:52] if it gets so cold and still you
[1:32:54] he he said you'll probably think you
[1:32:56] walked into a funeral rather than a
[1:32:57] worship service
[1:33:00] and then he said you'd be walking around
[1:33:01] looking for the dead body right we're
[1:33:03] looking for the
[1:33:04] that's what he was saying over there
[1:33:05] that's true you know like
[1:33:07] in some churches you do that you walk in
[1:33:09] you think why is everybody so sad
[1:33:11] the music is there we start with the
[1:33:13] music right to drive away
[1:33:15] all that so we can rejoice and receive
[1:33:18] god's word amen
[1:33:21] hallelujah and really be thankful for
[1:33:23] what god has done for us
[1:33:25] amen remember the bible says we are
