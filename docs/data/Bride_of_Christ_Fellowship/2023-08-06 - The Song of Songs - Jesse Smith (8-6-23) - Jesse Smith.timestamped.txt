[0:02] you know what the wedding coming up I
[0:03] just thought I'd preach on
[0:06] love today so amen my title is the song
[0:09] of songs by God's grace amen
[0:13] yeah that's kind of what's on my mind
[0:15] I'm sure it's all of our minds and
[0:17] um
[0:20] that's what brother Ram says the whole
[0:21] world wants is love praise God and of
[0:24] course that's the love of Jesus Christ
[0:26] when two are married that are Christians
[0:28] and they experience that love as well
[0:30] praise God in a marriage relationship
[0:33] so I want to preach on the song of songs
[0:35] we'll be spending some time and of
[0:37] course The Book Song of Solomon
[0:41] um but we'll start here because the
[0:43] whole purpose of marriage of course is
[0:46] to be a foreshadow of Christ and the
[0:48] church praise God so we're very thankful
[0:50] for that I'm sure if you're married you
[0:52] see that in your marriage amen I know I
[0:54] do in mine and
[0:57] Jesus Christ of course is called the
[0:59] bridegroom and his church is called the
[1:01] bride Hallelujah so let's read that one
[1:03] we can read verse 39 or 29 rather
[1:05] together and then I want to go to Song
[1:06] of Solomon uh chapter one after this
[1:09] let's read verse 29 if we can ready one
[1:12] two three he that hath the bride is the
[1:15] bridegroom but the friend of the
[1:18] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[1:21] him rejoices greatly because of the
[1:24] bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore
[1:28] is fulfilled this is John the Baptist
[1:30] saying my joy is fulfilled I'm the
[1:33] friend of the bridegroom Hallelujah
[1:35] Jesus Christ is the bridegroom and his
[1:37] people are the bride Hallelujah
[1:41] and I love that he rejoices greatly
[1:43] because of the bridegroom's voice how
[1:44] many love the voice of Jesus Amen Lorena
[1:47] said if he ever speaks to you it'll be a
[1:49] scriptural voice yes amen it'll light up
[1:52] with everything that's already been said
[1:54] in the word of God praise God let's go
[1:56] to Song of Songs
[1:58] chapter 1 verse one
[2:07] you know this book is a lot like the
[2:08] Book of Esther whereas you know some
[2:11] people will debate is you know should it
[2:12] be in the Bible and is it Inspire
[2:15] of course
[2:17] God allowed these two books Esther and
[2:20] Song of Solomon to be in the Bible
[2:21] because they were inspired of the holy
[2:24] spirit in any spiritual mind would be
[2:27] able to see that
[2:29] but we'll just read verses
[2:32] um
[2:33] one through four by God's grace
[2:36] I'll read these you know because they're
[2:37] a little bit longer here
[2:39] the song of songs which is Solomon's let
[2:43] him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth
[2:45] for thy love is better than Wine
[2:49] because of the savior of thy good
[2:50] ointments thy name is as ointment poured
[2:53] forth therefore do the virgins love thee
[2:56] his name is like ointment
[2:59] with a wonderful smell that's what his
[3:02] name is like
[3:03] verse 4 draw me I love these words here
[3:06] draw me the woman is speaking Draw Me
[3:08] Lord
[3:09] we will run after thee the king hath
[3:12] brought me into his Chambers we will be
[3:14] glad and rejoice in thee we remember
[3:17] that I love more than Wine the upright
[3:20] love thee amen let's have one more word
[3:22] of prayer if I need on your heart let's
[3:24] just make a known unto God here today
[3:25] Heavenly Father we thank you God for
[3:27] this opportunity to be in your house
[3:29] Lord God we thank you for these songs
[3:30] that we sing Lord Jesus brings us into
[3:32] your presence Lord God hallelujah you're
[3:35] our savior our friend our our King but
[3:38] you're also God hallelujah so we thank
[3:40] you God that you would condescend to
[3:43] people of low estate like us but then
[3:45] Lord let your spirit abide in us and
[3:47] raise us up into spiritual Heavenly
[3:49] places Lord God
[3:51] making us Kings and Priests unto God but
[3:54] also Lord ultimately the bride of Christ
[3:56] the Lord God we're so thankful for this
[3:58] Revelation from your Bible and Lord God
[4:00] anoint me today God just use my lips and
[4:03] my mind dear God I just want to glorify
[4:06] you Jesus we just want to be in a
[4:09] rejoicing happy joyful State Lord as the
[4:12] wedding ears Lord God this Saturday so
[4:14] we thank you for your mercy anoint us
[4:16] now Lord each one of us in Jesus
[4:17] Christ's name and the saint said amen
[4:20] amen God bless you as you're being
[4:21] seated praise God
[4:32] I just want to review a little bit on
[4:34] the Song of Solomon but if you have your
[4:36] Bibles let's go to Genesis chapter one
[4:38] we'll just read a few verses here about
[4:40] the beginning here
[4:42] and boy could our current sinful Society
[4:46] learn a lesson from Genesis chapter one
[4:50] that God makes them male and female
[4:51] praise God
[4:58] Genesis chapter 1.
[5:01] verse 26 and God said let us make man in
[5:04] our image after our likeness and let
[5:07] them have dominion over the fish of the
[5:09] sea and over the fall of the air and
[5:11] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[5:12] and over every creeping thing that
[5:14] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[5:18] man in his own image in the image of God
[5:20] created he him male and female created
[5:23] he them
[5:24] now brother Graham tells us when God
[5:26] first made Adam and Eve they were in the
[5:28] spirit form Hallelujah
[5:31] like your soul form and they were one
[5:34] Spirit together
[5:36] Adam was one one part and Eve was
[5:38] another part
[5:39] and then of course God put flesh upon
[5:43] that spirit that Soul or maybe there's
[5:45] two souls in there now that I think
[5:47] about it
[5:49] and it was just one person it was just
[5:51] Adam the first Adam praise God we know
[5:54] Christ is the last Adam Hallelujah
[5:57] and then we know as the Bible says here
[5:59] uh but before that let's I'll read verse
[6:02] 28 and God bless them and God said them
[6:03] be fruitful and multiply replenish the
[6:06] Earth and subdue it and have dominion
[6:08] over the fish of the sea and over the
[6:10] fowl the air and over every living thing
[6:12] that moveth upon the Earth
[6:14] Hallelujah verse 31 and God saw
[6:16] everything that he had made and behold
[6:18] it was very good and the evening in the
[6:20] morning were the sixth day Hallelujah
[6:24] all right now we go down later in
[6:26] chapter two if you have your Bible there
[6:27] to chapter 15.
[6:30] uh Genesis 2 verse 15 and the Lord took
[6:32] the man and put him in the Garden of
[6:34] Eden to dress it and to keep it
[6:37] so even in a perfect world God made man
[6:40] a worker right
[6:41] I heard a good podcast from Brother
[6:43] Jason Demars and he was saying you young
[6:45] man he said you need to learn how to
[6:47] work with your hands that's a good
[6:49] lesson he said and he kind of made a
[6:51] joke he said I'm the only one in the
[6:52] church that doesn't work with my hands
[6:54] that's kind of like me
[6:57] I work at a desk you know and with the
[7:00] children I guess I work with my hands I
[7:02] work a little bit but you know we got
[7:04] our we got plumbers and electricians and
[7:06] all kinds of things and uh construction
[7:09] workers but you know when God had a
[7:11] perfect world he had man work with his
[7:14] hands
[7:15] and I just like Jason's uh he was kind
[7:17] of just
[7:18] admonishing the young men don't get
[7:20] addicted to video games don't get
[7:22] addicted to uh you know just watching
[7:25] screens all day get out there and work
[7:27] with your hands do something praise God
[7:28] Amen build something because God called
[7:30] you to build something praise God right
[7:32] amen that's what the man was called to
[7:34] do and he was also supposed to subdue it
[7:36] he's supposed to overcome it praise God
[7:37] right he was supposed to run to the
[7:40] problems
[7:41] like last night I was trying to run to
[7:42] our stove and fix the stove right Emma
[7:44] is a lot of clanking and banging going
[7:46] around I didn't I got a little bit
[7:48] accomplished but not a lot I'll see what
[7:50] I can do tonight by God's grace
[7:52] uh and tomorrow maybe
[7:55] but you know as men that's what men are
[7:57] called to do they're called to run to
[7:58] the problem
[7:59] they're called to subdue it
[8:02] uh of course they you know that's what
[8:03] God's called us to do
[8:05] uh verse 16 and the Lord God commanded
[8:07] the man saying of every tree of the
[8:09] garden that thou mayest really eat but
[8:10] of the tree of knowledge Good and Evil
[8:12] I shall not eat of it for the day that
[8:14] thou shalt I'm sorry but for in the day
[8:16] that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt
[8:19] surely die
[8:21] all right now of course and then Adam
[8:24] gives the names to all the creatures
[8:25] again he's led by the Holy Spirit he
[8:28] gives them the names
[8:29] and verse 21 and the Lord caused a deep
[8:32] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[8:33] he took one of the ribs and closed up
[8:35] the flesh instead thereof
[8:37] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[8:40] from man made he a woman and brought her
[8:43] unto the man's of course this is a
[8:45] beautiful uh story about how Eve is a
[8:49] part of Adam she's completely a part of
[8:51] Adam Hallelujah and God uh God made
[8:55] Adam's help mate from himself she was a
[8:58] part of him originally praise God
[9:01] and then in the original creation
[9:03] brother van tells us it was just Adam
[9:04] right it was just Adam and Eve as one
[9:07] Spirit they were one entity and then God
[9:09] separated them
[9:11] Hallelujah and you know we have numerous
[9:13] uh audio dramas right and then the Audio
[9:16] Drama Adam falls asleep and then after
[9:18] the surgery Adam wakes up and then he
[9:21] hears a sweet voice say Adam
[9:23] and he's like whoa
[9:25] you're beautiful
[9:28] and uh it just it's it's it's it's it's
[9:30] fun you know it's uh entertaining to
[9:33] think about yeah what was that like the
[9:34] first time he saw her and he could feel
[9:36] like you're a part of me
[9:38] you're my other right that you saw the
[9:40] other of the lion the other the giraffe
[9:42] other the bear yeah they all had pears
[9:44] but I don't have a pair where's my other
[9:48] and so Adam wakes up and
[9:51] and in verse 23 we get his exact words
[9:53] it's beautiful he said this is now bone
[9:55] of my bones Flesh of My Flesh
[9:59] as she became manifested to him right
[10:01] she was inside of him before but now
[10:04] she's manifested and he says she's a
[10:06] part of me I'm one with her praise God
[10:10] she's bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh
[10:12] he should be called woman because she
[10:14] was taken out of man that's what woman
[10:16] means taken out of man because she was
[10:19] taken out of the man verse 24 therefore
[10:21] shall a man leave
[10:22] his mother and his father and shall
[10:25] cleave unto his wife and they shall be
[10:27] one flesh
[10:29] and they were both naked the man and his
[10:30] wife and were not ashamed
[10:33] Hallelujah so this is the word of the
[10:35] Lord
[10:36] so I like how the you know the Bible
[10:38] says even before uh Adam and Eve had a
[10:40] mother right Adam speaks this
[10:42] prophetically Adam no doubt was a
[10:44] prophet
[10:45] he said a a man shall leave his mother
[10:48] and father and then cleave to his wife
[10:50] and that's the word glue right so
[10:52] what's amazing is that they were first
[10:54] together then they're apart but then
[10:56] Adam says we got to be glued back
[10:58] together
[10:59] is that wonderful uh that's how God
[11:02] wants us in our marriages of course
[11:03] that's a great type of Christ in the
[11:05] church
[11:07] the true expression of marriage of
[11:09] course is unity
[11:11] it's it's one uh here
[11:14] Adam says it's one flesh it's one it's
[11:16] one bone right but the ultimate unity is
[11:19] in one Holy Spirit praise God yes and
[11:22] they caught that Hallelujah the Bride of
[11:24] Jesus caught it on the day of Pentecost
[11:25] the Bible said they are in one mind one
[11:28] Accord in one place hallelujah amen and
[11:30] that when the Holy Ghost Falls Church
[11:32] that's what has happened we've all got
[11:34] the same mind we've all got the same
[11:36] desires right we got I got the same
[11:38] intentions right we're all in the same
[11:40] place Hallelujah and then the Holy Ghost
[11:42] can flow and Rush In Like A rushing
[11:44] Mighty Wind Hallelujah
[11:46] oh it's beautiful we see it there
[11:49] two that are really one
[11:52] and they're to be joined one to another
[11:54] so we see uh God's pattern for this here
[11:57] in Genesis chapter one praise God
[12:00] now before we get the song to Solomon go
[12:02] to Jeremiah I just want to read a few
[12:03] verses out of Jeremiah
[12:05] Jeremiah 7 verse 34.
[12:10] as I was texting austinina this morning
[12:12] I said enjoy these moments leading up to
[12:14] your wedding day I I would I give a lot
[12:18] of things if I could go back and relive
[12:19] my wedding day I just I guess I'm
[12:21] sentimental like that brother man said
[12:22] the same thing he talked about the
[12:24] golden days he wished he could go back
[12:25] and live again I'm sure each one of us
[12:27] have days like that we wish we could
[12:29] just go back and live that again that's
[12:31] why we're thankful for cameras and video
[12:34] cameras and photos and oh what was that
[12:37] liking and uh I just said enjoy these
[12:40] moments you know take as many pictures
[12:41] as you can and uh Austin and Lena and
[12:43] and uh you look back on these days and I
[12:47] said it ever since I got married that
[12:48] was the happiest day of my life outside
[12:50] of being saved praise God
[12:51] my wedding day Hallelujah
[12:54] now Jeremiah 7 34 now don't get
[12:57] discouraged on these first three verses
[12:59] okay because Jeremiah is a prophet to
[13:01] warn the people he was the weeping
[13:02] prophet There's Hope at the end though
[13:05] but don't don't be sad at these first
[13:07] few verses here what it was was a
[13:09] warning from the Holy Spirit from
[13:11] Jehovah the husband to Israel the church
[13:13] the bride remember we said we saw that
[13:15] last Sunday that Israel was married to
[13:17] God
[13:18] but God had to divorce them because
[13:20] Israel wouldn't repent of her adulteries
[13:22] and her foreign adulteries and her
[13:24] whoredoms the Bible says
[13:26] but I just want I just want to get you I
[13:28] want you to see a thought out of here
[13:29] Jeremiah 7 34 then when I pause to cease
[13:33] from the cities of Judah and from the
[13:34] streets of Jerusalem the voice of Mirth
[13:37] and the voice of gladness the voice of
[13:40] the bridegroom
[13:41] and the voice of the Bride for the land
[13:44] shall be desolate so Jeremiah is warning
[13:47] the people here because of your sins
[13:49] you're no longer going to hear these
[13:51] happy voices in the streets
[13:54] right uh in the city
[13:58] uh the the word mirth means rejoicing or
[14:01] joy
[14:02] and the voice of gladness and so all
[14:05] these happy sounds you're not going to
[14:06] hear these happy sounds and what else is
[14:07] included in there the voice of the
[14:09] bridegroom and the voice of the Bride
[14:12] so Jeremiah just lets us know culturally
[14:15] in Israel the happiest times were
[14:18] waiting times
[14:20] and you'd hear the people now you think
[14:23] about how our little ones get so excited
[14:25] for weddings you know they are little
[14:27] girls they talk about being being
[14:29] married in their wedding days and they
[14:31] yeah uh they're all they all get to
[14:33] dress up and they look like little
[14:35] princesses
[14:36] the same was true you know it's amazing
[14:39] how God's pattern doesn't change and
[14:41] God's God's creatures act the same way
[14:44] today Hallelujah in other words the
[14:46] happiest times were wedding times when
[14:48] two individuals become one
[14:51] praise God
[14:52] and love and love is expressed and love
[14:57] love becomes manifested praise God
[15:00] and that's what we ought to see this
[15:02] week Austin and Lena ought to be the
[15:04] happiest people at their respective jobs
[15:06] this week
[15:07] you and I ought to be the happiest
[15:09] people
[15:10] as we go about our errands this week
[15:12] especially Saturday
[15:14] now of course we all be nervous you know
[15:16] one way
[15:18] but you know it ought to be a time of
[15:21] rejoicing praise God
[15:23] right because two like like like like
[15:25] God said it's not good for man to be
[15:27] alone
[15:28] not good for us and me alone so God had
[15:30] to make him a helpmate
[15:32] hallelujah our dear sister it wasn't
[15:35] good that Adam was alone
[15:38] now some are called to it like Paul just
[15:39] always want to bring Bells you know
[15:40] that's kind of my preaching is I always
[15:42] want to break it down Paul said I was I
[15:44] was have the gift to be single
[15:46] and he said I wish more people were
[15:48] single but you know that's his opinion
[15:49] today
[15:52] but God said Adam needs a help make
[15:55] praise God
[15:57] and then when these times were come you
[15:59] know uh the the cities and the streets
[16:01] will be filled with happiness oh it's
[16:03] the big day and uh in those days
[16:05] remember they pray that they prepared
[16:06] for a whole year
[16:07] the Bible said they uh the two fathers
[16:10] with the groom and the bride would make
[16:11] the engagement for one year and then uh
[16:14] the bride really wanted to see the groom
[16:15] for a whole year he'd be out building
[16:17] the house
[16:18] he'd be out preparing a home for his
[16:21] wives Hallelujah and she was just late
[16:24] with anticipation all the preparations
[16:26] would be made and so there'd be such joy
[16:28] in those little Villages you know Ramos
[16:31] Gilead or whoever it was Bethlehem and
[16:33] all the different Villages oh there's a
[16:35] wedding this week There's a wedding this
[16:37] week it was a time of Joy you'd hear
[16:39] people rejoicing praise God you'll be
[16:42] you see people happy Hallelujah amen
[16:46] again we get it in Jeremiah 16 verse 9.
[16:48] so you don't have to read this one but
[16:49] uh why don't you turn to Jeremiah 33 and
[16:51] I'll read two more verses so you turn to
[16:53] Jeremiah 33 10. I'll go to Jeremiah 16
[16:56] 9. for thus saith the Lord of hosts the
[16:58] god of Israel behold I will call us to
[16:59] cease out of this place in your eyes and
[17:01] in your days the voice of Mirth the
[17:03] voice of gladness the voice of the
[17:04] bridegroom and the voice of the Bride so
[17:07] God's judgment was going to bring a end
[17:10] to all the joy of weddings
[17:13] also in Jeremiah 25 10 moreover our take
[17:16] from them the voice of Mirth and the
[17:17] voice of gladness the voice of the
[17:19] bridegroom and the voice of the Bride
[17:20] the sound of millstones and the light of
[17:23] the candle
[17:25] God's judgment was going to remove their
[17:27] work but not not only their work their
[17:28] way to sustain themselves but it was
[17:30] also going to remove the marriages
[17:33] right but we get this beautiful promise
[17:36] there uh in Jeremiah 33 11. now let's
[17:40] read 10 though yeah there we go thank
[17:42] you honey I see yeah good job
[17:43] uh yeah awesome thus say the Lord again
[17:47] there should be heard in this place
[17:48] where Jesus should say shall be desolate
[17:50] with a man and without Beast even the
[17:52] cities of Judah in the streets of
[17:53] Jerusalem that are desolate without man
[17:55] and without inhabitants and without
[17:57] beasts so go to the next verse so what
[17:59] you've seen is Jeremiah's warning them
[18:01] three times I'm taking out I'm gonna
[18:03] take out all the joy I'm gonna take out
[18:05] all your work in other words I'm gonna
[18:06] allow Nebuchadnezzar and and uh Syria to
[18:10] remove you out of this land there'll be
[18:12] no more happy weddings I mean no more
[18:13] joyful times
[18:15] he says but I will bring it back
[18:17] hallelujah amen
[18:19] I'm gonna take it away because your sins
[18:21] but once you repent of your sins and
[18:24] come back I'm going to bring back the
[18:25] joy I'm going to bring back the
[18:27] rejoicing praise God again you're going
[18:29] to see happy children in the streets
[18:30] Hallelujah you're going to hear about it
[18:32] you're going to hear Happy brides and
[18:34] happy Grooms you know you're going to
[18:36] have it later on I'm giving you hope
[18:38] that it's going to come back praise God
[18:40] he called it the voice of Joy the voice
[18:42] of gladness the voice of the bridegroom
[18:44] and the voice of the Bride the voices of
[18:46] them that shall say praise the Lord of
[18:48] hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy
[18:50] and do it forever Hallelujah and of them
[18:53] that shall bring the sacrifice of praise
[18:54] into the house of the Lord for I will
[18:56] call us to return the Captivity land as
[18:58] at the first saith the Lord amen
[19:02] oh so beautiful so God says I'm going to
[19:04] take all this natural joy out so that
[19:07] you can get your life right spiritually
[19:08] but then when you get right spiritually
[19:10] I'll bring all this natural Joy back
[19:12] praise God amen why because God is good
[19:14] Hallelujah
[19:16] if God was good when he gave Adam and
[19:18] Eve one to another God was good when he
[19:20] gave all you know Esther and the
[19:22] hashmiris God was good Hallelujah and
[19:25] God is good when he gives Christ his
[19:27] bride hallelujah amen in each day each
[19:30] age each generation God is choosing now
[19:32] a bride Hallelujah men amen
[19:36] so let's remember this you know on
[19:37] Saturday let's let's listen especially
[19:39] to Austin's voice and Lena's voice we'll
[19:41] be hearing the voice of gladness
[19:44] right
[19:45] everything they say is gonna be real
[19:47] happy on Saturday right
[19:49] they're going to talk joyful
[19:51] we're going to hear joy and we're gonna
[19:53] hear their voices real happy praise God
[19:56] now just so you know God gave this same
[19:59] rebuke
[20:00] to the Vatican in Revelation 18 23
[20:04] when they're destroyed with of course
[20:06] the bombs of Russia and the light of the
[20:08] candle shall be no more at all in thee
[20:10] and the voice of the bridegroom and the
[20:12] voice of the
[20:13] uh and of the rise shall be heard no
[20:15] more at all in thee for thy Merchants
[20:17] were the Great Men of the Earth for thy
[20:19] sorceries were all I'm sorry for by thy
[20:22] sorceries We're All Nations deceived
[20:24] so the Vatican it must be in charge with
[20:27] all the merchants praise God right
[20:30] but God says I mean what this is one of
[20:32] the last things he says before uh this
[20:35] chapter closes
[20:36] right which shows one of the greatest
[20:38] joys in life is is marriages right it is
[20:41] weddings praise God
[20:43] is two people becoming one because it
[20:46] manifests it points to what all history
[20:48] is going to what is history going to
[20:50] history is going to the return of Jesus
[20:52] he's returning for his bride amen all it
[20:56] is through the very climax of the of the
[20:58] Gentile of the last two thousand years
[20:59] the climax will be Jesus coming down to
[21:02] Statue and take his wife off the Earth
[21:05] and take her to a wedding ceremony
[21:07] praise God amen amen and a wedding
[21:09] reception Hallelujah
[21:10] so if you would go to Song of Solomon
[21:12] here well let's get a few
[21:14] I'm just going to go over a few verses
[21:18] you know as you're turning that remember
[21:19] there's beautiful love stories in the
[21:21] Bible
[21:22] you know think of Jacob's love he worked
[21:23] 14 years for Rachel and the Bible said
[21:25] just like a few days
[21:27] that's some real love right there
[21:29] I worked 19 years at for copy Fairlawn
[21:32] and they don't feel like well I guess
[21:33] now they feel like a few days but
[21:36] all because of love all because of his
[21:38] love for Rachel 14 years felt just like
[21:40] a few days
[21:43] and we know love is such a great thing
[21:45] praise God Samson had a seven day
[21:48] wedding feast
[21:50] right so we know there were some
[21:51] celebrations if if the families could
[21:52] afford it it would last the whole week
[21:56] think about that all week long vacation
[21:58] just to celebrate one wedding
[22:00] now we kind of squeeze in just a couple
[22:02] hours
[22:04] because we're just life is so busy right
[22:07] there are so many deadlines and so many
[22:08] responsibilities
[22:09] but we also saw on the other side with
[22:11] funerals remember our people was a month
[22:12] that they mourned over Moses
[22:14] they take a whole month to mourn for a
[22:17] funeral takes seven days for a wedding
[22:20] so we see these Great Expressions of
[22:22] love
[22:24] now in uh in the book of Song of Solomon
[22:26] this again this is a very uh debated
[22:29] book
[22:31] but there's numerous themes and and uh I
[22:33] just want to look at just all the all
[22:35] the overall themes of this book
[22:38] um I preached on this back in 2010 I
[22:40] went and looked at my notes back in 2010
[22:41] so 13 years ago
[22:43] I appreciate the whole book verse five
[22:45] works and just showed as many types as
[22:47] we could now there's a couple of
[22:48] different thoughts you know some people
[22:49] think this book is a love triangle and
[22:52] there's one quote for brother brand
[22:53] where he actually acknowledges that but
[22:54] it's only one quote
[22:57] um
[22:58] but I I think the more close uh
[23:01] description is it's Solomon uh with his
[23:04] first wife that's the that's the
[23:06] interpretation that I can look at and I
[23:09] feel like would be the closest
[23:11] um uh the closest interpretation
[23:14] but we see you know the beginning
[23:16] chapter one we see a couple themes we
[23:18] see a a common girl
[23:22] who's working out in the sun and she's
[23:25] not royalty Glory
[23:27] a woman who's not royalty and she is
[23:30] subjected just to being a Shepherd a lot
[23:32] like Rachel right
[23:35] and she's she's not royalty she's not
[23:37] she hasn't had an easy life but Solomon
[23:39] in his kingdom he looks out on her and
[23:41] he has favor on her and he draws her
[23:44] into his presence praise God
[23:47] in other words she wouldn't be the woman
[23:48] you'd expect that Solomon would choose
[23:51] right
[23:53] but that's what verse 4 says remember uh
[23:55] She was drawn
[23:57] into the king's Chambers a lot like
[24:00] Esther right so we see a lot of
[24:02] similarities here with Esther just drawn
[24:04] into the love of God hallelujah now
[24:07] verse five she said I'm black but calmly
[24:09] oh ye Daughters of Jerusalem as
[24:11] intensive keter those were
[24:13] um
[24:14] these those are Gentile curtains as the
[24:17] curtains of Solomon
[24:19] look not upon me because I'm black
[24:21] because the son had looked upon me my
[24:23] mother's children were angry with me
[24:25] very uh they made me the keeper of The
[24:28] Vineyards but my own Vineyard have I not
[24:30] kept
[24:32] and so you know she in other words she's
[24:35] a little bit uh embarrassed that she's
[24:37] been working out in the sun and she's
[24:39] not uh she's not royalty but you think
[24:42] Solomon cares about that
[24:44] no these These are inhibitions that uh a
[24:46] young woman would have right oh does he
[24:50] really love me am I really good enough
[24:52] let me tell you Church you're good
[24:53] enough for Jesus you're good enough
[24:55] because he paid the price to die on the
[24:57] cross for your sins praise God you're
[24:59] good enough
[25:00] but I love just how this love story it
[25:03] includes all their inner battles
[25:05] right she's like well he loved me uh my
[25:08] mother my family mistreated me how could
[25:10] he how could the king love me when my
[25:12] own family won't love me oh man
[25:14] Hallelujah because God's love is divine
[25:16] love Hallelujah because God doesn't look
[25:18] on the outward appearance man look or
[25:20] God man looks at it but God looks on the
[25:22] heart praise God
[25:23] you saw Wednesday night with eliab
[25:26] Hallelujah
[25:27] the prophet and everybody looked on his
[25:29] outward appearance but God wasn't
[25:31] looking at the outward God was looking
[25:33] at the heart amen Solomon's looking at
[25:35] this woman is lovely right and she loves
[25:38] me and I want to make her my wife
[25:41] Hallelujah
[25:42] so we see that
[25:44] Solomon chooses a a strange Choice it
[25:47] wouldn't be maybe the
[25:49] it wouldn't be the the Top Choice is
[25:51] what we would think
[25:52] now verse eight I like how
[25:54] verse 8 says if thou no not oh thou
[25:58] embarrass among women go thy way forth
[26:00] by the footsteps of the flock and feed
[26:02] thy kids besides
[26:03] the Shepherds tits so here Solomon
[26:07] already calls her fairest among women
[26:10] so what was it that Solomon was out
[26:12] around his kingdom something just caught
[26:13] his eye with this woman
[26:15] she was just very special
[26:17] right
[26:19] and is that how it was when you got
[26:21] married as soon as you saw that person
[26:22] that person just caught your eye
[26:26] Hallelujah I remember when first saw
[26:28] Kristen up in the library
[26:30] God's my witness I was too ashamed to
[26:32] look at her just because I was such a
[26:33] nervous person I just stared out at the
[26:35] newspapers
[26:37] it wasn't until somebody had you know
[26:39] you need to call Christian
[26:40] we call her
[26:42] push me into it see God's gonna make
[26:44] sure you marry the right person amen
[26:47] and then I was shocked you don't have a
[26:49] boyfriend now this course said before I
[26:51] was a Christian you know how can this
[26:52] girl not have a boyfriend
[26:57] and so you know God works it out and
[27:01] and so Simon just she just caught
[27:03] Solomon's eye
[27:05] and uh and then he brought her into his
[27:09] Chambers the Bible says hallelujah
[27:13] now what's interesting churches in verse
[27:16] 12. now look at 12 here the woman is
[27:19] daydreaming about their wedding night
[27:23] so the Bible even records that and of
[27:25] course it's a very intimate course of
[27:27] scripture right
[27:28] uh
[27:29] while the king sitteth at his table my
[27:31] spitner sent his forth the smell thereof
[27:34] so she knows she's catching his
[27:36] attention because just like Esther she
[27:38] had to be prepared she had to go through
[27:40] the purification process
[27:42] right and Solomon was a king so
[27:45] just like Esther this shulamite would
[27:48] have had to been prepared and and she
[27:50] would have been purified just the way
[27:52] the king lies amen
[27:54] Hallelujah and your spiritual life is
[27:56] just what Jesus likes Hallelujah your
[27:58] praise your worship your love your
[28:00] Devotion to Christ that's just what he
[28:02] wants praise God hallelujah a life that
[28:05] obeys the word of God a life that once a
[28:07] life that wants to be pure think about
[28:10] that church all these other churches
[28:11] they won't come and be made pure to
[28:13] going to the king but you and I made a
[28:16] choice we come in the friends of the
[28:17] king we've submitted ourselves to the
[28:19] Holy Spirit to be purified to come
[28:21] before King Jesus Hallelujah man I
[28:24] didn't realize how close this would be
[28:25] to the Esther servant from last week I'm
[28:27] just catching it now it's very similar
[28:29] thoughts here
[28:30] now here we get her daydreaming
[28:34] I'm going to skip verse 13 for
[28:37] the sake of our children
[28:39] first
[28:41] 14 my beloved is unto me as a cluster of
[28:44] campfire in The Vineyards of engetti
[28:46] behold our Fair my love Behold our Fair
[28:49] thou has Dove's eyes
[28:51] Behold our Fair my beloved yay Pleasant
[28:54] also our bed is green the beams of our
[28:57] house are Cedar and the Raptors of first
[28:58] so she can already see where they're
[28:59] going to spend so you can see wow and
[29:02] she's daydreaming this is going to be my
[29:03] home someday we're gonna have our
[29:05] honeymoon here
[29:07] so she's already looking about that and
[29:09] look that's what they do and notice
[29:11] they're just complimenting each other
[29:12] you're beautiful
[29:14] you're handsome
[29:16] right right right uh
[29:21] and so that finishes chapter one
[29:23] we see how she's found she's at least
[29:25] likely
[29:26] we'd say bride
[29:28] so are you praise God all right the
[29:30] member saw it last week the Gentiles had
[29:32] no covenants no hope we had no hope but
[29:34] the blood of Jesus Christ has brought us
[29:36] nigh Hallelujah
[29:38] and then they daydream about their
[29:41] married life their their wedding night
[29:44] and then they think about and then they
[29:46] complement each other and they also see
[29:48] uh where their future home is going to
[29:50] be hallelujah amen
[29:55] now chapter two
[29:56] uh begins uh another
[30:00] it's the dreams of a home in the forest
[30:02] so here they're thinking about maybe
[30:04] like uh a getaway maybe this is like a
[30:07] for the honeymoon or something or maybe
[30:09] it's a Solomon had so much money maybe
[30:11] had a home out in the forest but chapter
[30:13] two verse one said I'm the rose of
[30:15] Sharon and the lily of the valleys
[30:17] as the Lily among Thorns so is my love
[30:20] among the daughters
[30:22] someone says all these other women are
[30:24] like Thorns but you're my Lily
[30:26] you're my special one Hallelujah
[30:31] so I just you know I love it you know uh
[30:34] just the way the Bible describes these
[30:36] are all ways to describe your your
[30:38] spouse
[30:39] you're the special one you're the one
[30:41] that caught my eye you're the one that
[30:42] uh gets all my attention
[30:45] you're the one that touched my heart
[30:46] praise God
[30:48] amen
[30:51] verse 4 let's go down to verse 4. he
[30:53] brought me to the banqueting house and
[30:55] His Banner Over Me his love his flag
[30:57] over me as love
[31:02] you know and then she starts daydreaming
[31:04] again in verses five I'm gonna skip
[31:05] verse six there
[31:07] um
[31:09] in verse 7 so
[31:13] and there's different characters talking
[31:14] but here uh she says I charge the OU
[31:17] dollars to Jerusalem by the rose and by
[31:19] the Hinds of the field that ye Stern not
[31:21] up nor awake my love Tilly please
[31:26] okay so you know we can get some
[31:28] different lessons from this one lesson
[31:30] we can get from this is It's advice to
[31:32] the young uh women that are not engaged
[31:35] yet don't stir up love before it's time
[31:38] right she said don't stir up my love
[31:41] right speaking of Solomon but it's good
[31:43] advice to all the the women don't rush
[31:45] into relationship
[31:47] right
[31:48] right it's a great reminder uh don't
[31:51] live in in sexual immorality right
[31:54] it's a great reminder of these things
[31:55] these things are are they're all laid
[31:58] out in here now look and also of course
[31:59] all this all this descriptive
[32:01] daydreaming and all
[32:02] it has all this all these details but it
[32:06] also gives stern warnings in here
[32:08] uh to live a Godly life praise God to
[32:10] wait upon the Lord
[32:12] now here's where Jesus is typed as
[32:14] dancing or skipping verse 8. where do
[32:18] you learn how to dance brother Jess from
[32:19] Jesus it's in verse 8. the voice of my
[32:23] beloved behold he come he cometh leaping
[32:25] upon the mountains he skipth upon the
[32:27] hills praise God this is how she
[32:29] pictured her husband he just he runs all
[32:31] over the hills and he's just happy
[32:33] the voice of the ride group amen he's
[32:36] just singing on The Hills he just
[32:38] rejoices it's almost our wedding day
[32:41] and brother bear said when he danced
[32:43] around that that tree up there in the
[32:45] Colorado mountains and remember he heard
[32:47] the wolf uh he heard the the different
[32:49] animals howling to their mates he saw
[32:51] him he remember he saw the rainbow
[32:52] through the uh the ice and everything he
[32:54] said oh God you're the god of creation
[32:56] he said I went round and around he said
[32:58] he said I was just like David like David
[33:01] danced before the Lord he said people
[33:03] would have thought I was insane up there
[33:04] running around the tree praise God
[33:07] but now he said I was praising my banker
[33:09] Hallelujah I was praising God I was just
[33:11] like David hallelujah amen
[33:14] I'm skipping around the tree
[33:18] he said that's where we get it Solomon
[33:19] that's what she imagined
[33:21] his voice was like a man up there in the
[33:24] mountains enjoying his his pastures and
[33:26] his uh his planting and his Harvest
[33:28] praise God Amen
[33:31] so this is their dreams now later on in
[33:34] chapter two they have a formal uh
[33:37] banquet
[33:38] and then spring arrives
[33:40] in chapter 2
[33:44] all right I think I'll skip skip ahead
[33:46] here
[33:48] let's skip ahead here to chapter two I'm
[33:51] sorry chapter three verse 9. I'm going
[33:53] to skip ahead here to the
[33:56] um
[33:57] to the time of of the wedding here by
[33:59] God's grace
[34:01] yeah I must have typed the wrong number
[34:02] there yeah let's go ahead to the wedding
[34:03] here here's where we clearly see in
[34:06] Solomon here marrying the shulamite
[34:11] King Solomon made him a chair of wood of
[34:13] Lebanon he made the pillars there of a
[34:14] silver in the bottom thereof of gold the
[34:17] covering of it a purple
[34:19] the myths thereof being paid with love I
[34:23] like that Hallelujah
[34:25] for the daughters of Jerusalem go forth
[34:27] O ye Daughters of Zion and behold King
[34:29] Solomon with a crown wherewith his
[34:31] mother crown him in the Day of His
[34:32] espousals and the day of the gladness of
[34:35] his heart
[34:37] so we see Solomon coming to the uh the
[34:39] the wedding here he's on a chariot
[34:43] and is paved with love praise God
[34:46] amen amen I'm sure all the roads that
[34:48] Austin's going to drive on Saturday when
[34:50] he when he finally takes lean away
[34:51] they're going to be paid with love
[34:53] aren't they yeah
[34:56] because God is directing God's directing
[34:58] the as they drive away that's their path
[35:00] it's like a type that's their path
[35:01] they're going to go on a journey
[35:02] together serving the lord God's going to
[35:05] guide and direct them praise God because
[35:07] Solomon's way was paid with love
[35:09] Hallelujah their future is paved with
[35:12] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[35:14] love of Christ I love all the symbolism
[35:16] in here
[35:20] Hallelujah
[35:22] now I want to um
[35:24] look at a few verses in here
[35:26] yeah chapter four here uh we see is like
[35:29] the wedding night here the wedding and
[35:31] the wedding night
[35:32] now in chapter four uh the bride I'm
[35:35] sorry the bridegroom Solomon starts
[35:37] describing the woman and he and he
[35:40] starts from the head all the way down to
[35:41] the feet
[35:43] he describes almost nearly every body
[35:45] part of her
[35:48] and then he says verse 7 thou are all
[35:50] fair my love there's no spot in thee
[35:53] at church we all know we have flaws in
[35:55] ourselves right we all got scars
[35:57] I got we got birthmarks
[36:00] but this is love talking this is love
[36:02] saying no matter what you are I love
[36:04] everything about you praise God
[36:06] because you're mine Hallelujah
[36:09] that's what love does that's what
[36:10] marriage does looks past all of our
[36:12] faults right
[36:13] and rejoices that we have a spouse that
[36:17] we have someone to love praise God
[36:21] right I mean think about the woman you
[36:22] know the shulamite she's out there
[36:23] working with the
[36:25] the Sheep all day you know surely she
[36:27] had to get scratched or scars or
[36:30] something you know maybe she had to
[36:31] fight off a lion or bear or something
[36:32] she would not have just had it we'd say
[36:34] a perfect body right
[36:37] but in in his eyes in your spouse's eyes
[36:41] we ought to love everything about our
[36:43] spouse praise God that's what I preach
[36:45] at the marriage banquet over there in
[36:46] Pennsylvania you know
[36:48] especially with men men and men are
[36:50] tempted to you know look elsewhere and
[36:52] be distracted but I told them you got to
[36:54] make your wife the most beautiful one
[36:56] and you got to keep your attention on
[36:57] your wife praise God
[36:59] Hallelujah and I know part of that goes
[37:02] the man's got to take care of his body
[37:03] he's got to stay healthy the woman
[37:04] should take care of her body too praise
[37:06] God you want your spouse to make uh to
[37:08] think you're beautiful then you're
[37:09] enhance him that you ought to act like a
[37:11] praise God all right don't let yourself
[37:13] go to waste why would you let the temple
[37:15] of God be destroyed praise God
[37:18] right why would you defile purposely to
[37:20] file and not maintain the Temple of the
[37:23] Lord praying it's God's Temple praise
[37:24] God Hallelujah
[37:28] but that that's what love should be I
[37:31] love everything about you praise God
[37:32] hallelujah
[37:35] like I told my wife many times she said
[37:37] honey you just get more beautiful with
[37:38] each passing year
[37:40] I do tell her that I believe that's true
[37:41] that's true
[37:43] Hallelujah that's to me that's just my
[37:46] my desire
[37:48] I believe that verse 9.
[37:51] I like this that must ravish my heart my
[37:53] sister my spouse see when a man is fully
[37:56] in love with that woman everything's
[37:58] great about her
[37:59] right so right now Lena has no Faults in
[38:02] Austin's eyes there's nothing
[38:04] she's all perfect
[38:07] Hallelujah because his his heart's been
[38:10] ravished his heart's been won praise God
[38:12] this is the one I'm gonna love
[38:13] Hallelujah
[38:16] thus ravished my heart with one of thine
[38:19] eyes with one chain of thyness just one
[38:21] of them just if you look if I just saw
[38:23] one of your eyes and you're you're
[38:24] sideways if I just saw one of your eyes
[38:26] it just grabs all my attention
[38:29] that's all it takes is one little look
[38:32] and you got my attention how fair
[38:38] is the smell of thine ointments than all
[38:40] spices
[38:42] and again goes through some descriptive
[38:44] Parts here
[38:49] um in verse 16 Solomon calls his wife a
[38:52] garden
[38:54] okay so here we see the wedding night
[38:56] and then in chapter five verse one he
[38:58] says I'm coming to my garden my sister
[39:00] my spouse
[39:01] and then notice at the end of verse 1
[39:03] and chapter five oh friends drink ye or
[39:06] drink yay drink abundantly oh beloved so
[39:10] here we get another admonition when a
[39:11] couple gets married they need to stay in
[39:13] love
[39:15] right Simon's a newly married man and
[39:17] yet someone speaks in this in this
[39:20] letter and says you who are married stay
[39:23] in love praise God enjoy love abundantly
[39:26] praise God
[39:27] right Hallelujah in other words don't
[39:29] let things separate your love
[39:31] right
[39:33] I'm talking kind of Broad in general so
[39:35] you know what I'm talking about now keep
[39:36] your spot there but Paul says the same
[39:38] thing in First Corinthians 7 let's read
[39:39] that that just came to my mind a
[39:40] different to have that prepared
[39:48] First Corinthians 7.
[39:50] verse one now concerning the things
[39:52] wherever he wrote unto me it is not I'm
[39:54] sorry it is good for a man not to touch
[39:56] a woman nevertheless avoid fornication
[39:58] every man have his own wife and let
[40:00] every woman have her own husband let the
[40:02] husband Render unto the wife do
[40:04] benevolence and likewise also the wife
[40:07] unto the husband
[40:10] so the husband and wife give each other
[40:12] over to one another right verse four the
[40:15] wife hath not power of her own body but
[40:18] the husband
[40:19] and likewise also the husband hath not
[40:21] power over his own body but the wife
[40:24] okay so this is what they're saying in
[40:26] Song of Solomon keep the love alive
[40:29] praise God a but enjoy it enjoy married
[40:32] life abundantly that's what the Bible
[40:33] says right right verse five now defraud
[40:37] means to Rob so Paul says Rob not to one
[40:40] another
[40:41] so married couples sometimes if they're
[40:43] not careful can rob one another
[40:44] in this way
[40:46] right the Bible says don't do that
[40:48] except it be with consent for a time so
[40:52] it should only be agreed upon right
[40:54] Song of Solomon says drink abundantly
[40:56] right do this uh show express love to
[41:00] one another abundantly and then Paul
[41:01] says
[41:03] do it abundantly he said he said Keep
[41:05] Your Love alive always keep your love
[41:06] alive and only stay apart when it's
[41:09] consented unto prayer and fasting
[41:12] okay prayer fasting that's what it says
[41:15] in verse 5. that ye may give yourselves
[41:17] to fasting in prayer and come together
[41:19] again that Satan tempt you not for your
[41:22] incontinency
[41:24] so see again a lesson we learned there
[41:25] if a couple is not staying in love or uh
[41:28] loving abundantly then Satan can get in
[41:31] there
[41:32] right right
[41:35] so it's it's quite I mean think about
[41:36] that and the Bible says if a man don't
[41:38] treat his wife well his prayers will be
[41:40] hindered
[41:41] so there's so many things spiritually
[41:43] going on that can just be solved if a
[41:45] couple just stays in love amen right
[41:48] Hallelujah right you get so many more
[41:51] spiritual victories
[41:53] if we just stay in Love by God's grace
[41:55] that's just maybe the way I'll say it
[41:57] for today
[41:58] Hallelujah
[42:02] yes there we go verse five Hallelujah
[42:03] now verse six but I speak this by
[42:05] permission and not by commandment now he
[42:08] might say permission but that's a real
[42:09] good permission right there that's a
[42:11] pretty wise permission
[42:13] and I'll just say this I'm gonna try to
[42:15] say this very broadly honey
[42:16] we have a we have friends that are going
[42:18] through a difficult marriage situation
[42:20] I'm gonna try to say this is Brownies
[42:22] okay
[42:24] and the struggles they've gone through
[42:26] are so extreme
[42:29] uh it's it's almost unbelievable to know
[42:32] what they're going through
[42:34] mainly because one person has been
[42:36] unfaithful I think that maybe that's the
[42:37] best and just in so many ways so many
[42:40] ways
[42:41] and uh and it has just cause my wife and
[42:44] I to really appreciate
[42:47] God's grace in our lives right
[42:50] right and I said this before you know
[42:52] over the pulpit there's nothing like
[42:54] loyal love
[42:56] that's why Psalm of Solomon is written
[42:59] there is no love like the love between
[43:01] one man and one woman married
[43:04] right
[43:05] and I just want to share that we have
[43:07] you know
[43:09] it's just been hard to hard to explain
[43:13] the pain that is caused when a person is
[43:16] unfaithful
[43:18] right
[43:21] I mean people will suffer for
[43:25] every day every day they'll suffer
[43:27] I mean weeks on end months
[43:29] every day is uncertain
[43:31] it's going to be a divorce what's going
[43:33] to happen I mean everything's uncertain
[43:35] things and and people have thoughts they
[43:37] never thought about why because the
[43:39] devil got in there
[43:41] right right
[43:43] they didn't keep the vows that they
[43:45] promised that's why we're gonna go make
[43:47] vows next week
[43:48] hallelujah we're gonna have you guys
[43:50] make vows that's that's what it's all
[43:52] about the promise
[43:53] and you're promising we're going to be
[43:55] true to another so God can remain in
[43:57] your marriage and God can bless your
[43:58] family Hallelujah you can overcome Satan
[44:01] that's one great way to overcome Satan
[44:03] is by staying in love with your spouse
[44:04] praise God
[44:05] mm-hmm
[44:08] you know and I've had numerous preachers
[44:10] that's why they've had me preach the
[44:11] marriage Banquets numerous preachers
[44:12] tell me Jesse we love
[44:13] that you love your wife and the way you
[44:15] do and that's why we want you to come
[44:17] and preach to our men about how to love
[44:19] their wives
[44:21] so I don't know I'll say all I know is
[44:23] that when I was growing up my parents
[44:25] were divorced and all I wanted was a
[44:27] happy marriage
[44:28] that's all I wanted
[44:29] I just wanted someone to love me that's
[44:31] all I just wanted a happy marriage and I
[44:34] told you that testimony before right
[44:36] when I called the message my only prayer
[44:37] was Lord I want the Holy Ghost and Lord
[44:39] please let me be married a little while
[44:40] before the Rapture so I can enjoy it I
[44:42] can enjoy married life because I just
[44:44] wanted to know what that was like
[44:46] and God's given me 20 years Hallelujah
[44:51] but
[44:53] but to understand that that's what the
[44:54] song of Solomon's all about
[44:55] [Applause]
[44:57] now that's a natural love but we know
[44:59] there's a song greater than that that's
[45:00] the love of Jesus Christ praise God Amen
[45:02] but for the Old Testament they put it in
[45:03] there to show
[45:05] love is one is one of the greatest
[45:07] things they put it it was the greatest
[45:09] thing but of course what they meant was
[45:10] Christ and the church
[45:12] right because brother bam said we know
[45:13] what every scripture points to Jesus
[45:16] so the song of songs is that a king
[45:18] chose you to be his bride amen that's
[45:21] the song or song we didn't deserve it we
[45:23] were out there we never we thought it'd
[45:24] never be us I'm imperfect there's
[45:26] nothing good about me but you found
[45:28] favor in his eyes amen and he says
[45:30] you're all together lovely Hallelujah
[45:33] that's what the Bible says
[45:36] you can be all together lovely and your
[45:38] soul is what he's talking about praise
[45:39] God
[45:42] Glory
[45:48] all right so I just want to lay that in
[45:49] there because that's the subject of Song
[45:51] of Songs I didn't set my timer how long
[45:53] have I been here
[45:55] how many
[45:57] okay 10 minutes
[45:58] that says 46. I think you're right but I
[46:01] think some typo on there there's a bug
[46:03] in that
[46:08] I wasn't planning on preaching hour and
[46:09] a half I just wanted to get our hearts
[46:11] focused on the scriptures about love
[46:13] this is the great a momentous it's a
[46:15] Once a lifetime thing it's it's a
[46:17] momentous beautiful
[46:19] uh event that's happening here let me
[46:22] finish up here with song of Solomons I
[46:24] put a 15 minute timer on here so maybe
[46:25] I'll go 15 or 20.
[46:27] um I just want to hit a few highlights
[46:29] now after their first night together
[46:31] they start they have a few marriage
[46:33] problems that's what I want to share as
[46:34] well right after the wedding
[46:37] let me go back to Song of Songs
[46:41] um
[46:42] in verse chapter 5 verse 2
[46:47] um it's right after the wedding sometime
[46:48] after
[46:49] the husband knocks on the door but the
[46:51] wife doesn't get up quick enough to
[46:52] answer now that's a beautiful type of
[46:54] God knocking at our hearts and we don't
[46:56] respond with prayer or worship soon
[46:58] enough right and it offends the husband
[47:00] the husband leaves but did they give up
[47:03] on each other they get divorced
[47:05] oh no they stay together there's Happy
[47:07] Times ahead
[47:09] I mean no there's seasons of marriage I
[47:11] have Beatrice and Jose oppresso amen
[47:12] there are seasons of marriage
[47:15] right this was a difficult season right
[47:17] after no don't have to be right it don't
[47:19] have to happen during the honeymoon you
[47:20] know but hopefully not but
[47:22] you know she didn't rise up and then she
[47:24] goes in verses six and seven goes to
[47:26] seek him to find him because she's sick
[47:28] of love
[47:29] she knows she fell short she knows she
[47:32] mistreated her husband and she wants to
[47:33] go make it right
[47:38] all right
[47:41] and then of course you know at the end
[47:43] of chapter 10 they I'm sorry at the end
[47:46] of chapter 5 verse 10 the woman goes
[47:49] through and says all the beautiful
[47:50] things about the husband head to toe
[47:53] right it's like Austin your dark hair is
[47:55] so dark it's like it's like the darkness
[47:57] of night it's so dark
[48:01] right and it goes through
[48:05] so these are little these are hints on
[48:07] romance right here
[48:10] his eyes are as the eyes of doves
[48:13] by the rivers of water
[48:16] let's see
[48:19] they're just beautiful descriptions
[48:22] and then in verse 16 she says his mouth
[48:24] is most sweet yay he is all together
[48:26] lovely he's my beloved and this is my
[48:30] friend
[48:31] right and later there's verses that that
[48:33] where the woman says this is the one
[48:35] whom my soul loves
[48:37] right that's why we call it the soul
[48:39] mate
[48:40] your two Souls
[48:42] we're together right
[48:44] that's what we believe they had to be
[48:46] taken apart now they come back together
[48:47] Hallelujah
[48:50] in marriage by God's grace
[48:52] so see even after difficult trials where
[48:55] one will fail another the love has to be
[48:57] restored they have to say we're sorry we
[49:00] have to let's start all over again by
[49:01] God's grace
[49:04] and then the love can return
[49:08] now um
[49:14] there's some just some beautiful uh
[49:15] descriptions in here now they're already
[49:18] married let's go to chapter six verse
[49:19] eight they're already married look at
[49:20] this there are three score queens and
[49:22] four score concubines and versions
[49:23] without number Mike Dove my undefiled is
[49:26] but one she is the only one of her
[49:28] mother she's the choice one of that her
[49:30] that bear her the daughter saw her and
[49:32] blessed her yay the queens and the
[49:34] concubines and they praised her
[49:38] okay so this is the the the the the
[49:39] voice of the husband
[49:42] my one she's my dub she's my choice one
[49:45] praise God and that's the love we got to
[49:47] have as husband that's the love we got
[49:48] to have for our wives Hallelujah
[49:54] now chapter seven
[49:56] chapter seven gets into mature love
[50:00] and I want to go down to verse 10.
[50:03] as one of the seasons in marriage you
[50:05] gotta find times to get away from your
[50:07] busy life
[50:08] so recently you know we for our 20th
[50:10] anniversary we had that's one of our
[50:11] best getaways I think ever by God's
[50:13] grace
[50:14] might have been the best of all the all
[50:16] of them
[50:17] um but verse 10 I am my beloveds and his
[50:19] desires toward me chapter 7 verse 10.
[50:21] come my beloved let us go forth into the
[50:23] field let us Lodge in The Villages let
[50:25] us get up early to The Vineyards let us
[50:28] see a Divine flourish whether the tender
[50:30] grape appear
[50:31] and the pomegrass bought forth and there
[50:33] will I give thee my loves the mandrakes
[50:35] give a smell and at our gates are all
[50:37] manner of pleasant fruits new and old
[50:38] which I have laid up for thee o my
[50:40] beloved in other words she made
[50:41] preparations we're gonna have a go get a
[50:43] getaway and we're going to spend time
[50:45] reuniting there
[50:47] okay so see marriages have that there's
[50:49] all the excitement leading up
[50:51] right and then there's trials but the
[50:53] Love Remains but then you got to make
[50:55] efforts to get away and rekindle the
[50:58] love as well
[50:59] special efforts to do that
[51:03] now the book ends with chapter eight
[51:06] and
[51:11] we see how love is so strong and and the
[51:15] we see this unending desire for these
[51:17] two to love each other all the way to
[51:19] the end they can't wait to be together
[51:22] Hallelujah and that's what we want is
[51:24] married couples we want our love to be
[51:27] strong that we can't wait to be together
[51:29] Hallelujah
[51:31] all right so let's read that here
[51:36] let's read verse six set me as a seal
[51:39] Paul thine heart as a seal upon thine
[51:41] arm for love is strong as death jealousy
[51:44] is cruel is the grave the coals thereof
[51:46] are coals of fire which have a most
[51:48] vehement flame many Waters cannot quench
[51:51] love neither can the floods drown if a
[51:53] man would give all a substance of his
[51:55] house for love it would be utterly
[51:57] content in other words love is greater
[51:59] than anything
[52:00] right just as death is final right death
[52:03] is final when someone dies don't see him
[52:05] again
[52:06] the Bible says love is greater than that
[52:09] right because death will be cast the
[52:11] Lake of Fire right but the love of
[52:13] Christ will continue Without End praise
[52:14] God for all eternity but the only the
[52:17] closest thing they can get to understand
[52:19] uh The Power of Love is to look at death
[52:22] because it's so final
[52:24] but there's a power greater than that
[52:26] love is greater than that love has no
[52:28] end Hallelujah the love of Jesus Christ
[52:32] I love it you know verse 14 what goes
[52:34] we'll close this portion with verse 14.
[52:37] the woman is talking again the the bride
[52:39] and the wife make haste my beloved and
[52:42] be thou like to a row or to a young
[52:44] heart upon the mountain of spices so in
[52:47] other words he's saying surely or is she
[52:49] saying come quickly my Lord and that's
[52:51] what John said come quickly Lord Jesus
[52:53] praise God
[52:54] see that
[52:56] so we see just a beautiful story I'm
[52:59] just going to overview you know for for
[53:01] you to understand it and I would
[53:02] encourage you read it uh read it when
[53:03] you get a chance it's a great great book
[53:05] if you haven't read it yet
[53:08] you know love is a special time
[53:10] uh when brother random got married or
[53:11] when brother tried to get engaged to
[53:13] hope he he couldn't do it face to face
[53:15] he couldn't get on a knee
[53:17] right so he did it in a letter
[53:18] he mailed it in the mail he was so so
[53:21] timid
[53:22] and then he didn't see her until they
[53:25] went to church right
[53:27] and brother and so he was sitting by her
[53:29] all the time in church wondering if
[53:31] she's going to accept his proposal that
[53:32] he wrote in the letter
[53:35] and brother Brandon said well I said now
[53:37] well she'll tell me after church well
[53:39] Billy I'm sorry but this is our last
[53:40] night together
[53:42] so he was bound all the negative
[53:43] thoughts right
[53:45] I could just hear her say oh I I just
[53:47] know what she was going to say it so I
[53:48] went out I never heard a thing that Dr
[53:50] Davis said and he just preached on I
[53:53] never heard a thing in the sermon
[53:58] I was worrying about what was going on
[54:00] to happen when I got outside of the
[54:02] church
[54:04] so see how love can just overtake you
[54:07] you don't hear one thing the preacher
[54:09] said
[54:13] love is important right love it love is
[54:15] important to our hearts we want to be
[54:16] loved we want safety we want security we
[54:18] want someone to love us
[54:19] brother bam you know after he was
[54:21] married to Sister Mita in 1962 If
[54:23] Abraham says this
[54:25] and the scripture he used is uh
[54:28] second Peter chapter one so let me read
[54:30] that real quick second Peter chapter one
[54:31] I believe it's verse four
[54:40] yes whereby are giving us exceeding
[54:42] great and precious promises that by
[54:44] these you might be partakers of the
[54:46] divine nature having escaped the
[54:48] corruption that is in the world through
[54:49] lust
[54:51] now the words divine nature
[54:54] partakers of the Divine Natures in other
[54:56] words you and I
[54:58] uh partake of the spirit of God right
[55:01] the Bible says you drink the Waters of
[55:02] life you eat the bread of life right
[55:04] brother and reads the scripture and it
[55:06] makes him think of his wife Mira
[55:09] and here's what he says
[55:11] he said excuses expression I told my
[55:13] wife here not long ago we're both
[55:15] getting old and I said to her I said do
[55:17] you love me like you used to so honey
[55:19] I'm gonna ask you that after service and
[55:22] she said I certainly do
[55:23] and I said you know I love you so much
[55:25] so I would like to take you in pull you
[55:28] inside of me so we could just be really
[55:30] be one
[55:34] now that he says multiply that by a
[55:37] hundred million and then you'll find out
[55:39] how the believer Who falls in love with
[55:41] Christ
[55:43] wants to get into Christ because it's a
[55:46] love
[55:47] and here he's going to show us how that
[55:49] through these promises we might be made
[55:51] partakers of Christ's divine nature
[55:53] these mortal bodies how we can be
[55:56] partakers of immortality
[55:59] amen
[56:02] now that's that that never would
[56:04] occurred to me partake in divine nature
[56:06] that makes me think I want to take
[56:07] partake of my wife coming inside and
[56:09] living inside of me but that's what a
[56:11] paid program think of
[56:14] husband wife Christ in the church
[56:19] and then brother Graham gives them in
[56:21] marriage advice here
[56:25] he says I believe that God gives us a
[56:27] mate and then we become part of each
[56:28] other and before a man gets married he
[56:31] should think all these things over study
[56:33] it a young man asked me the other day
[56:35] you think I could get ought to get
[56:36] married brother bands of such and such a
[56:37] girl I said how much do you think of her
[56:40] he said oh my I just love her I said
[56:42] well if you're not going to live without
[56:44] her you better marry her then but if you
[56:47] can live without her you better not
[56:50] so but if it's going to kill you you
[56:52] better go ahead and get married and I
[56:54] said and so what I was trying to get to
[56:57] him this was that if you love her so
[56:59] much
[57:01] and that's you know I heard this quote
[57:03] and after I heard this quote I knew I
[57:04] was going to propose to Kristen I didn't
[57:06] know if she's going to say yes
[57:08] no I knew she's gonna say yes
[57:11] but after I heard that quote I heard
[57:13] brother Ram saying only marry her if you
[57:15] can't live without her I couldn't you
[57:16] know I couldn't picture anybody else
[57:18] marrying her I was like No One's Gonna
[57:19] Marry Her
[57:22] I gotta have her she's gonna be mine
[57:24] you know all the other brothers are
[57:26] getting married around distantly I'm
[57:28] gonna have her
[57:30] right you gotta have like a jealousy or
[57:32] kind of a
[57:33] you just have a desire right you're just
[57:35] you're zealous over that one person
[57:37] right that's that's what you got to have
[57:38] Hallelujah
[57:40] that's what my man says you got to have
[57:42] that
[57:44] he said now before you're married
[57:46] everything's just fine and dandy but
[57:47] after you get married then the toils and
[57:49] trials of Life come now there's the hard
[57:51] part
[57:52] he said that's when you've got to be so
[57:54] in love now I just shared how you do
[57:55] that you stay in love together
[57:56] physically
[57:58] you got to be so in love that you
[57:59] understand one another when you're
[58:01] disappointed in her she's disappointed
[58:03] in you until you understand one another
[58:04] that's the way it is with Christ we've
[58:07] got to be so in love with him to when we
[58:09] ask for something and he doesn't give it
[58:11] to us that doesn't shake us a bit
[58:13] [Music]
[58:16] how many times have I asked for my
[58:17] parents to come in the message or Mike
[58:19] to be healed different prayer requests
[58:21] we've asked over the years but even if
[58:23] he doesn't give it to me I love him
[58:25] anyway
[58:27] it doesn't shake me I know Jesus loves
[58:29] me
[58:30] why the only way you can do it is to
[58:32] become partakers of his divine nature
[58:34] and you'll understand he said I'm sorry
[58:36] he says then you'll understand the
[58:38] reason he can't give it to you partakers
[58:41] of the divine nature now I don't know
[58:42] when we'll understand
[58:44] I don't I don't know when we'll
[58:45] understand why God doesn't answer our
[58:47] prayers but I believe someday we will
[58:49] right right
[58:51] I want to read you a couple love letters

[1:01:00] years of such happiness has come to few
[1:01:04] men
[1:01:05] that beautiful
[1:01:07] I told you once that it was like an
[1:01:09] adolescent's dream of what marriage
[1:01:11] should be like
[1:01:13] that hasn't changed in other words it's
[1:01:15] like a Boyhood dream to be married to

[1:01:22] last two days made it plain I only love

[1:01:33] lost in time and space this guy's pretty
[1:01:35] good if only this rhyme he'd be
[1:01:39] the most romantic man ever
[1:01:41] I more than love you I'm not whole
[1:01:44] without you you are life itself to me
[1:01:47] now I'm thinking about Christ in the
[1:01:48] church something about Adam and Eve I'm
[1:01:50] thinking about your soul mate
[1:01:52] isn't that how God made it work wasn't
[1:01:54] Eve a part of Adam Adam wasn't whole
[1:01:57] without that's why he'd willingly sinned
[1:01:59] to redeem her back he couldn't live
[1:02:01] without her
[1:02:03] you are life itself to me when you are
[1:02:06] gone I'm waiting for you to return so I
[1:02:08] can start living again

[1:02:19] wonderful years I love you your grateful
[1:02:21] husband
[1:02:23] that beautiful
[1:02:26] let's go to John 14.
[1:02:28] I want to read a few love letters to you
[1:02:30] from Jesus
[1:02:33] I'm almost there
[1:02:38] John 14 verse one I don't know one of
[1:02:40] the most beautiful love letters I think
[1:02:41] I've ever read right here
[1:02:44] let not your heartbeat heart troubled
[1:02:47] you believe in God believe also in me
[1:02:51] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:02:53] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:02:57] I go to repair a place for you
[1:03:00] isn't that beautiful Jesus has a place
[1:03:02] just for you now I think if we're
[1:03:05] married I believe Jesus that place is
[1:03:06] for you and your spouse because we're
[1:03:08] joint heirs together of the grace of God
[1:03:12] I go prepare a place for you like I told
[1:03:14] Brothers how can you imagine Eve or Adam
[1:03:16] having a mansion without Eve
[1:03:18] like they they were one in the beginning
[1:03:20] they were he died for her basically you
[1:03:24] know he sacrificed himself for her
[1:03:26] how could they not be together for all
[1:03:28] eternity
[1:03:28] be ridiculous to think them not together
[1:03:30] how do you think of it Sarah without
[1:03:32] thinking of Abraham
[1:03:33] how do you think of Christ without
[1:03:35] thinking of the church hallelujah amen
[1:03:38] Christ of the church
[1:03:40] verse 3.
[1:03:43] and if I go prepare a place for you I
[1:03:45] will come again and receive unto myself
[1:03:47] that where I am there ye may be also and
[1:03:50] whether I go you know you know and the
[1:03:52] way you know and time is saying to him
[1:03:54] Lord we know not whether
[1:03:56] we know the way Jesus say to him I am
[1:03:59] the way the truth and the life no man
[1:04:02] cometh and the father but by me
[1:04:05] so Austin Lena's road is paid with love
[1:04:08] what way what what road is it it's the
[1:04:10] way it's Jesus Christ's word
[1:04:12] that's the way of love following Jesus
[1:04:15] Christ in his word he said he never
[1:04:16] leave us he never forsake us that will
[1:04:19] be the way
[1:04:20] to follow and then that will take you to
[1:04:23] your future home the rooms the places he
[1:04:25] has prepared for you in glory
[1:04:28] isn't that beautiful love letter how
[1:04:29] many thought that was a love letter
[1:04:30] right there
[1:04:31] go to chapter 17. I love this
[1:04:34] I think those are some of the most
[1:04:35] encouraging words when I'm struggling
[1:04:37] when I'm when I'm when I'm troubled
[1:04:39] Jesus says be not troubled those are
[1:04:41] some of the most encouraging words to me
[1:04:43] amen he says because I I'm going to
[1:04:45] prepare a place for you he says don't
[1:04:47] let your heart be troubled brother Jess
[1:04:49] isn't that awesome
[1:04:51] don't be trouble don't be anxious don't
[1:04:52] be fearful anything brother Jesse I've
[1:04:55] gone to prepare a place for you
[1:04:57] so you won't be alone you'll never be
[1:04:59] alone I'll be with you
[1:05:00] I'll be with you in the spirit now I'm
[1:05:02] with you later in the Corporal body
[1:05:05] John 17 verse 11.
[1:05:08] and now I am no more in the world but
[1:05:10] these
[1:05:12] are in the world and I have come to the
[1:05:14] Holy Father keep them through thine own
[1:05:16] name Those whom thou has given me that
[1:05:18] name may be one as we are
[1:05:21] while I was with them in the world I
[1:05:23] kept them in thy name those that thou
[1:05:25] gave us me I have kept and none of them
[1:05:28] is lost but the Son of Perdition that
[1:05:29] the scripture might be fulfilled
[1:05:31] and now I come to thee and these things
[1:05:33] I speak in the world that they might
[1:05:35] have joy fulfilled in themselves so this
[1:05:38] ought to make us joyful and the church
[1:05:39] said
[1:05:40] amen all these things Jesus prayed for
[1:05:42] our Oneness with the heavenly father in
[1:05:44] other words with the Holy Spirit
[1:05:45] that our joy might be fulfilled in US
[1:05:48] that we would not be troubled
[1:05:51] verse 14 here's how we get joy I have
[1:05:54] given them Thy word hallelujah and the
[1:05:56] world has hated them because they are
[1:05:57] not in the world even as I am not of the
[1:05:59] world I pray not that thou shouldest
[1:06:00] take them out of the world so yeah
[1:06:02] sometimes we want to get out of this
[1:06:03] place right
[1:06:04] Jesus and pray for us to leave
[1:06:06] what do you pray for but the thou
[1:06:08] shouldest keep them from the evil praise
[1:06:10] God hallelujah
[1:06:13] Jesus want us to stay here he wants us
[1:06:15] to overcome he want us to overcome the
[1:06:18] evil and if we're married we've got to
[1:06:20] use we gotta let our spouse work
[1:06:22] together with our spouse in the love of
[1:06:23] God to overcome the evil one praise God
[1:06:26] right it's exactly right
[1:06:28] and God will hear our prayers right
[1:06:30] Satan we'll get into our our families
[1:06:32] right
[1:06:33] because we keep the love alive the love
[1:06:36] of Jesus Christ
[1:06:38] oh it's beautiful praise God verse 16.

[1:07:00] has set me into the world even so I have
[1:07:02] also sent them into the world and for
[1:07:04] their sakes I sanctify myself that they

[1:07:08] truth neither pray I for these alone but
[1:07:11] for them also which Shall Believe on me
[1:07:13] through their word that's where Jesus
[1:07:15] prayed for you praise God
[1:07:17] he said I pray for my disciples and all
[1:07:20] those that will hear through their word
[1:07:21] hallelujah amen

[1:07:25] in the four gospels we're reading the
[1:07:27] words of the men Jesus prayed for and he
[1:07:30] prayed that we would be blessed and God
[1:07:31] would keep us right from all troubles
[1:07:34] and from all fear and keep us from all
[1:07:35] unbelief all these things if we just
[1:07:37] believe the word of his apostles
