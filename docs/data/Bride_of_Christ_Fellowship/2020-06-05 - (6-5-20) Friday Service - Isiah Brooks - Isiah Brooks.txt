here tonight I think we were supposed to be here a month or two ago schedule wouldn't allow it to happen but you know I am so happy I am really thrilled I couldn't remember the verses to that song so that's why I went for the chorus oh you don't have the verses okay that's okay I don't have neither God is good to us I know the master of the wind as we stand let us turn to two passage of Scripture the first passage will be coming from Jeremiah at the 29th chapter and then will come from Proverbs the first chapter I believe that we're living in the last day living in the last days and we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for His grace and His mercy amen mm-hmm we are such bless we're so blessed tonight and and everybody needs to know you know I am this way I don't I'm so glad I'm living in this day and in this age I sometimes think about what God is doing and has done for us and I'm so glad that it's a fixed situation it's about God and me yeah but God chose me how didn't choose him and one thing I know about God promises is that they never fail it may take a time getting here but when the promise is to be made God will do any and everything to make it happen because his word will not and cannot come back boys proverbs 29 11 we're gonna read from the eleventh verse to the thirteenth but I know the thoughts that I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected in and I don't know about y'all but I'm have an expectation of a great end because my end is my beginning right right then she'll you call upon me and she shall go and pray unto me and I will Harkins with me unto you and ye shall seek me and find me and when ye shall search for me excuse me let's meet that again and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart then there's two two groups of people here so we're gonna read proverbs by the grace of God the first chapter we're start at the 25th verse there's another group of people that God will not hearken to proverbs 1 25 30 through 30 excuse me but ye shall set at nought all my counsel and would none of my reproof I also will laugh at your calamity I will mock when you'll fear cometh when you'll fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish come upon you then you shall call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they should not find me for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof let us pray father God we come before you and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us so kind so gentle so loving so caring Lord there's none like you and we exalt you tonight because you has exalted above all names in every name and you'll name every knee shall bow we love you Lord we pray father God that you continue to do the work that you started in us and we'll be careful to give you the praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I have a subject tonight and I trust it somehow the Lord will bless you we're living in the last days and it's so hard for people to fully come to understand that even those who we claim to be in the message this is a time that God has been gracious to us we think about the coronavirus of the cold at 19 and even though it has brought distress to a lot of families I can truly say that Scripture works well with me then all things work together for the good of them that love law because during this time God has given me far more spiritually than I had before this coronavirus truck I believe it is a time that though Satan did it the devil did it God took advantage of it I'm saying all of these things so that you can understand that never in the history of mankind the whole world was locked down at the same time except in the time of Egypt and when everything was locked down in in Egypt because of the plagues it was a thing that God had gone on with his people and that thing was that God was giving them that space to make sure that the blood was on the doorposts and the lintel and I believe that this is a time that God has allowed it to his bride to snap her into a awareness that he regardless to the powers of this earth he still is in charge remember Egypt thought they were the greatest of all nations and God took a simple man with a stick in his hand and conquered Egypt and I want to say that I've been to Egypt and they're still suffering from Moses but you see they want to say that Moses never existed but we know that he existed because the Bible tells us he did and even as they tried to put Moses out of their history so has the world they've tried to put Jesus out of their history I want to see this by the grace of God because I want you to understand that before there were or was a written word there was God we call him Elohim and Elohim had thoughts and before the thoughts were ever on page they were in the mind of God they were with God and and so I won't say this because God designed a way to communicate with his creation and he used that way by way of voice now you've never seen anybody's voice but you know that the voice is is something that is spiritual is unseen but yet we have instruments where we can pick it up whether be by science or whether it be by the design of God's what we call ear we we can't talk describe it but it's something about the voice is that when when first heard you never forget it for an example even in the animal kingdom when mother lamb sheep have had a lamb or a cow or I have a calf they know their mother's voice they know the boy said they don't have to go to school to learn it children know their parents voice they don't go to school it's something that God has placed on the inside of that particular child to know the difference they may not be able to discern how far the person is from them but they know mama and they know Danny dan is a revelation as I've said before from Genesis to Revelation whenever God gets ready to direct us he speaks people call him the silent God only because they don't know that God speaks and there are those who can hear his voice that's what Jesus said he said my sheep hear is my voice and a stranger they will not follow I read those two poor portions of scripture to show you where you are you're not in the proverbs 1 but God has placed you in the Jeremiah 29 because God hasn't expected in for us but what is it that God can expect a great thing for us at the end because he knows us as we sing that song he knows my name he knew your name before you knew your name he called you by your name and even though we may not fully understand what that is but just like the problem that God said that name that God gave you before the foundation of the world it's the name that you have when you get over there so even though I'll be known by character my name has always been eternal because my name is his name now you see brotherhood's where you going with this I want to say that you and I must understand that what makes us different from all of the world is because we have the ability to hear God's voice we've come in a time of what we call Pentecostal era where people used to hear God's voice more often they would say you know the Lord told me this and I heard the Lord say this and I was going this way and God told me to turn this way that way whatever they were so attuned to the voice of God but now because we have been so distracted we have been so busy till it becomes difficult to hear his voice have you ever been in a crowd and you're trying to say something and everybody is saying something and you're trying to say something maybe the Judy but Judy can't hear you because so many voices are being being heard and you have to say quiet Judy right so you got to understand that's how God will do us I believe this is the time if you could ever hear God's voice this is the time to hear it because what has he done for you and what has he done for me he has silenced all of the other voices so that his voice can be heard but there is a time that Adam and Eve did not have to compete with voices because there was only one voice and that was the voice of God but when the serpent began to speak now there became a confusion in voices right Adam never was deceived by the voice he knew that the voice would always bring him back to what the word spoke to him from the beginning you understand me so I'm saying all of these things to say by God's grace that God is trying to get us to see who we are right I was telling our brother Jesse this today I said you know we fail to see how beautiful this earth is we look at the trees and all the trees we hear birds singing oh they're just Birds but don't you understand that all of these things are operating by the God that you and I serve and we see them in the birds we see them in the trees we see them in the skies let me bring it down to you let me say it like this hell is void of birds there no birds there there singing in hell there is no blue sky in hell there is no reason in hell there is no breath in him everything that God is hell is bored of there's no beautiful water well you can drink remember when there when there is no ruler daddy went to hell and he won't just a dip a dip of of Lazarus finger there is no water there there is no fellowship because God is fellowship he understand me God created us for fellowship is that right God created Eve for fellowship for Adams showing that God in his nature loves fellowship and that fellowship was with himself somebody help me here because there was nobody equal to God he had cherubims he had seraphim's he had all of these things but there was nobody equal but in the mind of God in the bosom of God you were there dad may have been just a thought but that thought was a perfect thought understand what was just said hear the voice of the scripture God's thought concerning you was perfection he couldn't think nothing else but you see the devil thought by the way of the fall that he could change God's mind about you he could never he saw a Brotherhood's have been wicked I've done this than that than this no you didn't Satan in his illusion in his way of trickery made us do things that were not in the heart for us to do it yah him II he took advantage of us because the seed of God had not yet been quickened see because the seed of God is you it's God in you you understand me it is where you came from and where you're going it's not an illusion or something a figment of your imagination this thing is real hallelujah and God has always tried to get us to see who we are I would ask you the question who are you at some point in time you got to answer that question who are you and the answer to that question is in the scripture and the answer to the scripture is in the spirit of the scripture it's in the voice it is God who identify us by his word hallelujah this is why even in the evening time the problem of God could come and say God has justified you as though you've never sinned in the first place why because in the mind of God you never sinned that's why God placed you in Adam not the second Adam the first and not the first Adam the second Adam you said well how could I get me into places the first Adam was a natural man and in here the probably God said that all of Adam's seed was in him y'all know that's the truth right you plant one seed it comes up it may be an apple tree and out of that out of that that tree comes the fruit of the tree which are plenty of apples and then at all those apples have no apples and but it came out of that one seed so Christ had us in him before the foundation of the world not in the flesh of Jesus he you and I was in love him the life of the seed we were part of his attributes I'm trying to get you sick this is why the Corolla doesn't feel I don't see a crumb I don't feel Kobe whatever it is but give it give it whatever name right I was telling my Saints there in Iowa good question you say you the bride you say that God is your the attributes of Christ let me ask you a question which one you would be more afraid of the fiery furnace the Lions in the den or Koby but everybody was acting like Kovac was the lion in the band the fiery furnace and here were people who did not have the knowledge of God like we do and they said I stand on the word if I perish you let me perish what is it it's something that genetically coded within the state within the sea that's what Paul said I don't live but it's Christ that lives in me hallelujah and there is no fear who are you I'll tell you who I am the voice has spoken to me hallelujah so when this message comes and identifies you that is the voice of God and because you heard it it shows that you are a sheep a another goat it is the goats who don't want construct instructions it is the goats Amen who do not want a reproof it is the goats a men of this world who hates the voice of God hallelujah but the bride of Jesus Christ like jesus said my sheep here is my voice and a stranger they will not follow he's not talking about the natural men's voice he's talking about the voice in the voice hallelujah he's talking about the God who said let there be and it was so that's boys this message carries but the voice of God that spoke through the man yes hear what I'm saying so we are in the book I was telling the church I want you to see this is just a book of redemption and people won't even make it through this I have not seen ears have not heard what's in store for us this is just a portion of God when redemption is over can you imagine people say walking the streets o go that doesn't excite me hallelujah the thing that excites me is that our being in this present process eternally there will be not one ounce of confusion of who I am and what I've come to do a church denomination or organization we are the word born of God and if you're born of God you're born of his power all of his strength born whatever he is we are is that right and the Bible tells us that as he is in the world that's what we are we are as he is oh come on it's more than a mine a process of a mind it is more than that it's life because first of all you cannot process God if he could be processed he's not God hallelujah now look at this if God in his his wisdom he outsmarted the devil again the devil thought he outsmarted God in Genesis when he made man to fall he thought he outsmarted God so that's why Satan still thinks he can defeat God cuz he feel like he defeated God by way of Adam and it was a reflection of God and Adam fell so he figured if he could do smart enough he can actually make God's fall he can't see watch how he did it he always go after God subjects everybody he went after he went after Moses Jeremiah all of them and he calls all of them to fall but one day he met his match Christ himself hallelujah and he tried to get safely on Christ to sin Jesus was sin and as a man he went good why he knew his mission he knew that he was a Lamb of God he knew he had to sacrifice his life he knew that they were coming more of him saving in understand even his angels and satan had understood that this scene had to be buried in order to Roger scientists the scientists didn't know any preach the gospel okay but this time he is preaching to proverbs 1 yes I won't hear your cry and no doubt they screamed and they cried but don't you see what we are now this is hell that we're living in oh come oh it's blending into her this is why you see all the wickedness Satan is not bringing hell because he's you shoot him saying he's renovating he's making this place suitable for his coming just like Jesus had to go and shootable oh my god we were already in a tool called a Rossio yes we were dead live in labor SIA but we heard a voice you will make one the car what makes you do what you do you you say oh you can't even give up [Music] because it's not you keeping yourself it's God keeping you and he made the promise he's that begun a good work in you he's faithful he has always been that God even leads us into troubles he lets you fall he lets you fall yeah I was telling pastor today I said God is gonna make sure his purpose is fulfilled in your life somebody help me here you say how can God do that did you know that God said Tamar who inspired came out to go find Judah but God purpose had me fulfilled because he brought judgment on the sons because they would not go into Tama and the only person left was Judah and Judah and his sons had the same seed some you understand me yes it was just Judah in another covering like a different coverage y'all know what I'm saying but God used a mob to do a brain fog his purpose he couldn't see it being brought no other way that was his vision if it had there oh and just something other than what God thought in the beginning it would have made God a failure God cannot feel you know understand me your own brother what are you saying look God put on Mary they call her the love of Jesus but we know we understand that God Jesus's mother was L him and father was hello him you understand me he made the body in what you think because she was chosen God was going to have some favoritism no whatever God's then got then cut out for you is for you and some of these people I wouldn't want their battles I keep mine know something I couldn't do I couldn't honestly I couldn't do some of the things that I know some people have to do I can't I'm not made that way so God knew how to cut my my trials and my pattern he he you know mean he personalized it for you and that's what God does he personalized all your battles she could say wait a minute no you mean to tell me in my last stage of pregnancy I'm bigger than I ever gonna be right and you want me to travel them Bethlehem oh I can't imagine what that would have been like and all you know you think she was riding in the Cadillac no you understand me the uncaught she was uncomfortable carrying the Christ child and all along she's finding there's a few pains coming and I hope I get where I need to go before it finishes it but it couldn't it couldn't it could not come early and neither could have come late mom because God had already designed in heaven yes the star that was supposed to appear at the time of his birth not only that God had already designing the shepherds to be in the field God had already talked to three wise men who knows where they were before they started the journey the understand me so God had to make sure that the inn was full because it was in the scripture that they would have no room in the end God was operating all of this so let me say like this God cares nothing about your comfort that's right right huh he is your comfort he cares about the comforter who he himself is you listen even Joseph knew that that the child had to be born in Bethlehem to whether they picked it up on the way I don't know but the point is they were already scripturally spoken of and they didn't know they were the ones to fulfill the scripture the understanding that's the way it is when God when he speaks for example let's give it another jumpin and I continue horn Saul we call him Paul he had no idea he was an angel he had no idea he was a servant of the Lord that was going to bring most of the New Testament all his life he never knew who he was but one day the voice of the scripture spoke to him when he asked the question who art thou Lord he said Jesus hallelujah from that day on Saul or Paul was never the same see when God speaks to you Yahoo we don't know what I'll say like this here was Mary Ann danger comes to Mary because she's gonna have a child I'm I'm just by inspiration but I don't know but you see when that angel came to her he had to give her something just how can this thing be but she did not know it was very important for her to say be it unto me according to that worry she didn't know that there will be millions of people called the bride resting on her statement be it unto me according to your word see it distinguish up it defines her it literally separated her from e cuz all you had to do says Lucifer devil serpent I'm not gonna do what you gonna you want me to do I'm gonna do it according to his word that's all she had to say in the conversation she was that's how you be done to me of corn you were I may not even know how you're gonna do it we have not seen it yet have you have you seen anybody translated absolutely not but he promised and there's something on the inside of the bride of Jesus Christ that makes her believe Josh that is a blessing to you understand I was telling the brother today what what why should I fear anything now I've seen you know I don't even know why Israel did it mm-hmm they saw the pillar of fire by night pillar cloud by day and they still feared that's right they still feared you know why because they forget so easily people forget how God has brought you where he's brought you from and we know that only the supernatural God can bring you from somewhere and take you somewhere positive how do you is that right that's why God said to Moses what's wrong with you some of us would say shut up listen to what I'm saying you know because here you can saw me conquer Egypt you've seen the place fall you see all of these people that is a fruit of your ministry Millions and now you're standing up here scared that was the difference between him and David David meditated on the Lord day and night so when he came up to the Goliath he wasn't afraid he had already a testimony that was burning on his heart where you know what God has brought you through and you keep it on your heart nothing makes you afraid that's what David can say well though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil just the other day to do you know because different women scare relevance if you drive you know you might have you gotta go near Chicago and go through there near Detroit or well and I said uh-uh I don't fear no evil don't try to put a fear on me I don't fear no evil you understand me I'm not talking about people I'm talking about spirits I don't fear no evil what because thou art with me God understand me when God is in you you don't have to fear nothing he's a good chef like you testify he's a good shepherd and he's Lord overall oh let me hurry up Laura God you God got me see you're in the book everything in here is about you because we're going through redemption take you done been so lewd and so bad you've been a bad person God put somebody in there like judo God put somebody on you oh you said I'd come out of this church God put Ruth in there because she was the more - she was half-and-half oh but see God knows hallelujah even though Ruth was and they sacrifice children over there when she heard her husband speak about the Jehovah God she knew within herself that's who I should be worshiped she never had a time to voice it until after her husband was dead but when Naomi was like I'm leaving she says I'm going with you because I know that your God is the real God right we don't worry about denomination we don't fear them organization denominations all that kind of stuff we know the mark of the beast is coming it's already here right it's in the form of organizations denominationalism and all of that kind of stuff we know that the world comes the churches are coming together beyond the truth of the matter is why do you think that the whole situation collapsed it is and one nation will not bring this world back on his feet so what they're going to have to do God is forcing the issue they will have to unite to bring the world back into its order but it will come just like they coming with a new world order God is establishing in the world yeah he'll be king it will be [Applause] [Music] what are you saying whether you realize it or not you are under doors host when God comes when Jesus Christ comes again riding on his white horse you and I and whoever more will be there through hard time with 64 years ruling but in that day you won't have to worry because you have his name if the name of Jesus I don't know what the new name is gonna be but it's gonna be so glorious it'll keep everything in check everything in check you love the Lord Moses was in the Bible Mary was in the Bible Jesus was in about Jeremiah was in the Bible Rebecca never listened and Rebecca Rebecca Aziz wife yeah help Jacob DC because what God told her before the babies were born you got to in your womb right and Rebecca says and seek her God to use you even if sometimes it looks sinful it looks like you out of the out of place you're doing the wrong thing and the whole time is when God speaks you can never do the wrong thing when God instructs you to do something you're doing life true you're doing right you so what do you mean God is fired Rebecca when the father was coming Amen to find his idols weird to hide it oh my god huh because he could not afford to see her be killed or captured by her dad she had to go with her husband somebody help me because I don't have to worry about getting in trouble because God had already got you out I was just talking with a brother some years ago a night in 1990 something when they had that stock market crash he was led to pull out of his and pull his money out and put it somewhere else and the person who helped him put the money into him that was the most stupidest thing he ever done and then the stock market crashed and then he comes back to the bride collar dive well what made you do that what me God told you God told me to do it and because I was obedient there was no signs of the stock market crashing but because I was obedient I have this now now suitum said sometimes things don't necessarily have to make sense when the voice of the scripture speaks you have to obey do what it says now understand you got to know God and you got to know his words because whatever you tells you will come back hallelujah let me hurry up amen now let me say it like this it's not enough to know this Bible you can notice by Bible backwards and forth not about Nell adopt my dog but you got to be quick yeah it has to be quickly acts 2:38 was in the Bible 4000 years or so always been there right and it laid right there people steal baptized father son their own it had to be quickened hallelujah the gifts of God was already in the word the people don't know Susan speak didn't just all of a sudden put it in the Bible it was already there but segment God spoke to some people and told them this was a season that's what I'm trying to tell you and God speak this is the season listen to him that's when you call him God and said lord have mercy on me give me the fire because when there's a deep call there's a deep - response is that right he couldn't even deliver the children of Israel until they cried out from Egypt oh my think about it listen with the proper God says in Hebrews chapter hoping it's okay he's up the scriptures no matter how well you know them if the Spirit doesn't quicken them then the letter killeth the Spirit gives life seat it must be quickened or made alive by the spirit if the Spirit doesn't doesn't live in the word and make it a reality to you then the letter is just an intellectual C doesn't I'm saying you've got so many message people they can quote brother branham they can quote this Bible and nothing's wrong with that but when you don't have a revelation when you don't understand what he's saying or what the Bible is saying you just got an intellectual understanding because a true revelation will bring the stimulation and the stimulation will bring about a translation it transforms you it changes you it's not just its spirit yeah and once you connect with the spirit that word changes you for an example people don't think they've got to go through the statue of a perfect man to make a rapture I look at people as are you serious do you think God put it there just for your intellectual understanding no he's trying to tell you that the message of the hour would take you from all the way up if it's a real birth has been ordained to mature be it unto me we didn't ask any pregnant woman for nine months no it's not easy hallelujah sometimes the food you take down you bring back up hallelujah but at the same time you still growing something's happening to you hallelujah because God is in control oh I'm so happy to be in this message I'll tell you why somebody was calling and they call me from South Africa I ask well what's happening to America I said well the Scriptures being fulfilled [Laughter] that's what's happening we're in the midst of this is that right prophecy is not being made and at the same time I want you to understand there was chaos in Bethlehem Rome was out of control and everything about about money and taxes and they wanted to know all your information which they just got this challenges recently right they want to know all your information where you are whatever they whether kids would be hallelujah and while the churches were going on the church on Hollywood harlot hallelujah Boulevard didn't even know that the star had appeared you see them second it wasn't by their name oh please it was about those seeds those germs that God had placed in position to make his purpose come to pass that even he had evil in this position right the fellow said hey I'm kidding all the children but what was that all about cuz Mary and Joseph would have stayed there but God needed Jesus in Egypt so here let me tell you something what's happening now in America and all the world is all about you trying to get you and me to prepare to make sure there's no Reeko listen and easily remove how do you remove your spots by the blood is that Alright yeah being confident like says in Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing I'm confident hallelujah you've got to be confident let me ask you a question have you heard the voice did you go out to meet him that question is have your light going out if your light is going out then you need some extra oil right right you don't need you like to go out now and when you like go out that means you don't know direction the direction you should travel but see they heard the voice they did not cry they had the lamp which was delight and they knew the direction the light came the boys came from so they were able to find the door oh come on somebody and win that winning foolish the girl was still there but the door was shut so we're living in a time now that you gotta be careful you gotta know that the door is Jesus Christ has always been Jesus comes Lot's wife no you gotta pull me out of here you love the Lord can you can I get a little bit more let's go to Luke first chapter the voice of the scripture he said well brother what do you say the voice of the scripture because before there was anything written Alan he'd never had a book to know what God wanted they had a voice and the voice visited them in the cool of the evening when the divorce come back in the cool of the Union somehow to help me here so you say what do you say Steve everything that Adam lost the second Adam came to give it back to us he lost the title deed the second Adam came to give us the title team and what was the title deed but God himself he was property right and when the shoes were open when you said God comes back and he gives back to the people and places them in the Garden of Eden before the fall now you got to hear the voice the voice says you are in the Garden of Eden not lettuce Here I am there to see anymore I mean cause Eden Yagami can cause Eden I have the power and the ability to rebuke every devil that right teases within this world but not of the world you is the world but not of the world and because you are another world with the title deed which is a Holy Ghost you can bind sickness creation waits to hear from you is that right the bomb says the whole creation groans see that's why we have earthquakes in diverse places we got floods why because the serpent and creation don't listen to the serpent creation has been designed to listen only to the sons and daughters of God [Laughter] there's not one person call me I've had three people they call me it not me it ain't me is Christ in me is the Lord Jesus they had the corona they had the corona I prayed and God delivered my brother thought he was gonna die they had to put him on a ventilator and everything I talked to him he sounded when he talked to me he was drowning and I rebuked that one of my deacons and I was sitting don't get me wrong I wasn't there when they got it I was on the phone and they worked at that plant down there whatever all right so I don't know each other scared you I would I would never have come like that if I thought somewhere and I knew something was going on I wouldn't you know it but my point is he couldn't call me he was dying he said brother Brooks he said I was dying he said I couldn't breathe I had no strength I wanted to call you and I couldn't call and then the phone rang and it was me that's his testimony God move on my heart to call him we prayed for him he was well we went to the hospital negative but all that cost a lot but he had it for a long time and he was trying to deny that was it was that he gave me this a present I said that's Corona you've been gonna work like that yeah but not around nobody's been affected because I've been but he realized who he got it from assist a lady came to work like that anyway we would pray and we pray for him and all not only that a brother told me get some garlic get some garlic and onions and some other stuff I said brother just take that and we pray for him I just he just I takes him how you doing brother he said I'm 10 times better than I ever been [Laughter] [Applause] I can used to speaking the word God can use ribbon remedies but whatever and who I am he doesn't is still God hallelujah people give me like I'm crazy I said you know what I only wear this mask when they require in a store you're not gonna put no fear on me and not only that I know it's more than it's your immune system builds up when you have to face Devils term you need germs being too clean ain't too good if we can join the system this is all about that's what the cold the cold in the flu is a virus but it's a cleansing process and we need that every now and again take the toxins and all that out of it but none of us like it but God is working on your favor i'ma tell you God is my witness before this thing struck God will be up and he said I gave this big to repent and they would not the next thing I know they were saying people were getting sick and when I heard about the coronavirus God said this is only the first phase now I didn't know not no phases and then all of a sudden they started saying saying it right and you saw what brother's wife's name I don't know but he told me that this wasn't the only one the only thing coming our way maybe it was this rioting thing I don't know all I know is is not gonna get it better those things are coming and what you're going to do about it shaking your shoes Oh No the Bible said that that God has a fire about me a wall of fire not just about me but that same fire is on the inside and that's the way I see it I'm not on earth I'm in heaven Jesus explained to me how can the Sun man be here on earth and in heaven at the same time ya know anything about relativity that's what he was speaking up scientists taught me that you could be in two places at one time dimension that the world can't see that's I'm living in that dimension right because of that dimension I can hear his voice I understand me it is a dimensional thing that you should be able to hear and see God's voice because in Christ Jesus that is discernment because he is a discerner even the Tama reward to praise God so you look at those things and you say oh brother books are you up maybe maybe I am but I'm enjoying it because it's giving me such a freedom I'm not worried you know we had we had to distance ourselves because if they caught us with more than ten people they were gonna charge us $500 per head and nobody wanted to pay the 500 Sommerfeld we went over a few days free time maybe 13 14 but you should have seen two people either God is in control of God is not don't tell me that you trust God and you don't even believe he's in control how can you trust somebody who ain't in control hmm see your head is not your tempo I'm so glad today cuz I ain't that smart it's in your heart that's where the temple of God is is in your heart and your soul and the Bible says this is what gets me it has always let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God right why would you fear being evil with God if the voice of the scripture has spoken that to you right the voice of the Scriptures spoke to disciple assist if you say to this mountain be that move that's the voice that's the same voice according to John one that created everything the same Lord is speaking to his disciples and saying listen whether so ever you say if you could touch it agree two of you touch and agree and it shall be given you know what we say well the devil said we you ain't even been living right or you you're not there yet hallelujah let me ask you a question whether it be a baby or a grown man and you're the father and that baby comes up and said daddy can I have some milk well you say well you can't have no milk you ain't wrong yet it makes no sense you understand yes because whatever that was you are that's what you will ask for as you mature your level of expectation your level of need you'll never never love what grows with you right but when you're done you know you myself I got this you know I haven't had a real shout in a long time the show is okay shouting but after a while you have but your knees is still your knees and your knees have become gods needs is that right he said I have need to go by Samaria why because the Sumerian woman had a need for Christ and whenever you haven't he has a need to give it to you oh my god if what money the mind the word the money of the word let it be in you that's the voice can you hear the voice tonight give his head a voice I'm not talking about me I'm gonna talk about this face I'm coming what what's what's repeating and and screaming out the words you use that's life that's God unique coming out for you one of the things they would always ask these Superstars or whatever they call heroes who are you stuck with me because I thought well who are you I am supposed to be so different that people need to ask the question who are you the supernatural supposed to be on display so much so that people would ask who are you is that right yes John who are you are you the Messiah who are you right they asked Jesus because all of the supernatural things he was in who are you who gives you your authority hallelujah she dusted that's the kind of life that God wants us to not sitting here waiting for God to do something he's already done it the guard Club is already here go the other one is already here but he's got somebody that's not just gonna believe it that's gonna receive him I believe often he'll die later the devil believes in the nose it you gotta be seen it what like he can hear talk my kicking heel is that all right the Bible says according to proverbs 23 and 7 so far as he thinking for as he thinking it as hard so is he that's what I'm saying if you think you're a failure you'll be a big hallelujah but if you know that you're supernaturally charged son and daughter of God I look quick because I know we got some other nice but my point is people you're blessed I think if the Lord tarry I mean I may try to finish this message that got something in this one that I really just a blessing to me because you and I need to know the voice hear the voice you know why I'm saying this is this Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they did not have a Bible but they had the voice but the wings that even when they prayed all night The Voice didn't show up God didn't tell him nothing but you see they knew the voice and the voices of them and they said no matter what if God doesn't deliver me I will not bow to you y'all better hear me we don't know what the squeeze is gonna bring on us we don't know but if you don't know the voice because you won't have a Bible to read you won't have a take to listen to is that Ronnie you're not gonna have that but if you have not exercised your spiritual ears to hearing his voice mama knows about it mama has that six that's that extra sense she can tell she could be laying in the bed and she have that feeling let me go check on the baby y'all know what I'm saying and just as soon as you go check yes something's going on in the baby can speak for itself you know something about parenting that once you know children something happens you know you know something's wrong I could feel it there are times I have to call my children what's going on what's up right because something inside it is really deep it's really because sometimes I can tell when they're doing things wrong to his TV is deeper than I can explain it right therefore I'm closing with the scripture 2nd Timothy 2 beginning at the 3rd and 70s through the seventh verse thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that was entangled himself with affairs of this life that's what I was trying to tell people with all these marches and all this crazy let me say like this like I told her brother in in Africa I said you know what I'm like Noah you know I know Noah types out the Fuli but I'm saying I'm in the ark I'm in Christ nor I'm sealed away and what was happening out there in those day that was the world you understand me that's Genesis 6 violence cover the face of the word you know everywhere imaginations of me everything why should I get involved this is not my room jesus said it gives us my world as my kingdom of my people will fight for now you talk about heaven we we bout ready to go at it right but you would come up this world you say doesn't hurt yes it hurt but how many people out here have rejected the gospel have blaspheme the holy spirit cursed God and His Church well we're taught my judgment here you gonna get in the midst of God's judgment and that right oh I remember many times you know mama whippin brother you tryin to get anyway guess what happens you get a leak or two and you jump jump out the window you're on your own you know is what we do sometimes when we bring businesses to church the pastor stopped preaching hard and we put our protective shield over it on her Lord you don't see it but you know it's going on windy when she came with brother Simon oh my I didn't see windy so I was preaching a church message I mean I was rebuking left and right I mean the soil was Cutta Cutta going in for eight and you know I was talking about the worldly thing this is bad this and that never saw her sitting there I know she was so sharp that's what I knew something she has something yeah the devil might fight your sister but there is some because there ain't no way a worldly girl would have come back under those conditions we she stood up like Oh Holy Spirit so when it comes to the to see to God they don't care how hard it comes they might get mad at you but at the end of the day they gonna say amen amen all right no man that wasn't to him she's been a testimony because I testify like now I have no idea what that did for me that day right no man that was entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier we don't we don't entangle ourselves with politics and all of the stuff that's going on that's not our fair our fair is the kingdom of God and as righteousness amen and if a man also strived for mastery yet it he not crowned except he strives or lawfully the husbandmen that labor earth must be first partakers of the fruit and this is what I've been telling my church I said I'm crying out for something I want more of it you know I don't have a slice or two of the pie I want more of it or the watermelon I want more of it why because these things must begin with me first customers must first be partakers of the food people must see Christ in me which they see it don't get me wrong but I mean a grain of Christ if that makes sense a greater Christ you love the Lord hallelujah I I so long in closing that's why we needed a prophet because proverbs 29:18 says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he so you got to understand that's the way God did it and he preached a message there's a man who could turn on the light yeah right and that's what the message came to do was to reveal to us the very thought of God for us in an hour day that's the turning on the light that is what quickens you to know who you are because the the serpent cannot receive this message now you mean yeah they don't have nothing to do with it but a true believer though they may be weakest water like Ruben they still part of the family you love the Lord see if I could if I could sin in a nutshell on everything that I wanted you to see to give you grace and conference it would be he became my sin that I might become the righteousness it ain't your laws and ain't your rules an angel dialogues it ain't none of that there are many people like the rich young ruler head doc got to cross the t's and dot the i's and put a period at the end however he did all right but was lost right he was a man who's a tax collector he approached God back grace hey God said hey I'm coming to your house Zacchaeus see I'd rather be like Zacchaeus than the rich young ruler say well okay all right you know I got my religion mmm I ain't never done this I ain't never done that I ain't never done this that or the other and I'm all right boom you must be born again and I say that you know a lot of kids come up in the message want you to understand it may be difficult for you to see yourself as a wretch but you are rich you are you were born a wretch give time give you more time that might become manifested but you don't know time to catch up the Bible said the day that you hear my voice harden not your heart and I want to encourage all the young people those of you who are pressing into the Holy Ghost don't give up don't get slack you know what I'm saying this is not an hour to lay low this is a time to raise up and say God you said and I've been baptized in your name and you promised me and I'm holding to your promise that's how you approach God as God I know I can't my righteousness is like filthy rags how am I gonna make heaven if you don't give me the Holy Ghost and how am I going to live right if you don't give me the Holy Ghost I can't transform myself but I'm told by your spirit your spirit your Holy Ghost is to transform way you have to approach God with his word that's right and you go with bonus the Bible says you don't go where Lord if you want to no not if you want to cuz you told me according to your property you said God want to give me the Holy Ghost more than I wanted now I want you to give me your inspiration Lord give me the give you you want to give it give it to me so I can want to have it just like you want to give it to me and I'll make you said yeah that's what you do that's what you do you love the Lord I hope this has been a blessing to you yes sir yes I appreciate your pool you know I could feel it hey you know it I love screams and hollers and all but I can feel the pool because sometimes you can get the screams in Holland you just got religion going on but when you get a person who people that somehow they know how to do it they just ain't opening up their mouth right is that right it's coming like a baby nursing they know how to appreciate the Lord Amazing Grace how to love me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so many years and just gave his heart back to the Lord about two years ago the best
