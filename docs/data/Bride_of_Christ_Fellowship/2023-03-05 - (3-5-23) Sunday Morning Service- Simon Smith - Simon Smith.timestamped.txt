[0:01] Christ even at the cross
[0:04] he had to go to the Cross to save that
[0:06] very last one that was ordained for that
[0:10] Resurrection
[0:12] we would take just place just what days
[0:15] afterwards but he had to get that one on
[0:17] the cross
[0:19] and if the Lord Jesus Christ ordained
[0:21] all those things and he saw all those
[0:24] things and what he would have to go
[0:27] through and and that last final one I
[0:30] kept thinking about that last final one
[0:31] I mean his heart was not satisfied until
[0:33] that thief on the right was crying out
[0:36] for salvation and asked him to be there
[0:37] on that day so we see the Lord is
[0:40] Mindful and he will go the distance he
[0:43] will go to the farthest reaches of the
[0:45] earth and the world the greatest pain to
[0:48] save that last one
[0:51] and now he has
[0:53] he's not here in a Corporal body but
[0:55] he's here in our body
[0:57] a lot of us well why did I have to go
[0:59] through this in my life and and there's
[1:01] things we're going to be going through
[1:03] here shortly that's going to display
[1:06] some of those same same things you know
[1:08] I mean our brothers and sisters for the
[1:10] last two thousand years around the world
[1:11] have suffered tremendously
[1:14] so we expect
[1:16] we wonder what's coming our way so okay
[1:20] let's just have a reading of the word
[1:21] here we'll get into this by God's grace
[1:23] and to a study here
[1:28] this is just was kind of
[1:31] was that for the home there for the
[1:32] campus preaching my pastor there and
[1:35] then just these thoughts just came
[1:37] started coming to my mind and
[1:40] uh
[1:44] we're gonna see how that goes and
[1:48] let me see here my little guy is that
[1:59] sorry
[2:05] okay so here we go we're gonna dive into
[2:07] this by God's grace
[2:11] always be it trust us be a blessing
[2:16] Genesis 45 let's read that verse 1.
[2:25] so this is one of the few times I
[2:26] actually had something fresh here that I
[2:28] did not teach at home and
[2:30] so I might meet Emma sister Emmy happy
[2:32] that maybe she didn't hear this one yet
[2:34] or
[2:35] maybe something uh newer so
[2:40] that's this 45 verse 1. let's read that
[2:44] Joseph could not re refrain himself
[2:47] before all them and stood by them and he
[2:50] cried because every cause every man to
[2:53] go out from me and there stood no man
[2:56] with him
[2:57] while Joseph made himself known unto his
[3:00] brethren
[3:02] and he wept aloud and the Egyptians and
[3:05] the house of pharaoh heard
[3:08] wow he was
[3:10] that the burden the releasing of all
[3:13] that pain
[3:14] and and like you're missing a family
[3:17] member and uh like someone who passed on
[3:20] you know and you long to see them again
[3:22] and hear now uh in all of the Joseph's
[3:25] Mighty never thought he would maybe see
[3:27] his brothers again ever and his dad and
[3:31] then finding out his dad's still alive
[3:32] and all the hope and all the excitement
[3:34] and all the joy for a restoration if you
[3:38] will and notice how he cried out
[3:42] verse 3 and Joseph said unto his
[3:44] Brethren he says
[3:45] I am Joseph but they only knew him
[3:48] they'd only met him through what
[3:50] Zephaniah
[3:52] he was given what a new name and they
[3:55] didn't know him by that new name they
[3:57] didn't know him as what savior of the
[3:59] whole world which is means saving the
[4:02] whole world or however
[4:04] he says I am Joseph
[4:07] doth my father yet live and his Brethren
[4:10] could not answer him for they were
[4:12] troubled at his presence
[4:14] and Joseph said unto his brother and
[4:15] come near to me I pray you
[4:18] and they came near and said I am Joseph
[4:20] your brother whom ye sold into Egypt
[4:22] imagine the fear and
[4:25] regret and just the automatic reverence
[4:30] silence I just petrifying fear I'll say
[4:34] like that
[4:37] nevertheless now therefore be not
[4:39] grieved nor angry with yourselves that
[4:42] you sold me hither for God did send me
[4:45] before you to preserve life
[4:50] North verse 6.
[4:52] for these two years half the famine been
[4:55] in the land and yet there are five years
[4:59] in the which there shall neither be
[5:01] earring nor Harvest so let's say a word
[5:04] of Prayer
[5:08] the father Lord Jesus Lord we love you
[5:10] Lord we thank you for the state
[5:12] and though we thank you for this time
[5:14] we've gathered together Lord and Lord

[5:18] even right now Lord we ask Lord you
[5:20] would be with Pastor Jesse Lord
[5:23] and oh God you know
[5:25] everything about this situation Lord
[5:28] Jesus

[5:31] manifest among the people there Lord
[5:34] and Lord God may it be so refreshing
[5:37] Lord to hear the true word of God
[5:41] and Lord for certain you know this
[5:42] invitation came for no for a reason of
[5:45] no reason of not Lord but Lord there
[5:47] must be a hungering in someone's heart
[5:49] Lord there must be a sheep there Lord
[5:51] crying come help come help and Lord God

[6:12] be with them Lord
[6:13] I know we certainly love and appreciate
[6:15] you Lord bless the service as well
[6:19] you may have receipts
[6:31] Well when things certainly we know is
[6:33] the
[6:35] uh your pastor is very equipped to
[6:37] introduce someone to the message of the
[6:39] hour to bring forth the word
[6:43] I'll say like this a old friend of mine
[6:47] called me and he of course
[6:49] needs me to do some Plumbing so I went
[6:51] over to his compound as if I would call
[6:53] it because that's kind of what it is and
[6:55] I started roughing in two bathrooms for
[6:57] I mean I'm working down there
[6:59] and it's a two-level school he's
[7:00] splitting the top half to live in
[7:02] and
[7:04] I'm working down in the basement of
[7:05] course I had to cut the concrete Hammer
[7:07] gunned it out tie into a sanitary and
[7:09] run it up and just started running lines
[7:11] Branch off hit the water lines I got the
[7:13] entire Place running uh
[7:15] and as I'm working it used to be an old
[7:18] church school and sisters are God bless
[7:21] you
[7:22] oh yeah
[7:24] I talk about restoration
[7:27] and so
[7:29] I'm working down there and I'm they
[7:31] placed all my pipe and fittings in the
[7:33] hallway there
[7:34] and as I'm walking to the hallway and
[7:36] look and they have this picture
[7:39] sorry I have a little bit of so I'm
[7:42] walking and there's a picture laying on
[7:44] the floor leaning against the wall and
[7:46] it's a picture of someone had drawn it
[7:48] was a painting all the painting of all
[7:50] these fruits and it's in like an old
[7:52] basket there's fruits of grapes and
[7:54] oranges and apples and this and this and
[7:57] I kept thinking oh man that's a that's a
[7:59] fruit drawing you know of all this fruit
[8:01] I guess uh guess who the artist was
[8:04] J.R Smith
[8:07] and I kept wondering I was like J.R Jay
[8:10] Jesse Ray Smith
[8:12] and I said well certainly he has the
[8:13] fruits of the spirit so God sent a man
[8:17] there to Amish country with the fruit of
[8:19] the spirit and I was actually going to
[8:20] ask them to give that so I give the
[8:21] brother Jesse because he definitely
[8:24] Bears I know I'll be honest uh brother
[8:26] Jesse had me teach their the Sunday
[8:28] School Lord there for the children uh a
[8:31] while back and then he told me he had
[8:33] taught a little bit on something a
[8:34] certain topic I said send it to me
[8:36] brother the link and he sent me to me
[8:37] and here he is sitting here and he was
[8:39] going through certain topics and at the
[8:41] end he'd say two collapse and
[8:43] and I was like wow that's very good we
[8:47] could see he had he was built for
[8:50] children for teaching and and the Bible
[8:52] says a pastor must be apt to teach and
[8:55] uh
[8:56] certainly we saw I was just I didn't get
[8:59] a chance to respond to that to the video
[9:00] but I watched it I was like wow it was
[9:02] fantastic and young sisters are super uh
[9:06] spiritually industrial Powerhouse mental
[9:10] thinking deep thinkers uh I mean I heard
[9:12] some of the questions
[9:14] that's why that's why brother Jesse
[9:16] taught on that one so it was a really
[9:19] really encouraging to see them interact
[9:21] with their pastor and just ask some deep
[9:23] questions on uh
[9:25] I believe that was on
[9:27] the vows or the Nazareth vows and I'm
[9:30] like wow my goodness
[9:33] wow anyhow it was impressive I said
[9:35] thank the Lord for those things you know
[9:37] and how the I mean children of this age
[9:40] are asking questions and have the
[9:42] understanding to ask a question you must
[9:44] be able to think about it and understand
[9:46] it and be able to focus enough to bring
[9:48] those thoughts forward and then wow it
[9:50] was just I'm not trying I mean it just
[9:52] it was just a blessing to see so
[9:54] anyhow Let's uh let's see here let's get
[9:56] into this here by God's grace so
[10:02] I was thinking uh
[10:05] you know we uh I was down for a little
[10:08] little break a little vacation down in
[10:10] Texas to see brother Randy and sister
[10:11] Lindsay and a really good time they
[10:14] just being around them I just
[10:16] there's no stress you know there's some
[10:18] people you talk with and some people you
[10:20] interact with and you see virtue you
[10:22] know you just lose virtue because it
[10:24] takes so much strength or you know to be
[10:26] around or to fellowship or it takes
[10:28] sometimes just take and then for some
[10:30] reason you know brother Randy just
[10:32] just like hanging out with my brothers
[10:34] you know it's just there's no virtue
[10:35] left or or taking or it's just equal
[10:38] there's nothing there's no energy being
[10:39] you're just relaxing together and
[10:41] enjoying each other just there's no
[10:43] stress there's no effort or energy put
[10:46] forth so and then he shared that uh
[10:51] and I share these I share this because
[10:52] we're very close to the end here now
[10:55] uh just recently wasn't January or
[10:57] February or however it was it was
[11:00] announced that the the big economic
[11:03] forums the the leaders of the day have
[11:06] now went through their practice run on a
[11:09] global collapse
[11:11] uh so I don't know if you remember back
[11:14] in 2019
[11:17] uh they had a forum or a meeting and a
[11:20] test run or a war games on a uh on a
[11:23] global plan or pandemic pandemic if you
[11:26] want to say it also we'll just say it's
[11:27] pandemic okay
[11:29] so they had that test run and it wasn't
[11:31] just a couple of months
[11:33] and boom here we are March 2020 and uh
[11:37] it started and here they had test run it
[11:40] before and they announced it and here
[11:43] here it is so now
[11:44] they have just did their war games with
[11:46] the economic World collapse
[11:50] how many months do we have left a year
[11:53] a year and a half this thing is coming
[11:54] fast and I want to
[11:58] as that thing was relayed to me and I
[12:01] looked at the article and I was like oh
[12:02] my goodness we're very very close this
[12:04] thing is coming
[12:07] you young eyes
[12:09] you're going to see a lot here
[12:11] but remember Jesus Christ is the same
[12:13] yesterday today and forever and if there
[12:16] the Bible says ye must become like a
[12:18] child and which is which is what you
[12:21] just believe all things you have faith
[12:23] in your mama you have faith in your
[12:24] daddy and the children will have so much
[12:27] faith in God almost maybe more powerful
[12:29] Faith just an absolute ability to
[12:31] believe the word of God and receive from
[12:33] him so
[12:36] us adults might need them as well we'll
[12:38] see
[12:40] but I believe God is going to bring his
[12:42] Rapture and Grace his rapturing faith
[12:44] into the Believers and just fully I say
[12:47] let's press it out and it'll be made
[12:49] manifest so
[12:52] I want to teach on this topic here
[12:56] what will we
[12:58] see first
[13:00] so I want I want to to elaborate on this
[13:03] I want to maybe do a little study it'll
[13:05] be just a real simple study
[13:09] remember
[13:11] as the disciples saw Christ leave into
[13:15] the clouds and Ascend and leave their
[13:18] Bible said there was two men standing
[13:20] and I said why are you guys gazing up
[13:21] into the sky he says that which you just
[13:23] saw will come the exact same way as he
[13:26] left so uh the second coming will be
[13:29] just like or something like the first
[13:32] coming so
[13:35] and a couple of years ago in the midst
[13:38] of uh people leaving the message I did a
[13:40] little study and I think Jesse said he
[13:42] did the same kind of study but I went
[13:43] through and I I found all as far as I
[13:47] could found as many uh interpretations
[13:51] speaking in tongues interpretations
[13:53] through the prophet's message and I want
[13:55] you I want to play I want you to see
[13:57] this one again okay because I pulled
[13:58] this up because it reminds me of what's
[14:00] taking place okay this is not something
[14:02] uh that was uh just because it's just
[14:05] going to happen out of nowhere this was
[14:08] planned
[14:10] altogether now notice this is 1959
[14:14] he says now listen friends if there's
[14:15] anyone here Among Us that if anywhere
[14:19] down along his life's journey that a
[14:21] little bitterness has come into your
[14:23] heart hear me get out of there now right
[14:26] he says get that don't let nothing now
[14:29] notice as he's saying about getting the
[14:31] bitterness out of your heart and letting
[14:33] just live love one another
[14:36] notice a sister just kicks up speaks in
[14:38] another tongue he's and then the brother
[14:40] gives the message so you can actually
[14:42] listen to this and now here's the
[14:44] interpretation I had to listen to it and
[14:45] then type it out and it took me these
[14:47] things take me a while because I'm slow
[14:48] typer
[14:50] about 10 words a minute he says yay now
[14:53] notice this is the interpretation he
[14:54] says yay my people I speak unto thee as
[14:58] my Prophet has stood in the midst of
[15:00] thee and declared my holy word he says I
[15:03] speak unto thee by my spirit saith the
[15:06] almighty God he says you've heard my
[15:08] prophet he says but now it's time for me
[15:10] to speak right this is the holy spirit
[15:12] speaking now using the gifts within the
[15:15] local assembly the local church and now
[15:18] he's conveying a message and what is
[15:20] he's trying to convey here he says I
[15:22] have spoken days gone by concerning
[15:25] these things even this very hour there
[15:28] are great plans being made yes that
[15:32] shall bring the hour of Destruction upon

[15:43] Ghost was in the very rooms where these
[15:45] great men are planning the very
[15:46] destruction of America the taking over
[15:49] the entire world and the Holy Ghost here

[21:08] now as we are entering into these things
[21:12] what will we see first
[21:14] what will we see first
[21:18] now notice here
[21:20] in II Thessalonians 2 and 9 he says
[21:24] let's start verse 8 and then shall that
[21:26] Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[21:28] consume with the spirit of his mouth and
[21:29] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[21:31] coming now notice this is when the
[21:32] Antichrist is revealed there is uh
[21:35] brother Kim we were talking the other
[21:36] night
[21:37] and he said he said they're trying to
[21:38] push this Pope in right now they're
[21:40] trying to push him out and bring in
[21:42] another one
[21:44] so
[21:45] this might be the one I mean all even
[21:47] the even the Catholic prophecies uh are
[21:50] saying this there's going to be a bad
[21:52] Pope there's going to be another one
[21:53] rise up there's going to be one that is
[21:55] bad and of course we know this so we
[21:57] know exactly who this is uh but he said
[21:59] the bride won't see him necessarily in
[22:01] that mode now
[22:03] and he shall come with what even him
[22:05] whose work coming is after the working
[22:06] of Satan with all power signs and lying
[22:09] wonders and with all deceivableness and
[22:11] unrighteousness and then the perish
[22:12] because they received what not the love
[22:15] of the truth see saying to God that's
[22:17] why we are to love the truth what is the
[22:20] truth well the prophet said this and the
[22:21] prophet said this but what is the truth
[22:23] he said over here a different way he
[22:25] said that he would hear a totally
[22:26] different way this one he said different
[22:27] he said it Opposite over here but what
[22:29] is the truth that's why we need what the
[22:31] Holy Ghost to take all these quotes even
[22:34] even the scripture well it says right
[22:35] here uh this and it says right here this
[22:37] but we need to what rightly divide the
[22:40] word of God Amen
[22:42] now notice but
[22:43] we want truth we want to know exactly
[22:47] the precise path with all Clarity with
[22:51] everything that's just so it's just so
[22:53] clear as a glass I'll say like that so
[22:55] we know exactly what the word of God is
[22:57] saying to us in each day and each minute
[23:00] an hour now
[23:02] and for this cause God shall send them
[23:04] strong delusion that they should believe
[23:08] a lie
[23:10] because they did not care to find out
[23:13] what the truth is
[23:15] once you reject truth
[23:18] you go into darkness right once you
[23:21] reject the light there's nothing but
[23:22] Blackness right now
[23:28] as we go into this what shall we see
[23:30] first now remember there's only two
[23:32] Spirits working
[23:34] there is the Holy Ghost
[23:36] God himself Spirit form and there's the
[23:39] Antichrist which is the Devil Himself
[23:42] everything
[23:43] will be between those two right there
[23:47] and the prophet God I have I saw a quote
[23:49] the other day he said he said when this
[23:51] thing comes he says everybody's in the
[23:53] Middle Ground most most people in the
[23:54] world right now are in the middle ground
[23:56] he says but when this law is passed he
[23:59] says when this thing starts forming up
[24:01] he says there will be no middle ground
[24:03] left he says what he said he said
[24:06] everyone is going to have to make a
[24:07] decision and take a stand here or take a
[24:09] stand here they're going to have to
[24:11] choose right then
[24:13] now notice
[24:17] now look at the power I want you to look
[24:18] at the power of unity of coming together
[24:21] you know in Psalms 133 verse 1 through
[24:25] whatever 3-4 the Bible said how sweet is
[24:28] it for Brethren to dwell in unity right
[24:31] you know when when this brother needs
[24:33] this and brother Malachi says brother
[24:35] amen can you give us the advice some
[24:36] work advice on this or this or that and
[24:38] how I did this and you know brother man
[24:40] okay I could call Uncle cam say okay how
[24:41] do you TIG weld so good and this and
[24:43] this or brother Dustin how do you lay
[24:44] out these pipe Fighters and this and
[24:45] that and whatever or brother uh brother
[24:48] uh uh Vang how do you how do you do the
[24:50] CNN machine and this and this what he
[24:52] now he can pull from older brothers
[24:53] other older men and then they'll give
[24:56] them his knowledge and whatever and and
[24:58] vice versa with the sisters and brother
[25:00] sister I'm just feeling so much lower
[25:01] today can you pray for me the sister
[25:03] will pray and God will answer and bring
[25:04] to deliverance and what God loved those
[25:06] things when we take care of one another
[25:08] we look out for one another what the
[25:09] Bible says what he dwelleth he said he's
[25:12] pleased for those who dwell on these
[25:13] it's like what the anointing oil that
[25:16] came over what Aaron's beard right it's
[25:18] like the holy ghost coming on God is so
[25:20] pleased with that that well he'll bring
[25:22] the Holy Spirit down on them kind of
[25:23] people now
[25:25] and that's the unity of his people
[25:28] but now look at the unity of the faults
[25:30] here in Genesis 11.
[25:34] you know me and my wife were talking
[25:36] about this about a month ago
[25:38] notice here in Genesis 11. and the whole
[25:40] earth was of one language
[25:42] and one's speech
[25:44] they were so Unified
[25:47] freshly after Noah's Ark they what
[25:50] gathered together and now they're what
[25:52] they have a plan
[25:54] I heard one brother said he says they're
[25:56] doing this he says to take Vengeance on
[25:57] God for destroying uh their fathers in
[26:01] the pre-flood era right now Notice
[26:03] season and it came to pass as they
[26:04] journeyed from the East now notice they
[26:06] left the East and everything was
[26:09] supposed to be good in the East if you
[26:10] do the study on the East Gate he says
[26:12] that they found a plane in the land of
[26:14] shinar and they dwelled there and they
[26:16] said one to another go-to let us make
[26:18] brick and burn them thoroughly that they
[26:20] may uh and they shall and they had brick
[26:23] for stone and slime from mortar and they
[26:25] said go go to let us build us a city in
[26:28] a tower whose top May reach unto Heaven
[26:30] what were they going to do when they
[26:31] reach up to heaven they're going to try
[26:32] and take over
[26:35] but their whole goal was to build this
[26:37] thing and reach up into heaven now
[26:39] notice he says and let us make a name
[26:42] this is full denomination right here
[26:43] this is full what serpent seed he says
[26:46] lest we be scattered upon abroad on the
[26:48] face of the whole earth and the Lord
[26:50] came down to see the city and the tower
[26:52] which the men build and now notice the
[26:55] Lord knows all things he came down
[26:56] checked it out and he's like okay well
[26:57] they're really up to something sure he
[26:59] says and the Lord said behold the people
[27:01] is
[27:02] one
[27:04] and they will have and they have all one
[27:08] language and this they begin to do and
[27:11] now nothing will be restrained from them
[27:14] see the power of unity because that
[27:17] Unity brings a faith it builds something
[27:19] I'll say listen if we're all uh uh I'll
[27:22] say this
[27:23] not Cleveland Browns fans because we
[27:25] always lose but if we're like uh let's
[27:28] say another team that wins a lot and we
[27:31] all had our gear on and sisters would
[27:33] get their numbers and have their jerseys
[27:36] on and brothers would have to paint
[27:37] their chests and this and that and and
[27:38] we can all gather and we'll have we're
[27:40] going to a church football game and
[27:41] we're you know we'd all have we'd all be
[27:44] rallied together we'd be like yeah yeah
[27:46] yeah
[27:48] we're gonna go watch our team win right
[27:51] and just the faith of it we're believing
[27:53] but what God God honors what faith
[27:56] that's why people are getting healed at
[27:57] Beatles concerts people are going to
[27:59] heal by what Elvis concerts those things
[28:01] one because they had faith in what they
[28:03] were doing and through that Faith they
[28:05] were receiving what they needed at that
[28:07] time but now here's a people who's
[28:09] imagined something that are going to
[28:10] build something and that's so much faith
[28:13] and belief that they could do it God
[28:15] said they would actually be able to do
[28:17] it
[28:21] what did God do you think God the Lord
[28:23] Jesus Christ was scared
[28:25] he says go to
[28:27] let us go down he says and there
[28:30] confound their language that they may
[28:32] not understand one another's language
[28:34] did he say hey guys let's Angels let's
[28:37] write all these language books we're
[28:39] going to drop all these there's going to
[28:40] be a Chinese there's going to be Lao
[28:42] language there's going to be a English
[28:44] language there's going to be a a a
[28:45] Spanish language there's going to be a
[28:47] and then the Russian language and
[28:49] they're gonna drop all these books off
[28:50] and these people are going to have to
[28:52] learn their languages and this and that
[28:55] and then they'll be they'll forget
[28:56] everything they knew no
[28:58] God literally just came down
[29:00] and reprogram their minds did it say he
[29:03] had to teach them their language
[29:05] no that's how powerful the Lord Jesus
[29:07] Christ is when he comes down he just
[29:09] says well they're going to do that but
[29:10] guess what I'm just going to go here and
[29:11] reprogram them
[29:13] I'm just gonna put them all to sleep and
[29:16] when they wake up they're not going to
[29:17] know how to talk to each other
[29:20] that's how just how easy it is for him
[29:22] does it seem like it was a hard battle
[29:24] to win no it was not a hard battle it
[29:28] was very very simple he just come on
[29:29] down says well and then they wake up and
[29:33] they're like
[29:35] they couldn't understand each other's
[29:36] words right now notice that's exactly
[29:38] what God did so the Lord scattered them
[29:40] abroad from thence upon the face of the
[29:42] Earth and they left they left off to
[29:45] build this city there it is
[29:47] God defeated him one time they're going
[29:49] to go Ascend it in they're going to take
[29:50] over they're going to judge God for
[29:53] judging them they're the fathers and
[29:54] this and this however God just said no
[29:55] and that's just not going to happen
[29:57] sorry could he do it yeah he could do it
[29:59] but I'm not going to let you do it right
[30:01] now notice here
[30:04] let's just read these things because how
[30:06] how what about Unity how's it going to
[30:09] bring these things what we'll see what
[30:11] will we see first right and Joseph
[30:13] nourished his father and his brother and
[30:15] he's in all his father's house with
[30:16] bread according to the families and now
[30:18] notice here as this drought as the
[30:21] spamming gets worse and worse let's just
[30:24] examine this now notice this is right
[30:26] this is in God's Playbook
[30:28] God allowed this God set this famine God
[30:32] allowed these things to take place and
[30:33] now notice Satan is watching this
[30:36] and Satan's taking notes
[30:40] look how the people react with
[30:43] as they run out of money look how the
[30:45] people act as they get hungry look at
[30:46] the people act how they get anxious and
[30:48] how they get desperate and what would
[30:50] they do here and notice how they do this
[30:51] and he's watching every family and he's
[30:53] just watching every person he's learning
[30:54] their
[30:56] the weaknesses of the flesh I'll see it
[30:58] like that
[30:59] Genesis 47 verse 13 and there is no
[31:03] bread in all the land and the famine was
[31:05] very sore so the land of Egypt and all
[31:07] the land of Canaan fainted by reason of
[31:10] the famine they're getting weak they
[31:13] realize nothing's growing they're two
[31:15] three years in at this point
[31:18] he says and Joseph gathered up all the
[31:20] money that was found in the land of
[31:21] Egypt in other words they took all their
[31:23] money and bought as much food as they
[31:25] could to last them what
[31:27] as long as possible year
[31:31] he says and Joseph brought all the money
[31:33] to Pharaoh's house and when the money
[31:36] failed in the land of Egypt and the land
[31:38] of Canaan all the Egyptians came unto
[31:40] pharah or sorry Joseph and said give us
[31:43] bread for why should we die in thy
[31:45] presence for the money failing there was
[31:47] an economic collapse
[31:51] and Joseph said give your cattle and
[31:54] I'll give you for your cattle if money
[31:57] fail says okay you don't have any money
[31:59] fine what do you have when I know you
[32:02] have animals and this and that he says
[32:04] give me your animals
[32:05] so notice it was a slow walk
[32:09] people at work are like oh I've got guns
[32:11] and I've got this saved up how long is
[32:13] that going to last you
[32:17] the devil's very patient too
[32:20] it was remember the prophet of God I was
[32:22] like this Jesus prophesied of that tree
[32:24] that would grow up and that was a seed
[32:26] to have a mustard and all the fowls of
[32:28] the air he said that was the prophecy of
[32:30] what's coming 2 000 years ago
[32:33] and God allowed those things he washed
[32:35] those things and he just let the what
[32:37] the devil take his time and this and
[32:38] this and God take his time as well
[32:41] and Joseph said give your cattle he says
[32:43] I'll give you for your cattle is for
[32:44] money and they brought their cattle into
[32:46] Joseph and Joseph gave them bread in
[32:49] exchange for horses and for flocks and
[32:52] for the cattle of the herds and for
[32:53] asses and and he fed them with bread for
[32:56] their cattle for that year
[32:59] wow we're good we're saved for another
[33:01] year they're just kicking the can of
[33:03] debt down one more year the uh the
[33:05] ceiling the dead ceiling's been going on
[33:07] just we're going to raise it one more
[33:09] time
[33:12] and when that year was ended
[33:16] they came unto him the second year and
[33:18] said unto him we will not hide it from
[33:20] my Lord how that our money is spent our
[33:24] Lord also hath our herds and cattles
[33:26] there is not there is not all left in
[33:28] the sight of the Lord but our bodies and
[33:31] our
[33:31] lands
[33:34] selling themselves now will come down to
[33:37] therefore shall we die before nine eyes
[33:39] he says both we in our land by us and
[33:42] our land for bread and we in our land
[33:44] will be servants unto the Pharaoh and
[33:46] give us sea that we may live and not die
[33:48] and the lands be not desolate so here
[33:50] they they're at the point now where
[33:53] it's by us
[33:55] by us and we will be owned by you
[33:59] and they willingly
[34:01] gave up themselves as property
[34:05] and sold themselves out
[34:08] to pharaoh
[34:11] and notice here
[34:12] verse 25
[34:14] and they said thou has saved Our Lives
[34:17] they were very very happy for it should
[34:19] they be absolutely this was a good one
[34:22] I would have loved to been right there
[34:24] too absolutely God what God used Joseph
[34:26] to save us praise God and Joseph what
[34:28] was a type of Christ but now notice
[34:30] what's coming
[34:34] is going to be working as the work of
[34:36] the devil
[34:39] now notice
[34:41] but also here we see in verse 22 only
[34:44] the land of the priests bought he not
[34:46] for the priest had a portion assigned to
[34:48] them of pharaoh and to eat their portion
[34:50] which Pharaoh gave them wherefore they
[34:52] sold out their lands now notice all the
[34:54] ones were an exemption
[34:56] or the essential workers were the
[34:58] priests
[35:01] why the prophet of God said he says he
[35:03] says he says when this economical move
[35:05] comes he says the ministers the
[35:07] preachers will be tempted to give in
[35:10] to serve what in the world church
[35:12] instead of being not being able to serve
[35:14] God in the public eye at all but they'll
[35:17] also receive a little reward for that as
[35:20] well
[35:21] as my plumbing inspector says he says he
[35:24] says about the American he says we have
[35:26] the best politicians money can buy
[35:30] and pretty soon they'll have the best
[35:31] priest money can buy his will sure now
[35:35] let's continue on here now notice here
[35:37] he says what will happen he says he says
[35:40] just exactly like it was in the days of
[35:42] Noah that won the day of Mercy that one
[35:45] day he's at the door of Mercy will be
[35:47] closed then the scripture says the
[35:49] sanctuary becomes Smoky that means uh
[35:52] the intercessor will be gone I'll say
[35:54] like this
[35:55] saints of God is Christ come down and is
[35:58] is God is the Lord Jesus Christ off the
[36:00] mercy seat right now no
[36:02] we see that as your pastors down in
[36:04] Amish Country trying to win souls for
[36:06] Christ it shows what the grace is still
[36:08] here amen God is still up on that Mercy
[36:11] Seat what interceding what for our sins
[36:13] what by his Precious Blood amen now
[36:19] he says now he goes how I could speak of
[36:21] different things as we know that right
[36:22] promised here in the last days we see it
[36:25] right before us he says he says another
[36:27] red light flashing carrying along among
[36:30] our women he says things like that
[36:31] they're doing we see we see it's
[36:34] pointing every Milestone or milepost
[36:36] everything every needle every Compass is
[36:38] set straight unto his coming we're at
[36:41] the end now notice here's what a lot of
[36:43] I'll say this there's I've heard this a
[36:44] lot in in my little listings of
[36:47] ministers
[36:49] we're at the end
[36:50] there is nothing else I know to happen
[36:52] but the coming of the Lord
[36:54] now he says this in 1963 after the seals
[36:57] and people say look he says we have
[36:58] nothing there's nothing else coming
[37:00] the just the coming Lord the Rapture
[37:01] that's all we're going to see that's the
[37:02] only thing next The Prophet's coming
[37:04] done what he did this and this we're
[37:05] restored we're all back and such and
[37:07] such
[37:09] but is this the truth is this fully the
[37:11] Revelation is this the just one quote
[37:14] Revelation no now notice here's number
[37:16] two
[37:17] uh quote he says I can't say the Lord
[37:20] told me he says I can't see the I can't
[37:23] say the Lord told me so this is not as
[37:26] of saith the Lord he says but I believe
[37:28] that this generation living now will
[37:30] witness that Rapture that's how close I
[37:32] believe I can't see nothing else coming
[37:35] but it's not thus saith the Lord
[37:38] but what did Jesus tell us we would see
[37:40] first
[37:42] before the Rapture what did Jesus say we
[37:44] would see first
[37:46] oh Malachi 4 absolutely but what's after
[37:48] that
[37:50] notice here
[37:52] we know the parable of the wheat in the
[37:53] tears but notice in verse 30 let both
[37:56] grow together until the Harvest
[37:58] we're there now
[38:00] we're at the Harvest time we see the
[38:02] maturity of insanity we see the the full
[38:06] of fruitation of confusion
[38:09] if Satan is the father of Lies
[38:12] and lies bring forth confusion and he's
[38:14] the author of all confusion
[38:17] here we are we have arrived we're at
[38:21] what the Harvest Time and in the time of
[38:23] the Harvest I'll say to the Reapers go
[38:26] ye gather first
[38:28] the tares
[38:31] this is what we're going to see first is
[38:33] the Gathering of the tares well brother
[38:36] Sai they were gathering in The
[38:38] ecumenical council but remember in 2014
[38:41] Tony Palmer went down there he says the
[38:44] lutherans have joined with us the
[38:45] Methodist said for joined with us he
[38:47] says uh the the this and that and he
[38:49] said but no Evangelical has joined up
[38:51] with us yet
[38:56] but they're going to
[38:58] but what are we what are we going to see
[39:00] first The Binding of these tares and
[39:04] bind them in bundles to burn them
[39:07] but gather the wheat into my barn but
[39:10] first we're going to see this Gathering
[39:14] as your pastor did what a little study
[39:15] on the Asbury Revival
[39:19] it was complete worship for weeks and
[39:20] weeks and weeks with no word no there's
[39:25] Doctrine
[39:28] we had a minister come a while back says
[39:30] we got to lay down all our Doctrine I'm
[39:32] like oh no no no no
[39:34] the doctrine is the heart and soul of
[39:37] God Almighty absolutely saints of God
[39:40] you better know your Doctrine you better
[39:42] stick with the doctrine and say nothing
[39:44] contrary to what was revealed to this
[39:46] hour to this day
[39:47] amen now
[39:49] so are these things were those things
[39:51] prophesied this coming against like we
[39:53] saw in 1959 that prophecy that come up
[39:55] says he says they're planning
[39:57] destruction right now for this for you
[39:59] they're coming after you now notice here
[40:00] in Psalms 83.
[40:03] a song or Psalm of ASAP
[40:07] keep not thou silent oh God no notice
[40:09] it's in a time of Silence
[40:13] what was Silence about half an hour
[40:16] that seventh seal the coming of the Lord
[40:19] there was silence for about we know the
[40:21] Revelation from the first to the sixth
[40:24] seals we know exactly what that
[40:26] we know the Seven Seals broken up into
[40:28] three parts right and that first part
[40:30] was what the seven Thunders
[40:35] but in that time between those releases
[40:38] of those things
[40:39] he says there's a time of Silence he
[40:42] says well God hold thy peace and not be
[40:44] still hold not thy peace and be not
[40:47] still oh God for thine enemies have make
[40:49] make a tumult and they they hate thee
[40:52] shall lift up their heads they have
[40:54] taken crafty counsel this is exactly
[40:57] what that's Holy Ghost what the Holy
[40:59] Spirit spoke to them in 1958 he says
[41:01] they've taken crafty counsel against thy
[41:04] people and a consulted against thy
[41:06] hidden ones who are these hidden ones
[41:09] those that have been born again those
[41:11] that have received the Holy Ghost those
[41:12] that are what are hidden in Christ Jesus
[41:14] amen
[41:15] this is you
[41:17] he says they have said come and let us
[41:20] cut them off from being a nation that
[41:22] the name of Israel be no more no more in
[41:25] remembrance for they have consulted
[41:28] together with one consent notice all of
[41:31] them came together
[41:34] who who came together
[41:36] and confronted confederated against the
[41:39] team together
[41:41] the Tabernacles or the churches
[41:45] or the prophet of God said
[41:48] The Lodges the Beast lodges
[41:52] these have what come together against
[41:55] what the Bride of Jesus Christ
[42:00] the Tabernacles The Lodges of Edom
[42:02] ishmaelites the Moab a MOAB the
[42:04] hagaronites all these ice
[42:07] boom you name them all come together to
[42:10] want to destroy God's people
[42:12] now notice what does it say
[42:15] verse 12 who said let us make take to
[42:18] ourselves the houses of God in
[42:20] possession what the prophet God say in
[42:22] the church age book he says when this
[42:24] thing comes down he says they're going
[42:26] to take your churches and make them
[42:27] storehouses they're just going to take
[42:29] them over
[42:30] and for stores for military or however
[42:34] right there exactly what exactly in the
[42:36] scripture right there it is they're
[42:37] going to take we're not going to be able
[42:38] to win worship here we'll have to go on
[42:40] the ground
[42:44] we'll be hiding under the feathers the
[42:46] wings of Jehovah
[42:50] but now notice what does God said oh my
[42:52] God he says make them like a wheel as
[42:54] the stubble before the wind as the fire
[42:57] burned now notice this is what the
[42:59] Gathering of the tares right here they
[43:01] have gathered together
[43:04] to what come and destroy the wheat but
[43:06] notice as they gather God God knows it
[43:08] he says he says as the stubborn before
[43:10] the wind and as a fire burneth of a wood
[43:14] he says and the Flames said the
[43:15] mountains on fire he says notice he says
[43:17] bind him he says and they'll be burnt
[43:20] that's exactly right
[43:22] now
[43:25] there's a quote where the BAM said he
[43:26] says he says you better run from
[43:28] denomination he says you better run from
[43:30] organization with all your might he says
[43:33] flee from it stay away from anything
[43:35] that looks organized
[43:38] because what is the denomination is the
[43:40] mark of the beast absolutely he said
[43:43] Trinity is a what the mark of the beast
[43:46] now notice he says uh
[43:48] now what do they do now all of them he
[43:50] says no Jesus said in the last days he
[43:52] would bind first he'd bind all what the
[43:54] tares is that right boy he says they're
[43:57] sure binding up now World Council church
[43:59] has got them every one Pentecostals and
[44:01] all he says they're all bound together
[44:02] for the burning that's exactly right
[44:04] uh-huh separating separating them for
[44:06] from the wheat praise God for that he
[44:08] says that's right he says separating
[44:10] them all out unbelievers don't walk in
[44:13] their way
[44:15] he says don't go by their learning he
[44:17] says come by
[44:19] the word of God
[44:24] he said that's right don't be dismayed
[44:26] at the signs of God true signs of Heaven
[44:28] that's right now let me say like this
[44:30] the other night
[44:32] I was eating some pizza
[44:34] sweet Lemmy over here Pastor cam
[44:37] and Emma's like brother Psy what was
[44:39] that thing you're talking about
[44:40] three levels of hell and I reiterated it
[44:43] and my pastor goes what quotes that and
[44:46] I go
[44:48] well I don't know
[44:50] and that thing got on my mind
[44:53] and I go somebody in this message taught
[44:55] me that
[44:56] so what I do yesterday I started looking
[44:58] for that quote I started looking for
[45:01] this
[45:01] I could not find it
[45:03] so I had to I asked a little Emma to
[45:06] forgive me for that but I'll tell you
[45:07] like this
[45:09] we've been in this message 20 years now
[45:11] plus some of us
[45:14] but I heard things
[45:16] and I was taught things
[45:18] that were not necessarily true and I'm
[45:21] still finding these things out that
[45:22] those things that were false I'm still
[45:24] reiterating them and teaching them and
[45:26] telling people about these and yet
[45:27] there's nothing to them
[45:29] as far as I know now keep looking for
[45:31] those quotes but
[45:33] see that's how we've got to be so
[45:35] careful
[45:36] and here I told my
[45:38] sweetheart niece right here something I
[45:40] could not even prove
[45:42] I said oh my goodness God have mercy on
[45:44] me
[45:45] it almost said it it sent like almost
[45:46] like a chill through my my body and I
[45:49] was like
[45:50] it's Emma Jane that's nobody like a
[45:52] Lydia or a Malachi
[45:54] these are these are the
[45:57] I'm related to these These are leaning
[45:59] on things out they see me as a teacher
[46:01] of the Bible
[46:03] I said man I've got to be even more
[46:04] clear I've got to be so careful
[46:07] you've got to prove these things I got
[46:08] to make sure what I'm saying is correct
[46:12] I'm gonna put such an urgency as just
[46:14] something in my heart I was like God
[46:15] forgive me so I want I mean I'm so sorry
[46:17] I said those things and I've taught that
[46:19] before I believe
[46:20] but it was because I had heard it's from
[46:22] someone in the message or was taught it
[46:24] by someone the message and I just took
[46:25] it as gospel
[46:27] but that's a as far as I know right now
[46:29] that was not that's not in the word
[46:32] now there is the Bible says a lowest
[46:34] town and a greater sins and those sort
[46:37] of things but I have to study it a
[46:39] little more so I want to retract to that
[46:40] thing so I I publicly asked your
[46:43] forgiveness sir especially from him on
[46:44] if I taught it before here so now let's
[46:46] continue on here
[46:47] but that just really shook me and I was
[46:49] like God Mercy where did I hear that
[46:51] hear that
[46:53] now notice let's continue on here
[46:55] we're at 44 minutes everybody okay
[46:58] now notice
[47:01] I wanna I wanna I wanna take you down a
[47:03] little Trail here
[47:04] as I thought about uniting
[47:06] and coming together
[47:08] and as we said before there's only two
[47:10] Spirits there's the Holy Ghost and
[47:12] there's the devil
[47:14] and everyone is controlled by one of
[47:16] those two spirits
[47:20] and if you look at Israel
[47:23] after Mount Sinai and the Ten
[47:25] Commandments God set up a priesthood
[47:28] and that priesthood was good for a while
[47:31] and then it began to go downhill
[47:33] and then because they went downhill God
[47:36] if you read Isaiah if you read Jeremiah
[47:39] and Ezekiel God blast the priesthood it
[47:41] was all because of them that the people
[47:44] fell and the God was angry of the people
[47:45] and then God sent them what into
[47:47] captivity and they went into captivity
[47:49] with a priesthood but they come out then
[47:51] with something different
[47:56] and as we see now the coming up of
[47:58] Christ and when Jesus started appear on
[48:01] Earth and those sort of things we find
[48:02] things set up that are not priesthoods
[48:05] like they were in the beginning
[48:07] but it was something different
[48:09] now look at this
[48:12] notice the prophet of God comes on the
[48:14] scene John
[48:15] and the same John had his Raymond and
[48:17] camels here and leather girdle around
[48:20] his loins and his meat was Locus and
[48:23] Wild Honey thank God it wasn't spiders
[48:26] or scorpions he says then went out to
[48:30] him Jerusalem and jujita and all the
[48:31] land around Jordan and were baptized of
[48:33] him and Jordan confessing their sins but
[48:36] when he saw many of the Pharisees and
[48:39] Sadducees come to his baptism
[48:43] you know Pharisees were
[48:45] disagreeing they were separate groups
[48:49] well I don't believe it this way and I
[48:50] don't believe it this way well I'm a
[48:53] fair sealer I'm a sadducee right
[48:57] I'm a scriber however there was groups
[49:00] or factions of priesthood
[49:03] but notice when the when the Prophet
[49:06] come on the scene they laid down all
[49:08] their Doctrine and their fussing and
[49:10] fighting and all their disagreement to
[49:13] come and see what this new thing was
[49:16] to say that was when they showed up
[49:18] there's John baptizing the Pharisees
[49:20] looked over sagacy and said bring it man
[49:23] put up your dukes 50 Styles right no you
[49:26] see that but they came and they said
[49:28] okay
[49:29] we better check this out ourselves and
[49:31] they said yeah let's do that let's just
[49:32] examine them do a little
[49:33] cross-examination to this man baptizing
[49:38] notice how they came together
[49:40] and to examine his baptism just like the
[49:43] prophet of God says he's don't do not
[49:45] get baptized in the fathers and Holy
[49:47] Ghost he says but what get baptized in
[49:50] the name of Jesus Christ amen and even
[49:52] today right now the Pharisees and
[49:54] Sadducees come to this baptism and they
[49:56] still refuse to get baptized in the name
[50:00] amen
[50:01] and now notice what the prophet calls
[50:04] them he says oh Generation of Vipers who
[50:07] hath warned you to flee from the Wrath
[50:09] to come
[50:12] now notice look at the name of the
[50:14] Pharisees I love Gill I just love Gill
[50:16] and Barnes they're my favorite
[50:18] favorite he says but now this being the
[50:21] first place in which is mentioned in
[50:23] giving is made of the Pharisees and the
[50:25] Sadducees it may not be amiss to give
[50:28] some accounts of them once for all to
[50:30] begin with the Pharisees and first for
[50:32] their namesake some derive this word
[50:35] from for a Tas which means divide or to
[50:37] make a breach
[50:39] Fair as which was we saw right after the
[50:41] flood when the earth began to separate
[50:43] right or the however the lands or
[50:44] however people he says whom Perez had
[50:47] his name right there in Genesis 38 29 he
[50:50] says the Pharisees who separate
[50:52] themselves from the people as righteous
[50:55] persons we're called the Visas or the
[50:58] divided so here we see what this is the
[51:01] original Nicolaitans
[51:02] they were a group of ministers who just
[51:05] separated themselves from the people and
[51:07] from another group of ministers
[51:13] he says another place because the
[51:15] Pharisees were divided from the Jews uh
[51:17] on the account of the Superfluous or
[51:19] however you want to say that flower sir
[51:21] us observations they also took their
[51:25] name from their disagreement
[51:27] I'll just continue on here he says the
[51:30] Pharisees according to the name certain
[51:32] divided and seditious persons and true
[51:35] it is that the sect also meddled with
[51:38] the Affairs of the government
[51:44] okay
[51:45] this is amazing
[51:48] where the Nicolaitans started what in
[51:50] the Ephesian Church age
[51:52] and at on the second Church age or right
[51:55] around that and 325 A.D that Nickelodeon
[51:58] that religious group then joined up with
[52:01] political Rome the government
[52:05] this is one of their traits he says
[52:08] we're a very ambitious of being
[52:10] concerned of them now notice they wanted
[52:13] to mingle with the government and
[52:15] religion
[52:16] they were ready for the marriage even
[52:18] back then for what with Rome
[52:23] that's the nature of that spirit
[52:29] I saw that I was like praise God that's
[52:30] exactly right now notice then came to
[52:33] him certain of the Sadducees now notice
[52:36] they all gathered together see John the
[52:38] Baptist and now the Savages come and
[52:40] examine Christ now himself
[52:43] and they try to trick him they came to
[52:45] him certain
[52:46] Sadducees which deny that there is any
[52:49] resurrection and they said unto a master
[52:52] and they asked the question and we know
[52:54] what the question we know the answer to
[52:55] the story and all those sort of things
[52:56] and Christ answered them in such a way
[52:58] he says you neither know God nor the
[53:00] power of God nor the afterlife nor the
[53:02] angels you don't know anything and he
[53:04] answered them in such a way it
[53:05] confounded them they didn't ask any
[53:06] meaningful questions after that
[53:10] but notice these two groups
[53:12] and Matthew 16 1 the Pharisees also with
[53:15] the sageties came and tempting Desiring
[53:18] him that she would show them a sign from
[53:20] heaven now notice once again a year or
[53:23] two later after John the Baptist they
[53:25] come together again lay down all their
[53:27] differences
[53:29] because remember it's between two
[53:31] spirits the holy who had the Holy Ghost
[53:33] Jesus did and who had the spirit of the
[53:35] devil they did right there and now
[53:38] notice those of one Accord they're just
[53:40] a different flavor of religion
[53:43] Pharisees
[53:45] Baptist methodists Catholic
[53:48] Presbyterian and a call you name it
[53:52] they're going to lay down all their
[53:54] Doctrine all their differences and
[53:56] they're come going to come and examine
[53:58] you
[54:00] the ones with the Holy Ghost
[54:04] you see what battle we're in for
[54:06] now remember the world
[54:08] what spirit is the world under
[54:13] what spirit is
[54:14] modern religion under
[54:19] what is everything majority apart or
[54:21] under
[54:22] the spirit of the devil and there's only
[54:24] one small group and that is the bride of
[54:26] Christ who are under the spirit of the
[54:27] Holy Ghost and that's why all the world
[54:29] will come against the bride of Christ
[54:31] because they're going to unify
[54:35] and come after them as we saw in Psalms
[54:40] now
[54:45] here's two major players in Christ
[54:48] examination
[54:51] in uh
[54:52] looking at Christ himself and is this a
[54:55] wicked man to be persecuted
[54:57] both Roman
[55:00] from Rome
[55:03] what would join these two together
[55:07] because we see they were enemies
[55:09] beforehand
[55:11] let's look at look look Luke 23 verse 6.
[55:14] then pilate heard of Galilee when piler
[55:17] heard of Galilee he asked whether this
[55:18] man be a Galilean pilot didn't want to
[55:20] do with him
[55:21] and they said well he's a galley and
[55:23] he's like oh he's out of my jurisdiction
[55:26] I can't judge this guy I'm sorry again I
[55:28] said we have to send him down to Herod
[55:30] that's his this is his deal now right he
[55:33] gets his tries to wash his hands there
[55:35] because what beforehand he found no
[55:37] fault with him as well
[55:39] and as soon as he knew that he belonged
[55:42] in the Harris jurisdiction he sent him
[55:44] to Herod who himself was also at
[55:46] Jerusalem at that time and when Herod
[55:48] saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad for he
[55:52] was desires to see him a long season be
[55:55] it heard of the many things of him and
[55:57] he hoped that he had seen some miracle
[55:58] done by him then he questioned him in
[56:00] many words but he answered him nothing
[56:04] he says the chief priest and the Scribe
[56:06] stood for him and he accusing now notice
[56:08] how the chief frees the religious were
[56:09] with Herod they're with the religious
[56:12] and they're trying to bring accusation
[56:14] they're right with the government right
[56:15] there
[56:18] and Herod with his men set war against
[56:20] him and not and mocked him and arrayed
[56:22] him in a gorgeous robe
[56:26] and sent him again
[56:28] to Pilate
[56:30] so here comes Herod said just wrap him
[56:32] up in something pretty
[56:34] almost as a gift
[56:36] back to Pilate in other words these are
[56:39] heathens complete heathens
[56:42] and pilate must have thought that was
[56:44] kind of funny how he did that
[56:48] and notice the some kind of respect how
[56:50] one would send this one to the other and
[56:52] the other one sent it back and said no
[56:53] this is I can't judge it maybe you're
[56:55] greater than me and they kind of just
[56:58] made friends hear the Bible said and at
[57:00] that same day pile inherent were made
[57:02] friends together for before they were
[57:04] empty between themselves but notice the
[57:07] unity came when it come down to Jesus
[57:09] Christ
[57:11] the religious leaders of the world are
[57:13] going to come down and gather together
[57:14] what to fight who Jesus Christ
[57:18] and his bride
[57:20] can China
[57:22] and the U.S government and England get
[57:25] together
[57:26] no you see what our news is portraying
[57:30] everybody's against everybody trust no
[57:32] one there's their their government this
[57:33] and their government's that and the
[57:34] Russians are spying the Americans
[57:36] Americans find the Russians and all this
[57:37] this
[57:40] but once it comes down to a religious
[57:42] move and the manifestation of the sons
[57:45] of God are on the earth they're going to
[57:47] lay down all the and they're going to be
[57:49] friends like they've never been before
[57:51] because the Bible said what he says at
[57:54] that time he says what there's going to
[57:55] be ten Kings Ten Kings rise up that will
[57:58] serve underneath that Beast system
[58:02] they're all going to have the same equal
[58:03] rights
[58:05] King from Russia King from China King
[58:08] from this and king from that they're
[58:09] going to be all gathered together and
[58:11] we're just one big world Kingdom praise
[58:14] God they're gonna say
[58:19] but notice how fast friends they become
[58:22] at the coming of Christ
[58:28] and when the chief priest therefore and
[58:30] he offer saw him they cried out saying
[58:32] crucify him crucifying crucify him
[58:34] pilate said unto him taking him and
[58:36] crucify him he says for I find no fault
[58:39] in him
[58:40] and honest leader government leader
[58:44] examines Christ and what finds no fault
[58:46] in him
[58:48] I heard just down in Texas the brother
[58:50] he preached a sermon he said
[58:52] he said
[58:54] you know all they had to do in the Old
[58:55] Testament
[58:56] at the time of the sacrifice was a man
[58:58] would go out to his flock
[59:00] and we'd find a lamb
[59:03] and he would examine the lamb himself he
[59:06] could comb through it looking for this
[59:08] perfect no blemishes right oh it's a
[59:10] male it's a male absolutely okay this
[59:12] and this and he would take that lamb
[59:16] all the way to Jerusalem for sacrifice
[59:19] and then now he did his due diligence
[59:21] but that wasn't good enough
[59:23] now the priest himself would have to
[59:25] look over that lamb and inspect it and
[59:28] this and this and now when the priest
[59:30] said that lamb is good
[59:34] and they slew the land that was approved
[59:38] and qualified and said this one is
[59:40] Flawless as blemish then the man could
[59:43] say absolutely he's putting his trust in
[59:46] that sacrifice and then not no longer in
[59:48] himself see so notice as even the
[59:52] Heathen would examine Jesus Christ and
[59:54] say there was no fault in him the father
[59:56] himself said he said this is my beloved
[59:58] Son and who I'm well pleased hear ye him
[1:00:01] what when the father found no fault in
[1:00:03] him as well amen and that's why you as
[1:00:05] the bride of Christ you can look at
[1:00:07] yourself says this isn't good but our
[1:00:09] sacrifice was enough amen this sacrifice
[1:00:12] the sacrifice the the the persecution uh
[1:00:16] the the crucifixion of Jesus Christ was
[1:00:19] good enough his blood that lamb was good
[1:00:21] amen and then what you are clean if that
[1:00:24] lamb was clean then now you are clean
[1:00:26] amen because you become the
[1:00:28] righteousness of Jesus Christ amen
[1:00:31] I just thought that was fantastic
[1:00:34] now
[1:00:36] I find no fault in him
[1:00:38] but now notice with the Pharisees and
[1:00:40] Sadducees once again they do
[1:00:42] in John 19 11
[1:00:45] Jesus said thou Christ have no power at
[1:00:47] all against me except that we're given
[1:00:49] from thee from above therefore he that
[1:00:51] delivered me unto him hath the greater
[1:00:53] sin and from thenceforth saw a pilate
[1:00:56] sought to release him but the Jews cried
[1:00:58] out saying if thou let this man go Thou
[1:01:02] Art not Caesar's friend
[1:01:04] therefore whosoever maketh him a king
[1:01:07] speaketh against Caesar
[1:01:10] notice how fast these religious were
[1:01:12] able to what claim someone else as their
[1:01:16] King their natural King instead of what
[1:01:18] the King of Kings amen sure
[1:01:23] he says when pilate therefore heard the
[1:01:25] saying he brought Jesus forth and sat
[1:01:27] him down in the Judgment seat in a place
[1:01:30] that is called the pavement for the uh
[1:01:32] but in the Hebrews called gabatha Jesus
[1:01:35] and it was a preparing preparation of
[1:01:37] the Passover by the sixth hour and he
[1:01:39] said to the Jews behold your king now
[1:01:41] notice what was their testimony behold
[1:01:44] your king was this their King absolutely
[1:01:50] shall I crucify your king he says and
[1:01:54] the priests Chief priests answered he
[1:01:56] says we have no King
[1:01:58] but Caesar
[1:02:02] notice they went right back and
[1:02:04] intermingled with politics and this and
[1:02:06] this and we have no president but Trump
[1:02:09] we have no president but bideness no
[1:02:13] did they deny the word of God right here
[1:02:16] absolutely look at this
[1:02:18] in Psalms 24 verse 7 lift up your heads
[1:02:21] oh ye gates and be come up he says you
[1:02:23] Everlasting doors he says and the king
[1:02:25] of glory shall come in
[1:02:28] all the way through the Old Testament
[1:02:30] the Bible says what God is their King
[1:02:33] there is no other king amen now that
[1:02:35] might be a natural King but they knew
[1:02:37] the real Jews knew there is none King
[1:02:40] but what the Lord Jesus Christ amen his
[1:02:42] name was and the old was what Jehovah or
[1:02:44] or else or Elohim or however you want to
[1:02:47] say it but what they had a real
[1:02:49] spiritual King amen he says who is the
[1:02:52] king of glory he says the bat the Lord
[1:02:54] strong and mighty he says the Lord
[1:02:56] Mighty in battle amen he says lift up
[1:02:58] your head so he Gates even lift them up
[1:03:00] the Everlasting doors he's in the king
[1:03:02] of glories shall come in who is the king
[1:03:04] of glory the lord of hosts he is the
[1:03:07] king of glory how could they deny how
[1:03:09] could they say what they have no King
[1:03:11] but Caesar but here was a scripture a
[1:03:14] powerful Psalm what that displayed and
[1:03:17] revealed that there God was their King
[1:03:20] amen bye but what is the same spirit
[1:03:23] that wanted a king and Saul was in them
[1:03:27] absolutely
[1:03:29] unbelievable here's a whole bunch of
[1:03:30] scriptures
[1:03:31] God saying the Holy Spirit through David
[1:03:34] saying what God is our King God is our
[1:03:37] King they completely denied they did not
[1:03:39] want to serve him they did not know I
[1:03:41] said like this
[1:03:44] we have no King
[1:03:47] but Caesar
[1:03:48] what was John the Baptist ministry
[1:03:50] behold the kingdom of God
[1:03:53] is here
[1:03:55] John goes to prison Jesus said the
[1:03:58] kingdom of God is here and if there's a
[1:04:00] new kingdom coming there must be a new
[1:04:03] king coming into order amen hallelujah
[1:04:07] praise be to God and what the kingdom of
[1:04:09] God cometh not without observation but
[1:04:11] what is the spirit within you amen is a
[1:04:14] spiritual Kingdom and they wanted
[1:04:15] nothing to do with a spiritual Kingdom
[1:04:18] amen praise be to God yes
[1:04:23] his word is right
[1:04:25] now did that stop them there
[1:04:27] absolutely not
[1:04:30] well some some historians are saying
[1:04:32] that Herod and Pilate uh they had they
[1:04:35] made friends another kind of way had
[1:04:37] nothing to do with Jesus but it must
[1:04:39] have been like a secret thing or a sign
[1:04:40] or they made like a financial deal or
[1:04:42] had nothing to do with Christ
[1:04:44] but notice what the Bible the Holy Ghost
[1:04:46] Records about this
[1:04:50] in Acts 4 and 23 and being let go they
[1:04:53] went to their own company reported all
[1:04:55] that the chief priests and others had
[1:04:57] done under them and when they heard that
[1:04:58] they lift up their voices to God with
[1:05:00] one Accord and said Lord he says Thou
[1:05:03] Art God which has made the heavens and
[1:05:04] earth he says in the sea and all that is
[1:05:06] in them who by the mouth of his servant
[1:05:08] David has said why did the Heathen rage
[1:05:11] and the people imagine vain things the
[1:05:13] kings of the earth stood up he says and
[1:05:16] the rulers were gathered together
[1:05:17] against the Lord and against his Christ
[1:05:20] amen see all this all everyone that came
[1:05:24] had anything to do with this was what
[1:05:26] anointing of the devil because what the
[1:05:28] right here
[1:05:30] they're pulling from the scripture
[1:05:32] they're showing that what the devil and
[1:05:34] orchestrated all this through bringing
[1:05:36] Unity of the Heathen and the lost to do
[1:05:39] this he's for a truth against thy holy
[1:05:42] Child Jesus whom thou Hast anointed thou
[1:05:44] has anointed he says both heard and Pat
[1:05:48] pontus pilate and with the Gentiles and
[1:05:51] the people of Israel were gathered
[1:05:52] together
[1:05:54] Anointed with what a spirit of delusion
[1:05:58] an antichrist Spirit what all the devil
[1:06:01] working everything notice the devil was
[1:06:04] working and God allowed them to be
[1:06:06] anointed that way to believe a lie and
[1:06:09] not want the truth
[1:06:11] bye
[1:06:14] you're going to watch this you are going
[1:06:16] to watch this take place here in the
[1:06:18] next couple months and years it's going
[1:06:20] to get stronger as the church age book
[1:06:23] said he said well he says as this
[1:06:25] religious movement becomes more and more
[1:06:27] political and they gain and they push
[1:06:29] the pressure
[1:06:30] it's going to be harder he said well
[1:06:32] it's going to be harder and harder to
[1:06:33] resist to lose our rights and our
[1:06:35] privileges
[1:06:38] whatever decide you won't be able to
[1:06:40] drive your sweet sweet 2012 truck
[1:06:44] okay I guess I'll walk
[1:06:47] I have a bicycle
[1:06:52] we don't know what's coming
[1:06:54] we know something's coming
[1:06:58] but what it's called all going to be
[1:07:00] they're all going to be anointed for
[1:07:02] this remember we wrestle not against
[1:07:03] flesh and blood
[1:07:05] but against spirits and powers and
[1:07:07] principalities
[1:07:09] sure
[1:07:11] now notice here once again
[1:07:14] further into the perfect book of Acts
[1:07:16] Church
[1:07:20] Paul comes to a
[1:07:24] counsel
[1:07:25] as Paul begins to give his testimony
[1:07:28] this and this
[1:07:30] in verse one there Paul earnestly
[1:07:33] beholding the council and said men and
[1:07:35] brother and I I have lived in all good
[1:07:37] conscience before God unto this day and
[1:07:39] the high priest and US commanded them
[1:07:40] that stood by him to Smite him on the
[1:07:42] mouth
[1:07:44] then Paul said unto him God so smite
[1:07:46] thee thou white of all for since now to
[1:07:49] judge me after the law and commands me
[1:07:51] to submit in a country to the law they
[1:07:54] said thou revius God's high priest and
[1:07:56] then Paul said I which not Brethren that
[1:07:57] he was the high priest for it is written
[1:07:59] thou shall not speak evil of the ruler
[1:08:02] of thy people
[1:08:04] no it's the Holy Ghost quickly brought
[1:08:05] in that scripture said man I shouldn't
[1:08:07] have done that I sorry I should not have
[1:08:08] done that
[1:08:10] but now Paul seeing himself called in a
[1:08:13] problem here
[1:08:14] and the Holy Ghost gives him wisdom
[1:08:17] and he's looking in the crowd he's
[1:08:19] trying to discern he said Lord God open
[1:08:21] these things up reveal to me what this
[1:08:23] Count's all about but when Paul
[1:08:25] perceived that one part were Sadducees
[1:08:27] and the other a Pharisees he cried out
[1:08:30] in the council he said oh there's my
[1:08:31] there's my ticket out right there he
[1:08:33] says God just revealed it he needed what
[1:08:35] God gave him wisdom how what to bring
[1:08:37] forth a division they all came together
[1:08:40] against what God's anointed but when the
[1:08:44] God's anointed saw who was together he
[1:08:47] used what the Bible said well he says be
[1:08:49] wise of the serpent but be General as a
[1:08:51] dove
[1:08:52] he says oh he says
[1:08:56] guys I'm a Pharisee another
[1:08:59] substantities are like
[1:09:03] and he cried out in the council he's met
[1:09:04] my brother he says I'm a Pharisee the
[1:09:06] son of a Pharisee look at my lineage he
[1:09:09] says of the hope of the Rapture
[1:09:11] resurrection of that he's in my called
[1:09:12] the question what'd he bring up he
[1:09:13] brought up a Doctrine and that Doctrine
[1:09:15] started a war right there and the Bible
[1:09:17] said Paul walked right out
[1:09:20] the people got so upset in the Bible
[1:09:21] said they're going to rip him the pieces
[1:09:23] but then I believe it was one of their
[1:09:24] their leaders here let's just read it
[1:09:28] uh he says and when they arose a great
[1:09:30] Ascension the chief Captain fearing less
[1:09:32] Paul would have been teared to Pieces
[1:09:34] commanded the soldiers to go down and
[1:09:36] take him by force among them and bring
[1:09:37] him into the castle God brought him
[1:09:41] safely through the entire thing I there
[1:09:43] was one time I was in the council like
[1:09:44] that and God performed miraculously
[1:09:49] I mean so so what so what is this
[1:09:52] what was the whole persecution what was
[1:09:53] the whole point of the persecution
[1:09:55] to bring to be a witness
[1:09:59] of Jesus Christ in his resurrection and
[1:10:03] power and his gospel and that's all
[1:10:07] that pleased the Lord
[1:10:09] said Paul that's what you're supposed to
[1:10:10] do just tell him about me it's all
[1:10:12] that's all you need to do I preserved
[1:10:14] you but wait you've got one more mission
[1:10:17] you've got one more mission
[1:10:19] that might not be something greater than
[1:10:21] this just say I stand with the
[1:10:23] revelation of this hour
[1:10:25] the true way of baptism is in the name
[1:10:27] of Jesus Christ and there's only one
[1:10:28] person in the godhead
[1:10:30] and that's all that God might have you
[1:10:32] say or do or perform before these
[1:10:34] councils and just stand on the word of
[1:10:37] God
[1:10:39] and the night following the Lord stood
[1:10:41] by him
[1:10:42] Soldier
[1:10:44] messenger
[1:10:46] that's what a star
[1:10:48] be of good cheer Paul
[1:10:50] thou has testified of me in Jerusalem
[1:10:52] you did it exactly
[1:10:55] he said so then thou must bear witness
[1:10:57] also yeah in Rome am
[1:10:59] y so what you did here just threw over
[1:11:01] this other other place here absolutely
[1:11:05] here we go
[1:11:07] and the ten horns which thou sawest are
[1:11:09] Ten Kings
[1:11:11] which have received no Kingdom have yet
[1:11:13] it's coming they're about ready to get
[1:11:14] it but receive power receive power as
[1:11:18] kings one hour
[1:11:23] he's having
[1:11:25] one mind
[1:11:27] and shall give their power and strength
[1:11:29] unto
[1:11:31] the Beast
[1:11:33] see what this is all about
[1:11:36] Jesus is coming
[1:11:39] and they want to try and defeat him
[1:11:42] I was witnessing to my Apprentice I said
[1:11:44] Apprentice man boy
[1:11:47] I said you watch the movies about the
[1:11:49] aliens and he's like yeah I
[1:11:52] like you ever notice that the aliens
[1:11:55] always want to destroy the Earth
[1:11:58] and they're always going to take over
[1:12:00] the Earth but somehow miraculously some
[1:12:02] giant amazing pilot comes out in uh the
[1:12:06] troops gathered together and there's a
[1:12:08] president rise up and gathers all the
[1:12:10] people the nations of all the world and
[1:12:11] we've got to come together and defeat on
[1:12:14] this Independence Day
[1:12:17] that was worldly a long time ago we
[1:12:21] watched the movie I watched that movie
[1:12:23] shorthand how's Ethan now
[1:12:27] and they all gathered together and
[1:12:29] they're out there f-16s blowing up these
[1:12:34] things that can like move the speed of
[1:12:35] light and they somehow defeat them all
[1:12:37] I said what are they trying to convey
[1:12:39] what are they trying to do to people
[1:12:41] right here I told them about this
[1:12:43] scripture I said
[1:12:44] they're trying to get the people to
[1:12:47] believe that they can defeat
[1:12:49] an alien someone that comes from up
[1:12:52] there coming down here to take over
[1:12:55] and what will these Ten Kings do they'll
[1:12:58] try to make war with the lamb and the
[1:13:00] lamb shall overcome them for he is the
[1:13:02] Lord of lords and King of Kings amen
[1:13:06] now notice he's coming by himself
[1:13:08] and they that are with him are called
[1:13:10] The Chosen and
[1:13:12] faithful
[1:13:14] so what are we going to see first
[1:13:16] before the Rapture we're going to see
[1:13:17] The Binding of the tares
[1:13:20] fully
[1:13:22] we're gonna see that
[1:13:23] they're going to gather very rapidly now
[1:13:25] let's stand here
[1:13:28] I know I've been an hour
[1:13:30] hour and 10 11 right now now
[1:13:33] so let me let me read this for you
[1:13:36] Jesus said The Binding of tears that
[1:13:37] would gather the read The ecumenical
[1:13:38] move would bind the tares together for
[1:13:41] the Terrors must be bound first
[1:13:44] and through their and though their end
[1:13:46] is burning they are not burnt at their
[1:13:47] binding they're not burnt at their
[1:13:50] binding right
[1:13:51] he says but a reserved to a later date
[1:13:54] which is at the end of the Thousand
[1:13:56] Years or the second Resurrection but
[1:13:58] once the tares are bound the Rapture can
[1:14:02] take place
[1:14:05] see what we're gonna see what we're
[1:14:06] seeing we're on the verge of this right
[1:14:08] now
[1:14:09] if they said oh the leaders the The
[1:14:11] Heavy Hitters of this world supposedly
[1:14:14] said we're gonna
[1:14:16] do a practice run a little game here
[1:14:18] dropping the world economy
[1:14:21] they did it with the Coronavirus
[1:14:23] couldn't even couldn't even drink
[1:14:24] Starbucks couldn't even go out to eat
[1:14:26] half the time
[1:14:28] my wife had to make food at home
[1:14:32] think about you demonstrate
[1:14:37] and if that took place
[1:14:38] what about this next big thing coming
[1:14:42] but once the tears are bound the Rapture
[1:14:45] can take place and does so at some time
[1:14:48] between the binding and the revelation
[1:14:51] of the Antichrist
[1:14:53] they're pinpointed right there
[1:14:55] so as we see these things Gathering up
[1:14:58] and now they're going to usher in
[1:14:59] something new there's going to be
[1:15:00] something on the religious stage in the
[1:15:02] Catholic Church we're going to see it
[1:15:04] Pope so and so is going to go down and
[1:15:06] they're going to have their little
[1:15:06] conclave with the super smokes and this
[1:15:09] smoke and that smoke and rising up to
[1:15:10] their stack and however
[1:15:12] somewhere in between these binding and
[1:15:14] that
[1:15:14] the Rapture will take place
[1:15:17] let's look at this one more here
[1:15:19] but just when she is noticed Arena tears
[1:15:22] which have the first names until now
[1:15:23] have grown side by side
[1:15:25] than harvested when what niac sign out
[1:15:27] to accomplish has finally come to pass
[1:15:29] past with all the might of the
[1:15:32] organization the church the false Church
[1:15:34] turns from any Vestige of Truth
[1:15:37] and with political might reinforces
[1:15:40] herself with State backing see there it
[1:15:42] is
[1:15:43] the Clayton see what the Pharisees do
[1:15:45] go from religious and stay backing
[1:15:47] married once again
[1:15:49] and sets out to eradicate Forever The
[1:15:52] True Believer
[1:15:54] but just when she's about to accomplish
[1:15:56] her cowardly plot the wheat is garnered
[1:15:59] is gathered into the Garner no longer
[1:16:01] with a wheat and tears gross side
[1:16:04] by side notice the Rapture takes place
[1:16:05] right there
[1:16:07] it's very very close together
[1:16:10] he says
[1:16:13] the evil spirit of church full of
[1:16:14] iniquity will be revealed as the Mustard
[1:16:16] Seed which grew into a tree where and
[1:16:18] lodged the files of the air at her head
[1:16:20] will be the Antichrist and the Mystery
[1:16:22] of iniquity all this is true and if this
[1:16:25] is true then it must be true to the
[1:16:26] bride of Christ will mature and her
[1:16:29] ripeness shall be an identification with
[1:16:31] her Lord by the means of the word and
[1:16:34] her head who will come to her is the is
[1:16:37] the mystery of the godliness which
[1:16:38] indeed is Christ
[1:16:41] and as the false church with all cunning
[1:16:44] and diabolical power made up of
[1:16:46] political force physical force and
[1:16:49] demons of Darkness come against this
[1:16:50] True Vine notice a three-fold force
[1:16:53] the True Vine with the fullness of the
[1:16:56] spirit and the word will do the very
[1:16:58] acts of power that Jesus did notice
[1:17:01] not only will she take a Rapture but
[1:17:03] before the Rapture as this binding and
[1:17:06] the Antichrist revealed in between there
[1:17:09] will be the full manifestation of the
[1:17:11] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:17:13] than the rapture
[1:17:15] so this is what we're looking forward to
[1:17:17] this is what's going to take place we've
[1:17:19] got a brother in our church right now
[1:17:20] brother Freddie Hayes my brother Cam's
[1:17:22] preaching and he starts talking about
[1:17:23] the squeeze and the power of God and
[1:17:25] this and this he starts giggling he's
[1:17:26] like
[1:17:28] because he's excited for the coming Lord
[1:17:30] I'm just kind of like oh

[1:17:42] God
[1:17:44] amen I'm going to cry out until he does
[1:17:45] something absolutely now
[1:17:49] he says she'll do the very acts and
[1:17:51] power that Jesus did and as she nears
[1:17:53] her headstone becoming like him through
[1:17:55] the word Jesus will come will come that
[1:17:58] the bride and groom would be uh Forever
[1:18:00] United
[1:18:03] can you come up and play here
[1:18:06] saints of God
[1:18:10] this is just something on my heart
[1:18:13] I just felt led the teacher
[1:18:16] because it doesn't seem like it could
[1:18:17] really happen
[1:18:19] can anyone imagine
[1:18:21] we can't go gas we can't go get no gas
[1:18:25] the bank accounts are shut down remember
[1:18:26] the Great Depression
[1:18:30] who do you remember
[1:18:31] if you studied and looked at the Great
[1:18:33] Depression when that collapse hit
[1:18:35] people went to the banks to get their
[1:18:37] money and the banks closed
[1:18:40] and you could get no money to do
[1:18:43] anything
[1:18:47] we're almost 100 years from that
[1:18:53] was that set up absolutely set up is
[1:18:55] this one set up absolutely set up Holy
[1:18:56] Ghost said so
[1:19:02] now let's let's read a couple quotes
[1:19:04] here not trying to leave you in in
[1:19:06] suspicion or just anxiety or however but
[1:19:11] he says he says uh he said he would
[1:19:14] bundle the tears first
[1:19:16] sure they're bundling up together all
[1:19:17] the World Council churches everything is
[1:19:19] of them going where it's all headed for
[1:19:21] that gives the church a chance to grow
[1:19:23] then
[1:19:24] see what we've been doing the last year
[1:19:26] since you've heard this word we've been
[1:19:27] growing
[1:19:30] our pastor has taught a study Wednesday
[1:19:33] on Deception
[1:19:36] what was Matthew 24 24 he said to be so
[1:19:39] close as to deceive the very elected
[1:19:44] and brother cam brought that deception
[1:19:47] what horse rider had deception
[1:19:51] horse rider in the first church age
[1:19:55] and what was the first church age
[1:19:57] Revelation in the church age is Ephesus
[1:20:00] and Smyrna it was the nickelatins that
[1:20:03] brought the deception
[1:20:05] that's why it's so important to be able
[1:20:07] to identify the Deeds
[1:20:10] because it's going to be a deception
[1:20:17] get a little persecution where you're
[1:20:19] not fed so well
[1:20:22] everything will have to be pushed
[1:20:23] together God's got a way of doing things
[1:20:25] you know
[1:20:26] when I haven't eaten for a day or two
[1:20:29] you think I'll be praying a two-minute
[1:20:30] prayer
[1:20:31] a three-minute prayer
[1:20:33] no it's going to be all-nighters back to
[1:20:36] all night prayer meetings until we hear
[1:20:39] from him it won't be seeking his hands
[1:20:41] anymore he'll be seeking his face
[1:20:44] seeking the very presence of God say
