grace let's go to proverbs chapter 1 this week is I was studying I just kind of felt led to go back to proverbs and keep looking at our series there proverbs chapter 1 we'll just read verse 5 by the grace of the Lord proverbs 1:5 I just like to take a little thought out of there I've been reading I read through proverbs to take notes I'm just going back again I think I'm in chapter 4 now going back the second time through and this was a thought as I was studying and praying and reading and still thought I'd like to bring here tonight by the grace of Lord out of chapter one verse five and again we're looking forward to brother Joe Adams we'll be here Sunday preaching both services for us so it's been years and years I think the last time he was here I think he preached had that first rental that we had that must have been 2010 so maybe about eight years ago so looking forward to having brother Joe with us and he's a real faithful brother in the Lord and goes about Tim prudes church down there in Louisiana so we're really thankful he can come by the grace of the Lord proverbs 1 verse 5 I got to get there just a moment okay let's read verse five we'll just read it all together one two three a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels like to preach on that thought about the wise increase learning tonight I'd like to preach on that that's kind of a thought as I was reading that kept coming up all throughout the book of Proverbs one of those themes we talked about I like to look at that tonight so let's just bow our heads for word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it aa known unto the Lord here Heavenly Father we just reverence you Lord we humble ourselves we just pause here and nor we look to you tonight Lord we're looking to heaven we're calling on the name of Jesus tonight Lord God we love you Lord God we know you're the great source of all love and every

like that amen I just pray I'm sure that will continue right as she gets older and she gets baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost I'll just continue praise the Lord so let's uh let's look I just I don't really have many slides tonight I'm just gonna preach out of my notes I had a busy week at school we're winding down to the end so I'm doing great cards and everything trying to get everything moves to finish up the year so I don't have time to do all the slides but I did took it take a lot of notes you know in my my notes so I'd like to look at this thought the Y's increased learning and this is par Levin of the series and we read our text from proverbs 1 verse 5 so tonight the main thing I'd like to do is I like to go through the scriptures on increasing learning and wisdom in the book of Proverbs now I was thinking about this you know as I was going through this I had many thoughts that kind of came to my mind and you know as I was getting my college degree to be a teacher they talked about the importance of learning and they talked about how you can hear through many different channels there's different types of learning styles some people are more auditory they just have to hear something and they they catch it like that others are more visual they have to see it when they see it they got it you know they got like a photographic memory others are more hands-on they call that kinesthetic that's the fancy word for getting hands on so some kids in my class they got to have their hands on it to really understand it they got to wrap themselves around it or or when we learn a song or when we learn new words they got a klappa so sometimes we'll clap the syllables like happily or excited or something like that and they got to be moving or clapping or or sometimes we you know we stopped and different things like that there were seven kinds of learning styles I didn't write them down but I'm just recalling those that that we are to have we have those and we know though and I have other articles to how it's very important to learn through reading now reading is not the only way to learn of course because you know Jesus said anyone that hears the book of Revelation and keeps it will be blessed because we know not everybody is able to read and there are some people that are illiterate but we know that it's very important to read in fact I read one article one time online that said those people who were more readers were less likely to get diseases later on in life I forget the men show is one of them and Alzheimer's was another one so stay in the Bible and then read the message stay in the church age book where I'm actually almost done with the church we're on page two seventy or two fifty two I'm sorry two fifty two so we're about a hundred pages so we're done with the book there at home so we got to keep reading say in the book so a reading is a very important thing and so tonight I want to look at just this idea of continuing to learn and continuing to read and and learning all the time because I think we all know with this age it's a lot easier just to turn on YouTube or it's a lot easier just to turn on a video and and try to you know try to get something from that which is okay to hear it but one thing we should always be doing is wanting to learn more about the Lord like we saw a few weeks ago we sang it tonight the half has not been told about all that God has done amen and there's so much more we know for us to learn and understand and grow and I've always been tremendously blessed by all the brother branham preached but I've also been surprised at all that he couldn't get to because he was a evangelist and prophet for example like the whole book of Song of Solomon he never he never really was able to teach a whole series on that and that's why we appreciate the ministry today you know preachers that can have time where the man said they can have time to go through these things slowly you know and and so we're thankful you know we know the Holy Spirit although the Prophet may have not preached every book of the Bible we know the Holy Spirit gave us principles that will last through all the books of the Bible so as long as brother Graham called the Keystone as long as we know the Keystone of the Bible we'll have the right understanding and Rodan said the Keystone was in two scriptures anybody remember one of them is Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the other Keystone brother branham said was in the book of Ecclesiastes and he said he mentioned the scripture where Ecclesiastes says that there's nothing new Under the Sun what God doeth he doeth forever so he said those that's the keystone of the Bible those two scriptures who does thought the Keystone's would have been in Ecclesiastes in Hebrews but the very Keystone the foundational stones of the the Christian faith are that God is unchanging and just as he is changing his ways or unchanging how he deals with humans and how he deals with his bride and deals with his church and deals with the sinner and the reprobate and the Jew right as he deals with all them he always stays the same in his dealings and he is the same yesterday today and forever amen so that's the keystone of the Bible now we must always keep learning and and let's look at through the scripture so let's go back to proverbs chapter 1 and let's look at this and we must always find more things to learn I found as I've grown old you know like I told you my physical strength is now not as much as it used to be and I've got to and even my even my mental zeal you know just get it I get to get more tired maybe it's cuz I wore myself out I don't know that's my wife shaking her head so it looks like that's maybe I just wore myself out but I found my in my physical strength and then my even my mental Z or mental ability it's it's weaker and I've got to work harder to try to get that back is could anybody say men to that I've got to get that physical strength back and I've got to work to get the mental zeal back as well because as you get tired you know you did older you're just you're not as strong as you used to be that's what the Bible says the beauty of the young man is the strength the glory of the older man is his wisdom brother Branham said if you could choose one of the quarters of the hundred years of life to live which one would you live brother man said if you want to be an athlete you better choose the first 25 I forget what he said the next 100 was the fit 25 to 50 and then the 50 to 75 or the 75 to 100 but brother Graham said I would choose the 75 to 100 he said because I know more about it I'd have more wisdom so if you're guaranteed 25 years which age would you want to live and brother Branham said seventy five to a hundred what would be the age that he would want to live because he would be more wise he'd be more careful he would understand this is the right thing to do time is short I must redeem the time I'm going to invest my energy in what's much most important and I think as we go I think we can understand what's most important praise the Lord and what's most important is the Word of God and then also investing the Word of God into your family praise the Lord I think I saw an article last week that said said something along the lines of they asked like a thousand people or something on their deathbed what did they wish they would have done the most and none of them said work more they all said they wish they would have spent time with their family more time with their family so see what is wisdom tell us wisdom tells us the most valuable things are the things that really don't cost any money it's the relationships that God has given to us amen and it's our relationship with God that's most valuable and so we've got to take those things and learn from them so proverbs chapter 1 I'm just going to start a verse 1 again and rehearse 1 through 5 actually 1 to 6 the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity to give subtlety to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion now here's what here's our text a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels to understand the proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings amen so these are all things that you and I are interested in right we're interested in the wisdom and instruction understanding the Word of God receiving instruction in wisdom and justice treating each other right through the right judgment and being equitable being fair with one another right these are all things we're interested in understanding the Proverbs themselves and the interpretations and so we've got to make sure we continually increase our learning and the Bible repeats us over and over again so let's look through the scripture now let's go to verse 22 in chapter one so there's a great a great contrast between the wise and then the foolish in verse 22 it says how long these simple ones will you love simplicity and thus corners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge so you have three kinds of unbelievers there will say like that you have simple ones and they're just happy-go-lucky and they they just don't care about anything oh who cares what if you die tomorrow who cares we're just gonna live it up they're just simple they're they're easily deceived right and then you have the scorners house corners will actually speak evil against what they don't agree with but a simple person they don't care they'll just move on but ask order they're gonna mock it and make fun of it remember Peter said they'll scorn and say where is the coming of the Lord right scorner scoffers oh they'll mock you and make they'll make fun of us so that's a different kind of a sinner but then there's these fools and fools actually hate knowledge so fools would be the opposite of us we're supposed to love learning more whereas a fool hates learning more they like living in their habits and how do we know and the older you get the more prone you are to stick eating in your habits if you don't use it you lose it right and so fools they don't they don't want to grow and they don't want to understand and they don't want to gain a better understanding about life they just want to go in their same pattern over and over again and that's chapter one where it looks at that now let's go back to let's go to chapter nine here let's jump ahead to chapter nine verse seven the Proverbs writer Solomon is going to keep bringing in proverbs about increasing and learning increasing in knowledge chapter nine verse seven and it will read 2:12 there he that reproves a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that rebuked a--the a wicked man getteth himself a blot reprove not a scorn or less he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee amen give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning so see how we're getting an opposite we're getting opposites again a wise man will love you more when you correct him but a fool will just attack you and this kind of goes with what Jesus was saying he said you got to be careful be wise as serpents harmless as doves be careful not to pet cast your pearls before swine so you have to pick and choose your battles when you're going to speak up and rebuke and say something sometimes it's wiser just to let the blind lead the blind jesus even said that so we've really got to make sure we're careful on how to rebuke sinners and unbelievers because we might be casting our pearls before swine but in the house of God and amongst God's family if we're really wise believers we should be able to lovingly and gently recorrect one another or be connection to one another and we should love each other more because of that amen but oftentimes what you see may be a preacher will get in the wrong spirit and he'll bring correction in the wrong way and it'll hurt people or you have a friend that you love or it's just someone in the church maybe you're not really familiar with and maybe they'll get the wrong spirit and correct you in the wrong way maybe it's not maybe it's out in front of everybody instead of one-on-one right and then that can cause hurt and pain but see it takes a wise person to correct another wise person right and it must be done the right way and so this is what the scripture is telling us here now look at we ended off with verse verse 8 so rebuke a wise man who loved you verse not give instruction to a wise man and he will be wiser teach a just man and he will increase and learning praise God I know one thing that you know preaching the Word of God has taught me and listening to brother Branham and listening to other preachers one thing that's really taught me is how to live my life more closer to the Lord and how to cut out things that I don't really have to do right and things I shouldn't do and by watching other brothers minister and talking to other pastors it's really taught me the right way to balance my life in other words you have to have a balance between studying you have to have a balance between working and a balance on spending time with your family I think at the beginning I was more guilty of just studying too much and not spending time with my family and I had to learn that balance and I think brothers could say Amen you know we got to be careful not to pour too much of ourselves into our work right it must be balanced and I've learned that and I told you the story ready but with my physical health James browning told me I wish I would exercise more so I've had to carve out two days a week where I those are the days I exercise two out of seven that ain't bad you know I maybe I stretched six days out of the week I'll stretch you know but I won't really exercise but two of them you know and maybe that's good maybe I should do more I don't know that's the best I can do right now and still be a pastor and working and everything like that but you know you watch other men and you're you should learn from them you should learn how to live your life more wisely for the kingdom of God and then when you receive correction you'll love that person more amen I think you know one person one time I talked to a pastor down south and I just kind of said something wrong and he read kind of it rebuked me like no no that's not right you know and I've always respected that brother a lot because of that and I was like yeah right I just kind of jumped to conclusions I kind of had the wrong perspective and then since I've gone down and you know I visited the brother a couple of times each time I go now since that moment he rebuked me I just kind of sit there and watch and I can learn so much from him and I've really I've been benefited by that and watch how he kind of orders his life how he runs the church how he had preached 'as of the church I've been able to grow from that so that's one example where I was able to be rebuked and kind of corrected and then learn from that how many appreciate the correction of the Lord yes and so we should increase and learning and you know another example is as I'm preaching all through the church ages and a different series that I preached through I've been corrected by the Word of God where I thought a certain thought was like this and then the Holy Spirit will come and show me another scripture and it'll help balance out my life or help correct me on a certain doctrine that I used to maybe be a one-way on ones to follow inside and maybe the the scripture will bring it right down where I need to be right in the middle of the road praise the Lord so this is what the Bible tells us here if you give instruction to a wise man he'll be yet wiser teach a just man and he'll increase in learning and that's one thing we've got to make sure we do in a case like this even on a Wednesday night on a Sunday night or Sunday morning you know a lot of people just come to learn on Sunday morning you know we've got to come to learn on every single night I think that's why you're here tonight is because you want God to teach you something new praise the Lord or if not something new to help you get something right that you haven't been getting right lately amen and think about you know think about all the years Abraham 25 years God had to keep encouraging him just believe the promise just believe the promise the victories coming victories coming think about brother Brad a member every seven years he would have that stomach problem and he didn't get healed into the last six months of his life I'm sorry the last two months of his life because in November of 65 he preaches on the wings of a snow-white dove and he said I just got victory over it and so year after year I'll say like this cycle after cycle he's just got to keep hanging on believing the promise of God it's going to come I'm going to get the victory I just got to keep hanging on and finally in the right season victory comes amen but had to learn hang on learn to trust the Lord learn to understand that not every answer is going to be a miracle right like I heard recently you know like when a baby is born like little baby eat in there you know you know she gets all the hugs in the love and all the attention and all and everyone's real gentle but when the baby grows up then it's not as gentle anymore you know and that's how God is that first God cobbles us and babies us you like the deep call to the deep you know or as the ego stir this nest the Eagles get to a point where the Mamas you know toddles them feeds them but then has to make the nests kind of uncomfortable and that's how we are and I've talked to a couple brothers remember brother Sonny how he used to come and he used to tell me when he was a first a Christian God did miracle after miracle supernatural tongue after tongue healing after healing and then he noticed as time went on they got less and less and he said I haven't changed anything I've done it seems like God is just pulling away and and I could say the same in my life too you know when I was first aid and first of preaching the Word of God in a certain way I saw a lot more supernatural and a lot more spiritual things and it seems like as time's going on maybe you see less of that well if God's teaching us a lesson we don't want to give up on God we've got to search our lives and see Lord am i serving you as humbly as I did at the beginning have I left my first love if you haven't then God is just giving you a little bit of a testing time amen God is just testing your faith and and making you go through a season of trial he's toughen you up a little bit right I know I used to get really discouraged if I didn't see a miracle every six months or yeah I used to get really discouraged like something was wrong and I still have to battle that because I wanted because every time I read about God he's supernatural and he's Almighty God and he's eat we must call him on the scene and how many times do we call him on the scene here we'll call him on the scene for this prayer request that forever because that prayer requests but see God is trying to teach us something in the times of waiting he's teaching us to keep trusting he's gonna build our faith he's going to build our confidence he's going to teach us the weight because the Bible says in patience we possess our souls amen in patience and so Abraham twenty-five years and I keep going back to that my own life you know when I go through trials and these types of things in these quiet moments or these testing moments God is increasing my learning and it's the hard way I'll be very honest it's not the easy way this is the hard way amen it is the hard way and God always takes his children the hard way right he always takes is that he took memory took Egypt I'm sorry it was your honor each of his seven going the easy way they went the hard way to the Red Sea right where it seemed like where what's going to happen but it was teaching them to cry out to God right stand still see the salvation speak the word and go forward right God wants it's like like Joshua the waters never moved until the priest actually stepped in the water and we've sometimes got a step into the water we've got to take the word obey the Lord and then when we finally move based upon the word that's a step of faith and then that's when the waters will move amen but many times God takes us the hard way and learning many times happens through the hard way through the the long way the long road look at that that's in Proverbs 9 interesting now let's go to verse 7 proverbs 9 7 I'm sorry I read that yeah I'm going on down to verse 12 so let's go to 10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding for by me thy day shall be multiplied in the years of thy life shall be increased if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou scorn us now alone shall bear it amen oh my so see another in other words you reap what you sow if you're gonna be a scorner you're gonna bear the sufferings of scorning but if you'll be wise you'll enjoy the blessings and fruits of the lies amen now go to chapter 10 here we're getting more and more wise chapter 10 verse 8 proverbs 10 verse 8 the wise in heart will receive Commandments but a prating fool shall fall he that walketh uprightly walketh surely but he that pervert of his ways shall be known he that wink is with the eye causes sorrow but a parading fool shall fall the righteous man the mouth of righteous man is a well of life but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked now I want to go on to verse 14 wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction that's what I want to go right there the Bible's that they lay up they take ahold of knowledge when they find some knowledge of God some understanding of God they hold on to that promise amen they don't let that go they take ahold of that and they put it up on the shelf and said this is mine amen they lay a hold of it they grab onto that promise of God and that's why we're here tonight to grab onto the promises of God amen Burlison over we're seeing how the Y's increase their learning they lay a hold upon the promises of God now this is tells us how to receive wisdom what kind of condition we must be in if we're going to expect to receive the wisdom of God or the knowledge of God increase our learning 11 verse 1 a fault balances abomination the Lord but a just way is his delight when pride cometh then come a shame but with the lowly is wisdoms there it is right there with the lowly is wisdom doesn't that remind you of Jesus and Matthew 11:29 he said come learn to me I'm meek and lowly in heart amen he said so if he's lowly if Jesus is humble if Jesus does it he's not exalting himself that how much more should we humble ourselves see how humble we got to come to church we just got to say lord help me to be humble enough to hear your voice help me not to be so privacy we can't come here thinking we know it all our thinking we're living perfect before God because none of us are church and we need the grace of God every hour because the Bible clearly teaches us that that the lowly is wisdom with the lowly is wisdom so where you find people that are kind of down and out maybe as we said on Sunday you know a little bitty Timbuktu Church you know wherever there's humility wherever there's people that they all say have the trust it is God that's where you'll find wisdom amen that's beautiful look at verse 3 the Bible said there in the integrity the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them amen so again integrity the word integrity means this it means genuine genuine as' and reliability how many want to be genuine and reliable I want to I want to be just I just want to be Jesse Smith no matter where I am if I'm at work or if I'm at home or at church I just want be as genuine I always want to just be a real Christian and I want to be reliable I think church attendance is really good way to judge that right reliable to the house of God reliable to the people of God we're going to be genuine and reliable integrity is your guide so you know this when God is silent like we preached out a few weeks ago and God is testing you like he was testing job we must rely upon our integrity to know we're in the will of God see when we don't hear God's voice that we don't feel anything or we're not shivering or you know we know we're not crying or for me if I'm not crying or shouting one thing I can rely upon as my guide is my integrity in other words was I genuine am i genuine in this decision is there anything that's kind of master am i putting anything on and also reliability am i reliable with this decision am I am i reliable to God right am i keeping God's commandments that's one way that will guide us when we don't have a supernatural answer how many times have you prayed and I prayed how many times did we pray to feel like we haven't got the answer right I don't I don't feel this I'm not sure which way to go in those moments what guides us is our integrity we must be genuine we must know that we've been reliable to the Lord we've kept the Lord's commandments right remember our the the king down in the I forget the king that Abraham you know he was he lied to and the Bible said that God remembered the Kings integrity hum remember that the king said Lord you know the integrity of my heart I didn't want to sin against you I didn't know Sarah was married to Abraham and God said because of that I kept you from sinning against me amen okay see his integrity was his guide right he did nothing well I don't that wasn't genuine everything he did he put his heart into it he did it for the Lord amen so church that's our God if we're known I don't have it don't have a dream if we don't see a vision if we don't have with us say at the Lord if we don't have any other evidence our guide is our integrity amen what is the way your integrity is leading you the genuine genuineness of your heart amen now let's go to chapter 12 verse 1 chapter 12 verse 1 whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge but he that hater 3 proof is brutish amen how many like to do this I love to do this I have like 5 to-do list apps on my phone I just I love seeing it just do this do this do this do this than that and that's what the Bible says we need instruction if you love instructions first this then this then you love knowledge as well amen and God lays out his word doesn't he lay it out how do you know God repent be baptized get sanctified get filled with the Holy Ghost under the statute of man right faith virtue knowledge patience temperance godless brotherly kindness charity God lays it out God lays out all the instructions on how to do His perfect will we've just got the love knowledge amen we've got to love that God lays everything out 7 church ages seven seals he just lays it all the three works of grace everything's laid out for us as instructions we've just got to keep the instructions amen I think that's beautiful God there's no questions with it God gives us ones in number in numerology x' ones five sevens 12s as we saw you know with the twelve sons on Sunday night sons of Jacob all these things God gives us all these instructions and he expects us to follow them amen let's go now to chapter I'm sorry no I'm sorry I'm let's let's hold our spot there let's get our hebrews chapter 12 I wrote this scripture down I want to hit this so we're in proverbs 12 1 now let's go to Hebrews 12 yeah you love if you knowledge you love instruction okay if you love instruction you love now it's okay now keep your spot there and go to Hebrews 12 I want to look at this again I want to review this most of you're familiar with this but let's review it tonight by the grace of the Lord now we know at the beginning of chapter 12 it talks about laying aside every weight that we can run the race with patience right and then looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith and now look at verse 5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto us children my son despised thou not the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him so this is one way God gives us as he gives us a metaphor or an allegory of how we grow and learning one way to look at it is looking at a child how dear how our children grow in learning okay so God tells us just watch a child grow and learning he said that's how I'm teaching you you are like a child okay there's other examples we'll get to in a moment as well see he says God speaketh to you as children my son despise not thou the chasing Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasin ahthe and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth that's a hard Scripture remember who else was couraged Jesus was scourge Jesus was scourge physically but the Bible says we're going to be scourge spiritually never ever understand that so we're going to just go through spiritual scourgings or chastening Zoar we call them spiritual program called protoplasmic stimulations spankings spiritual spankings and this is what the Scripture teaches look up scourging if you don't believe me they look up scourging he scourgeth every son that he receives but if you be with chastisement where of all our bat are partakers then are you bastards and not sons furthermore we have a father's of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subject I'm sorry subjection under the father spirits and live for they barely for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous can I get a Amen after that the body see any time God's chastening us it's never joyous and yet at the same time we're supposed to sing joy unspeakable and full of glory on one hand it's not but another hand we can have joy in what God is doing because if God is correcting us then that proves we are as children amen and we're to increase and learning like a child increases in learning nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby amen now look what he says where where wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees have a hard time raising your hands lately in church the Bible said and raise them up to God a hard time working a hard time to praise the Lord because you're going through chastening you're being spiritually scourge you're being tested right day after day week after month you're being tested and God says just lift up your hands and give Him praise amen I love the Lord and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man should see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled so see in the midst of in the midst of a trial what do you tempted to do you're tempted to have be bitter against God or against other people in the midst of a trial if we don't understand it to trial we'll get bitter either with God or some whoever God involves in the trial look what brother branham says here I found this quote when I was listening here to Revelation chapter 4 part 3 he says we have sure enjoyed this time of fellowship around the Word of God with you fine people I trust that you'll be faithful now and come to church and obey the teachings of the Bible through our gallant brother here brother Neville which I highly recommend as a servant of the Lord and moving on deeper and deeper with God and I'm so happy for that brother Graham said and the little church I admonish you in the name of the Lord Jesus to grow in the grace of God hold yourself steady and look towards Calvary all the time amen taking all the roots of bitterness out of your heart and soul that God might use you at any time now is that what we just read if we don't take the roots of bitterness out of our hearts the Bible said we could fail the grace of God you could miss God's grace for your life you could spurn God's grace because of bitterness that's what exactly what brother Graham said - if we don't get bitterness out of our hearts if we don't endure the the chastening and the trials then he says God can't use you I think we all want to be used by the Lord the RAM said if you ever feel to do something or a revelation or something comes to you strangely something warning or something be careful Satan is slick and sly asking me put it with the word of God and consult your pastor this is what he's telling you Branham tabernacle in other words go he said obey the teachings of brother Neville go deeper with God keep all the bitterness out of your heart growing the Lord he said keep your eyes on Calvary all the time amen and then he talks about how Satan likes to get in gifts and he likes to pervert gifts in the church but have said for give me if I sound like I'm a I'm a boss he said I'm no boss but I feel like Paul said back there around the congregation you're the stars in my crowns when I cross over the land on the other side yonder and meet you in that glorify condition I want to stand there to shine like the stars in the crown I want you to be there and I want to be there and he said God never sent brother Neville and me to be bosses not at all we're just your brothers were instructors in the gospel and let's all work together oh don't you like that glory now look what brother F says look look how humble this is I read you're really humble quote on Sunday remember bro Graham said I don't want to be one of those twelve judges remember it's look how humble yours now look how humble he is again and now sometimes we think we are the elected and he says I hope we are you know people get up here and say I know I'm going the rapture I know I'm the elected I know I'm the bride and brother may have said I hope we are see look how humble that is now church sometimes your faith might speak out and yes you believe that without then you just keep going on believing it right you only live as high as your confession let me know that but see there's times in humility you know he says we think we're elected I hope we are but let's just stay right with the Bible see that's that will prove you are the elected when you guided into all truth amen the Murrah have said then if everything is right through the scripture and in order with the scripture bringing glory to God in the honor of the church and so forth then we know that it is of God because the Bible backs it up but just our Theory won't back it up it won't know do no good it falls through so then it's something that struct us no matter how real it seems if it's not right not scriptural just get rid of it because there there's a real one waiting you see so there's a revelation someone thinks they have or understanding just wait on it put it to the Bible he said consult your pastor and it is it'll be right in the scripture but I wanted to read that because of what he said about at the top of this quote he said I admonish you grow in the Grace and knowledge of God if there's something preached at this pulpit let's do all we can to obey it praise the Lord let's try let's do everything we can to to bring our bodies into subjection and obey the word of the Lord because that's the brother Branham said 'keep if there's anything that gets bitter between you and a brother or you and a sister get it out of your heart talk to them pray get it out because it will make you in a spot where God can't use you alright so I wanted to make sure I read you read that by the grace Lord I heard that this week and I thought I like to read that to the church I like to share that with them I thought that being good encouragement because what would a prophet say what would the Prophet say if he's just stopping in the church and then that next he went to Beaumont Texas what would he say he would say stay with your pastor go deeper in the Lord obey what's being preached keep all the bitterness Ardea heart and always look to Calvary what would the Prophet say that's what he said amen keep all the sin out and always look to the cross of Jesus Christ amen people that think we worship brother Branham are so misguided may God help them this man oi pointed to the cross straight to the blood straight to love love love to buy love that's the only thing that's making it over there amen you see that's that's what we be taught us now let's go back to proverbs let's go to chapter 13 now because member whoso loveth instruction that means correction if you love correction you'll love knowledge if you love to be corrected you'll love known that's why I love and guests ministers coming you know I'll preach for a month really hard or two months or and then I get a guest minister in here and i could' there's times I get corrected by that and I always rejoin something I never thought about that oh praise the Lord I needed to help in there or I needed prayer amen and I always enjoy that a Christian man who loved being corrected by the Word of God that's right chapter 13 verse 13 13 13 now look at this who so despised that the word shall be destroyed but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded amen so now we're promised a reward for fearing it and being corrected by it praise the Lord I want to make sure I got everything in there okay yeah look at verse 20 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of fools shall be destroyed amen so who are we walking with well we're walk with one another now that's good if we're walking here together now let's make sure on the days we're not here we're walking with wise people too right because that's where ever you hang out with that's who you become the people you surround yourself with that's right now let's go to chapter 15 verse 515 515 5 says this a fool despiseth his father's instruction but he that regardeth reproof is prudent so again we're seeing the opposite the person that doesn't want to take correction that doesn't want to take it the Bible calls him a fool literally now look at verse 6 I like these scriptures in here in the house of the righteous is much treasure do you think they're talking about money do you think God is talking about millions of dollars here no church he's talking about the word of the Lord in the house of the righteous as much treasure when the revenues of the wicked is trouble because we know there's not many rich people going to be saved Jesus told us that it is possible with God to save some rich but he's talking about spiritual riches in our houses how many wonder house like that like I told you on Sunday I think was it Sunday night I told the hello testimony about that floor worker that came to our house and I knew he was gonna play rap music so I turned up the Jesus music rule out and I prayed before him and he said when he walked in the door he said he felt like Love just blew past him like a wind oh that's the Holy Ghost moving like a fire that's the Holy Ghost blowing like a win in my children right there right now I was right there when he said it he said oh I just felt the love of God blow past me when I came in your house oh I like that don't you Church what tract but others treasures going to be in our house accept the love of Jesus Christ what other treasure is there and then because of that heat and because of my girls and show and loved him he's like can we get together he's asked us to get together and have a playdate over the summer what does that the love of God does that because we didn't want to hear rap we didn't want to hear those kind of things we wanted to project the love of Christ and so why does that happen when it's a that shows that person's getting more wise right he's not a fool he's not rejecting that but he feels the love of Christ and that's what we must always project divine love amen that was a real testimony to my heart I got to share that with others to it so see they despise that then won't be corrected now go to verse 32 15 32 he uses instruction despises his own soul but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding amen so again it shows how much people actually hate themselves if they don't take correction from the Word of God they really don't love themselves the Bible said they actually destroy their own soul they despise their own soul oh that's awful condition to be in let's go to now I think I missed a verse here yeah let's go back to 14 I miss looks like I missed verse 14 can we go back please 15 14 yeah there it is yeah here this yeah 15 14 the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness they just want to listen to anything but see the Bible says if you have the right kind of heart you'll seek after knowledge you want to know the answer oh and that's why that's why we had we announced questions and answers on Sunday brother Aaron had three questions and I said if you have a question write it down we'll be happy to answer you a church that's a really good sign when you've got questions it means you're really hungry for more of God but if you don't have questions then maybe something's wrong maybe got to stir your heart up a little bit right because that's what the Bible says the heart of him that hath understanding seeks knowledge if you're a real believer you're constantly seeking more understanding amen that's exactly right but a fool and just they just want to do a deal with foolishness like the foolishness of riches the foolishness of money in a sports and and movies that's just foolishness right but a real Christian wants the knowledge of God so you see that now go to verse 28 I don't think I read that when did I 28 know yeah yeah 328 yes I'd missed that one now verse 28 I like this one the heart of the righteous study it to answer but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things see an evil person they'll just answer it right away they'll figure it out and they'll try to those just say anything but a this this shows your heart is righteous when you study something out to find the answer I want to know what God says about this I want to know God's feeling about this I want to know God's feeling about that like I think I told you that one time in college before I became the message I want to get a tattoo and and God knows I didn't wanna do anything wrong I just I just I just wanted to I just wanted people to see Jesus on me that's how I see you it was a natural desire of a real spiritual desire right because what do you want do you want God's Word on your body or do you want to written on your heart you see that's the perversion so you tattoos the perversion is see they they know something needs to be written on them but it's the word on the heart amen hallelujah so it's a perversion see even as a denominational person I knew I wanted something rich I want everybody to see something on me but it was the Holy Spirit that was supposed to write it on the fleshly tables of my heart and so I Church I'm just I'm not saying anything I'm just saying this I believe my heart was righteous so I didn't take my all my buddies were like oh yeah it's okay for Christians to get you know tattoos because I wasn't in the message I'm like okay so it must be but something made me stop and it made me go back and it caught it made me call my pastor that I grew up with I said pastor you think it's okay to get a tattoo what was it that made me want to do that it was a righteous heart because a righteous heart studies to answer so the pastor said okay here's a scripture and he said here talk to my wife because she was the youth group leader and he knew that she you know taught me more often now it's never right for a woman to teach a man and I know that but she actually pointed me to Leviticus 19 where it says thou shalt not mark your skin and after that church I wasn't even the message but after that that word so struck me that the Holy Spirit made me run away from the tattoo parlor see because the righteous if you have a righteous heart you'll study that to answer and I only studied it by asking one person well I'm sorry to people but see my heart was so righteous it's still one of the answer how do you want the answers today amen brother man said we've got Satan's answer to his questions man we've got the Word of God Alleluia but see we've got us take down and study if you don't understand something sit down and study it that's what I love about the church age book if you really want to study God and know God then you'll read the church age book you'll read the seal book if you really want to know God you'll study down if you got a righteous heart you'll read that and study that I know it's not the most easy book to read I know some of the paragraphs are a whole page long and that's not really good writing for our modern brains today and it seems like it's hard to read it time and it may be but the fact is if a person is humble they'll dig down deep they'll spend time because they're hungered and thirsting for righteousness and if you hunger and thirst God promised to fill you you see that the heart of the righteous study a--the to answer now later you see you got to balance this out because later Solomon says if you study too much it's weariness to the flesh but that's worldly studying right that's worldly studying because Paul told Timothy give yourself to studying give all yourself to studying the exhortation to teaching the instruction and righteousness is training and all these things give yourself wholly to that so see Solomon is saying that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and so see a real believer wants to study this out and really get down to the bottom of it amen and so see that's what Christians are they're increasing they're learning the Bible said a wise man will increase his learning now you got to be careful let me can I just share something real quick it has nothing to do with anyone in this church but I've come across two people that were on this Flat Earth thing and I might what my response is always this what does it really matter if it's flat or spherical but I believe it's fear achill because that's what I believe that's what the Bible says I can think I think I improve that many ways I've seen two people not from our church but they've contacted me out of blue they're like Jesse what do you think it's flat and you know the Bibles of this and that and and both of them have let it go too far where they start condemning people that don't feel it their way criticizing preachers you know who bring out brother random quotes and bible bible scriptures they'll criticize and they they get a wrong spirit and so see what's happening here they find something that they think they can study here and they and they they get off with the wrong spirit on to something in other words I said I this they make the minor a major and they go after things that don't really pertain to salvation there's a flat earth or spherical earth pertain to your salvation you see so there's a balance you know the righteous heart studies the answer well the pastor's that I've known even myself I went and studied it out for different people outside the church and I showed where the Bible says this and the Bible said it goes around like a circle and everything like that and people can write it off the Bible said you know the sinners went to the heart of the earth and there's all kinds of scriptures I don't I don't have a memorize in front of me but see if we're not careful we'll study things you know Satan will get in there and we'll study things that don't really pertain to salvation and so when the Bible says study to answer we got to make sure we study the right things okay actually the three people I know that got wrong about the Flat Earth three people and it took away time that they should have been praying and investing in the things that they needed like overcoming addictions like overcoming bitterness because I know the individuals were bitter against preachers but to get back at him they thought they had a revelation about the Flat Earth and they just want to get back at the preacher get back at the preacher and one of them even left the message and one of them sorry to have left the message and one of them had trouble with adulterous spirit and the Deacons had to hunt him down the church because he started hitting on women see that they got off they got off on a tangent they're trying to study things something that's not a major or something that's not really important and Satan got in there to try to deceive him like that does everyone understand now wisdom would tell you if it's not a major let it alone that's what I've said to if I don't have the exact answer what does it really matter if it's flat or round I believe it's round because you looking at the moon you can see it's round right and it rotates around the earth we see that you know we could we can see that but what does it really matter at the end of the day right what does it really matter what matters at the end of the day do we love the Word of God do we love Jesus Christ and are we loving other people amen are we getting all the bitterness out of our heart toward every person and are we keeping our eyes on Calvary see these things are distractions these sometimes you got to preach the other side to where people will study the wrong things but see the righteous study answer I just that was something on my heart I forgot to put my notes but I want to share that we got to be careful and that's you know my wife and I talked about this numerous times the message the message is like a conspiracy theory and it's a true one how many know about conspiracy theories you can they're just rabbit chases you can go down a rabbit hole with all these conspiracies about 9/11 and the flat earth and how Trump got in there with Russia you know there's all these conspiracy theories out there but what good are they going to do all of you but see the message is actually the real conspiracy theory because Satan is the god of this evil age and he has blinded the eyes of them that believe not and people are sitting in churches thinking they're worshipping Jesus and they're actually worshiping the devil so see we actually have the true conspiracy right here right we have the truth about women preachers about water baptism the Godhead no eternal hell all these things and so that's why the message attracts a lot of people and like I said three people that were in and three people that left because they like conspiracy theories they just like how we're different but they don't like the word and they don't let the word make them difference amen see we got to make the word help let the word make us different so we're different and we're different with love hey man love for God it love for the word I hope you understand is every understand by God's grace I'm not trying to criticize you know people individuals I'm trying to criticize the spirits behind it hope you understand that by the grace of Lord see our message attracts a lots of people eventually they'll fall away if their hearts not in the right place right eventually the thorns are gonna choke them out if they don't have a pure heart so we got to keep our hearts pure before the Lord amen so I hope I just take that as a little warning you know we got to be careful what we study we got to be careful what we research we got to be careful what we look into what we messed our time into or if to make sure it's the right thing we should be into that's right now let's go to chapter 16 chapter 16 verse 21 1621 he that follow after righteousness and mercy findeth life righteousness and honor so there again we follow after it now verse 23 am I in the wrong chapter yes I'm in chapter 21 forgetting that actually fit that one chapter 1621 forgive me that's that's strange 1621 the wise and heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of the lips increases learning the sweetness of the lips increases learning so see what is that that's a speaking the word with grace let your words be always seasoned with grace see when you when you share instruction when you when you teach others many times when you rebuke others we got to say with the right spirit the sweetness of it now look at verse 23 the heart of the wise teaches his mouth and added learning to his lips so see we should as we learn we should be able to do witness and testify with new understandings right I've seen that all the time like I heard somebody today texted me about well how do you know tongues is the evidence and what is praying in the spirit and all these lessons God has taught me I'm able to bring out of my lips but now it's through texting right huh but I'm able to repeat it and like the gentleman with the who attacked me with the Sabbath day what the Lord showed me the Holy Spirit showed me through brother branham's message in the Bible once God showed me that elation I'm able to share with them because that's what learning is you receive it and then you give it out to somebody else you add learning to your lips praise God chapter 17 this is quite striking here oh boy 1710 maokai can you read that for me however 1710 can you imagine that a hundred stripes a hundred stripes a fool could be whipped 100 times and still not learn as much as you when you come to church amen praise the Lord that true and that was what three thousand years ago we should be so good at being corrected and learning from the Word of God we should be so used to it that it doesn't take any physical pain we should just have an open heart to Lord and say yes Lord yes Lord we receive it and our lives change when we leave the building we shouldn't have to be beaten down to it right we should learn instruction faster than what a fool does because that's what the Bible says he's got to be beating 100 times and you still learn more than a fool oh that's striking Church in other words like I say like this in other words our spiritual scourging should be more effective than even physical scourging but how many no physical scourging can be effective in Singapore remember the guys that got beaten in the 90s the Americans went to Singapore they spray-painted and they got beaten with bamboo rods anybody remember that I remember that growing up Singapore is one of the lowest rates of vandalism and was it violence in the whole world because they actually will beat you with the rod but the Bible said our learning we should have the lowest sin rate in all the world the Bride of Christ amen glory we should have the lowest sin and unbelief rate because the spirit corrects us and when the spirit corrects us we should respond with love not with a hypocritical religion oh my god he's just picking on me it's the Holy Spirit trying to help us by God's grace if you feel like I'm picking on your preachers picking on you go talk to them then you'll find out if they're picking on you if they got if they got the right spirit then they'll be they'll be able to be corrected they'll be sweet they'll be humble if they blow up and get mad and you know then that shows they got the wrong spirit that's exactly right so spiritual rebuke from preaching should be more effective to the wise virgins and a hundred stripes to a fool isn't that striking this is why the bride loves cutting messages and brother Graham said this is how the Holy Ghost preaches let me read this quote here I thought it was so wonderful this is up reaches in the legacy in church age last year programs talking about how if you preach hard today the denominations will throw you out the door they don't want to hear hard preaching brother Branham said it's so bad jesus is outside of most churches knocking trying to get in right and he says they was too busy looking at their big buildings and become rich their great big organizations and getting more members that they didn't miss Jesus they didn't miss speaking in tongues they didn't miss the great powerful messages of God who cuts down to the heart and circumcised the heart and tears off the things of the world and shucks you like a piece of corn and the church said amen we should enjoy services where it feels like everything is getting ripped off we're getting exposed it seems like God is discerning our lives and we we feel guilty we should enjoy that because it's leading us to repentance it's leading us to a fresh start but the denominational churches and other independents they don't like that they don't like you to tell them the truth they don't like that at all and if you preached that like that in their church they douse you out and that's the way the holy ghost preached jesus said you generation of vipers you snakes in the grass now that's how I preach the domination else he he he he rebuked his own disciples right he said Oh fools you're so to learn and so to believe but he also he actually rebuked the Pharisees obviously a lot more a church how many would say this how many would say we want more of Jesus we want more speaking in tongues we want more miracles we want more prophecies if we don't see it we should miss him amen we should miss Jesus because that's what he does when he comes in the church amen and he circumcised of the hearts he tears off the things of the world and is supposed to shucks us like a piece of corn amen program said but you have need to get the greatest thing and haven't got it Jesus standing outside trying to get back in with Pentecost he's trying to get back in with Pentecost where we want the Holy Ghost we want the promise of God we want the supernatural we should never lose that we want the supernatural because that's how that's when we know Jesus is here right he's here because he does what he does did it Pentecost amen oh my so see I kind of caught that inspiration from that scripture the spiritual rebukes from the pulpit should be more effective than physical pain I don't know about you but I give in a physical pain really fast I can't take maybe a whole lot of physical pain maybe maybe you're stronger than me I know but think of how think of how tired we get if we're in pain or think about just if we if we get hurt think about how it discourages us it gets us down in the dumps you know oh I'm sick again every time I get sick I feel like I just failed the world you know I had to cancel Church a few months ago I felt like I failed the world what can I do I'm the pastor I'm the preacher on the song leader I'm everything we did can't have Church you know but you know our physical bodies you know how much we need them just to be encouraged and the spiritual review chill than that oh lord help us now I want to get a scripture here just a moment not sure the chapter let me look it up real quick I got it right here I know it's verse 12 or one of the next chapters here forgot to write down the chapter I'm sorry I can't find it there says the righteous I'll just read it I can't find it so verse 12 and somewhat one of the later chapters it says the righteous man considers the house of the wicked and he learns from it again we must learn from the heirs of others like Jesus said remember Lot's wife so the Bible said if you are righteous you'll consider the house of the wicked so you can learn you and I can learn from those who fall away from the truth of God I think you know a lot is a great example someone whom we all can learn from because this is the thought that came to me while I was preparing here this thought about lot lot was a part of Abraham's church can I just say it like that can I just call it pastor Abraham could is that okay now remember when he moved to Sodom and Abraham saw Sodom burning Ozzy saw was smoke so when he left the church when this foolish virgin he was saved but when he left the Church of Abraham he'll move so far away he was outside the influence of Abraham right because they didn't have cars and planes in those days it's not like he can come to church really easily to hear Abraham preach but lot knew he was the father of many nations lot knew about the promised son lot knew about all these things with the messenger of the hour and yet he chose to move far away and he left the truth of God's Word so we know and what did the Bible said he lifted up his eyes and he saw the wells and the trees of Sodom and he saw all the financial prosperity ahead did he not and so this is what he did he lifted up his eyes and he saw all these natural things he said surely that must be God but that wasn't and every day he was there the Bible said he was tormented by sin yet he wasn't righteous man so we can see where he made the wrong decision if brother Branham said he moved away from Abraham and he forgot about the promised son or in other words for today people forget about the message bringing them to a rapture they just get used to living life on earth and they forget about placing the rapture and the promised son has the most important thing in our lives that Jesus Christ is coming and I must stay with the word amen the righteous man considers the house of the wicked si lot should have considered mine there's a lot of wicked houses over there in Sodom and it's going to probably hurt my family right and it did so much so his wife was turned to a pillar of salt okay oh thank you bless your heart buddy let's go to their proverbs 21 12 yeah I missed that thank you sir yeah there is thank you sir the righteous man wisely consider that the house of the wicked but God overthrow the wicked for their wickedness isn't that Sodom and Gomorrah perfectly Locke should have considered what kind of houses are down there in Sodom do I want to move my family into Sodom I'm consider will consider who's living there right and even in our fellowship we got to make sure and then when we fell she with people outside the message even people in the message we got to consider what kind of house do they have if we don't know the first time we go over we better pray before we go over cuz I walked into some houses and not all messages message not Judaism was Judaism right not all Israel's Israel so see consider their house consider what they choose to live in that a wise man will do that and thank you Malachi that was very helpful now go to verse 20 this is the one I was saying earlier the treasure in your house is not the money or the the new things or the the devices the things that we have or the new free frigerator the stove that's not the treasure look at verse 20 21 22 be desired and oil and the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spit it up amen what oil should be in our houses today it's not so much you know extra-virgin olive oil that's not really the only that guy wants in our house it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but the foolish like the foolish version used up their oil didn't have enough oil right didn't get enough oil we've got to stay with God till we get enough oil and make sure that oil stays in our house amen and that's increasing you're learning that's what it is increasing your walk with God increasing the presence of God in our homes amen that's why I'm glad people feel wind of the love coming through my house because I feel it too praise the Lord amen that's encouraging to me church what is the treasure your house the Bible said it's oil brother Graham said live in such a way that angels can visit your house but you have to live in such a way where they can visit your house I want them to in my house again praise the Lord now here's another scripture I'm looking for is it's the same chapter I don't know which one I copied out of yeah okay now going on to verse 16 21 16 so go back down I thought this was kind of striking and I'm almost done I got a few more to go I didn't set my time oh my goodness my goodness it's already nine o'clock okay mercy I lost track of time I didn't set my timer tonight that shows you what happens I don't set my timer oh mercy hours 21 forgive me I feel I know 21 16 let's read that the man that wanders out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the Dead is that lot right there lot wondered out of understanding Abraham the messenger of the hour he wanders out of the messenger of the hour and he where's he gonna live in a congregation of dead people praise the Lord so that shows they're not wise instead of growing me learning he went down there and my dad said he thought he could win a few souls and have prayer meetings and it was so weak his witness was so weak there because of all the torment that all the sin was bringing upon him he his sons and laws laughed at him when he tried to tell him the fire was coming oh there's destruction coming ha ha ha they couldn't even believe him as a preacher he should have stayed with Abraham now not in the same the flock see oh he should have separate the flocks right but he should not have left the influence because when he left that influence of the messenger of the hour he went down into a dead congregation I remember the Bible said a widow that is not a true Widow she's dead while she lives right how many people say they're alive they're there they're alive physically with the heartbeat but spiritually there have hearts of stone and they're dead to the Word of God and we can't hang around those kind of people unless we're winning their souls or something like that because lot chose to separate himself totally from that and he leaves the way of understanding and wisdom from Abraham remember remember God said I know Abraham will train his servants in the way of God amen but that's not what a lot he got attracted by the things he saw he changed location he totally left the messenger of the hour and he went in the way of foolishness and the Bible said he was barely saved barely oh my and member this connects with Jesus Jesus says the Pharisees were widened suppl occurs they look good on the outside but inwardly they were dead the congregation of the Dead two more scriptures and I'm done 28:23 it's go to proverbs 28 23 I got two more 28:23 he that rebuked of the man word shall find more favor than he that flat earth with this tongue so people give you more favor when you correct them right I found that with the children at school I correct them all the time and they just keep loving me more and more they just keep riding me more letters they just keep hugging me on my leg more and more I'll correct them and a few minutes later they're hugging me because I do it in love I try to do it love I find that even with children you have more favor when you correct them now the last one chapter 29 verse 1 he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy let's stand to our feet by God's grace see refusing hardening your neck refusing correction from the Word of God can bring a sudden judgment upon people so we must increase our learning and grow in the understanding of God let me just say like this this is gonna be a battle for us because we're in Satan's Eden we have to battle every day to make sure we learn more about God's Word than we do about other worldly things how many would agree with me on that as we go on it's gonna get harder to stay interested in the things of God and feel like we can learn because Satan's trying to make our flesh so comfortable he just wants us to focus on ourselves and make our lives so easy but we have to stay learning we have to stay digging in the Word of God in order to find instruction and correction and church I'm sure if you're like me now how you come up when you're ready I prayed this prayer I said Lord whatever you needed to do whenever you need to do keep me humble because I know if I'm humble and lowly then I can receive in correction that's what the Bible just said tonight I know if I can humble myself I know if God's got to spank me or whatever God's got to do do whatever you have to do to keep me humble so I don't get exalted with pride that's the desires of our hearts tonight how many on that desire in their hearts praise God we serve let's sing a song here I know I kept you long mercy I shoulda set my watch oh my let's just borrows for wear to prayer here have any father Lord the scriptures are so clear Lord they're speaking so powerfully here tonight Lord we need to continually learn and increase our learning only ask order only a fool would stop learning about God what's up learning about the message of the hour only a fool a foolish version would turn their eyes and look to the things of the world more than the things of God Oh Lord Jesus we need you in this hour Lord God we want to be in the congregation of the Living dear Lord hallelujah we want to become more wise we want to love each other more we don't want to backslide your God we want to grow like a plant you want to grow like a child as we read in Hebrews 12 it won't be joyous to be chastened but in the end it'll produce great fruit in our lives do you know when I pray that prayer again whatever you need to do Lord to keep me humble please do it dear God for what I'm just a man at times I make mistakes Oh God I fall short of the glory of God I see these scriptures and I know who wrote it Solomon and he failed to grow he failed to increase
