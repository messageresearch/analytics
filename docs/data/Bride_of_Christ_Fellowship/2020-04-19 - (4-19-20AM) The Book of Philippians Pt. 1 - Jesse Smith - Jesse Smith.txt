========================================

we must remember ch's they're just small little message churches and these huge seas of Roman citizens you know and or Greek citizens like that you know this was of course a Greek it was a formerly Greek city but it was overtaken by Romans but they spoke Greek and so I had a lot of Greek traditions left over from you know the ancient Greeks and then Alexander the Great he was a Grecian King right Grecian ruler then came the Romans in so but just keep your spot there in you know acts 16 because that's the beginning of this church it's wonderful to see how the church started I like see how little churches started because it makes me think of God started this little church praise God every everyone has their unique starting and God does a great work you know in all of them so you know Philip I is still a city in modern-day Greece today in Paul's day I'm sorry even to this day it's still the the second most populous area in Greece and I'll show a map here in just a moment I'll just show it now so this is the current Apple map I did an Apple map this morning on my phone and so Philip the second was Alexander the Great's dad and he found and he took over Philip I and then named it after himself Philip I Philip Philip I so he honored himself that's what most those kings do right they honor themselves and then his son was Alexander the Great so Philip built the city built a huge wall around Philip I this big city but then his son conquered the whole world Alexander the Great conquered the whole world and so there's modern-day Philip I today and you know this you know you can go to those places I showed you earlier you know that the forum the theatre they even have places where Paul was they have the the river where Lydia got saved she was the first convert in Philip I Lydia we got our little Lydia that's who she's named after right there praise God the first European convert that Paul ever had was Lydia from Philip I so it's a very historical place to be now just so you can see where it is in relation to where the the baptism of the Holy Ghost was first poured out in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and so Paul you know this was this was Paul's second missionary trip and so we'll get to that you know more on that in just a moment here but Alexander the Great you know his influence is it was major influence on the culture and the language because remember most of the New Testament was written in Greek where'd that come from it come from Alexander the Great because he conquered the whole world during that time and the Romans used the Greek language so most of the New Testament is written in Greek right Greek or Aramaic and so as you can see how God used even though Alexander the Great wasn't a believer he wasn't a Jew well you can see how God so used him to help shape the rest the rest of that historical time he's remember he was part of that image that Daniel saw right the head of gold was Babylon and then the chest was Medes of Persians and then the Grecian so like the belt the the middle area here was Alexander the Great and then the feet was Roman so God was using you know God uses all things for his glory praise God hard times good times great times evil men good men bad men good good women God uses all things for his glory praise God because he has foreknowledge he can work out everything all together for his glory and for his honor praise God that's why the Bible said God hardened Pharaoh's heart in order to magnify in order to bring out Israel of Egypt because God knew he'd never repent to begin with I read I read this week in numbers where God hardened the hearts of those Moabites where they wouldn't let Israel pass through but then Moses and come through and destroyed him because because God was pouring out his judgment upon them the Bible said God hardened their hearts because God was going to use vessels for his glory but vessels for his wrath I want to be a vessel for God's glory got a man I want to yield myself to God's holy spirit that God can do good things through me praise God that I'll be a vessel used for his glory for his honor for his praise a vessel meat for the Masters huse praise God so God uses all these vessels out into the great Philip and all these he makes them all work together for his glory and then you know about 400 years later after you know Alexander the Romans come and they they renovate the whole city because it was Grecian and they renovate it they keep the language but they renovated they be able to theater pagan temples they did all kinds of sports venues and public baths you know the Romans were so sensual they were so evil that they just bathe out naked in public in front of everybody so this evil culture within this evil culture as we saw even theevans God had a little message group that was faithful to Paul's teaching that was faithful to the prophet of God amen that's what we are today we're faithful to God's prophet brother Branham as he pointed us back to Paul's gospel praise God and we're resting on that we're resting on Paul's gospel amen hallelujah so let's give it a little more background here now let me do the timeline I'd like to go just to give you a timeline of the history and pause three missionary trips I don't have all this but I want to get it done maybe knit maybe this week so Paul's first missionary journey was from 47 to 49 remember the Holy Ghost fell in 30 ad yeah right so this is 17 years later you know Paul's finally cuz remember he said he when he first got saved he first got the Holy Ghost he said I didn't go to any man he said I went out in the desert to hear from Christ myself hey man I don't know you amen so he went out there for years he was there years in Arabia I think three years or maybe longer and then I think he said he waited 13 years before he went up to Jerusalem to talk to Peter and James and all the the men of God up there cuz Paul like brother I said Paul wanted it absolute for himself praise God he knew Peter was a man of God and these but but he had to know Christ for himself amen and so do you and I we need to know ice for ourselves praise God and there's there's quite years where there's quiet years where Paul was not preaching when he was just studying and training up right like Ezra Ezra was that trained priest he was just all those years decades of just dedication just learn the word nothing really big going on just learn the word and then when God wants to use you in a great way God will use you in a great way praise God but there's years of training there's years of growing there's years of molding and shaping praise God and God you know helping us grow and grace and knowledge of the Lord and so we see this with Paul his first trip missionary I believe that's where the church at Galatia was started like I said I didn't have time to go through all this but it's on his second missionary journey that he makes this trip to Philippi and it's in chapter 16 as we said and that's when it was established now the real reason I'm showing you this is because Paul doesn't write the letter this Philippians letter until 11 years after the church was started okay now our church I think our 14th anniversary is a couple months in June so praise the Lord but Paul here he starts the church through the leadership of God and and then you know he doesn't actually write this letter till later and then you know we see he goes on to his third missionary final and missionary journey and then he gets arrested in Jerusalem and then he has house arrest in Rome that's a beautiful chapter in Acts chapter 28 such a beautiful chapter the Bible said for two years he sat in a hired house it's kind of like it's kind of the Roman government bought him an apartment and then the Bible said he was chained up but yet he got to the Bible said he got yet all these privileges he got to have all these people come in and they were just it's like God just set him there and just set all these people to witness he got the witness to people and God just sent him right to his door praise God what a beautiful time I'm just searching the scriptures and getting a chance to witness because remember Paul's greatest requests at the end of his life there as he wrote the Ephesus was that God would open a door that could speak the mystery of God with boldness that was Paul's main desire he had the baptism Holy Ghost he saw miracles the pillar of fire but his main desire was god help me to be bold to share the mystery of the gospel with all those that will hear it Amen so church what is our greatest desire today just to share the message with people praise God just to see a soul save to help people yeah we want to see God do great things but the greatest thing is someone being saved from their sins praise God going from a sinner to a saint praise the Lord amen and so I think this gives us a good kind of historical background so we can begin understanding this letter to the Philippians and I I want to go back even do the Galatians 1 I want to put Galatians and Ephesians in here I know Ephesians came right after Philippians so right after Philippians then Paul went up to Ephesus as well and then you know Paul writes all those letters the Fiji letter they all wrote him from his prison stay a lot of those letters written during his prison stay in Rome ok now I want to just just read a few quotes to you here but rants I'd like to speak to you on faith cometh by hearing I love this word the Word of Faith now we think of faith what is Paul first speaking the Romans which would have been heathens idolaters had just come over Christianity and Paul here is the greatest missionary the world has ever had since Christ hunters that's ass quite a statement because Jesus only traveled a hundred miles in his whole life a hundred miles is not very far right I think I got to go 101 is 160 to go back home to where I was where I was born you know I think it's a hundred sixty miles and we're not mistaken but Jesus hardly traveled as far as distance wise hardly traveled at all yet he was the greatest missionary there ever was amen why cuz he had power he had obedience praise God he never disobeyed the Holy Spirit one time amen so even though Jesus hardly traveled as far as miles wise he was the greatest missionary because he kept God's Word amen I don't know yeah but I wonder I want you to see that bo-ram calls Paul the greatest missionary in other places I want you to see this quote because nobody was greater than Christ and I know that's the move of the hour to exalt brother branham so I want to just make sure that spirit doesn't slip in here praise God because we've already had it tried to slip in here you know a couple months ago but that's why we always exalt Jesus Christ he's our absolute he's the name above all names amen now look what he says though this is where he says he said I just think of that that little Jewish brother Paul he just couldn't set still yet there was thousands in Jerusalem hadn't been converted but he had to go somewhere else or somewhere else the whole world must hear about the gospel as far as Paul could take it and how did he and how he did his best to brint and his messages and his writings still lives on immortal today because he spoke of Christ Jesus amen see how God God will God will make your character and your your mind the way he wants you to be for the Gospels sake in other words Paul he just couldn't sit still he had to go from this city to the next city and if you look at his ministry Church if the reason that happened was because he'd get persecuted so much they'd hate him they'd want to kill him right so he had to he had to be used to being able I just can't sit still I got to travel here I got to travel there brother man says the same thing many times he said his wife called him restless winds because he would get home he'd be happy to be home for a few days he said he'd be out mowing the grass he'd see a plane fly over and same I really like to go with that pilot somewhere preach the gospel he just couldn't sit still so that was his makeup he said not he said I never make a successful pastor he said because I don't have the makeup to do it now of course he might have been humbly I think he would have been a faith he was a faithful pastor for 17 years but that was just maybe him being humble but he had a certain a desire he just wanted to go he just wanted to go places now Church as far as me a pastor I love staying at home I really don't like traveling I get I get it now maybe it's cuz I have so many kids but when I travel I get so worn out and so God made me I love being home you know the children were kind of saying yesterday oh you know maybe we should move and I'm like I don't want to move being here I love accurate I love I love me I don't want to move I don't like packing up and but you know some people are built for that praise God but Paul was built where he had to just go take it out praise God member he was shipwrecked that's what three times or five times he was whipped three times I believe shipwrecked maybe three or five times he you know so that wouldn't now that might discourage you and I if we were gonna go on a missionary trip with amen and we got to the airport and they shut down all our flights we might be discouraged now we might not right man we might not someday Lord willing if we ever go back to Laos or something we don't see what that will see what the Lord does never know we must not put anything past the Lord but you know something like that might discourage some people from going but Paul if we had a hard time he's like I'll don't bother me I must preach elsewhere praise God he was built that way he was built to be a traveler or a great missionary to take the gospel to someone else were here at praise God now why was he like that because he knew Jesus and told him he said you are the the ministry of a dispensation to the Gentiles and he said you are going to turn many people from darkness the power of darkness to the power of light that was his commission amen he knew that Jesus was with them to do great things but he knew at the end of his life he was gonna have to suffer for Christ's name sake he knew he must come back to Rome because the brothers agamous had prophesied I think it was on his first missionary trip agamous is prophesied he said the one whose girl I'm wearing has to go to Rome to die and Paul said why do you torment me why why do you say these things I know I must go give my life and so he was built in such a way God built him in such a way to be able to travel and sacrifice and take November he also had the gift where he didn't have he didn't have so much sexual passions right he had a giftie single and so he could travel from place to place he can meet sisters and and you know he kept his distance of course as a godly man but he wasn't tempted he was never really tempted at any point - oh I'd like to have a family I like to I really would like to get married in these things he didn't have that so see many times your gifts are all time your gifts match your calling in life amen now look what he says a missionary is not a person who changes as a nation to live now this is what I've said before I preach a little bit on missionaries a missionaries a person who goes and comes back Paul was the greatest missionary the world ever knew now outside of Christ right is that right if you just trained a man and send them all over there and make his home there and say he's all his life he just changed his Nations that's called a pastor right so if I was to move to whatever Japan or whatever you know tie-ups thing assignment Thailand assignment if Simon wasn't moved to Thailand and stay there and preach he would be a pastor he wouldn't be a missionary but he's trying to do missionary what he's trying to do missionary work now right now they have a big outbreak of kovin so he was tell me about that you know so there won't be much missionary work there right now as far as at least physically well that's what a missionary does he goes he starts a church sets him in order and he moves on the next one now an evangelist goes to churches that are already established and I've saved this before but most message missionary trips are not missionary trips they're evangelistic trips like most of my trips I went for trips to South America all of them were evangelistic except we had two times where I did get to preach mother vague out in this two times we're just out in the field and there's all these community houses around and people just come out and what's he doing what's he preaching about you know we all got to preach a little bit so on those four trips they were really evangelical trips not missionary trips except on the last one I said brother Maxwell can we please do missionary work you know I spent what 2000 on this ticket I just want to preach this someone had never heard it before so he set it up and somebody got saved from that and they got baptized I think the week after we left praise God amen so that so we did a little missionary work but not much and so like let me just give some names like brother bender odd or Jason to Mars these are guys sometimes they do like Jason to Mars will do like missionary work where he goes to a spot and they don't have any believers and they'll make believers right they'll make real believers they'll make converts now brother bender odd he's more like a evangelist right he'll just go to where there's already churches like Trinidad or South America or different places and so you got to watch that here he went out to watch to make sure that it's the right type of ministry that we're sending that's why I like to pour that in an assignment when he goes to Thailand or Craig when he went to Japan like to give him an offer because he's going where there's no churches and we believe in the evangelism I believe in that but I also believe in new in missionary work praise God to go where no one's gone before word there's no churches and and see if God's got any sheep there that want to hear the word of God amen he said that isn't a missionary missionaries from one place to another Paul went all the way around and come back and go out again all the way around and come back so Paul was a missionary they talked about this brother Joseph here Joseph Matt say I believe if I'm not mistaken now here's just a map of the scriptures that we read in acts 16 now I'm gonna go back to acts 16 11 therefore loosing from trow as so Paul was there on a second missionary trip intro as he says we came with a straight course to samo Thracia and the next day to Neapolis so there must be some stop here I'm not sure where the stop was Sam throw Thracia I think I was in Annapolis and then he goes next verse 12 and from thence to Philippi which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia and a colonies is a Roman colony and we were that city abiding certain days and on the Sabbath we went out of the city by Riverside where prayer was want to be made and we sat down and spake under the women which resorted thither okay so there's this scripture that I just read so now you can kind of see now you have an idea of this missionary trip they just went for one place to another now if you got your Bibles let's go back here to acts 16 verse 6 I want to just remind us of this that not all missionary work is led by God it has to be led by the Holy Spirit that's why you want to pray and fast before we send missionaries out right that's why Simon and I trust he does that in fact I need to have a conversation I just believe he does I'm not certain that each time he prays him fast but I believe he does I know the one each time you tell me he was praying for signs and asking he go in his prayer closet ask God to put these signs together if he wanted him to go and and God would answer he said just supernaturally God would answer yeah and and and show him God's will now acts 16 six now when they've gone through Friday uh and the region of Galatia and we're forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia look at that and that's striking the Holy Spirit said don't go preach there don't go to Asia go elsewhere see in no matter where we are Church we always have to ask God Lord is this your will for my life see even with traveling Paul's got to say Lord is this the right way to go is this the right direction where I must go you must always find God's will now look at that I love this verse 8 and they passing by meisa came down to trow as I love this look how God directs our lives by dreams and visions like the one we'll get to we're good today brother Rams dream with the store up food sort the tapes that dream directed a couple years of his life me and so many times Hertz will have a dream will have a vision or something like that and that is to direct our lives we have to make sure it's the Holy Spirit so how did Paul deal with or how did God deal with this prophet Paul by vision verse 9 and a vision appeared to Paul in the night there stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him saying come over in Macedonia and help us so the Holy Spirit says don't go to Asia so Paul says fine all right we'll just wait on the Lord he goes to sleep and God sends him the answer in the sleep praise God oh thank the Lord now I've heard just like just a common statement that this stream doesn't need a lot of interpretation does it like you have to look at symbols and say huh wonder what this means a man says come preach to us and that's how brother Branham was - he had different dreams about members his Fletcher's brothers brother-in-law his remember his Fletcher brother and all had a dream where he he went into he's a sinner he was alcoholic and he went into the church in the dream and repented and got saved and Fletcher told the dream to brother Branham he said you don't need any interpretation for that you're you're an alcoholic you need to repent and you need to come to the altar praise God many of our family members you know we need to come right here right where amen came to this altar right here praise God hallelujah where our children have come to the altar praise God to get saved amen to give their lives to God many of these things don't take a lot of interpretation some of them do verse 10 after eating the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them what does God's heart God's heart is preached the gospel amen preach to the Lost give them a chance they hear the word of God now we're nowhere to you know I say it's very similar you know these days are very similar most people weren't Christians right there wasn't many people that would want to hear the word of God so in some ways their days are very similar verse 11 therefore loosening from trow as we came with a straight course to sam throw samuel Thracia and the next day to Neapolis all right now and then to philip i okay now on my slide i want to just share a few more quotes from other bram i think there'll be a help to you and i kinda want to tie this down together how this applies to us well you know what let me see here yeah let me just dive down to us and then we'll kind of close with this AK 16 a little bit by God's grace so you know I've just was meditating this morning and studying and I'm just remembering these quotes quotes came back to my mind we're still listening to the the seven seals in our house we do about 10 minutes a night and so this thought last night came to me I remembered in the first seal brother Branham was reading he was reading 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 about the Antichrist and he stops and says this statement about st. Paul he says I'd like to set under some of his teaching wouldn't you I love that because Paul was a teacher right use a teacher to the Gentiles and so Paul says a prophet says I'd like to sit under that prophet wouldn't you and the beautiful part of it is we get to read many of his letters that taught us the gospel praise God but man that says this next now listen closely before closing how can I escape your brother neither male nor female is accepted or dispelled you're all one in the sight of God when it comes to this how do you do it your heart as a womb you know what I'm speaking of men and women your heart is a womb and the womb holds the seed and the seed is the gospel now the seed alone is its heart no matter how many cameos you set under no matter how great your pastor is and how much you've read the Bible it'll never take life until the germ of life has come to it so no matter how great Paul was as a teacher no matter how great brother Brandon was as a teacher no matter how great any pastor there is today as a pastor the person themselves has to receive the seed of God amen and brother Branham was well aware that many people in his church had not been born again he says it right before he passed this is his last Easter sermon he says he's doing the altar call look it's the end of the chat it's under the sermon paragraph 333 he says is there anyone here or many who doesn't have this quickening power in you the sun has shined across you've sat in this Tabernacle you've listened to tapes and yet the spirit as never quicken you so you can follow all the Word of God amen that you women and you men could obey every word that's written praise God so see brother I'm saying people can listen to my tapes I can be their pastor I can be their prophet but they've still got to be born again praise God they still got to receive it praise God just hearing it as good hearing it's good but you've got to love it so much that you fall in love with it till it seals your soul praise God and then you love to obey it as well thank the Lord I love that quote praise God because all the tape people are saying the tapes are the absolute no you can listen to tapes and still not have the absolute the absolute is Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit praise God oh that's a decent that's a dangerous thing what if you be a dead seed no life in you but there's something in you that tells you I want to rise this morning I want to rise from the state that I'm in I don't want to be just a dead seed be left to dirt and driftwood I want her eyes praise God thank the Lord now you know since we're here go to acts 15 I was studying yesterday and there was just a great scripture I like to see if I can find that just kind of came strangely to my mind here yes okay now in Acts chapter 15 you might remember they had to have a counsel in fact a lot of churches try to mimic this today and they say well we're gonna have a counsel like the early church but of course they don't have the same baptism as Paul had right they still have father son Holy Ghost and so they can't be the real Church of God having a counsel because they got the wrong doctrine but in in this chapter Paul James Peter I'm sorry Paul modernists go to James and Peter they're in Jerusalem and they talk about the issue of circumcision because there was Jude Jewish Christians that were telling people Gentiles now you've got the Holy Ghost but you're not saved he said you might have had an experience but they say you're not saving - you're circumcised in your flesh and Paul says Paul said nonsense he said we need to go there and have a conference about it but I want you to notice here a Peter rises up in verse seven and he begins talking about how the Holy Ghost fell on the Gentiles and he says in verse seven and when there had been much disputing Peter rose up and said there men and brethren you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believed in other words God chose me Jesus gave me the keys to the kingdom first thing and God said and God which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us remember Paul says the Gentiles in Cornelius house they acted the same way we acted when we got the Holy Ghost it wasn't a different way it was the same way praise God Peter said I know how they acted I know how they looked the same way the Holy Ghost fell on them is the same way it fell on us in Acts chapter 2 praise God amen now he says in verse I here's what I want to get to 9 and put no difference between us and then purifying their hearts by faith so see when someone gets the Holy Ghost God is purifying their heart he's sealing their their heart saying this heart wants to be pure I'm gonna keep them pure he's sealing in God's Christ's righteousness and he's sealing out the defilement of the world go to acts 5:32 oh this is glorious matter oh thank you Jesus ah why is it glorious Bo just cuz I see God purifying my heart praise God the same gospel not a different gospel not as denominations interpretation but the same gospel purifying my heart to make me love Christ more verse 32 Peter says this is Peter again and we are witnesses of these things also and so also is the Holy Ghost who God hath given to them that obey him see God waits until somebody is really gonna obey they really want to be pure God I just want my heart to be pure and they'll say okay I'll bet and this for me it was I know baby would get rid of the cigarettes obey get rid of the movies and the cussing in the sports and it just get totally sanctified for a couple of years gotta to keep getting me to obey and purify and finally God poured out his Holy Spirit upon me praise God and I see the effects of it it's guiding me more into the truth of God's Word not guiding me away to man's opinions but back to the book of Acts but back to the letters of Paul back to the holy scripture that we know was inspired by the Holy Spirit amen thank the Lord hallelujah thank the Lord Frey's that's why people don't get born again they don't want to be more pure and they don't want to obey God's Word when I preach on that I remember Beatrice has had a spell at one Wednesday night I was preaching on showing all the ways about the Holy Ghost why the foolish virgin don't get the Holy Ghost they don't want to be more pure they don't want to obey all the Word of God Ray was here and sister Beatrice had a spell and was screaming and shouting all around there last summer I know if you remember that but I remember that was the the Holy Spirit took me off my notes and took me that direction and God spear got poured out right here amen on a Wednesday night praise God amen hallelujah cuz it's God's Word amen and he's searching he's sick he's searching for true worshipers that'll worship in spirit and in truth amen glory okay so yeah that those just two scriptures just came to my heart now I just want to share those there that's who got so these Gentiles had the same heart they wanted pure hearts and they were willing to obey all the word of Jesus so Jesus gave him the Holy Ghost John says hey there's someone coming after way bigger than me and he's the one i baptize with water but he's gonna baptize with the Holy Ghost oh thank the Lord praise God now let me now transition now to our little church and brother branham's missionary work in this hour before we start getting into the the teaching on the book or the Philippian Church now I'm taking a lot of these quotes if you haven't listened to a good sermon in a while listen to taking sides with Jesus that is awesome we're listening to the way here so broadband takes it's like a ministers meeting there's only ministers there and he shows his vision for the future in other words how the church how the church with his message should expand their churches worldwide and they says we've got to take sides with the word we're taking sides with Jesus we're not taking sides with the world beautiful message beautiful and I may go back and I'm gonna just preach a little series on this because it's such a beautiful look it's a modern day look at how Paul would have operated today that's right so I'm thinking I'm jumping in you know to paragraph whoops sorry I'm jumping in paragraph 21 he says I'm very grateful I see it's got little he said time out his church is Jeffersonville Tabernacle I see it's got little satellites through that I'm grateful for brother Crais these are names of pastors in the area Sellersburg a crew back there brother Snelling is place and Utica brother run up there brother junior Jackson these precious boys find men wonderful men of God they preach this message so there was little churches all around Jeffersonville that started because of brother Rams ministry now some of these guys later went off in false doctrine I'm not I'm not gonna name them but it doesn't matter cuz we don't know him but they're I think they're all dead anyway but so brother Adam went when he's here 1962 this is before the seals were opened about nine months before the seals were open he said now we might disagree just a little wallop on something another that's only human amongst a group of ministers yet and if ministers had a little difference there won't be a shadow of difference in it like you know Simon and I we have different opinions on different scriptures brother Brooks and I we have some different opinions on scriptures brother Craig and I but we're all brothers praise God and so Bodrum saw this same thing his message was a new message it was like he was another Apostle Paul and he went seven times around the world not by boat but by airplane and he sacrificed a lot of time from his family but he saw there his message was a unique message it was fresh from the Word of God and he says but our church has little satellites now really Church in all reality our church is just a satellite a brother Brooks's Church now brother Brooks's Church which is a satellite out of the church down there in South Carolina because he got saved in South Carolina now it's strange because when pastors moved then like our you know our satellite moves you know so but so you know from Jeffersonville brother brother branham and then there's a brother from South Carolina I think brother Johnson was named brother Brooks got saved there in South Carolina where Brooks moves up to Lyman a pastor for about 20 years in that time we get saying praise God and then we come out of brother Brooks's ministry and so we're just a satellite out of that church and we all preach this message we don't all agree on everything but we're all brothers praise God and so God is doing the same thing today that he did in the early church there now next quote one of these brothers might say I believe the money will come Jesus be on the white horse others say well I believe when he comes to be on a white cloud well as long as they believe he's come and that's the main thing no matter how he's coming now there's a balance of this too because remember Paul said there was two preachers that said the rapture has already happened and Paul said that was cankering in the church so that we have to have a good balance on this too as long as we believe the rapture is coming that's the main thing but if someone says the rapture is past or you have to do these certain things like worship everywhere program says to go in the rapture now that's wrong there so yeah be careful how we balance this two as well but see but Rose is trying to say that we're all brothers that we need to be brothers as long as we stay right in our doctrine because he goes in that later now we're going to start off with the early church just about five minutes now and then I can show you the vision that I have for the future so again if you want listen a good sermon this is a great sermon to see how brother and thought the Holy Ghost would use him and brother Neville and the brother to spread the gospel around the world now talks about when the Holy Ghost fell he said someone had to take Judas's place it was matthias took Judas's place so he talks about people having to take he says if I died brother Neville died someone asked to take her place so he said we have to leave footprints on the sands of time now some of these quotes I'm skipping because I just want to get to the main ones I want to share today now I would suggest suggest this I did the brother Neville let's carry on it just as we have let's just let's start it just the way it is look he brings up the young ministers that are preachers not take players preachers I'm grateful for these young ministers see actually have the damned judgment this entire valleys down through there Jefferson bill there will be no excuse because we've got little churches setting out everywhere outposts listening posts waiting praise God look it's a big church for the Jose he said little churches amen see a little charge is a major witness on the day of judgment praise God we might be small in man's eyes but we're big in God's eyes amen because we will be a witness on the damned judgement praise God that we lived it even though you know we had we were smaller had a little limitations or things like that it didn't matter we believed God's Word and we're witnesses against anyone who won't believe it because we know it's right and we know Jesus Christ is alive today praise God and we're preaching the original gospel like I said I might not be able to bring it all the pass you can only bring to pass what you're gifted to do and what God's called you to do but we got to be willing to grow into all God is a has force we can't stop short we got to press on and into the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus amen praise God he said last night I was at a brother's Church in Jefferson girl somewhere and I asked if are all their fortified behind the word and every hand went up that made me feel good so he would visit local churches that preach his message his his teachings and he said how many four to five year how many leave here you're protected behind God's Word and hanwen up he said that makes me feel good praise God it makes me feel good to see you guys keep coming back to church every Sunday to bang you nice we would be we've been together since the beginning buddy I know you're fortified behind God's Word because remember part of being part of being in a local church proves that you're a real believer because go to let's go back to 1st John real quick remember they went out from us because they were not of us so one of the proofs that you are born again and that you are saying is that you can sit in a local church and sit and be taught God's Word that's why brother BAM said these little churches you'll be witnesses on the day of judgment praise God that you believed it a man now I didn't plan on preaching this some it'll just look and see if I can find it if anybody finds it just speak it out there they went out from us cuz they're not of us I know I got an inner highlight it oh there it is yeah 3 or 2 to 18 and 19 yeah so see there's an aspect of this if you're born again you will stay with the preacher that you heard the gospel from until God you said until God would send you to another one praise God right you stay with them because you know the Word of God came to you through that individual praise God that's why I sat on her brother Brooks that's why when when I when we we lived here right vague for a year and a half we drove three hours like Wendy's doing now she's done it for numerous years but she drove wheelie drove three hours we jam in our cars I'll pack in there we drove three hours one way just to go to brother Brooks's church because we had confidence him we know God spoke to us through that man so we supported that man praise God and then you know we got to the spot some of the amen where bang and John Lisa and a lady and Kerry and I met and you know and my wife's gonna have Malachi and we're like this is gonna be hard to travel with all these and so the idea came up should we start a church so let's pray and fast we prayed fasted about it talk to brother Brooks we started a church and the reason was because we and I remember specifically talking about this with John Lisa and lady and Carrie they said we loved the message and we believe God's going to save our family so we want a church an Akron so that when our because it's our family lives around Akron they can have a church so that when our family gets saved they'll have a church that's real close to them praise God and look what we got right here thank you God Amen praise God that's the whole desire was that we didn't just make such a sacrifice because we know the same God in Lima is the same God in Akron praise God God is not a respecter of persons one thing he respects is his Lord Amen praise God and so that's the whole point of purpose of these churches springing out we're a satellite out of brother Brooks which was satellite out of Jeffersonville now when it was right when Jeffersonville was right under brother Branham and brother Neville but see we're just like little shoots you know stars shooting stars maybe was say first John 2:18 little children is the last time not that was the last time then what is it now see they all believed it was the end time it was the last time and he have heard that Antichrist shall come even now are there men the Antichrist so it's John's like we know there's going to come one Antichrist we know it's the Pope but there's many right now that spirits moving already this was 80 after eighty ninety whereby we know that it is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us see church many times those who have the Antichrist spirit will leave our church and other churches right other churches that believe that the truth for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out and that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us so your ability to stay in a local church proves what you are it proves your sheep of God praise the Lord amen and you're a sheep and Jesus Christ is the Bishop of your soul praise God Eve the shepherd of your soul imagine somebody saying oh I believe Paul is a real man of God and Philip I we got leave the church and and then they're not even there to hear Paul's letter being read eleven years later where's his brother God did this for where is that brother you know we I've told you before but brother cam but and brother cam he credits me was starting their church cam credits me I was the one that he says I was the one that ordained that church to start so they are a satellite of our church and now they're way bigger than our church but see it don't matter the size it just matters the love of God now I think Cam's very gracious cam is very gracious but you know cam and Simon were coming to our church for a couple years and cam called me his pastor and then we felt led I said cam you really need to start pastor him brother he do an offense you're doing a great job they were doing Wednesday night Bible studies and I feel I feel you guys need to start a church so we per had prayer and fasting in Akron and then started that church and church they've had miracles I've told you some notable miracles at cam Church and yet some of those people have fallen away they don't come to church anymore I mean God has done great things miracles where I think I told you about one of the bows with the cane God healed him they don't come to church anymore different cares of the world come in and and then you know other things I see what I trust and they'll be saved but see the reality of it is if God has really pure fide your heart amen if you really want to obey every word of God you will stay with those that are feeding you the Word of God amen because you want it you can't get fed outside of the fivefold ministry that's God's Way to feet but Ramson the fivefold ministry is God's dress wear so God this is this is pastors teachers evangelists programs that God puts off that on and then he's amongst you praise God he's amongst me he's the heart see we've had we know but when we had the preachers lately who was it I shouldn't lightly my spent a lot of time so we had a guest preacher Simon and different ones like that they came and I felt like they were I came up for prayer because I felt they were preaching just to me praise God needed to hear certain things they were preaching brother and said the fivefold ministry is God's dress wear and God hides behind it all we can only hear the voice of God today praise God it's not me but it's the Word of God that's coming forward from this pulpit week after week month after month year after year it's God's Word it's God's message and we must be enthused about it praise God buh-bam says in fact he says a few moments so say we can never lose our enthusiasm for the Word of God see because then it just becomes common to us at what time am i okay I know I just have something I feel bad I know it's hard to sit there I know I talk sometimes I and I love everybody and I know you love me praise God but I want to be my mindful I don't wear you out some fill up easy myself you look long brother Brahim said I sometimes people get filled up now heat Moran says he make this church your headquarters now it wasn't like the people in Jeffersonville say today he said and brother Neville like your senior elder among you now Church Tim Humes I thought I talked to him I didn't I shouldn't talk to him and I heard his testimony as soon as brother Ram died they kicked brother Neville out of there he wasn't there very long they kicked him out because he wanted to preach and they just wanted to play tapes because that demon spirit of Antichrist was still there and still hung around they kicked him out in fact he would come to Tom and Marilyn Browns house brother bank and preach in their barn and garage till God started a church there Orman never would but this is how much God brought her brother man thought a brother Armand Neville make him your senior elder now looked just he died in 65 four years later we don't need this guy but look how brother Graham was that he was establishing it by apostolic order praise God find a leader who's experienced that loves us faithful to the Word of God and he said all you brothers like brother Neville he said and sometimes you got a question come out discuss with your church here and I remember he's talking to ministers then bring it to brother Neville you all discuss it together if you can't come in any question I'll be coming by pretty soon all come together with it now in the years past when I've had questions I've always gone to brother Brooks but as time is going on I haven't need to go as much it's kind of like it's just kinda like growing up it's kind like when you start a new class you got to talk to the teacher but after a while okay I got it you know in other words now I cannot rely upon the Holy Spirit but but brother Brian was telling them ministers need to get together in fellowship now we did that brother banging you might remember we had ministers meeting we had six ministers meetings with brother Brooks and brother Craig so I brought brother cam and brother Vince we had all these brothers there but the Paula Fontaine came to one so we have six or set and I was one that started that years ago but after Craig left I haven't felt any connection there because I don't know those brothers very well so why haven't we haven't had ministers meetings for a number of years but also meet with Simon and cam from time to time maybe once a year and just just we'll just call it a minister's meeting we'll just talk about the things of God it's harder when you don't like when you have a relationship with someone it's hard to go there and talk about doctrine because you don't really I you can't trust them you know all the way cuz you don't know them and so I'm just kind of waiting for God to renew that perhaps so Brown says you got to get together and come together and solve these if there's any problems he said then in there get training in your own groups other ministers men that you see as a calling in their life for the ministry train them young men bring them up to to the elder all of you set the ministerial meeting and their teeth the deep or teach the deeper things of God praise God and that beautiful boat Ram said if you've got if you're a pastor look for faithful brothers that'll be preachers and teach them the Word of God and then have ministerial meetings and train them up we had in 2015 and 16 we had three ministers meetings because I had four brothers that were thought they were preachers in our church and within one year we had no more because they all left and I'll tell you this one of them I've said questions on I said God if you want if you want this person to preach at our church anymore I said let them stay but if not send them away and within a month God sent that person see cuz I put it up to God in prayer but when I when I saw our church growing like that by a minute was right when you came in when we start went over there and I saw had four ministers on the oklets that ministers meeting because I knew this quote I want to train them up in what I believe but we only had three and pretty soon most of all they're all gone now and I don't want to name names but I'm trying to show you that I believe in the Apostolic teaching I believe in that and God has a time and season for and we're not supposed to stay on simple things we're to go to deeper things of God the mysteries of God praise the Lord but could be any deeper than a mystery of God now I want to find a scripture real quick where Paul said commit them to faithful other men a little you might be able to find it before me faithful men I think it's commit these things to faithful men I know Paul said it I think it's in Timothy there it is yep go to second Timothy 2 verse 2 second Timothy 2:2 so see you have to be part of a local church that's apostolic most of us know that pretty well but I want to remind you of that the reason people leave many times is because they're Antichrist and how do you know they're against the word when I show them something in the word or you show something in the word they disagree well if it's a major issue that's Antichrist if it's minor it's okay we just have differences we still love when we love everybody even if they got a Anti Christ fear we're supposed to love our enemy sprays God second Timothy 2:2 now let's go to verse 1 because this is Paul's last letter before he dies he gets his head chopped off for the gospel praise God he said thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and these things as I was heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also but the hos age of something struck me right now he said these things that you've heard among many witnesses now for the Jose you didn't know I didn't talk about this but what a bro Graham's son talks about the shark swimming out there was that was that spoken among many witnesses no so people see anyone who have ever had any interaction with brother Branham any little thing he said they make it like this thus saith the Lord but Paul said not everything I said amen but the things that I said amongst many witness in other words the things I said behind the pulpit preaching God's Word amen those things commit to faithful men because they'll teach others the same praise God and now you have people around the world wondering his brother I'm a proper not because look his sons saying this and this and that it hasn't come to pass because they're sharing things that were not thus saith the Lord they're not on tape and they weren't spoken in many witnesses now like this verse 3 I heard Donny Reagan say something verse 3 thou therefore endure hardness as a good shoulder or shoulder or soldier rather of Christ now look at Donny Reagan said brother bang he said he said Paul didn't say become hard he said endure hardness right like we could all get a hard heart I've had people rip my character and say evil things and lie on me but I got to have a soft heart he didn't say become hard he said endure hardness praise God keep your heart soft love your enemies do good to those who persecute you bless those who persecute you rejoice in that day because you know you've got treasures in heaven glory don't become hard but endure hardness oh thank the Lord I love the things of God amen keep somebody Cisse tells these ministers keep somebody who can have confidence and like like a leader for you now not a bishop not like an official leader but just someone a mentor you look up to who can I go to and I've got questions I've got a pastor right now but the Amen he calls me every about every four or five months he's got a doctrinal question he's older than me but I've been pastor longer than him and so he really likes my teaching videos he'll call me and ask me doctrinal questions before he makes a decision and I don't ask him to do that but he kind of looks to me like a leader he's told me that he said he said you're Easton you're kind of like my pastor now he's I'm not because that's Antichrist but sometimes you need someone sometimes you need a mentor some to reach out to people that's a policy teach others the Word of God that things I preach that they can teach others the same thing and endure hardness be a good soldier of Jesus Christ it's going to be hard preaching preach is not an easy thing preaching is a hard thing right you have hardness you have you probably seen it maybe not but from the pulpit I see people's faces all the time and some of them are really hard against me thanks God some of them will shake their heads and walk out and other people leave you know don't like to hear it or rebuke me after service you know I can tell whether little they're liking it right away or not you just got a preacher the hardness praise God and endure it because you got to be a good soldier for Christ and if you don't brother and if you don't see it exactly the way the other preacher does that's all right you're in the faith just move along maybe when we come together all of us will pray the discernment of God will come down and he'll give it just exactly the way it is let us know how to do it and in their churches can go here and training up a group of men and if I'm an evangelistic works somewhere there's places I can place them worldwide so this was wrote as vision I want to train up preachers her brother Neville needs to train up preachers so that when when brother Adam goes on missionary trips he can leave there but then send a faithful pastor to Pastor them that was brother brems vision and so I'm gonna share this with brother Simon too if he maybe he he probably knows it but I'm gonna share with him anyway just so like when he sees people being saved in Thailand we got to pray that God will raise up some pastor there and we prayed for that member we pray for that but if God don't raise one up maybe someone's willing to go and be a pastor and endure hardness and preach and try to save you some little lambs in Thailand let me try to find it because he talks about India he said there was thousands of people saved he said they come out of heathenism then they don't have anybody once he leaves they don't have anybody to teach him God's Word all right now real quick Titus chapter 1 real quick here I'm just kind of I feel like this was more of like a Apostolic sermon today but it's it's absolutely necessary so that you know you and I know how our church is a part of the bigger picture our church is a part of the book of Acts Church we're spreading the same word the same gospel and we got to be constantly enthused and trying to invite people to hear the word of God and spread the word any way we can praise God because that's how God does it now Titus was a Greek he was a full-blooded Greek and member the disciples tried or I'm sorry these false brethren Jews tried to get him to be circumcised and Paul said we wouldn't even listen for one hour we were we wouldn't give them a space for one hour all this these these Jews were trying to to get him back in bondage again and Paul said no they're just trying to make us slaves back to the their in other words they're false Church so Titus wasn't circumcised and and and and these guys were saying he needs to be circumcised and Paul said leave it alone but then the opposite side Paul goes with Timothy amongst Jews and Paul circumcised as Timothy so that the Jews will sit up with him so there has to be a balance there has to be a time to do it you have to ask me a reason to do something like that that's quite a thing they're quite a kind of thing these people were serious in other words Timothy was ready to have a surgery just so somebody could hear the word of God right have a surgery for just for the someone could hear the word of God now there it is verse 5 I she let's go to verse 4 to Titus my own son after the common faith grace mercy and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior look how he dressed the guy that he saved here he said you're my son right now we don't do the Holy Father thing like that but I kind of look to brother Brooks is like a spiritual father I look to brother Craig is a spiritual father they taught me the Word of God my own son after common faith grace mercy peace ok verse 5 for this cause left ID and Crete that thou should have set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as I had appointed thee so Paul says I'm gonna pass on later on I'm gonna go I may go to the grave but Titus you're you're a pastor and you need to ordain pastors in all these different cities so I've done one I've done brother Kim where the Kam's the only one a only pastor I've ordained in another city and so see brother Brooks ordained me here to be a pastor here under the leadership of the Holy Spirit I've tried to be faithful that calling by God's grace so see this is the Apostolic fashion now let me try to find a place to close before we get into this book it's just a beautiful book yeah so buh-bam says right here what if I had young men training the message they said before I leave here like India we're going to set in order these churches I love a man I've already tell grand them they got the money they're on their road right now to take over this a good man he said there's two or three assists young men with them who will be helpers and assistants that's what we need to pray for by the Simon that God will help him to win some souls and then somebody can go over there and just stay there and train them up for the kingdom of God because Jesus said the end will not come until the gospel has been preached to every nation someone has to do it praise God someone has to do it okay now you talked about posting them all over the world now I'm not going to get to all these but brother Branham says keep carrying on he's got to stay enthused about the message gotta have a purpose a target and off to answer for a church he said all the preachers have to answer for the church I have to answer did I keep God's Word or not and then brother Branham was he was he was directing his whole life after that vision to go up and store up food okay let's close here let's just go back to acts 16 let's close with that by God's grace acts 16 let's see how the church started here in Phillipi you're probably familiar with it verse 14 remember the aim or the the vision said come down here come preach to us so verse 14 and a certain woman named Lydia a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira which worshipped God heard us whose heart the Lord opened and that she attended under the things which were spoken of Paul remember where do they find Lydia they found her verse 13 on the Sabbath they're on a Riverside prayer was wont to be made and we sat down to see never stop your prayer life for it never stopped your public services right one of these days somebody's gonna warn her in here someone else is gonna get saved praise God if the Lord is willing we believe that so see someone they just were having prayer and then Lydia God opened her heart to God's Word and so see when got when someone when God opens someone's heart to open their house as well let me say like this now open the checkbook to support the church with tithes and offerings when God opens up someone's heart the rest of their life will become open to what God is doing there praise God this is what God was doing you know it reminded me brother bang of when I was at Akron University and I remember I still remember it very vividly there was I was in a computer lab and I was typing up the water baptism and I was doing clipart brother van pictures of Jesus from the internet and copying and pasting them I had these Bible studies and d'von sat on this side of me I'm saying I'm showing how God did a ministry work in Akron and he looks over and said what clipart is that I said that's Jesus on the cross and I another one of baptism just you know it's a cartoon of a man baptizing a believer he said well he said what is that he said I said that's baptism have you ever been baptized no I said you were in baptized the name of Lord Jesus you know it's an Lord Jesus Christ's baptism and his name Divine's like no I'm like hey man you need to come to my Bible study and the rest is history various God I'm just going back I just went to my house at my post of duty I'm just studying the scriptures I'm trying to win souls and God send somebody directly right next to me that will bring somebody else who believes God's Word just going about the regular duty some people said I should have quit college I'm glad I did it brother bang praise God I'm glad I didn't there's John Graham and Lisa Graham I'm gladiator I'm not sure where she's at by note carries still serving the Lord so you just go over and about the regular post of duty and God will start sending people to the here the Word of God praise God now these people had some great miracles but we don't know all the great miracles right with Lydia her heart just opens to what Paul's saying we're not told of any miracles because remember God don't have to do an outward miracle of a healing God's got to do an inward miracle praise God of a soul that's tired of trying to earn salvation but a soul that will want to find rest in the bosom of Christ amen and so that's what Lydia wanted Linda wanted to find rest for her soul so God opened her heart to hear the word of God and she received it verse 15 and when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us but praise God verse 16 and it came to pass as we went to prayer certain dance damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her master's much game by sue saying the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the Most High God which show unto us the way of salvation and this did she many days but Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he and he came out the same hour let's stand to our feet praise God isn't that encouraging church they just started praying publicly in other words they had public church service God saved one and they just kept going to pray and on the way this woman keeps harassing them and pretty soon he calls out and reduced that spirit in the name of Jesus Christ now pretty soon to cause such a uproar they kicked this guy out of town they don't want any more to do with him because he was driving spirits out and they got real mad about it but see this is how the church started and I'll say like this I've never seen fire over anyone's forehead I wish I would I've never seen the pillar of fire I've never seen a jail have an earthquake and people come out but Jesus Christ himself said blessed are those who believe yet haven't seen thank God amen I don't know if Lidia even saw a miracle but one miracle that happened was her heart wanted to be right with God Almighty praise God amen and God honored her brother Vega as the first convert in all of Europe this cellar was just a little woman who sold purple now they said she made a lot of money she probably helps support the church for years to come that's why she probably that business her business probably paid for the pastor after Paul left her business ties and offerings probably paid for that pastor to live because that was a very lucrative business and they just lived as long as they could miss their musicians if you'll come but amen let me know if you got a song on your heart buddy and sure and let me know if you got a song on your heart you like to sing here now this is more like of a teaching but just to kind of see here I hope you're blessed by the Word of God today I think as as we look if we really want to rest on what Paul preached we've got to know what Paul said and seeing how Paul started these little churches is so encouraging because it's the same thing repeating today just different vessels and then you'll see some of the problems they had like we saw the problems in Galatia legalism the problem in Ephesians you know well they don't have too many problems Paul's had to remind them to keep fighting the good fight of faith with the armor of God but you'll see some of the problems here in the Philippians church disunity people just not being friendly to each other yeah as you'll see Church God did all these miracles he casts out demons out of soothsayers he shook down the prison but yet eleven years later people are arguing about little things in the church and Paul's got to come in and say stop arguing stop worrying about stop bickering about this and this and that let's have the unity of the faith let's keep the gospel going let's let's save more Souls right let's major all the things that are major praise God the love of God the love of Jesus Christ praise God let's bow our heads here we'll have just a general prayer and then I'm gonna bite brother bang to come up here if it's so we can pray and sister who if you want to come up later you can as well just whatever you're comfortable with you know if you want to stand in for your dad as well you both can stand in it's just up to you you know whatever you're comfortable let's just have a word of Prayer as we close the service here father in heaven we love you we thank you for your word this morning father it's just a blessing to see how you started this little church and Lorna as I saw in the video there's no record of that church anymore they have no grave that says here was Lydia the first camera there's no great so the church rose and then it found Lord your spirit moved on to where there was hungry souls but Lord we want to learn lessons from that dear God we want to see ourselves that's just a small little Philippian or Ephesian Church that believes the same thing Paul preached a lord that wants the livet that wants to be purified that wants to obey all of God's Word and wants to see this book of Acts continue through our lives we can trace our spiritual lineage Lord back to Jeffersonville back to the prophet of this hour and we're grateful we're thankful Lord God we want to keep firing shots Lord God we want to stay enthused keep us enthused about your word dear God and I pray you'd save some souls Lord God bring some Souls in Lord for your glory to stir up our church Lord God keep us on fire Lord Jesus battling Satan with the full armor of God Oh bless your people I pray today father I give you all the praise every need be met every heartbeat settled Lord God every heart and peace or done in your presence it all needs be met Lord God before we leave this place thank you Lord for your mercy thank you for this word this holy word you had preserved for us in Jesus Christ's name Amen let me just read one more testimony here we went to a funeral a couple weeks ago remember that we had that sister passed away up north I forgot to share this so brother bill his wife passed away and she's the one that came to our wedding and did all the food and did it just a tremendous serving she's the one that was real merciful to those drunk guys until they repent of their sins well brother man we're in line we're shaking his hand right for the casket and he says brother Jesse sister Kristen I'll never forget when you guys first got saved he said our church was dying spiritually up in Sheffield he said we hadn't we hadn't had anybody saved he said you guys came in bang - he said you guys were on the front row clapping and stomping and praising God he said your presence in the church gave our church revival he said then after you guys went to Lima he told me this right by his dying his dead wife he said after you guys left we're ass on fire we prayed for God to send souls and now their church is bigger than ever bigger than ever so see churches go through seasons highs lows living dying struggling rejoicing let's remain faithful to God let's see what God does let's never we can't lose our enthusiasm we might you know a little bit but let's get
