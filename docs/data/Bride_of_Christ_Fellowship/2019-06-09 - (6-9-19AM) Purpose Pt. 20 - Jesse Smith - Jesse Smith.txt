morning by God's grace please ask these chapter 3 verse 1 to 5 no one read Genesis chapter 1 just please yeah see chapter 3 can you do me a favor Malachi can you get the mic on there I forgot it I just forgot to put it on today please a see chapter three verses one to five then we'll go to Genesis chapter 1 verses 14 through 16 thank you please ask these three verse 1 everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven that means right now there's some season you're in right now and and God has a purpose for it right now here in June of 2019 God has a season that you're in right now and a purpose for this season as well so no one can leave out of here and say well there's no reason for me to go to church today there's no purpose for me to be alive right now that's not true there is a purpose and as with everything else we have to humble ourselves in order to see that purpose right because man is often exalted and full of pride and the way to draw near to God is to abase yourself right humble yourself and then God will draw nigh to you verse 2 a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh time to mourn and a time to dance verse 5 a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing let's go to Genesis chapter 1 verse 14 Lord willing before we get to these seasons I like to just look at the the moon and the number 28 just for a few minutes before we get to sees that we've been up here Genesis 1:14 and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so that's all read verse 16 together one two three and God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also let's have one more word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto God Heavenly Father our hearts are unified just as our voices there were unified together so our hearts unified on you Lord God we have one hope we have one God we have one faith we have one Lord we have one baptism Lord we're unified today under the banner of Christianity the baptism of the Holy Ghost the one message of the our Lord the restoration message that you've set in this day we're so grateful Lord God and father help us to come under the unity of the Spirit right now how your spirits dealing with this Lord may we see your purpose Lord and every time and season Lord and and know that every season is crucial and important Lord God and father to know that you're in control Lord and you've ordained times seasons for your glory so father help us today Lord to getting the the spirit Lord God Lord to yield to your Holy Spirit help us to humble ourselves Lord God working in our lives and we'll give you all the glory for we know there's a purpose for this service in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless use me to see the praise the Lord so we like to look to the scripture here and I do have a few slides here Lydia Lord willing to show and so we want to look to the Word of God this morning and I know to bless you here by the God's grace like I said I want to start with these you know kind of a few thoughts here so I don't want it dropped just a few a few thoughts about the 28 here so we're looking at part 20 here and we read our text and you know it was really striking as I've been staying on this thought it's really quite striking to see how inspired this is and even to even this morning it was opening up a little more to me to understanding these seasons why would God anoint Solomon 3,000 years ago to write 14 different seasons that have you know opposite actions and actions making for a total of 28 God anoint a man like that the wisest man of all outside of Christ as far as we know the gift of wisdom for the Old Testament remember there was none born greater than John the Baptist so John was somehow greater than Solomon although Solomon's very wise John the Baptist was greater because he got to handle the Messiah praise God the Solomon never got to that he beheld him twice in visions but he never got to handle him but John got to handle the Word made flesh and so it's been just a bit a little inspired you know to begin reading these things and and to see how church how this relates to us so just take a look at these and you know I'll say like this I believe you and I are in one of these seasons right now and remember there's both Nat and they're spiritual for example you know we'll get to a little later but there's a natural season to be born and to die but there's also spiritual season to die out to everything finish sanctification and be born again in the Holy Ghost there there's a natural season and a spiritual season for all these and Lord willing today we'll get to I think Lord willing we'll get to seven and eight today and then maybe tonight we'll see what the Lord has but it's a it's very striking and inspired but I want to take a few moments to look at the number 28 now when I preach the numerology series I'm not done with that quite yet but I didn't have any numbers for 28 as far as in the scripture so but as I studied these things and studying that number 28 here with 28 seasons this would be our first number 28 but really 28 means month right now 30 can be a month as well you know in Judah and the Jews a prophetic timeline but God has connected 28 to a cycle as well right which two main cycles that we know are in 28 which is the cycle of the moon's phases and then a woman's cycle to bring forth life is in 28 28 days in a cycle and so God has placed this this this particular season or cycle in 28 God has done that church and and man can't alter as much as they want to try to alter it man can't alter it these things just keep going over and over and over and as God said what are they for why does the moon just keep going over and over it's four times and four seasons and to speak to us amen all these seasons are to speak something to us in other words one great lesson it speaks to us is that God is sovereign and God has chosen the season God has ordained the season and you could have hope you can have grace and faith you can have confidence that God is in control amen that's one great thing God wants that work in our lives is confidence in his word his trust in his word Amen faith in his word and confidence in him that no matter what happens God is in control praise the Lord so we don't know so we don't fear you know spheres a great paralyzing spirit right and it'll make us so afraid that we'll be afraid to do anything because we don't know is God with me or is God helping me does God know what's going on has God left me and it paralyzes your faith but when the spirit of love comes it frees you from that and they're there and then then you have a sound again amen because it's the power of love and of a sound mind amen but Satan wants to paralyze it and get your mind all fluctuating between belief and unbelief and once they're trying to get you discouraged and and what to try to get you tossed about in the storms of life but God's Spirit of love is here this morning ain't it and it's here to help you it's here to help me it's here to help us to have love power and a sound mind now weakness but power in the Holy Spirit praise God now just another I want to just I just found this inspiring from Matthew Henry's commentary the proof and illustration of it by the induction of particulars 28 in number according to the days of the moon's revolution now he's Matthew Henry is commenting on Solomon in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 which the moon's revolution is always increasing or decreasing amen well they have said you cannot leave the service the same way that you came amen you're either gonna increase or decrease and if we're honest it both of us both of them happen to us some services we take we take more parsley and all my literally get some from God and other services we take a little lightly and we don't actually leave out of there better Christian and I'm gonna prove it too it's prescription I mean it has to be because of what happens in our lives now the Bible said I'm sorry here he says which is always increasing or decreasing between its full and change so it's constantly increasing constantly decreasing the move some of these changes are purely the act of God others depend more upon the will of man but are all determined by the divine counsel praise God see God lets you have your free agency and things and some things you can kind of make happen like we see that with Sarah you know introducing Hagar right she kind of makes this happen she got into brings forth this she does it by her own will right but yet God allowed it in the whole scheme of things in order to magnify the power of the promised Amen God allowed her to have the will of man the will of Sarah the will of Abraham God allowed that but those mistakes only magnify the glory of obedience amen hallelujah and you got to have both seasons you got to have a season of in your life you have to have a season where you tried to work the will of God or you try to do America and it didn't really happen and going through that will allow you to experience the joy of waiting upon the Lord and the Lord vindicating your prayer and God doing a great miracle amen where you had no part of it when one side you had you tried to do it at faith it was miserable a miserable season but then the glory of the other season teaches you to rejoice and it helps you to grow as a Christian a men everything under heaven is thus changeable but in heaven there's an unchangeable state and an unchangeable Council concerning these things now I just want to show you a little visual here I recorded this in slow-mo it starts off it starts off slow but then it speeds up okay so this is constantly in church we see this day after day week after week month after month and year after year and it's just constantly going over again and it's always increasing right always always increasing or decreasing it's we know there's either waxing or waning right and sometimes I say like this but I'm in our churches waxing greater right right sister Karen sometimes the church is just waxing my our strength our face seems to be growing at other times it seems like we're just in a little hard season we're not as strong as we used to be all I remember what last fall mom we were so on fire last whit last summer we are so last winter we were so on fire right and we long for those days we long for those days but church the reality and the glory of it is that we know our God works in seasons and we know I always still are saith the Lord amen although in this light fades and it wanes we know at some point not not on it's gonna return by God's grace amen it has to because God works according to season amen he works that way Jesus are the same thing jesus said the Holy Spirit you don't know when it's coming but it's like a win and it blows it blows and you have to be ready when it comes well anyone that ever studied winds know that there's all these cycles and pass around the world and there's certain circuits of wind and it always goes on these circuits so they they know like at school every may we have the fire department come and they bring one of their RVs and they have what's called a tornado house because that's the season for tornadoes it doesn't really shock anybody you know in May or June when we have a tornado because that's the season for tornadoes right and so it is with us we can sense we should be able to sense in our hearts a season where the winds going to blow Amen are with me we should be able to sense it we should we should look around and see one another burning in prayer I fervently pray worshiping it holding over the Word of God we should be able to sense that something's going to happen because we can feel the winds of the Holy Spirit amen we can feel it pick it up hallelujah just like we can see the light increasing it's being brighter it's getting brighter amen hallelujah now there's two ways to apply this moonface you can apply it to the church age if you apply to the church age the best thing to do is listen to restoration of the bride tree because program tells you there's four stages to the moon because he said there's four stages to restore the light of the church there's four stages the first second third and fourth brother have said the first stage is Luther praise God the second stage is Wesley the third stage is Azusa and this is the last stage amen learn the shining light the brightest age for the moon praise God let me say like this we're not losing light we're gaining I Amen we're talking about the bride around the world is not losing revelation she's growing in Revelation amen hallelujah brother man calls it the fourth light looking up respirations ride the fourth light because there's four phases and that's what we can grow in and that's where we rejoice and we know the longer were here the more revelation of God the more the Lord that is going to be enlightened to us amen the more a brother Aaron is going to shine upon us because it's it's a type it's a season the Alpha must become Omega amen brother Brahim said thus saith the Lord I will restore the fullness of Pentecost we'll be in the bride amen it has to because it's ordained by God it's a side event of the time and season of the rapture amen our us be church now that's the part we love that's the part we can shouting club and rejoice about but the hard part is that our lives just so our lives go through that fourfold face all the time right that's right church that's why Solomon wrote 28 seasons here because every person is going to go through these cycles right and so you know we see that and whether you know like like garnet peak in 1964 he died at 16 years old and yet brother Ram said he served God's purpose for his life yet we know by the end of his life when God takes him who took him off the seat or when God takes you off the scene will be shining in the brightness of his glory are you with me we will end right because the precious and the cyber Lord is the death of his Saints praise God we know whenever when God took brother branham in 1965 at 56 years old he was the shining light he left this earth shining in the glory of the manifestation of Christ in his life he was reflecting the fullness of the light of Christ right there at his time as death wasn't Steven the Oh Lord Steven was so bright that the light was shining his face like an angel and he was shining like a moon in the brightness and the bonus of his life hallelujah amen Paul was so shining at the end he said I know there's a crowd waiting for me and I'll receive it at that day I'm ready to be offered I fought the good fight I've learned the course he's run the course of the manifestations of the light in his life amen he fully reflected all of Christ and so when he went to the grave he there's burning as a full moon amen oh thank you Lord he fulfilled the purpose of God for his life so does that help by God's grace we see this over and over I'm sure brother William seen it in his church you know people be on fire for a while they'll cool off then they'll be on fire again amen I'm sure your pastor sometimes is really on fire another disease just pressing all right we say just keep pressing how you doing and you know when someone's going down how you doing we're just pressing the mass other times you don't even have to ask how you doing Jose because the light of God is shining and glowing and you're coming to church and you're so on fire hi ladies the Lord your desk how they're doing you can see the light shading on them other times they're so down in the scourge other times are they coming to church or not yeah I understand that's it's the cycles of the moon amen and just because someone's just because the moon goes in the dark cycle doesn't mean it's not the moon just because you go through outside doesn't mean you're not the broad Amen the moon the form of God will shine upon you again amen because you keep hanging in your position a man ha ha you can hang in there and you get under the influence of the sand the Sun Jesus Christ god help us to stay in our position help us not to lose leave our position we see we've got to stay in our position and in the time and season that light will magnify itself upon us it's not us producing the light it's the light of Christ hallelujah so see this just opened up to me this morning well now I can see it now all these I'm gonna go back now all these are seasons there's 28 days in a lunar cycle and Solomon wrote 28 different seasons is that a coincidence and yet we can look at all all these and we can say yes I've had this in my life now there's a physical meaning and then there's of course a spiritual meaning as well and we've already gone through he preached these six we preached those six and today we look at seven and eight but just as the moon goes through these phases and it's broken down we know in 28 days you know so you and I go through these as well now I'm gonna skip ahead because I already showed that slide now let's go back here to Genesis 1 God said let there be four lights let there be lights in the firmament that heaven to divide the day from the night let them for signs and for seasons and for days and for years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also now let's look at a few I got a few quotes in scriptures here I just was looking at some of the scriptures look at look at Psalms 148 3 praise him ye Sun and Moon praise him all ye stars of light is there ever a time when the moon doesn't praise God no it praises God because it stays there and stays in position brother a minute sometimes it's a lot brighter than other times right sister Brenda sometimes the light is but all the time it's praising God by staying in its place amen God wants you to stay in your place amen in your local church stay right where God placed you little sheep amen stay right there stay where God place you if God's called you to a gift of miracles stay right there if God's going to gift a wisdom stay right there if he's giving you a gift of faith stay right there stay right there and then God's season his light will shine upon you and while you're waiting just praise Him amen just come to church to say thank you Jesus the moon praise God they got them somewhere your economy amen praise Him it says praise him to come to church praise him in the good times for they ain't men sings your favorite songs say glory if he doesn't sing your favorite song say praise the Lord is that right praise them the moon is the praise in the Bible said and notice your to rule the night the moon rules the night now we have some quotes on this will show here with brother Branham in just a moment why don't I see maybe I'll skip ahead and then come back yeah let me skip ahead then I'll just come back in the beginning he says God he said oh how we could base this back if God was willing and we had time of the Sun went down at night God provided a moon to give a lesser light now the moon and the Sun are perfectly husband and wife husband and wife the moon and the Sun our husband not the earth the moon and the Sun so the moon revolves around the earth but that's the earth and the moon are now husband and wife right and our lives revolve around this earth but it's not who were married to our job is to shine the light to the rest of the world amen that's our job but the a man and sister who are sometimes as I got their people from the earth people from worldly churches look out there and say my a minute who are so far out there but they're shining the light of God amen they can't deny the light that you're shining out there and it looks like you're married to the earth but you're not you're only here to shine the light to be a city on a hill a moon up in the sky that cannot be hidden amen but you're really married to the Sun I love the Lord don't you and when the sun goes down he says it goes way behind the world and reflects its light over the moon the moon gives a lesser light by night but just as Jesus when he was here on earth he went away went back up into the heavens and reflects back the Holy Ghost on the church which is the light in his place today perfectly so not you get it but him said when Jesus was here he was shining the light but Jesus has left so it's no longer daytime he said now it's nighttime and now in the absence of the Sun we reflect the light to this earth so what time is it spiritually it's nighttime there's about to be a new daybreak a man but my idea of the seventh day amen it's about the bread but it's nighttime right now and you and I are the only days the Bride of Christ around the world in Ghana wherever we are in there in Akron what were we are we are the light to the world amen in the absence of Christ now notice this is important Church where's that word lesser a lot of people say you know Jesus said greater miracles will you need a brother man had to correct him it's not greater it means more I've heard so many preachers even in the message another say oh we're do greater works and how can you do greater than creation creation is the greatest thing you could do because when God made Satan he made him everything except creator right and he can never create the only one that can Korea is God creative power that's God apart from everybody else amen so you cannot do greater than Christ that doesn't mean we'll do greater miracles it means we do more miracles amen you'll never do greater than Christ because he was the son but moons light will never be greater than the sun's light because the moon doesn't produce a lot it just reflects the it borrows the light amen but Jesus is the light he is hallelujah he's the birding eternal light of God hallelujah and we just burn off for a while amen see so we got to be careful and remember we're less than him and now let me go back just a few because the Bible says plainly a lot of people worship the moon right and he has gone and served other gods and worship them either the Sun or the moon or any of the hosts of it which I'm not coming in got it and tell them all the way back there don't you worship the moon it's so beautiful it has such a glory to it it's such a beautiful light but don't worship it don't worship it and so the Bible says the way that happens mostly is the Bible said we make our belly our God so we you would think why never worship brother Jose I never I would never bow down I never bow down to worship brother man I would never do that with the that might be true but what we gotta be careful of is worshipping ourselves because all we see all these preachers now it's easy to see him preachers but it's it's easy to seeing other people too but what they do is they sell out the gospel for a meal ticket right and what are they doing like my brother Simon got the witness a pastor and shortened the baptism he saw the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and not far the Father Son Holy Ghost and he said I would believe it and preach it except my retirement is in this denomination and Simon set right there and told him now Church I'm not wishing judgment on this man you know we cry out for mercy the bride cries out for mercy Father forgive them they don't know what they do but if that's not repented of them then there's consequences because that's a form of idolatry you're worshiping your food more than worshiping your spiritual food they vent you worship in your church denomination more than you're worshiping the God of Mormon amen and so we we've got to be careful too that we don't worship the moon in other words Paul says oh one of you like the Pylos more than Peter and some of you thought well I'm better Paul was a better preacher than other ones now with us a lot of times that manifests in preacher worship grace God well we think oh if this preacher comes we're going to have a revival but we know there have said no preacher brings revival in his briefcase or on his iPad the the only way the revival comes is when we're praying in our homes that's the boat rev says he said you have to create the revival in your home Amen but see we go into the idea like whoa revival can only come when when this sister prays for me or that brother braid but that's that's a human worship and we must remember not to worship an individual we must be a little which tools God is going to use but we must not give them worship because that's a great danger today we worship ourselves or he worship other of God's people and that's moon worship my he said but remember the moon don't give any light at all for the Jose I have no light to give to you of myself this morning the moon does it is still there's sunlight on the moon amen that's what this today it's not the church is the Holy Ghost on the church that does it not the church amen so what we have special meetings or you go to special meetings or we have a special meeting right here in our church which give me every Sunday I like to like to be an advocate for that that's my ministry but whenever anything good happen Church it wasn't because of us it was because of the Lord amen Christ visit us he shined a bonus in his mercy in his love and it was the season for an amen all we did sister Wendy was just hanging around to the right season came and God said this is the season where you get a little more light it's gonna roll along pretty soon just just stay right down your seat Church don't run around me is going to and for to around the earth is you know it's a famine for the Word of God and see that's why they all get running to and fro if they would just stay in their position God would meet them in the humility a better position amen Baudelaire says if one little planet got out of order it would throw off the whole system and that's true you can ask any Christian scientists they're all over YouTube if one if one if the earth or Moon moves like half a degree it would throw everything off God's got everything placed and in that in the spiritual that's how Christians are we have to be right in our position we can't move out of place and try to venture a presume into something we wait until the light shines and then if we know it's Christ showing up it's not the church it's the Holy Ghost on the church amen oh it's not me it's not you it's the Holy Ghost on you and I that's God's provide away see not to see we can have a million more at forty four so see program gives us an idea of worshiping the moon oh let's get a million let's get a million more members in 1954 see that that's a man way to exalt the church look what we did I look in that so sad they're bragging we're gonna get a million converts in one year look at us we got a million Congress and that's so sad but that's the moon kind of bragging on it that's the moon bragging on itself and that's when the light is waning right that's when the that's when the light is leaving the church that's something you do you magnify yourself that's when the light goes that is it our slogan if God will add daily to the church such as will be saved until that's what the church needs today that's what we need today that's what we need to get back in God's Way in other words we wait in our position until God adds to the church and if we feel led to go bring somebody in then that's God's leading to add to the church but we don't sign a manmade slogan say we're going to save 10 Souls this year we're gonna save a million souls you don't sign a man-made thing now it's different if you got none saith the Lord but if you got those say the Lord it'll speak it don't say at the Lord but if not you wait upon the Lord wait - the light shines and pretty soon it will Adams and there'll be the holy spirit adding to the church the wisdom of God the moon the Sun is husband with wife this is a different sermon 1954 and one of the Sun has gone away it throws its light against the moon to give us a smaller light until the Sun comes so we got a smaller light right we got the amounting but it's smaller than Jesus because Jesus had the fullness of the Godhead bodily and when the Sun comes the moon fades out I love look at this beautiful mister beautiful and crisis the sinners gone to glory and shining on the church with the same kind of light he shined when he was here and the church is the light of the world until Jesus comes and it all melts together this is a beautiful type like the moonlight and the sunlight becomes one light when it merges together amen how do you ever see that in the morning you're driving and the sun's coming up but yet the moon's shining real bright right there oh one of these days brother after the Armageddon there's going to come a mill together of the two lights the sunlight and the moonlight and the Bible calls at the Millennium amen amen and the lights will come together he says becomes one light when it emerges together when Christ the church comes together at that great millennium they merge into one light thank the Lord amen this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine I'm gonna let it shine till Jesus comes this little light of mine and when Jesus comes this little light of mine is gonna fade into all your lights and we're all gonna be one light the light of eternal life what a beautiful tight brother Brahim gives us there my how striking it is he said today we are the light of the world in his presence in his absence rather he's given you the light to shine with while he's here while he's here now I think I cover that yeah let me see all right so let's go next one now let's get a few moon statistics now this is where it starts breaking into the woman's cycle which is just interesting I don't really have a lot on that as far as I'm aware of but it says the moon solar day is about not fully 29 days now science has just learned that it's not exactly 29 days but it's 28 and some change but when these commentaries wrote it when they didn't have all these science instruments they just looked up this 28 days because they did the best they could they couldn't measure you know with atomic clocks and atomic watches and all the instruments that they have today so for these thousand years they've always thought it's 28 days but now science can track it down it's almost 29 the month is based on the lunation that period of which the moon completes a cycle of its phases the period lasts approximately 29 and a half days and is easy to recognize and short enough for the days to be counted without using large numbers in addition it's very close to the average menstrual period of women and also to the duration of cyclic behavior and submarine creatures so not only in the earth but under the earth the Seas so god uses this twenty-eight to govern the sky the land and the sea hey man my mercy thus the moon possess great significance and was often the governing period for religious observances of which the dating of Easter is a notable example they would have a month-long celebration at Easter or they'd have month-long celebrations here our month-long celebrations there they base that upon the seasons the length of season of the moon because they saw it going from brightness to Darkness brightness the darkness and that represented hope amen that's what the season represents according to this there's this article right here it represents hope look what it says next menstruation has therefore been described as the outward evidence now this is from the Britannica of the abortive clothes of one cycle and the hopeful commencement of the next aim ahead so 28 cycle so see we're seeing cycles of hope right now you can also look at cycles of death and brother here no cycles of death and revival does he not in the church age book so it's at that part can also be encouraging to we leave that season of death and we know new life comes amen it's a cycle of death and a cycle of Hope and God is implanted in the woman brother amen not the man because the church is like into a woman a man and the woman is the one who brings forth life all right God's design is powerful my goodness they have a human menstrual cycle he says this I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't read that I'm sorry here yeah here's the quote it cycles of hope there's a Britannic online code so represents hope new life praise God now it says wikipedia says it's the average cyclist 28 days no link has been established to the night lighting of the moon now as far as they know right but we know God has 28 seasons that are linked to the bride praise God and each of the cycles the moon cycle the woman's cycle lets everyone know that the bride is in cycle with Christ amen Olivia that's right now I want to lay a few things in here because we all go through seasons and so God sends a pastor to watch over your soul and that watch means to be sleepless keep awake watch on isn't that perfect the pastors and ministers have to stay awake all night because it's nighttime well everybody sleeps pastor will stay up watching now I don't say up all night if I did I'd bout die spiritually the God that God has to annoy a pastor let me say like this he can stay up a little longer can I just say like that did because he asked me it would be sleepless which I'm not I gotta have my 7 hours or I'm about done and keep awake and watch for your souls right he's got to be able to watch it so God has to give him space but not only a pastor the Bible said that Cain was had the evil spirit because he was not his brother's keeper okay so not only you don't do preachers have to watch and watch how everybody's you know in the season that they're in the Bible says now this is the scripture let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering he's faithful the promise let us consider one another to provoke them under loading it works the next scriptures gather gather more she's healing the approaching church attendance so in the context of this God's people are going to be able to watch over each other more as they come to church and when we come we come and we come thinking about someone else now we come to give God glory to shine a light and to praise Him but part of praising him is being concerned about everyone else let us consider one another to provoke that means to inspire or stir up one another to love and good works so in that beautiful sometimes you know we know I'll come to church and maybe I'm shining the light of God and it's encouraging you it's inspiring you brother Aaron are walking here and he's worshiping God and it'll stir you up and inspire you for the Amen was singing and crying worship or Malachi will pluck and play and he'll seek and it'll inspire you that's what the Bible said see we come in church and we know we have a dual responsibility I threaten the threefold responsibility our responsibility to come here for God for ourselves and to everyone else amen so when I come to church believe I'm not just coming for me I am coming for me but I'm coming to praise God and I'm coming to inspire and stir others up to encourage them that their time in season will return ma it will just stay right there just stay right in position but light of God we're returning but you have to stay in position because Cain was a wandering star the Bible said wondered from place that he's like a shooting star we kickin it he can stay in position but you must stay in position and shine the light of God see that does that help hope that helps by God's grace now brother Branham notices at the end of his life he saw brothers out in the desert drying spiritually and it concerned him he said I know each one of you you feel like I do I'm so hungry to see the spear of God movie I just can't hardly stand it some experiences I just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that was when I was first saying was so glorious in my heart amen church what he's talking what is he talking about he's talking about the marriage in divorce the last time he was up there if you go back was when he got the revelation on the marriage of divorcing him hey folks about God coming down the mountain they stopped school to come out and see it they have people on the gas station rounds up there a year before then he got the king shore he's talking about experiences up in the mountain everybody so here he is in 63 and 64 he's 54 and 55 years old and God makes him feel like when he was first Saved amen God let him go through a season where he comes back with a winner and he just don't feel like he's got a little light he feels like he's full bloom he's fully shining he's fully declaring the glory of God amen hey thank the Lord at 54 and 55 years old if he just stays in position never saying try to get him out of position say move up in those and just you steal away from everybody they don't hear your preaching just get away okay I was about ready to do that Saint was about ready to get him out of position but God's grace intervene while he's driving a car oh my god speak to us where we're driving our cars today when we're in a restaurant today god help us and keep us in our position how he's coming back here he's old dating Peregrine and he's saying oh I just feel that like I first got saved so he's experienced up in the mountain it was so glorious to my heart and we come to a place we can sit and see it among us that we are drying sober I'm see now he's gonna tell us he's watching he watches people's lives to see if they're getting a wetter or drier that's what I do to you it's what you do to me right is he getting wet with the things of God or as you're drying out it won't praise God anymore well let's all say glory to God that's all trying to clap come on church can we clap oh I'm a hand sir you know see we should be able to tell are we getting more wet more free or getting more dry on Christ let's be Wed amen let the showers of God poured out to one of the seats that we've early met we just heard the banjos lasting brother Diggs walk into a hospital appointment and they say look it says diabetes and says he says no I don't and God heard the prayer and God changed on the taps Amen we just heard that so let's be encouraged and say Lord at that same rate follow me this weekend be with me this week so I can not dry out but I can stay moist I can stay under the showers of the Holy Spirit let's read let's remind ourselves of what we heard let's remember what we heard that we can shine the light of God and as we sit here in the desert I get among my brother another they talk with me and I talk with them always now look look my dad was always in a way watching feeling out with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong so but I would go and talk and say god Bless You Jose and if they get talking pretty soon the whole time for the Rams watching him getting closer to God that's what he says I'm watching this to see the condition of that brother to see what's wrong they met how you done sir now you understand of course the auditions yeah but you and I have to get to the Surma - you know there's been people recently you know where my wife's been down they've broken my wife a nice encouraging car that we really meant a lot to her sometimes God will anoint you to discern someone and try to encourage them in the Lord I mean know what I'm talking about one of the brothers recently sent me a text I was down in the dumps with you know mine battles he said I just read your book from start to finish he said brother that was powerful he said God is truly using you more you know I said of a back a text I said that was exactly what I needed I was so down in the dumps and now I'm on courage they God will anoint people just to encourage you when we're drying he'll send a little water your way yeah battery switch the batteries yeah I can do that that's another thing I like to do while preaching I can switch the babies now look at rotor and Sadie they're drying out Church look at that hope you can see that he was watching the seasons of people's lives okay that says I begin to feel all us a reclining look at this reclining decreasing just like the moon yeah are they not bright does he condemn them brother Perry's churches say you'll never have a revival sister Karen was there did you have revival at the church let's say praise the Lord so I'm in 65 they were reclining but when sister Karen was there there was years in the 80s 90s and the early 2000s where the God sent an increase amen amen an incline not a decline and in trot see God goes through seasons the thing to do is don't be critical stay in your position and wait for God's light to shine back on you amen praise God I begin to see reclining getting away from the what what Perry greens church getting away from the spirit now he might not even be talking about the church but he's talking about brothers out there in Arizona I'm not sure I mean it's hard to read into this one but he was talking to brothers and he go tried to discern them and say are you getting closer to God you getting drier are you getting more moist and they're striking it's become too natural thing to us see churches becomes that's just church time great I'll just go to church and instead something else becomes greater like my golf game oh I can't wait I'll get up at 6 a.m. to go get my golf game on now I don't golf but I'm not condemning golf it's just like Taekwondo or whatever anything that takes the place of God's an idol yep yep oh damn said God gave me a sport where I can glorify God in it look up those words God gave me a sport but man said which was hunting so they were getting away we must worship in the spirit not only our message to be the flame of the ours should be the flame in our hearts so the problem is with our hearts and that has to be our minds not our soul because if you've got to seal the Holy Ghost you're sealed to the day of your redemption in your soul your souls not fluctuating your souls a concept burning fire galavant hallelujah with your human spirit that fluctuates decrease increase decrease in ink sometimes like thinking about God other times I'd rather do other things sometimes and I'm back in the back and just like the moon but just like they're moving back and forth back and forth back and forth it's got to be in our hearts we can't rightly present to the people the Spirit has to pack the message yourself and I'm trusting and believing and every one of you to be a real Christian now I'm just gonna give a few brief examples because I know I'm let me said timer give me 15 more minutes now I just want to say a few examples here let me go the next slide okay yeah yeah this is perfect glory John 16:13 hobby it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you in all truth humming no program said this is the evidence of the Holy Ghost let me know that this is in the church age book guiding you into all the truth or the revealed word of your day is the evidence of the Holy Ghost now speaking in tongues not shaking a hand not anything else not any miracle but you receiving more and more of the word for he shall not speak of himself what's every show here that same shall he speak and he'll show you things to come he shall glorify me so the Holy Ghost would cause you to glorify the high priest for each to receive a mind and showed unto you so I just thought of a few examples you can be a born again moon bride member and go through seasons where you decrease in your growth with God that's true I got I got two examples you know the easiest one to see is in Galatians 2 we probably well let's just go there anyway I'll just give you one example with with Peter Peter you know bless his heart people call him custom preacher he sings like that but that's all before the Holy Ghost amen he's a real soldier and you know I'll say this I'm not half I'm not a tenth of the man he is or maybe in a hundred the man he was but let's see glaciers - this guy got so into the the season of decrease can I say like that he got into such a season of decrease that he wouldn't even eat with the Gentiles can you imagine sister Karen or sister Brenda going to church fellowship and you won't even sit at the same table somebody in here could you imagine that like you and even you'd say no I'm not sitting with Jose today Jose said hey guys come sit at the table no you got your own table over there it's the glasses table go sit with the guys with glasses like brother Jesse yeah whatever whatever reason you know they would give to discriminate but Peter was decreasing in the things of God because he got a spirit of discrimination on him I'm not sure which one maybe pride might be it's probably pride because want to be a lust it probably a pride toe Galatians 2 you know the scripture let's just jump ahead there verse 11 places to 11 and when Peter was come to a neck I was send to the face because he was to be blamed Wow a Holy Ghost filled preacher at the same time God's guiding in the minutes Ruth now in this case how is God guiding him in truth he's sending somebody to correct him amen praise God how does God you got his dad got you and me and it's Ruth there's times we have to be corrected amen it didn't make him not the moon by the way he was still the moon he was still the spokesman on the day of Pentecost glory he's still preaching 3,000 souls got baptized on the day of Pentecost glory he's still a man that won't throw water he's still the man that he would just pass and his shadow where's my shadow must be right under me well there it is it's kind of on Wendy there so this channel hood crossover Wendy and he be and she be healed that's the kind of man this was but yet he was a moon member to and his life went through seasons of difficulty too and he was the very man brother amen and went up there in the corneas his house corneas bouncing oh oh you've come I come to wish me he said get up man don't do that I'm just a man like you God's not a respecter of persons and God sent Jesus and I said the Holy Ghost and while Peter spake on the house the Holy Ghost fell on them their herd to learn hey Cornelius a Gentile some were rejoicing speaking of dogs barbicide glorified they're the same man they saw the Holy Ghost fallen Gentiles pretty soon said I don't even want to eat with you brother amen the same man why church because he goes through seasons he's constantly increasing or he's constantly decreasing may God help our seasons of decrease to be shorter I know how he does that but he can do that he's God verse 12 for before that certain came from James he didn't eat with the Gentiles that when they were come he would ruin separate himself fearing them which were of the circumcision so be kinda like this it'd be like if we had brother Diggs here last week and I and I and I knew brother Diggs was here and before when both Diggs was in here I could eat with Amen all the time we'd fellowship you know but when beau Diggs came oh well I'm not gonna eat with Amen because I told brother dig some things about Amen everybody a man's like why won't you sit with me why don't you talk with me well you all need to shake my hand and that's what a Holy Ghost filled preacher was doing Church can you imagine it a Holy Ghost filled preacher one week he'd sit there and say praise the Lord thank you let's feast together you're not unclean you're clean we all say it but then when a guest preachers come I can't eat with you let's come over here let's see let's all you over here at our table we're not gonna eat over there a Holy Ghost fill man say brother just do Christians decrease yeah we're at right here right here I hear in their minds not your soul the Bible never says your resealed to the day of your dungeon there's not two baptisms the Holy Ghost there's only one baptism of the Holy Ghost if you want to refilling of the Holy Ghost that's right here in your mind because you can't get a refilling in your soul because it's sealed until it's sealed until it's the downpayment until the rest of the payment comes with the new body amen when you say I want to refill your Holy Ghost what you mean is you want your attitudes your desires and all your thoughts clean out by the Holy Ghost scrub down real hard with one of those art brushes and then pour it in and fill with the line of the Holy Ghost amen so you think the right way you act the right way you start saying the right things because you got a born-again experience now in your mind not your soul there you will not find the scripture to be resealed in the soul that's what you're asking for and Jesus told the fusion church how to do it he said if you want your first love go do your first works at Toledo I might have told you this I had a young mother I saw her with the kids church before the service she walked her little family in there so you know her husband was there she walked a little family there from Sunday school taking care of all these kids and she comes up crying the officer she said brother Jessie I just want to be refilled with the Holy Ghost I thought my goodness and you know I was kind of tempted to try and think of something big right though that's the Holy Spirit just brought that little thought there about the first love I said sister I wasn't trying you know don't give your children attention I said you're gonna give your children the same amount of attention but now it's all going to be in love and your mind is going to be off anything outside the word it's just gonna be on your husband your home and your children and think of and I said think about what you did when you first got the Holy Ghost she went like this is our thinking and then she smiled at me and I said you go do those first works and God will fill you with a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen and she you know she was crying worshiping their praise the Lord a man she can't neglect her children and say she's got a new born again experience she can't neglect her husband and say well born again I got a refill Eagle O'Neal she can't do that she's got to keep on all of the previous works she has to keep all the responsibilities of God but she does it with a new desire and more thoughts my god she does it with the heart of love she's won the battlefield of the mind and now her mind she's no longer feeling guilty well I just can't do nothing I've always got to watch after my children I always got to wash the clothes you know all those guilty thoughts Satan throws in the women's minds but that's wrong that's what God called them to do praise God and they can do it they just need to return what was my first worst what was my attitude what were my words like when I first got married when I had my first child when I received my first child my second child I was so thankful so happy returned and knew those works in abroad and prepared and the light of God will increase on your life amen amen see Peter never stopped being guided in the truth he was still in that pattern but he had to endure the decreasing of light and the increasing of light in that striking look at verse 13 and other Jews dissembled likewise with him so Peter wasn't just it wasn't just Peter well everybody else will fellowship with amen just not Peter no Peter was saying hey Wendy Jason Jose everybody just leave brother amen just come over here let's all work let's all eat with the preacher the Jewish preacher over here he was influencing people in the local church he was basically starting a the preliminaries of a church split but thank God God sent a man full of truth in there God said Paul said Peter you're the bishop you're to be blamed and we know by history he got straightened out right because he's a faithful down to the end so much so he's been crucified upside down nah look at verse 14 but when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel I send my Peter before them all the before them all now how many of you love God so much how many of you trust God and preachers so much that you wouldn't mind if a preacher came up here and got under the anointing and called you out in front of everybody how many of you love God that you'd say well praise the Lord if that's the I will let thy will be done I want to be open to that right because Paul did it in front of everybody if thou being a jew live us after the manner of the gentiles and do not as the jews why compels tell the gentiles to live as the jews why are you trying to get the jews to live like Gentiles and why you we're all one Paul says we're all one in Christ Jesus we're all one and if people have their liberties like their holy days or their third their veggies vegetarian diets the Bible said in all those things just give thanks let them have their difference but don't separate fellowship don't don't discriminate and don't make two different camps we're all one body we're all one family let me I got three minutes here let me close here praise the Lord in that good church and that good the other one we don't know we don't see a lot of this but let's go to Roman's 6 Paul is such an amazing character in the Bible and I'm not exalting him I'm just thanking the Lord for him I'm thinking the Lord that God allowed us to see so much of his life Romans chapter 6 now I'd like to go I'm sorry it's Romans chapter 7 Church I'm sorry verse 10 now these are from err scriptures but look at it in the light now of where we are in this season series this is this purpose series look at the light and the commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto death for sin taking occasion by the commandment to see me and by its looming wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death and me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful for we know that the law is spiritual and I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do not but that I hate that I do now we don't know the details but I'm sure Peter hated what he was doing the whole time he just got under a spirit right in his mind but in his soul he must have known this whole time I hate this why am i separating why am I making our group look better than somebody else's group now Paul was the same way now I don't have it up here Paul is the same way but the Amen he broke God's commands and he hated that he did it he hated sister Wendy that the the full moon wasn't shining in the light of God he hated that part of it was waning wasn't getting brighter it's getting darker he hated that he said I want to do good but then I do that thing which I hate if then I do it that's I'm sorry and then I do that which I would not I can sentence in law that is good but then it's no more either do with it but sin that dwells within me hey hey man praise God Alleluia so Paul he says I have to recognize there's three parts of me and the part that sinning is not my soul is not the real me it's my mind and my flesh for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for the to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that would I I would I do not but the evil I would not that I do now Paul was the man sister Wendy who worked harder than anybody else in the whole gospel he said he said by the grace of God I labored more than all the Apostles but not i but the grace that was given unto me i think history said he had a 32-year ministry so he did more than 32 years than all the others did in their lifetime and now remember john had to sixty years so at least at that time paul had more ministry than even john the one that loved Jesus that laid in his bosom but Paul said it wasn't I that labored but it was the grace of God that was in me but now just with that thought just stay with me just few more minutes there was my timer in all that he did and all of you to accomplish Paul sang here I could have done more I could have done more I wanted to do something good became it I wanted to give up that book I wanted to give out that Bible I wanted to talk about William random with this person but I hate that I did it how many ever been through that I do it all the time yesterday I wanted I wouldn't take some books of somebody I forgot why did I do that I hate that I just forget but this is speaking of sin when there's a sin there and righteousness sometimes Paul would choose the sin that's not increasing that's decreasing but was he still bride yeah Jesus called him by name Saul saw I'm gonna change you from the power darkness to the power of light and you're gonna be a light and a witness to me throughout all the world verse 19 for good that I would I do not but the evil that I which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more either do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then the law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I delight in the law of the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me in this captivity to the law of sin which is in my members look at this church Paul says I come into captivity can you imagine Paul walking the church with change on spiritually now how many of us ever coming like that you can't raise your hands the right way can't sing and can't clap cuz your you're chained up and Paul said I want to do good I want to go to church I want to do these things but I'm chained up because of my own lusts because there are seasons where I get chained up and I know there's two laws I can either be free and rejoice or I can be chained up and do the things that I hate that my flesh hates I'm sorry I'm sorry that my soul hates but my flesh loves hey said I mean you're doing one or the other I'm either increasing or I'm decreasing but he's still in the cycle of God he's still in the plan of God he's still the moon he still the spokesperson to the Gentiles amen he's still the first church age messenger but he has to experience these seasons you know why so he can minister to somebody else you say brother Jason I know what it's like to be tempted in that area I know what it was like I went through a dark time of my life I went through time where I got a little cold on God did you know the moon on the backside where there's no light you know it's negative 240 degrees on the backside but brother hey men on the other side it's like over over 270 degrees Fahrenheit so the moon at all times glory it's got utter coldness and then extreme heat just like you and I right in one side of us brain in the spiritual side we've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and we're really walk in obedience there's the light of God is burning it on right our souls and spirits are filled with the things of God but in our flesh he said that evil is present with me all the time so one side he's burning up another side he's so cold and so cool he can't he can never get that side to warm up oh hi god help us Church this into our feet let's say into our feet it's a law on one side he's got the light of God on another side darkness he said oil wretched man a wonderful bride member that I am no he never exhausts himself like that see he always realized I'm lesser I must decrease and he must increase amen I'm the lesser light I'm a little or light but I'm still light I can still be a light for Christ cook should deliver me from this body of this death I thank God Jesus Christ our Lord so then with the mind here's a man who was born again he healed people on the item of Malita healed everyone on that island a man felt a little boy fell from a three-story building he died he raised him up right there and yet he's still saying this I live in a body of death there's times I hate what I do I know it's wrong I know it's in I know it's less but I do it anyway I hate that but then the same man says be renewed day by day in the spirit of your mind hey be transformed by the perfect will of God amen and that transform means to be transfigured like on Mount Transfiguration let your mind be transfigured like Christ was transfigured on Mount on Mount Transfiguration can everybody catch that now see why your mind I hope you can see it say but any men in Malachi want you come see why your mind is so important this is the part you've got to let the light of God shine on that's why that's why I wonder since 20 all the time why these the man just come on here and all the time they preach speak the word speak the word speak the word meditate on the word why do they why the man just always do that because they're they're supposed to start fires buttom and so they're supposed to go into a city and start a fire well if you're not speaking the word you don't have any fire in your mouth you have any fire in your life and then evangelist come in to speak speak to everyone says it Joe Adams bender odd contradicts all the villagers speak to wash make the way have you noticed that too because we just go the seasons of hot and cold hey God always sends him at the right time doesn't Oh glory that lie the only shines it always gets right when that word comes at that right season it's always right on time I thank the Lord for that don't you Church I think I'll stop right Darren will finish pick up on that tonight with our heads bowed let's just bow our heads for a moment here this is fresh church a lot of this just came to me this morning I went looked I heard a sermon a few years ago I went looked up a few notes on that about the moon but this thought as I watched that video I watched that video this morning of the Moon it's going through its fate I thought that's me sometimes I'm shocked and so put it in my mind church and then I can mean it seemed like so dark other times why and I think why why do you love us God and the scripture says it's four times and seasons there's a purpose Peter had to know what it was like to divide the church so that he could have mercy on those who would divide the church other times he's a young pastor so he he he he uh he falls he decreases in the spirit of dissension division and then later on in history he can try to unite people say I know what that's like I've been there I got that spirit on me one time but by the grace of God the light of God to fight in that darkness right it sent away the darkness because there's no darkness where there's light now let's just meditate on your life just for a moment churches look at your life I'm sure the word has touched your heart like it's touch money praise God thank you Jesus in times like this church I don't know if you're in the increasing stage or the decreasing now my own guess is the pastor we're probably decreasing because we had so many good healings this fall and winter I haven't heard of any healings lately you don't usually get healings when there's Bibles going on but we could be the other one I've gone through quite a few battles this week feel like I'm in this decreasing stage but the light of God has come Church boy the line of God is came to restore the brightness in your life let me say Lord Jesus how many would stray share their prayer and say Lord Jesus be with me in this season may your life return to me soon now Church you and I know that light returns as soon as we repent aim ahead glory the season will turn as soon as you and I say I'm sorry Lord let me do the first one to get how many would say lord help me to do the first works help me Jesus Lord we're honest this morning or we all go through decreasing and increasing times it doesn't mean we're not the bride in fact it does show that we are the bride because we can shine so bright amen but then Lori seems like we're so dark at times Lord the one thing we ask help us to stay in position that the light of God may shine on us again and Lord we know that it is the season for more right if we can say we're sorry and as you told Jeremiah just tell Israel to acknowledge their iniquity just just say they're wrong Church that's a fasting do today if you like more god just look up to God and just whisper in your heart say Lord I'm sorry I'm wrong here I'm wrong there I acknowledge where I'm wrong now Church if you are this increasing you pray for somebody right now everybody consider one another consider how you can stir somebody up today as we leave this place don't go here without thinking about hottest there's somebody up amen they got bent it twisted hey lord I pray for both Lord rather than that increasing stage or decreasing stage one thing I asked lord help us to be honest lord help us to repent and help us to return to the light dear God amen no doubt you were named the service is a time where the the Sun starts shining more on the moon and let this be a time of increased air for every heart may no heart leave here decreasing in the things of God may we all be increasing and more light is going to shine upon our lives may we decrease and may critics increase in our thoughts in our desires church in your heart if you got a desire that's wrong just say Jesus forgive me of that desire I crucify that desire in the name of Jesus please you've let something get in your life that's not exactly clean say Lord forgive me that I let up I come defiled my garments are there dirty wash me in the blood forgive me I won't go back to that I won't touch that again I won't say that again amen God wash us in your divine blood today father that our garments be worked amen as we go through these cycles of life to your God oh Jesus thank you Lord God thank you lord if Paul went through them and Peter went through yet there was a crowd made up for them that we believe there'll be a crime for us and take it on I believe there's a crowd waiting for us if we run the race Lord and if we keep the faith Lord we stay at our position as Christians stay separated from the world [Music] keep doing what you've called us to do dear God granted we thank you for these things in the name of Jesus Christ the church said that just worship Him I sing a song created me a clean heart let's work [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah we do all right

Sun comes it revived them again yeah we tie but this is for us this is Resurrection Amen for that rest and raise the Lord the Bible said the mouth of to every every word be established the mouth of two or three witnesses so what does that mean God has established that this worked right I didn't take it from my thoughts like I said it come down through the message and I just encourage you to know that God is faithful in a regular service regular or special meeting like last week with brother Diggs Wednesday night Sunday more doesn't matter God's faithful and God wants us to know that we've got a stay in position keep shining the light say God return the light to me if we're far far away say God increased my light let me shine with all the brightness of your glory let me let me borrow your light amen let me bonkers I have none of my own I can do nothing without Christ praise God we appreciate that brother let's just thank the Lord again praise God thank you lord let's just my head since we're dismiss your heavenly father one thing's for sure Lord you're faithful you are the greatest light we are such lesser lights Lord Paul looked at himself after all those years of ministry and said o wretched man he didn't say old great like man that I am as Paul went through more cycles Lord God he saw himself as a worse man because he saw a constant fluctuation increasing decreasing increase every day and every day said look renew me renew my mind transform our mind let me shine like Christ on Mount Transfiguration let the light of God shine reflect off my heart hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus God I thank you Lord for your mercy in your love you have established this word this message again and again I thank you for establishing again today father it's our foundation we're not founded
