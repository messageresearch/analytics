thank we the only one we're in love with today love with the world and Jesus we're just in love with Jesus praise God I forgot to do the tithes and offerings you're turning about when we pray for the word we also pray for tizen often so pardon me on that it's good to be now so Lord we sure appreciate the prayers of the saints appreciate everybody pressing out to the house of the Lord and let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 I like to look at times and seasons I told you on Wednesday there's 150 quotes on times and seasons after report I'm on number 116 I think by God's grace so getting through there I was reminded by you know just talking with my wife I was reminded that some of the greatest times I've had in the Lord is where I've taken a few words and done key a key word search through brother Graham's quotes and just seen everything that he said about a topic those are some of the most blessed times because you see from the beginning to end if God changes revelation on it or was it the same revelation all the way then you see all the times he connects that same thought to different scriptures oh it's glorious it's like brother Ram said you know Moses wrote the old Paul wrote the new and then God had to send another prophet seventh angel out to the desert to get the revelation of both of them so it's so true is such a tremendous blessing to serve God in this message I see perfection praise the Lord that's the blood of Jesus Christ this is the beating word of the hour okay good thank you for getting that I do have quotes Malachi so after we read the text here you can switch over so Ecclesiastes chapter three verse one I did look at just this thought again I'd like to continue going through all these quotes from God's prophet at the end I'd like to do a little questions and answers I've had a couple inquiries this week about my just my conviction on a few topics I like to share those and then the service so I am going to try to set a timer to do 45 minutes of preaching and then maybe 15 minutes on questions and answers and if there's more questions answers after that we'll just do a separate service on that I always like questions and answers I sure appreciate them brother branham love to know what was on the people's hearts he really liked and I'd like to know that too what is on the people's minds and as usual you'll see our our questions this week are on sanctification again there are usually on sanctification they're really not on you know the Holy Ghost or the seals or usually just sanctification which that's a great thing because God is continually sanctifying us each and every day we never get done with complete sanctification Paul says you'll be sanctified and preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord so it's a process we go through throughout our lives please ask these three one let's read verse one together one two three to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven now I want to read one more scripture I want to go to Psalms chapter one this is a different thought I'd never heard before till I was studying this morning or the RAM takes Psalms chapter one and he applies it to the messenger of the age and he was showing how God brings forth his fruits or the the fresh word of God in their season and I'd never seen that thought before I became from spoken word his original seat I never really thought about that so let's read Psalms chapter one I'll read verses 1 and 2 and let's read verse 3 together so let me read one into myself blessed is a man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night now let's read verse 3 if we can together one two three and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper amen let's bow our heads one more time for the reading of the word if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God Heavenly Father we've come before you we've read your word Lord and it's symbolic of the breaking of bread when Jesus was with Cleopas and his friend and and it was through that breaking of the bread that they knew this was the same Jesus Lord our prayer humbly this morning is that you would break your word and preach it to us in such a way that we would know that's the same Jesus who reviewing himself and has so often broken his bread broken his word through revelation to me in times past let it be you Lord God that it not be me use me I'm a yielded vessel I don't want any part of my own thought let it be your thoughts from your word Lord God and bless each and every person Lord we again we believe with all of our hearts we put all of our faith in divine healing for all these individuals that need a healing touch we believe and so we come against Satan with the armor of God and we chop away his unbelief and we just believe Lord you're going to touch these individuals and that there be victory and a shot of victory in the camp of the the Kings Camp Lord this morning and we'll give you all the glory and father be with these ties and offerings bless them Lord to thy thy service Lord God that they can do thy bidding on this earth Lord in our humble little ministry and we'll give you all the glory in Jesus Christ name the church said Amen god bless here's being seated praise the Lord so we like to look at this thought here of times and seasons like to continue on this by the grace of the Lord and as I said I think you'll probably understand you know one of the purposes behind this series this is part 11 yeah is so that everybody can see what time and season they're in and then they can know their purpose their gifts in life I have it on my heart I'm gonna just let it let you know now so you'll be ready I haven't done this yet but I want to make a spiritual list chart now they do this in denominations but we should do it too and put definitions of each of the nine gifts of the Spirit and then examples from our own lives and ministries and then that may give you an insight into what gifts are in your life and then brother Branham gives other he gives other kind of gifts things or callings he said some people were born to cast out Devils which that may be divine healing actually that be miracles he said some people were prayer warriors he said some are firebrands he says some are more scholarly like so you know within that those nine gifts of the Spirit we want to be able to find what what gifts we have how many one know what gifts you have in your life well look at that almost every hands up you know who doesn't want to know I mean don't you want to be faithful with what God's place in your lap who would want to you have to face Jesus and say well you gave me a gift but I was too afraid to know what it was he would say that that's wicked that's all that's awful I gave you a gift and you didn't want to invest in it and you buried it in the earth we don't want that Church we want to be faithful with the gifts God has given to us and so if you love the Lord I think you'll feel the same way because we love Jesus and we just want to please Jesus so let's um I just a little the slide for me let's look at our thoughts here these are quotes on brother branham's speaking about times and seasons there's 150 of them and I'm on 113 I just saw the slide earlier I'm on 113 so I just know it's a nice way to start it and God set the time and has a season or a purpose for everything that he does there's nothing happens just accidentally to those who love the Lord and are called according to his calling see we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie and he said that was so that everything has its time its season and it has its way and God is behind every move aren't you glad and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us that those things are put upon us trials and wanderings it's testing to see how we will react on an action so again just be encouraged every trial that God allows in your life is God wants to see how you're gonna react how you gonna react to being sick are you gonna curse God you're gonna blame somebody else they're gonna get depressed how you gonna act if you lose your job like our brother Hosea here has lost his job God wants to see how he's gonna react how are you act if people leave the church well God wants to see how I'll act as a pastor as I've fed people faithfully for months and years and then to see them leave God wants to see how I'll respond will I have the right attitude or not right some people in your family come against you say evil things about you God wants to see how you're gonna react or maybe it's a good thing maybe get a victory in your life and God wants to see how are you gonna give me all the glory like the lepers that's had lepers are you gonna come back and give me glory or you're you're just gonna take all the glory yourself amen even in the blessing church even the blessings God wants to see how he gonna respond to his word to the trials to the blessings and we know that if we love God I mean love God there's no accidents this was that all these prayer requests are not an accident they're for the glory of God and just let me just think just give you a word of encouragement - I've already got some good testimonies back from people who've bought my books my schoolteacher from when I was in school she's 58 years old now she's reading my book and saying I've the light bulb is going off in so many ways I never thought about it before and I even warned her beforehand I said you know this book says a woman shouldn't cut her hair and we should have wear makeup because I know she cuts her hair and wears makeup and she's like well I like to be challenged she says I like to go in the unknown things oh my and I got another one just saying uh they were so excited to read it and and thankful and they're already already seeing that all these prophecies about the falling away are true so this is helping people see what time we are living in amen people that honestly I never physically couldn't reached my old school teacher because I'm physically not there they don't even live where I used to live but see this has already been using to promote people and I wrote it you know I wrote it knowing this it's not an accident I was writing that I felt led of the Holy Spirit to write that so I'm looking for the testimonies of Lord willing for them looking for the testimonies to roll in and even if not remember brother Graham said the reason God does these things God brings his word is that so men and women are without excuse on the day of judgment but ma'am said I just read it this small or listened to yesterday junction of Time 1956 by the Rams that God makes his word so simple whether through miracle or preaching God makes it so simple so that men and women are without excuse on the day of judgment it is so simple the truth of God is so simple we just can't overlook it we just can't put our nose up in the air and think we're oh we got it all figured out we've got to humble ourselves and meditate on the things of God now the first one I try to put them in Bible order because you know like I went through a hundred quotes this your yesterday and today because there's 150 so tried to put him in order of the Bible but man talked about the time and season for Abraham and lot to separate and he says look at the junction between the separation of right and wrong with Abraham what a time Abraham seemed like that he'd got the raw deal it seems like tonight maybe because you're separating yourself from the things of the world that you got the raw deal right I think I'm Amen you know how he's been thrown out by his family literally kicked him out of the house and I seem like a raw deal but look what God's done since then amen glory and it's a pleasure for you to live with me brother let me just tell you that I love how you can live with me for a month or however long it was that was such a blessing it might look like the raw deal but it wasn't God knew all about it don't be weary in well-doing for a new season you shall reap he that endure to the end Jesus said the same shall be saved just keep looking on keep moving slowly God knows what he's doing well the only one that gets in a hurry boy I can say amen to that I get in the hurry I get I I get impatient I want it just to happen right now but brother ham says don't get in a hurry not him he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace before he even turned to page over to write a new article brother Aaron describes this sure God's in no hurry he knows what he's going to do we don't but we believe it by faith because he said he'd do it now watch God moving to Abraham setting out there to old dry country member lot church moved lot moved toward the watered country right Sodom the Bible said was lush like the Garden of Eden so Abraham was stuck in the dry season now he still had a lot of cattle but it wasn't the ideal situation for him and brother Ram picks it up to see the time and season here he said the old dry country the cattle getting all poor Sarah the most beautiful in all the land there she was sending up their old now one hundred years old right out about it Abraham old sitting out there under tree just before the junction of time what taken place he says angels appeared on the earth haha amens they were in the form of men and God Himself appeared on earth with his angels oh I hope this don't go too far over you catch it now since this was preached what here in 56 brother Branham was just starting to see how his gift was the son of man that was just like the son of man that visited Abraham and Sarah so he goes off in a whole bunch of words I just cut off the quote because he's just he's not really hitting it yet it hadn't just been but he he sees that this has to happen before the end time and then later church six times brother Graham said thus saith the Lord this ministry is the last sign to the Gentiles before the rapture once it struck him in 1961 it's thus saith the Lord he announced it in Indiana in Ohio he announced it in California by almost the whole nation there got to hear it he said write this down in your Bible this is the last sign thus saith the Lord and it was because chapter 19 God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah chapter 20 Abraham went down to the ger ear and there was no more signs God just had to correct Abimelech from taking the wrong woman even though Abraham lied God did it God was so merciful and then a lay it to his charge God never punished him for that and then 20 and then chapter 21 here comes Isaac on the scene amen that was the last sign God showed to Abraham and Sarah before Isaac arrived so see Church it all worked in time and season so God had to separate Abraham and lot lot seemed to get more rich he had more natural blessings and Abraham still had you know he was still wealthy man but he wasn't in the rich plush everything's easy his wife kept getting older so much show that she lied to God and laughed that God said Oh Sarah's gonna have a baby she was soul can I say I said she woke up on the wrong side of the bed that morning she was so out of her wits that she laughed Oh like God's gonna give me a body change like I'm gonna go in the rapture and we can do the same thing all like like the rapture could happen in 2019 it could happen in 2019 and if you laugh Sarah don't be discouraged God will change your laughing from doubt to laughing with laughing of joy amen because that's what Isaac means is laughter amen and so she's laughing at the end all praise God God that's my fault God look past my doubt and saw my desire amen God was true to the covenant that he gave me God kept his word God will give me a body change I might have doubted it in denomination I might have doubted at the beginning when I first came in the message but God's going to visit me and they can real so that we can produce the promised son amen oh you know he's going to do a church amen sometime he's going to change the doubt and saves heart to faith hallelujah and we'll see the body change gay men it has to happen someone's gonna have a pretty sin sister when he's somebody it's gonna catch that brother Jose somebody's going to catch the faith that it is me called to a body change because I recognize God in flesh discerning the thoughts intents of the heart I recognize God's last sign best save the Lord to us and will receive a body change amen boring other people can say he's a good man a good prophet a lot of miracles but they can't live what he preached from this holy book right here aren't you glad we can live from this holy book that's the whole point it was the message the word the absolute the word to get back to the word live the word amen that's why the seals were opened so we can live the full Word of God but it seemed like even though I've I've separated from the denominational Church or I've left that message church that was had no Holy Ghost there uh-huh or I've separated myself from my family that just our denominational it may seem like it's not the right season the church everything's gonna work out in God's timing season amen everything's gonna work out hallelujah hmm this kind thought kind of struck me that could be wrong on this but I believe that God in flesh in Genesis 18 was the former rain and then when he went God Himself came to visit her that would have been the latter rain that's right praise God the former rain was the teaching rain God in a man discerning the thoughts intents of the heart glory and he promised I'll visit you again hallelujah brother may have said this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world amen how to do so he's got to come again he's got to be introduced again and it's going to be through the latter rain amen because the showdown is between Jesus Christ and denominations hallelujah well thank you Laura I didn't even study I had no thought of that that's fresh from the throne this morning amen oh thank you Lord amen the former aide in latter rain will take place hallelujah no program said lot and his family now watch when we see these things that Jesus said would take place look at him as I quoted last night as it was in the days of Sodom so shall be in the coming of the Son of man just before the destruction of Sodom Abraham the church called out spiritual I'm not quoted again here there was standing out there to themselves living hard but they were right with God keeping God first how many could say you're living in a hard time I don't know how I can get you I don't know how it can get much more harder but we know it is right spiritual difficulties trying to keep your fire burning right but that's just the nature that's just the nature of this age and when the enemy comes in like a flood god is gonna raise up a standard I was gonna raise up an anointing against this amen he promised to living hard but they were right with God so glad we can put God first this morning lot was enjoying since the program breaks into this and shows how lot because he was a foolish virgin he had to be enjoying some of the things in the city for example sitting in the gate of the city he realized that he was the mayor brother Rams now it might have not been called mayor but if you read the Bible anyone who sat in the gate of a city was an elder that's actually the word they use elders of the city so he had got to such a place where he enjoyed the people patting on the back how you doing there the church also that means anyone who came into the city had to come through him so think of the things that he saw coming in that city he had to see to homosexuals coming in that city now those things would have grieved him right because he he was eventually grieved but he enjoyed some of that that's why he and his wife were so agreed to go down there in the first place they both had a little love for sin isn't that the foolish version their little foolish right because they don't die out all the way they're not wise they don't die they're still a little foolish when it comes to the Holy Ghost they don't die out other way they still want to live a little more of their lusts and their desires for the world so they enjoy sin for a season like most of the people are today calling themselves Christian if you love the world or things of the world the love of God it's not even in you let me set my timer I forgot to remember the Bible says that this is what Moses did Moses rejected the pleasures of sin for a season but eventually lot got to the place where he's a righteous man he knew was wrong and everything he saw and heard he was vexed or tormented every day by what he saw in her but there's a little bit of him that enjoyed those things okay now it also proves it because later he got drunk and his daughter slept with him now what kind of man will get drunk a man who's not a wise virgin right Noah wasn't that he wasn't the type of Enoch he was righteous man but he still liked to drink alcohol and if you got the Holy Ghost you won't get drunk other than on the Holy Ghost see because that you know that's not the real drunkenness the real drunkenness is God's Spirit flowing through you in love enjoy and learn suffering in peace and mercy and truth empower that's the real drunkenness of the Holy Ghost so true so brother Adam picks it up the reason they separated yeah they're having no strife here but it manifested that lot it was the time of season for a lot to go have an easier richer life and enjoy some of the sins for season now Church all of you want to make more money right I want to make more money but not for worldly pleasures never understand I'm not going after a Mercedes Benz but when my 2005 car when it's not here it's at home when that 224 oh I'm sorry a 2005 car with 150,000 miles when that eventually tanks I just want to get a replacement car I'm not looking for a BMW to be backwards wmb where your matter I'm not although that's interesting but I'm not looking for a $60,000 I just want something that will drive and get me to work so see there's nothing wrong with one to get a pay raise or something like that it all depends on your motive and objective so if you get a bigger high paying job and then you don't pay your tithes and offerings something's wrong with that but if God's like God has led me every time I get a pay raise I increase my tithes and offerings because you realize I wouldn't even have this without Christ he's the one who lets me go to work he's the one that keeps me strong he's put a hedge about my enemies they may he's protected me he's the ruler of fire round about me hey man oh yeah he's a wolf Holy Ghost fire they can't get to me the Devils can't get to me because Christ is protecting me amen and it's not because of me it's because of God's grace amen but I must be faithful right we must be faithful in our decisions God's looking for a faithful wife hallelujah so let me just balance that just to say that Church there's nothing wrong with putting a little more money if you got bills to pay remember ultimately it's God we saw that in Cleese yesyes it's God who makes you rich it's who makes you poor right it's God behind it so we have to be faithful to God no matter which condition we find ourselves in there's a season to get and there's a season to lose how many can say amen to that now the next example brother visits us over and over again as I've gone through quotes is Naomi so we find that she begins alone to go back because they heard that a great revival had broke out why didn't they only leave because it was a drought and if you notice they only returned and barley season the Bible suggests at the time of the harvest in other words when there was a great revival going on spiritually applying it she returned just in that season oh there used to be a dried up there but now it's revival going on up there let's go back to the promised land let's go back to the word how did oh yeah let's go back there because there was a revival going on around that word did I skip one nope now when I pray that you'll be merciful to those who are sick and afflicted wait did I skip one no I didn't okay now look how great Lanham applies and they owe me going back to the promised land he applies it like this there are those here Lord who need the heat the healing touch Oh Lord you did restore Bethlehem to all her former glory you restore during the time of depression when she was sick you brought her right back and brought Naomi at barley season sober mmm types a drought in Bethlehem as a sickness enters into our bodies and God lets us recognize that we just like Naomi if we are if if we leave that land of heat of good health were allowed to go back to that land amen and now father we pray that you'll bring every Naomi glory we've got one this church might say we got more than one they owe me sitting over there with her wonderful children each and every one of us are now only brother Ram says in other words you can see how you need to be like Naomi in this part of your life you'll bring every Naomi and everyone that's in here that is in need so how many have needs this morning well your Naomi that's how brother man applied it see I pray oh God Oh Lord it's just body season this great body loaf that was seen coming rolling down the hill in the camp an enemy that was with Gideon a barley row so barley season represents harvest which represents revival I'll play God you will bring that great body loaf into this building now and that it may be the atonement for the sickness of the people as well as sin and here every person that's in divine presence amen so a heart of barley harvest represents revival because you've worked and labored in the hot season and not the seeds are coming now the fruits are coming forth amen the fruits are coming forth from all your neighbors all those long services all those long prayer times all those long years and months now is harvest now's the time to see the fruit of all that labor Gloria how many appreciate that quote I thought that was beautiful all the Naomi's in here I wish she was in here I could see her see her face smiling face but I've never said my kind I don't have much on this one but this was just a quote and since it was a different story I thought I'd bring it to you so you could see the time and season and now you know what the story came out what was it speaking of mike-mike ayah years had passed but the time had come that the word to be for that word to be fulfilled my Chi is prophecy about a.m. when the season rolls around don't you worry the crop will be there so my kinda said if you come back at all hey hab then the Lord never spoke to me and they have smacked him said smack that boy put him in a prison when he sat there for years brother Branham says but he said there came a time when a.m. was going to see that that was the Word of God and when that came to pass my Chi of course he be sad a have died but he would rejoice in the fact that God keeps his word the crop of the seed of prophecy that was planted would then be harvested and that's a larga to see when we start seeing these driverless cars driving around America amen we start seeing families in cars play games they will see now we see the fruits of that see that was put away back there how we see the fruits of it and we can obviously see it is the time and season of the rapture amen hallelujah because there's a cool program says see he said it came to pass he said but they're still waiting on the highways to do that so brother I knew the cars were ready back then but now we're waiting on the highways and now it seemed like a switch somehow and now they're waiting on the cars right how many got Google News just I just put on Google News say I want to see all the things about Jarvis cars and they'll pop up every time a new article comes up that's what I do and the most recent article was they're trying to put more money into it and get it done by next year 2020 can you believe that church they've been saying that for years now I preached on that years ago they're trying to get it going next year I'm not prophesying but Church truly can you rub your eyes and see what if you can see the season out there it's almost spring breaking if you can see the season change in there we'll surely you can see the season in God's Holy Word right doesn't take a scientist to go see that at school we planted some little bulbs some of them are already sprouting doesn't take a scientist to know this rings around right around the corner you had a few hot days we had a first little was at purple crocus popped up there at the school I was like glory that's a sign Springs tear anybody can you know who found it there's a little three-year-old boy who was with his mom and in the greenhouse with all of us and he's the one he's like look at that a flower a three-year-old boy I can catch the time in season if a three-year-old boy can catch the natural side what about us who've been the message for 10 15 20 30 years we should be able to see God's signs amen hallelujah don't worry brother they the cop will be there now hide don't worry you might come in your day when you're older don't worry the crop will be there we'll start sitting these things come to pass the driverless cars the mark of the beast image of the Beast start forming we won't see it lay down because Jesus said we won't see that I'll keep you from the hour temptation that would come upon the whole world we won't see that but we'll see that tightening don't worry you'll see the crop of it amen it's exactly right amen Zechariah is the priests program it Labor's on this one so then when I see their just before the end time come there was an honest man by the name of Zechariah who had prayed earnestly for a child that what happened a angel appeared on earth for the first time since Malachi hundreds of years and an angel appeared and told Zacharias America was going to take place and he believed it now look at this church he didn't believe it at first but God absolutely because it's so oh well he had Abraham Isaac and had Sarah and all them turn back there to believe and hand at the temple but he failed to see it now let me stop let me see it let me let me show you just real simply before the angel came Zacharias was praying Oh God give us a child did he believe it yes or no yes when the angel said you're gonna have a child that he believed it not at that moment so he believed it before in the friends that angel is like when is this gonna happen so the angel says you'll be dead or you you'll be dumb until he's born for a little season so a season can be nine months and then afterwards did he believe it yes he's the one that wrote John and the Bible said as soon as he wrote that the Holy Spirit struck him and he started praising God amen see he said the angel said it'll be failed in its season and you're going to be silent because you doubted in my presence he believed we prayed for it believed it doubted it but then God says well since you believe it at the beginning you're gonna believe it eventually amen in other words I'm gonna forgive your unbelief oh god help us to take that encouragement that if we believe in doubt it believe in doubt it God is gonna help us believe Amen God will help you believe hallelujah think about all those people that believe Abraham believes and didn't struggled and lied Sarah but laughed and believed try to interpret but eventually God brought it to passing in other words I believe said unbelief does not hinder God even believers even you're not unbelief does not hinder God let's let times and seasons go look for the season go another season and pretty soon God will bring the seas in the past when you and I believe it hey man oh that's such an encouragement to me see immediately after he wrote it his mouth was open and he started praising God oh praise the Lord I've never thought for nine months that's kind of like us sometimes I haven't been able to shout in church for nine months but now I can go for God amen I've been able to testify to my neighbor for nine months I mean now I can testify to the glory of God he's over my mouth he strengthened my faith and he praise the Lord so God's gonna get you to praise him from your lips he's gonna get it he said an angel and he couldn't even believe it in the presence of an angel mercy God is gonna get praised Church let me go back as I skipped a quote oh that was God a long time ago he can't do that today and then angel said I'm Gabriel who stands the Prince of God my words will be fulfilled in their season because that you doubted me you'll be dumb to the day the baby's born you'll cause named John amen the junction time had come amen Lori the time it go it's time to believe and even if your belief is a little weak he'll make sure you believe by the end of it that's true with Sara Abraham that's true with everybody no flesh shall glory in Christ's presence brother Branham won't take glory from Jesus John Wesley Paul no each of us are constantly continually struggling we fall short but no one will get glory but Jesus Christ in other words he's gonna help you believe amen it is hard and it is season hallelujah it just depends on the time for they men it just depends on the time you say I believe in the rapture but I just can't do this or that we'll just stay with God stay get through this season and wait for the next season wait for the next season to roll around because the the time of junction is going to come the time of change is going to come in our lives if we just hang on to faith hang on to God and we know those we know the same gods I'm really not hanging on to God God is holding on to me right we know that too but in we have at least we have some responsibility to hang on as well we have some of that ultimately it's God hanging on us but yes but you and I have a responsibility to hold on ourselves keep believing there's a delicate balance there now he says John the Baptist he came out of the wilderness jesus said this Elijah which was spoken to come restore all things and it made Elijah made John dressed like just like Elijah perhaps acted like him but John did no miracles and following John came Jesus not preaching too much not much of a preacher but was performing signs and wonders as a vindication that John's ministry was in season and have indicated so Jesus came after John's ministry with signs miracles and wonders to vindicate what John had already been doing and brother Branham said that he was that John he said now so remember what signs in America wonders did John do it was just the preaching of the word it was huge revival services of John say repent confess your sins stop follow those devil preachers down there and the church said like he used their Serpent's their generation of vipers come to God's Word repent of your sins and be baptized for six months that was a miracle the fact that he could stand up against all those unholy rulers and yet he was a holy man was a miracle and he had baptismal service after baptismal service after baptism of service amen and he paved the way for Christ to come and do all the miracles glory I have a quote let me show you both have said preaching me preaching the Holy Ghost today is America you thought well I thought well maybe but there's no miracle say a church me preaching the Holy Ghost is a miracle can I show it to you real quick I saved it under my Joseph Branham file now all due respect because they say there's no preaching I know it's really small but brother Aaron said its repeating again today when when man pounding away at the gospel the Lord Jesus Christ preaching the baptismal ghost getting the people ready for the coming judgments or shield from it and a modern church people are laughing and making fun saying there's nothing of it and the days of miracles pass it's a miracle a signpost we're at the junction hey hallelujah it's America brother says that men can still stand today in this wicked age and preached the baptism of the Holy Ghost God doing a miracle this morning amen then I won't compromise and say well as long as you believe God sent a prophet you've got the baptism Holy Ghost what a lie right even here believe John was a prophet Herod a man who made two women and doctor her even he could recognize that Elijah anointing that doesn't mean anything it means who will obey what Elijah said that's what that's the real question that's the real proof who will live by every word that proceeds out the mouth of God the little did you know America was taking place this morning I'm glad God can use me for a miracle because I'm the least and I'll take no glory in it it's all God's leadership by the Holy Ghost it's not me but it says God's miracle it's not me it's God's miracle that men will still preached the baptism all he goes today if you're not born again if you don't feel like you can serve God fully if you don't feel like crisis dwelling in your soul then you need to come right here I sit on your chair and cry and beg and call it to God until he fills you with power from on high well you know you'll never compromise where you're always fall in love with Jesus amen hallelujah we're not ashamed to be a Christian you're not ashamed to stand on the Word of God but instead your life pulsates it amen you're like this / made with the power love of Jesus Christ that no matter what season you're in when it's dry when it's rich and rainy no matter what season you're in you're living for Christ and you live by every word proceeds out of the mouth of God Brewery and that my friends was a miracle we just witnessed it that's what your prophet said did not believe it - it's maybe just a different kind of miracle than what we'd expect program said Jesus birth was in the right time in season now bro in this quote just focuses I didn't find any other quotes on this because I didn't have really time to look I was just trying to say in this channel brother and focuses on the on the evil people had to be there at this time in season when Jesus was born now as a birth of our Blessed Lord Jesus as most unnatural to see how God worked in this manner because no other time would have ever worked in all the history of the world is that striking Jesus could not have been born today in other words Jesus could not have been born in the days of Abraham northern a is America all those getting close real close or sir or Daniel and they are they don't want to see them aside no wonder the Messiah decoded the Nord ah David it David did so much he danced around the heart just lay no God send the blessings of God amen no no he would have loved it but it was a first time in season it could not have been in that time because my lamb says see and it had to be just exactly at this time the time Jesus was born he said and a few moments let's just look right at the season so I skipped a paragraph no this is next paragraph it was a time when it went ahead the murderer was king so God had to have a murderer as a ruler in order for Jesus to be born because that's what Revelation chapter 12 prophesied right it had to be this heartless man had to be king at that time for we're acquainted with the scriptures that said he slew all the children from 2 year-old down trying to find the Christ and it had to be just at that time now it seems like brother Aaron were pretty close right with all these abortion fanatics out there the infant decide where they call in where the damn Democrats not many of them and probably some Republicans tube of Democrats they weren't laws fast so they can kill the baby outside the womb that's what they're trying to get now think about that that's evil that's wicked that's from a hail that's that's from Satan that's a murdering demonic evil possessive spirit but look what they had in their day they had it where you could kill him two years old see that to see Jesus could not be born a day like today we've got too much respect for babies right I mean right he had to be born in a day when there was an even more wicked evil murderous person ruling and that was Herod he sue all the children from zero down trying to find Christ and it just had to be just at that time now that's the negative side God had to have evil murders God also has some faithful shepherds out there in the field that will be shipping their flocks faithfully at night while they're had given babies to or giving birth to their little babies and Shepherds out there that were praising God and Shepherds that would hear angels sing and say go let's go tell somebody about these angels amen oh yeah they're shepherds that weren't ashamed the angels sing and go back and tell everybody about it there's eight we saw angels tonight the Messiah is born the saviours born let's go come and see about him and then he had them shepherds that were so humble they believed the Angels and they would believe in the presence of the Angels Zacharias died in the presence of angels but God had to have shepherds and I hope I'm one of those shepherds cuz I'm a shepherd in the spiritual - god help me to be a shepherd that can see the angels and then tell everybody about it amen hallelujah they also had to have a virgin girl there Mary who would meditate on the word behold a virgin shall conceive she would hear that word preach and then be able to meditate in such a way where the angel could come and say Mary it's you you're gonna conceive the word in your heart and she would not know she would just say be done to me according to the prophecy of the hour amen see because she was there she was a believer at the right time in season God knew she believed so she had to be there at the right time God predestinated her to be there hey man what a what a consolation to us amen that we are right where God wants us to be we just got a raise higher in Christ that's right never would have worked in the other part of history Jesus being born ain't or Shepherds that would receive angels and never - worked this is the only time now Peter I got a few more minutes here he said well it might have been Simon November when they were testifying on the boat before the Jesus calm the waves and beam it be not afraid as I who knew something not those things - that raised up and said well that's very good job but what bothered me first was when Andrew come and told me there's a prophet down there well I could hardly believe that but I remember my daddy told me that when the Messiah come that he would be a prophet and when I looked there that day with Andrew I looked at him in the face and he looked at me and said your name is Simon you are the son of Jonas and that settled it forever for me I knew that that was him because we've had 400 years without this prophet and here he comes on the scene and I know it was season the time was right and that was bound to be him oh so there was something inside of Peter when he saw Jesus discern his heart this has got to be the Messiah my dad told me about that generations have told me the Messiah's going to come and when he comes hilde certain he'll be like unto Moses he'll discern the thoughts and intents of my heart and when it happened when the light and the ministry struck him he believed it ain't no same thing happened about the Amen when soon as he heard the message he believed in Amen ha ha same night I was a message I believed I could explain it but I believe it amen some people takes no longer I need a couple of more exposures to believe it but you'll see it if you're a child of God you'll see the message hallelujah the time was right that was bound to be him now remember Jesus didn't do it for four or five times he did it once and that said it they were ready they knew that that was he I love this one the woman at the well when the Samaritan went when that miracle was done it when Jesus told her found her fault and told her what her fault was see that's why people won't receive brother branham they won't let brother bran tell them they're wrong about cutting their hair about wear a makeup about being a real man and not going to movie shows and sleeping with women in lesson after Marilyn Monroe posters they're not mad enough to receive the message right they don't want to be told where they're wrong but if you can be told where you're wrong and still love that person you're getting in the way of wisdom now she never said she was he was reading her mind they knowed it was a time of season for that Messiah to come and the Messiah would do that how he knows that she said we know that when the Messiah cometh he will do this so brother amen there have been preaching not only to Jews the Messiah's gonna do this the Messiah he's coming he was they were getting ready generations before it not all wasn't Jews it was with Samaritan the whole world knew was coming the astrologers knew it was coming over there in Babylon because they traveled two years to get the Christ amen they knew it it was all around the world and so you know in 1995 which was what how many years ago about 25 years ago almost this major series book series came out called Left Behind how many remember that I was a freshman in high school and the first one came out in 1995 my freshman year church they sold 80 million copies and now it's there's three or four movies about it there's a cartoon about it there's all these things 80 million that's just books what about all the ebooks and I didn't get those numbers I was looking on Wikipedia getting information let's say a billion let's say a billion a billion people have been influenced by this book called Left Behind and in the plot it's about true believers who are raptured including the Pope right and then all these people are left behind they get saved they get born again which that's the Jew not not not Gentile and they start saving people get ready for the Antichrist to be revealed why is that popular now why didn't that come out earlier like 200 years ago because this is the season for the rapture this was never popular beforehand but now it's it's so it's so popular they can make movies of it and you know the one about the Dwayne Johnson The Rock was in that one about California sink in a few years ago remember that of course you never saw it hopefully you didn't see it but they're there they're making movies about California sinking hey man movies about me left behind what is it it's the season so if all this information is out there if this there's this awareness of the rapture there's got to be somebody who's going to receive the genuine revelation of it amen that somebody's going to be you and I hey by the grace of God amen why because he came looking for me I didn't go looking for him but man said you can know the season through Israel think I'll stop after this one because I yeah well there's my tent right there I'll just try to do five more minutes knowing the season there Israel by man says now remember this quote this scripture has got to be balanced with 1st Thessalonians 5 I preached this last Sunday night but at the times it seasons brethren you have no need so a holy gopher Christian doesn't need someone to come around and tell them oh it's the time it's the season because the Holy Ghost inside of them is already preparing them right because the bottoms of the Holy Ghost will guide you into he's your comforter he's your teacher he's your advocate and yes he teaches you through preachers his brother Mannis at all there's a question should we have preachers if the Holy Ghost our teacher but I said of course if not then you got to get rid of the Ephesians chapter 4 which says the five gifts will perfect the bride of Jesus Christ so you can't have one scripture contradict another they all got to be in harmony together amen glory he said I want you to see what the day I'm sorry if you want to see the day of the month look on the calendar if you want to see what day and the season is coming in Lord watch where Israel setting that's God's timepiece there she is setting in her homeland the oldest flag in the world the six point Star of David the oldest flag in the world flies again for the first time for twenty or twenty five hundred years yes sir yes the ensign that was to be lifted up Israel Palestine blossoming as a rose you read the magazines and watch how they come back way down in Iran and so forth let me see on my quotes here let me slides rather yeah let's stand to our feet here I want to close with this thought here I heard Perry green mentioned this institute years ago I never really studied out to a few years ago there is this Institute in Jerusalem and they're called the Temple Mount faithful that's their nickname but they're also called the temple Institute and there are nonprofit organization and they have one mission their ultimate goal is to see Israel rebuild the holy temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem in accord with the biblical command now I was going through their news and their most recent news is they put out this beautiful book about how the Temple of Jerusalem must be built perfectly they've done all this research their most recent product is a book about restoring the temple makes me happy chairs amen that they are getting ready why are you happy because I know as soon as they start digging we're either going up or we're already going up amen because God won't deal with both at the same time God may let the moon but as soon as they start sacrificing worship and bread I believe we'll be out of here by God's grace their main goal this is all is their hole they're dedicated just to every aspect of the Holy Temple you can watch their leaders got this big old gray beard he's so Orthodox their women wear long skirts amen the men wear pants the women wear long skirts okay these are the ones that I believe are going to get the Holy Ghost because they have such a burden I believe these are some of the hundred forty-four thousand I could be wrong but I believe this group because they were there back they want to get back to the law get back to the word get back to building get our temple back get the worship of God back there website says they cry Church they cried the Western Wall and they write their prayers on paper and they go squeeze it in that temple there they squeeze it they praise they God build the temple and their website says they have prayed three times a day for over 50 years that God will rebuild that temple amen just like the Muslim play pray five times a day the Jews pray three times a day like Daniel only we could have that kind of dedication amen now we pray without ceasing don't get me wrong but like the dedication of getting down physically and praying three times a day do you do it well probably not we probably don't do it as much as we should our communion is constant right but I like the dedication of them bowing three times a day so for 50 years or since 1948 whatever is over that it's over 50 years then 70 years they prayed they push these papers in your God rebuild the church rebuild the church and God saying I will I just got to get a few more my broad members into the Holy Ghost there's a few more red members I still got to get dressed and get ready for my wedding and then I'll come back for my Jewish people - oh thank you Lord hallelujah the time and season it's almost the time and season and you and I are the ones they got to be ready praise the Lord there's my 45 minutes have you enjoyed the word this morning I didn't get to all the where I was going there was other things I wanted to get to I guess we'll save that for Wednesday yeah I got one two three four five I got plenty of sermons that I could have preached a long time but I don't I don't want to wear you out Church if we could let's just bow our heads in Malachi and me man just come let's play few songs if anyone needs prayer we want to pray for them and now I just want to do a few questions and answers after that by the grace of the Lord how many feel God's presence here this morning Amen I feel strange boldness assess what I mean strangers it's a holy boldness it's the Holy Spirit I feel that this morning thank God for that praise the Lord let's sing only believe only believe then let's just bow our heads here and we'll sing only believe if and there's a need on anybody's heart here this morning are you encouraged I hope you're encouraged searcher Abraham had to be separated the season to go through dry dry seasons but God visited him in the next season Zechariah believed at first but then had a spell of doubting but God caused him God raised his face we can believe you and I will be no different there's times we'll be so on fire they'll be times I have such confidence but then we'll go through a season of doubting right we made out if we're even saved or have a rapture we made out these things but how many know Jesus is gonna come in the right season and strengthen your faith absolutely absolutely [Music] he's so faithful to his word and you and I are a part of it because we recognized his word for this day just as the woman at the well recognized there's gonna be Messiah Peter and Nathanael they're supposed to be a messiah that's him so we can look at the ministry brother branham and say that the sermon that's the Messiah side this is the season God has visited Abraham seed to prepare us for going away amen this is the season aren't you glad you can see it Church aren't you glad let's just bow our heads for a moment here Heavenly Father we love you Lord and I just want to open up the altar if anyone needs prayer for the holy ghost or anyone Lord needs a touch and they want to be anointed of course father we know it's not necessarily the oil that just helps give us a faith contact Lord gives us another channel to say well I believe the word I acted upon the word gives us a place the signpost we can put down and say I did that I've acted on God's Word I've done everything I know how to do I'm just waiting up all in the promise of God [Music] we thank you Lord for this word that we've heard this morning surely you'll bring your word to pass in its season it's unfailing unchanging hallelujah I feel such a bonus in your spirit this morning Lord we thank you for that dear God we rebuke Satan previously and we can do it again we've taken you at your word Lord God we're acting upon our faith the revelation you place in our heart so father we just want to invite anyone now Lord if there's the one that needs prayer Lord you just want to have a chance to pray for them so Lord Jesus help our faith now Lord God I know there's times I doubt there's times I go through human struggles doesn't mean I I've lost all my faith it just means I'm going through a mind battle and I need my faith renewed I need my mind transformed by the renewing of the Holy Spirit day by day hour by hour hallelujah that ruined renewing power be renewed in the spirit of your mind and all we take out your word this morning that your word is powerful that a miracle has taken place this morning that your word is preached about the real baptism of the Holy Ghost why why thousands of church of this area we just preach on just speak in tongues just come to church or just get baptized and you know you're going to heaven or something like some fairy tales but we believe the real Word of God we must be justified sanctified and filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we believe that we're not doubting it Lord we believe it it's your word unlesss now in your divine presence in Jesus Christ name the church said I just recognize her brother bangs not here yeah we miss him left to pray for him at the end they just thought of him because he came up for prayer last week that's why I thought that wonder if he anyway I wonder if he needs prayer we all thank the Lord for
