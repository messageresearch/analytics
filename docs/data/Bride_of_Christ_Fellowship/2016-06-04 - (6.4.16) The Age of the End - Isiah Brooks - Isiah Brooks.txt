a it's been a while now but it seems some time short and sometimes forever but you know in the course of it all we have all learned a lot of things about God and in the process of our pastoring we have matured yes sir yes sir and now we understand it's not about me or you amen it's all about him God praise God as we turn to Genesis the first chapter chapter we're going to read There by God's grace the first four verses how many of us thank God for Mali 4 amen amen glory where would we be about like I said last night where will we be without a vision amen he brought the vision that we to we are to walk into amen we appreciate the Lord Genesis 1 1-4 we're try not to be long my iPad is G not going to let me stay on it too long I forgot to recharge it so we going to go what whatever you got it stops a sto we move on amen amen Genesis 1 1-4 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth amen and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep glad to see you brother and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day amen Ezekiel 91 through1 please he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying caused them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand yes and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lith toward the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with the writers in and they went in and Stood Beside the Brazen Altar and the glory of God of Israel was gone up from the Cherub whereupon he was to the threshing floor hold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers Inc corn by his side and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the forehead of the man that that cry for all the Abomination that he had done in the midst thereof to the others he said in mine earing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have slay otherly old and young both m m and little children women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at My Sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city and it came to pass while they were slaying them and I was left that I fell upon my face and CRI and said oh Lord God will I destroy all the residue of Israel in th pouring out of th Fury upon Jerusalem and he said unto me the iniquity of the House of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great and the land is full of blood and the City full of perverseness for they say the Lord have forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth not and as for me also my eyes shall spare not not spare neither will I have pity but I will recompense their way upon their head Behold a man clothed with linen when he had the inkor by his side reported the matter saying I have done as th has commanded wow let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you lord it's h as we know how and we thank you Father for your grace and your mercy Lord we thank you for being so good to us Lord God you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves we did not come here for form or fashion or to be seen of men or but I pray father that you move me completely Hallelujah father left lord lord lord we want 100% from you father circumcise my lips circumcise My Heart Lord let me not speak but you speak through us today Lord and may the people have eyes to see that they'll be able to pull the veil back and see the glory of God hallelujah Have Mercy In Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen may be see i' like to entitle my message age of the end sub topic I would like to work with would be speak to the darkness we notice in Genesis when God created all things and he began in the first chapter or first verse when he says God created heaven and Earth but if we look in those four verses God to the light amen he never speaks to Darkness but he brings a separation amen light from Darkness it is always been God's program Amen to separate it was was then and it is now it was God who spoke in the beginning amen that's right is that right the Bible said in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God that same word became flesh amen right the Bible said he created all things he who the Lord Jesus Christ amen yes and from that point on God has Contin kept light and darkness from each other yes brother B said he is a separa sir yes sir he separate evil from good and good from Evil that's right you may have heard me say this before but it Remains the truth Jesus said that the church was the Sal right yes it was the preserver of life but he also said if the salt will lose its Savor what good is it right the only work in has is to be troden on the foot amen and thinking on that whale and that level amen I thought about as long as God's people people are in order yes the world will never be judged let me because the Bible First begins amen at the house of God Amen Israel would have never been judged amen if the church had remained clean yes sir Hallelujah and when I say that I just think about when God was getting ready to destroy s amen L and his crew that went down to Sodom would have stayed Sodom would have been spared amen but when the church goes corrupt amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying when the church goes corrupt then God judged the church amen and therefore by judging the church the world is judged amen see a sinner is a sinner amen sir and only a Sint can s come on some that's the words of your Prophet a sinner cannot sin he's a sin but it is of those who claim to be clean and Sanctified and holy they're the ones judgment begins with amen is that right God this before God even judged the whole of Israel he said start at the house of God why because it was there God knew that the standard children with hell of hell yes sir Hallelujah but when that standard go what good is it y'all hear what I'm saying listen God can't even destroy this world Amen until the bride is gone amen let's I'm going to hear myself I use the word judge but we understand what I mean I mean destruction because we're in the age of Destruction what's holding God back from destroying everything right now when everything is hallelujah it's you amen the Bride of Jesus Christ is the only reason this thing hasn't rolled into full [Applause] judgment the thing that gets me in Ezekiel whether Israel knew it or not the the job had already been done amen got the word of God and seen the vision the angel came back and said it was already done yes sir I already completed it ameno somebody even though it took hundreds of years before all of this came to pass amen it was already done amen look at when Titus came into Jerusalem yes and history tells us amen that God that that that that it was so bad to the people were locked in brother described it they they missed the message of Jesus they miss the message of the son of man Hallelujah he Hallelujah remember even Jesus said he said I would have I would have brooded over you myself so they rejected the day of their visitation amen sir is that right God will not judge before the warning there's always a warning before the judgment so we realize that here even in jerus I want you to understand this now people were saying I say you know I said when the people will literally be eating their children and everything else and you can almost here gasp in their spirit I said wait a minute now I said but you got to understand every time there was a major famine or some type of interruption wherein that men could not feed themselves and and provide for themselves Israel who were the children of God sought to eating their own come on now come on C Africa in South America it was in Israel is that right Solomon even had to deal with a case of it yes and you got to understand that this world is produc see cannibals amen oh people don't think so but all of these monster movies they bringing out and people eating people's flesh the devil is sewing seeds yes sir that's right oh come on somebody you better recognize what the devil is doing because you listen people don't understand Satan has a greater pullit right than you and I he's got the television and he's preaching and sowing seeds all the time y hear what I'm saying yes sir to come to pass said not Satan's word yes Siran said I will Ascend amen above the throne throne of God come on somebody that's right did he do it yes has he done it brother bar said so in God of this evil age is that right that's right say the sons of God which is the church worshiping him oh come on somebody just pull help me I want you to understand there's a mass slaughtering coming and only the Bride of Jesus Christ will be the ones that will escape itj oh absolutely Matthew 25 tells about wise and foolish I don't necessarily have to read that but you and I understand those who were foolish thought and thought they had enough oil but the oil ran out but we're not talking about like I said last night you can have all kinds of gifts you can have every gift that God has but if you don't have Divine love nothing y'all hear what I'm saying I appreciate everything that God has given now you know what to call it's not something you could put on it's not something you could act into it is something that is divinely given to you according to your election see you must be elected amen receive div even so I find out that even Among Us that we we don't have a prayer life you know and my thing is it's not like like the brother said you you got to meet there every day at a certain time that's all good yes but the Bible tell us that we have to pray without ceas our prayer life should be going on 247 is that right oh yes there are time that you are to be on your knees or on your face in an intimacy with God but you should never ever stop praying amen hallelujah I remember uh brother Keith uh was uh getting ready to drink out of water fountain and at his work he began to pray before he drank the water they started laughing at him but I thought that's awesome yes amen how many of us pray about our water that's right Hallelujah and I always tell my wife and others if they're going to do something to us they're going to put it in the water amen that's true that's true because it's one of those things that you and I must have we we have we feel so secure because it's B doesn't keep turns away like you heard me say many times I believe in casting out Devils especially Hallelujah you and I must that the problem was that they one of the reasons why they they didn't have prayer amen yes sir and remember when brother preach statue of a perfect man hello y get quiet on that but you understand those virtues that God pulls up through you amen right you can't can't can't even work with that if it ain't in you amen Yes Y'all hear what I'm saying listen when it come to maturity you and I understand that you cannot add a cupid to your stature right well amen let me say it like this how many of y'all need more patience how you going get it amen but it's in the seed amen but how you going to get it you have to water it by way of prayer yes amen oh come on and say like this even a tree know how to Bow amen true right yes sir and you and I must understand you know I'm not interested in in in you know there's only one thing I have and that's Psalm 27 like I said last night there's only one thing I desire amen yes sir one thing I desire and that is to be in the house of Hallelujah to dwell in his Temple yall so you and I realized that prayer is an essential thing right it sounds Elementary but that's okay amen prayer is an essental thing for you and me amen because when the foolish verion came to the wise brother said it the wise told the foolish amen yes sir and you pray out until you know you've been sealed by the Holy Ghost when you sealed by the Holy Ghost there's nothing that can block you or stop you from Destiny Hallelujah I didn't I said see thank you Lord when God and I told you the other day I said what we have all the potential of the Rapture in US amen that what the problem is we don't know how to yield to the Holy Spirit Hallelujah we the bride must learn how to yield you can't do it amen but one thing for certain you can humble yourself amen and let him do it amen we fail to see that this thing I look at the thing I said oh my God everything's going haywire it look like it's out of but it's not everything is going according to the plan of God tell somebody list all Who Fallen away yes sir you can't fall away from that which is untrue the only way you can fall away is that what you have is true and then you leave true that is what we call Falling Away amen yes sir and all of these were ordained to do so amen that's right yes Hallelujah but when every time I think about it doesn't make me feel like I'm better no sir it's the grace of God it doesn't make me feel like you know I'm just so glad [Applause] Mead thank you Lord Lord come on I've done enough since I've been saved to go to hell yes right come on one sin and you guilty other [Applause] right oh like I said it's a gift of is the grace of God is God blessing you thank you Lord get CAU up you know get lifted in such a way that we think we're better than somebody this coming from anwers and they said go by from from those who sell to you they said and they went to to receive the Holy Ghost but the Gentile dispensation had been finished and the persecution Rose you go pray amen oh that's why the devil don't want folks praying he wants you just to assume you God Amen and like I said you can fast you can pray you can pay your ti you can come to church every day amen hallelujah you can stand on the street Jesus is real but if you ain't been born again if you not sheld with the Holy Ghost in your soul all your laboring worship has been in that's was your Prophet amen I read those quotes last night yes so you understand it's not about your emotions it's not about your feelings even though y'all know I love it I love the dance for with the Holy Spirit touches me and I can weep before him but I'm not deceived I know what it's all about because we find out that Israel did it all they saw the pillar fire they saw the pill Cloud they saw the frogs and everything else that took place amen and they still denied the word amen oh come but there's a Joshua and a Cale able to look behind beyond the badger skin of Moses and they realized no man could do these things and they saw the god behind [Applause] the y'all hear what I'm saying we are blessed people on a course of Destruction is that right look you you ride down the street you don't mean too but they got all kind of be this movie is coming out that movie is coming out and everything you flip your wives to is about the destruction of the world Hallelujah if it ain't the destruction of the world the destruction of New York right or California they hit the head and the tail it's the TR and don't you know something's coming oh come on somebody that's how tius F Israel came a little while and then he left and they said well see the prophet didn't come through Hallelujah and and and what happened Israel relaxed they did us hallelujah 911 came and they hit us amen and that America has relaxed all over again bringing in the Muslims by the thousands Hallelujah I don't mean no they are wild the Bible said they will be hated in every nation it's just like the story when the man in the winter time a man picked up a snake it was frozen to death almost and he picked the snake up and put it in the bosom and said I'll take care of you Hallelujah all of a sudden when when the snake awakener came out of that thought position amen he be he began to lick his lips he got no lip but you know what I'm saying he began to lick his tongue and everything else and he was getting ready to bite the man or whatever he said you not going to bite me he said why not you knew I was a snake when you picked me up Hall tell the story just exactly right but America has picked up some snakes I don't care how M and you talk about saveing oh come on somebody I believe that the Muslims can be saved but don't you think it's going to be there Bible the only reason why I believe that is because the Bible said out of every nation Kindred and Tong Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying but what we don't realize is that the devil has control of people I don't know how he's going it all together this cathol Hallelujah but she's the mother she's a ruler of all and when she began to speak amen they will become obedient amen that's right what you talking about this has nothing to do with what's written on paper this is spiritual is that right come on somebody nobody had to sign papers to follow Hitler amen his speech his words his Spirit was spell binding wake up America amen you and I have experienced a spellbinding president for a long time amen eight years you put the people under spell and they don't even know it and they won't see it perhaps until they wake up amen when they wake up it'll be too late come on if they're not anointed by the Holy Ghost they are anointed by the devil H you better recognize the devil got preachers just like God's [Applause] got Hallelujah but we didn't come amen just to see the world fall apart thank God for the prophet thank God for the b in this last day Hallelujah we knew it wasn't just a man but God hid behind the ve of that man that's why people get all messed up see I see God and you might see a man amen he like for example amen and I ask God because you can go through it and you say well brother B said that uh saw uh Noah no saw right and I said Lord I said you know you go through the scriptures you can't really put it together that is you said more than one time said Noah was a prophet right yes sir amen amen amen he didn't say he was dead he said I saw him Hallelujah yes Moses wasn't in the day of creation but he wrote the books that's true Hallelujah brother said I was preaching and in that preaching a vision broke and I saw Adam and Eve right come [Applause] on AET and a prophet can go behind forward sir y'all believe that you don't you know we we you can't things you can't explain but they're there if you ask God sir yall hear what I'm saying so that's Go On by the grace of God now I'm working with the bride of Christ amen right we're living in the age of Destruction amen AR you glad for y'all didn't say Amen you ought to be happy because this world must be destroyed before ours come in oh yes my heart on the street I'm happy come my God me before Oh do it sound like I'm crazy but I tell you like like it is I can't hardly wait till it's all over amen you oh brother Bruce when the squee come y'all better understand something something is going on right now spiritually you and I have never fought battles like like never before I remember when I was first a Christian you fight a battle every now and again and then the Second Battle didn't come until the first one was over right that's right that's true that's right now we're in a battle like

doesn't make mistakes God doesn't even have second choices amen thank you Jesus amen we work with his permissive will his permissive will that he permits you to do it God's First Choice is a real Choice Y what saying so if God allows you to get sick what you going to say God why you let me get sick that ain't the way you answer God praise him you shake the devil up thank you Jesus you praise God for your being sick he said all things give thanks and when you do that you show God you trust amen yes Hallelujah yeah let me tell my testimony quickly is that all right yes because you know when they came to me excuse me I had a few troubles going on for maybe two years or so and uh I was concerned about it so I went to the doctor to see whether I can get some and uh the doctor said I think it was pts or whatever that level is and my blood was so low he said so high it was elevated I say so so high but it was elevated to signify that something was going on so he suggested that I go to this guy I forgot what they call what they call him I can't remember but nevertheless I had to who work with cancer of the prostrate and all that kind of stuff and he said the only way that we can really find out is that we do a biopsy right and so we went and I I wasn't certain about whether I wanted to do it or not I just knew one thing they ain't cutting on me and they ain't gonna do all those radiation stuff y'all hear what I'm saying I die like my mama my mama said the lord gave me this liver and if he don't heal it I'll die with it that's just the way I feel whatever he gave me if he don't heal it you see I'm not afraid of death since God saved me I'm not afraid of death Hallelujah so anyhow we we we went to the doctor and they did the biopsy and everything else and I noticed he stopped he was supposed to do he was supposed to clip 12 pieces and he only CLI like seven and he stopped so now that had me worried a little bit I never told I was concerned Why did he stop normally when they looking for something and they find something they stop because they don't want to make it worse y'all hear what I'm saying yes so that was my mind he he he didn't tell me but he it seemed like he that's how the devil fought my mind yeah oh yeah but I want you to understand when when that that man called me on the phone and said you got cancer he wasn't he been sparing me nothing you got cancer of the prostrate and it's aggressive and so therefore we need to do some some test on you to make sure it's not in your bones and all that you went through all the N yard and uh I was so shocked I started crying and uh my wife wasn't with me at the time and I started crying and called my daughter and she started crying and all the kind of stuff and I why I'm Not Afraid why am I crying the flesh amen amen no even Jesus wept you know he he wasn't afraid he knew already that Laz was coming forth say but that you and part so afterward I didn't feel so bad right and then my wife had already I think it was before then after whatever she told me she said God told me that you don't have no Cancer all right go with your [Applause] report if if the Lord my wife I don't have no C then I don't have it you know she said I know his [Applause] voice hallu you know my wife will sit like like a nothing to but don't mess with her husband and her children then you see Faith come to the for but you know what it was amazing don't usually V her opinion on certain things but she that's I just you know but I thought I changed my way of eating I start doing this and that getting you know and the ones who didn't have no faith in this daddy you know you need to do this you need do this this stop cancer this stop Cancer all this that and I was right into the groove of it then all of a sudden the light switch I said oh Ru I said I don't want to be eating like I got cancer right amen hear what I'm saying am glor saying thing and doing another I said Lord I don't want to be doing that so I started but stuff I want to eat that was rough so anyway by the grace of God we uh uh went went that way for a while and um we went went went back to the doctor to do all the scans and they put all that radioactive stuff in you and all that and that stuff affect you anyway I won give him glory but you know my point is this the doctor didn't know what to say but you know what I didn't go to the doctor in no morning's clothes I lost my last doter Lord I dressed up in my suit amen thank you Lord but God can keep you humble now come I'm feeling good then but what happened I did this thing with my Sho and I I put my shoe on and and I took it off like with my heel you know what I mean and I didn't even know Loos my heel from my shoe so I'm getting in the car and I'm going up to the I said you f my my left my shoe was off it was flipping and flopping you know walk into the doctor's office looking like this I said oh thank you Jesus keeping me Hum Hallelujah thank you Lord but we went inside looking and he everything he brought me and my wife was just he probably thought there are the tears there's he told us all the crazy things he could do I'm like to myself you're not talking to me that's right all right cuz I ain't going that way told I'm not going to take this all this radiation stuff and and only reason why I took the first is only to to get test made but I said no I ain't GNA do that the man didn't even know how to tell me or tell us he couldn't find nothing amen he went through every situation that is wasn't he even went I said well sir was it swollen he said no it's not even swollen amen hallelujah yeah oh come on somebody Place said you don't even have to come back let me say like thisise Lord I did not do it I didn't have to fast I didn't have to pray God dropped some faith in me I didn't even I KN y'all hear what I'm saying and when not I knew it something changed in me amen that's all I can tell you amen and I would not let a crack in my wall of Faith amise so my wife and I said well what we going to do we're not going to tell everybody we're just going to tell some people you know that we believe have faith you know what I mean and I said okay that wouldn't criticize because I didn't want everybody to you know I here go I had to tell somebody there in in Iowa City because I work with a group down there so I told one of the brothers who kind of help run it while I'm not there and uh I said well you know the doctor said you know I have cancer the prostrate I said I don't believe that he said but if you do have it God can heal you come on I didn't have it you see what I'm saying it was the devil trying to slip into a crack [Applause] that's take [Applause] the [Music] [Applause] speak to that Darkness y'all hear what I'm say I speak to that darkness and that Darkness had to [Applause] go you got speak to the not the teaching of Our Lord hallelujah he had the the children of the the the disciples with him on that boat he fell asleep and you know the story the storm came up and they they they awakened Jesus and said unto them care thou not that we perish why do you think Jesus had no idea that the storm was going to come but he was purposely doing [Applause] it amen God is always deliberate folks amen we may do things we don't mean to do but God needs everything he does y'all hear what I'm saying oh my God you got to understand like for instance I think Luke the first chapter Luke the fourth first chapter fourth chapter of Luke I believe it is six whichever it was but anyway here Jesus is into in the synagogue on the Sabbath day and now there come a man with a wed hand right and and all the Pharisees with their bad attitudes wonder whether he going to heal them on the Sabbath day right you think Jesus didn't hear yes that's right right Jesus heard what they said and Jesus didn't go over to the man with the withered hand and says no heal you he didn't do it guess what he did I want everybody toce hallu and he heal the the B said Jesus was angry angry at those heres and Sadducees because of their attitude he deler provoke [Applause] them hallu he didn't do it so whenever God does something he's always deliberate amen and when he allows something to happen to you he's always deliver is that okay nothing comes he taught us that by way of je God go fishing to get some troubles into your life amen oh my hallelujah amen yeah y'all think troubles just come God look at you say I know your heart and you doing pretty good going to stand under this tab I know you will but I I want

than you except Jesus amen amen just said amen yes sir yes sir the devil no there ain't no demon in hell that's higher amen you say what what do you mean because the Bible say he's giving him a name
