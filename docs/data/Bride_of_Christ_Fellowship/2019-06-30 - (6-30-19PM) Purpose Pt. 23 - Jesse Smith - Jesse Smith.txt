here by God's grace you need on your heart just making known unto the Lord here let's just pray together Heavenly Father we love you Lord you're the waymaker Lord the miracle worker even when we don't see it Lord you're working Lord just as we can look at every season of the year Lord and you're you're working changing the season Lord all the time father you just work behind the scenes Lord you're so great Lord God that you were caught in so many places simultaneously Lord God and you cannot be stopped Lord God you're unlimited in your power and we give you glory for that we thank you father for that in the midst of our trials and our tests even our own failures Lord you're using all that to teach us to wait upon you Lord God and teach us to trust you Lord God so we ask great Holy Spirit

our heart Lord and help us to receive the word now Lord God and may cause us to worship and sing and give you more praise and more glory to our great champion of love the Lord Jesus and father we'll give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name the church said hey may God bless you mean see the praise God so Lord willing we'll look forward to this message here tonight and then next Sunday brother Matt Leininger will be here I'll be out of town reaching for brother can and then doing a 40th wedding anniversary I don't know yes I'm oh and like still looking thank you appreciate that how could I forget that so yeah next week but I'm at Lightner we'll be here looking forward to that but I'll be out it's brother Brooks and his wife I don't know if I should say it over life you're my doubt they listen to my sermons but but we're gonna renew their vows next Friday in Lima it's a surprise to his wife so oh I doubt she listens to our sermons in it if she does boy am I in trouble I don't think she listed services so praise the Lord and I apologize if I if I made a mistake there so that's why I'm out you know it kind of worked out there's lots of different things going on so we had had to do that so let's look at purpose again tonight you know it was interesting you know I was out there talking to sister Brendan after service and the Lord's really done a great revival in her life since she started coming to church here and if you're not sure about just ask her about it she'll tell you God has done a great thing and anyways I was asking you know I was talking to out there and you know she just said during service this morning that you know Satan was saying you have no purpose you have no purpose and she said the Holy Spirit just rose up in her and said yes I do have a purpose you know and then she said I heard things this morning I've never heard in all my life you know and so so God was really speaking to her and helping her and so that was just an encouragement to keep in mind that you know Satan wants us to feel like we have no purpose he wants to take all of our hope but we have a Living Hope the Bible says we have a lively hope and there's one thing that we should never do is become hopeless because Jesus Christ is a Living Hope for us and so you know I look at I look at our dear sister you know and uh with Brenda and God has really redeemed her life God has done a tremendous thing in her life and so just be encouraged you know God has done great things for her and God is still encouraging her that every every part of life is a season and that's what the scripture that's what these first verses first eight verses tell us about that about there's a time and season for everything praise God there's a purpose under heaven for everything and then don't forget this I always pray this verse but verse 11 he's made everything he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end right we can't figure it out on everything he hides that so then we can have all eternity he can review all that his plan and purpose for everything you know we can see that so I want to just review here you can switch over lady I do have some some quotes here I want to share and since we got our visitors here I think I'll just quickly review what what the seasons are that we've been going over if I can just find them real quick real briefly here okay thank you so just real quick you know solomon lists 14 opposites and complementary seasons in Ecclesiastes 13 I'm sorry Calise a series 3 rather and it's a it's really 14 but then there's a pair for each of the 14 which makes 28 and then 28 is the number of days in a lunar cycle for the moon and the moon types the bride you know and then a woman has a cycle for 28 days so those are the two 28 that we can find in scripture I'm sure there's more but those are the ones we found so it speaks of life you know speaks of Hope and it speaks of you know cycles and seasons and that's what the Bible says so we've been looking at each one and and really what I've done in this message I've just with this series I've just taken inspiration like brother man taught go back to the concordance and I've searched out every word in the concordance there and so we can see there's a with borning born and being born and dying there there's the physical birth and death like brother branham born and died and we're appointed times to live the Bible said but then there's spiritual that that's also spiritual when you're born again is when you finally die out to yourself so it works out really good you know that with natural planting and plucking up that's like spring and fall but then there's spiritual times the Bible said we must plant and water but God gives the increase and then in Israel you know would be plucked up and planted you know back in the promised land and then within the natural God takes lives he spares lives there's medicine that kills and heals and then in the spiritual we must kill evil influences and healing begins and church problems are called like killing the Bible said in James chapter 4 so church fights are like killing people you know and sadly that's what people do they kill people's influence and that's a very sad thing to see but we don't want to do that but there are seasons we have to battle that have to overcome that then there are seasons of breaking down and building up in the natural like this the the the Temple in Jerusalem but in the spiritual we must build up strongholds of faith but also there's breaking down of strongholds which are complexes so there are seasons where they get built up but then they get torn down thank God for that there's seasons of weeping and laughing like in the natural you you're sad and then you're drooling full but in the spiritual like the weeping seasons our desperation where he crowd to God and the laughter seasons are the times when God answers the prayer thank the Lord praise God and then they're seen as a mourning which is like funerals and dancing or like it weddings but then there's scenes of ministry whether it's it's morning is like fasting and praying the Bible says that in Matthew chapter 11 Jesus's ministry was like a dancing ministry because Jesus said you know he said you're Mourning you know during John the Baptist ministry but then my ministry is like piping and dancing he's and so those are scenes of victory again after more so thank God for those and then casting yea casting and gathering stones was like building and tearing down physical structures but then the spirituals like restoring worship praise God so we saw that with Elijah restoring the altar you know he's restoring worship that's when we gather stones together gather revelations right and you you rece rebuild your worship you restore your worship praise God so now we'll go back up there to the eighth one I believe from last time let me just find that one real briefly and I just want everybody to see how scriptural that is because it's very scriptural way out tonight what I do with it oh here it is so the eighth one was a really good one - he's really plainly seen in Scripture there's a time to embrace and then a time to refrain from embracing you can see that in the natural with a husband and wife you know the Bible says they shouldn't come together if they're gonna pray you know and fast also with divided family members and church order issues there's times you know not to embrace if someone's preaching a false doctrine you know you don't let them in your house you don't embrace them you don't wish them Godspeed but then the spiritual there's a time to embrace wisdom right but there's times we're tempted to refrain from embracing the word right maybe we embrace you know things of the world too much we should be embracing God's wisdom so that just kind of catches you up real fast on the 22 previous sermons on this subject so we've been looking at that but let's look at I just want to read a few quotes I know this is really small so forgive me but brother Graham says I'm gonna skip down here times sake well Graham said you always have to stand this reproach in order to give your testing to see every man that comes to Christ must first be trial chain or child train rather for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember if you can just keep quiet he says and that's striking if you and I can just keep quiet in our suffering and not complain right because that's not so separated job from other people right job didn't charge God foolishly when he was tested right the three the three friends they you know they all said wrong things but job never say anything wrong he never charged God foolishly brother and said you can just keep quiet remember if he's called you for this whatever God's called you for there's nothing can keep it from happening there's not enough Devils and torment but what God's word will be made manifest you're born for a purpose and nobody can take your place a man I'll give you some hope tonight right nobody can take your place so you might have impersonators everything else but they'll never take your place right God's Word will triumph it cannot fail there's where every Christian ought to stand knowing that the trials will come up and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose it will all work out right now just look at my spot just for a moment let's say I never woulda came to Akron you know would there have been a church here I well God could have worked outside of that he could have raised up a church but what if I would have not take my place in my position see nobody can take my place right you to think about you and think about this you know the Bible said if there's no generation you have to you and I have to leave footsteps on the sands of time you know we don't know how long God's gonna tear like I said on Wednesday night God could come next year but God could come in a hundred years - we always have to live by confessing all of our sin and that makes us ready for the coming as long as I'm confessing out all the sin getting everything out of my heart and making sure I'm pure with God if I'm born again I'm always ready for the coming of the Lord but let's say God Terry's let's say let's say a hundred more years then we have a we are then our purpose is this God's ordained us to leave footprints for the next generation for little nature to raise up there you know virtue it'll eat in Genevieve you know Lily and James you know we got to leave footprints here for the next generation and so at the very minimum you should see that your purpose is to leave godly footprints on the sands of time praise God if God terry's but if not let me say like this too if not your footprints will lead up in the rapture right and then whoever's left will see your footprints and it may encourage your family members or foolish virgin whatever it is whoever doesn't go in the rapture your footprints left here after the rapture may encourage them get saved right and now we know the only way to be saved then is to give your life as a martyr to not take the mark of the beast but see even that your you have a place God's ordained you for a purpose and like I was telling sister Brenda a church he's been through some things but I told her I said she said you know she's bad with her purpose I looked at her and I said sister God has at least your very least of your purpose is to be a witness on the day of judgement for all those people that have experienced what you have but you've chosen not to be upset with God and you've chosen to take his word and rise above it amen praise God if the Queen if God was gonna raise up the Queen of Sheba all because of the mic she crossed the desert she cuz she want to know the truth of God how much more some of us who've gone through awful terrible trials in order got out so he could use us on the day of judgment amen as the witness that we're believers amen that's a very least the member garnet peak God let him get polio and die but still get the baptism of the Holy Ghost of 15 years old for two years no Ram said because I'm the damn judgment his witness would witness against that entire community amen God's gotta have a witness amen he's got to have a witness in Akron praise God a witness in your family a witness on your job God's got to have a witness so at the very least remember God has ordained you for that purpose and don't get discouraged he said just keep fighting just don't complain brother bang no no actually you need to say that to me don't complain mother Jessie don't complain because God has a purpose I'm just using him as an example he doesn't complain but I'm just using them as example we got to remind each other not to complain God helped me I don't want to complain I'm just laying a few quotes in here just to encourage you because memory even your life brother Ram says your life is just a season see you today that gives us a great testimony witness of God of creation that when we are in the season of mortal life raising your children marrying and bringing forth families this is a life or the season of mortal life this is just a season glory this time on earth is just a season we get a new body we get a new season amen oh that's gonna be a glorious summer day glorious season amen yes we get older we come down to the winter right I guess I guess eternal life would be a spring season then the new body would be the spring right because that's in the resurrection was in the spring so sorry now he talked about Edith right now either but this just changing he said every seven years your life changes so seven times seven you see it makes it kind of hard there's a complete change and it bothers the women nice talking about when you get to fifty here 49 you know seven times seven is forty-nine fifty you start he said change in your time of life men usually get a kind of a funny carrying on during that time and sometimes leave their wives but women are unfertile after that and then we all go through that we must remember that it's things that we must bear with one another and understand those things so you know every seven years I don't know if that's everybody but I was just thinking about that a little bit you know because really once you turn 34 you've actually started now you start your 35th year right yes because when you turn one you've already had one complete year and now you're starting your second year so I was thinking about what happened when I was 34 brother Amen came in the church see God knows something great every seven years it was I went back inject so I you know my next one is 42 so I'm coming up on 13 almost be 39 pretty soon here so I just thought that was interesting you know I just thank the Lord for His mercy sewed up back to brother branham he said I've been a neurotic all my life as a little boy there was something struck me that scare me about every seven years who had happen to me the jack remembers come off the field something just happened and that was he now look not only did his stomach get sour but he said mental oppression and he said you don't know what I've suffered just mental oppression every seven years it's come all my life that's where I'm at now seven eight so 56 so this is on the wings of a snow white dove this and testified that that squirrel died you know that the demonic squirrel looking thing it came out it died but I just want to show you this it wasn't just the natural but it was the spiritual as well God let him suffer every seven years but then God brought the victory okay so I just want to bring these out just this just to encourage you know no matter where you are you look to God for victory it's a season right you look through the season praise God there there'll be an end to that season hallelujah now I didn't get to that one but there's a quote about cycle and death I didn't get to that one so I'm gonna preach on that in the future let me do it just a couple more now this was right after brother Branham got through the season of being interviewed by the FBI I'm sorry the IRS remember he was he had all those tax cases but I like this because it shows brother Branham was looking forward to revival I'm looking for this week to revival in my own soul I told my wife yesterday when I'd heard some News and rushed over there through my arms router and screamed now I'm free see the IRS had told him he only had to pay $40,000 and brother Dow was gonna pay for it cuz he was a millionaire so God sent a millionaire in the profits Church to pay for this fee he could never pay for it Satan thought oh I'll get him with forty thousand dollars so God said I think I'll save a ninety-year-old film with the Holy Ghost and set him in the church who's a millionaire to pay that debt for the profit ha ha hey man I like that thought he pulled a fast one on him but God said no I'm gonna save a millionaire and send it right into by the Rams Church to pay this bill off but God let him suffer though he said I'm free I went to the room and started weeping and said you know I want to God to give me a revival in myself for about five years I've been choked out under a great burden that's been released now and I thought oh my I'm going to brother Jackson's have all the people pray for me that I'll have a revival down to myself I really need it I think we all feel a whole lot that way so I just want to encourage you brother Branham saw seasons in his life and this is scriptural we all go through scenes of our lives and this is we'd say a shorter season he said about five years when he finally got this case solved in the IRS so just be encouraged whatever you gone through there will be an end to it by God's grace God is gonna bring you out of that season because that's what it's all about it's all about season it all becomes beautiful in God's time now I want to encourage you too that God would give you scenes of glory so right after brother Ram preached the future home he said last Sunday I spoke at the future home and I think we're about 1,500 square miles around and it happened to be exactly the measure the city I was speaking about fifteen hundred square miles I've been feasting on that ever since so he goes through like a week or two of just feasting on the revelations see so God gives you mountaintop experiences praise God he'll speak something will be such a revelation and you'll go for two or three weeks all that one sermon see God will just plant something in your heart and he'll rejoice in that for a season praise God he said now why was he feasting on it because he knew that when this life is over I'm going to that City amen so it really made the future home a reality praise God so we feast see we feast on these messages that we hear because it's God's Word to us it's God's thus saith the Lord to us now I read that one recently - when he got the sword in his hand and he saw the seven angels it made him feel like he was first saved so some of those experiences will revive you you know in a new season of life and make you feel like you did when you first got saved praise God praise God oh my thank the Lord okay so that's now let's look at the night season I promise I won't preach as long as I didn't want to preach about an hour and 45 minutes this morning under that great anointing but let's look here let's look to the night season and maybe we'll start the 10th for a few minutes please so in the natural there's a time to get and then a time to lose in the natural now this could be financial gains and losses it can be material possessions just think about natural things you get things you lose I even thought just now I didn't write it down but I thought about with children - you know there's time to get children time to lose children family members you know you get family members you lose family members I should have wrote what I could write that down after the service so there's a time to get things but then there's a time to lose them as well so let's look at some scriptures about that but then the spiritual here's where it'll impact you and I at the most where we'll see this the most often is we get divine blessings like we just heard but then if we're not careful we can lose them - okay now let me say this - god works God works within the permissive will of God in other words God knows that we're gonna we're gonna fall short we're gonna stumble we're gonna make mistakes but God is patient with us in the midst of our mistakes so God knows we're gonna fall but then he's gonna bring the season around to raise us up again like in other words God wasn't surprised when brother Graham lied to the IRS God knew there be an end of that and he get revived at the end of that right to see God works within our faults to Humble us right and draw us closer to him that we might have another season of gain and see them the next time around where were tested will overcome that will overcome the temptation a lot will overcome the temptation to gossip right or overcome the temptation to fear or to be greedy or will overcome that the next time but then we'll have another season where we got to be tested again see because seasons exposed trials expose our weaknesses right like job said you know the things that I feared have come upon me so see God new job had that insecurity that fear so God had to allow all these things that happen but then the end of it job comes out he says I know when I come out I'll come forth as gold and so that's what that's what we're seeing is in these 14 or 28 seasons that's what we're seeing God uses the cycle of all these seasons to mold us and to shape us in other words like the moon to help us reflect the full light of Christ amen because that's the purpose of a moon right is to reflect all the light of God of the Sun amen and like I heard it say on the sermon with that all's God wants to do is find some moon dust to reflect off of that's a God he was just a shy to reflect off this flesh praise God he just wants to find somebody he can reflect his light off of she so we're getting down to the the we're past the halfway point we're getting close to the end of this series here but then as I said I want to get to the part of on spiritual gifts so my whole purpose in this seasons and purpose series is so everybody can have a replication of you're getting your purpose in life and then you can invest in that because remember program said he said don't you know there'll be degrees in heaven so Christians who are more devoted to their purpose or more devoted will have more responsibility and more rewards in heaven and not that we're trying to get it but church if God give me something on this earth I want to use it all to his glory like if God gave you a job wouldn't you want to do a good job a half-hearted job or a job that was all you had amen see I see we're not doing it for rewards but we're doing it to glorify our king amen praise God that's why we do it so there's degrees in heaven just like there's degrees in Hell right remember Jesus said you're Pharisees he said your condemnation will be greater than theirs because you had the word you had the key of knowledge but you shut them out and you didn't enter in and you kept people from entering into the promises of God so your condemnation will be greater so see just like there's the Greece in hell there's degrees in heaven so we want to be faithful in the midst of our seasons now let's look here so here's a season where you get financial assets and I think I'll share one personally here tonight that I've never shared before but he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity so like rich people they'll never be they'll never feel like they have enough money we're all you know middle class poor but we still have to battle that right but see even the rich they'll never be happy with that now this is this is really good too when goods increase their increase that eat them and what good is there to the owners there of saving to be holding of them with their eyes so like let me just use my life as an example as my family has increased God has increased my wages on my job and then he's also increased my wife's business like it's and we my wife and I talk about all the time it was just God God did it yes so see when goods increase there and then now there's was that need to eat more food on the table right there there's more mouths to eat more food so God had to raise our income so we could buy more food to feed our little babies there but he's the one that sent him to us so he's faithful to take care of him and I don't think I've ever shared this before I'm just gonna share it now so back in 2015 when we moved in here the only reason we could afford this church is because we had all those families move in from Albion and we had a family a couple other place up north and God said all these families in here and it was right at the time when we needed it to and gotten so now we have you know we got rescued from that place that you know when we left there the ceiling was caving in because of water damage I don't even know if they have people there renting it out anymore but we were just about done with that place we're gonna have to get somewhere so God sent those families in there to provide us a new place of worship it's a much better place and then also don't provide I do use a little more of the ties to pay for my children's food you know you know and all the expenses and I and then and then a lot of them left and then God said it some more you know that's just and you know years and years later I can look back now and say what was God doing God was sending because we're having an increase of in our family and God help provide for everything there's a season to gain and a season to lose we have we're almost filling up that church that that sanctuary over there and now we you know we never fill up this place but that's okay but I just looked at it as that was a season that was just a time and season and God had orchestrated it at all so I thank the Lord for that there's a time to get and then a time to lose and I just want to encourage you search God will provide for you because you're better than birds you're better now that just make that blesses my heart jesus said take no thought for your life what you shall eat don't worry about your grocery bill what you'll drink your body what you don't worry about all the fancy clothes is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment he said behold the fowls of the air they don't so they sow not neither do they reap neither they gather barns yet your heavenly Father feeds them he said are you not much better than they aren't you better than the birds aren't you better than all these all these little animals out there you're better see why because you're in the image of God and if God takes care of those that are in the image of beasts and foul how much morally take care of those who are in his own image so I just want to encourage you there's a time and season you know there's a season to have a little less there's a scene that have a little more but God's in the midst of all of it which of you taken thought can add one cubit to his stature see we worry about things right we just worry worry but Jesus says don't worry there's a time and season for everything and well I take you thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow and they toil not there do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which is today is and tomorrow's cast in the oven shall he not much more clothe you O ye of little faith and how many would say Amen tonight and say Lord increase my faith amen that's what I would say the Lord increase my faith because I'm better you said it I'm better than the birds now they still glorify God but God says we're better therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or what show where we shall we be clothed for all these things of the Gentiles seek for your father knoweth heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof now we see people many times you know that then I'll get in a financial bind and they'll they'll stop coming to church right or they'll stop putting God first but what does God say remember you're better than those birds they don't even plant yet I provide for them just put God first and I'll provide everything you need see and that's faith and then God will honor your faith God God will use these seasons to test your faith in order to build your sea but what did you want to see once to see somebody that will put him first and the kingdom of God and His righteousness and I'll add all things unto you you're better amen and I'm not trying to make you feel prideful I just want to let you know you're better than the birds you're better in God's eyes Jesus says you're better amen now the Bible said there's a season to get loose so here wisdom is the principal thing now let's get to the spiritual therefore get wisdom with all thy getting get understanding so the getti means to acquire or possess so when the Word of God is being preached or when we hear the preaching we've got to rest that and say that that word that promise is mine I'm gonna keep that I'm gonna possess that I can't let it go over my head I can't forget about it like a forgetful here I gotta be a true here and I have to become that word I've got to possess that word I've got to believe that word that this is your season to get it amen there's a season to get it and you got to possess that like we see that song rise possess your inheritance amen this is the year of Jubilee now how do wisdom you get it by see the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh that knowledge so there's if you're in a season to get then that season is the season to seek God and it's the same word acquire and possess so brother Jesse I'm in a season getting I want to get more with God okay then you got to see God that means you have to you have to draw nigh to God and then God will draw nigh to you there's a season for that right and I love it too the Bible said this season is getting it is like buying it so the Bible said by the truth and don't sell don't lose it a man there's a season to get the season a little but the Bible said by the truth sell it not also wisdom and instruction understanding so there's a season for this we want to buy it purchase it make a sacrifice to get it and don't sell it out now here's what I was saying was it last week yeah it was last week but I already had this on my notes before brother Keith preached I already had this in my notes to preach so we need strength to be content in all seasons and this is what Paul showed us that's why that's why I cleese ask these three is so inspired because we could see Paul going through that season Paul's basically saying here I went through a season where I got and I went through a season where I lost but I still praise the Lord in all of it that's why that book is so inspired Solomon was so inspired to write about all those seasons because we can find all these seasons in the Word of God he said I rejoice in the Lord greatly and now at the last of your care of me have flirts again wit and you were also careful but you lacked opportunity not that I read in respect to want for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content now I'm not going to read this but did you know when Paul was writing this the only church that met his needs was the Philippians no just heard about Paul being in prison poem president nobody reached out to the Prophet prison except those Philippians I don't know brother bang but I believe there's a great reward for them don't you know all the churches you know remember at the end of his ministry he said all the ages rejected me a lot of churches were rejected him but the Philippians for some reason God records them Paul said you're the only ones who met my need and the actually the Bible does say why Paul says because so you'll have rewards in heaven that there'll be rewards added to your account in heaven so see brother brother Mike that means God will let you and I go through times where we don't have much and the whole purpose of it is so that God will anoint somebody else to meet your needs God can reward them later on amen what do we feel like oh I feel God I don't have much money this season my life I'm so discouraged but the whole time you don't even know that's God's season to anoint somebody else to help you out and then reward them in heaven we think did I sin against you god was it me now if your sin and stop sinning but if you're not sitting and it's just a season that God is allowed then praise the Lord then God has used this season to bless somebody else and I'm gonna read that so I'm gonna keep reading this but I'm gonna go in Philippians in my Bible so he so he learned in any season to be content I know both how to be abased humbled and I know how to abound they know how to be really humble but also increase really well spiritually I know how to have these mountaintop seasons everywhere and at all things I'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me praise God now like I said last week Church you and I rarely have to deal with this so we have to make an attempt to fast right we have to die fast on Wednesday I don't know if I don't know which day you fasted but I fasted Wednesday before preaching but see we don't really know to see you brother Mike we got all these blessings well we don't struggle with starvation but we've got it still we have to we have to deny ourselves in order to be more spiritual because if not you've all seen people that let themselves go spiritually and usually when they let themselves go spiritually they let themselves go as well naturally as well which means they eat too much they sleep too much they get lazy they don't work they don't work as hard as they should you've all seen it right I see it quite often like for example I know people that from other churches that I've talked to over the years like that he's good brother but he got addicted to diet coke and he gained a lot of weight and he couldn't he couldn't even walk up stairs at work and the one day the Holy Spirit told him stop drinking diet coke he stopped drinking diet coke and now I can walk up the steps again and he lost all that way and he he testified in front of everybody about it so you see like so we have a responsibility to take care of these temples amen and so now so he's got a he's not gonna be hungry but you know you know his flesh is gonna want that diet coke but he's got to crucify that desire so he know what's the key word he's got to learn he's got to learn it the look to deny yourself in laodicea right you have to learn to do that yeah I talked to numerous brothers that'll have back pain or they'll have headaches and it's all because they're overeating they're not exercise they're not taking care of themselves Church we have to do that right we have to do that because if not if we're if we're putting too much in then our body's gonna suffer body's gonna suffer but Paul because he was in prison yes he went through times of hunger but see we're not we're not suffering with that right now we have to make sure we are temperate the Bible said we're temperate in some things all things seen with coffee I have to be can have to be temperate with coffee right you have to be tempered with sugar and to be tempered with fast food you'll be tempered with chocolate yeah you have to be temper with all things don't let anything mask you just be mastered by Christ amen because the Bible said you can't be addicted to one thing and that's serving the Saints there's one time the Bible says the word addiction and that's addicted to serving the Saints that's ought to be addicted to you amen I get a spirit rush a spirit of high every time I serve the Saints hey glory that's what we need to be addicted to praise God but let me read that before I forget just so you can see and church yeah let me be out I'll just let me tell this to I'm just gonna tell it while I'm here I was going through a real bad financial season when I was doing my master's degree plus 30 a few years ago and I'm just gonna tell it because I'm I feel like I'll just tell it tonight I was really low on money you know I yeah we went through three years where we never got a pay raise at school so our contract froze it was right after a 2008 that market crash in 2008 and I hope I was really going I couldn't pay for this this cut this class I was taken and Paula Fontaine sent me a check in the mail for $1,000 yeah and it paid for that college course that's why when I was over there I told the Saints I said I said I told his church I said you know most of you I don't I don't know mostly I said bye I know one thing I said your pastors been a real friend to me yeah I said I'm not gonna say it but I started crying you know I was telling that but I said there was times when I really needed it in god anointed him to help me now I had to get in a really low spot but if you look at yeah it's actually verse 15 and 16 now he Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only so God almost that all the other churches get kind of busy doing other things except the Philippians there's in verse 16 for even in Thessalonica ye said once and again unto my necessity so twice twice the Philippians heard about the prophet needed food or clothing and sent it and then in verse 17 not because I desire gift he said see who who here likes to come and ask for help does anyone like to ask for help no it actually embarrasses me doesn't it dude it embarrasses me when I have to ask somebody for help right especially financial help that's the most embarrassing to me and so Paul says you know I wasn't as you know I didn't ask you guys for help because I desire to get gifts he said I desire fruit that may abound to your account and so I look and look back at my life now and I had a thousand dollars to pay off on my class I didn't have I didn't have the money so God God let me get in a time to lose God let let me get in a short time said he can anoint brother Paul to send me that money to meet my need now I believe it I believe it has great rewards in heaven that brother now like that but he's a he another pastor are paying to put the message in Spanish I think they're gonna finish up this year next year all the sermons in Spanish are now translating the message that's really unselfish that's really unselfish that's a really godly thing to do so I want to just show that they're their strength for all seasons and then God may let you go through a season of loss anoint somebody else to help you out that they'll have treasure in heaven now church when Paul got saved he lost everything so there was a season he lost everything but he gained Christ yeah doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've suffered so it wasn't easy to suffer the loss of all things so Paul lost his financial help right no doubt Paul was you know he was of the stock of Benjamin the Pharisee of Pharisees no doubt he is his retirement has already paid for right he had everything lined up he didn't have a wife or children he had all this and here they had basically just as a priest he had all this lined up but he left it all he suffered the loss of everything why that I might win in Christ amen there's a season for that and I do count them but dung that I may win Christ Jesus there's a season to lose but there's also a season to gain to gain Christ praise God it was a suffering it wasn't easy church it wasn't easy when my best friend emailed me when I heard the message and said the devil's shown you those things it wasn't easy to lose my best friend because I told him I said you've been the best friend I've ever had and then he said the devil showed me these things it wasn't easy not easy to have your mom rebuke you you know like my mom rebuked me and all these preachers and everybody rebuking you and no longer they know not to call you they no longer texting no longer ask how you're doing they don't that that they separate them set it's never easy it's suffering but you win Christ amen glory now with a statue for four men their seasons to get right because the Bible said giving all diligence ad in the seasons where you get remember you've got to show diligence you've got to see God during these these seasons so Paul Peter said use all your diligence which is your earnest effort all your effort that you can muster up if this is a season for you to get up spiritual blessing then you've got to put all your effort into it for things be in you and abound or increase they make you that you should be neither barren nor unfruitful so if you're in a season of getting spiritual blessings then you're putting all your effort into it and then things are gonna just be growing in your life like let me just share a testimony real quick okay not for me but for brother Aaron last week you saw he came right and as his family members were here when I was outside I was Charlie trying to talk to his family member about some some things about a home church and yeah and I said I said I said brother I said your brother has grown tremendously since he started coming to home coming here to make this his home Church and his family member without it just interrupted me and said yes I've seen a major change in my brother in the last year Church you start adding the word and you start obeying all the word about having a home church and paying ties and obeah faith with the Word of God God is going to add these things in you and you're gonna abound and then the people in your family the people in our families our church members are gonna see the growth of Christ in our lives amen and so I shared that with brother Aaron as an encouragement and that's when you know you really be ought to be encouraged when your family members see you're growing amen because they see your spots but they also see your best buds amen that's what that testimony that Barrett brother Aaron's family and I'm talking to his dad a few were last month was earlier this month about three weeks ago and we were talking about how he puts all those stickers on his car you know and he wears all those Jesus shirts and I said I really appreciate how Aaron does that and his dad kind of leaned back and he was real serious he said yeah every Christian should be like that now not that you have to wear shirts but I was just talking about about witnessing and being bold about Christ and so I told Aaron about that too I said your dad knows you're living the right kind of life see when God is adding to you it abounds in you and people will see the growth in your life again now this is the same thing with Paul but he that findeth his life shall lose it so see I see I took the concordance and look up blues there's a season to get and loss getting loose so see you find these as use the concordance that way so when you find that you get it but then when you get it you lose it and he that lose his life for my sake shall find it amen now this is the I think even this applies even after you get saved I for example once you realize what gift you have you can forsake all your other time and invest in your gift your gift things in your life praise God now we're getting down to and here I believe yeah it's about good it's about an hour and races are okay now here let's look at the lost part now this is the lost part and I got at one scripture if you got your Bible turned not to this but turn to 1st Thessalonians 4 I'm that's the scripture not I don't want to forget 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 1 but I want to look at this thought about gaining and losing spiritually a little bit deeper here because this is how you lose now David lost a right spirit so before this David spirit was right I'm gonna choose the word I'm gonna follow the word under God's Word but he lost the right spirit he got a wrong spirit and the joy he lost the right spirit and joy through lust murder and adultery now if you remember this I preached us why go but it came back to me fresh he was supposed to be out battling with the kings in church you and I supposed to be battling in prayer amen because the Bible said when you got on the full armor of God you're praying with all prayer and all supplication ain't it to see when we're in a season of prayer when we're in the Battle of prayer we won't go looking for other things to fulfill up because we're busy fighting amen that's not what every season I want to be laid at the altar in every season of my life I want to be right there at the battle praise God but see he LUT he didn't recognize this or he didn't recognize the season is that what the Bible actually says let me look that up real quick I think that's uh ii samuel 11 if that says season boy i'll tell you i'm not sure like that welllike says yeah at that time when the keys go to battle so then say season were says at that time it was a time for battle but he chose other words he chose not to pray I'm making it for our day this is the topic we pray pastors asking us to pray pastors asking us the fast or the Holy Spirit's ask me to pray well then you should pray that's the time to pray but David page still at Jerusalem so David Terry's right he waits out he sits out says I'm not gonna obey yet and when that unless first he saw her bathing bring it over to me committed adultery and then murder flowed out of that and then when he when the Prophet corrects him he says created me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me so he lost the right spirit he needed it renewed cast me not away from your presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore to me the joy of thy salvation so he lost it there's a time to get there's a time to lose now why do you lose it because he was in the battle he wasn't in the battle and we got to keep battling for souls praise God really Church you know the rapture could be so close that the last ones were praying for is these children to get the Holy Ghost so James are really praying for you get the Holy Ghost when you're like five years old if he's the last one but in all reality you know he may be live to be a hundred but that's where we're look that's why we look at some of these things right we don't know the timer season so we got to always be in the battle always got to be battling in prayer god save what you can God search my heart cleanse my heart keep me pure stay in the battle prayer a fully armored Christian will be praying always and all prayer amen and for me this is my prayer meeting church every Sunday morning every Wednesday night half hour before church that's my prayer meeting I'll try to to keep myself in the Battle of Prayer to keep myself there battling coming against the you know of course every morning in the prayer closet to like this morning you know but just stay in the Battle of Prayer and if you do that God will reward you openly so he lost it he lost the right spirit and he lost joy he lost it a see loose or else can one not here's how we lose now this is the extreme this is the extreme like demon-possession where you need a demon cast out but that's most of them for most of us that that that won't happen to us because we want to let that many demons come in okay when to enter in a strong Mans house and spoil rob is goods because the thief comes to steal kill and destroy except his first bind the strongman so Satan will paralyze your strength and then he'll spoil the house he'll you'll lose from your your human spirit you can't touch your soul because the Holy Ghost is there but see this is how we lose we let the devil get in and he takes some of our joy he takes some of our peace it makes us nervous now for most of us this is how Satan gets in not demon possession but just like a wrong anointing right just as we get the wrong anointing in our human spirit we don't get possessed there where they live there and they won't move without you know casting them out he said be angry and sin not let not the Sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil so you go to bed angry by a man or I go to go to bed angry you gave place to the devil you're gonna wake up pretty bad wake up in a bad place you just lost your victory Paul says don't give a place to Satan that's in your mind go to bed angry of course to the people it can be the same for any sin you go to bed lustful right go to bed greedy you go to bed tired you not sorry hope you're tired you go to bed lust thing you know something like that you give a place that's how we lose we don't cast down those imaginations right and the Bible said you can even lose your first love nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left your first love you left it behind you you lost it right you you you're not with it right you you should be with your first love right in this place of spiritual revelation like we said it's important you're in a place of spiritual rubber you dig deep enough till you're in the spirit of Revelation but you let we leave that right we leave that in times and seasons of our lives so the only way to get back is remember where you were falling from repent and do the first works or else our company quickly and remove thy candlestick out of this place except thou repent praise God you have to remember your first works what did I do in that fresh season of victory what I knew in that season where I bound and I was yet to go do those first works go do those first works now we went through this and then we but the brother preached on the last week about program he lost the feeling of the people that's because he got angry if they won't hear my message then I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm not gonna preach to them anymore so brother Rams are looking at the results and he saw more people cutting their hair more men you know marrying 3-4 times he said if they're not gonna listen to me fine I'm not gonna preach anymore he lost the feeling he had for the people see he got his eyes on the ones that were rejecting it instead of his eyes and the ones that were receiving it god help us to keep our eyes on the ones who are receiving it amen other than yeah we can't be discouraged by those people follow away it's their choice right we've got to choose to stay faithful we've got to choose to abound in the things of God now like this here I like this program said Satan the first thing he bites off is your brotherly love so remember this hatch riverman charities the Holy Ghost but what he'll start doing to get you to lose is to bite your brotherly love first so it's like it's like he God builds you up you get capped but then he'll start you know you'll never lose your cat but Satan starts biting your brotherly kindness away he started to remember brother Hammond could you can lose some of that right but BAM lost his self-control lied to the IRS you know he he lost that self-control that temperance he said let's get a big picture of God's treats bearing nine spiritual gifts they're healing the sick they're speaking in tongues they're casting out Devils they're doing great works and preaching the unadulterated Word of God no denomination to tie them down they're free doing a great work so income this little devil sitting up in his two horns sitting out in front like a grasshopper you know and is it an old greedy teeth that's his first Apollo room he come in to eat off brotherly love he said you know did you know so-and-so did such so-and-so's Church I wouldn't believe that bunch of people see there he is the first thing so see we got to make sure we talk good about everybody if somebody sins hide it from everybody right hide it actually want to eat the fruit of faith faith in the word now look how do you know that's the word it's been translated so many times well now we know from this morning we got the right scrolls amen men have died for these scrolls amen that little devil sitting eating right that has words been translated so many times he's this or he's at the other oh he's all this see now that's another fruity eat off the joy of salvation Shh you people make too much noise oh my mother says you're jazz many times seen in how loud you are not always but sometimes they see cuz there's other quotes brother Ram sent a wheelbarrow squeaks when it's empty but when you load it up with good things you don't hear the squeaks anymore so you got to bounce it out you know but man said the greatest things like the world's all the rotations they do you know thousand miles per hour they're rotating they don't make any noise while they're doing it brother Han says sometimes great things don't make any noise so we find out he took away the joy you know David one time lost the joy of his salvation he didn't lose his salvation he just lost the joy of it he just cried Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation see the joy this little ole Palmer begin to eat that fruit of joy out now lookie here you people make too much noise I tell you all this crying to say an amen the shouting that's nonsense there's nothing to that see first thing you know he's sent in a big more you know set there all them dead large hungry dead churches that we walked into lately right you visit other places you go different places well we don't want this place to be dead amen we got to keep our joy the joy of our salvation hallelujah don't be afraid about making noise amen and church there's been times where I've been so discouraged and I didn't realize so after shouting or screaming or crying that's when I got the victory back it's like Satan was trying to keep me so quiet and keep my joy from coming out but once I got the joy I felt so much better amen he's trying to quiet those pricks because God lives in the praises of his people amen the Lord inhabits the praises of his people Israel amen he God lives in the praise that's right some of these embalming fluids have so-called doctored and Creed's pumped up in their veins where the Spirit of God out to be running where the old church Creed pumped in there no wonder that icy cold and dead spiritual thermometer 90 below zero and church this is a Easter message - this is the Easter message cuz I listen to this a few weeks ago I was mowing the grass I thought he preached a restoration of bright tree and was just saying dry bones amen well praise the Lord there's two confirmation they met I supposed to preach us tonight glory yeah somebody say Amen everybody stretched their neck around like some kind of goose or something want to know what they said it's a shame when the Spirit of God ought to be joy peace and love but this little bug start to eat on it he eat all the joy away oh thank you Jesus give us joy the Holy Ghost amen now this is the next thought he uses and this is why I told you to turn the first stone so let's close with this here's how you get it back let me say like this search God wants our seasons of losing our joy and losing our he wants those to be as short as possible because let me tell you Church it's the will of God for you to be sanctified right clean that it's God's will that you're clean all the time look at 1st Thessalonians 4 1 so God and that's how brother grams IRS thing that didn't last very long and the only less like a couple maybe a day or maybe less than that because he went to pray for somebody in the Holy Spirit don't put your filthy or don't put your line hands on that so he went to pray God forgive and then come back and prayed God wants our seasons of this obviously very short but course it's up to us how long we remain in those things sometimes sometimes first Thessalonians 4 verse 1 now this is the rapture chapter so he starts the rapture chapter off by saying walk in sanctification a state they divide Amen see you keep your whole body clean so that God's filling you all the time you're full your soul filled with oil all the time that you go up in the rapture amen because you're filled with the Holy Ghost all the time walk in the spirit verse 1 furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk him to please God so you would abound more and more so now means to be fruitful so be more fruitful in how you're walking with the Lord be more and more fruitful more and more abounding verse 2 for ye know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus so now it's a command brother Mike I think it's a suggestion it's commanded and Jesus church he won't give you a you and I command if we can't keep it right God's not gonna give us a requirement if he won't make a way for us to achieve it right so verse 3 for this is the will of God even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication see so the sanctification is the will of God for all times and seasons then every one of you should know how to possess his vessel and Saint vacation and honor not in the lust of concussions even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter so see this is more than just sexual purity this is in everything be Saints keep a sanctified vessel at all times so you don't sin against anyone well you got brotherly kindness amen the bug don't eat away your brotherly kindness so you're good at all times so our men and women yes because that the Lord is the Avenger of such see tonight as we also have forewarned you and testified forgotten that called us to uncleanness but unto holiness now with that in mind that that's why I said that in every season god it's will for you to come out of any sin in every season because it's God's will that you don't have any of his vengeance upon your life and here's where brother man says it in the restoration of the bride tree so right after he says you can lose your joy he tells you you got the right to go get it back around said enforce she said we have the privilege to enforce upon sin the claims that God give us for God has in law and his word is the law and God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back and Satan has to do it because we can take God's age in the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus sayeth the Lord amen so see listen if you're defrauding someone or you hurt somebody you don't have to remain in that the Bible said it's not God's will for you to hurt anybody in any manner or have any sexual sin in any manner at any time you can say Satan I'm coming out of this lust I'm coming out of this bad habit and you I enforce by the Holy Spirit that you give back my sanctification you get back my holiness amen get back my joy bring back my peace I'm enforcing it because it's God's will and I do it amen praise God now you can't always do that with healing right you can't always do that with salvation but you can do that with sanctification but it's God's will for you to enforce it that you'd afford not anybody that you live a sanctified life it's the will of God amen this is the will of God as Jesus said man shall live by what every word it's God's will it's God's will now for us to do miracles all the time although we do that at times but it's God's will that we keep all the Word of God at all times that's this perfect will we can choose the permissive or the perfect and this is what Brennan tells us we have a right to enforce it we can take but like Graham says the police you can take the police officer if somebody's in your house because they don't you got you got the title deed right you got you can say that I bought this my house policemen are gonna drive them out and program says the same thing he's Satan's got to give it up because the Holy Spirit's there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce its by the land for the land he said but the law of the Spirit of God is before Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God souls of men he took from God souls of women children sickness of the body placed upon people where God made them in His image to be like him and the church is given the right for legal rights by the Bible to take the holy spirit and enforce this upon them hey man yeah now the only exception is like when Paul said God take these things from my eyes you know I'm buffing it was say and God said my grace is sufficient but see God still answered him right he's trying to take the Holy Spirit and force it but the Holy Spirit said no this is to humble you but he still tried to enforce it amen that's why we still try to pray for those that are sick those that are lost we keep praying and say let him go Saint let him go we don't know right with let us say the Lord we don't know but we keep trying to do it because one of these times it's gonna be the right time in season amen one of these times God will and force that command upon somebody amen one of these times that God will enforce the claim that work that we're claiming right God will enforce it it might be something God put a curse upon okay that's somebody right a few weeks ago there's times we don't take it off but that's where we got to make sure we ask before we I'm right there's times it might because you might get in trouble with God like like Moses smite she got in trouble with God he should not have done that that was against the Word of God so we have to make sure that before we take something off we ask the person about it all right so the thing to do is wait till you find the cause so many times in prayer we gotta make sure we find the cause of people's sins the cures already perfect if you can find the cause get rid of the kansai like if a car is laying somewhere like a piece of corn and a stick is laying over to make a girl just move this thick and it'll go straight that's the same thing it is see you've got to find the cause first find out what's making it do this now remember when that maniac fell over bow Rams feet the police said then when he fell down the police said it is he dead and RAM said no sir he said is he going to be all right he said no sir he worships that spirit now it's interesting Church is that when when when when Broder have said Satan come out of him Satan left him but the demons were still in him some demons were still in him because but I said Satan leave him Satan left but then the men the policeman asked is he all right he said no he still worships that spirit he thinks he's right if he's willing to give it up it would leave him now praise God but he worships it see so see brother Ram couldn't enforce the full cleansing of that man because he loved it but brother him could enforce his protection on the field he can enforce and say Satan leave him you're not gonna kill me you're six foot six or whatever you are you're not gonna kill me I enforced the claim of God's Word amen but he couldn't make those other demons leave because the man loved it so see you have to be careful how we enforce God's Word all right we'll stop right there let's say into our feet here what a wonderful time and the Lord had spent today how many enjoy the word tonight let's get a little round applause praise God thanks a lord next time we'll look at keeping and casting away the Bob's had cast your bread upon the waters toes he's more about saving and giving there's more season about saving and giving you got to cast it away cast it on the water have you ever put bread on the water have you ever fed ducks out in the water don't you feel like you're kind of wasting it you know like it gets all soggy but you know the Bible says cash right up on the water looks like I'm giving up all this what's gonna happen but God said it's going to come back to you it's going to come back how many witness to that and then we'll get to it next time Lord willing we keep the victory but there's times we fall short and we the Bible said cast not away your confidence but your Sisson there sometimes we cast away right Abraham cast it away he should have confidence I couldn't tell the Pharaoh she's my she's my wife because God will back me up but brother Brett but but brother Abraham cast it away and he lied and God was still merciful to him he did it twice God was still merciful because he was his prophet does he we go through seasons where we keep and cast away how many we've got to help you tonight God will help you let's get back this one God will help you if you've lost your joy if you've lost anything let's make this the season to get it back let's bow our heads musicians why'd you come here let's pray about that enforcing quote I think that's beautiful let's pray about that by God's grace we don't want anyone to leave here without getting the victory praise God there's there's never a sin Church that is the perfect will of God brother BAM even said in garna me and that was the permissive will of God God's perfect will was to bring forth children through spoken word so that teaches us every sin we do is the permissive will of God and God would rather have us get the victory that means our seasons of losing can be shorter we just kind of obey sooner it's always God's will to be sanctified it is always God's will to keep the Word of God and you can enforce that we can enforce that tonight I'm going to go back to that quote just so I can read it again you know as I pray here in just a moment [Music] such a beautiful quote wasn't at church when it's attributed but ma'am said you can take the age and the Holy Spirit go right down on your knees see you have to go up to the altar just go down on your knees pray and say it's thus saith the Lord Satan's got to give it up it's the law of the land to enforce let me say this it's a law heaven to enforce its heavens law to
