[0:23] 4 ver8 so as we preached and we looked
[0:25] at on Sunday James 1 is for us as
[0:28] genuine Believers that are living San

[0:33] other uh awful things we see in the
[0:35] scripture there by God's grace Idols uh
[0:38] things like that really awful sins uh
[0:41] that's chapter four chapter four is
[0:43] about adultery Wars within the church
[0:46] and so forth uh but Chapter One deals
[0:49] with us where we we're we're in need of
[0:51] more patience how many know sometimes
[0:52] you need patience on God hallelujah but
[0:54] R that's the first one you need patience
[0:56] with is God hallelujah we want to be
[0:58] patient with the Living God hallelujah
[1:00] surely we need patience James 1 ver8
[1:03] we'll read that one then we'll read

[1:05] 48 it's nice they're both the eth verse
[1:08] all right James eight let's read that if

[1:27] He will draw nigh to you cleanse your

[1:39] adulterers uh verse one says Wars and
[1:41] fightings among the saints let's have
[1:43] one more word of prayer if you have a
[1:44] need on your heart let's make it know to

[1:50] we bless you God we give you the
[1:51] sacrifice of praise from uh Lord our
[1:54] lips the calves of our lips the
[1:55] scripture says Lord God forgive our sins
[1:57] this week forgive any evil word evil
[1:59] thought any evil deed Lord Jesus wash Us
[2:01] in thy blood that we be pure just now
[2:03] Lord as we come before the throne of
[2:05] grace as we look to the word of God lord
[2:07] we're not here by form or fashion we're
[2:08] here by spirit and by truth Lord God in
[2:11] the sincerity of our hearts and lives so
[2:13] father minister to all the needs here
[2:15] today Lord bless your people physically
[2:16] thank you for the ones that come out
[2:18] here tonight those that are working
[2:19] minister to them bless them strengthen
[2:21] them those that are sick and Afflicted
[2:22] we pray for healing in the name of Jesus
[2:24] Christ and Lord help me tonight to get
[2:26] out of your way Lord we know it's the
[2:27] preaching of the word that brings life
[2:28] that brings transformation
[2:30] and help us to all receive it by faith
[2:32] faith comes by hearing hearing by the
[2:34] word of God Lord let it be a reality
[2:36] here tonight again we pray Lord bless us
[2:38] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[2:40] said amen God bless you as you're being
[2:42] seated praise
[2:48] God hallelujah so I trust you were
[2:51] blessed you know by uh Sunday's message
[2:53] I think as I more the more I preach on
[2:55] the more it kind of opened up you know
[2:57] uh we looked at Eli at the ending there
[2:59] there and uh it tied him perfectly you
[3:02] know the adultery with his sons with
[3:04] adultery in uh James 4:8 proving Eli was
[3:08] double-minded uh what a good connection
[3:10] there I didn't even see that there to I
[3:12] was preaching it and then the reality of
[3:14] how he he was so careful about the
[3:16] holiest of holies think about that he
[3:18] the presence of God he was so he
[3:20] trembled at the presence of God but he
[3:22] didn't tremble at the outer court or the
[3:24] inner court right so he was all about
[3:26] the presence of God it was all about
[3:27] getting the feeling getting the presence
[3:29] of God the trembling but missing the
[3:31] other parts we got to take care of all
[3:33] three parts praise God we love the
[3:35] presence of God I love the presence of
[3:36] God I love to feel God I love to see God
[3:38] move who doesn't who doesn't want to see
[3:39] Miracles who doesn't who doesn't want a
[3:41] a dream or Supernatural or song you know
[3:43] or who doesn't want a testimony where
[3:45] it's something oh the presence of God
[3:47] was there but we got to make sure we
[3:48] look at every core hallelujah look at
[3:50] the outer core make sure that's clean
[3:52] the holy place and then the holiest of
[3:54] holies praise God so you know Eli is
[3:57] like the truest definition of unstable
[3:59] un unstable Health unstable spiritual
[4:01] life unstable parenting uh he was
[4:04] unstable uh in every way and so we see
[4:07] it uh plain from the scripture what a
[4:09] great lesson that is now I was thinking
[4:10] about our lives you know we have health
[4:11] as an area we have our job you know we
[4:13] have family finances relationship
[4:16] there's at least five areas you know
[4:17] John Maxwell says there's 12 you know I
[4:19] don't know I can't really go that far
[4:21] but there's at least five areas of our
[4:22] life you know maybe spiritually would be
[4:24] another one your spiritual walk with the
[4:25] Lord so maybe there's six seven8
[4:27] something like that but uh just
[4:29] something to keep in mind there you know
[4:30] you want to look for stability in all
[4:32] the areas of your life that's what
[4:34] people are you know brother R said
[4:36] people are thirsty for God right they're
[4:37] thirsty for love they're thirsty to see
[4:40] a real Christian praise God and so
[4:42] that's why we want to make sure that all
[4:43] all of our Lives they're are balanced
[4:45] out and people can see stability in our
[4:47] lives Hallelujah that will speak uh
[4:50] brother Bram said that's that's more
[4:51] powerful you know living a sermon is
[4:53] more powerful than preaching one
[4:55] Hallelujah so may God help us to have
[4:57] that type of uh dedication sub
[5:00] in our lives that people can see that
[5:02] and they can see Christ in our lives
[5:04] Hallelujah now I didn't get to this I
[5:05] want to go to James chap 3:8 I want to
[5:07] preach this so Lydia you can pull out
[5:09] some of these verses I want to preach a
[5:10] little section here you I really felt
[5:12] you know of course we're inspired to
[5:13] preach this just like when brother
[5:14] McBride came he preached on what he
[5:16] preach on the tongue right James chapter
[5:18] 2 and here I pick pick it up James 1 and
[5:20] James 4 also in James 3 you know we look
[5:24] at the tongue and uh you know
[5:26] double-mindedness here is is also seen
[5:28] in chapter three and double mindness
[5:32] double not mindedness sorry is is also
[5:34] seen with our
[5:36] words okay so other words our words
[5:38] should be saying the same thing all the
[5:39] time what is Jesus he was full of what
[5:42] Grace and Truth and Paul said let your
[5:45] words be seasoned with Grace Hallelujah
[5:49] so you know we want to look at that here
[5:50] tonight we got to speak the truth of
[5:51] course we got to call out sin you know
[5:53] we got to rebuke sin before all and
[5:55] there's a great balance there but you
[5:57] understand you know in this case we're
[5:58] going to see uh how James here is
[6:01] addressing this double-mindedness
[6:03] double-mindedness with the with the real
[6:04] Sanctified believers they wonder is God
[6:06] going to hear me is God going to supply
[6:07] wisdom is God going to supply the need
[6:09] or not that's a double-mindedness we all
[6:11] have to deal with then there's a
[6:13] double-mindedness like a uh an
[6:15] unsanctified person would struggle with
[6:17] like Wars fightings adultery idolatry
[6:20] all these things that's another kind of
[6:22] double-mindedness here uh I think this I
[6:24] think this impacts you and I sometimes
[6:27] uh you don't have to say Amen you could
[6:28] just say ouch or you could just listen
[6:30] Hallelujah verse verse eight you
[6:32] probably know where where this is going
[6:34] but the tongue can no man tame now see
[6:36] notice he didn't say the Holy Ghost
[6:37] can't tame it right you and I can't tame
[6:40] it but if we yield to the Holy Ghost it
[6:42] can be tamed Hallelujah remember all
[6:44] things are possible to them who believe
[6:47] right it is an unruly evil full of
[6:51] deadly poison
[6:53] Hallelujah you know someone could uh
[6:55] someone could be so nice to your face
[6:57] church and they could turn around and
[6:58] they could say they could curse you
[7:00] right right after that right that's how
[7:02] deadly the tongue is hallelujah verse n
[7:07] therewith bless we God even the father
[7:09] and therewith curse We Men which are
[7:11] made after the similitude or the image
[7:14] of God right we're creating the image of
[7:16] God out of the same mouth proceedeth
[7:19] blessing and cursing my brethren these
[7:21] things ought not so to be Hallelujah so
[7:25] James is letting us know you know we
[7:27] want to bless people remember Jesus said
[7:29] bless bless those who curse you remember
[7:30] Jesus said
[7:31] that and Jame James saw in the early
[7:33] church he saw in the in the book of Acts
[7:35] church people would bless and then they
[7:36] would curse just right afterwards and
[7:39] James said shouldn't be like this right
[7:43] uh verse 11 doth a fountain send forth
[7:45] at the same place water and bitter of
[7:47] course the answer is no that's a
[7:48] rhetorical question right it's either
[7:51] fresh water or salt water right verse 12
[7:54] can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive
[7:57] berries no either a Vine fish no so can
[8:00] no Fountain both yield salt water and
[8:04] fresh water Hallelujah so here we're
[8:06] seeing the doubled mindedness that that
[8:08] we battle with our words we have to make
[8:10] sure our words are edifying we have to
[8:12] make sure our words are blessing people
[8:14] yes there's words of Correction if any
[8:16] any parent knows that right one one
[8:19] second I I see that school all the time
[8:20] one second I'll have to do a correction
[8:22] and next moment I'll be smiling and and
[8:24] praising them you know like like today
[8:26] this one girl did this and that I had to
[8:27] kind of do a certain rebuke but then
[8:29] with a minut I was praising her I was
[8:30] said great job I compliment you that was
[8:32] wonderful you know uh so there's times
[8:34] for that but that's not what James is
[8:35] talking about James is talking about
[8:37] people that are they they're they're
[8:39] insincere they're blessing and then
[8:40] they're turning around and cursing the
[8:42] same person they're blessing right
[8:43] that's what he's talking about he's
[8:45] talking about a
[8:46] double-mindedness all right now verse 13
[8:48] who is a wise man and end do with
[8:50] knowledge among you so who would you you
[8:53] know who do you think in our church you
[8:54] know think about that who do you think
[8:55] in your family where's a wise person who
[8:57] knows a lot about God right that's what
[8:59] the Bible says let him show out of the
[9:01] good conversation that means Behavior so
[9:04] who wants to be wise and and
[9:05] knowledgeable in our church who wants to
[9:07] be wise knowledge okay so he he says if
[9:09] you want to do that then show good
[9:11] behavior Show good conversation so make
[9:14] sure your behavior his works with
[9:17] meekness and wisdom Hallelujah so again
[9:20] make sure you say gracious words a lot
[9:23] there's a time like I said to bring
[9:25] correction remember the Bible said if
[9:26] you see someone in caught in a trap you
[9:28] go to them humbly that Spirit that's on
[9:30] them will get on you remember remember
[9:32] that in Galatians chapter 6 you better
[9:34] be careful you better go when you try to
[9:36] correct somebody you better go with with
[9:37] a real Meek Spirit or that same Spirit
[9:40] on them is going to jump on you because
[9:41] you're opening yourself up to that uh
[9:43] you're trying to exalt yourself maybe
[9:45] against them but you got to go humbly
[9:47] and like brother Dennis preached you got
[9:48] to go humbly right and you gotta uh like
[9:51] brother Dennis said when he preached he
[9:52] said you got to remember that if if a
[9:54] spirit's on a person don't look at the
[9:56] person don't get angry with the person
[9:57] remember it's a spirit
[10:00] Hallelujah that's right that's what Paul
[10:02] or that's what James is saying here if
[10:04] you want to be wise if you want to have
[10:05] lots of knowledge behave the right way
[10:08] be humble now meekness means humility or
[10:10] mildness of wisdom so wisdom is humble
[10:13] right wisdom is mild in its uh Behavior
[10:17] hallelujah it's that steady Christian
[10:20] Life verse 14 but if you have bitter and
[10:23] V now bitter means piercing or
[10:25] sharp but if you have bitter Envy Envy
[10:28] means je Envy means jealousy or malice
[10:31] if you have sharp jealousy or piercing
[10:33] jealousy and strife which means
[10:35] contention or arguments in your hearts
[10:39] okay so look what's in people's hearts
[10:40] bitterness jealousy and
[10:42] arguments he says Glory not and lie not
[10:45] against the truth so this is the
[10:47] opposite of wisdom everybody see that
[10:49] tonight wisdom is
[10:51] humble uh mild uh good
[10:55] behavior uh but the other side double-
[10:57] mindedness is is bitterness envying and
[11:01] arguments Hallelujah can you ever see
[11:02] that so jealous arguing that is against
[11:05] the truth now I gotta I'm sorry uh Glory
[11:08] not and lie not against the truth verse
[11:10] 14 yeah lie not against the truth so
[11:13] jealous arguing is against the true the
[11:16] truth because the jealous arguing is
[11:18] devilish and it's false wisdom so be
[11:21] real careful church when people argue
[11:23] about things everybody listening real
[11:25] good
[11:27] tonight keep uh you know keep keep a a
[11:29] reminder of that say Lord remind me not
[11:31] to argue with people you know if they
[11:34] want to argue just let oh fine you can
[11:35] believe whatever you want I love you
[11:36] let's talk let's change the subject
[11:38] right but don't get into arguments and
[11:41] fusses right because the Bible says
[11:45] that's a bitter envying Strife it's
[11:48] Pride right it's Pride it's a
[11:50] manifestation of Pride because only
[11:52] through contention it comes
[11:54] Pride okay now verse 15 this wisdom
[11:58] descendeth not from from above so God
[12:00] didn't send down uh a bitter envying
[12:03] arguing Spirit God did not send that
[12:05] down Hallelujah but that's Earthly and
[12:08] sensual that censal means beastial in
[12:10] the uh Greek so beastly like animal
[12:13] devilish so be be very careful people
[12:16] that want to argue right people that
[12:18] want to are jealous of other people and
[12:20] they're very sharp with bitter sharp
[12:23] words against people remember that's
[12:25] beastiality nature that's not that's not
[12:27] the nature of Christ that's the sensual
[12:30] worldly beastly nature Hallelujah so be
[12:33] so Be watchful people that want to argue
[12:36] uh people that want to fuss you got to
[12:38] watch that by God's grace that's
[12:40] double-mindedness Hallelujah because
[12:41] remember these same people that are
[12:42] arguing they'll come by and the person
[12:45] they're not arguing with they'll say
[12:46] well God bless you how you doing oh
[12:47] we're doing good let's praise the Lord
[12:49] right but but the person they're arguing
[12:51] with they're all fussed with them of the
[12:54] so bitter water's coming out and then
[12:56] sweet water's coming out over here so be
[12:59] very careful of devil minding this
[13:00] church and the church said I'm saying
[13:03] watch our lives let's watch our lives by
[13:05] God's grace
[13:08] Hallelujah remember the devil's going to
[13:10] try to lay a trap for you and I that's
[13:12] why we need the word of God hallelujah
[13:14] to overcome that trap Hallelujah to be
[13:16] ready for say to be ready to say oh we
[13:20] just heard A good sermon on that we just
[13:21] heard the word of God so I'm not going
[13:22] to fall into that praise God
[13:27] hallelujah verse 16 for where envying
[13:30] and strife is there is
[13:32] confusion which means instability right
[13:35] we're talking about being stable
[13:36] single-minded right so whenever people
[13:39] Envy or have Strife which is arguments
[13:41] against people their lives are full of
[13:44] instability and that also means
[13:46] confusion means disorder and every evil
[13:49] work okay now that's a lot of evil in
[13:52] people's lives right so hopefully that
[13:55] doesn't deal with us here at our church
[13:56] by God's grace because look every evil
[13:58] work lots of evil work in their lives
[14:01] Hallelujah that's beastial sorry that's
[14:04] beasti I'm sorry beastly sorry beastial
[14:07] or beastly sensual devilish wisdom which
[14:10] we know is not wisdom it's not God's
[14:12] wisdom it's worldly wisdom Hallelujah
[14:15] verse
[14:16] 17 but the wisdom that's from above is
[14:19] first pure see pure heart that's why
[14:22] Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart
[14:25] Hallelujah for they shall be see God
[14:27] is't that beautiful a't that wonderful
[14:28] to have a pure heart praise God I have
[14:30] nothing between men I have nothing
[14:32] between women nothing between God I've
[14:34] got a pure heart praise God glory verse
[14:36] 17 but the wisdom that's from above is
[14:38] pure then Peaceable creates peace it's
[14:42] gentle and easy to be intreated which
[14:45] means
[14:46] persuasive right you ever seen that a
[14:48] real humble person uh they can kind of
[14:51] bring down a situation if if a
[14:52] Situation's escalated the spirit of God
[14:55] will bring down that situation it'll
[14:57] deescalate it right it won't it won't
[14:59] escalate it it'll deescalate it because
[15:01] the Bible said it's
[15:03] gentle it it's Peaceable it's easy to to
[15:07] bring down and and bring any arguing or
[15:09] accusations it's easy to bring that down
[15:11] see that Hallelujah that's the wisdom of
[15:14] God that's the peace of God it's full of
[15:16] mercy and good
[15:18] fruits see full of Mercy full not
[15:21] partial lots of
[15:22] Mercy we're going to see that tonight
[15:24] with King Saul my goodness God is full
[15:26] of mercy and good fruits without parti
[15:29] it so see the spirit of God it doesn't
[15:31] uh put this one person above that one
[15:34] everybody's the same everybody's uh my
[15:36] brother everybody's my sister praise God
[15:38] I treat everybody the same hallelujah
[15:41] amen right but then the the the
[15:43] double-mindedness it has favorites it
[15:46] treats some people different than other
[15:48] people right but uh we know uh God or
[15:52] David wrote to Solomon David told
[15:54] Solomon he said men that rule must fear
[15:57] God and they must be impartial they must
[15:59] honor God more than they honor man
[16:01] Hallelujah right so it's that
[16:03] impartiality it's knowing that God is
[16:05] the judge and and we must treat
[16:07] everybody the same
[16:09] Hallelujah and the wisdom of God is also
[16:11] without hypocrisy which means it's
[16:13] sincere the wisdom of God is sincere
[16:16] hallelujah it's not insincere and the
[16:19] fruit of righteousness is sown in peace
[16:21] of them that make peace so here we learn
[16:24] that uh double-minded Believers are
[16:26] unstable but we must plan seeds of Peace
[16:30] if we want to reap peace that's why
[16:31] brother R said you want somebody to say
[16:33] something good about you say something
[16:34] good about them right so practicing
[16:38] bitter words produces devilish fruit
[16:41] right but the opposite is true planting
[16:43] peaceful seeds or words produces the
[16:46] fruits of the spirit praise God
[16:48] hallelujah that's what we want to do we
[16:50] want to we want to plant the right seeds
[16:52] by the grace of God hallelujah remember
[16:55] we just want we just want Sweet Waters
[16:57] to flow from our lips
[16:59] Hallelujah all right now let's review
[17:01] the fruits of the spirit it's been a
[17:02] while since we did this uh the barber
[17:04] asked me a few weeks ago he said what
[17:05] are the fruits of the spirit I named
[17:06] them off I think I missed a couple so I
[17:08] want to review them if I thought if I
[17:09] forgot them it'd be good for all of us
[17:10] to if I forgot a couple it's good for
[17:12] all of us to go through it Galatians
[17:13] 5:22 if you got your Bibles Hallelujah
[17:16] review the nine fruits of the spirit
[17:17] let's review them in contrast to James 3
[17:19] so remember James 3 had bitterness
[17:21] cursing envying Strife confusion all
[17:24] that's in James 3 remember James 4 had
[17:27] Wars fightings among you a adultery
[17:30] idolatry so James is given us a clear
[17:33] example all these things were amongst
[17:35] the church James saw it in the church
[17:37] thank God there was the Holy Ghost to
[17:38] clean it out hallelujah amen
[17:42] glory these things are right amongst the
[17:44] church you know as I've been around the
[17:46] message all these years I realized you
[17:47] know I told you the story when I first
[17:48] got saved I thought we're just there's
[17:50] this room is full of just angels in here
[17:52] but I realize there's a lot of devils
[17:53] around too right uh so we're thank thank
[17:58] thankful for God's grace thankful for
[18:00] his cleansing power and remember this is
[18:01] also Rapture time this is Harvest Time
[18:03] so people have to manifest the seed
[18:05] that's within them that's of course but
[18:07] in every time but especially at the end
[18:09] time we have to manifest the life in the
[18:10] seed
[18:11] Hallelujah so see in other words we
[18:13] should manifest these fruits we should
[18:15] be planting the right seeds of Peace of
[18:18] Grace right of truth of mercy and that's
[18:20] what we should reap these fruits of the
[18:22] Holy Spirit Hallelujah now remember
[18:25] Church don't forget this there's fruits
[18:26] for justification because John the said
[18:29] bring forth fruits of
[18:30] repentance so you're going to see
[18:32] certain fruits of people's lives wow
[18:34] they really got saved wow they've really
[18:35] changed I know when I first got saved I
[18:37] never said a cuss word again just when I
[18:39] got baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ I
[18:41] was a I was an awful speaking person but
[18:43] just just getting baptized I never had a
[18:46] desire to cuss again that was the fruit
[18:48] of repentance and then there's fruits of
[18:50] sanctification as well Hallelujah
[18:53] brother R said it's changing your mind
[18:54] changing your habits praise God it it
[18:57] cleans out all your bad habits that's
[18:59] what sanctification does and brother man
[19:01] said that sets you in order to receive
[19:02] the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible
[19:04] says amen God gives the Holy Ghost to
[19:06] them that obey him hallelujah amen
[19:08] Galatians 5:22 now let's really search
[19:10] our lives here let's look at the fruits
[19:12] of the spirit let's see if we have these
[19:13] fruits in our lives but the fruit of the
[19:15] spirit is love that means affection of
[19:17] course for God and for people right it
[19:19] means benevolence or Good Will that's
[19:21] what love is good will you want the best
[19:24] for everybody Hallelujah brother said if
[19:27] you want to see somebody go to hell he
[19:28] said you need a fresh trip to the altar
[19:31] right he said you better see check in
[19:33] and see if you're saved if you now other
[19:36] than the devil right we all want the
[19:37] devil and the demons to go to hell right
[19:38] right of course we want them to be
[19:40] judged and so forth like that but he
[19:42] says it's love the fruit of the spirit
[19:43] is love it's affection it's good will
[19:46] the next is Joy which in this case means
[19:48] cheerfulness or gladness now church it's
[19:51] easy to be that way when things are
[19:53] going good but we want to see the fruit
[19:55] when it's going not so good that's when
[19:58] I want to see fruit that's when you need
[19:59] fruit you need fruit when times are
[20:02] tough Hallelujah right so God so God

[20:46] Sunday with uh patience there that's
[20:48] what we need Hallelujah we need to have
[20:50] patience in the midst of Trials and we
[20:52] have to know if we ask God for wisdom
[20:54] God's going to give it to us amen we
[20:56] just got to wait for it praise God
[20:59] all right fifth gentleness which means
[21:01] goodness or kindness and of course the
[21:03] next one is goodness which means virtue
[21:04] where's virtue Hallelujah so goodness
[21:07] means virtue that's that public strength
[21:09] to be a real believer in front of
[21:11] anybody in front of your co-workers in
[21:12] front of your family that's an
[21:14] unbeliever that's uh the fruit of
[21:16] goodness you're virtuous you do what's
[21:18] right
[21:19] Hallelujah these are all fruits of the
[21:21] Holy Spirit and then Faith which means
[21:23] persuaded it means Reliance I'm relying
[21:25] on God I've got the fruit of faith I'm
[21:27] relying on God Hallelujah Austin's been
[21:30] telling me with his new uh occupation
[21:32] life he's got to rely on God you got to
[21:33] live by faith right brother if anybody
[21:35] needs the fruit of Faith it's him

[22:23] anybody seen arguing in here has anybody
[22:25] seen bitterness in here that's not one
[22:27] of the fruits that always be right like
[22:29] Jame anybody seen adultery in here no
[22:32] see those are all things James is seeing
[22:34] he's seing all these things but then you
[22:35] know Paul of course wrote this you know
[22:37] but Paul's saying these are the fruits
[22:38] of the Holy Spirit when you plant the
[22:41] right seed you get the right fruit
[22:43] praise God and the last one is
[22:45] temperance now this one deals with
[22:47] self-control and the Greek says
[22:49] especially the sexual area so that's a
[22:52] fruit of the Holy Spirit you can control
[22:54] your passions you can control remember
[22:56] that's also that's also uh one of the uh
[22:58] stature of perfect man right it's also
[23:00] one of the initial ones uh initial
[23:03] attributes or brother man calls them
[23:05] virtues but virtues one of the virtues
[23:06] you know so I call I call them
[23:08] attributes in the book or
[23:10] characteristics of the holy spirit so
[23:12] that means you get a uh you get an
[23:14] initial anointing of temperance and then
[23:16] when you get the Holy Ghost you're born
[23:17] again you get a greater portion of it
[23:19] praise God Amen Hallelujah that's right
[23:22] Glory so there's all nine nine fruits of
[23:25] the Holy Spirit now how many looking at
[23:27] your life today anybody looking at your
[23:28] fruit basket today praise God let's look
[23:31] at our fruit baskets today what fruits
[23:32] do we see in our lives praise God and if
[23:34] we want more fruits first we got to be
[23:36] pruned right got to receive the water of
[23:38] the word hallelujah is that right and
[23:40] you got to plant the right seeds
[23:42] hallelujah amen that's right that's the
[23:44] word of God Amen it's good review church
[23:47] now how do you get these as well verse
[23:49] 24 they that are Christ have crucified
[23:51] the flesh with the affections and lust
[23:54] it's a daily crucifixion mortification
[23:57] daily dying right praise God if we live
[24:00] in the spirit let us also walk in the
[24:02] spirit people say I'm walking in the
[24:04] spirit I'm walking in the spirit or I'm
[24:05] led by the Holy Spirit the only way you
[24:07] do that is if you crucify The
[24:09] Temptations to be double-minded
[24:11] Hallelujah that's what he's talking
[24:12] about in James right Hallelujah draw
[24:14] nigh to God God will draw nigh to you
[24:17] somebody uh I'm not going to say someone
[24:19] from overseas though texted me and said
[24:21] they uh they said pastor can you help me
[24:23] I fell into fornication so this man had
[24:26] relations before he's married and he
[24:27] said how can I overcome this I said you
[24:29] got to hate your
[24:30] sin I said you I said you don't know it
[24:33] but you have hated God's word and guess
[24:35] what verse I took him to 2 Samuel 11
[24:37] where Nathan said you've despised the
[24:39] word of God which means hate you know
[24:42] he's you know see people come to church
[24:44] and that and they think they love God
[24:46] but it's manifested by our daily actions
[24:48] praise God lovers of Pleasures more than
[24:51] lovers of God they might have a partial
[24:52] love for God but if someone can commit
[24:54] such things like this they don't at that
[24:56] moment they're not loving God they're
[24:57] hating the word of God God they're
[24:59] living by their passions and finally
[25:01] after numerous scriptures I was able to
[25:02] show them well how do you get your mind
[25:04] right you've got to have it transformed
[25:05] every day by the word of God hallelujah
[25:08] you got to you got to meditate David
[25:09] said you got to be planted amen not
[25:11] rooted up and uh you know confused and
[25:15] and tossed you know like the Bible said
[25:16] toss to and fro you got to be planted by
[25:19] the word of God hallelujah you got to
[25:21] stay in the word of God you got to let
[25:23] your mind be transformed by the renew of
[25:26] your mind make your body a Living
[25:27] Sacrifice to God hallelujah but that's
[25:30] an important thing to bring out people
[25:32] do these awful sins because they they
[25:34] hate the word of God that's why they do
[25:35] it right they might have some type of
[25:37] affection but to do something like this
[25:39] they have to hate the word of God thank
[25:41] God for the holy spirit thank God that
[25:43] he helps us to crucify the Flesh and the
[25:45] affections thereof Hallelujah we love
[25:48] think about that we love the crucified
[25:50] Jesus more than we love the the the the
[25:52] desires of the flesh Hallelujah the
[25:55] cross and Jesus dying and resurrecting
[25:58] that means more to us that gets us more
[25:59] excited than giving the flesh something
[26:01] that feeds it hallelujah praise God Amen
[26:04] that's a real believer amen that'll
[26:05] bring forth real fruits of the Holy
[26:07] Spirit praise God I told the brother
[26:09] that's what you need you got to love God
[26:11] instead of hating God you got to love
[26:12] God and I said you got to get revenge on
[26:14] the devil I said how do you do that well
[26:16] how do you get revenge on somebody you
[26:18] get them back right so how do you get
[26:20] the devil back you gotta when he brings
[26:22] his temptation you got to rebuke him you
[26:25] got to rebuke him and you got to do the
[26:26] opposite of that you got to give
[26:27] yourself more to God
[26:29] hallelujah that's how you do it you got
[26:31] to give more of yourself to God Amen I
[26:33] told him you got to be looking for that
[26:35] next Temptation and you immediately got
[26:36] to tell no I said you immediately got to
[26:38] slam that door praise God that's how you
[26:40] get revenge on him give more of yourself
[26:43] to God give God the glory Hallelujah
[26:45] draw nigh to God Amen and give all your
[26:48] love to God make sure God gets all your
[26:49] love all your time all your attention
[26:51] Hallelujah give him all your affection
[26:54] Church Hallelujah there's the love of uh
[26:55] the fruit the fruit of Love Hallelujah
[26:57] give him all all your affection
[26:58] hallelujah how many want to do that by
[27:00] God's grace that's right I appreciate
[27:02] people you know that share these things
[27:03] with me it keeps me sharp too like I
[27:06] said remember I told you that that 73y
[27:08] old man it came out more that 73 year
[27:10] old preacher he was looked to be one of
[27:11] the most famous preachers in America for
[27:13] five years that's come out he's had been
[27:15] having an affair with a woman in her 20s
[27:17] and he's
[27:20] 73 in her TW it's a third of his age and
[27:23] people have exalted him like he's think
[27:26] something great like this now they don't
[27:27] believe in the Holy like we do so they
[27:29] can't live a high enough life but the
[27:30] point is right the point is people can
[27:33] hide their sin for a while but their
[27:34] sin's going to find them out praise God
[27:37] hallelujah and see that that ought to be
[27:39] proof if if somebody can hide that sin
[27:41] behind the preaching they must not be
[27:43] preaching hard enough amen right they're
[27:45] just preaching a water down gospel but
[27:47] we don't want the water down gospel
[27:49] brother said we want a bare-fisted
[27:51] gospel do you know what that means in
[27:53] the boxing World they got to wear boxing
[27:55] gloves so it doesn't hurt as much
[27:56] brother R said that's what the preachers
[27:58] got today they got boxing gloves on
[28:00] where it's not as hard he said take
[28:02] those off and start punching the devil
[28:03] praise God bare fisted preachers amen
[28:07] preach at their sin right preach at all
[28:09] of our sin because we're battling on a
[28:11] daily basis sin in our members praise
[28:13] God that's why we got to preach on these
[28:14] things
[28:15] hallelujah
[28:18] hallelujah and like like I told you that
[28:20] example from the message preacher out
[28:22] there in in in in April a message
[28:24] preacher for 10 or 12 years had a church
[28:27] and uh goes after After High School
[28:28] girls yo see that they must be preaching
[28:31] a water down gospel because sin has to
[28:33] have effect on someone's life right it's
[28:36] leav it has to so something must have
[28:38] been wrong with the preaching the whole
[28:39] time and it could have been like Eli
[28:41] they could have trembled at the presence
[28:42] of God when it come down to the real
[28:44] details of the word of God the
[28:46] Simplicity of the word of God they must
[28:47] have been off a 100 miles
[28:50] hallelujah hallelujah praise God I hope
[28:52] that's making sense here by God's grace
[28:54] I don't mean to confuse anybody but I
[28:55] just want you to see they I mean people
[28:56] can have Miracles they can have gift
[28:58] they can have the prce of God tongues
[29:00] interpretation healing mirac whatever
[29:02] but they got to have every area of their
[29:04] lives in tune with the word of God
[29:06] hallelujah all
[29:08] right now let's look at the life of King
[29:10] sa I told myself I was going only going
[29:12] to preach 45 minutes but then I forgot
[29:13] to set my
[29:15] watch so I don't know what am I at Lydia
[29:18] you can you see it on
[29:20] there 30 okay can I fish this 15 minutes
[29:22] I might be able fix this we'll see uh
[29:26] like I said Sunday I could have preached
[29:27] four hours because I have all these uh
[29:29] Bible
[29:30] examples U and I'm going to bring them
[29:32] down I'll do one time like I told
[29:33] Brother William and about I want to
[29:35] preach on Peter Peter is quite the
[29:36] example of
[29:38] double-mindedness I was doing some study
[29:40] and I found this outline of his life I'd
[29:42] never seen it like that before so maybe
[29:44] Sunday morning I'll be preaching on
[29:45] Peter we'll see by God's grace and in a
[29:48] good way right because we can all look
[29:49] at our lives and see Peter can't we
[29:51] right anyone anyone ever here uh denied
[29:54] or I should maybe shouldn't say denied
[29:56] anyone ever here felt like you let down
[29:57] Christ you didn't stand up like you
[29:59] should have well then we can say God
[30:01] bless Peter God have mercy on Peter
[30:04] right because we want Mercy on ourselves
[30:06] Hallelujah all right so let's look at uh
[30:09] um the life of of Saul King
[30:13] Saul I'm just going to hit some
[30:14] highlights here like I said maybe 15
[30:16] minutes maybe that might be pretty good
[30:18] now first thing we see about Saul is
[30:20] that he's chosen for King uh remember uh
[30:22] but we see we see good you know we see
[30:25] good that God had called him and he
[30:26] surrendered to the call but remember he
[30:28] was hiding away from it right he was
[30:30] hiding from the the call of God right
[30:32] which was a a little sign of things to
[30:34] come right he knew God had called him he
[30:37] knew there was going to be a ceremony to
[30:38] anoint him King but he hid the Bible
[30:40] said he hid away he wasn't willing to
[30:43] come out and really stand out so see
[30:46] there must have been some doubt in his
[30:47] mind Hallelujah hiding away from the
[30:49] anointing but in chapter 10 ver Samuel
[30:52] 10:1 Samuel took the vial of oil and
[30:54] poured it on his head and kissed him and
[30:56] said is not this because the Lord has
[30:58] anointed thee to be Captain over his
[31:00] inheritance so we we see a good start
[31:02] the prophet loves him he's got the
[31:04] anointing oil on him not just oil but
[31:07] he's got the Holy Spirit on him the oil
[31:10] represented the holy spirit all right
[31:13] then in chapter 10 uh verse 10 the
[31:16] spirit of God came on Saul and he
[31:18] prophesied among them now brother Braham
[31:21] said plainly he said Saul wasn't uh a
[31:24] prophet but he had a gift of Prophecy he
[31:27] said because the prophet of that day was
[31:29] of course who Samuel good Hallelujah
[31:31] Samuel Samuel was the prophet of that
[31:33] day but Saul had a gift to prophesy so
[31:35] Samuel would hear from God Visions but
[31:37] you know Saul he could get in the spirit
[31:39] we see he gets in the spirit he sings
[31:41] and he'll start prophesying with his
[31:42] songs now Austin knows a little bit
[31:44] about getting inspiration for songs
[31:46] right because he'll just come to you
[31:48] right well that's what Saul was Saul was
[31:50] just praising God and he would just
[31:52] start prophesying well Israel will
[31:54] defeat the Philistines and Israel will
[31:57] will destroy their enemies and all these
[31:58] prophecies because he got in the spirit
[32:00] praise God and this is all good right he
[32:04] starts off really good but let's look at
[32:06] the double-mindedness of Saul so we can
[32:09] apply it to our lives Church no matter
[32:12] how good our lives get or no no matter
[32:14] how uh faithful we may seem we have to
[32:16] guard our minds because it's the
[32:18] greatest battle ever fought did you ever
[32:20] realize that he didn't say the greatest
[32:22] battle ever fought was in the soul he
[32:24] said the greatest battle ever fought was
[32:26] in the mind right because Satan has
[32:28] access to that one Satan don't have
[32:30] access to the soul thank God for that
[32:34] Hallelujah so see so see he gets
[32:36] anointed the spirit of God comes on him
[32:38] he prophesies he's got his gifts
[32:41] operating hallelujah thank God amen
[32:45] glory that's in uh chapter 10 verse 10
[32:47] he starts
[32:49] prophesying all right now and then he
[32:51] gets some early Victory so he starts off
[32:53] good in chapter 11 uh verse one he he
[32:58] slays the ammonites Hallelujah and also
[33:01] in verses 1- 11 he gets victory over
[33:03] nahash the ammonites and so he gets two
[33:06] victories right away so he's got the
[33:07] spirit on him he's got his gifts
[33:09] operating and he gets two big victories
[33:11] right at the beginning talk about a good
[33:13] start he's on a good rooll by God's
[33:16] grace but then in Chapter 13 is his
[33:19] first
[33:21] mistake God told King Saul to wait for
[33:24] Samuel to make the burnt offering how
[33:26] many remember that
[33:28] right but what does he do he said oh
[33:30] it's getting late uh uh the sun's going
[33:32] down you know he said by this day I
[33:35] better I better intrude into the
[33:37] prophet's
[33:38] office I better inject my own thought
[33:40] into the word of God see trying to be
[33:43] something trying to be something that
[33:45] he's not everybody see that he's doing a
[33:47] prophet's job that that sacrifice was
[33:49] only for a
[33:50] prophet now look he could have the devil
[33:53] could have said well look you prophesied
[33:55] you got a gift to prophesy come on why
[33:56] can't why isn't yours just as good as
[33:58] his because it wasn't God's provided way
[34:02] Hallelujah he goes ahead and makes the
[34:04] sacrifice remember as soon as he got
[34:06] done Samuel walks up said what do I
[34:08] smell here what's going on here he said
[34:11] well I didn't think I would I didn't
[34:12] think you'd be here but you know God God
[34:15] is always uh God has always has a
[34:17] provided place of worship God will
[34:19] provide the need amen we just got to
[34:21] wait on God wait on God God will provide
[34:23] it amen patience so see we he lacked
[34:26] patience so here we see the the first
[34:28] evil he lacks
[34:30] patience God help us to be patient in
[34:33] 1st Samuel 13:13 uh Samuel said to Saul
[34:36] thou has done foolishly thou has not
[34:38] kept the Commandment of the Lord thy
[34:40] God okay so a foolish thing church we
[34:43] got to be very careful make sure we keep
[34:45] all the commands of God
[34:48] hallelujah and and let's if we make a
[34:50] mistake let's be like David and said
[34:51] I've done foolishly Lord I've done
[34:53] foolishly right because we know God is
[34:55] rich in Mercy as well
[34:58] but that's one thing we don't see a lot
[34:59] from Saul we don't see a lot of humble
[35:01] repentance right we see a lot of uh uh
[35:04] just doing what he wants to do a lot of
[35:06] self-will we'd say now verse I'm sorry
[35:09] the next
[35:10] chapter in 1st Samuel 14 he makes a rash
[35:14] vow and basically he curses his own son
[35:17] and he don't even know it he said anyone
[35:19] that eats all this day is curse and
[35:21] Jonathan didn't know that Jonathan went
[35:22] down there found some honey remember
[35:23] that and his eyes were open that's what
[35:25] the word of God does to us amen we're
[35:27] tired when we're weak when we're
[35:29] struggling what does God do he sends us
[35:30] Honey Hallelujah he sends us the
[35:33] sweetness of the Holy Spirit to give us
[35:34] strength to cheer us up Hallelujah I say
[35:37] like that he gives us the joy of the
[35:40] Lord oh how many times have I seen it
[35:42] praise God Amen struggl and tired being
[35:44] discouraged somebody come around and
[35:46] make you joyful in the Lord hallelujah
[35:47] God sends you a blessing he G sends you
[35:50] some some some uh some honey to
[35:52] encourage you but then later in that
[35:55] chapter after you know Saul talks to to
[35:57] Jonathan and so forth
[35:58] then Saul defeats his enemies in 1st
[36:00] Samuel
[36:01] 14:47 so now he gets his third real big
[36:04] victory all right so he's pretty good
[36:06] it's kind of like three to one right now
[36:07] right three good one maybe four to one
[36:10] maybe four to one he's prophesied maybe
[36:12] four to one he's been doing pretty good
[36:14] now chapter 15 is his downfall this is
[36:18] his greatest
[36:19] downfall Saul disobeys God's command
[36:22] completely to destroy the Amal likeit
[36:24] and their livestock and he spares King a
[36:27] G and some of his animals and because of
[36:30] this God rejects Saul as king so it
[36:33] looks like he got two strikes and he was
[36:35] out that's what it looks like church in
[36:37] baseball you get three and then you're
[36:39] out but here in God's way for the king
[36:41] they got two stries and then they're out
[36:44] everybody see that two and they're out
[36:48] my
[36:49] goodness and uh you know think about
[36:51] that you know God said destroy
[36:53] everything you know you know why I did
[36:54] that because the amalekites had really
[36:56] treated Moses bad
[36:58] they had really done them wrong they
[37:00] wouldn't let them cross through their
[37:01] land they wouldn't give them any water
[37:03] remember that they wouldn't even feed
[37:04] them they they wouldn't make they
[37:07] wouldn't make their life a little easier
[37:08] God help us to make lives a little
[37:10] easier for somebody else they understand
[37:13] what I'm saying they wouldn't even o
[37:15] open up uh the their their land and let
[37:18] Israel walk through and God's anger was
[37:19] kindled against them God said I'm going
[37:22] to use Saul to do it but then Saul had
[37:25] pity on them but he wasn't supposed to
[37:26] have pity he was supposed to to obey the
[37:28] word of God praise the Lord and church
[37:30] that applies to our lives we got to kill
[37:32] every Speck of sin in our lives and the
[37:34] church said don't spare the pride don't
[37:37] spare the lust of the eyes the lust of
[37:39] the flesh whatever it is don't spare
[37:40] that we've got to kill it praise God
[37:43] we're commission to do that amen isn't
[37:45] God's anger against sin
[37:47] Hallelujah see we get we can learn so
[37:49] much from this we've got to crucify the
[37:51] lust of the Flesh and the affections
[37:53] thereof amen we have to crucify these
[37:56] things and see that this is this relates
[37:58] to our lives as well the
[38:02] amalekites and then be God said because
[38:05] this because you rejected the word of
[38:06] the Lord the Lord has rejected thee from
[38:08] being King over Israel now brother
[38:10] brandham said brother Bram said uh Saul
[38:12] was into greed and riches that's why he
[38:15] kept some of the the the the cattle okay
[38:19] that that that may be true because
[38:20] remember brother R said three things get
[38:21] the preacher right money wh women
[38:23] popularity but then remember right after
[38:25] this it might have been money but
[38:26] remember this Saul said uh he Beggs
[38:29] Samuel Samuel just come come worship
[38:31] with me so everybody can see that I'm
[38:33] with the prophet of God so we can see
[38:35] that was popularity Saul was interested
[38:38] in popularity Hallelujah he was
[38:41] interested in greed and brother man said
[38:43] greed so he's interested in money and
[38:44] popularity we never see him struggle
[38:46] with women right but we see him struggle
[38:48] with money and
[38:50] popularity and he just wanted everybody
[38:52] to he just wanted to look good he wanted
[38:53] everything to look good but he wanted to
[38:54] compromise on the word of God see we
[38:56] cannot compromise on
[38:58] anything don't we don't that's I don't
[39:01] care that's why I put my sermons on
[39:02] YouTube I don't care what people say I
[39:04] know I I they can say whatever they want
[39:06] I want to love God I want to serve God
[39:07] hallelujah I don't care if the church
[39:09] looks empty or full it doesn't matter
[39:11] the ma what matters is are we living up
[39:12] to God's word hallelujah not trying to
[39:15] impress people and get more people to
[39:17] fill the church you know brother R
[39:18] rejoiced but what brother R said you
[39:20] know I wish know brother talking about
[39:23] how some of his people left his church
[39:25] and went down to another church and
[39:26] brother BR said I I hope God will do
[39:27] that I hope God will fill up their
[39:29] church and then God will just fill ours
[39:30] right back up again so brother wasn't
[39:33] worried about people leaving and going
[39:34] to different churches he said oh they
[39:36] can just go on to that church over there
[39:38] that's fine may God fill that one up and
[39:39] then God may he fill up ours as well
[39:41] praise God hallelujah see he wasn't
[39:45] worried about you know what it looked
[39:46] like to the to the people but but Saul
[39:48] was so concerned what it looked like to
[39:51] the people he was a in other words he
[39:53] was a people pleaser and God helped me
[39:55] not to be a people pleaser God help the
[39:57] preachers that come in here not to be
[39:59] people Pleasers but they'll preach us
[40:01] the word of God I no matter how much it
[40:04] burns our hide brother M says burns your
[40:07] hide amen now chapter
[40:09] 16 now what's interesting in chapter 16
[40:11] Saul gets refreshed by David's heart so
[40:14] look now we get a good thing so now it
[40:17] looks like he's got five or six goods
[40:19] and he's got two bads but God's already
[40:21] rejected
[40:22] him see he gets refresh so see somebody
[40:26] can be rejected by God maybe for a
[40:28] Ministry but then they can still get
[40:29] refreshed by the Holy Spirit Now isn't
[40:31] that the mercy of God you understand
[40:34] what I'm saying he was Saul was already
[40:36] rejected by God he's going to be
[40:37] replaced in maybe a few maybe 10 15
[40:39] years but then God still let him get
[40:41] refresh in the presence of God through
[40:44] David's gift that is the mercy of God
[40:47] you know I feel like this is like a part
[40:49] uh this is like a part
[40:51] 10 of uh the message of Grace that's
[40:54] what I want to say because God had so
[40:57] much grace on
[40:59] Saul so much grace are you seeing it in
[41:03] chapter 17 he does Wicked or he does he
[41:06] does he has no courage because he won't
[41:07] go fight Goliath Goliath's like send
[41:09] Saul what does Saul do I'm not going
[41:12] anybody else I'll reward you if you go
[41:14] see the spirit of God has left him he's
[41:17] afraid to go fight a warrior he's he's
[41:19] afraid to go fight uh uh maybe some big
[41:22] obstacle he lost his faith he lost his
[41:25] courage see that's what we need we need
[41:27] courage in the face of adversity
[41:29] everybody see that so you see there's
[41:31] another another evil he lets a teenager
[41:34] he's a grown man it'd be like Let It Be
[41:37] Like Me letting uh you know Victoria or
[41:39] Zion or Genevie you know go out and and
[41:41] pray for a sick person well I don't want
[41:42] to go you guys go to the you guys go to
[41:44] the hospital and pray for the cancer
[41:45] patient you know that's what it would be
[41:47] like because I'm so much taller you know
[41:50] Saul was head the Bible said head and
[41:52] shoulders so David was just maybe up to
[41:54] his shoulder and if anybody had a chance
[41:56] it was Saul
[41:57] but he was afraid because the spirit of
[41:59] God had left him God give us courage let
[42:01] the spirit of God be on us Amen to fight
[42:04] the Lord's battles what battles do you
[42:06] have to fight with let the spirit of God
[42:08] be in your battles
[42:09] amen see because everybody's got a
[42:12] battle who who doesn't have a giant to
[42:14] defeat out there tonight who doesn't
[42:17] anybody got anybody giant free out there
[42:19] no no Giants come fight my Giants
[42:22] then come fight uh come fight these
[42:25] Giants we see there uh the aners and
[42:27] everything like that that's what I'm
[42:28] talking about you know just major
[42:30] battles praise God things that we should
[42:32] be praying
[42:34] for so see he's he's uh he just goes
[42:38] back and forth this
[42:39] double-mindedness right he gets
[42:41] refreshed but then in the presence of
[42:42] Goliath he gets fearful so did the whole
[42:46] Army where is that refreshment see how
[42:48] quickly church we can lose our
[42:50] refreshment we get refreshed we get
[42:51] refreshed on Sunday boy you better watch
[42:53] out Monday or Tuesday the devil's coming
[42:54] on Monday or Tuesday if not for sure
[42:56] Wednesday morning
[42:58] right right before church the devil's
[42:59] going to try to discourage you see that
[43:02] Saul he's afraid to fight and then he
[43:06] gets jealous he gets a jealous spirit
[43:08] because they're singing Saul has slay
[43:10] his thousands and David is 10,000 1st
[43:12] Samuel 189 says da Saul I David from
[43:15] that day forward in other words he's
[43:16] going to kill him from that day
[43:18] forward right not I am for good I am for
[43:21] evil he's kind he's going to try to
[43:24] destroy David from that day forward
[43:27] all right now in chapter 19 we get evil
[43:30] and good Saul Now starts to try to kill
[43:33] David remember he sends two troops out
[43:35] and what do they do they start praising
[43:37] God they start prophesying he sends
[43:40] people to kill David but there's such an
[43:41] anointing on David that the the men that
[43:44] are going to kill him they got under the
[43:46] anointing of the Holy
[43:47] Spirit to me that that's what David was
[43:50] writing about he said you m you make a
[43:52] table for me in the presence of my
[43:55] enemies right my cup runs there my cup
[43:58] runs over in the presence of my enemies
[44:00] Hallelujah is't that beautiful that's
[44:03] like that great David movie right they
[44:04] come in there wanting to kill and they
[44:05] just fall into the anointing what a
[44:07] beautiful what a beautiful story that is
[44:09] in in the presence of their enemies
[44:11] David gets his cup running over and then
[44:14] Saul comes last of all and the Bible
[44:17] said Saul prophesied again so not only
[44:19] did his gift operate before now his gift
[44:21] is still operating and yet God's
[44:24] rejected him see people you don't see
[44:26] Saints we don't lose our gifts there's
[44:27] 15 minutes so maybe give me 15
[44:30] more see the God doesn't take the gifts
[44:33] away the the only way we lose gifts as
[44:35] if we bury them in the ground that's
[44:38] what Jesus said one man buried him in
[44:40] the ground but see Saul had already been
[44:42] rejected he done evil he done all these
[44:44] evil things and God still uses his gift
[44:46] in the presence of God because the gifts
[44:48] and callings of God are without
[44:50] repentance we ought to say Amen to that
[44:51] Hallelujah in other words if I make a
[44:53] mistake God's not going to throw me in
[44:54] the dumpster well I'm done with you no
[44:56] the only way you go in the dumpsters if
[44:57] you bury yourself in the
[44:58] dumpster God can still use you there's
[45:01] hope for a second chance a third chance
[45:03] there's hope for a new season you can
[45:05] get your joy back you get your dance
[45:06] back Hallelujah we preached on that you
[45:09] know uh was it was it uh Hosea preached
[45:12] about that you'll get your season of Joy
[45:14] back Hallelujah just stay true to God
[45:16] God won't take your gift away he's just
[45:18] trying to train you get you to trust him
[45:20] help you to die out from your sin get
[45:21] the spirit of God get the fruits back
[45:23] and then God will use your gifts again
[45:25] Hallelujah don't think God cut me off
[45:28] and God's never going to use my gifts if
[45:29] you humble yourself God will use them
[45:31] again by God's grace you know that's
[45:33] what brother uh remember brother Rod you
[45:35] all know brother Rod right when we went
[45:37] down when we went over there to oberin
[45:39] that's what brother Rod uh prayed for me
[45:41] brother Rod said remember we were
[45:43] praying at the altar here but right by
[45:44] Charles uh finny's uh pulpit and he
[45:46] prayed for me he said he said Lord uh
[45:48] send a miracle anointing bring that back
[45:50] on brother Jesse's life a few weeks
[45:52] later I went to Iowa and we got those
[45:54] two Miracle testimonies I thought what a
[45:56] wonderful blessing that was how did he I
[45:58] mean I wasn't even I didn't ask him to
[46:00] pray for that he just felt letter of the
[46:02] Lord to pray for that I was so blessed
[46:05] amen hallelujah that the Lord could kind
[46:08] of speak through him and give a prayer
[46:10] and then just see just to see it
[46:12] answered a few weeks later see God has
[46:14] everything in control praise God if we
[46:17] go through trials we go through dark
[46:18] Seasons we go through valleys Church
[46:20] stay with it God's G to walk right
[46:22] through the valley with you praise God
[46:24] he's going to bring you back to where
[46:26] you need to be he's going to get your
[46:27] gifts in operation again hallelujah it's
[46:33] beautiful in chapter 22 we see evil in
[46:36] chapter 22 Saul kills the priests and
[46:39] the high priest because they gave David
[46:41] the shoe bread and the sword of Goliath
[46:44] now church this is where Grace really
[46:46] steps
[46:47] in a man murdering
[46:51] others
[46:53] right murders a whole group of priests I
[46:55] need to look that up and see how many
[46:56] that was I didn't look that up but now
[46:59] he's murdering I mean he remember he set
[47:01] his eye on David from that day forward
[47:02] and remember he just prophesied a few
[47:04] chapters before that he he prophesied he
[47:06] was under the spirit of God then he he
[47:08] grieved the Holy Spirit and then he gets
[47:09] under the spirit of
[47:12] murder isn't it striking the look at the
[47:14] double mindedness look look at the
[47:15] Double mind everybody see that that's
[47:16] what this is about double-mindedness one
[47:18] day praising God the next day trying to
[47:20] destroy things destroy people that's
[47:24] double-mindedness Hallelujah just like
[47:26] Eli
[47:27] oh I tremble at the Ark of God but I let
[47:29] my sons you know destroy the offering of
[47:32] God I I look past their adultery all
[47:35] right I don't I don't I don't care for
[47:37] the the Mind we'd say or the uh the the
[47:39] manora uh I'll just kind of let that go
[47:43] and I'm just going to focus on the
[47:44] trembling at the presence of God thee
[47:45] I'm just going to focus on the ark the
[47:46] power of God see but we got to look at
[47:49] everything in our lives Jesus said Jesus
[47:52] said uh make sure you don't lose sight
[47:54] of the the Lesser matters of the law
[47:57] remember that Jesus said you got to do
[47:58] the little things too not just the big
[48:00] things you got to do the little things
[48:02] as well praise God
[48:06] hallelujah that's true verse 20 I'm
[48:09] sorry chapter 24 1st Samuel 24 we get
[48:11] good and evil David spares Saul's life
[48:13] for the first time he did it
[48:16] twice and Saul says David is more
[48:19] righteous than I in first Samuel 24:17
[48:22] and then Saul stops pursuing Davis look
[48:24] the spirit of God comes on him he says
[48:26] you're more righteous than I isn't that
[48:27] isn't that hum humility church when was
[48:30] the last time you looked at somebody and
[48:31] said wow they're more righteous than I
[48:32] am you don't got to say Amen but when
[48:35] was the last time you looked at somebody
[48:36] and said wow they are more righteous
[48:38] than me see that's the holy spirit that
[48:41] wasn't the spirit of the devil that was
[48:42] the Holy Spirit on him wow he could have
[48:43] killed me he didn't I'm not going to
[48:45] chase him anymore so here so here we see
[48:48] bad and good in the same
[48:49] chapter right so he goes from one him to
[48:52] kill him and then he his mind now goes
[48:54] back to the things of God oh he's more
[48:56] righteous than me
[48:57] I'm going to stop pursuing my
[49:01] son-in-law
[49:03] right now we go down to verse uh I'm
[49:06] sorry chapter 26 now Saul pursues him
[49:09] again so see there's a double-mindedness
[49:11] I'm done talking about this I'm done
[49:13] doing this right I'm done attacking him
[49:15] I'm done chasing him down but then he
[49:16] goes right back to it see the double
[49:18] mindedness I'm done with it no I'm back
[49:20] on it flipping right flipping right back
[49:25] that's what we're talking about double
[49:26] mindness James says that we have to
[49:28] guard ourselves from that church I'm
[49:29] talking to each every every person here
[49:30] tonight God help us not to be
[49:32] double-minded right let the fruits of
[49:34] the Holy Spirit right uh manifest out of
[49:38] our
[49:39] Lives see that see this is just striking
[49:42] to me I I never gone through his whole
[49:44] life like this before but look it's just
[49:45] constantly back and forth good evil good
[49:47] evil good thoughts bad thoughts good
[49:50] words bad words prophesying for God
[49:53] trying to kill people and then literally
[49:55] killing people and then
[49:57] prophesying was that right yes he
[50:01] prophesied oh that was right before he
[50:03] killed people he prophesied right before
[50:04] he killed people my
[50:08] goodness so that was 1st Samuel 26 Saul
[50:11] pursues David again and then Saul says
[50:13] he sinned in 1st Samuel 26:21 you want
[50:16] to put that one up there and then Saul
[50:18] says he will he will not pursue David
[50:20] any longer and then Saul never chased
[50:23] David again then said Saul I have sinned
[50:26] returned my son David for I will no more
[50:28] do thee harm because my soul was
[50:29] precious in thine eyes this day behold I
[50:32] played the fool and have ered
[50:33] exceedingly does that sound familiar
[50:34] playing the fool David said I've done
[50:37] foolishly see
[50:39] Believers right Believers so here we see
[50:43] good we see bad and e or evil and good
[50:45] again evil he's chasing them down and
[50:47] then we finally see good he finally gets
[50:49] the victory over his uh hatred towards
[50:51] David right then he finally after the
[50:54] second time he spared my life I think
[50:56] this was the one where uh his his uh
[50:58] David if I'm not mistaken David's men
[51:00] were telling him God has given him into
[51:02] your hands kill him and David didn't do
[51:04] it he said I won't touch the Lord's
[51:05] anointed the first time remember he cut
[51:07] off part of his skirt he said look what
[51:09] I
[51:10] got right this is this is the grace of
[51:13] God God's grace comes on Saul and Saul
[51:16] says okay I'm no longer GNA chase after
[51:19] David I'm done being double-minded back
[51:23] uh I I'm going to chase David I'm not
[51:24] going to chase David I'm going to chase
[51:25] David I'm not going to Chase David I'm
[51:27] done with that and he finally gets the
[51:32] Victory church a man a man criticized
[51:35] brother brandom for saying Saul was
[51:37] saved a man criticized him and I'll talk
[51:40] more about that I got the quote I think
[51:42] it was from
[51:43] 1950
[51:46] 1961 1961 yeah questions and answers
[51:51] 1961 so I'll read that in just a moment
[51:54] here hallelujah
[51:59] then we go to chapter 28 this is the
[52:00] witch of Endor chapter we're familiar
[52:02] with that there's a lot of uh we'd say
[52:05] maybe unusual things in here but there's
[52:07] also a lot of Revelation as
[52:09] well now church we see again we see evil
[52:12] and good in this chapter we see evil
[52:15] because Saul uh he doesn't know he can't
[52:18] hear from God so he goes to a witch
[52:21] which he already said anyone who does
[52:22] that should be killed so look he put a
[52:24] death sentence on himself just just like
[52:26] David put a death sentence on his own
[52:28] four Sons remember that that man will
[52:30] restore
[52:31] fourfold right and what' God do God took
[52:33] four of his sons Saul said anyone that
[52:36] goes to a Witcher medium they shall die
[52:38] guess what Saul died the next day is
[52:40] that right
[52:42] Church the very next day and Jesus said
[52:45] how you judge others that's how God will
[52:47] judge you right judge it so we want to
[52:50] be gracious how you want to be gracious
[52:51] in your judgment Hallelujah help me to
[52:54] judge like Jesus said judge right
[52:57] judgment that's right
[53:00] Hallelujah and what's amazing church is
[53:02] that um here here we see the good now
[53:05] the good is that he fasts all day and
[53:08] night all day and all night so 24-hour
[53:12] fast when was the last time he did that
[53:15] right that's sincere isn't that sincere
[53:17] he wants to know from God but he he says
[53:20] like I can't hear from God but he's
[53:22] willing to fast day and night to try to
[53:24] get some guidance for his life
[53:28] what does the woman do she does her
[53:29] enchantments the spirit of uh Samuel
[53:32] comes up and he said why did you disqui
[53:34] me from my rest I think about that
[53:36] church that means in Paradise it must it
[53:39] must have been peaceful in Paradise
[53:41] right and then when Samuel's Soul comes
[53:44] up it must have been unpeaceful because
[53:45] remember all the demon powers church
[53:47] remember the demons that are wrestling
[53:49] with Daniel right not not Daniel but
[53:51] wrestling above Daniel right remember
[53:52] that the prince of power of the air
[53:54] Persia so Samuel was like why'd you dis
[53:57] quiet me why'd you bring me up he said
[54:00] well the Lord won't answer me by dream
[54:01] or Vision well why of course why not I
[54:03] mean you're killing people
[54:06] mercy and brother Ram says see he says
[54:09] he said Saul had to be saved because
[54:12] Samuel was still a prophet he still had
[54:14] on the prophet's
[54:16] mantle right and then he said Saul
[54:20] you'll be with me tomorrow so brother R
[54:23] says wherever Samuel was that's where
[54:25] Saul and his Sons were so brother Ram
[54:28] says if if Saul wasn't saved then Samuel
[54:31] wasn't saved either that's a pretty good
[54:34] thought isn't it that's like a prophet
[54:36] of God thought amen because Sam Samuel
[54:39] said you'll be with me and brother said
[54:41] look he he died two years earlier he's
[54:43] still a prophet you always are what God
[54:45] made you to be see you keep those gifts
[54:47] Hallelujah everybody see that they're
[54:49] part of your character part of your
[54:50] spirit right like people that have the
[54:53] PO or the gift to write songs it's a
[54:54] gift it's a healing gift it's a gift
[54:57] people that speak in tongues it's a gift
[54:59] to them it's part of their human spirit
[55:01] it's part of the spirit that God
[55:04] created Samuel still has the prophetic
[55:08] gift but this is why God sought to kill
[55:11] him think about that remember God was
[55:12] trying to kill Moses as well how many
[55:14] you remember
[55:15] that because he neglected the abrahamic
[55:18] Covenant and he's trying to bring the
[55:20] children of Abraham out of Egypt and God
[55:22] said I'm going to kill you because
[55:24] you've neglected this
[55:26] see Church don't feel bad if God's after
[55:28] you God's giv you really bad spanking
[55:29] don't feel bad lots of Believers went
[55:31] through that Moses right and then even
[55:34] Jesus came to to to Paul and said Saul
[55:37] Saul why persecutest thou me right he
[55:41] said you're having a hard time kicking
[55:42] against the
[55:43] Pricks
[55:45] right so see look even in all this
[55:48] failure even all this disgrace God shows
[55:51] him Mercy but we see the humility of
[55:53] Saul Saul stops chasing David and he
[55:55] fasts and prays for 24 hours I should
[55:58] say pray but he fast for 24 hours I I
[56:00] don't know that he did pray so I
[56:01] shouldn't say
[56:03] that Glory 1 Chronicles 10:13 says so
[56:07] Saul died for his transgression which he
[56:09] committed against the Lord even against
[56:10] the word of the Lord which he kept not
[56:12] and also for asking counsel of one that
[56:14] had a familiar Spirit to inquire of it
[56:17] and inquire not of the Lord that isn't
[56:20] that something Church what did what did
[56:22] Samuel say I'm sorry what did Saul say
[56:24] Saul said God won't answer me when I
[56:26] inquire of him but God said you haven't
[56:29] inquired Saul was so double-minded he
[56:32] had thought he' inquired but he really
[56:34] hadn't inquired of the Lord because God
[56:36] said you didn't inquire see church
[56:39] that's see double-minded people they're
[56:40] so blind spiritually they think they're
[56:42] so spiritual but they're
[56:44] not they they they say remember Saul
[56:47] said I've obeyed the voice of the Lord
[56:49] and Saul Samuel said what's all that
[56:50] bleeding oute here what's all the oxen
[56:52] in the Sheep you didn't kill everything
[56:56] see double-minded people are so blind
[56:58] spiritually they can't even see the
[56:59] plain simple Bible truth laying before
[57:01] them is that right and so we see King
[57:05] Saul again King Saul he can't see it he
[57:08] said oh I've inquired of God God's not
[57:10] answering me but God said no you didn't
[57:12] inquire of me see you know what you know
[57:14] why church because you got to seek God
[57:16] with all your heart soul mind and
[57:18] strength so apparently Saul had not done
[57:21] that he had not sought God with all of
[57:23] his heart soul mind and strength and
[57:26] again God took his life God killed him
[57:30] right because of his Disobedience his
[57:32] transgression and in the inquiring of
[57:35] the familiar
[57:37] spirit all right we're almost done here
[57:40] by God's grace almost
[57:41] done that busy body clock now U and then
[57:45] in chapter uh 31 1st Samuel 31 Saul's
[57:48] wounded remember he tries to commit
[57:49] suicide by falling on his sword to avoid
[57:52] capture remember it didn't work even in
[57:54] that he failed even in that you feel and
[57:57] I'm not I'm not badmouthing Sor I'm just
[57:59] saying when a person tries to do things
[58:01] without God they get a lot of failures
[58:04] every understand
[58:05] that now look he's trying to take this
[58:08] into his hands he tries to take his own
[58:10] life into his hands just like he tried
[58:11] to take the sacrifice in his own hands
[58:13] at the beginning just like he tried to
[58:16] take the amalekites into his own hands
[58:18] church we don't we can't take anything
[58:19] into our own hands we got to wait on the
[58:21] Lord hallelujah we got to keep the word
[58:24] of God and wait on on the word of God
[58:27] see Saul was always trying to do it
[58:29] himself make this happen make this
[58:31] happen you can't do that you got to wait
[58:33] on God hallelujah everybody see that he
[58:36] even tries to take his own life and he
[58:37] fails at that see trying to take things
[58:41] into his own hand try to do things
[58:43] himself make things happen church we
[58:45] can't make anything happen
[58:51] right but we see some good here he goes
[58:53] out to fight the Lord's battles he knew
[58:55] he be with Samuel in Paradise he knew he
[58:57] was going to die that
[58:59] day it's of course bad he tried to take
[59:01] his own life but that's not the
[59:02] unpardonable sin remember brother R's
[59:03] mom told him that brother Ram's mom
[59:05] always thought suicide was the UNP
[59:07] partable sin brother R said no it's
[59:08] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost that's the
[59:11] UNP partable
[59:13] sin now what do we see we see the
[59:15] foolish virgin could the foolish virgin
[59:17] be saved with a a suicide attempt it
[59:19] looks like this according to this they
[59:20] could be because that's not the
[59:22] unpardonable sin right that's the
[59:24] torment I'll say this that's the torment
[59:26] of being
[59:29] double-minded all
[59:31] right somebody can see
[59:34] that then remember another uh another
[59:36] man from the Army come around and uh
[59:39] Saul asked him to kill him and so the
[59:40] man did and then remember David had that
[59:42] man die because he touched the Lord's
[59:46] anointed all right now let's close with
[59:48] this here let's go to second Samuel
[59:50] chapter 1 David's song and remember this
[59:53] was a beautiful part I think this was
[59:55] the end of part one of the movie
[59:58] David 2 Samuel 1:1
[1:00:03] 17-27 Saul has died we know he goes to
[1:00:06] be with Samuel he was saved he went to
[1:00:08] Paradise in the heart of the
[1:00:10] earth and then David sings a
[1:00:14] song Here we can see that David forgave
[1:00:18] Saul imagine if someone tried to kill
[1:00:20] you imagine if somebody threw a spear at
[1:00:22] you multiple times now for our day
[1:00:25] probably shoot a gun at you
[1:00:27] right he forgave him and church this
[1:00:31] really shows the power of the holy
[1:00:34] spirit with
[1:00:36] forgiveness this is why Jesus said if
[1:00:38] you can't forgive someone who sinned
[1:00:39] against you the heavenly father won't
[1:00:41] forgive
[1:00:42] either because if anybody had an excuse
[1:00:44] to be upset with somebody and not
[1:00:46] forgive them it was
[1:00:49] David and David lamented with this
[1:00:51] lamentation over who Saul the man who
[1:00:54] chased him down and tried to kill him
[1:00:56] and tried to throw Spears at him and
[1:00:57] kill him he lamented over his life see
[1:01:01] because he's got the Holy Spirit on him
[1:01:04] he sees it it's not the evil spirit on
[1:01:06] that person it's a it's a person in the
[1:01:07] image of
[1:01:09] God and over Jonathan his
[1:01:12] son so here he sees he's already
[1:01:14] lamenting he's sorry for sa for Saul
[1:01:18] look at verse 19 David calls Saul
[1:01:22] beautiful and
[1:01:24] mighty remember he was on numerous
[1:01:26] occasions and the church said he
[1:01:29] prophesied he he beat some of these uh
[1:01:32] he beat the Philistines numerous times
[1:01:33] he beat uh other ammonites he had some
[1:01:36] great
[1:01:37] victories and so look the holy spirit
[1:01:40] will look at the good we do amen not the
[1:01:42] evil that we do and the church said
[1:01:44] that's what brother R said I trust God
[1:01:46] he said I trust my uh my commentary will
[1:01:49] be written like uh David and Moses where
[1:01:51] God doesn't remember my mistakes like
[1:01:53] Abraham God don't remember my mistakes
[1:01:55] he only sees that I was trying to give
[1:01:57] be strong in faith and give God glory
[1:01:59] praise God oh my God God help me
[1:02:01] Hallelujah that's Romans chapter 4
[1:02:04] remember may God only look at what I'm
[1:02:06] trying to do and may God forgive all my
[1:02:12] mistakes that's what David Gets Anointed
[1:02:14] with when he sings this song how the
[1:02:17] Mighty Fall I'll be playing that one
[1:02:18] tomorrow morning when I
[1:02:20] study
[1:02:22] the Hallelujah beautiful
[1:02:24] song they the Mighty the beauty the
[1:02:27] beauty of Israel King Saul was the
[1:02:28] beauty of Israel when he was under the
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:32] mind not when he was double minded when
[1:02:34] he was single-minded he was the beauty
[1:02:36] of
[1:02:37] Israel he was a mighty King when he was
[1:02:40] under the right mind God help us to stay
[1:02:42] under the right mind
[1:02:44] Hallelujah verse
[1:02:46] 23 now David not only calls him uh
[1:02:50] beautiful Mighty now David calls him
[1:02:52] lovely Pleasant United Eagle lion sounds
[1:02:56] like the four anointing doesn't it you
[1:02:58] got two of the four in there right you
[1:03:00] got two I guess if he's Mighty that
[1:03:02] means a mighty man anointing could be
[1:03:04] three in there Saul and Jonathan were
[1:03:06] lovely and pleasant in their lives and
[1:03:08] in their death they were not divided see
[1:03:10] see uh Saul wasn't upset with Jonathan
[1:03:12] and David anymore he was United with
[1:03:14] them he had a repentant Heart
[1:03:17] Church and church remember remember the
[1:03:19] thief on the cross God forgave that man
[1:03:21] after mocking Jesus God forgave that man
[1:03:24] Jesus said today you'll be with me in
[1:03:26] Paradise that's amazing grace what what
[1:03:29] a murderer a murderer who killed all the
[1:03:31] priests he was
[1:03:33] pleasant I guess if God forgives all of
[1:03:36] his sins glory amen if God forgives all
[1:03:39] of our sins amen then we'll be pleasant
[1:03:41] to God too amen only if God forgives all
[1:03:44] of our sins so see David is under the
[1:03:46] anointing of the Holy Ghost here not his
[1:03:48] not his uh Vengeance we'd say not as
[1:03:52] human thoughts he's under the anointing
[1:03:54] of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:57] he says they were swifter than Eagles
[1:03:59] and stronger than
[1:04:00] Lions one time remember one time Saul
[1:04:03] was chasing after David but then a word
[1:04:05] came and said King Saul the Philistines
[1:04:07] are upon us and Saul left chasing David
[1:04:11] to go defend Israel that's why he's
[1:04:13] called swifter than
[1:04:15] Eagles see even even as he's chasing
[1:04:18] David he's able to leave that oh I got
[1:04:20] to go I got to try to help out our
[1:04:21] people by God's grace again
[1:04:24] double-minded Church double minded
[1:04:26] I want to kill him but I better go
[1:04:27] protect God's
[1:04:29] people right and how many grudges will
[1:04:31] people hold against people in the
[1:04:33] message I always think of uh uh William
[1:04:35] and beatric because they know so many
[1:04:37] things I've talked to some of them about
[1:04:39] some of the things they've seen you know
[1:04:40] in the message and what about what about
[1:04:42] this see the spirit of God forgives
[1:04:45] these things that's the Holy Spirit
[1:04:47] singing on David how many know he was a
[1:04:49] sweet psalmist the Bible says he sings
[1:04:51] Sweet songs Under The anointing of the
[1:04:53] Holy
[1:04:54] Spirit Hal
[1:04:56] and they were stronger than lions for
[1:05:00] the Lord when he had the right mind when
[1:05:04] he uh uh when he a overcame the
[1:05:06] double-mindedness when he had the right
[1:05:08] mind he was like an eagle he was like a
[1:05:10] lion for the Lord amen look what he even
[1:05:14] treated the sisters good look at verse
[1:05:15] 24 he even gave the sisters nice clothes
[1:05:17] how many sisters got some nice clothes
[1:05:19] on here tonight that's what King Saul
[1:05:21] did he sent the sisters some nice
[1:05:22] clothes ye Daughters of Israel weep over
[1:05:24] Saul he gave you scarl he gave you never
[1:05:26] had Scarlet clothes before that's what
[1:05:28] Saul gave
[1:05:29] you remember he he was good to you gave
[1:05:32] you some good nice
[1:05:33] clothes don't don't forget that David
[1:05:35] even under the spirit of
[1:05:37] God see you buy somebody some clothes
[1:05:40] that's a nice gesture of Love isn't
[1:05:42] it with other Delights who ha put on
[1:05:44] ornaments of gold upon your perel so
[1:05:47] they must have had some type of a nice
[1:05:48] ornaments on there maybe some
[1:05:50] pins maybe a cross or Star of David or
[1:05:53] something like that and David David says
[1:05:55] the Holy Spirit remembers this about
[1:05:58] Saul he did some good things but he did
[1:06:00] a lot of evil things
[1:06:03] too so what does the spirit of God
[1:06:05] remember the spirit of God remembers the
[1:06:07] good Hallelujah not the evil and he
[1:06:10] closes one more time in verse 25 and 27
[1:06:12] twice calling these men Mighty under the
[1:06:15] power of God he prophesied he defeated
[1:06:17] Kings Hallelujah my he he was so
[1:06:20] faithful uh in some of these times he'd
[1:06:23] run run the battle to defend Israel he
[1:06:25] give the women clothes he's a mighty man
[1:06:28] when he had the right mind let's stand
[1:06:30] to our
[1:06:31] feet little after almost 10 after
[1:06:37] 8 Mali can come here by
[1:06:41] God in this song David forgets all of
[1:06:46] his
[1:06:47] suffering church I don't have time but I
[1:06:49] could go to the Psalms and I could show
[1:06:51] you some of the Psalms he wrote when he
[1:06:52] was hiding away in the caves how many
[1:06:54] remember that he was complaining to God
[1:06:56] why am I hiding why am I being chased
[1:06:59] down in a cave and see under the Holy
[1:07:02] Spirit he forgets all of his trials and
[1:07:06] he only sees the good in
[1:07:08] people
[1:07:11] hallelujah so let's examine our hearts
[1:07:13] and lives if we're holding something
[1:07:15] against somebody let's remember what did
[1:07:16] the Holy Ghost do in
[1:07:18] David it just complimented them oh when
[1:07:21] they were in their right mind they were
[1:07:23] Mighty they blessed people they they
[1:07:25] were good to people that's what the Holy
[1:07:27] Spirit would do it forgets Hallelujah it
[1:07:30] really Church it really sends our sins
[1:07:32] as far as the East is from the West it
[1:07:35] really throws them in the sea of
[1:07:37] forgetfulness because remember through
[1:07:38] all those murders in the sea of
[1:07:40] forgetfulness that's where Grace steps
[1:07:43] in Hallelujah so I could really call
[1:07:46] this the message of Grace part 11 but
[1:07:47] I'm not going
[1:07:48] to because here we see the grace of God
[1:07:52] grace forgets all that David suffered
[1:07:59] hallelujah how many want to have that
[1:08:00] kind of Grace in their lives like the
[1:08:03] spirit of David was the Holy Spirit that
[1:08:05] was on David I'll say like that that's
[1:08:07] the real Spirit of God's love let's bow
[1:08:09] our hearts here as we have a word of
[1:08:13] prayer father God we thank you for
[1:08:15] tonight Lord God we're thankful for this
[1:08:16] opportunity to be in your house Lord now
[1:08:18] we see a second character
