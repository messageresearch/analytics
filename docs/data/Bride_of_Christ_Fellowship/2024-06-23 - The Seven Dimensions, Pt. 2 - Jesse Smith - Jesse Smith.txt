========================================

1 Corinthians uh 15:40 we'll read 40 and then we'll skip down to verse 44 by God's grace I'd like to look at the uh s Dimensions again we looked at it last Sunday night but I feel a little more confident uh preaching it today you know for the whole uh public to see by God's grace I had not studied it as much uh last Sunday but I got more time to study on it and of course I'm more confident in the word of God the Bible said the preacher must study himself approved unto God and so as you as a preacher spends time in the presence of God with the word of God he feels confident that the the truth that he's bringing is the word of God and so that's how I feel this morning and I trust it'll be a help to you uh by the grace of the Lord amen uh to our live streamers you know you may see this as uh part two well part one was not made public so that's why it's part two um and I I'll be reviewing part one of course uh briefly by God's grace so we're looking at part two of the seven dimensions of course I believe there's only two Dimensions but uh I don't make it a dividing topic you know uh this doesn't pertain to Salvation uh but it's a good exercise and rightly dividing the word of God and of course uh dealing with our Dimension praise God hallelujah we know we're not limited just our Dimension praise God our prayers go all the way up to the highest Dimension hallelujah amen so 1 Corinthians 15:40 I love how the Bible says that we have access unto the father by one Spirit Hallelujah we have access to the highest Dimension praise God while we're in this dimension so verse 40 I'll read that and then we can all read verse 44 so verse 40 says there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial so Celestial means Heavenly or spiritual and then terrestrial means Earthly or carnal or natural but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the testal is another didn't David say I'm fearfully and wonderfully made anyone who has a body can see the glory of the tral body Hallelujah let's read verse 44 together 1 2 3 it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body may God add as a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so we look at part two here um I have a lot lot more slides of course to show and then for our uh our you or our live streamers and so forth you know um if you want copies of this let me know I'm not sure why the TV went off there but try to get it back on here if you'd like a copy you can text me of course we do a copy of that send it to you by God's grace now I just found it interesting you know as I Was preparing this U you know 1 Corinthians 15 is all about the Rapture in fact the the the chapter ends verses 51 to 58 with the rapture uh and then right before this Rapture section Paul deals with the method of Resurrection uh in verse 35 you know some men say how are the dead raised up and Paul says uh and with what body do they come and then Paul says Thou fool so it's foolish to think that there is no afterlife it's foolish to think there's only one body right it's foolish to think this is it right and Paul says the natural body when it dies it's being planted like a seed and if you plant a seed it's going to come up so the Bible says when people die it's like they're being planted but they're promised a resurrection praise God so uh it's just a beautiful portion there Paul says it's foolish to think that there is no uh resurrection and the proof of that of course is the two kinds of bodies that Paul tells us about the celestial and the uh uh terrestrial and then then he even gets into the Lord Jesus how the Lord Jesus had a first a uh was a living I'm sorry was a a natural body but then he was made a quickening spirit the Bible tells us a lifegiving spirit so yeah we're trying to connect here so we'll just have to preach and see if we connect here by God's grace that's strange that it went out right now could not connect okay well very sorry about that maybe I'll try a little bit here by God's grace so we see there's uh two kinds of of bodies but then we also learn from the scripture there's two kinds of celestial bodies right there's a a theophany and then there is a glorified body so we see both kind of bodies Hallelujah brother man tells us there are three kinds of bodies and who is this mezic there's first the terrestrial body uh that's the body we live in now so we don't need to spend much time on that we're very familiar with that now this theophany is a little more uh deep uh it's spoken of in 2 Corinthians 1-5 Paul said if this if we drop the house of this body we have an eternal house in the heavens not made with Man Hands Hallelujah but it's made with God's hands and it's Eternal which means it was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Jesus says uh those bodies always Behold our face of the Father which is in heaven amen so there's a section in heaven where the theophanes must be because the Bible said as soon as we go from this one as soon as we leave this one our spirit and soul go to that theophany Hallelujah that body and that body has a white robe Hallelujah uh and brother R says that uh it has no shoes they're Barefeet in that in that uh that Dimension by God's grace so our theophany is white robed Hallelujah and we all look the same as far as the white robe but then we all have our different hair colors brother Ram says everybody's got you know blonde or brown or black whatever you got uh mixture whatever you got red I guess red we'd say uh you have that in that realm and these theop bodies are spiritual bodies and they're Angel bodies they're like Angel bodies they're waiting in heaven when they're not occupied but uh once we die we say if we die we go to occupy that body Hallelujah and then those theophanies can touch other theophanies brother Ram said the women were hugging him the men were hugging him and there was uh there was no hormones there was there was no human hormones there was no uh evil desires there was no evil feelings and we see that also in Daniel 10: 8-10 where the angel that vised Daniel said Michael had to fight with the the Prince of Persia so I could come down and minister to you and he says when I leave you I'll go back and join the fight so there's wrestling uh there's spiritual wrestling of Angels in that Dimension the the the theophany bodies can touch one another and wrestle but we know theophanes do not sleep they do not eat and they do not drink that's right that's what we see from the scripture so we we're comforted by that huah we're comforted that those of us who are believers uh that we if we have loved ones that have passed on we're comforted that that they go to the theophany praise God Amen so there's a theophany picture so I don't know why it's in and out but maybe the internet's in and out I don't know um but we're comforted that think about that all the loved ones we we've known that have passed on we we we know they're in a white robe right now Hallelujah and we know uh they're enjoying the uh they're enjoying their life there a 100 million more times than we're enjoying our life hallelujah amen and then of course there's the glorified body this is what Jesus had when he rose from the dead uh this can be touched by flesh bodies right because Jesus first said don't touch me till I'm ascended and I'm accepted in heaven my blood's accepted on The Mercy Seat in heaven but then he come back down the Bible said they laid his feet and uh we we know other believers touched him as well after the resurrection so it's not a full Spirit body it's a glorified flesh body and it can eat and drink Hallelujah brother Austin and I were talking he had a good thought you know in the future home the Nations will need to eat from the tree of life it's fruit the Bible said they'll eat from the fruit and uh the leaves will be for the healing of Nations and so there's something about our glorified bodies God's going to allow us to eat over there we're going to finally experience the real taste of a good strawberry praise God we're going to really experience what a real orange should taste like without without genetically modified products amen without any anything in the in the soil or anything in the the Agri culture all it's just it's perfect agriculture the way God intended it Hallelujah we'll taste it for what it should have meant to be should have been in the beginning or or what it was in Adam and Eve Hallelujah but we need this body church as we saw we need it for the Millennium Hallelujah uh we need it for the the new city praise God this is the body we'll have in the Millennium and we'll keep that body Hallelujah in fact after the Rapture you know the brother R says first brother said first at the Rapture if we're here on Earth our bodies will get swallowed up by a glorified body and and then he said we'll go to the air to meet our theophany and then all the bodies will be combined into one body and so from the moment from the Rapture through the Millennium and Armageddon on down goag and Magog future home we'll have that body once and for all Hallelujah we'll never more have to come down and descend back down to this uh pest house or this this body of uh corruption the Bible calls it amen hallelujah and I feel like I missed something here uh in this did I miss something okay no and with that thought of mind I I just thought I would share this you know we looked at the Millennium for two services in a row and I I I I feel like the scripture showed me how to differentiate between the Millennium and the future home and if you can understand these few simple points then it's easy to tell which scriptures apply to which time period it's very easy so the Millennium in the Millennium Sinners are still a curse they still deal with curse right but in revelation 22 the Bible said there's no more curse amen so whatever the whatever the context of the scripture is telling about it's easy to place it because there's only two choices it's very very simple right so and that's what I love God is always revealed in Simplicity right and then the Millennium Nations can be deceived but the Bible said in revelation 22 the nations are healed right there's no more there's no more of anything there's no more deception no more wrongs nothing it it's total healing Hallelujah then the third one you know Nations can be destroyed the Bible said the fire comes out and destroy on the Nations that Satan deceives and uh so there's death there's still death during this time period but Revelation 21:4 the Bible said when the New Jerusalem comes down there's no more death Hallelujah so no curse total healing and there's no death in the future home the New Jerusalem so with that scriptural Foundation it's very easy then to place them and uh uh brother Chad Lamb gave the jungman city Saints a nice board and that's your pastor's drawing that's my best time not I could draw freehand without the help of a computer so I drew that on Thursday night there uh of course I only I tried to limit my preaching but I realized as I was preaching there's no curse here but there is curses during the time of the Millennium so if you want to copy that I can easily send that to you but I'll try to make a better uh digital copy of that by God's grace so let's just quickly re review you know part one of the seven dimensions brother Ram said every Doctrine everything else must be based upon the word of God must come from the word of God not just one place but it's got to be Genesis the Revelation saying the same thing and we can't base our thoughts upon one little scripture right and then he says you know we must prove All Things by the scripture if it's contrary to my faith yet the scripture says so the scripture is right and I'm wrong the scripture is always right the only way to do anything is to come back to the scripture and brother R said even when they he did questions and answers way back in 57 he said said just remember I can be wrong I don't claim to be right on everything that I do I try to be right but maybe I'm wrong and if I am wrong then you just forgive me and I pray God will too because I don't mean to be wrong I just try to answer them the way that I just for uh not Prejudice I try to answer them the very best of my knowledge and if I have to alter my ideas on a Bible question I think that's just the thing to do we should alter any time when God speaks God's word because it's God's word amen and of course you know that if you as you listen to brother random down through the years he changes on almost every topic and how can you blame him he was raised a son of a drunkard he wasn't even raised in church from what I understand he didn't go to church till he got saved at 19 if I'm not mistaken 19 or 20 he got saved so imagine if you never went to church for the first 19 or 20 years of your life and then you went to church you know you would be learning things the first time it would take you many years to really find the the Deep truth of God in the scripture praise God now brother ads accuser was called flip-flops but that's sad shame on them but they flip-flopped on many things they were in the message and they left the message so they flip-flopped right so uh we just must be humble praise God we must all know that God's helping us all to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord now many other quotes I'm skipping those U and this doesn't pertain to Salvation it's a now the study on seven dimensions is a small study there's about 28 hits on it um it's very it's small you know even compared to third poll there's 54 quotes on that it's very similar to something like 1977 a very small sample of quotes uh and again uh brother there's many things brother Ram says uh he doesn't have thus sayith the Lord on it and he he says if I don't have thus sayith the Lord on it then I don't have anything from the Lord on it and he said that's just my opinion and there is a quote brother cam preached lately too I I don't have it ready but but brother man said my opinion is no better than anybody else's opinion now that's quite a statement to say now we would all think well no brother R your opinion is better than others you know but he said my opinion is no better than anybody else's so if you believe brother brandom then you understand brother brandham right you don't try to exalt anyone else remember brother Brandon one place said there's eight Dimensions so if you believe every words thus say the Lord boy you are you you got a problem Hallelujah CU because you're you're saying there's seven but then brother Bram said there's eight okay so here's my my this is all of our previous understanding right until this year right I was tell my wife I said I feel like this year God's opened up a lot of wonderful Revelation just this year uh you know on the book of Romans and here the dimensions and the uh the Millennium uh different different thoughts and subjects I've never had before you know uh going deeper in the word of God and I'm thankful for that praise God so here's where people get seven you know in the region we live they think there's four right and then they say the fifth is Hell which also has regions sixth would be the region of the sav uh Under The Altar and then you seventh would be the very altar of God uh the seventh Dimension now after watching a highly recommended sermon like I said I asked I asked myself does the bible teach seven dimensions and my my humble answer was no I I don't see the Bible ever saying there's seven dimensions like it doesn't say those words seven dimensions so I knew I had to study it and I believe after studying there's just two Dimensions there's Celestial and terrestrial or I could just call Heavenly spiritual or terrestrial or Earthly that's the way I see it now by God's grace cuz if you if you go study the word Dimension there's there's over five definitions of the word Dimension there's there's lots of ways to Define it the only one that makes sense to me is a level of existence or Consciousness okay that's what a dimension is you're you're you're existing somewhere now what's amazing is that Jesus said the son of man which is in heaven when he was on Earth so so there's Jesus had an existence where he was existing both on Earth and in heaven at the same time I would say you do too because the Bible says we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah and we have an eternal house in the heavens Hallelujah and that's the more real version of us brother William right brother said that realm is more real than this realm Hallelujah so I have a real body that's more real than this one and it's in heaven hallelujah amen that's what the Bible says amen prise God so if we're seated in Heavenly places that means we have a a house we have a body that's in heaven and it dwells in heaven hallelujah amen it's a We Exist there right but we just live in our souls here though right uh like brother M said it's unoccupied that theophan is there but it's unoccupied we're our spirit and soul occupy this Dimension here amen but there is a part of us that exists somewhere else amen hallelujah so it seems there's only two levels of existence and the Bible shows people being conscience in both existences yeah now what I mean by that um and maybe I didn't word that the right way but even the Jews under the altar they have they're existing there right but they're aware that they haven't been Avenged on the earth okay then you have the the rich man Jesus told the parable the rich man of Lazarus the the rich man is there in the heart of the earth he's in Hell he's in torment in the prison house but yet he's still aware of his brothers up there on Earth because they haven't died yet he's aware they haven't died yeah so he's existing there but he's conscious that wow there my brothers aren't here I don't see would have known yeah so uh and as as Jesus said you know as Jesus said the son of man which is in heaven now I'm not ready to preach on that verse I need to I just always thought it as um God being able to to exist everywhere simultaneously how God is all powerful omniscient Hallelujah omnipresent by for knowledge yeah but also how uh we would say the spirit of Christ uh was the the holy ghost that was in Christ was also in heaven because you can't limit God's presence Hallelujah now so I believe there's two Dimensions we have uh or two elements or two areas of Consciousness you have you have uh the Heavenly the celestial and the Earthly and now we went through these verses already but I'll just read them briefly God Alone made heaven and earth Isaiah 37:16 Isaiah 44:24 I the Lord that maketh all things that stretch forth the heavens alone that spread abroad the Earth by myself so God stretched out the heavens and then God spread about the Earth and he even said it the Bible said he even set it on foundations amen the Earth is on foundations invisible foundations hallelujah amen other words the earth the earth is on founding pillars right it's hanging there on invisible pillars Hallelujah by the power of God brother R said the Unseen World is more real than the scen he uh you know he's having this debate and he says anything that can be scientific scientifically proven that I think there's nothing to it but I said I don't like to be different but I have to be now the things that can be scientifically proven is not real it's only the things that's not scientifically proven is real he said that's ridiculous I said all right I want to ask you something can you tell me what love is could you scientifically show me what love is go down to the drugstore and buy me a quarter's worth of love I need some more see you can't see it it's the Unseen show me what life is I need a just a little more life could you buy me a quarter's worth show me what life is show me what love is what personality is what the holy spirit is what God is it's the Unseen things that's real lasting these things are temporal and perishable here on Earth right and brother BR had that one debate and uh the the the man with the a atheist and he said he said I don't believe in anything that can be seen and brother Ram kind of made a joke at the end he said well I don't believe in your uh I he said show me your mind he said I can't show it to you then brother R said I don't believe in you right because I can't see your mind show it to me right and that and that deals with this as well there's a realm scientists can't prove they can't prove where's the mind they can't tap into that they can't see that Unseen World but it's just it's more real than this one hallelujah amen the Unseen your mind your spirit your soul is more real than this hallelujah amen because the this is temporal this is perishable but the soul that's got the spirit of God is eternal hallelujah amen and here he says it more plainly he said the holy spirit is more real than the sunshine amen the sun will fail but the Holy Spirit Can't Fail amen it don't only light for the sense of light but it lights for the soul a light of Glory that leads us to God that re that projects rather Calvary to us and the sufferings of our Lord Jesus the oncoming judgment and the Escape for those who want to come I'd rather be totally blind physically and have my spiritual sight Hallelujah than to be totally blind spiritually and have my physical sight I want to have spiritual sight other words I want the thing that's Eternal Hallelujah am our if we lose our natural U capacities or abilities it'd be better at least to have the spiritual capacity because that contacts the Eternal World Hallelujah God's world Amen so this is my little sample again out of the invisible God came a out of the invisible Spirit came a visible Spirit realm the first thing that he made of course was the the logos to live in this spiritual realm right and out of Christ Christ created all things so Christ created this this Physical Realm that can be seen in the physical so this is the Earthly or physical or ter Dimension but it's inside the spiritual Dimension that God made first the spiritual is more real this is more real so the realm of Angels the realm of God's Dr that's more real amen than the realm we live in and so this is a visible this is the the celestial realm that God made and then inside of this or we say overlapping this is this physical Dimension or layered maybe layered on top right you have the spiritual Dimension but then there's got to be a terrestrial dimension now that's the the and and you know I I I just say you know I can fit all the seven dimensions in these two because in the terrestrial you have light matter time and science right because even with the frequencies like I said the frequencies like the the cell phone signals and uh the signals to the satellites those don't reach up to God's Throne right God doesn't need an internet connection to contact us right so all four of those are inside this terrestrial which I also call the first heaven but then you have the celest which is Hell paradise and God's Throne that's all in the spiritual realm where demons are right where angels are where God is amen where souls are where Spirits are amen so they they all fit inside of the two so I'm not taking any anything away from this I just have a different way of seeing it praise God right I'm just going to use it the Bible definitions for it m but if you're talking to me and all you know or somebody talking to me on the internet and all you know is the fifth dimension I can talk to you about that I understand I understand what you're talking about that's not going to hinder me from understanding you it's not going to hinder us from understanding one another yeah but if I'm just using Bible words these are the Bible words you don't see these words in the Bible right all right now the third heaven now to understand the third heaven I'll just skip to the third heaven Paul says I knew a man in Christ about 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such and one caught up to the third heaven so I believe there's third three Heavens the first heaven for us is uh what we see we can see Earth the atmosphere Space Universe and Beyond hopefully one of these days brother William we can look through a good telescope and really see out there you know but we'd only be seeing the first Heaven Hallelujah that's the terrestrial remember these are all galaxies and in each Galaxy is billions of stars right each galaxy has billions so wherever the Milky Way is you know maybe it's that little one I don't know there's billions of stars in there but we're the only planet with life out of all these trillions and trillions of stars that's the first heaven now the second heaven is where the saved go right the the saved now brother R says these are the Jews under the altar in heaven the altar of incense the prayers right because they're praying right when will you avenge us Lord see that they're praying yeah now there's some other realm brother tells us that's far from this where we live brother R said I turned around it's beautiful brother brother raham said he looked at his body laying there right when he left his body MH in the beyond the current of time he said I turned around and it was a field MH and then all the sisters come running to me they all hugged me and then the brothers came running to me hallelujah amen yeah he just turned around he was lifted up from the bed he said then he was standing in some spiritual Dimension hallelujah praise God Amen right so he looked and there's a field so there's this in in the sixth Dimension somewhere there's called a paradise amen amen and that's where all the Saints Go hallelujah amen but then maybe F further from that somewhere there's this altar of incense where the Jews go and I'd say the foolish virgin uhhuh because they're under the altar crying oh Lord holy and true how long does thou make until thou avenge blood upon the Earth and make war and avenge us amen and the Lord answers them back just a little short season more of your people need to be martyred and then I'll avenge your blood on the earth so each one of these is a Jewish Soul Jewish soul and I I believe that's the second heaven I can't prove that but all I know is that Paul said he was lifted up in the highest Dimension there was three Heavens right right this is this is my best understanding and I I'm open to correction but I just want to be humble praise God I don't I don't know I'm just saying the best I can and the third I love this picture isn't a beautiful man there's a rainbow around the throne Hallelujah you got the 24 ouers you got the four beasts just like the Bible says now we just need the seven spirits of God somewhere I don't know where that is but at least we got the seven golden candlesticks amen we got most of that amen they're just missing a few things up there just a beautiful picture now that's God's Throne Hallelujah now and then what's further Beyond this brother Ram says that when the lamb came forth to take a book so I don't know where maybe the book would go here or something but man said he came out of the holiest of holies where he was making intercession well the Bible says there's a holiest of holies in heaven so is just this Throne the holiest or is there some old some place behind the throne where there's a holies of holies chamber I don't know but remember this was in the uh the the the altar of incest was in the Holy place but not the most holy place right right now what's interesting is the uh the seven golden candlesticks are there in the holiest now that's interesting right CU before they were in the most holy place in Moses's Tabernacle and Solomon's Tabernacle so I can't understand everything but I'm just taking the Bible for what it says because I know the Bible won't tell me a lie Hallelujah there's just some greater Revelation he's going to need all eternity to explain all this to us hallelujah hallelujah so see there there's a third heaven and then there's the all Heavens he uh he Jesus ascended I'm sorry Jesus that descended is the same also that ascended up before I'm sorry far above all Heavens that he might fill all things so Jesus filled this realm but then he also fills the other Realms as well so there's more than one heaven and Paul tells us there's at least three so that's my best to understand it and then Paul thought well maybe I was caught in the third Heaven Paul said how that he was caught up into Paradise he heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter now the word Paradise in the Greek doesn't mean this that it used to be in Paradise in the heart of the Earth but now it's the upper regions of the heavens upper yeah right so there's there's a realm of heaven but then there's a higher Realm Of Heaven yeah Hallelujah which we would say if Paul was caught into Paradise that's either the sixth Dimension or the second heaven not to be confusing or he was caught up into the very Throne of God the third heaven okay so now this is for the children if you haven't heard these so the order of creation was first God stretched forth a spiritual Dimension God made a Celestial space to live in that's the first thing because he would he fed all he he's he's infinite he didn't have a limit to the space he lived in he was an infinite Spirit but then he created a spiritual space that could be seen yeah okay he stretched forth the heaven and he stretched that forth God stretched out this the spiritual Celestial realm Hallelujah and so after that then the logos was created so the logos could have a place right so and then this was of course the third heaven or the seventh Dimension was created next so the logos had a throne right so he created the the logos but then the logos needed a throne to dwell in yeah to be seen and worshiped by the Angels right so the next thing then would have been after the logos would have been this heavens and then after the logos was created and he's got a throne in heaven then he creates the angel so he could re worshiped hallelujah amen he still hasn't created the Earth yet right and then the logos of course created this terrestrial or Earthly Dimension so the first thing we have is the space and we got the logos uh the Bible said oh yeah the Bible said he was rejoicing always before him so when God made this first logos or Pillar of Fire that logos was rejoicing before the invisible Spirit that's what Proverbs 8:30 says I wisdom was rejoicing before the father before there was even a foundation of the world Hallelujah talk about some good father and son time there that's what they had at the beginning remember Jesus said Lord give them the glory which the the same Glory or no Jesus said glorify me with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world Amen John 17:5 Hallelujah so that's the glory Jesus had the glory that was the son of God he shared the glory of the invisible father he was the visible image of it amen and that's what brother Ram said in 1953 he said now we can't see nothing yet but by just eyes of Supernatural we see a Halo sitting there that's that Halo I was talking that's the Halo now that's the Son of God the L God now I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity so Jesus is just playing before the father there having a a play time having a worship time we'd say or maybe rejoicing time the Bible say it's a dancing time a singing time a rejoicing time Hallelujah and now in in his imaginary makeup he began to think of what things would be and I can hear him say let there be light and when he did an Adam burst and the sun came into existence she world around hundreds of billions millions of years forming like clinkers and burning and forming like it is today still burning still breaking atoms so now the the order was again remember you have the son by himself with the father but then the son created this heavenly realm that beautiful picture I just right somewhere you got God's throne in there remember Satan wanted to try to ascend above the clouds the Bible said we we talked that last week yeah here's where Lucifer said it Lucifer said I will Ascend into heaven I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God so God had a throne somewhere and Satan said I can exalt my throne above that amen right he said I'll sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north so you want to go to the north side of heaven and uh live on the mountain of the congregation of angels I will send above the heights of the clouds there's the clouds again he wanted to ascend above that so see God had to create a spiritual space right he had to create a a Celestial uh atmosphere of existence Hallelujah but I love what the Bible said Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the north of Hell amen amen so now that the logos has created this now he can start creating uh the natural realm so brother said so my opinion the first thing he made was Angels then they worshiped him that made him God now the Angels began to worship him that was before there was ever a molecule on Earth he says that was way back before the Earth cuz remember brother R said the Angels shouted the stars and morning Stars sang together when the foundations of the earth were laid Hallelujah so when God made this and then God put the Earth in here then all the Angels were rejoicing and saying glory to God in the highest amen I'm going to create life in another realm that's what Job 38 says hallelujah so God had already created the Angels but the Angels were Witnesses of God creating the Earth and I like what brother Braham says brother Ram says uh now he made the sun now the first thing you know a big clinker fell off from it weighed about just about this Earth so brother Ram just was dramatizing he said maybe the Earth came out of the sun right and then this logos here the Son of God is watching this Earth come out of the sun and the logos let that Earth fall for he says a 100 million years and then he stops it stop right there so whichever realm you know he let it come where I don't know where the sun is in here but he let it fall for a million billion years and says stop right there mhm and God did that with all the stars and the church said amen and the Bible said he knows them all by name church he knows about your situation today praise God be that and that's easy to him this is easy to him Hallelujah nothing can hinder God if God knows all about that God's Watching Over You Hallelujah God's placed you right where you are Hallelujah if he placed a son the moon where they are then God place you where you are Hallelujah he said then another one flies off he lets it fall for a million years and then he stops that one brother said what is he doing he's writing his Bible amen he's writing the story of Creation in the skies Hallelujah so are their Dimensions blending now this is a little different thought I don't think they're blending I think they've always just had access one to another okay that's just my thought I think the terestrial has always overlapped the celestial since the celestial was created first and is more real than the terestrial right think about this since Adam and Eve's time there's always been evil spirits that used to be in the celestial realm and they can actively come in the terrestrial realm since Adam and Eve right right because the Bible said Satan was an Eid in the garden of God well Satan's a Celestial being yeah he's not flesh and blood yeah right but he entered into the Flesh and Blood of the serpent in order to produce a Serpent's Seed that's right right but then he left the serpent then after that because he's a spiritual being he's a Celestial being and even God even the even the spirit of God the theophany of God Amen would come down and walk in the garden naturally I just had that thought too at the burning bush what kind of fire was that that wasn't a natural fire right that was a holy fire Hallelujah that was a Celestial fire Hallelujah coming down and acting like it's burning up a bush but it's not really Burning It Up hallelujah it's just looking like it's burning amen amen so these Celestial beings and the presence of God are just actively constantly moving in and out and then go a little deeper what about you you're inside of you is a spiritual being and how many know there's evil spirits battling you throughout the day trying to get in here yeah so they're just allowed they're they just have access but they can't do anything unless they get permission from God hallelujah amen right that's right and then you in your spiritual mind like I told those some of those Saints we were going through some mind battles on Thursday I said cast it down and I was explaining you know the the spiritual things just cast it down put it under your feet spiritually not naturally you can stop all day you'll still have mind battles but spiritually you can cast it down in other words don't think about it anymore say get behind me Satan Hallelujah amen it doesn't have to be in our thoughts it doesn't have to be in the spiritual realm inside of us so we' got a Celestial existence inside of us hallelujah amen amen everybody catch that you got a celestial spirit and soul inside of you right but it's it's it's it's inside this body in a trust World hallelujah amen brother R said I'm a spiritual being living in a natural life hallelujah we're Spiritual Beings living in a natural world hallelujah amen and it just the way we live just manifests what's on the inside oh May the spirit of God manifest through our lives Hallelujah more and more so people can see wow they're not of this world this brother brother amen is a brother of a different world hallelujah amen he's not of this world Amen he came from Heaven hallelujah amen amen each one of us but they can say this world is not our home amen I'll say this until the New Jerusalem comes down amen see I mean uh these the beings have access to the terrestrial at the plan of God or the per or the will of God I'll say like that remember uh and notice in church that there was there was a certain day there's a certain day on God's Celestial calendar not our calendar God Celestial cander where all the demons have to report what have you been up to where you been going look what God asked him when when comes thou where you been now God knows where those demons have been but God wants them to tell tell the truth cuz they cause they Cause people to lie so God wants them to tell the truth hallelujah and so they all have to report on a certain day up to heaven isn't that wonderful when you don't feel those spirits around you very much Hallelujah they're reporting to to God Amen that's what the Bible calls a season of rest Hallelujah remember the devil left Jesus for a season hallelujah amen and so the demons that battle us that's why I told one of the brothers too I said you know we're just going to go through battles it's going to be one of the it's going to be either lust of the eyes lust of the fresh pride of life you're going to battle one more than the other true right but I said enjoy those seasons of rest but get yourself stronger because you know the devil's coming back Hallelujah CU here we can see they leave they got to go report for a season that's when we can enjoy we can live on the Mountaintop by God's grace amen amen hallelujah but then the Lord gives them permission he says behold all that job hath is in thy power only on himself put forth on hand now we know he got access to his body after this right in Chapter 2 so we can see that these uh Celestial beings have constant access to the terrestrial realm amen so I don't think they're blending I just feel like they just they've always had access yeah right so my opinion there's no blending the only blending is the New Jerusalem amen because heaven goes down to earth Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there ye may be also Hallelujah amen and who's Jesus Jesus Is God he's king of kings and Lord of lords amen so the final event we see is heaven uh the Throne of Heaven coming down to earth and now it's Blended all together Hallelujah that that's my humble opinion by God's grace because all demonic and Holy Ghost activity in the terrestrial Dimension uh it goes on until the New Jerusalem but this is a good thought too this was brother William and I were talking about this church throughout time of human history there's increasing and decreasing of demonic activity it all depends if the people open themselves up to the spirit of God like I visited Charles finny uh his grave and we learned about Charles finy there was such a holy atmosphere where they wouldn't even wear tight clothes the whole city think about that a whole city with sisters dressed holy oh it's a it's a prefigure to the Millennium amen they they almost had like a prefigure to the mum imagine a whole city where no one smokes cigarettes they had it yeah when they established some of these early cities in America even early States think about that they had such a an atmosphere see the spirits weren't able to work on them they had such overcoming power amen amen but then people backslide and now I thought today what would Charles finny say if he could walk down the street today see these crazy dressed women half naked women hair colors look like the rainbow purple green orange and pink and what would you say now he' probably pass out sometimes we feel like passing out but look the days and know we're so wicked God stopped striving with men now what what does striving mean God was pleading with man so God was sending his holy spirit angels to try to deal with these people but they so many of them grieved him away that it it was as if there was there was more demon activity on the earth because they grieved the spirit of God away amen but the dimensions weren't blending there was just more activity of the demonic realm because of the love of iniquity and that's what the Bible said repeats in this day Jesus said because the love iniquity uh evil seducers will wax worse and worse amen right because the love of many has grown cold oh you should feel so good if you love the people in here amen you should feel so wonderful if you know the love of God is in my heart and I want to love my brothers and sisters and I even want to love Sinners hallelujah amen because that's what the world is lacking the world is lacking the real love of Jesus Christ amen they don't have that because it's withdrawn off their life they grieve the holy spirit so much they don't love one another we should be so grateful if we love people and people love us amen hallelujah you can read that in Genesis 6 1-13 now did you know brother said the the sixth Church age was the age of the open door where the Pope's power was decreased think about that during the Philadelphian Church age with all those wonderful missionaries uh John living Stone and William Cary that's that's he's a very famous one to India and all the missionary work the spirit of God had an Open Door the gospel had an open door and the powers of Satan on the pope to kill the Saints had decreased right so there was an age of great Revelation amen also the first 20 years after Pentecost before the Ephesian church the church age started 53 so from 33 to 53 ad was a wonderful time where the church was growing Hallelujah now they had persecution but they overcame all of it by God's grace so you see there there's times when the church grows and uh there's times when the spirit of God is having more preeminence praise God Amen but now today is the day of the greatest deception according to 2 Timothy 3:13 and it's also a double evil day like the days of Noah and the days of Sodom right so we can see how most people they all only imagine how to do more evil in their lives rather than good just like the days of Noah right then we also see sodomy many of course increasing in many places so today is not a day where there's a lot of Holy Ghost activity that's not because of God it's because of people grieving the spirit of God can everybody see that by God's grace now I believe now this might strike you a little maybe something new I believe the 20 million demons loose during the six trumpet I don't believe they loose yet I know brother brother talked about it and thought they were but remember the first trumpet burns up a third of the grass and burns a third of the trees the first trumpet yeah right so has that happened yet no has a third of the Earth been burned over with trees no so if the first trumpet hasn't blown the sixth trumpet hasn't blown and remember the first trumpet can't be blown until the 144,000 have been sealed in their foreheads so who's a Bible believer that's my question I say kindly I'm I'm zealous but I say it kindly who's a real Bible believer Hallelujah am right the Bible says you the Bible says the Angels can't hurt the the trees or the grass or anything until the servants have been sealed in their foreheads 144,000 hallelujah amen so see I believe these 200 million demons they'll be loose but it's simply more demonic activity and this is true because the Millennium will have much less demonic activity because the Earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord like the waters cover the sea hallelujah amen there's still going to be Satan right Satan's going to be bound up though during the Millennium but it's the absence of it's the absence of Satan right where they still have sin in their members amen right they'll still have because they they live through the Armageddon that means those who live through Armageddon still have the bodies like we have but they'll have a perfect environment to live in amen amen oh there be no there'll be no EX TOS from all the planes right people are all concerned about that they say they're concerned about that yet they keep flying on private jets right the people that are concerned about it they keep flying in private jets that's called hypocrisy amen but all that'll be cleaned over all all be cleaned out so people will be able to live for a thousand years if they honor God hallelujah that's right I only say this is now I would say the only possible overlapping now if there is overlapping it would be hell in the heart of the earth that would be the only overlapping that I can see because there is a spiritual realm in the heart of the Earth where souls and Spirits go to when they die right we also know what's where Satan is because Jesus said so shall so so shall the son of man be three days and nights in the heart of the earth amen and then Paul says that Jesus ascended but he also descended into lower parts of the earth so God has a spiritual God has a a Celestial realm inside the heart of the Earth yeah and we also call it the prison house because he went to preach uh to spirits that were in prison everybody with me so far my God's Great I know it's a little bit of her you I love brother said brother said he said you're going to find out one of these days when you go to heaven how looking forward to that you don't fly off to somewhere else you're still right here too just in another dimension faster than this yeah so brother says that Dimension is close so you know if so when I draw that picture of you know the the the terrestrial the celestial it looks like it's far away but somehow it's actually really close because remember even acts 17 said though he be not far from us remember that uh God placed Us in these bounds of our habitation so we would reach to him so we' feel after him so we would reach out in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah because he's really not far from us hallelujah yeah that other dimension is much faster we see it in a couple examples because Micaiah described the Heavenly Council for ahab's Destruction so think about that before God brings his word to pass he has to have a meeting in heaven to figure out how it's going to be accomplished now he knows how it's going to go but he gives the demons and the angels a chance to participate so like our friend ny's had some Court situations right well that's what God has to do in heaven before things happen on Earth yeah and Court takes a long time from what I've heard that's been I went there one time when I was 17 I don't remember it except bad memories I'm only scarred by that uh so I don't remember how long it was because I hit I it rear ended somebody because I wasn't paying attention you know he was crying and it was a very I felt very bad about that but I don't remember how long Court lasted but in heaven we see how it must go faster it's much faster than this realm here because you're not limited by anything amen we're limited here by strength and rest and food and energy and all we're limited by all these things but in that realm they're not limited hallelujah amen and church then this court situation would have to happen for every believer and unbeliever because we saw a court situation for job did we not Glory that's good one I didn't even see that now glory amen there's another Court situation that was just between God and the devil brother called it a testimony service it might have been a testimony service but either way it's a gathering about a Believer where God let Angels and Demons come in and have a discussion about their lives amen hallelujah and God has to do this before the word comes to pass yeah so before God took Bob right before God took mu wife there had to been some discussion about it in heaven there had to been something discussed about it right or before God uh I don't know uh you we can look at different times where Satan anointed people before Satan anointed people did some terrible damage there had to be some type of meeting in heaven where God allowed it amen that's all right so there's a lot of heavenly counsil meetings going on so brother Ram says Heaven's a busy Place amen okay you remember this I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of Heaven standing by him on his right and left and the Lord said who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Routh Gilead and one said in this manner another said so at least two angels or two demons get to say well I think this okay now you've had your peace let's let the other one speak okay I think this then God said I'm sorry and then God let a third spear come up and he said I will go forth and persuade him so God lets demons talk at these Heavenly Council meetings and the Lord said wherewith now God knew how it would happen but look how humble he is he lets himself sit on the throne when he's the creator of all this he he limits himself to a throne and then he lets demons have ideas he lets them share their ideas like it's valuable or something it's not right but God just lets it play to his plan hallelujah amen for his glory the lying spirit said I'll go forth and be a lying spirit in the mouth of All His prophets and he said Thou shalt persuade him and Prevail also go forth and do so aren't you glad Mah didn't receive that spirit amen was he tested yes he was tested he was standing right there when 450 were prophesied and see Church aren't you glad you get to have the spirit of truth hallelujah you can stand there a bunch amongst of lying spirits and demonic activity isin't that amazing you can stand right there amongst the lying spirits but you've got the Holy Spirit and the elect cannot be deceived hallelujah oh my glory god acts like he doesn't know the answer but he gives evil spirits permission to do what he already knew they do yeah here's a good one too brother said that dimension faster and this scripture struck me yesterday didn't Jesus say I beheld Satan as Lightning falling from Heaven is lightning fast or slow super fast like once you see it you wish oh I wish I could slow that down and see that again you're looking for the next one to just enjoy that Split Second That twinkly of an eye and so here this proves by the Bible this proves those demons move way faster than we move amen right Hallelujah and now remember Satan is not lightning but he moved as Lightning right so when Michael First cast sat on to Earth it was quick he went right down here to earth like lightning see that's why God brother said God if he wanted to when he saved Shadrach me sh and abedo brother Ram said he stepped down himself and he saved them he said he did a god-sized job in other words God said Angels you're not going I'm going to go and brother said he passed the milky white way and all these things he did it so fast right cuz it's his creation and he he has no limit to how he can move but he tries to give us some way to understand it amen then he says these dimensions are not I'm not far from you all these things oh if he's not far from us that means his love is closer to us as well hallelujah amen his love for us his protection for us it's all in the hands of almighty God Amen just like the Bible say the Holy Ghost descended like a Dove on Jesus the Holy Ghost is not a dove yeah but the Bible tries to give us some figurative language to understand how God moves that's right is that something the Holy Ghost move real slow real tender right and then Satan move like lightning real fast interesting so I believe the changing of Dimensions if you can change Dimensions is just called ascending and descending right because the Lord came down at the Tower of Babel right that word means to descend he descends down yeah so he goes He descends from the suio down to the trust yeah right we already saw it with Lucifer and then uh you know Jacob saw the dream of the the latter angels He was seeing Angels Ascend and descend he was seeing them go up to heaven on this ladder CU God's trying to give them an understanding just try to understand this a little bit amen you're finite you're not infinite right I'm just trying to give you a way to understand it y and then the Bible again says Jesus ascended on high but he also descended to the lower parts of the earth and then we know he filled all heaven so Jesus filled the first Heaven second heaven third heaven he's outside of Heavens amen he's the creator of the heavens hallelujah amen you can't be limited to just one heaven and here's where brother man says you know he he had that dream and like I told you he his soul left his body and he see he saw his body laying there and then he talks to a voice up there he talks to a voice up in the sixth Dimension and he says well if I pass on I want to see Jesus he was all my life I want to see him what is he all your life church amen I hope you and I can say that at the end of our road amen I want to see Jesus he was all my life he's all I live for amen hallelujah and so he said no you can't see him now he's still higher what's the Bible word he uses higher you'd have to ascend to see him amen so there are levels of heaven but it's the same to di menion right it's a it's a spiritual Dimension right but there's levels of heaven and then there's regions down in the lost right we saw that on the Sunday night in Jude chapter 1 where the Bible said the angels that kept not their first to sayate are now chained up in hell so there's a location in hell where angels are chained up then you have Satan had the keys of death and Hell there right and then you had Paradise before where the Lost were and where Abraham's bosom was so you have regions there as well that's scriptural all right now here's something as far as I know John Ezekiel and who's the other one Paul they might have changed dimensions and they might have had out of- body experiences we know brother Ram did he said he went out of his body he saw his body laying there yeah right John he said a door was open in heaven Hallelujah it says come up hither and immediately I was in the spirit Hallelujah so this is either an out of body experience or in the body if it was in the body then it was just kind of like a vision or a dream but he his soul stayed right there in his body yeah but if it was out of body then his body stayed there and his Soul and Spirit left up to heaven and that Soul and Spirit actually went up to heaven changed Dimensions amen all right but I don't know for sure but he said he was caught up in the spirit Ezekiel was surely had an out of- Body Experience now in chapter one he goes in the visions of God the spirit took him up in the vision so he only went there by Vision right so he his body's there and he just has a vision of heaven right the spirit lifted him up and took him me away and went in the bitterness in the heart of my spirit but in chapter 8 he sat in his house and then God comes down and picks him up by the locks of his hair that would be his Spirit body that's right and he carries his body where to Jerusalem so he has an out of- body experience and God can do it like that amen I don't take nothing for God to travel he's outside of time amen amen he moved so fast he don't have to have any time and so this seems like Ezekiel had an out of- Body Experience just like brother Brandon and it seems Paul man because he said I can't tell whether it was out of body or in the body amen so it's likely he had an a body experience but we don't know and this is what brother R said he said he was laying on the the bed and he said I felt myself leaving he felt his soul leaving his body I thought oh oh I've already died I I and I got to a place I said I believe I'll look back so he moved his soul moved and he said I want look back at my body and there I was lying on the bed I was stretched out laying by the side of my wife I thought well it was probably a heart attack he said that's I died instantly he said which would be a fine way of going is that a fine way to die for everybody here well see I just died instantly that would have been a fine way to go that's just a heart attack I didn't have to suffer I thought well now that's strange there I lay right there and here I stand here so he was standing on a spiritual plane amen he was standing on a Celestial plane amen looking down at his body all right now I'm going to go through this quickly I'm almost ready to close here uh how how long have I been let me see oh just I'm at 59 minutes okay well now most you know this but let me just go over these briefly remember there's two kinds of bodies there's Celestial terrestrial angels have the celestial bodies Angels the Bible said are ministering Spirits yeah which is the Numa in the Greek so they have to have if they're Spirits they have to have a spiritual body or a Celestial body remember Jesus said we'll be as the Angels over there we'll be as in other words in the mnium we'll have Angelic bodies right Hallelujah where we don't marry anymore there'll be no natural marriage anymore okay now here's where the Angels wrestle right the prince of of the kingdom of Persia wh stood me 21 days but Lo Michael came to help me now with stood means to stand your ground so this Angel was trying to get down to Daniel but this Prince of Persia is standing his ground and withstanding him keeping him out they're probably wrestling because when the when Jacob wrestled he wrestled with an angel Hallelujah and we wrestle not against spiritual principalities against Powers I'm sorry wrestle against not flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in high plac amen so the Prince of Persia is keeping by this Angel for 21 days now it wasn't that long for them because they go much faster okay but he kept and finally Michael come through and said oh you come here Prince of Persia let me wrestle with you a little bit here let me and so then the angel could come down there and say Daniel Heaven loves you amen hallelujah church when your prayers are answered it reminds you Heaven loves you Hallelujah Heaven hears your prayers amen amen and some Angel come in and sit in the way brother Austin that God can answer your prayer amen amen right some Angel stood in the Gap so that the answer could come down and and we could get our prayers answered from Heaven hallelujah praise God cuz we're we're Heaven's beloved Hallelujah am amen and then he says Daniel I got to go I got to go back and keep fighting aren't you glad angels are fighting for you hallelujah amen they're fighting for you they're trying to get through and it's all in God's time and season Hallelujah remember there was a war in heaven Michael fought against his a I'm sorry Michael and his angels fought against against the dragon and his angels then he was cast into the Earth cast like lightning right down here just crossing Dimensions cross in the the terrestial Galaxy right right through that and then Satan lands right there on the earth see so they can rest so they can have wars in the spiritual bodies right and remember Angels now this is a little deeper but angels can actually put on a flesh body yeah right which that's no different than like ours right I me except that that's theophany but ours is a spiritual Soul and Spirit yeah right it's pretty much the same as us angels can just put on a flesh body and when when Abraham visited God three he come down like him and two angels they come down and look like real men and they ate meat and they drank milk Hallelujah Angels amen they just borrow those bodies for a few moments then brother said then God took all the poish calcium and all thees components and then just went threw them right back to the Earth he sucked them up to put the bodies on the angels and then threw it back on the earth H just borrowed it for a few minutes amen God so see we got to keep that in mind as well Hallelujah now you remember this this this may may be a little striking here but dead Spirits or Souls that are not saved are naked they don't have a white robe the Bible says that yeah that might be hard for us to understand but down there in the heart of the earth if they're not saved they're naked spirits and souls they got a spirit ual body but they're naked they don't have on the white robe right cuz the Bible said if our Earthly house that this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown how many groaning for a new body amen how how many really grown oh one day I'll be perfect one day I'll finally be like Jesus Hallelujah no more mistakes no more frustrations or failures or fluster as brother says no more of that but I'll be perfect just like my heavenly father Hallelujah I'm Desiring to be clothed with that if so be that being clothed we shall not be found what naked yeah that's a a Soul and Spirit without a theophany body without a white robe on okay not that we would be unclothed see we're not going to be just a spirit and soul we're going to be clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life amen there's more than one verse on this that remember Revelation Jesus says this he said people today are miserable poor blind and naked not just stripped down like women naked but their souls are naked right they don't have a theophany waiting for them yeah but what do you got the opposite of naked is you got a white rayment hallelujah amen amen you got a white rment and you're clothed in the sight of God hallelujah amen in other words Jesus shared his righteousness with you and you have the righteousness of Christ hallelujah amen a righteousness that is not your own amen amen so that's that theophany that white rment a sinner doesn't have the white rment the theophany and I'll close with this now I am going to do a part three at some point I got all these notes down here I don't know if you can see them down here all these red notes these are all things I want to address and preach and kind of I want to place them inside of uh the framework that I've that I understand right now because it's already been an hour we got a second service and we also have a baptism I want to be mind of that so I just want to close with this here by God's grace remember friends that our prayers enter into if you want to call it the seventh Dimension go ahead call it we call whatever you want call the third heaven call everyone but just remember that your prayers God sees your prayers in heaven today amen amen our prayers go so much higher than what we think Hallelujah I'm glad God reminds us every now and then when he answers one of our prayers like wow that was Supernatural God reminds us that your prayers are effective remember the Bible said the effectual fervent prayer of this righteous uh it it avails much that's the word avails it prevails much continual prayer see praying Wednesday after Wednesday Sunday morning after Sunday morning Sunday night after Sunday night just keep prevailing in prayer Hallelujah and God will answer it amen because it's going Before the Throne of God as you're seated in Heavenly places amen as you have a theop there Hallelujah my goodness which hope we we have as a anchor for the soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the veil so let me just go back up to that picture your hope is right there in heaven right there I'm going to copy that and paste it down here your hope enters right there your hope enters with everybody say within the veil ready within the Veil your hope enters somewhere there you go past the first Heaven you go past all the galaxies your hope goes past the sixth Dimension and your hope goes to the very presence of God amen amen it goes as high as it can go it goes the highest that it can possibly go amen your prayers that's what the Bible says your hope goes all the way up there to God's Throne yeah so if God hasn't answered what does he do he's de veloping patience in your life yeah he's developing comfort in your life trust in your life amen amen hallelujah because we're told the prayer as long as we don't sin as long as we yeah that's as long as we don't ask according to the lust of our flesh then the Bible said God will hear our prayers amen and if we don't ask in our selfishness then the prayers go up there and then God is just waiting for the right time he's having Council meetings amen waitting for the right counsel meeting to send the right blessing at the right time Hallelujah amen but he's also got to send trials too he's also got to allow trials that we can be tested the trials are more precious than gold God knows after we get through this trial we'll have much more faith we'll be stronger we'll be able to withstand more the next time amen and we can manifest the presence and the character of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen so church that's where your hope is at right there around the throne amen hallelujah glory having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by what by your efforts by your by your 10 hours of prayer your five hours what what no by the blood amen the blood remember the blood when you pray Hallelujah because it's not by your works that your prayers will be heard it's by the blood of Christ amen that your prayers will be heard by a new this is a new way a New and Living Way which he has consecrated before us through the veil that is to say his flesh having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience see confess your sins and then God sprinkles his blood on there now you're forgiven you got a clean heart amen and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised amen amen so confession your sin so when you come up here when you when spiritually you know in the spiritual realm before you come here call the blood of Jesus Christ over your life I ask that the mercy of the blood of Jesus Christ forgive all my sins that heaven might receive me now I can pass the first I'm in this first Heaven I can pass the first second I can go to the third heaven and when I'm there God hears my prayers amen hallelujah because the Bible says Paul received a gift from the Philippians he said I didn't take it because I desired a gift but I desired fruit that you may abound that may abound to your account what account is he talking about their Heavenly bank account amen the Heavenly memorials up in heaven Paul received food and money from the Philippians so that the Philippians would have a Heavenly reward amen you know brother Mike chister was here on Wednesday he said brother Jesse he said I just want to give you this he handed to me he gives me his favorite pen it's just a pen but he said I have nothing else to give you I just want to give this to you just for being a blessing he said to think that God would give me a friend like you I said brother to think that God would give me a friend like you amen who would drive on a Wednesday night you of course he's retired now don't feel bad you he's retired he can drive anywhere he wants but he would come I think you know if this is all that he can afford to give how many believe there will be a blessing for that in heaven now I left that pen in my office so that I can use it more often by God's grace I didn't put it I should have put in my pocket but that's just an example of somebody they just want to give they just want to uh be a blessing to you so friends if if somebody wants to be a blessing to you just let them do it you know do it not selfishly take it but just say God bless you for that I mean I even need this but I can bless somebody else with it but receive it so that way that person can have a reward in heaven am amen and then we saw this the angel came down to cornos and looked on him and said your prayers and thine arms are come up for a memorial not under God church not under but before God so there's some place in the presence of God where there's there's vials too remember there's vials of prayers there's somewhere some vials around here where your prayers come up and they're stored in those vials all because of the holy spirit inside of you that wants to see God move in your life wants to see God move who is El was probably praying for his family right to be filled with the Holy Ghost he was probably praying to be filled with the Holy Ghost but the angel said all those prayers all the arms you gave to the poor people all the fasting you did all the prayers when you fasted all that has been stored up in heaven and God has seen it and God will remember it and it's not that God forgets it just lets us know that at the right time God will bless you for those sacrifices you make let's stand our Fe feet and just can
