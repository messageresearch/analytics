[13:13] we certainly uh love
[13:15] the hawkins family praise god shy and
[13:17] caleb and hope and all the saints and
[13:19] missing isaac i'm sorry i'm missing
[13:21] isaac at home he's sick today let's pray
[13:23] for isaac as well and
[13:24] how's your mom doing is he doing well
[13:26] good praise god please send our
[13:28] greetings to her
[13:31] and also genevieve was sick yesterday so
[13:33] that's why she's not here now she woke
[13:34] up all perky today but
[13:36] uh you know she had fever yesterday and
[13:38] you know other things
[13:40] try to leave out the details but let's
[13:42] uh pray and if they're feeling okay then
[13:44] they'll come to the second service
[13:45] tonight so
[13:46] we'll see how that goes but let's pray
[13:47] for the sick
[13:48] uh today by god's grace
[13:50] uh i talked to brother brian he said
[13:52] just remember david in prayer david's in
[13:53] japan uh going through some uh serious
[13:56] training so let's remember brother david
[13:58] here he's preached here i believe twice
[14:00] if i'm mistaken he's preached here twice
[14:02] for us or at least once
[14:04] and uh but let's pray for him as he's
[14:06] felt let the lord
[14:07] to go in the military there and let's
[14:08] pray that god will uh strengthen him and
[14:11] be with him but amen has unspoken
[14:13] requests let's remember that request
[14:15] let's pray for the war in ukraine to end
[14:17] let's pray for peace i heard a good
[14:19] scripture you know this week
[14:20] there was persecution in the days of the
[14:22] early apostles and the bible said that
[14:24] persecution was there but god used it to
[14:26] spread the gospel
[14:28] so i just thought that was a very
[14:29] spiritual look at the war you know we
[14:31] know there's wars rumors of wars
[14:32] pestilences all the way to the time of
[14:34] the end
[14:35] uh but there's a preacher who knows in
[14:37] the message you know some of the saints
[14:39] there and
[14:40] he said perhaps perhaps it's god
[14:43] you know causing this dispersion in
[14:45] order to spread the word so we don't
[14:47] know uh but we know god's in control of
[14:49] all things but let's remember that of
[14:51] course we're called by the apostle paul
[14:54] to pray for peace
[14:55] that the saints can have a life of peace
[14:57] and spread the gospel so let's pray for
[14:59] peace
[15:01] in this situation
[15:03] brother brian mentioned benjamin gandy
[15:04] let's pray for benjamin gandy
[15:06] by god's grace

[40:39] praise the lord
[40:41] thank you musicians
[40:46] amen
[40:48] now it's by his grace so we're here this
[40:49] morning
[40:50] amen not just because of the snow but
[40:55] just because we could be out in the
[40:56] world doing other things but by his
[40:58] grace we're here serving the lord amen
[41:03] send greetings from
[41:05] our home church brother jim
[41:07] and everybody else back home
[41:10] and
[41:13] just been through some times
[41:16] over the past
[41:17] several months
[41:21] i
[41:22] lost my brother in october and lost a
[41:26] a good friend which i counted as a
[41:27] brother just recently a couple weeks ago
[41:31] so it's been some
[41:32] a trying few months you know i'm sure
[41:35] other people here
[41:36] have felt
[41:37] the same same type of thing so i'm not
[41:39] alone
[41:40] and that but
[41:42] but the lord is gracious amen
[41:45] this last week was the first time that i
[41:47] administered in about the six months so
[41:50] i want to say somewhere around there so
[41:52] bear with me this morning
[41:55] so i'd like to try to do a little bible
[41:58] study
[41:58] this morning
[42:01] if you would uh turn with me in
[42:03] revelation
[42:06] uh chapter three
[42:10] and i am nervous this morning
[42:13] so
[42:15] but as usual i'm just trusting that it
[42:19] wouldn't be it won't be long before i
[42:20] feel comfortable because you know it's i
[42:22] i
[42:23] pretty much always feel comfortable uh
[42:25] being here it's a just a good group of
[42:28] people and i just appreciate coming and
[42:30] talk to y'all i don't feel worthy enough
[42:32] to to
[42:34] to speak to you all
[42:36] you're wonderful people you got a good
[42:37] teacher
[42:38] and
[42:40] so we'll just do the best that's within
[42:42] within me as long as the lord leads amen
[42:45] so revelation chapter 3 and verse 14.
[42:49] i'm just going to get settled in here
[42:52] take this
[42:54] look here's there
[42:56] revelation 3 14.
[42:59] it says and unto the uh angel of the
[43:01] church
[43:02] of the laodiceans write
[43:04] these things
[43:06] these things say the amen the faithful
[43:09] and true witness the beginning of the
[43:11] creation of god
[43:13] i know thy works that thou art neither
[43:15] cold nor hot
[43:17] i would thou art cold or hot
[43:19] so then because thou art lukewarm
[43:22] and neither cold nor hot i will spew
[43:24] thee out of my mouth because thou sayest
[43:27] i am rich and increased with goods
[43:30] and have need of nothing and know us not
[43:32] that thou are wretched and miserable and
[43:35] poor and blind and naked
[43:37] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[43:41] in the fire
[43:43] that thou mayest be rich
[43:46] now see i think people have the wrong
[43:48] idea when we read this scripture when
[43:51] they say
[43:52] when he's saying i counsel thee to buy
[43:54] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[43:56] mayest be rich i think people have the
[43:59] wrong idea as far as it's the the
[44:01] natural that they want to be rich they
[44:03] want these worldly goods they want gold
[44:05] silver pearls whatever it might be
[44:07] they want to be increased with goods and
[44:10] that's where the rebuke is coming from
[44:11] you're saying you're rich you're
[44:12] increased with goods
[44:14] but you're worthless to me
[44:16] but we want to have the desire of the
[44:19] real gold amen
[44:21] and keep in mind that uh what what gold
[44:24] represents gold represents deity amen
[44:32] excuse me
[44:34] uh and white raymond that thou mayest be
[44:36] clothed and that the the shame of thy
[44:39] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[44:41] eyes with i salve that thou mayest see
[44:44] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[44:48] be zealous therefore and repent
[44:50] see be grateful when he corrects you
[44:53] because when he when he corrects you
[44:55] that just shows that he loves you
[44:57] you know don't get to the spot where
[44:59] stop correcting me you know i'm i'm
[45:01] getting tired of you correcting me
[45:02] telling me i'm wrong all the time while
[45:04] he's trying to bring something about in
[45:06] you he's trying to make you better amen
[45:10] and it's not because he's he's mad at
[45:12] you or dislikes you it's because he
[45:13] loves you
[45:15] so verse 20 it says behold i stand at
[45:17] the door
[45:18] and knock if any man hear my voice and
[45:21] open the door i will come into him and
[45:23] will sup with him and he with me see
[45:26] there's a communion going on
[45:28] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[45:30] sit with me in my throne
[45:34] even as i also overcame and am set down
[45:37] with my father in his throne he that
[45:39] hath an ear
[45:41] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[45:43] the churches let's bow our heads
[45:46] most gracious heavenly father just thank
[45:48] you for the the privilege to be here to
[45:50] stand behind this pulpit one more time
[45:52] and lord god there's nothing good in me
[45:54] but what you've put there in the grace
[45:56] that you've given oh father and there's
[45:57] nothing more that i depend on than the
[45:59] blood of jesus christ and your
[46:01] righteousness and every good thing that
[46:03] you've made oh god just appreciate your
[46:05] loving kindness and and the the patience
[46:08] that you have with us oh lord and just
[46:10] pray that you would help us uh to
[46:12] minister your word this morning i pray
[46:14] that you would guard my lips guard my
[46:16] heart
[46:17] guard my spirit that i wouldn't say
[46:18] anything wrong or contrary to your word
[46:21] father we just pray that the uh
[46:23] the ears of the the hearer and the mouth
[46:26] of the speaker that
[46:27] each would be blessed and that would be
[46:29] anointed help each one of us not just
[46:31] the speaker but help each one of us to
[46:32] get out of the way to receive what you
[46:34] have to to say to us on uh this morning
[46:38] father
[46:39] i just pray that you would be with the
[46:40] needs those that are sick and afflicted
[46:42] we pray that you would reach out and
[46:43] touch them this morning
[46:45] by the hand of your mercy may they be
[46:47] healed may they rise at will
[46:49] this day
[46:50] father we thank you in all things in
[46:52] jesus christ's name we do pray
[46:54] amen amen you may be seated thank you
[47:04] so over in matthew 6 and 18
[47:07] uh
[47:09] it says that thou appear not unto men to
[47:12] fast
[47:13] but unto thy father which is in secret
[47:16] and thy father which seeth in secret
[47:18] shall reward thee openly see it kind of
[47:21] goes back to what we were saying about
[47:23] the gold that people have the
[47:24] misrepresentation or the uh
[47:26] misunderstanding
[47:28] uh
[47:29] about a reward or the gold that they
[47:31] think it's some uh earthly riches which
[47:34] we know that these uh riches on earth
[47:36] these earthen uh riches they will they
[47:39] will rust they will tarnish they will
[47:41] they will fall away but by uh but he
[47:44] will never he will never uh fall away
[47:47] amen
[47:48] so it's
[47:50] it's our motive it's our objective of
[47:51] what reward we're looking for
[47:54] and uh
[47:56] so uh he shall reward thee openly
[47:59] lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
[48:01] earth
[48:02] where moth and rust doth corrupt and
[48:04] where thieves break through and steal
[48:07] see
[48:08] you hold your treasures in your heart
[48:09] and you hold your treasures the the
[48:11] spiritual treasures
[48:13] no nobody can take that there's no thief
[48:15] that can enter in and take it away from
[48:16] you amen
[48:20] so laid not up for yourselves treasures
[48:21] upon earth where mother and and rust
[48:23] doth corrupt and where thieves break
[48:25] through and steal but lay up for
[48:27] yourselves treasures in heaven where
[48:29] neither uh
[48:33] neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and
[48:35] where thieves do not break through nor
[48:37] steal
[48:38] for where your treasure is there will
[48:40] your heart be also amen
[48:45] and over in job 23 i'm just kind of
[48:48] setting the
[48:49] uh setting the foundation i guess you
[48:52] could say for the message so bear with
[48:53] me just a few scriptures to go through
[48:56] uh
[48:57] job in 23 and 10.
[49:00] it says but he knoweth the way that i
[49:02] take
[49:03] when he hath tried me i shall come forth
[49:06] as gold and again that's not as an
[49:08] earthly uh
[49:10] as an earthly treasure
[49:12] and
[49:13] that i shall come forth as gold there's
[49:15] a process that goes through to that you
[49:18] have to go through in order to make gold
[49:20] so you could pick up a golden nugget
[49:21] it's just a golden nugget but it's
[49:23] really not
[49:24] much until it's refined into something
[49:27] uh there has to be a refining process to
[49:30] to take place
[49:31] and see it's a different kind of a gold
[49:33] a gold that's tried in the fiery furnace
[49:36] that went through the fire of death that
[49:38] went through cavalry and come out
[49:40] a lot of this gold you got now tarnishes
[49:42] it'll canker it'll rust
[49:44] if you can mark this down saint john or
[49:46] james 5 1-4 and you'll get what is said
[49:50] or what it is said go ye rich men
[49:53] now with the coming of the lord weep and
[49:55] howl for your miseries has come upon you
[49:57] your gold is conquered in you see that's
[50:00] the kind of gold that cankers
[50:02] but the gold that jesus gives is the
[50:04] holy spirit for gold signifies deity is
[50:07] that right but the gold that jesus gives
[50:09] is the holy spirit the golden oil of the
[50:12] spirit pours into your heart and oh my
[50:16] says counsel of you come and buy of me
[50:18] of gold if you want to get rich
[50:22] malachi
[50:23] chapter 3
[50:26] verse 1
[50:28] it says behold i will send my messenger
[50:30] and he shall prepare the way before me
[50:33] and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly
[50:36] come to his temple even the messenger of
[50:39] the covenant whom you delight in
[50:42] behold he shall come saith the lord of
[50:44] hosts but who may abide the day of his
[50:48] coming
[50:49] and who shall stand when he appeareth
[50:52] for he is like a refiner's fire and like
[50:55] fuller soap
[50:56] and he shall sit as a refiner and
[50:59] purifier of silver and he shall purify
[51:02] the sons of levi now who were the sons
[51:04] of levi the sons of levi were the were
[51:07] the the priests of the old testament
[51:10] that was the priesthood but remember uh
[51:13] remember that was old testament
[51:15] priesthood but the bible says that we
[51:16] were of a royal priesthood amen
[51:19] made to be kings and priests so this is
[51:22] we're going to be purified he's going to
[51:24] go through the refining process to bring
[51:26] forth a bride worthy amen
[51:29] so
[51:32] to continue on in that verse it says and
[51:34] purge them as gold and silver that they
[51:36] may offer unto the lord an offering in
[51:39] righteousness not in sin but an offering
[51:42] in righteousness you can't do you can't
[51:44] have something you can't have dross you
[51:46] can't have waste in your life but you
[51:47] have to come with righteousness amen
[51:50] so if you remember the priests would
[51:52] offer up if you go back to malachi 1
[51:54] they would offer up second best god
[51:56] doesn't want second best he said give me
[51:58] of the choice lambs not of the second
[52:01] best not the lame and the maine and and
[52:03] the the the handicapped uh uh
[52:06] the the lambs or or something that that
[52:08] has a blemish in it i didn't mean to say
[52:10] a handicap but the uh a lamb that had a
[52:12] blemish in it
[52:14] he didn't receive that that's not what
[52:15] he wanted he wanted the choice lamb he
[52:17] wanted the best lamb out of the flock
[52:20] so
[52:21] we are not to be like those priests and
[52:23] and uh just giving up because they were
[52:25] just wanting something they were wanting
[52:27] popularity they wanted the the choice
[52:28] names for themselves they wanted good
[52:30] meat so their service was in vain
[52:34] because it was not pleasing unto the
[52:36] lord that's not what the lord had wanted
[52:40] they were so cold in their service to
[52:41] god they only went through the motions
[52:43] they you know they they did just enough
[52:45] to get by well i came to church this
[52:47] week i uh i might go next week you know
[52:51] uh i did my service it it's it's not
[52:54] it's not just in in going to church but
[52:57] it's what you get out of church going to
[52:58] church you're getting fellowship you're
[53:00] coming to praise you're coming to
[53:01] worship you're coming to fellowship with
[53:03] the with those of like precious faith
[53:05] amen and it's uh like iron sharpened
[53:07] with iron you're a little weak
[53:09] throughout uh through the week uh
[53:12] you you feel spiritually drained you
[53:14] come and get refreshed it's a it's a
[53:16] revival when you come to church it's a
[53:17] revival when you get into the word of
[53:19] god it's a revival when you praise amen
[53:22] glory amen
[53:24] see if we love him we'll do those things
[53:26] and and our actions will show what's on
[53:28] the inside amen
[53:30] but what i'd like to speak on this
[53:31] morning is a refiner's fire
[53:34] and fuller soap
[53:38] now over in first peter
[53:40] uh chapter one of verse 6.
[53:48] it says we're in
[53:49] ye greatly rejoice though now for a
[53:51] season if need be you're in heaviness
[53:54] through manifold
[53:55] temptations how many people gets weary
[53:58] you know throughout the week you're
[53:59] tempted and you're tempted and and
[54:01] you're just getting so weak because
[54:02] you're getting tired of fighting off
[54:04] temptations see temptation isn't sin but
[54:06] giving into the into the lusts
[54:09] of the temptation giving over to
[54:11] lasheviousness or malice and all these
[54:13] things that's what's that that's what
[54:15] sin is when you give into that
[54:16] temptation but when you overcome that
[54:19] temptation it does it is not sin amen
[54:22] so it's that the trial of your faith
[54:26] being much more precious than of gold
[54:28] that perisheth though it be tried with
[54:31] fire might be found unto praise and
[54:33] honor and glory at the appearing of
[54:35] jesus christ this is something to be
[54:37] cherished for the trials of your faith
[54:39] are not just
[54:40] not just more as it says in there
[54:43] but it says much more precious than that
[54:45] of gold so it's something it's something
[54:48] to be cherished it's something to be uh
[54:50] something to stand before in ah there's
[54:52] something that's great about going
[54:54] through these trials amen
[54:56] see there's there's oh my do you realize
[54:59] the power of the statement that there is
[55:00] much that is much more precious than of
[55:03] gold it's much more than the gold that
[55:05] you got on your finger much more than
[55:06] the gold
[55:07] hanging around your neck it's much more
[55:09] precious than these earthly things amen
[55:14] but do you know what it uh
[55:17] do you know what it used to take to to
[55:19] make gold we we've got the we've got a
[55:21] refining process with all this
[55:23] technology and and they've they've got
[55:26] it uh down to a science now but uh but
[55:28] what it used to be
[55:30] is uh
[55:31] is that uh
[55:32] what is a refiner's fire i guess we'll
[55:34] we'll start that way what is a refiner's
[55:36] fire a refiner uh is also known as a
[55:39] foundry in this day so we have steel
[55:41] foundries aluminum foundries all these
[55:43] different foundries uh that mine
[55:46] precious metal that's how you get your
[55:47] that's how you get all your your cell
[55:49] phones and all these things they they
[55:51] mine the the mineral of whatever it's
[55:53] made of whether it be steel aluminum
[55:55] brass uh it goes through a mining
[55:58] process and in order to get that uh
[56:00] precious metal out of there it has to go
[56:03] through a refining process which means
[56:05] that it has to be heated up and get the
[56:06] dross taken out of it because it
[56:09] when it goes to the foundry when the
[56:11] refiner receives it it is
[56:13] it's not in its pure state as i said you
[56:15] could pick up a golden nugget you can go
[56:18] painting for gold or whatever but it's
[56:20] not
[56:21] it's potentially gold but until it goes
[56:24] through that refining process then it
[56:26] becomes much more precious it becomes
[56:28] much more valuable as it goes through
[56:30] the refining process and the same is
[56:32] with us we we come we were born in sin
[56:34] shaped in iniquity come into the world
[56:36] speaking lies but as we uh we repent we
[56:39] be we're baptized in the name of jesus
[56:41] christ we receive the holy ghost we were
[56:44] much more valuable than what we were
[56:46] amen we become something more precious
[56:48] than what we were because when we were
[56:50] picked up we were just full of we were
[56:52] full of sin we were full of dirt we were
[56:54] full of waste amen
[56:56] but going through the refining process
[56:58] we become something much better amen
[57:01] so going through refiners fire they put
[57:03] in us in a smelting pot way back in uh
[57:06] before what we have today uh they would
[57:08] put it into a refining pot i can't
[57:10] remember what you call the pot but they
[57:12] would put the the the ore or whatever it
[57:14] might be and then they put it right in
[57:16] the middle of the fire right in the
[57:19] hottest part of the flame so it uh
[57:21] through time it it gets hotter and
[57:23] hotter and it melts down
[57:25] but when it when the heat is applied
[57:28] when the heat is applied you'll see in
[57:29] this melting pot
[57:31] that it starts separating the dirt
[57:34] starts separating the dross or the waste
[57:36] starts separating from the pure
[57:38] material so there's a separation that
[57:41] happens the dirt is taken out it's
[57:43] scraped away
[57:48] see when we're tried with fire all of
[57:50] the impurities have to come out when we
[57:52] see anger jealousy etc that's what men
[57:55] what's manifested from within us that's
[57:57] the that's kind of good and that's kind
[57:59] of bad it's it's it's bad that it's
[58:01] there but it's good that you you've come
[58:03] to the record you've recognized that
[58:05] there's something that doesn't belong
[58:06] amen so it's it's kind of good and it's
[58:09] kind of bad so you think you're all good
[58:11] and righteous because you think you
[58:12] haven't sinned at all in the past week
[58:15] but when pressure comes it tells you
[58:17] something different there's something
[58:19] within you when you're when you become
[58:21] under pressure you're going to see
[58:22] things that you don't like hopefully you
[58:24] see the things that shouldn't be there
[58:26] because if you don't see them then you
[58:28] need to get the isaf see we were we were
[58:31] told to counsel
[58:33] we were counseled to buy
[58:34] gold tried in the fire white raiment and
[58:36] if you don't have it then get the isaf
[58:39] the isab is something that's going to
[58:40] help you see to remove the scales from
[58:42] your eyes so you could see amen so you
[58:44] could see the things that are unlike
[58:46] christ that it could be removed out of
[58:48] there amen so when that pressure comes
[58:51] and and
[58:52] you could think of pressure as in heat
[58:54] so when the heat
[58:55] when heat is applied pressure happens
[58:59] so
[59:00] you add a
[59:01] you get a pressure cooker cooker and
[59:05] you start adding the heat and the heat
[59:06] and the heat what happens after a while
[59:09] and not just not just a pressure cooker
[59:10] but if you take a a closed vessel and
[59:13] you put heat and heat to it heat to it
[59:15] it's going to cause pressure what
[59:16] happens if there's no relief to it
[59:19] it explodes
[59:21] and then the whole thing is ruined
[59:23] that's where the temper comes out when
[59:24] you see that temper you know you're
[59:26] getting under pressure
[59:27] you know something doesn't belong there
[59:30] but it's the purging of uncleanliness
[59:33] it's a humbling it's in humbling
[59:35] yourself recognizing that there's a
[59:36] characteristic unlike him than making
[59:39] the proper change you need to be worried
[59:41] if that watchman is sleeping on the
[59:43] inside and you can't accept correction
[59:45] because people wonder well how do i know
[59:47] if i have the holy ghost can you receive
[59:49] correction from the word that's one if
[59:51] you can't receive that correction then
[59:52] you don't have that holy spirit amen
[59:55] amen see this is a time of separation
[59:58] it's a separation from what you want
[1:00:01] and what you have yes and right now it's
[1:00:04] a mix we have
[1:00:05] we are flesh and spirited it's a mix but
[1:00:08] it has to be a separation time the wheat
[1:00:10] from the chaff amen you're mixed in with
[1:00:13] the world it's a separation you got to
[1:00:15] separate from the things of the world
[1:00:17] there has to be that kind of separation
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:22] in jeremiah 6 and 29 it says the bellows
[1:00:25] are burned
[1:00:27] or it's worn out from continual blowing
[1:00:30] the bellows are burned the lead is
[1:00:32] consumed of the fire the founder or the
[1:00:35] refiner
[1:00:37] melteth in vain for the wicked are not
[1:00:39] plucked away
[1:00:40] reprobate silver shall men call them
[1:00:43] because the lord hath rejected them
[1:00:47] now what are bellows you ask i'm glad
[1:00:49] you asked that
[1:00:50] bellows
[1:00:51] it's an apparatus for producing a strong
[1:00:54] current of air as for uh sounding pipe
[1:00:57] uh and you know these great big churches
[1:01:00] that have these big organs and the in
[1:01:01] the pipes in there they they've got
[1:01:03] what's called bellows to put through the
[1:01:06] sound uh what it does is it puts the air
[1:01:08] through
[1:01:10] so
[1:01:11] what i'm referring to is
[1:01:13] a bellow for fire uh it increases the
[1:01:15] draft to a fire consisting of a flexible
[1:01:18] uh valve chamber that is
[1:01:21] contracted and expanded by pumping the
[1:01:23] force air through a nozzle anybody seen
[1:01:26] a bellow
[1:01:29] i brought one with me but well i'm not
[1:01:31] going to take it out i probably should
[1:01:32] have brought it out so you can see
[1:01:36] but a bellow what i have it looks like a
[1:01:39] spade if anybody's played cards it kind
[1:01:41] of looks like a spade it's got a nozzle
[1:01:42] then it's got the body and it's got
[1:01:44] handles and it's got a hole in the side
[1:01:46] of the body where it draws in air and
[1:01:48] then when you push it it pushes air out
[1:01:50] so it's a
[1:01:54] sometimes when people hyperventilate
[1:01:56] it's like a bellow
[1:02:01] so if you does that help you understand
[1:02:02] this a little bit better that's what a
[1:02:04] bellow is is that and what it's doing is
[1:02:06] it's fanning to the coals and it's
[1:02:08] making that fire hotter and hotter and
[1:02:10] hotter and hotter the more you blow uh
[1:02:13] the more you push or get that bellow
[1:02:15] into action the the hotter the fire is
[1:02:17] going to get
[1:02:18] amen so a fire can either consume or it
[1:02:22] can purify
[1:02:24] see god is a consuming fire but he is
[1:02:27] also as a refiner's fire removing
[1:02:30] impurities
[1:02:32] but see through the smelting process
[1:02:34] when it's heated when it's in that
[1:02:36] smelting pot
[1:02:38] the thing about it is when that
[1:02:39] separation takes place a dross is being
[1:02:41] separated from it
[1:02:43] and and you scrape that away but the
[1:02:45] pure mineral stays
[1:02:49] the pure thing stays and and we're
[1:02:51] cautioned about the the wheat and the
[1:02:53] tears
[1:02:54] uh be careful not to pluck up the tears
[1:02:56] uh with uh because if if you take up the
[1:02:58] tears you're gonna take up the weed also
[1:03:00] amen yes so
[1:03:03] god has a consuming fire but that pure
[1:03:06] mineral is going to stay there amen amen
[1:03:09] matthew i know i have a lot of scripture
[1:03:11] but i got to i got to back up what i'm
[1:03:12] saying
[1:03:14] but matthew chapter 3 verse 10
[1:03:18] it says and now also the axe is laid
[1:03:21] unto the root of the trees
[1:03:23] therefore every tree which bringeth not
[1:03:26] forth good fruit is hewn down and cast
[1:03:29] into the fire now what happened when
[1:03:31] jesus walked by that fig tree
[1:03:33] and he wanted he was hungry
[1:03:36] there was no fruit there
[1:03:38] what happened
[1:03:39] he cursed that fig tree
[1:03:41] and it died and it withered
[1:03:43] see and now the axe is laid unto the
[1:03:45] root of the trees therefore every tree
[1:03:46] which bringeth not forth fruit good
[1:03:48] fruit is hewn down and cast into the
[1:03:51] fire
[1:03:52] it's going to be removed if you don't
[1:03:54] have good fruit
[1:03:56] you're going to be removed from service
[1:04:00] verse 11 it says i indeed baptize you
[1:04:02] with water unto repentance but he that
[1:04:05] cometh after me is mightier than i whose
[1:04:08] shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall
[1:04:10] baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:04:13] and with fire amen
[1:04:16] whose fan is in his hand or it's the
[1:04:18] same concept as a bellow whose fan it is
[1:04:22] is in his hand and he will thoroughly
[1:04:25] purge his floor and gather his wheat
[1:04:27] into the garner but he will burn up the
[1:04:29] chaff with unquenchable
[1:04:32] fire
[1:04:35] unquenchable
[1:04:36] fire now not to
[1:04:39] sound like i'm condescending but an
[1:04:40] unquenchable fire is something that you
[1:04:43] can't put out
[1:04:45] right
[1:04:46] oh
[1:04:48] and it's going to eat any it's going to
[1:04:50] burn up anything in its path it's just
[1:04:52] going to take everything
[1:04:55] every anything that's around it's going
[1:04:56] to take it out yes
[1:04:59] now again a bellow is used to to fan
[1:05:01] flames to make the fire hotter
[1:05:02] repeatedly they they heat the material
[1:05:05] but when they when they do that when it
[1:05:06] becomes in a solid form what they do is
[1:05:08] they have an anvil a big solid piece of
[1:05:11] steel uh
[1:05:13] if you know what an anvil is and what
[1:05:15] they did uh never mind i'll leave
[1:05:18] but what they're doing is uh i think
[1:05:20] back then they they had a foot pedal so
[1:05:22] so what happened with the bellows it was
[1:05:24] they would just do it with the foot they
[1:05:26] would take heaven into the coals they
[1:05:27] would take it out and they would hammer
[1:05:29] they would hammer they would hammer and
[1:05:31] knock the slag off slag is also a term
[1:05:34] for for dross it's a waste it's knocking
[1:05:36] anything
[1:05:37] and pure off of it so they're they're
[1:05:40] blowing they're hammering they're
[1:05:42] blowing they're hammering and it's a
[1:05:44] process over and over and over again how
[1:05:47] many feel that they have that and
[1:05:49] you know you you suffer under
[1:05:50] temptations you're buffeted day in and
[1:05:53] day out it's it's it's war and
[1:05:56] you're just going through trial after
[1:05:58] trial after trial and it says lord give
[1:06:00] me a break i need a break that's what
[1:06:02] your threshold is but he will not put on
[1:06:04] you more than what you were able to
[1:06:06] handle amen because if the material gets
[1:06:09] too hot it will vaporize and god knows
[1:06:12] that now see you were chosen as a as a
[1:06:14] vessel before the foundation of the
[1:06:15] world he knew what you were going to be
[1:06:17] able to handle what you couldn't so he
[1:06:19] will push you to your limits to
[1:06:22] get out of you when he knows what your
[1:06:24] potential is
[1:06:27] you just think that you're all dirt that
[1:06:29] you're worth nothing
[1:06:31] that's true to a point but he knows that
[1:06:33] there's something worthwhile inside of
[1:06:35] there if you just pay attention and you
[1:06:37] follow suit and don't resist them amen
[1:06:46] he chose you before the foundation of
[1:06:47] the world
[1:06:48] he knew you'd be able to handle that
[1:06:50] pressure
[1:06:51] he is purifying for himself a peculiar
[1:06:54] people zealous of good works amen
[1:06:58] so you go along you know you're a
[1:07:00] christian but you you you just had a a
[1:07:03] little hiccup you you made a little
[1:07:04] mistake does that mean that you're lost
[1:07:07] no
[1:07:08] the fact that you're wanting to get up
[1:07:10] and continue on shows that you are his
[1:07:12] son because you can say i know i'm wrong
[1:07:14] but lord come and correct me i want to
[1:07:17] be right i want to have a pure heart
[1:07:19] amen
[1:07:20] i want to be pure
[1:07:24] now going back or going to the part in
[1:07:27] jeremiah it says the letters consumed of
[1:07:29] the fire now a different translation
[1:07:32] gives this it says the bellows burn with
[1:07:34] fire yet land is the only outcome
[1:07:38] see the point lies in the fact that the
[1:07:40] lead was used as a flux in
[1:07:42] in smelting silver ore now flux is a a
[1:07:45] mineral added to the metals uh to help
[1:07:48] with the fusion process
[1:07:51] and it uh it prevents the the uh
[1:07:54] formation of oxides
[1:07:56] so it it keeps it from getting dirty
[1:07:59] again and it helps with the with the
[1:08:01] fusion process amen it it it helps uh
[1:08:04] because when you separate uh when you're
[1:08:06] hammering you know all those electrons
[1:08:08] in there they're just scattering and
[1:08:10] getting inside excited but with the
[1:08:13] cooling process all those electrons come
[1:08:15] together again and the more heat that's
[1:08:17] applied the more scattered they are but
[1:08:19] when it gets cold
[1:08:21] the unity just comes together even more
[1:08:23] amen so it's through the tempering
[1:08:25] process hammering hammering hot hot hot
[1:08:28] hammer hammer hammer and it's just over
[1:08:31] and over and over but there's something
[1:08:33] coming out of you amen
[1:08:39] the founder or the refiner in this case
[1:08:42] uh supposedly went on with his work till
[1:08:44] the lead was melted but he found no
[1:08:47] silver at all so the the bellows were
[1:08:50] burned and it was done in vain because
[1:08:52] there was nothing that come out of it so
[1:08:54] the bellows are burned from blowing and
[1:08:56] blowing and blowing and being close to
[1:08:57] that fire it's just all worn out because
[1:09:00] it just
[1:09:01] it just couldn't take that so
[1:09:03] through
[1:09:05] that process
[1:09:07] it's done in vain because there was
[1:09:08] there was nothing
[1:09:10] there was nothing pure inside of there
[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:13] but when there is nothing precious the
[1:09:16] lead just burns up
[1:09:18] uh so the founder or the refiner is
[1:09:20] melting in vain which is a loss to the
[1:09:23] refiner so when he's trying to correct
[1:09:25] you when lord is trying to correct you
[1:09:27] and trying to correct you and trying to
[1:09:29] to lay things out before you and you're
[1:09:31] resisting
[1:09:33] then it's a waste
[1:09:35] now see uh
[1:09:37] i think it was in a uh i can't remember
[1:09:40] which message it was in but brother
[1:09:41] brandon was talking about uh how he saw
[1:09:43] the spirit i think the gentleman was up
[1:09:46] in a balcony and uh
[1:09:48] and brother branham said
[1:09:50] uh
[1:09:51] he was saying what the man was going
[1:09:53] through so he uh discernment that's the
[1:09:55] word i was looking for he discerned what
[1:09:57] the man was going through
[1:09:59] and
[1:10:00] the people around him kept trying to get
[1:10:02] the get the gentleman to go up there and
[1:10:04] he never responded
[1:10:06] so that's kind of the same situation
[1:10:08] here when the lord calls you answer the
[1:10:10] call when he's trying to correct you
[1:10:12] receive the correction because when that
[1:10:14] man walked away
[1:10:16] he probably didn't have another chance
[1:10:18] god is only obligated one time to come
[1:10:20] by your way
[1:10:22] one time if you if you refuse that one
[1:10:24] time
[1:10:25] it may be your last
[1:10:29] but not all gold is good valuable gold
[1:10:33] so not all that say not all that say
[1:10:35] lord lord have we not uh cast out demons
[1:10:38] in your name
[1:10:40] but he will say depart from me ye
[1:10:43] workers of iniquity is that right i
[1:10:44] never knew you
[1:10:48] so not all gold is good gold you have
[1:10:50] that
[1:10:51] that's i can't remember the the
[1:10:52] technical term but it's also known as uh
[1:10:54] fool's gold
[1:10:55] now see it looks like gold see on the uh
[1:10:59] on the outside it it it looks like gold
[1:11:02] but the when you put it to the test
[1:11:04] it'll absolutely show that it is not
[1:11:06] gold amen
[1:11:08] but having the form of godliness but
[1:11:10] denying the power thereof see that's the
[1:11:12] fool's gold it's a deception trying to
[1:11:15] deceive people but the lord knows what's
[1:11:17] on the inside amen the lord knows what's
[1:11:19] on the inside of your heart
[1:11:22] you could deceive man all you want but
[1:11:24] you will not deceive god he knows what's
[1:11:26] on your heart
[1:11:28] now see they use a flux usually lead or
[1:11:30] borax or something similar that is added
[1:11:33] in a certain
[1:11:34] recipe to aid in the melting process
[1:11:37] it causes a reaction to help separate
[1:11:39] the metals from impurities through the
[1:11:41] refining process
[1:11:44] excuse me when it's cooled the materials
[1:11:46] separate from each other
[1:11:49] then when it becomes solid it's beaten
[1:11:52] to get the remaining drops off to make
[1:11:54] it more more pure or more valuable
[1:11:58] it's refined again to get more of the
[1:12:01] impurities out
[1:12:03] see we're buffeted into perfection the
[1:12:05] lord may add some things in our lives
[1:12:07] that cause us to become uncomfortable
[1:12:09] that's so we separate from the things of
[1:12:12] the world
[1:12:13] all
[1:12:14] all of the things might be in the same
[1:12:16] melting pot but they need to become
[1:12:19] separated
[1:12:20] now see we wonder why we go through so
[1:12:22] many trials it's a work in your life to
[1:12:24] get the malice and the lust and the
[1:12:25] backbiting and all the other
[1:12:27] imperfections out it's not done until
[1:12:30] all the impurities are chipped away and
[1:12:32] the pearl of great price is all cleaned
[1:12:34] up amen
[1:12:40] james chapter 1
[1:12:42] excuse me verse 2
[1:12:44] it says my brethren
[1:12:46] count it all joy when you fall into
[1:12:49] divers temptations
[1:12:51] knowing this
[1:12:52] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:12:56] patience
[1:12:57] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:13:02] that you may be perfect an entire
[1:13:05] wanting nothing
[1:13:08] now see in the olden days way before
[1:13:10] that technology that we have now
[1:13:13] the refiner had to keep a watchful eye
[1:13:15] on that smelting pot
[1:13:19] see much like god has to always keep an
[1:13:21] eye on us is that right but he will
[1:13:24] never leave you he will never forsake
[1:13:26] you that the metal has to be heated
[1:13:29] to an almost an exact temperature once
[1:13:32] it reaches that exact temperature
[1:13:36] it's getting close
[1:13:38] to the final product
[1:13:40] if the refiner is careless
[1:13:43] the metal could start to vaporize
[1:13:46] if it overheats it weakens the material
[1:13:50] but that's okay it's not a complete loss
[1:13:54] because you could put it back in with
[1:13:56] the same material
[1:14:01] so when you get into a backslidden
[1:14:03] condition it's not a total loss you're
[1:14:06] not lost you just get into fellowship
[1:14:08] with believers again amen because you
[1:14:10] could repent
[1:14:12] you could become you could be recycled
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:17] oh my
[1:14:20] so when you when you fall it doesn't
[1:14:21] mean that you're completely gone
[1:14:24] repent
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:27] and get a refreshing of the holy spirit
[1:14:29] to be tried
[1:14:30] one more time amen
[1:14:32] today they have ray tech guns it's a
[1:14:34] laser gun
[1:14:36] to monitor the heat
[1:14:38] before they had to watch it uh for it to
[1:14:40] be done
[1:14:41] so how did they know it was done
[1:14:44] you ever hear that
[1:14:46] they have to see the reflection see
[1:14:49] silver and gold when it when it's done
[1:14:51] it gets so shiny that the refiner could
[1:14:53] see its reflection it's not like a
[1:14:55] mirror so don't don't think of it that
[1:14:56] way it's not a crystal but it gets it
[1:14:58] gets shiny enough to where the refiner
[1:15:00] can see his reflection so when we're
[1:15:02] going through the the the diver's
[1:15:04] temptations when we're going through the
[1:15:06] the heat of the battle and all these
[1:15:07] fires and all this correction
[1:15:10] when he when the lord sees the
[1:15:12] reflection he could say that is my son i
[1:15:14] see myself in him amen
[1:15:17] so that's how the refiner knows that the
[1:15:19] practice product is done when he could
[1:15:21] see himself
[1:15:23] in that material
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:27] and see people should see christ in us
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:31] and we walk with christ in us the hope
[1:15:34] of glory
[1:15:35] giving others hope in a lost and dying
[1:15:37] world
[1:15:38] see we're preaching the gospel
[1:15:41] we're preaching the gospel
[1:15:43] even if we're not using words
[1:15:46] oh i i think i've said it here before
[1:15:48] that i saw a thing that preached the
[1:15:50] gospel use words if necessary but people
[1:15:54] will see the actions of a believer
[1:15:56] i don't know if you know
[1:15:58] brother ronnie long
[1:16:00] he was out ministering for us here a
[1:16:02] little while back and when they were at
[1:16:04] the hotel they were in an elevator and
[1:16:06] this little girl uh said i think it was
[1:16:08] to her mama said look mommy there's some
[1:16:11] christians
[1:16:14] that
[1:16:15] not how you want to be people
[1:16:17] would recognize and see that you were a
[1:16:19] christian amen
[1:16:21] but see in the time of time of trouble
[1:16:23] they they might they might ridicule and
[1:16:24] make fun and persecute you but in the
[1:16:27] time of trouble they're going to know
[1:16:29] who to run to and you know what they do
[1:16:31] they're going to be just like nicodemus
[1:16:32] when they come to jesus when he came to
[1:16:34] jesus in the nighttime they're going to
[1:16:35] come to you private because they don't
[1:16:37] want all the other people that that
[1:16:38] heard heard them making fun of you
[1:16:41] coming to you and asking you questions
[1:16:43] amen amen
[1:16:45] i've seen it i've had it happen to me
[1:16:48] so yes it happens
[1:16:50] they're going to know where to go to
[1:16:52] because uh just like that that that uh
[1:16:56] that young man uh was with that woman in
[1:16:59] in in the house i think she was cooking
[1:17:01] i can't remember exactly the the details
[1:17:04] of it but there was a tornado coming by
[1:17:06] and she was at peace and the young man
[1:17:07] was wondering how she could be at peace
[1:17:10] but she was she was a christian
[1:17:13] she knew where she was
[1:17:15] she was at peace so why was she worried
[1:17:18] and this young man was was so told about
[1:17:20] he was
[1:17:21] he was so nervous about this potential
[1:17:23] tornado
[1:17:25] and then he was asking well how are you
[1:17:27] so calm
[1:17:28] because i got peace with my lord and
[1:17:30] savior
[1:17:32] now see we're on this earth preaching
[1:17:34] the gospel trying to reach to those that
[1:17:36] are lost amen
[1:17:38] we're not trying to
[1:17:40] again they have the misunderstanding of
[1:17:42] what a christian
[1:17:44] what's so wrong with being a christian
[1:17:46] in this day
[1:17:49] a christian is a they do good deeds at
[1:17:51] least they're supposed to they do good
[1:17:54] things but why do people hate them so
[1:17:55] much
[1:17:58] is it because they're doing good
[1:18:03] why are they fighting against the bible
[1:18:05] so hard what is so wrong with the bible
[1:18:07] when it tries to get people to do good
[1:18:10] what is wrong with it
[1:18:12] of course i'm biased because i'm a
[1:18:13] christian and i believe the bible to be
[1:18:15] the truth
[1:18:18] but they're scared of it
[1:18:20] why are they scared of it because they
[1:18:22] don't want to get they don't want to get
[1:18:23] right they're not at peace yes
[1:18:28] they love the things that they're doing
[1:18:31] right they love that spirit that's on
[1:18:33] the inside and they continue to pet that
[1:18:35] spirit
[1:18:36] yes
[1:18:37] they love their drinking they love their
[1:18:39] smoking they love their carousing they
[1:18:41] don't want to do anything different
[1:18:43] because if they know once they come into
[1:18:44] this presence they i think they actually
[1:18:47] know deep within that there's a changing
[1:18:50] that will happen
[1:18:51] if they and i think they're afraid to
[1:18:53] change
[1:18:55] they're afraid of that change to happen
[1:18:57] because they're no longer going to smoke
[1:18:59] they're not no longer going to drink
[1:19:00] they're no longer going to gamble
[1:19:01] they're no longer going to do these
[1:19:03] ungodly things right
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:09] the strength of a christian
[1:19:11] we're not out to make fun of them we're
[1:19:13] out to save their souls so when we try
[1:19:14] to correct them look there's a better
[1:19:16] way to come we it's because they love
[1:19:19] you there's a love on the inside of them
[1:19:21] they don't want them lost
[1:19:23] we don't want them lost we want to show
[1:19:26] them the right path to come
[1:19:29] it's not to say that that we're better
[1:19:31] than you it's not that and if anybody
[1:19:33] does that then shame on
[1:19:34] them because we're not better than
[1:19:37] anybody
[1:19:38] the difference between us and a sinner
[1:19:39] is we have an advocate with the father
[1:19:41] we can go to the father and say lord
[1:19:43] forgive me and that's how we receive
[1:19:45] that peace
[1:19:47] we're not better than anybody
[1:19:50] we just have a god that's better than
[1:19:52] everybody amen
[1:19:59] but god rejects outward services as
[1:20:02] worthless to atone for sins
[1:20:04] it doesn't matter how rich
[1:20:06] bill gates is it doesn't matter how rich
[1:20:09] the
[1:20:09] zuckerberg is it doesn't matter how rich
[1:20:11] these people are they're not going to
[1:20:14] buy their way to heaven
[1:20:16] they're not going to buy the blood of
[1:20:19] jesus christ
[1:20:22] but he counsels them to buy of him
[1:20:26] the gold
[1:20:28] so forsake all your worldly treasures
[1:20:31] bill gates and zuckerberg and everybody
[1:20:33] else that's that's rich out in this
[1:20:34] world your riches are worthless in this
[1:20:37] world
[1:20:38] or in the world to come
[1:20:40] it might get you places in this world
[1:20:43] but it's not going to get you
[1:20:45] it's not going to get you to the streets
[1:20:47] of gold
[1:20:48] and we don't long for the streets of
[1:20:50] gold just because it's gold we long for
[1:20:52] the streets of gold because of the who's
[1:20:55] in the presence of the streets of gold
[1:20:57] amen i long to be there with my savior
[1:21:00] amen amen
[1:21:02] but god rejects the outward services as
[1:21:05] worthless to atone for sins sacrifice
[1:21:07] and incense were to to direct them to a
[1:21:09] mediator but when offered to purchase a
[1:21:12] license to go on and sin they provoke
[1:21:15] god with it
[1:21:17] the sins of god's professing people make
[1:21:20] them an easy prey to their enemies
[1:21:24] they dare not show themselves saints may
[1:21:26] rejoice in hope of of god's mercies
[1:21:29] though they see them only in the promise
[1:21:31] sinners must born for fear of god's
[1:21:34] judgments though they see them only in
[1:21:36] the threatenings they are the worst of
[1:21:39] revolters and are all corrupters sinners
[1:21:42] soon become tempters they are compared
[1:21:45] to or supposed to have good metal in it
[1:21:47] but which proves all dross
[1:21:51] nothing will prevail to part between
[1:21:54] them and their sins
[1:21:56] reprobate silver shall they be called
[1:22:01] useless and worthless when warnings and
[1:22:04] corrections and rebukes and all means of
[1:22:06] grace leave men unrenewed
[1:22:09] they will be left as rejected of god to
[1:22:12] everlasting
[1:22:14] misery
[1:22:16] let us pray then that we may be refined
[1:22:19] by the lord as silver is refined
[1:22:25] just remember you're either going in
[1:22:28] you're in the middle or you're coming
[1:22:30] out of a trial but he will not put on
[1:22:32] you more on on you more than what you
[1:22:35] are able forgive me lord and try me one
[1:22:39] more time i'll be yours dear lord if
[1:22:42] you'll be mine if i fall or if i fail
[1:22:46] let me rise and try again forgive me
[1:22:48] lord try me one more time
[1:22:52] one more time yes i might have followed
[1:22:55] this this day or that day but lord one
[1:22:58] more time
[1:23:00] forgive me lord
[1:23:02] that's the heart of a believer
[1:23:07] one
[1:23:08] that has a broken
[1:23:10] and contrite spirit
[1:23:12] one that is not proud in spirit but like
[1:23:15] i said of a broken and a contrite spirit
[1:23:18] one that is able to receive correction
[1:23:21] one that is able to be refined by the
[1:23:24] fire no matter how hot it gets they're
[1:23:27] willing to go through the fire they're
[1:23:29] willing to go through the the trials
[1:23:31] they're willing to come through these
[1:23:32] things they're willing to be refined
[1:23:40] proverbs 17 verse 3
[1:23:46] it says the finding pot is for silver
[1:23:49] and the furnace for gold
[1:23:52] but the lord trieth the hearts
[1:23:55] and in proverbs 25 and 4 it says take
[1:23:58] away the drost from the silver and there
[1:24:00] shall come forth a vessel for the finer
[1:24:04] it is a vessel of honor
[1:24:07] amen
[1:24:08] removing the impurities to recover the
[1:24:11] purest of the mineral and purging of all
[1:24:14] uncleanliness isaiah 1 and 25 it says
[1:24:18] and i will turn my hand upon thee and
[1:24:21] purely pour purge away the draws and
[1:24:24] take away thy all thy ten
[1:24:27] ten is an alloy separated from the
[1:24:30] silver similar to draws but it's not
[1:24:32] complete garbage
[1:24:34] tin is still a useful mineral
[1:24:37] we use tin we use molten tin i work at a
[1:24:40] glass factory so
[1:24:41] when you have all this this
[1:24:43] all this material that gets melted down
[1:24:46] it goes through a refining process where
[1:24:48] the defects are removed
[1:24:51] through a heating process
[1:24:53] so with heat it removes the defects but
[1:24:56] when it gets into what we call a bath it
[1:24:58] it floats on molten tin so to to us to
[1:25:02] in the glass industry
[1:25:05] tin is a valuable uh mineral it's
[1:25:07] something that we use to get through the
[1:25:09] float process
[1:25:12] so
[1:25:13] again
[1:25:14] tin is something that's that's separated
[1:25:16] from the silver and like i said it's
[1:25:18] similar to dross but it's not complete
[1:25:20] garbage
[1:25:21] but still
[1:25:22] we have the potential people out in the
[1:25:24] world we try to separate from them but
[1:25:27] they're not complete garbage
[1:25:29] there's still a potential for a value
[1:25:34] it is not complete garbage and that's
[1:25:37] how a a believer feels is that at least
[1:25:40] they ought to
[1:25:41] that they have uh
[1:25:44] compassion
[1:25:45] for those that are uh
[1:25:48] if you're not a pure believer they have
[1:25:50] compassion on those that want you to be
[1:25:52] valuable they want them to become a
[1:25:54] believer amen amen
[1:25:57] but did you ever see them when they was
[1:25:58] fixing uh to mold a bell some famous
[1:26:01] bell for a church chime or or something
[1:26:04] that had to give a certain ding you see
[1:26:06] you're ringing a chime and i'm talking
[1:26:09] about pure material here
[1:26:11] you see if you're ringing a chime it
[1:26:13] takes a certain range for each bell and
[1:26:16] it takes certain materials to go in
[1:26:18] there
[1:26:20] so much brass and so much steel and so
[1:26:23] much of other oars to go into this bell
[1:26:26] if it's just straight brass it won't
[1:26:28] ring right
[1:26:31] it's got to have all kinds of materials
[1:26:33] thrown into it to make it ring the right
[1:26:35] kind of a tone
[1:26:37] and the man who has put the mold up and
[1:26:40] set the mold he knows exactly what it
[1:26:42] takes to go in to that uh
[1:26:46] in that cupid cupola i'm not sure how
[1:26:48] you say that cupola
[1:26:50] what it takes to go into that that that
[1:26:52] metal to make that bell ring that tone
[1:26:57] see god is our great cupola he is the
[1:27:00] great refiner's furnace that where he
[1:27:03] has to put these things upon us and
[1:27:05] trials and persecutions and things to
[1:27:07] mold it together for the working for his
[1:27:10] perfection to make our testimony ring
[1:27:13] for a certain time and a certain note
[1:27:16] that he once rang out on us in a certain
[1:27:18] day
[1:27:20] we're made different all of us are made
[1:27:22] different amen
[1:27:24] we're all made different we see
[1:27:25] different but we all see one thing and
[1:27:29] that's jesus christ
[1:27:31] let's look at him and the only way you
[1:27:33] can see see him if he looks contrary to
[1:27:36] this word you're not looking at him for
[1:27:39] that's that is him so if you see a creed
[1:27:42] or some certain denomination that that
[1:27:45] you just think i belong to that and
[1:27:47] that's enough
[1:27:48] if it doesn't look at that word
[1:27:51] then look away from it
[1:27:53] look to that word and that's what we're
[1:27:55] looking for christ the manifestation of
[1:27:58] god's word he is the
[1:28:00] vindication of god's word amen
[1:28:06] now that i spoke to you about refiners
[1:28:08] fire
[1:28:10] you have a little understanding of what
[1:28:12] the refiner's fire is
[1:28:16] and its purpose
[1:28:19] i'd like to talk about the fuller soap
[1:28:22] now malachi 3 and verse 22
[1:28:27] it says but who
[1:28:29] may abide
[1:28:30] the day of his coming and who shall
[1:28:32] stand when he appeareth for he is like a
[1:28:34] refiner's fire and fuller soap this is
[1:28:37] what we read earlier
[1:28:39] fuller soap
[1:28:41] what is it
[1:28:43] washing clean with soap or lie
[1:28:46] now the washing process parallels that
[1:28:48] of the refiner process
[1:28:51] soaking alone will not clean the garment
[1:28:53] right
[1:28:55] those that do laundry you know if you if
[1:28:57] you got dirt and grime on on your
[1:28:59] garment just throwing it in a in a pot
[1:29:01] of water to soak it is that is not the
[1:29:04] cleaning process because if you leave
[1:29:05] that garment sit soak in there sit and
[1:29:07] idle for for a period of time what
[1:29:09] happens
[1:29:11] it gets to stink it doesn't
[1:29:14] so we know that just just because you
[1:29:16] receive the word and then you sit there
[1:29:17] and you don't act on it
[1:29:20] it's it you become stinky
[1:29:24] so it's not an idleness
[1:29:29] so soaking alone will not clean the
[1:29:30] garment but there has to be some kind of
[1:29:32] a friction take place there has to be a
[1:29:35] scrubbing take place so back in the old
[1:29:37] days they had uh uh what we have now is
[1:29:40] a washing machine and what you have in
[1:29:41] there is a is a is an agitator of course
[1:29:44] they make it now with without the
[1:29:45] agitator but the agitator would just go
[1:29:48] back and forth back and forth and it
[1:29:50] would agitate and it would just make
[1:29:52] those clothes rub against each other or
[1:29:54] and it would rub that soap that's in
[1:29:56] there and it and and soap doesn't really
[1:29:58] it aids in the cleaning process but if
[1:30:00] you just throw soap on it and you leave
[1:30:02] it there
[1:30:03] it doesn't do anything so it's a
[1:30:05] combination
[1:30:07] you need to go on so it's not just in
[1:30:09] justification it's not just in
[1:30:11] sanctification but it's going on to
[1:30:13] perfection with the holy ghost amen
[1:30:17] so when that agitator's in there of
[1:30:19] course back in the old day like i
[1:30:20] started saying they had a they had a
[1:30:22] washboard and it was the same concept as
[1:30:24] that they would rub it rub it up and
[1:30:26] down they would rub it on the washboard
[1:30:28] they would add the soap into it they
[1:30:29] would put it in the water and they would
[1:30:31] rub it on the washboard and what's that
[1:30:33] doing that's creating friction to get
[1:30:35] the dirt out of there and if you go back
[1:30:37] even further before washboards
[1:30:40] boy when they got the washboards they
[1:30:42] thought they were technologically
[1:30:43] advanced
[1:30:44] but even way back they would use rocks
[1:30:46] they would take it to the river stream
[1:30:48] and and whatever uh like the bed of the
[1:30:50] river they would take it what's in there
[1:30:52] the rocks in there and they were just
[1:30:54] but it's the friction it's the fiery
[1:30:56] trials that we have to go through to get
[1:30:58] us clean amen so it's not just in soap
[1:31:01] it's not just
[1:31:02] it's sitting uh soaking in water but
[1:31:04] there's a friction that takes place
[1:31:06] there's action that has to take place
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:14] see when you add the soap to it it still
[1:31:16] needs to be rinsed we still need to be
[1:31:18] rinsed with the washing of the water of
[1:31:19] the word amen
[1:31:21] whoo
[1:31:22] revelation 3 18.
[1:31:26] uh we read it earlier it says i canceled
[1:31:28] you to buy me gold tried in the fire
[1:31:30] that thou mayest be rich
[1:31:32] and white
[1:31:33] raiment
[1:31:34] white raymond if you have something
[1:31:36] white are you going to go out to an
[1:31:38] italian restaurant you're going to eat
[1:31:40] spaghetti or lasagna or anything like
[1:31:42] that
[1:31:44] no we're not
[1:31:45] most people shy away from that okay i
[1:31:47] got some white on i am not eating sauce
[1:31:51] if they're conscientious about it
[1:31:53] but what is it about a white raymond
[1:31:56] white as you know is going to be hard to
[1:31:58] keep clean because if you get a little
[1:32:00] bit of dirt on it
[1:32:02] you see that there's a blemish in it
[1:32:04] already it's dirty
[1:32:06] so he's saying he he's counseling to buy
[1:32:09] uh the the gold tried in the fire and
[1:32:12] then he's saying a white raiment that
[1:32:14] thou mayest be clothed and that the the
[1:32:16] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:32:19] anoint thine eyes with eyes have that
[1:32:21] thou may see now what is it about white
[1:32:24] what's so what's so important about
[1:32:26] white why is he signifying a white
[1:32:28] raymond why not a black raymond raymond
[1:32:30] is closed by the way uh
[1:32:32] why not blue i'm kind of partial to i'm
[1:32:34] kind of partial to blue myself i like
[1:32:36] black i like gray
[1:32:39] those are my colors but what is so
[1:32:41] significant about a white garment
[1:32:46] purity virginity
[1:32:49] undefiled
[1:32:51] unspotted
[1:32:52] amen
[1:32:54] now
[1:32:55] jesus speaking here in john 15 and 3
[1:32:58] it says
[1:32:59] now ye are clean
[1:33:02] through
[1:33:03] the
[1:33:04] word
[1:33:05] which i have spoken unto you so it's the
[1:33:08] word that does the cleaning in our lives
[1:33:11] amen we you type ourselves as as the
[1:33:13] garment we want to be white we want to
[1:33:15] be unspotted from the things of the
[1:33:16] world but it's through the word that he
[1:33:19] is uh that he has spoken to us that's
[1:33:22] what has cleansed us amen and titus
[1:33:24] chapter 3 and verse 4
[1:33:28] sorry i'm talking fast i think i'm
[1:33:29] running out of time
[1:33:33] titus chapter 3 verse 4 it says but
[1:33:35] after that the kindness and love of god
[1:33:39] our savior toward man appeared
[1:33:42] not by works of righteousness which we
[1:33:44] have done but according to his mercy i
[1:33:47] mean that seems elementary that
[1:33:49] we're past that right by now right that
[1:33:51] we know that it's not of our works
[1:33:52] ephesians 2 8 we already know that right
[1:33:55] but it says not by works of
[1:33:56] righteousness which we have done but
[1:33:58] according to his mercy he saved us by
[1:34:01] the washing of regeneration and renewing
[1:34:05] of the holy ghost amen which he shed on
[1:34:08] us abundantly through jesus christ our
[1:34:10] savior that being justified by his grace
[1:34:13] we should be made heirs according to the
[1:34:15] hope of eternal life amen
[1:34:18] in mark 9 mark chapter 9 verse 1
[1:34:22] it says and he said unto them verily i
[1:34:25] say unto you that there be some of them
[1:34:27] that stand here which shall not taste of
[1:34:30] death till they have seen the kingdom of
[1:34:32] god come with power
[1:34:34] and after six days jesus take taketh
[1:34:37] with him peter and james and john and
[1:34:39] leadeth them up into a high mountain
[1:34:41] apart by themselves and he was
[1:34:43] transfigured before them now here's
[1:34:45] here's the whole thing right here and
[1:34:47] verse 3 it says and his raiment became
[1:34:49] shining exceeding white as snow so as no
[1:34:53] fooler on earth can white them so it's
[1:34:55] not even man's intervention man can't
[1:34:57] even wipe that garment amen but it has
[1:35:00] to be of god amen that's how pure god is
[1:35:03] we can't do anything about that amen
[1:35:06] and verse 4 it says and there appeared
[1:35:07] unto them elias with moses and they were
[1:35:10] talking with jesus now as i said you
[1:35:13] can't get more pure than this it's
[1:35:15] beyond man's capabilities amen
[1:35:17] so as no fooler on earth can white them
[1:35:20] there is no no launderer a fuller is a
[1:35:23] launderer just like a refiner as
[1:35:24] somebody who's who's refining the uh a
[1:35:27] process or a founder
[1:35:30] so
[1:35:31] oh my so we know that it's not of us
[1:35:34] amen
[1:35:37] if i could i'd like to to go through
[1:35:39] this and share something with you just
[1:35:41] to kind of help support some of the
[1:35:43] things that i've been saying
[1:35:51] this is looks can be deceiving it's
[1:35:53] something that
[1:35:54] i it's an article that was i uh it just
[1:35:58] says larry uh
[1:36:00] through the messiah messianic light
[1:36:02] website uh written by larry this is
[1:36:05] something that he put in there
[1:36:07] it says looks can be deceiving
[1:36:11] bear with me if you need to stand up you
[1:36:12] can stand up but
[1:36:14] it'll be a few minutes with this
[1:36:18] one of these coins is dated 1964 minting
[1:36:20] began
[1:36:21] not long after president kennedy was
[1:36:24] assassinated
[1:36:25] this coin is comprised of 90 silver and
[1:36:28] 10 percent copper
[1:36:30] the same alloy used in all silver coins
[1:36:32] in the united states in 1964.
[1:36:36] sometimes they are called junk silver
[1:36:39] because they are relatively plentiful
[1:36:41] and have no new numismatic collector
[1:36:45] value
[1:36:46] based on silver prices at the time i
[1:36:48] write this the melt value of this coin
[1:36:50] is around 8.75
[1:36:55] one of the coins uh
[1:36:57] is dated 1969
[1:36:59] and is the least worn and best looking
[1:37:01] of the three beginning i wish i had them
[1:37:03] here to show you but i don't have any uh
[1:37:06] beginning in 1965 the makeup of u.s
[1:37:08] coins was changed though a special alloy
[1:37:11] was used for the for the kennedy half
[1:37:13] dollar from 1965 to 1970.
[1:37:16] this coin is made of uh 40 silver and 60
[1:37:20] percent copper
[1:37:22] based on silver prices at the time i
[1:37:24] write this the melt value of a 1969
[1:37:27] kennedy half dollar is around three and
[1:37:30] a half dollars
[1:37:32] because it has less silver in it than
[1:37:34] the coin of 1964.
[1:37:37] so the third coin is dated 1971
[1:37:41] the newest of the bunch the last year
[1:37:43] for the special alloy for half dollar
[1:37:45] coins was 1970.
[1:37:47] beginning in 1971 the kennedy half
[1:37:50] dollar like all other circulated u.s
[1:37:53] silver coins was made from about 92
[1:37:55] percent copper and 8 percent nickel
[1:38:00] this silver coin contains no silver at
[1:38:03] all
[1:38:04] and has a melt value of less than 10
[1:38:07] cents
[1:38:11] but the lord said to samuel do not look
[1:38:13] on his appearance or on the height of
[1:38:14] his stature because i have rejected him
[1:38:17] for the lord sees not as man sees
[1:38:20] man looks on the outward appearance but
[1:38:22] the lord looks on the heart
[1:38:24] so you might be able to put on an
[1:38:27] outward show
[1:38:29] but it's what's on the inside
[1:38:31] amen
[1:38:32] in some ways people are like these coins
[1:38:34] we may may appear to be the same or
[1:38:36] perhaps just as these coins exhibit
[1:38:38] different levels of where we may appear
[1:38:41] to be either better or worse than others
[1:38:43] in some aspect and though we may not
[1:38:46] always be able to tell the difference
[1:38:48] god knows what is inside we may show
[1:38:51] some kind of good that conceals the
[1:38:53] imperfections within but god sees
[1:38:56] through the facade
[1:38:58] god knows the heart amen
[1:39:01] so how pure is pure
[1:39:04] it says but who can endure the day of
[1:39:06] his coming and who can stand when he
[1:39:08] appears for he is like a refiner's fire
[1:39:10] and like like fuller soap he will sit as
[1:39:12] a refiner and purifier of silver
[1:39:14] we read that already but sterling silver
[1:39:17] is used in jewelry and fine flatware
[1:39:22] is 92.5 percent by weight pure silver
[1:39:25] and seven and a half percent by weight
[1:39:27] some other material
[1:39:30] usually copper pure silver is a softer
[1:39:33] material and the alloy made with copper
[1:39:35] increases its hardness
[1:39:38] but the alloy material also makes the
[1:39:40] silver more prone to tarnishing
[1:39:43] sterling silver is hard and easily
[1:39:45] tarnished because it is impure
[1:39:50] oh
[1:39:52] this is a good one procter gamble
[1:39:55] trademarked the name ivory for its new
[1:39:57] soap product in 1874.
[1:40:00] according to png's website the founder's
[1:40:02] son harley proctor was distracted in
[1:40:05] church one sunday trying to come up with
[1:40:07] the name with a name for his new soap
[1:40:10] when he heard someone reading psalm 45
[1:40:12] and 8 he knew what to call it
[1:40:14] all thy garments smell of myrrh and
[1:40:16] aloes and cassia
[1:40:19] out of the ivory palaces whereby they
[1:40:21] have made
[1:40:23] have made thee glad
[1:40:26] i don't know
[1:40:27] do you remember the tagline for ivory
[1:40:30] soap
[1:40:31] proctor
[1:40:32] procter gamble they claimed ivory soap
[1:40:35] was 99 and 41 hundredths percent pure
[1:40:41] ivory is so pure that it floats another
[1:40:44] of its taglines
[1:40:46] but being 99.44
[1:40:49] pure means that something amounting to
[1:40:52] 0.56 percent must be
[1:40:55] impure
[1:40:57] so
[1:40:57] through all that it's not even all that
[1:41:00] pure so
[1:41:01] just a little tidbit to share with you
[1:41:03] about coins and a little bit of soap
[1:41:08] anybody use ivory
[1:41:11] you ever hear of ivory
[1:41:17] everybody okay
[1:41:18] okay this morning all right
[1:41:21] uh i've never heard anybody say no yet
[1:41:26] revelation 19 and verse 6.
[1:41:36] praise the lord
[1:41:37] it says and i heard as it were the voice
[1:41:39] of a great multitude and as a voice of
[1:41:42] many waters and as the voice of mighty
[1:41:43] thundering saying alleluia
[1:41:46] for the lord god
[1:41:47] omnipotent
[1:41:49] reigneth
[1:41:50] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:41:52] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:41:54] lamb has come and his wife had made
[1:41:56] herself
[1:41:57] ready
[1:41:59] and to her was granted that she should
[1:42:01] be arrayed and find linen clean and
[1:42:04] white for the fine linen is the
[1:42:06] righteousness
[1:42:07] of saints
[1:42:09] who prepares the bride
[1:42:13] herself she herself makes herself ready
[1:42:16] with the preparation of the gospel
[1:42:18] being prepared means to be ready
[1:42:20] beforehand in advance
[1:42:22] i'm pretty sure that i've said it here
[1:42:24] uh being in the service
[1:42:27] we had what's called a mobility bag you
[1:42:29] had to have things pre-packed in case
[1:42:31] that they called said hey we're sending
[1:42:33] you over yonder
[1:42:35] well you don't have time to pack things

[1:42:41] have to have your soul you have to have
[1:42:42] your spirit you have to have your whole
[1:42:44] being ready for when that when that time
[1:42:46] of the rapture comes because you're not
[1:42:48] going to have time to take care of
[1:42:49] things for when that trump sounds and he
[1:42:51] call it
[1:42:53] that's the time of going away it's not
[1:42:55] going to be hey i'm letting you know i'm
[1:42:57] taking you up yonder it's a happening
[1:42:59] now thing
[1:43:01] so you got to have things ready now
[1:43:03] there's no time for you to wait there's
[1:43:04] no time for you to prepare it's a
[1:43:06] happening now
[1:43:09] when that calling away happens when you
[1:43:11] hear that voice
[1:43:12] if you hear that voice
[1:43:14] you're going
[1:43:16] amen and i want to make sure that i'm
[1:43:18] ready
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:24] the bride has to purify herself and be
[1:43:26] disconnected we're separated from all
[1:43:29] draws amen or all sin amen
[1:43:32] well what does a bride-to-be do to get
[1:43:34] ready
[1:43:40] all the brides here
[1:43:42] one of the most important things to a
[1:43:44] bride is the garment right
[1:43:46] the groom is probably important too
[1:43:52] but on the wedding day they're concerned
[1:43:54] so concerned about the garment that
[1:43:56] everything is ready that everything
[1:43:57] looks okay their hair is in place
[1:44:01] there's the the gown looks
[1:44:04] the way that it should be there's
[1:44:06] nothing there's no dirt there's no no no
[1:44:08] rips or tears or anything they're they
[1:44:10] they're so concerned about the wedding
[1:44:12] gown the wedding garment it's so
[1:44:14] important to a bride amen
[1:44:16] and what we what we've read we know the
[1:44:18] the the garment is the the righteousness
[1:44:21] of saints so we must be righteous amen
[1:44:23] that's in preparations it's not our
[1:44:25] righteousness but it's taking on his
[1:44:27] righteousness he became sin for us that
[1:44:30] we would take on his righteousness amen
[1:44:35] some like to get away from in this day
[1:44:37] some like to get away from that old
[1:44:38] white gown because it's so traditional
[1:44:40] it's so cliche it's so this it's so that
[1:44:44] they want to be so individualistic
[1:44:47] or so individual individualist in this
[1:44:50] day they they just want to do something
[1:44:52] away from the norm
[1:44:56] because everybody else was doing it it's
[1:44:58] so old amen but i want to
[1:45:00] continue on with this amen i want to
[1:45:03] continue on clothing myself with his
[1:45:04] word
[1:45:07] again what does white signify it
[1:45:09] signifies purity
[1:45:12] white is an inherently positive color is
[1:45:15] associated with purity virginity
[1:45:17] innocence light goodness heaven safety
[1:45:21] brilliance illumination
[1:45:23] understanding cleanliness faith
[1:45:26] beginnings sterility
[1:45:28] spirituality possibility humility
[1:45:31] sincerity a lot of ideas
[1:45:34] protection softness
[1:45:37] and perfection oh that was a good one
[1:45:39] softness
[1:45:42] oh my
[1:45:44] hallelujah
[1:45:46] but we're arrayed in fine white linen
[1:45:48] because our scarlet sins have been
[1:45:49] washed white as snow amen and it's not
[1:45:52] something that man can do but it's
[1:45:53] something that the lord has done saints
[1:45:55] are righteous because he is righteous so
[1:45:58] if you think that doing your laundry is
[1:45:59] absolutely worse job to do ever our god
[1:46:02] is the greatest laundromat ever amen
[1:46:05] i'll have him do my laundry anytime
[1:46:08] he's a founder man and he's a laundromat
[1:46:11] amen
[1:46:15] i'll try not to be too much longer
[1:46:18] so if you're wondering what religion is
[1:46:19] well i don't want to be religious why
[1:46:21] don't either
[1:46:23] how can you say that because in
[1:46:25] religious in the religious realms they
[1:46:27] do things that are so ceremonious and
[1:46:30] and it's over and over and a lot of
[1:46:32] times it's not even pleasing a lot of
[1:46:34] times it's not even right
[1:46:36] right it's not in the traditions of men
[1:46:41] but pure religion and undefiled before
[1:46:44] god and the father is this to visit the
[1:46:46] fatherless and the widows in their
[1:46:48] affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[1:46:52] unspotted
[1:46:53] unspotted from the world amen we're
[1:46:57] preparing for his promise character is
[1:46:59] the victory needed to handle the promise
[1:47:01] amen character is essential for power
[1:47:04] not that we desire power to rule the
[1:47:05] world like a politician or a villain or
[1:47:07] a dictator
[1:47:08] but power without character is satanic
[1:47:11] we gain character through the testing
[1:47:13] and the trials of fire and being
[1:47:14] cleansed by the washing of the water of
[1:47:16] the word character is what defines us
[1:47:20] it's not in your mistakes
[1:47:22] it's not in your faults and your
[1:47:23] failures that's not what defines you but
[1:47:26] your character of how you handle those
[1:47:28] things that's what defines you how you
[1:47:30] handle people how you interact with
[1:47:32] people how you handle god's word how you
[1:47:35] receive god's word that's what defines
[1:47:38] you
[1:47:40] it's not in selfishness of caring the
[1:47:42] word why i got a law to myself it's not
[1:47:44] us for no more but it's whosoever will
[1:47:47] going out reaching to the lost it's a
[1:47:50] dying world we're preaching this word as
[1:47:52] dying man today man amen
[1:47:58] amen
[1:48:00] it's a responsibility
[1:48:02] to be a minister wouldn't you say
[1:48:04] brother jesse
[1:48:06] it's a high responsibility
[1:48:08] because you have people looking to you
[1:48:11] and hanging on to every word what you
[1:48:13] say
[1:48:15] the conduct that you carry would you
[1:48:17] have confidence in brother jesse if he
[1:48:19] was out carousing with women hanging out
[1:48:21] in the bars not every friday night every
[1:48:23] saturday night hanging out in the
[1:48:25] gambling parlors would you have
[1:48:26] confidence in that man
[1:48:29] no you wouldn't
[1:48:30] why because it doesn't measure up to
[1:48:33] what the word says
[1:48:36] you wouldn't have a confidence in this
[1:48:38] man
[1:48:39] being your pastor if he was out cheating
[1:48:42] people causing wrong or making raw deals
[1:48:45] or shady deals
[1:48:47] with people
[1:48:48] because it's deceptive
[1:48:50] you can't put your trust in somebody
[1:48:52] like that but it's a character i believe
[1:48:54] you have confidence in him because of
[1:48:56] his character
[1:48:57] people of a congregation have confidence
[1:48:59] in the pastor because of their character
[1:49:01] now if they've got the right character
[1:49:03] follow that man as he follows christ
[1:49:06] amen now i'm going to put the
[1:49:07] responsibility on you because we are all
[1:49:10] ministers of christ is that right we all
[1:49:13] minister the gospel
[1:49:15] you might not be up here behind a pulpit
[1:49:18] screaming and spitting and shouting and
[1:49:20] and and whatever else but you're out and
[1:49:22] about amongst the people
[1:49:25] those your neighbor
[1:49:26] your coworker your family
[1:49:29] even though they might call you and say
[1:49:30] that you're in a cult
[1:49:34] you could still minister to them
[1:49:36] all in their response
[1:49:38] because you're being refined by the word
[1:49:41] of god you're learning how to handle the
[1:49:43] word of god
[1:49:44] you're learning how to rightly divide
[1:49:46] the word of god you're learning how to
[1:49:49] handle truth
[1:49:50] you're learning
[1:49:53] how to deliver the you're not delivering
[1:49:55] the promise but you're presenting the
[1:49:57] promise to people
[1:49:59] you are a lively hope
[1:50:01] you give people hope whether you think
[1:50:03] that you're not worthy of it or not
[1:50:05] people see your life and you give them
[1:50:07] hope
[1:50:08] you are a light to the world it's not
[1:50:10] our light but we carry his light within
[1:50:12] us so therefore you are a light to the
[1:50:14] world
[1:50:16] you carry the gospel
[1:50:18] all the burden is not put on the
[1:50:19] preacher not on the on the pastor not on
[1:50:21] the on the prophet nor the the fivefold
[1:50:24] ministry all the burden isn't put on
[1:50:26] them yes
[1:50:28] you carry some of that burden
[1:50:30] you come and you hear the word of god
[1:50:32] you go and repeat the word of god
[1:50:38] this is where we we become shaped
[1:50:41] this is where questions are answered how
[1:50:43] many times have you found it that you've
[1:50:46] had a question in the word and then it
[1:50:48] might be a week you might have read
[1:50:50] something lord i don't understand it but
[1:50:51] if you give it over to god in prayer i'm
[1:50:54] telling you because it happened to me i
[1:50:55] know it's happened to brother jesse if
[1:50:57] there's something that we don't
[1:50:58] understand we give it over to prayer to
[1:51:00] god
[1:51:01] and given by time by and by
[1:51:05] it will come forth
[1:51:07] the answer will come you just have to
[1:51:09] hold on
[1:51:11] don't give up just because you haven't
[1:51:13] gotten the answer in a week
[1:51:15] or a couple weeks or a month or a year
[1:51:19] but how many times have you sat in a
[1:51:21] service not saying anything to anybody
[1:51:24] i was just reading on that scripture
[1:51:27] man i've been wondering about that
[1:51:30] and there's a there's a minister and
[1:51:32] it's not another man don't don't think
[1:51:34] that i'm saying it's a man because we
[1:51:36] already said that it's it's beyond man's
[1:51:38] capabilities but it's being led of the
[1:51:40] holy spirit coming and speaking to you
[1:51:43] the things that you have need of
[1:51:50] i've prayed
[1:51:52] you know we have the lexicon
[1:51:54] it's easy to go back and try to to to
[1:51:57] get get the understanding we have all
[1:51:58] these commentaries out there to try to
[1:52:01] understand the word of god or to to
[1:52:04] understand a certain passage we've got
[1:52:06] google we've got we've got oodles of
[1:52:08] internet out there
[1:52:11] but until god
[1:52:13] makes it real
[1:52:14] to you
[1:52:16] it has to be a revelation to you
[1:52:22] it's worth
[1:52:23] the wait
[1:52:24] i've i've had it that i didn't
[1:52:26] understand something and i prayed about
[1:52:28] it and i prayed about it and i prayed
[1:52:30] about it lord i don't understand it
[1:52:33] i don't understand it
[1:52:35] but one day
[1:52:37] there's that one day
[1:52:40] don't lose hope because one day
[1:52:43] you'll get your one day
[1:52:45] it was made real to me i didn't have to
[1:52:47] go ask somebody i didn't have to go to
[1:52:49] the lexicon actually i was trying not to
[1:52:53] because i was putting god to the test i
[1:52:55] know that sounds uh
[1:52:59] what's the word i want to say
[1:53:01] it almost sounds blasphemous
[1:53:04] but i was putting the lord to the to the
[1:53:06] test to make sure that he was going to
[1:53:07] be there for me
[1:53:09] so and i did
[1:53:10] and he delivered
[1:53:14] just because you don't see something
[1:53:16] right away just because you don't see a
[1:53:18] miracle happen right away it doesn't
[1:53:20] mean that god is isn't working
[1:53:22] amen
[1:53:25] now i got way off
[1:53:27] i got to come back
[1:53:30] but i was talking about character
[1:53:36] character is what defines us and tells
[1:53:38] us what our placing is because if you if
[1:53:41] you look at your character
[1:53:43] and you can't line up
[1:53:45] with what's black and white in this in
[1:53:47] this bible
[1:53:48] you know if you're you're of the other
[1:53:50] seed amen yes sir
[1:53:57] but you can't take all of your worldly
[1:53:59] goods is that right
[1:54:00] but what you're going to take with you
[1:54:02] is your character
[1:54:04] you could save up all the all the money
[1:54:06] you want to you could deceive all the
[1:54:07] people that you want to get more money
[1:54:09] and and and get more of this worldly
[1:54:11] good
[1:54:12] but you're not taking it with us
[1:54:14] bill gates isn't taking all that with
[1:54:16] them
[1:54:18] sorry i don't know of any people that
[1:54:19] are richer than these people so they're
[1:54:22] some of the richest people in the world
[1:54:24] but they're not going to take it with
[1:54:25] them
[1:54:26] guess where it's going it's going to the
[1:54:28] next generation
[1:54:30] because he can't take it with him
[1:54:33] and then the next generation they can't
[1:54:34] take it neither
[1:54:36] yep you can live high on the org here
[1:54:38] while you're on in this world
[1:54:40] and you're forsaking god the whole time
[1:54:43] but until you give over to him
[1:54:46] then things start happening
[1:54:48] in your life i'm gonna i'm gonna start
[1:54:51] closing
[1:54:54] ezekiel 22 and verse 17.
[1:54:58] it says and the word of the lord came
[1:54:59] unto me saying
[1:55:01] son of man the house of israel is to me
[1:55:03] become dross
[1:55:05] all they are brass
[1:55:07] and tin and iron and lead in the midst
[1:55:10] of the furnace
[1:55:12] they are even the dross
[1:55:14] of silver
[1:55:17] the lord is looking for something pure
[1:55:21] of a broken and a contrite spirit amen
[1:55:24] therefore
[1:55:25] thus saith the lord god because you are
[1:55:27] become dross behold therefore i will
[1:55:30] gather you into the midst of jerusalem
[1:55:37] as they gather silver and brass
[1:55:40] and iron and lead and tend into the
[1:55:42] midst of the of the furnace to blow the
[1:55:45] fire upon it to melt it
[1:55:48] so will i gather you in mine anger and
[1:55:50] in my fury
[1:55:52] and i will leave you there and melt
[1:55:54] you
[1:55:57] yay i will gather you
[1:56:01] and blow upon you
[1:56:02] in the fire of my wrath
[1:56:04] and ye shall be melted in the midst
[1:56:06] thereof
[1:56:07] as silver is melted in the midst of the
[1:56:10] furnace
[1:56:11] so shall ye
[1:56:12] be melted in the midst thereof
[1:56:14] and ye shall know that i the lord have
[1:56:17] poured out my fury
[1:56:19] upon you
[1:56:22] but the lord saw
[1:56:24] how unclean israel become
[1:56:26] so he said he would put them in the fire
[1:56:28] to melt and separate the uncleanness
[1:56:30] he was very displeased with them
[1:56:33] why
[1:56:34] because they wouldn't be
[1:56:36] obedient
[1:56:38] the lord loves
[1:56:40] obedience
[1:56:42] well you might say well that was back
[1:56:44] that was back in ezekiel that was back
[1:56:46] in in the old testament
[1:56:49] well there's going to be a separation
[1:56:51] time
[1:56:54] and it's going to be in the everlasting
[1:56:56] fire
[1:56:57] that shall now be quenched
[1:57:00] it will be an unquenchable
[1:57:02] fire
[1:57:03] choose your destination carefully
[1:57:06] amen
[1:57:09] go ahead stand your feet i've got more
[1:57:11] but
[1:57:12] for time's sake
[1:57:19] but i think you get the point
[1:57:21] i think you get the point
[1:57:25] just like to share this with you as we
[1:57:27] close something to something to uh
[1:57:31] to dwell on
[1:57:34] here a little while back
[1:57:37] i was getting uh my safety glasses
[1:57:41] and uh
[1:57:41] i'd come across two sisters this is the
[1:57:44] first time i'd come across their path
[1:57:46] and uh
[1:57:47] they were dressed modestly
[1:57:50] so
[1:57:52] i was inquisitive as to why they were
[1:57:54] dressed so modestly so uh to my complete
[1:57:57] surprise they they told me that they
[1:57:59] were uh
[1:58:00] they were catholic they went to a
[1:58:02] catholic church
[1:58:03] so
[1:58:05] uh
[1:58:06] well
[1:58:07] come to find out you know brother bran
[1:58:10] have talked about there are so many
[1:58:11] denominations in this world we know that
[1:58:13] there are so many denominations that
[1:58:14] we've got denominations inside of
[1:58:16] denominations and inside of those
[1:58:18] denominations you've got more
[1:58:19] denomination so we see that it's a it's
[1:58:22] a never-ending process
[1:58:24] they're always going to have their own
[1:58:26] idea they're going to go off by
[1:58:27] themselves and stay instead of staying
[1:58:29] with the true word of god
[1:58:31] but seeing that they were they were
[1:58:33] dressed in as as holiness i felt
[1:58:35] compelled to to say something uh to them
[1:58:38] as as far as uh
[1:58:41] being witnesses uh
[1:58:43] uh to those that are out in the world
[1:58:45] you know so
[1:58:47] what you are what you do is a testimony
[1:58:51] what you are is a witness as you're
[1:58:53] you're walking
[1:58:55] amongst those out in the world but i
[1:58:57] told the daughter to
[1:58:58] keep doing what she's doing regardless
[1:59:00] of the criticism
[1:59:02] how many have received criticism just
[1:59:04] because you wear skirts and dresses
[1:59:06] and what's so wrong with wearing a skirt
[1:59:09] and a dress why it's so old-fashioned
[1:59:11] and well you wear short shorts and you
[1:59:14] wear pants or whatever it might you wear
[1:59:15] what you want to be you want to be your
[1:59:17] individual self because that's what this
[1:59:19] world is and uh
[1:59:21] they just want to do their own thing
[1:59:24] again what's so wrong with wearing a
[1:59:26] skirt
[1:59:28] because i think it's something that
[1:59:30] strikes in their heart
[1:59:32] that they can't
[1:59:34] submit to yes sir
[1:59:36] so
[1:59:37] i i i thought later that i wish i had
[1:59:40] told her
[1:59:40] that she was more of a warrior than what
[1:59:43] she realizes sisters you're more of a
[1:59:45] warrior than what you realize since i
[1:59:48] can't tell them i'm going to tell you
[1:59:50] yes
[1:59:50] you are more of a warrior than what you
[1:59:53] realize
[1:59:54] that's right
[1:59:55] you know we have men
[1:59:57] of decades and centuries long
[2:00:01] going out to war they were warriors
[2:00:04] yes
[2:00:05] yes we have women this in this day that
[2:00:07] they're letting to go to combat and i
[2:00:09] completely disagree with that
[2:00:12] i completely disagree with it because
[2:00:14] it's a well one that's not where a woman
[2:00:16] belongs
[2:00:18] two it's a distraction
[2:00:20] to me i think it's a distraction in my
[2:00:23] opinion this is my opinion i think it's
[2:00:24] a it's a distraction to the rest of the
[2:00:26] marines soldiers airmen and sailors
[2:00:30] and it causes more breakups in a home
[2:00:34] because when you're around something so
[2:00:35] much you tend to fall with it
[2:00:38] you tend to take part with it in a way
[2:00:41] that you shouldn't
[2:00:43] yes sir
[2:00:45] so
[2:00:46] that i know i'm kind of getting off on
[2:00:48] that i i try to bring it back here
[2:00:50] but you are more of a warrior than what
[2:00:53] you think a stay-at-home mom a lot of
[2:00:56] people have the misconception of what a
[2:00:57] stay-at-home mom is well they stay at
[2:01:00] home and they do nothing all day well if
[2:01:02] they homeschool
[2:01:04] their pro my wife probably works harder
[2:01:06] than i do
[2:01:08] not so much of physical labor but in
[2:01:10] taking care of the children taking care
[2:01:12] of the house
[2:01:13] doing the school taking care of
[2:01:15] appointments doing all this other stuff
[2:01:18] and yet staying true to god
[2:01:21] matter what the pressures that come
[2:01:24] yeah men have their pressures women have
[2:01:26] different pressures
[2:01:29] they're under a different pressure than
[2:01:30] what we are
[2:01:32] and it seems like we hold them to a
[2:01:34] different standard to what men are held
[2:01:36] to
[2:01:38] yeah it's easy it's easy for a man to
[2:01:40] just go out and throw on a pair of jeans
[2:01:42] and a t-shirt or whatever
[2:01:45] and just
[2:01:46] blend in
[2:01:48] it's much easier for a man to blend in
[2:01:51] but there's something different about
[2:01:52] the bride
[2:01:55] there's something different about a
[2:01:57] woman
[2:01:58] a righteous woman a proverbs 31 woman
[2:02:02] amen
[2:02:03] there's something different
[2:02:05] about it
[2:02:06] there are churches
[2:02:08] there are churches there are churches
[2:02:11] and there are bride
[2:02:13] there's a bride
[2:02:14] and that bride is going to be different
[2:02:16] from all the other ones
[2:02:19] from all those churches
[2:02:22] is it going to go unnoticed
[2:02:25] no
[2:02:26] they're going to notice that there's
[2:02:28] something different just like you
[2:02:29] sisters walking around walking amongst
[2:02:31] these people out in the world
[2:02:33] they're going to notice something is
[2:02:35] different
[2:02:36] right off the bat
[2:02:38] they're going to notice something
[2:02:40] is different
[2:02:45] continue to take the stand that you do
[2:02:46] even when people that claim to be a
[2:02:48] christian
[2:02:50] downplay the importance of modesty
[2:02:53] they defend the very act of exposing
[2:02:55] certain parts of a woman's body
[2:02:58] they're truly deceived
[2:03:00] and thinking that it has no effect on
[2:03:02] men
[2:03:04] and they use homosexuals
[2:03:06] to cover that
[2:03:09] case in point i saw something on
[2:03:10] facebook where uh
[2:03:12] somebody had on there this this was
[2:03:14] years ago
[2:03:15] and uh it's it
[2:03:17] it bothered me so bad
[2:03:20] but the the they they were trying to
[2:03:22] come across saying that if uh if uh if a
[2:03:26] woman that likes women
[2:03:29] can control themselves
[2:03:31] around an immodestly dressed woman
[2:03:34] then it's not the clothes that the
[2:03:36] person is wearing
[2:03:38] but it's the person it's the man's fault
[2:03:41] the man should be able to control
[2:03:43] himself
[2:03:45] well i'm going to say it like this and i
[2:03:47] know
[2:03:48] that
[2:03:49] that the brother is recording this and i
[2:03:50] know this is streaming over the internet
[2:03:52] and i know that somebody's going to hear
[2:03:54] it
[2:03:55] outside of this room
[2:03:57] but i'm going to say
[2:03:58] that is so far from the truth because
[2:04:01] it's a perversion
[2:04:03] a woman can't feel i don't care what
[2:04:05] transition she goes under
[2:04:08] a woman cannot feel the same feelings of
[2:04:11] a man
[2:04:12] and a man cannot feel the same feelings
[2:04:15] that a woman feels
[2:04:17] biologically you are a man or you are a
[2:04:20] woman
[2:04:22] so to say that if a woman that likes
[2:04:24] women
[2:04:25] can control themselves something on the
[2:04:28] inside see when when a man looks upon a
[2:04:30] woman immodestly dressed something
[2:04:32] happens to that man there's a there's a
[2:04:35] process that's why men have to look away
[2:04:38] because something is taking place in the
[2:04:40] mind and in the body that
[2:04:43] a righteous man has to fight that desire
[2:04:46] off
[2:04:47] that's why it's important to dress in
[2:04:49] modesty
[2:04:50] to keep from your brothers falling
[2:04:53] to keep your brothers from entering in a
[2:04:55] place that they shouldn't be to keep
[2:04:57] their mind pure that's why we have
[2:04:59] that's why brother brandon had a cross
[2:05:01] on his rear view mirror that's why a
[2:05:02] righteous man in his heart is going to
[2:05:05] turn his eyes away from that immodesty
[2:05:08] because something has taken place in his
[2:05:10] mind and a righteous man doesn't want to
[2:05:12] contend with that battle
[2:05:13] that's a battle that that man does not
[2:05:15] want to take
[2:05:17] yes sir so you see the importance
[2:05:20] the importance
[2:05:23] of modesty
[2:05:25] when a woman is trying is dressed in a
[2:05:27] way that's revealing herself
[2:05:32] potentially it's going to
[2:05:35] cause that man to enter into sin
[2:05:39] that's the importance of modesty
[2:05:42] not only that it causes adultery
[2:05:46] amen
[2:05:48] i know it's not the most popular thing
[2:05:50] but that's something that i got to speak
[2:05:52] out against
[2:05:54] i feel compelled to say something of the
[2:05:57] importance of how you dress
[2:06:01] amen
[2:06:10] the importance
[2:06:12] of a woman of a righteous woman dressing
[2:06:17] appropriately musicians count
[2:06:27] i'm just going to read a portion of this
[2:06:28] scripture
[2:06:30] it's in john 17.
[2:06:35] let me find the spider
[2:06:41] i'll start at verse 9. says i pray for
[2:06:44] them i pray not for the world
[2:06:46] but for them which thou has given me for
[2:06:49] they are thine
[2:06:51] and all mine are thine
[2:06:53] and thine are mine
[2:06:55] and i am glorified in them and now i am
[2:06:58] no more in the world but these are in
[2:07:00] the world and i come to thee
[2:07:03] holy father
[2:07:05] keep through thine own name those whom
[2:07:07] thou has given me that they may be one
[2:07:10] as we are while i was with them in the
[2:07:13] world i kept them in my name those that
[2:07:15] thou gavest me i have kept and none of
[2:07:18] them is lost but the son of perdition
[2:07:21] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[2:07:23] and now come i to thee and these things
[2:07:26] i speak in the world
[2:07:28] that they might have
[2:07:30] my joy fulfilled in themselves
[2:07:33] i have given them thy word
[2:07:36] and the world hath hated them
[2:07:38] because they are not of the world even
[2:07:41] as i am not of the world
[2:07:43] i pray not that thou shouldst take them
[2:07:46] out of the world but that thou shouldst
[2:07:48] keep
[2:07:49] them
[2:07:50] from
[2:07:51] the evil
[2:07:53] they are not of the world even as i
[2:07:58] am not of the world
[2:08:02] sanctify them through thy truth
[2:08:05] thy word
[2:08:07] as truth
[2:08:09] thy word
[2:08:10] is truth let's bow our heads
[2:08:14] oh holy father
[2:08:16] lord we've been a long time here
[2:08:18] speaking and i thank you and appreciate
[2:08:20] for the attention that the people have
[2:08:23] given this morning
[2:08:25] that they were attentive to the words
[2:08:27] that were
[2:08:28] coming off my lips
[2:08:30] the lord
[2:08:32] i pray
[2:08:33] that it wouldn't just be words
[2:08:35] that had fallen on their ears this
[2:08:37] morning
[2:08:38] but i pray that it would be a treasure
[2:08:41] that has entered into their into their
[2:08:43] ears but also their hearts that they
[2:08:46] could lay up treasures in heaven that
[2:08:48] could they could take this treasure of
[2:08:50] your word and hide it in their heart and
[2:08:52] hold it there to keep them
[2:08:55] from taking steps of evil to keep them
[2:08:58] from take partaking of the things of the
[2:09:00] world that it would
[2:09:03] be in their mind that it would be in
[2:09:04] their heart
[2:09:05] that this is a separation time that we
[2:09:07] have to separate from the things of the
[2:09:09] world lord be it far from the believer
[2:09:12] that they would partake of
[2:09:14] that they would have anything of this
[2:09:16] worldly goods stand in the way
[2:09:19] of the the heavenly goods
[2:09:22] lord be far from us
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:27] that we would take on the things of the
[2:09:28] world be it far from us
[2:09:32] [Music]

[2:09:50] fuller soap that you would scour us on
[2:09:53] the inside that you would cleanse us
[2:09:56] from all unrighteousness that we would
[2:09:58] walk out of this place more righteous
[2:10:00] than what we came in here
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:04] that we would take your word that would
[2:10:06] be uh
[2:10:07] more upon your word
[2:10:10] that we would be strengthened
[2:10:12] as good soldiers of jesus christ
[2:10:16] that we would take on the tools
[2:10:17] necessary to combat the evil that as
[2:10:20] soon as we step out of this door we know
[2:10:22] that we're going to have to combat evil
[2:10:24] so lord help us to take on the things of

[2:10:28] help us to be shod with the preparation
[2:10:30] of of the gospel help us to take on the
[2:10:33] armor of god that we would shield the
[2:10:36] wiles of the devil that they wouldn't
[2:10:38] enter into our hearts that they wouldn't
[2:10:39] enter into our minds that we would
[2:10:41] continue on and fight the good fight of
[2:10:43] faith lord i pray that you would be in
[2:10:45] each and every uh soul this morning that
[2:10:48] you would be in each and every spirit
