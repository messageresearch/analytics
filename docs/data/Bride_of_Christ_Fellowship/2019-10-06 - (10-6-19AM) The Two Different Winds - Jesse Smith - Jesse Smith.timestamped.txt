[29:10] [Music]
[29:30] I appreciate brother amen introduce a
[29:35] new songs to us don't you
[29:37] god loves that because God said seemed
[29:39] to me a new song the old ones are
[29:41] classics and always will be singing them
[29:44] in heaven too but there's some about a
[29:45] new song
[29:46] praise God gives your fresh strength and
[29:48] joy that is such a tremendous blessing
[29:53] let me just say one thing
[29:55] let me give our brother little rose here
[29:57] why I can't I don't know when I'll get a
[30:00] chance but I walk in here sometimes on
[30:03] the weekends Oh appreciate that thank
[30:09] you but I just walk in on the weekends
[30:12] sometimes and brother Amen maybe here
[30:13] practicing songs all by himself
[30:15] and he's singing his heart to God and
[30:17] he's sweating he's so into it and that
[30:20] just means the world to me praise God
[30:22] and that a blessing praise God that just
[30:25] I just appreciate you so you're pouring
[30:26] yourself into a road just keep doing
[30:28] that if you found your purpose to life
[30:30] you just give yourself to that God will
[30:32] bless it it's a tremendous blessing to
[30:34] us praise God praise God amen thank the
[30:38] Lord all right let's take our Bibles
[30:40] here I like to preach on a little
[30:43] different thought just because there's
[30:45] some situations in the church I like to
[30:47] just look at a little simple thought
[30:49] called two different wins I just wanna
[30:51] look at two different wins kind of
[30:52] dealing with some doctrines recently
[30:55] that kind of haven't blown through the
[30:57] church and thankfully not through
[30:59] everybody but just mainly with the
[31:01] brothers so let's go to John chapter 3 I
[31:08] told you on Wednesday I would like to
[31:10] deal with it and I really want to get
[31:12] back to the purpose series you know and
[31:14] the gifts and everything like that but I
[31:15] do want to just clarify this and kind of
[31:20] show some of the things that were shared
[31:23] with me and the brothers
[31:25] and just cry try to give a balance to it
[31:27] by the Word of God and then Lord willing
[31:30] tonight we'll look at you know the
[31:31] kingdom of heaven I want to keep going
[31:32] on that series that's been a wonderful
[31:33] series I appreciate all the feedback you
[31:35] know some of the sayings have really
[31:36] enjoyed that so I thank the Lord for
[31:38] that
[31:40] so John 3:8 - there's two different
[31:43] kinds of wins right because we know a
[31:45] win represents the Holy Spirit or
[31:47] represents a spirit in this case well we
[31:50] only know there's two kinds of spirits
[31:52] that's the only kind and so it's either
[31:54] the Holy Spirit or it's the unholy
[31:56] spirit the spirit of Antichrist
[31:58] so John 3:8 let's all read that one
[32:03] together one two three the wind bloweth
[32:07] where it listeth and now here is the
[32:10] sound thereof but canst not tell whence
[32:13] it cometh and whither it goeth so is
[32:16] every one that is born of the Spirit so
[32:20] think about the day of Pentecost you
[32:21] know they were gathered there they
[32:23] didn't know it was going to come on the
[32:24] tenth day you know Jesus said just wait
[32:26] until but they got in the condition for
[32:29] the winds to blow praying one Accord
[32:32] that means passion one passion everybody
[32:35] came with one passion to church that day
[32:37] you know not to church that day but uh
[32:39] upper room and the wind of the Spirit
[32:41] blew praise God because they were all in
[32:43] one Accord now the other one of course
[32:46] real familiar seasons 4:14 and there's a
[32:50] few others Lord willing we'll look at
[32:51] those I do want you to I don't want you
[32:54] standing for all these usually you know
[32:56] three is the maximum I've ever read for
[32:58] at acts three three portions of
[33:00] Scripture so Ephesians 4:14
[33:14] encourage you before reduce you know be
[33:15] on your toes spiritually because Satan
[33:18] just needs one thing to get in he just
[33:20] wants to find one little weak spot it's
[33:25] that little that hidden 11 right with a
[33:27] parable we looked at a few weeks ago
[33:29] it's one word with Eve surely you shall
[33:32] not know we know that was a big word
[33:33] right cuz I totally changed the complete
[33:37] meaning of God oh you'll not die but it
[33:40] was still one word and Satan only needs
[33:43] one area of her life to open up and then
[33:46] he can get in there and get a stronghold
[33:49] so be on your toes you just don't say
[33:52] well brother oh she's just gonna teach
[33:53] today it's more than that it's the Holy
[33:55] Spirit trying to anchor our souls in the
[33:58] Word of God and it's trying to keep our
[34:02] lives leaven free if I can just say like
[34:04] that leaven free seasons 4:14 that we
[34:11] henceforth be no more children so see
[34:15] this kind of tells you where a person is
[34:17] in their spiritual life when they're
[34:19] getting tossed around by false doctrine
[34:22] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[34:25] every wind of doctrine by the sleight
[34:28] that means the gambling of man
[34:31] so sometimes men will come to the pulpit
[34:34] horse I've never believed in our church
[34:36] as far as I've seen and they'll just
[34:37] gamble those kind of trying to put
[34:39] things together and see for the people
[34:40] it'll bless the people but when you
[34:42] prayed and been with God you know gets
[34:44] gonna bless the people as long as they
[34:47] got humble hearts see some preachers
[34:50] were just and we know it's not around
[34:52] our groups our friends it's really not
[34:54] around us too much but we hear about it
[34:55] and they just gamble with the word is
[34:58] trying to get the people excited about
[35:00] something that's a shame by the sleight
[35:04] of men and cunning craftiness whereby
[35:07] they lie in wait to deceive but see we
[35:11] are speaking the truth in love may grow
[35:13] up into him in all things which is the
[35:15] head even Christ so see false doctrine
[35:17] will cause people to stunt their growth
[35:20] they'll never grow into Christ any more
[35:22] from that point they can't grow any more
[35:25] because you can only grow
[35:27] the pure Word of God from the reign of
[35:29] God right because the we saw the sins
[35:32] choke out the effects of the word the
[35:35] cares of this world and of course that
[35:36] could be anything false doctrine
[35:37] whatever it is chokes out the effects of
[35:39] the word and the person will never grow
[35:42] with God Almighty let's have a word of
[35:45] Prayer here if you haven't eaten your
[35:47] heart just make a note unto the Lord
[35:48] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[35:50] mercy and your grace we're happy to be
[35:51] in your house and lord I just thank you
[35:54] for your presence Lord your songs in
[35:56] which it's a glory to lift our names to
[35:58] your great name Lord God hallelujah
[36:00] listen lift our voices to that great
[36:02] name Lord we thank you for this
[36:04] opportunity
[36:04] Lord just let your word be preached Lord
[36:07] God and let us Lord as we said let's
[36:09] watch our lives and and father keep them
[36:12] pure before you examining ourselves to
[36:14] make sure we're in the faith Lord God
[36:16] for Lord the spirit of truth is here
[36:19] Lord God because there's two or three
[36:21] gathered in your name and here you are
[36:22] you are the spirit of truth let your
[36:25] Holy Spirit dwell amongst us Lord and
[36:27] lord teach us a clean us purge us keep
[36:31] us pure before your Lord and we just
[36:33] thank you for all things in Jesus
[36:35] Christ's name the church said Amen god
[36:38] bless you be in see the praise God after
[36:52] but there's of course numerous
[36:54] scriptures about wind and we'll get to
[36:56] those in just a moment I just kind of
[36:58] want to mention a few by the grace of
[37:00] the Lord of course I think you've seen
[37:02] them one of most important ones there's
[37:04] you know John 3:8 with the Lord Jesus so
[37:09] Lydia should be up there whenever you're
[37:11] in yeah there's two spirits or two winds
[37:17] and we see it by the scripture now let
[37:22] me turn to the page here I got a few
[37:24] notes here now we know in the beginning
[37:27] the Spirit of God hovered above over the
[37:30] waters in Genesis praise God we might
[37:33] say that's the first wind at least in
[37:36] Scripture of course we know there was a
[37:38] wind in heaven right Satan's false
[37:41] Drinan the war that he started in heaven
[37:43] and brother Babson wars represent after
[37:45] winds represent Wars praise God
[37:48] so it's kind of like when God moves it's
[37:52] battling up its battling and coming
[37:55] against the evil forces praise God
[37:57] because don't you know the Bible said
[37:58] God's a mighty warrior to st. likes to
[38:02] fight wars but God's my army so much
[38:05] stronger amen
[38:06] he's got the real wind of power Amen
[38:09] hallelujah
[38:11] but Satan of course he's allowed to have
[38:14] power there is power of darkness and we
[38:17] never make fun of Satan we never mock
[38:19] Satan people that I've seen that have
[38:21] fallen into some awful trials they mock
[38:24] Satan and call them dumb devil and
[38:26] things like that
[38:27] we never want to say things like that
[38:29] let's not be guilty of things like that
[38:31] you must respect your opponent if you go
[38:34] into a match and you don't respect your
[38:36] opponent you're gonna get knocked out
[38:37] and we never want to we're never want to
[38:41] disrespect Satan what we do want to do
[38:43] is we want to bring authority against
[38:45] him and we want to be bold against him
[38:48] praise God but we don't want to mock him
[38:52] unless you're like Elijah then you can
[38:55] do that you got the spirit of Elijah on
[38:56] you go ahead and I know some people say
[38:59] that we got the bride has Elijah spirit
[39:01] but I don't know about that church I
[39:03] don't know I'm not a prophet
[39:05] I don't prophesy I don't see visions and
[39:08] I don't say thus saith the Lord and I
[39:10] know there's some quotes and I don't
[39:11] things like that but remember you better
[39:13] take every quote back to the word
[39:14] because you get yourself in a pretty
[39:16] strange situation now all the women have
[39:18] the spirit of Elijah on them too you
[39:23] know and you see you got to take every
[39:25] quote back to the word that's what we're
[39:27] seeing as time goes on we're seeing that
[39:29] more and more we've got to be more
[39:31] balanced in the Word of God right like
[39:34] brother man told Perry green you keep
[39:36] your balance in the scriptures I've
[39:37] always appreciated that statement and
[39:39] that's what brother Branham says the and
[39:41] he says that in different words and the
[39:43] message he said the greatest gift the
[39:46] most important thing of the day is a man
[39:48] who can rightly divide the word of God
[39:50] see because it's either gonna allow life
[39:54] the right wind to blow through the
[39:56] church or it's gonna let the wrong wind
[39:58] blow through the church praise God so we
[40:02] want to recognize those two kinds of
[40:05] winds now it's all through the scripture
[40:08] about the winds I'm just gonna hit a few
[40:10] highlights the Bible said in Hosea 87 I
[40:14] preached on this a few years ago they
[40:16] sow to the wind and then they weep Oh a
[40:18] whirlwind so see they plant or they they
[40:23] do evil things and they plant seeds of
[40:26] rebellion and so they're gonna reap a
[40:28] whirlwind we preach on that a few years
[40:30] ago it's actually my book as well with
[40:32] America that's what America is
[40:34] experiencing now the whirlwind starting
[40:36] to form right
[40:37] we know birth pains right the earth is
[40:39] gonna break forth into a new day but
[40:41] it's gonna come through destruction
[40:42] atomic fire volcanic fire right it's
[40:46] gonna break forth into a new day but
[40:49] it's gonna reap all the effects of sin
[40:51] praise God and so there's the evil wind
[40:53] right the whirlwind they reap the
[40:55] whirlwind that's right but and then
[41:00] Jesus said you know what you go out to
[41:02] see a reed shake it with the wind wait
[41:06] to go to some some little wimpy preacher
[41:08] out there and oh he says he said you
[41:10] went out to see a prophet and I say more
[41:12] than a prophet John couldn't be swerved
[41:15] by those Pharisees than those Sadducees
[41:17] he couldn't be swear he knew where he
[41:19] stood
[41:20] he was stood with on the he stood on the
[41:22] well said I guess the sacred sands of
[41:25] God's presence amen
[41:26] because he God had told him when you see
[41:29] a dove he said then you'll know that
[41:31] this is the Messiah and then that's what
[41:33] he testified he said follow him
[41:35] that's the Messiah because I have seen
[41:37] the Dove and I know what I've seen from
[41:40] heaven he's the bridegroom I'm a friend
[41:42] of the bridegroom amen see cuz he knew
[41:45] where he stood praise God he wasn't
[41:47] shaken by any winds of doctrine
[41:52] remember in Ezekiel 37 with the dry
[41:55] bones and said prophesy to the wind
[41:58] hallelujah praise the Lord Amen he
[42:02] prophesied to the holy spirit prophesy
[42:05] for the holy spirit to to move praise
[42:07] God
[42:08] that's part of what I'm starting to
[42:10] understand the Bible said we have keys
[42:12] to bind and loose and sometimes it's too
[42:14] loose the movement of the Holy Spirit on
[42:16] people's lives now I know they
[42:18] impersonate it on TV like it's just it's
[42:21] a mockery every time they're on there
[42:23] there's some loose in a new season I'm
[42:25] loosing a new that I'm loose come on now
[42:27] and that's just it's going overboard
[42:29] that's all for a show but there is a
[42:32] genuine time when God is moving in your
[42:35] life there's certain crossroads of your
[42:37] life when you need deliverance or you
[42:39] need victory or you need to answer from
[42:41] God and a man of God may pray with you
[42:43] or a sister of God may pray with you and
[42:46] ask for something to be done and if it
[42:49] happens what just happened the keys of
[42:51] the kingdom cause something to be loosed
[42:53] upon your life amen
[42:55] hallelujah praise God and then of course
[42:57] the other one is buying the spirits
[42:59] right bind them right we bind evil
[43:02] spirits and and we we have we have
[43:05] authority to tell them to never come
[43:07] back praise God
[43:08] just like the Lord Jesus Christ did but
[43:11] we also have the authority under the
[43:12] anointing of the Holy Spirit to loose
[43:15] God's blessings upon people praise the
[43:17] Lord amen now here's another with the
[43:23] false doctor so you seem good the gods
[43:25] win and you seen Satan's win well you
[43:29] got a couple more acts tutu is a good
[43:31] one the wind of the Holy Spirit came in
[43:33] like a rushing mighty wind amen
[43:35] and we've had that here in our church
[43:37] thank the Lord for that hallelujah now
[43:42] here's two negative one so let's go to
[43:44] James 1:6 and Jude 12 James 1:6 and Jude
[43:48] 12 just to kind of need a refreshment
[43:50] right I don't think I've ever preached
[43:52] just one sermon on the wind James 1:6
[43:55] but just to give you a little background
[43:57] here some more support I'd say from the
[44:02] Word of God James 1:6
[44:08] now let's just read five because in
[44:11] context it's about being more patient
[44:13] and then asking God for wisdom if any of
[44:16] you lack wisdom let him ask of God that
[44:18] giveth to all men liberally and
[44:19] upbraideth not and it shall be given him
[44:22] but let him ask in faith nothing
[44:25] wavering for he that wave earth is like
[44:28] a wave of the sea driven with the wind
[44:32] and tossed we don't want to be this kind
[44:35] of person right we ask God to do
[44:39] something and then we then a week later
[44:41] a month later a year later we're not
[44:43] sure if God heard us or not see the
[44:46] thing to do is get so sincere you're so
[44:48] desperate with God and to be so humble
[44:52] before God that you pray and that in
[44:55] that you know you've been totally
[44:57] sincere you were totally cleaned out
[44:58] when you prayed and so that you know you
[45:01] made your requests unto God God heard
[45:04] your requests and then you can have
[45:05] peace from that moment no matter what
[45:07] happens you know you ask God for wisdom
[45:10] and you know God's gonna answer no
[45:12] matter which way it goes praise God like
[45:15] romance are you're neutral with the will
[45:18] of God see but if you don't pray and
[45:21] fast if you don't seek God's face if you
[45:23] just throw like a half-hearted prayer up
[45:25] there and it's not genuine it's not
[45:27] sincere maybe we didn't maybe didn't
[45:29] confess your sins before you prayed
[45:30] about something and that's why people
[45:32] will wonder and just be discouraged for
[45:34] months or years on end it's because they
[45:36] didn't ask in faith they didn't ask
[45:39] believing and see and then they they're
[45:42] still leaning towards the selfish answer
[45:44] to the prayer because the Bible said
[45:46] later in James 4 they asked upon their
[45:48] lusts and that's why they get impatient
[45:51] but if you ever ask for something in
[45:53] faith you can be patient because jesus
[45:55] said impatience possess your souls Amen
[45:58] plenty of patience you can wait on God
[46:00] amen
[46:01] see because you've got the the divine
[46:03] character of patience the stature part
[46:06] of the statue of a perfect man amen
[46:09] glory see tossed about when they don't
[46:14] have the wisdom of God see some people
[46:16] as we'll get to here in a little bit
[46:18] people will take a quote from brother
[46:20] Branham and they won't even ask God for
[46:21] wisdom
[46:22] they'll just take up for face value what
[46:24] it says instead of really praying about
[46:27] Lord and they'll start sharing it with
[46:28] every every other people rather than
[46:31] actually praying about it first we ought
[46:33] to ask ourselves is this something I
[46:35] should share praise God and do I have
[46:39] the do I have the office to share it
[46:44] what am i sharing it for am i shared to
[46:47] edify or am i sharing to criticize see
[46:53] that's the trouble with social media or
[46:55] let's just say the trouble with group
[46:57] texts got to make sure you're sharing
[47:00] the right thing right so trouble with
[47:03] whatsapp and trouble with Facebook
[47:05] people get on there and I've seen it too
[47:08] you know nothing related to our church
[47:09] but people just post things and they'll
[47:11] criticize churches like this week this
[47:14] man I forget where he lives the United
[47:16] States but he's a message believer so
[47:18] call and he just gets on there and post
[47:20] something just to criticize preachers
[47:22] that preach longer than 30 or 45 minutes
[47:24] because he takes one quote where brother
[47:26] brand says you know you need to preach
[47:27] 30 or 45 minutes you know and but he
[47:30] leaves out all the other quotes where
[47:34] broadband says some fill up long some
[47:36] fill up easy you know he needs out that
[47:38] one praise God and they just get on
[47:41] there to criticize they say well in
[47:43] Mayas situation I experienced this that
[47:46] doesn't edify and it causes arguments
[47:48] and I'll tell you the biggest one is
[47:49] Christmas you all know that one right
[47:51] especially on Facebook if you haven't
[47:53] log into Facebook around December 10th
[47:55] or something like that
[47:56] Lydia's birthday you want to see some
[48:00] arguments oh man you get them going on
[48:01] Christmas boy they'll fight to the death
[48:05] for that one and don't get me wrong I
[48:07] mean obably there's a lot of work
[48:09] there's worldliness attached to any
[48:10] American holiday Thanksgiving you know
[48:14] eaten too much being a glutton that's an
[48:17] evil spirit shopping and the commercial
[48:21] spirit of money and and and the pride of
[48:24] the eyes and lust of the flesh and
[48:26] getting big deals and feel like you're
[48:29] something because of the money you have
[48:31] them that's pride and arrogance amen it
[48:34] takes a real Christian to get down
[48:36] live godly even in the even in the godly
[48:39] holidays see if you gotta be careful why
[48:42] we share things what's our purpose
[48:45] behind that and see the answers right
[48:47] here they don't even ask God for wisdom
[48:49] they don't even take enough time to ask
[48:52] God for it
[48:52] Oh something new I'll share it oh you
[48:55] better be careful don't share something
[48:58] just cause it's new wait on it
[49:00] especially if it's going to cause
[49:01] controversy verse 7 let not that man
[49:06] think he shall receive anything of the
[49:08] Lord see people that don't seek the
[49:11] wisdom of God they're not going to
[49:12] receive anything from God see they can't
[49:14] grow they can't move on with God like we
[49:16] said earlier false doctrine stops people
[49:18] right in their tracks and they can never
[49:20] move on with God and we're gonna show in
[49:24] just a minute it's a very good indicator
[49:27] they're not born again when people bring
[49:31] false doctrine and think about the
[49:33] churches all the churches you've been -
[49:34] I can see sister Karen she's probably
[49:35] thinking you know churches I've been to
[49:38] a Mike mm right
[49:41] you see people who's the people that
[49:43] bring the false doctrine they're the
[49:45] ones that are probably not born again
[49:47] unless they got a swift repentance and I
[49:50] mean a real one not just hey I'm sorry
[49:52] guys sorry hey let's go out - it's got
[49:54] to Burger King afterwards yeah that's
[49:56] not a repentance that's not a repentance
[49:59] you see every false doctrine has a devil
[50:02] behind it and he's trying to like a
[50:05] demon serpent he's trying to slither
[50:07] into your spiritual life to choke you
[50:09] out and then try to choke out other
[50:12] people and kill their influencing and
[50:15] just death he wants the D wants you to
[50:18] die spiritually and take your your your
[50:22] love for God take your love for people
[50:24] many times he wants them to exist exalt
[50:26] themselves because remember every demon
[50:30] stays because people love it that's what
[50:33] we're gonna see with some of these falls
[50:34] doctors when we go through these in just
[50:36] a minute there's just a couple there's
[50:38] devils behind it and the people that
[50:40] love false doctrine they love it because
[50:43] their false doctrine allows them to love
[50:45] the demon of whatever it is
[50:48] like that maniac he loved that demon of
[50:52] murder right because he went to kill
[50:54] brother branham he loved it and so that
[50:56] one couldn't be fully cast out because
[50:59] he loved it he worshiped it
[51:01] he liked the feeling of being strong and
[51:04] like he could beat somebody up he loved
[51:06] that feeling because he gave him
[51:07] strength all but if he only knew the
[51:09] strength of God's love amen
[51:11] where that's that love feels like this I
[51:13] just want to help everybody I just want
[51:15] to be a blessing to everybody praise God
[51:17] I don't want do anything wrong I just
[51:19] want to do good to everybody praise God
[51:22] such a glorious anointing is the love of
[51:25] God Jude
[51:28] when I say Jude 1:12 yeah there's only
[51:30] one chapter little big book Jude 12 now
[51:38] in verse 11 the context is Cain and
[51:41] Balaam one went after greed it was
[51:44] Balaam went after greed cain was just
[51:48] straight rebellion he was just straight
[51:50] rebellion and that's what we see we'll
[51:52] get to a little bit with all the people
[51:54] that don't like fivefold ministry the
[51:57] spirit they love behind it is rebellion
[51:59] they don't want to submit to any man but
[52:02] the Bible says submit to them preachers
[52:05] but they don't want to do that so they
[52:08] love the spirit of rebellion because it
[52:10] makes them feel like they're the ones in
[52:12] charge but see any real pastor any real
[52:14] man of God doesn't even like them they
[52:16] know all the the pressure that goes with
[52:18] being responsible for people's souls and
[52:20] it's not something they enjoy but it
[52:22] makes them humble it makes them like
[52:24] Moses and Aaron when Cora tried to come
[52:26] against him they threw themselves down
[52:27] on their faces before God and pleaded to
[52:30] God for the people that's what a real
[52:33] leader does Amen throws himself down at
[52:37] the altar seeks God's face and ask God
[52:40] for mercy because he knows our God is a
[52:43] consuming fire he don't play around it's
[52:47] a serious thing to fall into the hands
[52:49] of the Living God now I got not lots of
[52:54] notes and I didn't have there's so much
[52:55] on these things I I didn't have time
[52:58] maybe we'll continue next week I don't
[53:00] know but there's
[53:01] much to say and to do but let's go to
[53:04] Jude though Jude 12:11 was rebellion
[53:09] Keynes rebellious spirit because God
[53:14] said all he gate remember he gained the
[53:15] revelation the revelation is the will of
[53:18] God so God gave Cain though his will
[53:21] just do like your brother
[53:23] and you'll be accepted and you'll
[53:24] actually lead him but he turned it down
[53:27] he walked away because he went to rebel
[53:29] and then Balaam tho went after greed he
[53:32] said God give me a second perfect will
[53:34] and gods I don't have one perfect whale
[53:36] but you can walk in my permissive will
[53:38] if you want because I know you love
[53:41] money more than you love the Word of God
[53:43] so it's the error of Balaam Earth's well
[53:45] these are spots in your feasts of
[53:47] charity so see that's what we're having
[53:49] today we're having a feast of love today
[53:52] today's the love feasts praise God we're
[53:55] all feasting together we're just a
[53:57] family with the love of God in our
[53:59] hearts and we're just happy to be
[54:00] together and we're all feasting on God's
[54:02] Word but these these carriers of false
[54:06] doctrine are spots or defilement in our
[54:11] feast right when they come amongst us
[54:16] when they feast with you
[54:19] that's like brother ham says in Christ a
[54:22] minister of God revealed he said all
[54:23] your happy family now God said he said
[54:25] Saint won't let you stay that way and he
[54:27] said if he can't turn somebody in the
[54:29] church against one another he said he'll
[54:31] inject somebody with poison and then
[54:33] send him into the church why because
[54:36] it's right here
[54:36] see all these closer brother brand they
[54:38] all go back to the word amen glory we
[54:40] just got to look harder amen see they
[54:43] feed themselves without and there they
[54:45] are feeding themselves without fear now
[54:49] I got a good notion on that Scripture
[54:51] alright yeah because it seems like
[54:53] there's a parable Jesus tells where the
[54:55] householder is the one who feeds the
[54:58] meat in due season never know what I'm
[54:59] talking about there's a parable so see
[55:02] we're supposed to let the ministry the
[55:04] fivefold ministry is supposed to feed us
[55:06] but these that are carried about with
[55:07] winds they feed themselves they only
[55:11] hear what they want to hear
[55:13] now what God wants them to hear
[55:15] how do you know what God wants you to
[55:18] hear because it's right in the Word of
[55:19] God amen
[55:21] and these false doctrines that are
[55:23] propagated all around now that's not the
[55:26] Word of God and 99% of the time point 9
[55:30] it's just quotes that are misunderstood
[55:32] it's not the word and it becomes a quote
[55:37] war a quote battle but thank God there's
[55:41] always more quotes in what they find
[55:44] that's what I found in every situation
[55:46] there's always more quotes and that way
[55:50] I'll show you today when they get a
[55:52] quote they think it's right they need to
[55:54] read before that and read after that and
[55:58] that's what they don't do what they do
[56:01] they ignore it see it's just being more
[56:04] thorough to being faithful it's be more
[56:06] diligent see clouds they are without
[56:09] water carried about sea of winds again
[56:13] so here we have again winds representing
[56:15] the evil spirit winds and they carry
[56:20] people that hold false doctrine like
[56:23] clouds they just carry them but there's
[56:25] no rain there's no real holy presence of
[56:28] God trees whose fruit withereth without
[56:32] fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots
[56:35] raging waves of the sea foaming out
[56:38] their shame oh my look at that what
[56:42] causes the waves wind praise God so the
[56:47] winds make their lives just there life
[56:49] is a total mess their life is one storm
[56:53] and all these storms and that's because
[56:55] of their own disobedience he says
[56:59] wanderingstar see they can't find a home
[57:01] church right wandering stars now of
[57:05] course everybody a home church that
[57:06] stays there we know isn't a sound
[57:08] believer because the devils can sit
[57:11] around for years and decades too but
[57:13] it's one of the signs that you are is
[57:15] when you're not wandering from pillar to
[57:16] post but you found your position in
[57:19] Christ it is one of the evidences
[57:22] because it's the evidences all the Word
[57:24] of God we looked at that recently to
[57:27] whom is reserved the blackness of
[57:28] Darkness forever now that's
[57:29] for those people who are predestinated
[57:31] to be lost we don't know whose
[57:32] predestinated be lost unless they
[57:33] already we're told in the Bible but to
[57:36] Pete men and women today who are live we
[57:38] don't know which side they're on but we
[57:40] got to issue warnings and we got to tell
[57:42] them if they got wrong doctrine and
[57:45] that's what I've done I've done it over
[57:48] the phone I don't believe the things
[57:50] that I've heard the winds and teachings
[57:53] I don't believe they're of gods I said I
[57:55] don't believe these are evil spirits
[57:56] these are wrong spirits and let's let's
[58:03] begin looking here so see the Holy Ghost
[58:12] wind I want to read this quote here I
[58:17] got a few quotes I want to share with
[58:19] you now how many member broken cisterns
[58:22] brother Ram told a story in this this
[58:25] sermon I'm gonna read a portion of it
[58:27] and brother Boehner had wondered about
[58:30] the evidence of the Holy Ghost for years
[58:32] but in this sermon he tells the angel of
[58:35] the Lord told him what the evidence was
[58:37] the first time he'd ever heard it from
[58:39] an angel because he was telling
[58:42] brotherly Vail he was saying was it
[58:45] speaking in tongues no can't see that he
[58:48] said neither do I said brother Vail
[58:49] though I've been taught that what would
[58:50] you think it would be I said well the
[58:52] most perfect evidence I can think of his
[58:53] love and so we got to talking on that
[58:56] and then I thought that sounded pretty
[58:57] good so I just held that and said if a
[59:00] man has got love but one day the Lord
[59:02] and the vision straightened me out and
[59:03] he said that the evidence of the Spirit
[59:05] was those who could receive the word
[59:08] now you've got to balance this next part
[59:11] out neither love nor speaking in tongues
[59:13] but it's receiving the word now how many
[59:16] know what I'm gonna say now I hope you
[59:19] know what I'm gonna say god is love so
[59:24] what what brother was referring to was
[59:26] just people that act real loving but
[59:30] don't don't misunderstand the evidence
[59:32] of Holy Ghost is love because God is
[59:33] love because you know in other quotes he
[59:37] talks about how Christians science
[59:38] seemed more loving than other people
[59:40] right but
[59:42] see God the angel of the Lord here is
[59:44] trying to show them that the Lord was
[59:46] trying to show them it's those who keep
[59:48] the word right he said that's the
[59:53] evidence receiving the word brother Vail
[59:55] said that's scriptural because in john
[59:57] 14 jesus said when the Holy Ghost is
[59:59] coming to you he will reveal these
[1:00:00] things you that I've taught you and will
[1:00:02] show you things to come
[1:00:03] let's read now let's go to John 14 that
[1:00:09] is very scriptural verse 26 we read
[1:00:22] 14:26 and 16:13 but the comforter which
[1:00:27] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[1:00:28] send in my name he shall teach you all
[1:00:31] things now you got apply that right all
[1:00:35] things for your age right so that's what
[1:00:39] it means it means all things for your
[1:00:41] age
[1:00:41] cuz you and I are never gonna know the
[1:00:42] day or the hour of Christ's coming
[1:00:44] although we'd like to we'd love to get a
[1:00:47] sneak peek just give me the week lower
[1:00:48] number man said you might know know the
[1:00:50] week - because he didn't Jesus and say
[1:00:52] you can't know the week but in other
[1:00:55] words we want to be ready because we
[1:00:56] love Christ but it's all the word he
[1:01:01] said all truth teach you all things for
[1:01:03] your age that's what it means and bring
[1:01:05] all things to remembrance whatsoever
[1:01:07] I've sent unto you so whenever you need
[1:01:09] to remember during your lifetime we just
[1:01:12] got to pray and say God help me remember
[1:01:14] it has promised you the Holy Ghost will
[1:01:17] help you remember it so we don't to go
[1:01:21] into any meeting or any any uh that's
[1:01:24] gonna fall there sorry about that we
[1:01:26] have to go into any meeting or any phone
[1:01:27] call or conversation or church service
[1:01:29] you know or fellowship we have to go
[1:01:32] into any fellowship or anything at all
[1:01:33] and be worried because if we're born
[1:01:36] again we can quote the promise and say
[1:01:37] Jesus bring everything to my remember
[1:01:40] it's amen
[1:01:41] and I'll just have a quick story last
[1:01:42] year a brother the message he didn't
[1:01:44] never eat he didn't go to our church
[1:01:45] he's never gone to our church he called
[1:01:48] me up and left me a voicemail and said I
[1:01:49] need to meet you at certain certain
[1:01:51] place I got to talk to him like here we
[1:01:52] go again I hate those kind of voicemails
[1:01:54] like tell me what you want to talk about
[1:01:55] so I
[1:01:56] least I can prepare like to leave all
[1:01:59] that vagueness aside to pray and say God
[1:02:03] help me out to be nervous but I walked
[1:02:05] into that meeting I fasted and prayed
[1:02:07] that morning it's on a Saturday morning
[1:02:10] and I just said Lord bring all things to
[1:02:13] my remembrance I'm trusting you Holy
[1:02:15] Spirit well he started off he did all
[1:02:17] the talking for like the first half hour
[1:02:19] tell me I was wrong to do a YouTube
[1:02:21] ministry and my church is wrong to have
[1:02:24] YouTube or services on YouTube and just
[1:02:26] bawl me out he was crying but it was
[1:02:29] misguided the reason he was crying
[1:02:31] because there was so much evil on
[1:02:33] YouTube well that doesn't make
[1:02:34] everything on YouTube evil as I said
[1:02:38] there sister Brenda I just sat there
[1:02:39] taking it and I got more courage as I
[1:02:41] sat Dericks I'm like oh holla it's
[1:02:43] coming it felt like a river of water
[1:02:45] coming up I'm just waiting for my turn
[1:02:50] mercy but and then after that after
[1:02:53] about that four additional half-hour
[1:02:54] that it started flowing and by the end
[1:02:57] and nothing more to say and by the end
[1:03:00] he was crying for the testimonies I was
[1:03:03] sharing about the YouTube testimonies
[1:03:04] about a woman fasting for three days God
[1:03:07] is makeup right and that she said there
[1:03:09] you are on YouTube she said I'll never
[1:03:12] wear makeup again see I just got it we
[1:03:16] just got to trust the word amen if Jesus
[1:03:20] said he's gonna bring all things to
[1:03:22] remembrance then he'll bring all things
[1:03:23] to your remembrance amen
[1:03:25] everything that you need that now that
[1:03:26] doesn't mean he will he'll make you win
[1:03:28] every time you feel like you win in
[1:03:30] every every conversation but on the on
[1:03:34] the moments where you need to feel
[1:03:36] victorious he will be with you it
[1:03:41] doesn't mean you're gonna win every
[1:03:42] argument or win every discussion but
[1:03:44] it's gonna mean like if you ask him and
[1:03:46] invite him to come he's gonna come and
[1:03:47] help you so that was broken cisterns now
[1:03:54] one when Joyce and her husband West were
[1:03:57] here a few Wednesday's ago I read these
[1:03:59] at the end I want to reread them from
[1:04:01] the church age book here's now this is
[1:04:03] nine things brother Graham says about
[1:04:05] who has the Holy Ghost first one who's
[1:04:08] taught the word by the
[1:04:09] ghost second the group that can and does
[1:04:13] hear what the Spirit is saying and
[1:04:15] receives the revelation thereof third
[1:04:18] hearing what the Spirit says is the
[1:04:20] evidence forth that we would have the
[1:04:23] teacher come and teach all truth heard
[1:04:25] the word received it and live by it see
[1:04:30] that's the thing that's the trouble with
[1:04:31] us that's other words that's the battle
[1:04:33] Satan is battling us with we go to
[1:04:35] church so faithfully but we got to live
[1:04:37] what we hear we got to live by it praise
[1:04:40] God and that's all that's my battle
[1:04:43] that's your battle all of our battles
[1:04:45] but see we're more than conquerors in
[1:04:47] Christ Jesus abide in the vine and
[1:04:49] you'll bear much fruit praise God stay
[1:04:52] in the word on Monday morning on Monday
[1:04:54] night stay in the word stay in the word
[1:04:56] abiding the word and you'll bring forth
[1:04:58] much fruit hallelujah fifth in every age
[1:05:03] the evidence was the same those who had
[1:05:05] the spirit the teacher heard the word
[1:05:06] and that spirit in them took the word
[1:05:08] and taught it revealed it to them and
[1:05:10] they were of the group that heard the
[1:05:11] messenger and his message and took it
[1:05:14] and lived it six for the believer to
[1:05:18] receive the word for their age in which
[1:05:19] he lives
[1:05:20] seventh if you are true seed you're
[1:05:22] truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you
[1:05:24] will steam his word above your necessary
[1:05:25] meat so you're gonna have to fast
[1:05:27] sometimes and I've been I've been to
[1:05:30] churches in one in Arkansas I've been to
[1:05:32] message churches where they don't
[1:05:34] believe in fasting anymore because they
[1:05:36] say since the cloud came Christ is here
[1:05:38] we don't need a fast anymore that's just
[1:05:40] an excuse for gluttony I keep going to
[1:05:43] gluttony is that right really huh that's
[1:05:45] it and that and the many people in the
[1:05:47] church are gluttonous I've been around
[1:05:49] them and they don't want to fast but
[1:05:53] brother man says when you got the
[1:05:54] evidence of the Holy Ghost he said the
[1:05:56] word it's more important than your food
[1:05:59] amen glory and yearned to live by every
[1:06:03] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:06:05] God my brother have said we read a few
[1:06:07] weeks ago he said one of the greatest
[1:06:08] evidences I know is something that just
[1:06:10] wants to do something for Jesus amen
[1:06:12] there they got soul travail they just
[1:06:15] want to do something so badly number
[1:06:20] eight
[1:06:21] he said the evidence is just the same as
[1:06:23] it was back in the day of our Lord it's
[1:06:25] receiving the word of truth for the day
[1:06:27] in which you live jesus never did stress
[1:06:30] the importance of the works as he did
[1:06:32] the word he knew and if the people got
[1:06:35] the word the works would follow that is
[1:06:37] the Bible so see the most important
[1:06:40] thing is believing and accepting the
[1:06:42] revelations and then if you believe and
[1:06:44] accept the truth of God you will start
[1:06:46] working by the grace of God and you will
[1:06:48] do the right works a lot of people just
[1:06:51] come to the message they jump right and
[1:06:52] they just try to do the works they just
[1:06:54] try to dress holy they just try to cut
[1:06:55] out anything that's that's bad and they
[1:06:57] don't actually understand why they're
[1:06:59] doing it we but see those of us run
[1:07:03] right with the revelation we know why
[1:07:05] we're doing it because the word is the
[1:07:07] absolute and whatever God says it's the
[1:07:11] best thing for us because God's never
[1:07:13] gonna lead us into confusion or lead us
[1:07:15] into an evil life of sin he's gonna lead
[1:07:18] us into holiness and we know God's
[1:07:20] choice is the best choice because he's a
[1:07:22] faithful father hallelujah so we got the
[1:07:26] revelation but see people just fall in
[1:07:28] love with brother Branham and make him
[1:07:29] the absolute rather than making Jesus
[1:07:31] the absolute oh yeah that's right so get
[1:07:37] the revelation first then go to working
[1:07:39] then you have the right works but get
[1:07:42] the word first and number nine a person
[1:07:45] that's truly baptized with the Holy
[1:07:46] Ghost in the body of Christ receiving
[1:07:48] the fullness of the Spirit will be in
[1:07:50] the word all the way see they'll never
[1:07:52] get tired of the preaching of the word
[1:07:53] because that's what they're feeding on
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:57] they're in the fullness of the word amen
[1:08:01] now go to John 16:13 so yeah you can you
[1:08:13] if you ever need scriptures on what is
[1:08:15] evans to the holy ghost ever to anyone
[1:08:16] anyone ever asks you use these two in
[1:08:18] fact there on my video I made a video on
[1:08:20] YouTube called the evidence of the Holy
[1:08:21] Ghost according to Jesus cause that's
[1:08:23] what brother BAM says and it's broken
[1:08:24] cisterns he says let's look at the
[1:08:26] evidence according to Jesus we already
[1:08:28] say that I might not be able to find it
[1:08:32] but that's what he says he said let's
[1:08:35] see what it is according to Jesus I
[1:08:36] don't know if I can find it right now
[1:08:40] well I would have liked to find it but I
[1:08:43] didn't find it ok John 16:13 use those
[1:08:49] two scriptures if anyone ever asks you
[1:08:51] what's the evidence it's being guided
[1:08:52] into all truth and it's learning all
[1:08:55] truth from the word howbeit when he the
[1:08:58] Holy Spirit I'm sorry when the Spirit of
[1:09:00] Truth has come he will guide you into
[1:09:02] all truth for he shall not speak of
[1:09:05] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:09:06] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:09:09] things to come praise God
[1:09:13] so see it all truth your guide into all
[1:09:17] truth and the true jesus said thy Word
[1:09:18] is truth and then he should teach you
[1:09:22] all things so see you have a teachable
[1:09:24] spirit you can be taught new things in
[1:09:27] the word that maybe you're not living
[1:09:28] yet you don't come to church trying to
[1:09:31] teach the preachers although you could
[1:09:34] share something afterwards that would
[1:09:36] bless my heart that's happened many
[1:09:37] times to me but that's not your main
[1:09:39] focus your main focus is to be taught by
[1:09:41] the Lord the word see and then you're
[1:09:46] guided into all truth now
[1:09:49] I want to read a church age book quote
[1:09:54] and I got to find it like I said I'd
[1:09:56] have enough time there's so much copying
[1:09:58] and pasting to show you the great quotes
[1:10:00] I just want to remind you of some of
[1:10:02] these here the first one is brother bran
[1:10:06] told us to not change a thing and that's
[1:10:09] Galatians 1 so why you turn to Galatians
[1:10:11] 1 we might as well read that just to lay
[1:10:13] a little bit of a foundation and all my
[1:10:15] foundation is kind of slow but bear with
[1:10:18] me
[1:10:25] okay
[1:10:26] yeah Galatians 1 verse 6 Galatians 1:6 I
[1:10:40] marvel that you are so soon removed from
[1:10:43] him that called you into the grace of
[1:10:44] Christ unto another gospel which is not
[1:10:47] another but there be some that trouble
[1:10:49] you and would pervert the gospel of
[1:10:51] Christ but though we or an angel from
[1:10:54] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:10:57] than that which we have preached in you
[1:10:58] let him be accursed
[1:10:59] as we said before so say I now again if
[1:11:02] any man preach any other gospel unto you
[1:11:04] than that you have received let him be
[1:11:05] cursed for do I now persuade men or God
[1:11:08] or do I seek to please men Paul was not
[1:11:10] a man pleaser he was such a God pleaser
[1:11:15] that all the men rejected him at the end
[1:11:17] of his ministry just like brother
[1:11:19] Branham for if I yet pleased men I
[1:11:24] should not be the servant of Christ but
[1:11:27] I certify you brethren that the gospel
[1:11:28] which was preached of me is not after
[1:11:30] man for I neither received an aura of
[1:11:32] man neither was I taught it but by the
[1:11:34] revelation of Jesus Christ now in a
[1:11:37] church age book quote brother Branham
[1:11:38] says on paragraph or page 84 that Paul
[1:11:42] was confronting false teachers and he
[1:11:45] said but early apostles looked them in
[1:11:47] the eye and said you were not saying
[1:11:48] what Paul said you were therefore false
[1:11:50] he said o Rome and said oh that sets my
[1:11:53] heart on fire get back to the word he
[1:11:56] says it is not you that really tries the
[1:11:58] Apostle and the prophet and the teacher
[1:12:00] it's the word that tries them one of
[1:12:04] these days there's going to come a
[1:12:05] prophet to the Laotian church age and
[1:12:07] you will know if he's the real one sent
[1:12:09] from God or not yes you will for if he's
[1:12:12] of God he will be in that word exactly
[1:12:15] as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate
[1:12:20] from that word for a moment not by one
[1:12:23] iota amen and that's the authority of
[1:12:28] Galatians 1 for all message Churches
[1:12:31] brother Branham cannot bring anything
[1:12:33] different than what Paul brought he has
[1:12:36] to bring
[1:12:37] the same revelation and more of the same
[1:12:40] because we know Paul didn't know about
[1:12:42] the seven seals
[1:12:42] but that none of those revelations go
[1:12:44] against anything Paul preached but we
[1:12:47] have many today saying they have
[1:12:48] revelation from brother Branham or even
[1:12:50] Jesus as I'll showed you a little bit
[1:12:51] they say they got revelation from Jesus
[1:12:53] that has now changed it's no longer
[1:12:55] preachers it's just tape players that's
[1:12:58] the wrong revelation because Paul never
[1:13:00] said read my epistle only he told
[1:13:02] Timothy preach Amen he said preach the
[1:13:05] Word of God amen
[1:13:07] preach it Timothy amen be instant in
[1:13:09] season out of season four there'll be
[1:13:11] many it teachers with itching ears and
[1:13:14] they won't be able to handle sound
[1:13:15] doctrine because they don't live the
[1:13:17] doctor and they don't love the word they
[1:13:19] don't love Jesus Christ
[1:13:20] they might love him a little bit but
[1:13:22] they love their selfishness more than
[1:13:24] that they love worldliness and pleasures
[1:13:26] more than that but this is how you know
[1:13:28] the the reason brother Brandon is the
[1:13:31] seven church age messenger he taught the
[1:13:33] word exactly the way Paul did and the
[1:13:38] attack now is on the pastors and the
[1:13:41] fivefold ministry why because you most
[1:13:43] often feed from the pastors and Satan's
[1:13:46] trying to try to trap their stop your
[1:13:48] main method of feeding praise God it's
[1:13:52] kind of missing the natural is kind of
[1:13:53] like if Satan would try to stop you from
[1:13:55] going to the grocery store well pretty
[1:13:57] soon you'd only eat fast food and get
[1:13:59] real unhealthy that right church and
[1:14:03] then after that he'll shut off the fast
[1:14:06] food well then pretty soon you'll be
[1:14:08] digging out of garbage cans that's what
[1:14:10] Satan try new now he's not he's going
[1:14:12] after he's going after the the grocery
[1:14:14] stores he's trying to stop you and I
[1:14:17] from feeding the way God said we should
[1:14:19] feed and it's the only way God said we
[1:14:21] should feed because he says faith comes
[1:14:24] by hearing and hearing by the Word of
[1:14:26] God and the Word of God is preached by
[1:14:28] the spirit and the bride amen the
[1:14:31] fivefold ministry Paul started it Paul
[1:14:35] ordained the fivefold ministry and it
[1:14:36] never changed it's never it's never
[1:14:39] going to change because we keep it until
[1:14:42] we come in the fullness of the stature
[1:14:43] of Christ so we all come in a unity of
[1:14:46] the faith praise God
[1:14:53] now I don't have the time I actually
[1:14:55] didn't look look this one up but there's
[1:14:56] a great quote I think it's in questions
[1:14:58] and answers on the seals or I think it's
[1:15:00] yeah it's the beginning of that sermon
[1:15:01] brother Ram says no he tells the people
[1:15:04] and the RAM says well he said he said
[1:15:07] don't try to make anything of the
[1:15:09] seventh seal
[1:15:09] he said don't put your interpretation of
[1:15:11] it he said don't make yourself odd to be
[1:15:13] a Christian
[1:15:14] he said just live the same simple humble
[1:15:16] Christian life telling everybody how
[1:15:19] much you love Jesus that's what I love
[1:15:22] about you know this invitation I got
[1:15:23] last Friday to preach at a fc amen all
[1:15:26] those people know is that I love Jesus
[1:15:28] I never went and and and called them dog
[1:15:32] missus dog meat or anything like that I
[1:15:34] never shoved the word in their face like
[1:15:35] that if they would have if they're
[1:15:38] caught of God they'll see such a
[1:15:40] difference in my life that they'll want
[1:15:42] to hear the word of God but I'll to beat
[1:15:45] anybody up I have to argue or fuss with
[1:15:47] anybody what people want to see now is
[1:15:50] love amen and I know love is corrective
[1:15:52] sometimes it is but the attitude of
[1:15:55] going out and argue in a name-calling
[1:15:57] and things like that
[1:15:58] that's not what the world wants to see
[1:15:59] they want to see genuine love not
[1:16:02] someone who's odd but someone who is a
[1:16:03] real Christian amen they just want to
[1:16:08] see someone who's got a reality in their
[1:16:09] life and it really got the love of God
[1:16:12] anybody can hate my hate is everywhere
[1:16:15] hates and politics hate sin the riots
[1:16:19] overseas you know hate sin the wars
[1:16:21] between nations hate is everywhere but
[1:16:24] love is so rare it ought to be in our
[1:16:26] church amen people ought to see the love
[1:16:30] the love of Jesus Christ in our lives
[1:16:32] now arla our wind is the Holy Ghost wind
[1:16:36] like brother Evan tells that story
[1:16:37] Watson Lake Erie and he saw the wind
[1:16:40] blow up and it moved all the trash to
[1:16:43] the shores that's when we know Oh glory
[1:16:46] that's what we know love is coming to
[1:16:47] rinsable in this church ha ha hey men
[1:16:50] when people come to church and God has
[1:16:52] done blowing all the trash out their
[1:16:54] lives throughout the week oh now we know
[1:16:57] God stirred up and it might look small
[1:16:59] to the world but it's great in the sight
[1:17:01] of God because God's wind is blowing
[1:17:03] through the church amen
[1:17:04] hallelujah and it means a clean now lake
[1:17:08] praise God I clean that life amen
[1:17:11] because the winds of God have driven all
[1:17:13] the trash away but see sinners we reap
[1:17:17] the whirlwind they will reap the
[1:17:21] whirlwind now Church there's a lot of
[1:17:26] things I don't know a lot of details but
[1:17:28] I see I'll say like this of the few
[1:17:30] churches I know that preach false
[1:17:32] doctrine evil things follow them like
[1:17:35] adultery like money scandals like
[1:17:39] suicide you know and don't take that
[1:17:42] personal I know suicide can hit anybody
[1:17:45] but when false doctrine is allowed to
[1:17:48] happen
[1:17:48] spirits can run free and they they take
[1:17:52] a stronghold in the people's lives
[1:17:54] because see the word will set everyone
[1:17:57] free because he whom the Sun sets free
[1:18:00] is free indeed and the love of God
[1:18:03] uproots all roots of bitterness praise
[1:18:05] God because he's there but when the Holy
[1:18:09] Spirit is choked out or he's hindered
[1:18:12] he's limited then people are allowed by
[1:18:15] the evil spirits to stay in those
[1:18:17] conditions and the prisoners are not
[1:18:19] sent free we ought to rejoice if the
[1:18:22] word that we've heard it's keeping us
[1:18:23] free in Christ amen how do I know you
[1:18:26] amen even little services like this
[1:18:29] every Wednesday night my Wednesday was
[1:18:31] such a great time at Lord
[1:18:32] every time that we gather it's great
[1:18:34] because we're just getting sent free
[1:18:35] from demon powers amen temptation and
[1:18:39] any shackles we can break free anytime
[1:18:41] that's why the Word of God is here and
[1:18:43] that's why we have the real Holy Spirit
[1:18:45] praise God to guide us in the truth of
[1:18:48] God's Word not just Church joining in
[1:18:50] religion but really being free from all
[1:18:53] false doctrines in all sins that's what
[1:18:56] the real preaching of the word does amen
[1:18:59] and just like in the waters of
[1:19:01] separation you can only get clean by a
[1:19:03] man who's clean
[1:19:04] thank God God has kept my life clean
[1:19:06] amen right you can't go to a dirty
[1:19:10] priest and get clean you got to go to a
[1:19:12] clean priest and say I try to keep my
[1:19:15] life pure before the Lord and confess
[1:19:16] everything praise
[1:19:18] so that you can experience the same
[1:19:21] hallelujah now I already mentioned this
[1:19:29] but here's some of the spirits that are
[1:19:31] I believe are behind these false
[1:19:33] doctrines I'm about to show the spirit
[1:19:36] of idolatry now that's probably a part
[1:19:39] of with pride because an idol is
[1:19:41] something that you exalt more than God
[1:19:43] so you created your selfishness and your
[1:19:45] pride has created your own God and they
[1:19:48] do it with brother Branham the very one
[1:19:51] that we thank God for the Seven that's
[1:19:53] the one they I idolize and so they love
[1:19:58] exalting William Branham more than Jesus
[1:20:01] Christ for their own gain I don't know
[1:20:04] why brother way but we're gonna find out
[1:20:05] one of these days we're gonna find out
[1:20:07] why do they love exalting a man making
[1:20:11] every word he said thus saith the Lord
[1:20:13] instead of Christ because there's must
[1:20:16] be some sin that they get to enjoy on
[1:20:19] the side and let me say this I listen I
[1:20:25] subscribe to some people from
[1:20:27] Jeffersonville Tabernacle just so I can
[1:20:29] find their false doctrine because I have
[1:20:32] to have to watch out for the souls of
[1:20:33] the saints so here's what they say and
[1:20:36] I've told them to when you were when you
[1:20:38] brothers there here's how they can
[1:20:41] justify saying every word brother Ram
[1:20:42] said as I say the Lord I said well what
[1:20:44] about Abraham memmer I said that what
[1:20:45] about Abraham lying was that let's say
[1:20:47] at the Lord they said yeah because it's
[1:20:49] in the Bible and the Bible is I say at
[1:20:51] the Lord well no you just Church twisted
[1:20:53] that the Bible's thus saith the Lord in
[1:20:57] that every account of every event is
[1:21:00] true but the fact that Abraham lied
[1:21:04] doesn't give you as I say at the Lord to
[1:21:06] lie see how thick that is
[1:21:10] see how deceptive Satan is the Bible
[1:21:16] just records everything true the facts
[1:21:20] are true and those facts are thus saith
[1:21:23] the Lord its thus saith the Lord Abraham
[1:21:25] line but that doesn't give anyone the
[1:21:28] license to lie and say it's okay
[1:21:32] that's why they can say yeah bream lied
[1:21:33] to the IRS it's thought it was thus
[1:21:34] saith the Lord though no it was the
[1:21:37] permissive will of God and the church
[1:21:39] said and when you lie or I lie it's the
[1:21:43] permissive will of God amen
[1:21:45] God's not pleased with that it's not
[1:21:47] about say it's the Lord so see how
[1:21:49] twisted up they are they don't even have
[1:21:51] see the thing is they're not born again
[1:21:53] because if they're born again it would
[1:21:54] guide them out of that foolishness out
[1:21:57] of that nonsense and it would guide them
[1:21:59] into the truth amen
[1:22:00] that's the reason they're there like
[1:22:02] that that's the reason they can say
[1:22:05] things like that can you imagine saying
[1:22:07] a man born in sin who lied or anything
[1:22:10] every word he says is infallible
[1:22:12] that's Pope stuff that's Roman Catholic
[1:22:16] stuff that's Antichrist stuff no matter
[1:22:20] what you say after you cannot mix one or
[1:22:22] the other there's only one who spoke
[1:22:24] everything thus saith the Lord
[1:22:25] that's our Lord Jesus Christ something
[1:22:30] behind that statement or something demon
[1:22:32] power behind that that loves worshipping
[1:22:36] brother Branham more than Christ maybe
[1:22:39] maybe they're maybe they're in
[1:22:40] competition maybe it's a demon of
[1:22:42] competition I've we've seen that in our
[1:22:43] church years ago it's no longer here at
[1:22:46] least have a demon of competition
[1:22:48] amongst certain people so every time God
[1:22:52] would bless somebody in a certain area
[1:22:54] the other person would get mad and upset
[1:22:56] and how do I know because the person
[1:22:59] admitted to me that's how I know they
[1:23:02] told me they told other people to a
[1:23:07] demon of competition oh you know brother
[1:23:11] Jesse's children to this so they got all
[1:23:12] mad my children need to do this and in
[1:23:16] church we're not doing anything and our
[1:23:18] children don't sing song specials our
[1:23:19] children don't memorize the Bible for
[1:23:22] any competition we do it because it's
[1:23:24] training to get them to love the Lord
[1:23:26] but some people take that and say man
[1:23:29] I'd have to do better than that
[1:23:32] they're just trying to show off or
[1:23:34] something like that demons and they
[1:23:38] admit it to us Missy Church what are we
[1:23:43] all human we all need the grace of
[1:23:44] Christ
[1:23:45] and listen grace is available if we'll
[1:23:48] humble ourselves but that's the thing
[1:23:50] Satan won't do
[1:23:51] he won't humble himself because he's so
[1:23:54] full of pride and when the people today
[1:23:56] refuse to repent refuse to say their
[1:23:59] song it shows them about the demon power
[1:24:01] Satan on him because that any man have
[1:24:03] got any woman of God will humble
[1:24:05] themselves under the mighty hand of
[1:24:06] God's Word amen then God will exalt them
[1:24:10] in due season
[1:24:13] that's what Bram did he lied yeah but he
[1:24:15] also humbled himself and went back and
[1:24:17] told the IRS agent he lied see that
[1:24:21] lying spirit of the devil he's the
[1:24:24] father of lies see how good his lies are
[1:24:25] it's not better than the truth though
[1:24:27] it's not as good as the truth he's got
[1:24:30] some good lives but it ain't as good as
[1:24:32] the truth praise God hallelujah sees
[1:24:36] that idolatry they worship they love
[1:24:38] brother Brandon getting more credit than
[1:24:40] the preachers which he should he does he
[1:24:43] should have he should have just as much
[1:24:45] honor as John the Baptist had but John
[1:24:48] the Baptist did have more honor than
[1:24:49] Christ and that's where they get mad
[1:24:51] they want brother Ram to have all the
[1:24:53] honor
[1:24:53] and greed greed with tithes and
[1:24:57] offerings find any reason they don't
[1:25:00] have to come to church and pay ties
[1:25:03] greed we'll get to that one a little bit
[1:25:07] and then rebellion they don't want to
[1:25:09] sit under man they don't have to listen
[1:25:10] to a man and then they accuse the men of
[1:25:13] having a denominational spirit when the
[1:25:16] men are just trying to lead by the word
[1:25:18] because God wants somebody to lead right
[1:25:21] we'll get to that in just little bit now
[1:25:23] let's go through a few these things
[1:25:24] windsor i'm way behind now now there's
[1:25:28] two kinds of wins
[1:25:29] now the word win means to be carried or
[1:25:32] agitated and notice only immature
[1:25:36] christians get blown by these so you
[1:25:40] don't encourage your church not to be
[1:25:42] prideful it encourage you when winds
[1:25:44] blow through churches and you stand
[1:25:45] there like the rock of ages' because
[1:25:47] you're standing on the rock of ages'
[1:25:49] amen
[1:25:50] the first time i heard some of these
[1:25:52] things i knew they were wrong right away
[1:25:53] why cuz i'm anchored in Christ amen
[1:25:56] I've got to get the discernment amen
[1:25:58] you have discernment in your life too if
[1:26:00] you've got the word in you amen
[1:26:02] I've got different measures of
[1:26:04] discernment but everybody the words
[1:26:06] inside of you if the Holy Ghost inside
[1:26:08] of you
[1:26:08] the words inside of you you've got
[1:26:10] discernment to know right and wrong and
[1:26:14] it means driven to different opinions we
[1:26:18] watch different ones over the years go
[1:26:20] from this opinion to that opinion
[1:26:21] totally flip-flop some it just takes a
[1:26:24] matter of a year they can be totally
[1:26:25] there they can be screaming shouting
[1:26:27] amen on this idea that the doctor not
[1:26:30] one year the next year they hate it I've
[1:26:35] never seen that happen in my Christian
[1:26:36] life never the only the major the only
[1:26:40] major doctrine I've ever seen changement
[1:26:41] William is that doctrine well I wouldn't
[1:26:45] say it's major but the doctrine about
[1:26:47] Judas did he have real faith or not four
[1:26:50] years I believe I just took those quotes
[1:26:51] from see the discrepancy but Ram said
[1:26:53] Judas never had no faith to begin with
[1:26:54] in the first place but then I found the
[1:26:57] scripture says in Hebrews 10 the
[1:26:59] scripture says that they they crucified
[1:27:02] again afresh the Son of God who they
[1:27:05] were already sanctified by so to me
[1:27:08] that's the only major dot or the only
[1:27:11] doctrine significant doctrine I've ever
[1:27:12] had to change in my Christian experience
[1:27:17] but it wasn't like one year I was all
[1:27:20] for the fivefold ministry the next year
[1:27:21] I'm against it or one year I'm all for
[1:27:24] paying for ties but afterwards no give
[1:27:26] your ties to Jeffersonville
[1:27:27] or give your ties to a widow woman
[1:27:29] nonsense you see see a real sister Kari
[1:27:33] knows that's true and Brenda you've been
[1:27:34] around long enough sister Beatrice you
[1:27:36] know by the way and you know Jose you
[1:27:38] know real solid saints of God when God's
[1:27:41] revealed the truth of them they stand on
[1:27:43] an amen
[1:27:44] they're not wavering and shaking and
[1:27:46] wondering what's going on they see the
[1:27:47] Word of God it's revealed to them the
[1:27:49] covers torn off it's unveiled the truth
[1:27:52] is there and they know the truth they
[1:27:54] study the truth if you give somebody a
[1:27:56] counterfeit dollar that knows the real
[1:27:57] dollar you're not going to see them
[1:27:59] we're not going to take a counterfeit
[1:28:00] message we're not going to take a
[1:28:02] counterfeit lie we're taking the truth
[1:28:04] of God's Word Amen hallelujah
[1:28:06] you know why Greg because we started the
[1:28:08] word long enough we know what the word
[1:28:10] says
[1:28:11] I served that sculpture long enough I
[1:28:14] know that masterpiece sculpture I said I
[1:28:16] long enough I know it looks like I
[1:28:19] little yeah praise God
[1:28:24] there's only two kinds and I want to see
[1:28:27] my life moved by the holy wind where my
[1:28:32] opinions like my man says my opinions
[1:28:34] only change to be more holy that's what
[1:28:37] he says he's the only change you see is
[1:28:39] more holiness glory see decieved are not
[1:28:45] born again false doctrine shows you're
[1:28:48] not born again let's read that first
[1:28:49] corinthians 6:10 in galatians 5 it's
[1:28:57] actually scriptural oh yeah and then the
[1:28:58] one we read a few weeks ago in 2nd John
[1:29:00] the Bible said if they don't abide in
[1:29:03] the doctrine of Christ they don't have
[1:29:04] Christ so there's three right there I
[1:29:06] only did two but you know there's a
[1:29:08] third one to 1st Corinthians 6:10 nor
[1:29:17] thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor
[1:29:19] revilers nor extortioners shall inherit
[1:29:21] the kingdom of God now revilers one that
[1:29:24] says evil things about Christians and so
[1:29:26] that's kind of connected like whenever
[1:29:28] you see person who's got the false
[1:29:29] doctor and they start reviling or
[1:29:31] speaking evil against real believers
[1:29:33] they do they revile them now Galatians
[1:29:39] 5:19 now the works of the flesh are
[1:29:45] manifest which are these adulteries so
[1:29:47] the thing about this false doctrine is
[1:29:49] on the same level as adultery because
[1:29:52] it's a spiritual fornication that's
[1:29:54] right that's right I mean making love to
[1:29:58] demon powers right adultery fornication
[1:30:02] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[1:30:04] witchcraft
[1:30:06] now there's idolatry there's for all
[1:30:07] those brand worshippers witchcraft
[1:30:09] hatred and they hate the truth variance
[1:30:12] emulations wrath strife seditions and
[1:30:15] heresies I'll give me just a minute let
[1:30:18] me look this up here I didn't get a
[1:30:20] chance I wanted to find that scripture
[1:30:22] about seditions
[1:30:24] I want to give you the Greek definitions
[1:30:26] bear with me Carrodus yeah Curtis
[1:30:28] okay so sedition is a division so never
[1:30:34] someone tries to make divisions or well
[1:30:36] this if you believe what I believe
[1:30:37] you're more spiritual right or like
[1:30:43] they'll call you you're you don't have
[1:30:45] enough revelation that's what they said
[1:30:47] they'll say you're carnal because you
[1:30:50] don't leave there fresh revelation
[1:30:51] nonsense
[1:30:53] that's the sedition a disunion a
[1:30:55] division heresy no I believe I'm
[1:30:59] starting to believe now my some of these
[1:31:01] things about program is heresy what
[1:31:02] they're saying making him every word he
[1:31:04] says thus saith the Lord I mean come on
[1:31:06] what's the heresy it is a disunion it is
[1:31:13] a a sect so a division it's a more
[1:31:18] secure division of false teaching so
[1:31:21] they separate themselves and they go to
[1:31:23] heresies right and then the Bible says
[1:31:32] in verse 21 and suchlike and of which I
[1:31:36] tell you before as I've sold you in the
[1:31:38] past that they which do these things
[1:31:39] shall not inherit the baptism of the
[1:31:41] Holy Ghost the kingdom of God see people
[1:31:46] that hold false doctrines like this it's
[1:31:49] great proof they're not born again how
[1:31:53] can you be like I showed you last year
[1:31:57] how could a Holy Ghost Saint Holy Ghost
[1:32:02] filled Saint call call names call people
[1:32:07] who don't play tapes cost names how
[1:32:12] could you do that so you'd have to have
[1:32:14] a angry spirit against them so I showed
[1:32:17] you the call last year it was actually
[1:32:19] September 2018 because I wouldn't listen
[1:32:20] to the sermon when I showed you all
[1:32:21] those the things wrong coming out of
[1:32:23] Jeffersonville where they call us they
[1:32:28] call us what's the name of that who's
[1:32:30] the one that left Paul again why'd I
[1:32:31] always forget this man's name
[1:32:32] Dimas they cause Dimas is
[1:32:36] because one of their members says if you
[1:32:39] don't play the tapes in the church
[1:32:41] you're a make believer Adiemus and he
[1:32:45] says Dimas and I got the video I listen
[1:32:47] I can show it to you I can I
[1:32:49] I'll let you download it we're a Dimas
[1:32:53] Church coming out we're in their name
[1:32:54] calling us just because we don't believe
[1:32:57] in playing tapes as the main ministry I
[1:33:00] believe in playing tapes all week long
[1:33:02] but Sunday I want to hear from a man
[1:33:04] that's anointed of the same spirit that
[1:33:06] was in brother Branham amen because Mel
[1:33:09] Abraham is no longer in the land of
[1:33:11] living his ministry is no longer living
[1:33:14] we can listen to it on tape but his
[1:33:17] ministry is over Moses is gone raise
[1:33:21] them up at Joshua Amen now we know the
[1:33:24] Joshua is the Holy Ghost because that's
[1:33:25] the very ancestors but it's in the
[1:33:27] fivefold ministry praise God as far as
[1:33:29] preaching the Word of God so but we're
[1:33:35] called D mice's because that now see the
[1:33:37] elect
[1:33:38] now but let's balance that out because
[1:33:41] you can grow in understanding remember
[1:33:43] brother Branham called Jesus the third
[1:33:45] person the Trinity
[1:33:46] three months before the church ages but
[1:33:51] see that brother William then we started
[1:33:52] when he started selling down brother
[1:33:53] Jose with the books God showed him it
[1:33:55] was wrong
[1:33:56] hey man we started studying down to
[1:33:57] teach the Word of God God showed him it
[1:33:59] was wrong he never said it after that
[1:34:02] because he felt worn by the Holy Spirit
[1:34:04] I'd better warn the people seeing that
[1:34:07] the Catholic Church is coming in under
[1:34:09] JFK I better warn the people I feel
[1:34:11] pressed to the Holy Spirit so when he
[1:34:13] sat down to settle it and studied out
[1:34:15] what the Holy Spirit show him he showed
[1:34:16] that Jesus Christ they'll Jehovah the
[1:34:19] Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new
[1:34:20] and that's all the revelation chapter
[1:34:24] one is all about the supreme deity of
[1:34:26] Christ amen not a second or third but
[1:34:29] the person amen the visible
[1:34:31] manifestation of the one person of God
[1:34:34] but all the way up to three months
[1:34:36] before he was saying third person
[1:34:38] attorney let the third personal attorney
[1:34:40] the Holy Spirit come into our services
[1:34:45] he wasn't deceived he just wasn't time
[1:34:47] for the revelation
[1:34:49] because the Bible said the elect can't
[1:34:51] be deceived praise God
[1:34:54] Oh cuz God knows we're gonna receive it
[1:34:57] eventually because the elect will that's
[1:35:02] right yes sir
[1:35:03] time and season now let's review these
[1:35:05] past wins real quick just a minute I
[1:35:09] just wanna do a minute on it I promise
[1:35:11] well understand I promise I'll try I
[1:35:12] don't want to promise things I can't
[1:35:14] keep you know getting the spirit of that
[1:35:16] and then spirit of a thought and I'm the
[1:35:18] Holy Spirit might want me to finish it
[1:35:20] so that was Ephesian sermon that was
[1:35:25] Ephesians series yeah so I did four
[1:35:29] winds that were blowing out of there I
[1:35:32] already went over to one they said every
[1:35:33] word was thus saith the Lord
[1:35:35] yeah and their reasoning behind that
[1:35:39] will all the Bible's thus saith the Lord
[1:35:41] I mean yeah it is but it's not with the
[1:35:44] way you're saying that what is thus
[1:35:46] saith the Lord the second thing they
[1:35:48] type Joseph are the Old Testament as the
[1:35:51] prophets son which brother Graham never
[1:35:53] did that and that and then and then they
[1:35:56] say and then they said in that letter
[1:35:57] here I stand they said why should the
[1:35:59] bride be starving and Joseph's wife was
[1:36:02] never starving Asuna tha's never
[1:36:05] starving Amen you and I are never
[1:36:08] starving as long as we're facing on the
[1:36:10] Lord Amen that evil spirit is making the
[1:36:14] bride the starving Egypt I'm sorry I'm
[1:36:16] not a sinner I'm not I used to be about
[1:36:18] not anymore I'm the life of Christ amen
[1:36:22] I got food on the table every time I
[1:36:24] come to the table praise God see that's
[1:36:27] their to that's to the lies the third is
[1:36:30] what house will you bill me that they
[1:36:32] when program preached that right before
[1:36:34] Perry green preached it as an ordination
[1:36:37] they take a court out of context and
[1:36:40] they say that brother Branham was
[1:36:43] supposed to be back in every pulpit but
[1:36:46] we showed how that's see they added
[1:36:47] their own interpretation brother BAM
[1:36:49] never said that
[1:36:51] well the bram said
[1:36:53] him up to make some announcements not to
[1:36:54] take brother Green's pulpit see this is
[1:36:59] another scene that they used to say all
[1:37:00] we only say with the tape saying now
[1:37:02] they're injecting their own thoughts
[1:37:03] like a spear while he's doing a spirit
[1:37:06] won't be content with a little bit of
[1:37:07] sin he wants to eat up more of their
[1:37:09] life right he wants to consume more and
[1:37:11] if they don't stop it it will it has
[1:37:13] growing power like leaven praise God and
[1:37:18] it's growing power like like gangrene
[1:37:20] like hankering if they don't stop the
[1:37:24] lies they'll grow and greater and the
[1:37:26] greater lies and the fourth thing was
[1:37:29] tape boys are the true fivefold ministry
[1:37:30] that kind of goes along with some things
[1:37:33] I'll share today and they used the
[1:37:37] sermon the token where brother BAM says
[1:37:39] the spies that got into Jericho we're
[1:37:41] tape boys well but I'm just using that
[1:37:44] as an example but if scripturally if if
[1:37:48] Rahab came out she had to go to the
[1:37:50] priest if she wonder worship amen
[1:37:54] she started to follow the waters of
[1:37:55] separation you couldn't separate Rahab
[1:37:58] from the Aaronic ministry praise God so
[1:38:02] it is today you can't separate the
[1:38:03] Gentile bride from the fivefold ministry
[1:38:05] hallelujah okay now let's go today
[1:38:09] recent wins I have a tape I can show you
[1:38:13] where the Jeffersonville people call
[1:38:16] themselves the lion's den can you
[1:38:18] imagine that about fell over and I heard
[1:38:20] that they say welcome to the lion's den
[1:38:23] and their reasoning is a most 3/7 when a
[1:38:26] lion roars it's like a prophet the word
[1:38:28] Lord comes the Prophet but that's the
[1:38:30] wrong type Church Daniel wasn't Daniel
[1:38:34] was the prophet amongst lions amen
[1:38:36] and that's what's happened amen brother
[1:38:38] Brad was a bunch of money my man's
[1:38:41] message is to around a bunch of lions
[1:38:43] amen
[1:38:44] and they ain't prophets that's not the
[1:38:46] kind of line I'm talking about how to
[1:38:47] know about the other kind of lion the
[1:38:50] liars praise God
[1:38:53] glory that just came to me I didn't know
[1:38:55] I didn't plan that one I'm not trying to
[1:38:58] be smart out but that's the reality
[1:38:59] that's the wrong time Daniel was the
[1:39:02] prophet in the midst of the hungry lions
[1:39:04] and God silenced the Lions
[1:39:06] for the prophet's sake and they come out
[1:39:10] right there and say welcome to the lines
[1:39:12] then because the lion's roar damos 3/7
[1:39:14] you got the wrong type that's what we
[1:39:17] see year after year wrong miss out book
[1:39:19] they don't apply the word right they
[1:39:22] miss apply the word and in that they say
[1:39:25] it's the tapes or nothing so in other
[1:39:27] words we are either gonna play tapes or
[1:39:28] we won't listen to any man there's the
[1:39:30] rebellion spirit let's see here's the
[1:39:34] balance church but for us it's not
[1:39:36] preaching or nothing because they ask
[1:39:38] brother Branham we have no preachers to
[1:39:40] go - can we play tapes and brother BAM
[1:39:42] said yeah yeah if you have no other
[1:39:47] church to go to then play a tape if
[1:39:50] you're out traveling and you your plans
[1:39:52] get mixed up and you don't have a church
[1:39:54] you better play a tape go do something
[1:39:57] but don't forget the other Cobra man
[1:39:59] said if I knew there's a church in the
[1:40:01] city that only had one slice of bread he
[1:40:03] said if the only thing they taught was
[1:40:05] Jesus was divine I'd go to that church
[1:40:07] because I want to show God which side
[1:40:10] I'm on amen so see we don't take the
[1:40:13] arrogant attitude well I'm preaching
[1:40:14] only know there there may be times there
[1:40:17] may be scenes of life where there's no
[1:40:19] pastor there and God's trying to race up
[1:40:21] on those little boys to be a real man of
[1:40:22] God he had a pastor yet but God's trying
[1:40:25] to raise them up to be a real preacher
[1:40:28] so see you gotta balance these things
[1:40:30] out your sin see that's what they don't
[1:40:32] do they don't bounce it out they don't
[1:40:35] pray long enough they don't get the
[1:40:36] wisdom of God they just find a quote and
[1:40:39] spew out whatever they want to satisfy
[1:40:40] they're less behind the scenes now I
[1:40:48] about fell over and I heard this one too
[1:40:49] and I just found this one this year well
[1:40:52] these are both this year by the way go
[1:40:55] to revelation 22:16 well I think I got
[1:40:58] it up here I'm sorry yeah you can look
[1:40:59] up here right but it's kind of hard to
[1:41:00] see I should have used black I'm sorry
[1:41:01] about the light brown so there's a video
[1:41:04] where prophets family says Jesus teaches
[1:41:08] tape churches in revelation 22:16
[1:41:10] and you ought to hear the people shout
[1:41:12] or scream they're like that's the same
[1:41:16] thing same thing in the seven thunders
[1:41:18] that's that that false movement
[1:41:20] when those preachers would say certain
[1:41:22] words the people go out and then and
[1:41:24] then we had friends that came out of
[1:41:26] that and said we didn't know what we
[1:41:27] were screaming about we just want to act
[1:41:29] like everybody else and try to get
[1:41:30] anointed and the people are screaming
[1:41:34] about things they're crowing about
[1:41:35] things they don't even understand
[1:41:38] right and I said this last year I still
[1:41:41] mean it I know there's lot of people in
[1:41:42] that church system any that been hurt by
[1:41:44] preachers I know that but that doesn't
[1:41:46] doesn't give us any right not to forgive
[1:41:49] them preachers or go back and what
[1:41:51] really should be done they should go
[1:41:52] back and have a meeting face-to-face and
[1:41:54] make that right but instead you can hear
[1:41:57] the pain and their screams you can hear
[1:41:59] it listen to it sometime you can hear
[1:42:01] the pain they'll just scream and on all
[1:42:03] this tape stuff tapes huh
[1:42:04] no no preachers no preachers no
[1:42:05] preachers cuz they've been hurt and
[1:42:07] doesn't even sound right but it takes
[1:42:11] and as the vindication that my wife
[1:42:13] talked to another preacher's wife and
[1:42:16] she said the same thing and we never
[1:42:18] even talked about it so both of us that
[1:42:20] but have the Holy Ghost we both can hear
[1:42:22] those spirits crying out so it's not
[1:42:25] just one witness just two and if you
[1:42:27] listen to it you'll be the third fourth
[1:42:29] so they read this quote I Jesus have
[1:42:32] sent mine angel to testify of these
[1:42:34] things in the churches this is the last
[1:42:35] chapter of the Bible I'm the root and
[1:42:37] offspring of David so they say this
[1:42:39] angels brother branham and then the
[1:42:42] church is our local churches and guess
[1:42:44] what they use they use the Scofield
[1:42:46] Bible because if you go to revelation
[1:42:52] 22:16 look at the footnote see the same
[1:42:57] Bible they print in there they're so
[1:42:58] proud out there quotes which that's fine
[1:43:00] I mean I'm not doubting that but I'm
[1:43:02] just saying revelation 22:16 it's on F
[1:43:09] yeah there F reference is local and so
[1:43:13] the family members read that and the
[1:43:15] people shout the exact quote is Jesus
[1:43:18] himself said play tapes in your local
[1:43:20] churches and the people just receive it
[1:43:23] like screaming and shouting and they
[1:43:28] don't even realize Saints that if that's
[1:43:30] true then Jesus just undid what he did
[1:43:33] through Paul
[1:43:34] because Paul said teach preachers
[1:43:37] trained them up that they might teach
[1:43:39] others also amen
[1:43:40] he said ordained preachers in every city
[1:43:42] that they might preach the word amen
[1:43:44] so then Jesus contradicts himself tells
[1:43:48] Paul one thing and then Jesus comes
[1:43:50] around to know I'll change it because
[1:43:51] now Paul is dead and they can't much
[1:43:54] that they don't enough spiritual
[1:43:55] discernment to catch that that now it's
[1:43:59] actually a curse to change anything Paul
[1:44:01] said it's now a curse and the people
[1:44:04] receive that curse and they say glory to
[1:44:08] God can you believe that it's shocking
[1:44:12] it's shocking to see what people will
[1:44:14] swallow all because they don't want to
[1:44:17] believe the truth go to first
[1:44:21] Corinthians 3 real quick I read this on
[1:44:29] Wednesday night but I said I'm gonna
[1:44:30] hold off till Wednesday I know if you
[1:44:31] remember this turn habit now he's
[1:44:37] talking about how the corinthians were
[1:44:39] carnal because they favored preachers
[1:44:41] now let's not be guilty of that 1st
[1:44:44] corinthians 3 for for while one saith I
[1:44:46] am of Paul and another I'm Apollo see
[1:44:48] I'm a brother Jessie's Church I'm a
[1:44:50] brother Sam miss church I'm a brother
[1:44:51] Brooks's Church he said aren't you all
[1:44:53] carnal let me let me bragging I'll tell
[1:44:57] you my pastor is let me oh come on mom
[1:44:59] we're all just sinners saved by grace
[1:45:03] he's aren't you carnal verse 5 then who
[1:45:05] that is Paul and who is Apollo's but
[1:45:08] ministers by whom he believed and here
[1:45:11] it is right here as even as the Lord
[1:45:13] gave to every man
[1:45:16] God gave every man a minister to preach
[1:45:19] you the word that you might believe they
[1:45:22] met and they said I'll blessed are the
[1:45:24] feet of them who bring the tidings of
[1:45:26] truth amen
[1:45:28] hallelujah who bring great news that's
[1:45:31] what God thinks of preachers but this
[1:45:33] movement wants you to think the opposite
[1:45:34] of them don't get me wrong someone
[1:45:37] shouldn't be preaching some of them our
[1:45:39] slight are doing slight at the pulpit
[1:45:42] they're playing around with the word
[1:45:43] trying to just get the people excited
[1:45:46] praise God I know this it's not my job
[1:45:49] to get you excited if the word doesn't
[1:45:50] make you excited nothing will praise God
[1:45:54] amen
[1:45:55] and if the word don't make me excited
[1:45:58] nothing will the word has to lift us up
[1:46:01] the word has to encourage us the word
[1:46:03] has to strengthen us but we've got to
[1:46:05] receive it amen
[1:46:09] that's the exact quote I listened to
[1:46:11] this morning my wife heard it too
[1:46:13] Jesus himself said play tapes in your
[1:46:14] local church well that totally does undo
[1:46:16] everything Jesus already told Paul so if
[1:46:18] you're gonna believe who's gonna be
[1:46:19] Jeffersonville or Paul I'm gonna side
[1:46:21] with Paul every time the second one I'm
[1:46:27] sorry though there's a link it was May
[1:46:28] 12th this year if you want the link I
[1:46:30] got it now for times sake let me do two
[1:46:36] doctrines that pass through our church
[1:46:38] and I'm gonna cut off the live stream
[1:46:39] and share a few things personally do
[1:46:41] with just our church here so there's two
[1:46:45] main false teachings that have been
[1:46:47] spread amongst the brothers I believe
[1:46:49] now if sisters if a spread to you let me
[1:46:51] know the first one is there's no Merton
[1:46:54] there's no mercy for the church ages and
[1:46:56] there's time no longer now here is the
[1:47:02] Miss applied quote now look look where
[1:47:04] it's in its before it's actually a
[1:47:06] couple days before the seals were loosed
[1:47:10] but see that the error of this is that
[1:47:13] these people will say we'll see it's in
[1:47:14] the seals it's got to be thus saith the
[1:47:16] Lord
[1:47:16] well actually it's right before the
[1:47:18] seals were opened if you want to get
[1:47:21] technical and you ought to now notice
[1:47:27] this is not revealed until this this
[1:47:29] book is not revealed until the church
[1:47:31] ages and denominations has run out and
[1:47:33] there's time no more to see this group
[1:47:38] whatever group it is they're taking this
[1:47:42] quote and saying well if the seals are
[1:47:44] broke in 1963
[1:47:46] church age is 60 well then there's no
[1:47:49] more mercy anymore and what they say is
[1:47:52] it's there's only mercy for the elected
[1:47:53] bride and that's wrong there's mercy for
[1:47:56] everybody
[1:48:01] so I replied and I said oh I shouldn't
[1:48:06] the name up there sorry is this on the
[1:48:08] light is the screen on the livestream
[1:48:09] okay
[1:48:10] okay thank you sorry I didn't mean to
[1:48:12] put that up there I replied and they
[1:48:14] said yes there's still mercy just not
[1:48:16] for the church ages the individual who
[1:48:18] picks up the anointed word but not the
[1:48:19] church whole the building speaking of in
[1:48:21] other words the denominations no there
[1:48:24] is still mercy and salvation for the
[1:48:26] foolish virgins than they were to see
[1:48:27] you 64 after the seals program said they
[1:48:32] asked me what about now look at this
[1:48:33] what about the people that believe in
[1:48:35] the Lord now and don't like what you
[1:48:37] preach they don't have to believe this
[1:48:41] that's why I just let my friends go my
[1:48:43] friends I want to leave the message fine
[1:48:45] I'm still your friend i'm still gonna
[1:48:46] shine the light of christ to you they
[1:48:49] don't have to believe the way i prayed
[1:48:50] you see don't have to believe that for
[1:48:52] the last day message will they be saved
[1:48:56] but i'm told no because that one quote
[1:49:00] will see you gotta keep reading you
[1:49:04] gotta keep praying ask God for wisdom if
[1:49:10] they believe the Lord see and if they
[1:49:12] disagree with this say I don't believe
[1:49:13] the word I don't know look at this I
[1:49:14] don't believe in the bat Zilla ghost
[1:49:16] that shows where their head in the
[1:49:17] Tribulation Period oh thank God for the
[1:49:19] baptism of the holy ghost then he says
[1:49:24] this but those who can accept this word
[1:49:25] is fullest not me preaching it because
[1:49:27] because it's the Bible see he never
[1:49:29] emphasized himself it's always about the
[1:49:31] word amen it's not about so much brother
[1:49:34] brand it's not so much about John the
[1:49:35] Baptist it's about Christ the Messiah
[1:49:37] amen he's never never pumping up himself
[1:49:42] we're not to fall in love with Eleazar
[1:49:43] we're to fall in love with Roberto I'm
[1:49:45] sorry with with the eyes again the head
[1:49:47] now we are Rebekah we don't fall in love
[1:49:49] with ourselves sorry
[1:49:50] see how the Holy Spirit corrected that
[1:49:54] those who accept that is what free
[1:49:56] they're forgiven just accept the word
[1:49:59] because the words already been judged
[1:50:01] Catholic can be saved Lutheran methis
[1:50:03] they can all be saved as long as they
[1:50:05] judge the word the right way are they
[1:50:08] gonna have any reward probably not
[1:50:11] because they turn down truth they ask
[1:50:16] him again same sermon and this is what
[1:50:18] this is what people are saying the
[1:50:22] church age ending and blacked out the
[1:50:23] bride is called have we already entered
[1:50:25] the Tribulation Period some people
[1:50:27] believe that no no I wish I could just
[1:50:32] have more time when I see the bride when
[1:50:34] she's taking for the church then the
[1:50:35] church age will cease now here's where
[1:50:41] people get this they get so off on this
[1:50:44] scripture they get off on this right
[1:50:45] here because revelation 10 7 we all know
[1:50:47] that but a man's ministry time is no
[1:50:49] more after the rapture and many
[1:50:52] interpret that many falsely interpret
[1:50:55] this and say see after the seals there
[1:50:57] was no time no more longer there's no
[1:50:58] more mercy for anybody nonsense nonsense
[1:51:04] look what he says
[1:51:06] now I'm sorry I put that one up again
[1:51:09] next one don't you believe that Jesus
[1:51:12] might come 100 years yet I don't know
[1:51:14] when he's coming no man knows when it's
[1:51:15] coming but I'm gonna try to keep on
[1:51:16] preaching and doing everything I can
[1:51:17] till he comes if he isn't here today
[1:51:19] I'll be looking for him tomorrow it
[1:51:20] isn't here this week I'll be looking for
[1:51:22] him next week if he isn't here in the
[1:51:23] next 10 years and I live I'll be looking
[1:51:24] for him in the next 30 years see I'll
[1:51:26] still be looking I don't know when he's
[1:51:28] coming I but I want to live true to his
[1:51:29] word and true his people and live like a
[1:51:31] Christian and wait for us coming keep on
[1:51:35] preaching jail services getting
[1:51:37] everybody saved you can I don't know
[1:51:42] when he's coming over to us let's
[1:51:43] remember this don't change here here's
[1:51:44] the court I mentioned earlier don't
[1:51:45] change anything
[1:51:46] only your ways from sin to righteousness
[1:51:51] just keep right on that's your job go
[1:51:54] right on the same all that understand
[1:51:56] that clearly say Church age book I'm
[1:52:01] sorry now look he even admits he could
[1:52:04] have been wrong in the seals he admits
[1:52:06] it right here he said I could have been
[1:52:08] wrong about that
[1:52:09] Sheba's program didn't have time to go
[1:52:11] back and study he was praying for sick
[1:52:13] people he didn't have time to go back
[1:52:15] and look at every single sermon ever
[1:52:16] preached brother Graham have you made
[1:52:20] statements recently concerning the
[1:52:22] church ages the ended Laodicea no I
[1:52:23] never said it's ended
[1:52:24] if you did you misunderstood or eyes
[1:52:26] look how humble that is or I said it
[1:52:28] wrong yeah and I'll be honest how many
[1:52:33] I've listened to the breach and thought
[1:52:34] that there was no more mercy I'll be
[1:52:36] honest I did the first time I thought
[1:52:38] because broadband makes it sound like
[1:52:40] when that lamb in Revelation 5 comes to
[1:52:42] take the book but a man makes it sound
[1:52:44] like he left the intercession booth and
[1:52:45] there's no more intercession but maybe
[1:52:50] maybe he said it wrong maybe of course
[1:52:57] he said it wrong because he just tells
[1:52:59] you he said there is still mercy there
[1:53:02] is still mercy Oh will you be surprised
[1:53:06] how many people want to bawl me out for
[1:53:07] saying that well he said maybe I was
[1:53:09] wrong and then he tells him straightly
[1:53:11] no it's not the tribulation we're still
[1:53:14] in the church ages if this is the last
[1:53:16] Church ages then the church ages latest
[1:53:18] yeah it has an end when it ends the
[1:53:20] church is gone so as long as Dirks is
[1:53:22] here it hasn't ended see brother haven't
[1:53:26] admitted he might have said it wrong see
[1:53:28] any true true Christian can home of
[1:53:29] themselves and say that I might have
[1:53:31] said it wrong Church ages and at the
[1:53:35] rapture and that's where they'll say
[1:53:37] we'll see the raptures already happen to
[1:53:38] me the shouts already going I've already
[1:53:39] got rapturing grace in me oh come on
[1:53:42] but don't forget the rapture has three
[1:53:44] parts to it shout voice Trump right the
[1:53:49] shout is just to get you ready right the
[1:53:52] voice raised the dead and then the
[1:53:53] trumpet changes your body see they got
[1:53:56] all mixed up but Arab says any old
[1:53:59] hypocrite can do that say I'm Jesus but
[1:54:02] the life the Lord Jesus body is sitting
[1:54:04] at the right hand of the Majesty when he
[1:54:06] comes time is no more when that body
[1:54:08] returns to the earth amen glory see they
[1:54:13] misunderstand revelation 10 6 because
[1:54:15] they're not born again they jump to
[1:54:16] conclusions in the seals because they
[1:54:18] don't read on after the seals because
[1:54:21] they want to try to make themselves look
[1:54:22] I got some revelation you got nothing
[1:54:24] amen but you need to get this humility
[1:54:27] and getting the presence of God and get
[1:54:29] some real revelation and if you get some
[1:54:30] real revelation you'll become a servant
[1:54:32] in your local church that's what you'll
[1:54:35] become because we saw it last week or
[1:54:37] cup weeks ago
[1:54:38] God always met garrisons upon his people
[1:54:41] brother man said I'm garrison by your
[1:54:44] prayers so you have a ministry here's
[1:54:48] the second one I'm almost done here
[1:54:52] they say brother branham is not the
[1:54:54] seven church age messenger and here's
[1:54:57] the quote it's a miss supplied quotes
[1:54:59] from right after the church ages and now
[1:55:01] if you'll notice little Willie out there
[1:55:03] put my name under that star out there
[1:55:04] and that's the reason I passed it over
[1:55:06] you see because I now I'm going to be
[1:55:08] honest as I can be I don't think I have
[1:55:10] anything to do with that messenger now
[1:55:12] Church I believe brother Graham just
[1:55:15] didn't have the revelation yet that's
[1:55:19] what I believe this is 1961 right the
[1:55:23] beginning of 1961 he didn't he didn't
[1:55:26] even know the purpose for his life yet
[1:55:28] he didn't even know what the third Pole
[1:55:29] really was yet so see people take this
[1:55:33] and say look he's honest he's honest as
[1:55:35] can be he's not the seven churches
[1:55:37] message well then who is and that's what
[1:55:39] I don't know what I think is they're
[1:55:41] trying to make Joseph brand in the third
[1:55:43] or the seventh ear change messenger
[1:55:44] that's what I think but I don't know but
[1:55:48] doesn't matter now once again they don't
[1:55:52] read above I don't know I'm sorry this
[1:55:55] is below see he even says below that he
[1:55:59] might be wrong he said I'm gonna break
[1:56:00] down here just a minute and tell you
[1:56:01] something let's jerk that thing off of
[1:56:03] Willie's done up there and then say it
[1:56:05] let's say it's right so let's say that
[1:56:06] Branham named under that seven star is
[1:56:08] right let's just say it's right I can't
[1:56:10] say that brethren that's a stuffed shirt
[1:56:12] so he knew there was pride if brother
[1:56:14] Aaron put his old name under that
[1:56:15] seventh star he knew it puff him up and
[1:56:18] pride he said that's a stuffed shirt
[1:56:25] even if I believed it I wouldn't say it
[1:56:27] see somebody else says it that's them
[1:56:32] now if you read I can't wear
[1:56:35] can't find where Bodrum ever
[1:56:36] emphatically declares himself as a seven
[1:56:39] church age messenger but the clues in
[1:56:41] the church age book only point to him
[1:56:44] the next closest person might be his son
[1:56:46] Joseph
[1:56:47] but again Joseph never says thus saith
[1:56:49] the Lord on his on his own because I
[1:56:52] asked his to closer to his closest
[1:56:53] friends I said has he ever said thou
[1:56:55] said Lord they said they've never heard
[1:56:56] it
[1:56:56] he's 64 years old if you're a prophet I
[1:57:01] would think maybe you would say at some
[1:57:02] point before 64 years maybe God's
[1:57:05] waiting like Moses maybe that's true I
[1:57:07] don't know but see we have to watch the
[1:57:10] fruits of the tree no matter what and
[1:57:12] the fruits break the Word of God now
[1:57:18] here's here's the church age book Road
[1:57:20] Ram said the messenger was already here
[1:57:22] now in 1965 so the measure of this
[1:57:24] legacy in age has to be here now so
[1:57:27] can't be anybody that was not born yet
[1:57:31] that throws me out throws all these
[1:57:35] other preachers out right which we never
[1:57:37] claimed to be but all these guys
[1:57:38] overseas or that claim to be a messenger
[1:57:41] nonsense
[1:57:45] buh-bam says the messenger a prophet
[1:57:47] will always be accurate and like I said
[1:57:49] two lifetime friends I've never heard
[1:57:51] I've never heard Joseph say thou said
[1:57:53] the Lord cuz my man said this prophet
[1:57:54] will have accuracy with his thus saith
[1:57:57] the Lord
[1:57:58] so Joseph doesn't meet the requirements
[1:58:00] of the seven church age messenger cannot
[1:58:04] be a heavenly being
[1:58:05] he said it's a man he says not a
[1:58:06] heavenly being it's a man he's not here
[1:58:10] on the earth now he said it's not Jesus
[1:58:14] Christ the people in John's day mistook
[1:58:18] him for the Messiah
[1:58:20] now I'm gonna skip that the scriptures
[1:58:22] you know he said they're gonna try to
[1:58:24] say he's Jesus but don't you believe it
[1:58:25] he's not Jesus Christ he's not the Son
[1:58:27] of God so see the seven church a
[1:58:30] messenger just like the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th
[1:58:32] 5th 6th they're all men they're all men
[1:58:36] they're not an angel heavenly being
[1:58:37] they're not Jesus Christ and they got to
[1:58:40] say they'll say that the Lord a lot it's
[1:58:41] got to be accurate that only leaves one
[1:58:42] person left
[1:58:44] William Aaron Branham and he's
[1:58:48] Ardi in the land in 1965 but now
[1:58:50] according to the time where we stand the
[1:58:52] latest in age the prophet messenger of
[1:58:54] revelation 10 7 must already be in the
[1:58:57] land amen and once more with thus saith
[1:59:00] the Lord must be here ready to be
[1:59:01] manifested with infallible vindication
[1:59:04] thus is the true seed already maturing
[1:59:07] and then the harvest
[1:59:10] now here's another quote that was share
[1:59:13] with me and they say oh this is the
[1:59:15] ministry of them this is the quote that
[1:59:16] says there's another messenger to rise
[1:59:18] they look at it it may be my going home
[1:59:21] time this is right before he had the
[1:59:23] vision of the seven angels in 63 it
[1:59:26] looks very much that way if it is if
[1:59:28] it's what is going home time there will
[1:59:31] rise somebody after me that'll take the
[1:59:33] message on he'll be an odd person and
[1:59:36] I've seen the Jeffersonville people use
[1:59:39] this to say it's Joseph Branham I've
[1:59:40] seen it they got it right online I'll
[1:59:43] show you to you on the YouTube if you
[1:59:44] want but he'll rise after this and take
[1:59:47] the message on and you listen to it as
[1:59:49] long as it's scripture stay with it oh
[1:59:51] but they didn't read beforehand the
[1:59:59] paragraph before tells us what brother
[2:00:03] man's talking about look at the words
[2:00:04] before you'll understand he's talking
[2:00:06] about his vision of the seven angels he
[2:00:10] said the exception the other day when I
[2:00:11] come westward you played the tape
[2:00:12] services then time many of you I guess
[2:00:14] and you understand I don't know what I'm
[2:00:16] waiting I'm here now I don't know why
[2:00:18] I'm just waiting because the visions
[2:00:19] that go west so the vision that seven
[2:00:23] angels did not mean is going home time
[2:00:25] and met a further work the third pole it
[2:00:29] didn't mean is going home time it meant
[2:00:31] a further miss work so we do not look
[2:00:34] for anyone to rise because the seven
[2:00:36] angels vision wasn't his going home time
[2:00:39] because he says if it is my going home
[2:00:42] time somebody else will rise but 1963
[2:00:44] wasn't he had two more years to preach
[2:00:46] the word and he says it plainly in the
[2:00:50] seventh seal if they just keep listening
[2:00:52] Amen just keep reading the message they
[2:00:55] say they believe and he says it he said
[2:00:57] here's the quote from the seventh seal
[2:00:59] about the vision meeting of further work
[2:01:01] the third
[2:01:01] all jumping the mountain really early
[2:01:03] before day this little food trail I
[2:01:05] turned and went to some great jagged
[2:01:07] rocks oh my I knelt down between the
[2:01:09] rocks I laid this Bible down it's the
[2:01:10] Lord God what is this vision means he
[2:01:12] said what is these 7 angels mean nor
[2:01:14] does it mean by dying you remember I
[2:01:16] told you I thought it might mean me to
[2:01:17] my death I'm skipping down I thought it
[2:01:21] could mean my death and then in the room
[2:01:23] what was the Lord what does it mean does
[2:01:25] it mean I'm going to die if it is all
[2:01:26] right I won't tell my family just go on
[2:01:28] if if my works finished and I said now
[2:01:30] what was it but he sent me a witness
[2:01:33] back you remember telling me that it
[2:01:35] wasn't that it was a further of my work
[2:01:38] hey man that quote is not saying someone
[2:01:42] else is going to rise because the
[2:01:43] seventh angel vision wasn't about his
[2:01:45] death it was about more work for Christ
[2:01:48] it's exactly right and the sword of the
[2:01:52] king represented the third Pole
[2:01:53] something hit my hands and don't fear
[2:01:55] it's that third Pole it didn't mean his
[2:01:57] death the seven angels nted it further
[2:01:59] work so we're not expecting anyone to
[2:02:02] rise because that's not what I meant
[2:02:09] now here's another quote they say means
[2:02:12] that brother Rams not the seven church
[2:02:14] age messenger anointing ones the endtime
[2:02:16] I wasn't the one that appeared down the
[2:02:18] river I was only standing there when he
[2:02:19] appeared I'm not the one that performs
[2:02:21] these things it foretells these things
[2:02:23] that happens as perfectly as they are
[2:02:25] now this is all true this is all true my
[2:02:27] man's not making any mistakes here
[2:02:28] I'm the only one that's near when he
[2:02:30] does it yeah I was only a voice that he
[2:02:33] used to say it it wasn't what I knew
[2:02:35] it's what I just surrendered myself to
[2:02:37] that he spoke through it isn't me it
[2:02:40] wasn't the seventh angel there it looks
[2:02:42] like he says he is the seventh angel I
[2:02:45] don't know about you Church but it looks
[2:02:47] like God arey says it wasn't me the
[2:02:49] seventh angel he said oh no it was the
[2:02:53] manifestation of the son of man in other
[2:02:57] words the seventh angel was a prophet
[2:02:59] that's what it means because he had to
[2:03:01] finish the mystery of God amen it wasn't
[2:03:05] the angel it was his message it wasn't
[2:03:08] the ministry that got him folded I'm
[2:03:10] sorry it was the mystery God unfolded
[2:03:11] it's not the man it's God
[2:03:15] the angel was not the son of man si si
[2:03:18] program was not the son of man he was
[2:03:20] the messenger from the son of man the
[2:03:23] son of man is Christ he's the one that
[2:03:25] you're feeding on hallelujah praise God
[2:03:28] but see they make they feed on brother
[2:03:29] Ram see because they take quotes that he
[2:03:31] says that aren't they're not prophecy
[2:03:33] and they live on them instead of living
[2:03:35] on the Word of God see he's the one
[2:03:41] you're feeding on you're not feeding on
[2:03:42] a man a man his words will fail but
[2:03:46] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[2:03:48] Word of the Son of Man so again they
[2:03:52] fail to read before the quote look
[2:03:54] earlier in the quote brother Branham
[2:03:56] says revelation 10 7 read it when you
[2:03:58] get home the seventh angels message
[2:03:59] opening up the seals what is it not the
[2:04:01] angel is the son of man but the
[2:04:03] messenger is revealing the son of man
[2:04:08] can you get it separated now let's say
[2:04:11] into our feet thank God you can get it
[2:04:14] separated now a lot of people can't they
[2:04:17] make brother branham either Jesus or
[2:04:20] something else they make every word he
[2:04:23] said thus saith the Lord they can't
[2:04:24] separate a man from Christ that's where
[2:04:29] it seems so hard for you you see and
[2:04:31] he's in jeffersonville he's preaching in
[2:04:34] jeffersonville it's so hard for them see
[2:04:36] because they're in the country of the
[2:04:37] prophets now the son of man himself but
[2:04:39] the seventh angel the seventh messenger
[2:04:42] is revealing to the public the Son of
[2:04:44] Man in other words brother Adam was
[2:04:47] showing a prophetic ministry it was a
[2:04:49] gift from Jesus Christ it was Jesus
[2:04:51] Christ prophetic ministry in a man
[2:04:57] because it's left the shuk is left the
[2:04:59] denominations he can't organize it as
[2:05:00] the grain itself I'm sorry okay cut the
[2:05:04] livestream god bless live streamers
[2:05:06] loving the Lord and may God richly bless
[2:05:08] you let me close here with a few more
[2:05:10] things
