========================================

prayer and psalms to lift our spirits and souls that's exactly what god told us to do by the grace of the lord amen i think i left my bible back there dude can you look in my bible my old scorpio appreciate that i uh let's read for our text matthew chapter three i want to try to finish uh this series on the godhead i started a while back and i'll show you in a moment it's not that i'm sure on things to preach there is so much to preach i always feel overwhelmed i got i'll show you the list of all the things i want to preach there's there's just i just feel like i got to finish them at some point i don't know what i'm finishing i'm going to try to finish it so matthew chapter 3 verse 13. you know simon comes first beautiful message now that one makes me want to preach on some of those topics you know how this is done you've been around a long time hallelujah i feel like i can only scratch the surface you know god for his grace and mercy matthew chapter 3 verse 13 like to look at the mystery of the godhead part 6 tonight praise god i'm going to try to preach 45 minutes lord willing god's grace we'll see how that goes trust the lord will bless each one and speak to us this is a very important topic church don't ever think you know that this would be a time to go to sleep and time to go to sleep you know in my own human thinking we would think well i believe god's one person but there's so much implication to this subject as far as with the squeeze as far as with the tribulations that's why we can't fall asleep during a sermon like this okay so i know it's not the most maybe shouting service but i just want to tell you ahead of time there's major implications with the trinity uh dogma that the catholic church is going to try to push on everybody so that's kind of where we'll go and with that thought but let's try to get through this chapter here like i said i wrote it a number of years ago now a couple two two two years ago by god's grace but matthew chapter 3 verse 13. i'll read 13-16 and then we'll all join our voices for 17. then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him but john forbade him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and cometh thou to me and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness so even christ our lord had to fulfill all the righteous commands god had in store for him how much more us to fulfill all right see the reason you're still alive is because there's more things you have to fulfill amen when god's done with you he pulls your card the angels come pack you to the next dimension praise god you've got angel pallbearers but until that time there's righteous things for you to fulfill then he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went up straight away out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him look at verse 17 let's read that together one two three and lo a voice from heaven said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased may god add his blessings to rhema's word and maybe see that god bless you appreciate all the saints be in the house of lord tonight appreciate your faithfulness there's nowhere else i'd rather be than in the house of the lord with the saints of god hallelujah i truly mean that that is the joy in my heart praise god to come to church and see all your smiling faces and worship with you and love god and trust god for all things praise god so here if you switch over just for a moment then i won't have slides for all these but like i said i have many many subjects i'd like to i need to finish first i have at least five series i need to finish okay and then uh here's here's the first five i got god had to finish i got the tabernacle there's a i wanna i wanna break down with the tabernacle the high priest i wanna show the day of atonement with the high priest because that all types jesus christ amen there i have a whole i found a webpage on it i'm like oh my goodness look at all this so i'd like to preach that i got another one i forgot to put on here paul the tent maker i forgot about that one i want to show you all paul's jobs so i forgot to put that around here maybe i can put on there right now but uh i wanted to finish the book of colossians i think i'm only three services into that one okay and then i want to finish the money series i have a couple more bible studies to do on that one and i have one at least one mighty man series left as far as what scriptures that we can quote and believe on uh and then the ones review uh you know it was expressed by amen and who and brother uh austin yo you're good to go over the book of revelation and review the seven seals the deeds of nicolaitans i never preached that seven church ages chapter out of the book it's a it's just a slightly different approach than the church age book so i feel like it would help you uh if i preached on that a lot i put up i put more history in there than what the church hate had i shouldn't say more i put additional history into that chapter from church history than the church age book even has so it's loaded with that i like to preach on revival and miracles uh there's a time and season for that and i'd like to see some more miracles by god's grace we gotta hear the word of god many times to inspire us for those type of things i like to look at slavery in the bible i have notes on that i just haven't finished that uh nature where's nature she requested brother graham's life story so at some point i'd like to show the scriptures and just hit some highlights of his whole life i would never have time to preach his whole life um but maybe hit the highlights and show how in his childhood he was like joe because he's heard from the whirlwind okay and then he was given two signs like moses okay and then he became elijah and he also is our eliezer i mean it's just it's unbelievable you can tie all the quotes you know all the different quotes from brother branham and uh you can tie that all in together and then you know brother jose bought me this book called generations and it has i would say 20 or 30 eyewitness testimonies of brother graham's ministry that you hear on tape and you get you get to hear them testify about what god did through brother branham in their lives and it's beautiful you can go back and listen to it on tape i've done that a couple of times i'm like oh this is beautiful the person that brother way was raised from the dead his testimony is in there his wife's testimonies in there you know billy paul course i differ with him on his teachings you know uh but he saw numerous miracles so like i said this is just a few of them i tried to get them on there so you'd see a it's not that i'm like lacking things to preach it's like which one do i do you know i want to be faithful but just real quick before i turn this off you know this was when we looked at you know the but we looked at some of the parts of the trinity this is the shield of the trinity remember i'll show you this it's in the book the main lie here is that the father is not the holy spirit that's the main lie because the holy ghost is the father the father is holy father's spirit jesus said that's the main lie and because of that contradiction this this this creed easily falls apart right and never really trinitarians will never say they'll never say they believe in three gods but that's what they're that's what they actually teach okay because just like you know satan will never come out and say well i'm the devil you know you know he always hides behind a lie the bible calls it uh uh guys he hides behind a a mask you know he's hiding but tritheism is the doctrine of the fathers and the holy spirit are three distinct gods that's actually what the trinity explains or reveals through its false doctrine but they'll never admit it right but they are try theistic in their definition okay and we'll get to some of those here in the next few services okay um so eventually we'll get to this this is what i want to end with that's why i set my timer for 45 minutes okay so okay now you can you can close okay so let's look at jesus baptism we'll try to get through understanding jesus baptism tonight if i can get through that i think i'll be happier i've got like four pages on this in my book so it's an important subject here by the grace of god all right how many of the lord tonight that's the kind of let's refresh right that's the kind of word you're saying but we refresh on that one i'm going to turn the corner here now so does jesus baptism prove god is three persons the answer is no if it did it would prove trifius the belief in three distinct gods because why does one eternal person need to come and fall upon another eternal person that makes no sense if each one is co-eternal why would one that's already eternal need another eternal one to anoint them it makes no sense it's completely contradictory but jesus baptism shows god's power to man manifest himself simultaneously in three ways that's right okay just like you did in the old testament okay he did it many times but one example is the burning bush from exodus chapter three verses one through six moses witnessed god manifest himself in two separate ways at least actually three you know i think about it voice and fire right voice and fire and you could say yeah voice and fire for sure voice and fire now some people might see two persons in that bush right the father was the voice and the holy ghost was the fire okay but that's not true because the fire that fell on pentecost was on 120 foreheads and it wasn't 120 different people it was one it was one person uh dividing himself 120 different ways praise god that's right so just because we have a voice and just because we have fire doesn't mean two persons right just like we don't have 120 persons on the day of pentecost nothing in exodus speaks of multiple personalities the voice and the fire we're not showing two separate persons but they reveal god's power to show himself in different forms at the same time now hold up case if you would first timothy 6 16. can you pull that up there i'm going to put you on the spot a little bit here remember acts chapter 2 uh says that uh pillar or i'm sorry licks of fire appeared over every one of them praise god in church isn't it a blessing to know that that fire is in your soul praise god amen whether somebody saw it on my forehead or not i know that fire is in my soul because god's spirit is a consuming fire amen it's consumed all the sin desires in my heart praise god now say it like this it's continually consuming my sinful desires because every day i die and the fire of god consumes those fires every single day praise god amen hallelujah so when moses saw the fire god was inside the fire who had who only had immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto so think about that god was in the light after burning bush god was in the light at jesus baptism and god was in every one of those 120 licks of light and the church said amen god hides himself in life amen amen hallelujah he's actually hiding in the light praise god the light is his mask the light is his manifestation now when jesus baptized some people three or see three persons father is the voice sun in the water holy ghost is the dove the true understanding is that god spoke from heaven was his own spirit not a third person descended like a dove upon the man christ jesus okay so we can see that quite plainly now some people say the voice came out of the dove i think there's a quote that says that and other quotes say the voice came from heaven it doesn't really matter right because it still doesn't make three persons or two persons or more persons or ten persons it doesn't make any of that it just shows how god can manifest himself in as many ways as he wants at the same time so this shows one invisible person anointing his visible human image or his visible human tabernacle praise god or his own tent it's god anointing his own tent or his own temple right so one one person is anointing one invisible person is inhabiting the visible image praise god it's like a hand filling a glove that hand comes down to fill the glove praise god right so once inside the glove the hand doesn't become a second distinct hand right it's the same hand belt behind a glove right just like and like a glove jesus body is the image god's person dwells within jesus is not a second person but he's the visible image of god's one person so there's three amazing errors in jesus baptism first it's an heir to say a co-equal son was anointed by the co-equal holy spirit right that's the first heir so why do trinitarians teach that the son needs a third person to anoint him right if he's already fully eternally god why would he need that it makes no sense it's a complete contradiction when you're eternal you don't need anybody's help amen when you're all powerful you don't need anybody to come anoint you because you are the anointed one amen you're anointed with eternal qualities already praise god hallelujah because so the trinity one god needs anointed by another god but the truth is jesus human body was powerless in john 5 19. he said verily verily truly truly i say to you the son can do nothing of himself but what do you see the father do that'll encourage us if jesus always got to do is see the father do it that's all we got to do we just got to see god leading us to do something praise god that's why we can pull so much strength from the body of jesus christ yes he didn't have a sin nature we understand that but he also overcame every temptation praise god amen and if he can do it by the spirit of god we can do it and if he saw god do things then we can see god do things amen and jesus said john 14 10 the father that dwells in me he do with the works well then why did he need the spirit of god to come why didn't he the third person if the first person was already in him doing the works right but if you put up acts 10 48 the bible said jesus was anointed i'm sorry acts 10 38 acts 10 38 jesus was anointed with the holy ghost to do signs and wonders and miracles right with power well i thought the father gave him power so he was he was such a lesser eternal person that he needed the father and the holy spirit to give him power does that make any sense it makes no sense praise god that's the first lie jesus body was powerless jesus body was not all powerful jesus christ did not know all things in his human body he didn't know the rapture that's right he didn't know the woman that would touch him right he didn't know those things so god had to make them known to him hallelujah and when he even when it was made known he lifted up his eyes to heaven and he prayed and he thanked the father that god hid these things from the eyes of the wise and rebuked on the babies amen amen oh we don't do the same truth when god anoints us to see things other people can't see we all say thank god lord hear some gratitude that you've opened my eyes amen glory second here's another closely related problem jesus was filled with the third person and his baptism but the doctor never explains when did the first person come in here so see that's a failure of the doctrine they know he's the second person in the water but they don't know they never say when the first person came in here if the first person's in him why's he got to pray for the first person why he's got to pray to the first person right it doesn't make any sense so it's a doctrine that's not fully understood praise god there's not all the answers are given but see all of our answers argue there's one person that person is invisible right and he comes and makes that temple live he puts life he is life amen god is life god is love amen god is life amen and god makes the temple live hallelujah just like god makes you live amen amen but jesus was different his whole nature his human nature was word nature it was holy nature right his first inclination was to obey the word our first inclination is to sin amen and so we've got to overcome that we've got to build up our our strength build up our power through prayer the bible says building up our most holy faith praying in the holy spirit so when the temptation comes we're already strong enough we already know we're going to overcome that praise god hallelujah see when we when we know a temptation is coming on and we feel like we're not powerful enough that's what we got to pray see we've got to be ready we got to be ready for the test ready for the trials and we get that through fellowship with god through communion with god we've got to be ready for it now put isaiah 42 verse 1. hopefully this is the right verse behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom i sow the lion i have put my spirit upon him now look who's this talking this is god talking who's he talking about his son he didn't say i'm going to put a third spirit on him he said i'm going to put my spirit on it see i'm putting my spirit upon my servant not a second spear or a third spirit but my spirit the father put his own spirit on the sun hallelujah that's beautiful so now there's two problems here's the third problem the trinitarianism implies jesus had two separate distinct persons living inside him but the bible never says two persons drawn in him uh john 14 10 says the father the dwell in me who do he do with the works and the holy ghost won't hit him according to luke 4 verse 1. jesus the bible said jesus was filled with the holy ghost and with power hallelujah if the trinity is true then two separate distinct persons dwell in one eternal person but the truth is the father and holy ghost are the same person and jesus did not suffer with the d.i.d multiple personalities disorder right people have that disorder it's called d.i.d multiple personalities they got this personality they got that personality now church there is some truth to that right there's some truth to that in other words we have two natures that's what i mean we have a multiple nature's disorder right there amen paul said amen we just read it paul said the things that i want to do i don't do i hate what i do praise god so we got multiple nature disorder sometimes i do what's right sometimes i do what i hate but i love what he says but it's not me that does the sin it's sin that dwells within me praise god that's a tribute our sin to the right thing it's a sin nature it's not the soul that's inside of us that's a gift from god that's a seed from god that's a part of god that's god's dna praise god amen dna doesn't sin amen god's dna gives you gives you life praise god and god's dna cannot sin so you yourself and your soul and your real nature cannot sin amen i put on that video this week about lukewarm you're luke you're you're your soul is never lukewarm i got some good comments on it there's just a couple but they're like wow this is a mighty revelation i felt that i thought it was too because after simon preach that i was walking right here to the pulpit as i'm walking to the public right about here i felt like something struck me maybe you saw maybe i went like this or maybe i jumped i don't know what happened but i won't as i was coming i was like that's right my soul cannot sin my soul will never be lukewarm glory enough people around the so you and i will never be in that lukewarm state so we don't have to worry about it amen now we we have to approach our salvation with fear and traveling praise god we have to do that but we don't have to worry like oh i'm going to be lukewarm one day or i'm going to be clothed in warm days if god ever puts a fire in your soul that fire will never stop burning amen it's an eternal fire it will consume your life amen it will consume your soul praise god amen so even in your worst moments like brother i'm wearing shorts or brother am lying to the irs even your worst moments that holy fire glory will connect your mind and then convict your body and bring both of those channels into subjection in the word of god amen thank god thank you jesus got that multiple nature disorders i think i just made a new medical term i better patent that make that money oh actually there's a fourth one some believe the holy ghost is sending like a dove upon jesus body that he exists as a eternally visible dove well of course in the book of revelation it never mentions a dove roosting in heaven okay so that's just another mistake a lot of their paintings have old man father young man jesus dove in heaven you never see a dove in heaven praise god i'm not saying there isn't if there's horses in heaven there's probably another heaven if prince is up in heaven and what's the other prince what's the dog fritz yeah if if prince and friends are up there in the sixth dimension i'm sure there's some nubs up there but the holy ghost does not exist as an eternally separate dove from god the father you won't find that in the bible now we get a couple of important points there's two meanings for jesus words fulfill all righteousness first he was setting the example of obedience for all of us that's right if jesus christ the perfect man was baptized each one of us ought to run to the waters because we're the ones that actually need it praise god and he led the example he didn't even need to as far as being baptized represent he had to die to his sin he had already overcome sin praise god he was going to continue overcoming sin but he did it as an example for you and i in other words if jesus did something god help us to model that and do that as well praise god amen amen i'm going to schedule a uh a communion here pretty soon not this sunday but the following sunday night we'll do community by god's grace so i like simon's message on communion i thought well that's a good time to do it by god's grace let's uh let's read renew our communion by the grace of the lord so in tucson i'll try to text everybody about that i text all those dates so uh everybody should have those by the grace of the lord now repentance is what's required before you're baptized but jesus did not need to repent it was only an example but he did need to be filled with the holy ghost amen so that was a good example for him he didn't have to repent but he went down there anyway so one example was uh it was an example be baptized and you shall i mean let's all say shout ready you shall receive the gifts of the holy ghost how do you believe that i promise but austin you believe i promise hallelujah amen assistant you read that promise you shall if you repent and if you get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ jesus christ is going to send this spirit like a dove into your soul praise god amen amen it's a promise of god amen amen and all those sincere souls will receive it amen what does it take just a little more dying out praise god and trust me it takes a lot of dying out it takes a lot of humility to receive the holy ghost that's right you got to be a brother says when you fully surrender he'll come in fully so it's each day each week each month each service we're learning to surrender more and more [Music] right because we've all seen people that could try to surrender for all these decades but then when it comes down to a test they got offended by the message and they need the message right oh my family won't join me i need a girlfriend i need a boyfriend they lead they got offended see they weren't growing they weren't willing to surrender at all may god help us to surrender everything amen amen prove that you're a child of god right that's what the bible says make your calling election sure so he did need to receive the holy spirit so he set that example for us praise god he left jordan full of the holy ghost led by the spirit into the wilderness like we saw with our sister's testimony a couple weeks ago got the holy ghost and instantly into a wilderness sometimes our life is like that we get the holy ghost and then satan's going to test us to see if we really got it right oh but don't worry the holy ghost always stands at the test amen the hunter will never fail a test hallelujah amen was given the spirit though without measure the bible says in other words he has access to every power of god but he always yielded to god's will instead of his own remember he said i could have caught 12 legions of angels he said he could have done it right now we don't have all the measure of the holy spirit so we couldn't do that we can call on god for our request no doubt we can call on god we have those powers and authorities by god's word but it has to be led of the holy spirit amen right god my wife sent me that quote you know um uh yeah it was a quote on saturday my wife sent me that quote brother rand prayed for that dead baby in mexico and amy and i were talking about this and that baby after a whole day was brought back to life his brother saw the vision of it not long after that that family from germany the stud staff cliffs uh stag cliff they lost their baby and the the man was in the military and he could have access he would he but he had a ticket for brother branham he was going to fly the german plane over get brother and come to lay his hands on the baby over in germany but brotherham said let me pray about it first now he just had a baby come back from the dead right you would think his faith would have been what mountain mountains have faith but he said let me pray about it first and he prayed about it for two days with the holy spirit saying no this is the hand of the lord so he said he sent the message back no it's god's will to take that child and then she called her brother and said what we didn't have enough faith he said no the fact you had the plane ready and the the fact you called me show you had great faith but it was the hand of god he said find that clear-cut decision amen see before before we make a boast or before we make a before we just speak something let's get god's decision on something first thing amen that's maturity yeah right that's real maturity that's what the man said i appreciate you brother for getting a clear-cut decision from god that's right before you said oh yeah i'll fly over and raise the baby up that's a serious thing to do so it's a mighty thing to do remember jesus personally verified he received the holy ghost it was in uh matthew 20 verse 22. he said he said you will be baptized with the baptism that i'm baptized with and he just wasn't talking water because jesus didn't get baptized in his own name right he didn't need to get baptized in his own name he just was baptized by john so that's the first example now notice jesus said it becomes made up of all righteous i'm setting the example church the example always is the anointing comes after washing all right amen elijah said pour three barrels of water on here praise god anoint this with water everybody's like you're going to waste all the water on that he said don't worry i've already seen it praise god i've already seen this showdown before and i know it's going to happen that way i can stand i got thus saith the lord i got a clear-cut decision from god amen amen let's anoint this sacrifice with water and then the fire is gonna fall praise god oh that's what happened at jesus baptism he had to be washed first and then the fire fell hallelujah that's what they did in the days of moses at the end of exodus right exodus 40. they had to wash the priests they had to sanctify the tabernacle i don't think i got to this one but they go through all these rituals they wash everything they anoint everything and then aaron and moses think they're mad they might go in and minister but god interrupts and says everything's in order everything's washed everything's clean now i'm coming down i'm gonna fill the temple so that no american glory in this this is the work of god cleansing comes first and then comes the anointing of the holy spirit amen hallelujah same thing happened when jesus was baptized he had to be washed first and then filled with the holy ghost oh lord wash me praise i like what peter said that wash not just my feet but my head also that ought to be our prayer tonight wash all of me praise god wash every part of my life so that your anointing can be on me praise god how many want that by god's grace amen amen amen good 20 minutes in by gosh 25 all right now the second reason he had to be baptized was because uh the bible says offerings the sacrifices always had to be washed before they were offered that's leviticus chapter one verses one through nine we're not going to read it but to have a burnt offering in the old testament the sacrifice had been washed first then cut then presented and then it was accepted so jesus got baptized of course three and a half years before he was offered right because once he was anointed he had three half years of ministry from 30 to 33. praise god when he was 30 years old to 33 years old and the bible said burnt offerings were a sweet savor unto the lord in other words when god gets everything when god gets off of our lives it's a sweet savor unto the lord amen hallelujah that's exactly right and then paul said though paul said in ephesians 5 verse 2 that jesus has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor hallelujah so had to be washed and then he was cut praise god then he was cut by the cat and nine tails the bible jesus like david said my bones stare at me jesus saw his bone stare because imagine his ribs as a man his bones were staring at him he was looking down at his bones so so incredibly ripped apart didn't even look like a man what would it take to be like that it'd be awful but he this was him this was jesus i'm giving myself as a burnt offering i'm giving god everything my body my mind my soul the bible said his soul was an offering for sin and then when he was offered god smelled the aroma that's holiness that sweet divine device to my nostrils amen someone who gives i imagine the same thing happened when paul was crucified paul was martyred amen or peter was crucified upside down that complete sacrifice that complete dedication god smelled it and it was well pleasing in his nostrils that's a lie that's worthy of the gospel hallelujah may god help us to sacrifice all of our lives right now it's not physical sacrifice it's spiritual sacrifice we've got to cut off anything that doesn't please god and that's a sweet smell in the in those nostrils of the lord absolutely absolutely can the rich man get to heaven absolutely abraham got to heaven right job got to heaven amen can the rich later sin get to heaven yes because we're rich in christ that's the main thing we're writing rich in christ hallelujah amen of course americans are more richer than any other country so we're not rich naturally as well we got everything we need but just like abraham and just like job we can be rich naturally and rich spiritually but we must be totally generous praise god we must be ready to do good works how do you believe that amen if you like going on that money channel i'm saying that for later praise god all right hallelujah that's what we need church we need god we need god to lord over our finances and make our entire life a sweet smelly savior unto him amen he he sees our giving he sees our our love he sees our cheerful givers not grudging givers well okay since brother jesse preached on it here's my last 20. i hear that i'll finally give her it since i've been preached on it no matter who preached on it not a grudging giver but god loves a cheerful giver and just getting some good prayer then you'll start feeling cheerful praise god that's really all we need we're getting into a good service say a hearty amen you'll start feeling good about giving again hallelujah now i got uh 15 minutes here before i want to kind of bring it down to close here so let's look at jesus prayer regarding the 74 luke 22 42 luke 22 42. do uh so this is where trinitarians would say jesus prayers in the garden prove he was three persons right but to us although we pray his prayers reveal his full humanity and help prove god's one personality and this proves god is not a trinity because one co-equal person does not need to pray to anyone else for any advice or any help because he's already eternal he already has everything that he needs he's already co-he's co-eternal co-equal co-powerful co-everything that's that's what their creed says okay so let's read that saying father if thou be willing remove this cup for me nevertheless not my will but thine be done okay so three persons is always equal to polytheism or more than one god multiple gods so jesus prayer shows he's 100 human and 100 deity yet it doesn't equal two to two gods it doesn't equal two persons now the human part had a separate will than the eternal father because that's what he says not my will but thine to be done jesus flesh although sinless did not want to die but he had to get it to surrender to the will of god now if he had to pray to surrender to that what do we have to pray to surrender to our tribes in church we don't have to we don't we don't have to surrender to death necessarily right or persecution we don't have to surrender to that we just have to surrender to not partaking in lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life how much more should we pray right or just be willing to pray like i said i love that what simon showed there the reason that god uh was upset with david he didn't consult god he showed another one who else did he say so he showed somebody didn't consult god do you guys remember josh that's right amen that's right so you're my second member i told you that amen that's what i was thinking about joshua uh and david didn't consult god and they got in trouble see we're gonna get in trouble if we don't consult god now i'm gonna point to some people over here i'm not gonna i'm not gonna point them out too much but i'm gonna point it they got some big consulting to do right or relationships right i'll point some singers like relationships you know you guys got some big decisions coming up i i'm just gonna say this i know i'm gonna see you praying more about god's grace remember our sister's testimony you have to pray before getting married pray before going over to us pray sincerely fast before i before i was called to preach brother i fasted two days faster this is not something you just jump into you gotta know god's behind it and god will show you brother i said just ask him in some way or another he'll speak to you he'll show you his will and if you really don't want to get out of step with god's will he won't let you get out amen because you're surrendered to him does not god honor the integrity of hearts if he'd honor king abimelech's desire not to sin against god don't you think he'd honor your request amen [Music] well you must have known god somehow i don't know i'm not sure how much of he that he was out to back up on that one he knew god's voice that's for sure god talked to him he didn't want to sin against god jesus flesh did not want to die but it surrendered see that humanity needed god's deity he wasn't co-equal a co-equal person the humanity needed the deity the tabernacle needed the glory the tent needed the anointing right the tabernacle needed the fire amen hallelujah praise god see that's the difference between us and jesus he had a word nature we have a sin nature right and jesus was in uh theophany first right he went from thought theophany flesh glorified body that's what broadband talks about and who's this melchizedek we know there's no pre-existence of our souls amen we went from thought to the soul coming down to our mother's womb praise god thought to to to whom and then one day by god's grace of god jerry said we'll get that theophany up in heaven if not we'll get the theophany when we go in the rapture and get the glorified body as well i don't know i think the order actually is on the rapture we get the glorified body first uh that life swallows up death and then we go up to meet the theophany at the rapture if i'm not mistaken brother and i can be wrong that's a minor it's not really like a major thing like you got to know this to be saved hallelujah thank god amen so the two wheels in the garden make two equal persons no it just shows how jesus body was a one of a kind a one and done manifestation for god to dwell in there's never been a body like jesus there will never be another body like jesus he's the one of a kind of god it's a manifestation praise god that body was a manifestation of god was not a separate person it was a house for god to dwell in amen like i said i'm gonna keep saying it to austin memorize it malachi and all these you know for any of you i believe everything the bible says about the god amen and trinitarians can't say that they can't say that because of all those contradictions i just showed right there they can't say that they do not believe everything the bible says but we believe everything the bible says they've got to add words to the bible like they have a greater revelation than paul or peter or james or john the guys that wrote the new testament they don't have nothing compared to those guys hallelujah we've got the revelation what they wrote about god was manifest in the flesh not a second person god was manifest god one person was manifest in the flesh praise god but because it was a one-of-a-kind manifestation it needed a separate pronoun because a pronoun is a thing person place what does it say animal or thing so the body of jesus was a thing praise god or you can say it was the first it was god it was the visible image of god's person you could say but it wasn't a second person because that would be uh that would be uh trithyism because then you have a third person in heaven that'd be three separate gods of course not god's eternal spirit could never die so he needed a tabernacle or a person or a human that would die hallelujah he didn't become a second person it was the same person in another mask amen that's right god in the human form manifest in the flesh the word became flesh god became flesh the father and the son were one in nature the word but with different characteristics the father was eternal but the son had a beginning praise god the son was humanity the son had father and mother praise god but jesus had but god had no father and mother amen amen so i'm gonna just go ahead and close okay we'll go ahead and close we gotta have times in seasons church where i don't preach till 9 30 you know there's got to be a variety of services okay so just bear with me now why is this so important again getting this now to something thank god nobody fell asleep uh that unless a little ones fell asleep but that's okay i want them to sleep if they need sleep they need to do that but why is this so important so important because remember i read this a few months ago brother graham says about the mark of the beast you'll not be able to buy or sell you'll be at the mercy you cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast or in the hand or the head this mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine see what doctor's important of the world church which is trinitarianism and the mark of the hand which means through the will of the world church with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride it's either gonna take their doctrine okay i believe it i believe or take or follow their rules do their works okay i'll keep the church open but i'm not going to preach about water baptism i can speak about women creatures or whatever now i've been this i like i like youtube preachers especially the ones that point to the bible you know but i listened to a trinitarian he was saying are we wrong about the journey because i thought i was going to preach this today so i was listening you know while driving and he said i would die for the trinity i thought oh my goodness it just goes to show how much of a ingrained deception this is it's so ingrained into them i don't even know why i i can't understand honestly i really can't understand because it's not even the earlier it's not even in the bible the word trinity is not in the bible the definition is not even in the bible praise god but he said i'd be willing to die for this at church the opposite was true they were willing to kill for in the dark ages yeah right and they're going to be willing to kill for it again that's what's coming that's what it's going to come they're down to be willing to kill anyone who doesn't accept the trinity dogma that's why it's so important right because right now they're saying i die for it uh those guys that left the message they call me straight out a heretic right on their podcast or public on their youtube channel i'm a heritage because i don't accept three persons and my question is where is three persons in the bible i'm still waiting i'll be checking my email i'll be i'll be refreshing that email wait where's that verse it says three persons i'll be refreshing it all day i'll refresh it till my fingerprint wears off then gonna find one because god don't want to be known that way god wants to know i'm i'm the lord thy god and him only praise god hear o israel the lord our god is one lord amen but that's why this is so important because one day we may have to take a squeeze for it i'm going to leave this open too one day we may have to give our lives forward because there may be some people that die for it because there's people in nigeria there's christians there's denominational christians dying today in nigeria catholics anglicans lutherans are dying for the sake of christ today in nigeria yeah it's all over i mean you can look it up on the news look up on the internet look up nigeria christians persecution they've been persecuted for years it's probably the most dangerous place in the world to live right now as a christian so let's not leave it out let's not leave it out does it look like it's going to happen right now pretty soon i don't think so we have to see the laws change first the brotherhood told us the laws have to change first when the church and state unite they'll change laws yeah that's what the bible says about the antichrist right they'll change times and seasons and laws you see we they're willing to die for it but actually they're willing to kill for it is what it's going to come down to they're going to be willing to kill for this remember this one uh the image so the beast the roman catholic and roman catholic church and state united states united will keep we'll try to keep the true bride from preaching and teaching her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb remember church this is thus saith the lord so just gotta just got it mark it down we're coming into a religious persecution with the same things that they did in pagan rome many years ago for its thus saved the lord now what is it setting up on a beast of power the same persecutions from rome are coming to the united states you can see it slowly building up right i showed it to you uh remember after january 6 2001 so some of those cops had a meet uh had a press conference a few weeks later and they said all the evil people were the people that said trump is my is this an evil evangelical christians i said trump is my president jesus is my god and they put all the blame for that on conservatives when yet it was a democrat was the one who shot a republican the only person that died that day was a a republican that was shot by a democratic cop is that right yeah and they're putting all the blame on christians conservative christians right that's what they're all see it's a hatred that's going to come down on us but one thing that's going to be different about it it's going to be religious and it's going to exalt the trinity because that's paganism that's a polytheistic spirit that's the spirit of idolatry praise god more than one god now remember church what have they done when they change it to fathers and holy ghosts instead of lord jesus christ and with all the godhead and all the things i went to uh i went to my friend's funeral i remember my funeral my friend died if you uh this summer my friend died he was a catholic uh he's the guy i talked to him the day before he died i told him god loves you because you've been a faithful father you're taking care of your six kids and god god loves a faithful father like that because he's a faithful father i went to his funeral and it was a catholic funeral and i don't know how many times the people did this i was only there for 30 minutes they must have did this like 50 maybe 100 times i'm not even joking i would never say that to joker it's so ingrained in them and then you got women there wearing short shorts and showing off their chests and and guys there just not just going through the motions there's just no real sincerity there's no real sincerity there isn't it's not a real life religion right i was thinking like lord give me some oh give me some of that old-time religion praise god i don't want this creed-based religion but when they do that they blasphemed the name of god because the philippians 2 says the name of all names is the name of jesus christ the bible says so the beast opened his mouth and blasphemed against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle on them that dwell in heaven they blasting the saints by praying to the saints and telling people to pray to the saints oh yeah in that in that service that 30-minute service i was sitting in they must have prayed to mary at least five or ten times o holy mother and whatever hail mary i just stopped counting after a while like this is just ridiculous praying to mary mary may you comfort this man as he comes in the presence of god like what's very where are you going to comfort anybody it's the holy spirit that's going to come for people it's god's spirit jesus is spirit thinking mary has some type of a work she can do to help a dead man get to heaven it's insanity now here's what simon was talking about and there's some truth to this i don't i don't have all the answers but somehow in the catholic church was found the blood of the prophets and of the saints and all that were slain upon the earth so somehow all the murders go back to the beast system it's hard to understand but it's true the bible says the blood of all the prophets of saints and all every murder look look at that every murder goes back to the catholic church because it's a cage of unclean and hateful birds so somehow i don't know how i looked up jesuits on monday before we end that fellowship you know there's my 45 minutes and it said you know the catholic church set up the jesuits and now they've moved into education as their biggest uh sphere of influence remember tim humes he was he was a message preacher uh jesuit tried to get into his church hung around for about a year and they're driving in the car one time and he said he said you know tim you've got to get that holy ghost shout out and scream you gotta get that out of the church and he said a voice come to him and said it's a jesuit this is when he was the message he said are you a jesuit and the jesus said stop the car let me out and then he stopped and he walked away so a jesuit came in and acted like he was a messenger believer for a year and then tried to become buddy buddy with the preacher so i gotta be real careful who my buddies are you know you you gotta be you [Applause] we all got to be careful that's why i want you to shout for jesus i want you to cry for jesus i want you to scream for jesus weep for jesus some of you need to jump for jesus amen jump as high as you can amen jump for jesus amen amen don't let anything hinder your praise he's through the evolution praise amen amen one time i saw my one time i saw my tongue speaking trinitarian uh somebody's a god pastor jumped like this and he was speaking in tongues i was like ah that'll do that to a 40 year old man hold on do it to me i'm 16 years old well makes you do the same thing amen praise makes you run around the church and makes me dance like a like a victory dad say man i'm not gonna say a pool makes me dance like a victory dance i might be a fool to the world but one thing's for sure you'll be a fool for somebody i'll be christ's fool later amen you always got liberty to worship christ here with the right spirit amen you know it's not when it's not the spirit they'll growl like an animal i've seen sisters do it i've seen brothers grow like animals you'll know when it's not god you'll know god will give you the wisdom one time the woman in the back she's in the back of this woman she was screaming and going like this everything was a move the holy spirit she was smacking her her sisters next to her like i seen him hit him on the base i'm like what and i didn't understand i was young in the faith but come out if i come to find out that woman was demon-possessed she was trying to distract from the holy ghost that was preaching to me to pull up people to pray for them and actually distracted actually hindered the service and later she had the devil on her and we cast it out later by god's grace and we're not mistaken i'm not mistaken it was one of them so i think we did five demon casts out in that that meeting see you'll know that's why god give you that spirit of discernment i started every song amen amen to know the difference but don't let anybody take away your love for god amen don't let the preacher don't let your mama your dad your brother sister don't let anybody take god loves spontaneous praise hey i amen god it's the judas that wants to shut it down so he must have been the first jesuit okay somehow the catholic church is behind all this money system somehow i don't know how we've got guesses right bankers and catholic bankers we've got some guesses somehow but we know for sure all the murders in the world are from that demonic spear the beast spirit remember it's the spirit that was on babylon it was the same spirit yeah same spirit that was on meats of persians same spirit that was on alexander the great the gracious same spirit that's on ancient pagan rome and now it's on pavel rome somehow i don't know somehow behind the scenes the pope's pulling strings i don't know people he says you don't want war but the bible says it's all from the pope it's all from the catholic church they apparently want the war in ukraine i don't know all i can tell you what the bible says i don't plan to have all the answers but i do claim to have the bible praise god i'll take the bible praise god amen see church the difference between us and the trinitarians we know him we know the one person of god that we don't know them that's right there's not them that we know we know one person amen god almighty the lord jesus christ amen i love these verses this is my chapter this morning i'm like oh this is the perfect right for the message i just messaged my chapter this morning paul said that i may know him who christ in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering see we all want the power but don't forget you got to suffer for jesus that's what goes along with it not just power for miracles but suffering goes along with it both if you want to know him you have to have his power but you also have to have his sufferings yeah thank god for the power but thank god for the sufferings too why because the sufferings make me conformable unto his death when i suffer i can relate to how jesus had to die in a little bit of a way and it helps remind me one of these days if jesus don't come back i'm gonna have to die i've got to meet him and i have to know what it's like to suffer so if i suffer like him i can reign with him if i suffer when she's like nobody else suffers like me don't feel bad the bible says there is somebody out there who suffers like you you're not alone right we all suffer there's no temptation except what's common unto man praise god first corinthians 1 13 in other words paul says let me suffer anyway by any means as long as i can make the rapture lord whatever you have to happen in my life let it happen that i might attain to the first resurrection i don't want to come up with a second i don't want to have christ say you know i don't have to see the saints up there or me not there i want to sit with christ i don't have to go through the the white throne judgment i don't want to be there i want to be on the throne i'm going to live through the millennium hallelujah i don't want to miss a thousand years with christ on the earth praise god help me to know him help me to know christ's power and his sufferings so i'll be ready for the rapture amen that's what this is saying lord whenever i have to suffer how about this boy this message believer just died at 20 years old 20 years old 20 years old by a drunk driver just like brother brown died from a drunk driver and now his parents what they're suffering but what is it why suffering to be made conformable unto his death to taste have a little taste of what christ had to suffer so that i can be ready whatever god allows and allows me to suffer i'll be ready for the first resurrection this whole chapter is powerful jeremy if you haven't read it in a while you've got some extra time you didn't read your chapter yet for the day jump ahead to jeremiah 9. it talks about all these lies people do israel's in awful condition they shoot their uh their tongue is like a bow and they shoot all these lies and god has had enough of it god's rebuking them they've murdered they've sacrificed their children they've done all kinds of things and and god has jeremiah speak this but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understands the godhead and he knows i'm one person can i say it like that praise god amen amen rejoice that you know which person you're praying to and not there's no not three there's only one hallelujah that's right rejoice that you know the truth glory in the fact that you know the god you know the god of the bible and that i the lord exercise what does he do for us he's loving kindness he shows his loving kindness to us he gives us judgment he makes us exercise in righteousness in the earth for these things i delight saith the lord so see when you judge things the right way god delights when you make the right choice when you make the right when you choose the righteous act god delights in your obedience right when you exercise when you show loving kindness to people that don't deserve kindness you are delighting god everyone hear me amen when you show loving kindness to people that don't treat you good you are delighting god god smiles he smells that sweet savor that's a sacrifice that i can deny because why how can they do that because they know me hallelujah church we all know people that don't know god right i'll bring this picture back up i shared this a long time ago our president he's a trinitarian catholic according to the trinity he's a pagan idolater he's an adulterer he's been married twice he's a murderer because he sends billions of dollars to countries so they can commit abortions right liar abominations there's thing that kind of can't even did you see his daughter's diary came out and he abused her as a child but they hide that it's all in her diary all the drugs they do this is a person who says he knows god as a trinity but we're the ones that know god are you with me church and almost all those people are like all those catholic leaders in our nation anthony bauti i think adam schiff aoc nancy pelosi all these catholic people they say they know god they don't know nothing about god that's right because if they knew something about god they would delight and they would execute righteousness hallelujah they would execute holiness but you're the ones by god's grace who know him in the powers resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings that's what we need to glory in tonight last thing i'm going to show you there's 8 billion people on earth these are just rough estimates remember i start with the series with this no it's in the beginning of the chapter two point the biggest group are trinitarians so they're pagan idolaters they believe in three persons catholics and protestants two billion are atheists or agnostics believe in nothing two two billion muslim now they believe in one person but it's a false god and a false prophet muhammad i probably i get stoned for saying that if i was in saudi arabia or iraq or iran i get stoned for saying that he's a false prophet in fact my barber asked me that on saturday i got my haircut he's like what do you think about the muslims i think well i said you got a violent sect and you got a a peaceful sect but either way their prophet was a wicked man married lots of women lots of murders he took a child bride yeah he's a wicked man he saw these visions and got the book that was a demon right visions of demons giving them a false bible the bible said if you add one thing the plagues will be added to you that's right i said look at their murderous spirits that they have yeah they're peaceful ones but you can be peaceful you can be sincere yes sincerely wrong all right but see jesus look jesus looks at the peaceful ones and he has mercy he has loving kindness on that hey then i'm over about 45 of them probably about an hour now now there's other religions in here too of course i didn't cover all of them you know like the japan religion i forget the name of it right now but there's they have millions of them but these were the big ones now look at one is pentecostal so brother william people like us there's 24 million that say god's one person but then they reject a lot of our teachings like holiness like god sent a prophet right like non-eternal hell all these like three works of grace they say the tongues is the third word a tongue a tongue is the third word unbelievable now this was the estimate uh about ten years ago two to four million message believers so all these comes down to a couple couple million i'd say less than that now so many people left the message recently because it's because their preachers lied to him all those years they said brother ram was infallible every word he said was thus they the lord and they found out oh he wasn't infallible right i'm not lying to you i'm telling you the truth chris god i put that third video out today i have 69 proofs not everywhere on papers i'll say the lord i was shocked to see that and i yeah i still leave was a prophet why because he's a human you think if i recorded you for 20 years could i find 69 or 70 or 80 things you did didn't say right right i could probably find a lot more than that yeah so i wouldn't want to do that i wouldn't want you to do that to me either you find a lot of things wrong that i did thank god for the blood praise god amen the things i love i can't reach you last time he was here i'm sorry two times ago and cam was here i think before you got here cam said the thing i love about brother graham he'd make a mistake in the in the in the sermon you know like a human and then the angel lord would still forgive him and come down and discern their hearts and do miracles in other words god stands behind his gifts the gifts and callings of god are without repentance god is a god who's rich in mercy amen amen amen church god will still stand behind you you'll make a mistake and then the next week i'll do some great miracle through you and yet you just made a foolish mistake a week ago because god delights in mercy amen and you know the living god let's stand to our feet musicians we're a small minority who believe god is one person and believe the entire bible are you a grateful church to be one of those that know him amen bro jesse i'm going to glory in my works i'm going to glory in all that i do know glory in the fact that you have the revelation of who jesus christ is amen glory in that that i know him and the enemy is going to use the identity of god whether three persons or one the enemy is going to bring that down to a life or death decision that's going to be one of them one of the doctrines so we've got to be able to stand how many want to stand on god's word tonight amen i appreciate your patience with me i'm just going to check real quick one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven i got eleven more pages in that chapter so i got a couple more sermons in there you have to bear with me church to see how i can teach and i can bring in that shouting and screaming and jumping you can preach and teach at the same time you can do it but you always have that liberty in our church to worship god amen the bible says quench not the holy spirit so if you feel like you need to run you run around the church brothers sometimes i'll do it praise god then while since i danced the last time i danced was when i said god i'll dance when austin gets all his bills paid off and i dance for the lord i think it was a wednesday night i just danced over here for a couple minutes house of the lord i don't gotta do it amen because that's why you dance you got the victory hallelujah all the desperate pain hallelujah all the taskmasters are drowned i got a new life amen that's why you rejoice and give god praise because he knows things man cannot do how to do it amen thank god we ought to be never ashamed to praise the lord amen that's why we need to preach on revival miracles too because i think we need a stirring up don't you hallelujah i've been talking about all these revivals cam and i used to have used to have we need to have some revival here again by god's grace but we've got to pray it down church you've got to pray now got to frame now so i told brother amen this sunday maybe i'll maybe i can try to preach 45 minutes now listen if i preach 45 minutes i know or preach an hour and a half that would give us plenty of time to pray after the sermon and we could pray for revival and still not have a longer service and you know when the holy ghost comes you forget about the time anyway don't really matter anyway but what i'm saying is i don't want to have any excuses where we're too tired to pray but it's our prayers that bring revival in other words when we get a revival it break brings the trash out of our lives we cut out everything that we didn't really need to do don't really need to do this let's devote this energy to god [Music] i watch those uh message revival some of those churches are having message revivals and i look at that like that's exactly what we had in 2009 2010 2011 2012. i can look it up on the on cams archives that's exactly what we have but god says i'll restore sin amen we've got to hope for that church we've got to hope for a revival where people will scream and shout speak in tongues miracles will be done devils be cast down and hopefully not not out of us hopefully the devils get cast out of our visitors god that means we were clean before god amen if we got a devil then we're in a bad situation we ought to come up here for prayer confess your sins let's cast that devil out of here you know you don't belong here no devil belongs here there should be no leaven in the camp praise god amen so we should have the shot of the kingdom amen god bless you i appreciate your patience love all of you let's buy our heads for word of prayer the mystery of the godhead what a blessing to know him aren't you glad you know him church [Music] i am a witness as a trinitarian i never knew god for 19 years and then for two more years until simon brought the message so for 21 years of my life i never really knew god but now glory for the last 20 years i've known him i've known him hallelujah i've known him in the power i've seen his power i've known him in the sufferings [Music] as paul said [Music] let me be made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain to the resurrection of the dead the first resurrection the rapture i'm going to say that tonight lord whatever you have to do in my life conform me to be like christ it is death and his power and his suffering that by any means i'll go in the rapture how many would pray that tonight let's pray together heavenly father we thank you for your word tonight lord it feels good to jump and have some liberty and shout lord rejoice thank god thank god lord for the freedom of the holy spirit may we never quench the holy spirit dear god may we have a revival lord god again let all the trash flow out of our lives dear god where services can last three four five hours and lord we don't even realize it because the anointing of the holy spirit lord if it be your will we just want your will to be done we want to see miracles oh god we want a revival hallelujah god we thank you we want to know you intimately lord god but we know there's also along with the power there's also the suffering part so lord help us be ready lord god prepare us lord for any suffering and also god prepares for power hallelujah that we can be dedicated lord god sincere that the power of god might flow thank you for all the testimonies this year lord you've been so gracious have you prayed for austin alina their different requests you've met so many needs over god jose's half the lord he has a miracle from the doctor he says we thank you lord god for your grace and mercy for the souls that were baptized here god we thank you for every blessing heavenly father and we ask of god that you would lord help us to glory in the fact that we know you the lord we'll never boast of ourselves lord we have nothing to boast of no man will boast except in the cross of jesus christ our lord thank you for the cross thank you for dying for our sins thank you god lord that you can work through us as jesus said may we say lord show us the works that we might do the works of god jesus said i knew nothing except the father shows me may the father may the holy spirit show us the words we want to do in our lives and may we do them they will get a clear-cut decision from god then we seek you until we know what to do especially these young people i pray for living the lord of malachi austin alina with these major decisions in jesus name may they seek your face on god hallelujah but nothing hinders them from seeking your face and knowing your will dear god on these major decisions in life for lord many times it's those major ones that make all the difference hallelujah may they fast and pray may they sink your face oh god those of us that are older may we fast and pray may we seek your face for the areas of our life that we need for we all want more of you dear god we all want to see a move in other people's lives in our lives god we glory in your identity we glory that you've made known that you're one person mystery no doubt about it you called it a mystery but yet revelation understanding wisdom in scripture lord god guide us and we do not add or take away thank you for showing us who you are in jesus christ's day saint said if you know desires prayer and more welcome to come
