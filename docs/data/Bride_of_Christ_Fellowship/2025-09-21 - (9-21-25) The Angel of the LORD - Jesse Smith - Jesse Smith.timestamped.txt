[0:00] You know, like Wednesday, we looked at
[0:01] uh we have thus sayeth the Lord and uh
[0:05] maybe more like of a review for some of
[0:07] us or maybe a teaching for some of us by
[0:10] God's grace. But I am so thankful
[0:12] church, I can go to a church that says,
[0:15] "I have thus sayith the Lord." We have
[0:17] thus sayeth the Lord from a prophet of
[0:20] God. Hallelujah. And they all line up.
[0:22] All 27 of them we went through line up
[0:25] with the scriptures. Praise God. But I
[0:27] like to go to uh Psalm 34:7. I like to
[0:30] just take a few services and look at the
[0:31] angel of the Lord. I want to look at
[0:33] that. I put a video out about it
[0:35] yesterday. U but I want to just try to
[0:38] just hand or handcrafted or craft it by
[0:41] the Holy Spirit for the local church
[0:43] here by God's grace.
[0:46] Looking up a verse here.
[0:52] So Psalm uh 34:7 familiar verse. How
[0:54] many appreciate this verse? Praise God.
[0:56] What a promise and encouragement this
[0:58] ought to be to us
[1:01] that we we have an angel that's not just
[1:03] going to be with us from time to time,
[1:06] maybe a couple times in our lives, but
[1:08] the angel is going to camp around us.
[1:10] Praise God. So, we have a constant
[1:13] messenger from the Lord that watches
[1:15] over our lives. What an encouragement
[1:17] this is. So, let's read this if we can
[1:19] on three. One, two, three. the angel of
[1:22] the Lord encampeth round about them that
[1:25] fear him and deliverth him. The Bible
[1:29] says, "Don't forget all of his
[1:30] benefits." If you've ever been
[1:32] delivered, we have God to thank for it.
[1:34] And God sent his angel to deliver us. Uh
[1:37] may God add his blessing to the ring of
[1:39] his word. You can be seated here by
[1:40] God's grace.
[1:51] So, let's look at this thought here. Uh,
[1:53] by the grace of the Lord, I don't I
[1:54] mean, I have enough notes to preach. I
[1:56] said like a series, but we'll kind of
[1:58] see how uh it goes. I got my thoughts,
[2:00] you know, about where I'd like it to go.
[2:02] But, you know, as uh as I was looking
[2:05] back at my notes, I haven't spent a lot
[2:07] of time on angels, I would say, you
[2:08] know, my in my pastorship here. Um, the
[2:11] last time I think I preached on was back
[2:13] in 2020. I found one sermon from 2020
[2:16] called Lessons from Angels. And I just
[2:18] kind of basically reviewed uh different
[2:21] types of angels on the video. Yesterday
[2:23] I put out uh there's at least six type
[2:24] of angels. But now, you know, if you go
[2:26] through and you look at different
[2:28] verses, I've I'm already up to eight now
[2:30] because you have destroying angels, you
[2:31] have the ceiling angel along with all
[2:34] these other types of angels. So, it's
[2:35] awesome to see how God has soldiers or
[2:38] angels for almost every situation we
[2:41] could go through. Aren't you glad for
[2:42] that? Hallelujah. God knows how to send
[2:45] angels. The Bible says in Hebrews, he
[2:47] has an innumerable number of angels.
[2:50] Hallelujah. So, we rejoice in that and
[2:53] we thank God for his uh love and mercy
[2:56] to give us these angels. Now, I want to
[2:58] just start with this thought uh about
[3:01] the angel of the Lord. I think it'd be
[3:03] best, you know, to start with this
[3:05] thought. Just like when I preached on
[3:06] the mysteries, I started with the
[3:07] Godhead because God is the most
[3:09] important mystery of all mysteries. And
[3:11] the church said,
[3:12] &gt;&gt; you know, God, if there is a mystery
[3:14] that that that's worth looking into, we
[3:16] know all of them are worth looking into,
[3:17] but if there's one mystery that's
[3:19] greater than all of them, it would be
[3:20] God. Hallelujah.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; Because God is the creator. Hallelujah.
[3:24] God is our savior. Hallelujah. God is
[3:25] our provider. So, I want to look at uh
[3:27] today we'll look at for the majority of
[3:29] our time, we'll look at the angel of the
[3:31] Lord. As I said, there are six or maybe
[3:33] eight or more different types of angels
[3:35] and we'll take some services here and
[3:37] we'll try to look at these here by the
[3:39] grace of God. The angel of the Lord is
[3:43] the most important angel because this is
[3:45] God in a angelic form.
[3:50] This is not we'd say Michael, Gabriel,
[3:53] any other lower class angel, but the
[3:56] angel of the Lord is God himself in
[3:59] angelic form. Hallelujah. Now if you
[4:02] remember the capital L O R D there, the
[4:05] angel of the Lord, the capital Lord uh
[4:08] refers to Jehovah
[4:10] or Yhovah in the the Hebrew and this
[4:14] means the selfexisting one.
[4:17] So this is the messenger of the
[4:19] self-existing one. This is God.
[4:21] Hallelujah. This is God coming down as
[4:23] his own messenger. Praise the Lord.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Random dramatized it uh well
[4:29] with the three Hebrew children. You
[4:30] remember that drama brother Rand did
[4:32] with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[4:34] Remember that? It's been a while since
[4:35] we looked at that, but Brother Random
[4:38] said Shadrach and Meshach and Abed
[4:40] Abednego were going to the towards the
[4:41] fiery furnace. And brother Ram said they
[4:44] didn't need a prayer meeting because
[4:45] they already prayed.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Ram said while
[4:49] they're being taken there, Brother Ram
[4:52] said all the angels were reporting back
[4:53] to him and saying, "Lord, your three
[4:56] servants are going to be tossed in the
[4:58] fire. I'll go." And brother Ram
[5:00] dramatized. Gabriel said, "I'll go."
[5:02] Michael said, "I'll go." And all the
[5:05] angels were trying to interject their
[5:07] thoughts and say, "Well, I'll go." And
[5:08] brother Ram dramatized it and says,
[5:10] "That's okay, angels. This is a
[5:12] God-sized job."
[5:15] &gt;&gt; And God, Brother Ram said, "God said,
[5:17] I'm going to go myself and deliver my
[5:19] Hebrew, my Hebrew children." Praise God.
[5:21] And then the Bible says that
[5:23] Nebuchadnezzar looked there in the fire
[5:25] and he saw three, but then he saw one
[5:27] like unto the son of God.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that was God himself.
[5:31] Brother Chris,
[5:33] I don't know if they were brothers or
[5:34] not. That's a good question. I don't
[5:36] know. Good question.
[5:38] But God himself, brothers, uh, brother
[5:41] Ram said God himself wanted to come down
[5:43] and deliver his children. Hallelujah.
[5:46] And the angel Lord encamps around us and
[5:49] delivers us. Hallelujah. So the angel
[5:52] Lord comes down and delivers sometimes
[5:54] God himself at times whenever it speaks
[5:57] of an angel that's likened unto the son
[5:59] of God uh in the days of Daniel there.
[6:02] Other times it's referring to God in
[6:05] angel form. And so church, what would
[6:07] that mean? That would mean the invisible
[6:09] God created a theophony. That would be
[6:11] the logos, right? The Holy Spirit. And
[6:13] God, the invisible God came inside his
[6:16] presence. Came inside that visible
[6:18] logos. And then made a angelic image,
[6:21] right? A body, angelic body, theophony
[6:24] body, and came down to earth and made
[6:26] himself visible unto mortals like us.
[6:29] Wretched mortals like us. Amen. God
[6:32] allowed himself to be seen and
[6:34] delivered. Hallelujah. And he delivered
[6:36] wretched mortals like us. That shows,
[6:38] church, we serve a living God.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That proves we serve a loving God,
[6:44] a God who loves us, a God that will come
[6:46] down himself and minister to the people.
[6:49] Praise God. Now, I want to just make
[6:51] sure I read this quote here uh from
[6:53] Brother Brandham.
[6:54] I started the video with this uh
[6:56] yesterday. In 1955, Brother Ram was
[6:59] preaching on how the angel came to me in
[7:01] Chicago. And he says, "I'm saying this
[7:04] with permission, I believe, from the
[7:06] Holy Spirit. The angel of the Lord that
[7:09] comes is not the Lord Jesus.
[7:14] He said for uh it doesn't look like him
[7:16] in the same vision. For the vision I saw
[7:19] the Lord Jesus, he was a little man. So
[7:22] brother Ram says he's seen the Lord
[7:24] three times. I found two of them. I need
[7:26] to keep searching. Jose and I were
[7:27] searching a couple weeks ago
[7:29] uh where brother Ram had seen the Lord
[7:31] Jesus. Brother Ram saw him when he was a
[7:34] a a newly saved Christian when he was
[7:36] out praying for his father in a sage
[7:38] bush field. He was out praying in the
[7:40] nighttime and then he looked over and he
[7:42] saw Jesus and then uh he cried out to
[7:45] Jesus and then he passed out. He woke up
[7:46] the next morning. That was the first
[7:48] time he saw the Lord Jesus. And then in
[7:50] 1960 he saw the Lord Jesus after he had
[7:52] the sinus infection and he missed some
[7:55] meetings. He had a nine-day sinus
[7:56] infection and he missed meetings and he
[7:58] he asked his wife, you know, am I even
[8:00] called to the ministry and he said his
[8:03] wife rebuked him a little bit and said,
[8:05] "Don't say such things as that." Uh but
[8:08] then brother Ram had a vision of the
[8:09] Lord Jesus and uh it was basically a
[8:11] vision of the third pole and that that
[8:14] the Lord Jesus was was uh was showing
[8:16] him the promised land. In other words,
[8:18] the promised land was the third step for
[8:19] Joshua. And so the Lord Jesus was
[8:21] showing brother Brandham the third pole
[8:23] of his ministry. Praise God. And so
[8:26] those are the two times. And brother Ram
[8:27] said there's three times he's seen him.
[8:29] So I need to find that third time.
[8:32] But I want you to notice that that
[8:33] brother Ram says when the angel of the
[8:35] Lord would come on the platform, he said
[8:36] it would always stand on the right side
[8:38] of the platform. So the angel would
[8:39] stand on this side. And the angel would
[8:42] then show uh the secrets of the thoughts
[8:45] intents of the heart. Show him visions
[8:47] of the of the patients that were in
[8:49] line. And brother Brandon says that
[8:51] angel is not the Lord Jesus.
[8:54] Okay? Because it looked different. He
[8:56] said the Lord Jesus, he says, was a
[8:59] little man. He said, a white garment on,
[9:01] his arms folded like this and a beard, a
[9:03] short beard, hair down to his shoulders.
[9:06] So, brother Ram said the the vision of
[9:07] the Lord Jesus looked mostly like this,
[9:10] but he had a white uh garment on, a
[9:13] little fellow. He said, but the angel
[9:15] that came to him, he describes it like
[9:18] this, a big large man weighing about 200
[9:21] lb. I've said he looks a lot like
[9:22] Malachi's physical size and he has dark
[9:25] hair down to the shoulder and he said he
[9:28] had no beard and then he would look he
[9:30] would fold his arms too and just look at
[9:31] brother Brandham that's how Billy Paul
[9:33] describes him as well so brother
[9:35] Brandham said that was the angel that
[9:37] was commissioned to him his whole life
[9:39] dark hair about 200 lb a big man
[9:44] dark hair down to his shoulders
[9:47] and so brother says you know that when
[9:48] that angel comes you know brother would
[9:50] have to wait for And you say he's here.
[9:52] Brother Bam said he's here. He said
[9:54] don't fear that. He said that's just the
[9:56] angel of the Lord. Okay. So that was an
[9:59] angel, a separate angel, not the Lord
[10:01] Jesus in theophony form. That was a
[10:03] separate angel that would come down that
[10:05] was commissioned to brother Brandham. He
[10:06] said from my birth.
[10:09] Hallelujah. So this is what we would say
[10:11] like a guardian angel. Right? A guardian
[10:13] angel commissioned to brother Brandon
[10:15] from his birth. And he was not the Lord
[10:17] Jesus, but he was an angel of the Lord.
[10:21] Okay, so I just want to I thought I'd
[10:23] share that. But then church, I found
[10:24] quotes. There are quotes where brother
[10:25] Ram says that the Lord Jesus did come
[10:29] down himself. Hallelujah. Brother Ram
[10:32] said in Houston Coliseum in 1960, I'm
[10:34] sorry, 1950 during the debate with Dr.
[10:37] Best and brother Bosworth, brother
[10:40] Random said that uh that angel, he said
[10:42] that same pillar of fire that followed
[10:44] the children of Israel, the same thing
[10:46] here today, the same Christ. Any Bible
[10:49] student knows that's the pillar of fire
[10:50] that led the children of Israel through
[10:52] the wilderness was the angel of the
[10:54] covenant Christ, the the logos that went
[10:57] out from God in the beginning.
[11:00] He said, "And that logos was made flesh
[11:03] and dwelt in a human body here on earth
[11:05] named Jesus." Look what it did then.
[11:08] Look what it did when it come down in
[11:09] some flesh and talked to Abraham. Look
[11:11] what it did when it was here on earth
[11:13] that walked in Galilee. What it did?
[11:15] Well, here it is back again tonight
[11:17] dwelling in all of us. The universal
[11:20] church doing the same thing. Jesus
[11:22] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[11:25] forever. And the church said,
[11:27] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Think about that. The same logos
[11:30] that went out from God was the same
[11:32] logos that met Abraham. The same logos
[11:35] that melt met Jacob and Moses and Joshua
[11:39] and Paul and now and the same God that
[11:42] was in Jesus
[11:45] said now that same logos is with us here
[11:47] tonight. Hallelujah. So church catch
[11:50] that. There's times the angel of the
[11:52] Lord would be there just a regular angel
[11:53] brother's angel would be there but then
[11:55] there's times the Lord Jesus would show
[11:57] up as well.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And church, that matches the
[12:01] scripture because uh many times when
[12:04] there's more than one believer, there's
[12:06] numerous angels that are with the people
[12:08] of God.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Elisha told his servant, he said,
[12:12] "There's there's more that's with us
[12:15] than that's with this Syrian army."
[12:18] &gt;&gt; And he prayed, "God, open the eyes of
[12:21] Gahesa. Open the eyes of your servant."
[12:23] And the Bible said, "Ghesa open up his
[12:25] eyes. He looked at the mountains. And
[12:27] the mountains were full of chariots of
[12:29] fire. The mountains were full of angels.
[12:32] In other words, God backs up his
[12:34] prophet.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God backs up his people.
[12:37] Hallelujah.
[12:39] So, we know that, you know, it matches
[12:41] the scripture when you have more than
[12:43] one believer. You had Elisha and Gahaza.
[12:46] And I don't know how often God sends a
[12:48] whole host of army angels. I don't know
[12:50] how often he does that. But with the
[12:52] prophet Elisha, he sent a whole army of
[12:55] angels. And the Bible calls him the Lord
[12:58] of hosts is with us. Amen.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; The Lord of And we sing he's the God of
[13:03] angel armies. Hallelujah. He's always by
[13:06] my side. Hallelujah.
[13:08] Oh, what a blessing to know, church,
[13:10] that the angel of the Lord is here
[13:12] today. Hallelujah. So, the Lord Jesus,
[13:15] if his if his holy presence would be
[13:17] with us today, we'd be so privileged.
[13:19] But we also know that each one of us
[13:22] have an angel with us throughout our
[13:23] whole lives.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we have we have at least
[13:27] that knowledge. Praise God. That there's
[13:29] an angel that camps around us and it's
[13:32] here to deliver us. Now church, that's
[13:35] we know we know that's physical
[13:37] deliverance. We also know it's spiritual
[13:40] deliverance. And we'll prove that by the
[13:43] end by God's grace.
[13:45] So church, if anybody feels here today
[13:47] you need deliverance, the angel of the
[13:50] Lord is here to deliver.
[13:55] Now, some we could all I I would like it
[13:57] if we could all go down through our
[13:58] lives and just think when did I get
[14:00] delivered from fear? When did I get
[14:01] delivered from uh lust or or or stress
[14:05] or or anxiety or uh covet covetousness?
[14:10] And if if you think deeply on that,
[14:12] you'll find if you got delivered, it was
[14:15] God sending his angel to deliver you.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because remember it was it
[14:20] was the angel's wrestling in order
[14:22] Michael had to come in and step in the
[14:24] wrestling match in order to bring
[14:26] deliverance to Daniel because Daniel
[14:27] wanted to know the timing of God. So it
[14:30] was the angel that brought the word of
[14:32] deliverance or the word of knowledge to
[14:34] Daniel when he was seeking for it.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; And church if you're seeking for
[14:37] something God angel is here for you to
[14:40] help you receive it. Praise God.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; That's why I like what brother Simon
[14:46] preached last week. I think it was
[14:47] timely with the approach. Hallelujah. If
[14:49] we take the right approach to God, God
[14:51] will uh God will reveal himself to us
[14:54] and be able to deliver us on what we
[14:56] have need of. Hallelujah.
[15:01] So, I think of Adam's testimony and next
[15:03] next Sunday night is Rod's testimony.
[15:04] Brother Rods, for those who can make it,
[15:06] next Sunday night at 3 p.m., he'll give
[15:08] his testimony. But I think of Adam's
[15:10] testimony and how, you know, he had been
[15:11] so deep and demonpossessed, but then he
[15:14] had to go to that 30-day uh deliverance
[15:17] ministry.
[15:18] But then he finally came to that day,
[15:20] right? He finally came to that day where
[15:22] God delivered him. And that was the
[15:24] angel of the Lord, right? So the angel
[15:27] Lord drove out that demon power of
[15:30] cocaine or heroin or marijuana whatever
[15:33] it may be that the that that that that
[15:35] angel power because the angels hold the
[15:38] presence of God. The prince of God
[15:40] commanded that evil spirit to leave.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; God brought deliverance. The angel Lord
[15:46] brought deliverance. Amen. Hallelujah.
[15:48] Amen. And then we heard his testimony.
[15:51] For years he had to fight to get other
[15:53] types of victory. And then church, while
[15:55] he was here last month, the angel of the
[15:58] Lord gave him another victory. Praise
[16:00] God.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; While he was here, who is here to give
[16:03] him victory? It's not brother Jesse.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; It's not brother so and so or sister so
[16:08] and so. It's the angel of the Lord
[16:10] that's here. Hallelujah.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; God's angel is here to drive away demon
[16:15] powers. Hallelujah.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; And deliver his people. And church, we
[16:20] just need reminders of it. We just need
[16:23] an awareness of it.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Now, but now I want to shift back to the
[16:30] angel of the Lord, God in angelic form.
[16:34] Now, I'm just hitting the highlights. Uh
[16:35] I could I could be wrong on some of
[16:37] these, but the first time we see the
[16:39] angel lord is uh Genesis 22.
[16:42] So, if you have your Bibles, let's go
[16:43] there.
[16:46] And there could be before this, you
[16:48] know, of course, we see the cherubam uh
[16:50] in in Genesis 3, we see the angels
[16:52] guarding the tree of life. But here with
[16:54] the angel of the Lord,
[16:57] Genesis 22:15.
[16:59] Now, Abraham's in quite a spot, but
[17:01] remember, as brother Diggs preached to
[17:02] us, Abraham's faith was skyhigh at this
[17:05] point. Hallelujah. He'd lied to twice
[17:08] the kings about his wife. Should have
[17:11] had his his wife and his life taken, and
[17:14] yet God had restored it back to him.
[17:16] Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. So if
[17:19] anybody should have believed that that
[17:21] they were on God's side, it should have
[17:23] been Abraham.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; But then God tells Abraham, "Go
[17:27] sacrifice your son, your only son." Yet
[17:29] he had Ishmael.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; So God recognized that Isaac was the
[17:33] promised son.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the only son. Amen.
[17:38] The only real son is the promised son.
[17:40] Hallelujah. The promised word.
[17:43] And so Abraham, no doubt he's no doubt,
[17:45] even though he's got a promise.
[17:46] Remember, and remember church, he's got
[17:48] the profession that God can do a
[17:50] resurrection.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Remember early in the chapter, he said,
[17:53] "You stay here. I the lad will come back
[17:55] and will come again to you."
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; He had resurrection faith that yes, God
[18:01] might have me strike him down, but God
[18:03] will raise him up. Amen.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; But anyways, no doubt as a father, even
[18:08] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[18:10] think about us parents, even without the
[18:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost, how much
[18:13] we're we have fear about we want our
[18:16] children to live long lives and be safe
[18:18] and not get any accidents, right? And
[18:20] not h how much do we care as as human
[18:23] parents with the baptism of the Holy
[18:24] Ghost? Well, look at Abraham.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Abraham had the promise. So no doubt
[18:29] what I'm saying is he would have felt
[18:30] some human emotion about this,
[18:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[18:36] But as he raises his knife, the Bible
[18:38] said, "The angel of the Lord called in
[18:40] Abraham out of heaven the second time
[18:42] and said, uh, by myself have I sworn,
[18:46] sayeth the Lord." No, I'm sorry. I I got
[18:49] the wrong verse. It's verse 10 and 11.
[18:51] And Abram stretched forth his hand and
[18:53] took a knife to slay his son. Verse 11.
[18:54] And the angel Lord called on him out of
[18:56] heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham." And
[18:58] he said, "Here am I." So we get that
[19:01] beautiful picture again. Who steps down
[19:03] to save Isaac, the angel of the Lord.
[19:06] Just like he stepped down, didn't he
[19:08] step down to deliver Shadrach, Meshach,
[19:10] and Abedneo? It's the same God stepping
[19:13] down again to deliver Abraham's seed.
[19:16] And church, you ought to rejoice that he
[19:18] saved Abraham's seed, Isaac. But you
[19:20] also ought to rejoice that you're the
[19:21] seed of Abraham. Amen.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he will deliver you.
[19:26] Hallelujah. I think of all the car
[19:28] accidents I could have been in that
[19:30] could have ended my life. Even uh two
[19:32] weeks ago when when I got news that
[19:33] Charlie Kirk had been shot. On my drive
[19:36] home, I'm driving.
[19:38] I just had heard the news. I don't know
[19:40] if I told I told my wife, but I didn't
[19:41] tell anybody else. I'm driving all and
[19:43] all I see all of a sudden I see this
[19:45] Chevy Suburban huge car, right? A maroon
[19:47] one. It swerves into my lane. It's
[19:49] coming right at me.
[19:51] And I'm like, honk honk. And I see the
[19:53] person look up from their phone and like
[19:56] and just barely miss me. I just heard
[19:59] about death, right? And I'm I'm like,
[20:01] what in the world's going on? And then
[20:02] death is knocking right on my door.
[20:06] But church, what is it? The angel Lord
[20:08] is there to deliver us.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; An angel woke that guy up. That it was a
[20:13] guy. The angel woke that guy up and
[20:16] swerved him at right the right time.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; He wasn't Now look, church. He wasn't
[20:20] drunk. He wasn't high because he was
[20:22] able to be alert.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; But it just reminded me again, you know,
[20:26] death could happen at any time. So, we
[20:28] want to be ready to go. Praise God.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; But we also have the promise we won't
[20:32] leave here one second before God says
[20:34] it's time to go. Praise God.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Because the angel's there. God's angel
[20:39] is with you to deliver you.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Pardon me.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I spit too much. So, forgive
[20:45] me.
[20:47] So we can see that even uh my life I can
[20:49] see just within a few weeks ago and I
[20:51] told you the story in college where the
[20:53] my friend was going 99 or 100 miles per
[20:55] hour in a little geometro or whatever it
[20:56] was and he got out of control. We slid
[20:59] four four lanes across I76 right there
[21:03] by Goodyear the Goodyear headquarters
[21:05] and came to a perfect stop
[21:08] uh by the concrete wall. And as soon as
[21:11] we stopped I saw all these 18-wheelers
[21:12] pass us. It was the angel of God holding
[21:16] them back, right? And let and and and
[21:18] and causing us I'm only 19 20 years old
[21:21] there. I think I was 20 years old. 19
[21:23] maybe.
[21:25] And the car wasn't damaged now. The
[21:27] tires were blown out or whatever. They
[21:28] we couldn't drive it after that, but we
[21:31] were able to walk to practice and sadly
[21:33] I had to go to practice, but but I can
[21:35] recognize someone delivered me there.
[21:38] Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Someone held back vehicles and someone
[21:42] brought our car to a perfect stop so I
[21:44] didn't have one hair singed or one hair
[21:46] damaged.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Right? What are the chances of going 100
[21:50] miles per hour and spinning numerous
[21:52] times and stopping right next to the
[21:53] concrete wall?
[21:55] &gt;&gt; It's God's angel there to deliver us.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, there was more life for
[22:00] me to have. I was supposed to have a
[22:01] Malachi, an acacia, an Lydia. I was my
[22:04] life. God wasn't done with me yet. I was
[22:06] supposed to preach the gospel. Praise
[22:08] God.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; I was supposed to preach to you on
[22:10] September, was it 23rd or 20 21st 2025
[22:15] about the angel of the Lord
[22:17] &gt;&gt; so that you'll recognize the angel of
[22:19] the Lord and you'll be thankful for the
[22:21] angel of the Lord.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; And so we see the angel of God
[22:29] delivering the seed of Abraham just like
[22:31] the angel Lord delivers you. Amen.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; And then the Abraham calls this place
[22:38] Jehovah Gyra. For in the mount of the
[22:41] Lord it shall be seen. The Lord is seen.
[22:43] The Lord has provided a sacrifice.
[22:46] Now here's where as I said in verse 15
[22:48] and 16, here's where we get that this is
[22:50] God in an angel.
[22:53] And he said in verse 16, by myself I
[22:56] have sworn. Now church, an angel can't
[22:58] swear by himself. An angel has to swear
[23:01] by the Lord. We're we're taught that in
[23:03] the book of Hebrews. But God, there's
[23:05] nobody greater than him. So, he has to
[23:07] swear by himself.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He can only make a
[23:12] promise by himself.
[23:14] For because thou has done this thing and
[23:16] hast not withheld thy son, thy only son,
[23:18] that in blessing I will bless thee, and
[23:19] multiplying I'll multiply thy seed as
[23:21] the stars of heaven. And as the sand
[23:23] which is upon the seashore, thy seed
[23:25] shall possess the gate of his enemies.
[23:27] And in thy seed shall all the nations of
[23:29] the earth be blessed because thou hast
[23:31] obeyed my voice. Church, obey the voice
[23:34] of God, and God will bless your seed.
[23:37] Hallelujah.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; If you want God to bless you or your
[23:41] family or your future family, if our
[23:43] brothers, you know, one day get married,
[23:45] if you want God to bless your family,
[23:47] then obey the voice of God.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God brings a voice to
[23:52] remembrance or or I'm sorry, when God
[23:53] brings a scripture to your remembrance,
[23:55] God tells you to do something, you know,
[23:56] it's the word of God, obey it and God
[23:59] will bring blessing upon blessing into
[24:02] your life.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm preaching on blessings.
[24:06] Hallelujah. I'm enjoying the amens.
[24:09] Hallelujah.
[24:10] So, this is an angel speaking with
[24:12] divine authority. This is God in angel
[24:15] form. This is not a cherub. This is not
[24:17] a saraphim. This is not a watcher. This
[24:20] is not the ceiling angel. This is not
[24:21] the destroying angel. This is God in
[24:24] angel form.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Now, the second time we see this, at
[24:28] least me that I've studied so far. The
[24:30] second time I've seen him is at Jacob.
[24:32] And I just preached on this a few weeks
[24:33] ago about wrestling. We wrestle not
[24:35] against flesh and blood.
[24:39] So, let's go to Genesis 32. We could do
[24:41] a second round on this here by God's
[24:43] grace.
[24:49] Now verse uh 30 chapter 32 verse 24 he's
[24:53] left alone and he starts wrestling
[24:56] and as I said I I didn't know if this
[24:58] was the angel Lord or not but it seems
[24:59] like it is the angel of the Lord.
[25:03] So he wrestles and he wants to know the
[25:05] angel but it's a secret
[25:08] uh down in verse 29. And Jacob asked him
[25:10] and said tell me I pray thee thy name.
[25:11] Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after
[25:13] my name? And he blessed him there. So,
[25:15] in other words, God was hiding the name
[25:17] of Jesus until the time when Jesus was
[25:19] conceived in the womb of Mary. Amen. And
[25:21] then the first time his name was spoken,
[25:23] John the Baptist leaped in his mother's
[25:25] womb. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, church, we
[25:28] ought to just rejoice and bless that
[25:31] wonderful name of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[25:39] Look at verse 30. And Jacob called the
[25:41] name of the place Pineal for I've seen
[25:44] God face to face and my life is
[25:47] preserved.
[25:49] So this is the angel Lord. And yeah what
[25:51] I forgot to say also about the angel
[25:52] Lord. Brother Ram says the angel Lord is
[25:55] the covenant angel. Brother Random says
[25:57] I read it earlier
[25:59] which means God shows up when he's
[26:01] working with somebody in a covenant
[26:04] situation.
[26:06] Now church remember there's only eight
[26:07] covenants. Now, thank God, brother uh
[26:10] remember Paul Griffin, remember he came
[26:11] in here and he said, "I I never met many
[26:13] people who thought there was eight
[26:14] covenants, but brother Jesse wrote about
[26:16] in his book." So, we were in one accord
[26:18] all these years. He's a what, a 60some
[26:19] year old man, and God put us in one
[26:21] accord by God's grace. But in other
[26:23] words, the angel of the Lord is the
[26:25] covenant angel.
[26:27] Now, how many know that God gave Abraham
[26:29] a covenant?
[26:31] It's in Genesis 12. Then he repeats it
[26:34] in Genesis 15. And then he brings them
[26:36] circumcision covenant in Genesis 17. How
[26:39] many know that
[26:40] &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm going to make a covenant
[26:42] with you." So when God made covenants
[26:44] with individuals, then God himself would
[26:46] come down as an angel and confirm the
[26:49] covenant.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[26:51] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:55] Now you remember God made the covenant
[26:57] to Abraham, but it just wasn't to
[26:58] Abraham only. It was to Abraham, Isaac,
[27:02] and
[27:04] so that's why God comes down himself.
[27:07] God comes himself to meet with Jacob.
[27:09] This, as I said, church, this ain't just
[27:11] Michael. This ain't Gabriel, which I
[27:13] still don't know what kind of angel
[27:14] Gabriel is. I'm still trying to figure
[27:16] that out. Of course, we know Michael's
[27:17] an archangel. I still don't know what
[27:19] kind of angel Gabriel is. Is he a Is he
[27:21] a watcher angel? Is he a cherub? But it
[27:24] seems like the cherubs stay by the
[27:26] throne of God. They always guard the
[27:28] throne of God. He wouldn't be a saraphim
[27:30] because he's not bringing the fire like
[27:32] was brought to Isaiah. So I imagine he's
[27:34] a watcher angel, but I'm not certain.
[27:38] But it's uh but we see this here that
[27:41] that Jacob gets alone with God. He
[27:43] wrestles with God and God lets him win.
[27:46] Oh church, what a blessing. Amen.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; And I love this church. After Jacob gets
[27:51] the wrestling match and he wins it, he
[27:54] doesn't have to tell anybody that he
[27:56] wrestled an angel.
[27:58] Think about that. He went to Esau the
[28:00] next chapter. He doesn't have to tell
[28:01] Esau, "Look at me. I'm a big man. I
[28:03] wrestled an angel,
[28:08] &gt;&gt; church. They could just look at him and
[28:09] say, "He limped." Right? So, they could
[28:11] just look at him and say, "Jacob has a
[28:13] different walk,
[28:14] &gt;&gt; right? And we know that that's how we
[28:16] walk. The Bible said we walk in the
[28:17] newness of the spirit." Thank God we
[28:19] don't have limps.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Now, we might later on, Brother Vang, as
[28:22] we get older. I'm getting up there. You
[28:24] might have one later on. But Jacob
[28:27] didn't have to go around bragging about
[28:29] it. He just look, everybody could see he
[28:32] had a different walk. That's how it is
[28:33] when you get the Holy Ghost. When you
[28:35] get the Holy Ghost, you don't have to
[28:36] tell people about it. They'll see a
[28:38] difference in your life.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:43] That's right. When you get the Holy
[28:45] Ghost, people will see, wow, that
[28:46] brother acts different.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; That sister acts different.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:53] Now, of course, you'll testify about it
[28:54] because remember on the day of
[28:55] Pentecost, they what? They got the Holy
[28:57] Ghost. What' they do? They said, "Oh,
[28:58] he's so wonderful. God is so wonderful.
[29:01] Jesus died on the cross. He's He's
[29:03] raised again. He sent the Holy Ghost.
[29:05] God is doing wonderful works. Now his
[29:07] spirit is here. The comforter is here.
[29:09] Now I got the spirit of Jesus in me. The
[29:12] Messiah is in me. Hallelujah. The Holy
[29:14] Ghost is in me." That was a sign they
[29:16] were born again as well
[29:19] &gt;&gt; because they could tell people the
[29:21] wonderful works of God.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; And before they were hiding up in a
[29:26] attic, we'd say upper room,
[29:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[29:29] &gt;&gt; So see church, if you get the Holy
[29:30] Ghost, you'll go back to your work or
[29:32] you'll go back to your home or you'll go
[29:34] back to your school girls,
[29:37] right? or your homeschool and they will
[29:40] know something's different about this
[29:42] person.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Because you'll be declaring the
[29:46] wonderful works of God.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[29:52] So notice this is God himself as the
[29:55] angel of the Lord and he comes to Jacob
[29:58] because Jacob has the covenant and God
[30:01] won't let that covenant fail. Wow. If
[30:04] God gives you a covenant, God won't let
[30:06] that covenant fail. God will make sure
[30:09] you keep that covenant because no man
[30:10] can keep it. So if God gives it, God has
[30:13] to make sure it's carried out.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[30:19] Now, what's interesting is Hosea 12:4.
[30:22] In case you if you got your Bible, you
[30:23] can turn there. If not, uh, turn to
[30:25] Exodus chapter 3. Exodus 3 is a lot
[30:28] closer, but Hosea 12:4. This is speaking
[30:31] again of Jacob. Yay. He had power over
[30:34] the angel and prevailed.
[30:37] In other words, God let Israel or Jacob
[30:41] have uh God let him win the victory. In
[30:44] other words, God let him just beg and
[30:46] wrestle and fight until he got what he
[30:48] wanted.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, God let him pray until
[30:53] God said, "Okay, I'm going to give you
[30:55] what you want."
[30:57] &gt;&gt; But Jacob is not stronger than God. God
[31:01] just really wanted to see that he wanted
[31:02] a change in his life.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then God blessed him. So
[31:07] see church, listen. There are times you
[31:09] have to plead with God for whatever
[31:11] blessing you want in your life
[31:13] &gt;&gt; because Jacob had to do it.
[31:16] Right.
[31:18] But I can show you also there's other
[31:20] times God will just do miracles for
[31:21] people. It's like they didn't even pray
[31:22] for. And brother Ham says that in works
[31:24] his faith expressed 1965. He said some
[31:27] people got to struggle for it. He said
[31:29] others is just given to them and there's
[31:31] hardly any effort to it at all.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; So church, listen, don't be jealous of
[31:35] people that get blessings. It seems like
[31:36] easy.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Either you'll get one of those or you'll
[31:40] wrestle for yours. But listen, God knows
[31:42] what kind of blessings you need.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; God knows if you're weak and struggling,
[31:46] he might just give you a blessing.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Or you might be weak and struggling and
[31:50] God might make you wrestle for that
[31:51] blessing so you won't be weak and
[31:53] struggling anymore. And the church said,
[31:56] &gt;&gt; "See that God knew Jacob need to
[31:58] overcome fear." So he had to really get
[32:01] a supernatural experience with God. He
[32:03] had to plead with God. He had to he had
[32:05] to just spend time with God until he got
[32:08] what he needed. And he knew he could
[32:11] prevail. If he could prevail against
[32:12] God, well, surely I could prevail
[32:14] against Esau, my brother.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; But it's God letting Jacob win.
[32:23] All right.
[32:25] And he wept and made supplication. Oh, I
[32:27] forgot about that. See, church, there's
[32:29] times God wants you to weep and cry it
[32:31] out and then God will give you what you
[32:33] have need of.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; There's something about crying when
[32:36] you're praying, church. There's
[32:38] something about crying when you pray.
[32:40] God loves that so much because look, we
[32:43] got it here. He gets the baptism of the
[32:44] Holy Ghost in type.
[32:47] But we also get it in Ezekiel 9 where
[32:49] the Bible said, "Mark all those that
[32:51] sigh and cry for the abominations done
[32:53] in this city."
[32:54] &gt;&gt; And God God lets the writer with the
[32:56] inkorn mark him on his on their
[32:58] foreheads.
[33:00] And brother Ram said, "How many houses
[33:02] do you think tonight in Jeffersonville?"
[33:03] Let me bring it down here. How many
[33:04] houses in Akran or Fire is it Firestone?
[33:07] You live in Firestone.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; What was it?
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Cam Cameron. Kenmore, I'm sorry.
[33:14] Kenmore. Yeah. Sorry. How many houses in
[33:16] Kenmore are people praying against all
[33:18] the abortions and the trans surgeries
[33:21] and the murders? How many were praying
[33:23] last night? Brother Ram says,
[33:25] &gt;&gt; in other words, who could God have
[33:26] marked last night in your home?
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Well, I just say like this. If I didn't
[33:31] do my home last night, I'm going to do
[33:33] it in church today.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; And I did. This morning, I did.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; I was crying and I was crying for all
[33:39] the abominations done in Akran.
[33:43] Hallelujah. There's something about that
[33:45] God loves when people hate sin
[33:48] &gt;&gt; and cry, God will mark them with the
[33:50] Holy Ghost.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; And there's also something when you pray
[33:54] and you want the baptism of the Holy
[33:56] Ghost and you cry for it. God, we should
[33:58] shed tears for the baptism of the Holy
[34:00] Ghost. I'm looking at brother Chris
[34:01] because he's been praying for it. You
[34:02] should you brother, you should pray
[34:03] until you cry for it. And then I got a
[34:06] good feeling God will give you the Holy
[34:07] Ghost. Praise God.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:10] But if it happens, we'll all know it
[34:12] happened
[34:13] &gt;&gt; because we'll see your life afterwards.
[34:14] Something's changed about that brother.
[34:16] Something's changed about that sister.
[34:24] All right. So now we can see the angel
[34:27] Lord, Abraham, Jacob, because the
[34:30] covenant was connected to them. The
[34:33] covenant of God's people, right? Israel
[34:37] became God's people. Hallelujah. through
[34:39] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and down down
[34:42] through the line even to this day.
[34:43] Praise God. The people of Israel.
[34:47] Now, the next one is Moses. Exodus
[34:49] chapter 3.
[34:52] Moses is on the back side of the
[34:54] mountain or back side of the desert
[34:56] rather. And in verse two, the angel Lord
[34:58] appeared in him. That's the angel of
[34:59] Jehovah. We'll say the angel of the
[35:03] self-existing one. This ain't just a
[35:05] regular angel. This is God.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God comes out in the angel form.
[35:13] He appears unto him in the flame of a
[35:14] fire of the midst of the bush. And he
[35:16] looked and behold the bush burned with
[35:18] fire and the bush was not consumed. I
[35:20] love how sight and sound picked that up.
[35:24] They had a bush that was burning but it
[35:26] wasn't consumed. And that's what
[35:28] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego could
[35:30] say the same thing. We were in a fire
[35:33] not consumed.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Right? Because men are like trees. Ah,
[35:37] amen. In other words, the bush was like
[35:39] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, right?
[35:42] And God's fires there, they're not
[35:44] burning, right? And God's fires here,
[35:47] they're not burning. God knows how to
[35:49] deliver you.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God doesn't need lessons on,
[35:54] I wonder how I could work this out, this
[35:56] formula, how to deliver brother so- and
[35:58] so or sister so- and so. God don't need
[36:00] any ideas on that. He's already got it
[36:02] figured out. Hallelujah.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; It's his angel. He's going to send his
[36:06] angel. Hallelujah. And the angel will
[36:08] deliver you.
[36:15] Now we know this is the angel of the
[36:16] Lord. Verse uh
[36:22] here he says uh yeah the Lord verse
[36:25] four. And when the Lord saw that yeah
[36:26] the Lord saw that he turned aside to see
[36:29] God called unto him out of the midst of
[36:30] the bush and said Moses Moses. And he
[36:33] said here am I. Doesn't that sound
[36:34] familiar? Abraham, Abraham, Moses,
[36:37] Moses, Samuel, Samuel. And the church
[36:40] said,
[36:40] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[36:41] &gt;&gt; So, be listening in your in your dream,
[36:43] church. Be listening. If God calls your
[36:46] name, he's probably going to call it
[36:47] twice.
[36:48] Haven, Haven,
[36:51] Chris, Chris,
[36:53] Malachi, Malachi. That's how God likes
[36:56] to call names twice.
[36:58] One time I was preaching in line. My
[37:00] brother Vang might have been there.
[37:03] And uh before service we were praying
[37:04] and uh sister Karen Sanders let out this
[37:07] scream and she said, "I am here. I am
[37:10] here. God is here. I am here." And I
[37:13] preached I don't remember what message
[37:14] it was, brother Vang. At the end at the
[37:17] end of that message, sister Karen got
[37:19] under the spirit again and called out,
[37:20] "Alahoo, alahu." Do you remember that
[37:22] brother? I don't know if you remember
[37:23] that. I I I faintly remember him coming
[37:25] up to the altar and that brother is
[37:27] brother Brooks's son come up to the
[37:28] altar and she basically to gave him some
[37:31] different warnings about what he was
[37:32] doing the night before. But I remember
[37:35] that because it was alahu alahu. It was
[37:37] twice just like here. Moses Moses.
[37:42] Hallelujah. Now what should our answer
[37:45] be? If it's vang vang what should our
[37:47] answer be? Here I am. Here's your
[37:48] servant. Praise God. I'm reporting.
[37:51] Amen. I'm reporting to my duty, my my
[37:53] post of duty. What do you want your
[37:55] servant to know? Praise God.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:00] Remember, I preached on death recently.
[38:02] Now, and then the your father passed
[38:04] that night.
[38:07] So, I I not I'm not saying this is going
[38:09] to happen, but let's be watching this
[38:11] week if God would speak to us in a dream
[38:13] or some other way
[38:16] because I don't I didn't really plan to
[38:17] preach on this till last night.
[38:20] I was going to preach on God hiding
[38:21] himself in simplicity. I've got I've got
[38:22] a bride age sermon, sister. I got a
[38:24] bride age sermon ready for you and your
[38:25] sister your sisters,
[38:28] but I was just waiting for the right
[38:29] timing. I just kind of felt inspired by
[38:31] this because I wanted to encourage the
[38:32] people that the angel of the Lord camps
[38:34] around you.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said that angel of the Lord
[38:40] Jesus Christ was setting in that bush
[38:43] the pillar of fire that led the children
[38:45] of Israel through the wilderness. And
[38:47] any teacher knows that the angel of the
[38:49] covenant was Jesus Christ. So brother
[38:52] Ram says it's Jesus Christ calling out
[38:54] Moses, Moses. And that's right because
[38:55] in the book of Hebrews, the Bible says
[38:57] that Moses uh served God or he forsook
[39:02] everything for the sake of Christ.
[39:05] So brother Chris, it says that. Let's
[39:06] read that. Let's keep your place there.
[39:08] I'd like to show that to brother Chris.
[39:10] Uh keep your place in Exodus 3. Go to
[39:12] Hebrews 11. And that just came to me now
[39:15] as a review or reminder from the Holy
[39:17] Spirit. I I hope
[39:22] if you can find that, let me know. Here
[39:24] we'll go down to Moses.
[39:31] Yeah, there it is, brother. Verse 26.
[39:33] 11:26. Brother Chris.
[39:36] So, see this proves God in the Old
[39:39] Testament was Jesus Christ. And the
[39:41] church said,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; brother said, "The God Jehovah the Old
[39:44] Testament is Jesus Christ of the New."
[39:47] Amen. Not a second person, not a
[39:49] different person. It's the same God.
[39:51] Hallelujah.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Not a second person. It's Jesus Christ.
[39:55] God. Jesus Christ is God.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Chris, this proves it right
[39:59] here. Esteeming the reproach of who?
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Christ. So, Moses valued the reproach of
[40:06] Christ. It was is more valuable and than
[40:09] the greater riches than the treasures in
[40:11] Egypt. Who is Moses following? Christ.
[40:14] Who is Christ? The anointed. The
[40:16] anointed of the Holy Ghost, the angel of
[40:18] the Lord. In other words, the logos,
[40:21] brother. He has seen the reproach of the
[40:23] logos, the word. Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Greater than the riches of Christ.
[40:30] Hallelujah. Is that is that becoming
[40:32] more clear to everybody? Whenever you
[40:34] see the angel Lord all throughout the
[40:36] Old Testament, it's Jesus,
[40:38] &gt;&gt; not the body that was conceived in Mary,
[40:40] but it's the spirit of God. Jesus
[40:42] Christ.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense, brother Chris? Is
[40:46] that okay? Amen. So, other words, Jesus
[40:50] was talking to Moses in the burning
[40:52] bush.
[40:53] And then Jesus talked to Moses and
[40:55] Elijah on Mount Transfiguration.
[40:57] Hallelujah.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen.
[41:02] Moses would have been like, "Oh yeah,
[41:03] I've seen you before." Hallelujah. This
[41:05] is God. This is God and a man.
[41:07] Hallelujah. I've seen him before.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Same man, same spirit, same God,
[41:15] same character, same nature. I'm the
[41:17] Lord thy God. I'm the Christ of God and
[41:20] I change not.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I
[41:22] &gt;&gt; feel like preaching now. Amen.
[41:25] Hallelujah.
[41:27] Go back to uh well, since we're here, go
[41:29] to 1 Corinthians 10.
[41:32] We'll show brother Chris another proof
[41:34] of that just because he's fresh to the
[41:36] message here.
[41:38] It's uh 1 Corinthians 10:4. And did all
[41:41] drink the same spiritual drink, speaking
[41:43] of Israel in the days of Moses, for they
[41:45] drank of that spiritual rock that
[41:46] followed them. And that rock was Christ
[41:50] Jesus. Hallelujah. The same God. He's
[41:54] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8.
[42:02] Brother Brandham said that was Jesus
[42:04] Christ. The angel Lord out of the
[42:06] speaking out of the burning bush was
[42:07] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Now back
[42:12] to Exodus 3. Hopefully you got one of
[42:14] those uh bookmarks like I do in my
[42:16] Bible.
[42:20] Verse five. And he said, "Draw not nigh
[42:22] hither. put off thy shoes from off thy
[42:24] feet, for the place whereupon thou
[42:26] standest is holy ground.
[42:29] Moreover, he said, I am the God
[42:33] of sorry, God of Abraham, God of Isaac,
[42:35] the God of Jacob. See the covenant he's
[42:38] keeping his covenant with the Israeli
[42:40] people. He's and this is the angel of
[42:42] the Lord. This is God and an angel
[42:45] making sure his covenant is kept. Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And Moses hid his face for he was afraid
[42:52] to look upon God. Amen.
[42:58] Now I love down I love in verse 13.
[43:00] Moses says, "Who do I say that sent me?"
[43:02] Go to verse 14. And God and said unto
[43:04] Moses, I am that I am.
[43:08] Amen. And then brother Chris Jesus told
[43:11] the Pharisees before Abraham was I am.
[43:15] Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So Jesus tells the
[43:19] Pharisees, "I was the I am that talked
[43:21] to Moses." And so that means I was
[43:23] before Moses and I was before Abraham.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; I'm the God of eternity. Jesus was
[43:29] telling them, "I am God in flesh."
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[43:35] Oh my. I am that I am. And he said,
[43:38] "Thou shalt say unto the children of
[43:39] Israel, I am hath sent me unto you."
[43:44] God's name is I am.
[43:48] Hallelujah.
[43:52] So now we see what that's three. Three
[43:55] angels of the Lord. Let me give you
[43:56] another one. A fourth one. Joshua.
[43:58] Joshua chapter 5:E 13. We preach the
[44:00] whole book of Joshua by God's grace.
[44:03] So this ought to this ought to be able
[44:05] to draw on a little bit of your
[44:06] long-term memory here. By God's grace.
[44:08] Verse 13. And it came to pass when
[44:10] Joshua was by Jericho that he lift up
[44:11] his eyes and looked and behold there
[44:13] stood a man over against him with his
[44:14] sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went
[44:16] unto him and said unto him, "Art thou
[44:18] for us or for our adversaries? Are you
[44:21] on our side or the enemy's side?"
[44:24] And he said, "Nay, neither."
[44:28] Amen. I'm not taking sides with anybody.
[44:30] In other words, I'm God. Hallelujah.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; You got to be on my side. Hallelujah.
[44:37] But as the captain of the host of the
[44:39] Lord, I am now come. And Joshua fell on
[44:41] his face to the earth and did worship.
[44:43] See, now if he wasn't God, God would
[44:45] have said, "Don't worship me. Don't
[44:46] worship angels."
[44:48] But this captain let Joshua worship him.
[44:52] So this captain was more than just a
[44:54] man, more than an angel. It was God in
[44:57] angel form
[44:59] &gt;&gt; because he accepted worship.
[45:02] And the church said,
[45:08] And he said unto him,
[45:10] "What saith my lord unto his servants?"
[45:13] So look now, now it's not about whose
[45:15] side you're on. Now it's like, "Oh,
[45:16] that's right. I'm your servant."
[45:18] This isn't my war. This is God's war.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Church,
[45:24] your battles aren't your battles.
[45:26] They're God's battles.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; You and I, we're nobody special. So we
[45:31] should not make it out like this is my
[45:32] life and my journey and this is my great
[45:34] adventure. This is God's plan for our
[45:36] lives.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Look at Charlie Kirk. We we all would
[45:39] have thought he would have been the
[45:40] president someday. But see, God's got
[45:42] different ideas for than what we have.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Right? 31 years old, God said, "That's
[45:47] good." Like I told Malachi, at 31 years
[45:50] old, God would have told the devil,
[45:51] "It's okay. Go ahead and take his life."
[45:53] But actually, the angels will be there
[45:54] to take the to pack his soul to heaven.
[45:58] See church, that's why we cry so much
[46:00] because we thought, wow, we we think
[46:01] there's so much m potential for people,
[46:03] young people that die. But God's ways
[46:06] are better than our ways. Hallelujah.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; And we have to look at this like this
[46:10] isn't my war. This isn't my life. This
[46:12] isn't my battle. I'm just here for God's
[46:15] glory. We need that perspective, right,
[46:18] sister?
[46:19] We need the job perspective
[46:22] that I'm just here because I'm just
[46:24] doing God's service. Nothing special
[46:26] about me. And the church said,
[46:29] &gt;&gt; "Oh, you're the bride. You're the
[46:31] greatest Christians ever." All these
[46:32] things. No, no. I I'm nobody. I'm just
[46:35] here to do God's service.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; I'm God's servant.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; I'm nobody great. I'm nobody special.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:50] Verse 15. And the captain of the Lord's
[46:52] host said unto him, "Loose thy shoe from
[46:54] off thy foot, for the place where on
[46:56] thou standest is holy." And Joshua did
[46:58] so. So brother said, "This is Joshua
[47:00] getting his Moses moment." This is
[47:03] Joshua getting his burning bush moment.
[47:05] And brother Ram said, "All of us need a
[47:07] burning bush experience."
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Where you can learn
[47:11] more about God in five minutes than four
[47:14] years at a seminary."
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You need an experience
[47:20] with God where you wrestle with God. You
[47:22] you feel God's presence. You know God
[47:24] presence. And when you become born
[47:26] again, then you'll act like a servant,
[47:28] not like a boss.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Now, as a pastor, I'm I have to lead,
[47:31] right? As as a pastor, I have to lead
[47:33] the church like a shepherd leads the
[47:34] flock. Brother says, "Somebody's got to
[47:36] make the decisions around here,
[47:38] &gt;&gt; right?" He said, "Any any person with
[47:40] two heads would be a monster," he says.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Right? So just like a just like a flock
[47:46] has to has one leader, a pastor has to
[47:48] have one leader. And church, you all
[47:49] know this, a family has to have one
[47:51] leader, too.
[47:53] That's the way God sets it up.
[47:55] Hallelujah.
[47:57] But what we need, we need experience
[47:58] with God that we can that that now as
[48:01] leaders, especially our husbands and
[48:03] husbands of families and pastors, that
[48:05] we don't look at ourselves as some big
[48:07] buddy, but how can I serve the people of
[48:09] God? That's why I chose to preach this
[48:12] sermon today because I thought it might
[48:13] help you more. I want to try to serve
[48:15] you. In my mind, I want to get my s my
[48:17] my my my series done, Brother Mercy. I'd
[48:19] like to get the God hiding himself done
[48:21] and Corinthians, but I'm trying to think
[48:23] of how can I serve the people? What
[48:25] would bless the saints today?
[48:28] What would further Claude and Patrick's
[48:31] experience with God today?
[48:33] Hallelujah.
[48:36] So I thought well maybe the angel of the
[48:38] Lord would encourage brother mercy
[48:39] today. Hallelujah.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said the Joshua the angel
[48:47] Lord that led Israel is the Lord Jesus
[48:49] Christ. So Joshua met the Lord Jesus
[48:52] Christ standing there brother Chris
[48:54] that's the Lord Jesus Christ. Same God
[48:57] that Moses met. Same God that Jacob
[48:59] wrestled with. Amen. Same God that
[49:02] Abraham talked to.
[49:04] same God all the time. It's the angel of
[49:07] the Lord. It's the God angel. I'll say
[49:09] it like that. Everybody got that?
[49:13] Now, here's here's the next one. I got a
[49:16] couple more here. I've only been
[49:19] preaching 43 minutes. Praise God. Amen.
[49:22] We got plenty of time. You I'm looking
[49:23] at people. Sometimes we look a little
[49:24] tired or quiet. That's okay.
[49:27] I get tired and quiet at home, too.
[49:29] We're at a home church. Uh, but I just
[49:32] don't want I don't want to take you too
[49:33] long here. Uh, like like brother Ram
[49:35] said, some people fill up easy. They
[49:36] just need a little preaching and then
[49:37] everything after that. But some, brother
[49:39] Ram said, some people fill up long, too.
[49:42] Some people got a big cup and they like
[49:43] to hear a lot about the word.
[49:46] Hallelujah. I guess brother Irvin, my
[49:48] wife said when brother Irvin was here,
[49:50] he says, he says, "Everybody's got a
[49:51] cup, but you just don't want to if if
[49:53] you put too much in there, it just
[49:54] overflows." He said something like that.
[49:56] But that's what the Bible says. My cup
[49:58] runth over. So if you get an extra long
[50:00] sermon, you're just fulfilling Psalm 23.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; My cup runs over. And the church said,
[50:07] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Acts 27:23.
[50:11] Now, we know this. Brother Ram said,
[50:14] "God gave the Old Testament to Moses,
[50:16] and he had an angel."
[50:18] And then, Brother Ram said, God
[50:21] interpreted the Old Testament, wrote the
[50:22] New Testament with I'm sorry, God gave
[50:24] the New Testament with Paul because Paul
[50:26] had an angel. And then this is in what
[50:29] uh what house will you build me 1965.
[50:31] Then brother Ram says he doesn't call
[50:33] himself but he says but then God sent me
[50:35] out to the desert as well to get the
[50:37] revelation of both the old testament and
[50:39] the new testament. So let me say that
[50:41] again a little more clearly. God sent
[50:43] Moses to the desert and met him in the
[50:46] desert and gave him the old testament.
[50:48] God sent Paul in the desert. Hallelujah.
[50:51] Desert of Arabia and gave him the New
[50:53] Testament. God sends brother Brandham to
[50:56] the desert in 1963 and gets the
[50:58] revelation of all of it. Praise God.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Everybody catch that.
[51:04] So God wrote the Old Testament with
[51:06] Moses. God uh wrote the New Testament
[51:08] with Paul. God sends brother Bram to
[51:10] finish all the mysteries of all
[51:12] testaments.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Now, some churches,
[51:17] they'd be shouting over that church,
[51:18] just so you know. But maybe you've heard
[51:20] it before, or maybe you don't quite
[51:21] understand it. Well, maybe God will give
[51:22] you revelation in your time and season.
[51:26] Amen. Thank God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:29] Now, Paul is in a ship with prisoners
[51:32] and he would and that night in
[51:33] particular, he was in the bottom of the
[51:34] ship praying. And he says in verse 23,
[51:38] "For there stood be stood by me this
[51:40] night the angel of God whose I am." Now,
[51:44] that to me looks like it's the angel of
[51:46] the Lord Jesus Christ,
[51:49] but it could also mean his guardian
[51:51] angel. I'm just letting you know. I'm
[51:52] what I'm saying is I'm not certain on
[51:53] which angel this is. But either way,
[51:56] whatever angel this was, it told him,
[51:57] "Thus sayith the Lord, and it came to
[51:59] pass."
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. All night Paul's down
[52:03] praying in the boat, and he comes up and
[52:05] he says, "The the angel of God, whose I
[52:08] belong to, and the angel I serve,"
[52:12] said, "Fear not, Paul. Thou must be
[52:15] brought before Caesar, and lo, God given
[52:17] thee all them that sail with thee.
[52:20] Wherefore, sers, be of good cheer, for I
[52:22] believe God that it shall be even as it
[52:24] was told unto me. Imagine he's he comes
[52:26] up. He says, "Thus sayith the Lord,
[52:28] everyone that's in this boat is going to
[52:29] live." And church, there's been storms.
[52:31] They haven't eaten for 14 days, brother
[52:33] Chris. Two weeks, they haven't even
[52:34] eaten. They're just drinking water for
[52:37] 14 days. And he said, "Not one of you is
[52:40] going to lose your life. Thus sayith the
[52:41] Lord." Now, that's a real man of God
[52:43] right there. Amen. That man knows what
[52:45] he's talking about, brother. Amen.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:50] But look, he had an angel as well as
[52:53] angel guided him throughout his
[52:54] ministry.
[52:59] Now, we could go to Peter and all these
[53:00] things, but I forgot another Moses one.
[53:02] Let's go back to Exodus 32, church. I
[53:05] pardon me. I skipped over this. No, I'm
[53:07] sorry. It's Exodus 23. My My fault. I
[53:09] said it wrong.
[53:11] I've been putting all these numbers into
[53:12] my notes and they get mixed up
[53:14] sometimes. Exodus 23.
[53:20] verse 20.
[53:22] If you know this, this is uh Mount Si.
[53:24] They just got the the law on tables of
[53:26] stone in chapter 20.
[53:30] So, this is fresh uh uh fresh with a
[53:32] brand Well, I'm sorry, with a advanced
[53:34] covenant, the covenant, the of Mos
[53:36] Moses, the Mosaic covenant, right? The
[53:38] ten commands. They have a new covenant.
[53:40] Verse 20 23:20. Behold, I send an angel
[53:44] before thee to keep thee in the way.
[53:46] Church, what a confirmation.
[53:50] Think of church. They're going to go
[53:51] through many wars, but how does God
[53:53] encourage him? He said, "You're going to
[53:54] fight many battles, but don't worry, the
[53:56] angels going before you."
[53:59] &gt;&gt; In other words, you have somebody,
[54:00] Brother Chris, going before you to make
[54:02] sure you get to where you're supposed to
[54:04] go.
[54:06] You have somebody going before you to
[54:08] make sure you can accomplish what I've
[54:09] called you to do.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. In other words,
[54:12] brother Mercy, I'm not in this alone,
[54:15] Brother Patrick. I'm not fighting this
[54:16] by myself. God's fighting for me.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; And he sent me supernatural help that I
[54:22] can keep pastoring my family and
[54:24] pastoring Bride of Christ Fellowship and
[54:26] you can find a job. Hallelujah. And have
[54:28] a family and get ready for the rapture.
[54:30] God sent his angel to get you there.
[54:32] Praise God.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you like this, brother Mercy.
[54:36] An angel went before me to Akran
[54:38] because I didn't even know where Akran
[54:40] was on the map. Neither did Naomi and
[54:41] Beatatric. Amen. Neither did the Mong
[54:44] people know where Akran was. Right. God
[54:46] sent his angel to prepare the way. He
[54:48] prepared a place for you, a home for
[54:50] you. And not just a natural home, a
[54:53] spiritual home, a home church.
[54:54] Hallelujah.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; How many people have emailed me over the
[54:58] years and wish they had a home church
[54:59] they could go to? And they say, "Well,
[55:01] brother Justin, you're like my pastor uh
[55:02] because I don't have a home church." And
[55:04] I feel so sorry for them, but God's
[55:06] angel went before us to give us a
[55:08] physical home and a spiritual home. We
[55:11] ought to rejoice that God's angels are
[55:12] here.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; And they're going to make sure God's
[55:16] job, God's will is done in your life.
[55:19] Hallelujah.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Before the rapture, before you're taken
[55:23] home. Hallelujah.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Like brother Ram said, if they ever tell
[55:27] you, "Brother Ram's dead, don't believe
[55:28] him." He said, "Because I'm more alive
[55:31] than I've ever been." Amen. When
[55:34] Brother's soul and spirit left that
[55:36] body, he was more alive than he'd ever
[55:39] been.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; I think Billy Graham said that, too. If
[55:43] the word ever gets out, I've died. Don't
[55:45] believe him. I'm more alive. I'm in a
[55:47] better place, more alive. I got greater
[55:49] life. I've got eternal life. I'm more
[55:51] alive than I've ever been.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And think of it. If we got the Holy
[55:56] Ghost, we got a portion and earnest of
[55:58] that right now. Hallelujah.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; We have a portion of that eternal life
[56:04] right now. It makes us rejoice and talk
[56:06] about the wonderful works of God.
[56:08] Hallelujah.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] Oh, let his angels strengthen me to
[56:12] preach today.
[56:14] Amen.
[56:15] Like brother Brandham said, I'll get to
[56:18] that.
[56:21] So, church, the angel will keep you in
[56:24] the way God's called, God's sending you.
[56:27] He sent before you and to bring thee
[56:30] into the place which I prepared. Look,
[56:32] God already had a place prepared for us.
[56:34] Hallelujah.
[56:38] Verse 21. Beware of him and obey his
[56:40] voice. Provoke him not. In other words,
[56:42] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[56:44] whereby you're sealed to the day of your
[56:46] redemption,
[56:48] for he will not pardon your
[56:49] transgressions, for my name is in him.
[56:52] Now, that just means you're going to be
[56:53] chasened. You're going to get spanked
[56:54] for what you do on this earth. Right?
[56:57] But your your sins are already forgiven
[56:59] in heaven, right? We talked about that
[57:00] with Job. Job had to live with his his
[57:04] fear that he let he let himself get a
[57:06] great fear. He spoke against God. He had
[57:08] to live with the consequences of his
[57:10] sins. But in heaven, he's already
[57:12] forgiven.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
[57:15] &gt;&gt; In other words, glory. In other words,
[57:17] this life is the only time I'm going to
[57:19] have to deal with the consequences to my
[57:21] sin
[57:22] &gt;&gt; because the next life all my sin's been
[57:24] washed away. Praise God.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a comfort to know. Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a blessing it would be then
[57:31] for us if if we die here. What a
[57:33] blessing it would be to know that where
[57:34] we're going, there's no punishment for
[57:36] sin. We just have to deal with it now.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; And I love that.
[57:50] I will be an enemy to your enemies.
[57:53] Listen, church. God will not be mocked.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; If you're doing what's right, God will
[57:59] fight for you and he'll be against the
[58:01] people that are against you. Right?
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Doesn't the Bible say God will silence
[58:06] all the voices that try to speak out
[58:08] against you? I believe
[58:09] &gt;&gt; I don't I'm not quoting that exactly.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; But think about that, church. You have
[58:13] not you don't have to fight for
[58:14] yourself. God will fight for you.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:21] Now look at verse uh 23. For mine angels
[58:24] should go before thee, and bring thee in
[58:26] unto the Amorites, the Hittites, the
[58:27] Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites,
[58:29] the Jebusites, and I will cut them off,
[58:32] the Leoites. I'll just say like that.
[58:34] All the demon powers we got to drive
[58:36] out.
[58:40] Okay. Now, oh, actually, you know what?
[58:43] Let's let me encourage you. Go down to
[58:45] verse 30. Let's read that,
[58:48] church. Here's what I hope for today. I
[58:50] hope somebody today just gets a little
[58:52] victory today.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope somebody gets a if you
[58:56] needed a full deliverance, that's
[58:58] available today, too. because the
[58:59] angel's here encamps around you to
[59:01] deliver you.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; But God but God told Moses, "My angel's
[59:05] going to go before you." And he said,
[59:07] "Little by little,
[59:10] I'll drive them out from before thee
[59:12] until thou be increased and inherit the
[59:14] land."
[59:16] &gt;&gt; That's what you should expect from every
[59:17] service, brother Nia. A little more
[59:19] strength, a little more victory,
[59:22] &gt;&gt; and then we get we get extra blessings.
[59:24] Some services we get a tremendous amount
[59:26] of help or we get or like Adam gets
[59:29] delivered from a 27-year addiction.
[59:31] Amen. Praise God. That's more than a
[59:33] little. That's a lot. Hallelujah.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; That's a greater blessing. That's a
[59:37] greater portion of Holy Ghost uh
[59:39] blessing by the grace of God.
[59:40] Hallelujah.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; But your promise every day, every
[59:45] service, you get a little stronger,
[59:46] brother Mercy.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; I get a little stronger in the high
[59:49] schools. Right, Claude and Patrick?
[59:51] Right, Anna? get a little stronger in
[59:53] the middle school when I'm when I'm
[59:55] walking in God's plan for my life.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Right, brother Chris? A little stronger
[1:00:00] on the job. Hallelujah. Every day he
[1:00:03] said, "A little by little, I'll give you
[1:00:05] a little more power, little more
[1:00:07] strength, little more boldness." Right,
[1:00:09] Malachi? On the job, I'll give you a
[1:00:10] little more every time. Praise God.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; It took me uh it took me 10 years before
[1:00:19] I started Bible club. So, Brother Bank,
[1:00:21] it took a little courage, a little
[1:00:22] courage every year until I had enough
[1:00:24] courage to do Bible club in the public
[1:00:27] schools. I thought, "Oh, they're going
[1:00:29] to sue me. Oh, they're going to kick me
[1:00:30] out." It's been nothing but a blessing.
[1:00:31] Praise God. Hallelujah. But, see, it's a
[1:00:34] little bit of courage. A little more. A
[1:00:36] little more. A little more. And now I
[1:00:38] don't care what anybody says. I used to
[1:00:41] be afraid, Brother Chris. What are
[1:00:42] people going to say about him? What What
[1:00:43] What are they going to do when he
[1:00:45] doesn't laugh? Now I don't even care.
[1:00:47] I've got God's given us victory upon
[1:00:49] victory. He's making us go higher and
[1:00:51] higher. The light is shining more bright
[1:00:54] unto the perfect day.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; It's little victory after little
[1:01:00] victory. Just get some victory today.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; What can you learn today? Write that
[1:01:05] down and focus on that. What's the one
[1:01:08] thing out of all this hourl long sermon?
[1:01:10] What's the one thing you can put into
[1:01:12] practice tomorrow?
[1:01:14] What little victory could you get today?
[1:01:18] I'm talking about a victory. I'm talking
[1:01:19] about gaining ground, right? What ground
[1:01:23] can you gain on the devil today? That's
[1:01:25] what I want you to have. Praise God. How
[1:01:28] many want that by God's grace?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; This is God.
[1:01:35] So, we see Abraham, Jacob, Moses,
[1:01:40] Joshua, St. Paul, and I like this one.
[1:01:43] This one applies to us, brother
[1:01:45] Brandham. Let's go to Revelation chapter
[1:01:47] 10. Hallelujah.
[1:01:50] Oh, glory. And I preached this. Remember
[1:01:51] a couple months ago, I preached this or
[1:01:52] a couple weeks I said, "Wait till I
[1:01:53] preach on the angel Lord." I didn't know
[1:01:55] it was going to happen today till
[1:01:57] yesterday.
[1:02:01] Oh, there's an hour. Okay. Glory.
[1:02:06] One more to go. Brother Chris.
[1:02:09] Amen.
[1:02:11] I know. I app I know. I appreciate
[1:02:13] Chris's Chris's testimonial. He don't
[1:02:14] he's the only one in this family that's
[1:02:16] serving God. What imagine what peace he
[1:02:19] must experience. Praise God. Chris being
[1:02:21] raised in the world, raised around all
[1:02:23] that sin and brother, now you come into
[1:02:24] the house of God. What peace you must
[1:02:26] experience.
[1:02:28] Hallelujah. Yeah, I also do. That's
[1:02:31] right. Amen. I love it. I love it.
[1:02:36] Revelation 10.
[1:02:41] Now church, you all know this. And I saw
[1:02:43] a mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:02:44] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:02:46] upon his head and his face as it were
[1:02:48] the sun. Now in re Yeah, we'll read this
[1:02:50] here. And his feet as pillars of fire.
[1:02:53] Now keep your spot there. You got the
[1:02:54] bookmark? Keep your spot there. Go to
[1:02:56] Revelation 1:15 and 16. Just again, just
[1:02:59] to freshly uh review this. This is not
[1:03:01] just a regular angel. This is the mighty
[1:03:04] angel. This is the angel of the Lord.
[1:03:10] Revelation 1:15. And his feet like unto
[1:03:13] fine brass. Well, there's the brass on
[1:03:15] the feet. And if as if they burn in a
[1:03:18] furnace, and his voice was a sound of
[1:03:19] many waters, and he had his right hand
[1:03:21] seven stars, and out of his mouth went a
[1:03:23] sharp sword. And his countenance was as
[1:03:25] the sun shineth in his strength. So this
[1:03:29] angel has the same attributes of Jesus.
[1:03:32] Face like the sun, feet like brass. Now
[1:03:35] go back to Revelation 10.
[1:03:37] And he had in his hand a little book
[1:03:39] open. And that was the book from
[1:03:40] Revelation 45 and 6 that wasn't open.
[1:03:44] But now the book's open. In other words,
[1:03:47] now the Bible mysteries can be revealed.
[1:03:50] Hallelujah.
[1:03:52] Amen.
[1:03:53] And he set his right foot up foot upon
[1:03:55] the sea and his left upon the earth. In
[1:03:58] other words, he has dominion over land
[1:04:00] and sea. Christ does. And he cried with
[1:04:03] a loud voice as when a lion roarth. And
[1:04:05] remember Amos 37 and8 says that when a
[1:04:07] prophet roars it's like a lion.
[1:04:12] And when he had cried, seven thunders
[1:04:14] uttered their voices. Hallelujah. And
[1:04:17] when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:04:19] their voices, I was about to write, and
[1:04:20] I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto
[1:04:21] me, Seal up those things which the seven
[1:04:23] thunders uttered, and write them not.
[1:04:25] And the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:04:27] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[1:04:29] hand to heaven, and swear by him that
[1:04:32] liveth forever and ever, who created
[1:04:33] heaven and things that are there are in,
[1:04:35] and the earth and the things that there
[1:04:37] are in, and the sea and and that are
[1:04:39] there and are, and the sea, and the
[1:04:40] things that which are therein, that
[1:04:43] there should be time no longer, but in
[1:04:45] the days of the seventh, I'm sorry, but
[1:04:47] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:04:48] angel, when he should begin to sound,
[1:04:50] the mystery of God should be finished,
[1:04:52] as he hath declared unto his servants,
[1:04:54] the prophets,
[1:04:56] Hallelujah. So here we get another
[1:04:58] picture of the angel of the Lord. God in
[1:05:02] an angel form comes down with an open
[1:05:05] book and gives the book to the seventh
[1:05:07] angel who's on earth. And then God
[1:05:10] declares the mysteries finished.
[1:05:13] Hallelujah. There's no more. All these
[1:05:15] seven seal mysteries have now been
[1:05:18] revealed to us. Church.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And church remember it not only
[1:05:22] revealed what the antichrist was because
[1:05:24] right the first four writers are
[1:05:25] antichrist writers. It also revealed the
[1:05:28] anointings on the church. The four
[1:05:32] beasts. Praise God. So in this we have
[1:05:34] we have now Satan is unmasked. Think
[1:05:36] about that church. Before the seals the
[1:05:39] denominations they were just trying to
[1:05:40] fight like they're like beating the air,
[1:05:42] right? They had a blindfold. They don't
[1:05:44] they didn't even know that setting up
[1:05:45] their own denominations was antichrist.
[1:05:48] Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; In other words, they weren't defeating
[1:05:50] the antichrist system. They would just
[1:05:52] go, brother Ang from one revival,
[1:05:54] Lutheran, Methodist, Isuza, uh, CMA,
[1:05:58] Assembly of God. They would just go from
[1:06:00] one denomination to the next. But God
[1:06:03] come down. Christ come down. He opened
[1:06:05] the seals. And now Satan's been exposed.
[1:06:08] And now it's like the church can put on
[1:06:10] her glasses or she can take off her
[1:06:11] blindfold. And now she can defeat the
[1:06:14] Antichrist spirit by the anointing of
[1:06:16] God on her. And now the Bible's a brand
[1:06:19] new Bible and now we understand real
[1:06:22] religion and we can have that old time
[1:06:24] religion. Hallelujah.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise God. Brother said the
[1:06:28] Bible became a new Bible. Remember our
[1:06:31] preacher, brother Claude, the complete
[1:06:32] revelation of Jesus Christ. Remember I
[1:06:34] preached that last year? I don't know if
[1:06:36] you guys remember that, but I wanted to
[1:06:38] do a series on that, but I I took that
[1:06:40] quote from Brother Bram. The Bible
[1:06:41] became a new Bible. It's the complete
[1:06:43] revelation of Jesus Christ. And now,
[1:06:46] brother Chris, now we see Jesus Christ
[1:06:48] talking to Abraham. Now we see him
[1:06:50] talking to Moses, Joshua. Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] Jacob, Paul, and now we see him giving
[1:06:57] the revelation to William Brandom.
[1:06:59] Praise God.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; That's why we can put William Brandom in
[1:07:02] our songs. We always sang about Noah on
[1:07:04] the wings of a snow white dove, right?
[1:07:06] We sang about Noah. We sang about David
[1:07:08] Sling, the battle belongs to the Lord.
[1:07:10] We can sing about all these men, but now
[1:07:12] we can sing about brother Brandham
[1:07:14] because he met the angel of the Lord as
[1:07:16] well.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; He said, he said he went out and seven
[1:07:21] angels met him and told him to go back.
[1:07:23] And then brother said, "The Lord Jesus,
[1:07:25] the Holy Spirit met me every day to
[1:07:28] reveal the revelation of each seal." And
[1:07:31] when he got done, he preached, he said,
[1:07:32] "That's thus sayeth the Lord."
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:07:37] He said, 'If I ever preached anything
[1:07:39] inspired, it was those seven seals.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:07:47] So, see how the See how Jesus Christ is
[1:07:50] connected with brother Brandham? Because
[1:07:52] brother Brandham is restoring the
[1:07:55] covenant, the new covenant.
[1:07:57] What was the new covenant, church? The
[1:07:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[1:08:02] And brother comes back to restore it.
[1:08:04] It's not just speaking in tongues. It's
[1:08:06] not just shouting like I like to do.
[1:08:08] It's not dancing like some of us like to
[1:08:10] do. It's not just that. It's you having
[1:08:14] experience with God. God fills your
[1:08:16] soul. You'll have some of that. But
[1:08:18] you'll live the real Christian life.
[1:08:20] You'll live the same life they lived in
[1:08:22] the book of Acts.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what it is. It's the
[1:08:26] full the full life of Jesus Christ that
[1:08:29] they had the day of Pentecost restored
[1:08:31] back to us. The alpha has become the
[1:08:34] omega. It's God's masterpiece.
[1:08:36] Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I'm running out of
[1:08:40] voice. I gonna have much tomorrow for
[1:08:42] those little ones.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just address this here. I'm
[1:08:47] already at an hour and seven.
[1:08:54] I don't know how much you know, church,
[1:08:55] about other churches, but there's a lot
[1:08:56] of message churches that are way off the
[1:08:58] word of God. Some of them say that
[1:09:00] Revelation 10 is Jesus coming down and
[1:09:03] now the rapture's already started. Uh,
[1:09:06] and now God's not in heaven because
[1:09:09] Christ is on earth. That's wrong. Jesus
[1:09:12] came down to brother church. Jesus went
[1:09:14] back up.
[1:09:16] Does everybody catch that what I'm
[1:09:17] saying? Revelation 10, the mighty angel
[1:09:19] comes down, but the mighty angel went
[1:09:21] back up.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; But I'll say like this, the mighty
[1:09:24] angel's here in the form of the Holy
[1:09:25] Ghost
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; because he's always been here.
[1:09:28] Hallelujah.
[1:09:30] But you'd be surprised how many message
[1:09:32] people and even message preachers will
[1:09:34] say they'll say deity is not in heaven.
[1:09:37] Deity is on earth because of this
[1:09:39] scripture. Revelation 10. The church
[1:09:42] realize what they're saying. Can you
[1:09:43] picture? I think I mentioned this a few
[1:09:44] weeks ago. Can you imagine? They're
[1:09:46] saying when they pray, God's not even in
[1:09:48] heaven to hear it. God hears it down
[1:09:50] here on earth.
[1:09:52] That's what they're saying. God is not
[1:09:54] in heaven. Well, I have a question. If
[1:09:57] God's not in heaven, where is the blood
[1:09:59] of Jesus Christ to to forgive our sins?
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:10:05] now, see, but see how this can be so
[1:10:06] tempting. I imagine uh some of our
[1:10:09] African saints, if they talk to saints,
[1:10:11] they probably talk to people that
[1:10:12] actually believe this. There's probably
[1:10:13] a lot of people in Africa that believe
[1:10:14] this, just like there are in Ohio,
[1:10:18] sadly sad to say. But they see the oh
[1:10:21] this angel of the Lord it's Jesus Christ
[1:10:23] come down to meet brother Ram every day
[1:10:25] for seven days and reveal the seals. He
[1:10:27] did
[1:10:30] but then the Lord Jesus Christ went back
[1:10:32] and but the Holy Ghost who's always been
[1:10:35] here is still here amongst us.
[1:10:36] Hallelujah.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And not only that but the angels of God
[1:10:39] are here as well.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Now just to show you that let me read
[1:10:44] you three quotes in July 64 questions
[1:10:48] and answers. Brother Ram said to make me
[1:10:50] the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:52] would be an antichrist.
[1:10:54] For that person of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:56] Christ, listen, he says, is sitting at
[1:10:59] the right hand on the majesty on high.
[1:11:02] He didn't say he's here.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; He said he's sitting on the right hand
[1:11:06] of the majesty on high and will come
[1:11:08] again in great power and glory.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Yet these message preachers won't look
[1:11:13] at that. They'll say, "Oh, he's here.
[1:11:15] He's here. He's here. He came down in
[1:11:17] Revelation 10. I'm sorry. You've just
[1:11:19] added your own false interpretation of
[1:11:20] the Bible.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, my God came down. Yes, the mighty
[1:11:24] angel came down in 1963. But the mighty
[1:11:27] angel went back up and now the mighty
[1:11:29] Holy Ghost is in the church. Hallelujah.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:36] And then there's people that say the
[1:11:38] spirit of Elijah. Now, we have the
[1:11:40] spirit of Elijah. Now, church, I don't
[1:11:41] believe that either because if we did,
[1:11:43] we'd be prophesying. And I know the
[1:11:45] Bible says prophesy again. But all that
[1:11:47] means is just repeating what's already
[1:11:49] been said. If that's the case, Brother
[1:11:51] Mang, then I I don't know anybody who's
[1:11:52] got the spirit of Elijah that actually
[1:11:54] prophesies on earth right now. That
[1:11:58] means that means nobody's got the Holy
[1:11:59] Ghost. It just struck me right there.
[1:12:00] Nobody's got the Holy Ghost then.
[1:12:02] Because who's saying thus sayith the
[1:12:03] Lord like brother Brandham? Nobody's
[1:12:04] saying it. Very few. Very few. Well,
[1:12:06] maybe there's a few. But that means
[1:12:08] there's only a few people got the Holy
[1:12:10] Ghost. So see that's wrong.
[1:12:13] I said that's wrong.
[1:12:15] They're trying to make themselves like
[1:12:17] Elijah and Elisha. They're taking that
[1:12:18] type way too far
[1:12:21] because if you had the spirit of Elijah,
[1:12:23] you'd be prophesying like brother
[1:12:24] Brandham, right? About California
[1:12:28] or about people uh uh having babies like
[1:12:31] Marilyn Hickey and all these things like
[1:12:32] that. Now, there might be some who have
[1:12:33] the prophetic gift, but but those
[1:12:36] preachers preach like everybody has the
[1:12:38] spirit of Elijah. I'm sorry, they don't.
[1:12:43] Hallelujah.
[1:12:46] So what they do is they misunderstand
[1:12:47] types. Yes, I know Elisha got the spirit
[1:12:50] of Elijah. I know that types Christ in
[1:12:51] the church. How many know that
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; it types Christ in the church, but that
[1:12:55] doesn't mean every one of you are going
[1:12:56] to prophesy with thus sayith the Lord.
[1:12:57] It doesn't mean that brother Bang and I
[1:12:59] and the Sarongs and Canad we've been
[1:13:02] around long enough to know not everybody
[1:13:04] does that. Hallelujah.
[1:13:07] Amen. Just let me lay that in course in
[1:13:09] case you hear something crazy like that.
[1:13:11] Here's the next one. Uh
[1:13:14] four for five months before he died,
[1:13:15] brother Ram's having a a service
[1:13:17] preaching what is the attraction on the
[1:13:18] mountain. And that's where brother Ram
[1:13:20] said Revelation 10 1-7 is history. Let's
[1:13:22] say history. Ready? History. History.
[1:13:24] That means Revelation 10:1-7 has already
[1:13:27] been fulfilled. It was fulfilled in
[1:13:28] March of 63 when the Holy Ghost came
[1:13:31] down. Jesus came down to meet with
[1:13:32] brother Brandham and reveal the seven
[1:13:34] seals. Hallelujah.
[1:13:36] Brother Ram says it's history. This is
[1:13:38] the same sermon.
[1:13:40] Brother Ram is greeting all the people
[1:13:42] on tape that are listening to this
[1:13:44] sermon. He says, "Greetings to the West,
[1:13:47] San Jose, brother Borders. We send
[1:13:50] greetings to the mountains of a
[1:13:51] Prescott, Arizona,
[1:13:54] that's waiting for the coming of the
[1:13:55] Lord. We send greetings to Tucson
[1:13:57] waiting for the coming of the Lord. We
[1:13:59] send greetings to Houston, Texas, those
[1:14:02] waiting for the Are you getting it? Are
[1:14:04] you getting the the pattern here?
[1:14:07] Every city is waiting for what? Well, I
[1:14:10] thought he's here. They say he's here,
[1:14:11] Sister Naomi. They say he's already here
[1:14:13] and he's not coming. He's here.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, deceived friends. You haven't
[1:14:18] listened to enough tapes. Or if you did,
[1:14:20] you're listening, but you're not hearing
[1:14:21] what the spirit says to the church.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Everybody see that? I'll keep going to a
[1:14:26] few more. He says, uh, now up in
[1:14:29] Chicago, those who are waiting for the
[1:14:32] up on the east coast, New York and
[1:14:33] Connecticut, the great groups up there
[1:14:34] waiting for the And then he says, here
[1:14:37] down in Clarksville, waiting for the And
[1:14:40] it says here at the Brandon Tabernacle,
[1:14:42] waiting for the
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; You got that quote memorized. You didn't
[1:14:45] even know, did you?
[1:14:48] Five months before he died, he said,
[1:14:50] "Everybody is still waiting for the
[1:14:51] coming of the Lord." Why did Abraham
[1:14:53] say, "We're not waiting. He's already
[1:14:54] here." Because we got people that have
[1:14:57] evil spirits and preaching false
[1:14:58] doctrine, right? They can't rightly
[1:15:01] divide the word of truth, church. That
[1:15:03] means they shouldn't be teaching. Now,
[1:15:05] they can preach about raising people's
[1:15:06] faith. I've seen that some brothers can
[1:15:08] preach and raise the faith off the roof,
[1:15:10] but as soon as they start teaching, they
[1:15:12] break the word of God many times.
[1:15:15] Like that brother I told you, he can
[1:15:16] preach the house off and people get
[1:15:18] healed, miracles, all these things. They
[1:15:20] get the Holy Ghost, but he'll say things
[1:15:22] like deity. He said deity is not in
[1:15:24] heaven, deities on earth. That shows
[1:15:25] he's not much of a teacher. He doesn't
[1:15:27] have the gift to teach. That's right.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he also said this,
[1:15:33] brother B. He said, "We ought to believe
[1:15:35] uh every word from 47 to 65 just like we
[1:15:38] believe every word from Genesis to
[1:15:40] Revelation." That's complete heresy.
[1:15:42] That's complete idolatry. That man
[1:15:44] should not be trying to teach, but he's
[1:15:46] trying to. Shame on that man. He just
[1:15:49] lifted the tapes equal to the Bible.
[1:15:51] That's wickedness.
[1:15:53] Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Any man that's honest knows
[1:15:56] that.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Now, that's my little uh injection there
[1:16:02] for people that listen that need that.
[1:16:03] By God's grace, our church probably got
[1:16:05] it pretty good by God's grace. Now, uh
[1:16:08] three weeks before he died, Brother Ram
[1:16:10] said this in modern events made clear by
[1:16:12] prophecy. We preach the coming of the
[1:16:14] Lord is at hand. Let's get to the fields
[1:16:16] down there and notify the heathen. See,
[1:16:18] do something about it. So three weeks
[1:16:20] before he's still waiting for the coming
[1:16:22] of the Lord. The coming of the Lord is
[1:16:24] not here. He says the coming of the Lord
[1:16:26] is at hand.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; So brother Chris, just so you know, some
[1:16:30] people take Revelation 10. They say,
[1:16:31] "Oh, the mighty angel's here. The angel
[1:16:33] Lord is here. So he's not in heaven."
[1:16:37] That that's a lie. The mighty angel came
[1:16:39] down just like Amen. just like all the
[1:16:41] other prophets. Amen. Moses and all
[1:16:43] them. And the then the mighty angel went
[1:16:45] back up to heaven. Now say like this.
[1:16:48] This is just a thought coming to me
[1:16:49] right now. Perhaps the mighty angel uh
[1:16:51] stayed with Moses his whole life just
[1:16:53] like Abraham. Maybe the mighty angel
[1:16:55] stayed with brother Brandham until you
[1:16:57] know brother passed away in 65. That's
[1:16:59] just coming to me now. All right. But
[1:17:01] let me find a place to close. I'm at an
[1:17:03] hour and 15. That's about perfect here.
[1:17:05] Uh by God's grace. Okay. Let's close
[1:17:07] with this. Now I want to bring it down
[1:17:08] to you a little more here. Let's take
[1:17:10] let's take take some encouraging
[1:17:11] scriptures here. I think this will
[1:17:14] encourage you by God's grace.
[1:17:17] Okay. Psalm 34:7. The angel Lord
[1:17:20] encampeth round about them that fear him
[1:17:22] and deliverth them.
[1:17:25] So the angels will camp near you. I
[1:17:29] heard a preacher say one time he he he
[1:17:31] saw a vision. I heard him say on a on a
[1:17:33] video he was watching and he saw the
[1:17:36] angel Lord come into the church and he
[1:17:37] was watching a brother just preach like
[1:17:39] this. He was just watching him real
[1:17:40] serious. And this was only a few years
[1:17:43] ago. And I believe the brother because I
[1:17:45] believe he's got the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:48] And so that gives us that gives a
[1:17:50] picture if the angels now think about
[1:17:52] that church. If that's true, then the
[1:17:53] angel's watching me like that too to
[1:17:54] make sure I say the right things. If I
[1:17:57] make a mistake, God will forgive me,
[1:17:58] right? But in other words, we're
[1:18:01] supposed to feel the presence of God
[1:18:02] that the angels are here. It's a holy
[1:18:05] atmosphere. God wants to bless his
[1:18:07] people.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; God wants to deliver his people. That's
[1:18:10] why the angel Lord is here. Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] I'm talking about your angel, your
[1:18:14] guardian angel. Now, church, let this
[1:18:16] encourage you. Psalm 91:11.
[1:18:18] Let this encourage you.
[1:18:25] For he shall give his angels charge over
[1:18:27] thee to keep thee in what? All, let's
[1:18:30] say all thy ways. Ready? All th. The
[1:18:33] angel is going to keep you whether you
[1:18:35] drive out to Oregon or not, brother
[1:18:36] Vang. The angel Lord's going to keep
[1:18:38] you.
[1:18:40] Whether we drive up to Sandusky or not,
[1:18:42] the angel Lord is going to keep you all
[1:18:45] your ways. Right? So, this lets us know
[1:18:49] if anything happens to us that doesn't
[1:18:50] seem right, then God had to allow it.
[1:18:53] He's testing our faith just like he
[1:18:55] tested Job's.
[1:18:58] He's going to keep you in all your ways,
[1:18:59] brother Mercy. All your ways.
[1:19:04] Verse uh 12. Now, what are they gonna do
[1:19:06] if you fall? The Bible said, "They shall
[1:19:08] bear thee up in their hands, lest thou
[1:19:10] dash thy foot against a stone." So they
[1:19:13] kept uh brother Chris from breaking his
[1:19:15] ankle the other day. Right. Hallelujah.
[1:19:18] He got some ligament sprained, but the
[1:19:20] angel Lord was keep there to keep him
[1:19:22] from falling and breaking his bones.
[1:19:30] Now, here's the verse that Brother Am
[1:19:31] uses for the guardian angel. Matthew
[1:19:34] 18:10.
[1:19:37] Matthew 18:10,
[1:19:39] "Take heed that thy that ye despise not
[1:19:41] one of these little ones. For I say unto
[1:19:43] you that in heaven their angels do
[1:19:45] always behold the face of my father
[1:19:47] which is in heaven." Remember when m
[1:19:50] when Micaiah saw the vision of heaven,
[1:19:52] the Bible said he was surrounded by a
[1:19:54] host of angels on the right hand and on
[1:19:57] the left. And church, even these
[1:19:59] children got little an I'm sorry, even
[1:20:02] these little children got angels that
[1:20:03] are going to become down to them.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah. So the Bible says don't
[1:20:08] forget that you make sure you treat
[1:20:09] these little ones right because they've
[1:20:11] got a guarded angel.
[1:20:14] Hallelujah.
[1:20:17] And you don't want to get in trouble
[1:20:18] with God because God will rebuke you and
[1:20:21] God will correct you. He'll spank you
[1:20:22] harshly. Right? Whatever you need to
[1:20:25] bring you back to repentance.
[1:20:27] So this proves everybody here has got a
[1:20:29] guardian angel. Zion, you got a guardian
[1:20:31] angel. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:20:33] Amen.
[1:20:35] Each one of us all the way to the
[1:20:36] youngest, the Genevieve and Zion. And
[1:20:39] I'm not sure if Andy's here or not, but
[1:20:42] they got from the oldest to the
[1:20:43] youngest, each one has an angel to keep
[1:20:46] you in all your ways.
[1:20:48] So that gives us also, church, an
[1:20:51] understanding. Don't fear about your
[1:20:52] life and your future because God's
[1:20:54] already got it planned out.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; He's already got an angel for all your
[1:20:58] steps
[1:21:00] to keep you in all your ways. And not
[1:21:01] only that, but he sent his angel before
[1:21:04] you to keep you.
[1:21:07] Hallelujah.
[1:21:11] Now, let me read these quotes from
[1:21:12] brother Brandham here. Uh, brother
[1:21:14] Brandham talks about the angel. He's
[1:21:16] talking. He says, "I pray you'll send
[1:21:17] the great angel of God who's fed me all
[1:21:20] the days of my life." Now, Malachi might
[1:21:22] think, "Well, my mom fed me all the days
[1:21:23] of my life." Brother Ram says, "The
[1:21:25] angels fed me all the days of my life
[1:21:29] and brought me through many dangerous
[1:21:31] toils and snares
[1:21:34] around the world." Now look, not only
[1:21:36] that, church. Now listen, and has bound
[1:21:38] Satan. Hallelujah. Praise God. So the
[1:21:41] angel made sure you were fed. It
[1:21:44] delivered you from toils and snares. And
[1:21:47] then it also kept Satan at bay.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; My what more could we ask for?
[1:21:52] Hallelujah. Then God sending his angel
[1:21:55] to keep Satan away and to provide all
[1:21:57] that you have need of, help you through
[1:21:59] every trial, every difficult situation.
[1:22:02] God's angel was there to keep you in
[1:22:04] everyone. Praise God for his angels.
[1:22:06] Hallelujah.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brandon prays.
[1:22:13] I pray you'll send him tonight and let
[1:22:14] him be made manifest here on the
[1:22:16] platform as this little audience down
[1:22:19] here in this lovely place will believe
[1:22:20] on him with all their hearts.
[1:22:23] He says it again. I pray that you'll
[1:22:25] send your angel, the one who separated
[1:22:27] me from my mother's womb. Church, who
[1:22:29] brought you out of your mother's womb?
[1:22:31] The angel of the Lord.
[1:22:34] The angel made sure you came out.
[1:22:36] Hallelujah.
[1:22:39] Bringing me into this life and has
[1:22:41] ordained for this purpose will stand
[1:22:43] with me here tonight.
[1:22:46] So that tells me, brother Mercy, I'm
[1:22:48] standing here because the angel Lord
[1:22:50] separated me from my mother's womb and
[1:22:52] is standing by here making sure I'm
[1:22:54] preaching God's word to God's people.
[1:22:57] Hallelujah. And that's why I can do it
[1:22:59] night after night, year after year,
[1:23:00] right? Hallelujah. I'm coming into my
[1:23:02] second decade here. This June will be 20
[1:23:05] years pastoring in Akran. Who made it
[1:23:07] possible? The angel of the Lord made it
[1:23:09] possible. He made it possible in your
[1:23:11] life as well. Abraham says for a third
[1:23:15] time, "And may the angel of God who's
[1:23:17] guided me through my life, not only
[1:23:19] protected you, but guided you as well."
[1:23:21] He guides you to the right job.
[1:23:24] He'll guide you to the right next job,
[1:23:26] too. How many believe that?
[1:23:29] And fed me since I was born. May he be
[1:23:31] here tonight to heal the sick and the
[1:23:33] afflicted. We ask in the name of Jesus
[1:23:35] Christ. Last one.
[1:23:39] The angel of God that you sent to me at
[1:23:41] my birth, guiding me down through life
[1:23:44] by your hand, who meets and talks and
[1:23:46] shows the visions that I speak of,
[1:23:48] Jesus, send him now in thy name, that he
[1:23:51] might be able to discern and know the
[1:23:54] gift, I'm sorry, and the gift of
[1:23:55] discernment to know the thoughts and
[1:23:57] intents of the heart. Let's stand to our
[1:24:00] feet. Musicians can come here,
[1:24:06] church, as we begin to pray. Does anyone
[1:24:09] here need deliverance? If you do,
[1:24:13] you should repent of your sins. The
[1:24:14] Bible says,
[1:24:17] so that way the angel Lord can bring
[1:24:19] deliverance to you. If you don't confess
[1:24:21] your sins, that devil has a legal right
[1:24:23] to stay in your life, your mind, your
[1:24:25] heart, whatever may, whatever you want
[1:24:27] to call it, your spirit. He's not in
[1:24:29] your soul. That's for sure. You're
[1:24:30] saved. He can't get into that soul.
[1:24:34] But that's what the Bible says. The
[1:24:36] angel Lord encamps about them that fear
[1:24:38] the Lord to deliver them.
[1:24:42] And church, if nobody here needs
[1:24:43] deliverance, well then he's here to give
[1:24:45] you a little victory
[1:24:48] because he's going to give you a little
[1:24:49] today. And church, if you listen on
[1:24:50] Wednesday, he'll give you a little
[1:24:52] victory on Wednesday. But don't forget
[1:24:54] Tuesday and Monday.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Get some victory on Monday and Tuesday.
[1:25:03] The angel of the Lord.
[1:25:05] Let's put that verse on my mind here as
[1:25:07] we get ready to pray. He shall keep you
[1:25:10] in all your ways. Sister Beatatric, has
[1:25:13] he kept you in all your ways? Amen. Look
[1:25:16] at her. Raise your hand. How many
[1:25:17] believe he's kept you in all your ways?
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; All your years. Some of you younger than
[1:25:21] others. Some of us older than others.
[1:25:23] He's kept me in all my ways. He's gone
[1:25:24] before me. He's prepared a place for me.
[1:25:27] Praise God. in this life. Let's bow our
[1:25:30] heads.
[1:25:32] Heavenly Father, we're thankful for
[1:25:33] today. Lord, bless your people, Lord. I
[1:25:35] hope this was an encouragement to them,
[1:25:36] Lord God.
[1:25:38] Lord, you separated us from our mother's
[1:25:40] womb. You've fed us all the days of our
[1:25:43] lives. Dear God, you set your angel to
[1:25:46] provide our mothers, our fathers these
[1:25:48] jobs,
[1:25:50] allowed us to have money and get food.
[1:25:52] You fed us all the days of our life.
[1:25:55] Hallelujah.
[1:25:56] Not only that, Lord, you've led us.
[1:25:59] You've guided us in every decision. I
[1:26:03] didn't know anything about Akran. You
[1:26:04] guided me here, Lord God. You prepared a
[1:26:07] place for me.
[1:26:12] Lord, each one of us, I want, Lord, each
[1:26:14] one of us, God, now I pray that we'd
[1:26:15] look at our lives, look at the times you
[1:26:17] delivered us to remind us that you're
[1:26:20] always there.
[1:26:22] We have supernatural help available.
[1:26:28] You have bore us up that we don't dash
[1:26:31] our foot against the stone.
[1:26:34] Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] You've guided us in all of our ways,
[1:26:38] Lord God. We want to thank you for
[1:26:39] today, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:43] Lord, I just want to take a moment,
[1:26:44] Lord, and with the church. And Lord, we
[1:26:46] just want to thank you for your angels.
[1:26:48] So, church, would you do that? Would you
[1:26:50] raise your hands or would you just bow
[1:26:51] your head and just thank the Lord that
[1:26:52] you have an angel there that's guided
[1:26:54] you and protected you? Just take that
[1:26:56] for a few moments. Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:26:58] you Lord. Thank you that an angel
[1:27:00] separated me from my mother's womb.
[1:27:01] Lord, sent me to Akran, Lord God, has
[1:27:04] provided me this place, Lord, for a
[1:27:06] home, not only that, but a spiritual
[1:27:08] home. Thank you, Lord God. You protected
[1:27:10] me on all my ways and all my car
[1:27:12] driving. Lord God, you protected me on
[1:27:14] Wednesday, a couple Wednesdays ago, when
[1:27:15] the car was swerving right at me. Lord
[1:27:17] God, you spared my life. God, thank you.
[1:27:20] You're kind. You're gracious and
[1:27:23] merciful. Lord God, thank you. The
[1:27:24] angels of God are here. Lord God,
[1:27:29] the ministering spirits are here, Lord
[1:27:31] God. I could say in the last two weeks,
[1:27:34] I've been delivered by the angel of the
[1:27:36] Lord. I should have got hit,
[1:27:39] but you gave me the alertness to honk on
[1:27:41] my my horn, and you give alertness to
[1:27:44] that individual to swerve his car right
[1:27:46] at the last moment.
[1:27:49] Thank you God for your angels.
[1:27:52] Hallelujah Lord God. Oh glory to God.
[1:27:55] Lord may this teach us to fear you more
[1:27:57] Lord as we look at the angel of the
[1:27:59] Lord. Lord you sent yourself Lord down
[1:28:02] in the angelic body with these
[1:28:03] covenants,
[1:28:05] these promises to your people. Lord,
[1:28:08] thank you for meeting with Abraham,
[1:28:11] Jacob, Moses,
[1:28:14] Joshua.
[1:28:16] Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] David, Lord, you gave him a covenant,
[1:28:19] Lord God.
[1:28:21] Thank you, Lord, for meeting with John
[1:28:23] the Baptist, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[1:28:26] And thank you, Lord God, for meeting
[1:28:28] with your prophet, Brother Brandham,
[1:28:29] Lord God. Thank you for meeting with St.
[1:28:31] Paul to give us this New Testament,
[1:28:32] Lord, which we will be judged by
[1:28:35] the angels here to make sure we obey
[1:28:37] this word, oh God. May we obey your
[1:28:40] voice, hearken under your voice, Lord
[1:28:42] God, do that which is pleasing in thy
[1:28:44] sight, Lord God.
[1:28:47] Lord, as we
[1:28:49] pray here, Lord, again,
[1:28:52] we thank you, Lord God, for the angels
[1:28:54] of God.
[1:28:56] Thank you for your protection, Lord. If
[1:28:58] anyone needs deliverance, I pray they'd
[1:28:59] seek it, Lord, with all their hearts
[1:29:01] today, Lord God.
[1:29:04] I pray, God, you'd forgive every sin,
[1:29:06] Lord. Look past our faults and see our
[1:29:07] needs today, Lord, by the blood of Jesus
[1:29:10] Christ, Lord. May each person feel
[1:29:11] delivered and feel that they've gone a
[1:29:14] little further,
[1:29:18] Lord, in their journey, Lord, in the
[1:29:20] promised land. We ask it. We give you
[1:29:22] thanks and praise in Jesus Christ's
[1:29:24] name. And the church said,
