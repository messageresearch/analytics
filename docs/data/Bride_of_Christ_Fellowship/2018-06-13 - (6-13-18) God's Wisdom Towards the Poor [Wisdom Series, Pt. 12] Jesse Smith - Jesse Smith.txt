for your amazing grace give you all the glory Lord anoint us now in Jesus Christ everybody said amen let's take our Bibles here tonight by the grace of the Lord like to continue on this wisdom series here but I think I'll just start some well let's just start in Proverbs 22 verse 1 proverbs 22 verse 1 and you can switch over whenever you're ready Thank You Lydia Malachi Roberts 22 I just had like a few topics on my heart as I've I'm reading now through Proverbs the second time straight and just kind of what with the Holy Spirit puts on my heart I'm just trying to preach that by the grace of the Lord so I like to look at tonight this is part 12 I like to look at God's attitude toward the poor I like to look at that tonight by God's grace proverbs 22 verse 1 if you're there say Amen let's read I'll read verse 1 and then we'll all read verse two robbers 22 verse 1 a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor rather than silver and gold let's all read verse 2 one two three the rich and poor meet together the Lord is the maker of them all let's just bow our heads in word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God here tonight father in heaven again we just give you glory thank you for your amazing love thank you for amazing grace speak to us through thy word Lord as I prepared this morning I thought I was going to go to Revelation for the Lord I just felt your presence and your unction Lord God and your inspiration to go this way so father guide me Lord God I'm just your vessel and or let these words be words of life to your people father granite Lord feed these hungry souls tonight in Jesus Christ name and the church said Amen god bless should be in seated to praise the Lord like to look at our wisdom series again tonight by the grace of the Lord I just want to thank again everybody who's been so kind you know to give us little gifts and help us out with now that the baby's here we appreciate that and thanks for everything thank you for everything we you know you've done we really appreciate that that Ghana food was tremendous so thank you sister that's really good but I you you brothers to eat real good over there brother William you eat real good but they just loved it and since release so that was great meal thank you sister just everybody rejoiced in that delicious everybody tried to have the most brownies but I think I had the most brownies so I think I had like three or four each night but thank you you know my wife can hardly you know she's just tired she getting strong you know but you know she can't really cook at this time so all the help you know we really appreciate that by God's grace yesterday some woman and I say that nice that it's more friend of my wife she went to Costco and bought 300 to 400 or $500 of organic meats and food and just dropped him on our our kitchen and my wife just started crying you know I just it's just God's amazing grace church you know God is so merciful and I just you know just tell you got to encourage you thank you for your kindness and anything we do for the Lord he's watching and you know he'll he'll pay us back you know and we thought that that's not why we do it we do it you know we give to others to be like Christ because we care about others we love others but then God rewards us you know so it's just God's mercy and love so you know our hearts are really full really blessed right now and we're just thankful for all that God has done and thank you for all your love to us amen we certainly love everybody by the grace of Lord let's look at this wisdom towards the poor I like to look at that thought dear tonight you know as I said I was I'm reading now this is my second time in a row through Proverbs I just keep seeing these thoughts about poor and rich and revenue and and so I like to just preach on that tonight I got about 70 slides so there's I'll have a lot of scripture up here so we don't have to do much turn and I think maybe a couple times we'll turn in your Bible but I got a lot of scripture just I had plenty of time I'm on summer vacation I love it I'm having a great time and just enjoying the family and enjoying studying and praying more and and playing time to study so I'm thankful for that so I want to start with this thought as we got our text the Lord makes rich and poor I was kind of dealing with this a few weeks ago you know just saying how it's God determines many times God determines our position in life you know saying you know you know you know even about our church you know God made want us to be a small church forever you know or at least for on our lifetime if God wants us to be a big church but he'll take care of it and you know same thing now applies here to our own finances you know the Bible says that it's God who makes us rich or poor now this actually the first time it's mentioned is Hannah's prayer in First Samuel Chapter two she's praying and thanking the Lord for giving her a Samuel the Prophet and she's just praying and saying the Lord makes poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and he lifts it up so Hanna had been lifted up by God amen God it allowed her to be down for a while and to feel we'd say poor in spirit you know not really financially remember she was the best treated of of her of her of her husband's wives and concubines she was the best treated but she in her Thanksgiving prayer she was just saying how Lord you make all these things you're the one who determines my position in life and you make poor you make rich you make you bring low and you lift up so God is ordering all of our footsteps amen as we walk in obedience praise the Lord now we know there's of course you can we can always choose the perfect will of God or the permissive will of God but we know even brother Branham said God will use the permissive will and he'll bring it back to the perfect will as with Jonah amen he may have stepped out he left the presence of the Lord and mother and said you know many everybody gets down on him but but what happened it had to be that way God knew he would choose that path because he had to come through the whale and the heathens the Ninevites had to see him come out of a whale of their own fish God you know so God it makes everything work out all right but we should strive to never step out of the presence of God amen we should strive to live in His divine presence amen now we repeated this this was our text here again a good name is better than riches loving favor than silver gold and the rich and poor meet together the Lord is the maker of them both you know God does that will look at some scriptures later on you know God in the church God will have rich people and poor people in the same church and we must the Bible said we must treat each other all the same by God's grace and so we'll look at that in the book of James it speaks of that but it's God who is directing these things and of course there's consequences we'll get to that as well what I did is I went through every scripture I could find on the poor and the rich and the wealthy and revenue and money anything I could find in Proverbs about topic I wouldn't look at the poor and how God has a hata to toward the poor now I want to just jump ahead though to Cleese yesyes five verse 18 it says behold that which I have seen it is good and calmly for one to eat and drink and enjoy the good of Oz labor then he taketh Under the Sun all the days of his life which God giveth him for it is his portion amen every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth and given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour this is the gift of God amen for he shall not much remember the days of his life because God answered him in the joy of his heart amen so the the Solomon the rider is telling us that we should enjoy just the daily blessings of life it's kind of hot in here maokai can you turn on the air and set it to 60 64 okay 64 not too low cuz it it's really hard on the through the heart on the furnace and the air cooling when when did we do that so just set it on 64 buddy but Solomon is saying you know he watched Solomon observed all these men and all of his kingdom for all these years and and he observed its best when we when we enjoy everything about our lives we shouldn't feel bad you know if God's giving us food or money or what God's given us we shouldn't feel bad about that we should enjoy it we should thank God for it amen because it's not it's God that gave it unto us the Bible says and God has done this not just to some men but to every man everyone that God has given this ability to should enjoy it amen because God answers him in the joy of his heart so God wants us to feel joy in every life situation praise the Lord you should enjoy coming to church on Wednesday night we should enjoy coming to church on Sunday morning Sunday night or a prayer meeting or whatever we're wherever we're at we should have joined her heart God wants us to enjoy the moment praise God now I want to look at this thought as we saw earlier it's always better to live godly than to have more money better is the little with the righteous then great revenues without right god says we're better off it's better off to have just a little and just barely getting by it's better to have that then not have righteousness better is the poor that walketh in his integrity then he that is perverse and his lips and as a fool so it's better we've got to honey trust God tonight it's better to have a little and have righteousness than to have so much and not have righteousness it's better to be poor and walk in integrity than to have perverse lips and be a fool see the Bible the book of Proverbs keeps echoing these same thoughts and adding a little more each time better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness then he that is perverse in his ways though he be rich amen God said we're better off to be poor and walking uprightness than to be a rich wealthy man or woman again it keeps saying this the desire of a man is is kindness and a poor man is better than a liar glory amen it'd be better to have a poor friend than a rich liar a good name is rather to be chosen us as our text than great riches and loving favor rather than silver goal to be better to be known for my that person's really honest than to be that person's really rich it's better to have a good name all the Smith name is a good name or or you put your last name in there that's a good name those are good people it's a good thing to do that have this good name Ecclesiastes says it again better is a poor and a wise child then an old and foolish King now who's the old and foolish King Solomon is right because he's writing this he's writing this at the end of his life he remember he tried all these things he tried women he tried wine he tried all he tried building he's tried wealth he said all these things are vanity right so he's saying it's better to be a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be in my four out of prison he cometh the rain so at least this poor child who's wise will come to rain at least he has a future because he's wise whereas also he that is born in his kingdom B cometh poor Amen so a foolish King will produce poverty eventually because he's not wise with the resources God has given him look at proverbs 19 14 houses of riches are the inheritance of father's and a prudent wife is from the Lord so again remember God makes poor God makes rich so some people are just born into wealth right some people just had rich parents and so that's the way God allows them to be raised that's the experience God gives them they just always had lots of money I'm not in that boat I don't know if you are not but some people haven't by inheritance their parents just have all kinds of money and they can just help them out through life but either way we have a great Heavenly Father will take care of all of his children praise God I do have a rich inheritance amen it might not be money but it's God's grace amen it's God's love hallelujah Solomon says it again there's one alone and there is not a second so let's look at a man who's all by himself but he's rich yeah he hath neither a child nor brother so a man who's never had a child and he has no brothers he's an only child yet is there no end of all his labor yet he's still working so see we think we're so busy right oh I'm so I got seven kids I'm so busy well I've got this and that I'm so busy but look the Bible says even a man without kids without any family he's still busy all the time he's still working all the time we're all going to work all the time that's the command of God God gave that to Adam in the beginning before there was even Sid our lives are gonna be filled with labor it depends on the attitude that we put forth throughout our day now look what it says he has no end easy don't have any children you don't have any siblings or any family and yet there's no end of his work neither is his I satisfy with riches all he has to do is take care of himself you don't have to put any food on the table to provide for the children you have to pay insurance for the or do anything like that he has nothing to do with that but yet he's still not satisfied with riches neither saith he for whom do I labor and bereaved my soul for good this is also vanity a the source or travail so Solomon saw that the man who has to take care of no one he's still not happy with all the wealth because wealth won't make you happy Amen how many celebrities have committed suicide in the last year I think we had like three in the last week or something like that have all the money all the riches all the big Instagram accounts you know all the likes on Facebook they have as much as you want but it proves that money does not bring happiness the Bible actually says giving to the poor will make you happy so one of these people ever gave to the poor I wonder how much they gave to the poor because the Bible said it will make you happy how many know God's Word never fails so see you Solomon observe this you know you can have lots of children and you can just work all the time or you can have no children you're still work all the time and you're still not satisfied with money because money does not satisfy please ask these 911 I returned and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong nor yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding so men that are smart don't always get rich nor yet favor to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all now we know God's not rolling a dice up there like wow I'll see how Jesse's life turns out you know well he will he pass go like he's not like a doing a Monopoly board I wonder how he he's not doing that God is purposing everything that I might be conformed to the image of Christ God is purposing everything in your life that you might be conformed to the image of his son amen that's in Romans chapter 8 so we must recognize and submit to God's will and not seek our own will because the smartest we may be with money or as smart as we may be or is it with as much wisdom a gift of wisdom as we may have in the Holy Spirit that doesn't guarantee certain things in life it's about the plan of God for our lives please nasty 1020 curse not the King no no not in thy thoughts and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber some people are so jealous of rich people that they speak evil of just because they're rich the Bible says not to do that for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter I don't know if you saw this but I think Twitter's in this verse I saw that years ago when I first read this in Twitter Twitter's in this verse right because people have all these curses and they tweet them out like that like our president sometimes it's good sometimes as bad but they tweet out the evil things in their heart right and a little bird carries it over all over the internet so everybody sees what they're thinking in their bedchamber oh my so see we're not the curse anybody we're to bless and not curse amen that's right now a member church God made Solomon rich remember God makes poor God makes rich but we know you some of his riches to build idolatrous temples see God was pleased he did not ask for riches he did not ask for a long life he did not ask for a life over his enemies or he didn't ask for the life as enemies he asked for discernment and God said because you asked that I'll give you everything you didn't ask for but remember his wives turned his heart away and he built high places for Chima and Moab and likewise he did for every I'm sure likewise did he for all the strange wives was birch incense and sacrifice unto their gods so just because God makes us rich doesn't mean everything's going to turn out good we need a continual living sacrifice of our hearts and minds unto God we need to die daily how we need to die today to yourself die to your own feelings died your own emotions died to your own leadings and wisdom die to your own self and live for Christ now remember this what I love about God although God makes some rich in some poor God ensures there's plenty for the poor and the Church said God you say well God made me I hardly have enough well that's not what the Bible says so I have to ask are using your resources the right way are you looking for resources because there's resources out there now of course we know maybe a time of trial time of tests as well but let's look at this the Bible says this look at proverbs 13 23 March food is in the tillage of the poor not a little bit of food much food but there's that that destroy for want of judgment see those people that don't judge this this promise that God gave about leftover food in their fields if they didn't judge it then they'd be destroyed if they didn't believe God's Word that God was going to leave or have his people leave all these crops and everything in the seventh year then they'd be judged because that's what Exodus 23 says and six years shalt thou show that land and shall gather in the fruits thereof but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still can you imagine on the seventh can you imagine every seven years you wouldn't have to go to work brother William can you imagine that thank goodness Oh glory I get you know I get two and half months off every summer can you imagine a whole year off this is what God promises people work hard for six years take a year off yeah he said I'll give you so much in the six years you'll have plenty to last that seventh year not that the poor of thy people may eat so God said don't even plan so just take that seventh year off just distressed and whatever grows up it'll be for the poor people and the beasts of the field and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat in like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard and with thigh olive guard amen how many believe God is all-powerful God God told him if you just wait on the seventh year God was gonna do the farming God was gonna do the planting and that's and if you know if God's a farmer he's going to get great yields amen if you place it in God's hands and if you let God provide for you God is going to make sure there's plenty of food in the tillage of the pouring ahead God we're going to bless that seventh year if you just trusted the Lord and how we should trust him today amen that's beautiful now we don't have time but well we do have time let's go there let's go to the biggest 25 let's make time here I got time let me set the timer though because I don't want to lose track of time keep saying the word time Leviticus 25 one two seven this is a little more information about what we just read God gives a little more detail 1 this 7 a little spake unto Moses at Mount Sinai saying speaking of the children of Israel and saying to them when you come into land which I give you then then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord thou shalt neither so that I feel no pruned I've been iord that which growth of its own accord of the harvest thou shalt not reap neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a year of rest under the land and the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for the hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase there of be meat so see God was promising them work hard six years and I promise I'll take care of you I'll bless those years and you take that seventh year off and I'll provide food for the poor and I'll provide food for the beasts because it's a Sabbath unto me it's a rest unto God it's a time to rest and learn to trust God amen is that how we do it you know people get so upset well I got to work more days I go to six days and then pretty soon they got to go to seven and stop coming to church and all these things like that and see we get the same test today we've got to have the same a confidence that if I work if I do as much as I can and I give God his a birthday brother branham called Sunday his Sabbath day how do we know that I just heard it today or I'm sorry heard this week my dad said our Sabbath day today our Sabbath day of worship is Sunday that's our day we take off it's the day we give the whole day to the Lord amen so see we're promises if we are if we're given this if we will put God first and honor God with a Sabbath and God will bless us amen it's the promise of the Lord now here I think you'll like this quote I like this now who can doubt that that's what Paul said that's Paul scripture that's Paul's right that's what he taught his church the church positioning before the foundation of the world when God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do he presented a placed you into his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a preacher to be a prophet to be this or to be that he placed you positionally aren't you glad for the farmers where would you be tonight if you were if we didn't have farmers we'd be probably out working in the fields I'm so thankful that God has positionally place he is he's called men and perhaps women from the womb you're gonna grow up and be a farmer and he's done that he's positionally placed them to serve God as a farmer that they might do a great work and put food on our table to meet the needs of all God's children amen I'm glad God's got doctors at her call of God amen and teachers and nurses and our housewives and husbands and all these things God has positionally placed us and we should be thankful for all of them amen because that's what God has called us to do before the foundation of the world amen look at the Bible says this is speaking when when a rich man and a poor man walking to the church or if they're come unto your assembly a man with the gold ring and goodly apparel and they're coming also a poor man in a vile raiment and you have respect to him that wears the gay clothing and say to him sit thou here in a good place and say the poor stand thou here or sit here under my footstool are ye not then partial in yourselves and our become judges of evil thoughts hearken my beloved brethren now look at this hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him amen who is God choosing many times those who are rich in faith not rich in money but rich in faith amen and many times like brother man tells us the Christians are poor people there on the poor side God chooses them because they need God they need to believe the promises of God amen and so God chooses them and will make them inheritors of God's kingdom amen because he's the great heavenly father oh what a blessing to know that God makes some rich God makes some poor remember jesus said there be very few of rich that enter the kingdom of God very few rich people but God has chosen the poor who have rich faith hallelujah amen now let's look at the treatment of the poor this is what the proverb says about how we treat the poor the poor is hated even of his own neighbor but the rich have many friends now this is a good way to judge whether you're rich or poor to your neighbor's hate you or not I guess you could be a you know Solomon's making a generalized statement here but most of the time you know your neighbors should love you if you're real Christian amen but Solomon notice poor people are hated by their neighbors that's what Solomon noticed all the brethren of the poor do hate him so even the family members of the poor hate when they come around now these must not be saved people how much more do his friends go far from him so poor people tend to not have good family relationships because they don't want to be around them right their friends don't want to be around them their neighbors don't want to rerun them so see many times poor people just have one hope that's God right he pursues them with words yet they are one too to him oh my the rich ruled us over the poor so the poor always feel like they're in kinda like a slave slavery or captivity and the borrower is servant to the lender by like this in the Millennium in the future home the poor will rule over the rich amen just like Lazarus the beggar he was poor and he just begged for the crumbs but then he's there with Abraham and Abraham's bosom and the rich man's asking for one little drop of water right and so God switches it around right he switches their destinies around or I say their conditions based upon their their faith even though he's poor in the world Lazarus was rich in faith amen hallelujah isn't that striking he was rich in faith but yet he never got out of being a beggar see how God makes some rich and some poor and the church said see God makes some poor I wonder how many times he prayed Oh God give me give me more than a few crumbs give me you know give me but maybe God just allowed him to be poor for a purpose for a testimony right that's what God does he raises us for a testimony hallelujah now proverbs 14 31 he that oppresses the poor reproaches his maker so people make it harder on the poor or don't give to the poor they taught blaspheme or defy God because God is the maker of the poor but either on earth him hath mercy on the poor how many knew that how many knew is that serious it's that serious how we treat the poor and I'm gonna try to remember at the end of this service I really like it if you would give me a list on a piece of paper of any poor people you know that we can help them out if you know anybody pray about it you know but if you can remember then this service you have any friends that you know or poor Church we need to help them out and you believe that we need to help out if you can't give them cash let's give them rice or let's give them beans or let's give them something let's help out the poor who so market the poor see we shouldn't mock the poor reproach his maker blasphemes his maker and he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished so see we search and doesn't it break your heart if you're a Christian it should break your heart when there's tsunamis or earthquakes or tornadoes and people die or there's flooding that should break our hearts we shouldn't be glad at calamities we should have pity and pray for them amen we do not mock the poor we don't oppress the poor we don't laugh at people who go through calamities remember like the Bible said in first Corinthians 12 if we're a body when one part hurts all the rest of the body hurts for that part right all of it hurts like Monday I work so hard Monday I moved all of our furniture and I think I did 28 flights of steps on Monday and I will overwork myself so on Monday I woke up and I had a headache all day I'm sorry on Tuesday I had a head like all day yesterday because I was drinking water I was doing everything I got 9 hours of sleep yeah I still had a headache because I overworked my body and you think I could get much work done on Tuesday no because my head was pounding my hands went into work my heart wanted to work my legs want to work but my mind wouldn't let me because I have such a bad headache the rest of the body felt the pain of the headache but I went to bed last night what woke up fine this morning but see everybody every part of the body depends on every other part and church we depend on one another by God's grace amen look the poor uses entreaties but the rich answereth roughly I mean how many aware of that rich people are usually real short may be arrogant and their answers they treat people real roughly but a poor person they're using please can you please they're begging you I'm begging you can you do this you know can you that's one way to know where they stand wealth maketh many friends but the poor is separated from his neighbors so the people that are often poorest are the loneliest people so we have to remember that the poor people are often the most lonely and so we need to go visit them we need to help them now look at this let's listen for the cry the poor as we pray tonight and a little bit here let's listen for the cries of the poor who so stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor he also shall cry himself but shall not be heard think about that all right if we don't if we don't listen to other other people what their needs are and if we don't care what their needs are well then we at when we ask for something God's not gonna answer our need how we treat others is how we treat the Lord right try of the poor and if our ears are open we'll hear it how many be that there is a cry of the poor please ask these five eight now this is this is the confidence we have here again with God how God is going to take care of the poor but look what says if thou see us the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province Marvel not at the matter so if we see the poor being mistreated we're not the Marvel be like surprised like oh this is new for he that is higher than the highest regardeth amen and there be higher than they a men see the poor are not without someone to fight for them God is gonna fight for them amen but many times search God uses us to fight for them hallelujah so we've got to always hear the cry of the poor remember God is in control he fights for the poor look what look at this one proverbs 29 13 the poor and the deceitful man meet together to see the sinner in the poor the Lord lighten both their that means illuminates both their eyes so the poor rich and the rich come together or the poor in the center come together God opens both their eyes to see their conditions and to see the Word of God right the Bible said that God wrote a conscience in every person's heart so at some point they recognized wow there there's got to be a god at some point they have to God lightens both their eyes and God gives every man a chance to do his will amen so God makes some rich God makes some poor God gives everyone a chance to help out the poor that's right amen look at this one proverbs 22 22 rob not the poor because he's poor neither oppress the afflicted in the gate for the Lord will plead their cause I like that one glory amen remember the gate was the courtroom of those days so if a poor person gets treated in the courtroom we don't have to get all discouraged too much because the Lord is going to plead their cause amen and sport look at this spoil the soul of those that spoil them that means like losing your life right losing your salvation or or not being saved or being lost this is such a deep heartfelt matter to God and you know it Matthew 25 Jesus gives eternal life just to those who gave me to someone the least of all the Christians if you just give them a meal Jesus will give you eternal life oh this is such a heart message of God God says help people help the poor do something for them if not I'll spoil their souls we've got to have a burden to help the poor and now I just talked about it to do something about it now I just preach about it but do something about it amen the Lord will plead their cause and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them now again he that presses the poor to increase his riches and he they give it to the rich just surely come to one God will make it where they they're getting more God will make them lose it all well so we'll see that here a little bit in the scripture you liking this so far you like to say Amen I I was well I'm just like well this is flowing this morning I said up this is wonderful it's beautiful here's there's I love it you need we should be happy when we help the poor he that despises his neighbor sitteth but he that hath mercy on the poor happy is he how can people end their lives how can there be no hope in life when the Bible says if you are have mercy on people you will be happy Amen that's in the Old Testament that's not even the Holy Ghost joy this is just common regular happiness human happiness when you care about other people when you have mercy on those who might not deserve it the Bible said God will make you happy hey man I don't want to be happy out there I do I don't want to be sad I won't even scourge I don't want me to press I want to be happy well the Bible tells us one sure way to do it have mercy on someone poor person and the church don't feel bad too if it's the beggar I know I know most of those beggars I've I've seen a beggar get money and I've seen him walk into the gas station where we weren't we rented a u-haul down there on Waterloo Avenue let's see where would it be I'm not sure where I'm at right now it's that way but I watched we went to the John and I rented a u-haul one time to move the church there might have been to this place right here and we saw a man get money from the street he walked over here and bought a beer and just started drinking it now do you think those people really want their money to help a drunk person no but see that the the the point I'm trying to make is that God sends rain on the just and the unjust Amen God sends the Holy Ghost anointing on the unjust just as well as the just right god waters the thorn just like he waters your petunias oh yeah hey or whatever flowers you love tulips whatever you love he what he sends water on both of them and so if you give something and someone misused it you don't feel bad because that's what God does all God does that all the time God does that every day he sends he let the Sun Rise on people who don't deserve it who blaspheme his name who speak evil the Word of God God keeps sending blessing and help after help after help chance after chance after chance that's the love of God and Jesus said if you do that then you'll be the children of my father which is in heaven amen that makes you a real child of God now I'm not saying go give cash to a drunk beggar that's not what I'm saying but I'm saying you can have peace that if you feel letting to give and you give something God will honor that and you'll be happy because of a men like I said in the past you know with with my busy life and you know when I see beggars in the past I've stacked tuna cans and Lydia Prime members this Lydia Malachi I used to stacked tuna cans right in that little space between the two front seats and church age books when I'd see a beggar I just give him both the church a tuna can and I gave my cards I never got one call one time I offered a man food and he said I don't like that food I said you must not be very hungry then sir it was right up by the corner right here right when you got off a 77 south I said well you must not be very hungry I don't like that oh man my you must be livin good out there on those gift I wish I had oh ma but if you're really hungry you'll eat anything the Bible says that - if you're really hungry even the most sour thing is like honey the Bible says that so see we want to be happy and so one way to be happy and the program said it's live eternal life is living for other people this is living for other people look at this he that bite now this is my user his interests so he that my interest in unjust gain increases his substance he should gather it for him that will pity the poor oh my so if a man is using evil ways to get money got the Bible said God will find some way to take his money from him and then somehow give it to the poor that's what the Bible says God reward those who help the poor right pity the poor we have to have pity on the poor the king that faithfully judges the poor I like that you see they got to be judged too like like we said they got to judge them is this a drunk is this a cigarette addict is this a cocaine addict got to be careful what we give them right the king that faithfully judges the poor his throne shall be established forever amen huh me know you're a king and a priest Hey amen you got a faithfully judge the polari men that's right Parvez 31 nine remember this is King Lemuel mother could have been Bathsheba or it could have been another woman open thy mouth and judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor and the needy so if there's any poor friend you have and you see them in a bad situation open your mouth tell me tell somebody and let's try to help out their cause by the grace of Lord never understand Amen we want I want to know because many times hurts just fifty dollars of food or twenty dollars of food or ten dollars of food will bless their hearts and know that it'll make you happy it'll make us happy by the grace of the Lord now we said this earlier the Lord rate makes rich and poor but yet he gives free more agency and opportunities so you know God has God has a position for both of us but or for each of us whether rich or poor but even within that we have to be faithful with what he's given to us so let's go through these scriptures I think you understand what I'm trying to say in other words you could increase your money or you can lose your money you know you can be faithful with your money or you can be unfaithful happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understanding for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the game there have been fine gold she is more precious than rubies and all the things that thou canst desire not to be compared into her length of days is it a right and in her left hand riches and honor amen so the wisdom of God the understanding of God is more valuable than silver or gold that's why church I don't have to watch this start stock market people ask me well you know is this the end time they've asked me should we buy gold or should we invest in silver and I'm like just invest in the Holy Ghost you don't have to worry about the value of that's gonna go down Oh what if the Holy Ghost is gonna go down in value it's gonna keep being more valuable all the time amen you're gonna go from glory to glory from a brighter day to a perfect day amen glory you're gonna go from faith to faith that's why I don't have the stocks app on my phone I don't have any stocks I don't care if it goes up or down I doesn't mean my stocks with God are going up all the time I've invested in Christ and we want treasures in heaven amen you're only gonna go up in the God stock market glory but we got to believe that we got to believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost good that's wisdom write the wise virgins had the Holy Ghost we gotta believe the baptism Holy Ghost is more valuable than our bank accounts getting our children are getting our friends or getting our parents or getting our loved ones to the baptism of the Holy Ghost is more valuable than all the money you can save up and all the interest you can make oh I believe that church don't you believe that amen more valuable than all that that's the Word of God wisdom says I love them that love me wisdom and those that seek me early shall find me did you seek him early this week aim ahead seek him early riches and honor are with me yay durable riches I like that durable see they're gonna last moth and moth will not get in and corrupt them amen how did it oh yeah my fruit is better than gold wisdom says yeah than fine gold and my revenue my yield or produce is better than choice silver to have the wisdom of God it's better than all the gains you can make on the stock market or all the deals you can pull if you're a business man or woman it's better than all the profit you can make on selling your your things on eBay or her or on Amazon it's better you get more benefit if you invest in the wisdom of God amen and they're more durable as well praise God now you know this but I just well I just had one scripture on me not lazy how long with our sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out of thy sleepy right yet a little sleeping a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep socialize of poverty come as one that travaileth and I want as in our men I see this in a lot of young men they don't get jobs that live with their parents or they bum off people they move in with that person move in with that one moving they never get the place where they can really live on their own and stand for themselves and that's because it's a lazy Spirit amen and poverty will come to the lazy person where the BAM said a person that will work is a Christian a Christian will work that's right he becometh poor that deals with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich so people who are diligent about they're faithful about their work hard-working not slack not lazy not carefree but they're diligent the Bible said they can become rich and now Church there is one good reason to become rich so you can give it all away amen that's the one reason you might want to be rich you know God gives you sometimes like I said God may allow you have choices in life well if you make a choice if you're a good a businessman investor do that so you can help somebody out how many member brother bill Dow from brother branham's sermons how many member him he's from Lima Ohio his granddaughter went to the church that I was first became in the message in down there in lima by believers he was a millionaire well guess who paid for brother Rams $40,000 IRS bill who paid for that when it was due in 1962 who paid for that a millionaire bill Dow [Laughter] Amen brother have said when he paid it he said he shouted and rejoice he said I'm free all my debts been paid I'm free and he said I'm gonna pay they're build out back little by little I don't know if he ever did but see God needed a rich man to pay off the prophets debt and the church said see God has some poor God makes some rich it's a good thing build I was diligent with his money because he helped pay off a prophet's debt he wasn't slack he wasn't lazy he was a hard-working man millionaire there is that maketh himself rich yet half nothing else well this is a lot of sinners do this today they become rich but yet really they don't have anything there is that make of himself poor yet he has great riches amen praise the Lord and that beautiful God makes it turn the opposite way if you got the wrong desire God will turn it out to the bad but if you've got the right desire God turn it into good amen it looks like you're getting poor less money less money all the time but God's saying I'm making you rich I'm young letting you store up treasures in heaven brother sister oh my either love with pleasure shall be a poor man so then getting back to your people that burn up you know I've seen my friends do that my high school friends they got jobs and they would only go to work because they had to pay off all the money they spent on alcohol that weekend right or their fancy car some or their cigarettes and drugs and all these things like that that was their only motivation to go work was that on Friday when they got their paychecks they could go blow it at the bar or in the dance club in that a shame he the love with pleasure should be a poor man but he the love with wine and oil should not be rich I like this by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches honor and life Amen now I look at these four spiritual but it can be it can be natural as well like because of Solomon Solomon got rich because he was humble he feared the Lord he wanted he didn't ask for the big things he asked for the sermon he asked for wisdom to lead the people now here's where I'm saying this is the scripture where we use if you want to become rich you should become rich in order to give it all away because the Bible said labor not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom but you should labor to give right don't labor to be rich but if you're gonna have a successful business then do it to help other people out wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle toward heaven all right that's something that's ABAB we probably feel a lot of us right Oh soon as we make some money just flies the way right see you later just made this I feel like I'm finally getting ahead and there it goes it just flies away see we got to understand that God will take care of us amen God will take care of us so we labor so we work hard to give now let me tell you another testimony recently one of my friends down in the I'll just tell you it was brother Tim Humes and he he he sat on her brother Rams ministry as a child growing up and he felt led after brother man left the scene he felt led to start a church and he said it never grew his church never grew until he started doing an annual missionary meeting and then when he started bringing the missionaries every year and he would raise as much money as he could give the missionaries he said his church started expanding and spanning when they needed to build a new church and I know this I know this for a fact because I know the person one of the members in the church this business started booming he was working on the internet and his business aren't expanding and now he makes multi million dollars a year and guess where his ties go when the church needed a new church to build a church all those ties from the men's means dollars went to build this church and now it's paid for and it's just like 300 or 400 down there in North Carolina doesn't that something this this and I know this man this man's a multi you know he's made a multi-millionaire I know him but God let him me rich in order to give so the people would have a place to worship and people from all the way around the world come to this church to hear the Word of God amen glory and I like that like how God backs up that kind of effort like that God backs up that missionary effort God backs it up and so see if we're gonna labor here for if we see we're going to be pretty good financially then God's giving us that so we can give it to somebody else and not to make our lives well I'm Richard increases goods I don't have need of nothing you know that attitude you know we don't want that attitude I look at this through wisdom as a house builded and my understanding is established and by now it's other chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches so when you have wisdom and knowledge your house is filled with all these riches spiritual spiritual riches a faithful man shall bound with blessings I hope you I hope you can say that all the time my God has blessed me so much I've been saying that a lot this week God you have just been so merciful you have just blessed me with godly friends and and godly Christians but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent so see here's the sin if if God gives you ability as a businessman or woman we're not to get nervous and upset trying to get rich we're not let's we're not trying to make haste to be rich if God allows it then God allows it but God will allow us you can bless other people but see the sin is when you really want to get rich really faster you really want to make a lot of money really fast because that shows a lack of patience that shows a lack of faith and the Bible said he that haste is to be rich hath an evil eye oh I've just got to make more money any way I can make quick money anyway you see people like that they got a evil eye they got greedy they're prideful the error gets something like they've got some type of greedy spirit or something they're all just nervous about it I got to make more I gotta make more don't we know that our father owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills we we always hear that Scripture from the Psalms it's so true it's so true we shouldn't be in a big hurry to try to be rich or being a big hurry to try to get more money just trust in God just be diligent just honor God just seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things have you added unto you amen see that kind of person he doesn't consider that poverty you'll come upon him to get rich quick schemes we've all seen them the pyramid schemes that's an evil heart when you are hasting you're really nervous and anxious about getting rich real fast that's a sin there will not be innocent in the Bible says I like this prayer you remember this prayer brother Branham said this is I forget what he call this he said like the all-sufficient prayer that's not it but he C called this a very special prayer of ki King agar two things that are required of thee deny me them not before I die in other words give me these before I die gotta have these before I die two things and this is how many how do you have this prayer tonight remove me far from vanity and lies I don't want fake you know class and prestige and vanity and wasting of God's money and lies and and and popularity and famous this I would take me far away from that let me live a separated life unto God amen hallelujah that's not like our church has none of that vanity and lies in Hollywood we don't want to know Hollywood I'm spitting all over my iPad tonight I'm preaching the gospel we have no popularity here awesome we love is Jesus Christ amen and him crucified that's right remove me far from vanity and lies and the second thing give me neither poverty nor riches remember God makes rich God makes poor agar said placed me right in between brother Mansur this is one of the most stable prayers I'd been the word don't make me rich don't make me poor and this is how you know you're poor if you have to go steal or if you're tempted to steal because you don't have your daily needs that means you're poor if not then your your pride in this middle road like most of us feed me with food convenient for me lest I be full of denied he's so rich people are more likely to deny God and say who is the Lord or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of my God in vain so God said make me right in the middle my dad would always quote not always but my dad would often this scripture to me growing up because my dad you know around around time he was 33 or something like that he started really studying the Bible and he would say Lord don't make me rich Lord don't make me poor we see these two things remove all sin away from me and then let me just live right in the middle of the road I don't want to be rich I don't want to be poor I just want enough to have so I can live a life and I can rejoice in the food and my family and everything I want to rejoice now true riches of course are the attributes of Christ's character now look the Bible says the tongue everybody got tongue here tonight the tongue of the just is as choice silver God looks at your tongue and he has the value of silver the heart of the wicked is little worth the lips are the righteous feed many but fools die for want of wisdom the blessings of the Lord it maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow with it see God looks at your tongue and say my that's a valuable tongue because he or she is always giving praise to God always thanking God for the blessings that's what's valuable in the sight of God a heart that loves God is very valuable I like this a gracious woman retains honor she keeps her honor and strong men retain riches is that that's a great difference rich men just want to keep all their money but women want to keep all their godly character Amen women willing to keep their godly testimony hallelujah a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches we read that earlier see retain keep keep the honor keep the the modesty keep the holiness right keep the promise of God Jesus said I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire gold as time tested faith remember that thou mayest be rich and white raiment which is the righteousness of the saints that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes i understanding with I saw that thou may se amen that's what I say God give me time tested faith give me a righteous lifestyle and give me understanding to see the Word of God amen for every error of my life but especially with the rich in the poor help me to see this this condition poverty and shame shall be to him that refuses instruction but he that regardeth reproof shall be honored ah this is going longer than I thought it would we do not trust in riches I hope you're not trusting your job tonight hope you're not trust in your bank account tonight or your inheritance hope you're trusting in the Living God tonight the rich man's wealth is his strong City the destruction of the poor is their poverty so see a rich man he trusts in his wealth like it's a strong City armed I've got all this protection around me right I got all this security I'm so stable I'm so secure the Bible said a rich man's wealth this is a strong City and as in high wall in his own conceit or imagination see his he's just imagine he's got this money but he's just imagining that he's safe but he doesn't even understand his life is in the hand of God before destruction the heart of the man is hearty and before honor is humility a man the church have you been humbled lately guess what there's some honor coming for you down the road amen God's gonna honor you amen God my honor you and your own life God might honor you and your family God my honor you amongst the church but God is gonna honor us if we just humble ourselves amen see Church we got a strong City how many know we got a strong City it's not our wealth our strong city is our salvation in that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah we have a strong City salvation will got a point for walls and bulwarks amen glory our strong city is the salvation that we experience the deliverance of the blood of Christ amen open ye gates that the righteous nation which keepeth though the truth may intervene perfect peace now we'll keep him perfect whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee that's where peace comes from trusting in God that talk to your brother from Florida and he said ah I said what do you want talk about he said I'm frustrated and he had all these problems he said I don't even know how I stand with God and I said sir Romans 5:1 says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen if we've been baptized and if we believe in Jesus Christ the Bible said we have peace with God amen let's not feel like we're fighting a war against God when the Bible says if we believe and we've been baptized and justified in the name of Jesus we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen and the Bible said God keeps you in perfect peace when you keep your mind on him think about him all day long I was driving today to recycle and get milk I'm I'm just the prisoner to Christ all I can think about is Jesus all the time is that how you offer I'm going to get milk I'm going to recycle all this cardboard you know and all I can think about is Jesus I thought man that's this is wonderful praise the Lord oh yeah if I even tried to think about something else it always comes back to Jesus because he keeps us in perfect peace we learned not to worry we learned not to fret we learned not to be discouraged by keeping perfect peace hearts by trusting in the Lord and yeah we got a city and we also got a strong tower it's the name of Jesus Christ the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and is safe our security is so much greater than the rich man's Amen this is just made up it's imagination its conceit and pride but ours is the name and power of Almighty God amen that's our strong tower tonight huh I'm feeling good I finally feel like preaching now amen glory thank you Jesus amen the strong tower riches profit not in the day of wrath but righteousness deliver from death either trust his riches shall fall but the righteous shall flourish as a branch remember Steve Jobs the Apple founder he was telling people I think it's in his autobiography he was saying I have all these billions of dollars and I can't even cure this little you just liver lung cancer liver cancer that he had what good is all these billions of dollar gonna do when they can't deliver you in the day of your death oh my and thank God we got a God who can deliver us amen a God who will deliver from death hell and the grave amen we have such profit in faith there's such benefits to being a Christian hallelujah that they don't have oh god help us to remember all his benefits I like this there is that scattereth and yet increaseth see if you scatter all these seeds you'll increase and there is that withholdeth more than it's meat but at end to the poverty here it is people now this is what people are that's what we should be we should be givers we should be increasing our scattering all the time helping people helping people but see when we withhold more than we should you ever feel that little check like I should have gave a little more anybody ever felt that you don't raise your hand but see that's what the Bible says he that withholdeth more than meet attended the poverty see we got to be sensitive to how much you want me to give Lord how much should I give because we don't want to give less than we should because the Bible says we'll end up when to paying for it we have to be sense of an Oh Lord how much can I afford how much should I give how many want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit in that I do I don't want to give under I want to give exactly what the Lord would have me to give this is beautify don't know none of them none of probably member when I preach on this I preach a whole series on Nehemiah Esther all those I can't they can't they go now Joe can't member now the whole series zoobel Zechariah Hagee I preached this whole series Hagee I was rebuking the people because they spent more money on their house than God's house did you know that everybody know that the Bible the history says they went sixteen years from the the time the government shut down zerubabbel until the time Haggai and Zechariah started prophesying to rebuild the house rebuild the temple finish the temple finish the walls they spent 16 years doing nothing and God said this God said is it time for you o you to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lay it like waste till you got a nice pretty house at home but the house of God is in shambles now therefore saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have sold much and bringing little so see God was making them not so prosperous because they were neglecting the house of God you eat but you have not enough you drink but are not filled with drink you clothed you but there's none warm and he the earnest wages earnest wages to put it in a bag with holes thus saith the Lord God of hosts consider your ways go up to the mountain and bring down wooden skies like go get some wood bring it down to the house and I'll take pleasure and I'll be glorified saith the Lord so go work go finish the house of God you look for much and lo it came too little and when you brought it home I did blow upon it why so once they did it that God blew it down why because of my house is laid waste and ye run every man to his own house now Church most of us do good job with ties and offers I'm just saying this is what God will do to people when they neglect the house of God right I'm thankful for all that you give I'm thankful for your giving I try to give as much as I can to to the church ties that offerings I try to give as much as I can but look at God's attitude towards whose house should be first God's house should be first and if not gonna put holes in your little bag of money oh my how many one honor the Lord with all of our firstfruits of our substance amen the sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he eat little or much so but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep so you see the stress that rich people get under that's why that was such a great prayer don't make me rich don't make me poor so I can at least sleep at night remember that's why Michael Jackson died remember that he died because he couldn't sleep because of all the demons that he let into his life and the man kept giving him that propofol or whatever it was and eventually gave him too much and he died because he couldn't sleep at night because of all the demon torment a Yeti is one of the richest men in the world they sold off his Munich music catalog for fifty billion dollars after he died and he couldn't sleep at night how blessed you are if you can sleep tonight I just put an app on my phone actually know how much I sleep every night now so I can rejoice and say thank you lord nine hours eight hours last night I got six hours but I want to get up early and study and pray this morning so I'm still feeling good by God's grace but see the rich they hardly can sleep they're so stressed out about their money that's right that's how we know word in our flesh if we're stressing out over money charge them that are in this world which some of us are medium some of us are close to being rich perhaps that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches don't trust in them but in the Living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy they that do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate so see if you're richer we got a lot of money we got to be ready to do good we've got to be we've got to do good because when we do it we're laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life amen see that people will be able to possess eternal life because they were ready to give to others if we give to others God will give us eternal life hey man that's the Word of God and be thou diligent you know the state of thy flocks and look well till I heard let's stand I'm gonna I better stop let's say into our feet here be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy herds for riches are not forever and Duff the crown endure to every generation no does it I'm gonna skip this part but God only asked you to give out of your ability God's not gonna ask you to give something you don't have God's only gonna ask us to give what we do have I'm gonna skip all that I got all these scriptures on this I'm gonna skip that I'm gonna go right to the end did you know brother Branham said he gave ten or twenty thousand dollars to people over the years guess how much that is today if you do the inflation calculator at this government website if he gave anywhere from ten to twenty thousand dollars he gave anywhere from eighty two thousand dollars to one hundred sixty six thousand dollars away he gave that away brother Branham did now what kind of life did he live did he live a life that was where the gospel absolutely over the years so let's say you make fifty thousand a year you tithe five thousand maybe you give a you know thousand of offering I don't know multiply five thousand time in ten years right well after 10 years you give him fifty thousand dollars to God and this is what he gave he said just the people that would come to the door he said like a man that says I need any tires he said there's ten or twenty thousand dollars on the books from these years that I'd give out like that people just come to his house and ask for things 20 I'm sorry 10 to 20 which was 82 to a hundred sixty-six thousand he just gave away and you know I program did that because he was a righteous man the righteous consider the cause of the poor but the wicked regardeth not to know it I don't want to hear about your complaining I've got money problems - I don't want to hear about it see that's wicked we should try to give if we have it to give remember there's a time to get a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away we cast our bread upon the waters the Bible said to return to you at the right time that is everything okay back there huh okay all right I didn't know if there's okay thank you in closing we need to see Jesus in our poor friends because the Bible said he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord so when you give to that poor person it's like giving to God God's right there Jesus is right there like lending to God and that which he hath given will he pay him again how many have seen that to be true you give to the poor God will bless you some time later on there'll be a season where you get blessed Jesus told the disciples he said if even you give a cup of water unto the little child in the name of a disciple you'll have a reward remember Jesus gives eternal life to those who are who fed the hungry who gave clothes to the naked housed the stranger and visited the sick in the prison the sick in the hospital is in prison Jesus gave eternal life to them remember the prob one woman she stretched out her hand to the poor she reaches forth her hands to the needy many daughters have done virtuously but she's excels Imam I don't know I love this I know the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poor if we're
