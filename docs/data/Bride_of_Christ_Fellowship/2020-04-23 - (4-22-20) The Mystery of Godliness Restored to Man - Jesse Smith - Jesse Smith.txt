[Music] well let's take our Bibles here today by the grace of Lord let's go to first Timothy chapter 3 then we'll go to Philippians 4 so first Timothy chapter 3 by God's grace would like to preach on the mystery of godliness restored to man it's going to take numerous sermons imagine Oh feet maybe five or more we'll see now in Chapter three Paul as far as background he's giving qualifications for elders or bishops so pastors and then deacons in verses 8 to 12 I'm sorry 8 to 13 and then 14 we'll pick it up there I'll read in 14 I'll read 14 15 16 and then we'll all read the memory verse verse 14 these things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth so the church is the pillar of truth it's the ground of truth verse 16 is our main scripture for the text and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory now let's go to Philippians chapter 4 verse 7 and 8 are in the three verses seven eight together let's begin on three one two three and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things amen may God add his blessings with reading his word you may be seen all right so Lord willing we like to look at this next mystery we've been preaching on numerous mysteries I think we started with the kingdom of heaven was the first mystery that we preached and then as we preached the book of Revelation series we preached the mystery of Babylon and then by God's grace we just finished up the mystery of the rapture and off and on as we preached on the soul of man we've been looking at the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory because that all ties together I want to start Lord willing as we look at this topic of godliness I want to look at brother Rams quote real quick so it's from sirs is this the end time and brother Rams talking about all the scriptures the seventh angel is gonna fulfill and all the duties that he's supposed to fulfill all the scriptures and then as as our churches familiar with many churches are in the message brother Adam shows how the mysteries of God must be finished and brother Ram references his Scofield Bible and they have eleven mysteries down at the bottom I believe after if you do a concordance search on the word mystery in the New Testament there's 26 hits on mystery and if you go through each and every one of them I've done that by God's grace twelve of them seem to be mysteries that are individual doctrines and so that's why 12 seems to fit you know twelve is a number of tribes of Israel twelve is the number of apostles it's the number of foundations it's the number of pieces of shewbread and so twelve seems to be a fitting number to speak on the mysteries of God especially with the shewbread because God's mysteries are his bread that he feeds to his people according to brother Branham and according to scripture there's numerous scriptures that refer to the bread of life Jesus is the bread of life and the Bible says we are even as a body of believers with Jews and Gentiles we are one bread and we partake of the bread of God the bread of life so I'm reading here this is paragraph 251 sirs this is the end time he says the seventh mystery of God even Christ as the incarnate fullness of the Godhead embodied in whom all divine wisdom so that's the mystery of the Godhead and then without saying the number eight brother Adam just says and godliness is restored to man then he goes the ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity found in 2nd Thessalonians and so forth and he says the tenth mystery is the seven stars of revelation 1 verse 20 all right brother ham says that some of the mysteries the Angels supposed to wind up all the mystery he said the mysteries of God all right so we're gonna preach or willing off of my notes that I've been writing here for the next book and we started with that first quote and I just want to say this on to my personal conviction I think of all the 12 mysteries of the New Testament I think this may be one of the most confusing for message people ok so there's we know there's 12 and we know almost every one of these mysteries is confusing to the nominal church world I mean some of them are are pretty easily understood such as Jew and Gentiles one church but you know I've talked to new first people in person over email text and most people that go to churches today in just regular churches outside the message they have a hard time with the Godhead they have a hard time even even confessing that the church is the Bride of Christ I remember when I when we first put our church online I had numerous people contact me and say oh the name of your church isn't scriptural and we're not you shouldn't call yourself the Bride of Christ well yet there's so many scriptures that call the New Testament church the wife and Jesus Christ as the bridegroom and so there's a lot of people that struggle with that one we know there's a lot of people that struggle with Mystery Babylon as the Roman Catholic Church most people struggle with Christ in you the hope of glory right most people have a hard time with that doctrine because they think as soon as you say a prayer oh I invited Jesus into my heart and and now I've got now I'm born again but that's not true they're forgiven they're justified they're there they're accepted but they're not quite filled yet because they're not sanctified yet as Jesus said there's three steps to maturity we'd say justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and this mystery the mystery of godliness lays out even more details of the growing process we'll call it like that and so that's my personal opinion that this mystery of godliness is the most confusing to message people I could be wrong on that but that seems to be the case now as I was led of the Holy Spirit I believe to start studying this and teach on this years ago I think it was in 2013 the Holy Spirit took me to the seven seals and showed me how every time brother Branham got a fresh revelation from by vision or from directly from the angel the Lord as he preached the seven seals he said and the quotes are easily found in the seven seals he said I'd spend the rest of the day running those words down through the concordance for example oil and wine he would spend the rest of the day looking at every time oil and wine is mentioned in the scripture he did it with a horse a beast as a power right he did it with the colors white red black and pale he was run running those down through the scripture what his white represent that's why at the beginning of 1960 and 61 brother Adam was confused about the white horse rider because he he was using white to always symbolize Christ's righteousness with the the first white horse rider but then when God opened it up it was the Antichrist spirit and so then you then other scriptures open up later how even satan transforms himself into an angel of light and so the revelation of the Holy Spirit tears the confusion off of the Bible right it it tears the veil off Scripture and then you have the right understanding and then when you look to the concordance and look to the Word of God you can see how the symbols and the meanings of words all fit together to be rightly divided to the word of truth so in my personal experience that's what I did because we know godliness is the sixth step on the statue of a perfect man and that's not according to brother Branham necessarily it was first according to Peter the man who had the keys to the kingdom praise God and God just gave brother Branham the present-day understanding of it but no doubt Peter had that understanding first because he wrote about it praise God in his second letter and so with that kind of background we move now to teaching on godliness so our scripture is first Timothy 3:16 so Paul's laying out all the attributes of our real pastor and a real deacon and even a pastor's wife and a deacons wife right they have to be holy as well and then he talks about behaving yourself in God's house and then goes in this description of Jesus Christ he said so there's there's no controversy so it's it's not debatable right there's no debate the great is the mystery of godliness so what's interesting is that marriage is called a great mystery right this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church and this subject is also called a great mystery praise God so in other words is going to take a greater studying of Scripture and revelation of the scripture from the Holy Spirit in order to understand this mystery praise God that's why most message churches and most denominations have no idea about the revelation of the mystery of godliness but thank God Jesus has revealed it to us praise God amen and for that we're grateful we're eternally grateful because it shows us that we can know where we are where we stand with God where we where we were where we currently are and where we need to go praise God in other words it's our roadmap to holiness praise God amen just as Jesus is the highway to holiness praise the Lord now so godliness is a mysterious yet obtainable level of Christian character so it's a level godliness is a level of action in a Christians life it's a level of daily living in a Christians life like Paul said in Philippians 3:14 he said we are to press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus so what is this prize is this level of godliness to obtain character Christ now if you look in the Greek which brother branham did that as he taught many subjects like the Godhead like when he looked at a morphate with Jesus was in the form he became in the form of a servant and Philippians 2 but now with godliness when you look in the Greek it means reverence respect and piety towards God so other words for reverence might be loyal faithful devoted or dutiful praise God so this is a mystery of loyalty praise God amen it's the mystery of faithfulness praise God in your christ-like character brother ramps of godliness is simple a description he said you're being like God right because you're godly praise the Lord you're loyal like God Amen you're faithful like God and so it's God's invitation it's our opportunity to be like him a lot of people think well I can't be like God now it's true as far as God's unlimited power and is immutability of course you know we cannot be like God but Jesus says you can reach a very godly state because Jesus says in Matthew 5:48 he says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now there's two thoughts on this scripture because we know perfect means complete right so God doesn't mean sinless it just means you've come to completion and so Jesus is asking us to come to a completed product come to a complete level of loyalty or maturity the highest level of loyalty that you can achieve Jesus says I'm going to strive for that try to be perfect try to come to completion now that's the first thought the second thought is that we are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ amen so our souls are perfect so there's two thoughts on Jesus saying be perfect he's saying he's saying submit your will that you can reach a very loyal character but he's also saying I'm making your soul perfect because I'm sealing your soul I'm I'm sharing my nature with your nature praise God I'm giving you an anointing in your soul my life in your soul and then that makes your soul perfect spotless the Bible calls it blameless the Bible calls it incorruptible praise God so your soul can be perfect your soul can be incorruptible the nature that lead your mind and causes your mind to bring your body innocent objection praise God so we can be like God to an extent not to the phonus will never be exactly the full glory of God of course but we can reach a high level of faithfulness like God amen so it's a state of loyalty or state of reverence that you live in your life so if Jesus asked us to be perfect writers there must be a way to get there and that's what this revelation is all about amen he said great is the mystery of godliness and he went through what Christ did God became flesh was justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles Christ was preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and Christ was received up into glory so to understand godliness you have to look at Paul's context it was the life of Jesus Christ in other words Jesus Christ's earthly life manifested true godliness we're only going to know godliness by looking at the life of Jesus Christ and thank God we got four devoted books to that right Matthew Mark Luke and John of course other ones mention it but if we want to know what godliness looks like in someone's human life we must only look to Jesus Christ now we know he was truly tempted the Bible said he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities that feeling you you get when you're tempted to lie Jesus knows what that's like that feeling you're tempted you know whether it's physically or lust or it's an anger or bitterness or it's a cheat whatever feeling you get Jesus knows exactly what that feels like and yet he was able to overcome that with at each and every battle that say in the bra upon him he was able to overcome it by casting down anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God you wouldn't entertain it he wouldn't enjoy it he cast it down by the power of speaking God's word amen it is written it is also written praise God so Christ is the epitome of godliness this is because he lived by every word that proceedeth on the mouth of God so if you want to understand godliness we just gotta look at the character of Jesus Christ now how did Jesus manifest godliness it's very scriptural it's in Luke 2:49 and Luke 2:52 Jesus grew in godliness by constantly increasing his wisdom or fear of the Lord right because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so given overnight even at 12 years old Jesus's heart was burdened he just wanted to do the father's business right but the scriptures right after that tell how he grew in godliness the Bible said he increased in wisdom that's why church with each service and I've said it before try to get just a couple things if you only get one thing to instantly take and apply to your life get that one thing and get that increase that God wants you to get now my life I often see it the easiest application as I can see when we've had preachers preach on things I need like prayer like I need help with my prayer life and a preacher will preach something and I can instantly go and take that and apply that to my life and begin working that into my prayer life and then I see improvement praise God but Jesus increase in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and in man so God gave him more favor and man gave him more favor so church always you know we're not always gonna have persecution if we're obeying God and loving God and and submitting to God there's so there's a period of Jesus's life right where he wasn't being persecuted these first 30 years he just got more favored with men all the time he got more favored with God all the time so we know there's times and seasons for everything we know at the beginning of his Holy Ghost film ministry everybody loved him he had multitudes following him but when in the second phase when he started prophesying especially against the religious groups that's when the big crowds left him and eventually they crucified him but this is how Jesus grew in godliness by increasing his wisdom and how do we get wisdom it's revelation of God's Word praise God because number Paul said you must receive the spirit of revelation in the wisdom of God amen wisdom is skillful decision-making so as you seek God what do I decide about this next step this relationship or this job or so Christ increased his devotion to God and his loyalty loyalty to God his godliness increased now what's the confusion because this is a mystery so what's the confusion that message people or even any denominational people have about godliness well with message people the confusion is when is it but when is it achieved most people believe you get born again first justified sanctified Holy Ghost filling and then you start working your way up the statue program man but I believe that the the Bible truth is exactly opposite you start with faith and work your way up and get the godliness and then brotherly kindness and then you get born again I believe that's the scriptural path on how godliness works but the confusion in most churches is about human effort and even its attainability right because most churches will say well your your preach and legalism now brother Jesse err oh we can't obtain that or just sinners saved by grace which we are sinners saved by grace but Jesus says be therefore perfect and there's numerous other scriptures we'll get to that speak about this so it is it how much effort is required can it even be attained is it legalistic to preach this and then as we start talking about this particular confusion we go back to the works versus faith debate right so this all this age-old debate is revived when you come to godliness but you study God's Word as we start studying this and looking down in these scriptures and course we'll get back to the Philippians series as well will kind of keep I like to keep two series going at least at a time God's Word settles this once and for all because the revelation of God unfolds as you start digging through the scriptures searching the Scriptures daily right well things be so so now let's look at Bible evidence for the revelation now I'm going to begin with Jesus so is human effort required or not okay and I want to just say this real quick remember the Bible says we're saved by grace through faith so we have to have faith to be saved but what motivates faith remember the scripture how does faith work parfaits works by faith which worketh by love so Galatians says then also that in Galatians so we are saved by faith but what actually becomes before faith love so children when you first see Jesus on the cross and you hear a preacher bottom what do you do you hate him or love them loving them and then that love motivates you to work right so when it comes down to the works verse faith debate it's a it's not a very Bible based debate right because we we don't work if you're working by your own strength then yes works will fail that's what the law was about but if you're working by love if love motivator works as Paul writes if anybody knew about works versus love right or a faith works it was Paul Paul said my faith works by the love of God in me and we know faith is a gift right so God gives you that gift of faith when he sees you love him and now Jesus I had to back around that to get to this Jesus settles it forever how much effort is required so Matthew 22 children can unit Matthew 22 actually why don't you guys go to mark 12:30 I'll read Matthew 22 37 to 39 how much human effort is required the four-letter word tells you how much Jesus said unto him thou shalt love l.o.v.e love how much love it's a three-letter word thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and Great Commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself praise God so how much effort is required all of your love that's what's required right because everything else hangs on these to love the Lord your God and love your neighbor as yourself everything else hangs on that so human effort is required all of it because it's all your strength let me read that in mark 12:30 Jesus says all your strength is required all your human effort this is the first commandment praise God so the very first thing we need to know is that we must give all of our strength all of our human effort to God but it must be motivated by love so start with do I love God's Word or not and start go back to that yes I love so I will give all my effort all my human effort to become more like God amen praise God so Jesus answers this age-old question works or faith well it's love because love love is first faith works by love faith is a gift God gives you salvation when he sees you love him praise God now I want to bring this fresh thought I just had this thought tonight and I've had it before but he just came to me right before a service so listen now some people say oh no effort is required for salvation Saints if no effort is required for salvation then all sinners are going to be saved right that means Judas is scared it's going to be safe because there's no effort required that means Jesus is going to take that rich man out of hell that he talked about that was mean to Lazarus the ripped of the beggar but yeah Jesus said he's got to stay there because you can't pass between the bosom and the fire so see it's ridiculous to say that no human effort is required it's ridiculous there has to be some human action that humans make that are saved they have to do something that to meet God's condition brother Graham says over and over we have to meet God's conditions right the reason people are lost is because they refused to love God down in their souls we must do something and that is love God because once we have love faith will work by love in our hearts I hope that's a blessing praise God we yeah I hear preachers say it all the time any time now not message preachers but you know regular preachers that are outside the message anytime a preacher starts preaching about a specific act of sanctification let's say men not smoking or are men not cussing or women wearing modest clothes they instantly go to the evangelical preacher was attacking the Mormons now I believe the Mormons have a lot of wrong doctrine I don't know if they're saved hopefully some of them are but Mormons really emphasize good works well as soon as they say good works that evangelicals say we can't do anything to be safe what do you mean we can't do anything now it's true we I mean in one way but it's wrong another way yes Jesus did all the sacrificial work for our salvation but yet he can't force us to receive it right he can't force us to act upon it right because the Bible says whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen you got to call you have to have a desire a deep desire to call and Jesus said you must take up your cross and follow me if you want to be saved if you want to be a disciple so see people will use that that phrase where oh we know there's nothing we can do to save ourselves well that's true we didn't save ourselves Christ died for us his blood as we went over on Easter paid all the price but we have something to do we have to love God and by loving him we'll use all of our strength to obey Him we'll choose to obey Him with all of our strength and that means that will mean turning down evil works right children and doing good works that's why Paul said be zealous for good works so back to the works verses faith which one is it well I'd say it's neither I'd say if it's one of the other it's faith right I'm still working with some of these thoughts but first before faith you have to have love because faith works I love praise God all right so that may surprise people and maybe in our church people have never heard me preach that but listen church the Bible's plain every action is based upon love whether it's God's love or perverted love and that scriptural now guide john 3:19 and Lydia second Timothy three four so these scriptures will prove it G again Jesus proves this I'm not making this up this is Jesus Christ saying all your strength is required if you want to be godly all of it's required but it's got to be motivated by love praise God okay so Lydia Malachi John 3:19 [Music] hey men so right after Jesus says for God so loved the world that He sent His Son he says this is the condemnation men love darkness rather than light why do people go to hell they love darkness instead of loving Jesus Christ so see all their sinful acts are motivated by a perverted love right it's not agapo it's figlio human a human perverted love can everybody see that they're lost because of their love their their perverted love and then Lydia second Timothy three four okay Paul says in these last end times they'll be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God it didn't say they didn't have any of them for God because they have a figlio love for God you know they see the beautiful sunsets and maybe God will heal them or God will spare somebody's life No I have some type of figlio love but then when it comes down to obeying God's Word or doing pleasures they go get drunk right or they get married a third or a fourth time or they commit fornication or something like that or some evil wickedness right so we need God's agape love in our hearts right and then faith will work based upon that love all right and so Jesus silences anyone even who's listening now who could be or in the future on the archive Jesus silences anyone who's trying to accuse us of being legalistic because legalism is excessive adherence to the law in other words legalism is adding something to the word remember God's Word says we can't and I add or take anything away ha verse 35 and 6 says add thou not his words lest I become a liar revelation 22:18 and 19 says do not add to the Word of God or else plagues will be added to you on examples when the Galatians were getting tricked into adding circumcision back into the faith of Jesus Christ Paul call that legalism he said that's falling from grace so Jesus never asks us to do anything outside of his commands and what was his top command give all your strength give all your human effort praise God give all your love to God Almighty praise God all of it and that's how we'll get to godliness or loyalty that's why people are loyal or faithful as they should be right especially people that sit around the message many should be more loyal they should be more faithful they should be more dutiful right but they're not because they start falling out of love they've their first love amen there it is Bree Scott I don't know if I got that on my notes don't write that down that would be a good spot to add that that's one of those that fresh scriptures that will come right when I'm preaching and I didn't really have planned on coming all right so Jesus doesn't ask us to add for the word he just empowers our human effort by his love and that's the scripture so let's read this one Malachi can you read Romans 5:5 that guy's going to read Romans 5:5 it's just how Pais empowers your effort praise God so how do you get love the Holy Ghost sheds it into your heart so you gotta pray you gotta contact God got to repent right get out of the sin get out of the get out of the condemnation the guilt and when you get in God's presence ask him to forgive you his presence anoint you right in his friends is fullness of joy and that anointing that Holy spending brings the love of God and then with that love then you have good works your faith will start working hallelujah praise God oh thank you Jesus it's a great mystery hallelujah the mystery of godliness whoo hallelujah now obeying God with all your effort through love is attainable but it comes through self crucifixion so Lydia Luke 14 27 Keysha can read Romans 8:13 then Lydia died give me one okay and then Malachi Colossians 3:5 and 6 so start with Lydia in Luke 14 27 self crucifixion is how to get more love in our hearts it's glad to do okay so we want to follow Jesus to godliness a more godly life we have to take up a cross that's an across his crucifixion Acacia Romans 8:13 yeah I think that's right a [Music] men mortify means crucified so if you lit just feed your flesh all the time the black dog he says Paul says you're gonna die but if you feed the white dog you've got to crucify the black dog to feed the white dog right then you live you really live you know what it's like to be a servant a love slave a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen thank the Lord hallelujah and so Paul says it anew a couple times in Romans and Colossians talks about self crucifixion of the will the human will so Malachi Colossians 3:5 and 6 mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence yeah pretty close and covetousness which is idolatry we're rich things sake the wrath of God come with amen Paul says mortify anything any sin any temptation mortify it crucify it and that's how you're gonna walk in the Holy Spirit that's not going to more godly the trouble is especially message churches we hear this and people are like they're like Israel coming out of Egypt they pass through the waters they get baptized but a lot of people this my own opinion they getting that hot desert of sanctification and pretty soon they they don't mortify the deeds of the flesh and then pretty soon they might not say it out loud but you can tell by their life they're complaining like I guess were they murmured a complaint against the preach in and the direction the preaching was going and everything and it happens a lot around this message and people will never get over into the promised land where their life can get placed they get placed in their position they know their gifts they know their calling in life they know God's perfect will for their life and they're actually obeying it with a God for their life how many people do you know like that very few and so see it's it's because that hot desert they they don't they cater to the flesh rather than crucifying the flesh and of course Paul experienced this self Chris crucifixion every day that's why I church Zdenek money but I made that morning routine video it's so scripturally true if you want to get closer to God you have to die daily it has to become your habit to read your Bible every morning your habit to pray your habit to study the scripture and meditate upon the Word of God it has to become your habit because Paul said I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord I die daily I die daily forming uh forming a streak of good habits is so important because remember bad habits are bad spirits they're evil spirits that's the reason people can't grow in godliness because they've got evil spirits up here mostly up here most of them are religious spirits right because they lack religious though we'll get to this my this is a good thought form of godliness they'll have a form of godliness which is a religious spirit they'll do all the certain things but when it comes down to their daily life are they daily crucifying the lusts of the flesh and forming godly habits on a daily basis that right there my friends is what separates someone who's born again and someone who's not so see this is obeying God's Word by crucifying the will the flesh every day that will the flesh must be crucified Paul said I die daily now you either yield it to one of two masters right Luke 16:13 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon which is translated as riches so who's your who's your God is it God or is it riches who do you serve God or money and Paul says you either yield yourself that's why God has to send people to hell because they yield themselves to love Mammon or money or pleasures Paul says your human soul your will is what yields to either one or two masters right the white dog or the black dog Romans 613 neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead praise God and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God praise the Lord if you yield to God with all your strength and love through God's love in your heart you will achieve godliness praise God that's what Jesus said give me all your strength give me all your mind give me everything that's the first command and you'll be like God praise God amen all right I go a little bit further here I got about 10 minutes Lord willing okay yeah I wanna yeah I'll close with this this is a really good thought as far as I believe in other words I believe was from the Lord not because I'm saying it but because it's from the Lord I found this through the concordance but this is true there are two types of godliness which is why godliness is called a great mystery you say Oh what do you mean let me give you another example there are two kinds of fillings of the Holy Ghost that's a thought that came to me today allows for apparent WS Oh what do you mean they might they might question and say what do you mean there's there there's two kinds of godliness well let me ask you are there two kinds of fillings or not yes of course they're hard there's a feeling of the human spirit right which is what Bezalel had Amos remember different people had it John the Baptist had the filling of the Holy Spirit in his mother's womb Elizabeth Zacharias so see just like there's two kinds of fillings there's two kinds of godliness and if you're a spiritual and catching it those two kinds of fillings are part of the mystery of the baptism with all the guns the re4 he's God see that so whenever there's some confusion you know there must be a mystery laying there two kinds of fillings two kinds of godliness two kinds of Christians there it is right there amen wise and foolish praise God amen hallelujah beautiful there's two kinds of faith right there's a human faith there's divine faith oh thank you Jesus praise God I felt that was just such an inspired thought because it wasn't me but the Holy Spirit directed me back to the word so the first godliness is what we started with is the godliness Jesus Christ had as he obeyed every word of God in other words the mature loyal faithful godliness that Jesus Christ embodied and this godliness comes after you're born again so you have to to godliness or to two part forms of God this one is after you're born again justification say invocation Baptist only goes born again the other one is before you're born again right just like you have one filling in your mind and another feeling in your soul thank the Lord God is so good god is so good so well so we'll start with the mystery of godliness as far as Jesus is godliness the great mystery of godliness well that's what we see first now the second type is before you're born again it's a smaller initial anointing of the Holy Spirit then you're gonna find out each one of these faith virtue knowledge each one is just a little more anointing of the Holy Spirit so they're no more because the Bible calls it measures so we're going to go through that each one is more anointed the Holy Spirit now here's here's a great mystery - you can have a great anointing on you Church and you and I know them but if we say the wrong thing or think the wrong thing that anointing leaves we're right here and it's like we got to start all over again right you got to confess your sins get your mind back on the Lord and then pretty soon that anointing you come right back to you so the second godliness is before you're born again it's the sixth step on Peters process on the steps to becoming a born-again Christian yeah Peter and Paul devote a lot of writing of course Paul because he wrote more letters Paul wrote a lot more about this mature form of godliness yeah let's just read a couple more scriptures so Lydia so Lydia if you can get first Timothy 4:7 now guys you can get second Peter 3:11 so we want to look at how both Peter and Paul these are the men you know Peter had the keys of the kingdom Paul at the dispensation of the Gentiles right Peter had the dispensation to the Jews or the ministry to the Jews this the ministry to the circumcision pi had the ministry to the non circumcision so let's let's look at Paul's words then Timothy then we'll finish with the Lord Jesus so Lydia is going to read first Timothy 4:7 so the doing okay so Paul said exercise yourself unto godliness now here's where the lazy Christian in all of us has to be crucified I've said this before I'll say it again but most people that don't exercise naturally they have a hard time exercising spiritually right because the the mind body and soul are interconnected and so a lot of times not every time a lot of times people that don't keep their body strong they get a weak body because they got a week's human spirit and they're not disciplined up here because they're not disciplined here they can't be disciplined down in their spiritual life right or in their physical body and we know brother Branham got plenty of exercise when he would preach you know there's a great strain on him preaching then going to hunt and walk for miles and miles and miles and climb mountains climb climb down and up valleys right hills valleys he did get a lot of exercise so Paul says we got to exercise this there's two kinds and if we want not really both of them you gotta exercise for but it's gonna take exercise in other words gonna take self crucifixion like Jesus said okay so Malachi can you read second Peter 3 a good read 1112 please what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for in haste and to the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire should be dissolved now look at this church Peters using fire to motivate us he said because we know there's a fire coming it's gonna burn the earth he said what manner of person should we be we know Christ is coming back before the fire well what kind of person should we be in all holy conversation and godliness we need warnings here's the man with the keys of the kingdom and he's warning them if you know fires coming in Jesus is coming to rescue us from the fire let's live a godly let's exercise ourselves in all holy conversation and godliness in other words let's act like Christ is coming and we want to escape the fire praise God so both apostles are pointing us to mature godliness and we must not miss that it's this godliness that will close like this like Christ godliness because Jesus said in John 5:19 he said I do nothing of myself but what I see the father do and this is so important for godliness Jesus kept growing in godliness because he would only do what the father showed him to do so he waited on everything he waited for the right time waited for the right season and as we approach a mature godliness we must do only the actions that God leads us to that's a big statement I know that we all wrestle with it but that's where we got to grow towards that Christ even only spoke the words God gave him John 8:38 says I speak that which I have seen with my father all right so let's stand here we'll finish with that by God's grace this thing that created me a clean heart O God brother amen when to sing that a couple weeks ago just kind of came to my mind here what a message and I'm not saying that's me I'm saying nuts the Word of God we're taking the same under the Holy Spirit that brother branham use once he saw supernatural visitations from visions and angels this Holy Spirit directed him to the word so we have to look at it every time the Bible uses godliness find out what it means so [Music] let's pray I think so thoughts that kind of way on my mind are our habits and exercise are we exercising as spiritually are we taking up the cross daily what kind of habits are we developing I mean something you do every day many times we don't have to have it because we're not in love like we should be left our first love the cross cross of Jesus doesn't impact us like it should the resurrection doesn't amaze us like it should the member the Holy Ghost sheds his love abroad in our hearts and then faith works by that love so let's have a word of Prayer here let's ask God to created us a clean heart heart full of love for Jesus I will motivate our actions tonight because number every action you do it because you love something cutter Mammon now to herself holiness or the world it's all motivated by the that's that's powerful scripture here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] created us a clean heart a heart that is full of your love agape love the Lord in the great debate is it who works or faith we know it's faith but love [Music] motivates our faith and faith goes to work or Jesus bless your people tonight they've sat through your word and been a faithful audience North Mountain I pray in Jesus name Lord God it have new hearts tonight hearts full of love they'd be so impressed with the cross so impressed with the resurrection that they'd want to take up their cross and follow you wherever you lead them deer gun I thought of thoughtful you love the flower lead or develop the most godly habits I want more anointing gear gun would you to add more portion in my life more measure of your Holy Spirit I know it's a slow process then they grow in favor with God and man each person in our church those that don't have a home church may we fear God keep your commands ro and wisdom forgive your people they have developed bad habits Lord God let me take up their cross and die daily Lord God through love you asked us to do it with all of our love all of our heart our mind and our strength help us to you to all of our human strength of you but the people experience of transforming in their lives transform their minds by the renewing of their minds Lord may they see their habits may I see my habits each one of us may we see our habits being exercised becoming more and more godly
