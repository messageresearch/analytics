[26:49] [Music]
[26:52] tonight by God's grace it's made so many
[26:58] ways for us right he is the way praise
[27:01] God the truth of the life thank God for
[27:04] all Jesus has done let's go to Luke 19
[27:07] I'd like to finish this thought about
[27:08] the parable of the pounds here tonight
[27:11] by God's grace and finish up some quotes
[27:14] on the talents like to finish this up
[27:18] Lord willing tonight Luke 19 appreciate
[27:24] those songs brother those a really
[27:25] wonderful great job ma'am Malachi and
[27:27] amen wonderful job brother
[27:29] praise God what a nice team they are
[27:32] working together praise God thank the
[27:35] Lord
[27:35] what a blessing hallelujah
[27:39] I just like to read verse 16 Luke 19 16
[27:52] let's read 16 down to 18 once again I
[27:56] just want to emphasize this thought and
[27:57] I'd like to give a lot of examples
[27:58] tonight of equal opportunities for
[28:01] Christians you know in this parable
[28:03] everybody has the equal amount in the in
[28:06] the talents everybody had a different
[28:08] amount but in this one everybody had an
[28:11] equal amount so that must mean that
[28:13] everybody has equal opportunities in
[28:15] this life praise God and there are
[28:18] numerous scriptures about how that if we
[28:22] invest God will make our lives abound
[28:24] right so we will look at the scriptures
[28:26] about abounding and multiplying tonight
[28:29] because that's what we see in the
[28:30] scripture we see that these faithful
[28:33] servants invested and then their gifts
[28:36] multiplied and their gifts abounded so
[28:39] when I look at the scripture on that
[28:40] tonight so Luke 19 verse 16 if you're
[28:43] there say Amen
[28:44] I'll read verse 16 and then wall reads
[28:49] 17 so I'll read sixteen by myself then
[28:52] came the first saying Lord thy pound
[28:53] hath gained ten pounds let's all read
[28:56] seventeen one two three and he said unto
[28:59] him well thou good servant because thou
[29:03] has been faithful in a very little have
[29:06] now authority over ten cities and I'll
[29:09] read verse 18 and the second came saying
[29:12] Lord thy pound hath gained five pounds
[29:15] and he said likewise unto him be thou
[29:17] also over five cities that's that one
[29:20] more where to prayer if you have a need
[29:21] on your heart just making known unto God
[29:22] here my hands up I have I'm in need of
[29:25] the Lord's wisdom and understanding here
[29:28] Heavenly Father Lord we again bow our
[29:30] hearts to you great waymaker miracle
[29:32] worker Promise Keeper how we love this
[29:34] seeing Lord it makes our heart when it's
[29:36] saying when we realize we're loved by
[29:38] the king of kings and the Lord of lords
[29:40] nor to think I'm a son of a king Lord
[29:43] God and our sisters here are daughters
[29:45] of the king what a privilege lord help
[29:47] us to represent that Kingdom Lord the
[29:50] kingdom of God on this earth father give
[29:52] us Grace and wisdom tonight Lord and
[29:54] understanding teach us thy word Lord God
[29:56] and most of all may we remember may we
[29:59] obey it Lord and see the blessings in
[30:01] our lives
[30:01] bless your humble servants here tonight
[30:03] each one of us in Jesus Christ name the
[30:06] church said amen god best should be in
[30:08] see the praise God let's look to the
[30:18] scripture here tonight and I like to
[30:20] finish this on the pounds and then Lord
[30:22] willing we'll get to some quotes more
[30:26] quotes about gifts let's look here at
[30:30] these rewards let's start with how all
[30:33] this is equal you know we notice how
[30:36] everybody has a equal amount
[30:38] so let's show some scripture about how
[30:42] it's essential that everyone invest in
[30:47] the opportunities god gives us so we saw
[30:52] how talents everyone had different
[30:54] amounts and that's because Jesus was
[30:56] talking preachers and
[30:57] preachers are given different amounts
[30:59] how many member brother branham said
[31:01] Martin Luther had all nine gifts of the
[31:02] Spirit yet he would smoke a pipe I don't
[31:08] know God must have blinded his wisdom or
[31:09] something through that but yet he had
[31:12] all nine gifts of the Spirit John Wesley
[31:14] had he probably had all of them too and
[31:16] we know he prayed for his horse and I
[31:17] read scriptures I read history where he
[31:20] would just he read all the scriptures of
[31:22] healing to his dying friend and then his
[31:24] friend got miraculously healed right
[31:25] there
[31:26] you know they had many gifts of the
[31:28] Spirit mighty men of God but God has
[31:30] revealed more in each passing generation
[31:33] I'll restore saith the Lord
[31:36] so God's restoring more and more of
[31:39] course and this time the mystery of God
[31:41] is finished so God has revealed all the
[31:43] all the mysteries we know to go in the
[31:45] rapture he's revealed all of them
[31:47] there's certain things he won't reveal
[31:49] there's certain things he's saving to
[31:51] show us throughout all eternity of
[31:53] course he'll never reveal the day or the
[31:55] hour of the rapture
[31:56] he'll never reveal that we just got to
[31:58] be ready for that amen
[31:59] but the rest of it as far as salvation
[32:02] it's been fulfilled you know even on
[32:05] this last I'm sorry even on the
[32:07] fifteenth parable the seed that's cast
[32:09] into the ground now 15 doesn't mean
[32:11] anything it's just my my order I put
[32:13] them in don't worry about the number 15
[32:15] you know I just I'm just saying that
[32:16] because it's 15th on my list but the
[32:19] seed cast in the ground I always wonder
[32:20] what that parable was about and now with
[32:23] the understanding of all the quotes but
[32:24] I am gave us we can see that this
[32:26] applies to the three works of grace
[32:28] because this parable we'll get to it may
[32:32] be next week Lord willing but Jesus says
[32:35] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[32:36] seed cast into the ground right the man
[32:39] sleeps he rises he doesn't know how the
[32:41] seed comes forth but it brings forth a
[32:43] blade and then the ear and then the full
[32:46] corn in the ear right and so what now we
[32:49] know Jesus said the kingdom of God is
[32:51] what it's in you so it's the baptism of
[32:54] the Holy Ghost
[32:55] so now apply what brother Graham said in
[32:57] what Jesus said about that and apply
[32:59] that to this parable about the three
[33:03] three stages of growth of a wheat plant
[33:06] so we know with all that understanding
[33:09] it has to line up and these three stage
[33:11] what three stages are connected to the
[33:13] kingdom of heaven what three stages are
[33:16] connected to the Holy Ghost baptism it
[33:18] has to be justification sanctification
[33:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God his
[33:24] mother may have said he said it's my
[33:25] message the message I've always preached
[33:27] that God works in three stages
[33:29] justification sanctification baptism of
[33:32] the Holy Ghost so see Church I believe
[33:33] God is revealing more and more of these
[33:36] things to us why so we can know them and
[33:38] we can be assured of the message that
[33:41] we've heard amen because you know
[33:43] there's many scriptures I can't get
[33:45] tonight but Paul always one of the
[33:47] hearts of the people to be established
[33:49] that means he wanted us rooted and
[33:51] grounded he didn't want us wondering if
[33:53] are we in the truth or not is this the
[33:55] right thing or not but I believe the
[33:57] Holy Spirit has been here it's here in
[33:59] the message it's here backing up the
[34:01] message that God gave us it's here to
[34:03] reveal more of the word to prove to us
[34:05] that the mystery of God is finished and
[34:07] that we have received the truth and we
[34:09] must remain planted in Christ amen so
[34:14] now back to the the talents here I'm
[34:16] sorry the pounds so each servant has an
[34:21] equal amount of money and this is
[34:23] totally different than the parables
[34:25] where they had differing amounts so if
[34:27] here money's equal so it can't represent
[34:30] spiritual gifts because gifts are not
[34:32] given equally right the Bible said do
[34:36] all speak in tongues no do all prophesy
[34:39] no are all apostles no right and then
[34:42] Paul said I speak in tongues more than
[34:44] everybody right so he had such gifts and
[34:47] such he had to bend a five town preacher
[34:49] if there ever was a five town preacher
[34:50] it had it been so laboured more than all
[34:53] of them abundantly
[34:54] so Paul preachers would have different
[34:57] gifts because their leaders and apostles
[34:59] and after you Americans and wonders to
[35:02] take the gospel to new places here what
[35:06] could be equal amongst all Christians
[35:08] what do we have all in common and the
[35:11] answer is we all have one opportunity we
[35:14] all have one life right now and there's
[35:18] even more to it than that we all have a
[35:21] home right we
[35:24] have a job most of us have a job or if
[35:27] we're not working a job we're working in
[35:28] the home as mothers right or
[35:29] grandmothers that's a job
[35:31] it's just as real it's probably harder
[35:33] than the other job right even though
[35:36] they're not paid God's gonna pay em amen
[35:39] you all have family all family members
[35:42] that's equal we all friends we are
[35:44] friends we can witness - right that's
[35:46] equal and we all have access to some
[35:49] money right that's equal everybody has
[35:53] equal access so this is as I was
[35:56] meditating and praying on this text
[35:58] these are the thoughts that came to me
[36:00] my we have all these equal things it's
[36:02] equal it's not different
[36:03] bangs got as many hours of the week as I
[36:07] do right you've got as many hours and we
[36:11] as many minutes as as others and we can
[36:13] choose well it's our choice with what we
[36:16] do with that equal amount of time and
[36:19] let me show you I made a list one year
[36:22] and I don't have it ready so I'm not
[36:24] gonna worry about it but I have a copy
[36:26] in there if you'd like a copy I made a
[36:28] list of all the rewards Jesus offers to
[36:30] everybody see that there's are so many
[36:34] rewards that Jesus offers and it's
[36:36] equally given anyone if they invest in
[36:40] the kingdom of God can earn these
[36:41] rewards so let's go through them quickly
[36:44] Matthew 5:11 if you withstand
[36:46] persecution it yields a great heavenly
[36:49] reward so standing firm in the midst of
[36:52] persecution you get a reward and the
[36:54] Bible says all who live godly in Christ
[36:56] Jesus shall suffer persecution so that's
[37:00] one another thing that's equal
[37:01] persecution rejection right next giving
[37:06] alms in secret Jesus didn't say if you
[37:09] want to give alms he said when you give
[37:11] alms do it in secret Matthew 6 4 so
[37:14] that's an equal opportunity everybody
[37:16] has a chance to see someone poor and
[37:17] maybe help them out with a couple bucks
[37:19] or just take them a lunch if you don't
[37:21] trust them with cash take them a lunch
[37:22] they comes everybody has a equal
[37:25] opportunity we all know people that are
[37:27] hurting right financially we can take
[37:29] anybody a lunch or meal
[37:30] how about praying in seeker everybody's
[37:33] got some place they can pray in their
[37:34] house hopefully hope you have some
[37:36] private place you can pray
[37:38] everybody can pray it's it's an
[37:40] opportunity and Jesus said if you pray
[37:42] I'll reward you openly fasting everybody
[37:45] can fast now nursing mothers I wouldn't
[37:47] advise it I don't see that in the
[37:48] scripture but if you're nursing I would
[37:50] imagine don't fast unless the Lord lead
[37:53] you but you got to feed that baby and
[37:56] you know one hurt yourself but everybody
[37:59] else has the opportunity to fast Jesus
[38:01] and say if you want to Jesus actually
[38:03] said when I leave
[38:04] that's when my servants will fast so we
[38:07] to be a people who fast from time to
[38:08] time now it's got to be led of the Lord
[38:11] right it's gotta be let allured and of
[38:12] course she'll be you'll be tested and
[38:14] fasting
[38:14] remember when Daniel tested three weeks
[38:16] it wasn't a complete fast he just let
[38:18] off all the wine and all the meats all
[38:20] the fancy food so he must have went on a
[38:23] vegetarian diet or something like that
[38:25] or a wheat or grain diet or something
[38:27] like that it's a very simple diet he
[38:29] just drank water no wine just water and
[38:32] vegetables for three weeks and that's
[38:34] when God you know we looked at that a
[38:35] few weeks ago with the kingdom of God
[38:36] how Michael helped the angel break
[38:39] through and defeat the Prince of Persia
[38:41] and bring down the answer to Daniels
[38:44] prayer also receiving a prophet or a
[38:47] righteous man yields a prophet or
[38:49] righteous man's reward brother Branham
[38:52] said that's just the benefits of knowing
[38:53] a prophet now I feel like this I've
[38:55] heard so many testimonies like this I'm
[38:57] sure sister Karen has and Brenda over
[38:59] the years people will listen to brother
[39:01] branham's sermons and get and get
[39:03] discerned in brother branham's sermons
[39:04] like they'll have someone in the prayer
[39:07] line who's that has the same problem or
[39:09] the same name and then God heals them
[39:11] I've met numerous people that have done
[39:13] that and bo-ram said that's a Prophet's
[39:15] reward it might come in handy sometime
[39:18] so church that's why you listen to
[39:20] brother Branham keep reading brother
[39:22] Branham there's no there's a one there's
[39:23] a nice quote where Bram says and it
[39:25] really encouraged me he's talking about
[39:26] pastor Smith how pastor Smith was such a
[39:28] good man that really encouraged me
[39:32] pastor Smith but see I kinda I needed
[39:35] that little encouragement you know he
[39:38] said all paths are smooth he's such a
[39:39] good brother you know but but that
[39:43] that's the benefit and church the other
[39:45] benefit let me say this is that you and
[39:47] I know the pillar fires here
[39:50] because he backs up the word that
[39:53] brother branham brought because we know
[39:55] now we know what the Holy Spirit is it's
[39:57] the pillar of fire and he's returning in
[40:00] the end time right because as he was
[40:02] with Paul he's returning in the end time
[40:03] because God sent a prophet the pillar
[40:05] fires here in other words the Holy
[40:07] Spirit's here praise God another benefit
[40:10] like I said on Wednesday I don't know if
[40:12] y'all heard it but when I went to Iowa
[40:13] on Saturday night I preached and I was
[40:16] closing with talents and I've said
[40:18] brother come up here and I kind of hold
[40:20] him up and I said let's pretend you meet
[40:21] Jesus and Jesus will say what did you do
[40:24] with the talent that I gave you and he
[40:26] told me later after the service he said
[40:28] there was a total discernment because he
[40:30] used to be a song leader and he felt bad
[40:32] because he stopped song leading and he
[40:34] was telling the people that he was
[40:36] neglecting his talents so everybody knew
[40:39] it I didn't know it was him I didn't
[40:40] know what was going on I just had come
[40:41] up here and so after we got in the back
[40:44] he fell on his knees that no one asked
[40:46] him he just found a zz said God Jesus
[40:48] Christ is speaking to me right now
[40:49] he said you brothers pray for me so see
[40:52] that's like the spirit of discernment it
[40:54] discerns what's in people's hearts and
[40:56] lives and he's the only one I caught up
[40:58] to the front to do that to and I didn't
[41:01] plan that it was just letter the Holy
[41:02] Spirit and then the next day there was a
[41:05] preacher sitting right up front I didn't
[41:07] know it wasn't brother Brooks it was the
[41:08] other preacher and I started preaching
[41:10] on the four horse riders and how the
[41:12] white red black and pale how Satan works
[41:15] in that way to divide churches and here
[41:21] because he goes out he first comes in
[41:22] real sly like white and then he starts
[41:24] killing people's influence or gossip in
[41:26] the church he'll start two groups in the
[41:29] church and third is the black that's the
[41:32] money and the kingdom building so a
[41:34] prize up in the church and divided the
[41:36] church against the pastor to get tithing
[41:39] and money and build his own kingdom and
[41:41] then they go into spiritual death if an
[41:43] avenue they never repent and little did
[41:46] I know but the preacher that was sitting
[41:49] right there he did that to brother
[41:51] Brooks he brought his truiy
[41:55] or that they were all there that came to
[41:56] the church they were there for a while
[41:58] all happy one family but then he started
[42:00] pulling the people away and started a
[42:01] little church in his basement to get the
[42:03] tithing and brother
[42:04] Brooks brought him back just he invited
[42:05] him to come to our services when I was
[42:07] preaching there I said I said brother
[42:09] Brooks now that stuff between you and
[42:11] him you got to go deal with that by
[42:12] God's grace right I'm preaching right in
[42:15] front of him like I'm standing like
[42:17] right in front of him preaching like
[42:18] this right right there and you look
[42:20] nervous the whole time I wonder if now I
[42:22] know why he wasn't really into the
[42:24] preaching see because Satan hates to be
[42:28] exposed see so we have the pillar of
[42:32] fire here
[42:32] he's discerning our life because he's
[42:34] the word and the word is a discerner of
[42:37] the thoughts and hence of the heart the
[42:38] thing to do though is recognize when
[42:40] he's discerning our word that's the time
[42:42] to believe because even brother Rams get
[42:45] the discernment but medicine my gift
[42:46] can't make you believe you've still got
[42:48] to accept it
[42:49] amen so if the Holy Spirit discerns your
[42:52] need or desert something you need then
[42:54] it's your time to rise up in faith and
[42:56] say okay I know God's here he's gonna
[42:58] answer my prayer hey hey man and that's
[43:00] where I need to grow and we all need to
[43:02] grow in that recognizing his presence
[43:04] and accepting his word amen now you know
[43:10] Matthew 25 the parable of the white
[43:12] throne judgment sheepish goats there are
[43:15] six things the people will do and
[43:17] they'll get eternal life for those six
[43:18] things next Matt mark 941 giving an
[43:24] apostle a cup of water for Christ's sake
[43:27] yields a reward Luke 6 loving your
[43:32] enemies blessing those who persecute you
[43:34] praying for those who despitefully use
[43:35] you and lending with no hope of
[43:38] repayment yields a great reward along
[43:40] with the title of being called the
[43:42] children of the highest I preached a
[43:44] Iowa brother Brooke said that was just
[43:45] for him he said he's been he's been
[43:47] being used lately and he said I need to
[43:49] learn to pray for those people who use
[43:51] me so that was a blessing to me like wow
[43:54] I thought why am i preaching this he
[43:56] needed it praise God
[43:58] so sometimes we got to be used and just
[44:01] pray for them hosting a feast for less
[44:04] fortunate who cannot repay you or invite
[44:08] you over to their house Reed yields a
[44:10] recompense at the resurrection of the
[44:12] just the Bible says so when you have a
[44:15] when you have a meal at your house and
[44:17] invite people who can't pay you
[44:18] back there's a reward for that praise
[44:21] God
[44:21] of course fighting the good fight of
[44:23] faith finishing the course keeping the
[44:24] Christian faith yields a crown of
[44:26] righteousness providing a Christians
[44:28] physical necessities yields a heavenly
[44:31] reward upon the givers account like Paul
[44:33] said he said you've given it to me it'll
[44:36] bound on your heavenly account doing
[44:38] anything heartily as doing it to Christ
[44:41] yields a reward of inheritance according
[44:44] to Colossians 3:23 doing anything with
[44:47] your heart so brothers sisters we got to
[44:48] go to work tomorrow do with all your
[44:50] heart be the best you can be how many
[44:52] want to be the best you can be doing
[44:54] anything for the Lord yields a reward in
[44:57] heaven so see I want to be a teacher
[45:00] that's doing it for Christ's sake right
[45:02] I want to be a pastor doing it for
[45:05] Christ's sake to glorify Christ I'm
[45:06] working for him doing it heartily yields
[45:11] the Lord of inheritance diligently
[45:14] seeking God yields reward Hebrews 11:6
[45:17] and during temptation yields the crown
[45:19] of eternal life James 1:12 visiting the
[45:22] fatherless see anybody can visit the
[45:23] fatherless this summer I made a special
[45:26] trip to visit some children who are now
[45:27] fatherless their dad divorced their mom
[45:29] and left so we made a special trip to go
[45:32] visit them and I told the mother there
[45:34] that's why I was there to do that
[45:35] visiting the widows keeping self keeping
[45:40] oneself unspotted from the world
[45:41] yields the reward of spiritual purity so
[45:45] if you want to feel pure keep yourself
[45:46] keep the world off yet that's your
[45:48] reward I feel pure I feel like I'm clean
[45:51] before the Lord and the last one is is
[45:54] eleven fold how many know there's eleven
[45:57] rewards for the church ages two he that
[46:00] overcometh remember those there's seven
[46:02] of those statements but there's actually
[46:03] 11 different things listed in there let
[46:05] me read them to you here's your reward
[46:06] if you overcome Church the first thing
[46:09] you get to eat of the Tree of Life
[46:10] escape the second death eat the hidden
[46:14] manna you get a white stone with a new
[46:16] name within it you get power to rule
[46:18] over Nations you get the Morningstar
[46:20] white raiment you have your name in the
[46:23] book of life you're a pillar in the
[46:24] temple of God you have Jesus new name
[46:27] God's new name the new Jerusalem's new
[46:29] name written upon you and your
[46:31] with Jesus in the throne amen glory that
[46:34] makes me feel religious amen those are
[46:37] all rewards if we overcome right now
[46:39] overcome Laodicea overcome the devil and
[46:42] these are for everybody there not just
[46:44] for preachers or brother Branham there
[46:46] for everybody it's all equal praise God
[46:50] we all have equal chance to overcome do
[46:52] we not then the Bible say temptation is
[46:56] common to all men it's common if you're
[46:59] fighting something be encouraged
[47:01] somebody has already fought that before
[47:03] and you know Jesus did praise God and
[47:05] you know he overcame so you can overcome
[47:08] as well hallelujah so there you go
[47:11] Church there is a list of all things
[47:15] equal these are all equal things that we
[47:18] can new we just gotta ask the Lord lead
[47:21] me so I can invest in those things or
[47:23] show me or open my I'll said I just open
[47:26] my busy eyes to those who are hurting
[47:29] around me praise God because we're all
[47:32] busy and that's good you want to be busy
[47:34] you want to work hard I want to work
[47:35] hard I want to be busy I don't wanna be
[47:37] lazy I'd rather be busy than lazy but
[47:40] our our prayers Lord open our eyes so we
[47:42] can see some of these needs we might be
[47:44] overlooking and try to minister to other
[47:49] people who have needs praise God alright
[47:51] now let's let me do a few more quotes on
[47:54] talents and then we'll get to this
[47:56] abounding thought how the Bible says we
[47:59] do abound and multiply it's very
[48:02] scriptural let me pull this up so I
[48:03] don't miss this okay now let's get back
[48:07] to singing brother Branham has a quote
[48:08] here from 1955 about singing he says
[48:14] what a disgrace I've seen beautiful
[48:15] voices that God has given to people a
[48:17] talent and they over trained it I hate
[48:21] to hear an overtrained voice where they
[48:24] stand up and sing and get some kind of a
[48:26] note to they hold it they hold it so
[48:28] long do they get blue in the face now
[48:31] amen doesn't do that Malachi doesn't do
[48:33] that and when I love these songs I don't
[48:34] do that so I'm not preaching against any
[48:37] of our singers here just so you know but
[48:40] you've seen it you know you see it on
[48:41] the talent shows you know if you ever
[48:43] seen now of course you don't watch him
[48:45] but maybe you'll see them on Facebook or
[48:47] something like that they hold it to they
[48:49] get blue in the face just to show the
[48:51] congregation how they can hang on for
[48:54] dear life see Church that we don't want
[48:58] it we don't want to do any gift to
[49:00] impress other people we want to do it to
[49:03] glorify Christ now that's the reason
[49:06] they have talent shows is though that so
[49:08] they can impress the congregate or I'm
[49:10] sorry not the congregation well it might
[49:11] be their sinful congregation well that's
[49:14] why they do it to impress the audience
[49:15] or the judges they hold out their voice
[49:19] he said and when they come back down
[49:21] then people's not praising God their
[49:24] minds on their note that they hit you've
[49:29] all seen it even some gospel preachers
[49:31] or gospel singers they'll sing just to
[49:34] show off the note that they can hit and
[49:36] what do people clap for for the note
[49:40] many times or the ability rather than
[49:43] the praise to Almighty God now let me
[49:46] say this too let's balance balance out
[49:49] this thought about overtrain we want to
[49:52] train ourselves but we don't want to
[49:55] over train trying to impress other
[49:56] people remember the court about painting
[49:59] my man said oh if you'd only develop
[50:01] that but man was worried the gift and
[50:02] talent would be wasted right he said oh
[50:05] if I could send that boy to school or to
[50:07] really learn how to sew see you got to
[50:10] balance out all these quotes right after
[50:11] I understand what he's saying over train
[50:13] that doesn't mean we shouldn't train it
[50:16] just means don't train in the way that
[50:19] you want to impress the people train in
[50:22] a way that you can invest in your gift
[50:23] that it glorifies God praise the Lord
[50:27] he said then people's not praising God
[50:29] their minds on their note he said I love
[50:32] good old-fashioned fashioned Pentecostal
[50:34] singing where you raise up your hands
[50:37] with tears running down from your cheeks
[50:39] whether you could sing doremi faso
[50:41] latino or not and just singing the
[50:43] spirit from the heart you give praise to
[50:46] God all out of the program you have to
[50:52] get out of man's program to get in God's
[50:53] program he said oh God deliver me from
[50:57] being an actor
[50:59] be what you are god bless you you even
[51:02] down see sometimes ministers will do
[51:04] that they will get in the pulpit and
[51:06] make their voice very big now I've got
[51:08] to be careful that too sometimes but I'm
[51:10] sometimes I'm just so passionate that's
[51:11] why I'm loud but I have to watch myself
[51:14] so I don't get loud just to try to get
[51:16] an amen
[51:17] see because the Spirit of God doesn't
[51:19] matter how loud you are or quiet you are
[51:21] if it's the Spirit of God and the people
[51:23] are pulling and enjoying then this
[51:25] people will say Amen so see I've got to
[51:28] watch that he said just be yourself
[51:33] people who appreciate you more don't you
[51:35] believe that just be plain old sassafras
[51:37] hickory smoked ham sorghum molasses
[51:40] it'll do you good you won't put on I've
[51:45] tried it I've tried to be myself we want
[51:47] all of our musicians just be themselves
[51:49] praise God and everything they do train
[51:52] practice for the glory of God do
[51:54] everything for the glory of God now this
[51:57] will help our sisters here's a good one
[51:58] about a housewife but there's got a few
[52:01] few sentences before that he said just
[52:08] because you're a believer certainly you
[52:10] have everlasting life but do you want to
[52:12] just get in as Jobe said by the skin of
[52:15] your teeth would you just want to come
[52:18] before the Father and the talent he has
[52:20] give every one of you as being negligent
[52:23] you just didn't use it or let something
[52:26] else stand in your way
[52:29] you let little petty things that meant
[52:31] nothing to you after all little fusses
[52:34] and stews and arguments in church
[52:35] attendant I'm sorry Church differences
[52:37] take the meekness and gentleness from
[52:39] your life would you want to stand before
[52:41] the father like that
[52:42] I don't believe you would I don't
[52:45] believe that you would do it neither
[52:46] would I how I want him to say it was
[52:50] well done not by the skin of my teeth
[52:53] but it was well done my good and
[52:55] faithful servant enter into the joys of
[52:57] the Lord for you did well with what you
[53:00] have to do he said maybe you're a
[53:04] housewife I know we got multiple
[53:05] housewives here tonight
[53:06] if you are God made you a teacher of
[53:11] your chilled
[53:13] I know about you church but many times
[53:14] women have the gift of wisdom many times
[53:16] gift of knowledge because they have to
[53:20] teach these precious souls did you catch
[53:23] that romance had a housewife he said
[53:26] you're a teacher of your children
[53:28] remember program said who did brother
[53:31] Aaron say his correction was Mita he
[53:36] said you know my wife she's my
[53:37] correction he said he said you
[53:39] understand don't you brothers to see
[53:43] many times our sisters will have gifts
[53:45] of wisdom and alls they have to do is
[53:47] just yield that to the Holy Spirit a
[53:49] gift of knowledge to teach their
[53:51] children or to be a blessing of their
[53:53] husband or her blessing to some brother
[53:55] sister if God will lead them to share
[53:57] something he said you housewives if God
[54:01] made you a teacher of your children do a
[54:03] good job of it regardless of what you
[54:06] have to do do it well amen
[54:09] see our dad should be the best dads they
[54:12] could be our moms should be the best
[54:14] moms they should be whatever we do let's
[54:16] not be negligent let's invest in what
[54:19] God's given to us praise God he said
[54:23] don't let anything stand in your way
[54:25] housewives of being a good mother to the
[54:28] children
[54:29] praise God dads don't let one thing
[54:32] stand your way dad's to being a good
[54:33] father to your children ha ha
[54:36] hallelujah I hope that was a blessing
[54:38] you're a teacher housewives do it well
[54:41] praise God here's another one I'm
[54:44] thankful for how many thankful for
[54:45] doctors ever been helped by doctor now
[54:47] we know there's corrupt ones but there
[54:48] was corrupt preachers too you know there
[54:50] there's both sides right there's
[54:51] extremes but he said doctors have
[54:53] talents but Ram said I have high regards
[54:58] for medical profession and I didn't I
[55:00] didn't I didn't I didn't make that up
[55:02] that's what exactly what he said a lot
[55:04] of people look down on doctors but you
[55:06] shouldn't but Ram said I have high
[55:07] regards for the medical profession
[55:09] surgery and so forth who with the
[55:11] talents of God has given them to do
[55:14] certain things to the body to operate
[55:16] and remove teeth that's not that's got
[55:18] bad and so forth I appreciate that
[55:21] praise the Lord now me I don't like
[55:25] touching anything bloody
[55:27] if there's someone sick I'm like honey
[55:29] where yet darlin dr. Kristen where are
[55:32] you most the time but on me I don't
[55:35] really mind it on me so much if I got
[55:37] like a little cut or something or scrape
[55:39] I don't mind it on me but if it's one of
[55:41] the kids I get off I get all nervous of
[55:43] the lightheaded my brother will actually
[55:44] pass out if he sees blood my brother Sam
[55:47] when when they had their first baby he
[55:49] was in the delivery room and he passed
[55:51] out and he felt completely back and
[55:53] smashed his head against the ground
[55:55] because he's so nervous around blood I
[55:58] never did that but a couple times I felt
[56:00] queasy you know but he said doctors have
[56:04] talents and I appreciate them but he
[56:09] said there comes a time when they are
[56:11] beyond their knowledge they don't know
[56:14] what to do so he says then if it's
[56:18] beyond their knowledge we have a perfect
[56:20] right he said if the doctor fails to
[56:26] know it he'll go to someone a little bit
[56:29] higher than his he said and now if the
[56:32] specialist doesn't know I'm glad we got
[56:34] another resource the great physician a
[56:37] man praise God so see who use as your
[56:40] letter the Holy Spirit you use doctors
[56:42] as your lead but if they don't have the
[56:45] answer that we all all that's left is to
[56:47] go to the great physician Jesus Christ
[56:50] there's been numerous times I prayed for
[56:52] my personal doctor I prayed for him last
[56:53] time - can I just pray and he says thank
[56:56] you thank you thank you I gave my book a
[56:57] few weeks ago and I've seen him there I
[56:59] said he said Oh would you sign it no I
[57:01] don't I don't care about signing books I
[57:02] just hope he reads it but but see I love
[57:05] thank God for doctors I like to pray for
[57:08] them I like to join my friend and that
[57:10] God will bless them that they can help
[57:11] others and he told me last time he said
[57:14] of all the people I meet the people that
[57:16] pray they're the ones who get well
[57:18] faster amen he can recognize that you
[57:23] know he's not even born again but he can
[57:25] recognize my the people that love God
[57:26] and pray God heals them hallelujah now
[57:32] let me go the next one here this is from
[57:34] what is in your hand this is a good
[57:36] quote
[57:39] he says now the people that are unsaved
[57:42] they've just got a mental attitude
[57:44] towards the word they'd never been born
[57:46] again they don't know what it means to
[57:47] be baptized in the body Christ by the
[57:49] Holy Spirit let them take inventory just
[57:52] now Lord and consider and whatever you
[57:54] put in their hand may they raise that
[57:57] hand to you and give whatever little
[57:59] talent they have to you if it's no more
[58:02] than a testimony at least they've got a
[58:06] hand they can raise it and what's in
[58:09] their hand thou can place we ask for
[58:12] Christ's sake
[58:12] praise God so this is George everybody's
[58:15] got something your hand look at your
[58:16] hand for a moment everybody's got
[58:17] something in there praise God brother
[58:19] man gave the example remember Moses had
[58:21] the rod and God used the rod to bring
[58:23] judgment right bo-ram said the boy with
[58:26] the lunch what do you have in his hand a
[58:27] lunch so God used that food to bless
[58:29] other people so whatever's in your hand
[58:31] God's gonna use what's in your hand and
[58:34] multiply it if you'll just give it to
[58:36] him amen praise God said whatever I've
[58:42] got now remember about RAM I read this
[58:44] on Wednesday night I read where brother
[58:47] Ram said he said how do you know you
[58:51] don't have the gift to testify he said
[58:53] why don't you go try it
[58:55] praise God if you're not sure what gift
[58:59] you have brother ask brother Ram would
[59:00] program what if I don't have a gift by
[59:02] the Rams in other words saying well how
[59:04] do you know if you don't try you have to
[59:08] try
[59:08] you have to feel letting the Holy Spirit
[59:10] other in other words you have to
[59:11] overcome fear amen see that's that's
[59:15] what I believe got to amateurs in church
[59:17] to overcome fear so we're not afraid to
[59:21] do what we feel the Holy Spirit upon our
[59:23] hearts to do like I just felt led to
[59:26] pray for Brian Hawkins he had he was one
[59:28] that was going to have the hip
[59:28] replacements but now God healed him
[59:30] that's why I didn't I just felt led to
[59:32] do it something just came over me to go
[59:34] do it you know he's saying he's got to
[59:35] get two hip replacements I'm like he's
[59:37] 42 he's a preacher force he should have
[59:39] to have hip replacements something just
[59:41] came over me to go pray amen and then
[59:43] God answered the prayer hallelujah so
[59:46] see just trying to learn how to overcome
[59:48] fear and follow the leadership of the
[59:51] Holy Spirit
[59:53] praise God so doctors well Graham said
[1:00:00] he was so devoted to his ministry he
[1:00:02] said I come home for a little rest I
[1:00:04] lost 20 pounds in the last meeting and
[1:00:07] the brothers looked at him brother
[1:00:09] Mercer and goed he said brother Branham
[1:00:12] I noticed what about you you put your
[1:00:14] whole heart into his ministry I said
[1:00:17] that's the only way you can do a right
[1:00:19] cup for the Lord is put everything you
[1:00:21] got to the forefront for Christ or your
[1:00:25] strength or your soul or your heart or
[1:00:27] your mind everything you got when you're
[1:00:29] doing anything do it or don't do it at
[1:00:31] all
[1:00:32] see just leave it alone if you're going
[1:00:34] to be a Christian put everything you've
[1:00:36] got to Christ that's your time your
[1:00:39] talent your everything he said I was
[1:00:42] just noticing brother Byrne sitting
[1:00:44] there he said he said it's a piano
[1:00:46] whether it's an organ or some kind of
[1:00:48] instrument they make a strum and pick it
[1:00:50] do something for the Lord maybe you
[1:00:52] could do that and sing that's to win
[1:00:55] souls do something no matter if you can
[1:00:58] whistle well whistle just do something
[1:01:00] just testify or do something for the
[1:01:02] kingdom of God whatever you got put it
[1:01:05] to use in God's service hey hey man
[1:01:08] whatever you've got look in your hand
[1:01:10] whatever's in your hand do it for the
[1:01:12] Lord
[1:01:13] some of you sisters maybe could you know
[1:01:15] how to do good deals or maybe know how
[1:01:17] to sew you should make clothes for the
[1:01:19] the poor something like that that's a
[1:01:22] good ministry that's a Bible ministry
[1:01:23] Tabitha had that ministry to make
[1:01:26] clothes for the poor right remember Anna
[1:01:30] Anna's prayer ministry was prayer and
[1:01:33] fasting she did that for all those years
[1:01:36] and finally she got to see Jesus the
[1:01:38] Messiah she got the whole baby Jesus
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:41] after all those years of praying and
[1:01:43] fasting in her ministry God rewarded her
[1:01:47] with seeing the Lord's Christ amen ah
[1:01:50] there's so many different ministries out
[1:01:53] there that we can do we're all given
[1:01:55] this opportunity to do something for the
[1:01:57] Lord we've got to see what God placed in
[1:01:59] our hands now it's telling the Saints
[1:02:02] you know when I wrote when I wrote the
[1:02:03] book about modesty in Iowa they were
[1:02:06] asking me about the
[1:02:07] and they liked it and their brother
[1:02:08] Brooks has given some out and everything
[1:02:10] I said I said brothers I said I don't
[1:02:13] take any credit for that God is the one
[1:02:16] who gave me a lot of those thoughts like
[1:02:19] for example when I was in college at
[1:02:20] Akron I would go into a class it would
[1:02:23] be called a nonfiction class where we
[1:02:25] just learned about nonfiction books and
[1:02:27] in numerous of those classes the teacher
[1:02:30] would hold up examples of books and one
[1:02:34] of them is what Americans wore their
[1:02:37] clothes and their makeup from 1776 to
[1:02:40] the present time like I remember still
[1:02:43] sitting in that class on Akron's campus
[1:02:45] like that's why I'm in this class I'm in
[1:02:47] this class to get that book in other
[1:02:49] words that was what God put in my hand
[1:02:51] and that was my job to take it to the
[1:02:53] gospel amen
[1:02:55] take it to all the people that they can
[1:02:56] hear the truth about history that's what
[1:02:59] was in my hand what's in my hand I'm in
[1:03:01] a college room what's in my hand a book
[1:03:03] about my honesty and modesty so what
[1:03:08] should I do with it let God use what's
[1:03:09] in my hand aim ahead and take it out I
[1:03:12] just had a good testimony on Amazon some
[1:03:15] some stranger said the Lord directed me
[1:03:18] to your YouTube page I found your book I
[1:03:20] bought it and I know about all these
[1:03:22] copies that pass out to my family and
[1:03:23] friends I don't know her name's Kate
[1:03:25] with a caterer though see CA te she gave
[1:03:28] me a five-star review but hopefully
[1:03:30] that's because Jesus the five-star
[1:03:31] general praise God it's it's his word so
[1:03:35] he gets all the stars but she said I
[1:03:37] wasn't even looking for God brought that
[1:03:39] book to me so see there's a deep call to
[1:03:42] the deep whatever's in our hand that's
[1:03:44] what we got to give to Jesus amen
[1:03:46] hallelujah see to win so sobre he said
[1:03:49] you can win souls by playing music
[1:03:53] singing by singing you can win souls see
[1:03:57] what you'll do is your influence people
[1:03:59] to give their hearts to Christ I told
[1:04:02] you this when I gave my heart to Christ
[1:04:04] you know what God used God used Cam's
[1:04:07] Christian CDs ffh one of these days
[1:04:11] there are a Christian contemporary they
[1:04:13] don't know the message they cut their
[1:04:15] hair they wear pants you know but that
[1:04:18] is the Avenue God used to soften this
[1:04:20] stone
[1:04:21] heart amen I would drive his car
[1:04:24] his stick shift car little white Metro I
[1:04:26] think it was out to see Kristin before I
[1:04:28] was a Christian I got to see there and
[1:04:30] that cam I let cams Christian music
[1:04:32] playing pretty soon I started liking
[1:04:33] that one of these days they're gonna see
[1:04:35] Jesus in heaven and it wasn't long just
[1:04:37] a few months after that I gave my heart
[1:04:39] to Christ God used musics I'm told that
[1:04:43] the camera I want to remind him God use
[1:04:44] him and his music to win my soul amen
[1:04:48] see God gives us these gifts and it's
[1:04:51] all working to win souls remember like
[1:04:55] that man who found that you know where
[1:04:57] we spend eternity in his hand see
[1:05:00] somebody inspired God inspires somebody
[1:05:02] to make a track and to pass them out and
[1:05:06] one time it had an effect Church like my
[1:05:09] man says maybe you're just caught here
[1:05:10] to save one soul amen so save that soul
[1:05:13] with all you've got
[1:05:14] amen if five Souls or 20 Souls whatever
[1:05:18] you do do give everything you got he
[1:05:20] says put everything all your mind heart
[1:05:22] soul into what you've got your talent
[1:05:25] and God will bless it last year I got
[1:05:28] that email when someone saw my video on
[1:05:30] water baptism and the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:32] they said thank you and they ended it by
[1:05:34] saying god bless you you say my soul now
[1:05:38] I hope they keep that testimony because
[1:05:39] I didn't ask him for that they're the
[1:05:41] ones that said that is the preaching of
[1:05:43] the gospel just on the YouTube the
[1:05:45] preaching can save souls we just give
[1:05:47] everything we have to try to win souls
[1:05:49] for Christ hallelujah you're gonna like
[1:05:54] this one this one blew me out of my
[1:05:56] chair yesterday the door to the heart
[1:05:57] 1958 but Ram said n2u other ministering
[1:06:01] brothers that's been the meetings some
[1:06:02] day when it's all over just think when
[1:06:05] all these great choirs gather together
[1:06:07] won't it be wonderful so we don't have a
[1:06:11] choir here I guess well maybe nature and
[1:06:13] my girls are the choir here because
[1:06:16] they've sung together a couple times
[1:06:17] maybe that's the choir Bride of Christ
[1:06:20] fellowship choir amen he said so program
[1:06:24] sees all these choirs in different
[1:06:25] churches and he said you might say
[1:06:27] brother branham do you believe that
[1:06:29] they'll still have their talent in
[1:06:31] heaven what do you think brother Ram
[1:06:34] said
[1:06:34] certainly sure they were given that
[1:06:38] talent forever oh yeah amen
[1:06:42] they were arrested all these choirs they
[1:06:45] were given that talent for eternity
[1:06:50] program says you say that's in the Bible
[1:06:52] if you notice when the Witch of Endor
[1:06:56] called up the spirit of Samuel he was
[1:06:58] still a prophet died and he was in the
[1:07:04] heart of the earth in the bosom of
[1:07:06] Abraham and he was still a prophet a man
[1:07:09] if God give you a gift to sing you'll be
[1:07:12] singing the choir over in heaven amen
[1:07:14] hahaha how do you see so gifts are for
[1:07:20] eternity praise God didn't Jesus tell
[1:07:23] the 12 apostles and of course Matthias
[1:07:25] takes the place of Judas or mom sorry
[1:07:27] Paul takes a place actual play
[1:07:29] sympathize didn't Jesus tell them you're
[1:07:32] gonna sit and judge the 12 tribes of
[1:07:35] Israel because Apostle is the setter and
[1:07:38] order program says that's another word
[1:07:40] to say a leader and overseer so whatever
[1:07:43] they were on earth that's what they'll
[1:07:45] be in heaven
[1:07:46] hallelujah and so we must be thankful
[1:07:49] for what God's given us recognize what's
[1:07:52] in our hand be faithful with it and
[1:07:54] we'll be that forever praise God
[1:07:56] hallelujah he was still a prophet so
[1:08:01] death only moves us from a different
[1:08:03] place of abiding amen
[1:08:05] there is just for a little while for a
[1:08:08] little while and that's one that's
[1:08:10] eternal so we're looking to that day Oh
[1:08:13] hallelujah praise God that's beautiful
[1:08:16] church I hope you like that when I was a
[1:08:18] real blessing in my heart
[1:08:19] praise the Lord here's her brother M
[1:08:22] says about gifts he said God gives gifts
[1:08:25] this is from Queen of the South 58 he
[1:08:29] says he never takes gifts oh look at
[1:08:31] this he never takes gifts your gift
[1:08:36] remains but if you be honest with what
[1:08:39] you got God will take
[1:08:43] other talents and just keep pouring them
[1:08:46] on if you just keep climbing on I liked
[1:08:54] his choice of words don't you if you
[1:08:56] keep climbing up further it's climbing
[1:09:00] easier hard anybody no hard you got to
[1:09:03] be in good shape do you know there's a
[1:09:05] record number of people that died on my
[1:09:06] are Mount Everest this year because they
[1:09:08] they weren't they weren't really fit to
[1:09:10] climb and there were so many people
[1:09:12] trying to climb they got so backed up a
[1:09:14] record number of people died and one
[1:09:18] time I read the article that said this
[1:09:20] the the guy told them you have to turn
[1:09:23] around or you are going to die he told
[1:09:26] the three people in a row in his group
[1:09:28] and all three of them said no I'm going
[1:09:29] on to see if I can make it and all three
[1:09:31] of him died he said Mount Everest has
[1:09:35] never killed anybody
[1:09:36] he said it's arrogance that's killed
[1:09:38] people and isn't that the truth seek you
[1:09:42] have to spend what thirty thousand to go
[1:09:43] there and so these people spent thirty
[1:09:45] thousand they're like I'm not turning
[1:09:46] back I can make it and they died my
[1:09:49] brother man says you and I must keep
[1:09:51] climbing on but listen we can we can
[1:09:54] live up there where Eagles praise God we
[1:09:56] can handle a climb in the mountains amen
[1:09:58] because we fly above the mountain amen
[1:10:01] he said keep climbing on if you'll just
[1:10:04] be honest with what you've got God will
[1:10:07] keep pouring on gifts unto you how many
[1:10:11] want God to pour on more of the gifts on
[1:10:13] your life more understanding of your
[1:10:17] gifts but he's got to be honest with
[1:10:19] what you got that's why I want to review
[1:10:21] that in the next few weeks I want to
[1:10:23] have some time I'm just I'm just kind of
[1:10:25] stating I don't know how it's gonna be
[1:10:26] I've lost the file lady leadership of
[1:10:28] the Holy Spirit I've never done that
[1:10:29] before but we got to take some time and
[1:10:31] really examine and maybe take a couple
[1:10:33] weeks and just think about that let's
[1:10:35] list all the examples of supernatural
[1:10:37] we've seen it through our lives and then
[1:10:39] through other people's lives and then we
[1:10:41] can go and when if we know someone has a
[1:10:43] certain gift of wisdom we should pray
[1:10:45] and fast and see if God would have us to
[1:10:47] approach that person for wisdom life or
[1:10:50] a word of wisdom or we know somebody has
[1:10:52] the gift of healing let's pray and fast
[1:10:54] if we're sick and say can you join me in
[1:10:56] prayer I mean
[1:10:57] that with me many times he said can you
[1:10:58] pray for me and God will answer our
[1:11:00] prayer you know cuz we'll join our faith
[1:11:01] together right we put our faith together
[1:11:04] there's no man that can heal only Christ
[1:11:06] can heal but God likes for us to
[1:11:08] exercise our faith amen
[1:11:10] he likes to move through the gifts that
[1:11:11] he's given to us see we got to be honest
[1:11:15] with what we got
[1:11:16] keep climbing and God will pour out more
[1:11:18] gifts upon us now that scripture so
[1:11:21] let's go I want to show that in the
[1:11:22] scripture oh yeah yeah right there in
[1:11:27] Luke 19 yeah Luke 19 yeah verse 24
[1:11:31] that's scriptural brother am is exactly
[1:11:33] scriptural he said God won't take the
[1:11:35] gifts from you see but what he'll do is
[1:11:39] he'll give the opportunities or
[1:11:41] ministries to other people okay so let's
[1:11:47] see that verse 24 and he said to them
[1:11:51] that stood by take from him the pound
[1:11:53] and give it to him that hath ten pounds
[1:11:54] see that God is taking the opportunities
[1:11:59] and gifts I'm sorry the opportunities
[1:12:01] I'll say and ministries of the one pound
[1:12:04] or the third worker with the one pound
[1:12:06] and he's giving it to the guy who had 10
[1:12:08] pounds and that's exactly what the Bible
[1:12:12] says seek because the Bible says in acts
[1:12:16] 1 because Judas left his position what a
[1:12:19] God had to do next man up right who's
[1:12:23] gonna fill his spot God has a special
[1:12:25] spot there amen
[1:12:27] God's got a room for you and I church
[1:12:29] God's got a ministry for you and I
[1:12:31] appreciate brothers amen and fill in the
[1:12:32] room of song leader I'm feeling the room
[1:12:35] of pastor banks feeling the room of
[1:12:38] Trustee you know there's there's all
[1:12:41] these rooms sing song specials there's a
[1:12:43] room for song special there's all the
[1:12:45] rule all these rooms we got to fill the
[1:12:47] room that God has for us now I told you
[1:12:53] this earlier I'll read it out of history
[1:12:54] Mathias laboured greatly for Christ
[1:12:57] preaching in Judea before his missionary
[1:13:00] work of converting souls to Jesus in
[1:13:02] Cappadocia so he actually left out of
[1:13:05] Judea and went to Cappadocia
[1:13:07] he says Matthias died as a martyr
[1:13:11] by crucifixion in the region round about
[1:13:13] the Caspian Sea he died a martyr and the
[1:13:19] Bible said he gets a martyr's crown for
[1:13:20] that see that was Judas his spot Judas
[1:13:24] who should have died a martyr if he
[1:13:26] would have been faithful but he died by
[1:13:28] suicide right instead of dying as a
[1:13:31] martyr in honor and victory glory amen
[1:13:35] dying like his Lord Jesus praise God
[1:13:38] Matthias did that he died like his
[1:13:41] Savior but Judas sold it out and died in
[1:13:43] dishonor someone took his pal Matthias
[1:13:48] took his pout his opportunity to the
[1:13:50] highest calling in the Bible that's the
[1:13:53] what the Bible says revelation 3:11 says
[1:13:55] behold I come quickly hold that fast
[1:13:58] which thou has that no man take that
[1:14:00] crown
[1:14:02] praise the Lord let's say I got back sin
[1:14:05] and I gave up the pastor ship here and
[1:14:06] it was not ordained of God somebody
[1:14:09] could come in here and take my crown
[1:14:11] praise the Lord
[1:14:12] you understand if God has the ministry
[1:14:15] that our brother prayed for god save and
[1:14:18] his family and all the saints you know
[1:14:20] that got saved under this ministry and
[1:14:21] now that herb let being blessed God had
[1:14:24] a room here God had a ministry and if
[1:14:27] I'm not faithful with it God could take
[1:14:29] me out he could bring somebody in and
[1:14:30] somebody could take my crown see that
[1:14:35] see Matthias seems have taken Judas's
[1:14:40] crown that Judas forfeit or we might say
[1:14:43] Paul took his place there's there's some
[1:14:45] different thoughts on that
[1:14:46] remember 2nd John 1:8 says look to
[1:14:48] yourselves that we lose not those things
[1:14:51] which we have wrought but that we
[1:14:53] receive a full reward amen praise God
[1:14:56] let's close with this thought here about
[1:14:58] multiplying see bro Graham says God's
[1:15:03] not gonna give away your gift to
[1:15:05] somebody else he said but that ministry
[1:15:09] will be taken and given to somebody else
[1:15:12] ok like I've seen yesterday I was I was
[1:15:16] curious this one brought this one
[1:15:18] preacher left a message well I'll just
[1:15:19] say it Chris Hall you I don't know if
[1:15:20] you know Chris aw he preached a sermon
[1:15:22] seen message the first one I heard that
[1:15:24] brought me into the message as beautiful
[1:15:28] as the most glorious sermon I've ever
[1:15:30] heard on serpent seed well yesterday I
[1:15:33] was kind of thinking about what's
[1:15:35] happened to him well he went and he
[1:15:37] started a church in Tallahassee and it's
[1:15:39] like a kind like a mega church like Joel
[1:15:41] Osteen well they didn't make it they
[1:15:43] folded but I was just thinking about
[1:15:45] that like God gave him a great ministry
[1:15:48] in the message he was traveling all
[1:15:49] around the world preaching the gospel
[1:15:51] but because something happened I don't
[1:15:53] know exactly the details
[1:15:54] somebody offended him or something and
[1:15:56] then there was adultery and there were
[1:15:57] some sexual sins going on there he
[1:15:59] forsook that ministry and then God has
[1:16:02] raised enough other preachers to take
[1:16:04] that place because if if a person won't
[1:16:08] be faithful with the ministry God has
[1:16:10] God will bring in somebody else it's
[1:16:13] exactly right God will take one person
[1:16:17] and fill in with somebody else
[1:16:19] praise God just like with Saul Saul is
[1:16:21] the clearest example God said you were
[1:16:23] gonna serve forever if you were just
[1:16:25] faithful you would have this throne
[1:16:26] forever but God said because you're not
[1:16:28] I'm getting rid of you the Bible said
[1:16:31] God took his mercy away from Saul
[1:16:33] God will take his mercy away and God
[1:16:36] will find a man after his own heart to
[1:16:38] put in that place amen
[1:16:39] a David alleluia man that loves the Lord
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:44] well holiday all right get your Bibles
[1:16:46] ready let's finish with this here are
[1:16:48] you joining us tonight
[1:16:49] hope it's a blessing see there's talents
[1:16:52] where everybody has different but then
[1:16:54] there's pounds where everybody's the
[1:16:55] same there are certain things where it's
[1:16:58] the same everybody can achieve as much
[1:17:00] as you invest you'll get a reward it's
[1:17:03] equal it's equal and that's why there's
[1:17:06] differences in these parables
[1:17:08] that's what's why Jesus said one to the
[1:17:10] multitude and one to the preachers you
[1:17:12] know he he's trying to get everybody to
[1:17:13] see that they have something valuable
[1:17:15] God gave them alright so here it is
[1:17:22] let's start with the statute over man
[1:17:25] 2nd Peter 1:8 let's go there now I'm
[1:17:28] going to turn there with you 2nd Peter
[1:17:30] 1:8
[1:17:31] I appreciate your patience you've been
[1:17:32] doing wonderful audience I mean that
[1:17:34] you've been really Poland looking at me
[1:17:36] and I appreciate that pulling on the
[1:17:37] word of God
[1:17:38] bless you second Peter 1 verse 8 we're
[1:17:43] trying to go places Church we're trying
[1:17:44] to go place with our church that we
[1:17:45] never been before right
[1:17:47] we're trying to go to spot where we see
[1:17:50] God moving more in our mitts like
[1:17:51] brother Steve was telling me the church
[1:17:53] he was used to be at before he came here
[1:17:55] they had gifts operating like
[1:17:57] discernment and tongues interpretations
[1:17:59] and healings and miracles where people
[1:18:02] would like something let's say he said
[1:18:03] somebody be about the altar and someone
[1:18:05] would just get the Holy Spirit on him
[1:18:07] come up and pray out loud over that
[1:18:09] person and discern what they were
[1:18:10] praying about and they get the victory
[1:18:12] is that right bro Steve that's what he
[1:18:13] told me earlier and that beautiful
[1:18:15] I'll see what you really got to be under
[1:18:18] the anointing of God do that right you
[1:18:21] really got to give giving all to Jesus
[1:18:24] praise the Lord but see not all the
[1:18:28] gifts you know well brother I've said
[1:18:29] all the gifts should be in every church
[1:18:31] but not we don't know when they'll be
[1:18:32] there like we don't know what time we
[1:18:34] don't know what season also we know is
[1:18:36] that God is restoring all that Pentecost
[1:18:38] had God will restore to the bride and if
[1:18:41] we're a part of that bride we want to
[1:18:42] see it restored in our church but see we
[1:18:45] are with these sermons I'm trying I'm
[1:18:47] praying that God will take us to a place
[1:18:48] where we've never been before a more
[1:18:51] dedicated life in Christ more discipline
[1:18:54] life and more stewardship over the gifts
[1:18:57] he's given to us praise God
[1:19:03] okay second Peter 1:8 oh you're good
[1:19:06] Lydia Lord bless you now remember he
[1:19:09] just listed that nine building blocks
[1:19:12] and then charity is the capping off
[1:19:14] right so there's eight total for if
[1:19:16] these things be in you and multiply that
[1:19:19] word means multiply remember the
[1:19:21] tailless they multiply they went from
[1:19:22] one to ten one to five remember the
[1:19:25] talents they multiplied by two five to
[1:19:28] ten two to four so the Bible says if you
[1:19:32] keep all these attributes in you these
[1:19:34] character qualities and they abound and
[1:19:37] multiply they'll make you that you're
[1:19:39] neither barren nor unfruitful and the
[1:19:42] knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ so I
[1:19:46] don't want to skip over that because
[1:19:47] that's the word for multiply if we want
[1:19:50] to multiply we just gotta
[1:19:52] remain attached to Christ we just got to
[1:19:55] make sure we always have faith and
[1:19:56] virtue and knowledge and and temperance
[1:19:58] and brotherly kindness and godliness and
[1:20:00] all these things we got to make sure all
[1:20:02] these are flowing and the Bible said
[1:20:04] through that God will multiply the
[1:20:05] fruits of the Spirit in our lives
[1:20:07] praise God hallelujah so let's go to
[1:20:11] that one John 15:1 here's where Jesus
[1:20:14] said you just gotta let these things
[1:20:15] abide in you see the character of Christ
[1:20:18] abides in us when we abide in him now
[1:20:33] let me just say there's two this doesn't
[1:20:34] mean you know you never listen to the
[1:20:35] news or anything like that
[1:20:37] brother Graham listen to the news you
[1:20:38] know he said he would catch it when he
[1:20:40] was driving around or reading the
[1:20:41] newspaper but the thing to do is while
[1:20:43] you're looking at the news don't get
[1:20:45] distracted into evil thoughts right try
[1:20:50] not to hate the politician you know try
[1:20:52] not to think evil or hate all the
[1:20:55] Democrats or hate all the Republicans no
[1:20:57] we want to hate sin but see as you do
[1:21:00] that you have as you look at those
[1:21:02] things you have to abide in the word
[1:21:04] still and for me I found it good I just
[1:21:07] pray for them I pray for them and God
[1:21:11] answered two of those prayers Ohio
[1:21:13] defunded Planned Parenthood I know if
[1:21:15] you saw that Ohio cut off 7 and 1/2
[1:21:17] million to Planned Parenthood how the
[1:21:19] new yeah and I just pray for that last
[1:21:21] week and then Planned Parenthood just
[1:21:23] turned down 65 million dollars they're
[1:21:25] no longer no longer getting federal
[1:21:27] funding anymore all in the same week
[1:21:31] glory and I was all my face cried out to
[1:21:34] God changed some things so God just
[1:21:35] knows what I don't I just believe God
[1:21:37] had you know God had us pray for that we
[1:21:40] pray for that before you know I remember
[1:21:41] months ago we were praying for that but
[1:21:43] just continue to pray continue to
[1:21:45] believe God can move mountains amen
[1:21:49] 2nd Peter I'm sorry yeah John 15:1
[1:21:56] of course this is right before Jesus got
[1:21:58] to the Garden of Gethsemane Judas had
[1:22:00] already left out betray Christ and now
[1:22:03] he's just talking with them and he says
[1:22:05] I am The True Vine and my father is the
[1:22:07] husbandman every branch in me that
[1:22:08] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and
[1:22:10] every branch that bears fruit he purges

[1:22:28] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:22:30] bringeth forth much fruit for without me

[1:22:33] 7 if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:22:36] forth cast forth as a branch and is
[1:22:38] withered and men gather them and cast
[1:22:40] them in the fire and they are burned if
[1:22:42] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:22:44] you you shall ask what you will and it
[1:22:46] shall be done unto you I'm gonna read
[1:22:48] eight hearing as the father glorified
[1:22:49] that you bear much fruit so shall you be
[1:22:53] my disciples can the church say Amen

[1:24:59] which ye have so the Macedonians had
[1:25:03] helped out the Corinthians now Paul
[1:25:04] saying listen you need to return that
[1:25:06] blessing if they helped you now they're

[1:26:44] church I put so many hours into it I've
[1:26:49] been given my life to it praise God but
[1:26:52] see we're supposed to give ourselves to
[1:26:54] it and it should abound it should go
[1:26:55] greater as long as we got the right love

[1:27:00] more effective for the glory of God
[1:27:01] hallelujah praise God now we all go
[1:27:05] through seasons right I just told you I
[1:27:07] went through about six months where I
[1:27:08] didn't see anybody healed and I was
[1:27:10] starting to doubt I had a gift anymore
[1:27:12] but then God had to bring me out of the
[1:27:14] season I thank the Lord for that so we
[1:27:16] go through seasons we go through
[1:27:17] struggles the thing to do is never give
[1:27:19] up never quit never say you're a weak
[1:27:21] Christian never say you don't have gifts
[1:27:23] never say God didn't give you anything
[1:27:25] God gave you something he gave you a
[1:27:26] great opportunity he gave you an equal
[1:27:28] opportunity and I believe church if you
[1:27:31] look carefully there's something in your
[1:27:32] hand there's something God wants you to
[1:27:35] do and it's in your hand alright last

[1:27:56] go to 11 that'll just be yeah here's
[1:28:00] what I was saying earlier about God
[1:28:01] wants to establish us God wants us to be
[1:28:04] so rock solid in the message which is
[1:28:06] the Bible God wants us to be so rock
[1:28:08] solid in the Word of God that our hearts
[1:28:10] are firmly established we're not going
[1:28:12] anywhere no matter what waves come or
[1:28:14] winds come like sister Karen you know
[1:28:15] and sister Brenda we just stay right in
[1:28:17] this think of all the years you know
[1:28:19] Beatrice and and William think of all
[1:28:21] the years just staying right in here

[1:28:24] all of our hearts need to be like that
[1:28:26] amen that's a great testimony hallelujah
[1:28:30] that's what the love of God does it
[1:28:32] wants you to establish your heart in the
[1:28:35] truth of God hallelujah it's almost
[1:28:39] twenty years for me Church it's almost
[1:28:40] twenty years I've been this message
[1:28:41] almost I know the power the keeping
[1:28:44] power of Jesus Christ I've come to know
[1:28:47] him in the powers resurrection and the
[1:28:49] Fellowship of his sufferings praise God
[1:28:52] verse 11 now God himself I love that God
[1:28:56] himself

[1:29:02] one to minister these people may God
[1:29:05] direct our way to you and the Lord make
[1:29:09] you to increase amen
[1:29:11] and a bow that means multiply in love
[1:29:14] one toward another and toward all men
[1:29:18] even as we do toward you we should be
[1:29:23] the most loving people on the earth
[1:29:24] praise God now we got to use wisdom too
[1:29:26] you know with people that would hurt us
[1:29:28] you know you have to use wisdom like
[1:29:29] member paul paul said with the
[1:29:31] coppersmith he said beware
[1:29:32] he told timothy you watch out for
[1:29:34] Alexander the coppersmith he did me much
[1:29:35] evil remember that so we got to use
[1:29:37] wisdom right if someone's gonna smack us
[1:29:39] or beat us up we shouldn't let him do it
[1:29:40] all the time you know if somebody runs

[1:29:49] out to the
[1:29:54] verse 13 here's the end that he may
[1:29:56] establish your hearts unblameable in
[1:29:58] holiness before God even our father at
[1:30:01] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with
[1:30:04] all his saints and then he breaks into
