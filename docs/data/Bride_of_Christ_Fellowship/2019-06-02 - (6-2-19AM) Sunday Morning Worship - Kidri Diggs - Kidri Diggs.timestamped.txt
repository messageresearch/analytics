[30:11] God's own son will be okay so we'll get
[30:17] there because God is leaving amen
[30:21] you know it's nothing that we are doing
[30:23] on our own it's all the grace of God you

[30:29] this way seeing all of you and pastor
[30:34] Smith we certainly appreciate him you
[30:37] know um you know they always talk about
[30:40] um big things but some of the most
[30:42] powerful meetings could be small
[30:44] gatherings because God he can do
[30:47] personal things you know so I chair it I
[30:51] cherish these moments you know and by
[30:54] God's grace we traveled all over the
[30:55] world but he's still the same God you
[31:00] know so we take and praise Him and we
[31:02] just covered your prayers and let's just
[31:05] have a word of Prayer and we'll get into
[31:07] the Word of God today that's pray Lord
[31:10] Jesus father here we are today and we
[31:12] know that we're here on the merits of
[31:14] your grace Lord there's nothing that we
[31:17] have done and Lord though we don't
[31:19] deserve your grace father you
[31:20] predestinated it unto us before the
[31:23] foundation of the world Lord you give
[31:25] your life for creation that was falling
[31:28] in sin the Lord you you came as
[31:31] Redeemer and you redeemed us Lord and
[31:33] you placed us on the solid foundation of
[31:37] who you are Lord and you are mercy you
[31:39] are grace you are peace you are love nor
[31:43] then we are now possessing all of those
[31:47] benefits that you've given us Lord Lord
[31:50] and we pray that you just bless this
[31:52] church today Lord and it's an every
[31:54] person that I hear at the sound of our
[31:56] voice or God that you would just move in
[31:59] the lives of your people Lord and
[32:01] encourage us Lord and whatever way we
[32:03] need and Lord will be careful to give
[32:05] you all the honor and glory and praise
[32:07] Lord we pray that you the supernatural
[32:11] God will become in this place today in
[32:14] Jesus Christ's name let the church say
[32:16] Amen hey man if you have your Bibles
[32:19] let's turn to the Book of Numbers the
[32:21] 14th chapter numbers 14 amen praise God
[32:37] numbers 14 and let's start reading at
[32:41] verse 26 if you have a saved man the
[32:49] Bible says and the Lord spoke unto Moses
[32:51] and unto Aaron saying how long shall I
[32:54] bear with this evil congregation which
[32:57] number against me I have heard the
[33:01] murmuring of the children of Israel
[33:04] which they mumble against me say unto
[33:08] them as truly as I live saith the LORD
[33:13] as you have spoken in my ears so will I
[33:17] do to you ma let's go to Psalms 19 look
[33:24] of Psalms chapter 19
[33:31] a man let's um let's start reading at
[33:49] verse this is reverse um 14 Psalms 19
[33:59] and 14 the Bible says let the words of
[34:02] my mouth and the meditation of my heart
[34:04] be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my
[34:09] strength and my Redeemer amen the Lord
[34:13] bless the reading of his word you can
[34:15] have your seats before I give you my
[34:20] title one thing I want to make clear
[34:22] today is that when it comes to God
[34:26] nothing is done by coincidence there is
[34:31] no such a thing as coincidence when it
[34:34] comes to God because God is all-knowing
[34:37] he's all see you know he's all-powerful
[34:41] so with God just he just doesn't happen
[34:46] to stumble upon something you know he
[34:49] doesn't work like that you know he has a
[34:52] purpose and everything he does and he
[34:55] knows you know the outcome the beginning
[34:58] and the end of everything about us so I
[35:02] want to say today that if you're here in
[35:05] the sound of my voice is not a
[35:07] coincidence
[35:08] that God preordained this meeting
[35:12] amongst us in this building before there
[35:15] was ever a world created now we have to
[35:19] believe God like that that he's a he's
[35:23] not just a a a a a a God that we can put
[35:27] in our finite mind but he's infinite you
[35:32] know he's all-powerful and his ways are
[35:35] to be understood or figured out by us
[35:39] through His grace and we'll never
[35:42] understand God without his help
[35:44] so what I'm saying today before I go
[35:47] forward is that I want you to get
[35:49] something out of the service you know
[35:51] don't just say well you may have had a
[35:53] thought well I feel like going to church
[35:55] today let me tell you something dad
[35:57] didn't come from the devil the devil
[36:00] didn't say oh why don't you go to church
[36:02] and hear the word of God this is not a
[36:06] question it's God who put that salt and
[36:11] that push in your life to put you in
[36:13] this place today this is not a
[36:16] coincidence
[36:17] Amen I'm not here by coincidence you're
[36:22] not here by coincidence but there's a
[36:24] purpose so I want you to say today as
[36:27] you're hearing the Word of God I want
[36:29] you to say Lord I want my portion I want
[36:32] that part of the word has been ordained
[36:35] from my life to take your man you know
[36:39] church today might my subject is the
[36:42] visitation of the spoken word amen now
[36:48] as we look in the Bible and as I read in
[36:53] the Book of Numbers you know God he
[36:56] began to deal with the children of
[36:58] Israel now for him to get to this place
[37:01] you know God has told Abraham he said
[37:04] that I'm a bless your seed I'm a blessed
[37:07] you know he's gonna be above the stars
[37:09] and his hands and so forth and I'm gonna
[37:12] put you in the promised land that was
[37:14] God's promise he spoke that unto Abraham
[37:17] now if God ever speak something he has
[37:20] to back it up he has to fulfill it God
[37:24] is not an Indian giver
[37:25] he can't say something one day and they
[37:27] say oh I didn't mean to say that
[37:29] i'ma change my mind and he could do that
[37:32] he couldn't be God he had to be like one
[37:36] of us you don't have to be a maturing of
[37:40] the mind God that God doesn't have to
[37:43] mature him at hand hariya he's perfect
[37:46] in all his ways
[37:48] dot doesn't have to grow hallelujah
[37:52] she's perfect in all his ways so you
[37:55] know Church when I when I when I look at
[37:57] this you know the children of Israel God
[37:59] made a promise to Abraham and he even
[38:03] told him that your sea was gonna come
[38:06] into some bondage but he he gave them a
[38:09] specific time that you'll deliver why
[38:14] because he spoke that word so that word
[38:17] had to come to pass hey man so God
[38:20] allowed the children of Israel to be in
[38:23] bondage and God did not come to respond
[38:27] to the people and today x4
[38:32] let me tell you something if you want a
[38:35] visitation from God
[38:37] you got to speaking see God will only
[38:41] visit you by the power of the spoken
[38:44] word you know but I also want to talk
[38:47] about meditation the scripture reread
[38:49] that the words of my mouth the
[38:52] meditation in my heart be accepted in
[38:55] thy sight because what's in your heart
[38:58] can become action the Bible says out of
[39:02] the abundance of the heart does the
[39:04] mouth speak so what you're meditating on
[39:07] and what is speaking work hand in hand
[39:09] so I want to look at this you know
[39:12] choose of Israel you had a Bible says
[39:14] you didn't God came and he heard that
[39:17] cry hey man the children of Israel in
[39:20] bondage and God heard they cry and Gaza
[39:23] okay I have come down early he come down
[39:27] to deliver the people God says I'm
[39:30] coming to visit you but I'm going to
[39:33] visit you hungry yeah he Moses
[39:36] hallelujah amen
[39:37] God came down but he was veiled in Moses
[39:41] so a lot of Taiwan to say something to
[39:42] you now
[39:43] not lift me up but God could be visiting
[39:46] you this morning but using a different
[39:48] vessel Korea so church we can't get
[39:52] caught up in flesh we can't get caught
[39:54] in one another God does things holy that
[39:57] mind can't comprehend then a people
[40:00] actual visitation but
[40:01] I took a man of this very old what are
[40:05] they very own kind and God was gonna
[40:07] bring for the visitation them by the
[40:10] spoken word
[40:11] now they cried and he cried and he cried
[40:13] for the river and God came down through
[40:17] Moses to deliver and we know the story
[40:20] to make the story short God did my signs
[40:23] and wonders you know he he turned water
[40:27] into blood he he that fire come from
[40:31] heaven you know he do the spoken word of
[40:34] Moses mouth you know
[40:35] Psalms were created lifes were created
[40:38] you know Allah's creation came for what
[40:40] was it it was a visitation honey God was
[40:45] giving the people a visitation based
[40:47] upon what they act for they act for
[40:51] deliverance
[40:52] so Moses Oh hallelujah Moses didn't come
[40:56] down with healing ministry hallelujah
[40:59] why did he come for healing ministry
[41:02] because the visitation was based upon
[41:05] what the acts for the visitation was
[41:07] acts for God bring us delivers so Moses
[41:11] had to come through with a visitation of
[41:13] deliverance they expect deliverance so
[41:16] how are you and God visited he visited
[41:19] with a Ministry of deliverance not a
[41:22] Ministry of healing so Moses came down
[41:25] delivering the people with signs and
[41:27] wonders
[41:28] why did he say okay who have a prayer
[41:30] line all of that was included that God
[41:40] do his part you act and God will God
[41:44] will visit you according to what you
[41:47] explore the very words that comes out of
[41:50] your mouth but it has to be spoken word
[41:53] now when I say spoken word the word that
[41:56] God would have spoken himself God's not
[42:01] going to visit hurry up um carnality or
[42:04] or or or like like lady told Paul um
[42:08] they said not Barmes beliefs a you've
[42:11] gotten caught up in folly see fool
[42:15] God's not gonna visit who's hola
[42:18] send me a million dollars are you
[42:22] talking about that counselor we're
[42:25] talking about the word that God has
[42:27] already ordained for your life
[42:29] that's what God will visit hi oh yeah
[42:33] and you know Church if you look at how
[42:36] God came through he didn't come through
[42:38] like a John the Baptist at that time you
[42:41] know preach and repent
[42:42] no this visitation was based upon what
[42:45] they spoke and this visitation was
[42:47] deliverance
[42:48] so Moses didn't come down baptizing
[42:51] people no he came down with signs and
[42:53] wonders of deliverance that was the
[42:56] visitation courier that was the
[43:01] visitation what the people ask for in
[43:03] their day
[43:04] now we're going somewhere church we're
[43:06] coming up to something so you can see
[43:08] Moses came down with all this all this
[43:10] power he won't write up the Pharaoh say
[43:13] let my people go didn't have an army you
[43:16] have no weapons all he had was a stick
[43:18] what was this the only be needed for
[43:23] deliverance
[43:27] so God a crook the ministry with all it
[43:31] needed to give the people when they need
[43:33] for their visitation so God Moses comes
[43:37] down and and you know he wants to fail
[43:38] we know that Sarah had armies serento
[43:42] Kingdom
[43:43] but Moses was protected hallelujah he's
[43:46] protected why was he protected because
[43:48] God sent Moses God was in Mose honey
[43:52] this wasn't Malta doing it was it was
[43:55] God's doing God came down to visit the
[43:58] people according to what they say and
[44:08] the Bible says the people cried and
[44:11] cried for deliverance and God said he
[44:14] remembers his promise
[44:16] hallelujah well he said unto Abraham
[44:18] honey
[44:19] so God came down hariya to fulfill
[44:22] whether people needed but in the midst
[44:25] of all that deliverance
[44:28] they discarded that like I say it all
[44:31] the wonders and all these things but
[44:33] then the people begin to complain the
[44:37] worst thing you can do is let the wrong
[44:40] thing come out of your mouth words are
[44:44] that allows a parent you don't tell your
[44:47] children that they sorry there never be
[44:50] anything you just like your dad you just
[44:54] like your mama all this negative stuff
[44:56] no because words have power and those
[44:58] words will visit their spirit oh yeah
[45:03] so you have to build them up you have to
[45:05] tell them that you can be great early
[45:08] you know I I see my I give my daughter
[45:12] messages before you go to sue I say hey
[45:14] do great things today
[45:16] because you are great so somebody can
[45:19] come now you never be nice she say yes I
[45:22] will my daddy tell me all the time I'm
[45:24] great so those words how you
[45:28] continuously visit her in the time of
[45:31] need oh yeah
[45:34] so that's why you have to speak hurry up
[45:37] positive things all your life honey
[45:39] don't never wake up in the morning and
[45:42] say oh I'm just stupid I don't know what
[45:44] I do those words will create atmospheres
[45:48] around your life you know that's one
[45:50] thing I hate you know when somebody
[45:52] needs deliverance or say somebody who's
[45:54] who's who who's caught in some kind of
[45:56] diction maybe alcohol or drugs and you
[45:59] go to these anonymous centers in the
[46:01] first thing and what you do is come fast
[46:03] something that you're not the only way
[46:12] you can be an alcoholic
[46:14] if you confession simply that gives the
[46:21] devil power over you because the worse
[46:24] you're gonna be visited by spirits based
[46:27] upon the access that you've given them
[46:29] hurry
[46:30] cuz the devil can't do nothing to you
[46:33] but what God allows hurry up if you say
[46:37] Oh
[46:40] on the holiday the spirit of a closed
[46:42] alcoholism has a right path to you
[46:46] because you have invited in that's why
[46:49] the Bible says then the weak say I am
[46:51] strong it never says the Bible never
[46:56] says head too weak and weak it never she
[47:03] chokes
[47:04] we got the caster's like dissertation
[47:06] otherwise we speak the Bible never said
[47:09] that the lost Sam lo he says let the
[47:17] word of God oh you visit you why won't
[47:21] you speak Amen it never says let the
[47:24] bowels ambough he says that the bounce
[47:33] what are you speaking out of your mouth
[47:36] because the words that you speak out of
[47:39] your mouth will visit you host you know
[47:41] I feel the Holy Spirit moving in here
[47:44] but you know church as we look at these
[47:46] different things you know I just want to
[47:49] progress on up to where I want to get
[47:51] you know as God brought forth the
[47:55] Ministry of deliverance what they spoke
[47:57] there in this visitation holy God is
[48:01] visiting his people and he's in Moses
[48:05] directing him so much to God gave him a
[48:08] privilege cloud by day and a pillar of
[48:11] fire by night honey
[48:13] Moses lightning that cloud Moses went in
[48:17] that fire that visitation was all gone
[48:26] such as God was syndicating to his
[48:30] people that he was with them but because
[48:33] of their salts in their then that the
[48:36] meditation of the heart being trapped in
[48:39] Egypt so long they couldn't recognize
[48:42] the visitation they look
[48:46] Moses may begin to criticize they begin
[48:49] to say oh you ain't gonna hold it hold
[48:50] Moses we hungry Church let me say this
[48:56] in my time right now if God was to come
[49:01] do some supernatural things in my life
[49:04] the last thing I'd be taking be thinking
[49:07] about is what this flesh for a stay on
[49:14] my mind
[49:14] see coca-cola Pepsi create I think if
[49:20] God was to come and give me a
[49:22] supernatural visitation that I could not
[49:25] explain my god how do you supernaturally
[49:29] brought forth deliveries and they're
[49:31] there they're moving towards the
[49:34] delivers in the visitation of God by
[49:37] what they spoke hurry
[49:38] they spoke deliverance God gave them
[49:40] deliverance then they start speaking
[49:43] damnation in damnation began to be
[49:49] created so now they begin to say we're
[49:53] hungry Moses because there were no
[49:57] graves out here you know you brought us
[50:00] out here to die
[50:00] we had melons and cucumbers and all
[50:04] these things in Egypt so now there's
[50:08] going to be visited by famine there
[50:13] being visited by famine because of what
[50:16] they spoke they're going to be visited
[50:18] my first because of what they spoke
[50:20] researched it we just we that but one
[50:23] thing I want you to say I want you to
[50:25] understand you will never bring God to a
[50:28] common level in God's face is God ever
[50:33] started delivering holy place upon the
[50:37] spoken word he'll stay there to finish
[50:40] it well sometimes your journey can be
[50:47] prolonged by what's coming out of your
[50:49] mouth a lot we only we got a nanny so
[50:53] God
[50:55] you gotta stop the whole church just to
[50:57] feed some title people hurry when they
[51:00] will see a journey a journey me to tell
[51:08] me they couldn't pay in the visitation
[51:15] of God and they flesh is getting in the
[51:17] way now they come are they hungry so
[51:19] Gaga stopped whole church and feed
[51:22] people though he fed him the visitation
[51:26] was still supernatural hey once God
[51:31] start to visit you from that point so he
[51:35] finished everything will be a man look
[51:44] at a church he got hungry God ain't told
[51:46] you just a windy garden tell him go to
[51:49] the field and big grain no his
[51:52] visitation was supernatural how do you
[51:54] so you know what he did they got hungry
[51:56] because the visitation had already
[51:58] started gosh I gotta feed my people I'm
[52:02] already here so I gotta continue to be
[52:04] God holy he said they were hungry so you
[52:07] know what imma give them manna from
[52:09] heaven Church even though we complain

[52:22] but I just want you know sometimes a
[52:25] journey will be held up by what's coming
[52:27] out of your mouth or by the meditation
[52:30] in your heart see what was holding him
[52:32] up even in that moment it wasn't where
[52:34] they were speaking it was where they
[52:36] were thinking claim launching they're
[52:41] going down they're thinking in the heart
[52:43] me with that plenty of food in Egypt we
[52:47] had plenty listen Egypt heroes for the
[52:49] words in a in a in a heart the
[52:51] meditation in a heart beginning a short
[52:54] journey and yeah I said God came down
[52:58] and gave them bread for Hannah from from
[53:01] Gaeta manna from heaven how are you let
[53:03] me tell you something this matter was
[53:05] already cooked

[53:46] realize if he visit you once he can do
[53:49] it again we gotta give awesome testimony
[53:55] from 10 years ago he's still God today
[54:03] he hears you then healed you now
[54:07] Church I'm here as a witness a man 10
[54:10] years ago they tried they try to tell me
[54:13] how diabetes and I said no no no I what
[54:19] you see is sweet tea from Wendy's he
[54:28] said police how can you speak like that
[54:29] because that spoken word had already
[54:32] visited me it visited me hallelujah some
[54:35] years prior when I told the enemy by
[54:38] stripes I'm here
[54:41] let visitation that visitation of
[54:44] healing it doesn't leave you it follows
[54:47] you wherever you go you just have to
[54:49] speak it by the spoken word you bring it
[54:52] back by what you speak oh yeah he bring
[54:56] the manifestation to your life by what
[54:58] comes out of your mouth you say you you
[55:01] and hearing closed that healing will
[55:04] follow you to read
[55:12] great so you know Church they say yeah I
[55:16] better not don't I say sweetie I said no
[55:21] no mr. Diggs I'm sorry sweetie don't
[55:24] move I see you say what you want to say
[55:26] sweetie and I want you to understand
[55:30] something I had all the symptoms of
[55:33] having it having diabetes but the words
[55:37] that came out of my mouth the meditation
[55:41] that was in my heart it was acceptable
[55:44] in his sight so God said as surely as
[55:53] now spoken so shall be you know what I
[56:02] walked out of it without diabetes after
[56:05] they did a test after they did a
[56:07] screening why did he come back negative
[56:16] because I spoke visitation like myself
[56:20] my stripes on he he still the same God
[56:28] so once that word
[56:31] oh my church listen the Bible says
[56:34] Isaiah things Isaiah 55 the Bible says
[56:39] yes how's everything from the Bible says
[56:42] and then the word marici identify verse
[56:46] 11 says so shall my word be that goes
[56:49] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[56:52] return unto me wrong Haley listen to
[56:55] that church if you speak the spoken word
[56:58] that word cannot return to God why he
[57:02] says but oh yeah it shall accomplish
[57:05] that which I please and it shall prosper
[57:08] in the scene wherein I sent it so I say
[57:13] God is a healer that word can't come
[57:15] back unless it does what it's supposed
[57:18] to do
[57:21] you say God is a savior that word take
[57:25] him back
[57:25] it's a God fulfilled in your life and
[57:28] he's the same you change the provider
[57:31] that one can't come back to God provides
[57:36] it has to accomplish what it lets hey
[57:43] why because it's God's Word he can't
[57:47] just change it once it goes out of your
[57:49] mouth once you say Lord you are you are
[57:53] a provider he's going out the word is
[57:57] going out well maybe your situation it
[57:59] looks real tough their word them go out
[58:02] and say oh that's too tough for me I'm
[58:04] going back no the Word of God doesn't do
[58:08] that the Word of God goes right to the
[58:11] very area you need you have needle and
[58:15] it goes there and that word wrasses on
[58:18] that situation then it breaks that
[58:21] situation up and it starts to do
[58:23] whatever you spoke calling you know I
[58:40] want y'all to pray for me I'm feeling

[1:03:23] in the office and the people say you got
[1:03:27] diabetes I'm like do y'all really want
[1:03:33] to fight this fight again she says no
[1:03:36] matter what they say if God ever visits
[1:03:39] you
[1:03:40] no circumstances no situations can ever
[1:03:43] take that away
[1:03:46] nobody can never take away your
[1:03:50] experience so God ever visit you God
[1:03:54] ever got something in your life no
[1:03:57] situation no trial no tribulation can
[1:04:00] ever take that away so I knew he was
[1:04:03] gonna visit me I've been healed from
[1:04:05] cancer in my brain and you want me to
[1:04:10] back down over looks mix-up in my in my
[1:04:13] in my in my blood like we say back home
[1:04:18] God please take you down south for a
[1:04:26] quick cavities but you know Church I'm
[1:04:29] walking all over the ladies say you got
[1:04:30] that beat just a nurse hooking me up
[1:04:33] now remember cold you understand I said
[1:04:36] if God ever visits you he don't leave
[1:04:39] you stay with you he want to make sure
[1:04:42] huh that the reason why he visit you is
[1:04:46] accomplished huh you know Church so you
[1:04:50] know I'm sitting in there go ahead and
[1:04:51] visit me before possible healing in my
[1:04:53] life and now I'm sitting there and all
[1:04:57] the ladies say yeah diabetes I looked at
[1:04:59] her I said no I still got the same
[1:05:04] revelation let me tell you something if
[1:05:07] you ever get a visitation by the spoken
[1:05:09] word of storm or trial or tribulation
[1:05:13] doesn't change the seed if God gives you
[1:05:22] a revelation of tribulation or storm
[1:05:25] does not change that revelation that
[1:05:28] revelation of home honey you say you say
[1:05:31] ready we had a snowstorm up in in in
[1:05:35] Akron and it got so cold that trees
[1:05:38] broke off you know apples dried up but I
[1:05:40] guarantee you I guarantee you is that
[1:05:44] apple tree
[1:05:45] oh yeah wasn't uprooted honey and the
[1:05:49] storm passes on in the spring and
[1:05:51] summertime comes around like I always do
[1:05:53] that tree or produce apples like it
[1:05:56] always does
[1:05:58] so the storm doesn't change the life
[1:06:01] inside the child the tribulation doesn't
[1:06:07] change how I feel religious holiday
[1:06:22] so Church don't whine and complain
[1:06:25] because you're going through something
[1:06:27] amen that doesn't change what God put in
[1:06:29] you sometimes it takes death to bring
[1:06:33] out more of what you are let me tell you
[1:06:36] a testimony to power the spoken word you
[1:06:38] know some friends of mine in London you
[1:06:41] know the sister she planted a pantry her
[1:06:43] backyard and you know year after year
[1:06:47] the tree got of size but it was never
[1:06:49] produce past so uh maybe a couple of
[1:06:53] years later she looked at the tree she
[1:06:55] walked out and she she come to my
[1:06:58] somebody listen to me good just just
[1:07:01] lady I'm talking about she believes the
[1:07:04] same thing you believe she serves the
[1:07:07] same God you serve this is the same
[1:07:11] message you do the same Bible you do I
[1:07:14] read me
[1:07:15] so she's no different amen
[1:07:19] so she walks up to the tree tree never
[1:07:23] gave any fruit she was I to the tree she
[1:07:26] says you know what she's talking to the
[1:07:28] tree now huh you saying she had to be
[1:07:31] crazy no a scripture Jesus talked to a
[1:07:33] fig tree Church if you can find in the
[1:07:38] Bible it has to happen that way every
[1:07:41] time I hope somebody black to claim they
[1:07:48] visitation Church she walks up to the
[1:07:52] tree and she said to the tree you know
[1:07:54] what I planted you so-and-so the time
[1:07:57] ago and you know you've never gave me
[1:07:59] any fruit she said if you don't give me
[1:08:01] any fruit i'ma cut you down
[1:08:07] [Applause]
[1:08:12] last time I heard a tree doesn't have
[1:08:16] ears that's a my hair or tree doesn't
[1:08:19] have a mind to understand the voice but
[1:08:22] you know what
[1:08:22] with one screen came back around
[1:08:24] hallelujah the next following year in
[1:08:47] the church begin to testify now these
[1:08:50] are the best paths we ever had
[1:08:52] Wow because those paths will produce all
[1:08:55] of the spoken word and I talked I've
[1:09:07] been back several times since then but I
[1:09:09] talked to a couple weeks ago either I
[1:09:11] say sister I've told that testimony all
[1:09:14] over the world she said oh yeah
[1:09:15] she said well let me tell you say you
[1:09:17] know what something so strange the tree
[1:09:19] started producing so much fruit to the
[1:09:22] branches started breaking what was it
[1:09:29] what was it it was a fulfillment of the
[1:09:32] word broken because the Bible says that
[1:09:35] God can produce my exceedingly
[1:09:38] abundantly above all according to the
[1:09:43] power T whether the tape would do the
[1:09:56] tree have a visitation for go
[1:10:03] and it stopped producing so much earlier
[1:10:06] that oh my
[1:10:07] the Bible says it'll be pressed down
[1:10:09] shaken together what happened it was so
[1:10:16] much beer produce that the branches
[1:10:18] start to break why so new stronger
[1:10:20] branches can come out sometime we took
[1:10:26] these stuff and we broke down
[1:10:28] what is God trying to do he's trying to
[1:10:30] make you stronger
[1:10:32] he try to push out more like in church
[1:10:42] holy that visitation remains earlier
[1:10:47] every time the season comes around it

[1:13:51] god's word being fulfilled
[1:13:53] just like he changed he said he became
[1:13:56] now we can say bestrode insane why did
[1:14:00] he become stronger because he knew it
[1:14:02] was going to happen that's what we got
[1:14:07] to be Church it's time to stop doubting
[1:14:10] God and and look for your visitation
[1:14:13] sometimes we pray we just see their prey
[1:14:15] and we need to say God you say no you
[1:14:20] say by your stripes I'm here
[1:14:22] Lord you saying holy thing my eyes and
[1:14:25] see if you want
[1:14:26] the winds of heaven you say that so she

[1:14:54] it I said no that don't belong to me I I
[1:14:58] don't want no visitation from diabetes
[1:15:03] close it
[1:15:04] what buddies why because it's not
[1:15:06] scriptural
[1:15:07] oh nothing in my life it's not
[1:15:15] scriptural cancer not Scripture not
[1:15:18] Scripture the passion I receive no
[1:15:30] visitation but nothing is not scriptural
[1:15:35] you got a right to cast it down cuz it's
[1:15:40] not Scripture receive either world and
[1:15:44] the world only hallo hey hey seemed like
[1:15:50] the more I shot the clear of my boy ski
[1:15:52] [Applause]
[1:15:54] Wow
[1:15:57] you know Church he says well we're
[1:15:59] wheels we'll see what the doctor say so
[1:16:02] everybody all right open going to long
[1:16:04] the doctor she found you I'm sitting in
[1:16:07] the room I'm waiting for the doctor come
[1:16:09] in doctor comes in she says hey mr.
[1:16:11] Diggs
[1:16:12] how you doing I say I'm doing good and
[1:16:17] this is the thing even when certain
[1:16:20] things have been pronounced in your life
[1:16:22] what's coming out of your mouth huh
[1:16:26] that's what the visitation is all about
[1:16:29] because either you're gonna let demons
[1:16:31] visit you or angels message
[1:16:37] and you know in that moment Harley I
[1:16:38] couldn't easily deduct the doctor came
[1:16:40] in and she said mr. G's how you doing it
[1:16:42] oh she then I got type T and you know
[1:16:48] what type to with a B in my body because
[1:16:52] I gave it a pathway let me break let me
[1:16:55] let me say something to you
[1:16:56] hurry no sickness no spirit can get in
[1:17:00] your body to once you accept it as I
[1:17:03] thought first this is like most of us we
[1:17:10] we're living here today we can be in
[1:17:12] here and say we we cast a free why
[1:17:15] because we don't have a thought that we
[1:17:16] got it amen
[1:17:18] so it can't live in your body so it
[1:17:20] takes a word to pronounce that over you
[1:17:23] for you to accept it in your body hold
[1:17:27] so that's what the Bible says cast down
[1:17:29] imagination that exhaust except a
[1:17:38] brother in the house of God she let your
[1:17:40] meditation be on the things of God get
[1:17:48] up and say I'm blessed today it's gonna
[1:17:52] be a good day in the Lord

[1:18:22] atmosphere around you honey that's what
[1:18:25] we have to do rather walk in an
[1:18:26] atmosphere so now the doctor comes in
[1:18:28] she says hey mr. Dees how you doing I'm
[1:18:30] doing good she said oh that's good today
[1:18:33] is good I say today's excellent lives
[1:18:37] just oh man diabetes but I'm worried
[1:18:40] about that cuz I had an experience with

[1:29:42] also make him a judge by the life you
[1:29:45] live but it seems that come out of your
[1:29:48] mouth
[1:29:48] remember the chosen Israel they kept
[1:29:50] saying oh you brought us out here to die
[1:29:52] oh we had this Tunisia we had that oh
[1:29:55] because with no graves out here you make
[1:29:57] great light and gauzy you know what I'm
[1:29:59] sick of the smoothie stand back he says
[1:30:03] truly and you have spoken in my ears so
[1:30:08] shall it be they asked for graded kept
[1:30:14] saying we're gonna be great we're gonna
[1:30:15] be dead we will be just until honey
[1:30:18] they got a visitation from death early
[1:30:23] and God said Jah will see the promised
[1:30:25] land and to all y'all caucuses out here
[1:30:28] like y'all spoke nation over themselves
[1:30:38] remember you got Jesus on one cross he
[1:30:43] got parabola someone earlier and they
[1:30:46] hanging in and the people say he's the
[1:30:50] UH
[1:30:50] the axis you know Jesus or Barabbas is
[1:30:54] he give us Jesus kill him we don't kill
[1:30:57] him crucify your crews fire you know you
[1:31:00] see people that Koopa give us give us
[1:31:02] Barabbas back Church he said what about
[1:31:06] Jesus they said this is Church look at
[1:31:09] the visitation they don't get they said
[1:31:15] peel the Jews spoke that they spoke that
[1:31:19] they spoke a visitation of death on
[1:31:21] innocent people huh
[1:31:26] then a man comes up hurry up name hit in
[1:31:29] the hurry up and he kills a little 48 48
[1:31:33] million Jews innocent people why they
[1:31:38] spoke they spoken so that was the
[1:31:44] visitation they got honey they receive
[1:31:47] and then listen church they receive look
[1:31:49] at the life they received they received
[1:31:51] a murderer back onto them instead of a
[1:31:54] savior they lacked the same to be
[1:31:57] crucified
[1:31:58] and they received hurry a murderer so
[1:32:00] they couldn't help but get a visitation
[1:32:02] of death just be careful what
[1:32:12] your life yeah and listen he says the
[1:32:16] only thing that can stop the word and
[1:32:18] you speak the wrong way out of your
[1:32:20] mouth he said the only thing that can
[1:32:21] stop it is repentance other than that is
[1:32:27] what you saying what you didn't meet you
[1:32:29] at the judgement the only thing that can
[1:32:32] stop that word hurry is repentance he
[1:32:36] says because God has to catch up with
[1:32:39] that word so he speak earlier in the
[1:32:43] name of Jesus Christ I'm blessed that
[1:32:45] word has to catch up with you to produce
[1:32:49] a blessing because it has to find a
[1:32:53] resting place on my church over and over
[1:32:59] so many illustrations and examples you

[1:33:04] examples this evening you know by the

[1:33:28] real oh my listen lad he was here my
[1:33:36] brother wouldn't die you know he can't
[1:33:40] can you master I can just imagine honey
[1:33:43] you know Jesus he loves praise he can't
[1:33:47] resist praise because he's God was God
[1:33:51] God is an object of worship
[1:33:53] holy he can't help her when he here
[1:33:56] praise God comes near you know we sing a
[1:34:05] song you are mighty God coming near and

[1:35:17] the Father he'll do it and she's like
[1:35:22] she already said you've been here he
[1:35:25] would've died and I should say but now

[1:35:30] do why don't we speak like that when it
[1:35:38] looks so bad her brother was dead harder
