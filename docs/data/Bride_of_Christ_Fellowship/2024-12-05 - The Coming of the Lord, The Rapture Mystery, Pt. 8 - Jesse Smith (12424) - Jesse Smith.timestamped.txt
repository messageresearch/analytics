[18:34] Lord bless our preaching here Lord God
[18:36] to magnify your holy name and we'll give
[18:38] you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name
[18:40] the Saints
[18:41] said amen hallelujah if you want to take
[18:44] your Bibles we'll go to John Chapter 14
[18:46] verse one this is text probably for my
[18:49] last part I think it's part eight I
[18:50] might have wrote part seven here in the
[18:53] uh YouTube description if that's the
[18:54] case I'm sorry it's actually part eight
[18:57] um
[18:59] of uh the coming of the lord The Rapture
[19:01] mystery Lord willing we'll be finishing
[19:03] up on brother Ram's sermon from 1965 of
[19:07] course we're just hitting the highlights
[19:08] and if I'm not mistaken it was December
[19:10] 4th 1965 so 59 years later here we are
[19:14] still uh enjoying the benefits and
[19:16] blessings of that sermon from God's
[19:18] Prophet so uh John chapter
[19:21] 14 I believe brother R read verses 1 to
[19:23] 7 we're not going to read all the way
[19:25] down there we'll just read verses one
[19:27] and two so John 14 14 1 and
[19:34] 2 and hopefully everybody had a good
[19:36] rest there on Sunday with one
[19:41] service actually we'll just do one one
[19:44] through four here by God's grace um it's
[19:48] not much reading there um our family can
[19:51] read verses three and four I'll read one
[19:52] and two myself then we'll read three and
[19:54] four together uh by God's grace John
[19:57] chapter 14 verse one says let not your
[20:00] heart be troubled ye believe in God you
[20:02] believe also in me in my father's house
[20:05] are many mansions if it were not so I
[20:08] would have told you I go to prepare a
[20:10] place for you so let's read three and
[20:13] four family here ready 1 2 3 and if I go
[20:17] and prepare a place for you I will come
[20:21] again and receive you unto myself that
[20:25] where I am there ye may be also and
[20:29] whether I go ye know and the way you
[20:32] know may God add his Blessing to the
[20:34] reading of his word hallelujah so this
[20:37] might seem like a strange text for the
[20:38] Rapture but as we'll get to hopefully by
[20:40] the end I'll try to watch the time here
[20:42] let me set a timer um the very sermon
[20:45] right after brother R preached uh the
[20:47] Rapture uh was called he I'm sorry
[20:50] things that are to be and this was his
[20:52] text and he said this was a good sermon
[20:55] topic to follow up the Rapture and of
[20:58] course you you can see why uh because
[21:00] Jesus tells us not to let our hearts be
[21:03] troubled he's going to prepare a place
[21:05] for us U that where he is we can be also
[21:09] so that's the hope of the Rapture right
[21:10] Jesus is coming back for his people to
[21:13] take them to be with him that's where
[21:15] they want to be they don't want to be
[21:17] left behind in this world they don't
[21:18] want to be a part of the Beast system uh
[21:21] or any world system really they want to
[21:23] be part of the kingdom of Jesus Christ
[21:26] the kingdom of God so a great message
[21:28] there uh brother R preached to follow uh
[21:31] the Rapture sermon so I'll be um Lord
[21:33] willing uh finishing the series
[21:35] hopefully tonight we'll see and then uh
[21:37] this sermon in particular will be heavy
[21:39] on quotes so just do your best to take
[21:41] some deep breaths and uh focus in
[21:43] spiritually and you can pray in your
[21:45] heart and ask the Lord to help you to
[21:47] really uh focus in on the quotes that
[21:50] I'll be reading from God's Prophet uh
[21:52] brother William
[21:53] brandom so there's like basically four
[21:56] last topics brother R uh covers that I
[21:59] can find as far as my highlights from
[22:01] his sermon um the prophecy about Los
[22:04] Angeles sinking and then he again tells
[22:07] the preview of the Bride now I'd like to
[22:09] read through that tonight because I just
[22:11] told it from memory and I might have got
[22:13] a few details mixed up so I want to read
[22:15] it here tonight then brother Ram tells
[22:17] us uh and then he offers the the church
[22:20] or the the listeners there not the
[22:21] church but the the Christians there uh
[22:24] at the hotel to move up into Christ if
[22:26] they want to be ready for the Rapture
[22:27] and then he gives a final altar call uh
[22:30] there's no altar there's no space for
[22:32] altar call there at that hotel so he
[22:34] said you got to go to the altar of your
[22:36] heart so those are the last four um
[22:40] topics and then um there are six quotes
[22:43] uh in the remaining sermons of that
[22:45] brother Brandon preached the remainder
[22:46] of his life uh those last we'd say three
[22:50] weeks of his life there's six quotes
[22:52] where he mentions the word rapture he
[22:53] never mentions shout voice Trump after
[22:55] this sermon at least on tape um
[22:59] about the Rapture so if we have time
[23:01] Lord willing we'll look at those briefly
[23:03] by God's
[23:06] grace okay so I want to start with this
[23:08] um brother R repeats this prophecy he
[23:10] says I I remember just my last message
[23:12] in California where I thought I'd never
[23:14] go back again when I predicted Los
[23:16] Angeles will go beneath the ocean thus
[23:18] saith the Lord it will she is done she's
[23:20] washed she's finished what hour I don't
[23:23] know when but it will be sunk right
[23:25] after that the earthquakes begin to jolt
[23:27] and bow he says so critics have uh you
[23:31] know criticized brother brandom that
[23:32] this hasn't come to pass yet but brother
[23:34] BR never put a timestamp on it um and so
[23:38] you know they're wrong to do that of
[23:40] course uh we know there's even Old
[23:42] Testament prophecies that still haven't
[23:43] come to pass like Isaiah's prophecy
[23:45] about the Rapture almost 3,000 years ago
[23:47] still waiting to come to pass so unless
[23:49] God puts a a Tim stamp on it then it's
[23:52] whenever God is going to do it that
[23:53] means God wants to do it at a time an
[23:56] unknown uh day and hour that no one 's
[23:58] aware of um and remember there's five
[24:01] earthquakes recorded in the Book of
[24:03] Revelation the first one is 612 under
[24:06] the Sixth Seal and this might be the
[24:08] earthquake of Los Angeles um Revelation
[24:12] 85 this is a higher possibility I think
[24:15] uh because it's after uh the reality
[24:18] form of the seventh seal happening the
[24:19] reality form of the seventh seal of
[24:21] course is the unknown day and hour of
[24:23] the Rapture of the Gentile bride the
[24:26] Holy Ghost filled bride um and there's
[24:28] earthquake right after that Rapture so
[24:30] that could be it um there's another
[24:33] Rapture a third Rapture in Revelation
[24:35] 1113 and in my opinion no this is not
[24:37] the LA earthquake this is the Jerusalem
[24:39] earthquake in the midst of Daniel's 70th
[24:42] and final
[24:43] week uh this this seems to be only
[24:46] taking place in
[24:48] Jerusalem I believe if I'm not mistaken
[24:50] a tenth part of the city fell I could be
[24:51] wrong on that actual fraction but it's
[24:53] some fraction like that a tenth of the
[24:55] city or something Falls there in
[24:57] Jerusalem
[24:58] the the fourth is in Revelation 11:19
[25:00] this is a higher possibility this is in
[25:03] hail and earthquake after the seventh
[25:06] trumpet is sounded so that's a higher
[25:08] possibility there again just like the
[25:11] earthquake right after the seventh seal
[25:13] is opened in reality form now to me the
[25:15] most likely one is revelation
[25:18] 1618 uh because this is called the worst
[25:21] earthquake that ever was that hard it'd
[25:23] be hard for our human Minds if we've
[25:26] never seen uh maybe uh
[25:29] really devastating earthquakes if we'
[25:30] never seen it with our own eye it'd be
[25:33] hard for us to imagine a worse
[25:35] earthquake that would cause uh you know
[25:37] parts of the West Coast to fall into the
[25:39] ocean so that's why you know it seems
[25:42] like this would be the uh the LA
[25:45] earthquake it's during the seventh and
[25:47] final vial which are the final judgments
[25:50] poured out there in the Great
[25:51] Tribulation period before the battle of
[25:53] Armageddon so that's most likely but uh
[25:56] again brother Ram said thus sayith the
[25:57] Lord so we believe it'll come to pass we
[25:59] have a video with over six thus sayith
[26:01] the Lords that have I'm sorry six thus
[26:02] sayith the Lords that have come to pass
[26:04] a PR pastor friend of mine shared a a
[26:06] PDF document I think he has 10 thus
[26:08] sayith the Lord healings that came to
[26:09] pass I need to find that and I need to
[26:11] get to that I just sometimes forget uh
[26:13] to go get that but I like to make a
[26:14] video on that as well so it seems like
[26:16] there's at least 16 thus sayi the Lord's
[26:19] uh healing or prophecies that have come
[26:21] to pass and then remember there's six
[26:22] thus say the Lords about the New
[26:24] Testament mysteries of God six out of
[26:26] the 12 that have been fulfilled as well
[26:28] so uh we brother Ram has a perfect
[26:30] record with thus sayith the
[26:33] Lord now uh brother Ram says this he
[26:36] goes to the next paragraph he said the
[26:39] same voice that that said uh Los Angeles
[26:42] is going to sink he said is the same
[26:44] voice that said judgment will strike the
[26:46] West Coast in March of 1964 ban was out
[26:49] hunting he had another experience there
[26:50] was men uh there with him that were
[26:53] Witnesses brother R said thus sayi the
[26:55] Lord judgment will strike the West Coast
[26:56] he said two days after that in March of
[26:58] of 1964 on Good Friday Alaska almost
[27:01] sunk so you can easily type in Google
[27:03] duck ducko whatever you want type in
[27:05] 1964 Alaska earthquake it's the second
[27:09] uh most devastating earthquake ever
[27:11] recorded in Alaskan history so uh if you
[27:14] want to look into that uh brother Ram
[27:16] believ that was the Fulfillment of what
[27:18] the Lord told him judgment was going to
[27:20] strike the West Coast
[27:21] there now in the next
[27:24] paragraph yeah he said that the same
[27:26] Gody that said Los Angeles is doomed
[27:27] she's finished I don't know when I can't
[27:29] tell
[27:32] you and then brother random brings us up
[27:34] I want to bring this thought I want to
[27:35] read this brother said I look back in
[27:37] scripture after he prophesied about La
[27:40] sinking um or La being doomed and
[27:42] sinking he said Jesus said capernium
[27:44] capernium how of you that exalted
[27:47] yourself rather up into heaven shall be
[27:49] brought down into hell for if the mighty
[27:50] works that have been done in you had
[27:52] been done in Sodom it's stand today and
[27:55] about 150 years from there Sodom had
[27:57] already in the then capernium is in the
[27:59] water to today now a lot of critics of
[28:02] brother Ram criticize him for this
[28:04] brother ramam said capernium was in the
[28:06] water now anyone can go on YouTube or
[28:09] search and the ruins of capernium are
[28:12] still above water today so some people
[28:15] criticize brother brandham it's my
[28:16] humble opinion uh brother Bram just
[28:18] didn't realize capernium was in Ruins
[28:21] and not underwater it doesn't matter
[28:23] because brother Ram never said thus
[28:24] sayith the Lord capernium is in the
[28:26] water brother Ram just thought he's
[28:28] trying to remember the scripture from
[28:29] Matthew 11 so have your Bible you can
[28:31] get to Matthew 11 um Jesus said in
[28:34] Matthew 11:33 and thou capernium which
[28:36] art exalted unto Heaven shall be brought
[28:38] down to
[28:40] hell for if the mighty Works which had
[28:42] been done in thee had been done in Sodom
[28:43] it would have remained unto this day so
[28:46] Jesus says capernium will be brought
[28:47] down to Hell so it's likely Jesus meant
[28:51] just the civilization would be destroyed
[28:53] which it is it's in Ruins today that the
[28:55] biblical uh portion of it is in Ruins
[28:57] today
[28:58] it likely means he means the leaders and
[29:00] all the unbelief all the unbelieving
[29:02] Sinners will be brought down will be
[29:04] lost that's that's basically what it it
[29:06] looks like it means there from the Lord
[29:08] Jesus Jesus never said it it would go
[29:10] under the water God bless you um Jesus
[29:13] never said anything on that he said
[29:15] brought down to Hell so um you know many
[29:19] people misunderstand this okay so that's
[29:22] why we want to read it from the
[29:23] scripture but I say to you in verse 24
[29:25] that it should be more tolerable for the
[29:26] land of Sodom in the day of Jud Jud M
[29:28] than for thee so capernium must have saw
[29:31] many mighty miracles of the Lord Jesus
[29:34] Christ so again we you can see capernium
[29:36] is not underwater today at least that
[29:38] section uh of the biblical ruins there
[29:42] they're still available you can see it
[29:43] and visit it um so it seems like brother
[29:46] Ram just was confused or in his memory
[29:48] he had misunderstood something um but it
[29:50] doesn't matter because that part wasn't
[29:52] thus sayith the Lord the thus sayith the
[29:53] Lord part was about the earthquake in LA
[29:56] um so it's plain to see that now he goes
[29:59] on to say that same spirit of God that
[30:01] said all these things and done all these
[30:03] things it said oh City Capernaum who
[30:05] called yourself by the name of Los of
[30:07] angels Los Angeles you've how you've
[30:10] exalted yourself into heaven and the
[30:13] Very root and seat of Satan you've
[30:14] exalted yourself preachers it's a
[30:16] graveyard for them and that's true La
[30:19] has a lot ofh Prosperity preachers which
[30:21] is it's a spiritual graveyard good men
[30:24] go there and die like rats what Havoc
[30:27] you that call by the name of angels if
[30:29] the mighty Works have been done in Sodom
[30:30] that's been done in you it stood today
[30:32] but your hour has come brother says you
[30:35] watch and see if it ain't I'm a false
[30:37] prophet that's a very powerful statement
[30:39] to make see there she is she's laying
[30:41] there so he's talking about the City of
[30:44] Angels he's not talking about capernium
[30:45] he's talking about the City of Angels so
[30:48] we still stand behind that prophecy just
[30:50] as these other prophecies brother said
[30:52] the United States Church would be
[30:53] dancing to rock and roll thus sayith the
[30:55] Lord in
[30:56] 1965 um and here we saw it started
[30:58] happening around the year 2000 where
[31:00] mega churches now have rock and roll
[31:02] Services
[31:03] essentially U and they cut uh they cut
[31:06] out all the uh standards all the
[31:08] Holiness standards you can smoke drink
[31:10] women can cut their hair wear sexy
[31:12] clothes all these prophecies brother
[31:14] gave us according to the vision have
[31:15] come to pass we've seen that come to
[31:17] pass and all the healings that he
[31:18] prophesied there on that video have come
[31:21] to pass as well so in other words
[31:22] brother mam is very trustworthy as a
[31:24] prophet of God a genuine true prophet of
[31:26] God
[31:28] now let's look at the preview of the
[31:29] Bride here now this is I tried my best
[31:30] to remember the story here from I'd
[31:32] listen to this I've gone to this sermon
[31:33] numerous times of course preaching this
[31:35] uh eight part series on this sermon
[31:38] brother Ram said I remember that night I
[31:40] seen the preview of the Bride I stood
[31:42] there I seen a beautiful little lady
[31:43] just correctly dressed marching this way
[31:46] there was somebody standing by me in the
[31:47] vision they said the preview of the
[31:49] Bride I seen her go by they come on this
[31:51] side and went around so it's a group of
[31:53] beautifully dressed women holy holy
[31:55] dressed
[31:56] women he said then I heard it coming up
[31:59] churches from the other side there come
[32:00] the Asian Church you talk about filth
[32:03] here come the European Church oh my and
[32:05] then I heard a rock and roll coming it
[32:07] was Miss America the church and she
[32:08] didn't have on any clothes she had
[32:11] papers like newspapers gray holding in
[32:13] front of her dancing by rock and roll
[32:15] Miss America the church and I stood
[32:17] there in his presence and I thought oh
[32:19] God as a minister if that's the best we
[32:20] could do oh you know how you feel I I
[32:24] thought oh God hide me if I could just
[32:26] get away from here if all that we've
[32:28] done and that's what we have to produce
[32:30] if that's
[32:32] what and then when then women passed by
[32:34] all doing all kinds of rocks and things
[32:36] and short hair painted faces Now isn't
[32:38] that what the churches are today it's
[32:40] totally
[32:41] fulfilled and as they passed by like
[32:43] that supposed to be virgins to Christ
[32:45] and when she passed by like that I turn
[32:47] my head you know with this holding in
[32:49] front of me it was disgraceful the back
[32:50] of them and there they was going like
[32:52] that I turned my head to weeping like
[32:54] that and I said I couldn't stand it here
[32:57] here I am a minister of the church and
[32:59] that's what I produced for him I said oh
[33:01] God I can't look let me die let me fade
[33:03] away so being in the presence of that
[33:05] filth brother Ram said let me die let me
[33:08] uh let me fade away but as soon as it
[33:10] went
[33:12] out he said they drop off I just heard
[33:15] the sound as it went away then I heard
[33:16] something like Onward Christian Soldiers
[33:19] I looked and here come that saintly
[33:21] bunch of little girls just exactly the
[33:22] way they was at the beginning all
[33:24] correctly dressed their H their hair
[33:26] hanging way down the back smooth clean
[33:28] marching like this to the step of the
[33:30] Gospel she was the word right and we're
[33:32] not all the word right only Jesus was
[33:34] the fullness of the godhead bodly uh
[33:36] fullness of the word he was the word
[33:38] made flesh but we have a portion of the
[33:40] word because we have a portion of the
[33:41] Holy Ghost and God is the word his
[33:44] spirit is the
[33:45] word so she was the word they look like
[33:48] one out of every nation I was looking at
[33:50] it as they passed by they seem to pass
[33:52] by instead of going down they started
[33:54] going up Rapture I noticed one of one of
[33:57] them trying two or three of them trying
[33:59] getting out of line I screamed stay in
[34:00] line the vision left me and I was
[34:01] standing in the room screaming stay in
[34:03] line like that so there's a more
[34:06] detailed telling when I tried to tell it
[34:08] a few weeks ago so hope that was a
[34:09] blessing by the God's grace so we can
[34:11] see right before the Rapture there could
[34:13] be some people trying to get out of line
[34:14] bride members even and the and brother
[34:17] R's voice will be shouting stay in line
[34:19] so that's what I believe the fivefold
[34:20] ministry is preaching today stay in line
[34:22] stay with the word um stay obedient to
[34:26] the commands of the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:27] Christ from the Bible now uh brother Ram
[34:31] says next thought here so now we're
[34:32] getting into uh his closing here it's
[34:35] just got a few more thoughts about
[34:36] moving up into Christ brother says I
[34:39] wonder could it already be passed could
[34:40] the bride already be called is that what
[34:42] we're going through
[34:43] today so again brother Ram you know
[34:45] numerous times he's trying to get the
[34:47] people to see the lateness of the hour
[34:48] of course with their life as now we see
[34:50] 59 years later with their life no one's
[34:53] guaranteed tomorrow so that's what
[34:54] brother RAM does as a preacher many
[34:55] preachers still do it today it doesn't
[34:57] matter what Church you go to just trying
[34:59] to get the people to grasp uh the
[35:01] lateness of the hour no man knows the
[35:04] day or the hour of of the coming of the
[35:06] Lord so in other words be ready and we
[35:09] saw brother do this in uh Souls uh that
[35:12] are in prisoned now you know they're
[35:13] praying at the end oh God uh let my
[35:15] children get in uh if if time if there's
[35:18] no more time he's quoting you know
[35:20] Revelation 10 I believe that means uh
[35:23] there's no more delay time would be no
[35:25] more right I believe there was no more
[35:26] delay till God would fulfill Revelation
[35:29] 10 1-7 that's what I believe uh about
[35:32] that particular scripture time would be
[35:33] no more and then the book would be
[35:36] brought down and then it be eaten by
[35:37] John and taken all around the world I
[35:39] believe that seems to be like the most
[35:41] spiritual um explanation of that
[35:44] scripture not that time ended because of
[35:47] course we're still keeping time right
[35:48] people are still getting saved the shout
[35:50] brother's message is still going around
[35:52] the world so it seems to be the most
[35:54] spiritual uh understanding of that
[35:56] scripture
[35:58] brother Ram said she has to be molded
[36:00] and made in the image of Christ Christ
[36:02] is the word there cannot be one thing
[36:04] added he talks about uh a woman can't
[36:08] have a hand like a man and then the
[36:10] other hand like a paw of a dog it's got
[36:12] to be exactly the word of God he is the
[36:14] word the bride is part of the bridegroom
[36:16] the woman is part of the husband because
[36:17] she's taken out of the husband Eve was a
[36:19] part of Adam from his side so is the
[36:22] bride not taken from denomination thank
[36:23] God for that uh but taken from the bosom
[36:26] of the word of God God for this day what
[36:29] a beautiful uh statement that is taken
[36:31] from the bosom of the word so the heart
[36:33] of Christ right the bride's taken from
[36:34] the heart of Christ and the bride should
[36:37] be a bride after the heart of
[36:40] Christ so he's uh brother Ram's now
[36:43] speaking he says he's singing When the
[36:45] Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll be there
[36:46] talking about the Rapture he said it's
[36:48] been spoken it should come to pass it
[36:49] will come to pass he said people no one
[36:52] wants to die no one wants to be lost let
[36:54] me tell you whatever you do I don't care
[36:55] how well you go to church how loyal you
[36:56] are to church that's fine nothing
[36:59] against that and I thank God for loyal
[37:00] church members by God's
[37:02] grace you should do that you should go
[37:04] to church you do that keep on going to
[37:06] church but whatever just throw away your
[37:09] traditions and move right up into Christ
[37:12] because it's going to sound one of these
[37:13] days and you're going to be caught with
[37:14] the mark of the beast on you and not
[37:16] know what it is until it's too late
[37:18] that's exactly right so of course people
[37:20] that would be caught with a mark of the
[37:21] beast they'd already been deceived right
[37:23] anyone caught with the mark of the beast
[37:25] would have never been predestinated to
[37:26] be saved they would have been the ones
[37:28] that blasphemed the Holy Ghost so
[37:30] brother R makes it plain to the people
[37:32] there they could be sitting amongst uh
[37:35] bride members there but then take the
[37:36] mark of the beast that fits judas's
[37:38] scariot right he was right there amongst
[37:41] 11 elect plus the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:43] himself and yet we would say he take the
[37:45] mark of the beast in other words he
[37:46] blasphemed the Holy Ghost and was lost
[37:49] maybe seemingly not even aware what he
[37:51] he was doing but of course he had been
[37:53] aware of selling out the Savior so
[37:55] brother Ram you know he just always
[37:57] brings it so seriously down to the
[37:58] individual no matter how secure some
[38:00] people think they are it's it's not
[38:02] about being just around the bride or
[38:04] around True Believers you got to be a
[38:06] True Believer yourself you got to have
[38:08] the Holy Ghost baptism yourself so
[38:10] brother Ram brings it down I love it to
[38:12] the uh the sacredness of the gospel and
[38:14] the individual having to answer to the
[38:16] Lord Jesus what did the individual do
[38:18] with the talent that the Lord Jesus
[38:20] Christ gave
[38:22] him so again he said throw away your
[38:24] traditions and move right up into Christ
[38:26] and recently with the Corinthian
[38:28] uh series we've been preaching on
[38:29] Traditions that they had right sexual
[38:31] immorality suing people getting drunk at
[38:33] the Lord's table of course people
[38:35] thinking they're uh better than others
[38:37] so prideful Spirits um you know people
[38:40] uh worshiping preachers people
[38:43] criticizing preachers uh divisions
[38:46] envying all these Spirits all all these
[38:49] are just traditions of men that need to
[38:51] be uh cast down they need to be repented
[38:54] of and brother manam said get rid of all
[38:56] those traditions and move up into Christ
[38:58] of course Christ is the Holy Ghost
[38:59] Christ is the life of God it's a
[39:02] Spirit-filled and spirit-led
[39:06] life then brother Ram says God bless you
[39:08] um I've kept them too long here he says
[39:12] the offering that you took for me uh
[39:13] take it to pay the hotel on the overtime
[39:16] that he kept it he said I got about
[39:18] eight or 10 more pages on the Rapture
[39:20] there but I just didn't have time to get
[39:21] it God bless you and I if voice of God
[39:23] has has that I plead with you again let
[39:25] me see those other eight or nine 10
[39:26] pages I think I showed you five pages
[39:29] five pages they've released we'd love to
[39:31] see those other Pages brother B says
[39:33] then do you love the Lord Jesus let's
[39:34] stand now reverently and they start
[39:36] singing uh is nations are breaking the
[39:38] day of redemption is near then brother
[39:40] sings I love him because he first loved
[39:42] me and he says you want to make the
[39:44] Rapture how many here is interested in
[39:47] making the Rapture say God I want to
[39:48] make it with all my heart and they sing

[39:54] hand okay now he gives the altar call so
[39:57] here we are at the altar call this last
[39:58] part before the the final
[40:01] prayer he said with heads bowed uh
[40:04] bowing our heads to the dust from which
[40:06] we were
[40:07] brought he says knowing that you got a
[40:09] soul in there that has to answer to God

[40:13] for the Rapture if it would come tonight
[40:16] and you'd want to be remembered in
[40:17] prayer just raise your hand we have no
[40:19] place to make an altar call your altar
[40:21] is in your heart anyhow raise your hand
[40:23] God bless you my feel that I'm not ready
[40:26] brother brandham I really I want to be a
[40:28] Christian I've tried to be but there's
[40:29] always something missing I know that I'm
[40:32] not just where I should be so even
[40:34] individuals tonight let's think about
[40:36] our lives towards the end of this sermon
[40:38] I'm already uh I'm only 20 minutes in
[40:40] now by God's grace but by the end of it
[40:42] you want to be thinking
[40:43] about is anything missing in my life for
[40:46] the Christian Life examine your life be

[40:58] bed thinking about the Lord thinking
[40:59] about the word of God um any thoughts
[41:02] that have stirred you uh recently in the
[41:05] word of God do
[41:07] that he says have he said oh God have
[41:10] mercy I raise my hand be merciful to me
[41:12] 20 year30 hands up in this hotel already
[41:15] in this little group more is going up so
[41:19] this is how think how a prophet would
[41:20] end the last within the last month
[41:22] before he passed away how would he end a
[41:24] sermon on the Rapture when he's in a in
[41:26] a assembly they're are gathering in a
[41:28] hotel with only Christians uh he offers
[41:31] a prayer for them just to look at their
[41:33] life and say is anything missing do I
[41:34] feel like I'm not ready to go in the
[41:36] Rapture would anything hinder me from
[41:37] going and he asked them to raise their
[41:39] hand and brother bam offers this prayer
[41:42] I'll read the prayer it's a short prayer
[41:44] dear God you know what's behind that
[41:45] hand down there under the heart I pray
[41:47] dear God there's only one thing I'm
[41:49] responsible for that's to tell the truth
[41:51] and dear God they want to be saved they
[41:53] want to really they don't want this
[41:55] something that's just some emotion some
[41:56] work up some denominational system some
[41:58] Creed some some Dogma that's been added
[42:02] they understand father that takes the
[42:03] pure unadulterated word of God
[42:05] everything else will pass away even
[42:07] heavens and earth but it won't and if we
[42:10] be that word the Earth will pass away
[42:11] from beneath us but we can never pass
[42:13] away because we are that word the Bride
[42:15] of the groom I pray for each one that
[42:18] you'll Grant to them Father is my
[42:20] sincere
[42:21] prayer then brother Braham said father
[42:23] excuse me this kind of goes with the
[42:24] quotes I ended with last Wednesday night
[42:26] where brother ranom prayed God forgive
[42:28] us of our mistakes and may the Holy
[42:30] Ghost give understanding to the people
[42:34] uh in the in the areas where where I
[42:36] made mistakes in my sermon so I put a
[42:39] video about that about that uh I put a
[42:41] video out about that this week hopefully
[42:43] that was a blessing to see how a genuine
[42:45] Prophet would pray he'd pray Lord if I
[42:47] made any mistake let the Holy Spirit
[42:49] correct the people and how the how's the
[42:50] Holy Spirit going to correct the people
[42:52] pointing them back to the word of
[42:54] God and he says somehow or another a
[42:56] great Holy Spirit splice them together
[42:58] now splice means to join or connect by
[43:00] interweaving together so brother R said
[43:04] excuse me Father for being so nervous
[43:06] here saying words broke up and cut up
[43:09] splice them together Holy Spirit in your
[43:11] own Divine Way deliver them to the
[43:13] hearts of the people from my heart and
[43:15] the motive and objective that was in my
[43:17] heart I have towards you won't you and
[43:20] Save which can be saved draw to you Lord
[43:23] and may we be ready for that rapturing
[43:24] hour that's soon at hand for I ask it in
[43:27] Jesus name amen then he dismisses now
[43:30] the chairman of the convention and
[43:31] that's the end of that wonderful sermon
[43:34] uh from
[43:36] 1965 so again looking at some of the
[43:39] highlights there brother looked at
[43:40] remember scoffers Revelation election
[43:42] types of the Rapture shout voice
[43:46] Trump um and then he closed with these
[43:49] uh ideas here about uh the Los Angeles
[43:53] prophecy the preview of the Bride moving
[43:54] up into Christ and an altar call uh for
[43:57] people that didn't feel ready to get
[43:59] ready uh by the grace of
[44:01] God okay so yeah looks like I have time
[44:03] to go over those six quotes
[44:07] here so there's six quotes where brother
[44:10] says Rapture after this Rapture sermon
[44:13] from 1965 and again he never said
[44:15] anything about the shout Voice or Trump
[44:17] that I can find uh during these last few
[44:21] sermons okay so the next the the very
[44:23] next day brother Ram was in California
[44:25] so he traveled from Arizona Yuma to
[44:28] California I don't know how to say that
[44:30] Rialto I'm not sure how to say that
[44:33] California brother R said last night I
[44:35] spoke on the subject of the Rapture that
[44:37] might seem uh to be a strange subject to
[44:39] speak on at a banquet but most everyone
[44:41] there was
[44:45] Christians he said now tonight I want to
[44:47] speak on things that are to
[44:50] be speaking last night on The Rapture so
[44:52] tonight I want to speak on this subject
[44:54] that it might tie together with last
[44:56] night's message now there's going to be
[44:58] a rapture we know that that's in the
[45:01] future Jesus here in John 14 talked
[45:03] about he's gone ahead to prepare a place
[45:05] for us let not your hearts be
[45:08] troubled he said you believe in God
[45:10] believe also in
[45:12] me okay so brother man preach a sermon
[45:14] things that are to be I'm not going to
[45:15] go through um even the highlights of
[45:18] this but I just want you to see that he
[45:19] was trying to tie this thought in in
[45:21] John chapter 14 with the Rapture Jesus
[45:24] is going to prepare a place for us that
[45:26] he's going to come back can get us with
[45:27] the Rapture right the meeting in the air
[45:29] and then take us to these Mansions or
[45:32] we'd say uh first the marriage supper of
[45:33] the Lamb the meeting in the air marriage
[45:35] supper of the Lamb of course then we
[45:37] have the Millennium uh and then
[45:39] Millennium will build houses here and
[45:41] then the future home was would I believe
[45:43] would be where these Mansions would be
[45:45] the future home there at after the great
[45:47] white Throne
[45:49] judgment now brother man mentions the
[45:51] Rapture a second time in this sermon
[45:53] things that are to
[45:55] be uh he again ties in um or he talks
[45:58] about how the Rapture is pre-planned by
[46:01] God um he says that great church that he
[46:03] established on the day of Pentecost he
[46:05] sent the Holy Ghost they had to suffer
[46:07] martyrdom and go into the dirt into the
[46:09] earth into the Dark Age to bring again
[46:11] in the age of Luther and come out the
[46:13] full stature of the Bride of Jesus
[46:15] Christ for the last day day so brother
[46:18] talking about the first four Church ages
[46:20] that were kind of dying out right uh and
[46:22] all the martyrdom but then in the fifth
[46:24] sixth and seventh age God was restoring
[46:27] ing through Luther Wesley and God's
[46:29] Prophet Elijah brother brandham
[46:32] therefore the bride and the Rapture will
[46:33] come forth and there is all pre-planned
[46:36] by God all backed up from the beginning
[46:38] he knowed every man every place who
[46:40] would set all about it it's all
[46:42] pre-planned so brother man preaches us
[46:44] things that are to be in other words
[46:46] God's already got it all planned out
[46:47] after the Rapture God's got everything
[46:48] planned out even throughout the church
[46:50] age everything has been planned out in
[46:52] other words so the people don't have to
[46:54] worry the people don't have to be afraid
[46:56] like said don't let your heart fear so
[46:58] we can take that as encouragement
[47:00] tonight Saints here in akan and of
[47:01] course around the world don't fear when
[47:03] we see things uh shake up I even saw
[47:05] today it seemed like the French
[47:06] government was having issues you know
[47:08] and um they ousted their leader macron
[47:11] or whatever his name was just things
[47:14] look like they're shaking up all the
[47:16] time when we feel that coming on us we
[47:18] got to just breathe the Holy Name of
[47:20] Jesus in prayer and ask God to help us
[47:22] not to fear help us to trust God in the
[47:24] midst of storms trials as we said on
[47:27] Sunday the uncertainty remember we're
[47:29] not founded on the shifting Sands of
[47:31] Life uh we're founded on the The Rock
[47:35] the revelation of Jesus Christ that's
[47:37] doing his commands keeping his
[47:41] commands so B said God made it that way
[47:44] he's gone to prepare a place for us and
[47:45] when we get there it'll all be prepared
[47:47] just like even this night is prepared
[47:50] this hour is prepared God knew the the
[47:52] snow would come God knew uh we could get
[47:54] up to two inches of of snow there there
[47:57] tonight in akan so we want to stay off
[47:58] the roads his great for knowledge tells
[48:00] him all these things by for
[48:03] knowledge okay so we see there's two
[48:06] mentions of the Rapture now we go to the
[48:08] very next night uh he's in San
[48:11] Bernardino I think I'm saying that right
[48:13] California he mentions the Rapture again
[48:16] and brother mam gives this familiar
[48:17] illustration we've been uh dealing with
[48:19] it repeatedly about the wheat
[48:21] plant uh right Luther Wesley uh we can
[48:25] even add Azu in there and then Elijah uh
[48:28] is in the seed the wheat plant
[48:30] eventually produces a mature seed so
[48:32] brother Ram goes through this uh he says
[48:36] uh it must produce exactly like it did
[48:38] in the days of Pentecost he said but you
[48:41] get to a place each one gets starchy
[48:43] gets off they can't receive new
[48:44] revelation they're settled down there
[48:46] they are there they die and the life
[48:49] goes right through that and goes on to
[48:51] make the wheat and when the wheat comes
[48:53] that life that's traveled through that
[48:55] wheat the resurrection brings the whole
[48:57] thing out yes brings up for the Rapture
[49:00] so brother says like the life of God is
[49:01] coming up into the seed and the life of
[49:04] God is bringing the church up into
[49:05] higher truth we can plainly see that
[49:08] with Martin Luther maybe I need to
[49:09] preach a sermon on just him and all the
[49:12] all the humanity that was still in his
[49:14] uh Ministry although a mighty man of God
[49:16] although probably the most famous
[49:18] Christian perhaps in the last 2,000
[49:19] years since the
[49:20] apostles um one of the most impactful
[49:24] Christians to ever live but yet uh he
[49:27] was blinded to some of the things uh
[49:28] that had not been restored such as the
[49:30] godhead um infant baptisms uh you know
[49:33] living a holy life of course smoking
[49:37] drinking alcohol things like that
[49:39] sanctification issues he wasn't uh
[49:41] didn't didn't have the revelation of
[49:43] that but God still was bringing life
[49:44] through that right he brought the church
[49:46] out of the Dark Ages he brought the
[49:48] church out of the Roman Catholic Church
[49:50] into a greater light uh but we know life
[49:53] is keeping uh life is continuing to
[49:55] increase and now we can see we should
[49:58] have uh the full life of the Apostles as
[50:01] far as obeying the commands of God the
[50:03] the Revelation the power the love of the
[50:06] Apostles all those things our hearts are
[50:08] turned back to the apostolic
[50:11] fathers brother BR says then gets into
[50:13] his ministry this ministry started first
[50:15] with Divine Healing performing Miracles
[50:17] and if God let it go through an ordinary
[50:19] church just like we already had then it
[50:21] wasn't God again a very beautiful
[50:22] scriptural point if brother Ram's
[50:25] Ministry pointed people to denomination
[50:26] or back to domination it wouldn't fit
[50:28] the pattern John the Baptist called the
[50:30] people out of uh the Pharisee religion
[50:33] the sadducee religion he actually called
[50:35] them even physically out to the
[50:37] Wilderness to be baptized and he called
[50:39] those other denominations brood of
[50:41] vipers right uh so any true Ministry of
[50:45] God will call the people out of uh the
[50:48] popular denominational ministries of
[50:50] that day same thing with Jesus you after
[50:52] John went off the scene Jesus called
[50:54] them um of their father the devil those
[50:56] Pharisees Sadducees he gave him all the
[50:58] woses in Matthew
[50:59] 23 U same thing with Martin Luther John
[51:02] Wesley isusa Street they all came out of
[51:05] those denominations so same thing with
[51:06] brother randam another proof brother
[51:08] Rand was a genuine prophet of God he
[51:10] didn't point the people back to the dead
[51:11] denominational systems he pointed them
[51:14] uh uh to an independent uh spiritual
[51:17] brother man calls it organism a living
[51:19] organism of the Life of Christ
[51:24] Hallelujah okay um now we're still in
[51:26] the sermon modern events brother R
[51:28] mentioned this uh now here we get into a
[51:31] good quote on the bride age now some
[51:33] people have heard this quote bride age
[51:34] and they made it this strange Doctrine
[51:37] they made it something totally different
[51:40] um than what brother Ram intends it to
[51:42] do so let's listen here as brother R
[51:44] reads it we're not living in a
[51:45] Pentecostal age we're living in another
[51:47] age so think of Aza we're not in the zza
[51:49] Revival anymore we can plainly see it so
[51:52] we're not living in the Methodist age
[51:53] we're not living in another age I'm
[51:55] sorry we're living in another age we're
[51:56] living up here to the bride age the
[51:58] calling out of the church and getting it
[52:01] ready for the Rapture so even ausri it
[52:04] wasn't calling people out to a Rapture
[52:06] it was restoring the
[52:08] gifts now they had some remember we
[52:10] preached on that last year they had some
[52:11] false ideas like oh we shouldn't have we
[52:13] shouldn't get married we shouldn't have
[52:14] children because the Rapture is so close
[52:15] right so they had that that those false
[52:18] understandings there brother Ram said
[52:20] they didn't have the former Reign yet
[52:21] they didn't have the teaching Reign yet
[52:23] on noomen preachers and so many other
[52:26] topics uh the Malachi 4 Ministry uh
[52:29] predestination there were so many even
[52:31] even the correct operation of gifts we
[52:33] see at the end of William Seymour's life
[52:34] he finally understood the evidence is
[52:36] not tongues it's a Christian Life Like
[52:38] We Believe the full Christian Life uh
[52:41] that the Holy Ghost should produce in a
[52:42] believer's
[52:44] life so brother Ram says uh we are up
[52:48] here in the bright age the calling out
[52:49] of the church and getting it ready for
[52:51] the Rapture that's the age that we're
[52:53] living in now to my honest opinion
[52:55] that's the exact truth now brother man
[52:57] doesn't cite any scriptures right so all
[52:58] these people that have their false ideas
[53:00] about the bright age they're venturing
[53:01] without Authority they're presuming they
[53:03] don't have any scriptures brother just
[53:05] saying uh that the he even said it the
[53:08] Revival of aus stre is over right they
[53:10] when did they turn it down everybody
[53:12] knows 1956 right 50 years from 1906 they
[53:15] turn it down so brother R's making a
[53:17] point here now we're in the calling out
[53:19] of the Bride we're not calling people
[53:21] just to gifts we're not calling people
[53:22] to just emotion or uh even even
[53:25] dedication we're calling
[53:26] people to The Full Experience of the
[53:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost so we rejoice
[53:31] in all the gifts we rejoice in all the
[53:33] the doctrine we rejoice in the the the
[53:36] full restoration of the book of Acts
[53:38] Church Hallelujah now we know there's
[53:39] still more power to come we believe that
[53:41] brother Ram said it's rapturing faith is
[53:43] that final anointing there during the
[53:44] time of the squeeze that will be poured
[53:46] out upon the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[53:48] believe that we can see we need more
[53:49] power uh but we've we're thankful for
[53:51] the power we have seen and for the love
[53:52] of God and uh the doctrine that we have
[53:55] we're thankful for all these things that
[53:56] we have from the early church but we
[53:58] know there's more to come because it's
[54:00] prophesied in Joel 2 uh
[54:04] 23-26 so again we take away all the
[54:08] mysticism from some people about or uh
[54:11] the misunderstanding of the Bride age to
[54:13] me it just seems like it's this time
[54:15] since 56 1956 on where okay they uh zus
[54:20] Street had their chance to repent they
[54:22] didn't they turn it down right even
[54:23] America they turned it down they took
[54:24] the rock and roll of Elvis from 1956 and
[54:27] we can see where they're at today but
[54:29] since then God's been calling out a
[54:31] bride through the ministry of the
[54:33] seventh Church age messenger the seventh
[54:36] angel the Elijah the fourth Elijah
[54:38] anointing God's been calling out and
[54:40] making a bride ready and as I said last
[54:42] week even in uh Junction City Ohio God
[54:45] is still calling out a bride Hallelujah
[54:48] 17 baptized last year more baptized
[54:50] course in uh other churches like Lime
[54:52] Ohio and different places around the
[54:54] area they've been baptized the shout is
[54:56] still going out people are still hearing
[54:58] the shout get ready the bridegroom comes
[55:00] right they're still getting ready for
[55:01] the Rapture so the shout I believe is
[55:03] still going uh around the world we can
[55:05] see it plainly so I believe the bride
[55:07] age is this this baptism of the Holy
[55:09] Ghost experience since uh the Asuza
[55:13] Pentecost movement this uh Revival turn
[55:16] down uh God's Prophet uh brother brand a
[55:19] 50-year Revival they turn it down so God
[55:22] is now calling out the bride with the
[55:24] former Reign and looking for the latter
[55:27] rain once once the Full Gospel has been
[55:29] preached to Every Nation as Jesus said
[55:31] in Matthew 24 the gospel must be
[55:33] preached to Every Nation then the end
[55:34] will come not every nation has fully
[55:36] heard the message of the hour so it's
[55:39] our duty to do that God can use this
[55:41] video um God can use whatever he wants
[55:44] to get the gospel to be heard by every
[55:45] nation that way um there's no excuses
[55:48] you know when the tribulation happens
[55:50] there's no excuses there's there's no
[55:51] one that wanted to be in the Rapture
[55:53] that that's not included in the Rapture
[55:55] all those who want to be the Rapture
[55:56] will be included
[55:58] Hallelujah now it goes on to say and
[56:00] this is a book of Prophecy its Believers
[56:02] are commanded are to honor and read it
[56:04] and believe it's author for every word
[56:07] that's written in there must come to
[56:09] pass so it behooves us to continue to
[56:11] read the Bible as I told you I've been
[56:13] reading through uh Ezekiel and enjoying
[56:16] it uh very much so uh everything that's
[56:19] been promised has to come to pass
[56:21] because it is Jesus Christ in each age
[56:24] the same yesterday it was Jesus Christ
[56:27] was in Noah it was Jesus Christ in Moses
[56:29] in other words the Holy Ghost right the
[56:30] logos it was Jesus Christ in David
[56:33] Hallelujah it was Jesus Christ and
[56:35] Joseph it's Jesus Christ the same
[56:36] yesterday today and forever and it's
[56:38] Jesus Christ among his people today
[56:40] doing the things that he promised he
[56:42] would do in this age it's Jesus Christ
[56:45] Hallelujah he said but the church has
[56:46] become so starchy so far away like the
[56:48] brother here said the church has become
[56:50] the same way till they've got to have
[56:53] something to shake us back to the word
[56:55] now if if you're in the in the message
[56:57] baptized with the Holy Ghost you have
[56:59] been shaken back to the word but I think
[57:01] all of us can say in our sometimes in
[57:02] our minds we get we get tired so we need
[57:05] a shaking of our human Spirits right
[57:07] that's where it can apply to us God
[57:08] Shake us up we saw that happen when the
[57:10] brothers came in from Pennsylvania
[57:11] really shook us up right people down at
[57:13] the altar for an hour and a half two
[57:15] hours maybe
[57:17] longer that's good we need shakings of
[57:19] our human Spirit that's called the
[57:20] renewal of our minds that's called a
[57:22] transformed Spirit that's that's called
[57:24] A Renewed Spirit as Paul said be renewed
[57:26] day by day but there's times we get a
[57:28] special renewing we need
[57:31] that he said how is how how is it going
[57:34] to do it it's got to come according to
[57:35] God's Own plan it cannot it cannot come
[57:37] by laymen it will not come by
[57:39] businessmen it cannot come by Churches
[57:41] God has laid down his plan so God has
[57:43] laid down his plan to shake the bride to
[57:45] get them ready so if your life's being
[57:47] shaken praise God may it shake uh even
[57:49] says that in Hebrews chapter 12 God's
[57:51] going to shake all things so we have to
[57:52] expect God's going to shake Us in other
[57:54] words to let go of anything that we feel
[57:56] like is important and uh just get ready
[57:59] for the coming of the Lord if it's in
[58:00] our day by the grace of
[58:04] God all right now this this this shows
[58:08] to me the uh the insincerity of
[58:10] preachers that would say there's nothing
[58:12] left to be fulfilled brother Ram says
[58:14] this whole book has to be fulfilled
[58:16] right Isaiah 25:8 has not been fulfilled
[58:18] there's things that need to be fulfilled
[58:20] earthquakes and I'm back to Matthew 24
[58:22] earthquakes pestilence says Wars rumors
[58:24] of wars so every war that's going on now
[58:26] is a fulfillment of the prophecy that
[58:29] Jesus gave so it's insincere for people
[58:31] to say there's nothing left to be
[58:33] fulfilled we see the Jews coming back
[58:35] Nations haven't heard the message um and
[58:39] the end can't come until these
[58:40] scriptures are
[58:43] fulfilled okay now uh in this sermon I
[58:45] got a couple more quotes here then we're
[58:46] almost done brother man breaks into this
[58:48] thought of with uh animal or human
[58:51] reproduction uh he he breaks into the
[58:54] thought of one in a mill ion so brother
[58:57] Ram talks about when uh male and female
[58:59] reproduce there's millions of germs but
[59:02] there's only one egg um and brother Bram
[59:05] applies that um to the
[59:07] Rapture he says one out of a million
[59:10] this is in modern events made near made
[59:11] clear by prophecy he also used this in
[59:13] the Rapture sermon again uh from a few
[59:16] days before this was preached this was
[59:17] January 6 so in January 4th I'm sorry
[59:20] December 6th so December 4th brother
[59:22] Brandon preached that as well he says
[59:25] what if it be that way tonight so it's
[59:26] not thus sayith the lord it's just a a
[59:28] thought interesting thought that seems
[59:31] to fit there's 500 million supposed to
[59:33] be I think Christians in the world about
[59:36] that figure just a round figure if the
[59:38] Rapture would come tonight in the living
[59:40] going there' only be 500 people well
[59:44] there's that many missing any day almost
[59:46] that can't be counted for the bride will
[59:47] be taken away and we'd wonder what it's
[59:49] all about and the people going right on
[59:50] preaching saying they're getting this or
[59:53] that or the other and look what a
[59:54] deception that would be say if it would
[59:56] be that I don't say it is notice brother
[59:59] saying brother man saying I'm not saying
[1:00:00] this is I don't know I'm No Authority on
[1:00:03] that God's a judge of that but look how
[1:00:04] easy it could happen in all figures and
[1:00:06] things how it could be
[1:00:09] proven okay so we get this this
[1:00:11] illustration of hero of a very small one
[1:00:14] ordained a life out of millions and
[1:00:17] brother B's drawing that that's how the
[1:00:18] Rapture is going to be remember two in a
[1:00:19] bed one taken two out in the field one
[1:00:21] taken uh two grounding at the Mill one
[1:00:24] left one taken
[1:00:26] and then of course we know 1
[1:00:27] Thessalonians 5 uh the day comes as a
[1:00:30] thief in the night right the Rapture
[1:00:32] comes as a thief in the night the world
[1:00:34] won't be looking for it the foolish
[1:00:36] Virgin uh necessarily won't be looking
[1:00:38] for it it'll be the the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:40] Christ looking for
[1:00:41] it now currently what's interesting the
[1:00:44] Wikipedia says Uh there's only two to
[1:00:46] four million message Believers so if we
[1:00:50] apply it to that only two or four would
[1:00:52] go in the Rapture one out of a million
[1:00:54] but brother Adam uh he used that he used
[1:00:57] all of Catholicism to get his number of
[1:00:59] 500 million and all of his um
[1:01:03] Protestants so Catholicism plus plus
[1:01:06] Protestants he called it Christendom
[1:01:08] which is the whole group of people that
[1:01:10] are claiming to be Christians he said
[1:01:11] 500
[1:01:12] million now I looked it up today now
[1:01:14] apparently this is from 2019 there's 2.5
[1:01:17] billion uh professors of Christianity
[1:01:20] from
[1:01:21] 2019 so one out of a million would be
[1:01:24] 2,500
[1:01:26] um so if we use that same number brother
[1:01:29] Ram's you know saying one out of a
[1:01:32] million and we know there's 8 billion
[1:01:34] people in the world today so you know
[1:01:37] 2,500 out of 8 billion would be a very
[1:01:40] very small
[1:01:43] number so uh we know uh the Holy Ghost
[1:01:46] filled uh bride will be in the Rapture
[1:01:48] she'll be a small group uh Jesus said
[1:01:51] few there be that find the narrow road
[1:01:52] that even leads to salvation but even a
[1:01:55] fewer uh fewer amount of people will go
[1:01:58] in the rapture we know that and also we
[1:02:00] get the type there of uh interesting we
[1:02:04] with the type of the the the foolish
[1:02:05] vergins right uh five wise five foolish
[1:02:07] so we get a we get a 50% right uh but of
[1:02:11] course that's not a specific number but
[1:02:13] you get a point not everyone who claims
[1:02:15] to uh hear the bridegroom coming hear
[1:02:19] the Rapture call not everyone uh is
[1:02:22] going to be ready for it only a certain
[1:02:25] group who have extra oil are going to be
[1:02:27] ready for it so we get that lesson we
[1:02:29] want to take that lesson we want to make
[1:02:30] sure our lives have the oil of the Holy
[1:02:33] Spirit and of course that's power it's a
[1:02:35] change life um It's Supernatural signs
[1:02:38] wonders and miracles we're thankful for
[1:02:39] the testimonies we've had these last few
[1:02:41] months of God healing people and even uh
[1:02:44] hearing our humble prayers you know with
[1:02:45] certain situations in the church God
[1:02:47] being very gracious and merciful to us
[1:02:49] and even that Wednesday night where we
[1:02:51] spoke uh we spoke to the evil spirit you
[1:02:54] we we rebuke Satan and ask uh God to
[1:02:56] restore something there in the church
[1:02:58] and God heard us the very next day so
[1:03:00] again we're just thankful for the grace
[1:03:01] of God that God would allow us to speak
[1:03:04] his word and uh and God would honor it
[1:03:07] of course it all lines up with God's
[1:03:08] perfect will not our will we don't speak
[1:03:09] things by our own will only by the will
[1:03:11] of God but again we also have to know
[1:03:14] that the bride will have the right
[1:03:15] Doctrine 2 John 1 ver9 whosoever
[1:03:18] transgress this and abideth not in the
[1:03:20] doctrine of Christ hath not God he that
[1:03:22] abideth in doctrine of Christ he hath
[1:03:24] both the father and the son so surely
[1:03:27] the bride will have the right Doctrine
[1:03:28] she'll have power of the spoken word
[1:03:30] she'll have the uh the character she
[1:03:32] have the love of God as well that's an
[1:03:35] important part of this uh character of
[1:03:37] the Bride of Jesus
[1:03:39] Christ okay one more quote here I'm
[1:03:41] sorry I'll do two more quotes and then
[1:03:43] we'll be finish up here uh the last time
[1:03:46] brother man mentions the raptures in
[1:03:47] leadership this is the last full sermon
[1:03:49] before uh he passed away he has one
[1:03:51] recording after that but it's just like
[1:03:53] his uh instructions on communion a
[1:03:55] shorter I think it's 35 or 40 minutes if
[1:03:57] I'm not mistaken so leadership is
[1:03:59] actually the last full sermon and so
[1:04:02] let's just hear what's the last thing
[1:04:03] brother Brown said about the Rapture
[1:04:04] when he used the word
[1:04:06] rapture he's closing the sermon he says
[1:04:08] while we have our heads
[1:04:10] bowed I want to ask you a question do
[1:04:13] you really look at yourself to God and
[1:04:15] do you feel that you're not where you
[1:04:16] ought to be at this hour cause because
[1:04:18] the Rapture could happen at any time see
[1:04:20] It'll
[1:04:22] come he said I made the statement a
[1:04:24] while ago
[1:04:26] there only be about 500 people in the
[1:04:27] Rapture that's living they'll be changed
[1:04:29] why taking all chrisom together Catholic
[1:04:31] and all there's only 500 million people
[1:04:33] see claims Christianity and one out of a
[1:04:36] million would be 500 people there's not
[1:04:38] there's that many people missing every
[1:04:39] day across the world they can't even
[1:04:41] account for them so see It'll come you
[1:04:43] won't even know it people go on
[1:04:44] preaching See it'll all be
[1:04:46] passed then he uses the scripture where
[1:04:49] the disciples said isn't Elijah supposed
[1:04:51] to come and Jesus said he's already come
[1:04:52] and you didn't know it that's speaking
[1:04:54] of John the Baptist but of course he
[1:04:55] said Elijah shall come and restore All
[1:04:57] Things We believe that was the ministry
[1:04:59] of God's Prophet brother
[1:05:01] Brandon so he says if you know you're
[1:05:03] not right with God and you like to be
[1:05:05] remembered to God that God would set
[1:05:07] your heart right with him would you just
[1:05:09] humbly now in this very still moment
[1:05:11] raise your hands I don't care who you
[1:05:13] are would you do it you'll say I'll
[1:05:15] raise my hands to God God bless you God
[1:05:17] bless
[1:05:18] you he said I ask in Christ's name he
[1:05:21] says are you looking into the mirror of
[1:05:22] God's word so that's what the Book of
[1:05:24] James says uh God's word is a mirror so
[1:05:27] we look into the word of God we see what
[1:05:28] kind of lives we should live and we
[1:05:30] shouldn't forget that when we take our
[1:05:32] eyes off the Bible go about our day we
[1:05:34] should remember we're Holy Ghost filled
[1:05:35] Christians we should believe God's word
[1:05:37] we should uh call out cry out to God in
[1:05:40] prayer that God would Minister to the
[1:05:42] needs of the body of Christ around the
[1:05:44] world or whoever uh we're in contact
[1:05:46] with by the grace of God now the last
[1:05:48] quote I want to read
[1:05:50] um is brother Ram's word to the church
[1:05:58] I was praying this morning and this
[1:05:59] quick quote kind of came to my mind so
[1:06:01] I'm at I'm at 45 minutes here so that's
[1:06:04] good time
[1:06:06] there so brother R told this to the
[1:06:08] church it's at towards the beginning of
[1:06:10] his sermon Christ The Mystery of God
[1:06:11] revealed I don't know if you remember
[1:06:12] Saints but uh Jim schum read this to us
[1:06:15] uh two novembers ago in 2013 when he was
[1:06:18] here preaching you know I've heard him
[1:06:20] many times use this quote over the years
[1:06:23] such an encouragement but let's listen
[1:06:24] to this here as we finish up here love
[1:06:26] one another above everything love one
[1:06:27] another no matter what the devil tries
[1:06:29] to say now you're all one great big
[1:06:32] sweet group now but remember my warning
[1:06:34] see Satan won't let that stay that way
[1:06:36] no sir he'll shoot everything if he has
[1:06:39] to bring somebody in to make him his
[1:06:40] Target he'll bring some critic or
[1:06:42] unbeliever in and sit him down and cause
[1:06:44] him to fellowship with you under the
[1:06:46] quietness and things and then he'll
[1:06:48] shoot that guy with some kind of a
[1:06:49] poison stuff and he'll start through the
[1:06:51] church with it don't you take sides with
[1:06:54] it don't you have nothing to do with it
[1:06:55] with anything else talking about
[1:06:56] criticism right we talked about how that
[1:06:59] was one of the spirits that battled the
[1:07:01] the Church of Corinth it's the one that
[1:07:03] I think battled our church the most so I
[1:07:06] preached on love recently with we can
[1:07:08] understand all the Mysteries but do we
[1:07:09] have charity so I thought this would be
[1:07:10] a good thing as I was praying this kind
[1:07:12] of came to me this morning so I just
[1:07:13] want to read
[1:07:14] it don't have nothing to do with it
[1:07:16] anything else you stay right loving and
[1:07:19] sweet and kind to one another pray for
[1:07:21] that man that he'll be saved too or that
[1:07:23] woman whoever it is just pray for them
[1:07:24] and stick with one another and stay with
[1:07:27] your pastor see he's the shepherd and
[1:07:29] you give him respects he'll lead you
[1:07:31] through because he's ordained of God to
[1:07:32] do
[1:07:33] so now do you remember that you said the
[1:07:36] enemy will come and when he does just
[1:07:38] cling that much closer together and the
[1:07:41] one that the devil is using for an enemy
[1:07:43] will either get out or come in and be
[1:07:46] one of you that's all so that's what we
[1:07:49] have to do we have to continue to pray
[1:07:51] together stick stick together through
[1:07:52] hard times you know Satan's not going to
[1:07:53] let everything remain happy and joyful
[1:07:56] and and uh Victory all the time uh God
[1:08:00] has to allow us to be tested any church
[1:08:01] that's not being tested is not a true
[1:08:02] church so just something to keep in mind
[1:08:04] about the love of God don't never Clan
[1:08:07] among or talk or make yourself clannish
[1:08:09] we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm
[1:08:12] mad at you I'm going to take you away
[1:08:14] because you're not a right hand he's my
[1:08:16] left hand I want him to stay there even
[1:08:18] the little tip of my finger I want to
[1:08:19] stay right there every little part of my
[1:08:21] body stay right there and God wants us
[1:08:23] as a body Believers to stay right
[1:08:25] exactly with one another right at with
[1:08:27] one another and now you've got tapes on
[1:08:30] that you've got tapes on what we believe
[1:08:32] you got tapes on discipline the church
[1:08:33] how we behave oursel in the Church of
[1:08:35] God how we come together and sit
[1:08:37] together in Heavenly places don't stay
[1:08:39] home if God is in your heart you can't
[1:08:41] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[1:08:44] yonder good reminder there if God's in
[1:08:46] our hearts we want to be with the Saints
[1:08:48] I know snow keeps us away from that on a
[1:08:50] night like this but hopefully it
[1:08:51] motivates us we should have good weather
[1:08:54] at least on the weekends we can gather
[1:08:55] together on Sunday we ought to be really
[1:08:57] motivated and really excited through the
[1:08:58] love of God to be together again uh next
[1:09:01] time we can
[1:09:03] gather I'll read that again if God is in
[1:09:05] your heart you can't hardly wait for
[1:09:06] them doors to open out yonder to get in
[1:09:08] here to fellowship with your brothers if
[1:09:10] you don't feel that way then I tell you
[1:09:12] it's time you got to pray and so see so
[1:09:15] see prayer makes you love your brother
[1:09:16] and sisters forgive them pray for them
[1:09:18] want to spend time with it because we're
[1:09:21] in the last days where the Bible exalted
[1:09:23] or exhorted us to much more as we see
[1:09:26] that day approaching to love one another
[1:09:28] with Christian love and divine love to
[1:09:30] assemble ourselves together in Heavenly
[1:09:32] places in Christ Jesus and to love one
[1:09:36] another this will all men know you are
[1:09:38] my disciples when you have love love one
[1:09:40] for another that's right stay right
[1:09:42] together if the brother you think he's a
[1:09:44] little wrong or the sister say Lord
[1:09:46] don't let me never have that root of
[1:09:48] bitterness spring up because it'll
[1:09:50] affect him and it'll take the Christ
[1:09:52] right out of my life so that's again but
[1:09:54] Rams emphasizing in critical Spirits
[1:09:56] bitterness can't let any of that get in
[1:09:58] our lives it takes the Christ right out
[1:10:00] of our minds appear that poison acids he
[1:10:04] calls it of malice and jealousy and
[1:10:07] hatred that will just take the Holy
[1:10:08] Spirit right away from you it will run
[1:10:11] him from the Tabernacle here or bride of
[1:10:14] Christ Fellowship here it'll kill the
[1:10:16] spirit of God or drive it away from here
[1:10:18] hurt your pastor it'll do everything see
[1:10:20] don't you do that you just wax that much
[1:10:24] closer together
[1:10:26] draw up take the Buckle as the brother
[1:10:28] testified and a minister here the other
[1:10:29] night about having the Buckle seeing in
[1:10:31] the vision just take the buckles on the
[1:10:33] whole armor of
[1:10:35] God just pull her on tighten up and move
[1:10:39] right up close to one
[1:10:40] another love one another anyhow talk
[1:10:43] nice about one another say things say
[1:10:45] nice things about one another and then
[1:10:47] God will bless you so church I just want
[1:10:49] to read that may God bless you we're
[1:10:51] going to call Malachi to the piano here
[1:10:53] let's have a word of Prayer so let's uh
[1:10:56] let's ask what brother random asked do
[1:10:58] we feel like we're ready for the Rapture
[1:10:59] do we feel like our heart is right with
[1:11:02] God is there anything in our life that
[1:11:03] we think uh might hinder our walk with
[1:11:06] god let's take a few moments here
[1:11:08] tonight and examine ourselves we're so
[1:11:10] thankful for this message on the Rapture
[1:11:11] what a beautiful message uh from God's
[1:11:14] Prophet uh brother Ram so so so much
[1:11:16] applies to our lives today even prophecy
[1:11:19] like I said he repeated that prophecy
[1:11:20] about Los Angeles in there so many
[1:11:23] things about uh the future the Rapture
[1:11:26] and even the scoffers the scoffing
[1:11:28] condition of this day oh how could there
[1:11:29] be a Rapture how could God ever change
[1:11:32] bodies in the moment twinkle of an eye
[1:11:34] because he's God he spoke this whole
[1:11:36] universe into existence if he created it
[1:11:39] he can redeem it he can call for it um
[1:11:42] nothing is too hard for our god so let's
[1:11:46] examine our hearts here as we
[1:11:48] pray let's bow our our our heads here
[1:11:51] and close our eyes and I'm going to do
[1:11:53] like brother brandom if you feel
[1:11:56] you're not ready and you want to be
[1:11:57] ready you feel like there's anything you
[1:11:59] need to make right there in the privacy
[1:12:01] of your home just lift your hand to God
[1:12:03] and say God I don't feel like I'm ready
