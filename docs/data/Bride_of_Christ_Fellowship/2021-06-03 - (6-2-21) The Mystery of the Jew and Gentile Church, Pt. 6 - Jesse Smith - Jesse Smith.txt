all of you very much uh you know cam invited us out he's like he said you need to talk to your church get a time come camp out at brother mike so brother mike has 20 acres right and there's woods and everything a pond he's like you need to invite your church out sometime and everybody come out i said let's i appreciate that that's quite a it's quite a drive force i don't like camping out either so i'm like well how can we all rent campers that have showers and running water that's my i have to work on that this summer [Laughter] [Music] but it was really sweet of them you know they uh you know cam loves coming here simon loves coming here uh and so i just want to let you know they missed you all and uh they want to invite everybody out so i said well we'll see what happens i don't know how it's possible might be easier for them to actually come to our church no just joke uh ephesians 3 let's see here get down to the word of god i'm just so happy to see everybody and uh we surely missed you had some wonderful services we had a youth meeting on saturday night and then uh just a regular service on sunday morning some really nice testimonies uh just people needing prayer and rededicating their lives so lord it was a really nice weekend there ephesians 3 uh i'll read verse four and five and then we'll all read verse six okay so i'll read four and five by myself and then we'll read verse six together then we'll go to psalm 19. verse four says whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto us holy apostles and prophets by the spirit let's read verse six together ready one two three that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel amen let's go to psalm 19 here psalm 19 that will take a few prayer requests i am going to be very careful all the time now but they know what time you got to be out by 8 30 yeah okay so maybe a little earlier psalm 19. i've been aiming for 8 to 8 15 for a while now i would like to think many of those i hit but based upon everybody's laughing laughing uh but i i i honestly feel like i've hit him pretty good i guess the ones have to take data i know for sure last week we were out at 8 15. i know that for sure i remember right you know it's a joke but it's true i mean we just enter into heavenly places right and then when you start thinking about the holy spirit and all god's done for you like it's so hard to just i mean you don't you don't think about closing you know uh so you know we laugh about it but it's so true you just enter into another realm you know the spiritual mind that mind is christ that's what the bible says we have the mind of christ so it's just a joy to enter that mind as often as possible at least three times a week that's a real blessing and of course numerous times throughout the week as well psalm 19. let's go there beautiful scripture here let's read verses 13 and 14 all of us together on three one two three keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer praise god just remain standing just for a moment just want to announce brother cam uh his wife julia had the baby today on genevieve's birthday so it's genevieve's birthday today let's give her a round of applause god bless you genevieve want to show everybody your three she had to like use two she had to use another hand to hold up three fingers so she's three today so we're so thankful for genevieve what a blessing she's been to our family uh but uh cam had another boy so now they have four boys one girl his name's judah michael smith judah michael smith they're really hoping for a girl that god has a way god has a plan and we're thankful for that but poor uh shouldn't say poor but you know sad briella you know go out to pray for her but let's do keep uh you know julia in prayer she recovers and then we saw brother mike he's the one in the wheelchair he was shot in 2009 by the cop and it was unjust but uh won the lawsuit anyways uh he's in a lot of pain he couldn't even come to the sunday morning service because he's in so much pain he gets a lot of infections so let's remember him in prayer we had we laid hands on him i fasted all day saturday and pray for him and it just he seems to say like god is allowing it to humble him and then be able to minister to other people he says here's a man in a wheelchair he says he goes into all these stores like lowe's and home depot and he prays for sick people often and they get well right there in the store and yet god keeps him in that wheelchair so it's really it's really interesting how god does it many times god's strength is made perfect in our weakness but we're not going to stop praying for that brother because he's such a wonderful man of god god bless you guys good to see you buddy do you have work tonight buddy oh cause the holiday or what oh you took off okay that's right you have the week off love you buddy god bless you so now you're getting work done at home right you took work off so you can work we're joking

and jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so we'll try to preach for about 45 minutes here tonight uh by the grace of the lord and uh try to lay this little thought in so yeah we had some great services there uh saturday night i preached outside just in the woods that everybody had their you know their camp seats around and uh just preached and it was really good uh nobody came up for prayer we just prayed for brother mike because i was preaching to the young people and i kind of preached a sermon i preached last wednesday night about being an example so i went through all those six six traits where paul says you should be an example in all six of those traits uh so the people really somebody told me afterwards he said every time you come i feel like i need to repent and get right with god i said that's good that's what the holy spirit said jesus said the holy spirit will convict you of sin so i appreciate that and then sunday morning we had a great service i think i preached for two hours and i just i said well we only have one service i'm going to preach the whole thought and a couple people came up for prayer for some serious needs there and we just put our faith in the lord one was like a marriage need and another one was actually a couple in fornication and i told them they need to separate you know they can't live like that and then the cam would guide them and things like that so it was really great they both were weeping and crying and praising the lord it was just a really wonderful atmosphere there and uh just i think i preached on uh only be strong and very courageous on sunday morning so i preached that joshua series and then i ended that thought with the best is yet to come i finished with that thought because that's what it is the best is yet to come praise god we're just gonna say like this we're just getting started jesus is just getting started in our lives praise god each stage is always gonna get better praise god because we're going to see the fruits of all of our labors down through the years like you know we look at how malachi lydia and our our older ones have grown up and look look at the gifts in their lives and the sweet spirits that they have and the love for god they have i think wow i really wouldn't want to go back now although i do miss those great younger years you know but it's true god makes every stage better than the last i even had some grandparents sitting up there i said is that right grandparents and they said amen they said being a grandparent was better than even being a parent because there's no greater joy than to see your children and grandchildren walking the truth so we just had a wonderful time and then we had a minister's meeting right after the service and that was good we just talked about the seven thunders it was really nice uh ministers mean drove home got home about 9 15 on sunday night so thank you for your prayers it was a wonderful time in the lord so let's look here i'll try to set my timer here let's maybe try about 45 minutes i'll try by the grace of the lord and we'll look to this thought here tonight i do believe that's all the announcements we don't really have any special meetings to the end of the month and i think i'm just going to preach all those and we'll do like a song service one of those and like a testimony meaning just with our church and then for july i'm trying to get brother randy out here i talked to him on the phone yesterday i could hear the planes flying over because he was on break you know at the airport or what yeah the airport or he's an air traffic control guy and he's like okay i'll send you some dates so i'm still waiting on the dates he's going to send me some dates in august or september but i told him my brother dick's coming we have brother dick's coming in september for labor day so he'll preach a friday saturday sunday so just kind of keep maybe mark that in your minds i'm really excited to have him it's been a couple years since we've had him so i'm really looking forward to having brother dig so i'm trying to get brother randy for july uh i think i'll take a break for august because i like to take a break every other month and then i'll try to get brother brooks and brother cam maybe for october or november i want to try to get them up here and i'll be like having brother simon come in from time to time because he lives so close and it's not he don't have to get a hotel you know it's not expensive for him to come and uh we can have enough finances for the church and everything so trying to do that and uh i just try to balance everything by the grace of the lord so okay enough on that let's get to the word of god here so we've been looking at this thought this is part six on this mystery now to us church this is not very uh mysterious but it would have been in the days of the bible days because there was a major segregation right there's a major segregation between jew and everybody else god's people were a holy priesthood and they didn't have any they tried not to have any contact with gentile or samaritan right they don't want any contact with them because it would defile them and make them unclean so today we kind of see the fruits of this mystery because we have caucasian asian black we have like a great variety today and we counted a joy we counted a privilege but if you were a jew you couldn't enjoy that if you're still under the old covenant because you would say well these gentiles they they eat that they eat that they eat pork and all these things but it's such a joy we're seeing the fruits of all paul's laborers today amen two thousand years later we got a bouquet bride here amen it's just beautiful to see that we are we're the fruits of all paul's labors remember they didn't know this for ages and generations abraham was 1500 years before christ and that was really when they started the separation right so for 1500 years it was always worth more holy physically we can't have any fellowship unless you go through all this process but then after peter saw the vision three times the sheet came down he said not so lord and after he seen the holy ghost fall he said who was i that i could withstand let's not call filthy what god has cleansed praise god amen and that satisfied every holy ghost filled person amen hallelujah so anyone that's born again today will be satisfied well as long as you have an experience like the day of pentecost welcome in you're a part of god's family amen as long as you've acted like that as long as you've lived like you've been touched by the holy spirit and you have the fire of god dwelling in you welcome to the family amen that's why we say welcome to this church as long as you're bored again praise god if you're not you'll get born again if you stay long enough amen by faith we believe that because if you sit around the fire long enough praise god it's going to burn you up it's going to consume you because our god is a consuming fire amen that's right it's true church that's the reality and so we're thankful that we live in this day where we can see how god has brought together every nationality and this right here is a foretaste of heaven this is a just like the holy ghost baptism is a down payment that's like a foretaste of the full payment praise god so is our fellowship with every creed when i create every color uh every nation every tongue it's a it's a conglomeration it's a blending together it's a weaving together or building together of a family of god and god has all all families of all nations everybody together everybody in one accord and they're all worshiping him praise god hallelujah so we're thankful now go to ephesians 2 uh paul gives us two images of what this looks like one is a physical human body and then the other is a temple so paul gives us uh these two illustrations and i just thought of something i'm just looking up real quick maybe i can show a picture years and years ago i had this uh it's been probably four or five years here so why are you turning the ephesians 2 maybe i can pull that up there uh you might remember it yeah there it is uh so can you pull this up here real quick can you switch over to my phone this is just a artist rendition of the inscription we'll get to this in a moment on the temple you might remember this when i preached on this why is that so tiny okay that's better yeah that's better now you can't read that i can't read it either but we'll get to in just a moment now in ephesians 2 the first 10 verses of ephesians 2 are some of the most memorable and beautiful verses in the bible so let's have some readers there lydia malachi can you get those and then we'll go to nature so lydia uh malachi why don't you start ephesians 2 since you got your bible there sorry i didn't mean this i'm just always surprising my children so it's gonna you'll see it'll help you later on in life you know like whenever somebody surprises you you'll be okay that's normal my dad always surprises me i guess i'm just so happy i'm gonna laughing a lot tonight ephesians two lydia can you do one through five then maokai six through ten please yes is amen is that beautiful some of the most beautiful language in the new testament is about this mystery because just like the gentiles were they were cut off from the hebrew the hebrew religion so paul says we were all dead but jesus has come around and raised up a dead body amen praise god we were most of us have never seen that i've never seen resurrection as far as that way uh my we have some friends that have brother brooks and brother craig and different ones have seen the dead you know shortly after they died come back to life oh yeah you've seen it thanks to the hospital right uh you're with your dad right he passed away but then they they brought him back right is that right did they shock him [Music] on the ambulance was that right okay okay i thought well maybe i gotta confuse sorry about that yeah the ambulance okay thank you and uh so paul gives illustration you were dead and you were walking on a course of wrath so the path you were walking on was leading to god's wrath but jesus came along and raised you up from the dead and put you on a path of grace amen so you're walking on a path of wrath and now you're on a path of grace here and he says god did this because he was rich in mercy and he had great love for you praise god so see we have so much to be thankful for tonight it was god's great love that pulled us off of the path of wrath and onto the path of grace amen it's his love that did that we were dead in sins and he's rich in mercy with great love amen some of the most beautiful language and he's talking about us he's talking about gentiles that were headed for hell but by god's grace and his mercy now we're headed to heaven amen what a blessing praise god amen malachi 6 to 10. now remember i like verse 10 we are his workmanship he's still working on us so go ahead maokai six to for ten things through faith is the gift of god not at work so we are his partnership created in christ amen praise god beautiful so see that's what we're talking about verse 6 he's we're in heavenly places many times right that's why we can't think about the things of the world we can't meditate on them too long because we feel ourselves coming out of those heavenly places right and we've got to get back to the word back to the wonderful things of god right that's why we lose track of time it's because of heavenly places praise god right and then now look in the ages that come he's going to i remember i ended the sermon on this a while back he's going to take ages and show us his great grace for ages right think about that we live our lives you know we spent you know what 20 or 30 years listen to preaching you know me i was raised in church so 40 years but that's just one lifetime but we're going to spend ages thinking about his exceeding rich grace and kindness oh my i can't wait to experience it i want to see all god's kindness to paul i want to see when he was shipwrecked three times and saved each time i want to see that i want to see we're going to go through all the kindness all that he showed to peter right peter paul and peter up out of the water that's why we like sight and sound it kind of gives us a preview of what that's going to be like got to give us a little preview and jonah on the belly of a whale think about it's going to take ages for god to show us all of his kindness all the great things he's done no this fellow sleep didn't okay sorry and the church we're looking forward to that this is what the scripture says so his grace is so amazing it's going to take years and years and years to really fully understand all that he's done for us amen oh god what a blessing and we're saved by grace no man will be able to boast on that day and say well i saved myself jesus no man can boast for salvation praise god right because we know for salvation it's all by grace now we know there's a judgment seat of christ where rewards are given out that's where we're not we're not boasting on what we've done but we're actually saying lord here's what i've done right like the man with five he said i invested i've got five more so see there will be a judgment where we get to show the lord now he already knows but we get to say in front of the saints here's what i did for you lord now that doesn't save us but it shows we were faithful with the assignment we listened to god's assignment we read the instructions we kept it we invested in it and lord here's what we've done for you praise god amen but we will always remember that we didn't start with that talent god gave us that talent praise god the talent was god's to begin with amen praise god so we know reason to brag it's just me lord you gave me this five i invested in it and look it brought back five more praise god but see there'll be no bragging on that day on either day praise god especially not for salvation now the bible said you're god's workmanship which means a product or a fabric a thing that is made you're a product of god god has made you like a fabric he's weaved your life together the bible said he's woven you in your mother's womb amen hallelujah he's weaved you together in your mother's womb and he's created you for something like lily bought fabric the other day right and she started cutting it she's making this little dress for a 4-h project i saw her cutting it she got the pattern and got it all that's what god did but man said all of humanity was a pat or was this fabric but you were the bride part amen so the part that lydia's keeping that's us amen i don't know we're the part god wants to use amen he's got certain works that he's gonna have us do praise god where's workmanship we're a part of his family praise god we were dead but now we're alive in christ jesus amen we were dead up on the shelf but god has pulled us down off the shelf and he's he's measured out the pattern this is what i want for my lair laodicean church age bride amen he's gonna look like this from akron and and from albion and and napoleon and all these patterns i'm cutting them out i'm gonna use them and make a big beautiful demonstration of my power amen i'm glad to be a part of that praise god you are god's workmanship you're god's fabric and he wants to do something with you he's weaving your life he's i'll say this he's woven you in your mother's womb but he's weaving the events of your life together to bring out a testimony like i shared your testimony on sunday sister naomi i hope that was okay remember you last couple sundays ago you're in the car there and you were saying how you were so thankful you could come to a church where you'd have to worry about what clothes you wore well i shared that at cam church and that was the highlight of the sermon sister started screaming and praising the lord that was the highlight so thank you for sharing that that was when the most people were screaming and crying and praising the lord because they must have experienced some type of you know in other churches they've been to they've experienced that denominational thing where the rich are better than the poor right where church isn't about jesus it's about your clothes or it's about your group that you're in but here at our church there's only one group and that's the jesus group amen praise god and there's no difference between our incomes or anything like that we got all things in common praise god and i say like this i'll say it again if you lack anything let me know if you lack anything we should have enough to take care of it praise god now we all got we all got uh debts we got to pay well most of us maybe not all of us i'm almost done with one of them but i just got two more but you know we all got things we have to take care of but if the bible said they had all things in common so that means enough food shelter and everything like that if someone doesn't have that they need to let me know so i can help them out but i trust the holy spirit will help us to well will make me known as well as well the holy spirit will help me know what the people need if there's anyone that lacks anything so see we're thankful for that we're we're not interested in the human things we're interested in everybody loving each other being free in the holy spirit for where the spirit lord is there's liberty amen amen that was very highlight sister of the service where the most people were up shouting and praising the lord it seemed like that really meant a need there where people were thankful for the freedom of the holy spirit amen a great blessing that was for sure uh so you are god's fabric god is gonna weave events of your life together for a testimony like that queen of the south her life was just weaved together she had to know that idols don't talk to you and she had to hear then about solomon she had to travel across the desert that was the very fabric of her testimony god was weaving that together because he's going to use that testimony against those in jesus day who wouldn't even travel across the county to hear the preaching but she traveled across the desert amen and jesus said that queen of the south shall judge you praise god because a greater than solomon is here amen see her life had to be weaved together where she had to have this major obstacle but she had to overcome it and god is going to use that uh because she was god's workmanship god's going to use that on the day of uh judgment so if my hardest thing in life is i have a big family and i have a small church and i get criticized a lot and i get rejected if that's my biggest trial so far praise god let it be then god's gonna use me on the day of judgment for people that had excuses well our church was too small or my family was too big they're gonna use all these excuses god's gonna need somebody to raise up who overcame praise god i'll be happy to be one of those overcomers amen in other words we won't let any excuse keep us from doing god's will for our lives amen hallelujah there's going to be no excuses church there's no excuses for us you know i heard a good thought let me just share this in acts 17 the bible said god has determined the bound of your habitation that you might seek after him and feel after him and worship him that means god is determined everywhere where every person was ever going to live so that means and then the bible said the eyes of the lord run to and fro around the entire earth to find someone that would fear the lord in other words and this thought came to me there's going to be no one on the day of judgment that could say well god didn't god didn't seek after me it's going to be impossible because god's going to tell him no i placed you here so you can hear from this missionary or i place you here so i can show you a dream or a vision god is positionally placed all of us that means church we were meant to be together praise god amen god has determined the bounds of your habitation if god wanted you somewhere else you would have been somewhere else that helped us that helps us to be content praise god paul said one thing i've learned is to be content right content with our lot in life and then in our lot in life invest everything we got for jesus all the gifts all the tales just give jesus everything we got be an overcomer and god will weave together the story of our life to be a witness for the believers and against the unbelievers on the day of judgment i wonder how many people our family is going to condemn if that had abortions well we had too many kids we had to have an abortion god will raise this up say well we could do it i was a middle i was a middle class person i didn't have millions of dollars you know we get hand-me-downs for some of the kids you know what's wrong with that nothing's wrong with that that's no excuse to take a life see i wonder how many you think about your life many of the struggles you've been through like brother amen you've been kicked out of your house so god's going to raise up people that they got kicked out and they fell away but you're going to be an overcomer despite being kicked out i fell right in the hands of jesus you might have got kicked out of your natural house but god let you in the house amen the house of faith hallelujah and you can see that with everybody's like i said on the the the youth service my dad left me but instead i got three dads simon cam and sam that's how i looked at it after my dad left i really got three dads because they would wrestle with me fight with me you know whatever we'd share clothes you know we'd wrestle and argue and you know we play together too you know but it depends it all depends how you look at it there's no reason to ever walk away from god because god wants to use that as a testimony to turn it around like why am i so far away from my family why is naomi so far away from her family like we miss our family terribly we're only three hours away she's a whole ocean away from her family well there's got to be a reason for that there is she's got to overcome that we've got to overcome that we've got to overcome feeling alone but there's something god wants us to do now the opposite is like perry green perry green when he was growing up he never had a steady home because his parents were in the military so his dad he said he was never into school longer than six months his whole life six months he never even finished his school year so he was just used to traveling but then that fit him later in life when after brother adam left he passed her for a while but then he spent the last few decades of his life just traveling around the world from place and he he said i never met a stranger because as a child he just meet new friends make he knew how to make friends so god made him a missionary now after being a pastor so see you you could you could feel bad for yourself well i never really got to make any friends or you can take the opposite and just everybody becomes your friend you see we you see god is weaving our lives he's working something in you praise god he's working a certain kind of a testament i feel good tonight praise god i feel thankful that god is working in our lives amen we're the very fabric of his ministry right of his life we're the fabric that he's weaving together to form this great flag or this great banner of christianity can i say like that ma well verse 11 wherefore remember that ye being in the times past gentiles in the flesh who are called to uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time now look at this church look how low we were look at verse 12. this is this really brings us in a humble condition here that at that time ye were without christ can you imagine where you'd be without christ you would have filthy minds filthy lives no holiness no judgment no i mean you just let anything come that comes instead of shutting the door to satan you just let satan in more and more where would you be i told the church i'd probably be addicted to drugs i'd be a thug with those sports jerseys on with my hat sideways and living still at my mom's house playing video games smoking and drinking and that's what i beat can you imagine but look what grace has done for me praise god what grace has done amen i've been living with my friends you know five four or five friends living together lord knows what else i would have been awful things that's the only thing as i could mention probably what i would have been doing because of sin but look you were without christ you're aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise you had no promises you had no hope and without god in the world can you imagine many people walk through this entire life this entire life without any hope we were without hope now don't get me wrong we said earlier god is searching and trying to encourage he's still striving with man he's trying to give them hope now i even believe this i believe god can use some of those uh televangelist preachers sometimes to just give people hope just some hope right now if they really love god they'll want more of god and they just they won't stop with that but there's a lot of testimonies they have of they just offer hope that there's hope in jesus there's hope there's there's a possibility of things changing oh my hallelujah the bible said there's such possibilities the bible said the early apostles turned the world upside down praise god in other words jesus can turn your entire world upside down praise god things will fall out of place and they'll just get all uh seemingly completely different that's what he does he just changes the entire scene amen when he comes into a life he changes it upside down praise god from darkness to from no hope from hopeless to hopeful we have a great hope church we have a great hope you probably know this most churches are still believing for a revival i'm talking about denominational most churches are still believing for a nationwide revival they're hoping for that but our hope's not in that our only hope is in the rapture praise god praise god because we know judgment's on the way 60 million abortions and that's that's that's just abortion what about all the murders and everything else going on and the drug addiction and the adulteries and the abominations that's just one avenue we know judgment's coming and so they have a false hope but we have a hope the hope is the return of the messiah the snatching away of his wife amen to rescue her from the judgment of the trumpets and the vials thank god he's going to rescue his wife amen she's not appointed around but she's appointed to salvation through jesus christ amen hallelujah but the world has no hope because they've turned down hope they've turned down god they've turned down the promises but what did what did it verse 13 blood did it but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ amen amen hallelujah afar off we were way far away from the promises but now we're brought nigh to jesus and that's why i put that picture up there i think i'll finally get to that you probably remember verse 14 says he's our peace he's broken down one and has broken down the middle wall partition between us so this was the inscription on herod's temple they had the gentile court then the court of the jewish women then the court of the men and then the holy place and the holiest of holies and herod's temple so this was the inscription right right before you entered in the court of the jewish women and the inscription says any gentile that enters in will be immediately killed right so any gentile living in the days of jesus they saw this that's as far as they could go right so when jesus taught on solomon's porch i believe it was in the court of the women further in so the gentiles couldn't hear him teaching there and it was death so they looked up this and said it's death for a gentile to come in there can you imagine a gentile that really loved god that's as this is as close as they could get they could come up here and they could try to listen in and hear jesus talking that's as close as they could get to god as they possibly could they were just trying to get close to the promises but then jesus comes around he sheds his blood and says it is finished praise god and the bible said the blood of christ broke down this middle wall so spiritually the wall came down and the love of god flooded out to them praise god amen the mercy of god was kept in but when jesus died it's as if the walls fell down and grace came in like a flood amen everybody could receive it then everybody could worship god praise god because the blood tore down the middle wall partition there's no difference between jew and gentile from asian and caucasian and african there's no difference we're all one blood we're all one faith we're all bought by the one blood jesus is blood amen the one blood paid for all of our sins we all fall short of the glory of god no matter the skin color so it's not about the skin color it's about the blood of christ the red blood that was shed to pardon us and forgive all of our transgressions it's not about skin color it's about blood color praise god it's the red blood of jesus christ that was shed isn't it isn't your blood blue when it's in your body is that right they always say it's blue but when it hits the oxygen on the outside then it turns red because i think sometimes you can see blue blue veins right so that proves it's okay that's what they say i'm not very smart i'm not much of a doctor you know but then when it hit the oxygen hits it then then you can see it turns red it's about the color of the blood it was shed for us praise god the red blood of jesus amen that's scarlet cord a scarlet cord praise god jesus christ broke down this middle wall of partition between the jew and gentile thank the lord for that so now church there's nobody that can say well you know and this is where message people fall short all the time well they try to make serving god mysterious like well i know things you don't know like the third poll i know things about the third pole because i'm closer to god than you are well friend the blood of jesus christ broke down the middle of all partition they make it sound like well i know things you don't know but how can you're not closer to god right if we got the holy ghost the bible said the holy ghost guides us all amen into all truth praise god but you usually find those preachers are the ones that fall into sins they act like they know something better like well i've got a closer relationship to god the bible said the blood of jesus broke all that down they did the jews did have a closer relationship to god but not anymore praise god we can all access the holiest of holies amen the bible said by prayer we enter into the holiest of homes behind the bail amen that's why the bible said our hope is anchored there praise god i've got an anchor for the amen and it's up there in heaven praise god it's opposite the anchor goes down in the earth but now the anchor goes up praise god and so while the storms are down here i'm so anchored in heaven can you see me anchored in heaven no matter how the storms toss me i'm not leaving his heart praise god i'm anchored in the holiest of holies praise god these storms won't move me out of there no matter what happens i'm still anchored no matter where i go i'm always anchored there because that's where the blood is right now that's where it was accepted in heaven that's where the high priest intercedes for me praise god amen i like that i like to act out more sometimes i like that no matter where i no matter what the devil throws at me can you imagine you just feel like sometimes you get knocked around and knocked out the devil tries to knock you out that don't change nothing you're still anchored to heaven well then talked about the chain however the chain is brother says we're hanging over hell on a chain right and that's kind of what it is it's kind of like that it's kind of you know we go through these fiery trials right peter says we go through the fiery trial of our faith but we're anchored to heaven praise god we might feel the fire sometimes hotter than others but we'll always have an anchor behind the veil glory and church this created peace with god look at verse 15 abolish in his flesh the enmity or the hatred between jew and gentile can you imagine they used to hate people church i don't hate anybody on this earth i hate their sin right and i hate my sin too but there's no there's no nation or anyone i hate but yet the jews actually hated the gentiles because they were so dirty but the bible said the blood of christ separated us from the enmity right it abolished it it did away with the hatred there's no more hatred even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for in himself of twain one new man so making peace so that's what the blood that's how you know jesus is in a church there's peace there right if there's if there's if there's division in the church you know they haven't somebody hasn't accepted jesus someone hasn't accepted the love of jesus because the love of jesus makes peace where there's hatred and division the love of god comes in there and there's unity that's true that's what the bible says creating peace verse 16 that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby my so as jesus was slain the hatred was slain can't you see that can we all see that as they hated jesus and beat him that was actually paying for the hatred that jews had on gentiles that was paying for that because the bible said that hatred was slain right all that all the judgment was placed on jesus all the hatred from gentiles and jews was put on jesus they had to hate him so he could make peace with us right all that punishment for all the hatred had to be paid for jesus paid the prize praise god jesus paid it all all to him i owe praise god it's true praise god the enmity was slain on the cross as well praise god any hatred any any hatred we have towards anyone here or anyone in our family or hopefully nobody here but if we did it was already paid for it was already slain we just must recognize that jesus made a way for that healing to take place jesus paid for healing he took the punishment for hatred and now we can be healed by the bomb of the holy spirit that's what the blood does that's why i don't have any i mean i have enemies but i don't hate them i wish the best for them brother brahm said if you enjoy thinking about someone in hell he said you need to go to the altar we don't wish anybody to go to hell we wish for them to be corrected do i hate their sin yes i hate being talked about i hate being light upon i hate how they misrepresent me i hate that but themselves the person i love them and i don't want to see them burn in hell i don't see them saved but they got to repent right just like i did just like everybody has to do so that's a great distinction we have to make now the first picture is the body did you catch that he took two men the bible said and put him in one body he said two making one new man that was in verse 15. so that was the first picture so the cross makes two men one man and one body and don't you know the bible said christ is the head of this body hallelujah christ is the head and this new body has access to god the father through the spirit hallelujah so church we must always remember that jesus is the head that's why brother and said pray every day he said pray before every decision pray before every decision that way you get the instructions from the head right before we go do something before we drive or go do something we should pray first and make sure the head approves of that praise god because we're the body christ is the head amen there's that always that echo on wednesday night i'm not sure what that is that's probably is it every service that happens so he takes two men and makes them one new man in one body christ is the head praise god i don't have much more to say on that let's look at the second pictures in verse 19. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens of the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth under a holy temple in the lord in whom he also are builded together for inhabitation of god through the spirit so that's the second picture the first picture is everybody's a part of the same body we're a part of the same body brother amen brother bang that's why i've never hurt them because they're a part of my body whatever hurt my body on purpose i wouldn't think so i treat my body pretty good i try to at least because it's really not my body it's the body of christ right he purchased it with his blood we're all part of the same body so we should be for each other we should be cheering each other on right we should in other words encouraging them right not cheering like a cheerleader you know not that kind of cheering like that's how some people say it but it's encouraging them you just stay strong in the faith you just keep believing you keep trusting god for that salvation that lost love you i appreciate your faith i appreciate your example thanks for that song special thanks for praying for me when i was sick i believe god heard your prayers you know you just try to encourage them you don't try to discourage them you try to encourage them because we're all part of the same body amen amen and christ is the head think about you know if christ is the head and think about when you're driving you got your hands doing this you got your feet on the accelerator you might have your eyes back there see we can all be doing different things kind of but we're all moving the the vehicle forward right right you might be tapping i might not be a tapper right you might be the one on the pedal you might be pushing it forward what about you could even be talking on the phone while you're doing all this it could be picking your nails you know you could be okay put on your glasses you're gonna be doing all kinds of things the body does all kinds of things but it all answers back to the head praise god hallelujah we must remember that and appreciate that that we have different callings and ministries that's what the doctrine of the nicolaitans is all about brother simon talks about he just did a bible study on that it's a two hour one it's good to listen to if you ever listen to it but the main idea is that jesus hates the doctrine of the nicolaitans and that doctrine is the antichrist spirit conquers the people where the people don't they don't feel as close to god as the preachers everybody in here should be feel born again and just as close to god as i am if not then we just need to all we need to pray and study more right because that if i get close to god that's how i do it right i pray and study and try to get kind listen to the word of god and if we don't if we feel far from god we've got to draw near to god amen but the deeds of nicholadians tries to exalt preachers above everybody else now they have high responsibility but that doesn't mean they they're closer to god in any way right or they could have some revelation we can't have but the deeds of nicolaen seeks to exalt preachers above the laity and that's not right it's not right and the example that we see today as pastors they'll leave their churches and go do evangelistic work and still get the tithes that's wrong if they're out of their church more than in their church they shouldn't be getting the tithes because they're not feeding the flock but that's not how it works in a lot of churches that's the beginning of the deeds of nicolaitan simon brought that out really well that's why i knew it was the holy spirit because preachers don't like to hear that you start stepping on preachers though that's the holy spirit right there right especially the big name guys naomi was nodding you see it all over the place so i told brother amen i said if god ever calls me to uh missionary work i'd have to resign from the pastor here you guys have to vote another pastor i go out missionary work i come back to see you if i never do that i'm not even saying i would but i sure want to do some missionary work someday i want to win souls praise god i i think everybody deserves a chance to hear what we've heard i believe that with all my heart but that's the beginning of the deeds of the nicolaitans they become above or greater than the people okay so that's just one little example there now the second example we just read it is we are all part of a temple jesus is the cornerstone so we are all we're all sitting on the work of jesus we are firmly placed right on top of jesus don't worry about falling jesus is underneath you ah your foundation cannot crack amen your foundation's uncrackable praise god it's unbreakable amen because he was alive before the foundation of the world amen he has no beginning of days nor end of life he's the chief cornerstone the eternal stone praise god amen we're not going to fall we're going to stand strong in the word yeah that cuyahoga fault falls house we had had a really bad foundation i'm glad we got out of there we got a good one now by god's grace just got to keep the water away from it praise god right and that's a lot like the church in the church we have a real solid foundation there's no cracks there's there's going to be no problem with the foundation the foundation was right jesus paul apostles john james all these men and here we are right at the top oh we're the ones that are highest up here church we're right at the coming of the lord we've got a firm foundation praise god we are a part of the church we're a part of the temple praise god this is god's house amen i'm a part of god's church praise god we're a part of it let's stand like a real church praise god oh that's glorious we are not going to fall because we have a firm foundation it's impossible and we're a habitation of the holy spirit that means god's going to work through each one of us god can work he can just flow right through this house he can just work through each one of us that's what we saw when god anointed naomi and and the sisters that helped help lydia there a few months ago wasn't that beautiful that's beautiful it wasn't me god was choosing that day to help somebody i love that praise god sometimes i could like use a little break you know all the pro knowledge there's just pressure right there's pressure to preach the word i like when god uses other people praise god yeah we we all got to find a way to be united to be used by god amen and see the bible said we grow into the dwelling place see each generation grows so listen if god tarries brother amen we're building you're you're laying the music foundation for malachi lydia the next generation because the lord terry's one day you're gonna have to hang up your guitar buddy right one day i'm have to lay that lay down my bible hand to somebody to preach if the lord tarries but see we're growing we're still growing closer to the coming of the lord i love this jesus is the cornerstone and he's the headstone praise god how can he be both well the bible tells us he's god in all and through all praise god amen he is all and he's in all praise god can i say it like this he's the corner he's a headstone and he's in every stone as well just like he's in all the parts of the body as well he's the head but he's a part of every part of the body oh it's beautiful he's the head of the body and the cornerstone i'm all right i'm almost at my 45 minutes good praise god pretty good now if you would here let's uh i think i want to close with this thought here uh we're trying to look and see which thought if you would go to first kings please first kings first king 638 if you would pull that up please yeah you can turn that off there sir i wanted to i forgot i want to look up some other pictures but that was all the one like all the time i had for oh we have a firm foundation church we're not going anywhere right you think satan's gonna blow down god's house like that little pig story and the wolf you think satan's gonna blow down the house of god the bible said he's blowing winds of doctrine do you think he's going to blow down god's house impossible let him come in like a flood let him come in like a storm the house of god stands firm jesus already said it when you build it the right way the storms come but the house stands hallelujah we're standing praise god let lies come in let all these things come in by the holy spirit we'll discern them all right we'll get the old lump out right we a few few seconds ago we preached on that we'll become a brand new not praise god we just got to get the sin out and we'll be a brand new church praise god amen that's right now first kings can you pull up first kings 6 38 38 this is a thought i'll probably just maybe i'll end with this one here well you know maybe i might have a couple more thoughts here let's see there's okay there's 45 minutes right there i'll set it for 10 more minutes okay then i'll do about 55 minutes i really try to stop at 10 minutes now this reminded me as i read this i thought jew and gentile church jew and gentile temple and the holy spirit brought to me solomon's temple solomon's temple was a foreshadowing of the jew gentile church who's it built by the son of david solomon wasn't jesus christ called the son of david who built it the son of david with those thousand wives right a thousand church members right church bride members oh it's glorious amen beautiful how long did it take to build how long did it take for salmon to build this house where his bride is gonna live huh so he was seven years building it it took seven church ages for the son of david to build this house of worship get it seven church ages seven years seven church ages and that's what he's been doing for seven church ages he laid the foundation in ephesus he laid the foundation stone he laid that and then smyrna pergamos thyratira praise god sardis philadelphia and he's putting this stone right here the laodicean stone thank god the headstone's coming too hallelujah seven years seven church ages the son of david builds the house of god but not only jews build it if you go to chapter five solomon partners with a gentile king hiram the king of tyree so both kings and both people work together to build this house of god it just wasn't jews building this house it was gentiles building the house praise god they partnered and it became a beautiful habitation of the holy spirit so much so when they dedicate it the holy spirit filled the house and the priest couldn't minister jew and gentile work together they build the son of david builds the house of god the holy ghost comes down and god dwells amongst his people church god is coming to dwell on this earth in the millennium praise god he's going to dwell with his people praise god amen there'll be no interruptions of that church service praise god thousand years of worship thousand years of total obedience yeah i'm trying to remember some scriptures on the millennium but i better not say it cause i'll probably chop it up it's been too long since i preached on it see the spiritual temple is currently under construction but it's being built by jewish and gentile hearts today oh thank you lord hallelujah i'm glad to be a part of that church church maybe we're those last few stones think about that either our generation the next generation one of these next generations they're going to be the last stones laid up but like uh like enoch's pyramid right they're just it just it's just missing the headstone but those last stones at the top they've been privileged they're the ones that are gonna see the headstone come down right now spiritually they're the ones that get to touch the headstone and the saints that are alive they're the ones that get to touch jesus at the meeting in the air amen those last words praise god that are alive and remain they'll meet the lord in the air praise god amen the dead in christ rise first though praise god it's a beautiful picture if you want to see that isn't that beautiful seven years seven church ages for jew and gentile to build this church together and then it becomes a holy habitation oh we're so thankful to be a part of it thank you great son of david for making us a part of it yeah let me just close with this this last thought in ephesians chapter 3 paul calls himself a prisoner of christ for you gentiles that he should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what's the fellowship of the mystery so paul was a loved slave to christ's will that's what we all should be love slaves his calling was to preach jesus is amazing multifaceted love to the gentiles remember the height the breadth the depth and the width of jesus's love remember there's four dimensions to it but paul he says he wants everyone to see the fellowship of the mystery now that word fellowship i preached on this a while ago means intimacy paul wants us to see the intimacy or the joint participation of the mystery so in other words this mystery allows everyone to fellowship together right we don't segregate based upon financial achievements we don't segregate based on preacher well you're not a preacher you can't join us we have a special fellowship for preachers right and cam opened up that minister's meeting to everybody that was good when we had ministers meetings here i opened up to everybody too open up to everybody just the brothers came a couple brothers came one time and they didn't come back that's fine i open up to everybody i want them to hear what the preachers are saying but this this revelation of the jew and gentile one church it makes everybody a participant in the movement of the holy spirit that means church you can come to church with just as much of a revelation as i do right that's that's the fellowship of it that's the beauty of it right like i remember when sister remember when sister marie and kevin used to come i remember that morning when marie came when she had that bleeding and she was healed she walked in here her eyes were just so happy i remember opened the door for her when she and kevin walked in she was just so happy i preached on the five identification of the true church she come right up for prayer she said as we prayed she felt that blood dry up in her but i remember like and she was staring at me the whole time and that's the time where like someone like she came to church under that participation she was anointed to receive healing that morning right i love that like i just i mean i just knew well there's something different about today i didn't know what was gonna happen cause i didn't know she had bleeding trouble but that's the fellowship of the mystery that's where she was gonna participate in the ministry by getting a touch from the holy spirit praise god amen and we can all do that praise god let's go to the scripture first corinthians 14 26 there's lots of different ways to do it like you can come with a song like many times i've seen that with brother amen he'll come and he's so happy and he's going to sing a certain song that makes him happy he'll cry i love that buddy see when you're when you're participating in the movement of the holy spirit you're anointed by the holy spirit that's the beauty of this before only jews could be anointed but now everybody can be anointed amen first corinthians 14 26 can you pull it up there hunts i don't have to have to lick it up here see we are all partaking in god's promises we all have full access to jesus christ how is it then brethren when you come together every one of you have to solve so brother amen will come with a song now that's not all he has to come with or like when sister naomi will sing a song special my wife will sing a song special they come and you can just tell like they're just ready to worship today what are they doing they come anointed with the psalm that's their part of the body they're just doing their part that's them being them right that's what they're called to do and sometimes if you see me come and preach and maybe you're tired of discouraging but yeah i'm really fiery and on fire you know i'm ready when you see me doing my part right or i pray for the sick and someone will get healed right then or later you know it was just everybody was doing their part praise god see this is the this is the fellowship of the mystery praise god we're all participants if you participate if brother amen participates we'll all get blessed by his songs because they're from god if i participate everybody leaves out of here blessed by the message if i participate now you put your own life in there maybe see i might be bringing a doctrine right a tongue right a tongue's interpretation we will have to grow into that one right but you can bring a revelation you could bring an interpretation you have to grow into that one too but that could be a dream that's right that could be a dream too let all things be done unto edifying so when you come to church you whatever you bring you come to build up the body right like one time i was at brother tim humes and we had a mighty move of the spirit in fact he looked at my wife and i after the service and him and his wife and he said that was one of the greatest services we've ever had in our 30 years of the church it was back in 2017. well the whole church was up there praying except like maybe five four or five people you remember that malachi do you remember that okay he's praying all of a sudden a sister runs up there and tries to take the mic from him and brother tim just stands there now he left the message since then but i'm not i'm not saying he's a good example now but i love him you know but it was just a good example when he was in the message that sister was trying to take the mic afterwards we talked to her he counseled her in the office and she was trying to rebuke one of her friends this girl this young girl didn't think her friend should be courting this boy and she didn't come to edify she came to tear down what's the bible saying that all things be done in the edifice and she was so out of place here's a woman she's probably she's probably this tall probably 17 or 18. she's trying to steal the mic from the man of god who's praying for all the families in the church to repent and play more tapes of brother branham that's what i preached on and now they don't even believe in brother branham that's what my message was to get all the leaven out of the house right that waters separation message but see she was trying to tear down her friend she was targeting just that one friend but the holy spirit was trying to heal the homes and get them back on the tapes and kick the tvs out of their houses in the star wars i remember i preached on star wars see that was coming to destroy the body now sometimes you got to correct the body but you could tell because she was trying to usurp authority and i always remember that because that was a great example and she repented afterwards and said yes it was out of place i was in the flesh not in the spirit but you should have saw her screaming and crying you would have thought she was under the holy spirit but she was out of order by their fruits you'll know them listen to our feet how is it bride of christ fellowship when you come together every one of you have to solve musicians can come preachers will have a doctrine right everybody can have a tongue everybody can have a revelation that's just the unveiling of god's will everyone can have an interpretation that all things be done unto edifying that's the beauty of the church i'm just going to use naomi again uh that that morning when uh we prayed for lydia there and naomi and the girls helped lydia naomi knew she was coming to church there was something she was supposed to do is that righteous see that that's a great example just like when sister uh marie she knew something was gonna happen at church that morning like see
