in your sight through that blood that was shed at Calvary let us live true to the cross let us as Jesus did pick up our cross daily and follow you Lord what a what a challenge to us father the the place of death the place of torture the plates place of extreme pain we were told to take that up and follow you forsaking everything else Lord all my lord help us our flesh is weak we want we want to see comfort and find comfort and yet Lord you're calling to us us to something higher something greater Lord less let us die to ourselves that the Spirit of Christ might live through us we ask it in Jesus name Amen god bless you all be seated I think I'm hooked up to the right one there I'm gonna look under here again not sure if it fell down but [Music] okay so as we're bringing that up and I'm gonna before we continue the message from this morning I'm going to give a little emissions update and report about what we've been doing in the Middle East the whole that's right I've been doing missions now for nine years with Iranian refugees that live in live in Turkey for whatever reason they've fled whether it be because of persecution or political reasons sorry they're living now in the country of Turkey and so this opens the opportunity for us to be able to minister to them Iran as you know is a persecuted country closed country very very difficult for Westerners to be able to get into and so Turkey is kind of a staging place for refugees from Iran from Syria and from Iraq to be able to go through there and they end up in some country in the West depending on how the UN would direct them but the people that were working with mainly is Iranians the Lord is moving amongst them we'll talk a little bit about that first Peter 1 verse 1 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to the stranger scattered throughout Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia so the word strangers there is an alien alongside so there they're not in their country of birth their country of origin they've they've left their country of origin another word we call that as a refugee ok they're seeking refuge in another country for whatever reason they're their own country it is not tolerating them anymore they can't live there openly securely with so they leave that in other word they're scattered means dispersion it simply means someone who was residing in a country that they were not one born in originally so you see here in the first church age in the Alpha Age the bride is ministering to refugees living in this areas here Pontus Galatia Cappadocia Asia and Bithynia so that's the alpha age so anybody know where these regions are so Asia Metheny iglasia Cappadocia Pontus those are all areas in modern-day Turkey and so the seven churches are in south western Turkey all the seven churches from those what we call the seven church ages are there and Galatia is a region there Cappadocia is another region methania Pontus another region what comprises Turkey so now we're in the Omega age the seventh church age and now the bride is ministering to refugees living in this same area so the Alpha and the Omega coming again and we understand that the gospel travels from east to west along with civilization look what brother Branham says here in the endtime sign seat in 1962 all you Bible readers know that what happened civilization travels from east to the west China is the oldest civilization we have civilization begin in the east its went with the Sun traveling west where is it at now the west coast if it goes any farther it's back east again see what I mean so we know the message came and it went to the west coast brother Branham there preaching the gospel on the west coast but where does that message have to go back to ultimately it's got to go back to Jerusalem so we know it's got to make its way back into Japan China Southeast Asia into the Middle East and then back to Jerusalem again and so that's what we see it's doing now people in in Iran are receiving the message people in Turkey are receiving the message and it's got to go to other Middle Eastern countries as well before it gets back to Jerusalem a little bit of information on Turkey where I've been working now for the last six years it's 99 percent Muslim refugees are welcomed and left alone regarding religion as far as the government is concerned the local people in the areas are not very receptive to Christians and especially as if there's refugees living in smaller cities they will be treated much worse because there's a there's a higher level of fanatic Islam in the smaller smaller cities and villages Turks definitely frown on evangelizing their own we've we've put some efforts into bringing the gospel to Turkish people there but in the nine years that we've been in touch with refugees there iranian refugees has just been very very few that have responded to the gospel actually just just the handful just in recent recent years have received the gospel of turks native turks government does not actively persecute Christians Magan the trouble is from the citizens of the country you might have seen recently that there was a pastor from Presbyterian Church that was in prison for three years and that was more not so much related to his Christian faith it was more related to the people that he had been caught in contact with somehow they had connected him to the so called terror network that that performed the coup to try to overthrow the government and that that man is fetch illegal and he lives in Pennsylvania now he had be exiled from the country and so I think it was part of just a plot to arrest a few Americans and see if they could trade the Americans in for this fetch illegal and they claim led the coup tried to overthrow the government but that was it pastor Andrew Brunson if you saw him and he he was released just a few months ago and actually President Trump did a tremendous job of putting pressure on the Turkish government actually went above and beyond what you could ever anticipate an American president or Secretary of State or anybody doing to put pressure on a country to get an American out of prison so really just has someone that's going into Turkey and traveling in the Middle East it makes you feel more safe and secure when you know your your your government is really fighting for you so but the that being said it wasn't really a direct connection to him being a Christian that he was put in prison was more so his connection so-called connection to the factor that Glenn terror network which I doubt was even real in the first place when he got out he said he wasn't tortured or treated bad conditions of the prison were bad but actually he was never even he was never interrogated once they never even asked him a question three years while he was in prison so anyways average citizen of Turkey views Christians as filthy so it's it's just something that you that the Iranians will hear frequently your Christians are filthy there's no logic behind it it's just their viewpoint of of someone different than themselves Turkey itself is a second world country on the verge of being a first world country you go there and there's Starbucks and Burger King and you know any fast food or restaurant that you could could imagine is there you can get Chinese food and waffles and you can't get bacon unfortunately so they try to make some kind of bacon but it's it's beef bacon it's just not the same but it's very easy to travel there once you get there it's very cheap to travel within the country food is pretty cheap accommodations as well a few thoughts on Islam was introduced by Muhammad in the 600's Quran mentions Jesus is actually more than it mentions Muhammad the titles that Jesus is given is the Word of God in the spirit of God which is a tremendous way to bridge the gap between Islam and Christianity and so obviously if they call Jesus the Word of God and the Spirit of God it's not a it's not a leap to identify him as as God so they teach that Jesus and Mary are the only two people in history born without sin so even they have sort of a Catholic view point towards Mary they say Jesus is the virgin born Messiah and a prophet but they they say it's a blasphemy to call him the Son of God they they're waiting for Jesus to return Sunni Muslims are waiting for Jesus to return not Muhammad they don't they're not looking for him they're not waiting for him at all Sunnis believe that Jesus will return and set up a Muslim Caliphate over the whole world and Shia Muslims which Iranians are Shia Muslims they believe that the 12th Imam will return along with Jesus in order to set up that worldwide caliphate women have less worth than men really they're treated like objects you can marry for for women also they have temporary marriage you can be married for a short period of time one hour one week one month whatever you want and divorce remarriage is perfectly acceptable for men and women in Islam takes for women to testify in court to equal the testimony of one man and Islam allows for women to be beaten for husbands to beat their wives but to not beat them too hard because they're also your property just like cattle and so forth you want to take care of your cattle take care of your property take care of your wife as well so if you're gonna if you disobeys you feel free to beat her but just be gentle whatever that means it's crazy that's crazy it's from a different different era a different time different age and totally backwards brother Branham says this in the Philadelphia Church age in the church age book when afternoon as I began to minister one of the thousands of mohammedans came up on the platform as she stood before me a missionary to the Muhammadans began to softly implore the Lord Oh for that precious soul Oh for that precious soul he had been over there for years and years and according to his own testimony he'd seen only one muhammadin come to receive Jesus Christ as Savior they originally the medo-persians whose laws changed not they are so hard to win it seems that once a always a is a law amongst them and of course that absolutely is the case apostasy is a crime punishable by death so leaving Islam and becoming a Christian is something that it's supposed to be punishable diet by death in those countries that are under Sharia law absolutely enforced that Saudi Arabia and so forth Somalia Turkey is not under Sharia law it's a secular country they're not an Islamic Republic like Iran is there a secular republic their current government government is trying to slowly change it from being a secular country to an Islamic country but it's it's not an easy process to reverse that most Turkish people are if you go there it's almost like for us in Minneapolis it's almost similar because you'll see there's a lot of somali people that live in the minneapolis area so you see many Somalis wearing the full hijab in Turkey I feel like we see about similar percentage of women that are worldly women that are somewhat serious they were a scarf and then women that are very serious there were in the full black pea job there so I would say probably fifty percent of women in Turkey are dress just dressed worldly now would change again based on if you're in a big city or a village what you might be in so like Istanbul you would see more like seventy percent of of women are just worldly just like dressed like Americans and I never thought that yoga pants would catch on in Turkey like they did here but you're starting to see them all over the place even in is so-called conservative Islamic country but it's very true winning Muslims historically it's been almost impossible in these countries there's there's missionaries over the years and you can read about them that have gone and dedicated their lives and just win one a few people a small amount of people but God is moving in a different way amongst the Iranians when I first started working a month amongst them the people that were in like underground churches inside of Iran that had converted from Islam to Christianity were they estimated around a hundred thousand and so now nine years later they're saying that there's upwards of two million that have converted and have become Christians a lot of it is through satellite television so they are watching TBN and different Iranian shows that are based out of say California or Texas or England and those are going by satellite into the country the people are not supposed to have satellite dishes but everybody has satellite dishes and they're watching christiane programming yeah and it's so amazing for them and it's just it's changing lives so many many responding to the gospel so Iranian hearts are open very very open to the gospel my experience it's it was so strange the first time I brought the gospel to an Iranian young man I was expecting a little argument and some back-and-forth but I asked him I told my testimony I spoke about the gospel and I said you have any questions and he says how should I get saved okay I was waiting for her a little bit more than that but repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and so it was just that's the typical response it's very very simple if there's a question it's a simple question about about Jesus or something it's nothing there there so over Islam they know it's not real they know it's you know it's it's nonsense and their hearts are open to the gospel very simply you know another example would be this is something that's happened over and over again you preach on like a deep subject like what is the message or something like that and you never even really mention the gospel per se you know that Jesus came to die of sinners he didn't make an altar call and people are like can we come forward and receive Christ or they'll ask someone next to him and they bring him forward say will you pray with them they want to receive Christ so they're just they get in that atmosphere and that's what they want they want the gospel they want the truth and they're hungry souls and they're open which is only God can create that circumstance in that situation missionaries have gone and pushed and pulled and begged and open hospitals and done everything but when the Holy Spirit moves it's just so easy you know here are some of the believers in in Turkey that we're working with on top is two of the mission ministers we're working in with brother Shahin brother Omid that had the prayer requests for this morning this is one of our services in the city of Deniz Lee this is a typical meeting meet at in the mall or at a coffee shop and ask them questions and let them ask us questions and speak about the Word of God this was at one of our mystery Expos that we put on in the city of Esparta introducing the message to about 150 people there so we had our books and and things and pictures of brother Branham back there this is brother Kevin was the pastor in the city of Esparta he did all the footwork to get all the people there and do the outreach really good meetings that we had there 14 people came to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ from the meetings and on our Sunday morning meeting there was a woman I have this picture up because a woman came into the service and she where we had the service was on the second floor the first floor they came in through on the first floor and walked up the stairs a group of stairs to get up to the next floor and she came in she saw our little table and the pictures of brother Branham and she said oh where is he and the brother said well he passed away many years ago he's gone on to his reward he's God's prophet messenger to this age and and she said no I walked in the building earlier and he was the one that he was there to greet me I mean he looked like she said he looked like this but he was younger and so but I I know I saw him he I greeted him there and so it was just amazing when she came up and told us that testimony she was gay during all the books that she could in order to and starting right away to read them like does seeing God the man just seeing God come and show us you know point us that the message is coming to this town amen so just a few of the people being baptized there and pool at one of the hotels and let me see if this will play this is a video [Music] [Music] there's another one of those interesting situations where you led I led people to the Lord I didn't even know it we were visiting their home and brother oh we didn't we didn't get the whole background of their story we visited their home twice and answered their questions about the Bible and we got there like we're ready to be baptized and we're starting to pray over I'm the one but the one the the husband and the family says we never prayed to accept Christ like I thought you already did I did no that's why we were asking the questions we were asking okay let's pray and this is a Iraqi family they had to flee because their town was attacked by Isis and there's a lot of Iraqis living in in Turkey and this is an open door for us it's just been difficult because we don't have a very good translator there brother homey and brother Nehemiah visited them each a few different times there they're actually Catholic but their desire is to learn learn the Bible and so we're just praying the Lord would raise up a translator for us this is from our ministers meeting this last year some of the ministers wives came as well a part of the meetings for the Nehemiah they're translating for me he's been our main translator and minister that we're working with he actually lives in in Canada now and travels back and forth several times a year to Turkey and does the translation work of the message there in Canada brother Petros he also was directed as a refugee to the country of Germany so he's able to go back a little bit more frequently every couple months he'll return to Turkey he's also planted a church in Hamburg Germany of Iranian refugees living there and so he's also travelling to some of the refugee camps that Germany has set up throughout the country and is able to get in and ministering the message to them in those places as well this was our one of our services there in the city of Esparta back in August I had their brother Omid translating for me and brother Kavon is just a tremendous evangelist when he came to the city there were no no message believers at all just beside himself and he came and started evangelizing people and I think our first time we visited him there was about 30 30 people there we started he had told him some basic things about water baptism then we started introduced brother branham's ministry to them and then started talking about the Godhead and most of the church laughs it was down to like three or four people and then brother cave on just continued going on and it wasn't long after that that he baptized 45 people and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and each time we go back the church continues to grow actually I think they have to have several services every Sunday just to accommodate everyone because they don't have the room there in the church this is one of the sites you see all over a really old mosque I think this is from the 16th century was built there this is in the city of C vas one thing that we we I kind of forget this the city of C vos hadn't had a church in it for almost five hundred years they did Christianity had been chased out and eradicated from the city of C vos and back in December of 2012 brother Petros and brother Nehemiah held a Christmas service there and 17 people give their hearts to Christ so that was the start of the first church in this city in five hundred years incredible this is the what the region that we looked at before Cappadocia looks like so it's beautiful it's quite a tourist area people will come there and they'll take the balloons to look up over the top of it and they're there these rock formations and people actually lived inside the rock formations I don't know the whole story behind it but there's even a there's even a city that's built that's five miles under the ground it's many many many stories that they lived under the ground from what I heard and I don't know if it's a hundred percent accurate but from what I heard is someone had a prophecy that the world was going to be destroyed and so the they began building a city upon city layer upon layer of City underneath the ground well as time went on this area was right outside the control of the Roman Empire so Christians that were living in Rome and different areas that were being persecuted under under the Emperor's back then actually fled to this area and built churches into these rock formations and lived underground as protection from the Roman Empire these are the ruins of laodicea Leodis he has been was destroyed four different times by earthquakes and so they they rebuilt it four times but after that fourth time it was destroyed they decided to move the city further down the river so that it wouldn't be destroyed again but they're one of our one of our churches that we have is in that replacement city right next to Laodicea so if you're wondering there is a church in laodicea nayo Tasya [Music] this is the supernatural series it's actually has all been translated now and we're just working on getting it printed for the believers there it's just been a tremendous help to them to see kind of the progression and supernatural life that brother Branham had things that we don't think of but they just didn't have access to it you know there's 50 57 messages translated so this has been a huge huge help to them this is the church ages book that's the translation was finished this spring and has been printed and distributed amongst the believers there another thing we're we're dreaming about for many years and the Lord made a way for us very thankful this is a recent mystery Expo that brother Petros and brother Omid and where the Kavon put on in the city of Chi Suri we had had a small group of three or four believers that were gathering together there in that city and so brother Petros went and kind of did a bunch of outreach and scheduled a meeting and invited the people he introduced the message just on a basic level kayvon introduced the gospel to the people and then they baptized I believe ten people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there as a result of these meetings and churches about 17 to 20 people attending it now feeding on the message brother ol meat is traveling that's what he wants to move because he'd been working with a little group in Sivas he wants to move to Kaiser receive us has like a hundred Iranian refugees living in the whole city and Chi Sri has many thousands of irani and refugees living there so with that has a greater opportunity to do outreach and and work with the people and bring the message to them so some of the baptisms and brother ole Mead or the Kavon number the Petros there this last August I also traveled to another country which I probably shouldn't name here for streaming online but it's an arabic-speaking country and we had the opportunity to work with a couple different churches there and introduce the message to them and they've gladly received it and are continuing to follow along with the message Lord willing we'll be going back there again in January to continue the process of feeding them the truth and so keep us in prayer with that different totally different country people and totally different approach with them but the Lord's with us I know and it's going well just cover your prayers with that after introducing the message seven people got baptized there eight chapters of the church changes book has also been completed in the Arabic language Lord raised up a translator so we're excited about that working with Cloverdale getting that on the message hub as well and that's it on that one so the Lord is moving in the Middle East so I need your prayers definitely and just appreciate appreciate that very much it's a spiritual battle you know that's the part that you think that we sometimes forget about is that we are in a battle against the devil on a constant basis and we have to have our armor on so let's let's kind of change the order here and we'll finish up the message from this morning let's pray Heavenly Father as we change the order from testimonies to the preaching of the word we asked for an anointing Lord to do that not only upon me but upon your people Lord that we would pull from you that you would give us thing which we have need of give us the answers that were that that you have for us and Lord may it be clear and understandable to the people we ask it in Jesus name Amen okay so we've been we were talking about the different terminologies used in the in the New Testament looking at those couple different Greek words Ione and IO Neos and studying how they're used there if you recall those some of you I think are weren't here this morning but a couple different Greek words that are used and they're always said that they're translated as eternal meaning no beginning and no ending but if you look at them they're used in conjunction with words like beginning the words like began words like present present not like gift but like present tense and so when you put a word like Ione or IO Neos together with a word that speaks of time you can't have an eternal beginning you can't have eternal present tense doesn't make any sense at all you can't you can't have eternity ending so we have to understand these words even if the even if the scholars tell us that they mean eternal in the sense of no beginning nor ending we have to actually look at how the scripture defines these words and so we understand that most of the time those words mean the in an age or a period of time and you know we were myself what was your name brother brother Jose were speaking after the service and he mentioned the word Zoe which is life so eternal life when those words come together we understand it's speaking about something different not speaking just about a period of time because Zoe if you really look at what it mean I mean it's in one sense it just means life but when you're attaching to the to God or eternity we're speaking of God's own life this is divine life the word Zoe so if we have eternal Zoe it's connected to God and what is God he has no beginning no ending God isn't in a period of time or an age God is eternal he's outside of time okay so it again the word used in it in any situation it's the it's the understanding of it is based on the context that it's used in we always look at it that way the very definition of eternal that brother Branham gaves us gave us no B in the English word I should say no beginning no ending shows that Hell itself cannot be an unceasing torment why because it has a beginning hell is created for the devil and his angels and so it's if it's created it's going to have an end in other words you could say well you're created I'm created therefore we have an end but the thing is your inner you have to look at the big picture because what's the life what's the life inside of the son of God it's God's own life and therefore that has no beginning and no ending but other things that are that are created that don't come directly from the life of God have an ending and so yes hell was created but it was for the purpose of distraction and we'll find that in the scripture it wasn't created as an eternal torture chamber you know and they just think about it for a second we see God as love as just as kind and what Christianity theologians some theologians not everyone have imputed to God is that he wants to put people in an eternal torture chamber and torture them unending can you imagine no God says the wages of sin is death he just cuts off that life God is not in the business of torturing people that's what he'll that's what their description of Hell is is torture and God that's not the nature of God we'll look at that more later so yeah we just said that the purpose of Hell is to bring both physical and spiritual death leading to annihilation of being they go out of existence that's the purpose of Hell well Jesse you brought this verse right after the service it's like uh yeah that's that's like next scripture we cover mark 19 43 and 44 and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell so first of all think about it this way just if we're gonna take this verse literally it's very strange okay your hand causes you to sin cut off your hand so then you're not sinning anymore and then you'll enter into life with no hand is that how the resurrection works if you have no hand when you're resurrected you'll have a hand if you have no foot in the resurrection you'll have a foot so perhaps Jesus is pointing out something different but then a literal understanding of this verse in other words he said we should violently resist sin with all the strength within us whatever it takes to stop that if your phone causes you to sin get rid of your phone if your internet causes you to soon get rid of your internet if your TV causes you to sin get rid of your TV and the list goes on he's not saying that we should cut off our body parts and then we'll enter into eternity without those body parts that's totally contrary to the rest of Scripture into the fire that shall never be quenched okay that's fine the fire won't be quenched it didn't say the person will never die that the fire won't be quenched where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched okay so let's just take this literally absolutely a hundred percent literally they're going to be in the grave and the worm is going to continue to eat them until what if the worm doesn't die what's gonna happen to the body the carcass because worms eat carcasses not spirits not souls worms eat dead bodies so where is the body gonna go at the end it's gonna be totally consumed it's not going to exist in its state anymore and the fire is not quenched again okay fine the fire is not quenched but did you know this is quoting another verse of scripture that Jesus didn't just make this up out of thin air he's actually grabbing this from another verse Isaiah 66 verse 24 this is I think it's good to get the whole context of this let's turn in our Bibles to Isaiah 66 [Music] [Music] so first of all in Isaiah 65 it's talking about creating a new heavens and the new earth speaking about the Millennium then it's speaking in verse in in chapter 66 it's going into the kingdom it's going into the the place of God's dwelling it's going into a little bit of the restoration of Israel and so forth so then we get to this place verse 24 and they shall all go forth and look upon so this is talking about the righteous the people that are gathering together to worship the Lord in the Millennium so verse 24 and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh okay so it's very interesting the context here so they're worshiping the Lord let's just say at the temple if that's what we want to look at they're worshiping the Lord at the temple and it says they're gonna come and worship before the Lord and then they go out of the temple and there's dead bodies laying everywhere all around and it says they're gonna see the people laying there the worm will not die neither shall their fire be quenched okay it's a gruesome it's a gruesome spot it's a gruesome sight so literally you think literally they're going to come out of the temple and all around the temple and the Millennium there's gonna be just dead bodies sprinkled everywhere and you'll just watch oh there's worms and there's fire coming out of their bodies that's gross what is it what does it mean why it is why is that said their God is they're gonna know that God took vengeance there on those people when did he take vengeance at them at the end of the Great Tribulation Period okay so yes Armageddon and so what is it I don't believe what piece would we have if we walked out of the temple I walked out of church and all around us is dead bodies but it's not we wouldn't enjoy that it wouldn't be wonderful but what it what is it simply telling us there will be a remembrance you were delivered from the wrath of God I think that's all it means their worm dies not there neither is the fire quenched the worm eats until it the body is consumed the fire burns until the body is consumed again the picture is not out of an eternal torment the picture is of a consumption until they're done away with what does Malachi 4 says the wicked shall not be left either root nor branch means they're gonna be annihilated amen Matthew 10:28 and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell my so if to kill is to deprive the body of life then hell would seem to be the deprivation of both physical and spiritual life that is an extinction of being you go out of existence God is going to kill the soul what does it mean to kill the soul it's dead it means it doesn't exist anymore the but when the body is killed you don't exist here anymore you're dead you go to the grave your body is basically useless for this dimension now your spiritual life goes on but then eventually in hell if a person is in hell it will be cut off because God can destroy the soul in hell question and answers on Hebrews 1957 brother Branham says he'll die he'll go into a lake of fire and brimstone which burns we're burning is going on forever and forever and maybe for a hundred million years his soul may be tormented in the lake of fire and brimstone you say well it'd just be like regular brimstone I believe it would be a million times worse than that but I believe you couldn't describe it by fire by a literal fire the only reason it's put by fire that fire is the most consuming thing that we had it absolutely consumes and destroys everything fire does so that's the picture that when we have fire we shouldn't think what we've been taught to think by denominations which is that you'll be tormented by fire eternally but you should think of fire is the thing that consumes and destroys and puts out the life completely perishing death and destruction so let's look at these verses if the soul of sinners is immortal let's look at this first Corinthians 1:18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but to unto us which are saved it is the power of God so those that are lost are said to be perishing 1st Corinthians 2:15 2nd Corinthians 2:15 for we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish 2nd Thessalonians 2:10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved this earlier Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord Matthew 7:13 entry in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat so if hell is eternal then those who perish never perish those who are destroyed are never destroyed and those that die never die revelation 20 verse 14 and death and he'll were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death so the first death is physical death second death is a spiritual death go out of existence entirely revelation 20 verse 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night from eye on to eye on for ever and ever from age to age a long period of time because it's the second death there's got to be a time where they go out of existence but there will there will be a tormenting of the devil for a long period of time as brother Madison maybe millions of years Malachi 4:1 we reread it we referred to it before but we'll read it now for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble in the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of Hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch so the wicked will be totally consumed question-and-answers 19:59 brother Branham says I don't believe the Bible teaches an eternal burning hell it doesn't because if hell is eternal and people that go there will be punished eternally the only the way they could be eternally punished they'd have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's in God see so they have to come to annihilation that is their physical part becomes annihilated and then their spiritual part becomes annihilated that's completely consumed there's no more to it neither root nor branch the Bible calls it their completely done away Exodus 21 23 through 25 and if any mischief follow then thou shalt give life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe so this is a principle in God the punishment must be commensurate to the crime you know you have in in Islam where that someone steals something and you should cut their hands off it's not commensurate to the crime that that's a ridiculous punishment or you have a someone who has done a simple crime and they execute them steal something or something like that this is not that's not commensurate to itself that that's over-the-top but God's principle is justice and so if if someone has committed a crime in space and time would it be then proper for God to punish them for eternity think about that first and wouldn't be and so God God is always just if someone is a monster right Adolf Hitler or something Satan they're going to be punished for a long period of time just as their different rewards in the kingdom different levels in the kingdom in hell there's different punishments depending on the sin that the people have committed but at the end the wages of sin is death spiritual death vegans 110 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him you know there's gonna come a time where everything that exists is going to be one United in Christ but if there's still people and spirits burning in hell for all eternity how can it really be said that everything in heaven and in earth is really United in Christ there's got to come a time where the wicked souls and spirits are done away with Ezekiel 18 verse 4 behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die you know these things are actually really simple once you get the glass of I'll call it theology off of the scripture you can see the simple reality of life and death and we go back to what you know I want to relate this back to what I was talking about before because this is important to see it within the realm of predestination within the realm of the seed lines you see John chapter 8 let's look there tie these things together [Music] when the serpent seed was introduced into the human race this was now a hybrid life and so in the book of Ecclesiastes we're not going to turn there I'm just gonna refer to it we find it says the life of man like the life of the sons of Adam goes up but the life of the beast goes down so what does it mean it means that that the the seed light of Adam was destined for heaven predestinated for heaven but the life of the Beast it doesn't continue on when it dies it's done it goes out of existence so you have the two life lives there think about what the serpent was it was the most subtly the most beautiful and the most intelligent of all the animals of the field so it was an animal so where would it light where would its life go it wasn't made in the image of God wasn't a son of God it was an animal so it's life when it dies it's done it's finished now that life is injected into the human race so we have a hybrid life there and then we saw in Genesis chapter 6 or that further hybridization comes and all of us have that serpentine nature within us we have some of the seed of Adam nature and some of this the seed of the serpent nature there and so everybody has that just in our genetics and so we must die we have to die but some are predestinated to life some have another gene in there which is the gene of God and so let's look here in John 8 and we start at verse 39 they answered and said unto Him Abraham his father jesus saith unto them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham that word their children is teknon teknon means like a close intimate relationship you share the same nature the same attitude the same approach to things and the same life right but now verse 40 but now you seek to kill me a man that have told has told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham Abraham so know it so you see that the connection Abraham's children have the nature of Abraham they don't seek to kill someone that says that they've heard from God 41 you do the deeds of your father so here it's a little confusing who is he talking about which father is he talking about he doesn't say but the Pharisees understand him right away was in verse 41 then said they'd to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God we saw that before being the seed of the devil here they connect to being born from fornication so they immediately connect you're you're the seed of the devil because of the fornication between Eve and the serpent that produced Cain and the serpent seed we have one father even God so that's their difference they look at it if they're from Adam's line if you're from Abraham's line then you're the seed of God and God is your father if you're not your from the seed of the serpent that's their viewpoint and verse 42 Jesus said unto them if god were your father I want you to notice this closely because this goes back to the genes of God the seed of God that's in the soul the soul if you don't remember this the soul is the control tower the soul has in it either saying yes or no to the Word of God that's it but it's that but in that soul is the nature the soul is the nature of the Spirit and so with within that that that should be the control tower not the flesh God through the Holy Spirit once wants by faith to control all our other senses so the spirit is connected to your mind so the the five realms of the Spirit are I always miss these memory reason conscience affection and what's the other way and imagination so those five senses are not designed to rule over us faith is designed which is put in the soul by God through predestination but when we're not born again that's not how it is the controls the flashes see taste feel smell and hear man and so that's not to control us but faith should control all our senses and so we have eat each of those senses within us and Jesus says this jesus said unto them and all those senses I'll say it again all those senses are a result of our mother and father's DNA coming together and joining together everything that's inside of us is a result of that the genetics okay and so all of that is coming we're coming back all the way back to the very beginning and looking at how that's coming through the human race right okay but then by predestination jesus said unto them if God we're your father you would love me think about that for a second they're saying he's telling them you are from the devil the reason why you're from the devil is because you don't love me and you can't hear my word and you're seeking to kill me why that's the nature of your daddy that's the nature of your father the devil did this at the beginning how did he do it how did he do it at the beginning Cain Cain killed Abel Abel had a revelation of how to worship God you must kill a lamb and that lamb is an innocent one that pushes your sins forward to the Lamb of God that's coming in the future it covers your sin and it pushes you forward Cain was angry he hated that and he killed Abel because of it it wasn't wrong that Cain offered fruits of the field to God he should have offered them but not in that order and not for that purpose God and even a God had mercy said well if you do well won't you be accepted there's a sin offering in the King James it says there's sin lying at the door and you have to rule over it but if you look at that word sin it literally means there's a sin offering kneeling at the door there's a lamb there that's ready to be offered for you pain if you would like to receive it it's right there for you and it's desires for you and you have to rule over it yeah but what did what it came do instead of going out and saying Abel would you please teach me about this I know you have a revelation from God what did he do he went out and spoke to him and if they started debating and fighting about religion and he kills it it's the very same picture that's happening in John chapter 8 and in the gospel but if God we're your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me so if God's your father you love Jesus not just the Jesus that's preached by so-and-so or so-and-so the real genuine vindicated Jesus because remember in 2nd Corinthians 11 it says I'm concerned about you I'm concerned about you because as Satan the serpent beguiled Eve I'm afraid that someone else will come and preach to you another Jesus and we have not preached or another gospel and that you'll receive another spirit whom whom we have not preached and so there is another Jesus out there but it's not really the true living Jesus Christ it's a fake Jesus and it's actually what what is it result Paul's fear was that they would commit adultery against Christ he says he says I've espoused you as a chaste virgin to Christ and that's what his fear was that they would receive another Jesus and commit adultery against the true Bible Jesus oh ok so the true manifested Jesus Christ if if God we're your father you would love the true manifested Jesus Christ why because there's something placed inside of you by God in your soul that says yes to the Word of God amen why do you not understand my speech even because you know you cannot hear my word what is it they had nothing inside of them that could receive the word nothing inside of them that could even hear it forty-four you are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not o money which of you convinces me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God hears God's words either for hear them not because you are not of God okay so we we see this the faribault the Pharisees in Christ are connecting their Parenthood to their works right they're connecting the fact that they're connect they're with Abraham that that was that's what the Jews saw is their safety we are Abraham's children therefore we are from God and Jesus says if you were Abraham's teknon his children another place he says I know you're Abraham's seed I know you're I know you're literally from the children of Israel but you're not predestinated your Serpent's seed because you're rejecting me if you're Abraham's teknon his beloved children with his same nature you you would do the works of Abraham amen and so the elect they have the capability to hear and receive the word so that the other ones there's no place for the word in you so what's the opposite of that the elect have a place for the word in them what is that place that's the soul that's that's what's predestinated by God and so they can they can hear they can love the manifested Jesus now there's lots of Jesus's you know you go to a charismatic church today and they'll tell you Jesus is going to give you everything you ever dreamed of as long as you give money to our church if you sow the seed to our church which means give us money then Jesus is going to pour out his blessings and you can continue to wear your funny hair and you can continue to paint your face and go and wear your bikinis and so forth and Jesus loves you except for that's the devil that's not Jesus Christ that's a false doctrine and many many Christians people who are sincere whom I love whom whom I see and say there are very nice people they're deceived by it why because it will be so close it'll deceive the elect if possible and so they have miracles they have things that are happening in their meetings but what is it it's not the Jesus of the Bible it's a strong delusion actually is what it is and you know it's to me it's it's sad when you see that because there is a true reality and it's not far off it's not hard to find it's right here in the scriptures but people want their own ways their own ideas verse 19 of chapter 8 then said they unto Him where is thy father jesus answered you don't know me and you don't know my father why these are people dedicated to serving Almighty God with their whole heart he says you don't even know who God is they've left everything they've dedicated all they are to serving God and teaching the commandments of God but what was it they could God was standing in front of them manifested and they said that is the devil what do they do today what do they do today when Jesus was manifested by the pillar of fire through a humble prophet what did they say that's the devil they couldn't see God hidden behind they never can see God hidden behind a veil the the rulers of the synagogue so to speak the Orthodox Church was always wrong should only one place in the Bible where the Orthodox Church the one that was in power and control was the one that was right on the word brother Jose is there one spot in the Bible where the Orthodox Church was correct she had find it always they were the ones persecuting the truth they were always fighting against the truth and Jesus says you don't you don't even know God if you know if you'd known me you'd have known my father also what is it because Jesus was manifesting the word for that time and because he was manifesting the word for that time they couldn't recognize it they said it's the devil why because their of their father the devil they do the works of their father I mean look we can continue on then said the Jews will kill himself because he's say where I go you cannot come said unto them you're from beneath oh my goodness you're from hell I'm from above you're of this world I'm not from this world I said therefore unto you that you shall die in your sins for if you believe not that I am he you shall die in your [Music] again all through history let's not just put this to the time of Jesus I was back there I for sure I would receive it go through all of history and I ask you God was veiling himself behind human flesh in portion in the prophets in fullness in Jesus but in portion all through the ages and what did the people do was just a man that's what they think just a man making himself something Makia they threw him in the prison Isaiah they sawed him in half Jeremiah again and again they persecuted in what was it the people and power could didn't want to be told they were wrong they want it oh yes you're just fine yes I want to pet you the right pet him the right way and he'll be happy and he'll take care of our financial needs but the true man of God came and said you're wrong returned to God well we never left him we're the ones that are in authority don't miss that because sometimes we look and we see around and say oh it's oh and so they've got a big church so on so they've got so what what did Jesus say if you're not fear not megachurch fear not little little flock you see you have to that's the Bible way if you're not little flock and you know what is it it's recognizing Jesus Christ on display today think about it for a second many people recognize Jesus Christ on display in nineteen forty fifty and 1960 but what about today what about his present tense truth today we're not just talking about back in william branham time we rejoicing over his manifestation then but he's today he is doing something through a fivefold ministry and people are rejecting that and what is it what is it doing they can't recognize God veiled in human flesh today in the bride amen they said unto Him verse 25 who are you that's a good question who are you but they weren't listening for an answer they're just saying who are you that jesus saith unto them even the same I said unto you from the beginning been telling you all along you're not listening that's the problem I have many things to say in to judge of you but he that sent me is true and I speak to the world those things that which I have heard of him he understood not that he spake to them of the Father then said Jesus unto them when you have lifted up the Son of Man then shall you know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father has taught me I speak these things and he that sent me with me the father has not left me alone for I all would do always those things that please him as he spake these words many believed on him my and then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if so they they were believers they confessed to be believers Jesus says if you continue in my word think about that for a minute they can't stay stagnant in the past what if they said well I believe in Jesus but I don't need to go to Pentecost and receive the Holy Ghost they needed the present tense word for that time if you continue in my word then are you my disciples and he shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free amen and so these these things we look and see what is what is that genuine manifestation of the life that was birthed into Adam first and then passed on to the human race now we know again it's their prayer predestination now amongst all nations tribes tongues and kingdoms it's not a race thing at all and so what is it how do we recognize that it's people that can hear they can hear and respond in obedience to the word it's not the one that joins a church it's not that one that's safe in a big denomination but it's the one that can hear and recognize the manifestation of Jesus Christ today and so Jesus says that if you were Abraham's children you'd love me you do the works of Abraham if God we're your father you would love me you can you have a place inside of you from my word what is that that's a lot that's where there's life the life coming to the life what is it we were born in this hybrid condition right so our first birth was wrong we must be born again that's why we need the new birth our first birth was corruptible with under the hybrid seed therefore we need a new birth from heaven but it's what is it doing it's actually quickening that predestinated seed that's inside of us so that life is there like dormant laying dormant and then the Holy Ghost comes and quickens that to life when we recognize the word remember we read before we're born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which lives and abides forever that incorruptible seed coming to us brings that which is in our soul to life but there's some they hear the word and they hate it or they hear the word and they have no capabilities of responding to it so what is it what is the difference that's life and death why because those who are predestinated come from the life of God they'll never die Jesus says he that believes in me shall never die my what a vision can you say that about yourself can you speak that over your own life I think we should okay you're laying in the deathbed and and you die but you should still be speaking I believe in Jesus Christ I'll never die amen but some they do die and so that's those two different life's those two different seed lines one is ordained to go on justice God goes on one is ordained to go down to die they must they must die because their life is not from God and so what are they going to do they'll eventually go out of existence completely God will punish them they'll be tormented for a season but then when once they've reached whatever that place that God has brought them to then they go out of existence why because they're not from God they're of their father the devil and so it's so it's it's we can differentiate it based on what you recognize right recognizing the manifested word in your age in your time and even that's what brother Branham tells us that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost seeing the manifested word for your age and so that's that's the place where it's different because it's a love there's a love that's inside of you you know when we love our Father you think about even on this sinful earth and you see children in foster kids situations or terrible they still love their parents maybe their parents were the worst human beings on the planet and very terrible to them but yet they still love their parents and so there's this is Jesus is saying if if God we're your father you would love me what is it because we recognize that our Father is the manifested word for this age amen and so we just love it we just rejoice in it and God reveals it word on top of word and he transforms our life word on top of word right so that seed has to come to life because what does the scripture say he that started the began a good work and you will be faithful to complete it so that seed that's in you will grow to the full fruit that it's supposed to grow to nothing is going to prevent that why because it's God doing the work you know we the scripture says that we should work out our salvation with fear and trembling why because it's God that works in you to will and to do of his good pleasure in other words if God is working in you there's going to be a work that's being produced in your life to get closer to him to be more like him to have a desire for him to have a fire for him and so there's nothing that can block that actually from happening because God has put it in the seed you know when an apple when when an apple seed goes to the ground it's watered and it starts coming to life everything that that apple tree becomes actually was in the seed in itself and so in those conditions and God makes sure we were in the right conditions and makes sure that we come to life so whatever is in that seed that he's predestinated there in your soul it's going to produce precisely what God wants it to produce and there's nothing that's going to block that from happening God will take care of care of that and see that that that will come to pass in your life aren't you thankful for that you can see it from the beginning to the very end God is in control God is bringing you to life God is bringing through you every every situation and you know what we can have comfort and peace because of that amen let's pray father oh how we love to speak about your goodness to us Lord oh how we love to speak about the assurance of our salvation Lord that we are eternally secure in Christ and that because of that there's a great work going on within us to conform us to the image of Jesus Christ Lord we ask just continue to move in us and work in us Lord if there's anything there Lord we know we know that by your grace Lord you'll you'll reveal it to us and
