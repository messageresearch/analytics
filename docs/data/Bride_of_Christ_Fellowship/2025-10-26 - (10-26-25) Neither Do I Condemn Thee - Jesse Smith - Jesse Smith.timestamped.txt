[0:00] adultery and uh I just started crying
[0:03] when he was talking about it. So, I'd
[0:05] like to preach on that today uh by God's
[0:07] grace. But I'm going to call it neither
[0:09] do I condemn thee. I want to entitle
[0:11] that. Neither do I condemn thee.
[0:16] Hallelujah.
[0:18] So, we'll just read 811. by the grace of
[0:21] the Lord.
[0:40] John 8:11. Is this on? Is it on? Seems
[0:43] like it's a little quiet.
[0:47] I don't hear myself as as well as I
[0:49] normally do. Maybe
[0:51] turned up or something.
[0:53] Okay, thank you.
[1:03] John 8:11. Okay, that's a little better.
[1:13] John 8:11. Praise God.
[1:16] We'll just read this one verse and we'll
[1:18] have you be seated by God's grace. Isn't
[1:21] this the dream or not the dream but just
[1:23] the desire of all of us to have Jesus
[1:25] look at us and say, "I don't condemn
[1:27] you." In other words, I forgive you.
[1:30] Praise God. Isn't that what we all
[1:32] desire? We can all find ourselves in
[1:34] this story, can't we? By God's grace, as
[1:37] we'll see. So, let's read 811. Let's
[1:40] begin on three. One, two, three. She
[1:42] said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said
[1:46] unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee, go
[1:50] and sin no more." May God add his
[1:52] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[1:54] can be seated by God's grace.
[2:04] So God bless you. just one service today
[2:07] here uh by the grace of the Lord
[2:11] and I apologize you know on uh Friday I
[2:13] think I sent out the wrong schedule
[2:15] first and then I corrected it so make
[2:16] sure you read that second text okay
[2:18] don't read the first one because I got
[2:19] my dates mixed up um so there there's no
[2:23] special service next Saturday uh I need
[2:25] to send that to brother Chris so sorry
[2:27] brother Chris I need to send you that
[2:28] news updated schedule uh it's going to
[2:30] be November 15th and 16th uh by the
[2:33] grace of God.
[2:35] Uh, you know, this week at school, we
[2:37] got the Halloween coming up, the
[2:38] Halloween celebration, which is the day
[2:40] of the dead. You know, they celebrate
[2:41] the dead and all this. They celebrate
[2:43] death and all these things like that.
[2:45] So, I just trust all of our children and
[2:47] young adults in school uh will abstain
[2:50] from that. Praise God. Now, as a
[2:52] teacher, I have to be a part of it, but
[2:54] I just tell the kids, I just tell the
[2:56] children, you know, I don't celebrate
[2:57] it. I said, 'But there's nothing wrong
[2:59] with a cute little child dressed up like
[3:01] a duck or something like that, right?
[3:04] The Bible says to the pure all things
[3:05] are pure. And Zion asked, Zion asked me
[3:08] in the a car, he said, "Daddy, does
[3:10] everybody who celebrates Halloween
[3:11] worship the devil?" And I said, "Not
[3:13] everybody." And here's the point. Like,
[3:15] if you dress up like a duck or a
[3:17] football player or something like that
[3:19] and you just eat candy, is there
[3:21] anything sinful with that? Well, no.
[3:23] Unless you're destroying your temple
[3:24] with too much sugar, right?
[3:26] But if you're dressing up like demons
[3:29] and witches and uh you celebrate death
[3:32] and blood and murder and gore, is that
[3:34] devil worship? That is devil worship
[3:37] because you're exalting wickedness.
[3:40] So, uh that's kind of the balance that
[3:42] we have. Now, for us, we just stay away
[3:44] from it all. Brother Chris,
[3:49] &gt;&gt; yes, that's right. Yes.
[3:55] Wow.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; I did not see that, brother. Wow.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. So, it's kind of like just a
[4:06] sign of God's judgment upon those type
[4:08] of things. Very good. Yes, sir. That's
[4:10] right, brother. Uh God is merciful for
[4:12] so long, but then he'll pour out a
[4:13] judgment, usually a small one. Uh, of
[4:15] course, until the great tribulation,
[4:17] then he pours out all of his wrath in
[4:18] judgment. Very good, brother. good catch
[4:20] on that. Um, you know, in some churches
[4:22] celebrate uh harvest festivals. We don't
[4:24] do that. We just celebrate Thanksgiving.
[4:26] Praise God. We just skip October and go
[4:28] to November. Hallelujah. Uh, so, you
[4:32] know, that's what I do at school. I just
[4:33] and I have to be all around it, but I
[4:35] just uh smile and I if they say
[4:37] something about it, I just I just I just
[4:39] deflect the question. If they say, "Do
[4:40] you like my witch costume?" This is what
[4:42] I've said in the past. They say, "Do you
[4:43] like my witch costume?" I said, "Oh, I
[4:45] think you'd be better off as an angel."
[4:48] So I I don't agree with their, you know,
[4:50] things like that, but I deflect it in a
[4:52] very kind way. I just try to focus on
[4:55] the good and get their thoughts on the
[4:56] good.
[4:58] I just have to be around it by God's
[5:00] grace. And uh you know, I even had a uh
[5:02] just I'm not sure I didn't plan to say
[5:04] this, but you know, sometimes I wonder
[5:06] if I chose the right occupation, but I
[5:08] just had a a family uh two weeks ago
[5:10] reach reach across the table. We had
[5:12] conferences and they said, "Mr. Smith,
[5:14] can we pray for you as a husband and
[5:15] wife and you are the answer to our
[5:17] prayers? And uh can we just pray that
[5:20] God will extend your influence? And she
[5:21] told me, she said, you don't know how
[5:23] many families you've touched here in
[5:24] CPPley, you know, because you've stood
[5:26] on the word of God and all these things.
[5:27] And I said, well, I appreciate that. You
[5:29] know, I think that's the first time I've
[5:30] had parents reach across the table and
[5:32] pray with me. I've prayed with other
[5:34] ones, but that was the first time I that
[5:36] they wanted to pray with me. So, uh,
[5:39] when I see, you know, that God has
[5:40] placed me there as an answer to people's
[5:42] prayers and I can rejoice in that. And,
[5:44] you know, church, no matter where you
[5:45] work, you got to put up with some of
[5:46] these things. So, may God give us the
[5:48] wisdom, right, to be in the world, but
[5:51] not of the world.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; I have to deal with this. I have to
[5:54] every year, I got to deal with this. And
[5:56] everybody, even the secretary in my
[5:58] school knows Jesse's worst day of the
[6:00] year is Halloween. That's really that's
[6:02] the only day I don't like is Halloween.
[6:04] And we joke about it every year. I'm
[6:06] like, uh, I wish I could be sick on this
[6:08] day every year, but uh, I still want to
[6:11] shine the light of Jesus Christ in some
[6:13] way, shape, or form. And to the pure,
[6:15] all things are pure. You know, these
[6:17] things don't cause me to stumble. I just
[6:19] I don't celebrate them. I celebrate
[6:21] life. Praise God. Hallelujah. We
[6:23] celebrate the life of Jesus Christ. All
[6:25] right. So, that's about a fivem minute
[6:27] introduction there. So, um, by God's
[6:29] grace,
[6:32] uh, we want to, uh, look at this thought
[6:33] here today. I trust it be a blessing to
[6:35] you. Um, I was, as I said, I was, we
[6:36] were fellowshipping over at that Mexican
[6:38] restaurant there a couple Saturdays ago,
[6:40] and Brother Dale was just speaking all
[6:41] these things. I'm like, "Wow, this is
[6:42] beautiful." Oh, I I haven't preached
[6:44] this for a while. Let me preach the uh
[6:46] the story about the woman caught in
[6:47] adultery. And I think that'd be a
[6:49] blessing to us today uh by God's grace.
[6:53] Uh before we get to that though, let
[6:54] let's remember if you're in uh John
[6:56] chapter 8, uh let's remember that uh all
[6:59] have fallen short of the glory of God.
[7:01] Romans uh 3:23. So uh the Bible says for
[7:05] all have sinned and come short of the
[7:08] glory of God. So all of us to some
[7:11] degree could find ourselves in the same
[7:13] position as this woman caught in
[7:15] adultery because church let me say like
[7:16] this. God has seen all your sins.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; In other words, we've all been caught in
[7:22] the very act.
[7:24] But how you respond to that uh will will
[7:28] show how or show what's in your heart
[7:30] and how God's going to deal with you.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Right? So, and we'll look at this woman.
[7:35] How does she respond in that moment? You
[7:37] know, does she get angry? Now, you know
[7:39] the answer. Does she start uh arguing
[7:41] with God? Well, I was tempted and well,
[7:44] you allowed me to do it and you allowed
[7:45] the devil to tempt me. And so, church,
[7:48] so much depends on our attitude towards
[7:50] the word of God. Hallelujah. We just
[7:53] need a humble attitude. Uh Romans 3:24
[7:56] says, "Being justified freely."
[7:58] Remember, salvation is a free gift.
[8:00] Aren't you glad, church? It's free. You
[8:04] don't have to do anything. You don't
[8:05] have to trade anything. God just gives
[8:08] you salvation freely.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In other words, God could
[8:12] save you and you don't have to go to
[8:14] church just to get it. You can get
[8:16] salvation in your home.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; You could get salvation in your car.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; You could get salvation on the job.
[8:22] Hallelujah. It is a free gift. Aren't
[8:25] you glad that it's free? Hallelujah.
[8:27] Freely by his grace through the
[8:29] redemption. And that's why we're saying
[8:30] about redeemed. We've been bought back
[8:33] because Jesus shed his blood. That was
[8:36] buying back. He was purchasing all of
[8:38] our souls back to God. Hallelujah. By
[8:41] the blood of Jesus Christ. Verse 25.
[8:44] Whom God has set forth to be a
[8:46] propitiation through faith in his blood
[8:49] to declare his righteousness for the
[8:52] remission of sins that are passed
[8:54] through the fa forbearance of God. If
[8:56] you would leave that verse up there. See
[8:57] what our faith must be in. Our faith
[8:59] must be in the blood of Jesus Christ. My
[9:03] faith is not in my righteousness. It's
[9:05] not in brother Brandon's righteousness.
[9:07] It's not in uh uh Paul's righteousness
[9:09] or John's righteousness. Our faith is in
[9:12] the blood of Jesus Christ, the
[9:14] righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[9:17] Hallelujah. And he is the propituation.
[9:20] He is the one who took the wrath of God
[9:22] that the that the the punishment, our
[9:24] punishment might go on him. that the
[9:27] righteousness of Christ might come on
[9:29] us.
[9:30] And I love verse 26. To declare, I say,
[9:33] at this time, his righteousness. So
[9:37] Jesus's righteousness is declared
[9:40] against our sin. Hallelujah. For the
[9:43] remission of sins that are passed
[9:44] through the forbearance of God. I'm
[9:46] sorry, I repeated that. Let's finish
[9:48] verse 26. that he might be just and the
[9:51] justifier of him which believeth in
[9:55] Jesus. So if you believe in Jesus, God
[9:58] justifies you. God declares you
[10:01] righteous as you wish to be.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; So don't let the devil talk you out of
[10:07] it. And the church said,
[10:09] &gt;&gt; "Don't let the devil talk you out of it.
[10:11] Jesus justified you." Don't let the
[10:13] devil tell you, "Well, you're still
[10:14] unclean." Amen.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus has justified you. Amen.
[10:21] And then verse 27, where's boasting
[10:23] then? Who's going to brag when they get
[10:24] to heaven? Nobody's going to brag when
[10:26] they get to heaven. Nobody can brag
[10:28] about their righteousness. It is
[10:29] excluded. God excludes all braggers.
[10:32] Aren't you glad about that, church?
[10:34] &gt;&gt; People on this side can brag about how
[10:36] good they are, but God will exclude it.
[10:39] God will not allow them into the
[10:40] heavenly worship service.
[10:43] It's only going to be people that want
[10:44] to glorify Jesus and praise the name of
[10:47] Jesus and magnify the name of Jesus for
[10:50] what he's done. Hallelujah.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; No bragging in heaven. Hallelujah.
[10:54] Except unless we brag on Jesus.
[10:57] Glory to God. By what law? Right. By
[11:00] what works? Nay. None of them. So
[11:03] there's no law that you did that got you
[11:05] saved. There's no works you did that got
[11:07] you saved. It is by the law of faith. I
[11:10] just had faith in the blood of Jesus
[11:12] Christ.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we conclude that a man is
[11:16] justified by faith without the deeds of
[11:19] the law. So, in other words, faith is
[11:21] assurance, right? Or a belief or a
[11:23] trust. So, we're justified by simply
[11:26] trusting in God.
[11:29] Just trust in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[11:32] If you trust in Jesus work and the
[11:34] cross, if you trust in his promises,
[11:37] then you are justified. You're on your
[11:39] way to heaven shouting victory.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You just have to
[11:44] trust. And you know, we know brother Ram
[11:46] gives us a deeper revelation of faith.
[11:48] Uh he said it's a revelation of the will
[11:50] of God. So God has revealed to you. His
[11:53] will is to save you by the blood.
[11:56] Jesus chose you to save you by his
[11:59] blood. So you have faith in that
[12:01] unveiling of God's will. Hallelujah.
[12:05] God's will is to save you.
[12:08] Amen.
[12:10] Praise God. Now remember, just here's
[12:13] some beautiful verses uh just to remind
[12:15] us of God's love. Micah 7:8 as we build,
[12:18] we're going to build this our way to
[12:20] this woman caught in the very act. Micah
[12:22] 7:18, "Who is a God like unto thee that
[12:26] pardoneth iniquity,
[12:29] and passeth by the transgression of the
[12:31] remnant of his heritage?"
[12:34] So he pardons it and then he passes by
[12:37] it.
[12:39] In other words, God just doesn't stay.
[12:40] Well, here's where brother Jesse did
[12:42] this or here's where brother Jose did
[12:44] this. God just doesn't stay. God passes
[12:46] by. God moves on. Oh my. If God moves
[12:49] on, why can't we move on? Hallelujah.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't see that till now. Jesus
[12:54] passes by your sin. So don't stay
[12:56] focused on your sin. Don't live in the
[12:58] past. Let it pass by it. Move on with
[13:01] Jesus. Say amen. WALK IN THE LIGHT AS
[13:04] he's in the light. Hallelujah.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; Walk past your failures of the past.
[13:08] Walk past it. Move beyond it. Jesus is
[13:11] moving beyond it. Why don't you move
[13:13] beyond it?
[13:15] Don't let the devil beat you up about
[13:17] your past. Just confess. Walk on in
[13:19] victory.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Onward Christian soldier marching as to
[13:25] war with the cross of Jesus going on
[13:28] before.
[13:32] What a beautiful verse.
[13:35] My goodness. And then Paul quotes this.
[13:38] I'm sorry. No, I'm reading the wrong
[13:39] one.
[13:41] He retainth not his anger forever. So,
[13:43] see, God will be angry at us if we sin
[13:46] on purpose for a short time. But God
[13:49] doesn't stay angry.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; It's the devil who stays angry at us,
[13:54] right?
[13:56] Hallelujah. Because why? Why? Why does
[13:58] God uh forgive us? Because he delights
[14:02] in mercy.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; God loves to show mercy.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh church, don't you delight
[14:10] when police show mercy to you when you
[14:12] speed?
[14:13] Don't you delight in that? I do. I've
[14:16] been guilty a couple times. I'm slam on
[14:18] my brake. I'm like, "Oh, thank God he
[14:19] didn't pull me over, whether he saw me
[14:21] or not. Thank God. I'm glad he delighted
[14:23] in mercy." And the church said, "And if
[14:26] that's how we feel in the natural, what
[14:27] about the spiritual?" Hallelujah. What
[14:30] about the God cop or the God police
[14:32] officer, THE JUDGE OF ALL THE EARTH, THE
[14:34] police officer of the entire universe?
[14:36] He delights to show us mercy. But then
[14:38] he wants to see that we appreciate that
[14:41] mercy. He wants to see us walk in
[14:43] obedience to the word of God. In other
[14:45] words, next time, stop speeding.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. We all delight in mercy. Uh
[14:53] we all delight that God delights in
[14:55] mercy, but let's not take advantage of
[14:57] that mercy,
[14:59] right? Amen.
[15:02] I love this. God delights. God loves to
[15:05] show mercy.
[15:07] Look at verse 19. He will turn again. So
[15:10] when he gets angry, it's as if he turned
[15:11] his back on us. But when we repent, he
[15:13] delights to turn around and say, he'll
[15:15] turn again to us. I want to have
[15:17] compassion on you, bride.
[15:20] He will subdue our iniquities. Isn't
[15:22] that beautiful? He'll subdue our
[15:23] iniquities.
[15:25] Hallelujah. He'll help us overcome our
[15:27] iniquities. Hallelujah.
[15:30] And thou will cast all their sins into
[15:33] the depths of the sea. Hallelujah. And
[15:35] the church said,
[15:37] &gt;&gt; "Oh my." Now look at that church. And he
[15:39] passes by them. And not only Chris does
[15:42] he pass by them, after he passes by, he
[15:44] throws them in the in the sea. That way
[15:46] if we go back, we can't find them.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[15:52] So don't go back and try to find your
[15:53] past sins. Confess them and say, "I was
[15:56] guilty, but I accept forgiveness. I
[15:59] believe I'm justified by faith that the
[16:01] blood forgives me. I'm moving past my
[16:04] past.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; My past is in the sea of forgetfulness
[16:08] because God delights in forgiving me
[16:10] because I'm a child of God." Amen. Yes,
[16:14] he's angry at me for a short time, but
[16:16] then he delights in mercy. Then after
[16:18] he's angry, he's compassionate to me.
[16:20] Just like a good father that'll spank
[16:22] you or a good mother that'll spank you.
[16:23] But then after the spanking, then
[16:25] they're kind again. Right? They show
[16:28] compassion on their children.
[16:32] Beautiful verse. Now, you know, I
[16:34] couldn't skip that one. Hallelujah.
[16:36] Glory to God. Amen.
[16:41] Uh Psalm 130:es 3 and 4. Let's review
[16:44] this one. Just a beautiful verse here.
[16:46] Remember
[16:49] friends,
[16:52] you know, often times the devil tries to
[16:54] get us to compare ourselves to other
[16:55] people. Well, I'm just not as spiritual
[16:58] as Malachi or I'm just not as spiritual
[17:00] as uh so and so. Put put anybody in
[17:03] there. I'm just not as spiritual as
[17:06] Jose, right? Or you could put anybody in
[17:08] there. But the Bible says again, all
[17:11] have fallen short of the glory of God.
[17:13] I'm I'm trying to get you in the in the
[17:15] mindset to put yourself in that woman
[17:17] who's caught in the very act of it.
[17:21] So imag you know, think about when
[17:23] you've sinned and what if somebody would
[17:24] just open the door and there you are
[17:25] doing this awful sin,
[17:29] right? Which is I'm sure it's happened
[17:30] to all of us to some degree. But Psalm
[17:32] 130:3 says, "But if thou Lord shouldest
[17:35] mark iniquities, oh Lord, who shall
[17:38] stand?" In other words, no one's going
[17:40] to stand. If God kept a tally mark for
[17:43] every time you sinned, nobody would be
[17:45] able to stand and say, "Well, I don't
[17:46] have any tally marks." Nobody could do
[17:48] that.
[17:51] But thank God there is forgiveness with
[17:54] thee that thou mayest be feared. See,
[17:57] that's what I said about the cop and go
[17:59] and speeding. If if if if he delighted
[18:02] or she if he delighted to show mercy on
[18:05] me when I was speeding, the next time
[18:06] you better be better be sure unless I'm
[18:08] forgetful, I'm going to drive not as
[18:10] fast.
[18:12] Because now I fear that cop, right? And
[18:15] I realize, well, he could have got me
[18:16] for $180 or 200, whatever it may be. He
[18:19] could have got me, but now I fear now
[18:22] I'm careful how I live my life or how I
[18:24] drive. Praise God.
[18:28] But remember, there's forgiveness.
[18:30] There's forgiveness because Jesus takes
[18:32] your sin, throws it in the sea of
[18:34] forgetfulness, and goes way down all the
[18:36] way to the bottom. Hallelujah. And then
[18:38] he moves past it. In other words,
[18:40] there's no record for it. It's all been
[18:43] forgiven. You're forgiven. You're
[18:45] justified by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Ram said, "It's as if
[18:50] you never did in the first place because
[18:52] he throws in the sea of forgetfulness
[18:54] and moves past it and it's no longer
[18:56] there."
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Now, we know we did it and we know God
[19:00] has forgiven us, but it's it's as though
[19:02] that's what justification is. You're
[19:04] declared righteous as you'd wish to be.
[19:06] I'd wish to be 100% clean. Well, that's
[19:08] what God gives us. Hallelujah.
[19:11] It's as if you never did it. Now, we
[19:13] know we did it, but it's as if the
[19:15] forgiveness is so pure. Amen. The
[19:18] forgiveness is so divine. Hallelujah.
[19:20] That you're given the very righteousness
[19:22] of Jesus Christ who never sinned to
[19:24] begin with.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Now, the battle for us is Hebrews
[19:33] chapter 12. I preached on it last year.
[19:35] Hebrews chapter 12.
[19:38] The Bible tells us to lay aside the sin
[19:41] that so easily besets us.
[19:46] And this is what we often have trouble
[19:48] forgiving ourselves.
[19:52] The Bible says, uh, "Wherefore, seeing
[19:54] we also are encompassed about with so a
[19:56] great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay
[19:58] aside every weight and the sin which
[20:01] does so easily beset us, and let us run
[20:04] with patience the race that is set
[20:06] before us. looking unto Jesus, the
[20:08] author and finisher of our faith, who
[20:10] for the joy that was set before him,
[20:12] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[20:15] and is set down at the right hand of the
[20:17] throne of God. Amen. Let's let's let's
[20:20] remember that message if we can uh from
[20:22] last year.
[20:25] Although we're forgiven, we still have
[20:27] sins that easily trip us up. Right
[20:32] now, remember, all of that's been
[20:33] forgiven as well. As long as we confess
[20:35] it, it's all been forgiven. Hallelujah.
[20:39] And God is faithful. Uh he knows we're
[20:42] going to stumble on the run.
[20:45] You know, my wife and I go walking and
[20:48] uh we go walking at the park on on our
[20:49] date date times during the spring and
[20:51] summer and fall and almost every week I
[20:54] stumble on something, right? It's a root
[20:56] or a rock. I stumble. Now, thank God I
[20:59] haven't done a face plant yet. But in
[21:01] the spiritual, I have done spiritual
[21:03] face plants. And so have you if you're
[21:05] honest,
[21:07] but that that's the imagery. Every time,
[21:09] Brother Austin, I go walking, I stumble
[21:11] on something every time because I'm
[21:12] tired. It's the end of the day. I forget
[21:14] to pick up my toes. Then I got to start
[21:16] picking up my toes as I walk. Make sure
[21:18] I don't because I get tired and just
[21:20] don't pick up my toes. And so it that
[21:23] that's the way it is in the natural. But
[21:25] think think about that, Brother Chris.
[21:26] How many steps do I go before I trip? I
[21:28] might go a thousand steps. Right? And
[21:31] that's what God wants to see in our
[21:32] life. God knows we're going to easily be
[21:34] beset. We're going to just make a a
[21:36] simple stumble, but he wants to see us
[21:38] take more steps where we don't stumble.
[21:40] Hallelujah.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[21:43] That and that's the love of God. God
[21:45] knows we're not going to be perfect.
[21:46] We're running a race. Every good runner
[21:48] stumbles. Every good runner gets weary.
[21:51] Hallelujah. And the Bible says, "But
[21:53] when we sin, it's like we put a weight
[21:55] upon ourselves, and that makes it harder
[21:57] to run." So the Bible says, "Don't cast
[22:00] off all these cares. Cast off all your
[22:02] anxieties, and you'll run a lot better
[22:04] as you serve the Lord.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Cast them off." Hallelujah.
[22:10] We're so easily beset. But let me say
[22:12] this, it just kind of struck my heart.
[22:13] We're so easily beset into sin, but let
[22:16] us also so easily accept God's
[22:18] forgiveness.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:22] and then have the fear of the Lord.
[22:25] Hallelujah. Where we don't want to be
[22:27] caught in the sin anymore.
[22:30] Hallelujah.
[22:33] Now, I'd like to go back to John 8. Now,
[22:36] let's start my context here. That's
[22:38] about a 20 minute foundation and
[22:42] introduction. Hallelujah.
[22:45] And it's been a long time since I
[22:46] preached on this woman uh caught in
[22:48] adultery. I don't I don't know how many
[22:49] years. I didn't look it up.
[22:51] uh John 8 vers1
[22:54] Jesus went unto the mount of olives and
[22:57] early in the morning he came again into
[22:59] the temple and all the people came unto
[23:01] him and he sat down and taught them
[23:06] now Jesus Christ is the same what
[23:10] okay so look look how humble he is
[23:12] here's God of the universe and what does
[23:14] God of the universe do well sometimes he
[23:17] just sits down and he teaches you the
[23:18] word of God other times He's got big
[23:21] meetings and miracles and everything
[23:22] happening. Thank God for those times.
[23:25] But Jesus here, he just sits down in the
[23:28] church. Glory. And he teaches you the
[23:30] word of God. Hallelujah.
[23:32] Is that right? Now, that's what we have
[23:34] the most of, right? Because we don't
[23:35] have a whole lot of big special
[23:36] meetings. It's hard to afford it, first
[23:38] of all, and we don't have a lot of room
[23:39] for it either. Amen. We still want to
[23:43] have them though by God's grace. Amen.
[23:46] But notice Jesus likely. And now some
[23:49] historians believe that perhaps Jesus
[23:51] just slept on the Mount Olives because
[23:53] that's what they would do in those days.
[23:54] They would just sleep outside. I was
[23:56] reminded remember when Jacob left home
[23:58] and he went and slept and he slept his
[24:00] pillow was a rock. He just slept right
[24:03] out under the stars. You know, imagine
[24:04] Jacob
[24:06] the father of Israel, right? Or I'm
[24:08] sorry, the father of the people of
[24:09] Israel. He was Israel. Amen. And he just
[24:11] sleeps out on the rock, you know. So
[24:13] it's likely Jesus would teach, you know,
[24:15] in this time he would teach in the
[24:16] temple and go up there, sleep at Mount
[24:18] Olives and wake up in the morning, go
[24:20] down there and start teaching again on
[24:22] the word of God.
[24:24] Hallelujah.
[24:28] There's also uh if you pull up pull up
[24:30] uh Luke 21:37, we also get the same uh
[24:33] idea
[24:36] that he would do this. uh and in the
[24:38] daytime he was teaching in the temple
[24:40] and at night he went out and abodeed in
[24:41] the mount that is called the mount of
[24:44] olives. So they just had places where
[24:45] people could just sleep publicly right
[24:48] and so the lord is doing this now
[24:51] previously in the previous chapter Jesus
[24:53] was there at the temple for the feast of
[24:55] tabernacles.
[24:58] So again, remember Jesus never missed
[24:59] church and the church said
[25:02] all men were required to appear
[25:04] themselves three times a year, right?
[25:06] Those three feasts, the Passover,
[25:09] uh feast of weeks, and then feast of
[25:11] tabernacles. Three times a year they
[25:13] were called. And so Jesus obeys the
[25:15] written word of Moses because he was the
[25:17] word. Hallelujah. Praise God. He was the
[25:20] word. So he comes and then he says, "If
[25:22] any man thirst, let him come unto me."
[25:24] And he wasn't talking about right then.
[25:26] he was talking about on the day of
[25:27] Pentecost.
[25:29] So, he was speaking prophetically,
[25:32] but this is maybe sometime after. They
[25:34] think this is either two years into his
[25:36] ministry or his final year of ministry.
[25:38] Uh it's hard to tell,
[25:41] but notice he gets up early in the
[25:43] morning to teach the people. And church,
[25:45] if you want to be taught by God, you got
[25:47] to get up early and seek God.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; We've been through that with Brother
[25:50] Rod's testimony. Uh it's my testimony,
[25:53] Adam's testimony. Uh, that ought to be
[25:55] all of our testimony. You got to get up
[25:57] early in the morning and seek God.
[26:00] Hallelujah.
[26:02] That that's what Jesus did. Jesus got up
[26:05] early to go pray. Even after great
[26:06] miracles and revival, he got up early to
[26:09] pray. You've got to bring your body into
[26:11] obedience to the word of God.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Make your body obey the word of God.
[26:15] Then watch how much easier life is.
[26:18] Hallelujah. Watch how much easier the
[26:20] race is without all the weights on you.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:24] Now verse three.
[26:27] Hallelujah. Verse three. And the scribes
[26:30] and the Pharisees. Who is it? These
[26:32] self-righteous ones. These are the same
[26:35] group. Jesus in the next year or so is
[26:37] going to call them you wided supplers.
[26:41] In other words, you bright shining
[26:43] church building. He said, but inward
[26:45] you're full of dead men's bones.
[26:51] Jesus did not play around with serpent
[26:53] seed. Hallelujah.
[26:56] Even later on in this chapter, John
[26:58] chapter 8.
[27:00] And it's such a striking, we'll get to
[27:02] that. It's such a striking contrast of
[27:04] the Lord Jesus Christ. He's so kind and
[27:07] merciful to this adulterous woman. And
[27:09] then that so he's like the lamb there.
[27:11] Amen. And then he comes out like a lion
[27:13] against these Pharisees and scribes.
[27:16] Hallelujah.
[27:18] And the Bible said, uh, to the froward,
[27:21] he will be forward. To the merciful, he
[27:24] will show himself merciful. Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you're a merciful
[27:28] person, if you're a kind, forgiving
[27:29] person, God will be kind to you.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; But if you're fro and mean and prideful
[27:35] to others, then God will be frowward to
[27:37] you because whatever a man sws, that's
[27:40] what he reaps.
[27:44] Yes, sir.
[27:46] And the Bible said the scribes and
[27:48] Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
[27:50] in adultery and when they had set her in
[27:54] the midst. Hallelujah.
[27:57] So notice
[27:59] these scribes and Pharisees had caught
[28:02] her in the very act of it and they came
[28:05] and set this woman in the midst of Jesus
[28:08] and all these people that just came to
[28:11] hear the word of the Lord. They just
[28:13] came to church to be taught the word of
[28:15] God.
[28:17] And then all of a sudden, these
[28:18] self-righteous hypocrites, we'd say,
[28:22] these self-righteous uh Pharisees or
[28:26] serpent seed, they try to break up
[28:28] Jesus's teaching lesson, and they bring
[28:30] an immoral woman right in the midst of
[28:32] them. That's what the devil's always
[28:34] trying to do. Break up a good teaching,
[28:37] right? Hallelujah. He's always trying to
[28:40] do that. break up a good message and try
[28:42] to bring some confusion in there.
[28:45] And remember church, who's the accuser
[28:47] of the brethren? Satan's the accuser of
[28:49] the brethren. Jesus is trying to give
[28:52] his his children wisdom, insight,
[28:54] revelation, instruction.
[28:58] And Satan, now remember church, Satan
[29:00] was allowed by God to do this. So Satan
[29:04] went to God
[29:06] and got permission from God to do this,
[29:08] right? Because nothing can happen unless
[29:10] God allows it. So God said, "Okay." He
[29:13] said, "My son," the father said, "My son
[29:15] will pass the test." Hallelujah. Amen.
[29:17] Hallelujah.
[29:19] Amen.
[29:21] And now, we don't know with this woman,
[29:23] you know, we don't know if she was
[29:24] forced into a life of prostitution or
[29:27] adultery here or if she willingly did
[29:30] it. But it doesn't matter. She was still
[29:32] doing the act. Now, the Bible said in
[29:35] the Old Testament, the woman if she was
[29:36] going to be forced upon, right? And I'm
[29:39] using that word just for the sake of the
[29:41] children. If she was going to be forced
[29:42] upon, she would cry out and then God
[29:44] would have mercy on her. In other words,
[29:46] cry out if you're being forced upon. So,
[29:48] we don't know if she was crying out or
[29:50] not. We don't know. In other words, we
[29:51] don't know if she purposely did this or
[29:53] she was forced to do it. We don't know.
[29:56] But either way, she's caught in the very
[29:58] act of adultery.
[30:01] And they set her in the midst of Jesus
[30:05] and this teaching lesson. And boy, I say
[30:08] like this, they're about to get a good
[30:09] lesson. Amen. Hallelujah. A good lesson
[30:13] on mercy, a good lesson ON FORGIVENESS
[30:15] AND LOVE AND AND THE GRACE OF GOD.
[30:17] HALLELUJAH. NEITHER DO I condemn thee.
[30:20] That's the title of the message.
[30:21] Hallelujah.
[30:23] In other words, this woman is caught in
[30:25] the very act
[30:28] and then condemned in the presence of
[30:31] Jesus and the saints.
[30:35] Hallelujah.
[30:38] What a what a text. What a what a what a
[30:41] situation here. My now would respond if
[30:44] that happened today. Now, it doesn't
[30:46] sometimes what if a woman walks in here,
[30:48] she's sexy dressed. I mean, just throw
[30:50] just throw showing everything. How would
[30:53] we treat her? Well, first of all, I try
[30:55] not to look at her at all. I'd be
[30:57] preaching, looking at Malachi. Glory,
[30:59] glory.
[31:02] Right
[31:03] now, somebody had the real humility,
[31:05] they might hand her a blanket, say,
[31:07] "Sister, could you wear this here?"
[31:10] That take a lot of grace and love. And
[31:11] she might walk out.
[31:14] But how would we, you know, uh, how
[31:17] would we treat somebody if if or let's
[31:19] say like this, let's say, let's say on
[31:21] Saturday we're heard that somebody got
[31:22] arrested. Somebody in our church, let's
[31:23] say, got arrested and then they walk in
[31:25] the door on Sunday morning.
[31:31] It's kind of like the elephant in the
[31:32] room, right?
[31:35] What's Yeah. Right. Did they break out
[31:36] of jail? What is Brother Jesse gonna say
[31:38] about this guy?
[31:41] Do I shake his hand or her hand or not?
[31:43] they were in prison, you know, my
[31:45] goodness, they got arrested.
[31:47] And so, you know, we got to uh we have
[31:49] to put ourselves in that position. What
[31:51] would you have done? And I like what
[31:53] these these these listeners did. They
[31:55] just let Jesus do all the talking. Amen.
[31:57] Oh, hallelujah. WHAT A LESSON. LET'S LET
[32:00] THE WORD TALK. HALLELUJAH.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Let's give place to THE WORD OF GOD.
[32:04] HALLELUJAH. Let's give the word
[32:06] preeminence in every service.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; It's a great lesson.
[32:11] Verse
[32:13] four. And they said to him, "Master,
[32:15] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[32:18] very act." That means she she must have
[32:20] been naked. And so they threw some
[32:22] blankets around her. So here she comes.
[32:23] Now imagine she probably got blankets
[32:25] and she's just covered up in blankets.
[32:26] Nothing underneath. Just blankets. And
[32:29] they throw her down on the ground and
[32:30] she's trying to get scrambled up,
[32:32] covered back up. I wonder if her husband
[32:35] was there.
[32:39] I wonder where her husband was at.
[32:41] She was in adultery.
[32:45] Now church, just like David, and this is
[32:47] what I want to get to as well, this
[32:48] woman was going to have to live with the
[32:50] consequences, the natural consequences.
[32:54] She forever have to live with that,
[32:57] right? She can't, like brother says, you
[32:58] can't be justified from the consequences
[33:01] of sin,
[33:04] right?
[33:06] But you'll be you you can be forgiven
[33:07] and justified from the spiritual damage
[33:10] you've done, but not the physical and
[33:12] the and the effects of it here on this
[33:14] side. Right? Like David, he always had
[33:17] to live with the consequences of his
[33:19] adultery and murder. Always had to live
[33:21] with it. But God had already pardoned it
[33:23] in heaven.
[33:26] In other words, this woman could have
[33:27] known, I'm facing divorce, and that
[33:30] would have been justified by the law.
[33:32] She also could have faced the stoning,
[33:33] but we know what what happened there,
[33:35] right? Amen. We know what did happen
[33:37] there. Praise God. Amen. Thank God.
[33:41] And she would have lived with the shame
[33:42] of being, wow, she's the woman caught in
[33:44] the act. But church, aren't you glad
[33:46] that she was caught in it because now
[33:47] you can relate to that because we've all
[33:49] been caught in our sin.
[33:52] Someone and if you're a child, your
[33:53] parents at some time have caught you in
[33:55] a sin sometime.
[33:57] I've been caught in it, right? as a
[33:59] child, as adults, sometimes we get
[34:02] caught in it. We just try to hide
[34:03] quickly and make sure we weren't doing
[34:04] that or think of that or saying that and
[34:06] the church said,
[34:10] "But this woman forever, you know, will
[34:12] be that type of a woman and but but we
[34:14] all can relate to her because we all
[34:17] have fallen short of the glory of God."
[34:18] This is the same thing that Eve did. My
[34:22] same thing Eve caught in the very act,
[34:26] right?
[34:28] So, we see a uh a more modern example.
[34:32] This is 4,000 years later. We see
[34:34] another woman caught in a act of
[34:36] adultery.
[34:38] And I love it. Jesus Christ is the same
[34:41] yesterday, today, and forever. God
[34:43] didn't throw Adam and Eve away and say,
[34:45] "I'm done with you. I'm starting a new
[34:46] one." He said, "What I'll do is I'll
[34:48] forgive you. I'll have a lamb slain, and
[34:50] you'll wear the skins of that animal."
[34:52] Remember Genesis 3? God made skins for
[34:55] them. I'll cover your sin in your
[34:58] sacrifice. And that's what Jesus was
[35:00] going to do. Jesus would cover her sins,
[35:02] the woman caught in his righteousness,
[35:05] his own blood. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory.
[35:12] So here we see a we see a a experience
[35:15] or we see a a repeat of Eve in uh John
[35:19] chapter 8. We see how God again deals
[35:22] with sin. He offers mercy if the
[35:24] believer wants mercy. How many want
[35:27] God's mercy today? Hallelujah.
[35:30] Amen.
[35:32] In the very act.
[35:35] In other words, totally guilty. No need
[35:37] to have a a a trial on this one. She was
[35:41] caught in the very We're all witnesses
[35:42] of it.
[35:45] Verse five. Now Moses in the law
[35:48] commanded us that such should be stoned,
[35:52] but what sayaest thou? So case put up
[35:54] Leviticus 20 verse 10.
[36:04] And the man that committh adultery with
[36:05] another man's wife, even he that
[36:08] committh adultery with his neighbor's
[36:09] wife, the adulter and the adulteress
[36:13] shall surely be put to death.
[36:17] So no doubt this could have been the
[36:18] verse or some similar one maybe in
[36:20] Deuteronomy
[36:22] that they were referring to and and they
[36:24] say Jesus Moses said this what do you
[36:27] say
[36:29] and Jesus could have said well I said
[36:30] that I gave that to Moses right that's
[36:34] what he could have said you got that
[36:36] from the law I am the law I'm also the
[36:38] PROPHETS I'M ALSO GRACE hallelujah
[36:41] &gt;&gt; I'm grace and truth I'm full of grace
[36:42] and truth hallelujah amen And
[36:46] Jesus going to say, "That's what I
[36:47] wrote."
[36:49] Glory to God.
[36:51] But what do you say about it?
[36:55] They tried to set a trap for Jesus. Are
[36:57] you going to deny the word? Uh, no,
[37:00] devil. There's just more word that
[37:01] you're not you're not bringing to the
[37:02] the table. You're trying to isolate one
[37:05] verse. And the church said in the mouth
[37:09] of tr two or three ver uh scriptures
[37:11] verses let every word be established.
[37:15] Amen. Hallelujah. See how Satan is
[37:17] trying to uh twist the word,
[37:19] misinterpret the word of God. That's
[37:21] what all these tape worshippers do. They
[37:23] bring one quote. I and I always say but
[37:25] there's brother Rama also said this just
[37:28] like Jesus. It is also written.
[37:31] Hallelujah.
[37:33] There's always see there the devil is
[37:34] trying to get you to just focus on one
[37:36] verse and he takes it out of context.
[37:38] This is true. But Satan takes it out of
[37:40] context. Notice he leaves something out.
[37:42] So that means his name of course will
[37:44] will be taken out. He never had his name
[37:46] on the book of life. In other words, he
[37:47] lost eternal life when he went to the
[37:49] other side. I'm talking about Lucifer.
[37:52] When he turned on God and deceived those
[37:54] a third of the angels, he had no longer
[37:56] had it. Right? He was perfect in the day
[37:58] that he was created. But his pride
[38:00] exalted himself. His beauty exalted
[38:02] himself and therefore eternal life was
[38:04] taken from him.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:09] That's right. That's the word of God.
[38:13] God is gracious. God is merciful.
[38:15] Hallelujah.
[38:17] So, we can see here that uh the
[38:19] accusers, Satan and all these accusers,
[38:23] they bring a verse, but they don't obey
[38:26] all the verse. Hallelujah. And church,
[38:29] that's what we got to make sure. We got
[38:31] to make sure we obey every verse.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is there anything else that
[38:37] talks about your situation?
[38:39] Let me spend some time praying about it.
[38:42] Let me spend some time seeking God about
[38:44] this situation. But what does Satan want
[38:47] to do? Uh, put pressure on you. Make a
[38:48] choice. Make a decision. You always have
[38:50] the right to say, "I need time to seek
[38:52] God's will." Brother Chris
[39:02] uh not exactly about adulterers but
[39:05] there is grace all throughout the Old
[39:07] Testament. Yeah. Remember Nehemiah said
[39:09] God has given us or Ezra Nehemiah said
[39:11] God has given us a little space of grace
[39:14] to come to leave Babylon and come back
[39:16] to the promised land. Uh yeah that's
[39:19] right. Now the the main word used in the
[39:21] Old Testament is uh mercy. God gives you
[39:24] less than what you deserve. But there is
[39:26] grace used a few times like I think the
[39:28] Bible said Noah found grace in the sight
[39:30] of the Lord if I'm not mistaken. So
[39:32] yeah, grace and forgiveness. Now I can't
[39:34] think of one where Oh yeah, David's the
[39:35] one where the adulterer, right? David is
[39:37] the example where God could have killed
[39:39] him, right? But God showed grace.
[39:42] Yeah,
[39:44] great question. Give him two classes.
[39:46] Great question. Great question. That
[39:48] that's one for sure. Uh where an adulter
[39:51] was pardoned by God. That was David was
[39:53] pardoned.
[39:55] Great question, brother. Now notice they
[39:58] asking this. So they're not quoting the
[40:00] scripture for justice. They're quoting
[40:02] the scripture for condemnation. And
[40:04] church, that's what you and I need to
[40:06] do. We need to be able to quote the
[40:07] scripture for God's mercy on people's
[40:09] life. In other words, if someone's going
[40:12] to bring correction to you or you try to
[40:13] correct somebody, do it with a merciful
[40:16] spirit behind it.
[40:17] not to condemn them. These these
[40:19] demon-possessed Pharisees and scribes,
[40:21] they wanted to see that woman die. They
[40:23] wanted death, but Jesus was there to
[40:25] show mercy and grace and life.
[40:28] Hallelujah.
[40:30] Amen. In other words, we should want
[40:32] everybody to succeed, right? We should
[40:35] want everybody to go to heaven. That
[40:36] should be our desire. We shouldn't wish,
[40:38] boy, I hope this brother goes to hell. I
[40:40] hope this sister goes to hell. That
[40:41] that's the devil.
[40:43] God's spirit will say, "Oh, I hope this
[40:46] person gets saved somehow. I hope this
[40:48] person somehow gets the Holy Ghost and
[40:49] repents and gets sanctified and gets
[40:51] filled with the Holy Ghost and can live
[40:52] a prosperous life." We should have hope
[40:54] for other people. WE SHOULD WANT THE
[40:56] BEST FOR PEOPLE. Praise God.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; If God delights in mercy, so should his
[41:02] children delight in mercy.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; I hope this is speaking to somebody
[41:08] today. Praise God.
[41:10] So why they do this? Verse six, this
[41:13] they said tempting him. So the whole
[41:16] point of this question was to tempt him
[41:18] and try to get him to slip up and make a
[41:21] mistake
[41:24] that they might have to excuse him. Now
[41:26] church, look at these. These Pharisees,
[41:28] they would have known David, right? They
[41:29] would have known David's situation.
[41:32] They weren't ignorant of David.
[41:35] So they would have known there are times
[41:37] God does forgive adultery.
[41:40] Hallelujah.
[41:42] But see, the devil concocted up this
[41:44] plan. Oh, I'll set a trap. He'll deny
[41:46] that she's stoned. Uh and and and and
[41:49] then we'll say, "Oh, you're breaking
[41:50] Moses' law. Now you're guilty. Now we'll
[41:53] stone you, Jesus, because you call us
[41:56] all these names." And boy, did he call
[41:57] names.
[41:59] I've seen a meme one time and said,
[42:00] "Jesus never called names." And the
[42:03] other side he's calling them liars,
[42:06] hypocrites,
[42:07] children of the most uh high devil, you
[42:10] know, sons of the double the sons of
[42:12] hell, you know, all these names. Jesus
[42:15] was always calling them names, the
[42:18] serpent seed. Now,
[42:22] now church, but we don't always know who
[42:23] serpent seed.
[42:25] So, I'm not trying to get you to name
[42:27] call. I'm trying to get you to see Jesus
[42:28] treated the merciful one way and the
[42:31] arrogant and prideful. uh
[42:33] demon-possessed serpent sey people
[42:35] another way
[42:37] because God showed him, right? God
[42:39] showed him who would be saved and who
[42:40] wouldn't be saved. Right? Remember the
[42:42] Bible said God had showed Jesus. Jesus
[42:44] knew from the beginning that Judas would
[42:46] betray him. He knew from the beginning.
[42:49] And yet he never mistreated him. Right?
[42:52] Now, how would you treat somebody that
[42:54] betrays you and and even I mean if you
[42:57] know it's going to happen before or not?
[42:59] Right? Right? We need the love of Jesus
[43:01] Christ. No matter what people say,
[43:03] faithful to us, loyal to us, betray us,
[43:05] no matter what it is, let us have the
[43:07] love of Jesus Christ for them.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[43:13] Jesus, they didn't come to Jesus to
[43:14] learn like everybody else was there to
[43:16] learn. Why are you here today? Learn or
[43:19] to accuse? I hope you're here to learn.
[43:24] Jesus said, "Come and learn of me. I'm
[43:26] meek and lowly of heart."
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Verse
[43:33] six. This they said, tempting him that
[43:35] they might have to accuse him. But Jesus
[43:38] stooped down and with his finger wrote
[43:41] on the ground as though he heard them
[43:44] not. I love this. Jesus don't act like
[43:46] they're not even there. When the devil
[43:48] comes around, church, you don't got to
[43:50] acknowledge him there.
[43:55] If a dog's barking at you or a snake is
[43:57] uh hissing at you, do you have to
[43:59] acknowledge that? You can walk away. You
[44:02] can ignore it. And the church said,
[44:05] "Amen." Just because you know a
[44:07] temptation's there doesn't mean you have
[44:09] to acknowledge it.
[44:12] Right? Sometimes the Bible says if you
[44:13] resist him, he'll flee.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Just praise the Lord. Just give GOD
[44:18] GLORY. GET YOUR mind on Christ. Now the
[44:20] difference in this story is they keep
[44:21] bringing they won't leave. They keep
[44:22] hanging around and they got to be dealt
[44:24] with. The church, you'll see it in your
[44:27] life. If you just act like it's not
[44:29] there, if you just forget about that
[44:30] temptation, it will go away.
[44:34] Hallelujah. And Jesus act like they're
[44:36] not even there. What is it? And I love
[44:38] this. He stoops down. What is stooping
[44:39] down? Humility,
[44:41] right? Devil's trying to get him in a
[44:43] trap. Church, what do we got to do? We
[44:44] got to stoop down and be humble, too,
[44:48] right? But for us, it's going to be pray
[44:50] or yeah, we can write the word on the
[44:52] ground, too. That's a good idea, too. We
[44:54] can express God's word. That's what he's
[44:56] doing. He's expressing himself on the
[44:58] earth. Glory.
[45:00] We should get on the earth and pray as
[45:02] well. Hallelujah. Now, he wasn't
[45:03] praying, but the point is we can soup
[45:04] down and pray.
[45:08] Hallelujah. So, first Jesus ignores them
[45:12] and he starts writing on the ground.
[45:14] Now, there's at least four possibilities
[45:16] of what he could have wrote. I'm not
[45:18] here to say what I think or to say for
[45:20] sure what he did write, but I'll tell
[45:22] you what I think. Uh the the first one,
[45:24] I think, is what he wrote was Leviticus
[45:27] 20:10.
[45:28] Uh I I I believe Jesus just wrote the
[45:31] word of God down there. He could have
[45:33] wrote that. Now, another one acacia is
[45:34] Deuteronomy 22:22. If you want to write
[45:37] that one down,
[45:39] I'm sorry, if you want to put that one
[45:40] up there. Deuteronomy 22:22.
[45:47] If a man be found lying with a woman
[45:49] married to a husband, then they shall
[45:52] both of them die. Both the man that lay
[45:54] with the woman and the woman, so shalt
[45:56] thou put away evil from Israel. And
[45:58] remember this was written well before
[45:59] David was on the scene. Well, why does
[46:01] David get a pardon? Because God spoke
[46:03] the pardon. Remember Nathan said, he
[46:06] said, "But but you won't die." REMEMBER,
[46:08] SURELY YOU WON'T DIE, DAVID. Because
[46:10] David was worried, I'm going to die. I'm
[46:12] going to die. And but Nathan says, "In
[46:14] the name of the Lord, you won't die."
[46:16] So God gave mercy.
[46:19] Hallelujah.
[46:20] Church, we better hope for the mercy of
[46:22] God.
[46:24] And church, I'll say like this. You can
[46:25] freely give David mercy if you
[46:27] understand how guilty you are when you
[46:29] want mercy as well. I'm glad God was
[46:32] merciful to David because I want God to
[46:34] be merciful to me.
[46:36] I want the spirit of the bride la that
[46:37] we heard last Sunday night and the
[46:39] church said the spirit of bride is this
[46:41] bride is after Jesus's own heart. The
[46:44] will of Jesus Christ.
[46:47] David was a man after God's own heart.
[46:49] We should be a bride after our husband's
[46:51] very heart.
[46:53] Hallelujah.
[46:55] So that's what I believe he wrote. I
[46:56] believe he wrote something like uh
[46:58] Leviticus 20:10, Deuteronomy 22 verse
[47:02] 22.
[47:04] Or maybe he wrote, here's some other
[47:05] ones he might have wrote as well. By
[47:07] God's grace,
[47:09] uh
[47:11] let's put uh Exodus 23 1-2.
[47:15] He could have wrote a verse that
[47:17] condemned them for their hypocrisy.
[47:20] Thou shalt not raise a false report,
[47:23] right? And put not thine hand with the
[47:26] uh wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
[47:28] Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do
[47:30] evil. So there it is.
[47:33] They're doing evil because they're
[47:35] trying to get her killed and they're
[47:37] forgetting the mercy of God. They're
[47:38] trying to get rid of God's mercy.
[47:42] Neither shalt thou speak in a cause to
[47:44] decline after many to they're twisting
[47:46] judgment. And church, we know what what
[47:48] was the twist. The man wasn't brought,
[47:51] only the woman. Sounds like people today
[47:54] that just want to condemn women never
[47:55] condemn men. All men and women need
[47:57] condemned if they're sinning.
[47:59] Hallelujah.
[48:01] We just heard it last week, Brother Dale
[48:03] talked about how Jesus loves women so
[48:05] much, right? The Bible said there's
[48:06] neither male nor female in Christ, WHICH
[48:09] THAT WAS A SHOCK IN the Bible days
[48:11] BECAUSE WOMEN COULDN'T EVEN TESTIFY in
[48:13] court. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN TRUST A woman
[48:14] in a courtroom in Jesus' day. But now
[48:17] Paul puts them on the same. You can
[48:19] trust a Holy Ghost fil.
[48:23] You're going to want to marry one,
[48:24] brother. You too, brother. Hallelujah.
[48:27] You too, brother Chris. you're going to
[48:29] want to marry a Holy Ghost filled woman.
[48:31] Hallelujah. Thank God.
[48:36] And so there Jesus could have wrote one
[48:38] of these verses. Now he's the word. All
[48:41] he could have wrote was the word. Amen.
[48:44] So he's writing some word. Hallelujah.
[48:48] We're not told what it is, but it was
[48:50] something in the word. Praise God.
[48:53] Now, some people some people think he
[48:55] wrote the names of the accusers,
[48:58] which was Jeremiah 17:13. I never saw
[49:00] this one till this morning as I was
[49:01] studying. Look at uh Jeremiah 17:13. Oh,
[49:05] you're so fast. Oh Lord, the hope of
[49:07] Israel, all that forsake thee shall be
[49:09] ashamed, and they that depart from me
[49:12] shall be written in the earth. Where was
[49:15] Jesus writing? In the earth,
[49:18] because they have forsaken the Lord, the
[49:21] fountain of living waters. So perhaps
[49:23] Jesus wrote those names, John Doe or
[49:26] Suzie Doe, whoever it was.
[49:29] Perhaps Jesus did that, too,
[49:33] and showed how they're the guilty ones.
[49:34] He was He could have wrote, "Actually,
[49:36] the ones who are guilty are right here."
[49:38] And maybe church, imagine they saw their
[49:40] name right there. Uh, brother John Doe
[49:42] was guilty of adultery last week. Maybe
[49:44] Jesus wrote that. Or maybe John Doe has
[49:47] been committing adultery ever since he
[49:49] got married for the last 20 years.
[49:52] Maybe Jesus wrote that. And notice they
[49:55] went from the oldest to the youngest
[49:57] when they left. So he probably wrote the
[49:58] if he did this, it was probably the
[50:00] oldest man. We've been doing it for
[50:01] probably 40, 50, 60 years. This old man,
[50:04] John Doe, has been an adulterer for 40
[50:07] years. Well, if he first saw his name,
[50:08] he would have quickly walked away. I
[50:10] don't want to get stoned.
[50:13] That's a good way to clean out people.
[50:14] Amen. That's a good way to get rid of a
[50:16] critical spirit. Show them where they're
[50:18] wrong. And the church said,
[50:21] Hallelujah. The devil wants to criticize
[50:24] you. Well, let me criticize you. Let me
[50:26] tell you what you've done. Let me tell
[50:28] you what Jesus HAS FORGIVEN ME OF.
[50:30] HALLELUJAH. Let me devil hang around.
[50:33] Let me testify about what Jesus Christ
[50:36] has done. How he's forgiven me. I'm
[50:38] justified by faith, NOT BY WORKS, NOT BY
[50:40] LAW. THE JUST ONE JUSTIFIED ME.
[50:43] HALLELUJAH.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Hang around, devil. Let me testify about
[50:46] Jesus. Hallelujah. Then he'll want to
[50:48] leave.
[50:51] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm feeling good.
[51:04] Some people think he might might have
[51:06] wrote words of mercy and forgiveness
[51:08] like the Micah 7:18 or something along
[51:11] from the Psalms about God rich in mercy.
[51:14] The fourth which I think is really
[51:16] beautiful. This this could be a part of
[51:18] it as well. Maybe not uh separate but
[51:22] part of the writing of the word. Uh
[51:24] Jesus could have uh well I believe this
[51:27] I believe this was true. If you pull up
[51:28] Exodus 31:18, God himself wrote the Ten
[51:33] Commandments with what? His finger.
[51:37] So God wrote the Ten Commandments on
[51:39] stone. Right?
[51:41] And he gave unto Moses when he made an
[51:43] end of communing with him upon Mount Si
[51:45] two tables of stone or two tables of
[51:48] testimony tables of stone written with
[51:50] the finger of God. So God was the
[51:53] lawgiver in the Old Testament. Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the lawgiver in the Old
[51:58] Testament. Amen. So this is Jesus
[52:01] stooping down to show I'm the one that
[52:03] wrote the law. I'm the one who
[52:05] interprets the law on this earth.
[52:07] Hallelujah. Amen. I wrote it on stone.
[52:10] I'm writing on THE GROUND AND THANK GOD
[52:12] TODAY HE'S WRITING IT ON THE FLESHLY
[52:14] TABLES OF YOUR HEART. PRAISE GOD.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost by the finger of God, the
[52:21] spirit of God wants to write the word of
[52:23] God on your heart today. Don't be
[52:25] hard-hearted. Don't Don't be a Don't be
[52:28] a sin lover. Confess your sins and let
[52:31] Jesus Christ write his word upon the
[52:33] fleshly tables of your heart.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Confess your heart of stone. If you're
[52:38] still in sin, confess that and say,
[52:40] "God, I don't want to be hard-hearted.
[52:42] Forgive me my sin. I want to be
[52:43] tenderhearted towards the gospel of
[52:45] Jesus Christ." Amen.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; You don't have to, you don't have to
[52:49] keep your heart of stone. Jesus can give
[52:51] you a heart of flesh today.
[52:58] This is a beautiful example. Jesus
[53:01] stoops to the dust just like Jesus
[53:04] stooped to the dust when he formed Adam,
[53:07] right? He stooped down to the dust and
[53:08] he pulled up out of the dust. So what
[53:10] could he be doing? He could be doing
[53:12] with a woman. He's stooping down to the
[53:14] dust, right? To build up a new person in
[53:17] Christ Jesus.
[53:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. So Jesus
[53:22] is riding just like he's the lawgiver,
[53:25] right? And now he's a creator of a new
[53:28] being. Praise God. He's making a new
[53:29] woman in Christ Jesus. Praise God.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Touching the dust. going to manipulate
[53:35] the dust to make a new creature in
[53:38] Christ Jesus.
[53:40] Hallelujah.
[53:42] Oh, it's beautiful.
[53:45] He came to write the law and he came to
[53:48] give it on tables of stone and now he
[53:51] comes to write it on the fleshly tables
[53:53] of our hearts, making us new creatures
[53:56] in Christ Jesus.
[53:58] If you are not a different person after
[54:01] you say you were saved or born again,
[54:03] it's time to check up and make sure
[54:05] you're not living a life of iniquity.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; The gospel should make you a new
[54:10] creature. The old things have to pass
[54:13] away.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Behold, all things become new.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; All things. Let's say all things. Ready?
[54:21] All things.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That's that that's worship. Worship
[54:24] becomes new.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Preaching becomes new. Your garments,
[54:28] your clothes become new,
[54:30] &gt;&gt; your friendships become new,
[54:32] &gt;&gt; right? Your work habits become new,
[54:35] &gt;&gt; your honesty becomes new, right? Your
[54:37] words out OF YOUR MOUTH, EVERYTHING IS
[54:39] NEW. PRAISE GOD.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; If not, it's time to repent of those
[54:42] sins
[54:44] and get your life lined up with God.
[54:48] And Jesus loves to do it. Praise God.
[54:52] Now church, whichever of these
[54:54] explanations it was,
[54:57] the truth is the same. The accusers were
[55:00] convicted one by one. Whatever he wrote
[55:04] on the ground convicted all of them, but
[55:06] it started with the oldest, right?
[55:08] Oldest always represents what? The
[55:09] wisest. So whatever word Jesus wrote,
[55:13] the wisest and oldest man first saw it,
[55:16] was convicted by that, and he walked
[55:18] away saying, "I'm I can't judge her. I'm
[55:21] wise enough not to judge her.
[55:24] I'm wise enough not to kill this woman."
[55:27] Why? Because all have fallen short of
[55:29] the glory of God.
[55:32] So recognize she was con they were
[55:34] convicted one by one, no matter what it
[55:36] was, no matter what he wrote.
[55:38] And here the woman was forgiven and then
[55:41] warned, which we'll get to in just a
[55:43] moment.
[55:45] Hallelujah.
[55:46] Now Jesus stooped down. Verse 7. So when
[55:49] they continued asking him, he lifted up
[55:51] himself and said, "He that is without
[55:53] sin among you, let him first cast a
[55:56] stone at her."
[56:00] So Jesus first bowed down and just
[56:02] started writing. And they keep asking,
[56:04] "Come on Jesus, what's your judgment?
[56:07] Come on." They w they wouldn't give up.
[56:08] They keep they kept seeking for
[56:10] condemnation.
[56:12] And so if something keeps hanging
[56:13] around, listen church, pretty soon
[56:15] you're going to have to speak to that
[56:16] devil.
[56:18] If a devil won't leave, you got to keep
[56:21] speaking to that devil till it does
[56:22] leave. That's what Jesus did. So he
[56:26] rightly divided the word of truth and he
[56:28] said, "Which of you, whichever of you
[56:30] have never committed adultery,
[56:31] especially those men, which of you have
[56:33] never committed adultery in your mind?
[56:37] Which of you have never thought about
[56:38] committing adultery? Which of you have
[56:40] never stolen? Which of you have never
[56:42] been CAUGHT IN SIN? GO AHEAD AND CAST
[56:44] the first stone.
[56:47] What a question.
[56:49] What a what a challenge.
[56:52] And church, they would have known about
[56:54] David was forgiven of his,
[56:56] right? They would have known about
[56:57] Solomon was forgiven of all his thousand
[56:59] wives,
[57:02] right?
[57:04] They would have known all these stories
[57:05] of people being forgiven us. We call we
[57:07] call today radical forgiveness. But
[57:10] really all of us are radically forgiven
[57:12] because we've all done many tally marks.
[57:14] If they if you marked all of our sins,
[57:16] church, it'd be too many to count. And
[57:18] the church said
[57:20] all of us need radical or total
[57:23] forgiveness. Praise God.
[57:25] Every person does.
[57:28] So I like that. Verse eight. And again
[57:31] he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
[57:33] So he wasn't done. Hallelujah.
[57:36] He stoops down, stands up, speaks the
[57:39] word, stoops down, and keeps manifesting
[57:41] him his words on the earth. Hallelujah.
[57:44] So it's the two stoopings of the son of
[57:47] man.
[57:48] I preached this years ago. But I believe
[57:51] these two stoopings are symbolic of
[57:54] Jesus first coming as son of man
[57:58] and his second coming as son of man and
[58:01] the second coming of the son of man was
[58:02] the ministry of William Brandham and the
[58:04] church said
[58:06] didn't didn't Luke 17:30 pope Luke 17:30
[58:08] this is one of brother's major verses
[58:12] as it was in days of Sodom as it was in
[58:14] days of Noah but look at Luke 17:30 even
[58:16] thus shall be when the who son of man is
[58:20] revealed. Jesus Christ revealed himself
[58:23] in a prophet. Now, we don't worship the
[58:24] prophet. He was a man. But the son of
[58:27] man, Jesus was showing that I'm going to
[58:29] send a prophet to the Gentiles before
[58:32] the great and notable day and judgment
[58:34] day of the Lord.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[58:38] Now, this made me shout. I remember I
[58:39] got this revelation in my bedroom, which
[58:42] is currently Haven and Carouses and the
[58:43] little girl. I remember I I paced for
[58:45] hours in that room. What does the two
[58:47] stoopings mean? What does the two
[58:48] stoopings mean? I was back and forth. I
[58:50] remember I was taking calls to and I
[58:52] remember just I was pacing back and
[58:53] forth. What does it mean? All of a
[58:54] sudden it struck me that song said, "Oh,
[58:56] HOW I LOVE HIM. OH, HOW I adore him. My
[58:59] breath, my sunshine, my all and all.
[59:01] Stooping to woo to win to save my soul."
[59:07] Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; So Jesus when he come to earth the first
[59:10] time, he stooped down from his heavenly
[59:12] throne and he expressed himself.
[59:15] Hallelujah. The word was written on the
[59:17] earth, but he had to stoop again. HE HAD
[59:20] TO COME in the form of a prophet in
[59:22] order to what? Justify the bride.
[59:26] What is Jesus doing? He's justifying the
[59:28] bride.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; So before, so Jesus HAD TO STOOP TWICE
[59:33] in order to justify the bride of Jesus
[59:35] Christ. He had to send the son of man to
[59:38] discern the thoughts intents of the Jews
[59:41] and the Samaritans during the Bible
[59:43] days. But now God sent the son of man to
[59:45] the Gentiles so we'd have a prophet so
[59:48] we'd know that Jesus had visited us and
[59:51] prepared us for his coming and so that
[59:54] we would know our sins would be
[59:55] forgiven.
[59:57] Cuz what is this about? THIS IS ABOUT A
[59:59] GUILTY WOMAN WHO'S an adulterer, but
[1:00:01] she's forgiven by Jesus. She's made pure
[1:00:04] by JESUS AND NOBODY CAN CONDEMN HER.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, that does something for me. Praise
[1:00:13] God. I believe that was the Holy Ghost
[1:00:15] that revealed that to me. The two
[1:00:17] comeings of the son of man, the two
[1:00:19] stoopings
[1:00:20] of Jesus Christ. And didn't he come down
[1:00:22] in Revelation 10? Didn't Jesus, THE
[1:00:25] MIGHTY ANGEL, COME DOWN? PRAISE GOD.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; TO finish the mystery of God.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Didn't he come down to
[1:00:33] finish the mystery of God? So that you
[1:00:35] would know neither do I condemn you.
[1:00:39] Neither do I condemn the believers in
[1:00:42] Bride of Christ Fellowship and the
[1:00:43] believers around the world.
[1:00:46] I don't condemn you either,
[1:00:50] church. The only one that condemn you or
[1:00:53] the only one that can condemn you is
[1:00:54] somebody who's not guilty of it. Right?
[1:00:57] Jesus.
[1:00:59] G Jesus uh is the only one who can
[1:01:01] condemn and he's the one that says, "I
[1:01:04] won't condemn you.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to condemn you.
[1:01:09] Neither am I. And hopefully nobody's
[1:01:10] here to condemn each other. We want to
[1:01:13] see everybody get victory. We want to
[1:01:15] see everybody walk in forgiveness.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; We want to see everyone delight in the
[1:01:22] mercy that God has delighted to give us.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Double delight. Amen.
[1:01:29] Hallelujah.
[1:01:32] Praise God. Verse nine. And when they
[1:01:34] had heard it, being convicted by their
[1:01:35] own conscience, went out one by one,
[1:01:38] beginning at the eldest, even to the
[1:01:39] last. And Jesus was left alone, and the
[1:01:42] woman standing in the midst. Now,
[1:01:44] church, I don't know if uh everybody
[1:01:47] left. I'm talking about even the
[1:01:48] faithful church members who were sitting
[1:01:50] there just to hear a teaching from
[1:01:51] Jesus. I don't know if they left as well
[1:01:54] or if it was just the uh the multitude
[1:01:56] of accusers. We don't know, right? We
[1:02:00] don't know. But somehow this story got
[1:02:02] back to John, right? And John wrote it
[1:02:04] faithfully.
[1:02:06] So we don't know. But it's written,
[1:02:08] church, for our admonition. It's written
[1:02:11] for us. There's my hour. It's written
[1:02:14] for us so that we would know even when
[1:02:16] we're caught in the very act. We don't
[1:02:19] have to accept the condemnation from the
[1:02:21] devil.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; We can also recognize that there is a
[1:02:27] word. There's the word here to forgive
[1:02:30] us.
[1:02:32] Hallelujah.
[1:02:39] And church, this is ultimately verse 9
[1:02:41] is ultimately what is future to come.
[1:02:45] When we stand before Jesus, it's not
[1:02:46] going to be even my wife and I. It's not
[1:02:48] going to be my wife and I standing
[1:02:50] there. I will stand by myself
[1:02:53] and Jesus will have to judge my life.
[1:02:57] Now, that's pretty that's a pretty uh
[1:03:00] sobering thought.
[1:03:02] I won't be able to hold my wife's hand
[1:03:04] or anything like that. It'll just be me.
[1:03:06] It'll just be you. Right, Victoria?
[1:03:09] Right, Caris? It'll just be you.
[1:03:12] You've got to walk up to Jesus all
[1:03:15] alone.
[1:03:18] We better help. We better hope for the
[1:03:20] mercy of God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:03:24] And I like I like this. Notice she don't
[1:03:26] she doesn't say anything. The guilty
[1:03:27] woman has nothing to say.
[1:03:30] She's just silent, just waiting. What is
[1:03:32] the judge going to say? What is Jesus
[1:03:34] going to say? And I love what he says.
[1:03:36] Hallelujah. Praise God. What is church?
[1:03:39] What is she expecting? What do you
[1:03:41] expect when you're caught in the very
[1:03:42] act of sin?
[1:03:44] What do you think she was expecting?
[1:03:46] Jesus say, "Uh, do you want to go get
[1:03:48] your husband?"
[1:03:49] That's what she said to the woman.
[1:03:50] That's what he said to the woman at the
[1:03:51] well,
[1:03:53] right?
[1:03:55] I wonder what she was expecting.
[1:03:59] And so we should learn from this that
[1:04:01] when we get alone with Jesus, Jesus,
[1:04:03] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:04:06] forever. Jesus will first show us mercy.
[1:04:11] Now, will there be consequences? Yes. As
[1:04:13] we said, would did this woman have to
[1:04:15] suffer consequences? No doubt about it.
[1:04:18] Now, church, if she was a godly woman,
[1:04:19] what she she what would she have done?
[1:04:21] She would have walked right home and
[1:04:22] confessed to her husband.
[1:04:25] Right, church?
[1:04:28] How do you know you're honest? And how
[1:04:29] do you know you're forgiven? You'll go
[1:04:31] right to the person you sinned against
[1:04:32] and say, "You're sorry."
[1:04:37] If she was honest, she would have said,
[1:04:39] "That's right. Thank you, Jesus. I'm had
[1:04:41] to write to my husband, hubby. Forgive
[1:04:43] me." And he could have said, "Okay, I'm
[1:04:44] writing you a bill of divorcement. You
[1:04:46] got to go back to your dad's house or
[1:04:47] whatever."
[1:04:49] And he would have been justified to do
[1:04:50] that.
[1:04:52] He could have put her away. Now, he
[1:04:53] could not have stoned her because Jesus
[1:04:54] had made the judgment. Right. Right.
[1:04:56] Jesus had showed that you can't cast a
[1:04:58] stone unless you're an innocent person
[1:05:01] and you've never committed anything like
[1:05:02] this. Right?
[1:05:05] So Jesus says these beautiful words. Oh,
[1:05:09] thank God. Hallelujah. He says, "Woman,"
[1:05:11] he doesn't call her by name. He just
[1:05:12] says, "Woman,
[1:05:15] where are those thine accusers?"
[1:05:20] That's what Jesus asked. "Where are your
[1:05:21] accusers?"
[1:05:23] What is she worried about? accusers.
[1:05:25] What does she worry about? Condemnation.
[1:05:30] So, we get this idea when we come in the
[1:05:32] presence of God, church, nobody can
[1:05:34] condemn us. The Bible even says in the
[1:05:37] book of Acts that the Jews judge
[1:05:39] themselves unworthy of everlasting life.
[1:05:41] And then that's why they blasphe the
[1:05:43] Holy Ghost. In other words, the choice
[1:05:46] is yours. Either accept forgiveness or
[1:05:48] blasphem the word of God.
[1:05:51] Right? The choice is ours. I'm choosing
[1:05:54] forgiveness today.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; You should choose forgiveness today.
[1:05:57] Praise God. Don't leave here a condemned
[1:05:59] person. Hallelujah. Jesus says, "Where
[1:06:02] are your accusers?"
[1:06:04] In other words, Jesus won't let Satan
[1:06:06] stay there. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, the voice of Satan
[1:06:10] should not be in your ear all the time.
[1:06:12] Just the voice of Jesus should be there.
[1:06:14] Praise God.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; So, I'll say like this. You just got to
[1:06:19] get so close to Jesus in prayer so you
[1:06:21] don't hear the voice of Satan anymore.
[1:06:28] So she's left alone with Jesus. Sound
[1:06:31] like a good prayer meeting to me,
[1:06:32] doesn't it? Sound like to you?
[1:06:34] Hallelujah.
[1:06:36] Glory.
[1:06:38] And notice she's standing. So maybe they
[1:06:39] threw her down, but now she's standing
[1:06:40] with that blanket wrapped around her.
[1:06:44] Now you've seen videos. She got makeup
[1:06:46] all over, hair's all frizzled, like
[1:06:47] she's been making love to some man. And
[1:06:50] that's the condition she's in. And Jesus
[1:06:52] says, "Where are your accusers?"
[1:06:55] Now, church, if she could be forgiven,
[1:06:57] and some of us have never even done
[1:06:58] this, why can't we accept forgiveness
[1:07:00] for ourselves?
[1:07:03] Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] Why can't we move on and accept the
[1:07:08] mercy of God and trust that what GOD HAS
[1:07:10] SAID, GOD will do?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. WHY CAN'T WE TRUST GOD? BECAUSE
[1:07:14] we're too busy listening to the lying
[1:07:16] the lying enemy all the time. But God's
[1:07:19] here to set us free today.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; There is a way out. There is victory in
[1:07:23] Jesus today. There's victory in Jesus,
[1:07:25] my savior forever. Amen. He sought me
[1:07:28] and he bought me with his redeeming
[1:07:30] love. Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's victory in Christ
[1:07:34] today.
[1:07:36] Am I doing on time? Okay. Glory.
[1:07:40] Now verse 10. Woman, where are thine
[1:07:42] accusers? Hath no man? You mean there's
[1:07:45] no one here to condemn you?
[1:07:48] So she thought the whole time, I'm going
[1:07:50] to be condemned. Everybody's here to
[1:07:51] condemn me. And Jesus, when the word
[1:07:53] comes, when the presence of Jesus is
[1:07:55] expressed, when the word comes forth,
[1:07:58] all the accusers leave and there's no
[1:08:01] more condemnation. Does that sound
[1:08:02] familiar? Romans 8:1, there is now
[1:08:05] therefore what? No condemnation to them
[1:08:08] that are in Christ. What is she in?
[1:08:10] She's in THE PRESENCE OF CHRIST. GLORY.
[1:08:13] If you can come IN THE PRESENCE OF
[1:08:14] CHRIST, THERE'S NO CONDEMNATION FOR YOU.
[1:08:18] AMEN.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; How do you get in the presence of
[1:08:20] Christ? Repent of your sins. Praise God.
[1:08:23] CONFESS YOUR SINS. THAT'S the spirit of
[1:08:25] God bringing conviction to you. That's
[1:08:27] the spirit of God coming to you to
[1:08:29] forgive you. That's how you get in the
[1:08:31] presence of Christ. Confess your sins.
[1:08:35] Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] Verse 11.
[1:08:44] And she said, "Neither." I'm sorry. And
[1:08:47] she said, "No man, Lord." So, we get a
[1:08:50] beautiful picture of what's happening in
[1:08:51] the spiritual realm. When you are in the
[1:08:54] presence of Jesus, there's no one there
[1:08:56] to condemn you. In other words, you
[1:08:59] don't have to accept the things the
[1:09:01] devils say.
[1:09:04] Because when she was in the presence of
[1:09:05] Jesus, there was no man, I'll say this,
[1:09:07] there's no devil to condemn her. And
[1:09:10] Jesus helped her to see that there's no
[1:09:12] one here to condemn you.
[1:09:15] Nobody nobody can condemn you if you're
[1:09:18] in the presence of Jesus.
[1:09:20] Hallelujah. It's impossible.
[1:09:24] There's no condemnation to them that are
[1:09:25] in Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:09:28] flesh but after the spirit.
[1:09:32] And she said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus
[1:09:35] said unto her, "Neither do I condemn
[1:09:37] thee. go and sin no more.
[1:09:41] So, here's where we get the fear, right?
[1:09:43] Like we talked about with driving fast
[1:09:45] and getting drive speeding tickets.
[1:09:47] Here's the fear of the Lord. Jesus says,
[1:09:49] "I forgive you freely,
[1:09:52] but don't do that again."
[1:09:55] Hallelujah. Go and sin no more. Don't
[1:09:58] get distracted by those handsome young
[1:10:00] men to commit adultery with them or
[1:10:03] those beautiful women. Don't be
[1:10:05] distracted by that. Don't do it again.
[1:10:08] That's the fear of God. That's the grace
[1:10:10] of God given to this woman. Go and sin
[1:10:13] no more. Now, don't forget the balance.
[1:10:15] We're so easily beset. But remember,
[1:10:18] there's many, many steps in between our
[1:10:19] stumblings. And the church said,
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; as you grow closer to Christ, there
[1:10:24] should be less stumbling, right? There
[1:10:27] should be less stumbling because I'm I'm
[1:10:29] stronger in Christ. I've learned more.
[1:10:31] I'm more uh I'm more I'm growing in
[1:10:33] grace and knowledge to the Lord.
[1:10:34] Hallelujah. I'm going from faith to
[1:10:37] faith, from glory to glory. Hallelujah.
[1:10:42] That's right. That's right.
[1:10:46] Now, this struck me this morning. Twice
[1:10:48] Jesus said this, "Go and sin no more."
[1:10:51] He said it to this woman in adultery,
[1:10:53] and he also said it in John chapter 5 to
[1:10:57] the lame man that Jesus healed. So,
[1:10:59] let's go to John 5:14.
[1:11:12] John 5:14 afterward Jesus findeth him in
[1:11:15] the temple. So, so this tells me that if
[1:11:17] God does something great for you, he's
[1:11:19] going to come remind you, hey, remember
[1:11:21] I did this for you. Don't go back into
[1:11:24] that sin. He's the same yesterday,
[1:11:26] today, and forever. So, this service,
[1:11:27] perhaps this service, brother Mercy, is
[1:11:29] God reminding us, remember what I did
[1:11:31] for you. Don't turn back into that.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Don't go back that way or else something
[1:11:36] worse is going to happen to you.
[1:11:39] Right? Because Jesus give Jesus gives
[1:11:40] forgiveness but then he gave a warning.
[1:11:43] You're I'm not condemning you woman.
[1:11:46] Go and sin no more. Hallelujah. And
[1:11:49] remember he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:11:51] and forever. So and afterward Jesus
[1:11:53] finding him in the temple say unto him,
[1:11:54] behold thou art made whole. Sin no more
[1:11:57] lest a worse thing come unto thee.
[1:12:02] church, you should rejoice if God's
[1:12:03] delivered you from addiction. You should
[1:12:05] rejoice in everything God's done for
[1:12:06] you. But remember, if you go back to
[1:12:08] that, you are going to suffer.
[1:12:11] Now, I can think of one example of where
[1:12:13] God miraculously healed this brother,
[1:12:15] and I'm I'm not going to I'm not trying
[1:12:16] not to give so many details, but I
[1:12:19] talked with him face to face last year
[1:12:20] on Easter last year 2024 on Easter
[1:12:25] morning. And he said, "Ever since God
[1:12:26] did that," he said, "I left the church
[1:12:28] and I've got worse off than I was
[1:12:30] before.
[1:12:32] He confessed that right to me in the
[1:12:34] prayer line.
[1:12:36] And I said, "That's what that is.
[1:12:39] If you don't give God the fear of the
[1:12:42] Lord and if you don't give him the
[1:12:44] gratitude that he gave to you for
[1:12:45] forgiveness, you will be worse off.
[1:12:48] Something worse will come upon you."
[1:12:51] Hallelujah.
[1:12:55] Just like David.
[1:12:57] Look what he did. Something worse came
[1:12:59] upon him.
[1:13:00] Right? Look how he lost his sons and
[1:13:02] 70,000 people died
[1:13:05] partly because of his sin, but they were
[1:13:07] guilty, too. But he got deceived by
[1:13:09] Satan. Worse things came upon him when
[1:13:12] he did things he knew he should not have
[1:13:14] done.
[1:13:18] May God keep us from iniquity, church.
[1:13:20] That's what I'm trying to say. Yes. Do
[1:13:22] we have iniquity often? But yes, but
[1:13:23] let's keep them minor sins by the grace
[1:13:25] of God. keep the iniquities minor
[1:13:30] because I've seen in that one case at
[1:13:32] least a major someone going from
[1:13:34] completely healed to now debilitated
[1:13:37] again
[1:13:40] and then even to this day the promise he
[1:13:43] promised me he'd come back to church and
[1:13:44] he's not been back to church not this
[1:13:46] church
[1:13:48] till this day he's fallen away and won't
[1:13:51] come back to church
[1:13:53] now church how many churches do you know
[1:13:55] would say what Jesus would say,
[1:13:58] "Go and sin no more." They would just
[1:13:59] say, "Go."
[1:14:01] They wouldn't say, "Don't sin. Stop
[1:14:03] sinning."
[1:14:04] Right? Most churches wouldn't say that.
[1:14:06] That's why most churches are workers of
[1:14:08] iniquity. They don't do the will of our
[1:14:11] father which is in heaven. They just
[1:14:13] hear the good stuff. Oh, God loves you.
[1:14:15] God forgives you. Uh, I don't condemn
[1:14:17] you. I don't condemn you. I don't
[1:14:19] condemn you. But what about go and sin
[1:14:20] no more?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; That's what they don't preach.
[1:14:24] Hallelujah.
[1:14:26] That's why we're a small church. And the
[1:14:28] church said, that's why all these
[1:14:31] acronyes don't flood into here and say,
[1:14:32] "Oh, what a wonderful uh what a
[1:14:34] wonderful church you got. Wonderful
[1:14:36] singing, wonderful pastor, wonderful
[1:14:37] piano player, and it's so wonderful."
[1:14:40] Because why why do they not flood in
[1:14:42] here? Because we tell them, "Stop
[1:14:43] sinning."
[1:14:46] In other words, I want a license for my
[1:14:48] sin. That's Jude 1:3. They've turned the
[1:14:50] grace of God into lasciviousness.
[1:14:54] But Jesus did not. JESUS OFFERED GRACE
[1:14:56] WITH RESPONSIBILITY. PRAISE GOD.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; BELOVED, when I gave all diligence to
[1:15:03] write unto you the common salvation, it
[1:15:05] was needful for me to write unto you and
[1:15:07] exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:15:08] contend for the faith which was once
[1:15:10] delivered to the saints. That's not it.
[1:15:12] Must be verse four. Yeah. Yeah. There it
[1:15:13] is. For there are certain men crept in
[1:15:15] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:15:18] to this condemnation. Ungodly men. They
[1:15:20] turn the grace of God into lawlessness.
[1:15:24] In other words, go and sin. No, I'm
[1:15:26] sorry. In other words, neither do I
[1:15:27] condemn thee. Just trust God. You can do
[1:15:29] whatever you want. You're still going to
[1:15:30] be saved. Can never lose your salvation.
[1:15:32] You've not read enough Bible.
[1:15:35] Exodus 32 and Psalm 69. God said, "I'll
[1:15:38] blot your names out if you don't repent
[1:15:40] of idolatry."
[1:15:42] Is that right? And then Jesus said,
[1:15:44] "I'll blot your name out." Revelation
[1:15:46] 3:5, "Except you overcome your church
[1:15:49] age."
[1:15:50] Hallelujah. And they deny the Lord. See,
[1:15:53] that's the word. The Lord is the word.
[1:15:56] And our Lord Jesus Christ, they actually
[1:15:58] deny the word of God. Let's not deny it.
[1:16:01] Let's live up to it. Praise God. Let's
[1:16:03] accept it. Let's be faithful to the word
[1:16:04] of God. Hallelujah.
[1:16:12] So twice Jesus said, "Go and sin no
[1:16:14] more, lest the worst thing come upon
[1:16:17] you."
[1:16:19] Oh my.
[1:16:21] Brother Ram says that applies both to
[1:16:23] healing and to the soul.
[1:16:26] Hallelujah. In other words, we have to
[1:16:28] keep believing or else we're going to
[1:16:29] get sick again. We got to keep believing
[1:16:32] or else we will forsake or the Bible
[1:16:34] says fail the grace of God.
[1:16:37] We'll become shipwrecked and we'll uh
[1:16:40] reject the grace of God. That's when
[1:16:41] people's names can be blotted off the
[1:16:43] book of life.
[1:16:47] All right. All right. Now, let me bring
[1:16:48] this down to a close here.
[1:16:50] You've been a good audience here by
[1:16:52] God's grace.
[1:16:54] It's about time to close. Jesus gives
[1:16:57] radical forgiveness all throughout the
[1:16:59] gospels to the woman caught in adultery.
[1:17:02] The woman who anointed Jesus' feet,
[1:17:05] Jesus said, "Her sins which are many are
[1:17:08] forgiven." Why? Because she loved him
[1:17:12] very much. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; So, church, don't be discouraged. says,
[1:17:17] "Well, I've done many wrong things."
[1:17:19] You're not alone. All of us have done
[1:17:21] many wrong things. But the question is,
[1:17:24] WILL YOU LOVE JESUS? HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; What's the proof you love Jesus? Like
[1:17:29] she did. Come to Jesus and anoint his
[1:17:31] feet. Give him praise. Anoint his head.
[1:17:33] In other words, worship him. Like
[1:17:34] brother Chris and I were talking about.
[1:17:36] Brother Chris is learning for the first
[1:17:37] time. He stepped out, but he said he's
[1:17:39] learning for the first time to say, "I
[1:17:40] love you, Jesus." Right, brother Chris?
[1:17:43] Amen. I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
[1:17:46] THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO. WE GOT TO KISS
[1:17:48] THE SON lest he be angry.
[1:17:51] You have to learn to love Jesus. I love
[1:17:53] you, Jesus. Thank you for forgiving me.
[1:17:55] I was a wretched. I was lost, but your
[1:17:58] AMAZING GRACE HAS FOUND ME.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:05] the paralytic man who was lowered down
[1:18:07] through Peter's mother-in-law's house or
[1:18:09] maybe Peter's house. Jesus said, "Son,
[1:18:13] thy sins be forgiven thee." So Jesus
[1:18:16] first forgave his sins and then healed
[1:18:19] his body. That's what James 5 says.
[1:18:21] Confess your sins, then pray the prayer
[1:18:23] of faith, and God will heal you.
[1:18:26] Hallelujah. the woman at the well, he
[1:18:29] said, "THOU HAS FIVE HUSBANDS, and the
[1:18:32] one you're with now is not your
[1:18:33] husband."
[1:18:35] Six adulterous uh oh, sorry, five
[1:18:38] adulterous affairs, broken
[1:18:40] relationships, a broken marriage, and
[1:18:43] all this disgrace on her husband with
[1:18:46] five other men. Yet Jesus, yes, she
[1:18:49] said, "He's told me all that ever did."
[1:18:51] And no doubt she was forgiven of being
[1:18:54] unfaithful to five different men.
[1:18:57] THIS IS RADICAL FORGIVENESS. Praise God.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; The tax collector. Jesus said, "I'm not
[1:19:04] come to call the righteous, but sinners
[1:19:06] to repentance." These tax collectors
[1:19:09] were greedy liars. They stole money from
[1:19:13] people on purpose. They look in your
[1:19:15] eyes and lie to you. And yet Jesus said
[1:19:19] he can forgive them. He says, "I'm not
[1:19:22] coming TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS." IN OTHER
[1:19:23] WORDS, you're not righteous. Just admit
[1:19:25] you're unrighteous and I'll forgive you.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] Even Zakius was the chief tax collector.
[1:19:36] Dishonest, extortion, greed, lying. And
[1:19:40] yet Jesus can say, "This day salvation
[1:19:43] has come to your house." That's what we
[1:19:46] need. We don't need the president to
[1:19:47] visit our house or SOME GREAT PERSON. WE
[1:19:49] NEED THE HOLY GHOST TO VISIT OUR HOUSE.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; WE NEED AN ANGEL TO VISIT OUR HOUSE.
[1:19:53] PRAISE GOD.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; That's what we need. Hallelujah.
[1:19:58] Someone that will speak the word of God.
[1:20:00] Someone that will be so powerful, the
[1:20:03] presence, that'll bring us to our knees
[1:20:05] to repent of our sins.
[1:20:11] Even Peter denied Christ three times.
[1:20:15] It'd be like asking, "Brother Jesse, are
[1:20:17] you a Christian?" "No, I don't. What are
[1:20:19] you talking? What's Christianity?"
[1:20:20] "Wait, Jesse, AREN'T YOU A PASTOR?" "NO,
[1:20:22] I'M NOT A PASTOR. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO
[1:20:23] JESUS IS. NO, NO, NO. I saw you on
[1:20:25] YouTube. AREN'T YOU GREAT? NO, NO, NO. I
[1:20:27] DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM. I That wasn't me.
[1:20:31] And Jesus would come and say, "If you
[1:20:32] love me, feed my sheep."
[1:20:35] That's radical forgiveness. Denying the
[1:20:38] Lord, denying you know the you know
[1:20:40] William Brandham, do you follow THE
[1:20:41] MESSAGE WILLIAM? NO. NO, I DON'T. NO, I
[1:20:43] DON'T.
[1:20:45] And yet God will turn around, convict
[1:20:47] us, we'll be forgiven. And then he even
[1:20:49] after that, even before that, he gives
[1:20:51] us the keys to the kingdom. AMEN. WHAT
[1:20:53] AMAZING GRACE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; OUR SINS WHICH ARE MANY ARE FORGIVEN.
[1:20:58] HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE WE LOVE THE LORD SO
[1:21:00] MUCH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Forgiveness makes us love the Lord,
[1:21:05] brother Chris. That's why I LOVE GOD.
[1:21:07] THAT'S WHY I CAN KEEP COMING BACK TO
[1:21:09] CHURCH because I know he loves me and he
[1:21:11] forgives me. Praise God.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Because his word says so.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; And then I'll see a spirit, a grievous
[1:21:16] spirit. Then his spirit will come back
[1:21:18] and do great things among us. That's how
[1:21:20] I know he's forgiven me, too. Amen. Or
[1:21:23] we'll go on a trip and see the Holy
[1:21:24] Ghost move in amazing way. Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] Or the Holy Ghost answer prayer. I know
[1:21:29] I grieved him, but I know he forgave me
[1:21:31] because he came back upon me. I feel the
[1:21:34] presence of God back in my life. Anybody
[1:21:36] can relate to that?
[1:21:39] The thief on the cross that was saved
[1:21:42] while he was getting nailed there. He's
[1:21:44] mocking Jesus. The Bible said they both
[1:21:46] mocked him. And at the very end, he
[1:21:49] said, "Remember me when you come into
[1:21:51] your kingdom." He didn't even He didn't
[1:21:53] even repent with his words. But church,
[1:21:55] he repented in his heart.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Remember me, Jesus. Don't forget me. And
[1:22:00] what did Jesus say? NEITHER DO I CONDEMN
[1:22:02] THEE. YOU'LL BE WITH ME IN PARADISE.
[1:22:05] HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; If we if we approach Jesus the right
[1:22:11] way, he'll say the same thing to us. I
[1:22:14] don't condemn you either. Go and sin no
[1:22:16] more.
[1:22:20] This is the grace of God. This is the
[1:22:23] grace of God we want to live in.
[1:22:25] Hallelujah.
[1:22:28] To see this is how Jesus forgives us.
[1:22:32] Church, the Bible said, "The letter
[1:22:34] kleth, but the spirit giveth life." Now,
[1:22:37] some people take this out of context.
[1:22:39] This means the law. The letter is the
[1:22:41] law. The law kills. In other words,
[1:22:43] nobody can keep it.
[1:22:45] But the spirit gives us life to do what?
[1:22:48] To cause us to keep it.
[1:22:50] Some people use that verse and say,
[1:22:52] "Well, uh, we don't need the message or
[1:22:54] we don't need the Bible." No, no, no,
[1:22:55] no. We need the Bible.
[1:22:57] I need the Bible to tell me where I'm
[1:22:59] wrong, but I need a spirit to give me
[1:23:01] life so I can obey it.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what they tried to do
[1:23:06] to this woman. They tried to bring the
[1:23:07] letter, and that would always kill. But
[1:23:10] what does Jesus do? The spirit gives
[1:23:12] life to it. You got to keep all of it.
[1:23:16] And then God says, "I'm the God. I have
[1:23:18] compassion." Oh, GLORY. I HAVE
[1:23:20] COMPASSION ON WHOEVER I want to have
[1:23:22] compassion on. Hallelujah. Isn't that
[1:23:25] beautiful? He said, "I'll harden all
[1:23:27] those I want to harden." He hardens
[1:23:28] Pharaoh. We heard that last night,
[1:23:29] right, in our family reading. He
[1:23:31] hardened Pharaoh, but for some reason,
[1:23:33] he had mercy on Moses the murderer. WHY?
[1:23:35] BECAUSE GOD KNEW MOSES REALLY LOVED GOD
[1:23:38] AND WOULD OBEY GOD and keep the
[1:23:39] commands.
[1:23:41] Hallelujah.
[1:23:44] The letter kills all of us. The law
[1:23:46] condemns all of us. But the Holy Ghost
[1:23:49] gives us life. We need both. And the
[1:23:52] church said we die daily, right? So we
[1:23:55] need the we need the word. We need the
[1:23:57] letter to kill us every day. Oh, this
[1:24:00] good. I wasn't plann on saying that.
[1:24:02] Amen. Paul said, "I die daily.
[1:24:06] I've got to die to my sinful desires
[1:24:08] every day." But then the spirit of God
[1:24:10] comes to quicken me so I can live the
[1:24:13] word of God that I that I'm battling
[1:24:15] against. Hallelujah.
[1:24:18] Oh, it's so wonderful.
[1:24:23] Church, let's not use this verse to try
[1:24:26] to get rid of all conviction. I hope
[1:24:28] somebody's convicted of any sin this
[1:24:30] morning.
[1:24:31] Hallelujah.
[1:24:33] If you sinned, then the Holy Ghost wants
[1:24:35] to convict you. If you don't feel
[1:24:38] convicted, you're officially backslided.
[1:24:40] It's time to repent of your sins.
[1:24:43] The Holy Ghost brings conviction.
[1:24:46] It doesn't baby sin.
[1:24:50] We want the letter to bring conviction,
[1:24:53] truth, and even rules. Uh go to uh you
[1:24:56] say, "Brother Jess, we're don't we don't
[1:24:58] want to be a church of rules." Yes, we
[1:24:59] do. You just don't know your Bible. We
[1:25:02] haven't read that for a while. Let's
[1:25:03] read Philippians.
[1:25:05] I think it's Philippians 3:16. Okay, she
[1:25:07] stepped out so she needs to step out.
[1:25:09] That's fine. Philippians, I believe it's
[1:25:11] 3:16.
[1:25:13] Always remember that because it's like
[1:25:14] John 3:16. Yes.
[1:25:19] Now, Paul just got done talking about
[1:25:21] how I might know him and the power of
[1:25:23] his fellowship in verse 10. The
[1:25:24] fellowship of his suffering.
[1:25:28] I press toward the mark in verse 14.
[1:25:29] There's our remember last year we
[1:25:30] preached at the beginning of the the the
[1:25:31] year we press toward the mark of the
[1:25:33] high calling of God. Every year we use
[1:25:34] that verse, right? This year I'm going
[1:25:35] to press toward the mark. 2026 is going
[1:25:38] to be better than 2025.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about spiritually.
[1:25:43] Hallelujah. Because we've all had years
[1:25:45] that weren't as good as the previous
[1:25:46] year naturally.
[1:25:50] Look at verse 16. Nevertheless, whereto
[1:25:52] we have already attained. Let us walk by
[1:25:54] the same rule.
[1:25:57] Let us mine the same thing. Don't let
[1:26:00] these devils tell you, "Oh, I don't have
[1:26:01] any rules. God's all love. God's all.
[1:26:04] No, God is both letter and spirit.
[1:26:08] He's both word and spirit, right? Spirit
[1:26:11] and truth.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah.
[1:26:16] Thank you.
[1:26:18] So, we see that we got to have both.
[1:26:20] He's commandments. He said, "If you love
[1:26:21] me, in John 14, he said it three times.
[1:26:23] If you love me, do what, church? Keep my
[1:26:25] commands." If you love me. So that woman
[1:26:29] who was forgiven adultery, if she loved
[1:26:31] Jesus, she'd never go looking at those
[1:26:33] handsome young men again. Boy, he's got
[1:26:34] a lot of money and he's not married and
[1:26:36] I could make some money here or
[1:26:38] whatever. She would never do that. She
[1:26:39] would just walk by those those men,
[1:26:43] right? If she really loved Jesus, she'd
[1:26:45] keep the commands. Hallelujah.
[1:26:49] Same same thing for us. If we really
[1:26:51] love Jesus, let's just walk back or walk
[1:26:54] past anything. Whatever may be tempting
[1:26:57] us, let's just walk past it. Just keep
[1:26:59] running the race, church. Just keep
[1:27:01] running. Don't stop. Don't stop and
[1:27:04] listen to the devil's lies.
[1:27:08] He's the accuser of the brethren.
[1:27:10] Hallelujah. But Jesus is the forgiver of
[1:27:13] the of the merciful. Hallelujah. The
[1:27:15] forgiver of the children of God.
[1:27:18] Said, "If you love me, keep my
[1:27:20] commands."
[1:27:22] Last two verses and I'll close. Luke 20
[1:27:24] vers35.
[1:27:26] You've been a very patient audience with
[1:27:28] me. Thank you. On sister Naomi's
[1:27:30] birthday. Hallelujah. We a lot of
[1:27:32] services on birthdays this year. My
[1:27:35] birthday, lots of other birthdays. That
[1:27:37] would have been last year.
[1:27:40] Luke 20:35.
[1:27:42] But they which shall be accounted worthy
[1:27:44] to obtain that world. Speaking of the
[1:27:46] millennium, huh? You have to be worthy
[1:27:49] enough to be there. I I thought, brother
[1:27:51] Jesse, we're not saved by works. We're
[1:27:53] not saved by works,
[1:27:56] but we've also got to cast down anything
[1:27:58] that exalts itself against the word of
[1:28:00] God. In other words, we've got to show
[1:28:04] responsibility with what God has made
[1:28:06] known to us.
[1:28:09] If we don't, it's proof we either never
[1:28:11] had it or we had it but rejected it.
[1:28:15] Because the Bible said you can Yeah,
[1:28:17] I'll read that. So, I got three verses
[1:28:18] left after this one.
[1:28:23] and the uh Luke 20:35, but they which
[1:28:25] shall be accounted worthy to obtain that
[1:28:27] world and the resurrection from the
[1:28:28] dead, neither marry nor given a
[1:28:30] marriage. Now, I'll preach on that maybe
[1:28:31] later about how she was married seven
[1:28:32] times. There's no marriage in the
[1:28:35] millennium.
[1:28:36] Now, brother Ram said, "You'll get it
[1:28:37] right in the millennium." Remember, we
[1:28:38] heard that last week. But what Jesus is
[1:28:41] saying, they don't have any physical
[1:28:42] relations in the millennium because
[1:28:44] they're not physical bodies, right?
[1:28:46] They're glorified bodies. Hallelujah. So
[1:28:50] yes, you can be married in the
[1:28:51] millennium, but you won't have any
[1:28:52] relations because it's that desire is no
[1:28:54] longer there anymore. Thank God.
[1:28:59] The one I want to show was Luke 8:13, if
[1:29:01] I'm not mistaken. I shared that this
[1:29:03] morning with Brendan on a voice message.
[1:29:05] Luke 8:13. Let me see if that's it.
[1:29:10] And this is where people in the message
[1:29:11] church can hang around for 10, 20, 30,
[1:29:15] 40 years and still fulfill this sad
[1:29:19] verse.
[1:29:24] Church, I don't want to believe for a
[1:29:26] while. I want to believe all the time.
[1:29:31] I want to believe every day because
[1:29:34] anybody can believe for a while. Judas
[1:29:35] believed for three and a half years.
[1:29:39] But this we've seen now that we've been
[1:29:41] the message all these years. Now we can
[1:29:43] see people can believe for 40 sometimes
[1:29:46] 50 years and then walk away from the
[1:29:47] water baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:29:49] Christ. How could you do that?
[1:29:53] How could you walk away from women
[1:29:55] dressing holy and then go sit in
[1:29:57] churches with a bunch of stripped down
[1:29:59] Jezebels,
[1:30:01] sexy clothes,
[1:30:03] paint on their face painted up like a
[1:30:05] barn.
[1:30:07] How could you do that? This is how they
[1:30:10] could do that.
[1:30:12] They on the rock are they which when
[1:30:14] they hear they receive the word with joy
[1:30:16] and these have no root which for a while
[1:30:19] believe. Did they believe? Yes.
[1:30:23] And in time of temptation fall away.
[1:30:26] Satan let these people sit around by the
[1:30:28] mercy for 30, 40, 50 years. They haven't
[1:30:30] even been tested yet.
[1:30:32] But here comes the test. Well, brother
[1:30:34] Ram said that. But then he said that and
[1:30:36] then this person in the church did this
[1:30:37] and it turns them against Satan comes
[1:30:40] and snatches it out and now they just
[1:30:42] got roots of bitterness and hatred
[1:30:43] towards message believers. Now that
[1:30:46] might be an extreme example but that's
[1:30:48] what the Bible says
[1:30:50] in the time of temptation Satan snatches
[1:30:52] that revelation out of their heart. I
[1:30:54] don't believe it anymore. And church
[1:30:56] some of them will say I believed it with
[1:30:58] all my heart. I don't doubt that. But
[1:31:00] Satan, you let Satan in and snatched it
[1:31:02] all away. And now you don't believe it
[1:31:06] because your actions speak louder than
[1:31:07] any words. And the church said,
[1:31:12] "Neither do I condemn thee." That's the
[1:31:13] title. Hallelujah. Last verse.
[1:31:15] Revelation 3:4.
[1:31:18] You've been a very patient people. Did
[1:31:21] anybody enjoy the word today?
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:31:26] Yeah. Brother Dale kind of stirred me up
[1:31:28] on this thought. Like I like to show
[1:31:30] this thought.
[1:31:33] Thou hast a few names even in Sardis
[1:31:36] which have not defiled my garments.
[1:31:38] Sorry, defiled their garments. And they
[1:31:42] shall walk with with me in white for
[1:31:44] they are to say together they are
[1:31:46] worthy. Let's stand to our feet. Now
[1:31:48] church leave that verse up there.
[1:31:50] Musicians can come.
[1:31:54] Let's keep that balance. Right.
[1:31:56] All have fallen short of the glory of
[1:31:58] God. We sin every day, right? Brother
[1:32:00] Ram says that we so easily beset
[1:32:03] ourselves. But the overall theme of our
[1:32:06] life is that I'm trying to stay away
[1:32:08] from sin.
[1:32:11] If you are trying to fight sin, you are
[1:32:13] one of the worthy ones. Praise God. You
[1:32:16] are one of the worthy ones. If you're
[1:32:19] trying to keep yourself from getting
[1:32:21] defiled by the things of this world,
[1:32:25] Jesus calls that type of life worthy.
[1:32:29] Brother Jess, how was your week this
[1:32:30] week? It was great. I was running as far
[1:32:32] away from sin as I could.
[1:32:34] I was trying to outrun the lust of the
[1:32:36] eyes, lust of the flesh, and pride of
[1:32:37] life. I was running away from it,
[1:32:38] brother. I was taking I had a busy week.
[1:32:40] I was running hard. My goodness.
[1:32:44] and I kept my garments white because I
[1:32:46] wash my garments in the blood of Jesus
[1:32:48] Christ.
[1:32:51] And so, Jose, there's no condemnation
[1:32:54] to them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:32:56] who walk not after the flesh, but after
[1:32:59] the spirit. So, what is Jesus going to
[1:33:01] tell you? Well, it's your choice. You
[1:33:03] can you can already know what he's going
[1:33:04] to tell you. Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] Is he going to say, "I never knew you."
[1:33:09] Or is he going to say, "Neither do I
[1:33:11] condemn you.
[1:33:12] You're worthy. Let's pray about it
[1:33:15] today. Let's bow our heads.
[1:33:18] Father, we thank you for the word of God
[1:33:20] today. This word of neither do I condemn
[1:33:23] thee. We've seen it now, Lord, through
[1:33:25] the book of John chapter 8.
[1:33:29] We see how you do it, Lord. First, you
[1:33:32] get rid of all the devil confusion, all
[1:33:35] the devil accusers. You get rid of all
[1:33:37] that when then it's just you and us,
[1:33:39] Lord God. Hallelujah.
[1:33:42] It's just the just one with the one that
[1:33:45] wants to be justified.
[1:33:48] [Music]
[1:33:50] It's just the forgiver with the one who
[1:33:52] wants to be forgiven. Hallelujah.
[1:33:55] Glory. It's just the savior with the one
[1:33:58] who wants to be saved. Lord, we want to
[1:34:00] be saved today, Lord God.
[1:34:02] [Music]
[1:34:04] We want to be justified like this woman.
[1:34:10] Father, you've inspired me to preach
[1:34:13] this. I just pray the word will fall on
[1:34:15] good ground hearts, Lord. And they will
[1:34:18] believe not for a while, but they'll
[1:34:20] believe to the end. Hallelujah. They'll
[1:34:24] believe all the days of their life.
[1:34:28] Lord, help our church to walk in the
[1:34:30] fear of God all the days of our life.
[1:34:33] Lord, if anyone in the church has sin,
[1:34:34] which it's most likely
[1:34:37] because we sin every day, Lord, may they
[1:34:39] confess it, Lord Jesus,
[1:34:42] and may they walk in the light as you're
[1:34:45] in the light, and the blood of Jesus
[1:34:47] Christ will cleanse us from all
[1:34:48] unrighteousness.
[1:34:51] May we hear those beautiful words from
[1:34:52] the Holy Spirit. Neither do I condemn
[1:34:54] thee. Go and sin no more, oh God.
[1:34:59] Such beautiful words from the Lord
[1:35:01] Jesus.
[1:35:02] If anybody had a right to condemn, it
[1:35:04] was him. It was you, Lord.
[1:35:07] But you refused to condemn because you
[1:35:10] saw a desire in this woman to be
[1:35:12] forgiven.
[1:35:15] She types the bride.
[1:35:17] Hallelujah. I believe she even types
[1:35:20] Israel.
[1:35:21] Israel was married, committed adultery.
[1:35:24] Oh, there it is. My
[1:35:26] You put her away for adultery, but then
[1:35:28] Lord, you'll forgive her. You'll return
[1:35:30] to her. you'll bring her back to your
[1:35:31] herself.
[1:35:34] Lord Jesus, we all see ourselves in this
[1:35:36] story today.
[1:35:38] Whether through physical sins, caught in
[1:35:40] the act, mental sins,
[1:35:42] verbal sins, whatever may be, God,
[1:35:45] forgive us of our sins, Lord Jesus. May
[1:35:48] we confess our sins, so we can be right
[1:35:52] with you, Lord God.
[1:35:55] Hallelujah, Jesus. Thank you for your
[1:35:56] love and your mercy. Bless your people
[1:35:58] today, Lord. I don't see brother Claude,
[1:36:00] so we pray for him in Jesus Christ's
[1:36:02] name. Minister to his need, Lord God,
[1:36:04] today. Thank you for our precious
[1:36:05] brother, Lord God. I don't see Brother
[1:36:07] Vang and sister CIA, Lord, so be with
[1:36:09] their precious family, Lord God. Let
[1:36:11] your spirit strengthen them today, Lord
[1:36:13] God. We never want to forget our family,
[1:36:15] Lord God. Our family in Christ Jesus.
[1:36:21] And again, a special blessing on our
[1:36:22] sister Naomi for her birthday today,
[1:36:24] just like Austin's was the previous
[1:36:26] Wednesday, Lord Jesus.
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:30] Father, let your blessings be upon your
[1:36:31] people. If there's anyone that needs
[1:36:33] prayer, more time with you, I pray they
[1:36:35] would get time alone with you. Just like
[1:36:37] this woman, she's left alone with Jesus.
[1:36:39] May each person be alone with Jesus,
[1:36:41] Lord God.
[1:36:43] That song says, I must tell Jesus.
[1:36:47] Jesus can help me. Jesus alone.
[1:36:50] Hallelujah. Lord, you're the only one
[1:36:52] that can help your people today. Help
[1:36:54] your people, I pray, today. In Jesus
[1:36:56] Christ's name, I ask it.
