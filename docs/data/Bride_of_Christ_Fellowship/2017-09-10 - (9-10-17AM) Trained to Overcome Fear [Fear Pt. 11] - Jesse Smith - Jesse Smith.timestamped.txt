[14:49] reminders about upcoming services Brian

[15:06] carry in with just one service
[15:08] that's where family has requested the

[15:27] be here November 5th communion November
[15:30] 19th dates
[15:33] Morris and Karen had their anniversary
[15:35] on Wednesday let's give them any idea
[15:49] when she's coming back as well sure you
[15:56] said yesterday in a text that she was
[15:57] eating so thank you sure enough so
[16:04] Kevin's berkeley's a Saturday also I
[16:13] just put a little note in there I had a
[16:14] conversation recently with one of the
[16:15] Saints that just remind her at our
[16:17] church they have questions about
[16:18] tambourines and things and so I said I
[16:22] just said the eve I just said you know
[16:24] anyone who had this skilled and
[16:26] instruments welcome clay that's always
[16:28] been our conviction but I just asked
[16:32] that just one tambourine play at a time
[16:34] just as a song leader I can get I can
[16:37] lose the beat quickly so I apologize
[16:38] divorce more than one tambourine playing
[16:41] I kind of lose the beat and then also
[16:44] can be kind of loud in the small room
[16:46] like this if we have numerous
[16:47] tambourines so
[16:48] generally just one tambourine so I just
[16:52] thought I'd share that
[16:54] or just something simple but I just want
[16:56] to share that by God's grace also we
[17:00] have two baptisms this evening after the
[17:02] second service
[17:03] I shared on Wednesday ministering to a
[17:07] family they're coply and their children
[17:09] one be baptized fourth grader and
[17:11] sophomore Lord Jesus Christ and coffee
[17:15] today the second service so just pray
[17:18] for them they go to the chapel up there
[17:20] and Akron and I'm trying to drop
[17:22] numerous hints in there about a prophet
[17:24] and brother bearing them you to pay each
[17:26] and everything I try to lay it
[17:27] everything just put in the bait out
[17:29] there nothing as of yet but they agree
[17:32] with the baptism the name of Lord Jesus
[17:33] Christ so that's how we're gonna baptize
[17:35] it so if they can see that praise the
[17:38] Lord brother look that in here this
[17:41] interests even Wow
[17:43] that makes so much sense if Jesus said
[17:45] father son Holy Ghost and they baptize
[17:46] in the name of Jesus every time that
[17:48] makes perfect sense I never understood
[17:50] that so it's wonderful but in one case
[17:53] perhaps if you need a revelation to see
[17:54] another case he said you don't need a
[17:56] revelation he saw any other needs of
[18:05] snorted by God's grace in heaven for
[18:06] everyone Esther you have a request for a

[39:22] like to continue the series on beer this
[39:26] is part 11 like to preach on trained to
[39:29] overcome fear this more training to
[39:32] overcome this fear how they gave a
[39:33] little preview that on Wednesday night
[39:36] and got caught up trained to overcome
[39:42] fear first John for
[39:55] reading our like to read our scripture
[39:57] about perfect love first John for we
[40:01] read 17 and 18 verse 17 says hearin is
[40:18] our love made perfect that we may have
[40:19] boldness in the Day of Judgment because
[40:22] as he is so are we in this world that
[40:27] would have to be the soul of man would
[40:29] it not when the soul of man has the Holy
[40:32] Spirit inside of it you have a part of
[40:34] Christ it's called Christ in you that's
[40:36] the only way we could be as God is to
[40:38] have part of God inside of us
[40:41] verse 18 there is no fear in love but
[40:47] perfect love casteth out fear because
[40:52] fear hath torment he that feareth is not
[40:59] made perfect in love we love him because
[41:02] he first loved us if a man say I love
[41:05] God and hateth his brother he's a liar
[41:08] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[41:11] he has seen how can he love God whom he
[41:14] hath not seen and this commandment have
[41:17] we from him that he who loveth God love
[41:21] his brother also let's have a word of
[41:24] Prayer let's just bow our heads if ever
[41:25] need on your heart this morning just
[41:27] make it known unto God surely he's with
[41:29] us he's mindful of our needs and loves
[41:32] us so very much Heavenly Father we love
[41:35] you so much we love you because you
[41:37] first loved us dear God thank you for
[41:40] being the one who first loved and for
[41:42] Lord creating us and creating mankind
[41:46] Lord this great drama that's unfolding
[41:47] before us Lord as we are at the end time
[41:51] Lord Jesus help us to be faithful help
[41:54] us to play our parts Lord we're
[41:55] believing our part is the wise Virgin in
[41:57] this our Lord God to have our lamps
[42:00] trimmed and clean dear God we thank you
[42:03] for this reading of thy word Lord Jesus
[42:05] I pray you
[42:06] our faith Lord by granting perfect love
[42:09] to operate in our hearts and lives Lord
[42:12] God we give you all the glory
[42:14] we ask that you be glorified forgive us
[42:16] of any trespass that your Holy Spirit
[42:18] flow through us now lord help me to
[42:20] yield to your spirit help each and every
[42:22] one to get in the channel of the Holy
[42:23] Spirit for your glory that you might be
[42:26] honored today in Jesus Christ's name and
[42:29] the church said Amen god bless you means
[42:39] looking at part 11 by the grace of the
[42:42] Lord this series on fear also I'm sister
[42:47] Wendy had requested that I put our Azra
[42:50] Nehemiah Esther series on the church
[42:52] computer along with the Daniel series
[42:54] from this year so I got it on the
[42:56] desktop there so if anybody wants it I
[42:58] don't know if you like to go back and
[43:00] listen the past sermons but if you want
[43:02] them there
[43:02] I think there's 24 on Ezra and Nehemiah
[43:05] and there's course 12 on Daniel we did
[43:07] one per chapter so I just wanted to make
[43:09] sure I share those in case anybody likes
[43:11] to listen to those by the grace of the
[43:13] Lord so let's look at this thought here
[43:16] trained to overcome fear I want to start
[43:20] with the quotation from the testimony
[43:22] raising the dead boy in 1953 I want to
[43:26] start with this quotation because this
[43:27] is kind of where I got my inspiration
[43:29] and then I want to read about a Navy
[43:35] disaster simulator you may not have
[43:38] heard of I want to read about that as we
[43:41] look at train to overcome fear praise
[43:43] God
[43:44] how many how many in training right now
[43:46] you feel the Holy Spirit's training you
[43:48] to overcome all fears Amen you we ought
[43:51] to be by the grace of the Lord if God's
[43:53] with us he's training us to overcome all
[43:55] trials all temptations but especially
[43:58] the spirit of fear the Prophet said
[44:00] that's the greatest hindrance on the
[44:01] church is fear well God back his word or
[44:05] not and so we've got to have confidence
[44:08] and we saw last Sunday we kind of went
[44:10] through the three parts of man last
[44:11] Sunday with perfect love part two and we
[44:14] saw how you got to have all three parts
[44:17] flowing with love your body saw
[44:20] and spirit and we saw to me it was a
[44:23] great revelation I don't know if you
[44:24] remember about the end of the service
[44:25] you know the scripture faith hope and
[44:28] charity came to my heart and brother
[44:30] Sampson Shetty bought this for me last
[44:32] time he was here so he want to say
[44:34] thanks for our hosting so got my new tie
[44:36] on today the first time I wore my new
[44:38] tie
[44:39] but the scripture came to my mind
[44:41] because charity is greater than faith
[44:43] and hope and I thought that's right it
[44:45] struck us at the end of the service how
[44:47] love is the greatest because faith
[44:49] cannot even operate without love we must
[44:53] have full love for Christ in our mind
[44:55] that means any conscious memory reason
[44:57] affection imagination we can't imagine
[44:59] imagine anything evil we can't have any
[45:03] conscious so well I should have did this
[45:04] better or I'm guilty of this we can't
[45:06] let anything bother us we must have love
[45:09] in every area of our human mind
[45:11] especially that's the where the greatest
[45:12] battle is ever fought taking place right
[45:15] there and then if you have that full
[45:17] love of God and mother Bram took it back
[45:18] to John 3:16 he said that's how he could
[45:21] have perfect love when the bull was
[45:23] there right and he had to walk past the
[45:26] bull and the Hornets from the hornet's
[45:27] nest he brought it back to John 3:16 God
[45:30] so loved me amen and if God so loved me
[45:34] how I ought to love his creation as well
[45:36] amen and love all his people praise the
[45:39] Lord so he brought it back to perfect
[45:41] love and John 3:16 and then we saw that
[45:44] that's how perfect love operates we must
[45:48] have full love of God have no nothing in
[45:50] our conscience battling us our hearts
[45:53] the Bible said must condemn us not and
[45:55] then once we have that love then that
[45:57] love can operate faith because I could
[46:01] have confidence that God is going to
[46:02] keep his word because I love him and he
[46:05] loves me praise God and then after that
[46:07] after you have loved faith then the last
[46:10] thing is hope and in Romans chapter 5
[46:12] verse 4 the Bible said hope is the last
[46:14] of those four stages you have
[46:16] experienced and trials and I kind of got
[46:19] a mixed up right now but I don't have it
[46:20] in front of me but you know it Romans 5
[46:22] for how the last thing that produced
[46:25] that all this produces tribulation
[46:27] worketh patience there is patience worst
[46:29] works experience and experience works
[46:31] hope amen
[46:33] and so faith I'm sorry charity love
[46:36] faith and hope praise God the greatest
[46:39] of these is love amen
[46:40] because the only way we can have hope is
[46:42] to go through the tribulations with
[46:44] strong faith they men and that happens
[46:47] because we had love of God first love of
[46:50] God to cast out all fears Amen so it is
[46:54] all about perfect love in this hour it's
[46:57] about love programs that divine love is
[46:59] the only thing that's going to make it
[47:00] over there how many know that hallelujah
[47:02] so it's all about the greatest
[47:03] commandment love God with all your being
[47:05] all three parts amen
[47:07] body soul spirit hallelujah so I want to
[47:11] start with this quotation and I got it
[47:14] you know by studying the hivite it
[47:15] tights and everything like that there's
[47:17] all these quotes about this the prophets
[47:20] talking about Abraham and how God
[47:22] promised his seed the the land of Canaan
[47:25] and then it took 400 years for Joshua to
[47:28] get in he talked about now he said it's
[47:30] yours but it's just as full of Hittites
[47:33] and Jebusites and Canaanites and all
[47:35] kinds of enemies they're walled up heavy
[47:37] now it's yours go take it I give it to
[47:41] you but you go get it and he said that's
[47:43] people today if you'd only see when I
[47:46] tell you about divine healing you'd say
[47:48] well brother branham look I was prayed
[47:49] for last night I can't move my hand
[47:51] anymore he said that don't have one
[47:53] thing to do with it not a thing it's
[47:55] yours go get it
[47:56] he said why sure God just didn't go up
[47:59] there and take his brush and sweep them
[48:01] all out and say now come in here you are
[48:04] set down never did God do that and then
[48:08] he quotes James - you show me your faith
[48:11] without your works and I'll show you my
[48:14] faith by my works you've got to do it
[48:18] and you've got to fight for every inch
[48:21] of ground that you have every man in
[48:24] here that's born again of the Spirit of
[48:26] God knows that you've had to fight for
[48:28] every inch of ground how many know you
[48:31] got to fight for every inch there was no
[48:33] victory that was just given to you
[48:35] without you fighting for without you you
[48:37] know quoting the word or denying the
[48:39] symptoms and all these things every born
[48:42] against person of the Spirit of God
[48:44] knows you fight for every
[48:47] inch of ground amen hallelujah toe the
[48:52] mark was Satan isn't that right friends
[48:54] this is not a picnic it's a battleground
[48:56] we never come here to eat cookies and so
[48:59] forth we're in a battle now we all like
[49:01] cookies but we're not come here to eat
[49:02] cookies programs say could you imagine
[49:05] United States Army training a man to set
[49:08] around and eat cookies and so forth why
[49:12] no he gives them a uniform his gun and
[49:15] trains him to get out there and fight
[49:18] and the defend the nation and that's
[49:22] what we've got to do we got to defend
[49:24] our god-given rights what God said it's
[49:27] ours let's stand right toe-to-toe with
[49:30] Satan so Bob Rams encouraging us have
[49:33] sons and daughters of God we're gonna
[49:35] have to battle for every promise to be
[49:37] fulfilled in our lives we have to
[49:39] understand it's not a picnic it's not
[49:41] going to be given to us the rapture is
[49:43] not going to be given to us necessarily
[49:45] as much as we'd say just sit back and do
[49:47] nothing about it we've got something to
[49:49] do praise God our loved ones aren't just
[49:51] gonna you know just give their hearts to
[49:53] God we need to pray for them
[49:54] we need to intercede for them praise God
[49:57] we need to be lights we need to be
[49:58] witnesses we're not going to go to the
[49:59] Statue of Reverend man by doing nothing
[50:01] the Bible said you make your calling and
[50:03] election sure praise God we have
[50:06] something to do and then he says how
[50:08] Satan hasn't got one legal right
[50:10] everything he's got is defeated the only
[50:12] thing is is a scarecrow he can't bother
[50:15] you a man that's born of the Spirit of
[50:18] God there's nothing at all that can harm
[50:21] him glory he said now Satan can push
[50:23] things over on you and just keep shoving
[50:26] you out and shoving you out he said what
[50:29] if I went to my house tonight and I
[50:30] looked there and I saw a big bunch of
[50:32] people we're drunken prostitutes
[50:33] carrying on why I put them out well how
[50:36] you gonna do it you they say well I'm a
[50:38] human this house is made for humans I
[50:40] can live here too but I would say this
[50:43] belongs to me this is my legal
[50:45] possession I've got an abstract deed
[50:47] here at the courthouse that shows this
[50:49] belongs to me and you cannot stay here
[50:51] any longer
[50:52] I'd serve notice on them and they'd have
[50:56] to move if they didn't there's a law
[50:58] downtown that'll make
[51:00] move is that right amen well anything
[51:04] that Satan put upon you in the way of a
[51:07] sickness or whatever it is you every
[51:10] born-again person has an abstract or
[51:13] warrant from God and the Holy Spirit is
[51:16] here to put the devil out amen
[51:19] no matter if he's a cancer tumor
[51:22] cataract whatever is the Holy Spirit
[51:25] we'll put him out if you'll serve him
[51:27] notice in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[51:30] so we must have to be willing to believe
[51:32] that this possession is mine and I can
[51:35] serve the enemy notice in the name of
[51:37] Jesus Christ because he has no legal
[51:40] rights I'm the Lord that heals all our
[51:42] diseases is that right
[51:44] he's wounded for our transgressions with
[51:46] with His stripes we are healed but you
[51:49] got to go over and take it amen he said
[51:53] that's the same thing the Holy Spirit's
[51:55] leading the church today the only thing
[51:58] you say is well now God tells me in my
[52:02] heart that Jesus Christ has healed me
[52:03] this is my possession I take it I go on
[52:07] and it's mine praise the Lord hallelujah
[52:12] he said then you just go on the Holy
[52:14] Spirit just keeps leading you no matter
[52:19] how you're feeling if you go to you're
[52:21] feeling then you're certainly going to
[52:23] be discouraged if you go back to that
[52:25] every time you have a negative testimony
[52:27] every time you look at your symptoms
[52:29] then you fall in right then
[52:32] praise the Lord so can we see we've got
[52:34] to be able to confess the Word of God we
[52:37] preach a sermon on that a few weeks ago
[52:38] driving out the hittites
[52:40] is denying the symptoms and possessing
[52:44] the Word of God by speaking the Word of
[52:46] God how many understand we need to speak
[52:49] the Word of God it's so critical these
[52:51] are legal rights Jesus died for all
[52:54] these blessings Jesus died that every
[52:56] promise might be yours and mine amen but
[52:58] we're gonna have to fight for every inch
[53:01] of ground hallelujah now read this quote
[53:05] when I was studying I thought mine the
[53:07] United States Army and then I just went
[53:09] on YouTube and and a video popped up
[53:11] called the spirit of fear although
[53:12] that's a 40-minute sir
[53:14] I can listen to that and I listen to
[53:16] this sermon and they said something
[53:18] about this I'm gonna read a little
[53:20] article from Popular Mechanics it's just
[53:22] a very short article what it talks about
[53:26] the United States Navy because brother
[53:28] man talk about the United States Army
[53:29] they don't train people to sit there and
[53:31] eat cookies right and and to have an
[53:33] easy life they've got to be disciplined
[53:35] I'm gonna understand discipline praise
[53:37] God they've got to be disciplined
[53:39] they've got to be able to deny
[53:41] themselves and they've got to be able to
[53:43] follow orders despite feelings and
[53:46] that's why the Army has to separate them
[53:48] from their their wives and their
[53:49] children or or their mothers and fathers
[53:51] they've got to be separated like Abraham
[53:54] had to be separated praise God he had to
[53:56] be separated from his family so he could
[53:58] hear the commander's orders amen now
[54:01] this article is called surviving on the
[54:06] USS trailer has anyone ever heard of the
[54:08] USS tre er no one okay well good it's
[54:11] gonna be fresh to everybody that amen so
[54:13] nobody can fall asleep during this one
[54:14] okay
[54:15] nobody can nod your head and look away
[54:18] everybody new to everybody here
[54:20] surviving the USS trailer it's called
[54:23] the Navy's disaster simulator so here's
[54:27] the headline it says
[54:28] night after night the USS Trey ER
[54:30] sometimes known as the unluckiest ship
[54:33] in the Navy takes enemy fire exploding
[54:37] into burning flooded wreckage by
[54:40] confronting mayhem on this replica
[54:43] guided missile destroyer recruits learn
[54:47] lessons that may one day save their
[54:50] lives so this is in Illinois this USS
[54:55] trailer is based in Illinois and I'm
[54:58] going to read through this article the
[55:00] USS trailer is a 210 foot long replica
[55:03] of a guided missile destroyer the vessel
[55:09] rises above a ninety thousand gallon
[55:12] pool of water inside a building at the
[55:15] Navy's Recruit Training Command Center
[55:18] about 35 miles north of Chicago
[55:21] open last year and I don't know what
[55:23] year this was this could be from many
[55:25] years ago I may be 10 years because on
[55:27] the Internet
[55:27] I don't know open last year after six
[55:31] years of planning and construction the
[55:33] 56 million dollar Navy simulator is the
[55:36] most realistic and ambitious in the
[55:39] world can you imagine spending 56
[55:42] million dollars on a replica battleship
[55:45] here and it's designed to train their
[55:48] recruits before they're actually
[55:49] officially officially sailors in the
[55:52] Navy before they even graduate they have
[55:54] to go to the USS trailer five days a
[55:59] week it bears the brunt of multiple
[56:01] enemy missile attacks that result in
[56:03] simulated deaths injuries and damage but
[56:07] while the scenario is fictional the
[56:10] stakes are real for recruits toward the
[56:14] end of their eight-week basic training
[56:16] course the trailer is their baptism by
[56:19] fire and final exam thanks the baptism
[56:23] of the Holy Ghost I think it's all that
[56:25] stands between them and the right to be
[56:28] called a sailor amen I like that so I
[56:32] skipped a little bit in the article so
[56:34] the Navy let this journalist or whatever
[56:37] he is from Popular Mechanics come and
[56:40] spend a 12-hour shift on the USS trailer
[56:44] what are we talking about training to
[56:46] overcome fear training overcome fear
[56:52] they spent so much money he says we're
[56:54] indoors but I can feel a gentle breeze
[56:56] that carries and has the sound of
[57:00] seagulls that says so they spent all
[57:02] this money to make a simulated
[57:04] experience of a ship that's going to be
[57:07] hit by missiles to train the crew before
[57:10] they become official sailors he said we
[57:14] climb the gangway in teams then we
[57:16] descend in the bowels of the ship the
[57:19] night starts slowly with exercises that
[57:21] involve monitoring gauges standing
[57:25] lookout and coiling lines so they have
[57:26] all these different things they just
[57:27] rotate from one one duty to the next all
[57:30] night 12 hours they do this shift here
[57:34] every 45 minutes or so we returned to
[57:37] the crew living space to visit the head
[57:40] and watch
[57:41] debriefing videos that describe US Navy
[57:44] history what a what an interesting night
[57:46] huh what an exciting night you go from
[57:49] duty to duty then you got to watch Navy
[57:50] history maybe what we wouldn't think
[57:53] would be a very engaging night but
[57:55] that's what they do
[57:57] then just as the Petty Officers start
[58:00] chewing out recruits for drifting off to
[58:03] sleep
[58:04] he said boom an explosion rattles the
[58:08] floor and the lights flicker brace for
[58:12] shock a petty officer shouts we leaned
[58:15] against the walls to prepare for
[58:16] secondary blast then race to Don our
[58:19] battle dress fire resistant hood metal
[58:23] with face guard and long gloves for the
[58:25] next four hours we dash from one
[58:29] scenario to another escaping from a
[58:32] smoke-filled compartment through an
[58:34] emergency hatch and humping 35 pound
[58:38] canisters of 5-inch gun ammunition out
[58:41] of a room slowly filling with water so
[58:45] the Navy has spent almost 60 million
[58:47] dollars probably by now to do all the
[58:49] the touch-up work on it probably 60
[58:52] million dollars to simulate what is like
[58:54] to be on a battleship that gets hit by
[58:56] enemy fire and so the lights will go out
[58:59] they'll Flickr off and on water will
[59:01] start filling and they're in a ninety
[59:03] thousand gallon tank water starts slowly
[59:06] filling the ship and they're faced with
[59:08] all these different trials sound like
[59:10] your life a little bit God is letting
[59:13] you go through many what seemed like
[59:15] fearful trials but the whole time - god
[59:18] it's simulated praise God God knows
[59:21] what's going to happen God is in control
[59:23] God is really protecting your life amen
[59:26] I like that the intense environment is
[59:30] intended to provide stress inoculation
[59:33] they're trying to inject the the sailors
[59:36] with stress they're trying to create
[59:38] stress they're trying to create fear so
[59:42] in sailors encounter a real catastrophe
[59:45] they'll know they can handle it an
[59:49] often-cited
[59:50] inspiration for the Traer was a
[59:52] three-day struggle to save the USS Cole
[59:55] was crippled by suicide bombers in Yemen
[59:58] in October mm this is all inspired from
[1:00:01] an attack in the year 2000 am I saying
[1:00:04] that right
[1:00:05] amen Yemen is that how I say okay thank
[1:00:08] you brother Yemen so they got this idea
[1:00:10] wow this happened in Yemen and so we
[1:00:13] want to simulate that so the soldiers or
[1:00:15] the sailors they're not afraid so they
[1:00:18] can kind of get a taste of what this is
[1:00:19] going to be like and member they got to
[1:00:22] go through this in order to be fully
[1:00:24] baptized by fire to become a fresh
[1:00:26] recruit never a real not a real recruit
[1:00:28] but a fresh sold your fresh sailor to be
[1:00:31] an official sailor I like that it's the
[1:00:34] baptism by fire it says listen as the
[1:00:39] night continues the catastrophes grow
[1:00:41] more taxing right because you've been up
[1:00:44] all day and you you you go there and
[1:00:47] then it's a 12-hour shift you can't go
[1:00:48] and sleep the petty officers will chew
[1:00:50] you out if you try to go to sleep and
[1:00:51] the waters rising they got to go from
[1:00:54] one room to the next room from one job
[1:00:55] to the next job young and inexperienced
[1:00:59] never feel like that young inexperienced
[1:01:01] the recruits are struggling to make the
[1:01:04] most of their seven weeks of naval
[1:01:07] education but fatigue is starting the
[1:01:09] show and he talks about how they had a
[1:01:15] mistake in the casualty exercise they
[1:01:18] had a casualty exercise where where they
[1:01:20] had you know floating soldiers and and
[1:01:22] they let some of them drown now they
[1:01:24] weren't real they were dummies you know
[1:01:25] but they let him drown they didn't get
[1:01:27] to him in time and so they you know
[1:01:29] they're so tired they're not able to
[1:01:30] save lives we these pretend lives on the
[1:01:34] ship and so they reach a low point and
[1:01:38] they said that eight they said after we
[1:01:40] finished lugging the groaning dummy so
[1:01:42] the dummy even makes noise that's how
[1:01:43] much detail they put into it up to the
[1:01:47] sickbay
[1:01:47] the instructors tear into us nobody
[1:01:50] likes to get chewed out do they but they
[1:01:53] been up all day all night working as
[1:01:56] hard as they can with waters rising and
[1:01:58] fires they have all these simulations in
[1:01:59] here they let some dummies die and they
[1:02:03] got to get pulled up and shoot out nice
[1:02:09] and he says the instructor tears into us
[1:02:12] look he's dead a petty officer says as
[1:02:15] he rips open the stretchers velcro
[1:02:18] straps to show us how we fastened them
[1:02:20] incorrectly
[1:02:21] he says you killed them because they
[1:02:24] didn't put the straps on correctly
[1:02:26] sometime around dawn so they're up all
[1:02:29] night almost 24 hours sometime around
[1:02:31] dawn the captain comes on the intercom
[1:02:34] the enemy ship that attacked us has been
[1:02:37] captured and the damage to our own
[1:02:38] vessel has been contained
[1:02:40] amid the relief we hardly feel
[1:02:42] exhaustion it says the traitors DNA
[1:02:53] comes from theme parks says a civil
[1:02:56] engineer who oversees the backstage
[1:02:58] operations there's fans on the pier to
[1:03:01] create the sensation of wind
[1:03:02] there's wave machines to make the pool
[1:03:04] of water seemed like a real ocean
[1:03:05] they're sent machines to recreate the
[1:03:08] smell of the sea there's even artificial
[1:03:10] guano spattered here and there to offer
[1:03:13] the extra touch of realism
[1:03:17] he says I'm particular curves to see how
[1:03:20] the mass casualty exercise is staged for
[1:03:23] me this is the most intense part of the
[1:03:25] whole evening trying to save casualties
[1:03:27] so that these dummies that look like you
[1:03:29] know they're bleeding or or they're
[1:03:30] there they're wounded or they're gonna
[1:03:32] die and they save that to the very end
[1:03:35] do they have enough strength and focus
[1:03:38] to save other lives even I think Christ
[1:03:41] is in that business too don't you
[1:03:42] Christ wants us to persevere through
[1:03:44] difficult times to overcome all of our
[1:03:47] fears in order save one soul praise God
[1:03:49] that's right he said the one this is the
[1:03:54] one that sent my pulse racing nearest to
[1:03:57] the level it would hit during the actual
[1:03:59] catastrophe walking back over the
[1:04:02] tilting floors in the coma day so that
[1:04:03] the floors would even tilt they had such
[1:04:06] a control he said I can hardly recognize
[1:04:08] the place even the dismembered by dummy
[1:04:11] hanging from the ceiling looks no more
[1:04:13] menacing than a department store
[1:04:14] mannequin so once it's all cleaned up it
[1:04:16] is the fear seems to to move away
[1:04:22] the smoke effect it turns out is an
[1:04:24] aerosol of glycol that looks just like
[1:04:27] the real thing but doesn't cause lung
[1:04:29] damage strobe lights mimic the
[1:04:31] flickering of electrical fires and
[1:04:33] subwoofers vibrate under the floor to
[1:04:35] simulate explosions heating pads inside
[1:04:39] a steel door approximately the high
[1:04:41] temperatures caused by a raging fire on
[1:04:43] the far side and electrically heated
[1:04:46] oils produced the odor of burning wires
[1:04:49] so they have all these all these aways
[1:04:52] to simulate what it's like to be in a
[1:04:54] ship that's sinking mine now the the
[1:04:58] journalist ends by saying that he said
[1:04:59] when they left at dawn the next morning
[1:05:01] that game a navy had to put on and he
[1:05:02] said he said I like that I appreciate
[1:05:04] their kindness to give me the Hat but he
[1:05:06] said I didn't earn this I haven't been
[1:05:08] here eight weeks of training I just went
[1:05:10] through one night and they've got to do
[1:05:11] it I think every at the end I think
[1:05:13] every Friday or every last week they've
[1:05:15] got to go and do this work in order to
[1:05:17] become a real sailor how many I
[1:05:20] appreciate that story I heard that
[1:05:22] thought mine if the US Army will spend a
[1:05:25] hundred million dollar I'm sorry the
[1:05:26] Navy will spend a hundred million
[1:05:28] dollars to help their soldiers overcome
[1:05:30] fear how much more will Jesus Christ
[1:05:32] help his body his army overcome fear and
[1:05:35] doubt and unbelief amen
[1:05:37] if the army if the Navy will do that how
[1:05:40] much more will God help you and I he
[1:05:44] will train us to overcome all fears and
[1:05:47] remind me of Jonah Jonah is in the belly
[1:05:49] of a whale and he sees all these things
[1:05:51] and he caught a revelation these are
[1:05:53] just simulations glory and that's what
[1:05:56] these soldiers could have said not but
[1:05:58] they're tired right so it's so simulated
[1:06:00] it's hard to see these things as
[1:06:01] simulations but church if the revelation
[1:06:04] of God could strike our hearts a day
[1:06:06] will see that sicknesses or or
[1:06:08] discouragements or trials or
[1:06:10] frustrations or depressions or whatever
[1:06:12] it may be
[1:06:12] they're just simulations right the
[1:06:15] Devils try to place it on us and but God
[1:06:17] is in control he won't give you a
[1:06:19] simulation you cannot handle a man you
[1:06:22] won't you won't let that water rise that
[1:06:24] you'll drown amen he really won't let
[1:06:26] you lose a soul praise God because God
[1:06:29] is in control he's allowing you to go
[1:06:31] through simulations that your fear will
[1:06:33] be cast out so you
[1:06:35] experience it but you'll know the next
[1:06:37] battle you'll be able to overcome any
[1:06:39] men I think that's a beautiful thought
[1:06:41] right there yeah yeah and then I listen
[1:06:47] to God called man yesterday from 1958
[1:06:49] well Aaron said when God gets ready to
[1:06:51] do something in the supernatural realms
[1:06:53] he usually gets a man he can put his
[1:06:55] trust in and anoints him and sends him
[1:06:58] out and he's fearless at the job that's
[1:07:03] the kind of men we need today not polish
[1:07:05] scholars but men who know God in the
[1:07:08] power of his resurrection glory then he
[1:07:11] gives some examples and we'll just go
[1:07:13] through a few brief examples for
[1:07:15] instance there was a man in the Bible by
[1:07:17] the name of Moses who had got all of his
[1:07:21] training he knowed all the theology he
[1:07:24] knew everything that he should know if
[1:07:26] he'd have needed education or education
[1:07:29] he could teach the Masters in in Egypt
[1:07:32] he didn't need one thing and the Bible
[1:07:34] tells us that he was learned and all the
[1:07:36] wisdom of the Egyptians why he could
[1:07:37] teach their scholars he could teach
[1:07:39] their scientists he was key to the very
[1:07:41] point when it comes to intellectual but
[1:07:45] yet it taking God 40 years listen 40
[1:07:48] years to beat all of that out of him
[1:07:51] there in the sand and when he got out
[1:07:54] all his intellectual conceptions of God
[1:07:56] beat out of him out there in the stands
[1:07:59] the metal was ready to be molded over
[1:08:02] amen glory and we know the burning bush
[1:08:06] was like the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:07] for Moses we know that that's when he
[1:08:10] got and God said I'm going with you he
[1:08:12] took off his shoes that we know it's
[1:08:13] it's dramatized that God stepped inside
[1:08:15] of him inside the shoes amen hallelujah
[1:08:19] so we see this that you know he was
[1:08:22] trained up so intellectually for a third
[1:08:23] of his life the second third God had to
[1:08:26] beat it all out of him now we know
[1:08:29] Israel wasn't ready after Moses first
[1:08:30] forty years but also Moses wasn't ready
[1:08:33] either because God works on both ends
[1:08:36] praise God
[1:08:38] Moses was not ready you know sometimes
[1:08:40] we get too hard on Israel they should
[1:08:41] have received Moses well maybe they
[1:08:42] should have but Moses wasn't ready
[1:08:44] either he was trying to kill a man to
[1:08:45] save him right a murderer he wasn't
[1:08:48] ready either
[1:08:49] because he had all this intellectualism
[1:08:50] pounded into his mind and God said I
[1:08:53] know how to train individuals I'm gonna
[1:08:55] send my prophet out there in the
[1:08:56] wilderness to beat all that
[1:08:58] intellectualism out him for 40 years I
[1:09:00] know how to train my men praise the Lord
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:05] everybody said that's the way god takes
[1:09:07] his man and beats out all their fears
[1:09:11] and all their intellectuals how many
[1:09:13] want their fears beaten out how many
[1:09:16] want your intellectuals beat out I'll be
[1:09:17] the first to raise my hand I know I want
[1:09:19] to try to understand everything I just
[1:09:21] want to believe it we want to we want to
[1:09:24] have the Holy Spirit reason and discern
[1:09:26] we do on that but when it comes down to
[1:09:28] our lives we don't want to
[1:09:30] intellectually reason or trying to
[1:09:31] understand intellectually we just want
[1:09:33] to believe God's Word amen and God
[1:09:36] Butler have said God knows how to do
[1:09:38] that he knows how to beat out all of our
[1:09:40] fears and our intellectuals he said then
[1:09:43] the great master Potter puts them on the
[1:09:46] wheel and begins to mold them over again
[1:09:49] workmen worthy he says it's God's man
[1:09:53] and listen this who could train a man
[1:09:56] more than God himself
[1:09:59] the Navy does a pretty good job don't
[1:10:02] think I think spending 60 million
[1:10:03] dollars don't you think that's a pretty
[1:10:04] good job I think that's a fantastic job
[1:10:07] I don't think I'd want to go in there
[1:10:09] for a 12-hour shift myself at least
[1:10:11] without seven weeks of training
[1:10:12] previously and try to last and go
[1:10:15] through the pressures and the noises and
[1:10:16] the strain the stress they're trying to
[1:10:18] inoculate you with fear fill you with
[1:10:20] stress so that you'll learn to overcome
[1:10:21] it but who could train a man more than
[1:10:27] God himself the Prophet said think about
[1:10:30] your life how God's trained you to this
[1:10:32] point and start thinking about that as
[1:10:35] we go a little bit further here think
[1:10:37] about what God has trained you with over
[1:10:41] the course of your life brother Branham
[1:10:43] said watch the way he trains them and
[1:10:48] then he goes through I remember I didn't
[1:10:52] finish the sermon because the last hour
[1:10:53] was prayer line but when I listened he
[1:10:55] went through three more men or three men
[1:10:57] including Moses went through Moses which
[1:10:59] we just went through then he went to
[1:11:01] David then he went to a lie
[1:11:03] shut those three examples and then he
[1:11:06] says he's running out of time he does
[1:11:07] the prayer line there so the Prophet
[1:11:11] said God had to take Moses out in the
[1:11:13] wilderness for forty years to beat out
[1:11:15] all the spheres remember he was scared
[1:11:18] of Pharaoh church right the Bible said
[1:11:21] they had to wait till the Pharaoh died
[1:11:23] and then a new Pharaoh rose I didn't
[1:11:25] know Moses right he wasn't mad at Moses
[1:11:28] and so brother Ram said you know he
[1:11:32] Moses and his wife had many arguments or
[1:11:34] temper tantrums out there on the
[1:11:35] backside of the desert in other words
[1:11:39] God was building patience with him God
[1:11:42] was trying to get him away from his
[1:11:44] intellectualism all the wisdom he
[1:11:47] learned in Egypt God is trying to beat
[1:11:49] that out of him and God took 40 years to
[1:11:51] beat this man a church we get impatient
[1:11:55] after one year we get impatient
[1:11:57] sometimes only as humans sometimes we've
[1:11:59] got to battle that impatience we get
[1:12:01] patient after 10 years well brother
[1:12:03] Jesse it's been 10 years since this and
[1:12:05] that net and gods like I used 40 with
[1:12:07] Moses I used 75 with Abraham right or in
[1:12:11] 25 extra after that to get into the
[1:12:13] promise why who could train a man more
[1:12:17] than God himself
[1:12:20] God is training us Church to get all of
[1:12:23] our intellectual pride out right and all
[1:12:27] of our fears about our calling in our
[1:12:30] life watch the way God does it watch how
[1:12:35] he does it he may do you like Moses he
[1:12:38] may give you a revelation right away
[1:12:40] I've got I got a ministry I got
[1:12:41] something to do I got something new for
[1:12:42] God but then you may fail and he may
[1:12:46] have to separate you and take you far
[1:12:48] away in order to beat all of your
[1:12:50] previous understanding out of you and
[1:12:51] then anoint you and send you back to do
[1:12:53] God's will he may do you like that
[1:12:56] but Arab said he may do you like David
[1:12:58] he said David had to be all alone he
[1:13:02] said all alone in the Shepherd's field
[1:13:04] that was David's battle that's the
[1:13:06] second when he goes to after Moses he
[1:13:08] said look at David look how God trained
[1:13:10] David he had to get him all alone away
[1:13:13] from his seven other brothers and get
[1:13:15] him out there singing and dancing and
[1:13:16] praise
[1:13:16] God with his sheep payment just the
[1:13:19] shepherd and his sheep praise God he had
[1:13:21] to get them all alone out there program
[1:13:24] said look at David's rugged training
[1:13:26] alone in the wilderness hallelujah
[1:13:28] Church don't we don't you feel like that
[1:13:30] sometimes in the church we feel like
[1:13:32] just so we're all alone we're one little
[1:13:34] one little fold in the wilderness praise
[1:13:37] God we're one little Church here in
[1:13:38] Akron Ohio just like they're all around
[1:13:40] in different places one little church
[1:13:42] there one little church there and
[1:13:43] program said that's God's rugged
[1:13:46] training he said he didn't send David to
[1:13:48] a school he sent him all alone to be a
[1:13:51] shepherd amongst the Sheep praise God he
[1:13:53] said when he's all alone out there
[1:13:55] brother man brother as a David now can
[1:13:57] hear the still small voice of the Lord
[1:14:01] so sometimes when you feel like you're
[1:14:03] alone Church the reason is so you can
[1:14:05] hear God's voice remember God who could
[1:14:09] train a man better than God who could
[1:14:12] train sisters better than God who could
[1:14:15] train our brothers better than God so
[1:14:19] Moses had to be separated from all his
[1:14:20] family all of his previous riches and
[1:14:22] and all those things David started his
[1:14:25] life separated and that's how he met God
[1:14:28] separate as a shepherd and sheep out in
[1:14:31] the waters all alone but around said
[1:14:33] David was not contaminated with the
[1:14:35] things of the world because he was all
[1:14:36] alone amen
[1:14:38] I've had brother my brother Tim Myers
[1:14:41] remember when he was here he started he
[1:14:42] actually started the meetings here in
[1:14:43] Akron in 2003 if I'm not mistaken
[1:14:46] maybe 2002 but he's called me numerous
[1:14:50] times over the years that we've talked
[1:14:51] and he said you know he said thank you
[1:14:53] said thank God for brother Brooks you
[1:14:55] know protecting us well Brooks never
[1:14:57] told us oh gods all these special
[1:14:58] meetings and and which there's nothing
[1:15:00] wrong with special meetings when you're
[1:15:01] mature but he said while we were
[1:15:02] immature
[1:15:03] you know because brother Tim now lived
[1:15:05] in North Carolina there's a lot of
[1:15:06] churches around there which can be good
[1:15:08] but some of them are off the word and
[1:15:10] they have what the Bible says enticing
[1:15:12] spirits they'll major on a minor right
[1:15:15] and they'll entice in the same which
[1:15:18] eventually leads into sin and and if
[1:15:19] it's not confessed that leads into all
[1:15:20] kinds of public sins but brother Tim and
[1:15:23] I would talk and he said well I'm just
[1:15:24] so thankful he said when I moved down
[1:15:25] here I didn't realize all the fanaticism
[1:15:27] that's around us having so many churches
[1:15:30] now God let some people grow up amongst
[1:15:32] those churches he said but we should be
[1:15:34] so thankful that brother Brooks
[1:15:35] protected us from those things and just
[1:15:37] tried to protect us like a shepherd with
[1:15:39] his sheep amen
[1:15:40] and I thought that's so true because of
[1:15:44] that we could hear the voice of the Lord
[1:15:45] and not be contaminated by things of the
[1:15:48] world amen
[1:15:49] but when I said God wants his shepherds
[1:15:52] to stand up for the Sheep praise God
[1:15:55] Rahab then God let up bear come into the
[1:15:59] David we know that and he said the
[1:16:02] Shepherd understand they're all alone in
[1:16:03] the wilderness he had to stand up and
[1:16:05] defeat that bear with a sling but my man
[1:16:08] said God God wasn't done because God
[1:16:11] knew there was a guy at the head he said
[1:16:13] so God had to raise the standard got it
[1:16:15] a lot of trial going that he could raise
[1:16:17] David's faith a little higher he said he
[1:16:19] understand the greatest of all beasts
[1:16:21] the lion the lamb said David took out a
[1:16:25] knife Church a hand knife brother Ram
[1:16:29] said that he said that lion killed all
[1:16:31] these men with one slap oh you said a
[1:16:33] few slaps of the paw he said he said
[1:16:35] David took a hold of that mane of the
[1:16:37] line and took his knife and stabbed the
[1:16:39] line and killed the line by the power of
[1:16:40] God amen
[1:16:43] so David knew what it was like to defeat
[1:16:45] the king of the beasts right but God
[1:16:48] raised that enemy in order to raise
[1:16:50] David's faith God was training his man
[1:16:53] to defeat a Goliath amen
[1:16:56] now if only he could have defeated that
[1:16:59] adultery and murder right David you
[1:17:00] understand what I'm saying that's the
[1:17:01] power of the Holy Ghost in this hour are
[1:17:03] you with me Church it was wonderful that
[1:17:05] Goliath was defeated hallelujah when it
[1:17:07] went off but even more wonderful if he
[1:17:10] would not have committed adultery and
[1:17:11] murdered Uriah are you with me but Rance
[1:17:14] not and leave a person with the Holy
[1:17:15] Ghost could come in adult
[1:17:24] you
[1:17:28] this since I believe because the
[1:17:30] comforter is living inside of them amen
[1:17:31] and the Bible said when the person
[1:17:34] commits adultery the Bible said they're
[1:17:35] destroying their own soul proverbs 6:23
[1:17:39] that's the scripture the Prophet said
[1:17:42] God can't use cowards he's all about
[1:17:44] David and how God watch how he trains
[1:17:47] them amen he said God wants gallant men
[1:17:52] not cowards
[1:17:54] he said God can only use a man who has
[1:17:57] faith hallelujah a man who could train a
[1:18:00] man more than God himself now he went a
[1:18:05] little bit on Elijah he said Elijah's
[1:18:08] training was first seeing the
[1:18:10] supernatural and Elijah he saw the
[1:18:12] supernatural God in Elijah he said but
[1:18:15] before that Elijah's training was
[1:18:18] driving the oxen to plow straight rows
[1:18:22] his brother and said after he lied you
[1:18:25] would leave he said he lied she would
[1:18:27] need to train some more men and if you
[1:18:29] look at Jay who anointed Jay who and
[1:18:31] different things like that he had some
[1:18:32] many I had to keep put in order by God's
[1:18:34] grace and point them on the straight and
[1:18:36] narrow so he grew up farming right and
[1:18:39] he got the drive he had to drive those
[1:18:41] oxen right he had to drive them and
[1:18:44] encourage them and move them and make
[1:18:46] them go straight praise God and that's
[1:18:49] the training that God gave him but once
[1:18:51] he saw the supernatural I show the
[1:18:53] prophet of the hour he said can I follow
[1:18:56] your knees and you know what I just said
[1:18:58] he did kind of give him kind like a
[1:19:00] little bird buek you know he said no
[1:19:02] just go back but license like no I'm
[1:19:04] gonna sell out he went back and you know
[1:19:06] killed the oxen and had a feast with his
[1:19:07] family and then he left and sold out
[1:19:09] praise God and bromance said Elisha knew
[1:19:12] what it was to put your hand to the plow
[1:19:15] and not look back because jesus said a
[1:19:18] man shouldn't put his hand to the plow
[1:19:19] and then look back at the world and say
[1:19:21] oh I really missed this from the world
[1:19:22] he said he'll I sure knew what he was
[1:19:24] doing praise God he sold out completely
[1:19:27] to follow the word of the hour God was
[1:19:30] training Elisha amen that's the way God
[1:19:36] takes his man and beats out all their
[1:19:38] fears and their intellectuals years
[1:19:41] and years of training years of training
[1:19:46] years of loneliness can I say like that
[1:19:50] years of feeling de-stressed years of
[1:19:55] battling fear no doubt Moses would fear
[1:19:57] that Pharaoh's really got it for me I
[1:19:59] could never go back and you know those
[1:20:00] forty years he was waiting how could I
[1:20:02] go back mine I know I know my mother
[1:20:05] told me this I know my mother was a real
[1:20:06] saint I know she said I was deliver my
[1:20:08] and just year after year of wrestling
[1:20:10] with this who could train a man more
[1:20:12] than God Himself amen God lets us go for
[1:20:17] years and months and weeks and I'm got
[1:20:19] you on the reverse order but it goes
[1:20:21] years and decades right and it's rugged
[1:20:25] training it's not easy training but
[1:20:28] that's how God trains a man and woman
[1:20:30] watch the way he trains and he says all
[1:20:36] these simulations that rise up in our
[1:20:39] lives amen aren't you glad God's the
[1:20:41] living reality praise God these trials
[1:20:43] are just simulations we just got to stay
[1:20:46] with the word we just got to be faithful
[1:20:48] right we just got to obey the Lord love
[1:20:50] the Lord
[1:20:50] and rise above all sin and all these
[1:20:52] simulations will end one day praise God
[1:20:54] that's exactly right
[1:20:56] I'm going to judges chapter six I just
[1:20:58] want to review Gideon real quick it's
[1:21:00] been a couple years since I've preached
[1:21:02] on him I just want to review some of his
[1:21:04] faith and let's look how God trained him
[1:21:08] judges chapter 6 because when I preach
[1:21:14] on getting what spoke to me from the
[1:21:16] Holy Spirit was how he overcame so much
[1:21:18] fear God keeps got God kept saying don't
[1:21:20] be afraid don't fear don't fear and then
[1:21:24] I hear brother Branham say the church's
[1:21:25] biggest problem is fear fear fear and so
[1:21:29] I believe this is very helpful for us
[1:21:31] today
[1:21:31] judges chapter six now you know the
[1:21:33] story the millions are many nights are
[1:21:36] taking all they're all their harvest and
[1:21:40] so they're hiding out they're leaving
[1:21:41] there but their lands are supposed to be
[1:21:43] possessing and they're living in caves
[1:21:44] and mountains they start crying out to
[1:21:47] God we're poor we have no food and God
[1:21:50] sent a prophet and God rebuked them
[1:21:52] through the Prophet because of and
[1:21:55] they're in bondage because of their own
[1:21:58] sins and then a verse 10 chapter 6 he
[1:22:02] said I am the Lord your God fear not the
[1:22:04] gods name writes in whose land ye dwell
[1:22:08] but she have not obeyed my voice so when
[1:22:11] people get in trials and they crowded to
[1:22:12] God God will remind them of the past God
[1:22:15] will remind them of the training and God
[1:22:17] will always say you need to obey my word
[1:22:22] think about the training God's allowing
[1:22:24] you in right now
[1:22:25] what kind of training is it you feel all
[1:22:28] alone you feel like the water is rising
[1:22:31] all the time like the Navy potential
[1:22:34] sailors you like the waters rising
[1:22:36] around you you feel like it's casually
[1:22:38] time you're just trying to save a soul
[1:22:39] you do anything to save a soul the
[1:22:42] training God knows how to train us amen
[1:22:46] and God said don't fear so when God sent
[1:22:50] the Prophet the prophets last words
[1:22:51] where don't fear obey the word of the
[1:22:54] Lord
[1:22:55] obey God's words stand behind God's word
[1:22:58] amen and watch it live hallelujah
[1:23:01] and then how was God training Gideon
[1:23:03] mother bear instead of Gideon was just a
[1:23:04] farmer and brother and said Gideon went
[1:23:07] out to church that day he heard the
[1:23:08] private preach he said and the Prophet
[1:23:10] went off the scene we don't even know
[1:23:11] where the Prophet went and so then
[1:23:13] Gideon goes hiding he hides right he's
[1:23:16] threshing wheat the Bible said and he
[1:23:18] hides and God says you're a mighty man
[1:23:20] of Valor and then he asked this great
[1:23:22] question my man said it was a scriptural
[1:23:23] question if God be with us
[1:23:25] why then is all this befallen us and
[1:23:27] where be all his miracles which our
[1:23:29] fathers told us of what does God say God
[1:23:35] says go in your might but yet he's
[1:23:39] afraid he said have not i sent thee he
[1:23:43] says where's all the miracles he said go
[1:23:44] you be the miracle I think let the
[1:23:47] miracle flow through you I'm gonna use
[1:23:49] you for a miracle praise God you see
[1:23:52] that going this thy might
[1:23:55] you've got some faith inside you get in
[1:23:57] you just gotta exercise that faith
[1:23:58] crisis in the ship you just gotta wake
[1:24:01] Christ up a man does every see that he
[1:24:05] said oh by my family's poor how can I be
[1:24:07] a saviour for Israel my
[1:24:09] family's poor I'm the least in my
[1:24:10] father's house and God makes the least
[1:24:13] the first many the last shall be first
[1:24:17] hallelujah testimony was I'm the least
[1:24:21] and God said I'm gonna make you first
[1:24:24] look at his training just a farmer a
[1:24:27] fearful farmer who heard the prophets
[1:24:30] word and he's like well I want to see
[1:24:31] this word fulfilled where is the God
[1:24:33] that God sent us a prophet I want to see
[1:24:35] the miracles and God said you go and be
[1:24:37] a miracle you go and have the Word of
[1:24:39] God in your heart how many want the Word
[1:24:41] of God in their heart today that you can
[1:24:43] be the miracle you can go in the might
[1:24:44] of God praise the Lord now in verse 17
[1:24:51] he asked for his first sign he said give
[1:24:54] me a sign that I've talked with you so
[1:24:56] get in before he has enough faith he
[1:24:59] needs signs from God to know that he's
[1:25:01] that so that he's not fearful and I've
[1:25:04] said this before this is how many of us
[1:25:06] some of us operate maybe we asked for
[1:25:08] God for a sign if God gives us a sign
[1:25:09] then he'll then we'll act upon it like
[1:25:12] the last time brother Simon went to
[1:25:14] Thailand he's going in a couple of weeks
[1:25:16] here but he said last time he went he he
[1:25:19] prayed and fast and said God give me two
[1:25:22] signs I'm supposed to go and I guess he
[1:25:25] was at work and saw the word Thailand on
[1:25:28] the truck really big I can't remember
[1:25:29] the exact ones and he said he saw two or
[1:25:33] three more witnesses I think he got four
[1:25:34] witnesses and he asked for two or three
[1:25:36] or something like that something along
[1:25:37] those lines in other words I know he
[1:25:38] told me God gave him more signs than
[1:25:40] what he wanted God went above and beyond
[1:25:43] because there's an element of fear
[1:25:45] wouldn't you have a little element of
[1:25:46] fear going to a place you never been
[1:25:47] there before
[1:25:48] well sure you would if you're if you're
[1:25:49] human right and so he asked God for two
[1:25:53] or three signs and God gave him more
[1:25:54] than he asked for and then he said then
[1:25:57] the brother then the third the last sign
[1:25:59] was the brother calm said have you made
[1:26:01] your decision yet has God given you the
[1:26:02] signs and he said that was the final
[1:26:04] sign he said how can I turn it down and
[1:26:07] look how God blessed gave him 14
[1:26:08] baptisms praise God and angels rejoice
[1:26:11] at one sinner that repents see that so
[1:26:16] many times we operate this way Lord I
[1:26:18] believe you're sending me but give me a
[1:26:20] sign first so that was the first sign
[1:26:22] God gave him the
[1:26:23] sign right the fire came down consume
[1:26:25] the sacrifice and who's talking with an
[1:26:27] angel but then God said go clean out the
[1:26:29] altars of your father in other words if
[1:26:33] you want to do them if you want to see a
[1:26:34] miracle go clean out your father's house
[1:26:39] anything any sin left over in your
[1:26:42] father father's house you've got to
[1:26:44] clean it out
[1:26:45] praise the Lord you see how God demands
[1:26:48] cleanliness see how God demands holiness
[1:26:51] God asks for sanctification praise God
[1:26:54] before I Drive out the many nights and
[1:26:56] deliver you and use you as a miracle
[1:26:58] worker we've got to drive out all the
[1:27:00] abominations in the church amen
[1:27:03] you've got to throw down the groves amen
[1:27:06] remember the Grove was the hiding place
[1:27:08] they go in the wilderness and they are
[1:27:09] in the Grove rather the grove of trees
[1:27:11] and they have sex acts they sacrifice
[1:27:13] babies all kinds of things they'd hide
[1:27:15] out and do these sins and God's cutting
[1:27:17] down those God had a Gideon cut down
[1:27:19] those groves remember what Gideon meant
[1:27:22] Heuer he was a cutter
[1:27:25] praise God mother have said profits are
[1:27:26] hewers they cut out the word of the Lord
[1:27:29] egg they cut with the Word of God amen
[1:27:30] and so Gideon does this he obeys the
[1:27:34] Word of God he cuts down there his
[1:27:37] father's grows and exposes all the sin
[1:27:40] and now gods get ready to use him amen
[1:27:42] it's exactly right so first he asked for
[1:27:46] a sign God gives it to him then he says
[1:27:48] now you obey you go drive out all the
[1:27:50] abominations of your father's house I
[1:27:52] preached that message in Minnesota I
[1:27:55] don't know if your mother's a couple
[1:27:57] years ago when brother brother Juan
[1:27:58] asked me to go out there and preach and
[1:28:00] I preached it rises to be near the
[1:28:01] service and as soon as I did the altar
[1:28:03] call sister come up and she said it's so
[1:28:05] hard I wanted to come up to the altar
[1:28:07] right when you preached it at the
[1:28:08] beginning of the message but she said
[1:28:09] I've been hiding out I'm a mom of so
[1:28:11] many kids I've been hiding out in my
[1:28:13] laundry room watching Netflix series of
[1:28:16] TV shows and she's weeping and crying
[1:28:18] and she said when you preach on Groves
[1:28:20] hiding out and I was think I was using a
[1:28:23] cellphone as an example I usually do you
[1:28:25] know her tablet
[1:28:26] she said as you were preaching that I
[1:28:27] was so convicted she said I appreciate
[1:28:30] the rest of your message but when that
[1:28:32] was preached that's what convicted me
[1:28:36] god knows what he's doing Church amen
[1:28:39] you see that's what people you got it we
[1:28:41] have to make this word speak to us today
[1:28:44] is that abomination hiding out and
[1:28:47] watching cussing swearing and think
[1:28:48] about all those women and men kissing
[1:28:50] all the fornication that's an
[1:28:51] abomination Church when they know better
[1:28:53] claiming to be in the message of the
[1:28:54] hour God help all of us to live a
[1:28:56] sanctified life and not hide out in sin
[1:29:00] right but this is what Gideon had to do
[1:29:01] he had to cut out any hidden sin in his
[1:29:03] father's house hallelujah then God could
[1:29:06] use him to save souls and to save the
[1:29:08] whole nation of Israel the second sign
[1:29:11] number was put a fleece on the wolf
[1:29:14] floor if it be dude on the fleece only
[1:29:16] and that's a verse 36 and 37 of chapter
[1:29:18] 6 he said if there if we dry up all in
[1:29:24] all the earth beside then shall I know
[1:29:26] all right
[1:29:27] that and then God let it do so when he
[1:29:29] rose up the Bible said he thrust the
[1:29:32] fleece together and all the water came
[1:29:33] out God gave him more than what he asked
[1:29:36] for church if you sincerely ask God for
[1:29:38] something God's gonna give you more than
[1:29:40] what you asked for
[1:29:41] just like we brother Simon just like
[1:29:43] we'd get in like with anyone who really
[1:29:45] cries out to God I want to be in your
[1:29:47] perfect will I have a burden do
[1:29:49] something for you Lord God give me a
[1:29:50] sign so I won't be afraid if you cry out
[1:29:53] God's gonna hear your cry and then the
[1:29:56] third sign he asked for was if I flip it
[1:30:00] over he said don't be hot against me
[1:30:01] he said but let this once more with the
[1:30:04] fleece let it now be dry only on the
[1:30:06] fleece side and upon all the ground
[1:30:10] let there be do and God did so that
[1:30:14] night and then remember God right after
[1:30:16] that he rose up he assembled the army
[1:30:18] together the first sermon he preached
[1:30:19] was anyone that's afraid I do you 32,000
[1:30:22] leave the camp that's his first sermon
[1:30:24] see Gideon was afraid but now he's
[1:30:27] overcoming it but now he's got to rid
[1:30:29] all the fear out of the army and so
[1:30:32] 22,000 leave he's left with 10,000 and
[1:30:35] then God said go down to the river all
[1:30:38] those that bow down like they're bowing
[1:30:41] to God he said all them have to leave
[1:30:43] right and he's left with 300 all those
[1:30:46] that lap it like a dog into the
[1:30:48] but I preach on that you know the the
[1:30:51] Britannica said or nothing' Britannica
[1:30:53] but the Bible dictionary said the
[1:30:54] dogwood would lick and sigh have his
[1:30:55] eyes open and so it typed how the the
[1:30:58] Israelites who weren't gonna be there
[1:31:00] we're used to bowing down to idols and
[1:31:02] didn't keep their eyes on the battle
[1:31:04] praise God brother Graham said the same
[1:31:06] thing about that they got to keep your
[1:31:09] eyes on the battle and so God said now
[1:31:12] I've got 300 and you remember there was
[1:31:14] one more fear that Gideon had it's in
[1:31:18] verse 10 of chapter 7 God sends the
[1:31:21] little fear because now these 300 men
[1:31:23] surround the army
[1:31:25] that's the multitude of the sand of the
[1:31:27] sea church 300 men and he's got one for
[1:31:31] you still got living a fear and God is
[1:31:33] so merciful God's merciful when you have
[1:31:35] a little bit of fear left he's merciful
[1:31:38] because he still wants you to do the job
[1:31:39] he's called you to do verse 10 but God
[1:31:43] said but if thou fear to go down go thou
[1:31:48] with furrow thy servant down to the
[1:31:50] hosts and thou shalt hear what they say
[1:31:53] and afterwards shall bind hands be
[1:31:55] strengthened to go down into the hosts
[1:31:57] then he went down with first servant
[1:31:59] under the outside of the armed men that
[1:32:01] were in the host you remember the story
[1:32:02] they walk up to a tent he's walking by
[1:32:04] the tent and he overhears a midnight
[1:32:06] soldier and he just woke up from a
[1:32:08] nightmare well was a nightmare for him
[1:32:10] but it was a blessing for Gideon he said
[1:32:13] all he said I saw a barley bread a loaf
[1:32:16] of barley bread rolling down a hill and
[1:32:17] it hit our tents and all the midnight
[1:32:19] tents fell and he said that the barley
[1:32:22] loaf is nothing but Gideon amen and then
[1:32:25] when getting heard that the Bible said
[1:32:27] he fell on his knees and started
[1:32:28] worshiping see God will give you
[1:32:30] everything you need so you're fearless
[1:32:32] watch how God trains his men
[1:32:35] nobody can train a man better than God
[1:32:37] hallelujah so if you need signs God will
[1:32:40] give you signs if you need a burning
[1:32:42] bush God will give you a burning bush if
[1:32:44] you need a line and bear God will give
[1:32:46] you a line and bear I'll give you a
[1:32:47] slingshot he'll give you whatever you
[1:32:49] have need up wait upon the Lord obey his
[1:32:51] voice and watch how God trains you to
[1:32:53] overcome for his name watch him do it
[1:32:56] nobody can do it better than God Church
[1:32:59] nobody can do it
[1:33:02] like he can we just have to sit still
[1:33:04] let him beat out all the fear and all
[1:33:07] the intellectualism out of our lives to
[1:33:10] think we know more about it than
[1:33:11] everybody else
[1:33:12] pummel ourselves like Moses had to like
[1:33:17] Gideon had to getting that it put God to
[1:33:20] his test like the Bible said with ties
[1:33:21] and offerings prove me getting is the
[1:33:23] same thing with this this America Lord
[1:33:24] you wanted to send me prove it to me
[1:33:26] please
[1:33:26] prove that you're gonna use me and 299
[1:33:29] other men to defeat this innumerable
[1:33:32] army and God did it huh me no God did it
[1:33:34] praise God amen beautiful picture there
[1:33:37] now let me try to give me about 10 more
[1:33:39] minutes to close here by God's grace
[1:33:40] yeah one more thought I want to bring
[1:33:42] with this here this OK by God's grace
[1:33:44] are you glad he's training you to
[1:33:46] overcome fear this is more like a
[1:33:49] encouraging message to encourage you
[1:33:51] that it's patience in patience possess
[1:33:53] our souls he will push out he'll beat
[1:33:56] out all fear all intellectual
[1:33:58] understanding any any lusts or pride or
[1:34:00] whatever's hindering our walk with God
[1:34:02] and keeping us from God's will for our
[1:34:06] lives he'll beat it out we've just got
[1:34:08] to stay in his training how they'd hear
[1:34:10] yeah I want to close now kai would you
[1:34:19] put this slideshow up here by God speak
[1:34:22] I just want to show this last picture
[1:34:26] here I want to close with this just give
[1:34:28] me about 10 more minutes
[1:34:29] I just want to show how we're trained to
[1:34:32] overcome fear I just want to show our
[1:34:34] brother branham was trained to overcome
[1:34:35] fear is this okay I just want to close
[1:34:38] with this a few weeks ago I preached on
[1:34:40] this those if you look in Joshua 3:10
[1:34:43] God lifts that list these seven nations
[1:34:45] that were greater and mightier than
[1:34:47] Israel and God was going to drive them
[1:34:50] all out and I'm you know and I I started
[1:34:55] thinking about this and and you know I
[1:34:57] really believe this is a Golden Nugget
[1:34:59] myself but that's just me you know but I
[1:35:03] started looking at what they did you
[1:35:04] know Canaanite met merchants or
[1:35:05] possessions and that to me it typed for
[1:35:08] the New Testament love of money and
[1:35:09] possessions and things Hittites means
[1:35:12] sons of half and half means dread or
[1:35:14] fear
[1:35:15] that's clearly interpreted by their
[1:35:16] names Hittites were the Gibeonites and
[1:35:18] what they did now their name didn't mean
[1:35:20] anything significant but what they did
[1:35:21] was they made a league with Israel and
[1:35:23] that types friendship or compromise with
[1:35:25] the world that's where I get that
[1:35:27] perizzites
[1:35:28] meant they were farmers they worked the
[1:35:30] ground and the the ground represents the
[1:35:33] the flesh because the man with the one
[1:35:36] tail buried his talent in the earth the
[1:35:38] earth the ground so he buried it instead
[1:35:40] of putting it to work for the kingdom of
[1:35:42] God that represents carnal flesh means
[1:35:44] carnal right your carnal mind had Paul
[1:35:46] said that first Corinthians three
[1:35:47] girgashites means those who dwell in the
[1:35:49] clay and and the Bible said if we're not
[1:35:51] upon the rock then we're in the miry
[1:35:53] clay so clay represents instability not
[1:35:57] obeying the Word of God yet we know it
[1:35:59] and these are all battles again remember
[1:36:02] these are all battles that we face after
[1:36:05] we've crossed Jordan right after you're
[1:36:08] born again so you have great training
[1:36:09] that takes place before you're born
[1:36:11] again and even greater training that
[1:36:13] takes place after you're born again it's
[1:36:15] exactly right am rights were giants and
[1:36:20] so I call this a giant lust or a great
[1:36:22] fleshly lusts they were giants and then
[1:36:28] Jebusite means strong jabu jabu jabus in
[1:36:32] the dictionary one of the names is
[1:36:34] stronghold one of the name mean the
[1:36:37] meaning of the name is stronghold and a
[1:36:38] stronghold is the complex in 2nd
[1:36:40] Corinthians chapter 6 the Bible said we
[1:36:41] can't build up strongholds and I was
[1:36:44] just just inspired me Church let's so
[1:36:47] let's just close with a few minutes that
[1:36:48] look at how brother Branham had to deal
[1:36:49] with all these so can ever understand
[1:36:51] where I'm kind of going with this I want
[1:36:52] to show you how God trained a modern-day
[1:36:54] prophet many of these will be familiar
[1:36:56] to you so just bear with me maybe they
[1:36:58] won't I don't know
[1:37:02] so brother Branham said the first the
[1:37:06] Canaanites will be loving money I mean
[1:37:07] no the Prophet battled money brother
[1:37:10] branham's talked about the three things
[1:37:11] ministers faced and he said I wasn't
[1:37:15] much afraid he said of the popularity of
[1:37:18] women but the test of money that was the
[1:37:21] thing that bothered me so brother Rams
[1:37:26] greatest attempt
[1:37:27] a freeze got the Holy Ghost now was the
[1:37:30] test of money right he got to a spot he
[1:37:35] said for nine years my meetings were
[1:37:37] going great so let's see 47 plus 9
[1:37:40] I've been 56 right he said my meetings
[1:37:43] were growing great he said I get a
[1:37:44] thousand letters a day but he said all
[1:37:45] of a sudden 56 of course we know America
[1:37:48] rejected the gospel in that year he said
[1:37:50] all of a sudden went down from a
[1:37:51] thousand letters of dates he said about
[1:37:53] 75 I got the quotes if you want them but
[1:37:55] the time time he said then he went to
[1:37:57] California and I lost $5,000 in one
[1:38:00] meeting and the next meeting I lost
[1:38:02] $10,000 so now he's in debt $15,000 and
[1:38:07] you remember what he did he went home
[1:38:10] and told his wife and Billy Paul I'm
[1:38:12] done on the field he said daddy won't
[1:38:14] you Billy said daddy won't to you if you
[1:38:16] don't preach the gospel he said I'm
[1:38:18] still gonna preach I never said I'm not
[1:38:19] gonna breach he said but I told God but
[1:38:24] I said I told God that if I go on the
[1:38:26] field I'll never go into debt and if I
[1:38:28] do I'll quit and Billy Paul got
[1:38:29] brotherman said god bless Billy Paul
[1:38:31] later for this Billy Paul said some
[1:38:33] inspiring words to encourage his daddy
[1:38:35] he said daddy God never told you to come
[1:38:38] off the field he said you made that
[1:38:39] promise to God right God never said if
[1:38:43] you get in debt you have to quit
[1:38:45] preaching out in the field and then God
[1:38:47] took brother Ram through a few visions
[1:38:49] remember there's a fishing vision a fish
[1:38:52] fishing vision about the lure and
[1:38:54] there's someone there's so much involved
[1:38:56] here but then he the third mission was
[1:38:59] the little tent so after he's struggling
[1:39:01] you know I'm going off the field I'm
[1:39:03] gonna go down there to Mister he said a
[1:39:05] bar and ask him I get my job back he
[1:39:07] said God showed him the vision of the
[1:39:09] third pole and he said that encouraged
[1:39:12] him to get back on the field
[1:39:14] praise God so God gave him three visions
[1:39:15] don't leave the field stay on the field
[1:39:18] but you see how he battled money he
[1:39:21] battled money so much so that when he
[1:39:23] saw the debt he thought he failed God
[1:39:25] but he never failed God it was a test to
[1:39:28] overcome the canaanites amen
[1:39:30] hallelujah brother and thought he failed
[1:39:33] God but he didn't fail God God was just
[1:39:36] showing him your ministry is gonna
[1:39:38] change a man we're
[1:39:40] going to the big meetings anymore now
[1:39:41] we're going down to the third poll the
[1:39:43] opening of the word the spoken word
[1:39:46] hallelujah everybody see that he had a
[1:39:49] battle this in his ministry this was
[1:39:51] 1956 he had to battle that I'm leaving
[1:39:54] the field and God had to use his son and
[1:39:57] wife was weeping crying begging him not
[1:39:59] to leave the field but he said I'm a God
[1:40:01] a promise
[1:40:04] so we can see that what a temptation
[1:40:07] that was money this is something he
[1:40:10] battled after getting in the promised
[1:40:12] land next fear brother Ram said before
[1:40:16] he started preaching he said all the
[1:40:19] ministers told him his visions were
[1:40:20] other Devils remember that dr. Davis and
[1:40:22] he said all the local ministers said it
[1:40:23] was the devil he went to his cave there
[1:40:25] in Jeffersonville to pray he said God
[1:40:28] take this away from me
[1:40:29] and you remember late into the night God
[1:40:31] sent the angel the Lord and the angel
[1:40:34] Lord told him not to fear in fact let me
[1:40:38] read the exact quote here so then you
[1:40:39] can have that because he said you'll
[1:40:46] pray for kings and potentates and
[1:40:48] monarchs and all these things and then
[1:40:54] he says he's notable words he says no
[1:41:02] fear he says this he's in my commission
[1:41:06] he said I'd be given two signs when I
[1:41:09] told him that I was afraid people
[1:41:10] wouldn't believe me this is the 1946 he
[1:41:13] said I'd be given two signs as the
[1:41:16] prophet Moses was given to vindicate or
[1:41:19] make plain to any people that I'm
[1:41:21] telling you the truth but the angel says
[1:41:24] I'm gonna send you forward brother and
[1:41:25] I'm afraid they're not gonna believe me
[1:41:27] and God said I'm gonna give you signs to
[1:41:29] take away your fear and I read this a
[1:41:31] few weeks ago 1955 brother Hannah said
[1:41:33] night after night he said I stand before
[1:41:35] witch doctors and critics they try to
[1:41:37] throw spells on me challenged me to
[1:41:39] duels and never one time I say by the
[1:41:42] grace of God has one speck of fear ever
[1:41:44] hid my heart can you imagine that witch
[1:41:48] doctors cursing with blood and they're
[1:41:49] doing all kinds of evil things and not
[1:41:51] one time did he ever
[1:41:53] a speck of fear why because the Lord
[1:41:55] told him I'll be with you and I've given
[1:41:57] you signs in that beautiful Church
[1:42:00] hallelujah he was afraid how can I do
[1:42:03] this and the angel says I'm giving you
[1:42:05] the signs I'm giving you power
[1:42:07] hallelujah
[1:42:10] how many know that brother Branham was
[1:42:11] scared of dying until 1960 how many knew
[1:42:14] that in the fifth seal he tells us that
[1:42:17] and the fifth seal if you listen to that
[1:42:18] he thought was scared of dying
[1:42:20] he thought I would be a said I thought
[1:42:22] I'd be a spook or cloud he said I
[1:42:24] thought I'd be a cloud floating past and
[1:42:26] I'd wave and say hi brother Neville
[1:42:27] how're you doing he said but I could
[1:42:29] never reach out and touch him he said I
[1:42:31] didn't want to be a spook he said then
[1:42:34] God took him behind the curtain of time
[1:42:35] in 1960 I remember that by God's grace
[1:42:39] so he battled this for how many years of
[1:42:41] ministry here over 20 23 years he
[1:42:45] battled those Hittites for 23 years
[1:42:48] until God gave him victory and said
[1:42:50] you're not gonna fear you know where
[1:42:52] you're going you know it's beyond the
[1:42:53] curtain amen how did it yeah it's
[1:42:56] exactly right can you see how the
[1:42:58] Prophet battled these things these these
[1:43:01] these nations greater than him right
[1:43:03] these spirits greater than him see how
[1:43:05] he battled that we might battle the same
[1:43:07] church Hittites was a compromise in 1963
[1:43:14] brother BAM told a story about how a and
[1:43:17] is's is your life were the gospel it's
[1:43:22] some Pentecostal leader he doesn't give
[1:43:24] the name that I that I read but he's
[1:43:27] talking about how the Pentecostals won't
[1:43:30] come to the spiritual feasts he's
[1:43:31] talking minute typing it to one of
[1:43:32] Jesus's parables they won't come to the
[1:43:34] feast they they're not they make light
[1:43:36] of Jesus invitation to come to the feast
[1:43:38] in Matthew 22 minister offered him money
[1:43:43] if he compromised and not preached on
[1:43:46] certain doctrines finish up here the man
[1:43:56] looked at him and said he says a shame
[1:43:58] that you're taking he said you can
[1:44:00] hardly buy yourself a meal look you're a
[1:44:02] Robertson look how all these other men
[1:44:05] and you they don't even have 100
[1:44:07] the ministry you got AI said yeah that's
[1:44:09] right that's right he said my group will
[1:44:13] take you in as one of our brethren will
[1:44:15] give you the right hand of fellowship
[1:44:16] will charter you a plank imagine having
[1:44:18] your own charter plane and I'll give you
[1:44:21] your wages of five hundred dollars a
[1:44:22] week or more if you want it which today
[1:44:27] equals to two hundred seventeen thousand
[1:44:29] dollars a year and people are selling
[1:44:31] out the message for less than that
[1:44:32] and he said we'll pay you five hundred
[1:44:36] dollars a week which is over like I said
[1:44:37] two hundred thousand my man said well
[1:44:40] what do you what else did not preach he
[1:44:43] said oh you know your baptism and you
[1:44:45] kind of baptize like oneness and said oh
[1:44:48] he said yeah you know the initial
[1:44:50] evidence you got to preach the tongues
[1:44:51] are initial evidence they said oh the
[1:44:53] women preachers just a few things like
[1:44:55] that if you'll just compromise with a
[1:44:58] goodnights remember God told Joshua
[1:45:00] don't make any league when you come in
[1:45:01] that land
[1:45:02] don't make any compromise don't take
[1:45:05] their money and not preach the truth
[1:45:07] preach all the truth amen hallelujah if
[1:45:10] God so clothe the grass of the field how
[1:45:13] much more will he clothe you and I
[1:45:14] hallelujah if God feeds the sparrows and
[1:45:17] who they don't even plant or reap Jesus
[1:45:19] says right or reap or so if God feeds
[1:45:22] them how much more will he feed us o us
[1:45:24] of little faith at times right he's with
[1:45:27] us he's gonna feed us he's gonna help us
[1:45:31] he said uh-huh he said you know I'm
[1:45:33] surprised that one servant of God would
[1:45:35] ask another servant of God after paying
[1:45:38] the tribute to me like you did calling
[1:45:39] me a prophet and knowing the word Lord
[1:45:41] or the revelation of the word comes the
[1:45:43] prophet and turnaround dr. Pope he calls
[1:45:47] him and woods okay maybe it is dr. poopy
[1:45:49] and would ask one servant of God to
[1:45:52] compromise on one revelation amen
[1:45:56] hallelujah that was in 1963 he overcame
[1:46:00] the Hittites he preached for all those
[1:46:04] years Church all those years and he's
[1:46:06] still battling some of these great
[1:46:08] compromises
[1:46:09] imagine being offering you offer two
[1:46:11] hundred thousand dollars if you'll just
[1:46:12] compromise and don't don't talk about
[1:46:14] this and he turned it down
[1:46:17] hallelujah by the power of God God knows
[1:46:20] how to train
[1:46:20] men hallelujah that's right church
[1:46:23] all right parasites Karl this is the
[1:46:26] ground farmers carnal mindedness I just
[1:46:29] go some quick examples brother random
[1:46:31] uses carnal mind when his mother-in-law
[1:46:33] called those Pentecostal people a bunch
[1:46:34] of trash I had to learn from that
[1:46:36] experience use his carnal mind and he
[1:46:38] compromised where we're not compromising
[1:46:40] she's his carnal mind he's thinking yeah
[1:46:42] I better not take his or her daughter
[1:46:45] out there amongst those Pentecostal
[1:46:46] people brother random catered to the men
[1:46:49] in South Africa and got amoebas remember
[1:46:51] that carnal minded he should not have
[1:46:55] left and the angel said you'll suffer
[1:46:57] for that and he got amoebas yet Church
[1:47:01] did he already have the Holy Ghost yeah
[1:47:03] he's already born-again God knows how to
[1:47:06] beat out every infirmity out of us God
[1:47:08] knows how to beat out I say any weakness
[1:47:10] out of us if we just wait upon the Lord
[1:47:14] I'm finishing up girgashites worst was
[1:47:17] the clay and brother branham battled
[1:47:19] Protestant denomination no ministers his
[1:47:21] whole ministers whole ministry in fact
[1:47:24] when he was preaching the church ages in
[1:47:25] 1960s I was listening to all those and
[1:47:27] reading through those where the RAM said
[1:47:28] the revelation of the mark of the beast
[1:47:30] finally struck him during that series
[1:47:32] and then afterwards if you watch the
[1:47:34] quotes then he's got enough confidence
[1:47:36] to say thus saith the Lord
[1:47:37] denominationalism is the mark of the
[1:47:39] beast because he saw how the mark of the
[1:47:41] beast was working you know kind of
[1:47:43] tempted Polycarp a little bit we've
[1:47:44] talked about that a little bit
[1:48:57] am rice just loves this is when I had a
[1:49:00] hard time with maybe in me out with that
[1:49:02] but the only one I really saw Bali and
[1:49:04] fleshy lust was he talked about I had
[1:49:06] when you see waiting on the put a Austin
[1:49:08] are that's the woman I can really simply
[1:49:11] fled lust giant things right giant
[1:49:14] battles of fleshy lust
[1:49:15] that's fleshly cravings I couldn't find
[1:49:19] a hole out of that and lassies complex
[1:49:22] he's fifty for your dog and he turned
[1:49:26] nineteen sixty-three driving back some
[1:49:28] meetings out less and he's determined
[1:49:30] he's gonna go through the wilderness and
[1:49:33] God has to correct him and say don't
[1:49:35] leave churches he got a fax they won't
[1:49:39] hear my preaching on on women's holiness
[1:49:41] and men's holiness then they don't have
[1:49:42] to hear I didn't at the beach I'll go
[1:49:45] wait up in the wilderness I went up in
[1:49:46] there they don't have to hear about it
[1:49:48] and when hog is muscle or I'll come down
[1:49:50] and Thunder it out and the Holy Spirit
[1:49:53] talking don't do that how many over that
[1:49:55] by God's grace his last fate temptation
[1:49:58] let's stand to our feet
[1:50:02] God is good church God is training us to
[1:50:05] overcome all of our trucks now I'm very
[1:50:09] thankful for that many tires we know
[1:50:12] maybe understand why our life has all
[1:50:15] these different brows we don't
[1:50:19] understand God is doing the training God
[1:50:26] wants us to learn to fight for every
[1:50:27] inch of ground and stand toe-to-toe
[1:50:29] Satan I love that that's the way God
[1:50:35] takes this man beats out of all of the
[1:50:38] speakers and all the intellectuals who
[1:50:42] could train a man more think I'm self
[1:50:44] watch the way strange them this train
[1:50:50] you if you despise I think about your
[1:50:55] life think about the training you had to
[1:50:58] endure it's very valuable to God
[1:51:04] God has allowed simulations to come we
[1:51:07] call in symptoms
[1:51:10] maybe it's loneliness like David maybe
[1:51:14] it's fear like Moses afraid for four
[1:51:17] years
[1:51:22] maybe it's David the suspense of great
[1:51:25] beasts and great giant animals coming at
[1:51:28] you unexpected you got to the jump in
[1:51:33] your life maybe it's like I should work
[1:51:37] in a group dry driving in a straight
[1:51:40] line

[1:51:43] with the law bringing you the bride say
[1:51:50] like oh then you can yourself
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:27] let's having that no one can train a man
[1:52:31] better than God itself you've been full
[1:52:40] confidence but that's training for your
[1:52:43] life Heavenly Father you saw a hands
[1:52:47] Lord you promised to be an ever present
[1:52:50] help in time of trouble or your training
[1:52:55] up to overcome or worse tracking message
[1:53:01] to
[1:53:05] may you give us the patience Lord may
[1:53:08] give us the perseverance Lord all it is
[1:53:11] what we call spiritual simulations
[1:53:14] hardships trials fears no leanest
[1:53:19] temptations love of possessions as we
[1:53:23] saw with the prophet of God this carnal
[1:53:28] thinking compromising on the word we
[1:53:34] need you Jesus we need you Lord
[1:53:41] we're watching our lives and we're
[1:53:43] seeing how your trading us or done help
[1:53:46] us beat the dead and Lourdes forty give

[1:53:50] knowledge we worship for it is perfect
[1:53:54] love that will cast out all fear cast
[1:53:58] out all confusion it'll cast out all
[1:54:01] doubt all unbelief and we think about
[1:54:05] how much you can't bear for us let us
[1:54:08] sing this song and also an offering of
[1:54:13] thanksgiving reminded of how much you
[1:54:17] care for us
[1:54:20] Dona I know you care for me God because
[1:54:23] the Bible says helping overcome these
[1:54:28] simulations Martin if it's so valuable
[1:54:31] for the Navy
[1:54:32] how much more from real soldiers so just
[1:54:36] across Heavenly Father we ask that you
[1:54:43] bless your people Lord Jesus with
[1:54:46] patience with strength with confidence
[1:54:49] with the ability to speak your word and
[1:54:52] not our word help me Lord to speak your
[1:54:55] word I'm gonna drive out the intent
[1:54:58] right about the hivite it's so powerful
[1:55:06] to see your prophet battling these
[1:55:08] things being trained for all these years
[1:55:11] so that when a man offers an 220000 he
[1:55:15] says absolutely not the
[1:55:17] about these important money the
[1:55:20] revelation of the message are more
[1:55:22] important than houses and lands and
[1:55:23] money thank you Jesus for trading your
[1:55:26] profit in such a way help us so watch
[1:55:29] how you're draining our lives so we
[1:55:31] don't get discontented we don't hit the
[1:55:33] scourge we don't get depressed because

[1:55:59] training rejection no no it was a big
[1:56:02] part of that or company but we're
[1:56:06] confident that you care for us because
[1:56:08] we care for your word and your word says
[1:56:11] you died for us first based upon your
[1:56:14] life the minister now going to fill us
[1:56:21] with strengthen the inner man may we be
[1:56:24] renewed at the spirit of our man as we
[1:56:26] worship may we offer a sacrifice the
