TRANSCRIPT
========================================
christ as the deer right like solomon said solomon's wife was look was solomon come down like a deer and just flow down in the mountains come quickly it was just beautiful i don't know i can't do it justice right now but uh if you didn't hear that one you'll like that one praise god further revelation and that ties in with how judah remember judah was prophet prophesied of christ as well he would hold the scepter right judah would hold it until shiloh came that was jesus christ praise god so what a blessing my we're just we're just enjoying the word today praise god and that when i hear that that makes me want to fulfill god's call for my life amen i may not have like a scripture about me like individually but i know i'm a part of the body of christ i know i'm a part of the bride of christ and there's numerous scriptures about the bride that i have a part in fulfilling praise god and so god will bless you and uh god will bless us as we look to the word of god this morning 33 verse 20 and 21 let's read that together and we'll read our memory verse from brother stephen here so verses 20 and 21 about gad let's read that on three one two three and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head verse 21 and he provided the first part for himself because there in a portion of the law giver was he seated and he came with the heads of the people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgments with israel beautiful scripture beautiful prophecy some of these words were fulfilled 600 years later or more this is just a beautiful prophecy how many knows god can't lie and if god speaks a word that word cannot return void amen that's bower heads and word of prayer how many would say brother just pray for me uh please pray for me as well i just need your prayers here today and i'm just expecting god to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think today father in heaven we just come reverently before your throne of mercy god and we just recognize you you're the source of our life the source of our strength hallelujah you set up angel armies around us lord god thank you god for protecting us lord i think of the blands driving so far and your angels protecting them hallelujah on the busy highways lord and of course uh stephen's long drive as well lord and those of us that live closely god we're thankful for all the protection lord god you have angel armies to protect those lord and you send those angels to minister to us we thank you god and as we see lord all the times you minister to us we thank you and give you praise for being so faithful you're the faithful god and we give you thanks and praise today lord bless your people today speak through the word lord god to them help me to be a humble vessel i'm nothing lord i i'm no preacher as far as my own self i want to draw strength from you may you preach today lord i may you do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think and just speak to us through thy word we pray give us that portion that we have need of today or there's some that have a need of maybe healing today there's some that need of encouragement or forgiveness or or lord victory lord or or consolation lord i just pray god minister to each one their divine portion god feed them today feed your sheep i pray including me in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you being seated praise god so i do have uh slides here uh by the grace of the lord i was just listening that song whom shall i fear but i heard brother randy sing that i was like okay good i was like man i want to sing that so thank you hallelujah that's a beautiful song thank god so let's look to the word of god here today i'm just trusting god to speak to you and it's just it's a just amazing subject the more i study this the more joyful i get about it because i can finally understand it after all these years and i can see the i can see uh how you take everything back to the word of god now just briefly here um you know let me back up from last week i remember last week when i forgot something i was in the middle of a thought you remember that and i just forgot well i went and listened this morning and i remember what i was going to say so forgive me i'm going to go show you what i was going to say i was dealing with this thought about i was just mentioning uh rick warren's purpose-driven life right and then all of a sudden i'm like what was i talking about okay uh sometimes that happens to me so let me find that i want to show that illustration of brazil but i just drew some pictures into it um uh where i didn't have all these notes yeah there it is okay so i was dealing with this last sunday morning i was in the middle of a thought i was just opening the sermon uh and trying to remind everybody about this i remember sister elizabeth was here last week and stephen i remember them and we were talking about this but you and i this is what we've come to we've come not to brazil this is actually a map of brazil but i just found it because the first one i could find that had no uh political lines drawn on it uh and i thought well this is like us in the baptism of the holy ghost right and especially for me as a pastor i can't even pastor until i bring my own home into subjection so i cannot possess the pastor land until i get the victory in my own personal life and we saw that in manasseh remember manasseh said joshua give us more land we're out and josh is like no you go take the land that's got woods on it and they said well we can't take it because of the chariots of iron right and so god uh god used joshua to give them strength and say no you will take it so they were afraid they wanted somebody else's land because they they were afraid to take their own land right and so we found that that's how a lot of new testament christians are they want to go somewhere else or find something else to do rather than take care of the giants in their own life and we're all guilty of it like we all run from our problems right sometimes can everybody say amen on that one i'm not the only one right we we all we all run from our problems at times because they look too big to us but god is faithful and if we'll just take courage from joshua the holy ghost if we listen to the holy ghost then god will give us great victories in our lives amen so i was talking about this last week right and i was going into how rick warren you know the book is excellent other than two thoughts i found two trinitarian thoughts in there that are wrong but other than that it's a great bible study and it's a great teaching and then i after i read that i preached a series on purpose right uh and then i lost track of my thought well what i was going to was in that series on purpose i taught i i went back and preached on a sister in branham tabernacle named mrs ford i don't know if you remember that she's a black sister and she died brother ram did the funeral and brother man was talking about the next sunday after the funeral and brother bam said look mrs ford uh this this elderly black woman she fulfilled all of god's will for her life and he was yeah he had their the uh the the widow the husband and the children sitting right there up front and brother bam says mr ford and boys he said could you have asked for a better mother than mrs ford and you can hear him say no could you have asked for a better wife mr ford than mrs ford no and so that tells you she possessed the land and her relationships the kids and dad couldn't ask for a better mom than that and then brother ram said do you remember how she all used to always come up here and testify and praise the lord and remember how she used to sing song specials he said she was such a blessing to us and so we can see that she possessed her location right she stayed in her place she's a housewife she possessed there she was in jeffersonville and the gifts of ministries now we know we're not given all the details on that but that woman was a blessing in the house of god and brother oh yeah i said she'd always shot a good healthy amen so she had some zeal about her you know maybe god called her to be a little more verbal than other women which is okay some men aren't verbal either like that you know god has a variety of people but that's the thought i was going to get to that here's a woman elderly black woman she dies and brother ram can come afterwards and say now look she did all the will of god for her life he said just a humble housewife like mrs ford amen now look what if she would have been married twice what has she been married three times what if she would have abused her children but she didn't church she was faithful she possessed all the gates of the enemies amen hallelujah praise god and then i went into this thought now that's what i forgot okay but here's another thought i want to finish from last sunday too i talked about billy graham billy graham never led people to this land billy graham led him out of egypt but then he stopped right there can you imagine this he crossed through he crossed through the red sea billy graham did with his people and let the waters come down he said and then he told him praise god you're in the promised land right because i've seen billy graham's book i saw it on google right he says once you're born again i'm sorry once you confess and repent you're completely born again and baptized with the holy ghost that's nonsense and church as proof of that i looked it up this morning as proof of that numerous daughters of brother branham have been divorced and married other ones see they never possess the gates of their marriages what did i say i'm sorry did i say brother brandon or i'm sorry i meant billy graham thank you see that's my correction can we let's give her uh no let's say praise the lord amen praise the lord i didn't mean to say that see that's just a slip of the tongue just like brother ram said uh uh rebecca went to marry her bride brother baby said that like five times and she didn't go to marry a bride bride groom it's just a slip of the tongue so forgive me brother billy graham brother billy graham his daughters many of them are enough men a couple of them have been divorced one of them has been divorced three times and is now in the fourth marriage and billy graham supported it that proves he wasn't a prophet of god right he just had a gift evangelize brother man said nobody can preach salvation like billy graham that's true go listen to his services you can listen to them they're they're they're tremendous he has such zeal and force for salvation but he just he got him past the red sea and the waters come down and they say okay now you're in the land in church they're just wandering around they're wondering from this marriage to that marriage now what about some of his sons well i read a little bit about that but one of his sons is a preacher and supports women preachers that's not that's not very good that's not that's not really because those women that preach they're not even possessed in the land of their gifts and ministries they're actually encroaching into somebody else's territory a surfing authority right and then brother billy graham it's on record billy graham said his daughter's a preacher and he said his daughter is the best preacher in the family now can you imagine that she's a doctorate and he said look he's a preacher he says the best preacher in the family is my daughter now church can everybody see that billy graham never can take you to the promised land because all those all those things they do go against the word of god right and you wouldn't get to them joshua only got to the promised land for the amen by obeying every word amen hallelujah we only get to the promised land by obeying all the word of god amen there it is how did he that's what i forgot last week church so just bear with me here as we get started here was that helpful okay i hope it was helpful by god's grace i only had to scroll down to slide 196. okay i had to scroll down 196 slides to get to that thought so i'm sorry i forgot that last week i don't want to fail you you know i i don't like forgetting things just a small thing now let's review quickly uh last week uh last sunday i preached on uh i think i preached on all four of these yeah i preached on all four of those last sunday the wednesday before i preached on reuben so if you haven't listened those i think it'd be a blessing to you but let's just review this real quick uh reuben was the oldest but he was disgraced and really had no blessings promised to him through his his father and then moses to the tribe that later you know his descendants okay let's read this i want you to read this because i was just blessed so if you forgot your bible go to first chronicles 5. the bible literally says that god took away his place as the firstborn because of his sin was sleeping with his dad's servant you see church there's something's going to happen the bible says remember the bible says when a man sleeps with a harlot or something they're one flesh there's something that happens when someone actually goes through that act and it's going to last right uh brother madam say you'll never get away from the the consequences of that you can be forgiven of that but you'll never get away from the consequences of that praise god and so this case reuben did an awful thing it's almost like incest some of the writers say uh and he just because of that you know he was forgiven later we know he has a throne he was forgiven of that uh like david was forgiven of adultery and murder right god can still give you rewards right you can still be forgiven but there's going to be effects on that for all the days of your life but aren't you glad those who obey there's going to be blessings that remain on you all the days of your life too praise god for those who remain faithful those who keep the word of god god's blessings are going to overtake you amen that's what that's what moses said they're going to run after you and chase you down amen i'm ready for some more chasing downs somebody lord i know he's going to chase me down and bless me amen because we've tried to line up our lives with the word of god amen first chronicles five one and two now the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his birthright was given unto the sons of joseph now look at that even uh esau right esau gave up his birthright and that was voluntarily well here he the this reuben gives it up through sexual sin so see how church we can lose rewards that's how people can they can have a promise they can have blessings of god but if they for if they live despite the word of god god will take things away right his birthright was given to the sons of joseph the son of israel and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright look at that god takes it away look at verse 2 for judah prevailed above his brethren amen god was looking at their lives and said i can see that judah is going to overcome the sexual temptation can i say like that judah is going to overcome the violent spirit that simeon and levi had amen judah was going to prevail he was going to overcome because like joshua said choose you this day it's all up to your choice do whatever you want but god will honor those who submit to the holy spirit ah there it is prevail god's not forcing us to do anything god wants to see what you're gonna do with your free more agency rich and deep amen judah prevailed above his brother and of him became the chief ruler but the birthright was joseph's so joseph got the birthright but then judah prevails above them and judah gets the scepter the bible says to rule over them right so now can anybody see that okay reuben was a awful sin but god for game at the end of his life but his god foresaw that his tribe was not going to do very much after that remember no king no prophet ever came out of reuben all right they all had the opportunity to do it but uh no they never came out of it because of their choices they made all right now last sunday we looked at simeon and levi these two were the ones that slayed those men of sheikham right when they were circumcised and they were healing up they did awful and jacob was so mad at them but simeon was disgraced into significance we never find him doing anything either but levi was redeemed and exalted to the priesthood levi took the warning and then his descendants like aaron and moses and phineas they moses said who's on the lord's side and all the sons of levi came and stood with them just according to the prophecy because moses said moses said you'll give me the lawgiver of your people and you will hold the yerman thummim praise god amen and that this gives us the the grace we can have two brothers right that are that together they're not very good but if you get them apart they'll serve god amen then you can have brothers that serve god like james and andrew right and james and john i know you're peter and andrew rather you can have brothers that work together like johnny and his brother amen like myself and my brothers amen right god can put us together and we can do something for the glory of god amen hallelujah but these two needed separated so god did it now we also saw judah he was exalted to the lead with the scepter through david and ultimately he was given david and all the good kings and messiah jesus christ came through the line of the tribe of jude and the church said amen the lion of the tribe of who judah because judah was one who prevailed wasn't it jesus that said i prevailed for you amen i've gone to the cross i prevailed the guard in gethsemane i did that for you amen and because i lived you can prevail also oh hallelujah thank god amen beautiful now we looked at dan on sunday night and the holy spirit prophesied that he would rule this people and that was only the time of samson which was 20 years imagine that the holy spirit looked at dan's he looked at dan's genealogy and he said well for 20 years he's going to rule so i'm going to just point that out to the people but then remember in the days of jeroboam dan let jeroboam set up a calf in israel on their land and the bible said after that that god took their name off the book right dan and ephraim he said they're they're giving unto idols leave them alone and then god blocks their names out from under heaven right that was a thousand years before christ okay so and then there's not much said about dan after that he had a lot of good land we looked at that you have nice land and everything uh not much said now here actually let me pull this up here let me see if i can uh i'm on slide what 11. i want to this is another thing i couldn't remember last week too so i'm kind of making up for last or lost ground from last week okay remember i was trying to think of all the kings of judah who were all the good kings of judah whether they're the ones that are shaded in here asa remember the northern kings had no good kings no good kings ever came out of that lineage jeroboams right because you got ahab they got ahab now they say jehu was kind of good kind of bad and he was it was a mixture i guess but not overall a good king but here the bible said asa was a good king jehoshaphat uh and then some kind of in between i think uzi was really good he just got off right at the end of his life just remember that he got leprosy he just got off right at the very end he stopped seeking god but he had a tremendous testimony if you read the scripture he was such a warrior so faithful to god that was such a sad thing uh but hezekiah and josiah were these wonderful kings that god raised up yeah jehoshaphat ii there so at least judah had some good kings praise god just like god said i'm gonna give you the scepter and there was godly kingdom now look at that church we're gonna get to this later but each generation had a chance to obey god each glory each generation had a chance at revival amen and we've got the chance right now amen we've got a chance to be revived in the holy spirit praise god i'm talking about not just the soul i'm talking about your mind too i i thank god that we never lukewarm in our souls but sometimes we get lukewarm in our minds amen that's where we need the victory praise god right if you're born again hallelujah but don't give up your mind we'll look at the mind tonight for the kids bible study we're gonna do a bible study on the five inlets to the human spirit so i was studying on that this morning so lord willing if the children want to we can if we can do one or i can just preach it whatever the children want but my guess is they might want to do bible study but i could be wrong so look that's what the bible says judah would have good kings that came out of out of him and that's exactly what happened praise god not everyone in fact only a minority now plus you had you know david and solomon was partly good david was mostly good but then solomon you know started off good but then kind of fell off at the end so partly good partly bad all right now back up here that wasn't too bad now just to review church here's how they were camped i love this picture man this is this just makes me want to shout i'm going to do right now hallelujah praise god this is what the holy spirit show balaam remember balak said come curse me he said nah he said come come up okay so he finally went remember the donkey tried to stop him he he went past that and balak said come look at them he said come look at them and curse them and the bible says the holy spirit came upon balaam and he said how goodly are your tents o jacob praise god for there shall rise a star out of jacob amen this is what he saw he saw the cross amen hallelujah he saw the pillar of fire right in the midst of the camp and that's what we got today healing our sick for the jose we got the pillar of fire in the camp today amen it's at the very heart of our worship what does all of our worship go back to the holy spirit the word of god the leadership of the holy ghost it's right in the midst of us today hallelujah you got zebulun issachar judah here on the east side you've got benjamin manasseh ephraim on the west you got gad simeon ruben on the south got dan asher naphtali on the north and don't don't forget church each of them had a banner that they flew they all had their uh they all had their chair of them guarding them amen hallelujah they had the they had the lion the ox the man and the ego praise god why they were all guarding the presence of god matthew mark luke and john all guarding the book of acts amen hallelujah the acts of the holy ghost in the apostles in other words the acts of the holy ghost in you and i hallelujah thank god amen hallelujah that's where we stand today with the anointing of the holy ghost here today to bless us to help us instruct us god say like this to keep us in order and he's going to make sure we fulfill all the positions that god has called us to do thank god amen now let's look at god for a few minutes i'm really going to try to watch my time now i say that but i'm really going to try today all right i've probably been preaching what maybe 15 minutes so we'll see how this goes god now again let's get your bible let's go to the scripture here now genesis 30 let's look at his life i'm sorry his birth rather yeah the beginning of his life now remember this is what we're trying to show we're trying to show how we have to rightly divide brother ram's message right a lot of people will get quiet on that which is i understand that we want to be respectful to brother branham but brother adam said prove me by the word right he said try all things he said take everything back to the bible so there's quotes for brother man says every hebrew mother prophesied and foretold where the boys would end up in the promised land well we can't find that in the bible it may have happened but we can't find the bible but we do find the mothers giving them names based upon the trials they were going through it wasn't about it was actually their their father jacob and then the prophet moses that actually placed them in the promised land in certain cases not every case okay so we don't want any william random worshipers here we only want jesus christ worshipers here praise god and i say that with all due respect like i had a guy was i was texting with yesterday he watched my joseph video didn't like it very much i said well that's fine he said he went to joseph years ago when he had the hair down to his his shoulder and his son had cancer and he said that he just fellowship with him for two hours they didn't even pray for the boy and he went back to uh the doctor with the boy and the boy was healed he said he must be a prophet i said that's i said that's fine i'm i said i'm glad he was healed but he didn't even pray for him he didn't anoint him with oil or nothing and he didn't even his hair should have been that long either and i said and so the man said that's why i call joseph our christ he calls him christ joseph that's that's almost blasphemy if not it is they said they say uh joseph our christ they call him that's what this guy calls him it's so so sad i said your reasoning is about as uh uh about as weak as anything i've ever heard because my mom was here to cancer and the woman i just called her angie i don't remember her name but the woman angie came with thus said the lord to my mom and she was healed of cancer well i said should my mom call angie christ angie no of course not if jesus said call no man father how much more should we call no man christ i said all when there's a miracle all that proves is the holy ghost honor of that one prayer that doesn't prove that person's life is sealed in the baptism of the holy ghost right and i said here's 11 more false doctrines that church is producing prove one of them wrong and he proved zero wrong because he wrote right back he said oh you just don't understand i said no i understand exactly what there's a whole video about it i understand i understand see how that spirit gets in there and it exalts men ah but there's there's people that are earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the saints amen thank you brother bran the same honor that was given to john the baptist amen and john the baptist given that honor he pointed them to christ and he said look away from me look to jesus the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world amen so any honor we good we would give to brother abraham or john the baptist they would always say go follow him he's the one that baptizes you with the holy ghost hallelujah oh my goodness these people church aren't you glad to have a sound mind today aren't you glad you woke up today with a sound mind that you don't wake up with a uh i doubt your spirit like that on you see sometimes we forget to count our benefits i've got healthy body i got food on the table i'm not insane i don't have a reprobate mind that's what these guys have and they won't receive correction you can't correct them on anything because they know everything about it right there's no humility they can't humble themselves to the word of god oh but god has given us a spirit of of love power and a soulmate that's a gift of grace hallelujah that's grace to us amen and we can recognize that we're wrong and the holy spirit can guide us into all truth i feel good this morning praise god amen all right now genesis 30 verse 9 through 11. verse nine when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife and zilpah leah's made bear jacob a son and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad gad now it seems from the text that she says she means a troop of boys but this one this one is actually prophetic this one was really prophetic because that's what this is later what moses says moses later brings us out how he's going to be a troop in other words they're going to be warriors they're going to be military men the mob just meant it for well now i got a troop of boys but god by the holy spirit inspired her to say that amen now no she didn't place him in the land she just placed what they would be warriors there'd be an army that's what we are church we're the army of the lord today amen you're true praise god we're troops in here today we're getting spiritually fed amen what do they call that in the military when you get fed what's they call the reverie what do they call it mess yeah this mess hall praise god this is the message hall can i say like that praise god amen we're getting the message fed to us amen the word of god for our day hallelujah now that's it for the prophecy right gad right now asher's next his name is means happy that's a great name okay go to uh genesis 49 19 please genesis 49 19. yeah here's dad prophesying over gad jacob's dying and he goes through all the boys here and he prophesies about god look what he said just one sentence about him imagine that your dad what would your dad what would the holy spirit prophesy over you if they had one sentence what is your life going to be most identified by oh my may god granted that be something great to glorify christ a life of obedience praise god a life of of magnifying jesus a life of obedience a life of a power in the holy spirit amen verse 19. one sentence this man utters by the holy spirit verse 19 dad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last wow he picks up the same inspiration as right as earlier right picks up the same inspiration from mama you're going to get defeated early but don't quit don't quit early because you're going to win at the end amen you might get defeated early on but just don't give up church amen just don't quit on god hallelujah just keep fighting and you know your troop you know your army you might be defeated you might have had some law of losses you might have suffered a little bit but stay in the fight victory's assured hallelujah amen god is going to help this truth amen god is going to help this army god is going to protect his bride amen hallelujah it ain't over until god says it's over can i say like that praise god this fight is not over until god says it's over as long as i'm here it's not over as long as you're here it's not over keep fighting you're our troop you're an army god is with you his angels are with you amen hallelujah an angel army goes before you hallelujah maybe some of those losses are just to humble us maybe god knows you just need a little suffering to produce obedience right because all messenger believers don't obey the word of god right and we when we're and we're going to fall ashore but how many want to overcome and they want to obey in the end i do right we're all going to fall short we're going to make mistakes but in the end i want to overcome by the grace of god amen i don't want to fail to the devil i don't want to be beaten i want to stand upon the heads of my enemies like the bible said we want to put satan under our feet shortly thank god amen now brother adam said his name meant cattle raiser now you can you can believe that if you want but i just can't point you to any bible verse for that so that one's going to be on the shelf until eternity okay until we get the answer because maybe they did utter that but we just weren't there okay i think here's where it says it here let me yeah so brother i have said uh as it was with moses great message obviously preach on that for a long time but man says see now look he's guessing right he's just doing his best to remember i don't have it all wrote down here but let's say let's say reuben meant sheepherder and gad means cattle razor and ephra meant cornraiser okay so he's just doing his best to kind of you know just to kind of understand how they were they were placed by their names they replaced by prophecy is what he was trying to get to right that's the beautiful thought we can see in it praise god now there's god just i mean we'll get to this in a moment but there's again notice here's the jordan river right did they did they get into the promised land no they chose to live outside the promised land which types the foolish virgin right yet but they fought and they helped their brethren right and brother bam said that foolish virgin should be a help to the bride praise god that's just these are beautiful types we see in here we need to understand them right so we already preached on reuben he remained there gad here was north of ruben and then on this side west manasseh and then east minnesota so he's all surrounded by manasseh except on the south they had ruben there so just interesting to see there now yeah we preached on naftali like i said that was prophetic wednesday that was prophetic of jesus and his apostles almost every apostle came out of naftali and that's what the bible said they would have goodly words come out of the tribe of naphtali just i mean just amazing i never i never saw that okay deuteronomy 33 we read this yeah let's go back there deuteronomy 33 we'll get back to this by the grace of god 33 verse 20 and of god he said blessed be he that enlargeth god he dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head teareth the arm with the crown of his head verse 21 he provided the first part for himself because there in a portion of the giver was he seated and he came with the heads of the people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgments with israel praise god now let me just do something real quick i need to look for a date here real quick in the bible shall we take me a few seconds i'm going to first king 17 and you'll see why i'm going there just a minute okay so this is uh 600 years there about 550 years later okay all right now the results we'll get to now but notice it mentions god was seated in a portion of the lawgiver this means he was given his placing by moses because moses was the lawgiver right remember moses remember moses was the one who promised the two and a half tribes the land remember moses did that and josh would just follow through and make sure we keep what moses said right that's what we're here we're just keeping what brother man told us to do praise god stay with the word hallelujah praise god we're doing what the prophet said amen now there's a quote brother brandon he said a man cattle razor i can't find that i think the bible says it says troop right so that's okay that's brother i'm doing his best he's human now easton's bible dictionary says the portion allowed to the tribe of god was on the east of jordan and comprehended the half of gilead a region of great beauty and fertility bounded on the east by the arabian desert and on the west by the jordan and on the north by the river jabuk it thus included the whole of the jordan valley as far north as to the sea of galilee where it narrowed almost to a point the tribe was fierce and warlike they were strong men of might men of war for the battle that could handle shield and buckler their faces the faces of lions now isn't that interesting and like rose upon the mountains for swiftness so these guys were expert warriors you wouldn't want to come across them in a fight right because they're fast as a deer how many seen a deer lately run out in front of you right i see him all the time uh or as fierce as the face of a lion that's what kind of family this was going to be you ever seen a family of a lion uh around the message some of them fierce yeah you do see it that's what the bible says there's all these different varieties now look at this the bible said berzele and elijah was of this tribe elijah was of gad huh we'll get to that a little bit it was carried into captivity at the same time as the other tribes of northern kingdom by tigleth plesser and the time of jeremiah their cities were inhabited by the ammonites so now i'm going to matthew henry a preacher in the 1900 1800s and here's what he says on jacob's prophecy he alludes to his name signifying a troop it foresees the character of the tribe it should be warlike and so we find that the gadites were men of war fit for the battle he foresaw the situation that the tribe on the other side of jordan would expose it to in the incus incursions of the neighbors the moabites and the ammonites in other words uh gad would battle the ammonites and the moabites right that's where their main arch enemies would be and that they might not be proud of their strength and valor he foretells the troops of their enemies should in many skirmishes overcome them aren't you glad god is so gracious god is so gracious he says you're going to be strong and mighty but you're going to lose a lot at the beginning but just hold on to the end see i like that don't you believe that god will foretell us if we're going to have a loss in the future don't you believe god always warns men and women do you believe that i believe that i think the holy spirit warns them all throughout the day right he warns us and we should pay attention to the warnings right jesus even warned judas right he said one of you is going to betray me in here right he warned him in advance right because he knew what's going to happen he said woe to that man who betrays me it'd be better if he never would have been born he got warned right and if if we're just kind of saying like this if we're just quiet enough we'll sense the warning of the holy spirit so they're warned they're told you're going to be great mighty you're going to lose some but hang on to the end if you don't quit you will overcome at the end praise god glory so see god allows us to lose to humble us right yet that they might not be discouraged by their defeats he assures him that they would overcome at the last which was fulfilled in saul's time and david's the moabites and ammonites were wholly subdued so let's read that let's go to first chronicles 5. we were there earlier but let's read it first chronicles 5. this reminds me of the third tier in church age where jesus said he said i see your works your labor your love he said and your works your last to be more than the first see god wants us not to be discouraged in our service but actually increase our service thank god hallelujah first chronicles five why do i do that why do i pound that because i know people who've decreased their service to god they get cold on god they give up on god but god says keep going keep it at full steam go full blast to the end praise god amen and i'll see that your last works were more than your first amen amen other than brother ram said like this he said he said people are telling me i should i should make less tapes because i i need to repent of my lord jesus christ baptism but man said no he said i'm not doing that we're making more tapes is what he said praise god the devil's trying to say slow down slow down don't put out so much word and revelation but the holy spirit said no we're doing more of it amen we're going to get more truth out and god's people are going to receive the word of god so prophetically this is about 400 years later was when moses's promise promises and prophecies were fulfilled in verses 18 to 22. the sons of reuben and the ghadites and the half tribe of manasseh of valiant men men able to bear buckler a shield and sword and to shoot with the bow and skillful in war were four and forty thousand and seven hundred and three score man i have to break that down a little bit i couldn't get the exact number on that that went out to war and they made war with the hagarites with jeter and and nefesh and no dab and they were helped against them and the hagrites were delivered in their hand and all that were with him with them rather for they cry now look at this church how do you get the victory church what do you do you cry into the lord i think jose's the sister that mary i think she was here did you say she prayed part of the night or something like that yeah so the woman with that blood the blood in her eye she stayed up extra night extra long to cry out to god and when she woke up she was healed oh that's a good example praise god that's what jehoshaphat did when he was camped out remember he said let's get the prophet the prophet came and said this art this battle i'm fighting for you
