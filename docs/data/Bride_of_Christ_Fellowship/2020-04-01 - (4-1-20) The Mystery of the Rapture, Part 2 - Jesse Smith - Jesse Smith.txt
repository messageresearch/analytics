our joy through the ages to see [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what beautiful words i standed think our god was here today let's go to the first thessalonians chapter 5 Lord willing tonight I'd like to teach on the mystery of the rapture part 2 maybe you remember part one who's back in February I think February 21st or 22nd I was having some good conversation with brother cam and brother Simon this week and had some other thoughts about the rapture we like to look at this mystery and of course I'm preaching from my notes from the forthcoming book whenever it finishes the Lord willing first thessalonians chapter 5 verse longer worried verses 1 and 2 and then we want to read our memory verse from Romans 12 oh it's a / ok so praise God to reach out to sister Naomi if you're on there if you're listening live stream after we reach out to you for a memory verse Lord willing by God's grace amen so let's read 1st Thessalonians 5 1 & 2 together then we'll read our memory verse from sister Wendy Romans 12:1 and 2 so let's begin on three one two three but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night praise God no that'll be our scripture for tonight but let's read I remember there's Romans 12 Romans 12:1 and 2 Romans 12:1 and 2 to 3 that together on three one two three I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God let's have a word of Prayer before we see it heavily father we've read your word we sang your songs I feel your presence or just anoint me to preach your word may that people receive it and bless us in your divine presence we love you Lord prepares for that coming of the eye rapture in Jesus Christ name the church said amen god bless you beans in the breeze go where do you why you're going to give me a tissue from my office I was in tissue so I like to just review just for five minutes real quick part one and I think you'll be rather familiar with it oh yeah but before we do the review I want to just give the update on the coronavirus you probably saw you've been paying a lot of attention to it really spreading in certain cities you know like New Orleans and Detroit as well as New York but I saw one article today that said in New York it's starting to kind of flatline a little bit so we're just continuing watching and praying for people the president yesterday said that in two weeks we'll probably see the biggest spike thank you and that may be because of the he said the the tests will be more available in about two weeks so just want to keep praying for people and we want to keep the same perspective I believe Church this is one of the Sorrows is probably one of them ending Sorrows because Jesus told us the beginning of Sorrows was 2000 years ago rather the beginning of Sorrows was during the time of the black horse rider under the third seal and that carries over now into the fourth seal cuz it's such a short seal and so the coronavirus is one of the continual Sorrows that this world has to endure because of Satan's wickedness but just to keep just keep it in perspective Church four thousand seven hundred fifty nine have lost their lives in America now keep in mind the president's the president and his department said this they are they're gonna they're gonna increase drug trafficking by the border and also in the in the waters the southern southern waters and their experts said seventy thousand people died a year from overdosing on drugs seventy thousand so just keep that in mind and remember over six hundred thousand died from abortions that's just the procedure there's millions more that died from the abortion pill just taking the pill so we are powerful about the krona buyers but we're also sorrowful about drug addiction and abortion whether it's through procedure or the the pill God may just God have mercy so churches continue to pray keep praying for the leaders of our government for the Supreme Court keep praying for sinners to be saved and of course use wisdom as we talked about always use wisdom so I just want to give update on that now let's review the last time we preach on the mystery of the rapture do you guys have battles greed will probably after we get done with the reviewers just take a few moments we'll have like a Bible study we'll go through some scriptures here we showed how the rapture is it's going to be the last mystery that is actually fulfilled in real time because it's the last event of the Gentile dispensation once Jesus has snatched away his Gentile bride he cuts off the Gentiles and he returns he grafts back in the Jews that's why it's my last chapter in the book it's defined as the literal day and hour of Jesus Christ returned to the air to resurrect the dead in Christ and then also to translate those that are alive and well that our Holy Ghost filled Christians he takes them then after the marriage in the sky takes them to the the wedding reception the marriage supper of the lamb and has the judgment seat of Christ where rewards are given out and have communion with his his people praise God Paul literally caused this rapture a mystery in first Corinthians 15 that was our text last time and God promised the mysteries would be finished in Revelation 10 7 then taken around the world verses 8 through 11 and then acts 3:21 Jesus will sit on the throne until the restitution or restoration of all things which must include doctrine must include teaching and power of the Holy Ghost which were a part of that by the grace of them Lord the word rapture is not in the New Testament I'm sorry it's not in the King James but we know the definition is so we still use it just as a word that helps us to understand all of our Christian friends and then we ended last time we enter the last service about the rapture with the six reasons the rapture is pre-tribulation I went really fast through those but again there's a youtube video on that I think our church understands that but I just wanted to lay down the general purposes as reminders in case anybody asks you about it I've had denominational friends even from Canada contact me about that video it was a great help to them and then they preached what I taught on the video and they gave me a shout-out in the video so I don't know if I still have that sermon saved it was a couple years ago but a Baptist brother he disagreed about brother Branham but he believed brother I'm talking about the pre-tribulation rapture so that was encouraging and then we closed by looking at the steps for the body change but the hos they asked me to preach that again so we looked at the steps and how the dead in Christ rise and so that would be the the dead in Christ come down within their theophanies to come down get their their glorified body their glorified corporal body and those three bodies unite and then Lord willing we would see them soon after that our rapture would take place our physical bodies would be swallowed up in a glorified body and then that glorified body would go to the air to meet Christ where we would combine with our theophany body or celestial body so that was the order of the body change by God's grace so now that's a quick review so let's look at tonight's thoughts by the grace of the Lord I just want to prove to you that anyone who teaches the rapture already happened is teaching false doctrine and a lot of people around the message do a lot of people say the rapture happened in 63 when the cloud came down and they take some quotes that brother Bram said you know Christ looking down upon his bride and they say Christ is here the rapture Artie took place now that's wrong that's a false doctrine anyone who holds that doctrine and believes it will ultimately go into some form of sin whether it's pride lust of the eyes or pride of life or I'm sorry lust of the flesh one of those and often we see it is the pride of life where believers around the message will think they're more holy or better than other people rather than remaining humble and being meek and being sweet they become hardened and prideful and they they fail to move on with God and so we want to avoid that but let's go to 2nd Timothy 2 17 and 18 2nd Timothy 2 17 and 18 so why don't my oldest Lydia won't you read that for me concerning the truth of Aaron saying that the resurrection is passed on ready and and overthrow the faith of son now look at this church I'm a Gnaeus and philetus were teaching that the rapture already happened and it caused a lot of people to lose their faith so see when when people say the Raps already happened it makes them lose their watching and praying attitude it makes them lose that desire to meet Christ in the air and so they lose they fall away from their faith they fall away from believing and then the Bible said a false doctrine like this is like a flesh-eating disease like gangrene like a canker so see false doctor will eat someone alive from the inside out causing many to lose their faith that's why we have burning hearts for people around the message that teach false doctrine and you see it in their lives that false doctrine spiritual you and I we're either growing in grace or growing this way with a false doctrine and it eats away our love for the Lord because we have to keep our first love if we don't keep our first love with the truth of the word of God that evil spirit will eat away our love for God our zeal our fruit of the Spirit and we become something that we shouldn't be we become a lukewarm Christian and we don't want to become that we want to be a non-fire Holy Ghost filled Christian growing in grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ so I want to start by showing that a false teaching about the rapture saying I already took place it will lead to a addiction for a sin for a sin loving life whether it's loving pride exalting oneself or lust of the flesh or lust of the eyes okay so I want to make sure I say that and of course brother Ram didn't believe that why would he preach the rapture in December of 65 a few weeks before he died about the rapture and to get the people ready for the rapture why would he preach that if he believed the rapture already took place of course it didn't of course it didn't and of course in his book he talks about that in the church age book written right before he died about being ready for the rapture the rapture is in the future it hasn't happened yet but RAM said all the gifts remain in the church preachers will preach until the Lord returns but we still have gifts operating right people being healed people being saved discernments right with their sermons and our church words of the Lord all these things they they continue until the Lord returns alright now that's the first point I want to make and now I want to kind of move over to my notes again and preach from these thoughts that we've uh that the Lord has given me as I've meditated and and parade and written for the glory of God I guess I kind of feel like this in my own little primitive way the Holy Spirit said pick up your pen and write in a very humble simple way and that's what people have told me Church so I got some and you know it I got two testimonies back where people said when I read your book it was like the Lord Jesus was talking to me directly himself no that's not me that's people telling me that people saying that Christ wrote that book so I trust by the grace of the Lord that it was much of it was inspired and it helps people but in my own humble way I feel like that's what the Lord has called me to do and of course the evidence is on writing the YouTube scripts for the videos and then preaching those first preaching those to you where you receive it we receive it we rejoice in it sets us free keeps us free keeps just growing and Grace and knowledge of the Lord but RAM said the teaching the deep teaching of the word makes you more established in the faith we're not tossed by every wind of false doctrine and the Holy Spirit keeps our church clean praise God drives out the evil spirits so that we can rejoice and have peace and serve God with peace and love in our hearts praise the Lord now so the next part after in the in the chapter after the six reasons of the raptures pre-tribulation I felt led to go into the times and seasons of the rapture now Paul Paul clearly says you and I will know the times and seasons of the rapture jesus said we won't know the day or hour okay so that means but that could mean though we might know the week we might know it's the week we might know it's the month we might know it's the year right but we'll definitely know the season remember the Lord told Sarah glory the Lord said I'll visit you this time next year according to the time of life so she knew the time and season of this coming of a son praise God hallelujah there it is a minute I didn't have that a moment my notes I need to get that in there praise the Lord it's the time it's the season we'll see the son getting ready to be produced praise God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus let's see Paul is very bold right after saying you're gonna be caught up the moment wink of an eye a shot voice Trump he says brethren you know the times and seasons Christ is gonna come snatches his wife away okay now let's go back to 1st Thessalonians 5 I'm gonna read verses we start at verse 3 for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child so that's what we're talking about with the coronavirus it's like birth pains right these sorrows and they're just gonna increase right that's just what this that's just what that's what the Bible says as a woman approaches the time to deliver a child the the pains increase and so that's what Paul says and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief so Paul gives this beautiful illustration calling unbelievers in darkness but calling believers as light we still got some light outside I'm not afraid to go out there right but one or two in the morning I might be little nervous to go outside without a light okay that's how that's how the rapture is we will see it plainly it just as I can see the I can see the house I can see the cars just as I can see that so plainly we'll see the rapture so plainly it'll be so plain and clear it won't overtake us as a nighttime surprise he said ye are the children of light and sugar in the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do let us watch it me sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken or drunk of the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him hallelujah many beautiful promises in this a portion but I I just bring out two points in this next chapter sinners are unaware of the rapture just like a drunken sleeping robbery victim is caught off guard by a nighttime thief Jesus teaches the same idea about the days of Noah because they were lost and they were eating drinking marrying right up until the flood came and took them away no idea Paul says they're like sin if the sinners are like sleeping drums so that's the first thing for the time and season sinners I just have no no clue just like the days of Noah and they'll be saying this they'll be sleeping and busy marrying giving in marriage and eating and drinking and getting drunk all that nonsense and then Paul says they're gonna be saying peace safety peace safety in other words they're not going to be ready they're not gonna be aware that judgments coming they're gonna say oh it's all gonna be peaceful it's alright we're just we won't need to be safe I got the whole time God is pressing to his little bride I'm gonna rapture you from the destruction I'm gonna take you from the destruction so the the bride is here and get ready get ready the bridegroom is coming out go you have to meet him destructions coming that's that's what the bride is hearing but the world's just ignored a saying all we're gonna be happy we're gonna have peace we're gonna be safe it shows that they're totally contrary to what the Holy Spirit is telling the bride today the Holy Spirit is saying watch pray trim your lamps make sure you have oil go out to meet the bridegroom because destruction is coming you don't want to be left out and they're saying oh we're gonna live here our whole lives and peace and safety all nice things now you can see ditions match the days of Noah as we just said there's other descriptions as well in the days of Noah scoffers Peter said they'll be scoffers mocking the second coming of Jesus Christ so we seen people do that all the time the conditions of Noah violence attractive women and sons of God falling for attractive women who are Christians because it's all right to be a pretty woman it's okay to be pretty as long as you dress modestly but it's wrong for a child of God a man to go after a woman just because she's good-looking and she's not a real Christian doesn't have a real heart to serve the Lord and they'll have continual evil thoughts all they want to think about is evil evil evil lovers pleasures lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God also they think about as pleasures what they can do to have more pleasure another condition Jesus said it will be like a sodomite condition as the days of lot we see that increasing all the time more sodomy and more LGBT rights for them next many churches will come in a great falling away 2nd Thessalonians 2 3 next men will love themselves more than lovers of God to be covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers breakers rather false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of them that are good traitors heady highminded having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof of the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit 2nd Timothy 3:1 2:7 also the other condition the gospel must be preached to all in the world Jesus said in Matthew 24:14 and Israel will be getting ready to return to God and she'll be seeking to control the Temple Mount in order to rebuild the temple according to revelation 11 1 and 2 so Paul says our only hope is to be spiritually awake and sober watching for Christ returned by having on the armor of God praise the Lord now in our fusion series were at the armor of God so I'm gonna skip that today we'll preach on at the Lord winning maybe Sunday but he mentions two pieces a breastplate of faith and love and righteousness remember a breastplate protects your heart right so Satan's trying to attack your heart but your heart is defended by the righteousness of Jesus Christ amen not our righteousness but Christ's righteousness amen and then also the hope the helmet of salvation the hope of salvation Church we should be constantly being thankful and hoping and trusting God is going to deliver us from the tribulation we got to keep that armor on his love will defend us his love will defend our hope and we'll be able to say I love Jesus He loves me he's going to bring me salvation praise God he's already given in my soul and he's gonna good physically as well he's gonna deliver me from the tribulation period praise God now I want to make a good point here mark I've even go to Matthew 11:12 Matthew 11:12 but as he's going there it's so fitting that Paul says we must be alert soldiers so Paul says if you want to escape the tribulation you've got to be a soldier you got to have on the armor of God now what's what's wonderful is that soldiers use force right soldiers enforce the law right they carry out commands and they don't have to ask you if they've got permission right they're just soldiers are gonna do what they're commanded to do and so Paul uses a great illustration as a soldier who uses force were to use force in order to overcome this world so in other words if you want to be ready for the rapture you must be willing to fight for this privilege because God's most successful soldier Jesus Christ his son says the kingdom of God is experienced when the spiritual soldiers take it by force for his gods Malachi read matthew 11:12 praise God so Jesus says the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost the violent take it by force now the words take it by force in the Greek are the same words that Paul use for caught up will be caught up in a moment of trinken and I so Jesus used that same word harp harp Azzo I believe it is are pazzo to snatch away so jesus said the violent snatch away the kingdom of God praise the Lord other words the Lord has laid out promises and if if God has revealed it to us we can take that promise but we've got to grab it with our strong hand of faith praise God we've got to come against the devil and fight against him use our armor knock off all the darts and we've got to take that the promise of God and snatch it away praise God that's what Jesus says take the kingdom of God by force hallelujah as spiritual soldiers in other words if you want a better prayer life you go take it praise God if you want to know the Word of God brother Branham says two things if you want to get closer to God read your Bible and pray if you want to be closer to God you go take that Bible reading make time go take the Bible reading spend more time in the word praise God and I would encourage you this I've been meaning to say this for weeks and months if you're having trouble just start a journal or start writing your own books or like I do I found that to be such a way to meditate upon the scripture just write out like think you're gonna write out your own commentary on the Bible just meditate on it just stay in that word just fill journals and as you write just just right as you read rather the Bible right about it keep your mind stayed upon it you'll be surprised how you just meditate all throughout the day all throughout the days I'm talking and quotes will just come to me that I just add I email to myself to put in the book it's just it just comes to me because as you as you meditate and talk about Jesus his presence comes around praise God amen so if you want if you want more love go take it by force go go to your prayer closet as soon as the service is over praise God take it by force don't sit back and let the devil keep you from it take it by force like the rapture Jesus gonna take his bride by force amen the same Greek word snatch you away the the violent take it by force they take the kingdom of God and you know I want to say this to a lot of preachers are are preaching many good things you know in the midst of this coronavirus but then then people will try to get people to you know a lot of them are like kind of making them scared to get closer to God like using fear you better go and closer to God the church we should if you're a Holy Ghost field st. you should be so in love with God all the time that your walk with God no one has to use fear to get you to walk closer to God you should be in the prayer closet every day you should be reading your Bible every day but I've seen this over the last 20 years of being around the message I'm almost I think it's nineteen years you know first it was worm lord around 2005 people are using worm Lord to try to scare people a meteor named worm was gonna come and hit the earth and people around people in this message told me the earth is gonna end soon and then it's all these other things and now that was 2012 the Mayan calendar right and then it was a knots coronavirus people using all these fear tactics saying you better get close to God we should be constantly close to God praise God you shouldn't have to adjust your life because you should be born again praise God you should be filled with the Holy Spirit seeking God in your prayer closet reading your Bible praying falling more in love with Jesus meditating upon the promises of but see Church it just shows a lot of people aren't born again because they need something outside they need the enemy to make them get closer to God but we should have God in us making us fall in love more with God amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen Christ should be in our hearts by the Holy Spirit poured out upon our hearts and Christ the Holy Spirit should be making us fall more in love with him draw more closer to him that's one thing I want to preach I want to make sure you see that we don't that's why none of these things move me the corona virus and the wormwood didn't move me remember the the blood moons a few years ago that stressed me out for a few months but then the Lord gave me peace through brother Craig you know that's another thing people just they're using that to get the body to get you to buy the books or to get you to use fear to try to trust in them if you got the Holy Ghost jesus said the Holy Ghost guide you into all truth praise God and then a Holy Spirit in you it longs for fellowship right along forth your soul and so you meditate upon the things of God remember the Bible said commune with your own soul praise the Lord amen oh yeah oh I think that's good I hope everybody's watching tonight praise God by God's grace I this today I just all felt like preaching real good I felt the presence of the Lord amen hallelujah so see it's violent soldiers that rapture way or snatch away the kingdom of God hallelujah the church I still get emails all this week from Congo I got an email from Congo I told you Romania last week other brothers Africa brothers that the Word of God that's being preached and spread is blessing people helping people strengthening them see it's because it's the word the word the Spirit when we hear the word the Spirit will quicken that word to us it will guide us into all truth praise God and it's it's it's it's it's going out it will not return void praise God when the Word of God is spread it will find where it needs to go praise God such an encouragement see Christians are gonna snatch away their victories from Satan just as Jesus example snatch away his bride from the Antichrist Amen hallelujah thank the Lord praise God so any promise that is for everybody any promise that's fair but you got to snatch you away because you know it's it's yours God's revealed it to you that a prayer life and read your Bible is yours it's it's Scripture there's no one that's denied that the Holy Ghost being born again that's for everybody who's so ever will you can take that promise and say I know it's mine and you can take a hold of that but you got to take it by force praise God you got to make the choice hallelujah got to die to self amen and submit your will to God's will praise the Lord see Satan as many traps the Bible said he has traps and snares all around us The Devil's angels have been and always will continually be at war against our cause they war against us the Bible says but we are fully equipped and more than conquerors fighting the good fight of faith with our divine armor amen look at that next time by God's grace we'll see glory praise God amen thank you Jesus we set a timer here so I don't where everybody out now the next I went times and seasoned the book and I go where will the rapture take pray will take place it's a universal event so there's not one physical place now a lot of people think is Jeffersonville right today a lot of people might think it's the biggest message Church in America are the biggest Church in the Congo or the biggest that's the biggest one message Church in the whole world maybe it's the brother in Canada who knew brother Branham people people think it's a physical place but it's not it is a spiritual place praise God jesus said his rapture will be fast as lightning the Bible says in a moment in a twinkling of an eye there's no need to get gather physically for the exact moment of the rapture there'll be no no need to do that because it won't make any difference it'll happen so fast that's why we have to be born again so the spear inside of us helps us to know and understand that times in the season of the rapture just like those Amish women you know we have our Midwife that comes and delivers our babies they work with Amish mothers well the Amish mothers they don't know when their due date is you know whether it's April 5th or whatever they just say well they say it's about summer or those they'll just tell you the season or it's fall or winter see cuz they just work with seasons why because they've got a birth they've got a a seed growing inside of them amen that's just like you and I when we're born again of the seed of God we'll know the season praise the Lord amen oh no it's just about this that season to get ready for the rapture praise God see at the precise moment Jesus said there's going to be some people working in a field or sleeping in a bed Luke 17 34 and 36 there'll be two men in a bed one should be taken the other shall be left these must be brothers right or maybe a father and son or grandpa and son or grandpa and grandson because they couldn't be homosexual that's the thought I'm trying to get there because that's such a rampant thing evil thing in this day it would be two brothers or maybe two believers - single brothers maybe something like that one is take one's left - woman's to be grinding together the one should be taken the other left - will be in the field one taken one left Jesus has a similar thing in Matthew 24 40 and 42 - in the field one taken one left two women grinding at the mill one taken he says watch therefore for you know not what hour your Lord doth come praise God Church he may come while we're sleeping oh my would that be glorious - go to sleep and then to wake up it is present so you praise God thank you Jesus all that be glorious amen oh now here's a good beers of a good point - none of these people are at war right or tribulation I don't know you know praise God they're at work they're sleeping they're grinding at the mill they're just doing the daily tasks right so it's a good scripture to prove that the rapture takes place before the Tribulation Period praise God see we better pray before we go to bed make sure we're born again we better pray before the workday begins right every morning because he's coming back as quick as lightning amen doesn't matter where we physically are long as we got the oil or the wedding garment that's what matters the one spiritual location is to be in Christ if you're in Christ and that location you'll be in the rapture Romans 8:1 there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus believers are in Christ when Christ art is in them praise God let me say it again believers are in Christ when Christ is in them hallelujah that's Colossians 1:27 Christ in you and me the hope of glory praise God Galatians 3:27 Christians have been baptized into Christ because Christ demanded or commanded them to be baptized with the Holy Ghost in acts 1:5 acts 1:5 Linnea can get that acts 1:5 a lot of people don't know this but Jesus Christ is the one who started the Holy Ghost baptism terminology that wasn't a denomination that was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ said you got to be baptized with the Holy Ghost so did John the Baptist he said I'm not worthy even to lose his shoes i baptize you with water but Jesus will baptize you with the Holy Ghost amen praise God Jesus and you'll be baptized you'll be immersed with the Holy Ghost in your soul not many days hence a man what a promise that's where we need to be if we're going to be in the rapture in Christ because Christ is in us Malachi John 14 let's go to John 14 Jesus tell told them over and over he wanted to dwell in them now that would have been such a paradox right if I said the Malachi I want to be in you I'm gonna be in you Lydia I'm gonna be in you can you imagine just somebody saying that like a you know Jesus to the disciples but he says that John's 1417 and then John 14:27 17 and 20 not even know it but he knows every truth with you shall be in you that day he should know Wow Jesus is in the Father read that again and you need and I in you Jesus is in the Father Jesus is in the believer and the believers in Jesus how there you go what does it by it's by the Spirit amen through the spirit praise God God's Spirit dwells in us and right and we're and that portion of God that's in us is actually a part of Jesus's spirit so that's the oneness praise God oh it's beautiful praise the Lord see Jesus was revealing that those believers were already in him those predestinated believers in his mind and his plan before the foundation of the world right Paul says the same thing God has chosen us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be wholly without blame before him in love amen hallelujah praise God for the revelation we're need to be to go in the rapture in Christ amen hallelujah thank the Lord thank you Jesus glory now we do have some clues physically where we might be right we might be at work we might be in the bed but one place we'll be gathering a lot is the local church because the Hebrews 10:25 says Gavin even more as you see that Day approaching and Lydia's gonna read Matthew 24 28 Jesus says there's a gathering place a physical gathering place where we'll be out we'll be there a lot the rapture might happen there or it might happen while we're sleeping or out of the field let's read that Matthew 24 28 jesus says wherever the carcass is the fresh kill the fresh meat of the word that's where the Eagles are gathered amen praise God and you take that with Hebrews 10:25 the word is preached they'll be at church all the time feasting on the Word of God amen now remember it's the fivefold ministry that does that let's read malachi read Exodus 19 poor Exodus 19 4 so you see how God says he's a eagle well if we were if we take Jesus words we just read we were in the Eagle right cuz he said I and you and you and me so here's where God said he's an eagle good nothing amen so jesus said I bore you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself so God takes credit I brought you to myself I carried you on eagle's on my wings and brought you to myself so if he's the Papa or mama Eagle were the eaglets right and we're feasting on the meat of God's Word now what is meat Hebrews 5:14 Lydia Hebrews 5:14 and that's where this this that's where teaching of the word is so important preaching is also equally important but teaching is so important because it will discern lie from air like someone someone was kind of upset one of the videos I made about the seven problems with the Jeffersonville movement they said how does this win anyone to Christ and you know like a critical spear so in love I wrote dear brother there's people that are worshipping brother branham and they might not even know it their idol worshippers and so this this doctrine or this this Bible based deep teaching of the video if they receive it will set them free and then they'll be saved praise God because they will be an idolatry they can't be born again if they're in I doubt her so this video can help release them from my idolatry so at least they can get saved and sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost spray so that's how it's winning souls one doctrine at a time praise God line upon line word upon word precept upon precept here a little very little thank you Jesus amen sorry praise God all right Lydia Hebrews 5:14 my reason is have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so a Christian eating the meat of God's Word has strong ability to recognize sin from holiness they can discern very well little things little areas of sin in their lives and they can judge the sinful things like and then I had another comment where the brother was kind of criticizing me for trying to correct Jeffersonville and I said brother he said we need to stand shoulder to shoulder and you're judging them I said I'm not judging them I said I'd say right in there it's brotherly kindness but what about the scripture prove all things fruit not some things prove all things what about that scripture see and so it discerns it discerns that idolatrous spirit that loves to worship a man but we remember Elijah must decrease and Christ must increase amen there should be an increased emphasis on the word on the Holy Spirit on what God is doing on the truth of God's Word there should be an increase on that and not just leaning upon well brother Branham brother Branham I believe it's true he looked at brother Ram he points us to the word but not every word and a lot of people fall away from that fall away from the truth of going back to the word thank the Lord for that and so that's what the Holy Spirit is to do today is to discern false doctrine and when they and the fivefold ministry when they make just profit brother Branham and and I've got quotes were that the leadership says brother Branham fulfilled all the fivefold ministry now what does that do that takes all five away from everybody nobody can have a fivefold ministry gift and they say and they say the fivefold ministry has to catch the vision they've got to play the tapes and sit down and stop preaching now that breaks the Word of God and just break in one word look what it did to Eve back in the Garden of Eden just break in one word and here they are breaking four or five words to see meat the meat of God's Word discerns any little any little lie any false doctrine any Antichrist little spirit no discern it and I'll get the leaven out of the church praise God amen so if your eagle you want to feast on those type of things praise God because you want to know the discernment of the Holy Spirit for this hour that we're living in you can't remain in milk and expect to go on the rapture right Paul said in your milk you got to teach you this the original things over like like this prove all things I got to teach you that it that means everything I'm gonna teach people church we need to teach message people that like you've got to take everything brother Branham says and I say and you name the preacher tune through it Donnie Reagan and Bissell you got to take everything back to the word and just be sure it's the Word of God just like a eagle I have this in the book here just like a eagle is not gonna soar unless they eat me right there how they gonna get up to the sky if they're not eating the diet our message believers gonna fly above sin when they're not even feasting on the Word of God that's presented to them they're not reading their Bible or pray like we said if not even more in love with Jesus they're far more with the love with the pleasures of the world how they gonna fly how they gonna fly above sin they're not going to they got to get off the meat or I got off the milk and get on to the meat all right I've got 15 more minutes the Lord willing by God's grace let me see where I'm at okay good okay now let me let me go a little bit further here and then I just want to do the update on the border here oh the order before the rapture I just want to give just a little update on that just a moment but first why will the rapture occur this is the next section most of us are familiar Christ is snatching away his wife off the earth to rescue her from the awful awful wrath of wrath of God and so shall we ever be with the Lord the one thing we've desired is to always be with the Lord right remember the rapture scripture from Psalms 27 where David said in the time of trouble he'll hide me in the cleft of the rock remember that he said one thing I desired all the days what was it to dwell in the house of the Lord praise God then to be one of those Eagles gathered around the fresh meat of the word amen and feasted on the word all the time I know yeah that's what we see here so God's so Christ and bride is so in love with him once more of the word they always want to be with the word I always want to be with Christ he's gonna take him off the earth the Lambs wife made herself ready now let's go back to John 14 Lydia John 14:1 1 2 and 3 this shows why Christ is gonna rapture the bride because he wants our fellowship he wants our fellowship to continue for eternity so let me go ahead John 14:1 through 3 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may also you may be awesome Amen Jesus wants his bride to be right there with him praise God hallelujah we are Pilgrims and strangers on this earth we're seeking a city we're seeking a home praise God the New Jerusalem hallelujah and Christ is going to be gone to prepare us that place praise God that's why the rapture was gonna happen he's gonna finish that place and he's gonna take us to that place amen remember Paul was so in love with Jesus he desired to depart and to be with Christ that was in Philippians 1:23 but he said he said for your sakes though I'll stay and keep ministering and preaching but he desired to depart and to be with Jesus amen now Jesus says in Revelation 3:10 because Las kept the word of my patience I will keep I also will keep thee from the hour temptation that's the that's the worldwide laying down with a mark of the beast which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth and I agree the coronaviruses it's having a worldwide impact right more so even than the swine flu because remember it's got to get to get progressively worse progressively harder all the time as the birth pains as we lead up to the rapture we've never seen it like this before it's it's something that's a little bit more than last time it'll keep going that way they'll try to take the rights right and then though though though we'll get to that a little bit but though though we're gonna try to unite the the economical move with politics but he said if you keep my word I'll keep you from the rapture I'm sorry I'll keep you from the laying down of the mark of the beast parmi he said I'm gonna take you in the rapture amen see God gives everyone space to repent that's in revelation 221 and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not Church God is giving us time and space to repent from it whatever we need to repent from because he's merciful he did this four thousand years ago with the amorite s' number they possessed Canaan in Abraham's lifetime but the Lord told Abraham we give them four hundred more years maybe four thirty four forty came from the exact number to repent but if they didn't their iniquity would be full and that was in Genesis 15:13 two twenty one and you know the story God knew they wouldn't so God brought out Moses exodus out of Egypt and then you know Moses magnified himself glorified himself so God anointed Joshua to take them into the land and try to drive out the Canaanites because the space to repent that God gave the hammerites it wasn't heated - it wasn't obeyed god help us to obey we have a chance to escape wrath we have a chance to repent and obey God may God help us may we make the decision in this space to repent and may we be right with God all the days of our life praise God today God's grace is extending even to Mystery Babylon and even the Roman Catholic Church and her daughter churches because that's what the church days Scripture was saying in Revelation 221 he's giving her and her daughters space to repent these last two thousand years he's saying come out of those churches that Harbor every unclean and hateful evil spirit the Bible calls it but there will come a day when their iniquities full just like the am rights were but for right now you know revelation 18 come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities see if you are Christ's bride even if you're foolish version you'll come out of those sin loving churches that don't believe the whole truth of God's Word and you'll try to get into Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're foolish version you'll at least live a virgin life free from idolatry there's brother Branham we can't worship brother Branham right we thank God for him we honor him look to his teaching point it bring it back to the word but we don't worship Him in idolatry because a virgin doesn't have intercourse in this case the virgin Christian doesn't have intercourse with idols so we see we have to be true to all of God's Word now I want to read a quote because that I was listening to this sermon over and over again it's called God's provided place to worship and I guess this is a quote just to encourage us here if you know the the sermon it's a beautiful sermon brother Branham is showing how in the Old Testament God had one place where he met a believer and that was under his name buh-bam said where is that place today he says this in paragraph 71 my friends I don't want to hurt feelings but I am responsible for a message and that message is notice he doesn't say every word on the tapes is the state the Lord that's not his message you didn't say everybody follow me and every word I say and come to my church no he's saying follow the word he said my message has come out of this mess and if I asked you to come out where am I going to take you but I'm saying his messages they come out of her my people he says where will I take you he said when I take you to the brand tabernacle now notice what a man is trying to point the people not to a building but to a spirit the Holy Spirit buh-bam said the bram tabernacle it's as much as fall as any of the rest of them so but I met brother hams trying to get the people to see it's not about a physical building it's about a spiritual interaction with Jesus Christ he said but there's only one place I can take you to where you're safe and protected from death and that's in Jesus Christ brother Ram says God's place worship hey man that's the place I'm introducing to you tonight where God put his name where he promised he would meet every person that come in there he would worship with him and feast with him that's in Christ not in no church no Tabernacle hey man we're thankful for our local churches but the man but it's not the physical building that were interested in it's the word that's being preached it's the Holy Spirit that's wooing the hearts trying to get people to believe to repent of their sins get baptized justified it's sanctified press out all their bad habits feast on the word get spiritual discernment feast on the deep meat of God's Word and then get born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's what we're trying to get people to do to get to God's provide a place of worship the Holy Spirit praise God amen now in closing let me close with this you know I just want to I was talking with the brothers Simon and cam and I just want to kind of just review the order of things before the rapture so I got like seven steps here now there could be eight or more I just put seven on here now this is my own understanding the first thing that has to happen is more sorrows and earthquakes that's what Jesus said in Matthew 27 or 24 seven eight because that's what we're seeing right now so to me as I was talking this week with the brothers that just kind of clicked as like a revelation that's right we'll see more earthquakes and more pestilences and more sorrows now here's the sec the second thing I think we'll see along with all these is the driverless cars I know there's quotes brother Adam said it already happened but then there's other quotes where he said they don't even have the highways yet we're still waiting on the highways get the balance those out so I believe we're still waiting for the highways we're still waiting for the cars right I know they've tested millions of miles but they're not law they're not they're not in law and we don't have where's all the beautiful big highways what his truck talking about he's all about infrastructure right he was trying to get a two trillion dollar infrastructure bill passed as well to work on the roads that could be wrong on that but that's what it looks like it looks like we're have to see those driverless cars it's the advancements in science we talked about the third thing we'll see is the binding of the tares Jesus said buying the tares first in Matthew 13 let me quote Daniel 12:4 was the increasing of knowledge at the end times that's the driverless cars advancement in science now the binding of Tears Matthew 13 30 is an intense unity in the ecumenical move the churches are going to all come together we don't see that right now right you don't see like people pressuring us to be united with the Catholics and United with the Mormons or something like that or seventh-day Adventists you don't see any political pressure doing that but there will come a unity of churches and the political leaders will unite with those churches to change the laws and brother Graham said and pick up your pen and write force the bride to stop preaching worst a lot of breech braids God so it doesn't seem like that's what's we don't seem like it's the intensity of the binding of the tares just yet but once that happens then Matthew I'm certain the revelation 13:16 brother Graham says starts coming down we start getting so close to the mark of the beast and it's during that time I believe the next thing happens the latter rain will fall this is during the squeeze time or this political pressure time and that's Joel 2 23 to 26 in revelation 3:10 we keep the word of his patience the latter rain will fall because as we get more and more political pressure will get more and more desperate for God hungry for God all the time more and more growing in grace and knowledge of God till it will cry out for rain he'll send us the rain and then I believe after that we'll see the ship the shout I'm sorry I'm sorry the voice we've already seen the shout the voice of the resurrection the same voice that resurrected Lazarus Jesus will resurrect the dead in Christ and I believe will see him just like Matthew 27 53 says Jesus first coming then we'll see the dead in Christ at Jesus the second coming and then the sixth thing will be we which are alive remain will be caught up bodies transformed death is swallowed up in life and will meet the Lord in the air and the seventh the last thing the hour temptation the mark of the beast will be laid down in order to create peace and safety Rome will make her 7-year covenant with Israel and then three and a half years in tribulation they'll break that covenant and this is when the USA vows to the woman I believe I believe that woman is most likely going to be Rome it could be a woman president or vice president but I believe it will be wrong that's when she'll bow and take her leadership all the American churches will take the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church all right Church let's stay on our feet here god bless you yeah let me come here let's sing that listen I want to be burning the midnight oil praise God whoa George oh we can feel the the pulsation of the holy spirit tonight we should already be so close to God nobody should have to freshen us scaring us into a closer walk with God if we're born again the Holy Spirit is constantly drawing our hearts closer for communion fellowship what a consolation praise good the mystery of the rapture revealed to us think about that other billions eight billion people on the earth gets revealed to us praise God those who keep the Word of God may God help us to eat the spiritual meat of God's Word to discern evil from good right from wrong in our daily lives let me pray for you please pray for me pray for the saints God will give us the discernment praise God I've got will give us a heart that hungers and thirsts after righteousness to give us courage to snatch away the promise of God take up the kingdom of God for prayer Bible reading and meditating upon the word will part will snatch away those promises we'll take back what the enemy stole from us praise good let's pray every father we love you we thank you for tonight Maury glory glory hallelujah thank you Jesus for make promises how they do we thank you for the Holy Spirit that we feel tonight here in Oregon thank you for that we're sealing our souls more not going all the way as we have the singing of God in our souls thank you Jesus I prayed tonight now you'll bless your people to Lord with the desire to grow closer to you to feast on the word fall more in love with Jesus and to give them courage with the armor of God to snatch away the kingdom of God to use force to use the word to bring their bodies into subjection to hunger thirst after righteousness those who aren't born again maybe they get desperate when they get hungry I remember when I did Lord God screaming crying out for me and not long after that you answered my prayer you came in and dwelled and my soul morgana you've been thrown there ever since thank you Jesus I believe that with all my heart thank you Lord Jesus you give us an anchor Lord guide you give us a witness your spirit bears witness with our spirit and our life that we are the children of God let us walk in the spirit they that are
