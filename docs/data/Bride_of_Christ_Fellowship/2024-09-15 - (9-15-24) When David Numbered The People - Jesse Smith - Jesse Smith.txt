Bibles here today by God's grace let's go to 2 Samuel 24 verse one I just I'm going to take a little break from the series I normally do I sometimes I just look for inspiration you know and I can normally recognize it when you know I get a new thought that I have never had before I like to preach that so I like to preach on when David numbered the people I like to preach on that today uh I was telling brother William and I were talking about a little bit yesterday having some fellowship around the word of God so uh I was studying it and listening to it praying about it and I just trust this will be a blessing uh today a little later Ona I'll have some slides but not right now I just I don't I got some visuals later when it kind of pertains to the that part of the story when David numbered the people 2 Samuel 24 ver1 Hallelujah uh Haven would you do me a favor real quick could you go get my water real quick my throat's a little dry I'd appreciate that normally don't drink water but with school the school year I've been talking so much and teaching so much voice a little little little little dry here let's read this here uh we'll just read verse one and then we'll have you be seated here by God's grace let's read this Psalm 3 1 2 3 and again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he moved David against them to say go number Israel and Judah may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word today you may be seated praise God thank God it's very kind yeah that was it yes thank you sorry thank you appreciate that thank you you know for years I never had to drink any water I think just as time goes on maybe get a little older and drink a little water so God bless everybody it's good to be in the house of the Lord today I trust the Lord will speak here uh there's a saint from overseas who said she'd be live streaming today so if uh uh the sister uh Sharon Rose I think is her name so she's streaming God bless her uh she'll be coming to the US in a couple weeks here and she hopes to come to this church she's a a wonderful sister um uh she's a little older you know and uh um she wants to come to the US and visit us so I told her uh brother Levi actually down there in Navar Ohio where they built the church uh brother Levi's Church down there um now he's not a pastor but he built the church you know with his brother uh he invited her but you know we kind of met years ago online and she liked you know she follows brother R's Ministry and so hopefully she'll be a guest here in a couple weeks by God's grace uh she wants to talk to my wife and I about some personal questions and kind of like you know maybe end of the life kind of things you know you know uh you know uh you know she's retired and everything like that and I think she's single you know so uh you know just wanting some Direction in life so uh got she requested a conference with my wife and I so I trust God will use my gifts you know and then God will use my wife's gifts there to help our dear sister so God bless our sister uh if she's live streaming so we want to look at when David number the people again this may seem like a little odd of season but I believe God's word is always in season praise God and I like to sometimes I like to take a break off the uh series and uh preach you know maybe a fresh thought uh I read this this week and I was just blown away again I was uh I was just reminded of many things in the scripture that I hadn't thought about for a while and you know God's mercy on David and of course we've been preaching a little bit on David with the message of Grace how many enjoyed those I enjoyed those too uh such a blessing and um reminder to our hearts of how merciful and gracious God is now I don't know how much you'll do this but you know I put two markers in my Bible uh because this this story has a parallel passage so I put a marker in 2 Samuel 24 and I put one in 1 Chronicles I think it's 21 yes 21 so I don't know if you if you have uh some bookmarks in your Bible and you want to uh move back and forth you know I invite you to do that now if you'd like to I'll be flipping back and forth you know we we get the same story but we get more details you know one from the writer of Samuel 2 Samuel and one from the writer of Chronicles and uh you know this this story of course is you know amazed me over the years uh but you know I think it kind of comes in season here uh by God's grace as we were looking at David a few weeks ago go uh kind of comes in the the season here as we're looking at uh these things here in the scripture so uh 2 Samuel 24 verse1 we'll start here kind of build our thought here I trust the Lord will speak to us here today how many want the Lord to speak to them amen hallelujah verse one and again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he moved David against them to say go number Israel and Judah now the first thing I noticed here as I was studying was again the anger of the Lord was moved against Israel this wasn't a one-time thing where God got angry at Israel right uh we know 10 times they spoke against God and Moses in the wilderness and because of that God kept the majority of them out of the promised land right 10 times and so God is merciful god is gracious um but here another time you know and church I guess you know after we watched that David movie a couple years ago such a great movie the best movie I've ever seen I think um after we watch that you know it it would seem like you know Israel was just uh per almost perfect you know like the anointing of God was on each and every person that's what it seems like sometimes right but if you read the scripture it's not that way Hallelujah now brother B says you know Solomon's days when he built the temple that was uh that was the golden years of Israel no doubt but what happened at the end of that he turned his his wives turned his heart away so even in that Golden Years even in that golden uh prefigure of the Millennium at the end of that the people turned away church we have a great responsibility to stay in tune with the Holy Spirit and not to turn away no wonder God would anoint Paul Griffin to come in here and say the Lord told me we must keep our first love and we'd receive it praise God so if you received it you ought to be rejoicing this morning amen because you got your first love amen it's something that when when you lose it you know you got to get it back but you don't know how sometimes you don't know how it's going to work out but God is rich in Mercy Hallelujah and God the Bible said his anger will only last for a moment hallelujah amen oh God's love is so great and merciful amen and so we see that you know you know I guess I've had pictures in my mind after watching David oh my the Israel just they conquered everything right they expanded their territories and it was just a it was just a picnic well of course we know that wasn't the case after basba and the Uriah sin of David and then remember uh four four uh four sons of David died because of that decision because he spoke it he spoke whoever did this will restore him fourfold and so David's own judgment was used against him and Jesus said as you judge others that's how God will judge you so how many want to be gracious Hallelujah we got to stay with the word but we got to be gracious Hallelujah that's right however we judge others that's how God will judge us amen and so uh we get to this spot here where we're at the towards the end of of David's life and we looked at his life you know U he probably fell with bash Sheba andah situation I think around the time he was if not mistaken it was around 47 or 55 somewhere in there I can't remember the exact number but then this one would have been about four years later he was either in his mid-50s or the his older 50s and so David of course has had great victories he's been a great leader uh he's been a man after God's Own Heart hallelujah how many want to be a man after God's Own Heart a woman after God's Own Heart but see even even even in that we see you know God from Heaven God calls him a man after his own heart but he wasn't always perfect right just like with job God calls job perfect in heaven but then he comes down to earth and said who is this Hallelujah I just caught that fresh Revelation this week you know in job 37 you know God come down and told job where were you when all the sons of God were shouting for Joy now so many people think job was one of those sons of God shouting for Joy but he could not have been or else why would God say where were you God would be saying where were you don't you remember you were there shouting no God's saying you don't remember because you were in my mind there's no pre-existence so it just again shows the uh the the the the the wisdom that we need on the scripture God wouldn't say where were you and job said well I know where I was God wouldn't let himself get rebuked like that it was the angels of God the angels of God were shouting and glorifying God look at this creation our God is mighty our God is Creator hallelujah amen they were sh shouting and giving God glory brother man said that's where shouting religion started before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and we just get a part of it amen of course we know Jesus even danced before the foundation of the world he was rejoicing before the father Hallelujah according to Proverbs chapter 8 Hallelujah but now we see you know the anger of the Lord is again so it reminds us you know uh we can be so pure I say like this we can be pure for so many years they been read it this week ASA was so faithful to God King ASA God gave him I think it was eight or 10 years of peace right because he was so faithful but after his unfaithfulness then they went back to war Hallelujah so we got to rejoice in seasons of uh peace and we got a battle in seasons of War Hallelujah and we fight on our knees as we sang it on Wednesday Hallelujah The Battle Belongs that was a requested song for Wednesday Hallelujah we fight on our knees and then we let God fight our battles hallelujah amen that's right Hallelujah now I looked it up I you know I was curious this morning I thought how many times do the Bible said the Ang of the Lord was kindled like a fire 15 times the Bible said his anger was kindled like a fire so I want you to listen to these as I read through these and and you'll know this is when you know when God's anger might be kindled against you Hallelujah now we know the Bible said we grieve the Holy Spirit right because the Bible said neither give place to the devil so when we grieve the Holy Spirit we give the devil a place in our minds it's not demon possession it's demon oppression right oppression right get oppressed or discouraged or defeated or in David's case we'll see prideful he was oppressed with pride Hallelujah all right got some good Bible readers out there everybody you studying the scriptures lately hopefully these will be real familiar with you by God's grace so David's generation they were they were faithful at the beginning just like David but after a number of years they begin to backslide we've been talking about I'll heal your backslidings and they backl in such a way where God got angry with the nation Hallelujah so think about that they capture all this land you know they expand their territories but that's what the Bible says uh the Bible you know the Bible warned Israel through Moses when you get prosperous he said don't forget the Lord who gave you the prosperity that's what we find in our lives when things are easy there's no trials that's when we'll do a little compromise or we'll get a little cold on God because there's no battle going on God help us to be faithful and true Hallelujah in Good Seasons and in Bad seasons God help us to be in season in season I'm sorry in in season and out of season Hallelujah so in other words if you're in a peaceful season stay dedicated to God keep yourself on the altar of God's altar Hallelujah altar the Bible said you and I are a Living Sacrifice who's the sacrifice you are praise God Amen present yourself present your body a Living Sacrifice to Jesus amen take up your cross daily and follow him Hallelujah now let's go through these there there's there's 15 times the anger of the lord I want you to uh remember I'm I want you to think of these I'm sure you'll be reminded of some of them by God's grace see how my stuttering Austin see I told you that's why I never do live videos brother I just stutter back and forth I can't I'm not much of a public speaker Hallelujah 15 times the first time the anger Lord is kindled is Exodus 4 verse4 when Moses says I'm not eloquent he make there it is amen hallelujah he keeps saying I'm not eloquent I can't do it he makes all these excuses and the Bible said the anger of the Lord was against Moses he said don't you know I can send Aaron too God got angry in church it I think it was later that chapter the next chapter God was going to kill him because he didn't circumcise his sons God doesn't play around with sin and the church said church God don't play around with our sin Hallelujah God's he's going to chasen us if we won't repent he's going to chasen us and as the story says you know you might not get it right away but you're going to get chastening eventually the Bible said our sins find us out and glory and he chastens every son or daughter that he loves Hallelujah that's proof God loves you that he won't let you get away with something Hallelujah but it'll chasen you the second time was numbers 11:10 Israel was complaining all we got as Mana that's all we got we wish should go back to Egypt and have all this food and everything and the Bible said it kindled the anger of the Lord as they were mourning in their tents and so God sent quail meet to them that was numbers 11:10 so complaining when you got everything complaining for something greater God gets angry with that that's why the Bible said godliness with contentment is a great gain well I'm not like that person I'm not like that person I don't have as much money or land or Prosperity or gifts or anything like that you know no be content with what God gave you fear God and keep his commands Hallelujah see God got angry I've given you enough I didn't promise you all these things but they wanted to be like Egypt they wanted to go back and be like the world Amen God got angry because they're complaining so that that's a that's a common one for all of us we all got to be careful not to complain me you all of us we've all got to be careful don't complain be grateful Hallelujah that's right Church third is uh numbers 129 and I preached this years ago uh God got angry with Miriam and Aaron because they spoke against the interracial marriage of Moses and Zapora and I preached that there in Lima I wasn't the pastor yet never the pastor in Lima but I preach it I I use this scripture I said those who spoke against it it kindled the wrath of God right when brother Brooks let his daughter uh marry black and white I preach it and I said that and I stand behind that praise God because that's the Bible amen amen hallelujah that's right see but God that kindled God's anger you're you're uh speaking against someone's marriage that I ordained I ordained this Hallelujah God had had enough of it remember what happened it was more awful on Miriam I don't know so maybe she was the ring leader but it was more awful on her numbers 25:3 God's anger was kindled at bpor and that was all because of balum right balum took some money some wages and he tempted the sons of Israel to have fornication with the daughters of Baal and the Bible said that angered the that stir up the anger of the Lord so see sexual sin right Brothers battle in pornography whatever or any sexual sin it angers God and God said you need to repent of that Hallelujah get away from that amen the fear of the Lord will cause you not even to look at it anybody remember the fear of the Lord this week I did amen I need it I need it every week praise God we need it every week Hallelujah so these are ways that people stirred up God's anger in the Bible now there's lots of these Deuteronomy 6 I'm not going to read the verses Deuteronomy 7 Deuteronomy 29 and Joshua 23 all warn against going after other gods and that will Kinder Kindle the anger of God right now we think oh well I'm not worshiping brother brandham but church if we're depending in our money or our spouse or our job if we're depending in that and being more faithful and we care more about that than the house of God something's wrong we got an idol on our lives Hallelujah remember brother am said that man who was critical that fell at his feet remember in Windsor he said that man worshiped that spirit that was his Idol his Idol was anger against preachers that was his Idol right that's what brother R says so it can be so in other words depression any sin that people are caught in it becomes their Idol they want that feeling more than they want the freedom of God thank God that he sets all of our chains free amen he breaks every train he's the way maker amen he's the promis keeper he's the light in the darkness Hallelujah see that so any any sin that we don't take care of right away it becomes an idol and God says it'll Kindle his anger against us church we don't want to live under the anger of God so that and now church this just so you know this is what I believe was the issue with David's time because the Bible doesn't tell us why God got angry doesn't tell us now if you find it you let me know I just searched it the last few days I've been reading it this week you find why God got M we don't know but it just says again Israel angered God now look at their pattern right look at their pattern David's time the got angry salon's time they got angry now the Bible said God got angry at Salon why because the idols Hallelujah so it just seems to be it's probably the most likely case but it doesn't matter because we've got to look at our lives are there any Idols in our lives anything we love more than we love the Lord hallelujah Joshua 71 the next time anger was kindled aen took the accursed thing God says specifically don't take these things don't touch these things he took them and the anger of the Lord Lord was kindled usza studied the ark and the Bible said he died because of his Heir he was touching something he should not have touched right David should have told him that that was David's responsibility right uh David put it on a new cart they all put it on a new cart it doesn't go on a new cart it goes on the shoulders of the Levites Hallelujah but God got angry they should have known better they're in the promised land amen they're not in Egypt they're in God's promised land they got copies of the word amen there's there's a good indication right there why God might have why they might have fallen away they might have forsaken the Lord because they didn't even know the they had the word right remember God told Moses tell the Kings which would have been Saul every year they had to write a brand new Bible can you imagine that every year they had to write write a brand new Bible the king had to sit there and listen to it that's right that's right amen amen hallelujah praise God every year a brand new copy of the Bible amen I like getting a new Bible every year I would like that but I don't do that but I just love a new Bible praise God but every year and so it's seems like Israel had somehow forsaken the law of the Lord in the time of David because they didn't even know and then yeah then David said why why did the Lord do this he didn't even know why he why God did it and later he found out uh I was off the word see church sometimes we can be so busy doing things we forget to check everything by the word of God that's right that's why coming to church is so powerful Hallelujah you the Holy Spirit if you have a need I'll say like this and we're open to receiving uh from God God will direct all that we have need of to everybody God can take me off my notes as you said God can take any preacher off any note and give you you and I exactly what we need if we're willing to receive it praise God that's right that's why Church attendance is so important Hallelujah and that's what that's what we read there uh on Sunday night with the fear of the Lord remember children in Deuteronomy 4 God told Moses tell them to gather and to hear the preaching because that that way they'll learn the fear of the Lord see if we're not learning the fear of the Lord either the preacher's wrong or our hearts are wrong God help us to be all right Hallelujah the preacher I'm checking my heart that's why I'm here praying you know that's why I'm seeking God I want my heart to be right each and every person's heart should be made right as we come to the house of God hallelujah amen now I may not preach an hour and a half today we'll see we see Hallelujah I was kind of my wife said I was kind of real real Stern on Wednesday night and I was I wasn't it just came I don't know what it Hallelujah I'm just thankful for God's grace sometimes God's grace is Stern Hallelujah then the next time we got three more uh 2 Kings 13:3 God's anger was kindled against joash again for idolatry 2 Chronicles 25:14 and 15 again anger kindled against King amziah for bringing Gods he defeated Assyria I think it was and he brought their gods back oh mercy you win a victory over the enemies then you bring the enemy sin right into your life no sir no sir yeah the Bible said we should not uh the Bible says uh we should not envy Sinners don't no matter how much money Elon mus has Jeff bezos's married to second time he's an adulterer the Bible said don't envy men like that you don't know what they're going through in their private life nobody knew it Michael Jackson died nobody knew the King of Pop nobody knew that he had to take drugs just to go to sleep and then he died because of that because he had so many demons demons tormenting him yet he own had a billion dollars and what good does that do if you can't get a good night's rest oh the blessings of God you should be so thankful if you've got peace in your heart hallelujah hallelujah if you got a clear conscience you're one of the richest people alive today amen hallelujah you got a clean conscience before God you confessed all your sins serving God with all your heart soul mind and strength trying to be content you're the richest person on Earth hallelujah amen glory amen that's been a while since I did I felt pretty good amen hallelujah amen Isaiah 5 is the last one that I could find now I could find I was looking for that phrase Israel had Cast Away the law of God and despised the law therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against it so Cast Away again brings that mind to If You cast it away it's like the backsliding right you turn from it you turn from it you cast it away and you walk in your own ways that's the official definition of backsliding Turning Away Hallelujah so I'm not making good progress in this chapter I was hoping to preach the whole chapter but see now the anger of the Lord was kindled now if you read in 1st Chronicles 211 the Bible said Satan stood up against Israel and provoke David to number Israel so some people have stumbled over this because it says um God moved David against Israel another one it says Satan moved David against Israel which one's true both you got to understand the wording of God hallelujah you have to understand the ways of God just like with Ahab right they had a Heavenly counsil and God said who will go for me I need a lying Spirit right Hallelujah so see God and this is one of these this is one of these amazing cases I preached it years ago but God work God knows when we're going to sin God knows when we're going to give into the devil he has perfect for knowledge Church look think he knows when you're going to get Victory praise God but he also knows when you might stumble and fall and so God can even work out your stumbling for his glory and in this case God worked out David's stumbling and all this idolatry that Israel been doing for years God worked it all out I'm going to chasen them at the same time amen because God's not surprised God's not I didn't know they were going to do that I didn't know God knows all things you can't you can't hide anything from God hallelujah d uh Adam tried to hide from God but God came looking for God came looking for you and I hallelujah amen even though we're the Sons and Daughters of God even though we fall short and our sins make us guilty make us want to hide from God God will still come look looking for you and I praise God that's love amen that's amazing love hallelujah amen remember God gives us the desires of our hearts whether it's good or bad God gave balam his heart's desire to go make money God gave hezekiah's heart's desire should have died the first time but he wanted 15 more years right here God lets David have his heart's desire his heart's desire is to know how many warriors he has in his country right everybody see that so Satan stood up and provoked David that means to lure he lured him in he set a trap and said come on come on over here David come on over here I'm Gonna Catch You like we do with our our mice at home right we lay out that Trap please come please now I'm not waiting up at night for them but they get caught anyway but he's luring D David you ever think how great you are do you want to know uh how many mighty men you have wouldn't you like to know how much God has blessed you oh that Lyon devil that Lon devil wouldn't you like to know the extent of your greatness you're so great David you're a man after God's Own Heart wouldn't it be awesome to see the fruit of your ministry I didn't preach plan to preach that but that's what he's saying the devil's Whispering wouldn't you like to see how how many Valiant men you have produced that have come out of your ministry David's like yes I like to see that and he chases over he chases that and he gets caught in the devil's trap now God allowed that God said okay devil you can do that because that's his sin he's going to go after either way but I'm going to use this to chasen David and the people because they've been probably sacrificing Idols transgressing against my word so Satan provoked David God allowed it and church remember uh in second Samuel 24:10 David repents and said David's heart smoted him after he numbered the people and David son the Lord I've sinned greatly oh I like this here here's David turning back he's no longer a backslider he's returned to God hallelujah oh that ought to help us that don't encourage us amen we make an awful mistake but the there's the conviction of the Holy Spirit and the the God Is So merciful he brings conviction so that we can say I'm the guilty one it's my fault it was my sin forgive me bring me back into Fellowship Hallelujah that's the mercy of God hallelujah and David said the Lord I've sinned greatly in the in that I've done and now I've been beseech thee Oh Lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for I've done very foolishly that's what I love about David even in the midst of his mistakes he could say it was my fault I'm the one that's done wrong I was like a fool I did it wrong I was outside the word I despised the word of God that's what the Bible said he despised God and he despised God's word he went he went against the word of God on purpose but he was able to say like a real man right a real woman he said God forgive me it was my fault wash me in your blood forgive me created me a clean heart don't take your holy Spirit Away From Me let the spirit of God rest on my life Hallelujah Don't Take Your Blessings away Hallelujah don't let don't let your wrath be kindled against me forever in your mercy have Grace upon me hallelujah hallelujah that's right God allowed Satan to tempt David just like God allowed job to be tempted by Satan and Israel needed chastening so God uses for knowledge and David's weakness with pride Hallelujah to bring chastening on David and Israel that's right and remember Satan provokes David here remember Moses was provoked by the people right see Church you know so sometimes the Satan will just come to your mind battles and that'll provoke you into a trap of the devil or other times Satan will anoint people around you that will move you into a mistake right but it's Satan trying to provoke people trap them in right but how many know that we can be delivered how many know in every Temptation there's a way out oh my there's always a way of Escape 1 Corinthians 10:13 we don't have to read it but uh I just got it memorized I've been looking at that recently in every way in every trial in every Temptation God makes a way of Escape Hallelujah there's a way out there's an exit sign every time Hallelujah there's always a way out Hallelujah and this reminds us of member God allowed a buffing demon to torment Paul's flesh to keep him humble God allowed David to be tempted by Satan himself and then a buffeting demon uh tormented Paul to keep him humble God allowed it the Bible said God sent the lying spear to Ahab it just shows God orders all of our steps nothing is outside of God's plan for our lives Even in our weaknesses Even in our failures God is allowing everything to bring us to a a spot where we can say God you have been good to me praise God because it's the goodness of God that leads us to repentance hallelujah it's not our goodness because we don't have a lot of it amen right yeah we are baptized with the Holy Ghost but that's only one part of us we got two-thirds that are not very good I'd say not good at all Hallelujah and then the Bible said an evil spirit from the Lord was given to Saul in 1st Samuel 18:9 because remember God anointed David the anointing came on him and so the anointing left Saul and an evil spirit came on Saul from the Lord because that's what Saul wanted right God will give us whatever we want hallelujah how many want the Holy Spirit praise God that's what we should have today every day we should always want God's spirit because God's spirit is spirit and it's life Hallelujah gives us life and then this is one I haven't read this one for a while so case you put this one up here Ezekiel 14:9 and10 Ezekiel 149 and 10 and the doctor told me years ago don't drink coffee if you're going to preach and well that's my biggest stumbling block right there he said it's not good you remember when we sat down at the the bed and breakfast there in Grand Rapids and the doctor said that one of the doctors that's what that's when he told me he's like or no his that he was a preacher and he said his doctor told him that I'm like that's gonna be a tough one uh yeah Ezekiel 14:9 and if that Prophet be deceived when he has spoken a thing I the Lord have deceived that Prophet remember Wednesday I was giving you examples of real life false prophets that have prophesied Chris Reed uh Kenneth copelan man there's a million of them they've all used the name of the Lord and they've lied in the name of the Lord you know God allowed them to do that I don't doubt God allowed them to have some of those visions and dreams but that wasn't from God God allowed it it was from the devil right Chris Reed knew about brother Brandon he texted me I have personal texts from him saved he knew about brother brandom but he lied in the name of the Lord and what got him it was sexual sin got him too just like that brother from across the state I told you about earlier this year back in April look at that verse uh he said I the Lord have deceived that Prophet who did God did see because God's got to give you what you want thank God God give us the truth today Hallelujah like brother said whether it burns your hide you ever burn an animal hide I haven't I've just seen them in the movies brother said whether it burns your hide or whether it chokes you out whatever it does God just give me the truth hallelujah hallelujah don't give me what my flesh wants give me what my soul wants Hallelujah Deliver Me From Myself Hallelujah because that's our greatest enemy is our self I the Lord deceive that Prophet I will stretch out my hand upon him and I'll destroy him from the midst of My People Israel amazing thing is these guys still live into their 80s today they false prophets what the only explanation is God is extra gracious gracious under this Covenant that's the only explanation I can think of right God took haniah out the very year he prophesied against Jeremiah remember Jeremiah said 70 years hananiah said thus say the Lord two years Jeremiah said that man will die this year and he died in the ninth month well how can these people lie in the name of the Lord today it must be the grace of God well some of them actually died this year too there were some of those false prophets that died this year one of them died a few years ago with co uh he he preached he preached oh co will never come to the real Believers he preached that in the name of the Lord one of these false internet prophets these prosperity prophets he died the same year with Co God have mercy verse 10 and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity see these false prophets they know what they're doing the punishment of the Prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him so see anyone who follows a false prophet the prophet's guilty and that congregation's guilty because they're they're heaping to themselves teachers having itching ears they're both under the same lying Spirits right Hallelujah the false prophet and the people following them the the Bible says in the Old Testament my people are deceived and he said they love to have it so they love to be deceived they love to be lied to think about that church that ought to really make us understand that God loves us that he'd only let us accept the truth of his word he would let us swi or or drift into such nonsense as that but we get anchored we get founded on the solid rock of God's word hallelujah amen we ought to be thankful praise God hallelujah I'm in touch with a brother from I'm not going to say the state but he followed those Prosperity guys for 20 some years and he was given hundreds of I don't know how many thousands I shouldn't say hundreds he was giving thousands of dollars to these prosperity guys and he was just going along with it and he said he did see some genuine Miracles it seemed like but then one day God showed him the ministry of William brandham and he dropped all that and came right to the truth he said wow and those guys even preached about brother BR while he was sitting there but see it just proves God has an ordained time and season for every single person God will bring you to the truth at the right timej even if you're no matter where you are even if you're in the midst of a deceived false prophet church and if you're a seat of God God's going to come looking for you God's going to find you prodal Hallelujah he's going to bring you back to the fold because nobody can stop God there's no man that can pluck you and I out of the father's hand hallelujah amen glory to God and that brother you know he and I met there at Panera with my children a few years ago he's been a tremendous support to this ministry I've just been Amazed by that you know uh you know we're a small church right so God uh so God sends people outside of our church to support our church it's just the mercy of God God loves his people so much now verse two 2 Samuel 24:2 for the king said to joab the captain of the host which is with him go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan even to be Sheba so start in the north Dan was in the north go all the way south to beerseba Beba is one of the most southern cities of Israel I don't know what tribe but I didn't have time to look that up I knew I preach it at one time but I don't know right now and number ye the people that I may know the number of the people now this was a trap so the devil said you need to know the number that'll really make you feel good see the fruit of your ministry right that'll really make you see what a mighty man you are and how many Valiant men you've affected see that's why all these false churches but you know they try to number oh we've saved 177,000 souls online and all this stuff have you really have you really oh we donated all these millions to what to Bible schools that teach you to prophesy falsely and they all these numbers oh we sent 17 million there 18 million there 20,000 people been through our schools to do what to blaspheme the word of God in many cases not every case but many cases see how the enemy likes to draw you in with numbers is that right you need to find out the exact number verse three and joab said to the king now the Lord thy God add to the people how many soever they be hundredfold God bless you hundredfold so that the Eyes of My Lord the king may see it but why doth my Lord the king Delight in this thing see when when someone's got pride no matter how you try to talk him they won't give in no matter how much you try to reason with them and show them the truth they won't give in and he was doing something wrong here now remember Moses numbered the people twice right but see God told him to number that God never told David to number the people this was just his own heart's desire right and even when D when Moses numbered him he said I'm numbering you so we have a record of it because he was about records amen and they said now everybody's got to pay a shekele to the house of God now you got to pay a tax or I should say extra offering shouldn't say tax we don't like the word tax he said now you got to pay a special offering you got to pay because God purchased you amen God brought you out of Egypt he brought you out by a mighty hand Hallelujah he brought you out so give a offering give a blessing to God because God purchased you and saved you out of Egypt Hallelujah in this case David has no word from God and he doesn't ask them to do a shekele of offering either so so nobody's so the so the temple the ministry is not benefited here the only one that's benefited is David and his own complex right his own his own Pride well I've got this many numbers this many that's all he wanted and this reminds me of when brother B said this I uh did you know remember this I preached the series on Pride this was I don't even have the date here but brother said my subject would be Pride oh Pride such a curs of thing so of so evil is pride but yet I found that's what message Believers struggle with the most that are the most sincere I'm going to say that again the sin I've seen message believers who are the most sincere the most dedicated the sin they struggle with the most is pride because if the devil can't get you with lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the only thing he can get you with is pride and we have to fall short right we have to Die daily so we'll probably have some sin eventually right but pride is the area brother it's such an awful thing it's a cursed thing remember it is a cursed thing because remember First Corinthians 11 uh the Bible said many are died and sickly among you because they don't discern the body of the Lord right Hallelujah so we have to make sure we love one another in the body of Christ amen but if not God may allow a curse on our health right get sick some people die that happened to my mom's church I told you that after after that pastor's wife said thus sayith the Lord serpent seeds of the devil they went through a season of death I forget how many 20 30 uh uh funerals they had in a couple years we were keeping track for a little bit we don't play around with God hallelujah you don't speak when God doesn't tell you to speak brother baham said again he said oh God have mercy on this sinful world what a horrible curse pride is he says oh you're too good sure we go to church and we know better than that we don't believe in Divine Healing oh we have nothing to do with that now that for us that wouldn't be us but if if we ever think we're better than somebody else pride has entered in right just because I go to akan or just because I go to uh bluon or just because I go to uh Happy Valley or whatever just because I go there I am a better person that's a lie that's Pride you are what you are because of the grace of God that's what Paul said Paul said I labor more not I that labor but but but Grace that labors in me hallelujah it's the grace of God call me to labor it's the grace of God that's kept me here as a pastor 18 years amen that's God's grace hallelujah it's God's grace that kept me uh saved since the year 2000 that's just God's grace it's God's mercy Hallelujah I got that quote from Brother BR he says the sinner that just got saved five minutes ago is no more special than me as a preacher and he's been preaching for 20 30 years see in the sight of God we're all valuable we're all children of God hallelujah now we all got responsibilities right and we'll all uh we'll all reap what we sow but as far as value we don't say we're better or act like we're better we must not let Pride this horrible curse of Pride we must not let it overtake us he said oh pride is such an evil thing he says such an evil thing no remember what pride is pride is exalting your thoughts above the word right that's why that's why brother R says it he says the spirit of God will never direct you outside of the the word of God I love that one I'm GNA do that one again yeah I like that one the spirit of God it because it wrote the word amen yeah it wrote the word it can't take you out of the word it can only take you deeper into the word hallelujah because he wrote the word I love it now goes on to say so it's Pride Church no matter the warnings joab gives him Jo was a man he was a mighty man he was the one that uh went through the gutter the water gutter the Gyan spring and he's the one that defeated the jebusites when they were undefeatable Hallelujah so David made him captain of the host because he did something no other man was able to do for hundreds of years talk about a man now of course he had his mistakes later on you know I think murder was involved you know all kinds of but that's kind of how they were without the baptism of Holy Ghost Church what can you say you without the baptis the Holy Ghost they were just trying their best in their human spirits but we have something greater Hallelujah we have much greater Hallelujah now we read down to verse uh three why do you Delight in this joab said notwithstanding though King's word prevailed against joab see especially leaders got to be careful what we decide because the pastor's word or the preacher's word now getting down even the husband's word will prevail every time unless you got a woman running the house right let's hope it's not that way if it is it's time for some marriage counseling Hallelujah and some repentance but see the man the leader leader of the home leader the church his words always going to Prevail so see pride prevailed although the warning came but look it's God's grace God always sends Grace right God always sends a warning before Judgment of course this is a minor judgment not an eternal judgment it's a minor judgment man my goodness that busy body up there right verse four that prevailed now now I'm just going to skip through verse 5 six they send out joab and and they go to number the people now go down to verse N9 and joab gave the sum of the number of the people un the king and there were in Israel 800,000 Valiant men think of that that Drew The Sword and that's just what the devil wanted him to know I got 800 now for us it might be I got 800,000 in my bank account right but him he's like oh 800,000 warriors with swords you know that was the pride look at my God took my one seed and multiplied me 800,000 times that was the Trap Of The Devil provoking him to see how great are you how great you're you're you're amazing you're a man after God's Own Heart you need to know that number don't have to you know why because then David would learn to trust in his soldiers rather than trust in God sir everybody listening that's why the Bible said don't trust in uncertain riches the Bible says that can't trust in your bank account Church don't trust in that you got to trust in the Living God the Bible says always I know it's a struggle especially in America but we always got to overcome that by God's grace never trust in uncertain riches because they can be taken away at any time so here's what happens and then there's the men of Judah were 500,000 men now 8 + 5 is 13 right so 1,300,000 soldiers what a man I am look at my Ministry we get a million views on our videos see how they're s they can be sin in that right it becomes it becomes this prideful thing look look what I've done but God didn't tell him to do it we have to be very careful what is God calling us to do did God ask me to do that did God lead me to do that we must be very careful Hallelujah that's right so he counts the people 1.3 million now remember this was an Abomination the sight of joab that's we're don't have to read it but it's 1st Chronicles 21:6 so joab knew this whole time isn't it interesting joab was more spiritual than David at that point just in that moment right because he was being led out he was being lured and enticed by the numbers and the pride but joab was more humble during that time that's right now you know what verse 10 we read that David's heart smoked and thank God for the conviction of the holy spirit that that's what I see church that's what I see in message churches especially and that's why this year this summer I was grateful I could travel to those churches and I was thankful to see Men actually smot in their heart about their sins it was refreshing to me because sure sometimes we just get in the routine right go to church go to work go to church go to work and we just get we get lazy on God and the conviction of the Holy Spirit doesn't come like you really feel it right because we become callous sometimes in our hearts and minds and the church said amen every I mean everybody everybody goes through that don't you right the fear of the Lord though is the your answer against that Hallelujah fear of the Lord the loving obedience right in the in profound honor right where's Eden remember I showed Eden profound honor last Sunday night remember remember that profound honor that's what we got to have we got to have that profound honor towards God I don't want to sin against you I want to do what's right we got to be like joab this sin would be an Abomination Pride would be an Abomination oh God don't let a a disgusting thing come upon my testimony and David admits I've done very foolishly remember Jesus called the disciples foolish for not believing the women that resurrected right sometimes we all can be foolish right we make mistakes we should not have done that we were warned not to do that we know we're not to do that the Bible tells us not to do that yet we still do it so a honest person an honest Christian will say Lord forgive me I did a foolish thing now verse 11 for when David was up in the morning the word of the Lord came unto the prophet Gad David sear saying now Haven asked me about time management on Sunday night now when does the word of God come to Gad in the morning David said every morning early in the morning will I sing praises to your name early morning will I seek your face see how church is really important to do that by God's grace now the word can come anytime but in this case when did it come in the morning Jesus went out to pray in Mark 135 in the morning a great while before day before the cares of the world could steal his time how many feel like that sometimes your your time just gets like stolen from you but you got to be like Jesus you got to make time for Jesus you got to make time for your prayer life make time for God when does the word come the morning came in the morning when did the sermon come to me this morning when or I'm sorry this week in the morning when I was studying Hallelujah that's right verse 12 go and say unto David thus sayith the Lord I offer thee three things choose thee one of them that I might do it unto thee now I was talking to my brother William and I said this I don't I couldn't think of another time in the Bible where God said you choose your punishment and so the only thing we could think of is that God loved David so much that he allowed him to have his choice because of his love for David Church you and I don't often get to choose which way it's going to go but God lets David choose because God knows he's a man after his own heart Hallelujah it kind of reminds me of Joshua God never honored a man's word like when Joshua said Son stand thou still because Joshua is such a dedicated believer right and then the only other thing I can see like this is when God told Solomon ask anything buddy my son beloved jedadiah ask anything whatever you ask it's yours so when God really loves somebody when God really sees someone's dedicated sacrifice God will give you a choice what do you want haty ride amen hallelujah God gave her the choice amen she said that's nothing but the truth brother brandom God can speak things into existence Hallelujah ask whatever you want God really loved that poor woman Hallelujah said she had a farm on a hill and she was uh she was just she have to to sit on the hill and plant now you you guys were we saw the orchard yesterday right there's a little bit of a hill there that's like Hattie right she's on a hill planting things out there just to have food and then the $20 she made off the farm she gave it uh she wanted to give it to brother BR or she gave it to Sister Ma and brother BR said give me that money I'm gonna go give it back to Sister Haddie and brother BR had it in his pocket and the Lord said don't you do that because the widow woman Jesus saw the widow woman's offering as well in other words God's going to bless her what what did God bless her with this salvation of her two boys Hallelujah the greatest Miracle there ever was hallelujah amen glory that wasn't in my notes either Hallelujah so just interesting it's not always God but interesting he says you have your choice what do you want you want seven years of famine do you want to run from your enemies for three months or do you want three days of pestilence now which one do you think he chose what would you choose seven years three three months or three days I'd rather take three days wouldn't you God's gonna chase me I don't want to I don't want to waste seven years of my life suffer I don't want to suffer for seven years I don't want to suffer for three months I'll take it in three days hallelujah is there any shame in this no this is just David being a man this is David in The Human Experience Hallelujah trying to overcome so David needed some time he Saidi in a great straight verse 14 and David said un Gad I in a great straight let us now fall into the hand of the Lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall in the hand of a man how many know God is more merciful than Sinners amen how many know God is more gracious than your enemies praise God David knew this praise God David had family that wanted to kill him and the church said and would actually try to hunt him down and kill him and speak evil against him and call him evil and make his name remember take away his name and give him titles remember that the son of Jesse that's a good Revelation Simon taught us there by God's grace he knew what it's like to be under the the Judgment of man he said I'd rather be under the hand of God the Judgment of God than the Judgment of man this is a remember this was a God I'm sorry this was a god who'd forgiven David of adultery and murder already so no wonder he chose this if God spared my life after I murdered and committed adultery well then surely he'll have mercy on me again how many believe his mercies are renewed every morning this is a man who' been forgiven this is a man who' done foolish things and what does he do another foolish thing Church don't let the devil beat you up if you do another foolish thing just get some Godly revenge in your heart and say I'm done with this sin I'm not going to do this sin I'm done with it Hallelujah God forgive me I was foolish here I was foolish there I won't do it again I want to honor God I want the fear of the Lord in my life hallelujah hallelujah that's what the Bible said the fear of the Lord remember you have to first hate the sin then you've got to depart from it and not linger and meditate on it and love it right and then the Bible said s Proverbs 2 then you seek God and then when you seek God you cry out to God God restore my strength God help me then the Bible and then God will give you the fear of the Lord and you'll understand the fear of the Lord then now I understand it oh praise God hallelujah now this is what I should do this is how I overcome Now by this I'll overcome nothing but the blood of Jesus Now by this I'll reach my home nothing but the blood of Jesus oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other Fountain I know with me nothing but the blood of Jesus this is All My Hope and peace this is all my righteousness only the blood of Jesus Christ I I have none I have none of my own I'm trusting in the righteousness of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we must do it by God's grace now I never read these quotes I wanted to read these they're good reminders now we see pride like I said I see pride and I believe these brothers in the message can have the Holy Ghost but let me just read it again brother bam said now notice sometimes great gu get together you hear them say great so and so great so and so don't never do that somebody this week uh sent me a a a a comment on YouTube and said you're a great man of God how could you teach that I said first I'm not a great man of God I corrected that right away right because if if I start taking compliments like that what do it leads to Pride remember the Rich Young Ruler said oh good Master he said who's good but God my wife got a good Revelation on that one he was testing him to see if he believed he was God right do you know Jesus is God he should have known but he didn't he just thought he was a regular teacher you see that Jesus see Jesus was testing him don't you know I'm God don't you know I'm God manifesting the flesh amen and he didn't catch it and so what does he he takes his word I can leave that although he left sorrow he said I can leave that I I I I really appreciate my money I appreciate what God's blessed me with said there's no great ones Among Us everybody say no great ones ready no great ones there's only one great one and that's God we are brothers sisters I don't care if you're pastoring a church that's got five people in it one two okay that's I'm pretty close that most likely me that don't make you little really all the churches think so that makes you a brother Amen brother Jesse Hallelujah see if you're true to God's word don't care what or how how you don't get little God don't have little and big children he just has children they're all the same Hallelujah and what's his proof of this he said God himself come from the ivory palaces of Glory to become one of us now who's the big one church we didn't come from we didn't leave anywhere good we came from the mind of God but it's not like we were ruling Heaven the ruler of Heaven come down in a body like an under the sinful flesh right it could die it could suffer he suffered all the pain so he could deliver us who's the great one Among Us Jesus Christ is the great one Among Us now I know we talked about wanting to give flowers and roses remember brother Ben Rod did that brother McBride they want to give flower roses I just got to smile you know but I gotta always be careful this don't let people call you great because as soon as you think about it soon as you get that it's time for a spanking it's time for a chastening because it's God that did it it wasn't you or I that did anything brother Bram says this I love this quote influence 1963 oh boy brother Braham said I've heard he said every man is subject to mistakes if he's human he's subject to violations of God laws and he is subject to many things because Satan tempson and he's just a human being and if God ever lifted his hands off you or me he would fall he would fall that's all so see Church what is it we brother gives us the picture like job God has a hedge around us that's the reason we're doing good the reason we're doing good is because God have a hedge around us as soon as he takes that hedge away You're G to fall Hallelujah that's what brother man says God is protecting him God's protecting us he says this yes you just let God lift his hand off you one time and Watch What Happens remember that's what God did with Hezekiah at that moment God pulled himself God the Bible said God left Hezekiah to test him now you're going to see what you're like without my anointing now you're going to see what's like now you're going to see what's in your heart when you're not singing praising God or clapping or shouting or worshiping or preaching or something like that not going to see yourself for your who your flesh really is notice I said flesh because the real person I am is my soul right and he said I've heard people say oh Satan can't do that to to me he said yes you just let God lift his hand one time Watch What Happens he said I constantly plead God don't send him have mercy on me keep him away from me I need God's mercy we all need that Hallelujah brother was say Where's that devil let me go cast let me go do that Devil he's like oh God keep me protected amen now there's times when we cast out Devils yes we'll have no fear I've done that seven or eight times to whatever you know I don't know what that's like but I'm just saying the attitude we take isn't like I'm some great person I I could can do it all where's the devil at that's how some of these people act but see that's Pride but we got to be humble and say God constantly constantly plead Lord let your mercy rest upon my life hallelujah hallelujah I don't know how I'm going to finish this today so they have three days of pestilence verse 15 so the Lord set a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died the people from Dan even to beerseba 70,000 men that was verse 15 I want to show the picture here of beers Sheba Dan to beers Sheba that looks a little strange on M okay now it looks better so when God told the destroying Angel Go destroy the city the angel started destroying here with a pestilence something like a CO or a Spanish Flu something that instantly would kill you he started here he swoops all the way down to beerseba from Dan down to beerseba all the coast and he's making his way back up to Jerusalem he goes all the way down and he makes this big long trip he's coming up God sent that 70,000 people died in three days Church what does the three days remind you of three days of death and destruction what does it remind you of three days Jesus was in the grave Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights three awful days right weren't the now to to the human it to the Believers it was awful our Lord was crucified Lord was was crucified there was all this confusion uh the the the the disciples were scattered like sheep it was three awful days hallelujah but thank God at the morning of the third hallelujah thank God the morning of the third everything changed Hallelujah glory to God so here we see death death Death on for three days and then finally God brings a change Hallelujah verse 16 and when the angel stretch out his hand to destroy Jerusalem so he's been destroying he's been the Bible said he had a sword he'd go down and he'd do a sword and then the pestilence would be released he'd go to this place but when he comes to Jerusalem he lifts his sword and the Lord said stop it is enough hallelujah it's enough all the sin of their Idols all the sin of David's Pride that's enough Hallelujah they've learned their lesson they've been spanked they've been chastened they know to fear me again hallelujah praise God church God knows when it's enough for us amen sometimes you think oh God how could it get any worse how could it be because God knows what's enough and you got to trust God and the church said God will not give you too much amen God knows exactly that mount where it's just enough suffering to get you back on track and I'll say like this to wake us up amen hallelujah to break off the matter of our eyes so we can see things plain again and the church said glory to God Amen and the Lord repented that means he was moved to compassion it doesn't mean oh I'm sorry no it means he was moved to compassion see the Judgment went for three days and then he moved with the compassion of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it it's enough stay now thine hand the angel Lord was by the threshing place of Arona the jebusite and David spake on the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and said Lo I've sinned and I've done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand I pray thee be against me and against my father's house here you have David acting like Christ David interceding David feeling for the people praise God just like Moses amen Moses and Aaron stood in the gap for the people praise God that's what we should do we should stand the gap for others praise God hallelujah now notice look David even says he said he said what have they done David didn't even know all their idolatry he was so busy in the work of the Lord see Church you don't know all the people's sins in the church David didn't even know David didn't think they did anything wrong but God's like I'm angry with them they've got Idols in their life but see you see David's pure Compassionate Heart he's like oh God don't put it on them it's me he didn't even know about the sins of the people but he was still praying for people so if God put someone in Your Heart Church let's pray for them because you don't know what they've gone through right you don't know what they're battling you don't know what they're struggling but God knows what it is hallelujah and God will put that person on your heart so you'll pray for them you don't know nothing about their problems you know nothing about the idolatry or any any shortcomings but God knows it all Hallelujah God wants some hearts like David to pray for those people that's right amen glory what have they done he says Verse 18 and Gad came to that day to David and said to him go up rear up the altar of the Lord in the thr in for of Aruna the jebusite so David Gets thus sayeth the Lord here's how you stop the pestilence right this is the way he's going to stop the pestilence right God said that's enough and now this is enough and now this is what you do when it's enough now you go make a sacrifice now you go make an offering unto God now Church how many remember our offering is is the thanks of our lips the Bible says the Praises from our lips yes it can be ties and offerings or whatever gifts to widows whatever you want whatever you feel led to do that's a sacrifice but the the major sacrifice we need is a confession we need the calves of our lips and say Lord I'm I'm returning forgive me of my sin Hallelujah like David just we just saw with David he said I I'm the one that sinned I've done foolishly Hallelujah and and the prophet comes and says in the name thus say the Lord David go up now and rear up an altar the Lord in the threshing for of a rune of the jebusite now you know what a threshing for right threshing floor is like a high place where they bring all the wheat or The Barley right and they got this big winnowing fork remember that fork they got you know you've probably seen them on the pictures there with the farmers from America in the old days they had to separate the seed from from the stem and so they you know they go up on a high place where the wind was blowing they put this all on a pile and theyd throw it up they just keep throwing it up again and again right and the wind would come by it'll blow away all the chaff they kept doing it again and again the wind would blow away all the chaff and all you'd have left is seed that's what God does to us amen amen God throws up our lives and let the wind of the Holy Spirit drive away the chaff amen all that's left is seed word amen all that's left is the word of God in our lives amen The Winds of Change right The Winds of the Spirit come in and blow out all of our fleshly things all the extra things that aren't valuable amen hallelujah right the Cha's not valuable part of the the harvest the seeds the valuable part the seed is the word of God hallelujah that's right so this was a threshing floor of araa the jebusite now remember we'll get to it here in just a little bit and David according to the saying of GAD went up as the Lord command so see it was thus sayith the Lord I'm stopping the plague now it's time for sacrifice Hallelujah see church sometimes it's coming to church is a big sacrifice sometimes isn't it sometimes sometimes singing is a big sacrifice you don't feel like singing sometimes witnessing is a big sacrifice sometimes tithes and offerings are a big sacrifice right God still says bring me a sacrifice Hallelujah recognize your sin and come present a sacrifice before me I'm stopping the pestilence I Want You To Worship amen I Want You To Worship me he says worship me David amen you've sinned you've been in Pride you haven't worshiped me there the people been in Idols you guys need to come worship together get your eyes back on me be devoted to me show me the love Hallelujah the Bible said the Bible says kiss the son lest he be angry Hallelujah God wants us to praise him and worship him oh church if you could just do that today and say praise the Lord I love you Jesus amen that's what God wants you to do Give Him worship tell him you love him he wants you to give him glory today Hallelujah but some people can't because of sins in their lives right that's what God wants when you've returned you're bringing back a pure sacrifice you're bringing a fire right the the consuming fires the cleansing fires of the Holy Spirit you're bringing us the fire of the Holy Spirit Back and You're making yourself a sacrifice a Living Sacrifice unto God hallelujah God moves with compassion God says through the prophet go tell him build Hallelujah build an altar now we see it verse 20 and arua looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and aranu went out and bowed himself before the King on the face of the ground and Aruna said wherefore is my Lord the king come to his servant and David said to buy the threshing for thee to build an altar of the Lord that the plague may be stayed from the people see church if we want the plague to be stopped we got to return and worship God can I say like this we've given other things worship instead of what we what worship we should be given to God sorry we're giving things too much time too much attention too much praise too much affection we're giving those things too much time we got to give God the time Hallelujah that will stop the plague see that see how it ties perfectly together this plague will stop this this awful destruction will stop when worship returns when we turn to worship ah I will heal your backslidings no wonder this is all tied together it's all the Holy Spirit the word of God verse 22 and Aruna said unto David let my Lord the king Take and offer up what seeth good unto them behold here be oxin for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of oxin for wood all these things did Aruna as a king give unto the king and Aruna said to the king the Lord thy God accept the now look he's really buttering up here he's saying David look I mean you you need to sacrifice I got everything you need to sacrifice the Lord's a provided this another prideful Temptation there it is right there another prideful Temptation sacrifice something that belongs to somebody else uh wait didn't David already do that he took another man's wife he'd already he'd already taken somebody else's sacrifice and the church said he'd already taken somebody else's lamb so see the see the enemy again trying to get in there oh just just just give a sacrifice it won't cost you nothing see church it's so easy when someone gives you some extra money and then all y'all can tithe an offering off that but what about yours right Hallelujah Arun is trying to like say hey you don't have to do a big sacrifice you don't have to sacrifice anything else let me give this sacrifice for you what does David say does David take his offer no David learned the same thing Abraham learned Hallelujah God's not going to receive a sacrifice unless it cost me something Hallelujah God's not going to receive it if I don't give it and it actually causes me to lose something Hallelujah verse 24 and the King said unto Aruna nay but I will surely buy of thee at a price neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing see that's when that's when God will accept your offering when it cost you something brother R said sometimes it'll cost you people will mock and make fun of you he said if you speak in tongues or if you dance in the Holy Spirit or you make a fool of yourself or you act act like you're praising God that there's a cost to that Hallelujah and God wants you to give a sacrifice that cost you something Hallelujah I've cared I stopped caring a long time ago what people think about me praise God right because what what are they going they're going to come into my life out of my life and it doesn't matter but who stays in my life Jesus Jus stays in my life amen he's the one I'm trying to please amen be careful people that flatter you the Bible said flattering words worketh ruin right Hallelujah don't never think you're great don't ever think that brother Braham says pride is such a cursed thing but see a sacrifice has to cost you something so David brought bought the threshing floor of the oxen for 50 shekels of silver and David built there an altar unto the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the Lord was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed for Israel remember Church the burnt offering was the most sacred offering right with all the other offerings you out you sacrifice if you if you're rich enough to have an animal you would actually get to eat some of that with a peace offering right all the fat would be go to go to God right but then some of the meat would go to the priest and you would have some of it too but with the burnt offerings it was a total sacrifice nobody got any of this except God got it amen hallelujah in other words God gets all this Hallelujah and that's what God gave or that's what David gave to God now Church what does this tell us cam preached this years ago to us and then I preach a series on it if you go to 2 Chronicles 3:1 and 2 Solon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem on Mount Mariah where the Lord had appeared to his father David at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite and he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his Reign Hallelujah so David bought this mountain Mariah the Lord said go take that mountain oh and you've got to purchase it David Hallelujah you're a prophet you're a priest brother Jose you're a king Hallelujah David the prophet priest king and God said you go buy that that man will want to sell it to you that's how you know God's in it amen he'll say yes I want I'll sell it to you amen hallelujah he said you go buy that David you purchase it and then you worship there you get burnt sacrifice and offerings there hallelujah amen David paid the full price just like Abraham paid the full price Hallelujah David would not take this land Hallelujah except he paid the full price he learned his lesson from UAH and basba I'm not going to take something that doesn't belong to me is that right so what is the location the location of this threshing floor is Mariah Allelujah and so this plague was only stayed when a burnt sacrifice was placed upon this hill Hallelujah everybody know what I'm saying here by God's grace this the whole city of jerus M would be destroyed unless there was a total burnt sacrifice anybody see where I'm going the whole world would be destroyed by the pestilence all of God's people would have been destroyed by all the pestilences except David purchased this hill with his own sacrifice with blood paying the full price it's a perfect type of Jesus Christ amen the pestilence of sin all of our sins would have destroyed us except David Jesus Christ paid the full price poured out his blood as a burnt sacrifice he didn't he didn't let the devil give it to him early right he said he said I rebuke you get behind me devil but he went to the cross and he gave his life as a burnt offering he purchased the hill and the plague of our sins has been stayed hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen glory to God Amen Hallelujah church we need a sacrifice we needed a sacrifice or else this whole body whole church would be destroyed by the pestilence of sin Hallelujah calvary's purchase ended the Judgment against the people of God hallelujah church this was just one in a long line of types of the cross the lambskins in Genesis 3:21 was a prefigure of Jesus being sacrificed and were clothed in his righteousness am Adam and Eve were walking around in the clothes of their sacri that's what we can say today I'm walking Paul said put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh Hallelujah we walk around with the righteousness of Jesus Christ not our own but it's our sacrifice Hallelujah let me go through this list here briefly I can't stop now praise God Abel's sacrifice that was accepted by the fire of God that was a type of Jesus Christ Jehovah Gyra Genesis 22:2 God told Abraham go up and church you know know this a that when he went up God said go up to mount Mariah that's Mount Mariah this is where Isaac was almost sacrificed Hallelujah the same place God loves that place amen God loves that Temple Mount that's the city of the great king Hallelujah God told Abraham go up there and Abraham was just about to kill uh the Seed of Abraham but then God said stop Jehovah Gyra I'm providing myself a sacrifice amen so the Seed of Abraham can be forgiven can be saved you and I are saved because Jehovah Gyra provided a sacrifice same Hill hallelujah hallelujah remember God met MDC in the southern part of Jerusalem somewhere God met MDC there in that City oh we're going to sing the great is the Lord and greatly to be praised get ready to we're going to sing that pretty soon here by God's grace Joseph with the but in the baker in the prison was a prefigure of the cross of Jesus Christ The Brass serpent the serpent was already judged sin was already judged and all you have to do is look and live it was in a cross all we have to do is look and live to the cross of Jesus Christ and he'll heal us hallelujah we have to look we have to look we have to get our eyes off the things of the world the cares of the world our guilt our shame our sin our iniquity we got to look and live at Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Passover Lamb was sacrifice so they could leave Egypt and the blood was applied as a token praise God and the blood I always love it brother Brooks preach the blood of the Lamb he called it the mighty lamb a lamb brought two million people out of Egypt praise God and if a natural lamb can do that what about a spiritual lamb Hallelujah can bring you out of your Egyptian out of your sin nature God's spirit can do that the blood of God's lamb does that Hallelujah the scapegoat on the day of atonement there was two goats one goat was let free he took sin away all of our sins were placed upon the scapegoat that represented Jesus church Haven he took your sins all away praise God brother Jose he walked and as a scapegoat he took all your sins away it's as far as the East is from the West praise God but don't forget there's another goat sister Caris amen and that goat had its sins on us and that goat died the goat died for our sins and then that blood allowed the high priest to go into the Hest of Hol and Not only was Aaron forgiven that day his family was forgiven each tribe was forgiven every single member boy girl father son everybody daughter sister all sins of Israel were forgiven in one day Hallelujah that's the type of Jesus Christ amen paid for the sins of the whole world Hallelujah Moses smoked the Rock that Rock was Christ glory amen and out of that rock flowed water Now history says brother he struck it one way he struck it like this and then history says he struck it like that that's what I read this morning the Hebrew the Hebrew writer said he struck it like that didn't come out so he went bam he made a cross and when he made that cross water came out just like on the cross they stuck the spear and and water and blood poured out it showed out the it showed the love of God the refreshing Waters of Life come forth from the cross of Jesus Christ Hallelujah one time Moses was in a battle with the amikit and they were getting whipped and God said go up there and stand put your arms out like this and as long as you're standing like a cross you'll get the victory as long as the people can look up and say oh there's a man on the cross for me as as long as I can see that I'll get the victory the same is true today amen we look to the Cross we look and see Jesus High lifted up he's the author and finisher of our faith the cross gives us the victory praise God oh my w Hallelujah and then Jacob say I'm going to bless Ephraim and Manasseh he said let me put the hand on on the Elder the Elder was over here but the Holy Spirit took his hand Andross oh you're not blessing Manasseh you're blessing Ephraim he said Dad you've crossed your arms yes son I know it's not me it's the Lord and this shows the blessing is going to come on the younger through the cross the blessing will come on the Gentiles through the cross of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen foreshadowed again and again and again all down through history praise God remember in the days of Joshua now this this is not this days of Solomon but in the days of Joshua the jebusites still had control of Mount Mariah so what did joab do joab went down through the spring he crawled down here through the spring crawled up and they went up there and they got the victory in the city they only got there through the gutters or the secret paths we're only going to defeat death by the secret works of God a secret brother man said a a secret hidden life a hidden life only by the baptism of the Holy Ghost are we going to defeat the greatest enemy there ever was death Hallelujah for hundreds of years nobody could defeat this it took the secret prayer the secret arms the secret fasting it took something secret it took a hidden path amen a hidden a hidden way to defeat the enemy it's not so much how we act here it's how we act in our homes it's how we act on the job are we hiding away are we doing the things God told us to do how many want to do that by God's grace I'm closing with this remember the first time that that that Mariah Mountain was mentioned was Genesis with me with mzc God met Abraham at Mariah in 1913 BC 41 years later Abraham come back he remembered this is the Mountain of God no wonder he went up there brother he knew God had met him there before amen hallelujah God met me here before and remember he said he had a revelation he said I and the land are going to go back and we are going to come back he already had a a revelation of Resurrection Hallelujah the same place where Jesus would be crucified amen Joshua fast forward some 469 years Joshua could not conquer Mariah because of the jebusites Hallelujah 400 years later nearly David's men finally conquer Mariah and that's when David danced David danced when mzc came back into the city Hallelujah but it wasn't in a body it was in an ark praise God that's why he was dancing the word was re start amen mnik is back in his City amen God's in the church God's in my life amen it's revival time God's here hallelujah no wonder he danced amen it had been uh 865 years since he was back in the his own City praise God 30 years later is when what we read today 30 years later is when he finally buys that Temple Mount and he makes a sacrifice a burnt offering I'm buying this to honor the Lord then some 15 years later Pon says now I'm going to build a house of worship on here I'm turning this threshing floor into a house of worship and every time David or even Solomon came back to this place they could have said this this is the place where God had mercy on me and God spared wrath on the church amen think about that every time remember he went from Dan down to beerseba he's coming up to kill everybody but God said David if you go sacrifice I'll stop right there every time every time we should come to church we should be thankful Lord Lord this is the place where I come if it wasn't for the sacrifice of Jesus Christ you would have we would have all judgment on me this this because the sacrifice of Jesus Christ my life has been spared Hallelujah and every time they would go there they would know this is the place where God chose to have Mercy on us and this is where we can bring our sacrifices unto God oh glory amen it was hard to contain it all this service you know Hallelujah 15 years later he builds it and then Jesus Christ 1,940 years after mezc Jesus Christ here was where Mount Mariah Jesus Christ had to suffer without the gate so down the hill you had to go they had to go down the hill and he had to die without the gate right there right next right on Mount Mariah Jesus Christ crucified in the same place where Jehovah Gyra provided a lamb the same place where mzc met Abraham the same place where David got the mighty Victory the same place where Solomon built the temple God says I'm claiming this for myself I'm forgiving my people my people will be forgiven of all sins there will be no pestilence upon the people of God let's stand to our feet Hallelujah musicians can come Hallelujah let's play great is the Lord and greatly to be praised how we thank God for the word today oh my what a blessing praise God you've been very patient today I appreciate that Saints I always

be so grateful that God has stayed the plague from his people there's no plague on you Church how many can say Amen to that amen the plague of your sin it's it stopped it's all taken care of by the sacrifice of David the whole nation could say say praise God we're coming to worship here because we remember what you did for me we remember what you did for us when the burnt sacrifice was given and Jesus Christ the Bible said he was given as a burnt offering unto the Lord he gave all of himself that he might forgive each and every person all the sins of the world were placed upon him he was made our sin that we might be made what church his righteousness Hallelujah let's pray church if there's anything you're battling you know ID doy or anything Pride or anything like we talked about that
