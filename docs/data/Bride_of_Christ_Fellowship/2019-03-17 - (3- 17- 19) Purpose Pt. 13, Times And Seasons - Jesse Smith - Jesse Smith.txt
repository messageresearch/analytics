read everybody the name of Lord Jesus Christ couldn't see the Saints this morning how's your trip sister Karen was it pretty successful Aaron said he was running little late so hopefully we'll see him and you'll see bang bang said they were sick last week you sure missed them last week trust all the saints I heard from Wendy but hopefully you see Wendy soon by the grace of Lord I like to look at times and seasons again and in 1st Kings 17 verse 1 like to start therefore our text from the word of the Lord how many believe this is thus saith the Lord to you praise God amen I believe that it's God's will for you and I for skiing 17 1 2 7 so let's look at this little type here and of course the Prophet preached this message spiritual food in due season 1965 so I'm holding some quotes from that just a wonderful message it was the evening message he had preached anointed ones at the end times in the morning and then in the evening he preached the sort of message on spiritual food and due season and typing it out to today and how we're in need of the food of God today praise the Lord we need a special food today aren't you glad for the food of God amen every time we open up this Bible God is speaking to us with this food for each day and it's fresh every day praise God 1st Kings 17 verse 1 and Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead sat under a hab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor rain these three years but according to my word and the word Lord came unto him saying get the hence and turn the eastward and hide thyself by the brook earth that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shall drink of the brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook let's read verse 7 together one two three and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land amen let's have a word of Prayer if ever need on your heart just making known unto the Lord here as we pray Heavenly Father were grateful again to take you this one day to Time Lord or we know this is a marathon Lord you told us to lay aside any sin that easily besets us any weight that would hinder our race Lord he told us to lay it aside father we do that now Lord help everyone that's that's listening to do that now Lord God that we lay aside anything hindering our running speed in our course Lord and father we just ask Lord God you take this word and break it to our hearts Lord God help us to see this spiritual food Lord as you command in the Ravens Lord to feed Elijah Lord we know that the Holy Spirit is command and defeat us today and we're grateful for that Lord got it and father we ask o God that we'd be able to receive the and Lord be able to eat of it Lord and may it Lord become one with our being Lord God but in other words may we live your word for today father may have feed our hungry souls we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you to be in see to praise the Lord well I did want to also say happy birthday again to the March birthday people I know I missed a couple here so bang and SIA they're still not here okay hey bruh and God bless you Sarah good to see you I told everybody about that little testimony about your uncle so thankful for that we missed Karen and Brenda's birthday where Brenda's was yesterday and then Lilly's coming up on the 19th and Wendy on the 27th let's give the birthday people around flowers god bless you Lord grant you another year of wonderful faithful service to his great name so we appreciate everybody and birthdays are a nice time to reflect reflect on the great blessings of the year not always nice to come those numbers but but is a real blessing to see God's mercy for another year amen and also you know the world is celebrating st. Patrick's Day this was course the day he died but he was a real Saint we know Pratt Patrick was a real Saint each year I get to show a video in the classroom and and it shows how God he heard the call of God after after he was taken as a slave to Ireland and was a shepherd there and I was ready reading an article about him yesterday in his journal he said as a shepherd as a slave he was he was very peaceful and he said that time was the time he got to talk and learn to pray to God and he said he prayed all day with this she said he prayed all night with the sheep then he heard the call of God to go back and so we went back to Rome and saw in a bad condition he devoted his life to serving the Lord and then the church there in Rome sent him to Ireland where he spent 20 as a missionary so we know he was a Roman Catholic we know that he's a real Saint that's why they called him Saint so you know not really like a holiday for us but it is nice to remember great Saints like that that adored of their life to the Lord and how many one devote your life to all your life to the Lord praise God that you're a saint and we know you don't have to be dead to be a saint you can be a living Saint so thank God that we're living Saints today so let's look at part thirteen here of this times and seasons and trust be a blessing to you by the grace of the Lord I've ever really been enjoying this little series here Lydia I do have quote to you if you'd like to share them by God's grace so we read our text and I like to I actually forgotten the order of these notes I'm actually going to start with a little different text so if you have your Bibles I believe it's in Daniel chapter 7 let's turn there for a moment and then we'll look at the next one Elijah so I guess I get had these a little bit out of order so let's go to Daniel 7 and I was able to get through all 150 of those quotes where brother Branham talked about times in seasons so I'm finished with that study so I'm very thankful to find the completion of that and all that seemed worth Graham said about that times and seasons so Daniel chapter 7 now the chapter begins with a look at the beast there's four beasts and we know them we know them as the the times of the Gentiles and the Bible said that their lives would be prolonged for a season at a time and so let's look at a few scriptures here and we'll be able to go through these and kind of review these I think in 2017 I preached a little series on the whole book of Daniel so this is a little bit of review so I'm in Daniel 8 no wonder I couldn't find it there Daniel 7 here we go yeah Daniel 7 and look at verse 7 we'll start to over 7 so in verses 1 and 1/2 3 we have the beast and then verse 4 is nebuchadnezzar babylon verse 2 is Medes and Persians as the bear Nebuchadnezzar was the lion sorry and then verse 6 is Alexander the Great and the Grecians like an under leopard and then in verse seven and I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and had great iron teeth notice that iron teeth everywhere this beast goes it's crushing and it's it's it's smashing out real Christian life right it's trying to smash out any desire for anyone to have a real walk with Jesus Christ trying to smash it up it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before and it had ten horns which we know are the ten dictators spoken of in revelation 17 the future dictators here that will unite with the harlot verse eight and I considered the horns and the behold there came up among them another little horn that's the Antichrist before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things all right now verse 9 and I beheld till the thrones were cast down in the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool does that remind you Revelation chapter 1 Jesus Christ with hair like wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire ah what a throne and a fiery stream issued and came forth from a form thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were open I was kind of expecting to hear a little shot of Amen there because those those thousand thousands were you and I brother man said who ministers to the husband but the wife Gouri seems like it was a little tired today so maybe Lord will help us to wake up a little bit yeah what was that daylight savings catching up with you maybe maybe all we're sick this week may God grant you say Amen so see judgment so this is judgment so we're fast forward to the judgment there the the judge since the Ancient of Days Jesus Christ with white hair and thousands ministered to him that's got to be his life and then thousands stambha form as well probably the Jews maybe or maybe it's the angels or maybe it's maybe it's all those being judged verse 11 and I'd be happy because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake I beheld even till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame all right verse 12 as considering the Beast they had their dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time so see the Beast here were all done away with right we know Babylon was done away with by the Medes and Persians that was in the lifetime of Daniel but you know Medes and Persians last a lot longer and weren't done away with till later when Alexander fell and then the Rome in the Roman Empire lasted about fifth century AD and then that fell it was wounded which had a wound like unto death but the Bible said that she got a got a new lease on life and that was through the the holy or the unholy Roman Empire and so those other beasts were to play with but here the Bible says that this little horn would had to be dealt with and of course that's the Antichrist and so the Bible describes that season in time this is quite a time right this is a quite a long length of time that this beast rules here so this beast was in Rome the Roman Empire now in the Holy Roman Empire it's been about 2,000 years for this season so sometimes season or short remember Wednesday night so robear said you could have a season of Prayer after a service so sometimes season are really short 10 minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes sometimes seasons can be 2000 years so we see that from the scripture remember that was the Ancient of Days which was Christ a touch this is quite let me just say this is the most deepest Godhead scripture I've ever read as Daniel 7 I think maybe I've shared this before I don't know but here we is we see in verse 9 the Ancient of Days sits and he's likened to a man right he's got a garment and he's got hair like wool and then it's quite shocking to me because one like the Son of Man comes and stands before the Ancient of Days now this is where Trinitarians will say it's two persons now to me how it's saying there is no such thing as two persons okay so to me what has happened is that either this could be one of two things either the Ancient of Days could have been there and this could have been speaking about a time in the future or it could have happened that God had God had a theophany that looked like Christ there but then when Jesus's body came there maybe that's theophany change into a pillar of fire maybe it was just a glowing light or something like that but one thing we know for sure God never said I'm two persons so just so you know Trinitarians will use this verse 9 Daniel 7 9 and 13 because they make it look like to one person come stands in front of another now we know that's not scriptural in fact that's what the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith saw he said God it has two personages he said when when God met him to tell him to write the Book of Mormon he said he saw two personages he said he saw an old man and he saw Jesus the son well he probably got it from a false interpretation of the scripture because you'll never see two persons but bromium said what happened was that when Jesus came and took the book out of the right hand of the right hand was just symbolic but brother Branham said all that happened was that the supernatural God changed his mask and he went from a light to being a praise the Lord so he just changes form so here's what I believe happened I believe the Ancient of Days were sitting there and then when the body of Christ came that I believe he just must have transformed back into or changes mass back into a pillar of fire that's what I believe but I could be wrong but notice what it says here the beasts had their lives prolonged for a season and a time and the Bible said there as we read in verse 14 let me read it again so I haven't read that yet no ya verse 13 is when I saw in the night visions and one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him so that's where they would say verse 13 there that's where they would say that it's two personages but the Bible never says that amen so he cannot add to the word although it's mysterious we cannot add to the Word of God and in verse 14 and there was given him Dominion and glory the speaking of Christ and the kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed a man Lori thank God for that amen there's coming a kingdom and it's a thousand-year Kingdom praise God and it shall now pass away and all nations the Bible said the Bible said all nations will pay tithes and offerings into this great Kingdom price of the heart and the Bible said all nations will come to worship before Jerusalem during this millennial reign and the Bible said also this is something I learned this morning read the scripture the Bible said also that they'll keep the Sabbath amen God will make this entire world during the Millennium keep the Sabbath amen so it's like God went from one day a physical day to a spiritual day and then he goes back to a physical day again which is interesting amen they'll even have to force to keep the Sabbath now thankfully for us we get to keep most Sabbath's Sundays our Sabbath praise the Lord but also the baptism of Holy Ghost is the real Sabbat today because that's the rest Isaiah said this is the rest with stammering lips and another tongue when I speak to this people amen that's the rest I want you to have is the rest from your sins and rest in the power of God amen so I feel sorry for people that they only get the rest on Saturday my I get the rest Sunday and every other day I get the rest from that sinful nature and I get to live with the divine nature of Jesus Christ amen that's a pretty good elbow there hopefully my elbows okay thank you lord praise the Lord now program tells us this in Revelation 14 he said the Beast was wounded unto death but lived again is Imperial pagan Rome that fell to the onslaught of the barbarians and thereby lost her temporal power but she regained it in papal Rome you see it the nation that ruled by crushing all and which became the strongest Empire ever known was finally wounded to death her power was gone physically as controlled by armies etc but under Constantine she came back to life for papal Rome has infiltrated the whole world and her power is absolute so just like amp the Roman Empire would go into a city and divide the city in conquered so does the the Roman Catholic Church today they'll take their false doctrines and though though go into two churches right as we know people the message have seen this they'll send in Jesuits like our brother down in North Carolina they sent Jesuits into his church and and tried to become good friends then tried to divide the church and the Holy Spirit picked it up and and called it out and thank God that the Holy Spirit is the discerner of the thoughts and tents of our hearts amen to be able to CERN those evil thoughts intents of our hearts but also they go into families because mother have said in in Daniel that the feet were a mixture of iron and clay and that's how Rome conquers out people that's our Rome crushes people's faith Satan will trick believers into marrying someone who's not a believer and then mother Ram says when you have two people either one's gonna make the other one like that one like Christ or the other weak one's gonna pull the other strong one down he says gonna be one of the other that's why if you're the believer the Bible said you're you gotta live sanctified in your home the Bible said your life sanctifies the life of the one who doesn't believe amen now that is sanctifies the children praise God so if you're the real believer you got to be strong hallelujah you got to cling to God's Word you got to be faithful hallelujah you got to be a soldier in the army of God but that's how brother banana said Daniel saw role would conquer so today it doesn't have to be well I didn't marry Catholic or alright things like that it can anyone who's it's not a real believer right and that person's life will eventually smash out and crush the person's spiritual life who really wants to serve God because they start compromising on the Word of God but how many no there's no compromise in the life of a Christian hey there's no compromise but this is how Satan with those iron Tina picture that a beast with iron teeth teeth and he wants to crush your spiritual life he wants to crush your Bible reading your prayer time right here was to crush your devotion to God's Word and he crushes it slowly because it's a beast right and if they don't you fast animals chew slowly we have a little cat now in the midst our house and that cat will bring up animal carcasses and just chew it slowly and so they the tutor get to see that all the time of crushing it you know get the mouse or whatever they got and that's what this beast does this is what the Roman Church does that spirit behind it that spirit of death help me know that's the horse rider today spiritual death it's slowly you know he's just not one service you you died during that service it's over the course of a month in a week and years and and it crushes the life so there's no more there's no more faith there's no more real confidence in God's Word and the people take on a denominational anointing rather than God's holy anointing can very see that by God's grace it was it was given life and prolonged for a time and sees in two thousand years papal Rome's been really influential since around no 325 AD with Emperor Constantine uniting church and state where we're familiar with that and so it slowly crushes with iron teeth people's spiritual lives we have to make sure Church were not being the ones crush we've got to make sure we're crushing Satan's Kingdom because the Bible said you can bruise Satan under your heel and then you and I are the crushers amen we're supposed to crush that almost temptations all the mind battles all over the US and all the pride we're supposed to crush that and cast it out of our lives amen either getting crushed or your question I'm not going to be crushed by Satan I'm gonna crush him because I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus now look he says the Roman Catholic Church uses Kings and merchants and in her deadly religious and financial strength she's governing as the goddess of this present age she's also the dragon that stood waiting to devour the manchild Hera tried to kill Lord Jesus and fail later Jesus was crucified by Roman soldiers but now it's caught up to the throne now remember in Daniel 7 remember the lion representing the Babylonians the bear means mem everybody remember this picture when I showed it a few years ago leopards ancient Greeks and here's the iron teeth now that doesn't really give much description to the beasts it just said I had iron teeth and horns but that's the Roman Church that's what you and I are fighting today not necessarily that color or something like that but we are fighting a beast how many can say amen to that you know a couple of Sunday nights ago I ended with the full armor of God that all have been encouragement for us to fight this thing have you ever had an animal you had to fight off your property right have you ever had that you got to fight and that's a mentality like we're not fighting the air or the wind we're fighting a spiritual power of death and the only way to defeat death is by life amen and so the life of God the Word of God must be in our mouths right we must have the shield of faith the sword of the way and we must realize we're fighting this immoral beasts and to know that we're more than conquerors and we can't overcome by the power of God remember when I said these four beasts combined into one beast in Revelation 13:1 210 and I'm not going to go through that I think the next chapter we're on in our series is chapter 13 so maybe I'll get to that Wednesday those four beasts combined into one beast now that's some other artist illustration of all those beasts together you know got your leopard got your bear got your line and got your you know got your horns there so they're all kind of mixed together and of course that's the I think that's the Vatican I'm not mistaken and that's a pretty good picture I like that picture it's a pretty good representation of what's happened as the dragon stands there at her seat in Rome and so remember Daniel 2 is just a different picture of this does ever understand that this is the same thing the four divisions here are the four beasts it's just another picture of it does ever understand that and then they're all combined into one in Revelation 13 thank God for the revelation of the Holy Spirit today now you know Daniels not a mystery to us revelation is not a mystery just why because God sent us Elijah to restore things amen and the whole purpose of Secrets that Deuteronomy 29:29 says the whole secret is that the children of God might know the word of God and do the commandments of God a mad that's why God want you to be his friend so you can do his word I don't know if you listened on Wednesday but I brought enough that little thought it was very important there's one thing required to recognize that beast and it's wisdom let me know that that's all this wisdom if you have wisdom you can know that Hills if you have wisdom you'll know the mark or the number 666 you'll need that and how do you get wisdom James said just ask God for wisdom wisdom is so easily accessible it's kind of like his self I'd say it cuz it's compared to that osteology all it takes to apply that broad is just plain common hyssop that's all you need to get wisdom to recognize this beast it's just a plain simple prayer well that ought enlighten us that most people are not saying sincere prayers if all nations are going to take the mark of this beast and if all the nominations are going to take the mark of the beast it shows you what selfish prayers they're praying you and I must pray selfless prayers we must that's why every player should either end or start with let thy will be done not my will amen there's very few people that are praying honest sincere prayers today because all is required for wisdom to recognize the false church and be part of the true church is a prayer for wisdom and most people won't even get that because they can't even pray in that powerful the real father is that struck me the other day I was right in need on the next chapter in the book like mine that means most people just pray for God give me food God give me money God give me a marriage God give me a house God give me a big car yeah they just pray for lustful things but you and I when I when we lift our voice to God you say God though you slay me will trust you let your will be done then I go through fiery trials all I want to do is sit on your throne with you amen hallelujah the Lord's give me the character of Jesus Christ hey hey hallelujah let me not love the world nor the things in the world let me love the world to come that heavenly kingdom that millennial reign the kingdom of the son of David amen ha ha very sort of feel good here amen thank the Lord but also it is there's just it's changing his master just like God changed his mast Satan does the same thing tries to imitate God he just changes his mask and now he's this combined beast with all the parts of the of the the animals and if a hides behind all these now I'm not stereotyping all the priests I know there's some good priests but a hides behind a white collared priest can I take your children in a caddy kiss them and many times they abuse them in catechism behind walls and at high it doesn't look like this is the Catholic and Lutheran priest look like that nope they sure don't look like that but they're all polished up with their white collar odd and deceptive it's so deceptive thank God that Jesus gave us I self you can rub on your eyes and now you can see behind all the false religion you can see behind that and you can give the person the word test to know what they believe about God's Word thank God for I south praise the Lord or Khun grease whatever if you remember remember that story that's that's good stuff you see but those are eyes it's got to be open to the things of God Paul said that to I your eyes be enlightened and illuminated to the things of God thank the Lord that's just another picture now remember Abraham broke it down and he even broke it down to a fifth part so one two three four but the fifth part was the catholicism and protestantism that's where we're at right now as we said they the Catholic Church tries to crush out people by intermarrying into their families and say oh we're all the same we're all the same we are we and that's where the processes are going to get caught up you know when they unite with the Roman Catholic Church they're going to unite on the fact where we at least we believe in the Trinity at least we believe God's three gods I mean three persons they're going to say at least we agree on that but see that proves that churches that won't rebuke you know the weather the iron Beast it proves that their dog of the mother glory but when we stare with the word and we withstand the iron bars and when we rebuke that iron beasts it proves were sons and daughters of Almighty God Amen that's right hallelujah see when they compromise and say oh we're all the same we can all worship together someday we it's okay that you you transform that bread and wine into the literal body and blood of Christ it's okay that you believe in the Trinity it's not okay now we're hoping some of those people get saved right but we don't United with that and we can't agree with that because it doesn't agree that's not God's understanding and there's a beast behind that trying to crush out people's spiritual lives I think we understand I love this picture I just had to show it because at the end of it Jesus Christ comes back and the Bible said he don't hit the head you don't hit the the breasts and arms you don't have the thighs he hits the feet amen he is that woman and the Protestant marriage he hits that and destroys it because that's where we're at in the timeline of God and the nice thing is we're right behind him he leads the way and God's own son will be the leading one but we're right behind the leading one on what horses amen that's the best kind of war you can show up to is where you just stand behind the leader the leaper does all the work and you just sit back and say thank the Lord that's the best kind of war I think I could ever be in is if Christ took scare took care of all the enemies for me praise God oh thank you Jesus not that we're not that we'd be afraid of fighting but that we're so thankful that our captain our general is so strong he don't need us to fight because he wants us to fight right now our time to fight is right now the church said this is our time to fight once you die or once you get raptured then there's no more prayer Me's right then there's no more church services there's no more witness and there's no more of that our time to fight is right now so let's put on the full armor of God hey man let's look for these times and seasons here happening around us now let's get yeah I just I didn't I didn't realize that was first so now let's get to our text here first Kings 17 one two seven now I could probably teach a whole sermon on this but Lord winning I just tried to hit the highlights here as I was looking at the sermon yesterday now I want to read a few things here now elijah during this time had a secret place that God had ordained him to go to that's the thing we want to see now just before we have the prayer line Elisha had a secret place provided by God himself now the church never provided it for him I love that the Jewish church never provided this place for the King never provided it for him he didn't provide himself even praise God but God provided a secret place for Elisha to be fed all the time during the drought where his food was provided day by day he didn't need to wonder what's going to happen tomorrow whether or one of the supplier to run out God said I commanded the Ravens and they'll feed you what a wonderful thing a type of our secret place in Christ hallelujah now church this is on another note this is the only time in scripture I've seen where a group of birds are used for good instead of bad remember we preach on that a few weeks ago remember all the birds that ate the butler's off the butler's basket and he died remember all the birds Abraham shooed away which represented the hymn casting out Devils and remember the birds came and ate up all the season Jesus said that was Satan snatching away this is the one time in the scripture I've found that Birds actually represent something good and I don't understand it I'll be honest I understand it but God used these birds to feed his prophet praise God when the world counts on all that's going on today that says the days of miracles has passed the great powers of God has been taken out of the churches they seem like it anymore they don't have nothing but a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal we know that to be the truth and a form of godliness in denying the power of their church most church members I know they believe in miracles how many would agree with me every friend I know except I think I've only met one or two Christians over my entire life that didn't believe in miracles 1 or 2 everybody else no matter whether it's Catholic or Lutheran or parent pet of course Pentecostals do they believe in miracles so it must have been a move that was more popular in mother Bram's day but see they won't believe in the miracle of God sending a prophet with a message with and that's the main part today is the message praise God the message is what brother M was talking was pointing us to the message they won't believe in that miracle no they will believe most of them won't believe in the miracle of wearing modest clothes maybe they believe in healing miracles and cancer being here to thank God leukemia is here which we agree thank God for that but they can't even accept the miracle of dressing modest according to 1st Timothy 2:9 in this sad church the pick-and-choose gospel they give out there they make the gospel buffet but the gospel is not a buffet it's a three-course meal justification sanctification it's that choose whatever you want and leave we're not leaving nothing behind amen if God gives me a meal I'm eating all of it because I know he knows I need to eat all of it amen well I don't want any st. vacations I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave that there I would select a to dress sexy I still like to do that I still like to take my shirt off as a man and try to show off how strong I am and wear short shorts when I go running or something like that I like everybody see what it's home person I am no God there's a new buffet style God said take all of it or none of it right Jesus then take up your cross and follow me hallelujah that's right now we realize that we're facing some of the greatest hours history's ever known because that beast is upon us it's trying to smash how every person right because it's going to be a worldwide mark of the beast that beast is smashing churches even today this morning that beast is chewing churches and trying to get them not to stand on God's Word did you see last week the leaders of the Mormon Church met in the Vatican with the Pope did you see that they've been separated for centuries it said and now they found common ground on the water baptism and father said Holy Ghost oh the leaders of the Mormon Church see he's little doubt there Luther some of the most outspoken against the Catholics you see wait we don't even realize something sometimes do we miss these things this is one of the greatest hours where the Beast has almost smashed every church he's almost chewed up and spit him out right hate to be that graphic but he's chewed up their church their zeal for God and spit it out where people have no backbone anymore there's no stand they don't even know what they believe it doesn't mean anything to him anymore they're not fighting against evil anymore but you and I have to fight the good fight of faith it's a fight now I try to do my fight with as much smiling as I possibly can well I disagree with you up at but this is what we believe but there's time where it does get a little intense he says it isn't exactly the war ahead with the bright shiny missile with a head on it that we should be afraid of it's the church's we should be afraid of now of course we know God does not give us a spirit of fear so that's not Rams not saying okay you and I need to be scared of churches now be scared of anyone who goes to a church it's not a message Church that's not what he's saying he's saying it's an hour we're living in we should watch but notice God made a way for Elijah to escape it and he's made a way for his believing children to escape it now the wrath and things that is to come so the words we must be aware we must watch and make sure that that denominational spirit of death doesn't try to smash out chew up our spiritual eyes and make us cold and complacent and weaken the faith that we stop fighting against these things we got to be strong and courageous amen and stay with the word of God in our head is that true my elbows feel a lot better thank you lord praise God I really gave that a good smash I thought I was gonna start seeing blood coming either thank the Lord one time Tim Myers was preaching up here he went like that and he hit this corner his fingers started to bleed and he just kept on preach that's right that's all I got suffering for Jesus thank God we whatever he got to suffer we just want to do God's will he said remember he went to his secret place by the plan of God by the call of God and the Word of God Elijah in his secret place by God's foreknowledge or plan and the call upon his life in the court of the word if that ain't the way we entered I don't know why we get so Berlin says just like Elijah was called by God to go someplace all private secret so have you and I been called to go there as well amen I'd say it's more than this church this church is a good place to start on your road to the brook of sheriff but this church is not exactly the book of chair but this church will point you to the brook of chair and that's heavenly places by the Holy Ghost in hice Jesus so but is it we can go there too we should know what it's like to be down there at the brook Cherith why sure do I don't know about you but I know what it feels like to be alone I don't know it feels like to have a drought where everyone around you just doesn't want to hear about God and no one wants to talk about God and no one feels like they've got any real urgency for God oh it's hard it's wilderness it's hot it's dry the world's dying but God promised to feed us twice a day amen morning and evening in that striking how in Moses day they had a morning and evening sacrifice and shouldn't you start today with prayer and feeding on the word and then shouldn't you end the day with prayer worship and singing and feeding on God's work shouldn't you do that I think that's a good idea don't you have you got any free time between that's a good time to do it too it is it's striking morning and evening those sacrifices those times of feeding on God's Word if Elijah had to be fed that way how much more do we got to be fed that way spiritually and notice before the job began Elijah went in this place of secret for his living a very type before the judgment starts to strike the earth the church has already called out the bride has already chosen and just waiting before judgment strikes already waiting eating the food of God enjoying the blessings of God any man as normal mind knows that were headed straight were right in the hour of judgment now notice we went in by the he went in by the plan of God the foreknowledge call of God and the Word of God and went in before the drop set in now we know that judgment is ready to strike and then brother Graham tells a story of 1964 when he through was what he throw in the air of the rock that's right I was gonna say dust but is rock he threw the rock in the air and he said thus saith the Lord judgment was struck at the west coast he said I went on a pray a little bit and I said his judgment striking the west coast look at her today look at what happened a few hours after that Alaska sunk almost and now the whole thing is going under we're entering in the judgment mercy has been spurned how many know that last year California had the worst fires in their history I mean know that and I had religious people emailing me say can't you see God's judgments is on California and I'm like yeah God's prophets said that about 50 years ago but the same way that said that wants to keep women preachers I said well you can't do that but see they can recognize they can look at it say guess the West Coast is going to be judged but can't discern all the Word of God can't eat all the Word of God oh thank God that we can eat all the Word of God thank God you don't spit that up and say well I could never do that or I could never believe that I don't want to eat God's Word if God laid his food in front of you you and I should be first to eat all of it ain't it true even though it's hard trust it it'll come out right it'll make you feel good it'll make you grow strong in God he'll keep you healthy that's for sure Devlin keep you healthy he said but thanks be to God we got hidden food spiritual food that we're living on the goodness and mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ in these days cookery vindicating himself among his people amen he said they went in Elijah went in before the Johnson in I was thinking sister Karen how many times have you heard of sister Karen a couple maybe a score 20 I appreciate don't you appreciate you faithful Saints like that when I preached that one on the astronauts and their CEO how it exploded she said we heard that preach two thirty years ago and she wasn't upset about it she was happy about it she's heard it and she believed it and listen church she stayed faithful to it amen that's all y'all want a testimony of faithfulness hallelujah you and I being faithful to the faithful one himself Amen the faithful witness hallelujah Haim it will never be as faithful as him but God help us to be as faithful as we can amen hey man let's just return to some of that faithfulness that he showed us he went right in before the judge drops it in thank God for being in before the judgement sets in now is the time of coming out and going in getting how those organizations getting into Christ are coming out and going in time for all true believers then he was gone and Satan there remember he never left that Brook until God called him and after was over he called him out there down the widow's house notice he called to this Widow and this Widow had not associated herself with the unbelievers nor taken the mark of the beast during the drought Amen so he called so Elijah called to sustain the woman the widow they just had one little cake one little thing she was holding on to and Elijah said give me that first for thus hit the Lord that bear will not go empty neither will the cruse run dry until the day that the Lord God sends rain upon the earth putting God first his word first so in the midst of a drought we learned that God will sustain us with to spiritual meals a day right and then when he sends it and then here we know God sustained his prophet by the woman putting God first right and we know that types us putting the message of putting the revelations of this day putting this force of our family above work a girl friends the word must be first above everything notice there was me on the Barrow every time he/she swen after meal there was meal in the barrel there was oil in the Cruze every time she went for why meal represented Christ than me offering the burgers had to be set just right to grind every one of them every bird of this meal exactly the same showing that he's the same yesterday today in forever that was the word the bread of life following the message to vindicate the word oh thank God every time church we dig down in this right every time we dig down this Bible there's more food for us isn't there glory biblical numerology holiday spiritual food and new season the book of Revelation every time when we go Lord I need to hear from you God speak to me every time we dig back in there something comes out when we needed amen hallelujah church members can't say that I have a lot of friends of family that say the only reason they go to churches is for the music they've told me that my face many times or so their kids have a good Sunday school which that's good as long as they teach the Bible but what they're saying is that every time they reach down and the preacher tries to preach them he don't have nothing to reach from he can't get any meal they're barrels empty but we don't serve a God with the empty barrel we serve a God was a supernatural barrel then every time we have a need of the world we just got to go to the world and pull something out and there it is the food for our season amen thank the Lord amen at least that's what I experienced when I come to church I hope you can say Amen to that tooth absolutely thank the Lord that's so true so it is today friends so it is today that's the bread of life that that children eat on follows the message of God to sustain them during the time of the drought what if he stood not presents today so the thing about that what if he stood in our presence right now he would act and do just exactly like he done the days when he was in flesh on the earth the brightest part of the husband and the church is the same as Christ the works that I do shall you do also and is the word that done it he told us that the things that he would do that we would do also praise God so picture that if Jesus Christ was here today he would act the very same way he acted with his disciples not sure I believe this I think I hope you'll agree to he would act a little more different though with us because we're born again and in many of those stories his disciples weren't born again so thankfully hopefully Jesus wouldn't have to rebuke me I hope it wouldn't have the idea Lord would you just want to send fire and burn up all the Episcopalian churches or all the you know that's the class that John had right John had this spirit and Jesus said you don't know what spiritual so hopefully he'd act a little bit differently hopefully he'd get more done because we'd all be in harmony by the Holy Spirit but if you're wrong then you know Christ would correct - if you got the wrong attitude toward your wife or your husband you got the wrong attitude toward your parents you got the wrong attitude towards work then be assured Christ would correct to you because he corrected everybody came in contact with right the high priest his disciples Peter his mom his dad everybody Jesus was the word and the Lord always is corrective God my prayers this God just helped me to see when I'm wrong please help me to see when I'm wrong that I can be corrected I don't want to be a prideful soul that can never be corrected and think I know everything about everything God help us to be humble that we can be corrected by the word because remember he said if you want to learn for me you got to be meek and lowly of heart you got to be a meat Christian yes strong in faith strongly against that iron teeth be strong in that way but when it comes to learning and hearing from Christ we're gonna be meek and lowly all nothing Jesus just show me where I'm wrong correct me if I'm wrong I'm just such a sometimes I'm a failure if I if I want if I don't obey your commands I'm such a failure but with your spirit I'm an overcomer don't beat yourself up and no saying sends you long garsten no not at all but remember we must be meek and lowly to learn from God hope that gives the right balance there by God's grace now we notice here again let me set a timer here so I don't where you all out if the word is innocent has come to us as it did elijan that day it would be the same thing that he did he would feed on the secret things of God which is hid from the world Oh again it makes the message in the messenger as one the spiritual fruit is ready and it's the season now and each one of you can have this food if you wish it if you're willing to steal away from all the unbelief on this hour if you're ready to come into Christ and come into his promise been that beautiful you got to steal away in other words you have to leave any unbelief behind and you've got to gather and rally around faith in God's Word that's what church services often do right church services are supposed to preach faith buh-bam said ministers are to raise up your faith to believe all of God's promises program said to raise faith in Christ there's ministers that are is your faith in Christ and that's what I've been trying to this morning I hope by God's grace you can see that we're in a time of drought we're at a time when that iron teeth beast is smashing and crunching everyone almost everyone spiritual life who they don't they're not their prayers are not being heard they're all selfish prayers and we have a chance we have a very slim chance before the door closes to be the bride of Jesus Christ to prey on his prayers to be real sincere Christians and to humble ourselves and learn from the almighty one before he comes back and snatches his wife away from the devil before the tribulation starts all right I was a mouthful breaks God we have a small opportunity to be that bride to steal away from any unbelief once you desire that church God take all unbelief out of my heart in mind help me not to doubt and as we said on as we said on Wednesday I don't know if you heard about Amen but we kind of went over brother I'm speaking to the mountain I don't know if you heard it did you hear it okay I went over that with program said speak to the mountain he said the only way you can speak to this mountain is when God anoints you to have that kind of faith so brother Aaron said he used to think it was man doing it without the atonement or wonder was it can a man do that without being led by God but then he realized no the only way he can speak to a mountain is if the atonement anoints him or God spirit annoys him to speak God's Word he said I wouldn't preach that for years because I didn't understand it can a man speak anything and just speak whatever he wants and God will honor it no God will only honor what he anoints you to speak so that's the importance of being anointed and that's why it's good to be here because God likes to anoint his people here and then Mary amen this is where God anoints us raise up our faith feeds us strengthens us correct us there's so many benefits to being in the house of God hallelujah let's go to real quick back to Hebrews 10 see when you physically come to church I just want to rehearse that it's been on my heart lately Hebrews 10:25 physically coming to church remember it's like Mary and Martha Jesus says whatever you receive when you're sitting at the feet of Jesus it cannot be taken from you amen any revelation you receive at the feet of Jesus the devil cannot take it away from you that's one reason we gather at the feet of Jesus the other one here is there's lots of reasons but verse 2024 Hebrews 10:24 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works so we come to church we're supposed to look at other people and see how can we encourage them how can I help them how can i minister to them and if somebody looks down and say can I pray for you or if we find out somebody needs something we can try to help them out see we're supposed to look at each other and say Lord can you want me to help Jose or do me to help Lidia who do you want me to help it Lord let me help back we should come here and consider one another that we can provoke or inspire them to love God more and to do good works I hope that's what you get when you come to Bride of Christ fellowship I hope you feel people's love and I hope you walk out of here wanting to do good works and to love God more praise God if not you then get a little closer to each one of us right amen because I know that's what church does to me that's why I come to church right here to grow and love and to be inspired to do more for the kingdom of God you know God put it on our brothers heart lately uh - let me just share this okay God put it on brother Aaron's heart lately to ask about brother Jason now how many of em brother Jason when he become well I kept I reached out to him a few times hadn't heard from him and he encouraged me to reach out to him again so I did well I just heard from him this morning and he said well I want to give that big security guard guy a big bear hug he said he said thanks for being so concerned he got a job so thank God for that but working him seven days a week and he said make sure you tell that brother amen he said what a good song leader he is I can show you to you afterwards brother see that's just one example of when it used like when people are in the house of God they're missing out on love and inspiration because the Bible said when you gather you consider one another unto love provoke them to love and good works when I see a men being so faithfulness music ministry it makes me want to be fed more faithful to my preaching ministry and it's likewise right well I see bang is a faithful father like man lord help me I just want to be more faithful to my family that's true that's true I appreciate that brother bang I do it does I see our sisters stand on the faith a mix omits any opposition or divided houses and all these things when I see faith like that it makes you want to stand more for Christ amen it's inspiring we are inspirations to one another because it's God working through us verse 25 see not forsaking these somethings are of ourselves together see when when when people don't come to church they're abandoning the rest of the army I'll tell you it's hard to fight that iron teeth Beast all by yourself I don't even know what it's like so I don't I know you want to try and that's all by God's grace keeping me healthy I come to the house of God because something could happen I could miss I could be in the hospital thank God he's kept me protected I'm never willingly walked away from church since I heard this message never but see look not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together abandoning the army while they fight so when we come together church we're fighting we're fighting spiritual affairs you might not see it but I'm trying to kill off all these demon doubts amen how do you yeah I'm trying to fit off and cut away all these prideful spirits all these lustful spirits now sometimes I look like I'm physically doing it right I'm punching the pulpit and everything like this but in the spiritual the words that are coming out of my mouth but my words but God's words they're finding is demon powers here - all up you overkill and set us all free in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah this is an army here this is a lawyer we're fighting and when people don't come they're abandoning the fight and they're missing out on love and inspiration oh I'm so inspired how many times have I talked about sister Brenda's in the inspirational testimony how many times of Jose been healed and just when they got healed or when they tell us this morning it's just such inspiration my I could serve God the rest of my life it just gives you that inspiration god help me to be faithful help me to keep fighting the good fight of faith as the manner of some is but exhorting one another no that means just encouraging one another the word actually means encouragement so much the more as you see that Day approaching that's why I like to do to Sunday services and most of the year I do but there's times I gotta cancel see I want to gather more as I see that Day approaching don't you I'm gonna gather more and fulfill this scripture so that's just a little brief look so let me try to close here I you know give me a couple minutes I got a couple more minutes here is that helpful by God's grace that's this is so we're a spiritual worse getting spiritual food a new season here this morning so that we're that we don't get overcome and that we don't get can't say like this I know it's graphic but so we don't get eaten alive by this beast this fourth beast that's a mixture of all the other ones picture that beast I had up there a while ago would you like to invite that guy well if you're a Christian you do find him and you overcome by the sword of the word but in the natural you wouldn't want to find a line like that in the natural it remembers Hamas's in malachi for luke 1730 Saint John 14:12 the works that I do show you do also praise God and how many more scriptures of telling Joel 2:28 he says rather what he would do in the last days and how the prophets said that it be light in these last days how it would work and what it would do in all the scriptures pointing to these last days and that is Christ if you can hide away in that now in that secret place you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of God if you're sick there's healing there and notice they don't know when he called fire down from the heavens and so forth and improved his sending of God this prophet spirit notice in the word is when he was lying there done under the juniper tree and angel come down with that same kind of meal and baked some cakes and fed him and a little later on he put him to sleep again and woke him up and he had some more meal cakes baked there for him and he went in the strength of those cakes for forty days glory to God he's the same yesterday today and forever oh ha we love him spiritual food in its season so this is a story of God just feeding Elijah and all the hard times there's a big drought God will feed you by the brook and then during that time there's a widow's house God's gonna feed him there and then after he has a great victory and he runs scared for his life from Jezebel God's got food for him now is that encouraging even after the anointing left Elisha he just called fire down from heaven he ran away from Jezebel God still had food for him even though he wasn't anointed I say like this in the midst of your hardest trial God still has food for you praise God God didn't say you know what Elijah I'm done with you anointing is not on you you're not living the right way no food for you mercy God in fact no matter that God said send the angel with the softest wings and the softest hands and take Elijah some cakes hallelujah and feed him he's a tire Pope in other words God has compassion on his children when the go through the sorbs hallelujah and God wants you to know how much he loved you and he's gonna send you some food in the right season how we love him spiritual food in its season it's not meet to take the children's bread and give it to dogs Jesus said didn't Jesus say the same thing to the saira Phoenician woman he was sent to his own that's right and that's who he he would come he never went to the gentle house and now he visits the Gentiles in their time and is not meet in other words does not meet for God to give his word to the denomination's right it wasn't me to give the Jewish word Jesus word to Gentiles it was only me Jesus would give it to the Jews only go to my people lost house of the sheep of Israel now with the Gentiles it's not me to give them sorry is not fitting to give the meat to we'd say the mother harlot you say why is it that the message don't go out in these great big places these big Crusades like amongst the denominations how come my pastor brother Jesse doesn't get invited to the big conventions for Assemblies of God or United Pentecostal or the Lutheran Assembly how come how come brother cam doesn't get invited to the Catholic seminary convention to preach brother present is not their food it's not for them it's not the church so-called food it's the bride's food it's spiritual food in season it would make them sick to their stomach and doesn't a church it's too rich for them you can't do it but for the children it's bread it's life it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now let's send our fee gets into a prayer line I just want to show you what he calls spiritual food [Music] church I used to go to a lot of churches you did to proudly that they couldn't handle this kind of preaching couldn't handle it Karen's been visiting something lately they couldn't handle this preaching you know why it's not because it's not the right food it's the right food glory thank god this is - the trouble is it's too rich for them their taste buds haven't been trained to the glorious taste of God's work amen like your little children can't handle the spices and they can't handle vegetables of all things did brother ham say his message was a bunch of vegetables the great juicy see they're living on junk food only not healthy every day then whatever no the organic seed one of God amen of the skirt the real healthy food of God's Word is for you and I we can stomach it while they can't because you know most of them can't even handle milk lip meat of the word of God literally Church they have no spiritually spiritually they have spiritual IVs hooked up they can't even handle the meat of God's Word what do you mean what do you mean people can hang on them and do miracles and go to hell what do you mean brother Ram said that sermon right there was meet annoys ones the end time that's meat what do you mean my pastor is wrong even though that's a smoke and drink and strip our clothes and bathe out publicly in our underwear nude and yet we still have miracles what do you mean he's wrong preacher he is he is is that right Church they can't hit there spiritual Ivy they're just hanging on and this is this is why they crank up the music like that they're trying to get people under emotion just to have some supernatural thing happen so they can still feel like they're right with God because when the word comes they can't handle any of the real word very little the real word so god help us not to just want to have an IV and just barely get along spiritually God help us they eat the strong meat of the word and gross piercing grow strong so we can really fight off this beast power with the ayran teeth and crush it under the feet of God's bride a glory that we're not crushed but we crush Satan's Kingdom but Bram says we're getting too late now if we don't start the prayer line now so this bow our heads just a moment dear God food in due season spiritual food something that the world knows nothing of how we hear our Lord say that night or that day down there samara the same place that elijah walked up and said why the dew will not fall until I call for here Jesus stood there telling his disciples say master why don't you eat he said I have food that you know not of truly Lord his food was to do the will of God to see the works of God made manifest in his hour he was there to see that it was done I do nothing except my father shows me first what the father shows me that I do and father so it is today the church the true believer the body believers has access to food spiritual food that the nominals know nothing about the world knows nothing of this food father but your church your people the brand of your son loves it Amen let's just thank the Lord Kelly the bride loves the food of God the Word of God she loves it amen not ashamed of this kind of preaching I might be embarrassed like in my flesh if somebody said did you preach this tomorrow I might be ashamed after a while you get me in the right under the noid thing I'll say yeah I'm not ashamed of that that's God's Word when it kind of gets shaken out of that you know how you get surprised sometimes by the devil's attacks one side you know you have to get punch one time you're kind of stunned a little bit well lets you get back from that and kind of get your senses no the Bible does say this the bible does say that the bible does say that and know that we've got a prophet that said thus saith the lord to back it up the first punch might stun you tomorrow but just get back from it shake off yeah shake off the the dizziness and get back to fighting the good fight of faith that's what I've seen at least that that's that's how it is to me church the devil seems to punch me when I'm not looking for it when I go into a situation I'm ready to fight and they don't want to fight it seems like when I'm just maybe a minute busier in a hurry trying to get something done that's what Satan wants punch me catch me off-balance try to get me to compromise but thank God for the smelling salts of God's Word you know you give those boxers smells and sauce to kind of wake him up are they gone for the salty Christian life that we can live he said we have access to healing of our bodies when the doctors is failed we have access to this it's one of the foods of God so see now what is food food is a promise of God here in the Bible whether it's healing whether it's faith right whether it's wisdom financial help whatever whatever need you have it's one of God's food items he can give you that's right he said he gave his church and promised in the last stages but children and father help us to be believe me children for all things are possible to the believers granted dear Lord we ask in Jesus name Amen now he's in prayer line look what he says it was like I got two more quotes three well four he said how do you do it wasn't that I didn't reach for your hand to shake your hand then when you put your hand out I was noticing something it was a shadow real dark and black that's the reason I know I caught your hand I'd find it that way see but it's a cancer rubber band was going to shake his hand with any stall like a shadow he said that's cancer you believe that God is able to move it it's on your breast left side we went to go back to Carolina and praise the Lord so he discerned him right there two things he told me from Carolina is he got cancer on your left breast he said praise the Lord for being well don't you see what I mean let's pray he said dear God the name is Jesus Christ the one who's president now the children eating the bread of God may this child also enjoy the faith the bread of God that gives him now for his healing may he go and be well in Jesus name god bless you brother believe with all your heart so as a brother who had a breast cancer a brother and brother man praise God give him the food of God that will heal him which we know is by His stripes we are healed he sent His Word and it healed them but see not only was he getting bread of God everybody the church was getting the bread of God that they have need of praise God isn't this a wonderful time just look like in all sets down over the people maybe it was my ears or something like that but BAM he blows the microphone I was listened to yes he goes hmm see he felt the wind of the Holy Spirit just make a noise like like that see it's the children's Red Sea it's yours it's for you it isn't for me it's for you I'm very thankful at the right time I don't mean I'm well as far no it's the bread for me to when I'm in need of its bread for you it's encouragement to you that's not even sick it just brings our hearts up before God so encourages our hearts this is a exactly in season what he said he would do as it was in days of Sodom so she'll be in the coming and sent a man when a son of man will be revealed see and behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord he should restore the hearts of the people back to the father my brother won't you come up here why'd you play at a healing song on your heart maybe so church I don't know if you're sick this morning or not I don't know I'm just sharing you with you the direction the Holy Spirit with me but I want you and I to remember we must remember that this is the season for God to bring all of his word to pass and so whatever a child of God has need of the bread Jesus called healing the children's bread whatever you have need of whether it's more faith or whether it's wisdom a financial help whatever need of God has that bread that you can eat it today and you can benefit from the strength of God's Word I'm here thankful for God's bread this morning amen I'm so thankful for the bread of God I don't think I was thankful from it's hard to be thankful for that than anything else that we know we're not as Christians here trying to find a battle starved out like salted to his army right but we get there feast on the honey the honey you could say the bread of God any food that you need whether it's encouragement maybe it's a lifted heart unto God God my heart feels so far from you well you just draw me closer to your presence dear God or maybe it's healing whatever a piece of bread whatever type of you have need of
