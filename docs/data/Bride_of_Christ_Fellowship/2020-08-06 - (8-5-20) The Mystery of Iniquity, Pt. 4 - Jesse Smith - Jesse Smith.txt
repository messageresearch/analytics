here tonight by god's grace let's remember uh those in lebanon there was a big explosion i think last night and dozens were killed but let's remember the innocent there a lot of children a lot of people hurt there it's not far from israel we looked up on the map i wasn't real familiar with lebanon but it's not far from israel not far from damascus as paul was on the road to damascus let's remember those in beirut also there's a hurricane but amen let me know uh down south it's affecting south carolina so remember that there's a lot of saints in south carolina so i'm glad you said that let's remember the saints and all the people and then just the government a lot of things going on in the government just a lot of stuff going on there so let's just remember that we appreciate those requests brother anybody have anything on their heart they like uh remembered as well steven all right let's remember friends for salvation anyone else have a need i gotta have a little testimony i like to share real quick somebody sent me a nice message okay i got an email on monday i'm thankful for god uh just yeah i'm thankful for god for him showing this to me in my time of great trouble in my numerous trials he said your videos are my wake-up call and i cannot miss his calling and he said i can't thank you enough he said like every single video is directly speaking to my life so praise god just want to thank the lord for that you know as we know church i read those to encourage me to encourage you because you're a part of it i can't do these videos without your support um i do the reason i read those to encourage me because as we get closer and closer we know the pyramid teaching right it's scriptural few there be to find it fewer and fewer so when we see a nice testimony we just want to thank the lord for that i just want to encourage you keep sharing them uh you know we went to that graduation this weekend boy did it wear me out i'm still worn out six hours on the road and being home till midnight anyways my niece who's 18 she got to watch my testimony and her boyfriend did too so i got to talk to my brother a little bit about getting back to church i had two brothers about getting back to church and then we got to pray for my uncle he had an mri we won't get the results till friday but we got to pray and he was weeping and so we really felt the presence of lord there and uh just be encouraged you know we never know uh who we're impacting but brother ram said we will find out all the testimonies that came from our lives on that side we just see a few of them here but let's be encouraged that god is faithful god sees every work he rewards every work and we want to be we want to rule over sin now so we can rule over there amen and that's the real victory in our daily life ruling over sin how many believe that amen praise god so let's remember those in a word of prayer let's remember these uh innocent ones and these natural disasters no doubt

you god we sing your praises in the name of jesus we come we thank you lord god that you're our savior you saved us from sin how faithful you've been you've shown your power to deliver us from the

magnified in our midst in jesus christ's name the church said amen amen god bless you praise god let's turn to our our scripture here and also do the memory verse from brother stephen i do apologize again i just forgot he texted me on sunday i just that was one thing i forgot so let's uh read our scripture here the mystery of iniquity uh by god's grace why don't we uh start at where we're gonna pick up ephesians two we kind of ended there i'd like to pick up right there on ephesians two also we're making good progress on the book i'm almost done with um the late ocean church age and then i just want to do the seven seals uh i got almost one one half more chapters also this this uh sunday lord willing two services um if the baby comes that might change so i put a note there i need to at this point i haven't let simon know i have simon scheduled to come i think august 23rd but i need to have him ready to go in case the baby comes so i haven't let him know that so you know let's say the baby comes saturday night i'll sell amen play a tape okay that's the one time we will play a tape unless i can have simon ready to go so i just wrote that down i forgot to tell you i forgot to let simon know so if the baby does come soon we'll listen to a tape on sunday uh so let's go to ephesians 2 by god's grace let me get my text here ephesians 2 verse 1. now we're looking at church how iniquity starts we saw it started in satan then it went to uh the serpent then to cain and then the attributes of satan and kane and then we're looking at we started just sunday morning on how it gets into the minds of people and that's how iniquity starts it's got to get in the mind so let's look at verse one i'll just read one and two and you have the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of the world according to the prince of the power of the air that spirit that now worketh so see what is it what is it that works in sinners it's a spirit that works in them see spirits work right just like the holy spirit works in you and i amen but in when we were sinners the demon spirits worked in us we did the works of the enemy the works of darkness the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind see that's where you that's a great revelation uh forgot about it already how the mind has desires too your soul has a thirst a holy thirst desire your mind has desires your flesh has desires and you've got to control all of it amen but see we're more than conquerors because greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world so we can control all these desires thank god and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who's rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved let's go to matthew chapter six thank god for grace man aren't you glad church there's going to be nobody bragging on the day of judgment aren't you glad amen we're all going to be like pointing back to jesus amen what's your testimony jesus amen jesse what's your testimony brother maokai what's your testimony we're all gonna be brother brandon what's your testimony jesus amen we're gonna be pointing back to christ there'll be no boasting on that day praise god matthew chapter six i believe verse 30 if i remember our brother's memory verse oh i also got a voicemail from a brother in arkansas and said pray for him that he gets the holy ghost he's an older gentleman i need to call him back i just forgot to call back today let's pray for him once we read our memory verse as well so let's read 30 down to 34. a nice long portion here let's ask the holy spirit to write it upon our hearts here verse 30 through 34 on 3 1 2 3 wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where with all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof let's have one more word of prayer can we let's pray for that brother i forget his name now but let's pray for him heavenly father we love you we bless your holy name thank you for this word we've read bless your word anoint me to preach and hear anoint us to hear and obey and believe lord god and lord we pray also for this gentleman who left me the voicemail lord he's an older man he wants the baptism of the holy ghost oh god you said if you ask lord if we ask you won't give us a stone you won't give us a serpent you'll give us bread he's asking for the holy ghost give him the holy ghost lord god even maybe tonight lord as we preach lord god let him be filled oh god may get fully cleaned out and fully obey that he might be filled for your glory god grant it jesus and may we hear testimony for your glory in christ holy name we pray and the saint said amen god bless you being seated praise god i do want to just show a quick visual acacia so if you can switch over here i appreciate that i just want to do a simple little uh visual right right there i don't know that's from a video game i think but i don't play video games but that's a fortress from a video game so i don't know if you knew that but that's the scripture we're going to get to this here in just a little bit uh by the grace of the lord so this is it's i tell you church it's just continually opening and uh i think the gospel don't you believe becomes more simple all the time uh it becomes just more more clear amen um you know the world is mixed in confusion god is not the author of confusion message people if they're really following the holy spirit should not get more confused as the time goes on they should be less confused amen they should have a transformed mind amen of course we know we won't have every single answer we won't know every single detail like i don't even know if the earth is flat or not if it's round i don't know if the the astronauts made it to moon or not but it doesn't matter because i know christ made it past the moon praise god hallelujah that's what i'm saying we've already got one out astronaut in space it's jesus christ amen amen enoch and elijah jesus christ amen so what does it really matter what do those things really have to matter with the gospel you know different men were challenging me this week online and i'm like does it even matter we got one astronaut that's in faith or that's in heaven and that's jesus christ the son of god and that's the only thing i'm really worried about praise god is getting uh to the throne of god not whether we get to mars or not or not whether there's a mars rover i don't know if you saw but they they launched something on saturday called perseverance did you see that they launched a a space shuttle out of florida called perseverance and it was searching for signs of life and i thought how striking that the world is saying perseverance we must be persevere to find signs of life amen and god is sending up you know word after word after word looking for the light we're looking for people that want to serve him amen it is god's perseverance that's sending out his word looking for worshipers who worship him in spirit and in truth amen oh god thank god amen that god is persevering church and he's still sending out his word and looking for signs of life i'm so glad he found mine amen now let's look at this thought how do people become workers of iniquity they open their mind to demons right and demons cause them to work disobedience the bible says that okay so in other words evil spirits in evil minds complete evil works right evil spirits cause humans to do evil works uh now the the opposite is true the holy spirit in holy minds produce holy works amen because paul said in galatians 5 6 faith faith works by love amen amen so faith works by love praise god now we're gonna get to this in just a moment here now remember all your mind body and soul all have desires and you are the one who's in charge of it praise god you and i have to daily crucify the desires of the body and mind so that the soul your the nature of your being uh can actually live and express itself praise god so we are in a constant battle uh to crucify the mind of the lust of the mind right and then the the lust of the flesh it's a constant battle but the bible says in galatians 5 24 they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust amen so you'll know the real children of god by the the works that they crucify in their bodies amen amen so the works that they don't do proves they're christians amen amen the sinful works but the godly works that they do prove to the children of god amen see it's very clear though the true believer is obedient to the holy thirst in their soul and it causes them to cast down all the all the strongholds of the mind that satan tries to build up now uh the scripture that says it is second corinthians 10 4. i'm just going to read it for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds amen praise god so satan tries to build up what we know as complexes a complex is another word is for it's a mental reaction right it's an automatic mental reaction you have is a complex but it also means a building right this is a complex so satan is building up complexes or he's trying to build complexes and fortresses in our mind right and the only thing that can cast it down is the word of god amen and brother said he said uh he said you have the strongest weapon he said in this battle against satan he said he said god's word is like a sword he said he said but faith he said in the word is even greater he said faith in the word is like an atomic bomb praise god amen now picture just an atomic bomb hitting a stronghold that satan sets up in your mind will there be any stones left no sir they'd all be annihilated they all go to death praise god because the the extreme power and the extreme fire the extreme light of the atomic bomb praise god and brother ram said that's what he said the greatest battle ever fault he said don't just try to shoe him away send god's power the atomic bomb he said faith is an atomic bomb faith is assured a revelation and that will destroy any evil thoughts praise god and that will set you free it will cast down the stronghold in your mind and allow you to serve god with your mind amen see ephesians 4 27 says neither give place to the devil church remember the devil's got to knock on your mind and say can i come in your mind and build up a stronghold he knocks and said can i have a place in your mind can i take over your memories and give and remind you of your evil memories that you have and remind you what your dad did or not remind you what your mom did or remind you of what the preacher did or remind you see satan tries to he tries to get a place he tries to get a maybe it's an imagination he's constantly making you imagine wrong things right and he's trying to say can i have your imagination for a few minutes and if we're not careful church we'll give it over and he's a fast builder he's not slow like you and i when we try to build something right say it's really fast just give him a few minutes and he can build something so strong and if and if we're not careful then the scripture says if we're not careful that stronghold starts a war against the soul so go to first peter 2 11. i'll read it out of my uh off my computer here because i don't have it on the slide first peter 2 11. now this is the beauty of god's word if we don't keep satan out of our of our bodies uh and we do evil works and we let him in our mind if we're not careful if we let him in those two realms he will start a war against our soul against our nature that's what the bible says let's read it together so we got your bibles let's all read it out loud we don't do that very often let's do that first peter 2 11. one 2 3 dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul now beseech means to desire to to pray to entreat to summon you to beg you paul's bet peter's begging you he said you're a pilgrim you're a stranger stay away from fleshly sins right like stealing and lying uh and lusting right and arguing and debating and fussing uh abstain from those because they actually start in the mind right the reason you want to argue is because you in your mind you got to thinking i'm smarter i'm greater than them i need to put them in their place pride see and so you speak out in your mind and you'll you'll say something wrong but paul but peter says he says when you do that when you let satan in and you do fleshly less he says you've already got a stronghold that's fighting against your soul so the brother of adam says if you're born again you've got a dove here yeah amen now i've seen a dove today at our house or a pigeon they're the same family is that just a great little great pigeon right two great patients at our house how many know they're not really loud how we know they're real quiet the didn't the bible say it's a still small voice every day that's still small voice we we see them on our daddy dates when i take the kids to the uh the pizza place and we can see the doves up there and they're cooing and you don't want to disturb them but i drove it i drove in my driveway today and those pigeons go running off and they go flying away just just real real small and a real timid right like that said the holy spirit is really timid and church if we're not careful if we don't think the right things we'll we'll hush that that dove we'll we'll eat we'll say be quiet get out stop stop talking to me and then it creates a war and then when we when we when we hush that holy thirst so much that that we start wondering oh my am i even saved am i born again see though i think with amen and sisterhood we'd all say we've had battles times we for sure knew we were born again and times we struggle with it right we've all well what's the difference the difference is when you're feeding that thirst you know you're born again praise god but there's times you don't there's times i don't there's times satan will make us tired or he'll interrupt our schedule right he'll interrupt our fellowship with god and he's allowed to do that because god knows we'll overcome praise god but see it creates a war and so satan is shooting off lies and and he's trying to get there but thank god if we're sealed by the holy ghost he's sealed out hallelujah amen god's spirit is sealed in right and he and satan sealed out but but it doesn't stop the fact that there can be battles there can be wars but thank god we have the shield of faith amen to quench every fiery dart of the devil praise god see church this is now this is bible teaching it starts a war against your soul when you give a place in your mind to the devil oh i'll never get the holy ghost you're going to start a big war right there especially with your soul right oh never i'll never amount to anything oh i'll never enjoy singing i'll never enjoy preaching i'll never enjoy church i'll never nobody loves me all these lives it's live jesus loves you praise god if anybody loves you christ does amen the people in this church do amen if anybody loves you it's the people here praise god that's right we see it creates a war if we if we believe it and start thinking about it especially if we say it right because then satan knows what we're what we're saying right then he knows what we're feeling the map says he won't know if you don't say it he can throw darts in there but he can't know what's in there so we got to be careful not to say the wrong thing see it creates a war when they give now this is for a believer now the worker of iniquity there's only a war at the beginning right they have that holy thirst for a lot a while like that man with the barns right you know he he let it go on for a while but then when he saw his retirement he just he totally had a war again he thought to be quiet and he he sent all of his bombs in there just destroyed it he said hush hush and jesus said you fool this night your soul will be required of you and he hushed that holy thirst see so in other words his soul lost the lord and the world and the and the comforts of this world the laodicean spirit won the war i don't want my testimony to be like that praise god i want to be an overcomer and laodicea praise god i don't want a testimony of a lukewarm you know some days i'm excited about god some days i'm not i want to be hot for jesus amen i want to stay in the word i want to stay singing songs amen i want to stay listening to the sermons i want to stay writing and meditating and thinking about the things of god i don't want a lukewarm testimony i want to be hot for jesus amen that word means fervent praise god that means boiling amen boiling all the time something bubbling up see so that's how you know you're boiling new thoughts are coming all the time new songs new reason to praise god new reasons to testify it's just it's coming up amen it's coming up all the time that's got to be our testimony church i know brother brahm says it church i know abraham says jesus didn't say one good thing to the laodicean church age now that's true for the most part but he did say there was going to be overcomers amen and if you look closely there is going to be the true believer that is zealous and repents and if they're zealous and repent then guess what then they're going to have hot works amen because jesus was talking about their works he said i know your works i'd rather you be cold with no christian works or hot with all christian works he said but the church overall is lukewarm but we're not the church we're the bride amen and we can have hot works we just gotta let the holy spirit constantly bubble up new thoughts and and listen to that holy thirst feed that holy thirst and let god's word move you let the love of god get and ignite your faith to work for god amen that's good to tie it all together thank the lord and let me share something with you sisterhood since your brother amen came up for prayer on sunday let me share some with you brother brandon said being white hot in the church age book he said white hot let me read it too so i feel like i'm gonna chop it up i read that on monday i thought instantly thought of amen and who when they came up for prayer so if i can help people i want to help people how can we be white hot jesus says uh you're either lukewarm cold or hot here's what bro here's what brother bear says brother man says this he says the false church you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want so see we got to believe everything praise god he tells the false church you are not interested in living it but debating it i would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected i could stand it now listen if you would get white hot to know it's the truth and live it i would praise you for that amen so see that's all white hot is that's the simplicity of being hot how do i know i'm hot for jesus how do i know i'm not lukewarm because the word that i've heard i live it amen praise god if i know in other words if i know i gotta repent i don't do it amen if i'm if i know somebody's sick i'll go pray for them bro if i know somebody needs a meal i'll go take them a meal see when you're white hot you know the word and you do the word amen that's that simple that beautiful it's so simple the simplicity of being hot because he's talking about your works right and your works uh come from faith which comes from love praise god so you have to have your first love you have to be on fire with love for jesus and that moves your faith to work for the kingdom of god and so see that's it i thought i heard i read that quote this week i instantly thought of you too so if you want to be white hot for god know the truth and live it oh that's glorious now back to this this is what jesus talked about in matthew 25 let's read it 25 i'm sorry 12 25 i'm sorry matthew 12 25 i said it wrong 12 25 12 25 25-30 and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if satan casts out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you oh thank god or else how can one enter into a strong man's house now look up here that's the strong man's house right that's if he's if he's led of the devil right if he's i'll say this he can be saved both the holy ghost and have a complex right so let's let's make this applicable to us think about the last time you had a complex i was upset with that person or i was scared of that or i i always said that always did that whenever something came up that's a complex how else can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house so if you've got a good house the only way satan can bind you is like you see on all the cartoons or tv shows they've got to come down they got to break down the door and they've got to come in and they've got to capture the warriors right they've got to bind up the fighters oh god god help us to always fight against the devil praise god help us not to lay down to the devil where the devil just comes in and and spoils all of our joy away takes all of our faith away takes all of our hope away oh god help us to find him with the word amen amen that's what jesus said he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad oh my so see this is how satan gets into people's minds he first has to bind up their faith he has to bind up and somehow that's the word paralyzed and that's what i get to next in the next part paralyzing we know is fear fear paralyzes that's brother man said that's the biggest uh enemy for the church is fear remember he said that preached on that number of years ago but god's spirit does not give the spirit of fear it gives power love and a sound by amen so with god's spirit you know exactly where you stand praise god your mind is clear your mind mind is solid your mind is made up glory you've got a real strong castle praise god for build up for god amen that's the holy spirit praise god but see satan will come into our minds and he'll he'll come into our castle right uh uh our in other words our good habits and he'll he'll he'll take fear no paralyze our strength and then he'll take it over then he'll take all of our fighting ability away and then we'll just well whatever happens happens instead of knowing that jesus told us you cast out devils you heal the sick amen you lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover praise god you exercise your faith hallelujah praise god so see it's a great illustration the lord gives in matthew 25 we don't want to be ruined by the devil we don't want our good habits stolen away we don't want to open the door to his lies we don't want to give heed to seducing spirits and doctrine of devils in other words don't allow yourself to think bad thoughts sing good thoughts because that's what he's trying to do as soon as you think bad thoughts he starts taking over the stronghold right or building his own new one we might even say it like that because that's the illustration that we're given remember that's what happened in numbers 14. all those spies came back in numbers 14 they said we can't do it we're like little uh grasshoppers right and they're like giants well when did they forget that god was papa eagle way up there high above all the giants amen they might have been a grasshopper but papa eagle was watching over them amen he was higher than the giants i say like this there's one that's higher than i praise god there's one that's higher than you there's one watching all over you with eyes that can see everywhere it's almighty god papa eagle amen he's watching over us church yeah of course we're small we're always going to be small the the victory's not mine the victory is the lord's amen he's the one that's if he doesn't fight we don't win but if he fights we win praise god but we gotta let him praise god we gotta let him fight amen and see what fear did they said oh we can't do it we're just little grasshoppers and it spread like wildfire see we need the opposite we need faith to spread like fire that's what we need and that's what happens when people get one accord praise god that's what happened when brother cam and brother first were here right it just looked like fire everybody was on fire praise god it just spread like fire the same thing could happen in any service praise god we just got to get in one authority amen and cast out all unbelief praise god see it'll spread the holy spirit fire spreads as well amen now you know the illustration satan is like he's like bringing about a poisonous box of snakes right well just like today i got numerous uh boxes today from amazon prime i didn't have to go out and get them it was my choice i could have left them there all night but i wanted them so i brought them in right and satan brings us a lie we've got a right just leave it out there and then when you get real vote you go have a prayer meeting you get readable what you do is you'll either send it back or you'll go put in the trash can or you'll go burn it in the burn pile either one either one will work you can give it to the guy the next day and say take back your poison box amen you can go burn it i don't know but one thing i know it's our god it's a consuming fire i know snakes don't like fire amen neither does anybody you does any animal praise god so see it's that it's the same idea satan's bringing a package or satan's trying to ransack satan's trying to steal what god has built up in our lives but we've got to be we can be stronger amen it's our choice because god has given us the weapons of warfare amen but this is how workers of iniquity start they start with one evil thought they get they get their guards right they open the door they open the drawbridge can i say like castle language they open the drawbridge and they let this the devil come in and the guards lay down their weapons yet they've got all these guards they've got all this power they've got all this food and ammunition and water stored up like oh come on in devil come on in yeah i want to be mad at my dad or i want to be mad at my mom oh no i i want to go and look at those evil websites and they just give up and they and and pretty soon it becomes a bad habit right pretty soon satan takes over the whole thing and now they're fighting wars against the soul of that person trying to tell them you're not saved you'll never be saved you'll never be a conqueror but thank god jesus says we're more than conquerors in christ jesus amen when we put on the full armor of god amen amen but we got to be willing to fight praise god with his weapons of his warfare praise god you got it right church i've got every right to leave that amazon package out there don't have to take it in i'll let somebody wants to come steal it they can steal it especially if it's a box of rattlesnakes go ahead and take it you can have it if you want because i know who delivered it i watched it was satan's delivery service praise god so we don't want that see we got to keep our minds free from corruption remember the bible said in 2 corinthians 11 3 that satan beguiled eve and corrupted her mind her body was pure she was virgin to the word right virgin physically spiritually but satan corrupted her mind and then he corrupted her body but thank god for the blood jesus cleansed her soul amen because god said i'm i'm gonna come down and make a sacrifice i'm going to forgive her soul thank god for that amen amen hallelujah it's god's grace so we must renew our minds and remember brother baby said perfect faith is the master of every circumstance and all that means church is in any circumstance you wait for god to give you the words to say and then when you got when you got the revelation you speak the word and you're not worried about the circumstances because you know the word is in control of every circumstance praise god that's all that is in every temptation and every and every it's not something mysterious a lot of preachers like to make that oh perfect paper it's just god's word revealed to you when you need it praise god that's all it is it could be your daily life it can be on the job it can be at lunch it can be in night time in the morning in the evening it can be when someone's sick but when god's word is revealed to you and you receive it you're no longer worried about circumstances because faith masters every circumstance like the bible says it brings every thought into captivity to christ amen oh my thank god see you get you have god-given control when god's thoughts god's word comes into your mind and you let it fill your mind and you speak god's word now you have god-given control praise god see that's how many believe that by god's grace amen we all see we overcome by two things the blood of jesus now the blood of jesus gives us full redemption right and total forgiveness amen i'm fully redeemed i'm fully brought back to what i was at the beginning in his mind i am redeemed i am brought back to my rightful position and so when you say god forgive me and you mean it and you're not going to do it again you're redeemed right back to where you were praise god amen right back because it's redemption it's brought back all the way and it's not partial forgiveness it's total forgiveness amen thank you when we really went out that's when we like calls it when we thoroughly repent not like i'm sorry i'll do it tomorrow night too or i'm sorry i'm going to smoke that tomorrow too no that's not full repentance praise god and that's where they become slaves right they hush that holy thirst that's what we said worldly sorrow on sunday i'm sorry god but i'm gonna go smoke that cigar tomorrow you know where whatever you know you know what i'm talking about any addiction to sin now church there are i wrote here stockpiles of scripture that say the evil ones the workers of iniquity are full of darkness the bible says peter says they have eyes full of adultery right they cannot cease from sin they have a heart exercise with covetous practices curse children praise god so see church their eyes only see adultery they only see idolatry they only see the lust of the that's all they see they can't stop seeing it oh but thank god amen that our eyes don't think on those things our eyes are filled with holiness and godliness and and the good things holy things but see workers are manipu that's all they see that's all they want to see and that's all they do because they're full they have totally given over their minds to the wrong thoughts so they have no victory they can't get the victory because their whole their whole fortress is taken over all their thoughts go to evil that's why god destroyed him in the days of noah that's why god said these are like the days of noah right these like the days of lot the days of noah all combined it's all combined evil spirits are all gathering up into this final age that's right they fill their minds with debauchery and their habitually sinning which means they have habits of sin now let's see what jesus said in matthew 6 23 and 24 i'll read that here jesus said if thine i be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness says he whatever you put in your eyes see if your intentions or your eyes what you're looking at what you're trying to see if it be evil your whole body will be filled with darkness so if you let evil in here the whole outer court right it's gonna work its way out right you put evil in you're gonna get evil out jesus said if your eye be evil your whole body be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness so you see he's he's making it like eve eve thought she was receiving light oh new knowledge from the serpent lie lie lie she thought it was new revelation but it wasn't god said it was darkness and jesus says the same thing when we think lies the light that's actually in our minds is darkness he said how great is that darkness church you know it almost every i'm sure naomi knows it i was raised in pentecost to church i was raised in medical centers they think they're full of light when they they'll just like when we were praying for my uncle my mom just started speaking in tongues and i could tell it doesn't seem like a real tongue it just seemed like one of those tongues you know she's making up as she goes along well bless her heart you know but that's wrong they have they think it's light well i can just i can speak in tongues whenever i want that's a false light but if they if that if they if they take that into they take it into their eyes the preachers and they believe them and they they believe the lies but if that light in thee be darkness how great is the darkness no man can serve two masters so it comes out of two things we're either looking and being our eyes are filled with good things or our eyes are being filled with lustful things or simple things right jesus says our eyes our eyes serve one or the other oh thank god for god's grace amen thank god for god's grace you know church most of the people on this world can't preach it remember we put the cell phone up here wasn't that awesome when he preached that's like everybody right yeah and you know we all got to have it i got to have it for work and school and texting people and emailing people helping people but see it's either filled with good things or bad things i'm thankful that my phone's filled with all these good keynotes about and powerpoints about god i'm glad you won't find an evil one on there praise god because my eye is filled with real light praise god now like this how great is this light amen i don't know it's a great light it's the light of the hour amen amen it's the light of this church age hallelujah so you see it goes back to who you serve your eyes are going to serve one or the other for either he'll hate one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon which is riches so demons demons hide behind love of riches right there's nothing wrong with being rich it's the demon power and lust behind that for riches right so there's another there's a great scripture see how they're full see how the bible says brother brahma says brother man says this i know the quote but brother says you're either going to leave here full of something either god or the world let's leave here full of the holy spirit praise god where everything i want to see everything i want to do everything i want to talk about is all god god god god jesus jesus jesus word word word holy spirit signs miracles wonders teaching truth god's word help all the gifts of god let that fill our hearts and minds amen you're going to be full with something when we leave here praise god let's be full of faith praise god amen because remember you is either one of the other you're the servant your eyes are serving one or the other that's why i told the children when they get the holy ghost their eyes are gonna be on the word when i got the holy ghost my eyes was on the bible and the church age book and the seal book that's all i want my eyes on i know not everybody's a preacher i know that too but if you're not a preacher then your eyes will be on music or something you know it'll be maybe on something you'll be on good things because if your eyes uh serve one or the other what you let in your eyes now you know romans 1 paul describes homosexuals saying their minds knew god's word but refused to retain it so god gave them over to a rejected reprobate mind being filled with all unrighteousness now let's read it um go to let's go to romans 1 here i believe let me see it's verse let's look at 38 here a little bit 20 let's go to uh now speaks of homosexuality in verses 26 to 28 let's go to verse 29 because you know that and so see church god gives over homosexuals many of them go beyond salvation many of them can't be saved thank god some do uh there's a ministry called ray conference ministry called living waters they have a conference every year where the the people who came out of homosexuality they they gather there to encourage one another that god can bring you out but it's a very small group verse 29 look what does the bible say they're being what filled with all unrighteousness he's speaking of homosexuals here fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignant whispers did you see this week ellen degeneres everybody's coming against her do you see that this week she's homosexual she's had the number one morning show for how many years and now everybody's coming out saying it's a toxic work environment well that's i could have told you that the bible says i could have told you that a long time ago now i could i didn't predict it but i could have told you that the bible says homosexuals are for fornication wickedness covetous they said she's like a stone behind the camera she's hateful towards everybody well that's exactly what the bible says look at verse 30 backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection see that even a woman doesn't love a man anymore they love woman and woman they don't even love babies right they want babies to be aborted implacable unmerciful what's implacable mean let me check real quick here uh okay they refrain i'm so yeah they cannot enter into covenants covenants okay so that deals with marriage probably or even uh god's covenant who now listen look at verse 32 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death that's god's word god's word said if they do not retain god's knowledge they're worthy of death see if they don't put god's word in here in order to meet that holy thirst god says you're worthy to die because i gave you a holy thirst i gave you desire to know it but you purposely quiet it down and you build up an evil empire in your mind the empire of darkness and so that makes someone worthy of hell worthy of judgment when he had a holy thirst but they allow satan's powers they know better but they allow satan's powers to hush and silence the holiness that was already inside them that makes them worthy of death and not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them so at first they don't have pleasure in sinning but once they reject god's word and let satan overtake their thoughts and all they do is think evil all the time now they have pleasure now it's just unbelief here they silence the holiness now it's all in belief and now they just they don't have like brother man said uh they've got as much conviction as a snake's got legs right or snake's got arms or i'm sorry he said a snake has hips sorry he said they've got as much conviction as a snake has hips in other words they don't have any because they've already passed the line between mercy and judgment but thank god if we feel bad about our sins oh god god help us to feel the conviction of the holy spirit and be filled with righteousness amen and not unrighteousness because this this is where it happens this is where they become this is where they cross the line of mercy and judgment they give and they build up strongholds and a fortress a city for satan and all they do is think about evil thoughts in their minds let's go to hosea real quick let's go to hosea uh four verse six hosea four verse six thank you for your patience and give me uh 15 minutes here let me finish up i didn't even set a timer so i don't even know how long i've been preaching it feels like 10 minutes so if i go to 8 15 i think you can you'll bear with me i appreciate that i'm sure you will you're such a great wonderful loving people here let's see church people misinterpret this scripture all the time because they only read to the first semicolon my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge and they say see people go to hell because they didn't hear that's not true that's not true the bible says that in romans 1 that the homosexuals had the knowledge of god in fact romans 1 is where it says it was they saw in creation and it was in them so they have a two witnesses against them and they didn't retain they didn't keep god's knowledge so then satan filled their reprobate mind gave them a reprobate mind and they're lost we say oh well people didn't hear the message they could never go to heaven nonsense keep reading my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast rejected knowledge see the reason they lack it because they kicked it out of their house amen the reason they lack strength is because they let the devil steal their strength amen they had it but they lost it amen that's why that's what that's the real meaning of the scripture the reason they lack knowledge is because they rejected they didn't want it anymore it's not because they never knew they knew the bible said it's written on their conscience in romans 2. because the house rejected knowledge i will also reject thee so there's there's god's standard i put holiness in you i put a holy thirst in you i put my law in your conscience so the law is in your mind right and you have a thirst in your mind for the law of god you have a holy thirst in your soul for god's spirit but to reject that god said i'll reject you that thou shalt be no priest to me speaking of israel here seeing thou has forgotten the law of thy god i will also forget thy children oh lord help us help us not to forget the commands of god amen that's why church i always enjoy coming to church you know sometimes i'm a little embarrassed because i forget some things i preached a few years ago like oh man i couldn't really use that that's true i thought my i'll hear a preacher preaching i'm like i already used that quote about 10 years ago why did i forget that but see that's why i need to keep listening to the word of god hallelujah that's why you and i need to keep listening and quoting the word and keep memorizing the word and keep uh pointing at reading and knowing the word because we forget and we must not forget we must remember praise god jesus said the holy ghost will bring all things to our remembrance but we got to feed it too he said he said don't neglect that gift that's in thee he said give yourself the reading and the exhortation i remember that that's a preacher but church you too you're supposed to read your bible program says you got two things to get closer to god read your bible and pray and that's how simple it is and then like we said if you want to be white hot then act on what you heard amen live it act upon it he said you'll be white hot for the lord oh amen you love the lord praise god let us not forget the law of god now i'm just going to start the next section lord willing i'll finish it on sunday you know i got a a email from a brother in mexico saying or sorry el salvador saying he's really enjoying this series on iniquity i say well praise the lord and uh my niece emma is reading this chapter so i print out the chapter i sent cam all the chapters it was like seventy dollars to print all the chapters on paper and it was like fifteen dollars i made it over there and i told cam pass it around your church and read it and emma my niece she's 16. she's reading this chapter saying i learned so much about the serpent seed now see church that's what we need to do we need to strengthen people amen i may not say many people with this little book well it's going to be big book or willing actually i may not say many people but if i strengthen people sister beatrice i'll rejoice amen because that's what the word edification means strengthen what you already got amen so it's already strengthening young believers thank god hallelujah and we're preaching it here and strengthening people in south america by god's grace or central america sorry central america we know fewer fewer people be saved fewer fewer people filled with the holy ghost but let's strengthen those that we got left that's what god told martin luther he he said strengthen that which remains amen whatever you've got left strengthen that praise god make sure you're strong in the lord hallelujah so let me just start this next section here we're going to specifically look at the iniquity filled scribes pharisees and sadducees so lucifer and cain were religious but eventually all their acts were meaningless they hid behind religion so religion was their veil to hide behind right it was their sheep's clothing for the wolf behind them right i'll sacrifice my fruits i'll pay my tithes on mit and cumin and i'll i'll pay you every little thing i gotta pay the pharisee but as a wolf in sheep's clothing and so look now satan the same devil that was in cain fast forward now that same devil is in the pharisees sadducees and scribes in church these two portions of scripture show the depths of iniquity of these groups it is the sermon on the mount and matthew 23 jesus gives eight woes against the pharisees in matthew 23. now brother man says the greatest most bitter denunciation is the message to the laodicean church age but from my reading too i agree with that but my reading too jesus's most bitter rebukes are on the sermon on the mount and in matthew 23. he he completely he just tears them up i don't know any other way to say it he tears up their uh their sheep's clothing and he pulls away the curtain he pulls away the veil of sheep's clothing and they're exposed for ravening wolves is what they're exposed for in church matthew chapters five six and seven that's what i was trying to tell by the stephen i said your memory verse was exactly what i was trying to get on sunday morning but i didn't get there chapters five six and seven give the most details on the sermon of the amount uh part of this was taught privately to disciples but also to a great audience in chapter five jesus beatitudes emphasize blessings upon spiritual purity his disciples were to keep and teach his commands and sincerity and listen their righteousness was to exceed that of the pharisees and let me say this our righteousness ought to exceed the pentecostals today how many could say amen to that if ever there was a time that our righteousness should exceed the catholic church it should be right now praise god amen if ever there was a time why because this is the time of restoration this is the heart the time of hearts turning back to the fathers amen see their hearts are turning back to the mother harlot right uh wrong but our hearts are turning back to the paul and peter and john and all the original apostles our hearts are turning back to the real faith amen jesus rebukes their legalism and there are popular religious parties of their day he magnifies moses law so he takes the magnifying glass of god's word and he magnifies it and moses law becomes so much greater and clearer remember magnifying means now you can see something you couldn't see before right oh and i can see oh look at all these living things i didn't know they were there that's the same thing jesus did they say thou shalt not commit adultery jesus magnified that and said see if you've got that demon in your mind you've already committed the same thing see you didn't see it but i saw it you you only saw it when you got caught with a prostitute or got caught in adultery he said well i see that i see it in your human spirit i see your your complex buildup of adultery in your heart and you must repent or you're guilty of doing the same thing he magnified the law in matthew 5 6 and 7. on anger mental lust adultery swearing resisting not evil giving and loving enemies mercy so i love this the pharisees are sitting right there and jesus said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god and jesus knew they were impure jesus knew they were full of dead men's bones and yet he let him sit there i love chapter six chapter six in matthew 6 gives jesus's three attacks on religious hypocrites that lived in the jewish synagogues and include the pharisees jesus says all of their following three things were all in vain all of their alms all their praying and all their fasting were all done hypocritically the church can you imagine anything more sad than that do you ever understand that devils will fast devils will move people too fast because they're fastened for the wrong reasons they're fasting to be seen of men this is this is powerful jesus condemns their fasting you say well you know well i fasted that proved i was sincere not all not every time not every time now with most of us we're going to be sincere about it right but with religious and workers of iniquity with religious impostors wolves in sheep clothing jesus condemns even their fasting in church even their prayers that's not the group i want to be in i don't want to be in the group that i fast for the wrong reasons i pray for the wrong reasons and i give for the wrong reasons but that's what christ did in matthew chapter 6. so see when you see workers of iniquity that spirit gets so strong that it says oh fast so you can look tired and people will ask you and then you can brag to people when you're fasting that's a demon right or announce on your your church facebook page that you're giving out food to the poor so everybody knows how holy you are or tell people how much or call call for prayer and call your friends to pray and then you don't even pray god help us right this is what they did and jesus calls out all their works and proves they're the workers of iniquity their giving was iniquity their praying was iniquity they're fasting was iniquity can you think of any more of a better rebuke than that or harsher rebuke than that they're ver the most personal religious works they could possibly do jesus said it's in vain how many want to be true worshipers amen the holy spirit is looking for true worshipers who worship in spirit and in truth we need to fast so we can we so we want to see god move not so we get recognition right we want to give to genuinely help people even though we'll be we'll be short maybe a little bit that month on certain maybe won't be able to pay off as much as we want we want to give because we want to help people and we know we want to make their lives a little bit easier on this side not so that somebody says oh my jesse sent me 300 look what a great man is and put it on facebook or put it on instagram that's not why we want to do it or like he says public prayer well i hope brother jesse calls me up to pray now i hardly do that at all so probably doesn't affect anybody here but see that's this is this this is the uh rebuking of workers of iniquity they let this build up so long that satan sends them tells their body to fast satan tells them to give satan tells them to pray but it's all for the wrong reason let me close with this here that was chapter six chapter seven jesus's hypocritical charges on those who judge others despite being guilty of the same sins yet he promises to hear our prayers and proclaims the golden rule fulfills the law and the prophets hallelujah jesus ends chapter seven with this compare and contrast between true and false religion i'm closing with this jesus says there are two gates he said enter into the straight gate jesus says there are two ways right one's broad one's easy one's very difficult how many feel like that how many feel like you're walking a narrow road it's hard to stay on this road praise god it's hard to stay close to christ jesus said it's not it's not broad it's not something you can just easily walk into every day you've got to really you've really got to got to watch your path you really got to watch your steps praise god two gates two ways there's two kinds of prophets two kinds of preachers there's two kinds of trees with two kinds of fruits two kinds of builders on two kinds of foundations i'm so glad aren't you glad god made it easy it's either one or the other aren't you glad like isn't glad tonight you know you're either one of the other i'm either saved or i'm lost thank god i'm saved in church there's two kinds of builders there's workers of iniquity and there's wise workers and the difference is between sayers versus doers glory like white hot there it is right there white hot white hot is someone who knows the word and does it remember at the end of matthew 7 you have you have those that are saved they're doers of the word they build their life upon the foundation rock of christ but you have just the sayers that say lord lord did we not do this and he said you workers of iniquity i never knew you they just said it they just said lord lord but their life every day didn't work for jesus christ so iniquity-filled builders give god lip service but fail to do god's will wise workers perform god's will praise god let's be wise workers i'm going to be wise workers let's seek let's find let's enter the straight gate let's enter the narrow gate leading to eternal life praise god amen let's not take the easy way of life let's take the hard way of life fighting and battling against every demon power ma look at that church both prophets look like sheep both of them look like sheep but jesus says by their fruits you'll know them a wolf will the bible says it'll eat up your life it'll eat up it'll take away it'll take away your joy right i'll take away your money right mouse so they creep into houses and for after money so a wolf will ravage your life it'll destroy your life and just take away your joy take away your peace all these things but a real shepherd will build you up in christ amen greedy wolves they destroy they destroy lives they destroy churches but the good the the true sheep right and the true trees the godly trees they're known by their godly fruits and by their lives praise god that's the end of our feet i'll stop right there musicians you can come here let's continue building our house upon the rock of god's word so when the storms come how many know the storms are going to come in jesus's parable church there wasn't an option where no storms come upon your house i'm sorry if that disappoints you or surprise you i'm sorry about that but in both kinds of foundation whether it's sand or rock huge storms come and only one of them stands only one house stands that's the doer of the word those who those who hear the word and do it and act upon it that's where i want to stand i want to stand on christ you have a song in your heart on crisis solid rock i stand amen uh we just love god's word don't we church rains and floods cannot destroy the real christian life it's built to last praise god there's a great falling away predicted in the last days that's for workers of iniquity who houses are built on sand they haven't built upon the truth of god's word but you and i church we will not fall away but we will stand that's what paul said with the armor of god he said when you've got the word of god having done all stand upon god's word let's stand on god's word praise god [Music] my hope is [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] jesus righteousness [Music] next day [Music] darkness is [Music] i [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] all around us is [Music] it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] everyone that heareth these sayings of mine tonight sorry i will liken him to a wise man which built his house [Applause] [Music] after temptation but let me say this if we build our life the right way if we obey god's word we won't fall we just have to withstand the meaning praise god understand the fiery darts and keep standing praise god standing up on that rock of that word keep believing god's word [Music] we hear it and then we go to it so god help us if we heard something help us to don't [Music] [Music] temptations and trials and storms but god we want to stand on your word today help us to do what we've heard today help us to cast down evil thoughts help us not to let the devil come in help us to go burn the box of rattlesnakes hey man help us to have the shield of faith to extinguish every fiery dart from hells to pits and hells uh hell's bows and arrows oh god the lies of their bows and arrows help us to cast them down in jesus name may the holy spirit raise up a standard against these floods as we get beaten throughout monday and tuesday and wednesday oh god thank you for raising up the standard today praise god your word had that revelation of being dropped out into our hearts to destroy satan's strongholds that we might build a godly heaven and we might go to godly testimony godly thoughts transformed mind with a real strong vote for christ hallelujah where we have stockpiles of joy we got stockpiles of faith and rejoicing and peace and hope granted lord jesus and we can have strongholds and castles with all your blessings and all your spoils of the wars all that you purchased on calvary hallelujah and we have thank you lord i pray for the young i pray for the old i pray for the middle age i pray for the married i pray for the single i pray for the little children in jesus christ's name god give us houses that can stand and withstand every flood in every great storm in jesus [Music] thank you christ [Music] lord god
