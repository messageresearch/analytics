think it dangers had honor hard to be baptized I don't know if you've seen it but ladies even standing up praising the Lord raising their hands no one's moving or do that except the Lord that's it so wonderful crazy beautiful work the Lord is doing praise God Matthew chapter 5 stir a little memory verse verse 3 - verse 12 then I like to read out of acts 17:11 like to continue this prove all things series hopefully your memorizing the scripture if you like your memorizing it no more oh thank you and the batteries may fail I didn't charge them so but sometimes the battery charge will hold over for a week so if they go out children let me know now switch to the Mike Harrison appraisal or hope you memorize in this scripture becoming more dear to you let's read verse 3 to verse 12 on three one two three blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the

persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you praise God it's go to acts 17 verse 11 praise God now verse 10 knows tells us we're speaking of the Bereans here Lucas speaking of the Bereans and verse 11 these were more noble than those in Thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily whether those things were so may God as blessing the reading of his word let's have a word of Prayer here if we can let's just bow our heads here if you ever need on your heart just making on it the Lord here Heavenly Father Lord we just come reverently praying Lord believing Lord we'll see miracles Lord God we know the greatest miracle is a soul that's saved so we're grateful for all the souls and have been saved oh God thank you Lord we know also there's prophecy for the latter rain Lord your prophet said thus saith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride and Lord how we're living for that day Lord God how we're living for that latter rain rapturing faith Lord believing it's prophecy Lord and not basing it upon some thought Lord or some idea man but upon the Word of God and so we're grateful Lord we're happy to be in your house take this word that we've read and bless it to us break it to us help us to understand Lord God and thank you for answering questions that some of us have had Lord God and I just pray Lord that the Holy Spirit would would

or strengthen the feeble Lord encourage the discouraged father fill them with the holy ghost who are not yet filled Oh God granite Lord Jesus we know all things are possible to them to believe Lord and so father we're happy to be Christians in this hour and let us be pure in heart for we shall see God face to face Lord God granite we pray in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you being seated praise the Lord by God's grace will kind of pick up where we left off on Wednesday so I have quotes there children if you'd like to switch over here how was the good doctor doing sister Kristen he doing good back on three oh do you have surgery or something okay good well thank the Lord Frey's good gladiators not as not sick with surgery praise Allah we appreciate your sacrifice sister Kristen bring your family and it's always a blessing to see your family and they're always such an encouragement to everybody so praise the Lord so let's look at this thought here today proven all things by the grace of the Lord you know uh you know a lot of these sermons have been really good you know for me to preach too I guess I've always wanted to look at some of these quotes but not really know how to bring it out but I think the Holy Spirit brought the right time and then the right approach to it by the grace of the Lord what I mean is I always want people to to understand that that we believe brother Branham was a prophet but yet we don't worship Him and we we don't exalt him and and we have to treat him like any other prophet take everything they say back to the Word of God you know no prophet is above questioning you know you have to you have to prove all things the Bible says try every spirit and so you know I've waited long and you know just in the back of my mind for a time to preach on these things so works out great and I also appreciate that Natalia's here so that works out good too because she's just new to everything and things were preaching and so I think it works really great that the Holy Spirit's led her to hear these things so I thank the Lord for that and hope it's been a blessing to you so yesterday I recorded the video for brother Billy Paul and Joseph I was editing it this morning it's probably taking you all week to edit it and then Lord willing next weekend upload it and share with them and after that Lord willing I'm just gonna make a video just of the seven doctrines I see that are false coming out of Jeffersonville so I guess I'll share for natália sake you know we believe William Branham was a prophet but we believe his sons have kind of gotten off the word a little bit they say every word their dad said was thus saith the Lord but we don't agree with that we believe every prophet is human every prophet makes a human mistake but to be a real prophet every time they said thus saith the Lord it had to come to pass and that's why we believe William Branham is a genuine prophet now there's a lot of questions about some things he said so we'll be looking more into that in the future Lord willing and and then also you know the there's a gentleman who's trying to get me to debate the guy from believe the sign the gentleman knew so I'm still looking to do that but probably a March or something like that I want to I want to study more on these topics and then feel I could I could be able to go through a debate and just I just want to stand up for the message praise God you know I I just want to stand with you know my brother Graham says you know we live in a day where you know it's not very violent you know our in at least in America and he said we we might not have have to give our lives you know as far as like as a martyr in America we might not have to do that but we want our voice to be recorded in heaven that we spoke the truth and gave people a chance to hear the truth praise God so we want to give our lives in a different way you know perhaps one day we will have to give our lives as martyrs god forbid but we'd have to be willing to do that but until then we should be giving our voices standing up for the truth of the Bible unashamed of the gospel because Jesus said if you're ashamed of me and my word he said I'll be ashamed of you in the of the Holy Angels so we don't want to be ashamed of the Word of God praise the Lord and so we will begin there and then you know looking at these scriptures here I think I've kind of thoroughly gone through that you know over the last you know thirteen years of our church I've showed many biblical proofs so why William Branham is a prophet but I just want to review him real quick brother Branham is the only person I know the only person I know other than maybe some he's I should say he's only solid person I know that's ever spoken with thus saith the Lord I know Benny Hinn has done it I know a Kim Clemente has done it but very few others do I know that ever spoke with thus saith the Lord now Benny Hinn said in the name of Lord he said God was going to destroy all the homosexuals in the 1990s well we know that didn't happen so we know of course his lifestyle - the prosperity gospel and the way they live their lives we know he's not a genuine prophet now the Kim Clemente I haven't even studied anything he said but the man's got real long hair and we know a man's supposed to cut his hair so you know Lord willing if you want me to I'll study some of his things out but he kind of does like rock and roll music until he feels like he's real emotional then they'll start prophesying and we know God's not in rock and roll so I just haven't devoted any time to studying his words but I you know I may but the only one I know you know and we can throw names now like Benny Hinn I'm sorry Billy Graham TD jakes you know Jack Co you can throw in any name you want of any famous preacher Joel Osteen you can throw off none of them I know ever spoke with the authority of thus saith the Lord except brother Branham and so we take what he said and then we have to take it to the word as we said we prove all things and even such a small thing as this if I can just share this real quick last year I did about 134 days I think on Facebook just proving how the Trinity was wrong and everything and and showing how we should be modestly dressed and I took a break because I just was tired of it and I wanted to devote my time you know to writing the next book but brother branham said thus saith the lord trinitarianism is of the devil now the Trinity doctrine says that there's three persons in God and they're all equal but just to share you know I just have this scripture on my heart you know Isaiah 40 25 says to whom then will you liken me or shall I be equal sayeth the Holy One like there plainly plainly the god of the Old Testament is saying I don't have any holy equal ones you know and then the word Trinity and God the definition God in three persons it's not even in the scripture so you know when brother I would make a statement like that we've got to take it back to the Word of God and we see it's right God never says I'm two persons ah he's never says I'm three persons so even in a statement like that we've got to take it back to the word now even with baptism brother BAM said the Father Son Holy Ghost tidal baptism is is wrong and he said that's thus saith the Lord now we got to understand that 10 days after Jesus said that Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins so we know Jesus in Matthew 28:19 was speaking in a parable form or we could say he was speaking in mystery because the Bible said that the Messiah would come and utter mysteries the Bible actually says that in the Old Testament and so 10 days after Jesus has baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost Peter full of the Holy Ghost with the keys of the kingdom opens the kingdom to the Jews through the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen not long after that Peter opens the door to the Samaritans in acts 8 I'm sorry corny OSes house rather in acts 8 and he baptizes them they get baptized in the name of the Lord I'm sorry it is acts 8 yeah I'm sorry I think he gets X 8 16 yeah for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then in acts 10 I believe it's 48 Peter tells them to be baptized and the Bible just records it as be baptized in the name of the Lord and so Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Lord and then there's one more in the book of Acts 19 verse 5 this just kind of came to my heart just to show to two simple examples Paul baptized when he saw the the believers in in Ephesus he baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus praise God so when brother man would make a statement like that we've got to go back to the word and we find that it's right we find no one was ever baptized saying titles father son or Holy Ghost and so we can see that that scripture is right and here this is important too because Paul says he baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then if you know a Galatians chapter 1 Jesus Christ was the one who taught Paul his gospel because he said the gospel which a preach know of me is not after man he said neither I received it he said of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah praise the Lord and I think he tells us yeah where he tells us that that he went up to Arabia and that's where Jesus met him to give him the revelation he said neither when I upped I Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus and so that's where the Lord Jesus met him praise God all right now that I think those are those are review for most of us I just want to say that when brother Brad makes a statement like that we've got to take it back to the word and church every time I've done that I found it to be right praise God now he also revealed many mysteries there's 12 New Testament mysteries I've mentioned those a lot lately in the last few years and each one God has revealed to us through the ministry of brother Branham such as the rapture such as Mystery Babylon such as the mystery of the New Testament church as the bride there's all mystery of godliness the mystery of iniquity all these mysteries have been revealed to us through Bell Rams ministry which other men didn't preach Clarence Larkin didn't preach it your eyes Smith didn't preach it Joseph Smith didn't preach these things these were all revealed in our day praise God and then there was other truths that were not called mysteries that were just restored like marriage and divorce marriage and divorce was not called a mystery in the Bible what was what happened though is that the revelation got lost praise God but then it had to be restored and remember Jesus said all things will be restored in acts 3 verse 21 maybe this will help all of us here acts 3:21 the Bible says actually acts verse 3 RX 3 verse 20 rather and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began so in acts 3 21 the Bible says Jesus Christ will remain in heaven until everything is restored on earth that's what we were thinking about earlier the miracles amen until Jesus is going to remain there until the miracles are restored the doctrines restored the life is restored the the teachings restored all that the early church had is going to be restored and then Jesus Christ will come back for his church amen that's exactly what the Bible says right there that's exactly what it says now go to Matthew 7 tear yeah Matthew 17 yeah Matthew 17 verse 11 yeah because I read acts 17:11 and now it's Matthew 17 11 so I got my 17 11s going on here and Jesus Christ says it himself that Elijah is gonna come and restore all things and one of those things to be restored was the mystery of marriage and divorce the mystery of original sin there's all kinds of truths that were lost the mystery of predestination right the mystery of God's sovereignty eternal security the mystery of the book of life all the all these truths that people that the Saints knew were lost and they've got to be restored so Matthew I'm sorry yeah Matthew 17 11 and jesus answered and said he lies truly shall first come and restore all things so see everything in the Bible all the all the truths that were lost have to be restored and I'm happy to be living in the day when they've been restored amen hallelujah how do you know they've been restored because of Revelation 10 7 let's go there now how do you know they've been restored because the Bible says the mysteries of God must be finished first and then they're brought down to earth and then they're scattered around the world the the Great Commission must be fulfilled praise God so revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets so there's going to come a time when the mysteries of God are going to be finished and then in verse 8 and the voice which I had heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open now what did it contain the mysteries because that's what it says in verse 7 and then it says take that book and which is in which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey isn't it great to talk about the message but it's a lot harder to live the message right Church it's great to talk about but it's another thing to live it praise God that's where we see so many fall away verse 11 and he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so the idea is the book gets open in heaven the seals get loose that's we sang about earlier it gets brought down to heaven it's given to a seventh angel on the earth but then John is a symbol of the church he the book eats it and the voice said go prophesied to every kindred nation and tongue well we know by history John didn't do that John didn't travel around the world right he went to that island of Patmos in his late 90s there and then came back to his his home of origin and died we know he didn't travel around the world so this is prophetic this is prophetic that the bride the believer like John would take the book when it's revealed when the mysteries are finished and then prophesied again all around the world and then then Jesus can come back he said when the gospel has been preached to every nation praise God amen oh that's the gospel truth if I know it praise God Ethan and then brother Graham had many fruits to his ministry I think Natalia was here when we saw I think you saw the picture of sister Florence Humes yeah you were here I think you here at part one that's right I've met I met her before she passed she was in brother Graham's prayer line it's recorded on tape brother man prophesied to her and told her she was gonna be healed of tuberculosis and she was praise God there's many fruit to the ministry like even still ministers today that knew brother Branham that were faithful to the message that he preached there's many hundreds and thousands of people that are receiving Christ and being saved in the message I'm one of them praise God amen I am a fruit to the ministry of the message praise God that brother Branham preached hallelujah and then last Wednesday or Wednesday we saw the angel visitation the angels told Balaram he would pray for kings and potentates and and rulers and brother Branham did we showed you the pictures there we showed you we showed you that on Wednesday night so if you want to see that again let me know I can email that to you as a PDF it's a very small file so the very the very thing that angel foretold him in 1946 came to pass praise God and he prayed for great men and and women and God healed them praise the Lord hallelujah so so that's just a short little summary again of why I believe William Branham was a prophet a genuine prophet of God amen and of course there's more to be said I just tried to summarize it like that all right Paul we then we saw how Paul needed proven you know those Marines just didn't you know accept everything he said they took everything he said back to the word and the Bible called them Noble which were of great kingly we'd say kingly ability or or kingly descent in other words they were very spiritually mature people praise God and we must always be ready to give answers and many times a day we see people that don't want to do this because if you want to find the answer you got a dig deeper you gotta wait upon the Lord you've got to invest your time you got to invest your energy and to study things out and and you got to put yourself kind of in the middle and you don't feel as stable you got to put yourself in a a little difficult position so you see people that they just they want to get rid of all the questions they don't want to address any questions about brother Branham or anything he taught they just want to make everything that he said true but you can we've got to do what the Bible says we got to have an answer for the reason of the hope that we have within us amen but yet there come a great falling away from the truth which we of course are seeing today now there are seven statements from the the tape church movement which as we said was the the jeffersonville movement and the one where we were focusing on now hopefully we'll finish today is every word brother Adam said was us at the Lord that's a false statement that's not true there are things of course that he said that are true with thus saith the Lord but they were but this group wants to make every word he said thus saith the Lord has this helped yourself our church okay I hope so now I moved it up to nineteen I had nothing at eighteen on there on Wednesday I have nineteen statements that I believe brother Branham even agrees with he was wrong on and actually found another today I was listening to try and do God a service from November of 65 and brother Ram told his wife and it's on tape he told his wife before he went out west I'm going to die because he had the vision of the seven angels coming and the blast remember brother man said it I heard it on Dave this morning he said honey I'm gonna die he told his wife I'm going to die I'm going out west to die but the the vision end up being it he interpreted the vision wrong it wasn't that he was the dye is that it was to shake the earth and he meet the seven angels who would tell him go back east and open up the seven seals he says it didn't mean my death it meant a furthering of my work Amen there's another thing on tape that's not thus saith the Lord so I could add this I could make it twenty but I just heard this morning I didn't have time to write down all the quotes so we went through you know his when he's talking about he how he sinned twice we know those weren't thus saith the Lord because God doesn't teach us to sin the four predictions 1977 death by gunshot Billy Paul was as Joseph and the Martin Luther King prediction those were not thus saith the Lord as far as we can see brother Ram admits he said I don't say this I don't say the Lord tell me this he said I'm just saying my opinion and then there was five doctrines that we finished on Wednesday we saw how brother man said Jesus was not on the throne any more but then later he says he is but madam said the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit but then he changes it to the Antichrist with thus sayeth the Lord then he says the Holy Ghost is the third person he says Jesus is the third person and then he said there's not three persons then he said there's seven weeks from Pentecost atonement and then he fixed that and said that was wrong then he said the new birth was not the baptism of the Holy Spirit but then he said it was when in the same praise the Lord and now there's a statements we'll go through some of them here today by God's grace I'm sorry yeah some of these we went over on Wednesday night Butler Adams said your three persons but then he fixed it he said you're in a cycle of three but one person remember that on Wednesday brother Branham had a slip of the tongue and said Rebecca went to go meet her bride which would be a sin for a woman to go meet a bride so we know program left out the word groom does that stumble anybody doesn't some of me because you didn't say they'll say it the Lord but see we that proves though again you can't make every word infallible well Ram said first that Mary's egg United with God's germ to make the body of Jesus but then he changed it later and said no God did both egg and germ okay and then there's a quote that's kind of hard to understand some people believe brother I'm saying it's okay to wear a little makeup but he could be talking about hair color as well it's kind of hard to tell but that's why some message people wear a little bit of makeup because well graham said if you're colourless he said a little bit of color would be all right I imagine but it's hard to know if he's talking about hair color or eye color I just leave it although if the Bible condemns makeup three times we'll just leave it although brother Ram said if you get the Holy Ghost it'll make it take all the makeup makeup off your face so I just try to bet you have to balance these quotes out and some of them are very hard to understand but see our anchor see that's our anchors not in a man our anchors in the word and the Holy Spirit will always direct us to the word praise God now I got four more statements actually five but let me go back to this one because I ended this one on Wednesday night how it seemed like brother Ram was saying time would be no more does anybody remember me saying that on Wednesday night okay I don't know if I got to go all the way through that okay yeah so this is a bit misunderstood if you listen to God hiding himself at simplicity if you listen to the breach between the church ages and the seals and the first seal on numerous times in their Road Ram says when the lamb takes the book and he comes out of the throne and he opens the book there's no more Redemption he says because mediation is over in other words Jesus's body's no longer sitting down on a throne of God making intercession it's now standing and the book is open well brother Graham he seems to think that but by the end of the the next year in 64 he's already saying no they're still mercy don't ever think there no more mediation so we can see that he struggled with it himself now who wouldn't church which one of us wouldn't struggle with that which one of us have a perfect understanding of the Bible now red Ram was memory is preaching this at a time where you're singing visit visions daily right we're for the seals he's he's at a time was a very spiritual time and he and he was very spiritual and he wanted to be on his toes and and he wanted the people to be ready for the coming of Lord aren't you glad he wasn't ever ready to be ready for the coming of Lord don't you want to be ready for the coming of the Lord and so there's no sin in this because he never says thus saith the Lord but we you can see as you read the quotes there was uncertainty he didn't know how much time was left he didn't know there's there's even a statement he makes in the seals he said you just wait he said if if there was that Holy Ghost come in the church at the end of the church ages and made a light in January 61 on the back wall he says wait till you see what happens on Sunday night when that seven seals open up as far as we know nothing happened but he was under such expectation he easily said Maya if I had such a if God moved under such a message is that what about these seals when I've had all these visions all these days he was just presuming he was just thinking that there was going to be a great move now let's look at these quotes here Church know and these are the ones my family and I've been listening to though we've been listening to God hiding himself and right now we're at right at the end of this sermon the breach we're right at the end of this listen it's just ten minutes a night together now watch when he comes to seven horns now when he saw this land John looking at it he it looked like had been slain or bloody so if you got your Bible revelation five six and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as have been slain having seven horns and seven seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth now so see brother Branham is saying you know John sees Jesus bloody like a lamb and he's come from eternity now look and he cease to be mediator so the people are thinking well if God's going to open the seals through you then mediations over on Sunday night after the seven seals preached right can you see how people could understand that could anybody see that I can clearly see it I'm not sure that's what he's saying but he said these words okay then pray to Mary as much as you want to there's no man in heaven or person nowhere nowhere else he could take it John even wept about it he said Oh Catholic friend don't pray to some dead person the Lambs only meat here see he was when it comes forth so see it just it sounds like program saying after the seals are open when Jesus comes and takes the book and loose the seals there's no more mediation can everybody see that that's what it looks like I'm not saying he meant that you know we'll see later what he says now look at this quote now this is the one somebody that left our church recently shared with me and tried to say there's no more salvation for denominations anymore only in the message and ice' agree with that I heartily disagree with that but this is the quote they use now the mystery of the book are revealed when the seals are broken and when the seals completely are broken the time of redemption is over because the lamb left the intercession booth to walk out to take his claims he was a mediator between that but when the real revelation happens on the seals they begin to break the lamb is coming forth from the sanctuary it's according to the word now here's what I wrote does he mean at the end of this sermon series in March of 63 or does he mean when they're when they're completely broken at the opening of the Seventh Seal or the rapture I believe the rapture right once the rapture goes the Bible says once the rapture goes Jesus snatches that's what the word catching up means Jesus snatches away his bride after that Satan and judgment fall right then there's no more mercy for the G for the Gentiles because the wrath of God is poured out of them but instead Jesus the Bible said in Romans 11 God blinded the Jews so the Gentiles can be saved after all the Gentiles are saved takes the blinders off of Israel and then they see Jesus and 144,000 are born again praise God that's what this is speaking of but I can see how people might stumble over it I wondered for a while Church maybe you did it but I wondered because if you study the quotes he says it a lot and you want to take what a prophet says wouldn't take it to heart right but the main answer is keep waiting on God that's usually the main answer right just wait upon the Lord he'll renew your strength now here's another one that's difficult to understand too he said as soon as the final name had been splashed in that Clorox of bleach then his intercessory days was over that him that's filthy be filthy still that's according revelation 22 11 at him that's filthy be filthy still him that's holy he's holy still see and he leaves the sanctuary and then it becomes a judgment seat woe unto those outside of Christ then but notice it's to be revealed when the lamb leaves his intercessory place from the father now that's revelation five and look what he just said well Ram said he leaves intercession in Revelation five but that can't actually be the truth right because we after the seals are open people still have to be saved used to how many only believe you're saying Amen yes you have to be able to be saved so see how brother man the way he brings out maybe just didn't bring it out the right way but see now he takes the book of the seals this the book of seals or a book seal with seals breaks them and shows them see at the end of the age now after the intercessor ease over the church ages has finished up now there he might be referring to after the rapture but church even this one is difficult because he said that's revelation 5 but the seals are open to revelation 6 right so see Church let's be kind with people because things can be confusing because he was growing in Revelation now this is what I told you about on Wednesday in November of 63 brother Brandon preached souls that were in prison now and showed how Jesus when he was crucified his body stay in the tomb his spirit went to hell and preach to those who rejected Noah right so he was preaching to people that were already lost and there's no way they could be saved and brother Graham believed that that would repeat here at Jesus's second coming mr. program teaches his message and says you know men perhaps the bride will have a ministry to the eternal Lost and makes it sound like it could be happening at that moment see he said I don't know what the this is true but it's got to be that way sometime he's talking about preaching these are no lost see it's got to come to that and it could be now in every way the world will carry right on people will still come to the altar still they're still crying out but it won't do them no good see they'll be gone see it'll be over there won't be no more mercy remember that and the Saints sure I become smokey he that's filthy filthy still he that's righteous righteous still he this whole he's holy still there's no more mercy when the lamb takes the book that's it see that's all of it and it looks a whole like it could be now so see could be he's trying his best to place the people so they're ready for the coming of the Lord amen and this is I listen to it again this week this is where brother and you can hear the women crying as brother Rams praying God don't let my children be loss save a Rebecca and Sarah and Joseph you can listen to it listen listen the end of the sermon the women are crying and crying out brother I was praying for his children Oh God may they not be lost may they be saved because he thinks time might be over he thinks the lamb might be off the intercessory or an accessory seat he says maybe we have another day maybe today's that day maybe tonight is the last night when that would shake us up if I came here and said this is the last day to get saved that would shake us up well let's get let's get them all saved maybe this is the last year I don't know friends I'm telling you I don't know it'll never be told me and then he said that I'll never be told because no man knows the day or the hour now a year later or yes less than a year later they said brother Ram have you made statements recently concerning the church age has ended Laodicea no I never said it's ended if I did you misunderstood or I said it wrong see this is the last church age it's the end of the church ages the Laodicea it hasn't ended when it ends the church is gone so as long as the church is here it hasn't ended praise God alright now let me go back now is that helped by God's grace that's why some people that we know friends love loved ones that we don't know have left because of those quotes and they think I'm not preaching the truth which that's fine they don't have to believe everything I say but just so you know that we've got to find the truth and all that I hate to see people Levi but worse I hate to see him going to sin I don't mind if they go to another Church but we want everybody in church but see that just so people understand like these are the some of the things that that we get that we get challenged on or we we've got to find an answer for and and we want we want the honest to goodness truth we want the truth straight from the Word of God amen praise God now here's four more statements here that it seems like brother Branham never said thus saith the Lord on but yet people that say he said the state the Lord on they have to be wrong but RAM said there's 700 Jews that didn't bow their knee to bail in the days of Elijah and then he said your bodies made of 80 percent water and petroleum and he said Judas never had faith but before he said he did and then Trinitarians are lost and then he said but other times he said they're saved okay I hope everybody's okay there's every okay today is this really making you think yeah it makes me think praise God now so that's uh I just I got some more things more quotes here I just don't want to miss some of these okay now in the fourth seal this is very plain brother branham tells us this here he says I'm gonna skip down to the boat trying to find my spot here thank you for your patience here enemy get caught up okay thank you so our preaching here in March brother branham accidentally said 700 Jews had not bowed their knees to bail so he says Elijah never knew even one of them was that way he thought he was the only one saved until God opened one of the seals and showed in the midst of the book and that had 700 that had never bowed down to them creeds that they had he said God opened the book to Elijah said now wait a minute I got 700 that's tucked around out there got their names in the book since the foundational world he said they're mine and program them brings it to the Jeffersonville people and he said don't you know God's got perhaps he's got 700 here in the tabernacle they're not bowed their knee to Mayo to see ya he says I'm gonna open up one of the seals and show you something you know I got 700 back there that ain't bout a knee or join any of them Creed's there's 700 of them ready for the rapture so people get all shook up Oh only 700 are gonna go in the rapture see cuz they're they're growing trying to understand how do you understand the Prophet and they had to learn not everything he said was thus saith the Lord but they shook him up should come up a lot cuz the Bible says yea I have left me seven thousand brother have said seven hundred the people get all shook it up Oh every word you know they wonder about every word but the Bible says seven thousand and then they asked him a few days later did you mean to say 7000 who not bowed their knee or 700 he said 7000 I meant to say forgive me for that it's just a manner of speech he goes on to say yeah forgive me please brethren you on the tape listen I didn't mean to say I'm a minister of the gospel many times I've preached that I know there was 7000 I just happened to say 700 I didn't mean just 700 I just didn't read it out of the scripture see just come to my mind while I was talking I just said 700 a 7000 I make them mistakes all the time all right so what does he do he humbles himself he says forgive me if I make a mistake now did he ever say they'll say thil or on any of these no so that's why it doesn't stumble me because we have so much such truth I already showed you the stay at the Lord's the mysteries the restored truce I mean we have so much truth but these are the things people stumble over and we've got to prove all things and rightly divide the word of God now here's a statement you know as I've been studying the message thirst 65 program said were 80% water and petroleum now program often taught were made up of the following elements he said petroleum when out Petroleum's a liquid mixture of hydrocarbons or it's a hydrogen and carbon compound found in rocks he said we're petroleum cosmic light which are cosmic rays they're almost as fast as light rays but they enter Earth's atmosphere from outer space he said calcium and potash potash is potassium compound from wood ashes okay so my dad says that's what we're made of he says it over and over again and some of those things may be true i but it doesn't seem like we're made of petroleum okay because look what he says here and if so you better go drink you some petroleum because he says and you've got to take those sources in to keep you so next time you get gas take a little sip yourself take some in yourself now see you wouldn't do that and we laugh right it's just a slip of the stuff of his memory right now science websites say we're made of oxygen atomic number eight hydrogen atomic number one carbon which but which remember it's kind of in some of those atomic number six nitrogen number seven and calcium he does have calcium that was number 20 and then phosphorus is atomic number fifteen okay so this is honestly just an honest mistake right it cannot be thus saith the Lord to keep taking in petroleum so you can survive because you've never taken in petroleum and yet you're surviving but yeah the people stand there and say every word is thus saith the lord not that cannot be thus saith the lord he just got his scientific terms mixed up and the church said okay see see we just catch you know you catch these things and just want to lay them out now in 65 brother branham said Judas never had any faith he said if Judas was to see the enemy discrepancy and also become flesh and dwelt among us and the person of Judas he never had no real faith real faith he had what he thought was a faith there's such a thing as having faith and a make-believe faith now for this for many years I believe this quote but then as I study the scripture I kind of changed I kind of went back to brother branham's previous teaching where he taught Judas did have real faith because here it is right here well I'm sorry now watch Judas Iscariot was justified by faith and believed on the Lord Jesus and was baptized and the Bible says the disciples believed John 2:11 now I could be wrong on this I could have the wrong doctrine so I just want to be humble and say I could be wrong but the side I'm taking now is that I believe Judas had real faith because the Bible said he believed the disciples believed he was judged by man he was justified remembered Jesus didn't baptize anybody other than the disciples but his disciples right and then disciples did all the other baptizing now here by RAM says plainly Judas believed the word okay but then another said one quote where he says he never had any faith to begin with so which one do you take well you can take whatever one you want does it pertain to salvation if you believe one of the other gonna be lost or saved no because your face not in question here Judas says faith is in question here and your faith is determined by what you believe and what you confess and what you live so this has nothing to do with salvation right but I believed you just did have genuine faith like these quotes say I just think maybe he changed his mind at the end well Graham said they said was Judas Iscariot's name blot off the lands book of life or wasn't even on it yes it was on it and blotted out okay next this one here all right now here's the one believe the sign really Labor's on they tried to say that brother Graham taught all Trinitarians are lost now I think if you I think if you think about this scripture this quote I think it makes sense because he's talking about revelation okay but let's read it here he said Jesus he said jesus said except you believe that I am he you will die in your sin he is the revelation of God the spirit of God revealed in human form you can't believe that you're lost you put them a third person or a second or any of the person besides God you're lost now see I think it how you interpret this because remember Jesus asked Peter who do men say that I am and he said flesh and blood has not revealed this so Peters faith in Christ was based upon revelation right it was based upon revelation and Peter had revelation of he believed in Jesus Christ he did miracles but he still wasn't born again right so I can see some truth in this whereas if you turn down the revelation of believing in Jesus Christ you're lost but I don't believe that every Trinitarian is lost and again Church I'll just be humble I could be wrong on this but I believe God can save Trinitarians it's because there's more quotes and scripture on the other side than for this side and that's and I'm not going to taking sides against brother Branham you understand I'm taking sides against the way people interpret this quote from brother Branham because look what he says here remember he is is where he says Trinitarian is trinitarianism the belief is wrong it's of the devil thus saith the Lord but he says do you believe all these Trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they're Christians they asked brother Branham you said the rapture just be a small number he said what about the people that believe in the Lord but don't believe the way you preach they don't have to believe this they don't have to believe the way I preach it see don't have to believe that for the last day message will they be saved yes if they believe the Lord Amen so bro man says you don't have to follow me to be saved see any man would say that praise God any man his right mind would say that it's not knowing any man that makes you say this knowing the man Jesus Christ that makes you saved and I like what he adds in here though because I believe this is true if you won the baptism of Holy Ghost you have to hear this message because in acts 19 Apollo's church in Ephesus could not receive the Holy Ghost until they heard pop reach the Holy Ghost they had to receive the prophet of that hour Amen Alleluia that's what I believe to go in the rapture you have to receive the revelation of God you don't know how to know brother Branham but I think if you get the Holy Ghost you'll pretty soon find out about him because you want to know where those revelations came from right but it's not knowing brother Branham his life knowing Jesus Christ his life amen but then you but you can't escape the fact that God always sent a man to teach the latest revelation of his word he always did Noah Moses and and Jesus and Joshua you know you you named him Paul you Martin Luther John Wesley name of all God I said a man and you had to receive the word that he was preaching now like we says next if they disagree I don't believe he's a word I don't believe this is right I don't believe in the bat until he goes that shows where they're headed for the tribulation but those who can accept the word in his fullness not me preaching it because it's the Bible says so there it is right there look he says it's not about me so much it's about what the Bible says those who accept that is free because the words already been judged amen Alleluia he said but if Catholic Pentecostal Baptist Presbyterian whatever if he's solidly trusting in Jesus Christ he saved because it's by faith are you saved and that by Gracie Catholics can be saved Baptists can be saved Pentecostals are saved because that we all accept what Christ did for us that's right it's our own personal faith in a finished work that Christ did for us so see to take that one quote from anointed ones at the end time for the Amen you got to throw a lot of others to take that one and then you got to throw up the word where Jesus saves people at the white throne judgment and they're surprised like when did I ever do anything good for a Christian Jesus when did I ever do anything good for you so they never even knew what where Christ was they didn't know Christ was living in his people praise God but they were good to his people you say brother Ram I'm a Catholic I don't care a Catholic can be saved as anything is that pretty clear Church I'm Baptists all right well I'm Pentecostal a Pentecostal can be saved just like anybody else could be a man raised God hallelujah glory now you know I missed something for Judas go back to Luke eight if you got your scripture there Luke eight I think it's Luke eight 13 or eleven if I could remember from my notes yeah it's Luke eight thirteen yeah I forgot to say this can people believe and then be lost yes the Bible said they can believe for a while and then reject it and the Bible calls it stomping underfoot like like publicly stomping on something you used to believe that's what the Bible calls it so can I lose my salvation no if you're a real believer you can't lose your salvation head out of there so it depends which lens you're looking through if we're looking through a humble era a backslider like judas yeah they can lose it but if you're looking at you or a believer no it's impossible for you to lose your salvation amen it depends which side your own it's impossible for me to be lost if I'm a real genuine believer and if you say that once saved always saved you got a big problem because Jesus says I are Jesus told Moses God told Moses I'm gonna blot out all those who sinned against me who built that uh that golden calf member Moses had blocked me out and he said no Moses I appreciate that as a mediator he said but I will blot out all those who sinned against me he said he was going to blot him out their names were on some record of life but he said I'm gonna blot them out for their idolatry and then you can see how Ephraim was still the one Ephraim and Dan their names get blotted off of the tribe list right you can see it plainly from Deuteronomy to revelation 7 there's worse than and Ephraim they're blotted out because of idolatry but the merciful God brings those two brothers back because God saved those two brothers amen their tribes might have been brought out but those two brothers came back with all their followers they'd come back for the Millennium praise God hey man see God didn't forget the real believer yeah Luke 813 Church they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy this is like Judas he got so excited when he first saw Jesus Messiah and these have no root which for a while believe he believed for three years three or more and the time of temptation fall away he got tempted by money and he got tempted and he sold out the Bible said he was seeking an opportunity to betray Jesus and you know what that's the same word where Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God so it shows Judas broke the command he should have been seeking God's welfare instead of his own welfare and that shows where does your seeking come from your soul you know what Sikh means brother amen it means to aim at and strive for so he said aim at the kingdom of God first everyday strive strive for the kingdom of God first Judas did it for a number of days right but at some point he stopped striving for the kingdom of God he started he stopped aiming at the kingdom of God and he started aiming at money and yet he kept going to the revival services and kept going to healing services but his aim had changed he was aiming for money and taking care of himself rather than aiming for Christ's welfare so there scripture church there's plain scripture Luke 8 you can believe for what and these are Jesus's words read letter words and yet this scripture agrees with what Jesus said that no man shall be able to pluck my children out of the father's hand amen because if you're a real believer you'll never lose your salvation praise God nobody can pluck you out because God knows you'll keep his faith to the end and also God's holding you as well praise God thank the Lord yes sir Matthew 25 shows anybody can be saved I've said it before Muslim Hindu I believe that they can be saved if they do something good for a Christian Jesus will say when you did it to the Christian you did it to me I believed that I could be wrong but I believe that's very scriptural all right now a few more let me go a little bit longer here by God's grace now you we've heard this before I'd rather have the right spirit with the wrong doctrine and that's true but we should aim for both praise God let me read this from 61 to answer your question now I do not take either sides with you brother and I know as long as you fuss you're both wrong so see it's okay to differ with people you just can't fuss and argue about it that's why I'm glad I've you know I've had meetings with people that have left and I never did by God's grace I never did fuss with him one time we just chose to agree to disagree and that's what I want I want to be a real Christian praise God whether it's on the phone or face-to-face I don't want to fuss I don't want to argue with people I want to stand on God's truth praise God he says long as you fuss you're both wrong because I'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my doctrine and wrong in my heart see I said after all it's your heart's condition and I made that a practice to know this that if a man no matter what he does and how much he difference difference and what he says about me if in my heart not from a duty but from my heart I can't love that man as well as I love anyone else that I know there's something wrong in here because it's all about love now remember church here the Bible said if any man jesus said this is Jesus is worth If any man does God's will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself see the people that do the message that obey the message will be able to recognize true message doctrine because it'll be Bible based dr. C because as you receive the doctrine it's like the word is washing you when you receive the word it's like water washing you it's brainwashing you praise God it's washing out all the false doctrine and then with all the dirt out and you see you see plainly the word of God what it says and if you do God's will and obey it you'll know the true doctrine say second John 1:9 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not the doctrine of Christ hath not God so see only the people that keep the doctrine that have the right doctor have the right spirit amen that's bruising right there but there's other scriptures approve it glory if you abide in Christ you have the right doctrine he that abideth and doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and the son so church we can have both and we should strive for both we should strive for the right doctrine and the right spirit because the Bible says abide in the doctrine and now look it'll say abiding the love of God - look if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love so see the Bible says both you can't say it doesn't you have to abide in the right doctrine you have to teach the right thing and you also have to abide in the love of God and you can't love God without loving his people even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love he that loveth his brother abideth in a light and there's none occasion of stumbling in him amen see that means he sees all the devil's tricks Amen ha ha ha he sees all the traps Satan sets worn by the bank and he's able to maneuver with skill praise God which it which is wisdom amen he's able to maneuver around the devil's traps and be an overcomer and be a conqueror amen hallelujah he doesn't stumble in the sins this is someone the false doctrine because he's got the love of God oh thank you Lord first John 3:14 we know we passed from death unto life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death okay so we C F to have both you have to buy to the doctrine here the Bible says abiding the doctor and you have to buy it in love now right brother bands right you'd rather have them I'd rather have the right spirit I'd rather have love if my doctrine is wrong but the reality is we can have both and every Christian should have both you know Paul yeah yeah you know Peter had both later let's go get another one yeah here's the scripture where he says a new commandment Jesus says I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one to another now Peter had the right doctrine because look the Bible says after Peter baptized some of them they continued in the Apostles doctrine their teaching from the Word of God and here the after he was arrested these Jews are charging him and said did we not command you not to teach in his name and behold you filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us see you can't set you can't separate doctrine and love a real Christian who's got the real love of God abides in love and then abides in the true doctrine of Christ alright let me go a few more minutes here by God's grace now Lord willing I'll be going a little bit more deeper on these but I just want to read these two so you're aware secondly the tape church movement promotes blind faith in every word of brother Branham and these are exact quotes I have the recordings and the dates on most of these sermons that were preached their church says we don't care what it says on them tapes we believe it I don't have to explain it I don't have to understand it I just have to believe it we don't know what the truth is unless you listen to the tapes that's so different from the Bible because the Bible Jesus said the Bible is truth right they say we don't care that's what they're they're pastors and leaders say we don't care what's on the tapes we believe it all well then you believe you need some petroleum to drink for lunch today now hey I mean I hate to say that but Church that's what that's what they're saying we don't care what it says no I do care because I got to try every spirit praise God right now we know program has the right spirit but we know he's not infallible who else would leave you know his for three children he's got three little children he leave him he leave his wife and children for months at a time to go preach around the world fast and and get so weak till you lose weight in a 120-pound man and prayed pray all night sometimes for people just all night these three Hollywood preachers today don't do that they don't have the honesty and the sincerity like the prophet of Godhead see so we're not questioning about an sincerity we know he's sincere but we know not every word he says is thus saith the Lord and we don't want to miss understand what he says right like how easy would it be for us in a small church like us how easy would it be for us to say anyone that says God is two or three persons are there lost and going to hell that would be really easy for in a church like ours our size and we could put that attitude and that'd be the wrong attitude now we we what a misunderstood the quote I believe because I believe he's saying the same thing Peter had Peter had the revelation of it Jesus was the Christ and so he that he was saved but see we do care what's said on the tape we do but they don't care what's on the tape and I could play that for like I said I've saved them and I saved them on my hard drive and on the cloud in case my hard drive goes out and I got a external hard drive to back it up so I got three copies now I read this earlier but see buh-bam says those who can accept the word in its fullness not me because not me preaching it but because the Bible says so see program's totally opposite of what they're saying they're saying I don't care what it says believe everything on the tape but I saying no don't believe me just because I said it believe it because it's in the word number three this church their church says the token is both the tapes and being a tape Church so they made the token two different things when it's neither of those these are exact quote they the preachers got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you got to there the token the tapes of the token so the token is actually right now on my phone then if that's the case the holy ghost bat is only ghost my phone's baptized with the Holy Ghost I just caught it right there that's what they said the tapes are the token they're the token for the bank how come my phone had the Holy Ghost and not my children yeah how's that possible see how foolish that is they say Rahab had to show her token she said I'm a tape Church that's the token I'd say it's real important to say that we're a taped Church so they take a few quotes from the token message and in September of 63 and they make it sound like when when Rahab threw out the red scarlet Corps that that was the taste but that wasn't that was the blood of Christ amen which we know the blood of Christ today the life in the blood is the Holy Spirit see that's what they get that's that's see there perhaps or leadership they listen to tapes and that's what they get but we listen to tape and we get the right doctrine amen so what do we need the right spirit and that's why I made the video i'ma let you guys watch it to when I get that video done for the the sons of brother RAM I'll let you watch it I try to say brothers I try to say it Jose I said precious brothers I hope you understand I tried to humble myself I said I could be wrong I said correct me if I'm wrong I try to be real gentle I recorded it yesterday I'm not trying to exalt myself we got to have the right the only way they'll know we're Christians is if we love each other praise God it's the only way we'll know they'll know rather we'll know because we got the right doctrine and the love but they don't know the world will know because we love each other so much like I chaired with a little example with my family last week last week we went to Panera one day and so amen and who I'm gonna just give you guys little rose for a minute here we went to Panera enough the two old women sat across from us and we started talking to me in front of the children kind of making fun of our family size and I just tried to smile and say I just try to smile on what I say said oh they're all blessings that it's all good by God's grace children might remember it and we were all you know my wife and I I was a little down you know why these demons got a why they got a torment us for having probe a in the Bible where does the Bible ever say limit your children it doesn't now doesn't say race either we're not trying to race but whereas the Bible say it's okay to have a surgery when you when you get enough kids and you you don't want anymore it's not about how many you want it's how many God wants to send ya all these people to say oh yeah God told me I'm done it - God told me - I'm done it three God told me I'd done it four and yet you ask him about doctrine so apparently they can hear the word of God about their number children but they can't hear the doctrine about how they should dress and how they should do their hair strange isn't it and the Bible says exactly what they should do with their hair and what their doctor huh oh so you can hear God's voice so clearly there but you can't hear with your other it's a hypocritical thing Church many times and I'm not trying to you know exalt myself or Pat myself on the back I'm just trying to be honest what is the word of God say anyways two days later Amen and hooah we went out to eat and and they told us what a nice family we were and all the peace and we treat us so nicely last Sunday remember that you guys remember that I just hope my wife afterwards I was so happy you know the children were so happy fellowship with Wendy and Amen and hula and I wish we could fellowship more often with everybody you know I thought my two days after just being made fun of we get treated so good see cuz Christians will know each other by their love I thought what a good example we're mocked one day a couple of days later we're blessed I took the children yesterday to get the van fixed and one of the black real nice black guy come out he said I just want to tell you don't know if the Turner silence he said but your children are the best children I've ever seen behaved since I've been here so I didn't tell the children that but you know I said well I said give all the credit to two people I said God and my wife he's like that's a good thing to say you sir real nice guy but see it's love it's love so I just thought I'd share cuz you know we get attacked we get you know a little made fun of little little little things but God has a way for his love to shine out through us like when I remember when Naomi sent me the birthday song for was it Harris's birthday and all the girls they just saw they'd have it that's love they felt the love right when the walkers come and visit we feel the love right Christians love one another praise God so see we got the right doctrine and the right spirit and I kind of went to sit went through a lot of different things to get to that point but I hope you understand him so see now this is what they say the being of a sermon one time I like to welcome everybody to the lines then they're calling their church the lines in now I would never want to say that that shows you what shows you like how deceived they are like these are just going over their heads the pastor said welcome to the lion's den where we say it's the word which is the tapes or nothing so they put the tapes of William Randall on the same level as the Bible which we don't do that no we put the Bible above everything and then when we hear about Graham say something on tape we go back to the Word of God right like it if we had all the words of st. Paul we would never put all of st. Paul's words on equal footing we put all of st. Paul's words under now he had the privilege of writing the Bible so some of his words are the Bible okay some of it but all his common words just talking and you know sharing testimonies speaking of his common words we would never exalt them to equal we would say the Word of God is above every every thought of every person of every prophet right now to give them there they were mentioning Amos 3:7 where the Bible said the Prophet this God does nothing but he reveals a secret to the servants the prophets because a lions roaring but still why would you ever place yourself calling yourself the Lions Den who's the Lions then either that means either the church is full of prophets right or brother Branham was the was the true Daniel and everybody else in the church is lions you see what you see what you do there it just doesn't fit the types right just like the type of Joseph brother have son being the Joseph of the Old Testament where they say Joseph was feeding everybody who was starving like they said the bride is starving that's what they're saying the the bride's starving but Joseph's wife was never starving Joseph's wife was with him in the palace praise God it doesn't fit the type it's just misinterpreted right it's a misinterpretation so that to me is a misinterpretation I'm almost done here this is one I mentioned on Wednesday they make a Joseph Branham a prophet without proof now here's a quote you should understand when I dedicated him his youngest son Joseph to the Lord the morning there was many little baby standing up and had mothers with them along the altar when I picked up Joseph in my arms not thinking what I was saying I said Joseph my son thou art a prophet that's my prayer anyhow does that sound like his thus saith the Lord no that's my prayer anyhow if you've got a thus saith the Lord it's not anyhow and I believe it'll be someday God will take everything he ever gave me and double it times double and put on that boy and then leave and sorry when then when I leave he'll take my place now Joseph is 65 years old he better get goin fast if he's gonna double times double everything by the ran did he bet it now it's possible it's possible but he better go like I told that brother I said you let me know when he starts doing prayer lines double the brother and because I want to become and be part of it and he said oh no you got the wrong understanding I said I'm just saying what the tapes say hey now look what he says now he says this was earlier he said Rebecca might take his place someday which we know she did it she never preached he never had prayer lines you know George Smith was her husband Hina they never had prayer lines you know like where she was discerning people taking brother Ana's place that never happened but brother man hoped it would he said maybe he said all night long I couldn't get that possum off my mind the next morning I went out as I started out little Rebekah who I believe is maybe or going to maybe take my place someday did she know she didn't take mother's place praying for the sick and prayer lines and discernment she's seen her first vision recent just recently and she's very tender hard little thing when I went out to that porch about seven o'clock the Sun was rising to see if there's anybody out there there was not and the first thing you know about my side was little Rebekah she said daddy what about the old possum I just dreamed of her all night now she might have had a dream it looks like she had a dream about the opossum but did she ever do prayer lines and started discerning like brother Branham did with the visions no it never happened you can ask her husband widower he's alive today you can ask him he said maybe see he maybe was hoping Joseph would take his place to continue their ministry he was hoping maybe maybe Rebecca will take my place someday I hope so now look he tells again about dedicating Joseph and dedication that little boy at the altar I said I was inspired to say Joseph thou art God's prophet and maybe look again maybe when I leave I pray that a double portion of the Spirit will come upon Joseph for the age to come if there is one maybe see he thinks it's the Holy Spirit right he thinks it's the Holy Spirit like I've thought I thought the Holy Spirit maybe heard some of our prayers sometimes I thought for sure we were gonna see a instant miracle and maybe I didn't I mean I can't recall specific one but I know there's times I felt like my God heard our prayers and even though I just because I felt it was the Holy fear doesn't mean that it was see just cuz program felt maybe he was inspired memory said I was inspired to say 77 to remember that he said with divine inspiration I believe the world systems will end by 1977 see he's just trying to be he's just trying to find the will of God he just tried to understand God's will for his life and his son's life last one I think yeah that's the last one I think oh my yeah here's what they say they make a tape Church mandate they say every Church in this message if you claim to believe this message one or not one it or not you're a tape Church if you believe this message you're a tape Church it's just the way it is there's men of God that have true callings of God on their lives they preach this message with all their heart but they got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you got to Amen they're the token okay now remember I don't have the caught up here but their pastor called anyone who was wondering about should I preach or play tapes he called him a make believer so that classifies us if we've ever wondered now I don't wonder about it but if we ever did wonder well should we play tapes or let the pastor preach he said if you're wondering you're a make believer you're not a true believer now let's just show our love here okay that's a sure love but someone calls you a name how quickly do you want to call them a name back well love should stop us from doing that so they're gonna call us make believers well that's it s why sure hope they're real believers by God's grace can you say that with love in your heart I can I sure hope and I say that's why I send the video I sure hope you guys can repent and see the truth then not every word your dad said was the state the Lord try to do it with love now there's only two quotes on tape churches right there's this big emphasis we need to everyone needs to be taped churches did you know there's only two quotes on it and brother Graham gives he gives it okay under two conditions there's no preacher and there's no church where you live those are the only conditions of having to take Church brother branham we have no preacher where we live but we have tape service on Sunday night only should we take our children to another church for Sunday school or the tape service is sufficient well let that be according the way your children are going now if you get your children they're young and you get them out in some kind of a group out there they'll just pound that stuff into them they shouldn't no I wouldn't do it if they seem to learn enough for the tapes and things and you say you put them over in the Catholic Church take them over to Catholic Church take them to something like that I wouldn't advise that but now if you got a nice little Church over there that maybe disagree two or three things with you and your children wants to go to Sunday school there full gospel people or something well that's perfectly all right but see when you got I'm sorry when you come to a place depends on how your children take it see watch what your children does how they react to it now here's the quota this is the one I was listening this morning Bob Arum said I am so misunderstood I don't know why people think I don't even believe the people going to church that's a million miles from the truth we must assemble ourselves together that much more as we see the Day approaching if I lived in a city and there nothing there but well some church I don't want to call a name with just any church if they only believe one thing that Jesus was divine all the rest of it was wrong I'd go to that church did you catch that if the church is ninety-nine percent wrong but they got one thing right I'd still go to that church see his example wasn't to sit at home and play tapes of his own tapes he said if I can't get a hold off I'll take a slice hey yeah see I'll go listen well I didn't say I'll go take my tapes to be played I'll go listen worship the Lord and show them that I'm doing my part to glad church you are showing God you're doing your part this morning you're gathering together more as you see that day approach you're not sitting at home or sitting at the bar waiting for the big football games today or the basketball games you're not there you're doing your part you're supporting the kingdom of God you're seeking first the kingdom of God in His righteousness I want him to know I'm alive huh so your attitude towards church shows God that you're alive I want everybody to know what side I'm on I assemble with the Christians and then worship and serve the Lord I'm a host then you've been a good audience bear with me oh this is just it's a harder kind of a message I know I know but I know it's helpful Church it's helpful to me yeah I know it's helpful to you too now brother have said see it's so it's used to bother me so bad I found out even our Lord was misunderstood in so many things I guess it just has to be that way like this but those who are wise will understand it the Bible said so they'll catch it man the lies where you will hear the word and believe it praise God they'll make their selves ready for the rapture see people that like I said on Wednesday anyone who desires truth anyone that's thirsty whosoever will let him come there's nothing God will not let anything stop them from hearing the truth if they really want to go in the rapture they're gonna go in the rapture I don't care what country they're in I don't care where they're from if they've got a deep call there's got to be a deep to respond amen remember the wrap dress that be of every nation all nations there's to be some believer that has to make that rapture how do you know because a revelation 7 says there's a Gentile multitude the Bob said of all nations kid drugs tons and people waving the palms and falling down and worshiping Jesus and they wash their robes right in the blood of Christ amen oh don't worry about the wise the wise will catch it in anybody who wants somebody be there they'll be there now here's the other one where he says it's okay to play tapes let's see if you don't have a church to go to should you just listen to the tapes yes that's that'd be fine that's all he says so there's two conditions that do take churches no preachers and no church well we've got both here so well I don't have to play the tapes praise God we don't have to we meet all the conditions praise God so see there's only two and see though they take these and they take take them way too far can everybody see how they're going off to these huge extremes it's got a couple more here here's what they say many critics without revelation say brother Brown never said play tapes in the church and here's where they were misinterpreting another scripture that's called ears but can't hear so now they're name-calling us again now we rise a ax 6 where it says they have eyes but can't see and ears that can't hear did you catch that in other words they're saying we're spiritually blind we're spiritually brought blind because we say oh brother I've never said play the tapes in the church others say we just believe the Bible and don't say in the Bible either well I've got news for both of you it does say in the Bible Jesus himself said play tapes in your local churches now go to revelation 22:16 this is what their pastor preaches in church they are adding to the word and that's why I pray for them to repent with the right spirit they said Jesus and you should hear the people clap they haven't even heard the scripture the pastor's gonna use and they already started screaming in clap but he's gotta say okay take a seat okay because they give him a standing ovation every time you said something about tapes how tapes and not preachers tapes enough and they just all stand in clapping they say okay so that's an answer because it's a spirit rotation 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star did you see anything in there about playing tapes in the churches that's what they teach they say that scripture says preachers need to stop preaching and only play the tapes he says there it is right there in the word see what those churches are says local churches now he's using a Scofield Bible there because the word churches if you look in your Scofield Bible it says local yeah but that's just Scofield opinion that's not what the Greek says he sent his angel to preach and the churches and the only way can do that is by pressing play playing this message this is the will the Lord look.we says it's the perfect will the Lord stay with this word now that's quite a statement and he's and that pastor says twice I've got it on tape he said thus saith the Holy Spirit he said thus saith the Lord he said playing tapes is the perfect will of God now that's quite a statement right there that means we are if he's right we're in the permissive will of God by having preachers come and by having a pastor preach do you think you're in the permissive will of God no I think I'm in the perfect will of God how do you know because my life matches Paul's gospel amen their life does not because brother man because brother am his own father taught they said if you are not saying what Paul said therefore you are false anyone who changes what Paul said is false and as a liar and that's hard we've got to say in love let's say into our feet he said you will know the prophet of the last days yes you will for he is of God and he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate it deviate from it that word for a moment not by one iota he said the last day prophet will be saying get back to the word or you are lost is that scriptural absolutely Paul said preach the word in all seasons feeling happy preach the word feeling discouraged preach the word feel like the other revival preach the word feeling a million miles from the revival preach the word anyway amen Paul said preached the Lord in season out of season and it will accomplish all this determined to do can you say Amen to that church musicians if you'll come to change one word is to be a false teacher of God's Word now I have a little bit more to go I've got two more false doctrines I want to show from that camp maybe a few more and then I want to go over to the other side so this is the camp that goes into idolatry of brother Branham the other camp rejects all programs teachings and there are going to the side of lust because you can see it in their lives after they leave the message they open up the door to immoral close in more lifestyle drinking smoking movies and all kinds of evil so where are we Church we're standing right in the middle holding God's standard waving God's standard praise God that this is a real this is the undefiled life praise God this is how a believer lives not out there in idolatry that out their lust but they live their life and righteousness aren't you glad for that please God thank the Lord let's bow our heads here for with a prayer church of theirs absolutely anything ever question on please our our our Saints here who attend church here please don't hesitate to contact me of course pray seek the Lord but if you have any questions please let me know about it I'll do my best to answer them [Music] we're fortunate people that God has given us the word we have to stand against these waves of boss dr. but jesus said jesus said i'm sending these five gifts to the earth to bring the the believers to a unity in the faith that's what we see happening today don't it's that we're a prayer evany father lord we're thankful for this word i went long lord and materials difficulties but lord necessary to prove all things Lord you sent your prophet honest it's coming down to a showdown and the showdown will be between between Jesus and the denomination and Jesus is the word your prophet also taught that in the last days like the days of the three Hebrew children a man will be exalted as an idol tempting the people of God to bow down in worship that man Lord we're not going to bow down to worship any man we're going to give all of our worship to you having fun we're to give you all the praise all the glory we know the prophecy we know what it's coming down to so we see this Lord as a time of sharpening the Bible says that a man's sharpen it the confidence for the sharpen one another in love the Lord as we read today let us abide in love and abide the doctor we know both the possible we only have one let us have love but not if you can't allow your grace we believe we'll have both if we're born to gain now bless your people or whatever happy dove I pray you'd help them Lord to continue believing you confess the word have patience Lord they need prayer Lord God here there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] third time leave these times are causing us to go back to the work let me know that Jesus bride is going to be a word by let me know that word word word line upon line precept upon precept Ray's doc if you see me getting off please tell me I'm doing all my never all my laboring I'm doing it to slow with the word of that let's have the right spirit praise God will live the right doctrine and have the right scoot rather than that might disagree it's changing [Music] [Music] [Music]
