sorry genesis 49 21 i'm sorry 49-21 i'm sorry i was looking at the the birth scriptures and mixing them up genesis 49 21 that's right sorry one verse said about naphtali as at least right here according to his father jacob read that together one two three now if tali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words he's a deer that's set free and he gives good words strange doesn't sound strange this is what you speak about your son you're a deer let loose you're just running all over the mountains right just having your liberty having your freedom and you speak good things wonderful things what a prophecy we're going to look to that tonight here by god's grace let's go to philippians 2. it seems mysterious right but as you start thinking about christ and start thinking about the word it's all going to come together by the grace of the lord philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. praise the lord i was praying this i think it was yesterday morning this morning i'm saying lord just show me better how i can esteem others better than myself like how can i make brother william more important than me how can i make my children more important than me how can i esteem them better than myself i take care of myself i feed myself i brush my teeth but how can i esteem others better than myself how many want a better revelation of that praise god eternal life living for others but what is that i want to know more about that praise god philippians two let's read verses two and three ready 1 2 3 fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves i think verse 4 kind of gives us a greater revelation right look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others praise god so church if you're aware of somebody that doesn't have something let me know or you know you you can do something too praise god let's have a word of prayer how many want that uh that desire to esteem others better than yourself let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you god for this wonderful night thank you for the saints who pressed their way out to the house of god and lord we just ask you lord you're the the the guest of honor here tonight for lord for without you coming without you helping us lord that we've just

that our minds could be able to prove the perfect will of god here tonight lord and bless these requests we prayed for lord the sick heal the sick in jesus name lydia lord god and jean and amen and huh keep them healthy and safe by the grace of god for the healing powers of the holy spirit are present and alive and just as powerful as they ever were so in jesus name we pray you touch each and every one and the unspoken needs lord minister to those little hearts lord god and we just pray for the government that we can live peaceably lord and bring all all those that are disobedient lord to repentance if they can find it lord and lord that we can live peaceable lives and finish the great commission for your glory in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as being seated praise god okay so let's look here to the word of god here tonight i trust this is going to be a blessing to you um you know i just like to uh real quick if you got your bible let's you know i i just found it interesting on two or three emails and and then a few conversations uh this is way off topic but i just want to remind you you know uh people people have come to me three times at least in the last few weeks and um they're like am i even saved and i'm like yes it's a free gift so let's just read over those scriptures can we let's just read over these uh verses because i just want our church to be encouraged you know sometimes we get mind battles and like these three people have either emailed or talked to face to face uh satan can just you know corner us right he can corner us and make us feel so bad you know and trap us in our thoughts and oh look at you look look at your sin look and no doubt we can look at our sin and we're ashamed of ourselves no doubt about it but the fact still remains that we're saved by grace through faith right that fact can never be taken away but satan gets us in the corner it makes us feel like oh you're not even saved and look at what you do and look how you look how you failed here failed there and church let's just be honest we fail all the time that's why we need a salvation that's why we need a lamb praise god but i just thought it'd be helpful to encourage us you know here tonight we can look to some of these scriptures here malachi can you read uh 15 and 16 for us so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of god the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many and not as it was by the one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation the free gift is of many offenses amen so no notice twice did you see that twice it calls it a free gift free how many like getting gifts you children like getting gifts on christmas birthday everybody like it i like getting gifts too but that's what the bible the bible literally says that language how many of you like salvation's free a free gift to you is it that special is it that wonderful i just want to remind you i emailed a woman through sanctification baptism of holy ghost if you want to be fully filled with the life of christ that takes a little process but just being saved is like freely receiving a christmas gift and uh this you know this i just found these particular scriptures to be a help to about three people just within the last week that we just need reminders many times that god is so loving he just wants to offer this as a free gift i like what the bible says there through jesus christ this free gift has abounded to many amen hallelujah many people have received this free gift over the course of the 2000 years right since uh christianity was was birthed on the day of pentecost praise god but it's a free gift uh and uh the bible says the free gift is of many offenses unto justification listen we have many offensive you i've you have many failures if you follow me along a lot around enough you're gonna find many offenses but that doesn't take away from the free gift of god amen that in fact that magnifies how great god's grace is and it says many offenses unto justification praise god amen just i just i just want to just remind you those few things here and i'm going to read 17 first by one man's offense death reign by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ so once you receive the gift you're so grateful by that gift you reign over sin right because you've got a gift you have grace you have favor because i favor i'm now reigning over sin in my life because i received jesus christ's great gift to me amen as one of offense uh judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one man the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life amen because one man all died but because of one man all live and all can be saved amen a free gift so three times church three times paul says it yeah in a matter of a few breaths we'd say he's reminding us of this free gift praise god hallelujah so it's by it wasn't by our obedience we're made righteous can i just emphasize that by the obedience of one many shall be made righteous i'm not righteous by my works it's the works of christ that makes me righteous amen and the devil he can't argue with this amen hallelujah he can't argue with that that's the unfailing unchanging word of god amen and if i've received the gift of god then i'm justified amen i'm made righteous in his sight through the work of christ all i have to do is repent amen i just got to repent and then the bible says that grace did much more bound to us praise god through the grace of jesus christ amen sinneth reigned unto life even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord church what is reigning in our lives our lives are reigning by grace praise god grace is protecting our lives grace is is giving us jesus righteousness it's given us favor in heaven so let's be thankful for the free gift tonight can we give god a round of applause for the free gift of god's grace three scriptures church it's a free gift praise god and it just is bestowed upon us amen hallelujah and of course it was by a predestination god knew you'd want it that's why he sent it to you hallelujah all right i just want to start with that because i was so strike i was praying about that i'm like my goodness three people have asked me this week am i saved and what's wrong and i've just the holy spirit's brought me back to that scripture it's a free gift there's nothing you did to do it it was christ's righteousness that gave it to you amen the substitution right the substitutionary replacement he was your substitute and therefore his righteousness comes upon you amen all right now i showed this on sunday night i think i don't think i showed it on sunday morning but there's at least two of the tribes that had prophecy about land that i've studied so far in the blue zebulun uh he's at the haven of the sea and i haven't preached on zebulun yet but the bible says he's by the sea and you can find him on the map that's exactly where he's by he's right by the sea uh and also mentions the mountain so there's one particular mountain in his region i don't know which one it is yet because i haven't studied it but the bible lists that issachar's kind of questionable um it mentions kind of a pleasant land and the mountain again with zebulun so they they're pretty close together asher mentions bread and yield from the ground but not much on lunch about his land in particular and then gad pardon me mentions a portion of the lawgiver uh does this portion mean judah's land i don't know now we're looking at tonight here we're looking at naphtali i hope i'm saying that right everybody says it different everything i've read and listened to they all say different you know so i'm just going the best i can i'm not a hebrew so at least not physically the bible says naftali is to possess thou the west and the south so that gives us some direction right some placement in the land and asher mentions he had his foot in oil i haven't studied this one out yet but maybe the lord willing sunday we'll get to this one what does that mean i'm not quite sure what that means because oil get it from a few different places right you get it from the ground but the most common way they got it was from the fig tree right or i'm sorry the olive tree the olive trees where they would get oil from the olives right so that's interesting oh so we'll get to that now so from my studies to date there's nothing prophesied about land for reuben simeon levi judah benjamin and dan so half of the brothers at least what i can see so far there's no mention of land okay but there is mention about warnings and blessings all right so the ones we covered so far i put in red so we preached on reuben uh levi judah simeon and dan and so let's just review those briefly reuben was the oldest but he was disgraced and actually demoted from his oldest child position all the authority as priests of the family and the blessings he was all demoted from that for a sexual sin right and he was never able to really get the victory over that he was unstable as water right we saw that on sunday that we don't always can anchor in the word of god amen but see reuben was disgraced and he ultimately came to shame as far as his tribe now he himself was saved but ultimately he didn't have a blessing because he turned on the blessing okay and we looked at simeon and levi and we saw how they both were together they were partners in crime but one was disgraced simeon and the other one was exalted levi and god was showing his mercy and god was so merciful that god gave him uh the position of priests in the family praise god uh to minister there in the presence of god with the urim and thumb amen and the ark of the covenant and we also saw how judah he took the lead he was exalted because he was such a wonderful son he was exalted to the lead so god pulled down reuben and raised up judah and gave judah the biggest portion of land because judo was going to have amazing testimony out of out of judah became great men like caleb right afnil and all the way down to david and then solomon and all the good kings jehoshaphat right all the uh all these great kings asa good man of god josiah wonderful men of god god saw that in their lineage that they were going to produce those great things amen and so god exalted judah and said even the messiah i'm going to give judah the scepter praise god and and he will reign with the scepter until shiloh come and that was christ amen and then christ come and then now christ can i say it tonight christ has the scepter tonight amen hallelujah he's the one ruling in the kingdom of god praise god and we have the name of jesus christ that's what we rule by today amen right the lord the name of the lord is the strong tower the righteous run into it and they are saved amen so christ still has the scepter tonight amen but he's in heaven he's ruling in heaven and his rule has come down to the bride of jesus christ who's ruling the kingdom of god here on the earth until the tribulation period hallelujah now dan had a nice start with uh samson had a nice 20-year reign but uh but then of course he was lived a life that was constantly back and forth but then ultimately after uh samson not long after that he was his tribe was disgraced with idolatry we read this on sunday night where dan let uh king jeroboam build a calf and put a calf in in dan and i believe the other one was in yeah manasseh if you're not mistaken right and then of course later in hosea that's where uh ephraim got got their idols and that's where uh uh dan and eve remove from the tribes of israel okay so we've been through those one two three four we've been through five now right so tonight we'll look at uh naftali by the grace of god and this i just studied this this morning and this afternoon and i i just found some wonderful things i hope it'll be a blessing to you okay so here's a little a map now i'm gonna zoom in but naphtali's here okay so it's right by the sea of galilee uh now here's the jordan jordan runs down here jericho's way down here so look at all the miles naphtali is north kind of heading up into uh asia and europe over here so it's quite a far ways north than when you know when joshua possessed the land here and uh you came in and got the victory there's gilgal jericho jerusalem's all the way down here bethel it's quite a ways up there to naftali it's a nice chunk of lamb but of course not the biggest or anything we'd say like that uh but it's a nice portion so here it is zoomed in a little bit you know you might be you're probably only familiar like me i was only familiar with capernaum i wasn't really familiar with any of these other ones key dish is not kadesh that's a different one all these other ones i wasn't really familiar with but i was familiar with capernaum how many familiar with that we'll end the service with capernaum we'll get there by the end by the grace of god but this is the the land given to and i look at his portions bigger than zebulun bigger than issachar about the same as asher uh you know but not as big as some of these other ones on the other side so that kind of gives you just a picture of his his size of his land for the tribe so if you let's read these because we have time here tonight let's read these uh maybe we'll get our bibles here genesis 29 7-8 and then i'll get to deuteronomy 33 as well yeah genesis 29 7-8 here's the birth scripture so you can see what is his name right because remember we were just we're trying to balance out the quotes where brother brown said each of the mothers prophesied about where they would be in the land we can't find that in the scripture that's okay we take everything back to the word it wasn't spoken with us saith the lord uh but it was brother and he said let's say that's what it means so he was just doing his best as he uh would preach the word of god and in the time that he had to study when he wasn't praying for the sick right making sick calls and and envisions and interviews and all the ministries that he had so genesis 29 7-8 and he said lo it is yet high day neither it is time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them verse eight and they say we cannot until all the flocks be gathered till they roll the stone from the well's mouth then we water the sheep okay that's not the scripture i must have wrote down the wrong one here forgive me let me tap it in there real quick okay yeah it's chapter 30 sorry not 28 i wrote the wrong one chapter 37 8 sorry genesis 37-8 but i'm just glad i can find it praise god thank god for the phone now 7-8 and bilhah rachel's maid conceived again and bear jacob a second son and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naftali okay so this didn't this didn't even come by rachel it came by rachel's maid this is the one that reuben slept with right right so remember uh so we have to balance out the quotes right so we see here we see nothing talked about land naphtali is named after what bill or what rachel was going through as she gave jacob her handmaid she was i'm wrestling with my sister leah it's a that's what that's what naphtali is named after the wrestling that she had with her sister how would you like to be named after a family struggle right a sibling rivalry how would you like to be named after a sibling rivalry that's a naphtali he's wrestle right she wrestled but i like it she prevailed amen i've wrestled but i prevailed because god gave me another son now it wasn't through her it was through her sir or her maidservant bilhah okay so i can't find brother and giving this uh giving any name to naftali there's only three quotes in the whole message about naftali and it all deals with the tribes of israel being placed in their different places okay now let's go to jacob's prophecy i'm sorry yeah we read this one but i'll read again genesis 49 21 we'll try to keep you moving here in the word of god one scripture naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words so this is quite strange he's compared to a deer right or a stag and he says he has goodly words have you ever heard a deer talk to you no but somehow somehow the holy spirit sees in naphtali a deer and then he sees goodly words through naphtali's life seems like a very strange connection right how are these connected i think we'll see by the end now go to deuteronomy 33 verse 23 and hope we're getting real deep and rich in the scriptures here now praise god hallelujah 20 33 23 and of naphtali he said oh natalie satisfied with favor and look at that god gave him favor and full with the blessing of the lord possess thou the west and the south possess now the west and the south now i i do uh the word west here means west of the sea of galilee so if you go back to west and then it's south of syria area because so he said be thou the west south okay or perhaps it means the southern part of naphtali i'm not quite sure what the south part means but i know west means west here uh of of the the river here the lake hula here or so this is west and then south so i'm not quite sure what the south means but here you can see west of the sea of galilee all right so that's that's quite a scripture now i'm doing a little bit of reading here to kind of build up some background to give you some idea yeah brother did i say 23. deuteronomy 33 23. did i get that right yeah that's right okay sorry about that brother while i'm here though i'm gonna fix that because that was chapter yeah that was 30. right and then deuteronomy 33 let me check that 23. yeah yeah that should be right by god's grace yeah thank you all right so this is one of the the few brothers that had a prophecy about their land okay now let's read a little bit here now the easton's bible dictionary just this is general information about the tribe of naftali okay he says jacob says you're a hind let loose you give goodly words it's intended us to set forth under poetic imagery the future character and history of the tribe at the time of the exodus this tribe numbered 53 000 but the close they were only 45 thousand along with dan and asher they formed the camp of dan under a common standard so they were by the eagle standard which is interesting as we'll look to later occupying a place during the march on the north side of the tabernacle which is interesting there on the north part of the land as well so just that's just interesting i don't really have any revelation on that but their possession assigned to set forth in joshua 19 it's in the north eastern corner of the land bounded on the east by the jordan and the lakes of mariam and galilee on the on the north extended to the far into cole syria the valley between the two lebanon ranges now look at this it's comprehended a greater variety of rich and beautiful scenery and of soil and climate than fell to the lot of any other tribe so the scenery and soil was more beautiful than any other tribe so when you want to see a beautiful place in israel that's where you'd go naftali they're the prettiest land and the most beautiful soil of all of them and isn't that what the bible said that he'd be full of blessings right moses said you're going to be full of blessings and so god gave them the most beautiful land to look at because have you i saw a video today of the sea of galilee it's just a beautiful calm most the time it's calm right sometimes sudden storms would come in that's when jesus would walk on the water or rebuke the storms but it's such a beautiful peaceful place people still love going there today and they just love sitting by the beautiful seaside of the sea of galilee it's such a such a very popular place for tourists to go because it's so beautiful it's the only fresh water in all of israel and so the holy spirit said uh you're going to get the blessing you're going to possess the west and the south and you're going to be satisfied with my favor amen and that's what they got it's about 800 square miles double that of issachar we'll get to that one later now here's where we're going to start getting in some the spiritual aspect of this a large number of the foreigners settled here among the mountains and hence it's called galilee of the gentiles so that's interesting now we start get the gentiles in here hallelujah right the southern portion of natalie has been called the garden of palestine because it's such a place of favor the bible said and full of the blessings of the lord amen it's like a garden place right it was un it was of unrivaled fertility it was the principal scene of our lord's public ministry here most of his parables were spoken and his miracles wrought did you catch that church the majority of jesus's preaching took place in naphtali the majority of jesus's miracles in the bible now because remember the whole world couldn't contain all that jesus did but as far as the the miracle bible the majority of them took place in naphtali there's something special about this land hallelujah now getting back to natural things the tribe though was the first to suffer the invasion of ben haydad in 1st kings 15. when they swept over the whole north of israel and carried the people into captivity so that was a very sad part but then the kingdom of israel came to an end and seven uh the northern part came in in 722 bc naphtali though now is almost holy like a desert now this was written uh i don't know how long this might maybe a hundred years ago it'd be interesting to see where it's at now okay uh so that's just interesting you know this is the natural turn or natural result of the tribe it was uh invaded and then uh uh you know it lost a lot of its fruitfulness over the years now if you got uh we don't have to turn there but uh the only really important historical event which is concerned is the defeat of javen's host which is celebrated in the song of deborah and barrack in this passage we may study the character of the tribe okay so in other words naphtali joined with their their soldiers and they brought him down to fight with deborah and barrack when they defeated their enemies remember they sang a beautiful song so that's the only thing we can see from their history that was really outstanding okay other than the natural blessings where the bible said they had full blessings okay now there's uh a few scriptures i'd like to get to here in a few moments here now we're gonna turn to matthew four so we're gonna turn to matthew four here this is quite a amazing text here so of course i've read this before but i've never been uh kind of struck by the the importance of this until today actually so four met let's go to matthew 4 verse 12. i know that says 13. let's go to matthew 4 verse 12. church did you know that scripture foretold that jesus christ would spend a lot of his time in naphtali and zebulun that was new to me i read it but i never got the understanding and scripture says this is a fulfillment of prophecy okay so if you look at verse 12. now verse 11 jesus was just tempted the devil right he was tempted that we overcome we know the three attacks from satan no man could be tempted like that but jesus overcame everyone not by a miracle but by obeying the word of god verse 12 now when jesus had heard that john was cast in the prison he departed into galilee now galilee contains vulneran and naphtali's land northern israel so jesus gets the holy ghost he goes out for 40 days he defeats satan once he gets strengthened by the angels he says i'm going up to naphtali i'm going up this villain praise god because there's something special about that place verse 13. and leaving nazareth he came and dwell in capernaum which is upon the seacoast in the borders of zabulon and naphthalim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah's the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of natalie by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles my hallelujah so right after gets the holy ghost he follows the holy ghost up north to a land that has both jew and gentiles amen hallelujah jesus wasn't just going anywhere he wanted he was going where the holy ghost was directing him to go can i say it like this brother william he went swiftly there praise god like a deer amen hallelujah praise god amen god knew there was a certain place he was supposed to go glory now what was the prophecy why was this so important verse 16 because it was fulfilling prophecy in verse 16. the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region in shadow of death light is sprung up so this was a place of death but god sent christ there quickly to be light to them it was this they were under the shadow of death amen there's a it's death it's dark and so god said i'm going to send my light there to give them a light and to brighten them up praise god this is a land that had fallen away right they were they were taken captive and then they'd come back right but it was still a place of darkness so god said i'm going to send my son jesus there and he's going to bring them my light amen praise god then what happens verse 17 church did you know this where did jesus preach first amen he preached first in zabulon and naphtali amen his first preaching glory his free his first goodly words amen came to naftali and zebulun by the plan of god amen that was an accident that was prophesied 1500 years earlier amen hallelujah praise god god has a provided place god knows if there's darkness god knows i know just where to send the light to amen church that's how our lives were our lives were buried in darkness but god gave us a great life hallelujah amen hallelujah thank god and it came swiftly and it came with goodly words amen hallelujah praise god thank you jesus verse 17 from that time jesus began to preach that's when he began preaching and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand hallelujah who did jesus preach you first naphtali and zebulun it was prophetic god wanted him there amen god wanted his deer to run there praise god hallelujah and he went in there you hear the gospel god always does that can you say like that god god's always sending light hallelujah oh thank god you know what history says did you know this church shocking this morning fella i really said most of jesus disciples were from these two tribes most of his disciples were from naphtali or zebulun hallelujah when nebuchadnezzar won over the land he replaced many people in the land the area became more gentile later from intermarriage of jews and gentiles the people were called samaritans but did you catch that most of jesus's disciples were from naphtali or zebulun that that land region now it's interesting uh jacob's prophecy says the other tribes would admire him so the meaning of this is unclear it may indicate this tribe would have an easier life than the other tribes because of their fertile land uh the sea of galilee the fresh water it was right there next to them they didn't have to do any work for the fresh water or i believe they would admire them because of the future ministry of christ the messiah see just like judah judah had prophecy about the messiah that wasn't uncommon when jacob you know jacob said that that's part of it right the scepter would come to judah and they'd reign until it came to shiloh there was already prophecy about the messiah so it appears here now naphtali is getting some prophecy or not really about the tribe themselves but later the messiah that would come to that portion of that land in the area of naphtali and zebulun amen in other words jacob was talking about christ amen and those disciples hallelujah oh my thank you jesus let's go there let's go to isaiah 9. i'll show you where this is talking this is speaking of isaiah 9 verses 1 and 2. and church you know what this really makes me want to preach brother i don't know if you've been here when i said this but one of my next uh sermon series i want to do is called the life of jesus of nazareth i just want to preach on his whole life i want to place these all together brother i think we're going to find some real deep rich things here that's going to be a that's going to be a long study i'm gonna preach his whole life from beginning to end if the lord would let me and you know why it's it's important because the bible says our ministry have to match christ's ministry as the headstone comes down it's gotta fit perfectly on laodicea right so our ministry has to exactly match jesus christ and it's very easy to do because jesus was led by the holy spirit and as long as we're led by the holy spirit then we match the ministry of christ no matter how humble because we don't have to do the whole thing brother william we just got to do our portion of jesus's ministry amen we have a portion of the fullness of god the bible says we have a portion of that right that's what the bible said the fullness of the portion given to us i just preached on that on sunday we don't have the fullness in us but we get a portion of his fullness in other words our ministry doesn't have to do everything but our ministry has to play the part that god has given to us and the church said amen and how do you do that you follow the leading of the holy spirit very simple jesus said i do nothing except the father showeth me first amen and everything we're doing tonight is because the father showed us it first right we're supposed to gather more we're supposed to feed on the preaching of the word right we're supposed to let the fivefold ministry uh help us to be edify us right strengthen us help us to grow up in the knowledge of god amen everything we're doing tonight is what the bible told us to do and we're doing what the scripture tells us amen isaiah 9 isaiah 9 1-2 nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the seed beyond jordan in galilee of the nations the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them half the light shined praise god this these were tribes that were backslidden right they were the first ones to be taken over right uh taken to assyria but yet god promises even in their dark state i'm going to eventually send them the light in other words i'm going to send them my son the only begotten son of the father the lord jesus christ and he is the light of the world amen this land especially this land was going to be visited with the messiah praise god now i'm going to read this here uh it's from john gill a preacher from the 1800s now he says naphtali is a hind let loose now one man says his lot fell in a good land and his inheritance a fruit-bearing one was was as the most fruitful country of geneserit which gave the name to a sea or lake by which abounded with gardens with palm trees fig trees olive trees which josephus says one might call the ambition of nature and strabo a heathen writer says of it it was a happy blessed country and bearing all sorts of good things and another historian said uh this is the veil of jenna jenna gasarit where it was which was as quick to bring forth through as a hind is swift to run okay so different riders will say well this this this phrase a hind let loose it means how quick the plants brought forth how quick the trees brought forth and that could be true but we know scripture has compound prophecy and the church said amen that's right now it says here let me go down here some will have this prophecy to be fulfilled in barrack which i believe too because that's multiple prophecies so barrick and deborah who was of this tribe so barrack was of the tribe of naphtali and who at first was fearful like the hind this is interesting right because remember he said i'm not going up there deborah unless you go with me remember a man now think of that a man in bible days a man saying i'm not going without the woman i mean that don't sound like an old testament saint he probably said like you stay here i'll go myself but it showed how he's fearful like the hind and backward to go out to war when called but afterwards readily went out with deborah who at last gave goodly words in the song they both sang so that's a beautiful thought right so we can see compound prophecy but it better describes the genius disposition and manners of the tribe who are kind and loving swift and expedient in their affairs lovers of liberty well-spoken persons humane affable courteous and pleasing languages follows okay so to me i can see the hind in barrack and deborah and the good words because he was fearful but yet when he got the goodly words then he was that he could he was very graceful right they got the victory god gave them the victory so we can see at least the prophecy there fulfilled in deborah and barrack all right now here's here's the the christ this is what i want to get to and i've got about 10 minutes here if i keep my 45 minutes he giveth goodly word so natalie would give good words to those he converses with it may be applied particularly to christ and his disciples to the inhabitants of this tribe in his in his time among whom they were much uh he himself is compared to the hind of the morning in a title or a row or a heart uh song of solomon 2 9 and song of solomon 8 14. let's get your bibles let's go there did you catch that church jesus christ is compared to a deer in song of solomon praise god song of solomon 2 9. you got it let's all read that together you got it uh song of solomon 2 9. i'll give you a moment verse 8 says the voice of my beloved behold he he cometh leaping upon the mountain skipping upon the hills look at him so graceful i see him coming he's so graceful look at him oh my he comes swiftly brother yeah we how many seen deer i drive all the time i see deer all the time boy they're swift when they run rather their legs go like this it's like it only looks like normal it looks like it's a it just kind of flings out too far they're just so graceful i mean they're just they're so beautiful they're so swift and quick and the schulamite says oh the voice of my beloved he said he's like see skipping upon the hills just frolicking around now let's all read verse nine ready one two three my beloved is like a row or a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall he looking forth at the windows showing himself through my lattice right he's like a deer out there just looking at you he's like swiftly coming down he leaps upon the mountains the woman is saying this about the husband he's like a deer so swift and quiet and gentle looking at me through the lattice who did solomon represent he represented jesus christ amen looking through the lattice which means he's not fully revealed right we kind of see through a glass darkly amen praise god but we hear his voice and his voice skips down to us oh the words of christ come so pleasantly amen they can come so quickly in service amen we might not be expecting it but we can see it come down so gracefully oh the grace of god flows down to us amen like a deer praise god amen oh that's beautiful that's and that's the holy spirit church that ain't me that's the holy ghost saying solomon is typing christ like a deer he's so gentle he's so quiet he's so graceful and beautiful he swoops down from the mountains like he's just falling down just just gracefully coming down oh he's so beautiful how he comes hallelujah thank god amen uh chapter 8 verse 14. do you remember when i preached this not long ago how does the book of song of solomon end it ends the same way the bible ends hallelujah i'm just getting excited here so forgive me if i'm gonna this is beautiful how does it end in verse six he says set me as a seal upon thy soul so solomon's saying make me a seal i want to be the seal in your soul amen i want to be sealed into you praise god amen hallelujah and then look how he comes down we're going to verse 12. my vineyard which is mine is before me thou o solomon must have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred so he sees connecting solomon to this fruitfulness right that's what naphtali had very fruitful ground praise god verse 13 thou that dwelt in the gardens the companions hearken to thy voice there it is cause me to hear it praise god so god's voice is like this this deer verse 14 make haste my beloved and be thou like a robe or to a young heart upon the mountains of spices in other words jesus come quickly praise god come down and visit me come swiftly let your presence fall in the church amen let your presence fall in the car let your presence fall in my house let your presence just come quickly to me i need make haste come quickly i need you and come in your grace and your power amen so now we got the word of god now we have the scripture saying jesus christ is like a deer his voice is like a deer as it gracefully descends upon us amen why because he's amible that means lovely his loveliness in himself and for his lovingness to his people for his swiftness to do the will and work of his father being sent out as hear the word signifies by him into the world on the business of man's salvation amen hallelujah and so his disciples who were galileans were swift to obey his call and left all and followed him and were sent out by him to preach his gospel and both he and they may be said to give goodly words as the doctrines of the gospel are words of grace truth and life wholesome comfortable pleasant and delightful good tidings of good things of peace pardon righteousness salvation and eternal life by christ and the inhabitants of this country in christ's time we're swift to run after him that's true because the bible said multitudes follow jesus christ there amen multitudes they just swiftly followed after him because he was he was giving them the goodly words of eternal life amen it was darkness and it's as if somebody had turned on the light and mouthed highly praise god it was dark but christ brought light amen he brought the gospel he brought good news he brought salvation he brought forgiveness can i say it like this he brought the free gift amen praise god they panted after him as the deer pants for the water so my soul longs after thank god amen after the water brooks they both received and gave out the goodly words of the gospel and were made free thereby so i can hide let little say man i like a bird from prison bars has flown we're set free tonight amen hallelujah thank god just as a deer set free from his prison bars oh that's beautiful my goodness that's beautiful that's just history on the west and the south like i already shared with you i'm gonna for time say i'm gonna skip past it now look church one of these cities in naphtali was bethsaida because it was on the west side of the sea of galilee it was the home of peter andrew philip and frequently resorted by jesus this was the same city so this naphtali was the home of peter andrew philip and more right and this was where christ fed 5 000. this is where the blind man received his sight praise god i'm reading the rest of that there so this was a place of great manifestation this this is a place where things happen fast the the darkness it just instantly changed to light before it was spiritual death and now jesus there now there's light amen it happened quickly all this area of naphtali and zebulun now i don't have time to read all that that's a lot and i'm just going to skip that one too now let's look at the sea of galilee so now remember here let me zoom out here okay that's that's slide 28. but here let's look up here just briefly so now see here we have the sea of galilee right there's capernaum i think beth side is right in here also as well but this is where christ this was basically christ's home base or his headquarters right he spent as far as in scripture the majority of his time he spent here in capernaum and i've got numerous scriptures i could show you on that one where capernaum was like his home base he spent a lot of time there and that's where the disciples were from as well so i'm going to go back to that now what's so special about the sea of galilee this is where this is a freshwater lake and it was the main freshwater source for much of israel you can't drink salt water you got to get fresh water somewhere and what was jesus he was living water amen and this is where he lived most of the time he was here a lot of times fresh water and that's where christ was this is 70 miles 70 miles north of jerusalem and so jerusalem and the sea of galilee or land of naphtali that joins israel or jerusalem as the two main two main locations of jesus ministry now church i don't have the picture i really maybe i can look it up real quick yeah maybe i can look it up there is a there was a road called the via marius okay so in the times of jesus there was a road that went right by capernaum and the sea of galilee and it was the only road that connected you to africa europe and asia praise god and god placed jesus christ not by jerusalem most of his ministry place him in capernaum because capernaum is right by this can i say like it's like a highway it was like a highway in those days it was like an international highway brother william and so god did all these miracles and all these great works of jesus near capernaum and it's right where all the travel lines were for the whole world that way the word of god could be taken to all the generations and all the continents and all the peoples very quickly amen glory swiftly amen so the gospel even though he had only a three and a half year ministry his the news and the fame the bible said the fame of jesus spread through the whole region amen because god had to place him in a spot where his works would be so great it'd be right along the highway where everybody would talk and all the travelers would hear about it and so the name of jesus and the ministry of jesus would be much talked about he was placed positionally there in naphtali amen oh so he was placed right on the road to europe right on the road to asia right on the road to africa church look at this scholars say jesus spent 70 of his ministry on the northern shore of the sea of galilee 70 percent almost two-third i'm sorry almost three-fourths of his ministry he spat near the shores of the sea of galilee and all the world travelers had to pass through the via maras the roman road and they would have heard about jesus's mighty miracles so remember matthew 4 13 said jesus's ministry moved to capernaum after he got the holy ghost he went from nazareth to capernaum right six of his disciples were from the northern shore area peter andrew james john matthew and philip so his his apostles were waiting there naphtali waiting for the great deer to come praise god and bring the goodly words amen and then they would instantly forsake their nets they'd forsake their tax collecting and they'd follow christ the lamb amen or christ the deer i'll say it like that they'd follow them quickly now look at acts 1 11. i'm going to read that acts 111 just so you got it the bible says most of his apostles were from the galilee region so zebulun and naphtali acts 1 11 which also said ye men of galilee why send you gazing up into heaven the same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven so shalt so come in like manner as you have seen him going to heaven if you know the story jesus just left for heaven and all that's left are his followers and so the angel says ye men of galilee you men of naphtali you men of zebulun why wait here go down to jerusalem travel 70 miles south and get the holy ghost amen oh my but church look at this up by the up by the sea of galilee jesus calmed this sea on multiple occasions he fed the four thousand he preached the sermon of the mount right next to the sea his most beautiful sermon people say which is i mean that's arguable they're all beautiful man the most beautiful one they say came right there on the sermon amount right near the sea of galilee jesus cast out devils in their synagogues he had the miraculous catch of fish there with peter he calmed the sea he forgave sins of the man with the withered hand that was in capernaum he preached the seven parables in matthew 13 in capernaum he preached the mysteries of god oh can i say it like this those goodly words amen those seven parables in matthew 13. those were preached in capernaum in naphtali oh my hallelujah so there it is again so you can see it church all these sermons were preached right around in here these sermons these uh the the parables of sermon on the mount all preach in this area of naphtali now i'm going to zoom in here can you guys see this look at here now this is a lot of information so i'm sorry but look at number one in this area jesus transfiguration took place and he healed an epileptic boy in naphtali number five where's five jesus calms the storm and see that was right near naphtali right here's naphtali this is all that number six jesus fed five thousand and he healed the sick right here uh in naphtali number seven jesus pronounced judgment upon torizon messaida capernaum and then he preached a sermon on the mount right here right naphtali number eight look at all this look at all jesus did in capernaum he had a large catch of fish he healed the demon-possessed man sermon on the mount he healed simon's mother-in-law amen they healed the centurion servant you just speak the word amen and it'll be done and it was healed that same hour that was in naphtali praise god he healed the paralytic remember when they let that paralytic down into peter's house that was in capernaum naphtali we're goodly words we're preached amen rise up take up your bed and walk amen goodly worse how many believe that's goodly words the woman touched his garment in capernaum amen hallelujah jairus's daughter was healed in capernaum raised from the dead two blind men received their sight right after they left capernaum they were following saying son of man son of man and he said receive your sight a mute person who couldn't hear or couldn't speak was given his ability to speak and hear the withered hand man he said he said what's easier to say heal your hand right we heard that on sunday or your sins are forgiven and he says he said i forgive your sins go and sin no more and he said take out your hand and god jesus healed his hand right there right there in capernaum he was also accused of being healed by or using bielsa bub's power also there so what do we see we see amazing miracles a huge portion of his ministry done in naphtali hallelujah so this is a ma this was in the days of jesus you had charizard capernaum genocide magdala mary magdalene her hometown was in naphtali praise god and she's the one that jesus spoke goodly words and seven devils left her praise god in that family praise god goodly words oh they were flowing down like a they were coming down so gracefully weren't they one after another this one healed that one healed the grace of god they'd seen the light shine where there was once darkness praise god but then god's grace came simply to them and they received a great light amen they received goodly words through god's deer god's hind hallelujah jesus christ amen cana of galilee naphtali his first miracle praise god his first sermon was in gubernium god sent a great light to bring these out of darkness because of his grace now church we don't have time but here's all the scriptures of all healings and in the bible in matthew and all these have taken place in galilee in capernaum many of them i just read them to you all just they were chosen his 12 disciples were chosen there he called it and those are the ones that are going to sit on 12 thrones praise god all of these goodly words come and follow me praise god all these words were spoken there it was a special place it was a place of grace it's a place of goodly words it's the place of messiah it was a place where darkness had to flee because light had come amen oh my god and let's stand because jesus did this because god sent it look greater responsibility was on naphtali than all the other places now he put a great one on jerusalem too he said whoa whoa whoa into jerusalem right how long i'd like to hover over you but you would not he said very similar things to bethsaida charizard and capernaum he said woe unto you because you've seen such great miracles right but he said you'll be brought down to hell because you didn't repent adam think about that the dead rays the blind sauce all these miracles and the most people refused to receive the goodly words but thank god there was some elect that received it amen that's you and i praise god now look at this now look church jesus said blessed are those who believe yet haven't seen maybe like in my life i haven't seen the blind eyes open the natural blind eyes i haven't seen the dead raised but maybe that's not god that's obviously not god's portion for my life at least not yet but this group had it the naphtali cities there they had all this chance to receive it but most of them would turn it down but jesus says don't worry about what you see he said worry about what you hear be concerned about what you hear live the gospel praise god not everybody gets to see the same miracles but the more miracles you see the more responsibility you have his remember he said to be more tolerable for you on the day on sodom and gomorrah than for you on the day of judgment that's what he told torizon messiah all these naftali cities the more you see supernaturally the more you're responsible for so my desire is lord let me see what you want me to see that's fine but let me believe and live the gospel of jesus christ even if i don't see it i still believe it praise god amen he said blessed are those who have not seen yet have believed and so what do we see we see our beloved gazelle our heart our stag our deer returning for his mate hallelujah let's thank the lord can we thank the lord for that praise god now god can come this is what we see in naphtali's life we see a promise of natural blessing we see how they helped out deborah and barrack but we see the prophetic aspect to the messiah the messiah comes swiftly he speaks goodly things he's graceful he's beautiful he's humble i said like he's humble like a deer praise god he looks at you through the lattice he's real humble his voice is so sweet and calm his power is evident but we have a responsibility to receive those goodly words and we must not forsake that opportunity that we have aren't you glad you had a chance to receive god's dear praise god it's prophesied but it was given to us praise god church we were in darkness how many were in darkness but god sent you a great light amen just like naphtali let's bow our heads here you can stop the livestream god bless our live streamers there see i thought i could take one whole service on naphtali there
