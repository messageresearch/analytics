[44:21] we can switch over if you like to switch
[44:26] over here by God's grace I like to look
[44:28] at part eight tonight
[44:32] it's a Philadelphia Church age tonight
[44:34] we get him permanent pretty familiar
[44:36] with this by the grace of the Lord but
[44:39] the messenger of John Wesley and they
[44:41] had more light than the Sardis age but
[44:43] of course we know the latest seein has
[44:44] less light than this age 1750 to 1906 as
[44:49] I said part 8 of the series part 48 of
[44:52] the overall series we read our text I
[44:56] did just want to give a just a few
[44:59] reminders about the voting ballots are
[45:04] due by Sunday you can give those to
[45:06] brother vain there's either three four
[45:08] or five out depending you know some
[45:10] couples only one they only do one ballot
[45:12] so I'm not quite sure but three or four
[45:15] or five ballots have not been filled out
[45:17] give those to vain and as I said next
[45:19] Wednesday and the following Sunday Lord
[45:21] willing we'll announce the results by
[45:24] God's grace I just want to give a
[45:26] personal note you know thank you for all
[45:27] the support
[45:28] I'll no doubt be voted in as pastor
[45:30] again so I'm thankful for that but you
[45:34] know in the 12 years I've been voted on
[45:36] this is the first time I can remember I
[45:38] haven't got all 100% support so I just
[45:42] want to tell those live-streaming and
[45:44] who may listen this later on an archive
[45:47] I'm welcome I welcome any and all
[45:50] concerns in a private meeting at any
[45:53] available time you happy to get anyone's
[45:57] concerns and so I've been listening to
[45:59] you know church order from 1963 and and
[46:01] some of the quotes came up I would just
[46:03] want to share that might be a help for
[46:07] those votes I didn't get I always want
[46:08] to be open to correction if I'm wrong
[46:10] the scriptural way to correct a pastor
[46:13] is first Timothy 5:19 against an elder
[46:17] received not an accusation but before
[46:19] two or three witnesses so if one of the
[46:22] I don't know the reason I didn't get
[46:23] some of the votes but if I have done
[46:27] anything wrong and there's accusations
[46:30] against me which I don't know if there
[46:31] is right now please bring the
[46:35] was before me with two or three
[46:36] witnesses I'll happy to talk about
[46:37] anything I've tried to live pure before
[46:39] God these this is my 12th year of
[46:42] pastoring what will finish the 12th year
[46:43] you know in June so we're into the 12th
[46:47] year but if there's anything I've done
[46:49] wrong please let me know I've tried to
[46:50] live right before God brother Branham
[46:54] says this you know he at the being of
[46:56] Church order 63 says I'd expect you
[46:58] brethren now and that's what I say too I
[46:59] expect everybody here at the church and
[47:01] anytime that you see me get away from
[47:03] the scripture to come to me privately
[47:05] and tell me where I'm wrong I don't care
[47:09] if you're one of the trustees or or if
[47:10] you're the janitor whoever you are
[47:12] you're duty-bound to me as a brother in
[47:14] Christ to tell me where I'm wrong
[47:17] scripturally if there's a question let's
[47:19] sit down and solve it out together so I
[47:22] just want to repeat this you know if
[47:24] anything if I've done anything wrong or
[47:25] preached anything wrong I don't know
[47:27] about it and this last year I've had a
[47:29] maybe one email about something that
[47:34] maybe I'd done wrong but something very
[47:36] very small I talked to that person
[47:39] apologized something very small it
[47:41] didn't need to be repeat up here because
[47:42] it it wasn't a big issue and then I've
[47:47] had a couple meetings where people
[47:49] didn't understand what I said or either
[47:52] I said it wrong or they misunderstand me
[47:53] I never went back and listened to it but
[47:57] when we were talking we both agreed on
[48:00] what was true so we don't know we don't
[48:02] know if is that misunderstanding on
[48:03] their part or if I said something wrong
[48:05] but everything that's been brought to me
[48:07] this year I've addressed it by God's
[48:09] grace so for the votes I didn't get you
[48:12] know you're welcome to come talk to me
[48:14] about it happy to talk about and it may
[48:16] just be you know and it may be this next
[48:18] quote brother branham you know says he
[48:21] said there's just got to be one head
[48:22] around here you know and he says you may
[48:24] disagree with with my brother Rams
[48:27] decisions and principles that he holds
[48:28] but brother Branham said but if I let
[48:30] you run it I'll disagree with you so
[48:33] he's saying that you know as humans we
[48:35] disagree with Pete which with each other
[48:37] you know so if I can get the votes
[48:40] because they just disagree with me you
[48:41] know that's that's fine I probably
[48:43] disagree with them on certain things but
[48:45] we got to have one one leader that's
[48:48] God's
[48:48] God's body always has one head and
[48:50] that's how God does it in the local
[48:52] church as a type of his body his
[48:55] spiritual body one head man said we got
[48:59] to have some source somewhere where
[49:01] there's got to be an ultimate and that's
[49:02] the best I know I'm giving it under the
[49:04] Holy Spirit letting him be my ultimate
[49:06] and let this take me your ultimate on
[49:08] these questions so it may be these
[49:10] people just disagree with me and they
[49:13] don't want to talk about I don't know
[49:14] why but I'd be happy to talk about it if
[49:16] they do want to talk about it and here's
[49:18] something else I want to encourage I
[49:20] want to encourage the ones I didn't get
[49:21] votes from to please come talk to me
[49:23] because if they feel like I'm not
[49:26] qualified that's if they feel I'm not
[49:28] qualified because brother Branham says
[49:29] this when the time comes as under God if
[49:32] I feel like that I'm that Orman devil
[49:34] can't no more qualified to be pastor
[49:37] here I'm going to mention it to the
[49:39] church now if someone feels I don't
[49:42] qualify they don't mention it to the
[49:44] church they come to me privately like
[49:46] brother Branham said but brother Branham
[49:48] says in this quote that he's like the
[49:49] bishopric
[49:50] of the tabernacle which means he started
[49:52] the church and then they still
[49:54] recognized him as the leader he just
[49:56] would go out on missionary evangelistic
[49:58] trips and come back so he says he would
[50:01] let the church know he said when I'd see
[50:04] one thing here that you deacons couldn't
[50:06] qualify to be deacons I'm gonna mention
[50:08] it to the church then I find out there's
[50:10] a certain Deacon out here doing
[50:11] something he shouldn't do or he doesn't
[50:13] keep his post of duty and so forth like
[50:16] that or trustee or whatever it is I
[50:17] can't vote in I'm sorry I can't vote it
[50:20] in or out the church has to do that but
[50:22] I'm certainly going to present it before
[50:24] the church see because that's what it
[50:26] should do that's what I'm supposed to be
[50:28] as an overseer so the overseer makes it
[50:31] known to the board or the overseer makes
[50:33] it known to the trustees if someone in
[50:37] an office isn't qualified anymore now if
[50:39] somebody just in the laity thinks the
[50:42] pastor is not qualified they don't
[50:43] spread that idea around the church they
[50:46] come before the the pastor the elder
[50:48] with two or three witnesses in a private
[50:50] meeting that's how they address that so
[50:52] I just wanted you to see this that if
[50:55] we're Christians and we see someone's
[50:56] not qualified we need to come to that
[50:57] person and talk to them about it and I
[51:00] even at the bottom of the the ballot I
[51:02] did put
[51:02] check their you know I pastor I want to
[51:04] talk to you I feel someone's not
[51:05] qualified but nobody checked that so I
[51:09] don't understand but that's okay if I
[51:11] don't understand that's okay I just know
[51:13] I love everybody here I've tried to keep
[51:14] my post of duty as faithful as I
[51:16] possibly can I put this church above
[51:19] everything I put above my natural family
[51:20] I put it above everything I put this is
[51:24] my calling in life so anyways I just
[51:26] want to follow up on that and make just
[51:28] make sure you know any ballots are
[51:29] turning my Sunday so and we'll announce
[51:32] the results next Wednesday by God's
[51:34] grace and the following Sunday now I
[51:37] took a few minutes on that I want to
[51:39] move on here and look at the church age
[51:42] by the grace of Lord let me set a little
[51:44] timer here by God's grace now let's I
[51:48] want to look at this thought now as I
[51:49] was studying this morning I just these
[51:51] words kind of jumped off the the page is
[51:53] there in the church age book the
[51:56] province speaks of the carrying on of
[51:58] the sixth age into our seventh age and I
[52:01] just want to look at this now a few
[52:03] weeks ago when I preached on this I
[52:05] showed how brother Branham said there
[52:09] was an open door after the Xu's and
[52:11] Street revival denominated so I brought
[52:13] that farm that was a new thought I never
[52:15] seen that thought before no one that I
[52:18] had talked to it ever knew that thought
[52:19] so that was a great thought to see that
[52:22] 1906 there was a revival on Azusa Street
[52:25] in California but a few years after that
[52:27] they denominated I think I looked it up
[52:30] and I forget what it was I think it was
[52:31] 1914 or 1916 they group started
[52:35] denominating well brother branham said
[52:37] shortly after that that Jesus opened
[52:41] another door which was the door for his
[52:42] ministry the door for the bride so those
[52:45] that were really bride members out of
[52:47] that revival kept going on and
[52:48] eventually would receive the profit of
[52:51] the hour the message of the hour and so
[52:53] brother Ram was making a great
[52:55] observation that God made another open
[52:57] door even when the revival denominated
[53:00] God kept it going gave us another open
[53:02] door when we think for that we're living
[53:05] in an open door right now amen I'm
[53:07] living in that open door right now by
[53:09] God's grace the door but in this
[53:13] particular portion of the church age
[53:14] book the Prophet talked
[53:16] about how the sixth age melts or blends
[53:19] into the seven so let's look at this
[53:22] here's our text for tonight we read that
[53:24] for tonight I know thy works behold I've
[53:25] set before thee an open door which I'm
[53:27] sorry no man can shut it now in order to
[53:31] understand the wealth of meaning
[53:33] involved in behold I set before you an
[53:36] open door no man can shut it we must now
[53:38] recall what has been said about each age
[53:41] running over into another age there is
[53:47] overlapping a melting or fading into
[53:51] rather than abrupt end and a clear-cut
[53:54] start so the profit gives us years that
[53:57] are clear-cut stops but he's saying
[53:59] spiritually they overlap so the effects
[54:02] of each age overlap into other ages and
[54:07] the Prophet says and this age of
[54:09] Philadelphia particularly flows into the
[54:12] next age and not only does this age
[54:16] overflow into the last stage but the
[54:18] last age is in many respects simply a
[54:21] carrying on of the six age so that was
[54:24] striking to me the seventh age a very
[54:27] short age gathers up into itself for one
[54:30] quick work all the eve of every age and
[54:34] like this all the reality of Pentecost
[54:37] amen
[54:37] I like that now I got a visual here so
[54:41] is the live stream on the visual okay so
[54:43] I just did a visual there this morning I
[54:45] hope you open that this is what the
[54:47] prophets saying here that the six age
[54:50] blends into the seven so it's almost as
[54:53] if this open door started during the
[54:56] time of the Philadelphia Church age but
[54:58] it's been open now and it kind of blends
[55:00] right into the Laodicean because it's an
[55:04] open door for the rapture it's an open
[55:06] door for the marriage supper of the Lamb
[55:08] amen and so I hope that does that help I
[55:11] hope that helps as a visual the Prophet
[55:13] says this age melts and blends
[55:15] particularly this age is so connected to
[55:17] the previous age of Philadelphia church
[55:19] age
[55:20] now the next visual I just want to show
[55:23] this again I didn't really mean to put
[55:25] the lives of the the messengers on there
[55:28] but anyway
[55:29] those are the messengers this is what I
[55:31] wanted to say the open door age then
[55:33] continues to the rapture so this open
[55:36] door it carries over just like we'll see
[55:39] later when we in this series how Jesus
[55:41] said I'll keep you from the hour of
[55:43] temptation that will come upon the whole
[55:45] world that's speaking of the time right
[55:47] before the tribulation so speaking of
[55:50] the squeeze time so we have scriptures
[55:53] about or scriptures in the Philadelphia
[55:55] Church H that actually talk about the
[55:57] Laodicean Church age aren't you glad God
[56:00] gives us to all ages to catch the
[56:03] revelation of the hour God gave it to
[56:05] them in Philadelphia but that revelation
[56:07] carries over in the lair Asiya he gives
[56:09] us two ages to catch the revelation I
[56:12] like that amen now once the Philadelphia
[56:16] age has about run its course the layer C
[56:18] age quickly comes in bringing both the
[56:21] tares and the wheat to harvest
[56:24] remember the tares get bound first first
[56:28] bind the tares to burn them but gather
[56:31] the wheat into my barn
[56:33] now remember please that the sardian age
[56:35] started the Reformation that must still
[56:38] go on into the grain that was planted at
[56:40] Pentecost goes through the full cycle of
[56:42] planting watering nourishing etc until
[56:45] it comes right back to the original seat
[56:48] aren't you glad God's watering you
[56:50] aren't you glad God is nourishing the
[56:52] seed life inside of the event so
[56:54] thankful for that amen until it comes
[56:57] back to original seed so see we're going
[56:59] to come back to the original conditions
[57:01] of the book of Acts if I don't see it in
[57:03] my generation I trust the next
[57:05] generation will see it where the body of
[57:07] Christ as a whole comes back to that
[57:09] original Church where they have all the
[57:12] gifts of the Spirit where they're
[57:14] walking in the power of God and they're
[57:17] hearing their supernatural gifts and and
[57:20] they're so senses are so dedicated
[57:22] remember they were they were meeting
[57:24] from house to house
[57:25] God was adding daily to the church now
[57:27] we don't know if God will keep adding
[57:29] every day to the church and of course he
[57:30] will around the world but on a local
[57:32] level we're not sure because we know we
[57:34] know the number of souls is going to
[57:36] decrease we went over that last
[57:37] Wednesday but all the at spiritual
[57:40] attributes all the depth of love that
[57:42] they had at Pentecost
[57:43] we'll be in the bride of Jesus Christ
[57:45] the depth of love amen
[57:48] now while this is going on the tears
[57:50] that were sown will have to go through
[57:52] their cycle and be harvested also that
[57:58] is exactly what we are seeing if you can
[58:00] just think of the seasons you can get a
[58:02] very good picture of this the plant that
[58:04] you see growing in full strength and
[58:06] summer suddenly appears to be going to
[58:08] see you can't tell exactly when summer
[58:10] became autumn it just faded into it that
[58:13] is how the ages are and especially these
[58:15] last two all right so that's been why
[58:18] there's that's been why there's a great
[58:19] even missionary work right now with and
[58:22] that's why the the countries are opening
[58:26] now where where people are still getting
[58:27] missionaries are still getting into
[58:29] countries that age of the open door
[58:31] Internet is helping people hear the
[58:33] gospel the passing out of literature the
[58:36] sending of books and Bibles and the
[58:37] tapes the books of brother Branham
[58:39] that's why it's still happening because
[58:41] we're still in that carryover that still
[58:43] carries over into this age now next he
[58:48] says it is to this age that Jesus says I
[58:52] come quickly in verse 11 so see that's
[58:57] that's real striking there as well
[58:59] revelation 3:11 behold I come quickly
[59:02] why would Jesus say behold I come
[59:04] quickly to the second and last church
[59:07] age because it's going to be short and
[59:09] that's those same characteristics many
[59:11] of them are going to carry over into the
[59:13] Laodicean Church age that's why Jesus
[59:16] said I come quickly he said that makes
[59:19] the last age a very short one Laodicea
[59:23] is the age of the quick work it is cut
[59:25] short now I put up here so it's very
[59:28] clear I've never heard a preach but I've
[59:31] heard people say in passing oh Laodicea
[59:34] has to be the shortest age and that
[59:36] that's a misunderstanding so I want to
[59:39] just stop here and say it's a
[59:41] misunderstanding that Laodicea has to be
[59:44] shorter than Ephesus now look
[59:46] ladis he has already going 111 years
[59:49] next year 2018 will be 112 years now
[59:53] this is why it's dangerous for people to
[59:56] his
[59:56] assume that that the rapture is gonna
[1:00:00] take place you know by 2020 23c some
[1:00:04] people have said in passing in
[1:00:05] conversations and maybe you've heard in
[1:00:07] preaching I never have but they've said
[1:00:09] Oh latest see it has to be the shortest
[1:00:10] age because it's a very short one and
[1:00:13] it's a age of a quick work but it
[1:00:15] doesn't have to be later to see how it
[1:00:17] can be longer than Ephesus I just want
[1:00:19] to make sure I say that that the the
[1:00:21] quotes of brother Branham do not say
[1:00:23] that maybe preachers have said that or
[1:00:25] maybe people in conversations have said
[1:00:27] that but brother Branham never taught
[1:00:29] that Laodicea was going to be shorter
[1:00:32] than Ephesus
[1:00:35] so 2023 will make Laodicea equal to
[1:00:40] Ephesus but see we're not setting dates
[1:00:42] we're not setting times and and years
[1:00:45] we're not doing that so these are that
[1:00:47] this is the order of the shortest ages
[1:00:49] Laodicea so far has been the shortest
[1:00:52] Ephesus 117 some myrna 140 to
[1:00:55] Philadelphia 156 okay then the next
[1:00:59] shortest would be Sardis and then
[1:01:02] Pergamos and batter tier is the longest
[1:01:04] is 896 years so so there we have that we
[1:01:08] have there you can see again the length
[1:01:10] of the years there 117 142 249 Pergamos
[1:01:15] 896 thyatira sardis 248 and Philadelphia
[1:01:19] 156 and there we are 111 years for this
[1:01:23] church age so hope that's clearly
[1:01:26] understood brother Branham never said
[1:01:28] labor to see would be the shortest age
[1:01:30] nor have I nor have anyone I know that
[1:01:34] that preaches the gospel I think I just
[1:01:36] heard people say it they've just
[1:01:37] misunderstood that quote where the
[1:01:40] Prophet said it's a short work and it's
[1:01:41] a very short age it's a very short age
[1:01:44] now more on the open door let's keep
[1:01:47] going on the open door now we will
[1:01:50] specifically dwell on the open door that
[1:01:52] no man can shut first of all I wanted
[1:01:54] well on the open door as signifying the
[1:01:56] tremendous missionary effort of that age
[1:01:59] Paul called a new missionary never for
[1:02:01] the Lord an open door that's in Sai
[1:02:04] Corinthians 2:12 and I preached us a few
[1:02:07] Sunday nights ago furthermore when I
[1:02:09] came to TRO has to preach
[1:02:10] gospel and the door was open unto me of
[1:02:13] the Lord so we can see by the comparison
[1:02:15] of scriptures that this open door
[1:02:17] signified the greatest spreading of the
[1:02:19] gospel that the world has ever seen like
[1:02:22] I said that continues in this age now we
[1:02:27] will specifically dwell I'm sorry wrong
[1:02:31] one now recall I use this slide a few
[1:02:36] Sundays ago when I preached on the open
[1:02:37] door in the evening service so right now
[1:02:40] the Prophet is speaking of the open door
[1:02:42] during the Philadelphia Church age
[1:02:44] remember there's numerous open doors in
[1:02:46] the scripture there's many ways to apply
[1:02:48] it there's the open door for the Gentile
[1:02:50] dispensation and the Pentecostal baptism
[1:02:53] of the Holy Ghost experience there's an
[1:02:55] open door to local ministry like choez
[1:02:57] as we just read there's an open door to
[1:02:59] heaven by vision that st. John
[1:03:01] experience there's an open door heart
[1:03:03] response requested by Christ to the
[1:03:05] latest in churches and then there's open
[1:03:09] door requested by the work of his
[1:03:10] iniquity but they will not get the open
[1:03:12] door that's a request that will not be
[1:03:14] granted by the Lord Jesus now I want you
[1:03:17] to see something here god works in
[1:03:19] threes now here's a thought you've
[1:03:20] probably haven't seen before I didn't
[1:03:22] see it either god works in threes
[1:03:27] doesn't he it was in the third or
[1:03:28] Pergamon me an age that the church was
[1:03:31] married to the state the deeds of the
[1:03:34] Nicolaitans had become the doctrine of
[1:03:35] Nicolaitans that age was the open door
[1:03:38] for the false vine once it was backed up
[1:03:40] by the power of the state it became an
[1:03:42] actual I'm sorry became actually a world
[1:03:44] system even though it bore the name
[1:03:47] Christian thus it spread like wildfire
[1:03:50] but now three ages later after a long
[1:03:55] and hard struggle of faith here comes
[1:03:57] the open door to the truth the door of
[1:04:01] the Lord now has its day of course the
[1:04:05] fifth age had set the stage for this
[1:04:06] mighty move as that age gave us
[1:04:09] exploration colonization the printing of
[1:04:11] books etc so this was interesting
[1:04:14] thought I'd never seen before I read it
[1:04:16] but I just never caught it Satan had an
[1:04:19] open door for three ages so let me just
[1:04:21] put I have a different picture very
[1:04:23] similar but I
[1:04:24] added some words here so Satan had to
[1:04:27] open door for the false vine at the
[1:04:30] pergamene church age and Jesus gave him
[1:04:33] three ages to have that open door but
[1:04:38] now he says three ages later one two
[1:04:40] three
[1:04:41] after that age now in the Philadelphia
[1:04:43] age Jesus opens a door to heaven right
[1:04:47] open door age continues unto the rapture
[1:04:50] the open door to heaven through the name
[1:04:52] of Jesus through the water baptism in
[1:04:54] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:04:56] understanding of the Godhead for the
[1:04:58] power of the Holy Spirit for missionary
[1:05:00] work in the name of Jesus and books to
[1:05:02] be printed the name of Jesus after three
[1:05:05] ages God said okay you had your three
[1:05:07] ages now it's my turn
[1:05:08] amen and then he opens the door and now
[1:05:11] the believers have the open door to the
[1:05:14] name of Jesus Christ the true
[1:05:16] understanding of the word of God I
[1:05:17] thought that was a nice thought that I
[1:05:19] should share with you we should rejoice
[1:05:21] that we have the open door cuz it hasn't
[1:05:23] been open now Jesus opened and later to
[1:05:25] see right now I'm sorry Philadelphia and
[1:05:27] now it's open for you and I as well now
[1:05:32] he now he starts talking again about the
[1:05:33] Philadelphia Church age it would have
[1:05:35] been wonderful if this open door had
[1:05:38] followed the divine pattern of Pentecost
[1:05:40] which was set forth in Hebrews 2 verses
[1:05:44] 1 to 4 I'm gonna read that just because
[1:05:46] it's good for us to hear these
[1:05:47] scriptures therefore we ought to give
[1:05:50] them more earnest heed to the things
[1:05:52] which we have heard less than any time
[1:05:54] we should let them slip for if the words
[1:05:56] spoken by Angels was steadfast and every
[1:05:59] transgression and disobedience received
[1:06:01] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[1:06:04] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[1:06:06] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:06:09] the Lord and was confirmed unto us by
[1:06:11] them that heard him God also bearing
[1:06:13] them witness both with signs and wonders
[1:06:14] and with divers miracles and gifts of
[1:06:17] the Holy Ghost according to his own will
[1:06:20] now you know that this is the pattern
[1:06:23] for Jesus himself said so this is the
[1:06:26] pattern for the open door mark 16:15 and
[1:06:29] he said unto them go into all the world
[1:06:31] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:06:34] he that believes in his baptized shall
[1:06:36] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:06:37] be damned
[1:06:38] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:06:40] believe in my name shall they cast out
[1:06:42] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:06:44] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:06:47] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:06:49] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:06:51] and they shall recover and then after
[1:06:53] the Lord has spoken unto them he was
[1:06:55] received up into heaven and sat on the
[1:06:57] right hand of God and they went forth
[1:06:59] and preached everywhere the Lord working
[1:07:01] with them and confirming the word with
[1:07:03] signs following amen
[1:07:06] now the preaching on the gifts of the
[1:07:08] Holy Spirit should it should stir our
[1:07:11] church up it should stir any real
[1:07:13] message Church up because that is the
[1:07:16] prophecy we're living under we should be
[1:07:18] excited we should be thrilled we should
[1:07:21] be spiritually motivated to the promises
[1:07:24] that God has for us in this hour we
[1:07:27] should be grateful that we know the
[1:07:29] prophecy for this hour that there's
[1:07:31] going to come a harvest reign that
[1:07:33] there's going to come latter rain
[1:07:34] there's going to come
[1:07:35] Rahab stirring faith there's going to
[1:07:37] come a restoration there's gonna come a
[1:07:39] restitution that should stir us up and
[1:07:42] that's why the church age book and the
[1:07:44] series preached from 1960 on the church
[1:07:47] ages are so full of supernatural
[1:07:50] promises they're so full of this the
[1:07:52] true church will have all the gifts in
[1:07:54] the book of Acts
[1:07:55] that's thus saith the Lord brother
[1:07:57] Branham tells us that he says the true
[1:08:00] church will have all the power of
[1:08:01] Pentecost anything that doesn't have any
[1:08:02] church that doesn't have the power of
[1:08:04] God is a false church we just read it
[1:08:07] tonight the Church of God has all the
[1:08:09] reality of Pentecost you cannot read the
[1:08:12] church age book or listen to the seven
[1:08:14] churches sermons without seeing the
[1:08:16] emphasis on these signs following
[1:08:19] believers I know some people might get
[1:08:21] discouraged if they don't see in their
[1:08:23] lives or they might get discouraged by
[1:08:24] me reading it but but that's because
[1:08:26] that's all brother Branham talked about
[1:08:28] that was his major focus in the church
[1:08:30] age book and also in the SIRT the series
[1:08:34] sermon on the church ages in 1960
[1:08:36] because that's the only true Church of
[1:08:39] God hey man that's the church that that
[1:08:41] has the revelation that Jesus is the
[1:08:44] Christ and then they can exercise that
[1:08:46] name they can exercise faith in that
[1:08:48] name and then faith in that name does
[1:08:50] mighty things they
[1:08:52] that's exactly right so see real
[1:08:54] believers don't get discouraged by that
[1:08:56] they don't get they don't get upset when
[1:08:59] that's preached this is what this is the
[1:09:01] example for the church this is what
[1:09:03] prophecy says and we've got to live this
[1:09:06] example amen now Jesus never told them
[1:09:11] to go to all of the world and pass out
[1:09:13] lid I'm sorry established Bible colleges
[1:09:15] normally tell them to pass out
[1:09:17] literature now those things are fine but
[1:09:19] what Jesus told them was to preach the
[1:09:20] gospel stick with the word and then the
[1:09:23] signs would follow the very first
[1:09:25] introduction we have in the way of the
[1:09:27] kingdom of God was to be preached was
[1:09:29] when Jesus sent out the twelve in
[1:09:33] Matthew 10 verse 1 to 8 he commissioned
[1:09:35] and instructed them on this wise and
[1:09:38] I'll read this cuz we haven't read it
[1:09:39] for a long time and when he had called
[1:09:41] unto him his 12 disciples he gave them
[1:09:44] power against unclean spirits to cast
[1:09:46] them out and to heal all manner of
[1:09:48] sickness and all manner of disease now
[1:09:50] the names of the Twelve Apostles are
[1:09:52] these the first Simon who is called
[1:09:54] Peter and Andrew his brother James the
[1:09:57] son of Zebedee and John his brother
[1:09:58] Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and
[1:10:02] Matthew the publican James the son of
[1:10:03] Alphaeus and lebbeus whose name surname
[1:10:06] was thaddaeus
[1:10:07] simon the canaanite and judas iscariot
[1:10:09] who also betrayed him these twelve Jesus
[1:10:12] sent forth and commanded them saying go
[1:10:15] into the way of the Gentiles and into
[1:10:17] any city of the Samaritans enter ye not
[1:10:19] but go rather to the lost sheep of the
[1:10:21] house of Israel and as you go preach
[1:10:24] saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[1:10:26] heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise
[1:10:29] the dead cast out devils freely you have
[1:10:32] received freely give amen
[1:10:34] so that was Jesus first Commission and
[1:10:36] we already read Matt mark 16 that was
[1:10:39] Jesus last Commission both Commission's
[1:10:41] are the same all believers should have
[1:10:43] supernatural signs following them this
[1:10:48] sharing that he gave them this ministry
[1:10:50] that he gave them was that actually the
[1:10:52] sharing of his own ministry with them
[1:10:55] for it says this in Matthew 9 35 to 38
[1:10:58] and Jesus went about all the cities and
[1:11:01] villages teaching in their synagogues
[1:11:02] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[1:11:04] and healing every sickness and
[1:11:05] disease among the people but when he saw
[1:11:08] the multitudes he was moved with
[1:11:09] compassion on them because they fainted
[1:11:11] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[1:11:13] having no Shepherd then saith he undoes
[1:11:15] disciples the harvest truly is plenteous
[1:11:17] but the laborers are few pray ye
[1:11:19] therefore the lord of the harvest that
[1:11:20] he was send forth laborers into the
[1:11:23] harvest now many people have the idea
[1:11:27] that just the Apostles had this ministry
[1:11:29] given them by our Lord Jesus and so when
[1:11:32] they died the ministry was over this is
[1:11:35] not so so brother Branham gives us one
[1:11:37] clear example of a deacon named Philip
[1:11:41] who was also an evangelist so this is
[1:11:43] Philip this Philip is actually different
[1:11:45] than the Philip that was one of the
[1:11:46] Twelve Apostles it's a different Philip
[1:11:49] now because the Prophet said how can the
[1:11:52] APUs - how could only the Apostles have
[1:11:54] these supernatural miracles when he says
[1:11:57] who would dare deny the mighty Ministry
[1:11:59] of Philip now Philip note is the Deacon
[1:12:01] of Acts six five and evangelists who
[1:12:05] would dare deny his mighty ministry
[1:12:07] because he was not one of the original
[1:12:09] apostles he was after the Apostles who
[1:12:14] would dare deny the mighty ministries of
[1:12:16] Iranians Martin Columbo Patrick and
[1:12:18] countless scores of others who have had
[1:12:20] God's anointing on them who would deny
[1:12:23] those things now look at let's look at
[1:12:25] Philips ministry again then Philip went
[1:12:28] down to the city of Samaria and preached
[1:12:30] Christ unto them and the people with one
[1:12:32] Accord gave heed unto those things which
[1:12:34] Philip spake hearing and seeing the
[1:12:36] miracles which he did so here's the
[1:12:40] mighty things he did for unclean spirits
[1:12:42] crying with a loud voice I've seen that
[1:12:44] in my ministry years ago came out out of
[1:12:47] many that were possessed with them and
[1:12:49] many taken with palsies and then and
[1:12:53] that were lame were healed and there was
[1:12:56] great joy in that city amen
[1:12:59] look at the preaching of Christ does
[1:13:00] when it comes in power and demonstration
[1:13:03] it brings great joy to the people but
[1:13:05] the people the preachers everybody have
[1:13:07] to have faith in the Word of God they
[1:13:09] have to believe in the power of God as I
[1:13:12] preached two Sundays ago about faith
[1:13:14] comes by hearing the Prophet said he a
[1:13:17] real preacher tries to find someone
[1:13:18] who's believing what he
[1:13:19] saying it tries to find someone who has
[1:13:21] faith and then tries to get them to
[1:13:23] believe that Jesus is here and will
[1:13:25] answer their prayer that's what we do
[1:13:27] tonight that's what we do every night we
[1:13:29] that's what we do every time we gather
[1:13:31] we try to preach God's Word and get the
[1:13:33] people to accept God's Word that God
[1:13:36] never fails now many people have the
[1:13:40] idea that just the Apostles had this
[1:13:42] ministry not did that again yes the
[1:13:45] Bible way is the real way of the open
[1:13:47] door and I want to add my testimony to
[1:13:51] that the reason I have to do that is
[1:13:53] because I can only speak with assurance
[1:13:56] what God has done in my own life so if
[1:13:59] you'll excuse a personal note here I
[1:14:01] will tell you how I know for a surety
[1:14:03] that Jesus is the same yesterday and
[1:14:05] today and forever and that the power of
[1:14:08] God is still available to those who
[1:14:10] believe and receive so in this chapter
[1:14:14] and a Philadelphia in the church age
[1:14:16] book prophet takes about three or four
[1:14:18] pages and he tells some personal
[1:14:20] testimonies I'm gonna share two of them
[1:14:22] tonight the story was about brother
[1:14:25] Branham details the healing of a Muslim
[1:14:27] woman in Durban South Africa she was
[1:14:30] healed of a cyst on the womb after the
[1:14:33] sermon and her repentance and faith in
[1:14:35] Christ Jesus as her Savior
[1:14:37] so she was healed after she repented and
[1:14:40] gave her life to Christ she said and I'm
[1:14:43] just reading on the end of this
[1:14:44] testimony she said I accept Jesus as my
[1:14:47] savior that did it
[1:14:48] she was healed and about 10,000
[1:14:50] muhammadans came to Christ that day
[1:14:53] because the gospel was preached in both
[1:14:55] word and power God never told a man to
[1:14:59] labour 30 years and harvest nothing he
[1:15:03] gave us the open door of word and power
[1:15:06] and that is what we were supposed to use
[1:15:07] that is what Paul gave his great and
[1:15:10] effective ministry 1st corinthians 2:4
[1:15:12] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:15:14] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[1:15:18] in demonstration of the Spirit and the
[1:15:20] power now I want to bring a balance of
[1:15:24] this as we know brother Branham was sent
[1:15:27] out by an angel he was told you're going
[1:15:29] to go before kings and monarchs and pray
[1:15:31] for kings and everything
[1:15:33] this and so we must note the balance for
[1:15:36] this because the gifts and callings of
[1:15:38] God are without repentance apostles must
[1:15:42] have all these signs okay all believers
[1:15:46] of course will have the signs from mark
[1:15:49] 16 following them as well as a body as a
[1:15:51] group but remember what Paul said in
[1:15:53] first Corinthians 14 are all apostles no
[1:15:56] do all speak in tongues no do all gifts
[1:16:00] of healing you all do miracles no but
[1:16:02] those things should be heard of around
[1:16:04] the believers and remember we cannot add
[1:16:08] one cubit to our stature you know I've
[1:16:11] talked to different people over the
[1:16:13] years and one family in particular that
[1:16:16] used to come to our church but left the
[1:16:18] message one of the individuals grew up
[1:16:20] in a church where they believed brother
[1:16:22] Branham to an extent but they would try
[1:16:25] so hard to be prophets and that's what
[1:16:27] this individual told me they would the
[1:16:29] people in the church would try to speak
[1:16:30] prophecies and they would try to speak
[1:16:33] prophecies over people and and I see
[1:16:35] that in the Pentecostal ranks too you
[1:16:37] know people just they're they're trying
[1:16:38] to add a cubit to their stature they're
[1:16:41] trying to add a gift to their life
[1:16:43] that's not there so we have to remember
[1:16:46] that we can't create any we can't try to
[1:16:49] put on any gift we've got a we've got to
[1:16:52] just be what we're called to be and we
[1:16:56] can't try to impersonate prophecy or try
[1:16:58] to make ourselves some spiritual super
[1:17:00] spiritual person brother Branham had a
[1:17:02] clear gift of God thousands of people
[1:17:05] were healed I've met a couple that were
[1:17:06] healed through bonds ministry it's
[1:17:08] obvious he had this calling it was part
[1:17:11] of the calling for his life
[1:17:12] now but what we need to remember as I've
[1:17:16] preached over and over and as we should
[1:17:18] preach over and over Hebrews 5 last
[1:17:22] Sunday night and the the question was if
[1:17:24] we're tired of hearing the word and the
[1:17:26] words becoming boring and the words not
[1:17:28] the feeling fresh anymore then it's our
[1:17:31] fault because the word has become dull
[1:17:34] to us our ears have become dull to
[1:17:36] hearing the Word of God and then Paul
[1:17:38] says if your ears are dull to the word
[1:17:40] it's because we're not living up to what
[1:17:44] we ought to be
[1:17:46] so that's our question are all living up
[1:17:48] to the word we ought to be is everybody
[1:17:52] in the church ever in our church or the
[1:17:53] lima churches you know is everybody
[1:17:55] living up to what they're supposed to be
[1:17:57] is everybody investing in the spiritual
[1:18:00] gifts in their lives like they ought to
[1:18:01] well probably not because we read the
[1:18:05] quote where the Prophet said if
[1:18:07] everybody was in Harbert the holy spirit
[1:18:08] we'd see gifts multiplying we'd see
[1:18:10] miracles increasing we would see a
[1:18:12] multiplication of that so we have the
[1:18:16] balance where we have to be called to do
[1:18:17] these things but we can't just sit back
[1:18:19] and not pray about it and and devote
[1:18:21] much prayer and fasting to to God's
[1:18:24] calling for our life if we don't if we
[1:18:26] don't see God will never find God God
[1:18:28] invites us to seek Him amen
[1:18:30] seek him with those you'll seek me and
[1:18:33] find me when you seek me with all your
[1:18:34] heart so are their gifts that are not
[1:18:39] being cultivated through prayer and
[1:18:40] faith in people's lives and our lives we
[1:18:44] must look at that and of course the
[1:18:46] balance though with John the Baptist he
[1:18:48] was called to only preach that's what he
[1:18:50] was called to no miracles he didn't know
[1:18:54] americo's core to John 1041 and so we
[1:18:57] must ask ourselves what are each of us
[1:18:59] called to be pressing in and really
[1:19:03] hearing from God well God you know at
[1:19:05] least have an answer you know and say
[1:19:07] well well God hasn't called me to lay
[1:19:09] hands on the sick but God has called me
[1:19:11] to say in fasting the channel of fasting
[1:19:13] or like sister she carrion that was her
[1:19:16] calling to be a prayer warrior and
[1:19:18] fasting well God hasn't called me into
[1:19:21] fasting but God's call me into faith he
[1:19:24] just drops things in my heart and I've
[1:19:26] just got to speak it I've got to share
[1:19:27] those or doesn't calling me in a faith
[1:19:28] but God's calling me in discernment
[1:19:30] there's times I can judge when people
[1:19:32] coming to church I can kind of Judge
[1:19:33] they got the wrong spirit on them after
[1:19:35] church I can tell you know they're
[1:19:37] talking about something I can tell they
[1:19:39] got the wrong spirit how many people do
[1:19:41] we know that are pressing into that
[1:19:43] that's what we need to be pressing into
[1:19:45] in this hour that's why the words be
[1:19:47] coming though because people aren't
[1:19:48] pressing into what's being preached the
[1:19:51] Holy Spirit is asking them to invest
[1:19:52] more the Holy Spirit to ask them to draw
[1:19:54] closer and to have a ministry and to
[1:19:58] become
[1:20:00] but if they don't press into it if they
[1:20:02] keep telling the Holy Spirit know what's
[1:20:04] going to happen their ears are going to
[1:20:05] be dull to hearing the Word of God
[1:20:07] they're not going to be teachers when
[1:20:09] their God has called them to be teachers
[1:20:10] they're not going to have their it's an
[1:20:13] order
[1:20:14] if if they're not obeying what the Holy
[1:20:17] Spirit is calling them to do so I just
[1:20:19] want to make sure I give that balance
[1:20:21] about the Prophet the Prophet had the
[1:20:23] calling remember he got the calling
[1:20:25] after he went into the cave and fasted
[1:20:27] and prayed there it is hallelujah that's
[1:20:29] it right there
[1:20:30] amen so that shows us as the example if
[1:20:34] we really want to know what God has
[1:20:35] called us to do we must fast and pray
[1:20:37] and the Holy Spirit will speak it before
[1:20:39] us so we'll know what to do now getting
[1:20:45] back to the church ages no I'm sorry no
[1:20:48] getting back this is the court I read a
[1:20:49] few weeks ago and when I preached on
[1:20:51] faith cometh by hearing so this is kind
[1:20:54] of it encouraged us you have to watch
[1:20:55] these things because the Christian takes
[1:20:57] up the habits of a Christian and they
[1:20:59] live like a Christian jesus said these
[1:21:01] signs shall file them to believe notice
[1:21:03] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:21:05] they shall take up serpents or drink
[1:21:06] deadly things and they'll speak with new
[1:21:08] tongues and then things just actually
[1:21:11] follow Christians now the person has a
[1:21:14] very good thing here or do we wait until
[1:21:16] the future time or the conditions
[1:21:18] appointed by the Holy Spirit I like that
[1:21:21] so see you just don't try to cast out
[1:21:24] devils that's what the sons of sceva did
[1:21:26] right the sons of schema the seven sons
[1:21:29] they tried to cast out demons and they
[1:21:31] weren't even called to do it or they
[1:21:33] didn't have or they didn't have faith in
[1:21:34] Christ to do it they tried to do it
[1:21:36] before actually having the timing and
[1:21:39] the anointing so that's what we must do
[1:21:41] we must find the calling the anointing
[1:21:44] and then we'll know it's God's time for
[1:21:46] us to do that see now you get the idea
[1:21:50] he says when it's appointed by the Holy
[1:21:53] Spirit God appoints things now this is
[1:21:57] something brother Simon sent me he was
[1:21:59] really encouraged he's a brother Jesse I
[1:22:00] want to send you something it'll really
[1:22:01] encourage you so you is that on the
[1:22:03] screen can you see that I just thought
[1:22:04] that was nice Joseph's waited 13 years
[1:22:06] in prison before he was raised to the
[1:22:09] level that God had called him to be 13
[1:22:12] years
[1:22:13] we've had this church eleven-and-a-half
[1:22:16] Abraham waited 25 years until God
[1:22:21] started supernaturally moving in a great
[1:22:23] way right and brought forth Isaac Moses
[1:22:26] Moses waited 40 years in the wilderness
[1:22:28] before God sent him down to Egypt with
[1:22:31] his a full anointing on him and Jesus
[1:22:34] waited 30 years to start his ministry so
[1:22:37] he says if God is making you wait you're
[1:22:39] in good company like that hey hey man
[1:22:42] see Church if I gotta wait for this book
[1:22:44] of Acts Church time talking about the
[1:22:46] fullness of it I gotta wait till our
[1:22:47] church is fully on fire everybody's on
[1:22:50] fire or if we got to wait a little bit
[1:22:52] longer until the fullness of Pentecost
[1:22:54] we see it in our church on a constant
[1:22:56] basis if we gotta wait little long
[1:22:58] longer we're in good company amen
[1:23:00] because that's the profits of the hour
[1:23:02] and I'm willing to wait till God backs
[1:23:04] up his word amen because we know God
[1:23:07] will always back up his word his word
[1:23:09] can't fail now after that testimony of
[1:23:12] the woman healed from the cyst on her
[1:23:15] womb brother Hannah gave one more
[1:23:16] example of the supernatural power well I
[1:23:21] should say just an example of how we
[1:23:23] should stand up for the supernatural
[1:23:25] power and I shared this a little bit
[1:23:26] last Wednesday I believe brother man
[1:23:28] then tells them the meeting with the
[1:23:31] Methodist missionaries one man to two
[1:23:33] women to Rhodesia who had not one one
[1:23:37] soul to the Lord in three years they not
[1:23:39] one one soul in three years but RAM told
[1:23:42] them at the end he said I don't want to
[1:23:43] hurt your feelings I said but you all
[1:23:46] ought to be home helping your mothers
[1:23:48] with the dishes
[1:23:49] you haven't any business out here on the
[1:23:51] field unless you were filled with the
[1:23:54] Holy Ghost and preaching the true gospel
[1:23:55] in the demonstration of the power of the
[1:23:59] Holy Ghost if you're not seeing the
[1:24:01] results that Jesus said you would see
[1:24:03] it's because you are not preaching the
[1:24:06] true gospel amen so he uses this example
[1:24:09] as brother Branham is seeing many soul
[1:24:13] saved whereas other people without the
[1:24:15] power of God we're not seeing soul saved
[1:24:17] and that ties in again with the open
[1:24:21] door now I got about twenty minutes here
[1:24:24] and I'm
[1:24:26] close with this thought I'll probably
[1:24:27] done this probably a real short sermon
[1:24:29] tonight by God's grace but that's
[1:24:32] alright here's a little thought here
[1:24:36] this is the thought I want to share I
[1:24:37] mentioned this quote I think last
[1:24:39] Wednesday night yeah I think that was
[1:24:40] last Wednesday night I want to mention
[1:24:42] this quote and I want to read this here
[1:24:47] in just a moment by God's grace let me
[1:24:53] looking up one thing real quick I just
[1:24:55] wanted to pull up here now the Holy
[1:25:03] Spirit was making the prophet of God
[1:25:06] rebuked denominations churches unbelief
[1:25:09] individuals anyone that made fun of
[1:25:11] speaking in tongues I just want to end
[1:25:14] with this brother Branham said it was
[1:25:16] the Spirit of God in him that would cut
[1:25:19] people that would rebuke people that
[1:25:22] would try to get them straightened out
[1:25:25] well Graham says that was the Holy
[1:25:27] Spirit making him new that so it's look
[1:25:29] at these quotes here now and as I said
[1:25:32] as I preached through these sermons I go
[1:25:33] back and listen to the actual sermon
[1:25:35] from 1960 and I want to bring out some
[1:25:37] of the most important thoughts and I
[1:25:39] thought this was a good important
[1:25:40] thought to bring out because many times
[1:25:43] you know here maybe on our level and our
[1:25:46] church and other churches people think
[1:25:47] that the pastor of the preachers are
[1:25:49] just cutting at them you know to be
[1:25:51] indifferent or or because they're upset
[1:25:53] or angry or something like that but I
[1:25:55] just want to give you some examples of
[1:25:57] what brother hams talking about here
[1:25:59] when he says it's the Holy Spirit making
[1:26:02] me cut and rebuke and preach against all
[1:26:06] kinds of sin it's not being critical or
[1:26:10] judgmental of individuals from the human
[1:26:12] side it's actually God being critical
[1:26:14] it's actually God trying to straighten
[1:26:16] out and rebuke his people now look man
[1:26:20] sit right here I just have to break in
[1:26:22] on me in the mornings message can't the
[1:26:25] sleep inversion right there I'm sorry
[1:26:27] that's the sleep inversion right there
[1:26:28] can you see it
[1:26:28] when was it at the end time oh when they
[1:26:31] went out see here they're justified by
[1:26:33] faith sanctified justified through
[1:26:37] Luther's message sanctified here but
[1:26:39] they miss
[1:26:40] the open door so the foolish version
[1:26:42] will miss the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:44] the open door
[1:26:47] you see justified by faith through
[1:26:49] Luther sanctified through Wesley's
[1:26:50] message many of them precious Nazarene
[1:26:53] pilgrim holiness Wesley and Methodists
[1:26:55] and so forth all of them live a good
[1:26:57] clean life sanctified and think it's got
[1:27:00] the Holy Ghost now look he's saying they
[1:27:03] live a clean life they think they got
[1:27:06] the Holy Ghost but then he says but then
[1:27:09] he'll hear a fellow speak in tongues or
[1:27:12] something and they'll laugh at him so
[1:27:14] these people that seem to live a clean
[1:27:15] life will actually laugh as somebody
[1:27:18] who's speaking in tongues and they'll
[1:27:20] make fun of him and say oh it's of the
[1:27:22] devil and brother have said brother you
[1:27:26] sealed your doom when you did that you
[1:27:29] blasting the Holy Ghost which is
[1:27:31] unpardonable so see people can live what
[1:27:34] they what they think is a clean life but
[1:27:37] if they make somebody they make fun of
[1:27:39] somebody speaking in tongues or doing a
[1:27:40] miracle and call a devil listen church
[1:27:43] approves they weren't living a clean
[1:27:44] life
[1:27:45] a man had glory they will they were not
[1:27:48] anybody that could last seen all he goes
[1:27:50] is not living a clean life they're just
[1:27:52] going through the motions of religious
[1:27:54] acts they're not drinking they really
[1:27:58] weren't doing that by the power of the
[1:28:00] Holy Spirit if they can blast seem the
[1:28:02] Holy Ghost they were just doing it
[1:28:03] through a religious spirit remember
[1:28:05] brother have said that's the most
[1:28:07] difficult one to deal with is a
[1:28:09] religious demon remember we preach that
[1:28:12] back on the Joshua series that was the
[1:28:14] most difficult demon to deal with and I
[1:28:17] think people around churches in our
[1:28:19] church other churches I think people
[1:28:20] would all say the same thing the hardest
[1:28:22] spirit to deal with is someone who
[1:28:24] thinks they're right thinks they're
[1:28:25] living a clean life but they got the
[1:28:27] wrong attitude they got the wrong
[1:28:29] attitude toward the right people that
[1:28:31] are walking with the Word of God
[1:28:33] yeah that's right he says well you say
[1:28:37] we belong to the first Church I don't
[1:28:38] care how many churches you belong to has
[1:28:41] nothing to do with the has nothing of
[1:28:43] the Word of God and don't take her add
[1:28:45] that's right he says their synagogues of
[1:28:47] Satan now that's just that's hard to
[1:28:49] read it's hard to read
[1:28:53] churches can have people that are living
[1:28:55] sort of clean lives but if they make fun
[1:28:58] of the real Holy Ghost brother Ram says
[1:29:00] their synagogues of Satan which we know
[1:29:02] we've heard god of this evil agent
[1:29:04] anointing once the end times all these
[1:29:06] things we've heard those beautiful
[1:29:08] powerful messages but I want to I want
[1:29:15] to make sure we read the next part but
[1:29:16] Ram said I hope I don't hurt you when I
[1:29:19] say those things because I mean think
[1:29:22] about think of all the adults lives for
[1:29:23] me think about how many nice people we
[1:29:25] know that go to Nazarene churches or
[1:29:28] Catholic churches I met lots of nice
[1:29:30] nice Catholic people I've got children I
[1:29:32] teaching them at the Bible clubs I teach
[1:29:35] and they go to Catholic churches and all
[1:29:38] kinds of non-denominational a Brethren
[1:29:40] Church the Church of the Brethren there
[1:29:41] are all nice people but if they actually
[1:29:45] make fun of the Holy Ghost they
[1:29:46] blaspheme the Holy Ghost unless they did
[1:29:49] it ignorantly like Paul did which they
[1:29:52] can have forgiveness for that but then
[1:29:53] they got to show real genuine repentance
[1:29:54] like Paul did hey they got a really
[1:29:57] repent like Paul he meant now the local
[1:30:01] program says he calls them synagogues as
[1:30:03] saying that he says I just hate to do
[1:30:05] that I hate to talk like that
[1:30:09] but there's something inside of me
[1:30:11] motivating me to do it so what is it as
[1:30:14] a pastor many times I have to rebuke
[1:30:16] some of the same sins over and over and
[1:30:17] over again what's motivating me to do
[1:30:19] that it's the Holy Spirit motivating me
[1:30:22] Branson I don't know why I do it you
[1:30:24] know I don't like to do that I just feel
[1:30:26] awful when I say it but yet I've got to
[1:30:28] say it there's something in me making me
[1:30:30] say it I always hate to cut it women a
[1:30:32] woman can cry and I just feel terrible I
[1:30:35] just hate to cut up women but there's
[1:30:37] something in there that makes me do it
[1:30:38] see and a moral woman oh my I just can't
[1:30:41] stand it because there's something
[1:30:43] inside makes me do it the Holy Spirit
[1:30:46] Holy Spirit makes them cut it immoral
[1:30:48] women and immoral churches people that
[1:30:51] make fun of the Holy Ghost we love the
[1:30:53] Holy Ghost we want the only ghost to
[1:30:55] speak in tongues hear and interpret and
[1:30:57] prophesied give the sermon we want all
[1:31:00] the Holy Ghost has to offer amen to make
[1:31:02] fun of that or to look down upon that
[1:31:05] you're getting close to
[1:31:05] ask me you're getting close to being a
[1:31:08] part of the synagogue of satan' which is
[1:31:09] not our church but you they would be a
[1:31:11] part of it spiritually right by making
[1:31:14] fun and not what the Holy Ghost to move
[1:31:16] who's who doesn't want the Holy Ghost to
[1:31:18] move we ought it we ought to all come to
[1:31:20] church wanting the Holy Ghost to move
[1:31:22] say Holy Spirit move flow through us
[1:31:24] have your way in this church amen
[1:31:28] program said see now look down here in
[1:31:31] the word I think Lord if I'm wrong show
[1:31:33] it to me don't let me do that just to be
[1:31:35] going like that people I will I love
[1:31:38] people you know I do I don't let nobody
[1:31:40] I'm sorry don't let me hurt nobody God
[1:31:43] you know I wouldn't do that same thing
[1:31:45] for a pastor evangelist or anybody you
[1:31:47] don't want to hurt people's feelings but
[1:31:49] you've got to look down at the word and
[1:31:51] preach the Word of God he said but the
[1:31:55] Holy Spirit rise up and say stand on
[1:31:57] that word stay there stay right there on
[1:32:01] that word I say yes Lord you're my best
[1:32:05] friend
[1:32:05] Sosa's he was tempted by all these
[1:32:08] people are your friends the church my
[1:32:10] brother have said no I've got to stand
[1:32:11] on the word because Jesus is my best for
[1:32:13] him then I like that you're my best
[1:32:16] friend you're the only one you're my
[1:32:19] real friend that's the only one that's
[1:32:21] gonna help me when this life is fading
[1:32:23] away amen
[1:32:25] that's why I've got a ball out you know
[1:32:27] media and people worshiping their phones
[1:32:30] and spending more time on their phones
[1:32:31] and then then on their prayer a praying
[1:32:35] a church you know or people skipping
[1:32:37] church and not going back and listen to
[1:32:38] the sermons of people not paying their
[1:32:41] ties or offerings things that got a
[1:32:43] preach on all the time you know falling
[1:32:45] asleep in church you know just not
[1:32:46] hungry for the Word of God you know all
[1:32:48] these things why what makes me say that
[1:32:50] the Holy Spirit makes me say that the
[1:32:53] Holy Spirit made brother Adam ball out
[1:32:54] all kinds of sins
[1:32:56] I remember the Holy Spirit on Peter it
[1:32:59] caught the first sin in the first church
[1:33:01] right it wasn't all sins out it caught
[1:33:03] Ananias and Sapphira sly they were lying
[1:33:06] to say we sold it for this much of now
[1:33:08] we're giving it for this and that the
[1:33:09] Holy Spirit wants to catch every sin
[1:33:11] every little laziness of sin every
[1:33:13] little disobedient
[1:33:14] well the RAM said one way you know you
[1:33:16] got the Holy Ghost it'll catch you on
[1:33:18] every little thing that you do and
[1:33:19] try to get Edward get you to repent as
[1:33:21] soon as possible I'm just paraphrasing
[1:33:23] but I read that a couple Sundays ago he
[1:33:28] said Jesus you're the only friend that's
[1:33:29] gonna stand with me
[1:33:30] when my life is fading away so we gotta
[1:33:32] stay on the Word of God he said so I'll
[1:33:36] stand right with you then Lord hey man
[1:33:39] I'll say hi Ricki Lord amen amen no
[1:33:42] matter who leaves or who stays praise
[1:33:44] God we have to stand with the Word of
[1:33:46] God
[1:33:46] hallelujah my brother Adam said here I
[1:33:51] come I don't mean to hurt please don't
[1:33:53] take me wrong when I'm cutting at them
[1:33:55] organizations and things way before I
[1:33:58] know anything about this all my life
[1:34:00] I've cut out it never did believe it
[1:34:02] that's the reason I wouldn't hook up
[1:34:03] with it all right thank God for keeping
[1:34:05] me away from I said thank God for
[1:34:07] keeping me out in denomination thank God
[1:34:10] for keeping me out of there for all
[1:34:11] these years and pulling me out by God's
[1:34:13] grace he said don't think that I'm
[1:34:15] standing here now look this is quite a
[1:34:17] quote if you wanting our brother man
[1:34:19] talk real in human humble terms look
[1:34:21] what he says here he said I'd rather if
[1:34:25] it be me I'd for me I could compromise
[1:34:29] with myself I hope everybody heard that
[1:34:32] instead of bawling and rebuking
[1:34:35] everybody like that brother Graham said
[1:34:36] it myself
[1:34:37] I can tell I'm more easily likely to
[1:34:40] compromise I could do that myself I
[1:34:42] could compromise and say let's take the
[1:34:45] summaries of God or some movement let's
[1:34:47] just go join them and go along with them
[1:34:51] see brother ham said inside of me
[1:34:53] there's a part of me that wants to
[1:34:54] compromise and church it's in every one
[1:34:57] of us there's a part of us all just
[1:34:59] compromise with with with my parents you
[1:35:01] know and I'll just I'll let the girls
[1:35:03] cut their hair or you know what I mean
[1:35:05] there's all kinds of compromise of us
[1:35:08] that wants to compromise
[1:35:09] oh I'll just let the children watch the
[1:35:10] dirty movie you know or the I'll just
[1:35:12] let them watch the latest movie there's
[1:35:15] a spirit that we're sin inside of us
[1:35:17] sending our members that wants us to
[1:35:19] compromise like brother Graham says
[1:35:21] we'll just go along with the rest of
[1:35:23] them but oh brother
[1:35:25] woe is me if I compromise amen what was
[1:35:29] me whoa is war all of us whoa unto us a
[1:35:32] Bride of Christ
[1:35:33] if we compromise on one word of god woe
[1:35:36] to us but we have said well if I do that
[1:35:40] what was me I know better than that God
[1:35:45] would send me to hell for doing such a
[1:35:47] thing as that is that pretty serious
[1:35:50] Church see inside of every one of us is
[1:35:53] a sinful nature that wants to compromise
[1:35:56] but if you're really born again the Holy
[1:35:59] Ghost will rise up and you won't
[1:36:01] compromise on God's Word amen
[1:36:03] see we got so much compromise around the
[1:36:06] message in a wrestle compo so much
[1:36:09] compromise around families and
[1:36:10] everything there must be no compromise
[1:36:12] with the Word of God and if you've got
[1:36:15] the Holy Ghost it'll help you stand upon
[1:36:17] the Word of God yes sir if I have to
[1:36:22] seal my testimony with my life I'll just
[1:36:24] have to see that's all because there's
[1:36:26] something in me I couldn't do I couldn't
[1:36:28] no more do that than anything in the
[1:36:30] world but RAM said I know this is the
[1:36:35] truth speaking of the Bible I know this
[1:36:37] is the truth and I've got to stand by
[1:36:38] what's the truth and the Bible backs it
[1:36:41] up the organizations against it but the
[1:36:42] Bible says it's right that every man's
[1:36:45] word be aligned his be true that's the
[1:36:47] truth that's it
[1:36:48] just stay with that now I got one more
[1:36:51] scripture or two more scriptures so
[1:36:54] let's go to the book of James I think I
[1:36:56] just read it last week James
[1:37:10] Chapter three pardon me taking me a
[1:37:19] while to get there
[1:37:20] I saw another scripture I want to find
[1:37:25] that scripture just came to me about the
[1:37:28] Pharisees receiving the greater
[1:37:29] damnation
[1:37:30] oh yeah be more tolerable yeah there you
[1:37:36] go or Tyler oh okay now I want to close
[1:37:46] with this thought it kind of goes with
[1:37:48] that idea of people will rot I think I
[1:37:52] preached this on Sunday night right peep
[1:37:56] brother Branham said people wrought more
[1:37:57] around the message of the hour they
[1:37:58] wrought fast around the message than
[1:38:00] they would if they're out an
[1:38:01] organization that's so true people get
[1:38:06] attacks harder around the message of
[1:38:08] course because this is the word of the
[1:38:09] hours is where Satan's bound the most
[1:38:13] but if we don't keep our lamps trimmed
[1:38:16] if we don't stay sanctified if we don't
[1:38:18] stay in prayer and fasting and seeking
[1:38:20] the Word of God our ears become dull our
[1:38:23] eyes become covered over with matter
[1:38:28] we'd say and then those people that do
[1:38:32] that become dull of hearing and and
[1:38:34] never get their spot back they're in
[1:38:35] danger of being make believers the
[1:38:39] people that were hanging right around
[1:38:41] the message of the hour so a bride of
[1:38:43] Christ fellowship and every church
[1:38:44] albian tonight and our churches we have
[1:38:47] the greatest responsibility to keep the
[1:38:50] Word of God we have to keep what we've
[1:38:52] heard we can't let these things slip
[1:38:53] through our fingers like we read earlier
[1:38:55] now James chapter 3 I believe was yeah
[1:38:59] verse
[1:39:00] my brethren be not many masters knowing
[1:39:02] that we shall receive the greater
[1:39:04] condemnation master's means teachers to
[1:39:11] see James is saying we don't need a lot
[1:39:13] of you know Bible teachers we don't need
[1:39:15] you know I know brother man said we need
[1:39:17] more he means around the world but in
[1:39:20] this case James is saying we don't need
[1:39:21] people coming to the pulpit that are not
[1:39:23] called to the pulpit that's what this
[1:39:25] means because they get the greater
[1:39:27] condemnation they get greater judgment
[1:39:30] because they're handling the Word of God
[1:39:32] and Paul said we are not those who
[1:39:34] handle the Word of God deceitfully of
[1:39:36] corrupt or corrupt ibly we handle the
[1:39:38] Word of God with sincerity praise God
[1:39:40] that's why we always want to be open if
[1:39:43] anything's ever preached wrong we want
[1:39:45] to be open come come talk about it bring
[1:39:48] the word to to me all right wherever I
[1:39:50] made a mistake
[1:39:51] and this goes to any church we've got to
[1:39:54] stay with the Word of God now look at
[1:39:58] verse 2 for many things we offend all If
[1:40:00] any man offend not and word the same as
[1:40:02] the perfect man is also able to bridle
[1:40:04] the whole body now next I'm not gonna
[1:40:08] have you turn there but Matthew 10 15
[1:40:10] verily I say unto you it should be more
[1:40:12] tolerable for the land of Sodom and
[1:40:13] Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for
[1:40:15] that City that rejects the gospel of
[1:40:17] Jesus Christ now I don't I thought there
[1:40:25] was a scripture that said the Pharisees
[1:40:26] have a greater condemnation because they
[1:40:29] around the Word of God they were Jews
[1:40:31] they should have known they should have
[1:40:32] recognized Jesus but I got one more
[1:40:34] scripture to prove this here now we know
[1:40:37] that Sodom will have a their judgment
[1:40:40] will not be as severe as cities that
[1:40:42] heard the gospel preached to them and as
[1:40:45] we saw with James James said the
[1:40:48] preachers that are false get the greater
[1:40:50] condemnation because they handled the
[1:40:52] Word of God deceitfully for lust or gain
[1:40:55] or all these things they didn't preach
[1:40:57] the truth to the people now the last one
[1:41:01] is when we read in our family Bible time
[1:41:03] lamentations 4:6 but let me pull that up
[1:41:06] there lamentations 4:6
[1:41:13] lamentations 4:6 let me pull it up there
[1:41:18] this struck me I think I don't know if
[1:41:20] Malachi or Lydia was reading this but
[1:41:21] this scripture just struck me I was
[1:41:23] shocked now this is of course Jeremiah's
[1:41:28] lamentation right before Jerusalem got
[1:41:32] taken captive members a Takei and them
[1:41:34] all got taken captive for the punishment
[1:41:36] of the iniquity of the daughter of my
[1:41:38] people is greater than the punishment of
[1:41:41] the sin of Sodom that was overthrown as
[1:41:46] in a moment and no hands stayed on her
[1:41:51] which punishment was greater for
[1:41:54] homosexuals in Sodom or for Jews who
[1:41:57] didn't live the message of the hour
[1:41:58] it was Jews who didn't live the message
[1:42:01] of the hour see why we've got to stay on
[1:42:03] top of sin we can't compromise on any
[1:42:06] Word of God the judgment is worse for
[1:42:08] those who knew better and remember her
[1:42:10] brother might have said meet preaching
[1:42:12] remember what he said meet preaching was
[1:42:13] from Sunday night there wasn't a whole
[1:42:15] lot of people here so it might be good
[1:42:16] to go over that maybe more people are
[1:42:18] live streaming this Hebrews 10:24 I
[1:42:22] believe it was no it's 26 26 for if we
[1:42:33] then willfully after that we received a
[1:42:35] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:42:36] no more sacrifice for sin Amen we'll
[1:42:40] stand on our feet I'm just saying that
[1:42:41] because it lets everybody know we're
[1:42:42] done here I hope that was a help the
[1:42:45] responsibility of the people of God is
[1:42:47] so great that the punishment on Israel
[1:42:51] was greater than that on Sodom and we
[1:42:53] know as James said the punishment upon
[1:42:54] false preachers will be greater than
[1:42:56] those who weren't preachers brother Ram
[1:43:00] said if I would compromise Jesus would
[1:43:01] send me to hell oh let's all go to the
[1:43:04] Pentecostal church let's all go back in
[1:43:05] denomination there's no compromise in
[1:43:09] the Bride of Christ she's going through
[1:43:12] that open door amen
[1:43:13] she has the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:15] and that will seal her into the rapture
[1:43:18] by the grace of God she'll go through
[1:43:19] the open door amen praise God let's have
[1:43:23] a word of Prayer now Kai you can make
[1:43:24] your way here to them the pulpit by God
[1:43:28] I'm sorry the piano by God's grace
[1:43:31] Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight
[1:43:33] Lord thank you for those that were
[1:43:34] live-streaming Lord or those who can

[1:43:40] open door is laying before us for two
