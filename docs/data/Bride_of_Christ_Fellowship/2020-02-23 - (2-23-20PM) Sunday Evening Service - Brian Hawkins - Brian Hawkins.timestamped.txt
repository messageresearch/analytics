[16:10] Jose before he left he said just pray to
[16:12] me brother Jesse you know we ever you
[16:14] spent a few minutes praying for him and
[16:16] he just got some unspoken needs there
[16:19] for him personally
[16:21] also we prayed for his grandson Samuel
[16:27] last week and he said Sam what's that
[16:30] nephew okay sorry
[16:32] thank you we prayed for his appointment
[16:35] about his lungs and he said it all came
[16:39] back clear so we can thank the Lord for
[16:40] that breaking on but he did ask for last
[16:46] prayer because they think he might have
[16:49] diabetes in the harvest because of his
[16:50] diet

[32:04] God's word again tonight let's sing of

[38:04] [Music]
[38:16] here we are again Amy just thank the
[38:21] Lord for His goodness thank you for his
[38:23] grace thank you all for the hospitality
[38:28] all the fellowship that I've had the day
[38:32] it's good reconnecting with those that
[38:35] you haven't seen in a while but uh y'all
[38:38] are a blessing and just appreciate
[38:39] coming all the time and you know every
[38:42] time I'm invited it's it's been a it's
[38:45] been a blessing okay
[38:47] yeah but uh tonight it's my poor family
[38:53] they gonna listen to this again so
[38:56] I just preached on this last week but uh
[38:59] I just felt supported I was struggling
[39:03] which message to use and that's what I
[39:05] felt led to to come out with and last
[39:07] night this is what I felt led to come up
[39:10] here with so it might be a little
[39:14] different than unusual you know years
[39:19] ago when I first came in or when I first
[39:22] started ministering I was talking to
[39:25] brother Amen about it earlier is that it
[39:29] was a big to-do if you were an
[39:31] inspirational preacher it was you know
[39:34] you kind of looked down on if you do if
[39:36] you had a handful of notes but please
[39:38] don't look down on me I got a handful of
[39:40] notes because I just can't do that I
[39:41] can't remember everything this is just a
[39:46] task to get me in front of talking to
[39:48] people anyways so this is not something
[39:54] I mean don't take it wrong I enjoy
[39:55] ministering to you but being in front of
[39:58] people is not something that I look
[40:01] forward to so therefore I have notes so
[40:05] I hope it's okay if I have notes I've
[40:10] said it at home I'm not I don't think on
[40:12] my feet real well so I can't think of
[40:14] things real fast
[40:16] or if I do I lose track so I gotta have
[40:18] some kind of a guide but you know just
[40:21] as those that feel inspiration is the
[40:25] best way to go and not carry any notes
[40:27] but I do take time to study you know I
[40:31] would have a hard time with just coming
[40:33] out with just a couple things and just
[40:35] reading but just so you know that I look
[40:38] over things and I look and look because
[40:43] and I can't tell you how many times I've
[40:45] had things down and and then go to look
[40:48] something up well that's not right
[40:49] so here AC race you gotta get that out
[40:51] of there that doesn't line up so you got
[40:54] to go another Avenue so I do spend time
[40:59] researching and studying and I spent a
[41:02] lot of time my biggest thing is I'll
[41:04] have all kinds of thoughts written down
[41:06] but then just trying to organize it
[41:09] people have said to me or just get some
[41:11] scriptures together and and just get out
[41:14] there and talk it doesn't work that way
[41:16] it doesn't brother Jesse it just does
[41:18] not work that way because and and my
[41:22] mind and my heart is I want to bring you
[41:24] the best that I I that I'm able to I'm
[41:29] not going to go out on a whim and just
[41:31] grab some scriptures and and throw them
[41:33] out at you and call it good and leave I
[41:35] would I would be doing you a disservice
[41:36] if I did something like that so I
[41:40] imagine brother Jesse does the same
[41:43] thing read it and read it and go back to
[41:45] the message and read it and read it and
[41:47] going back to the message and you know
[41:50] you're comparing everything and you want
[41:51] to make sure everything lines up because
[41:54] I want to be right I want to be right
[41:57] before you and you may disagree with
[41:59] some things I may not have things
[42:01] exactly right but I've tried so it's not
[42:05] some aimless time that I've thrown after
[42:08] that I'm throwing out here so with that
[42:11] being said sometimes I need to babble to
[42:13] kind of calm down but I before I start I
[42:21] want to make sure that there are some
[42:24] things that I'm going to reference and
[42:26] one of one of them is brother Branham
[42:29] his message possessing the gates of the
[42:31] enemy in 1960 and March excuse me in
[42:39] 1964 see that's why I have notes because
[42:42] I would say something wrong but I also
[42:46] have it's a web page that I saw that
[42:50] that helped me along with it it just
[42:53] sparked some I already had the thought
[42:55] so it's not like they gave me the
[42:56] thought so please take that with a grain
[42:58] of salt but I just want a reference it
[43:00] that I have taken some part from that
[43:02] web page it's called set apart people I
[43:05] don't know their stance on God but the
[43:08] word is word so you know just took out
[43:11] this cherry pitch
[43:13] we like pie so let's eat some pie
[43:17] so may the Lord bless it let's bow our
[43:19] heads with saying that those graces
[43:23] Heavenly Father we just thank you once
[43:24] again that we could be here and Lord
[43:27] what a privilege it is to be able to
[43:30] preach your word to your people
[43:32] Noren just a wonderful people that they
[43:34] are Lord it truly is a privilege to be
[43:37] able to come and speak to them
[43:39] especially with a godly pastor and a man
[43:41] that stands on the Word of God and is
[43:43] very diligent and what he does Lord it's
[43:47] not tough fact that I'm following but
[43:49] it's just a different calling that I
[43:51] that I have that what he does and and
[43:53] the Lord this was that's what I believe
[43:57] that you laid on my heart and lord I
[43:59] pray that you would bless it to the
[44:01] years of those that are here to listen
[44:03] and father may we listen with an act of
[44:05] listening and not a passive the Lord
[44:08] just pray again that you would bless
[44:10] this evening bless your word protect my
[44:12] lips then I wouldn't say anything
[44:13] contrary to your word father we just
[44:17] want to be blessed and we just want to
[44:19] praise you and give you all the glory in
[44:21] Jesus Christ's name we do pray amen let
[44:25] us turn to Ephesians chapter 6 and like
[44:33] I said to the home church I'm going to
[44:34] tell you the same thing shortly there's
[44:36] going to be a lot more to this you could
[44:39] say over brother you could have so much
[44:41] more to that and you're absolutely right
[44:43] because there's no way I'm going to
[44:46] exhaust it and there's a lot to it
[44:48] so the Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 12
[44:54] here pages still turning we all set okay
[44:57] it says for we wrestle not against flesh
[45:00] and blood but against principalities
[45:02] against powers against the rulers of the
[45:05] darkness of this world against spiritual
[45:07] wickedness in high places now what I'd
[45:10] like to speak on this evening is
[45:12] possessing the gates of your enemy and
[45:16] to possess a gate of the enemy in
[45:19] ancient time it meant to have control
[45:23] over your enemy
[45:26] so this evening we'll take a look at
[45:30] what the what different gates are and
[45:33] who our enemy is I'm sure you already
[45:35] know who our enemy is is all right so we
[45:38] know that our enemy is is not our
[45:40] brother and not our sister
[45:42] it's a Satan and his army now but these
[45:47] gateways that I'd like to talk about
[45:48] there there's spiritual gateways and
[45:51] again have in mind that the natural
[45:55] types of spiritual so in second excuse
[46:00] me go ahead and have your seats thank
[46:01] you
[46:04] second Corinthians chapter 2 and verse
[46:07] 11 is something that we well we should
[46:13] be living this whole scripture but it
[46:15] says lest Satan should get an advantage
[46:17] of us we certainly don't want him to
[46:19] have an advantage over us so we should
[46:21] we should have the advantage over him so
[46:23] we should take every step of precaution
[46:25] to stay one step ahead of him so he has
[46:27] nothing to hold against us amen and then
[46:30] it says for we are not ignorant of his
[46:32] devices now there are times I'm sure
[46:35] each one of us has fallen we've been in
[46:37] a fallen state but we have an advocate
[46:43] with the father and when we have been in
[46:48] that fallen state we recognize or we
[46:50] know how we got into that condition
[46:53] whether it was a flesh desire or or
[46:57] something less of the eyes or just a bad
[46:59] decision we remember how we got there
[47:02] how we got into that condition so when
[47:05] you remember how you got there you were
[47:08] no longer ignorant of his device amen so
[47:12] when you have that knowledge knowledge
[47:14] could be power but knowledge puffs up to
[47:16] as we said this morning so you want to
[47:18] carry that knowledge with humility and
[47:20] have the understanding that if I come
[47:22] across this situation again I know what
[47:25] happened last time when I fell into it
[47:27] I'll know what to do the next time so
[47:30] you'll you'll be better prepared so if
[47:32] you haven't noticed we are in a
[47:34] spiritual warfare and we all signed up
[47:38] when we said Lord I believe you when we
[47:41] became believers and I remember giving a
[47:44] testimony when I first came into the
[47:47] message and I had no idea of brother
[47:49] Branham said it so which just confirms
[47:52] what he had said is that smoking was a
[47:56] big thing for me
[47:57] so that would that was a that was a big
[48:00] hindrance for me and I wanted to quit
[48:02] but when I quit you know I felt the Lord
[48:06] leading to give a testimony and then
[48:09] it's just it's just mode nobody cares
[48:11] that I quit smoking two weeks ago and I
[48:13] haven't had a sir you know just the
[48:15] different thoughts that come into your
[48:16] mind that you know and that's how the
[48:18] enemy will work that he doesn't want to
[48:20] testify why would he come against us so
[48:22] much if it wasn't going to have some
[48:23] kind of power behind it you know if it
[48:25] wasn't going to mean anything he
[48:26] wouldn't fight against it so much but I
[48:29] just remember getting up and and I said
[48:32] man I've never had so many battles
[48:34] before and here brother branham said the
[48:36] same thing you haven't had any battles
[48:38] until you become a believer man and
[48:40] that's when the battle started you know
[48:42] everything else was kind of easy because
[48:45] you mixed into the crowd pretty much not
[48:47] to say that every person has an easy
[48:48] life I'm not saying that because there
[48:50] are some that have more struggles than
[48:51] others but we're here we're believers
[48:56] and we're pressing the battle we've got
[48:59] so many battles around us but rest
[49:03] assure we can conquer those battles amen
[49:06] so part of the the blessings given to
[49:12] Abraham was given by the angel of the
[49:15] Lord was that his seed would possess the
[49:18] gates of their enemy and which says it
[49:21] in Genesis 22 and 17 it says that in
[49:27] blessing I will bless thee and in
[49:30] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[49:32] the stars of the heaven and as the sand
[49:34] which is upon the sea shore and thy seed
[49:37] shall possess the gate of his enemies
[49:40] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[49:44] the earth be blessed because remember we
[49:48] were talking about this morning about
[49:49] the still small voice because thou
[49:52] passed obeyed my voice now Abraham
[49:56] please God by obeying his voice and we
[49:59] learned in Scripture that obedience is
[50:01] better than sacrifice and even even God
[50:04] himself said in the Old Testament that
[50:06] he did not take pleasure in the
[50:07] sacrifices but it was it was what became
[50:11] a requirement the sacrifices became a
[50:14] requirement it wasn't a pleasurable
[50:17] thing that that's something that God
[50:18] took in it wasn't a pleasure for him to
[50:21] partake in but it was something that was
[50:22] required of man to have fellowship with
[50:24] him because of the fall in the Garden of
[50:26] Eden amen so God loves obedience and for
[50:32] you to believe his word without question
[50:36] now we're gonna get somewhere with that
[50:38] because Abraham was an example of that
[50:41] he was he was an absolute example of
[50:44] believing without questions that right
[50:47] so when when God told him give up Isaac
[50:50] your only Son you know the promise son
[50:52] you know could you imagine me and my son
[50:54] yeah I just got him but he did what the
[50:56] Lord had had told him to do he didn't he
[50:59] didn't he didn't just immediately go to
[51:02] prayer and uh Lord this can't be it you
[51:04] know but he went he took it he believed
[51:08] God had his word and that's how he was
[51:11] blessed so much and in that same way we
[51:14] ought to be as a that we ought to
[51:16] believe God's Word and that's how
[51:18] Abraham became known as father of faith
[51:21] now because he believed he took God at
[51:25] His Word even if it meant giving his
[51:27] only his promised son I should say and
[51:31] not his only son because we know he had
[51:33] more than more than one but of the
[51:37] promised son now man that possesses that
[51:39] faith still we'll take God's Word
[51:42] regardless of circumstances now if you
[51:46] can't do that then you're not Abraham
[51:48] see that's the faith that Abraham had is
[51:51] his see the promise of Abraham was that
[51:55] his seed which is also the royal seed
[51:58] and this seal that he gave Abraham was a
[52:03] seal of promise remember we were talking
[52:04] about
[52:06] Supreme Being and a supreme promise and
[52:08] the supreme faith brings supreme results
[52:10] so who was the one in the Supreme God
[52:12] the Father right so the promise of
[52:16] Abraham excuse me that he gave it was a
[52:20] seal of promise and the royal seed
[52:22] according to Ephesians 4:30 is sealed by
[52:25] the Holy Ghost and after they have stood
[52:28] the test try to think of that he says
[52:30] after they have stood the test many
[52:35] think they got the Holy Ghost many claim
[52:37] to have the Holy Ghost many can show
[52:39] many evidences and signs of it but still
[52:42] if it can't stay with this word it's not
[52:46] the Holy Ghost amen
[52:48] so you believe every word then you are
[52:52] sealed after the test so we have many
[52:57] battles right we have many tests but
[53:00] it's when we accomplish those those
[53:04] tasks that we that we overcome those
[53:07] tests so then he says when we believe
[53:13] every promise in the word then we are
[53:16] sealed by the Spirit to confirm the
[53:18] promise that's the way Abraham did it
[53:21] then and only then have we the right to
[53:25] possess the gate of our enemy you cannot
[53:27] do it until first you become that seed
[53:31] now seed here it's speaking of offspring
[53:36] descendants posterity or future
[53:38] generations he's talking about children
[53:42] everybody kind of knew that right that
[53:44] wasn't some great hidden mystery but
[53:48] similar blessings were it was pronounced
[53:51] over Rebecca Genesis 24 and 60 but in
[53:54] this one it's her family that says it
[53:58] and in the mouth of two or three
[53:59] witnesses let everything be established
[54:03] but in Genesis 24 and 60 it says and
[54:06] they blessed Rebecca and said unto her
[54:08] thou art our sister excuse me be thou
[54:12] the mother of thousands of millions and
[54:15] let thy sea possess the gate of those
[54:17] which hate them now see over
[54:20] was her family giving that giving that
[54:22] blessing but with Abraham it was the
[54:25] angel of the Lord oh my now take note in
[54:34] in these two scriptures the same Hebrew
[54:36] word I guess you pronounce it zero but
[54:40] we know it as seed it's used in both of
[54:45] these scriptures in in Genesis 1 for
[54:48] Rebecca 1 for Abraham the Hebrew word is
[54:53] in both cases in singular form even
[54:57] though it was translated differently it
[54:59] could be translated as seed offspring or
[55:01] descendants but let's specifically look
[55:04] at the blessing God gave Abraham who is
[55:07] the seed of Abraham God is referring to
[55:13] to answer this we will use the scripture
[55:16] to ensure or to interpret scripture
[55:19] Galatians 3 and 16 it says now to
[55:21] Abraham and his seed where the promises
[55:24] made he saith not and to seeds as of
[55:28] many but as of one and to thy seed which
[55:33] is Christ see there there he was talking
[55:36] about Isaac would be the promised son
[55:37] but long term he was talking about
[55:39] Christ down the road amen that there was
[55:42] going to be one that was going to
[55:43] possess the gate of the enemy Isaac
[55:45] didn't possess the gate of the the enemy
[55:47] it was Jesus Christ who came and possess
[55:49] the gate of the enemy is that right so
[55:51] the royal seed of Abraham and from this
[55:59] interpretation it's clear that Jesus
[56:01] Christ is the one who possesses the
[56:03] gates of the enemy has all authority we
[56:06] were kind of talking about that this
[56:07] morning about who who made everything
[56:10] who was a creator of all and in Matthew
[56:13] 20 18 excuse me 28 and 18 it says and
[56:16] Jesus came and spake unto them saying
[56:18] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[56:23] earth and in Philippians 2:10 and 11 it
[56:28] says that at the name of Jesus every
[56:31] knee shall bow
[56:33] of things in heaven and things in earth
[56:36] and things under the earth and that
[56:39] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[56:42] Christ is Lord to the glory of God the
[56:44] Father
[56:45] now it doesn't matter what their stance
[56:47] is in this day if it's believer or
[56:49] unbeliever or
[56:49] atheist or agnostic or whatever it might
[56:53] be it says every tongue shall confess
[56:55] and every knee shall bow to the one who
[56:58] has the authority so we want to lift our
[57:02] God up this and this this evening right
[57:04] now it says notice the natural seed of
[57:08] Abraham let's check some of the natural
[57:10] seed that believed the full promise of
[57:11] God and had no question see that's the
[57:15] seed of the believer that's that's the
[57:18] trait of a believer I should say now
[57:20] remember there were tens of thousands
[57:22] times thousands times multiplied that
[57:24] was circumcised and everything else and
[57:27] still was not Abraham's seed sure that
[57:31] which is do outward is not Jew that
[57:34] which is Jew is inward the same thing
[57:37] for a Christian it's not that outward
[57:39] adorning but it's an inward man it's
[57:42] it's what's on the inside look we were
[57:44] talking this morning it's the makeup the
[57:46] composition of what's on the inside
[57:48] not necessarily blood and the organs and
[57:50] because I hate to say it I'm missing
[57:52] some of that we're all y'all might have
[57:55] some so it's not the inside part but
[57:57] it's what's on the soul the inside man
[57:59] is that right now many of them bitterly
[58:04] failed the day at the drinking of the
[58:07] fountain at st. John 6 it says they were
[58:10] all rejoicing jesus said i'm that rock
[58:13] that was in the wilderness I'm the bread
[58:15] that come from God out of heaven that a
[58:17] man may eat thereof and not die they
[58:19] said our fathers ate manna in the
[58:23] wilderness for forty years that's really
[58:26] something that's a long time forty years
[58:28] they've got the experience they know
[58:30] exactly how to handle things but but
[58:35] where did Jesus say you know in there
[58:37] and they're bragging they said our
[58:40] ancestors ate ate that bread for 40
[58:43] years and Jesus said and every one of
[58:46] them are
[58:47] dead every single one of them are dead
[58:50] so they had nothing to stand on in front
[58:53] of Jesus they didn't really have that so
[58:56] see what I mean see what we were talking
[58:59] about this morning that knowledge
[59:00] puffeth up so it makes you think you're
[59:02] something when you're really nothing now
[59:06] dead take that word and run and see what
[59:09] it means it means eternally separated
[59:11] yet they were Abraham's seed because
[59:13] they had the the circumcision which was
[59:16] a promise it was a covenant the
[59:18] circumcision eternally separated yet
[59:22] they were Abraham's natural seed death
[59:25] means separation annihilation and
[59:28] completely destroyed jesus said they
[59:31] were dead every one of them yet they
[59:33] were circumcised Jews so can you can
[59:35] imagine them puckering up well how dare
[59:37] you talk to us like that we've we
[59:38] fulfilled our end of the covenant but
[59:42] see just because we're Methodists Oh
[59:45] Baptists Presbyterian or message got a
[59:48] little confession or something like that
[59:50] the devil believes just as much as we do
[59:53] amen so but you've got to be identified
[59:56] with it God has got to witness to it by
[59:59] a sealing of the Holy Spirit no question
[1:00:03] of the word he sees ins 430 I know we
[1:00:06] said it but we repeat it again sealed
[1:00:08] unto the day of your Redemption you have
[1:00:10] to have identification with them
[1:00:12] Redemption you had to be part of what
[1:00:15] brought you back anything redeemed has
[1:00:18] to come back to where it fell from to be
[1:00:23] bought back you're not bought by
[1:00:24] somebody else it comes back to the
[1:00:28] original purchaser oh my but we also
[1:00:36] learned from Scripture that Jesus has
[1:00:38] given us authority over the enemy
[1:00:43] hearing some amens that tells me you
[1:00:46] believe that and that wonderful thing
[1:00:50] that we have power over the enemy now
[1:00:53] the context of this next verse is
[1:00:56] spiritual warfare
[1:00:58] Luke chapter 10 and verse 19 Jesus says
[1:01:02] behold I give unto you power to tread on
[1:01:07] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[1:01:12] power of the enemy not just a little bit
[1:01:14] here and there not just in one portion
[1:01:16] here but all power over the enemy and
[1:01:19] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:01:30] could you imagine those seventy that
[1:01:34] were out there or that those those
[1:01:37] disciples that were given the authority
[1:01:38] you know and they came running back to
[1:01:41] Jesus oh man they're just rejoicing
[1:01:43] they're having a good old time could you
[1:01:45] imagine a man you should have seen what
[1:01:47] I did to this demon over here that tried
[1:01:49] to get diabetes on that one you say to
[1:01:51] see what I did to that demon over their
[1:01:52] own food you should have seen him run
[1:01:54] like a chicken because he was scared to
[1:01:55] death when he said boo to me I said boo
[1:01:57] back when you have victory you rejoice
[1:02:02] right so why wouldn't you be happy so I
[1:02:06] can see where that those disciples would
[1:02:08] be happy that they had power of the
[1:02:10] enemy but let's look at verse 20 it says
[1:02:12] notwithstanding in this rejoice not that
[1:02:15] the spirits are subject unto you but
[1:02:17] rather rejoice because your names are
[1:02:19] written in heaven see we have a place
[1:02:22] how much more bless it's not it is to
[1:02:25] know that he knows our name right having
[1:02:29] that personal relationship with him and
[1:02:32] it's not all about the power we rejoice
[1:02:34] in knowing that he knows our name but
[1:02:36] it's not so much about the power as we
[1:02:38] said this morning power without
[1:02:39] character is satanic right we know that
[1:02:42] so when we desire to have power and
[1:02:45] power and power what's the matter
[1:02:48] okay you got power whoo what else about
[1:02:51] it but let's go on a little bit deeper
[1:02:58] John 14 and 12 this is very familiar we
[1:03:02] even said said it this morning John 14
[1:03:05] and 12 it says verily verily I say unto
[1:03:07] you he that believeth on me he that has
[1:03:10] a relationship with me
[1:03:12] you know it's having a relationship with
[1:03:14] our husband alright he that believeth on
[1:03:17] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:03:19] and greater works than these shall he do
[1:03:22] because I go unto my father and
[1:03:24] whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that
[1:03:26] will I do that the father may be
[1:03:28] glorified in the son
[1:03:30] so even still the father is being
[1:03:33] glorified it's not us having power and
[1:03:36] say glorify me and look upon me because
[1:03:38] that's not what love is love Lauren
[1:03:40] death not itself love doesn't point to
[1:03:43] itself but love points to the one
[1:03:45] creator amen love points to something
[1:03:47] else it's not taking on all the credit
[1:03:51] and then he says if you show ask
[1:03:54] anything in my name I will do it
[1:03:56] that's a supreme promise do you have the
[1:03:58] supreme faith oh my but more and more of
[1:04:04] the meat we need to be perfected is that
[1:04:06] right to be more like him staying calm
[1:04:10] in the storms like we were talking this
[1:04:13] morning when Jesus came out and said
[1:04:14] peace be still now is that something
[1:04:17] that we we could that how we are do we
[1:04:20] get all frantic over something that
[1:04:22] happened in our lives and we we just get
[1:04:24] off I can't handle it anymore you know
[1:04:28] if we want to be like him we need to be
[1:04:29] calm in the storms you know if we have
[1:04:34] an emergency at work the people that I
[1:04:35] want to be around are those that are
[1:04:37] nice calm cool calm and collective you
[1:04:40] know you're you're around somebody who
[1:04:42] gets all crazed up and worked up and you
[1:04:47] feel like you did about three weeks
[1:04:48] exercise in two hours you know because
[1:04:50] you're running to and fro into things
[1:04:52] which if you just calm down
[1:04:54] relax put your trusting on you know and
[1:04:58] just think about it a little bit we
[1:05:00] don't have to be up in arms and in a
[1:05:03] tizzy over everything you know that's
[1:05:05] how that's one way that we could be more
[1:05:07] like cameras just be calm
[1:05:10] I know it's easier said than done right
[1:05:13] but not being shaken by every wind of
[1:05:16] doctrine that comes about you know just
[1:05:17] because you hear something well just
[1:05:20] some events that have taken place
[1:05:22] recently I'm not I don't mean to bring
[1:05:24] anything up to stir anything up but
[1:05:26] don't let anything like that shake you
[1:05:28] you stay grounded in the Word of God
[1:05:30] amen
[1:05:32] for if the you know if you were talked
[1:05:34] into this I hate to tell you you're
[1:05:36] going to be talked out of it so if it's
[1:05:38] a true revelation to you you're not
[1:05:40] going to be talked out of it at least
[1:05:42] not very easily you know you're grounded
[1:05:44] and anchored in God you have nothing to
[1:05:46] worry about you just stay calm through
[1:05:48] this storm it'll pass
[1:05:49] it'll pass Paul said not one of these
[1:05:57] things bothers me for he was tied to an
[1:05:59] absolute are you tied to the absolute
[1:06:01] this morning this evening every day
[1:06:03] morning noon and night and every true
[1:06:07] excuse me for he was tied to an absolute
[1:06:09] which is Christ and every true
[1:06:11] achievement is tied to an absolute and
[1:06:14] my absolute is the word my AMSA your
[1:06:18] absolute isn't brother Jesse even though
[1:06:20] that might hurt his feelings I don't
[1:06:22] think so he would think the same thing
[1:06:23] as me my absolute is not brother Jim
[1:06:25] other people's absolute is not their
[1:06:27] pastor our absolute is not brother
[1:06:29] branham or absolute is Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:32] so that's who that's who is the author
[1:06:35] and finisher of our faith that's who we
[1:06:37] look unto that's our husband amen
[1:06:39] I'm sorry but I just think of brother
[1:06:42] Branham as le a czar with when he was
[1:06:45] introducing Isaac and Rebecca you know
[1:06:49] when he went and he got Rebecca and he's
[1:06:50] taking her back I sure hope he wasn't
[1:06:53] flirting with her you know but he was
[1:06:56] telling her all about Isaac right it was
[1:07:00] all about Isaac the ones have been
[1:07:01] getting ready to introduce her to her
[1:07:03] husband so a few if we're sitting here
[1:07:06] trying to flirt with brother Brando
[1:07:08] saying brother Branham is our deity he
[1:07:10] is our absolute oh my we're cheating on
[1:07:13] God there now aren't we it wouldn't be a
[1:07:15] cure it wouldn't be a pure bride
[1:07:18] hey man I hope that was okay but believe
[1:07:25] me I think brother branham has his place
[1:07:27] but and brother Jim's been hitting on it
[1:07:30] and I believe the same way that we
[1:07:32] shouldn't lift him up to date heat when
[1:07:33] somebody said something about him being
[1:07:35] close to Dede he says you're not far off
[1:07:37] he didn't say why you got that right you
[1:07:41] know he just said you weren't far off
[1:07:42] because Brett I think brother Brandon
[1:07:44] thought being a part of God you were God
[1:07:46] not being the supreme deity of God there
[1:07:52] has its it has its place amen
[1:08:00] where was I say I got off track oh
[1:08:04] absolutely
[1:08:05] and every true every true achievement is
[1:08:08] tied to an absolute my absolute is the
[1:08:10] word and everybody else that's really
[1:08:13] born of the Spirit their absolute is
[1:08:15] God's Word I'm tied to it I laid my
[1:08:17] hands upon it and it took my place and
[1:08:19] I've identified myself with him we knew
[1:08:22] that he promised to identify himself
[1:08:24] with us that brings genuine faith
[1:08:30] remember what we were talking about this
[1:08:32] morning about shining your light it's
[1:08:34] not your light and do the works but it's
[1:08:36] not your works brother Branham says that
[1:08:40] brings genuine faith but not your own
[1:08:43] faith but it's his face faith something
[1:08:46] that you don't control he does it now
[1:08:51] when we don't stand in the authority of
[1:08:52] Jesus that he's given us we we give the
[1:08:54] enemy free reign in our lives you
[1:08:57] understand what I mean there so if we
[1:09:00] don't if we don't exercise or so and in
[1:09:03] the Word of God and we just completely
[1:09:05] ignore what God doesn't are alive
[1:09:07] in our lives were you just set your
[1:09:11] Bible down you don't read you don't pray
[1:09:12] well guess what you're opening yourself
[1:09:14] up for the enemy to come in and take
[1:09:17] over you know for for what resistance
[1:09:19] does he have so the more you're into the
[1:09:22] word the more you're into praying the
[1:09:23] more you're into fellowship the more of
[1:09:25] a defense you're building up against the
[1:09:27] wiles of the devil you'll be able to
[1:09:29] quench the fiery darts of the enemy amen
[1:09:31] so now that we have all that established
[1:09:34] let's look at some of these these gates
[1:09:36] that we should possess now what is a
[1:09:39] gate in its original sense an opening a
[1:09:44] door or gate a city a door or gate or
[1:09:48] door port and hence the name porter when
[1:09:51] you read in the scripture that they're
[1:09:52] the ones who opened the door I kind of
[1:09:56] feel I think brother Jesse said it years
[1:09:58] ago
[1:09:58] I feel like Captain Obvious well no
[1:10:03] kidding
[1:10:04] we knew that all right so we're on the
[1:10:06] same page it wasn't anything of great
[1:10:09] mystery or anything right so everybody
[1:10:12] understands what a gate is a door is a
[1:10:14] gate but we'll get into some more but a
[1:10:18] gate of an entrance anything that you
[1:10:21] can enter an exit by of space inside a
[1:10:27] gate or since you come through that door
[1:10:29] we are in the sanctuary so it's an area
[1:10:32] around the gate which is also known as
[1:10:34] the gate well again we'll we'll get into
[1:10:38] that a little bit it's a space inside
[1:10:40] the gate a marketplace or a public
[1:10:43] meeting place a city or a town of might
[1:10:45] have you a gate of a palace or Royal
[1:10:50] Castle a temple or quarter of a
[1:10:52] tabernacle and then you have the gate of
[1:10:54] heaven that's the gate we all want to
[1:10:59] enter through right
[1:11:00] so gateways provided access and
[1:11:03] protection gates provided access into
[1:11:07] towns and and and villages and temples
[1:11:10] and houses you know in the evening time
[1:11:12] they would close the gates and if I'm
[1:11:15] sure you've read in the scripture at the
[1:11:17] evening time that close the gates and
[1:11:20] it's at some that sometimes I had the
[1:11:22] gates closed all the time or just open
[1:11:24] it up to let people in and out but then
[1:11:26] they closed it right back it depends on
[1:11:28] what was at depending on what was going
[1:11:30] on at that time it was a time of war
[1:11:32] they kept the gates closed if it was a
[1:11:34] type of piece of that they were more
[1:11:36] relaxed on it the gates served both to
[1:11:39] allow and to limit access
[1:11:46] when you control the gate you control
[1:11:49] the flow so if you have that door locked
[1:11:52] out there the only way somebody's going
[1:11:55] to get in so you're controlling the flow
[1:11:56] you're not letting any just anybody come
[1:11:58] in you're controlling the flow of who
[1:12:01] comes in now if they get in they'd have
[1:12:03] to go come in some other way all right
[1:12:05] so and then then they wouldn't have the
[1:12:07] proper wedding garment on is it because
[1:12:10] they're coming another way so they're
[1:12:12] not coming through the provided way
[1:12:13] that's the provided way so when the door
[1:12:16] is unlocked it's freely open to anybody
[1:12:20] to come in right so you control the flow
[1:12:23] through the gate in your own home in
[1:12:27] your body or wherever it might be you
[1:12:29] control the flows all right so and
[1:12:31] that's what it gets purpose is to serve
[1:12:33] but gates provided a physical barrier
[1:12:36] with guards to keep watch of of what
[1:12:38] came in and what came out hence hence
[1:12:40] the Watchmen on the on the walls and in
[1:12:42] the towers gates were made of wood
[1:12:45] sometimes covered with metal which would
[1:12:48] be overlaid with bronze gates like this
[1:12:53] we're seen as indestructible until a man
[1:12:57] like Samson comes across the gate oh
[1:13:00] yeah but that was something later the
[1:13:03] Lord right that was by the strength of
[1:13:05] strength of the Lord because no mortal
[1:13:08] man is going to rip the gates off of off
[1:13:10] of a at least the iron gates off of the
[1:13:14] gate off the post
[1:13:16] but what mortal man is going to be able
[1:13:18] to do something like that and it's just
[1:13:20] not gonna happen not without some other
[1:13:24] kind of a help so in this day they would
[1:13:26] need some kind of hoists or something to
[1:13:29] carry the gate if it's made of iron and
[1:13:31] if you have something of significant
[1:13:32] size not going to do it now we have a
[1:13:36] watchman a watchman that clamp climbed
[1:13:40] excuse me gettin tired
[1:13:43] watchman that climbed the ramparts of
[1:13:45] glory the Holy Spirit was sent back as
[1:13:48] the control tower and men and women who
[1:13:50] would believe God where's the control
[1:13:52] tower inside right
[1:13:55] that's the watchman the Holy Spirit was
[1:13:58] sent to us as a why
[1:13:59] spend that watches over us see that
[1:14:01] still small voice when it says don't do
[1:14:03] that you better move now don't listen to
[1:14:08] that and don't repeat that
[1:14:10] you know that's something that we got it
[1:14:12] that's that Watchtower that's that
[1:14:14] Watchmen in the watchtower
[1:14:15] he is our Guardians the Holy Spirit was
[1:14:17] sent to lead man to be the watchman of
[1:14:20] our soul now it's up to us if we listen
[1:14:22] to that school small voice or not it's
[1:14:24] up to us if we're going to listen to the
[1:14:26] watchman now if you read now I can't
[1:14:28] remember where it was now I want to say
[1:14:29] Ezekiel but I'm probably wrong it could
[1:14:31] be a Isiah that was talking about
[1:14:33] watchman one of the night but I'm
[1:14:35] talking about the watchman if the
[1:14:39] watchman gave out the warning to
[1:14:41] everybody and everybody heard it but
[1:14:44] those if they listened then everything
[1:14:48] was okay but if they didn't listen to
[1:14:50] the watchman then their blood was on
[1:14:52] themselves but if the watchman didn't
[1:14:54] give the warning and they were killed
[1:14:56] they were slain then the blood was upon
[1:14:58] the watchman right so the Holy Spirit
[1:15:04] was sent to lead man to be our watchman
[1:15:06] to be the watchman of our soul exactly
[1:15:09] right
[1:15:09] man wasn't to watch one another it was
[1:15:15] the Holy Spirit to watch over us he's
[1:15:17] our tutor he's our teacher the Holy
[1:15:22] Spirit is to teach right it says so in
[1:15:25] the scripture then we cry out to the
[1:15:28] Holy Spirit looking at these things
[1:15:30] watchman what are the night watchman
[1:15:32] what do you see what's going on in my
[1:15:33] life why am I going through this when
[1:15:35] will it be over but everything will be
[1:15:38] okay Psalms 30:5 it says for his anger
[1:15:44] endureth but for a moment in his favor
[1:15:47] his life weeping may endure for a night
[1:15:50] but joy cometh in the morning so hold on
[1:15:54] just a little bit longer joy cometh in
[1:15:56] the morning amen
[1:15:57] we have something to look forward to so
[1:16:00] when you're going through the trial this
[1:16:01] is temporary because the things that are
[1:16:03] seen are only temporary but the things
[1:16:06] unseen are eternal is that right so the
[1:16:09] things that the
[1:16:09] the being that we don't see we have
[1:16:11] something way down the line there where
[1:16:13] he's going to console every sorrow every
[1:16:15] pain amen
[1:16:17] praise God the joy cometh in the morning
[1:16:21] but what good is a gate if there are no
[1:16:23] walls
[1:16:25] we need fortified completely is that
[1:16:27] right if you'd have no wall what purpose
[1:16:30] is a gate just sitting in the middle of
[1:16:31] nowhere I know some weddings now that
[1:16:39] just have the what do you call that the
[1:16:42] arch you call that okay we'll call it an
[1:16:47] arch they just have that set in there so
[1:16:51] that's that's something in my mind so if
[1:16:54] you were to go out into the country and
[1:16:55] you just saw a door to nothing you know
[1:17:00] what good is it yeah you just have a the
[1:17:04] the doorway and you have the door and
[1:17:07] there are no walls and and you see table
[1:17:09] with all this stuff in there well what's
[1:17:11] going to keep the person out what
[1:17:14] goodness the door gonna do if there are
[1:17:15] no walls to fortify to keep what's
[1:17:17] inside all the hidden treasure to keep
[1:17:20] it safe what's the purpose of the gate
[1:17:22] then if you just let anybody in but
[1:17:27] where's the protection nothing would be
[1:17:29] restricted no self-control it'd be a
[1:17:34] free-for-all for wickedness to have full
[1:17:36] rein and that's what we do sometimes as
[1:17:38] we leave the door open I'm trying to
[1:17:44] think it would
[1:17:45] when brother Benson but had in the head
[1:17:48] of the goats get in because we let the
[1:17:50] bars now and leaving the bars now you
[1:17:53] know and that's how the goats get in
[1:17:54] that's how the wickedness gets in that's
[1:17:55] how folly gets in when we leave our
[1:17:57] defenses down but the gate has to have a
[1:18:01] purpose amen
[1:18:03] for how else could Jesus say that he's
[1:18:05] the door of the sheepfold so gates were
[1:18:09] places of where judgment was spoken is
[1:18:13] everybody okay the same
[1:18:15] I just don't want to bore you to death
[1:18:18] but gates were places where judgment was
[1:18:21] spoken people would go to the gates when
[1:18:23] the determination was to be made
[1:18:24] regarding right and wrong it was at the
[1:18:27] gate that government and law was decided
[1:18:30] on and communicated to the people here
[1:18:33] judicial decisions were made the King
[1:18:35] often had a seat or a throne in the gate
[1:18:37] for these purposes and that the example
[1:18:40] of that is in 2nd Samuel 19 and 8 it
[1:18:44] says then the King arose and sat in the
[1:18:46] gate and they they told unto all the
[1:18:50] people saying behold the King doth
[1:18:52] Center in the game so knowing that the
[1:18:55] King is sitting in the gate and all the
[1:18:57] people came before the king for Israel
[1:18:59] had fled every man to his tent so in the
[1:19:02] king when it was announced that the king
[1:19:04] was in the gate all the people ascendant
[1:19:07] so when we say when brother Jesse says
[1:19:09] we're going to have Church all the
[1:19:12] believers ascended right all the
[1:19:14] believers came together in head Church
[1:19:15] 1st Kings 22 and 10 it says in the king
[1:19:19] of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of
[1:19:21] Judah sent each on his throne having put
[1:19:24] on their robes and a void place and the
[1:19:27] entrance of the gate of Samaria and all
[1:19:29] the prophets prophesied before them so
[1:19:32] there's some more issues being taken
[1:19:35] care of at the gate now in 2nd Samuel 15
[1:19:40] and verse 2 and 2 through 6 we'll read
[1:19:45] it says and Absalom rose up early and
[1:19:48] stood beside the way of the gate so
[1:19:51] notice he was standing in the game and
[1:19:53] it was so that when any man that had a
[1:19:56] controversy controversy came to the king
[1:19:59] for judgments a judgment and at the gate
[1:20:01] then Absalom called out to him and said
[1:20:04] oh what city art thou and he said thy
[1:20:07] servant is is one of the tribes of
[1:20:09] Israel and Absalom said unto Him see
[1:20:13] thou matters are good and right but
[1:20:15] there is no man deputed of the King to
[1:20:17] hear thee so Absalom taking advantage of
[1:20:22] this situation Absalom said moreover all
[1:20:24] that I were made judge in the land that
[1:20:26] every man which have any
[1:20:28] soot or cars might come unto me and I
[1:20:31] would do him justice now I do believe
[1:20:33] that the king was judge at that time so
[1:20:35] he was trying to work his way oh that I
[1:20:37] would be king
[1:20:38] it's a self-serving knowing your enemies
[1:20:43] devices and it was so that when any man
[1:20:47] came Knight to him to do him obeisance
[1:20:49] he put forth his hand and took him and
[1:20:51] kissed him he performing the duty that
[1:20:53] he shouldn't have been that that wasn't
[1:20:56] his right position and on this manner
[1:20:59] did Absalom to all Israel that came to
[1:21:01] the king for judgment so Absalom stole
[1:21:03] the hearts of the men of Israel see he
[1:21:05] was trying to undermine King undermine
[1:21:07] King David at that time he was trying to
[1:21:09] put him out so yes treachery even
[1:21:13] happens inside the gate where all these
[1:21:16] things happen now for this temporary
[1:21:18] point of time Absalom had kind of had
[1:21:21] control of what was taking place at the
[1:21:22] gate without the knowledge of King David
[1:21:26] so things like that have it and remember
[1:21:29] in where board Esther where Mordecai he
[1:21:34] heard the the two men planning against
[1:21:39] the king so he heard them inside where
[1:21:42] inside the gate I do believe is where
[1:21:44] the Mordecai was sitting inside the gate
[1:21:46] and he heard the two men just working to
[1:21:50] the overthrow the king so that's where a
[1:21:52] lot of treachery takes places inside the
[1:21:54] gate inside fellowship where gossip
[1:21:57] happens oh my so you control the flow
[1:22:00] you control what happens in the gate you
[1:22:03] hear gossip you don't have to listen to
[1:22:04] it elders gathered in the gates to make
[1:22:10] rulings and decisions Ruth chapter 4 and
[1:22:19] verse 1 is a good example here I'm
[1:22:22] talking about bow has then went Boaz up
[1:22:25] to the gate and sat him down there and
[1:22:28] behold the kinsman of whom Boaz spake
[1:22:31] came by unto whom he said hosts such a
[1:22:34] one turn aside sit down here and he
[1:22:36] turned aside and sat down and he took 10
[1:22:39] men are the elders of the city and said
[1:22:41] sent you down
[1:22:42] here and they sat down because they had
[1:22:44] business to perform let's go to the
[1:22:47] tenth birth first then talking so much
[1:22:50] my words are going together verse 10 it
[1:22:54] says moreover ruth the moabite is the
[1:22:57] wife of my Malone have I purchased to be
[1:23:00] my wife to raise up the name of the Dead
[1:23:02] upon his inheritance that the name of
[1:23:05] the Dead be not cut off from among his
[1:23:06] brethren and from the gate of his place
[1:23:09] Geir are witnesses this day see just
[1:23:15] rulings and decisions and different
[1:23:17] things it took place inside the gate so
[1:23:21] I'm just trying to establish to you of
[1:23:23] how important that happenings are and
[1:23:26] what happens in the gate that it's
[1:23:28] important in verse 11 it says and all
[1:23:31] the people that were in the gate and the
[1:23:32] owner said we are witnesses the Lord
[1:23:35] make the woman that has come into thine
[1:23:37] house like Rachel and like Leah which
[1:23:40] too did build the house of Israel and do
[1:23:43] thou worthily in Ephrata I'm not sure
[1:23:46] how to pronounce it and be famous and
[1:23:48] Bethlehem now see with Ruth and Beth
[1:23:51] excuse me Ruth and Boaz came Oh bed and
[1:23:54] after Oh bed became Jesse and from Jesse
[1:23:58] came David the root and the offspring
[1:24:02] oh my down on the line to the seat of
[1:24:07] Christ amen
[1:24:09] even though we know that Jesus was not
[1:24:11] born of man through the lineage of man
[1:24:14] but born of the Holy Spirit is that
[1:24:16] right but even still through the
[1:24:17] genealogy I preached on line of triumph
[1:24:19] of Judah here didn't I
[1:24:20] so I don't know if everybody here heard
[1:24:24] that me going through the genealogy of
[1:24:26] that whole thing so you see what
[1:24:29] happened there and without obeyed or
[1:24:32] without Jesse how is it going to come
[1:24:34] yeah so this was
[1:24:38] it was predestinated but the gate was
[1:24:47] also a general meeting place when you
[1:24:52] when you say general meeting place I
[1:24:53] can't help but think of the youth you
[1:24:54] know they need some place to go yeah so
[1:25:00] you think of Facebook you think of
[1:25:03] MySpace and MySpace was before Facebook
[1:25:06] I think something like they're around
[1:25:07] the same time and but Facebook somehow
[1:25:09] over overtook him just pushed them out I
[1:25:12] think and became so much more popular
[1:25:14] but then you have Instagram and what are
[1:25:17] all those other ones that don't get it
[1:25:18] it's a snapchat yeah all these different
[1:25:21] ones see you know so you get the idea
[1:25:24] you see him where I'm going with that is
[1:25:26] back in the day they had the gate was a
[1:25:29] place of gathering but now there's a
[1:25:31] gateway to another gathering we'll get
[1:25:34] to that but gateways were the social
[1:25:36] fiber of the community here norms and
[1:25:39] values were determined friendships and
[1:25:41] social connections were made reputations
[1:25:44] were made or brought down how do you
[1:25:50] perform in your gig Psalm 69 and verse
[1:25:54] 11 and I know I have a lot of scripture
[1:25:57] so it's but it's all relative just just
[1:26:01] bear with me for a few more minutes
[1:26:03] Psalm 69 verse 11 it says I made
[1:26:06] sackcloth also my garment and I became a
[1:26:10] proverb to them they that sit in the
[1:26:12] gate speak against me and I was the song
[1:26:15] of the drunkards see even gossip as I
[1:26:18] said happens inside the gate and
[1:26:20] reputations are built up or destroyed
[1:26:22] one or the other proverbs 31 and 23
[1:26:26] excuse me it says her husband is known
[1:26:29] in the gates as known he had a
[1:26:30] reputation built up when he sitteth
[1:26:33] among the elders elders of the land and
[1:26:36] in verse 31 of that same chapter says
[1:26:39] give her of the fruit of her hands and
[1:26:42] let her own works praise her and the
[1:26:45] gates say even when the people talk
[1:26:49] amongst themselves the the social
[1:26:51] connection
[1:26:52] or how people view one another it's all
[1:26:56] talked about inside the gate this is a
[1:26:57] social connection and it's all how you
[1:27:02] when did we read this morning that if
[1:27:05] you say you love God but you hate your
[1:27:08] brother he is a liar right so when
[1:27:11] you're saying oh I love so-and-so I love
[1:27:12] so-and-so and then you tear this one
[1:27:14] down inside that social connection now
[1:27:16] to stay there with me hang out in the
[1:27:18] gate with me what's destroyed a persons
[1:27:22] influence a person's reputation hey man
[1:27:25] we don't want to be we don't want to do
[1:27:27] that so see you control the flow you can
[1:27:30] control what you say and you can help
[1:27:34] guide what others are saying you don't
[1:27:36] have to participate on what they're
[1:27:37] saying you don't have to piggyback on on
[1:27:39] the things that they say now the Gateway
[1:27:43] was the marketplace that was one of the
[1:27:45] definitions that we gave is it's a
[1:27:46] marketplace the economy was controlled
[1:27:49] in the Gateway my movement too fast
[1:27:52] isn't everybody okay when I get focused
[1:27:56] I just go I just don't yeah yes you get
[1:28:00] what I mean
[1:28:02] second Kings chapter 7 verse 1 it says
[1:28:07] then Elisha said here either word of the
[1:28:10] Lord thus saith the Lord tomorrow about
[1:28:12] this time shall a measure of fine flour
[1:28:14] be sold for a shekel
[1:28:16] and 2 measures of barley for a shekel
[1:28:18] we're in the gate of Samaria see so even
[1:28:24] the economy was controlled inside the
[1:28:26] gate so there is a lot that takes place
[1:28:29] inside the gate so there are many
[1:28:32] references to I think that's the last
[1:28:33] one but there are many references in
[1:28:36] Scripture to gates and and what I
[1:28:39] brought forth tonight that that's only a
[1:28:41] miniscule of what's in there so you know
[1:28:44] there's much more that you could read on
[1:28:45] it but uh but just to show you how how
[1:28:51] significant gates were in the Bible but
[1:28:54] when we consider how gates function we
[1:28:56] understand how important it was for a
[1:28:57] city or a community to be in possession
[1:29:00] of their own gate waste if their enemy
[1:29:02] had possession the enemy would be able
[1:29:05] to control em
[1:29:06] free area of their lives everything
[1:29:09] every facet of their lives they'd be
[1:29:10] able to control it they would tell it
[1:29:14] dictate how they would live how they
[1:29:15] would believe try to tell you how to
[1:29:17] believe how you should dress they would
[1:29:20] control everything so we also know that
[1:29:23] the natural types of spiritual and
[1:29:25] understanding the natural gives us an
[1:29:27] insight into the spiritual realm so when
[1:29:29] we go further and consider these
[1:29:31] physical gateways as representative to
[1:29:33] spiritual gateways we understand how
[1:29:35] essential it is for us to possess our
[1:29:37] own gates and not to let us slip into
[1:29:40] possession of the enemy allowing this
[1:29:42] would allow the enemy to have control
[1:29:44] over every area of our lives our economy
[1:29:48] or our finances our social norms our
[1:29:50] values our friendships and our social
[1:29:54] connections every day key decisions
[1:29:56] government and laws our physical
[1:29:59] protection see that's what the gate is
[1:30:02] protecting you from all those things
[1:30:07] that you hold dear it's protecting it
[1:30:11] it's not letting the outside world come
[1:30:13] in but it's shunning the very the the
[1:30:18] very appearance of evil anything that
[1:30:20] would be contrary to God it's trying to
[1:30:23] keep out as long as you let it stay out
[1:30:25] but as soon as you open that door it's
[1:30:27] welcome to come in and just take control
[1:30:29] but a gateway in ancient context had a
[1:30:32] major influence over the lives of the
[1:30:34] people within the gates so whoever
[1:30:36] controlled the gateway controlled the
[1:30:37] lives of the people now as I said there
[1:30:39] are many references to gates being
[1:30:42] mentioned in the Bible so if you want to
[1:30:46] read this for further reading later or
[1:30:49] whatever but there's also the gate of
[1:30:51] heaven and we I think I talked about
[1:30:54] that before about keys so there's the
[1:30:58] gates of hell and there's gates of
[1:31:01] righteousness and there's gates of death
[1:31:04] but these references confirm the gates
[1:31:07] can indeed be spiritual so these ones
[1:31:09] that I just mentioned are more relative
[1:31:11] to spiritual spiritual gates
[1:31:20] now when I hear the word gateway I think
[1:31:25] of a router that's because I was I was
[1:31:28] in the computers I was kind of getting
[1:31:30] into IT a little bit so when you think
[1:31:33] of a router what a router is going to do
[1:31:36] is it's it's also known as a gateway it
[1:31:40] has that's part of the computer that
[1:31:47] talks to other protocols to allow this
[1:31:49] permission and deny this one and allow
[1:31:51] this one it allows all the software and
[1:31:54] the hardware to communicate but do you
[1:31:57] know this as the Internet I know you all
[1:31:59] know what I'm talking about but as I
[1:32:06] said when I think of Gateway that's
[1:32:08] pretty much what my mind first goes to
[1:32:11] as a router so and when you have a
[1:32:15] router you could set up certain
[1:32:16] permissions to control the flow of what
[1:32:19] enter what access you allow the Internet
[1:32:22] to come in they've kind of made it a
[1:32:25] little bit more difficult now with with
[1:32:27] the technology trying to get things set
[1:32:29] up to control the flow because these
[1:32:31] hackers they could pretty much get
[1:32:32] through anything
[1:32:33] and so those walls that you try to put
[1:32:35] up and it's almost useless you got to
[1:32:38] stay on top of these on top of these
[1:32:39] guys and by the new the latest and
[1:32:41] greatest software for a small fortune an
[1:32:44] arm here or finger there so you know
[1:32:46] you've just got to be careful with you
[1:32:48] which you allow through the internet see
[1:32:51] the TV brother branham talked about the
[1:32:52] TV allowing Satan into your home through
[1:32:55] the TV instead of going out to the movie
[1:32:57] house you brought it into your home now
[1:32:59] see we have something that's even worse
[1:33:00] than the TV called the Internet because
[1:33:02] you can access anything through the
[1:33:03] internet you know people say it all the
[1:33:07] time you can find anything you want on
[1:33:09] the Internet but why is it that I have a
[1:33:10] hard time finding what I'm looking for
[1:33:12] yeah you can find anything but what
[1:33:15] you're looking for yeah I'm trying to
[1:33:17] work on a vehicle and I'm trying to find
[1:33:18] a specific thing and when you know what
[1:33:20] I can't find it for that specific
[1:33:22] vehicle I can find it for all these
[1:33:23] other hundreds of vehicles but I can't
[1:33:25] find it for the specific one that we
[1:33:27] have
[1:33:28] so you can find anything what you want
[1:33:30] except what you need but this is my take
[1:33:36] on on gateways is the internet that's
[1:33:39] like I said that's like the first thing
[1:33:41] that comes to my mind talking about
[1:33:42] gateway because truly that what we allow
[1:33:47] to come in into our minds that's going
[1:33:52] to dictate whether we have mind battles
[1:33:54] or whether we have peace of mind you
[1:33:58] know it plays a big part so if you allow
[1:34:01] yourself to watch something are I
[1:34:02] shouldn't watch that movie you know some
[1:34:05] of them I don't even want to name any
[1:34:06] names because I don't want to give any
[1:34:07] credit to them but you watch some
[1:34:10] ungodly movies made back in the where I
[1:34:12] could think up now but I still don't
[1:34:14] want to say but back in the 80's 90's
[1:34:17] you know I grew up watching movies
[1:34:19] always movie fanatic but if you watch
[1:34:24] one now when you get done your why don't
[1:34:27] I just watch that I knew that was wrong
[1:34:29] and now you're gonna be thinking about
[1:34:31] that movie you're gonna think about all
[1:34:32] the things that you saw in there and you
[1:34:34] can't unsee those pictures that you see
[1:34:36] unless it's by the grace of God you know
[1:34:40] just so all those all those movies you
[1:34:43] know and I wish I could remember I wish
[1:34:47] I could forget some of those scripts
[1:34:49] because if I was if I was to watch some
[1:34:50] of those movies I'd be able to quote
[1:34:51] some of the lines up to you why can't I
[1:34:53] do that with the Word of God you know I
[1:34:56] don't I don't know why that's such a
[1:34:57] struggle same thing with music you will
[1:35:00] be talking at work somebody will say
[1:35:01] something then I'll just break I won't
[1:35:03] sing it but I'll just break out the line
[1:35:04] of a song and I don't even know the
[1:35:07] whole song but it's just stuff that I
[1:35:08] remember when I was younger I wish I
[1:35:10] could forget those things but but for
[1:35:13] some reason they're still there and I've
[1:35:17] prayed about it Lord take this out of my
[1:35:18] I don't want to think on those things
[1:35:20] because I want to meditate on those
[1:35:21] things that are that are good those
[1:35:23] things that are lovely you know I want
[1:35:25] to meditate upon God's Word but uh a few
[1:35:30] more minutes is that Alright
[1:35:33] but we can define gateways as a place of
[1:35:35] Dominion mm-hmm
[1:35:36] by Dominion we mean a territory or
[1:35:39] sphere of influence or control a
[1:35:42] position of power and strength and this
[1:35:50] is something else I want to get to about
[1:35:51] the the Gateway as far as the Internet I
[1:35:56] think this is yeah this is brother
[1:35:57] branham here excuse me
[1:36:00] and of course there isn't a whole wall
[1:36:02] of belief here tonight and if I ever ask
[1:36:06] you to bow your head don't think heart
[1:36:08] of that because there's many people
[1:36:10] really there's many people really think
[1:36:13] that they believe it's kind of what I
[1:36:16] was talking about this morning they say
[1:36:18] they think that they really believe but
[1:36:19] way down in the sub-conscience
[1:36:22] some conscious is a little something
[1:36:24] there that says no there's something in
[1:36:29] the subconscious no matter what you say
[1:36:30] but something deep inside says I don't
[1:36:33] believe that that's not for me or it
[1:36:37] might be the days of miracles have
[1:36:38] passed you know that's good for
[1:36:40] so-and-so but not good for me if you
[1:36:42] only knew what I did what I've done it
[1:36:44] doesn't matter what you've done as long
[1:36:45] as you've repented of it I had a fellow
[1:36:48] at work just asked me the other day we
[1:36:50] were talking about forgiveness he says
[1:36:52] now how do you how do you what's your
[1:36:55] view on God and forgiveness and do you
[1:36:59] think God remembers it I said not a fit
[1:37:01] stone in the sea of forgetfulness you
[1:37:03] come with a contrite heart and a
[1:37:05] contrite spirit a broken heart contrite
[1:37:07] spirit and you come before you before
[1:37:09] him in sincerity and you come in him
[1:37:11] come before him and truth and lay
[1:37:14] confession down I believe you're
[1:37:17] forgiven of it no matter what it was and
[1:37:19] it's thrown in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:37:20] now we can't think of God as a man
[1:37:23] because man remembers but what we do is
[1:37:28] we just don't we might forgive sometimes
[1:37:31] it's hard to forgive but when we forgive
[1:37:33] we don't forget but we just don't trust
[1:37:35] and that's the hard thing is that you
[1:37:39] have a hard time trusting that person
[1:37:41] and no matter how much they've groveling
[1:37:43] at your feet please forgive me please
[1:37:44] forgive me I'll never do it again
[1:37:46] we still have a hard time trusting
[1:37:49] that's just our makeup of man it's one
[1:37:51] of our defense mechanisms it's just the
[1:37:53] way we are so sometimes I have to get to
[1:37:59] get the people to bow their head because
[1:38:01] the eye is the gateway to the soul so
[1:38:06] what you allow your eyes to see it's
[1:38:09] entering in through your soul and it's
[1:38:11] influencing what's down in your soul
[1:38:15] we're gonna get to that here in a minute
[1:38:17] but they're looking to see what they can
[1:38:19] see
[1:38:20] let's see people have to see something
[1:38:22] tangible they want to see what's going
[1:38:24] on they want to see the move of God
[1:38:26] happen and they just can't take it for
[1:38:28] what it is they actually have to to see
[1:38:31] so any caution about that and I'm sure I
[1:38:35] think you've taught on that brother
[1:38:36] Jesse about closing your eyes during
[1:38:38] prayer especially when when casting out
[1:38:40] demons you don't want your eyes open and
[1:38:44] why is that because they could transfer
[1:38:47] from one person to the next and if
[1:38:48] you're irreverent in prayer and you're
[1:38:50] just watching what's going on is it man
[1:38:52] I don't believe this is just a hoax
[1:38:54] well ah there with the demon out of that
[1:38:57] person guess where it went right into
[1:38:59] you because as irreverence the
[1:39:02] disrespect for God and just the
[1:39:06] irreverence of not bowing your head
[1:39:08] that's what's going to bring damnation
[1:39:10] upon you that's just what happens and he
[1:39:15] says and sometimes you have to ask them
[1:39:17] you won't think bad about that as what
[1:39:20] he was asking but uh as far as the
[1:39:24] internet and TV different things
[1:39:27] magazines whatever it might be the eye
[1:39:30] is the gateway to the soul you know and
[1:39:33] just some of those things that you see
[1:39:36] you can't take it back you cannot unsee
[1:39:38] it you know sometimes we talk about that
[1:39:40] I don't even know if that's a word but
[1:39:42] that that's what we say it worked you
[1:39:44] know if when somebody describes somebody
[1:39:46] you know a not-so-pleasant ways like oh
[1:39:49] man now I can't unsee that thank you for
[1:39:51] putting that image in my mind now I
[1:39:52] can't now that's gonna be in my mind and
[1:39:54] that's true that's what happens to us is
[1:39:56] then you'll start thinking about it and
[1:39:58] then when somebody brings something up
[1:39:59] guess what that's what you
[1:40:00] think about it's a mind battle that you
[1:40:03] so why would you increase your battles
[1:40:06] that you have already so stay away from
[1:40:08] it but don't be ignorant of the enemy's
[1:40:12] devices hey men
[1:40:13] now gateways can be very personal we
[1:40:17] individually have spirit soul and body
[1:40:20] gateways our body for example has five
[1:40:25] gateways touch taste smell sight and
[1:40:28] hearing fine our spirit has five senses
[1:40:34] now if you read through the message and
[1:40:37] you start searching through this you're
[1:40:38] gonna find he says different things at
[1:40:40] different times and so I just had to and
[1:40:43] I knew he said it somewhere I just
[1:40:44] couldn't find it and I was getting in a
[1:40:46] hurry so I took the ones the the most
[1:40:50] recent I should say the latest in years
[1:40:52] so but he said that the five senses
[1:40:55] spirits the five senses of the spirit
[1:40:59] our thought memory conscience reasoning
[1:41:03] and affection if I have that wrong
[1:41:06] brother please let me know but our soul
[1:41:09] has only how many gateways one gateway
[1:41:15] and that's free moral agency or self
[1:41:18] we'll say somebody who is pulling stuff
[1:41:20] out this afternoon trying to get ahead
[1:41:23] of everybody else but when is he says
[1:41:29] this but when it's directed from the
[1:41:30] inside it throws all the rest of it
[1:41:33] together
[1:41:34] that's the guidepost that's the control
[1:41:37] tower which is on the inside the inside
[1:41:40] of the inside
[1:41:41] he says the soul controls the spirit and
[1:41:44] the spirit controls the body and that's
[1:41:47] in works as faith expressed 65 November
[1:41:49] 26 now see faith is the one that's not
[1:41:53] exercised very much that's also known as
[1:41:56] The Sixth Sense which is hardly pulled
[1:42:00] out as one of the wild cards in our deck
[1:42:04] we tend to forget about faith it's often
[1:42:08] set aside well as we said this morning
[1:42:10] it takes faith to flip on a light switch
[1:42:12] it takes faith to start your card
[1:42:14] put the key in the ignition and start to
[1:42:16] start to start the vehicle or whatever
[1:42:18] it might be simple faith like that we
[1:42:21] tend to forget we get in a tizzy like I
[1:42:23] was talking earlier about about being
[1:42:25] calm in the storms we just let it take
[1:42:28] control of us instead of us taking
[1:42:30] control of the situation we allow it to
[1:42:32] control us because we forget we forget
[1:42:35] who we are we live under our privileges
[1:42:38] we forget that we're sons and daughters
[1:42:40] of God and then oh how am I going to get
[1:42:43] out of this one well who got you out of
[1:42:45] the last one it's the same it's not
[1:42:49] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:42:51] and forever
[1:42:52] so if Jesus Christ delivered you last
[1:42:54] week what's going to prevent him from
[1:42:55] delivering you this week is he not still
[1:42:58] the same Amen that's our God amen
[1:43:03] but now all of our gateways everything
[1:43:06] our spirit soul in our body everything
[1:43:11] all of our gateways must be subject to
[1:43:13] God's Authority defilement of any of
[1:43:16] these gateways will not only affect our
[1:43:18] lives but also our relationship with God
[1:43:22] we certainly wouldn't knowingly allow
[1:43:25] the enemy to have access or control of
[1:43:27] our gateways yet we allow him access
[1:43:29] because we are not Watchmen on the walls
[1:43:32] of our own gateways we're not paying
[1:43:34] attention again what we read earlier
[1:43:36] this morning we should not be ignorant
[1:43:38] of our enemy's devices we should have we
[1:43:41] should be knowledgeable of how he works
[1:43:45] but Satan knows these spiritual
[1:43:48] principles and works hard to control us
[1:43:50] and sadly we allow it due to our
[1:43:52] ignorance hmm all right a few more
[1:44:03] minutes a few more minutes okay okay I
[1:44:09] did like this study it was a pretty good
[1:44:13] study you know many times we just read
[1:44:20] over scripture because we get in our
[1:44:22] minds I gotta have my devotions I got to
[1:44:24] get my devotion time in let's see well
[1:44:27] looks like a good spot Isaiah 29 what a
[1:44:30] arial 'arial is city winter David dwelt
[1:44:32] in New Year all right I did my duty
[1:44:35] let's go to work sometimes we do that
[1:44:38] because we get so much under a hurry but
[1:44:40] we don't give God our time yes I'm
[1:44:43] guilty of that I'm preaching to myself
[1:44:44] so if I could preach myself I could
[1:44:46] preach to you right all right we got
[1:44:47] that taken care of
[1:44:48] so yes what happens is we don't give God
[1:44:53] the time that we have that we need to
[1:44:55] give him and in our prayer life we
[1:44:58] forget about the sixth sense of faith we
[1:45:00] forget about God who delivered us from
[1:45:02] previous issues that we had and now we
[1:45:07] forget about prayer prayer is one of the
[1:45:11] most one of the biggest weapons we have
[1:45:13] against the enemy is all right it's one
[1:45:15] of the biggest weapons we have and one
[1:45:17] of the less least used oh my but when we
[1:45:23] pray regularly regularly to God at a
[1:45:26] specific place or an altar it an altar
[1:45:30] is established a prayer altar creates a
[1:45:33] gateway to heaven you are accessing a
[1:45:37] channel that accesses the gateway to
[1:45:39] heaven you don't need a priest you don't
[1:45:45] need to confess your sins to somebody
[1:45:48] else yes the scripture says confess your
[1:45:49] faults one to another but you don't need
[1:45:52] a priest for we have one mediator
[1:45:54] between man and God and it's the man
[1:45:57] Jesus Christ is that right you don't
[1:45:59] need to go to somebody else to get
[1:46:01] forgiveness of it the forgiveness of
[1:46:04] sins you go to one and that that's
[1:46:07] that's one of the downfalls we have is
[1:46:09] we don't know how to pray to God well
[1:46:13] you think you got to come up with these
[1:46:15] these flowery words and and these great
[1:46:18] big words to please God to make yourself
[1:46:21] sound educated he already knows you're
[1:46:22] in your ignorance right he knows our
[1:46:27] human infallibility he knows our faults
[1:46:31] and our failures but you know let us
[1:46:36] have a little talk with Jesus tell them
[1:46:40] all about
[1:46:41] struggles troubles what does it say but
[1:46:46] so we're sitting down talking to God you
[1:46:50] could talk to God you have direct
[1:46:52] contact with God you don't have to
[1:46:55] conjure up you know a burn incense you
[1:46:57] don't have to conjure up some spirits
[1:46:59] just for you to talk to God you don't
[1:47:00] have to deal with some man to get access
[1:47:02] to God no but you have direct access to
[1:47:05] God and just to talk to him
[1:47:08] that's all yeah and what a privilege it
[1:47:09] is you don't we don't understand the
[1:47:11] privilege that we have that we were able
[1:47:13] to speak to God yes because all you have
[1:47:17] to do is just just like you're talking
[1:47:19] to me just like you're talking to
[1:47:20] brother vang brother Jesse and my wife
[1:47:22] that's all you had to do just talk to
[1:47:26] him normal not like he's some far-off
[1:47:29] distance he's right there and you don't
[1:47:32] have to shout cuz he's right there he
[1:47:34] could hear you you don't have to slam on
[1:47:37] the older you don't have to beat on the
[1:47:39] pulpit you don't have to beat on drums
[1:47:40] he can hear you amen
[1:47:46] it's your direct access it's you
[1:47:49] speaking to God live dear is there a
[1:47:54] friend that sticks closer as a brother
[1:47:56] it's our Lord Jesus Christ right amen
[1:47:59] but when we enter that prayer we opened
[1:48:02] up that channel we opened up that gate
[1:48:04] for communication with him we open that
[1:48:07] line of communication but it's not just
[1:48:10] us talking it's not a monologue but it
[1:48:15] should be a dialogue or at least if it
[1:48:17] is a monologue it should be more God
[1:48:19] speaking than us speaking so we should
[1:48:22] be listening for his voice when we talk
[1:48:24] to him when when we have conversation
[1:48:26] with one another do we allow the other
[1:48:28] person to speak or do you just overrun
[1:48:31] the whole conversation you see what I
[1:48:34] mean so we shouldn't spend all of our
[1:48:36] time in prayer just talking and babbling
[1:48:38] all these vain babblings and and this
[1:48:40] and this and this and this God knows
[1:48:42] your struggles he knows your troubles
[1:48:45] he's not ignorant to them but he just
[1:48:48] wants you to talk to him for a little
[1:48:49] while you know what's wrong with a
[1:48:51] relationship with your husband with
[1:48:55] what kind of relationship would a wife
[1:48:56] in it and a husband be if they didn't
[1:48:59] talk to one another there's separate
[1:49:01] rooms that are passing well that's a
[1:49:05] close marriage isn't it we want
[1:49:09] everybody's marriage to be like ours
[1:49:10] it's so sweet but we don't talk to one
[1:49:12] another
[1:49:14] some people might feel that's bliss I
[1:49:16] don't know but but it shouldn't be you
[1:49:21] know we should be able to talk to God
[1:49:22] sorry that yeah that was that wasn't in
[1:49:24] my nose brother yeah I think I said the
[1:49:28] same thing at the other church but it's
[1:49:29] still cousin my mind is that people just
[1:49:32] have the wrong idea about prayer I think
[1:49:34] and that's what hinders us a lot of why
[1:49:36] we don't receive things one you got to
[1:49:41] believe that he is and that he's a
[1:49:42] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:49:44] him right so that that's kind of the
[1:49:46] first step so or if you don't believe in
[1:49:49] God that he's gonna answer your prayer
[1:49:50] than why talk to him in the first place
[1:50:00] when we call upon Jesus name which means
[1:50:03] to worship Him and pray to Him
[1:50:04] a prayer altar is established and a
[1:50:06] gateway is formed into the heavenlies
[1:50:14] second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse
[1:50:17] 3 says for though we walk in the flesh
[1:50:22] we do not war after the flesh for the
[1:50:28] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[1:50:30] but mighty through God to the pulling
[1:50:37] down of strongholds casting down
[1:50:39] imaginations and every high thing that
[1:50:44] exalts that exalteth itself against the
[1:50:46] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:50:49] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:50:52] of Christ so every thought that is
[1:50:56] unlike God or tries to exalt itself
[1:50:59] above God you must consciously take a
[1:51:04] hold of that thought and bring it into
[1:51:06] subjection unto the word
[1:51:10] it's something that you control you
[1:51:13] control that gate in your mind you
[1:51:19] control what you allow yourself to see
[1:51:21] granted sometimes there are billboards
[1:51:23] out there that that you really didn't
[1:51:25] want to see but when you allow yourself
[1:51:27] you completely drop the barn you allow
[1:51:30] yourself to to look at those things
[1:51:33] that's where it comes in you know if you
[1:51:37] innocently look at something - lord I
[1:51:39] didn't want to see that you know it's
[1:51:41] not a desire that was down in your heart
[1:51:43] for you to look at unless you take a
[1:51:46] second look but casting excuse me
[1:51:53] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:51:55] the obedience of Christ
[1:51:57] and having an ax readiness to revenge
[1:51:59] all disobedience when your obedience is
[1:52:02] fulfilled so you can have revenge by
[1:52:07] being obedient through your obedience
[1:52:09] you revenge against disobedience
[1:52:13] musicians you can come home I'm gonna
[1:52:15] start closing winding down here but like
[1:52:19] I said whoever has control of the gate
[1:52:20] has control of the inside you know just
[1:52:23] like the the black and the white dog
[1:52:25] it's it's uh that goes what was that
[1:52:36] with with Abraham and Sarah
[1:52:40] yeah with King Abimelech thinking was
[1:52:43] what it was when he was innocent going
[1:52:46] to the innocence part of it
[1:52:49] when Abimelech saw Sarah he desired to
[1:52:54] have Sarah and he he set set forth to
[1:52:57] marry her right so what happened is in
[1:53:00] the dream God came and said you're as
[1:53:02] good as a dead man if you do it what
[1:53:04] you're planning on doing and what it
[1:53:06] Abimelech said I'm innocent I didn't
[1:53:08] know he lied to me he told me it was his
[1:53:10] sister and what did God say he said I
[1:53:13] know you're innocent that's why I'm
[1:53:15] coming to you that's why I'm telling you
[1:53:18] to you talk to Abraham my prophet and
[1:53:22] didn't pray for you now we were talking
[1:53:27] about free moral agency earlier today
[1:53:30] bin Malik
[1:53:31] that this is an example of the free
[1:53:33] moral agency granted God came and told
[1:53:35] him and said if you do this thing you're
[1:53:39] as good as a dead man but if you don't
[1:53:41] you go have Abraham come and pray for
[1:53:43] you that was a decision that was laid in
[1:53:45] a BIM Alexa
[1:53:48] now somebody came to me later he was
[1:53:51] messing with me
[1:53:52] saying well did he really have a
[1:53:54] decision did he really have an option
[1:53:57] well not really but he made the he made
[1:54:00] the right decision because one was of
[1:54:03] life and one was of death right that was
[1:54:05] the decision that he was faced with
[1:54:07] could he have said no and went to marry
[1:54:10] I forgot her name Sarah if if he would
[1:54:15] have said no and I'm gonna marry Sarah
[1:54:18] anyway that was his free moral agency
[1:54:21] that was a choice he had to make but he
[1:54:24] decided to go in the way of that's
[1:54:26] that's still small voice is that right
[1:54:29] he went according to the voice and in
[1:54:32] that way proves that that it was life is
[1:54:35] that right now getting back to the the
[1:54:37] white and the black dog you know
[1:54:39] everybody should be familiar with that
[1:54:40] story that brother branham talked about
[1:54:42] the indian man and said that he had a
[1:54:45] dream of a black dog and a white dog and
[1:54:47] and the fella asked him well which one
[1:54:49] wins he said well that depends it's it's
[1:54:52] it depends on whichever one I feed the
[1:54:54] most so whichever one I give the most
[1:54:56] attention to that's the one that's going
[1:54:58] to have control of my life
[1:55:00] so which one whichever one I opened
[1:55:03] myself up to whichever one I let the the
[1:55:06] gate down to whether it's the the prayer
[1:55:08] opening channel of a gate then the white
[1:55:12] dog wins but if I close that gate of a
[1:55:15] prayer channel reading and just talking
[1:55:18] with the Lord and just completely
[1:55:21] disregard his word that way is death
[1:55:23] right for the wages of sin is death
[1:55:25] so it's unbelief when you follow that
[1:55:27] black dog you're allowing unbelief to
[1:55:29] come into your life so we want to feed
[1:55:32] on the word right a true son and
[1:55:34] daughter of God is going to feed on the
[1:55:36] word
[1:55:36] the Holy Ghost inside of you can't feed
[1:55:38] on anything else but the Word of God
[1:55:43] yeah that's we'll go ahead and close
[1:55:46] with the sustaining your feet I'm just
[1:55:51] gonna read this 2nd Corinthians 2 at
[1:55:55] verse 14 it says now thanks be unto God
[1:55:59] which always causeth us to triumph in
[1:56:02] Christ oh my now thanks be unto God
[1:56:06] which always causeth us to triumph in
[1:56:09] our own way in our own words through
[1:56:14] Christ and maketh manifest the savour of
[1:56:17] his knowledge by us in every place
[1:56:22] brother Branham says this it says God
[1:56:25] has given God has give you your healing
[1:56:28] but you'll fight every inch of it I
[1:56:30] think he was talking to a sister he says
[1:56:33] God has given given you your healing but
[1:56:35] you'll fight for every inch of it
[1:56:37] everywhere the soles of your feet sets
[1:56:39] that I give you for possession
[1:56:42] he says foot prints means possession
[1:56:44] it's all yours every promise belongs to
[1:56:47] you but you'll fight for every every
[1:56:50] inch of the way in now foot prints as
[1:56:52] possession these are your print these
[1:56:54] are God's promises these are for you to
[1:56:56] have in the home forevermore amen amen
