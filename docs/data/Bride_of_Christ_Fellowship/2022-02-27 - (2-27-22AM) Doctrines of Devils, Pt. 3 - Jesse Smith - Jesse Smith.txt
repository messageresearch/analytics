TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and uh and they they slowly get they get your good graces you know they get your uh they get your relationship and then they introduce a false doctrine but the bible says they are ungodly men and they turned the grace of our god into lashiviousness or lawlessness and so we saw that that was the fifth doctrine we looked at that's the one we finished with on wednesday night i just want to say briefly that again as we as we've been uh discussing we're all on the highway to holiness we're on the way of holiness we'd say and our goal is to stay right in the middle of that road but if we're all honest we're all going to battle we're all going to fall short of god's glory and we'll just get off a little bit of the middle that's what we're praying and hoping and we just get off a little bit and then god brings us right back because paul said press toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus and we were looking at even last week how different doctrines take people further than the middle than we would want to go that's why we stay away from some of those doctrines right like discrimination in churches and it's different manifestations uh and we'll look at a couple more than today here by god's grace but this is one of them you know uh once saved always saved that was the the five ones we looked at i'm going to almost slow a little slower going here because i'm trying to just review here but the promise that we have is if we have the baptism of the holy ghost it will guide us into all truth amen that's the promise that we have and then jesus said in john 14 23 the holy ghost will teach you all things and so we have to look at that if just let's apply that to joshua's day okay now we know they didn't have the full soul holy ghost baptism but joshua fulfilled all the word of god for his day but not everybody in his not everybody in his church not everybody in the message of that day did right there was numerous tribes that didn't drive out all the inhabitants praise god so that's what we'll find the same today there's people that are going to fulfill all the commands for their day right they're going to be obedient to the the commands of god for their day like we would say martin luther john wesley william branham amen we believe all those people we believe all these people fulfilled the will of god for their day but then time moved on and then god has something more to reveal to each generation praise god so for our day we see the mysteries of god were finished right revelation 10 7 fulfilled malachi 4 5 and 6 luke 17 30. but as time goes on the holy spirit gives us more revelation praise god so we're able to understand things better like just one example was the 1977 prediction we talked about right we can see now that brother brown was making a human prediction i'm sorry i don't have it plugged in yet because i was waiting for it to uh to update here okay so sorry about that so brother brown died and went to the grave thinking that uh total annihilation would happen by 77. well the years came and gone he never said it was from the lord he he even said i don't even know why i said it and then we found he was doing just some number calculations and he thought these three things kind of line up so i believe it'll be that he said but i don't say the lord told me that so he was just being a student of the word right but see as time goes on then you can see okay well uh time has made it given us a better understanding right time has given us a better understanding and we have to take everything brother brahm said back to the bible praise god and so as time goes on brother man's sons rise up right and we have to take everything they say back to the bible any preacher rises up any preacher anything any preacher says we've got to take it back to the bible because god is god is bringing the bride of christ into all truth where they live the full word of god amen but we know evil men and seducers are gonna trickle in and the bible says they creep in like we'd say cockroaches or something like that you know and that's being gentle that's being that's being very kind it is because the bible said they're ordained to condemnation but they look so nice they look they smile so good or they're they're dressed so handsome and as we said numer or many times they're behind the pulpit too and that's why we've got to be extremely careful uh to rightly divide the word of truth and so we saw that how brother brahms said brother brahm even said i can't prove that my name is is on the book of the of the lamb's book of life he said that in questions and answers on the seals they said brother mam can you prove you're there no i cannot prove it god could use me as a tool for something but i believe by faith i'm saved not by knowledge by faith that's the way he says we're all saved and so we see this idea here where uh where the enemy tries to come in and he tries to inject just something off the word and for each one that he does that there's a reason he's doing it he's trying to get people to accept an unclean spirit so let me show that list again here of some unclean spirits and i'm going to try to hook up now so we can show this here i just mentioned this on sunday briefly i'm sorry wednesday briefly okay so just give me a moment here there's i've been studying on the the evil spirits and also the numerous attributes of the holy spirit so paul said or jude said evil men are going to come in and they're going to try to rob you remember paul said that he said they're going to try to destroy you who is it it's going to be men behind the pulpit are going to come in and try to destroy now we can look over the years and we can see many preachers who've destroyed people's lives claiming to believe this message or you could just say in any christian church right you see him in every place like i was telling faith that yesterday i said just because we follow you know the message of of william branham and people do too that doesn't mean they're automatically saved like you a lot of people can recognize jesus was a prophet but then fall away from what like judas did right so we were thankful that the message has come and god did send us a prophet but now it's our responsibility to be so filled with the holy spirit that we can fulfill all the promises of god for our day praise god but these are all bible definitions of evil spirits right divination and familiar spirit which is invoking the dead and and then uh you know divination with susan making false prophecies right trying to predict the future uh jealousy is a demon lying is a demon there's a lot of that uh pervert now verse i don't have a we're gonna focus today on the spirit of whoredoms we're gonna look to that one here uh because i believe that's the most prevalent one because it's a spirit of idolatry and you you'll be you'll start saying oh yeah i remember that i remember reading that now once i get to that you'll say oh yeah yeah okay if you've read the church age book or listen to the the series on the church ages from 1960. now another major one this is my opinion among message people this is the major one for those who are sincere and even holy ghost filled the major one we have to battle is pride so i believe i'm holy ghost filled so what evil spirit do i battle the most probably pride if you're honest with yourself you might say amen too or or maybe maybe pride is not the season you're not battling that one because remember satan comes back for a season jesus defeat him but he's going to come back again or maybe your season is lust of the eyes you know you see that money out there you see the houses and you see that ma or you see uh immorally dressed women or whatever you're for women you know sexy men or you know it doesn't matter or lust of the flesh maybe it's uh overeating you know maybe it's uh nice clothes oh i feel good if i had that nice new jacket and nice new suit or that nice new dress and you already got nice ones you know so you know we go through seasons and even and holy ghostville people will battle these in seasons of their lives praise god that doesn't mean they're lost it doesn't mean they lost the seal you can't lose the seal it's sealed until the day of redemption amen but what will happen a place in your mind as we show those uh those video or those those images a place in your mind will get anointed with the wrong spirit that doesn't mean you're devil possessed it just means you've accepted the wrong idea and but it will impact you the bible says when you when we do that it grieves the holy spirit it offends the holy spirit okay so i believe pride will be the one that we battle the most uh now which one i think is battling the message people the most idolatry because they're worshiping brother branham yeah but church don't feel bad they worship paul too this ain't something new they worship john the baptist they said are you the christ we haven't seen a man preached like this and thousands of being baptized in the jordan river are you the christ he said i'm not the christ amen he said i'm only baptizing with water but there's one coming after me he'll baptize with the holy ghost amen but they wonder they wanted john they wanted john to be the christ paul said i'm glad i baptized none of you in corinth because you'd probably say i baptized using my name he said you need to be baptized in the name of the one that was crucified jesus christ amen and what's the catholic church do today they blasphemed the name of god and they baptized with titles father son holy ghost instead of catching the revelation that jesus said there's one name to the father son holy ghost as peter said on the day of pentecost be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the holy ghost amen now we can battle that too but i'm just saying that's the major one i think that demon is creeping in i know johnny and sarah see it too right no matter what church you go to right you see it creeping into people where they uh they put brother random up as a pedestal or they can idolize their pastor don't idolize me because i got a lot of failures i'm really i'm really going to disappoint you i'm just much a man as anybody you idolize anybody eventually you're going to be discouraged because they're going to fall short of god's glory now heaviness this is another one too depression in a like brother man says in the church book when we have all these gadgets when we have all these machines and yet we're depressed and discouraged you know we they save us so much time yet we feel like we've got no time how many feel like you've got no time don't you don't have to raise your hands i mean all these things that save us time and then we go like we have no time so what's the revelation you in other words you got to enjoy god while you're doing the dishes or worship god while you're spending time with a family or worship god on the drive to church you just have to learn to find god's presence in everything you do praise god because everybody always has the same amount of time we all have the same amount of time but it's keeping the attitude of thankfulness amen keeping the attitude of worship amen in in all in other words recognizing god's presence in every era of our lives amen like for me you know for me i have to get up early that's but not everybody can do that especially moms you know it's hard to get up early when the baby's crying and he's the nurse or needs a diaper change you know so that's what i'm saying we have to for each of us we have to find where we can spend the time with the lord and god will give us victory to lead us out of our depression or leave us out of our nervousness the anxieties of life spending time with the holy spirit and then in god's presence is fullness of joy amen hallelujah thank god amen now we'll get to idolatry a little bit that's what i think strikes the message people the most that are off the word those that are on the word i think pride is the one that strikes them now infirmity is like a sickness so cancer would be infirmity right uh tuberculosis would be an infirmity anything that weakens your body that torments your body deaf and dumb of course uh can't talk and can't listen that's a demon a deaf and dumb demon a spirit of fear that's when we battle as well especially with the war right uh the media loves to push that out war war war what about them dropping a bomb on us you know what about that what about the seventh vision you know see if we don't if we don't uh deal with these situations if we don't take them to god in prayer we can eat we can easily get a spirit of fear but the bible says perfect love cast out all fear praise god and the only fear we need to have is fear of god amen hallelujah that's a healthy fear praise god then there's a seducing spirit which means a deceiving spirit remember that this age is the most deceiving age so that spirit is truly working there all these demons are working but that one is truly working this day because the bible said evil men and seducers will get worse and worse right this isn't the darkest day this isn't the uh the it's not the darkest day that was the dark ages was the darkest day where hardly anybody had a bible i mean they hardly had any access to anything they so limited the word of god but we got bibles amen we got bibles on our phones we got bibles in our houses amen we can just speak to our phone and say read me the bible and it'll read the bible man i mean look at we have so much there praise god but at the same time we've got demons trying to push in praise god and so we need the holy spirit to raise up a standard amen raise up a protection praise god raise up a battle cry against these evil spirits that come in amen hallelujah in other words you've got to have zeal you you and i have to have zeal to fight for for holiness we have to we have to recognize i'm in a battle here now you may have a period of rest but i'm saying after you come out of that now you got a period of battle praise god we might have that season of rest praise god i don't feel the enemies all but pretty soon those devils are going to come back to you praise god and you got to overcome amen it's another test it's another opportunity god is saying that you can overcome god is showing the devil that they won't deny my faith they won't deny the word of god they will be faithful amen and it's going to make you stronger amen and in every temptation god makes a way of escape hallelujah amen the seducing is worse than ever before according to paul according to the holy bible spirit of air is anything that's off the truth and then we looked at this yesterday the bible said yesterday israel has the spirit of blindness or slumber because of their unbelief so yes god give god god god did give them over to a spirit of slumber because they would not believe in jesus christ that's what the bible says now i think now i have question marks on these some of these spirits may be unclean like an unclean spirit or foul spirit that might be all spirits right because they're all unclean all spirits would be bondage right because they they they take people into bondage to lie they then they're addicted to lying or they're addicted to jealousy right or they're addicted to depression can you imagine that people like some people like being depressed right they like feeling depressed just like people like committing adultery and fornication same thing they like feeling down right they've learned to love and worship that spirit instead of loving the holy spirit praise god see it's such a thing we have to make sure like jesus said the greatest commandment is to love god with all your heart soul mind and strength amen we must love the joy of the lord we must love the victory of the lord we must love thanksgiving of the lord amen we must love the judgment of the lord we must love the mercy of the lord we must love being a real holy ghost christian and manifesting god's nature to our families amen and our church we must love that more than we love being depressed right because you know why some people like being depressed because they get more attention oh you look down you poor little baby how can i help you they they feed off that attention and they never really get victory right and and really that devil's trying to get you to be depressed for them too rather than recognize it's to bring them up it's to bring up you know they're they're depressed there to be able to say for us to be able to say you know you can overcome that depression let me encourage you let me give you a word of encouragement or let me say like this david encouraged himself in the lord so why don't you go encourage yourself in the lord and that was under the blood of bulls and goats amen that wasn't even under the blood of jesus christ praise god in other words all of us have a free more agency decision we can either continue in sin or we can choose to escape it hallelujah because it's a snare it's a trap satan is set up and we've got to recognize this is a trap and i'm not going to get my foot caught in this mouse trap right as like a mouse i'm not going to get caught in this trap i'm not going to get caught on this i'm not i'm going to overcome this i'm going to sidestep this and i'm going to keep moving forward on the gospel way amen i'm going to keep walking forward on the narrow way i'm not going to get trapped here where i can't move on with god we want to move on we want to grow closer to god we want to be ready for his appearing and we don't want any weights of sin we want to run the race with revelation amen with strength hallelujah we want to run the race the bible says with no hindrances amen and i would think all spirits are antichrist because it means it means an adversary of christ and that means an opponent all evil spirits are opponents of the holy spirit right and all spirits are worldly so there is some overlap here church and then i show this to the church as well and then i went read the bible because i got this thought from a book i was showing you that book a while back about evil spirits then the holy spirit though gives you all these anointings to combat and overcome the devils so if you need wisdom say jesus anoint me with a spirit of wisdom amen that's all you got to say cry out for that like cry out to your father ask your that's what we ended wednesday too ask your father if you ask if if a child asks a father for a fish he's not gonna give him a scorpion he's gonna give him a fish praise god if you ask for the holy ghost if you ask for some of these leadings god is gonna give it to you just wait on the lord amen and ask with the right motive and objective see wisdom god will give it to you need understanding god will give it to you these are all holy spirit anointings judgment right to judge right from wrong uh discernment as well burning that's the burning like the bible said our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way that's the burning fire of conviction hallelujah we need that jesus said o fools slow of heart to believe all the things the prophets have said in luke 24. he said did not our hearts burn within us as he was rebuking us along the way see when god rebukes you there should be a burning in your heart to show you i love you but you're wrong and you need to be corrected you need to accept the truth hallelujah you need to get rid of the spirit of air or the spirit of of seducing and accept the spirit of truth hallelujah amen sometimes church this is like i said if bride members are going to battle the pride if wise virgins are going to battle the pride then many times we need a spirit of humility a spirit of meekness help me to be more meek lord now we can all use this when we get discouraged lord give me a garment of praise help me when i go to church not to be depressed help me to praise the lord amen help me to put on my praise and thanksgiving and all my shouts to god and all my worship to god help me to have joy in my life amen help me to be a thankful for all that you've done amen lord give me a spirit of grace and supplications the bible says supplication is prayer for individuals that's what we're doing today with the prayer clause we're praying for supplication we're asking god for these special needs that god will minister to them the spirit of truth is the holy spirit the holy spirit is power amen we need a miracle right power also power in your daily life to overcome the spirit of love we're lacking love lord anoint me with love spirit of a sound mind my mind is going crazy lord anoint my mind amen to think the right thing a spirit of holiness the bible says i need i need to live a separated life holiness means separated or consecrated that means set aside when you're holy you're set aside for god's service you're not in the service of the world or enjoying the lust of the world you are set aside and god can use you as he wants to use you a spirit of life the bible says so death opposite death life jesus said my words are spirit and they are life amen the spirit of adoption that's relationship so church god is when you when you're born again you have the spirit of adoption god is your father and as we said if you need something from dad just ask dad praise god i used to beg my dad all the time hey can we go buy some baseball cards and my dad almost every time even though we were poor he would do it he said okay how about saturday jesse all right okay yeah i'm gonna buy this uh these baseball cards football cards i mean every time i ask my dad for something almost every time you give it to me and i'm the same way with my kids they want to go out and get some uh panera or they're gonna go out get some chipotle okay i'll get it for you okay just be patient you know with some fruit strips i'll get you some fruit strips just be patient you know as a if i love my children i'm going to give them what's best now the difference is god knows the beginning from the end and i don't praise god that's the difference but i'm just making the point that god loves you and god wants to give you all these spirit the bible says we have all spiritual blessings in christ jesus amen god doesn't want us to become slaves to sin or god doesn't want us to have uh god doesn't want to have complexes for long periods of time when we could be overcoming now we're going to have to have them at times to learn okay and to understand how to fight and how to become a better christian but god wants us to choose the right praise god the bible says perfect holiness in the fear of god so god desires for a perfect walk that's what he told abraham he said you're he said you're 90 years old or 90 years and i believe 90 if i'm not mistaken he said i am the almighty god walk before me be thou perfect amen hallelujah god told him be thou perfect in other words be a complete believer believe all the word amen lay aside the things that are easily besetting you and obey me and follow me and obey the truth of god's word but church even abraham backs it i was listening brother brown this week the demonology the religious sermon do you know when uh abraham when he lied to abimelech about sarah brother brahm said he was a backslidden lying little shyster now that's pretty harsh words he lied to abimelech that's what brother man said he was but abraham the prophet he was a backslidden prophet but now look at this abimelech though was a heathen king right a philistine king but he still prayed to god and somehow he had a contact with god but abraham was the prophet of the day now over all church i want you to catch us abimelech was not a more holy man than abraham abraham was a more holy man but when abraham came there and lied at that moment he was baxter and he was in a worse spiritual condition than abimelech because abimelech said god you know the integrity of my heart i would never take another man's wife but what about the integrity of abraham's heart he just lied to save his own skin he said take my wife don't take me because he knew that he'd probably kill abraham right so he's a lying brother abraham said another place he was a coward a church if we're honest sometimes we're afraid to witness so see i'm not we're not bashing abraham but we're just relating to abraham because we're children of abraham amen hallelujah by faith in christ we are children of abraham but the point was overall abraham was a the real prophet of god for that day but god he found abimelech and he came there in a backseating condition but what did god say he said don't touch sarah he said because that man is my prophet amen hallelujah but he just found him in a backseating condition now why didn't god hide abraham's sin to abimelech because every man falls short of the glory of god and god didn't want abimelech worshiping abraham and the church said but god said listen it bleh i know you didn't want to sin against me that's why i kept you from sinning against me but i said this baroness is going to stay in your house until you pray for until my prophet prays for you amen my goodness so see it proved abraham was the real spiritual man of that day but he was caught in a backseating condition a season of weakness but god still used it praise god god used it to eventually hallelujah bring out a seed a seed word son isaac amen god eventually brought the promised son amen so despite our faults despite our affairs despite our little backsidings in our mind despite all these things the promised son will be revealed and you and i man hallelujah i'm talking about the baptism of the holy ghost i'm talking about the rapture praise god that's what we know whether we live or die god will fulfill his word if we're the seed of abraham just hang on to god's word confess your faults and move on with god amen hallelujah adoption god's my father so when i need something i go to the lord now as a wise daddy he's not going to give you everything he asked for right but he's going to give you what's essential for you what do you need at that moment also he's going to anoint you with a spirit of faith he's anoint you with the spirit of promise the bible says he's going to anoint you with the spirit of revelation brother ram says to pray for this one more than all the others and that's the prophet's recommendation that wasn't thus saith the lord but that was his recommendation pray for the revelation of god's perfect will more than anything that's a wise that's wise counsel and then there's a spirit of prophecy that comes along right it anoints people and foretells the future praise god and then there's what the bible calls a fervent spirit which is a a diligent spirit a devoted spirit right a working spirit right and you're anointed with that lord give me more fervency in my family give me more fervency for my my prayer life amen give me more fervency for listening to more tapes and give me more fervency for saying amen and for reading my bible and witnessing and praying for people give me more fervency amen see these all come from the lord amen these are all anointings of god now as i said i want to get to that uh one i got a whole lot i could preach here but yeah let me just do this one here just gonna try to follow the leadership of the holy spirit today now as i said the evil spirit of whoredoms or idolatry is one uh that's very prevalent and that's because as i've been studying the scripture the evil spirit of whoredom causes men to break the first commandment right so you have the ten commandments jesus jesus quotes them in the new testament as well they're part of the moral law of god we're not under the law but the bible says we fulfill the righteousness of the law in other words the holy commandments from the old testament many of them the moral law god carries over to the new testament amen that's what if you don't know that one read romans 8. i know i got spies listening and things like that read romans 8. we fulfill the righteousness of the law because the law is holy now some of the laws of course the priesthood that was all done away in christ right we know that we have a new priesthood now not the aaronic priesthood we have the melchizedek priesthood now but the first command was no other gods before me nor there no graven image or likeness of anything that's in heaven or earth or under the water but yet remember the same guy that said this said go build two cherubims in other words he's saying don't build something to bow down and worship to it but you build things if you need them if they're going to help you build them right like the cherubim help them recognize this is what god's this is what god's throne looks like in heaven okay now he says showing mercy unto them that are that love me and keep my commandments so the first commandment deals with love have no other gods because god says i want your love i'm worthy of your love praise god now this is why jesus taught loving god with your entire being is the greatest commandment there's nothing greater than making sure every day i'm going to choose to love god's word i'm going to choose to love god i'm going to give all my strength mind body soul you'll never be wrong when you start your day like that i want to direct my love to heaven amen i would direct my love to jesus christ hallelujah that's why i put on that video don't go to your phone first because that could redirect your love away from god i had somebody uh text me last week and said thank you for making that video i was going to my phone the first thing and that video showed me go to the bible first right or go to the go to prayer first because if not it'll take your love and then you might you know you might love something else more you might love sports you might love politics more you know you might be deceived into something and you start loving that more than you love god right so he said which is the first commandment of all jesus is this hear o israel the lord our god is one lord thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart thy soul thy mind and thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like name of this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there's none other commandment greater than these and the church said so love the first commandment is about love i've got to love god first this is why jesus said loving darkness more than light makes someone condemned and go to hell see so that means you can love god a little bit but if you love sin more then you're not saved because that's what jesus said this is right after john 3 16 for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and this is the condemnation this is the judgment that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deed should be reproved see that's that burning right there there's that burning amen see the spirit of burning the holy spirit burns in your spirit and it's letting you know it convicts you you're guilty you're wrong stop loving that and it's trying to burn out that desire amen hallelujah is trying to get you to crucify that desire and obey the desire of god and to desire the things god wants you to desire there it is but he that doeth truth comes to the light comes to the word that his deeds may be manifest that they are wrought in god remember the book of acts when all those uh those shoe sayers remember when they got saved the bible said they brought their books of witchcraft and they brought them out in the street and burned them that's exactly what jesus loves amen hallelujah bring all the take them out of my life i just want my works to glorify you i want to love you i want my whole life to magnify you i'm coming to the light take me out of darkness amen hallelujah this is right after john 3 16. once saved always saved that's not true what about john 3 16 well what about john 3 19 through 21 what about that see don't think about that they keep moving on with the lord see they know god to a point they know god to john 3 16 but they fail to go on to the next step it's a long road to the promised land church hallelujah you don't get there with one step you don't get there with one scripture amen you got to keep moving on amen keep progressing keep traveling footsteps is possession possess the land amen that god has given you now here's what i want to start breaking this thought here what is really idolatry idolatry really is spiritual fornication or another word would be a spiritual union because what is natural fornication it's a union of a sexual union before marriage so it's unlawful union so idolatry is a spiritual form of that it's uniting with something else loving it's loving something else being empty yeah it is there it is being intimate with something else other than the holy spirit all right so we're learning today balaam got israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion and that just struck me that's why all these denominations allow people to divorce remarry divorce remarry divorce remarry they allow the natural adultery and natural fornication because they're spiritual fornicators right that's why they take a denomination say this is only god can only move in a lutheran way god can only move in a wesley way right or like today god can only move in a tapeway i'm careful saying that but see people they'll worship the tapes see what i mean by that is like 1977 or joseph is a prophet that's what i mean not every word on the tape is thus saith the lord she's a little worship everything i believe has to be on the tapes well then you need to move to jeffersonville and worship that man you know that's what you need to do but you're not going to do that if you're a real believer praise god because you have the holy spirit today to guide you into all truth praise god amen lord said if you have the holy ghost it can only point you to the scripture praise god amen hallelujah if you have the holy ghost it'll only point to the word of god the word of god says this the word of god says that yes we're thankful for the tapes but we have to take them back to the word of god see it's organized religion the spirit of fornication the spirit of whoredoms so now we know an organization is it's a spirit of whoredom it's a it's a spiritual from a left christ right and it goes to goes to evil spirits i said that the spirit of fornication is spirit of organization and all fornicators will have their place in the lake of fire and that is what god thinks of organization yes sir the and her daughters will be in the lake of fire so the catholic church system and all the other systems those spirits behind that they'll all be in the lake of fire yes another church age book quote they're partaking in the well-known babylonian satanic religion have joined themselves to idols and committed spiritual fornication which means death so any idol becomes uh a connection or a false union having any idol in our lives is a false union and that's spiritual fornication and so there's pronounce a curse against idolatry right and we know that we preached on curses a couple years ago now it might be a couple years ago right any sin brings some type of temporary effect on it right and the bible calls it a curse okay here's that prophet is called jezebel and she is teaching the people a woman teaching the people the spirit of jezebel and her teaching is seducing the servants of god and what did her teaching lead to committing fornication now fornication means idol worship that's what jezebel did in the natural right that's what the catholic church does in the natural today too right that's like we just said almost every denomination allows fornication and adultery but it's really spiritual fornication behind that in other words they love they love sin otherwise they love sin that they worship that sin and that becomes the spirit of whoredom on them that's what a spirit that's what it's spiritual meaning is it's an illegal union ahab's union and constantine's union were both illegal both committed spiritual fornication every fornicator will end up in the lake of fire god said so see if they don't repent before they die say god forgive me of sleeping around god forgive me of adultery god forgive me of this if they don't do that they'll burn in the lake of fire because they love darkness more than they love life but thank god for the light amen thank god that we can see where we are thank god we're not children of darkness but our eyes are open and the coming of the lord will not take us as a thief in the night amen our eyes are wide open hallelujah we see the spirits working in the churches we see the spirits working around the world we see these spirits so i'm just trying to simplify this church so fornication is an illegal union of love naturally so fornication is loving and idle right loving idolatry so in fornication uh if a man and woman committed then that uh they're worshiping right uh that man let's just use the man that man is worshiping that woman right because instead of honoring god loving god he's loving that woman more illegal union but this is the same thing a spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization as well and organization equals fornication or love for an idol or a false god system so it's a false god so i i don't know if that helps or not i sure hope that i was just saying lord help me to be able to make it so clear that a spirit a spirit of fornication right naturally that's that's all that's happening with churches and denominations they're just loving creeds they're loving sin and worshiping that that becomes an idol to them and then when you ask them are you a christian i'm a methodist i'm a catholic see that shows the union they've had they've not had a union with christ they've had a union with a denominational they've had a union with a spirit but thank god when we say when they ask are we christians i'm a holy ghost-filled christian amen hallelujah i've had a union with christ amen christ is my husband the bible says in romans chapter seven amen it's jesus christ now here's this quote brother brahm says i'm just now bringing down to our day because we all have idols in our lives at times right at some point right we'll all make an idol and ahab had knuckled down into his his idolater wife and brought it brought all israel into idolatry and you'd say well then brother brandon you compare it to today to our nation yes sir our nation oh it's greatly covered over with idolatry we might not worship wooden animals and so forth as we want to think of idolatry but that's not all idolatry consists of we sometimes make our automobiles and our clothes just something simple think of that clothes i can you can love you can get up for church now i know we saw this maybe in other churches right we might have been raised in other churches where it's all about how you dress when you come to church that's idolatry if you're more concerned about how you look then how your relationship is with god you have a spirit of idolatry church that's why i care sometimes i come to church and i'm like man i have all this i have all these stain marks do the people see my stain marks on my all my suits but i'm like i don't even care that's not the point why i'm coming now should i be more cleansy yes i should probably get them taken to the dry cleaner more often but i just forget about it i'm trying to do everything i can so to me that proves i don't care really about the so much the clothes i mean yeah we got to dress holy that's part of it but what matters is where's your love directed to amen your love must be directed to your maker amen hallelujah not to the close not not to anything else not to the automobile anything between you and god is an idol sometimes we make our churches idols right there's a famous church i used to go to before i came in the message and that's their slogan their slogan is we love our church that's their slogan that's simple that may sound simple but that's that's an idol they call and this is the this is our church and this is the church we love well i mean i'd say yeah i love our church too but if sin gets in here i won't be real happy with our church right you know what i mean because our church is not infallible there's only one that deserves our worship there's only one that deserves our adoration amen see so people can worship their church we should never ever say never never do that god is the only one we should worship hallelujah we might not oh yeah i just put this down at the bottom so see money be obviously that's the idea for many people jesus actually brought it down to that either serve god or ma'am and mammon means riches so most people in this society most people all throughout history either choose to worship god or money paul said remember preachers worship their bellies so they preach whatever will get them more money and more uh more more more people coming to church and more ties more offerings right they just want to preach that because their god is their belly spouse or immoral lover preacher can be an idol job fame anything else anything that takes the place of god or gets more love than god has now become an idol he says i just want to read this here the spirit will have to be the same kind of holy spirit or it'll miss that place going together amen not because you make yourself but because something the love of god has swept into your soul and tore every earthly idol out so i'm just reading this to show you the brother man says the holy spirit has to sweep into your soul like a rushing mighty woman amen it's just in other words god's spirit has to come upon you and it has to tear out all the idols amen like i've named them you know my idols were sports and and lustful thoughts and lustful movies and swearing and i mean you name it a good name i can name probably 10 or 15. if i just thought about it for a moment but when the holy spirit comes in he takes sometimes he takes a couple out at a time amen but usually it's just one at a time the spirit will knock this one away knock that away knock that away the holy spirit is coming in there to get all these things out that you love amen so you only love the one who deserves your love jesus christ amen hallelujah that's what they do on super bowl sunday they might sit like this watching the game but really they're bowing down like this they they love the game and that's what they do when those guys make good scores they bow down and they worship them now you've seen it yeah that's really what they're doing they're buying down to that idol because they're saying i need pleasure from this i need three or four hours and all these commercials i need all this worldliness because i'm hungry for it they're feeding on it it's an illegal union amen when they didn't spend five minutes praying who'd i share that with yeah i shared that with a catholic guy he works at giant eagle i go there almost every morning to get a salad you know or something like that i said uh sir i said uh he said oh what do you think the supervisor said i don't watch it i said i don't want to bow down and worship that he's like oh i need to think about that oh yeah i asked him i said i said i said you know most people watched four hours on that and they didn't read their bible for five minutes he's like yeah i don't know if i prayed five minutes this morning or yesterday when i watched the super bowl i said see there it is people can't see that you can't see that you love that more than you love the things of god oh but when we get doctors when we really get down the bible or really get down to prayer isn't there a peace that passes all understanding isn't there such a satisfaction in knowing that god heard your prayer and god loves you and you're in you're in frequent contact and connection with the holy spirit praise god that's something the world didn't give and the world can't take it away praise god amen but they want to be contact with all the worldly spirits remember church we'd have people leave this this church because of things like that tvs and they'd rather have that they'd rather have nba finals and nfl than then believe god sent a prophet see why because they love that it's a spirit of it's a whoredom they're horrors to god that's a rough word but that's true they're to god and they've never let the holy spirit sweep down their soul and knock all those out down praise god holiday that's what god wants to do today praise god amen there's anything in our lives that are displeasing the lord anything we're going to for pleasure and and enjoyment more than god god wants to knock those out of our lives like just think about church in the 1950s what what did they make that show called we love lucy love there's love and brother man would constantly say you're going instead of going to wednesday night prayer meeting you're going to watch i we love susie he said who we we who love susie see so he's catching it there in the 50s the show's called you're it's about your love we love it watching all the kind of idiotic things in it so idiotic idiotic jokes idiotic disrespect for men and women putting your confidence on prostitutes which they were back you imagine that they're prostitutes and staying home in bram tabernacle they'd stay home from church to watch we love susie we love i love lucy instead of going to church and you make them your idols and when you turn and you turn them on your television and let your little children see them now i just made a video about this a few weeks ago well maybe months ago but here what was she standing for this was in nineteen i'm sorry it's 1953. she was she was the most popular sitcom she's an adulterer i think she's married three or four times and she's the one they use to start pushing women wearing pants she was the one because we love her see they got the idol they made her idol right and then they'll they know women that idolize her will bow down well i'm going to buy me some of those pajama pants i don't look just like my husband and god said it's a abomination for a man to put on a woman's garment a woman's garment to put on a man's garment who do they use they use the woman that's already an idol who she's funny and she mocks her husband and married three four times she's a prostitute a prostitute like i told that guy on the debate nice guy he said you need to read this book i said i got a book for you to read you need to read women and pants from 2003. hallelujah it wasn't written by message believer it's written by sinners amen see they love it and so satan gives them what they want because they love darkness more than light now we read this quote a few weeks ago let me see where i'm at yeah so the main thing he says is stay in the middle of the road enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving on how many feel warm in the holy spirit today i feel real warm today praise god i'm i'm burning up with god's love amen i'm warm i love god amen love worship in jesus amen and it keeps you moving not but you also know enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit so you can't just use well i feel good i got emotions that's good i got that too but i also gotta use my mind and say well the bible says this the bible says this lord help me obey the bible that's how you stay in the middle of the road church hallelujah make sure you got some emotion for god make sure you love god you feel warm in your heart oh god has been so good to me oh i feel alive amen but also now direct that thought to the word now lord here's today i have to do this this this and that lord is there anything i don't want to anything you want to let me know i don't want to disobey you i want to obey you and you be you'll be you you'll be surprised and we i'm sure you are we are surprised when the very thing we read in our bible that morning or the very thing we heard preach that maybe last night is the thing that we need for the next day that's happened so many times with me you know i get emails from all kinds of people like i was studying on something i forget what it was oh amy simple mcpherson i was studying on her because brother man talks about her right a woman preacher who wore makeup and cut her hair and was divorced twice i was just studying on that and then i get uh the very next day i get a message from india saying hey what do you think about that and the holy spirit prepared me with what to say it was a man it's just amazing i was this week you know see in other words you just meditate on the things of god and god will bring you what you need for that hour amen that's why the bible said be instant ins for preacher be instant in season out of season in other words just always give yourself instantly give your give your mind to the things of god because there's somebody that will need something somewhere and we can all be servants to one another in fact the bible says we must serve we should we should serve one another we should be servants one to another praise god and so my you know if you're wondering about amy several mcpherson let me say this but abraham said he went to her her funeral or her burial and he said he just bowed his head and thanked god for a noble life yet she's a woman preacher now the reason i think brother brown did that was because he he was invited to preach at her place many or her church she died in 1944 brother ramsar's ministry in 47th as far as the national one so i think brother brown was just a gentleman right he wasn't going to go into a woman's former church a woman preachers former church and blast all the women and condemn you know amy simon mcpherson to hell he just said she was a noble woman she did some good things but he never said i agree with her preaching right and so i think the holy spirit gave me the right words to say and also brother brown may have not known all the things that she did because he didn't have google in his pocket like you got or go like i got i don't like google in my pocket i like duck duck go in my pocket he couldn't just look up and say oh i wonder what she's doing you know news traveled slow in those times so just as the holy spirit moves now so see church what but brotherhood says you know he said we can't be too emotional we can't be overly emotional and forget about doctrine on this side and we can't be too word word word all the time and not and just get called on god so you got to have both you're going to be right down in the middle of the road you must be balanced and the church said amen jesus said he's looking for true worshipers who worship what here it is in spirit and in truth and the church said middle of the road believers amen hallelujah praise god enough warmth to keep you warm and on fire moving on but enough wisdom to know the word to obey the word of god and not get tricked by a doctrine of a devil hallelujah but the brother man said the antichrist will turn down the bride's doctrine that makes sense because uh antichrist is opponent of course the false church the antichrist church will turn down the doctrine because the doctrine of christ leads to holiness amen and she don't want to be holy she wants to look holy but the bible said i have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof and then also here's what i would say the wise version tries to stay in the balance the foolish virgin they kind of fall off on the side of the road but at least they're not drowning like make believers and unbelievers at least they're not drowning and lost and shipwrecked the bible says they're shipwrecked so i i don't even believe the foolish virgin are on the highway of holiness you know they've kind of fallen off because they're not born again they're not going to make it to the rapture praise god at the end of that road there's a destination church there's a light at the end of the road amen hallelujah praise god amen it's jesus christ and the bible says he shines in the light of his glory amen hallelujah now we there's numerous doctrine that are off the mark i'm not going to say these over live stream can they see this screen on the live stream all the way like it zoomed in no it's kind of small right so i preached on these a few uh sundays ago these are doctrines that are getting off you know hearing from a theophany i can't find that in the bible um some people take that interaction marriage and so far it becomes legalism and i believe it comes racism right because brother we talked about that here we'll look at this one here today the prosperity movement says god wants you to be rich and always healthy and that's a lie that's a doctrine of a devil now you you say well church well that's not in the message well i beg your pardon sometimes we have preachers and sometimes there's preachers i hear that they are preaching a prosperity gospel or god always wants to heal you well we're going to balance it out today lord willing if we can by god's grace seventh under some people take course you know coleman took it way too far where their the church is all in sin every word on the tape i don't see how those people cannot be drowning in idolatry i don't see how that's possible they weep and cry saying oh our pastor is going to preach to us tonight brother branham brother bam is dead his ministry is over he's passed on he's not preaching he's rejoicing praise god amen he's not preaching today he's rejoicing today praise god he's experiencing the sublime of the sublime amen and preaching ain't always sublime and brother jesse said amen you know because you get battles and you know discouragements but we all get it i'm not making anything it's not my battle's no harder than yours but you know it's just it's not sublime always what's sublime is having a new body no sin paul said to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord amen some people make christmas you know they go too far on that some people say no fasting they go too far on that with music right they say you can't have any drums they go way far off the beaten path so let me um let me go to that one with divine healing i got a few thoughts on divine healing here i want to get to so just bear with me here for a moment so everybody take a deep breath if you can we'll try to look at a few thoughts here um i just want to bring this out again here uh before we get to the divine healing i just want to go i went through this a few weeks ago church this one this is what i was saying a holy ghost-filled sealed believers still can have an evil spirit anointing them it's an offense it's just all it is is grieving the holy spirit it's an offense to god right but i love how god is patient god is patient with us we now here's where satan satan tries to whisper in your ear oh you gotta you got a complex oh you're definitely not the bride you definitely don't have the holy ghost why do you know you weren't there when i got to hold it well you might have been there when i got the holy ghost but i was there when i got the holy ghost that's why i was like say i was there when i got it praise god i know what it did in my life praise god look at the last years of foreign look at the last since i got the holy ghost in 2003. look at the last uh let's see 2003 19 years of my life look at that last night does my life speak foolish virgin or does my life speak wise virgin amen hallelujah i know what i believe amen i know what my life speaks am i flirting with the world or am i or am i dedicated or am i making preparations amen for the coming messiah amen what is my life doing am i lacking oil and i'm going to be found without oil i didn't make preparations or am i in the church of god praying every time preaching singing worshiping god am i making preparations or not the bride has made herself ready amen hallelujah so devil say whatever you want i know what my life speaks and my life speaks louder than my words hallelujah because you can say the same thing and the church said but just notice in 1954 brother man said before this is before he preaches he said i've developed the critical i who developed it i did i did when you sin church most of the time you know that you're sinning brother graham said i sin a thousands of times a year that's at least five or six times a day do you think five or six times a day when we sin do you think we didn't know what we were doing or do you think we knew what we're doing i think most time we know what we're doing and what is this complex this is a complex now how does it feel brother ram it haunts me i told my wife yesterday the first time something happened now i was sitting in the yard i told her she had reminded me and i told her about it i said honey i've got to place till i become critical of people i don't want to be whose job is it it's not mine [Laughter] praise god and god's the one to criticize not me not church there's a balance especially for preachers it is my job to rebuke sin but brother ram recognized in his life he'd be and the example he gives he criticizes a woman preacher in india he criticizes the voice of healing magazine he said everything he saw he just criticized that's how you know he got a critical spirit criticized the preacher criticized the trustees criticized the song leader criticized the sisters criticized the mothers criticized everything everything's critical there's no like praise god i love you god bless you i sure appreciate what you're doing for the lord it's just critical critical cutting cutting cutting cutting mistake mistake mistake error i'm skipping he says so you help me as i stand here with my hand up at the pulpit help me to criticize nobody and help help me ask them to pray for him that god will give me a spirit in my heart that instead of criticizing it i will love them anyhow and go on so brother i'm saying i really can't go on with god because i'm just staying here in this spot criticizing everything i want to just love them i just want to move on past this in my life have you ever felt like that like you're not moving on with god because you're so overwhelmed with something many times what is a church it's an evil spirit i love this next quote it's just been a constant grind and a grind and a grind till i'm just human my mental powers are breaking like that you see and i've got to get away for some rest so church when did brother adam get this complex when he was tired that church doesn't happen to all of us brothers and sisters we work work work if we don't take time to rest satan's going to slip something before our eyes and we might take up the critical spirit and then that will haunt us until we repent of it and ask god to bring us back with god that's why it's good to build into your life some type of vacation now where you really rest i'm not talking about where you go vacation to be busy hallelujah you have to build rest into your life because look he gets tired he's grinding grinding yeah i used to run a grinder you know when i was in college i think bang you run grinders brother okay so van runs yeah he knows all about grinders gotta make sure it's the right one just grinding all the time and never letting up just so busy so over overworked over anxious oh stressed out and that's when the devil brings in a critical spirit and he said i'm coming to the pulpit and i'm haunted by this i just everything i look at i want to criticize how many believe you're still with the holy ghost and that's what i'm going to wait for to stay by myself to pray that god will take that critical feeling away from me and mellow me down i could go on and i could go and act like it but that wouldn't come from my heart and i'd be a hypocrite then sure enough see i want it to come from my heart now i love this look that i really have love for those who are not lovely now look at this that jesus did when i was critical look at this now look what he says i was critical when i needed to be criticized and still he loves me anyhow praise god amen in other words i'm the one that needs criticized and god is patient with me god still loves me amen that's divine love amen we're critical we need the criticism but god loves us anyway he's merciful with us he's patient with us hallelujah and he says you pray for me now here now let me give this thought i thought we have the power of the spoken word why didn't he just speak to the critical spirit and it goes see see how people just throw these quotes around they don't even understand like we had somebody years ago when they criticized my wife and criticized me we had some different problems they're like why don't you speak to it and they were being critical of us like every problem in life want you to speak to it because not every situation is like that you got to be anointed to speak to something like we were having some trouble one of the kids was sick why don't you just speak to that why did you speak to that now the very same person i could have now i didn't brother bang but i could have said why don't you speak to that youtube devil that you're addicted to i could have said that but you know god gave me a little more wisdom than that i should say a little more patience than that why don't you uh repent of that overeating devil that you got worship in your belly you're overweight why don't you speak to that so you can go down and eat the restaurant and not overeat why don't you don't you speak to that you see it's hypocrisy it's see it's a critical spirit and we gotta we gotta overcome that with god's divine love in other words god is going to send you the word to speak at the right time i want you to speak to it but why don't you why don't you why don't you get the beam out of your eye first right and then come talk to me about the beam in my eye because sometimes god allows trials and their tests and god doesn't tell us how long they're going to last and the church said job was months in trials why don't you speak to a job because god don't anoint me to speak to it right now amen i've asked god to do it god hasn't done it i want to speak to it but god hasn't sent me the anointing i'm mature enough to know when god wants me to speak to that mountain he'll give me the word we'll speak to that mountain and it'll move amen mature enough to know i don't keep god in my pocket and bring him out whenever i want to god's my aladdin god's my genie that's not how god works god works by his time his season his ways his ways are higher than our ways amen like i said you got a hypocrite telling you to speak to it when they won't even speak to their sins that's a beam in your eye trying to take the beam out of someone else's eye in other words they can't see clearly how they're going to help you see clearly church the only one that can help us is jesus christ i didn't mean to breathe i didn't actually plan to preach that but praise the lord anyhow now let me look at this one this god always wants to heal now i didn't really get these in the order so you can kind of tell i'm just kind of trying to find where i was at here oh yeah here's another one too yeah i just want to bring this quote out too and i got a whole list of scriptures so get your bibles go to first corinthians 12 would you see the prosperity movement you know they're all about health and wealth right that's what they're all about health and wealth and church there are documentaries on tv channels they have gone to these prosperity meetings and found all the people they pray for and hardly any of them get healed yet they're giving thousands of dollars into those ministries and these these preachers are saying give us thousand dollars god's gonna bless you sow this seed and god's gonna bless you and some of them die many of them die see because they're only after their money right but the bible says god gives us a a victory without money or price amen god gives our healing without money or price hallelujah so first corinthians 12. now look at verse 30 12 30. this is we use this all the time when we talk to pentecostal people that say you've got to speak in tongues you've got to speak in tongues well the paul said not all speak with tongues in church honestly if we're honest with ourselves i don't even know if anybody has the gift of tongues in our church at least right now because at least it's not manifest in the church and that's okay it doesn't have to manifest here there's no scripture that says all the gifts have to manifest right in the assembly of the saints there's no scripture that says it and they all have to be operated in the local assembly but they should all be within the assembly right somehow there's no scripture that says you have to operate all of them inside the assembly of the saints but the bible says when you do keep them in order remember gifts are to keep the church clean but look at first corinthians 12 30. let's read that let's all read it ready one two three have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret these prosperity guys say god always wants you healthy god wants you wealthy well i am rich in christ amen i'm looking at spiritual riches here praise god i already am i've got a mansion brother amen over yonder amen hallelujah praise god and if i'm faithful i got a gold crown hallelujah that's not why i serve god but i know it's waiting over there i'm like you're saying i'm richer than all things amen there it is amen when i come in god's presence i'm the richest man in all of akron praise god well all with you we're all the same praise god but see i wouldn't we have to use a scripture not all speak with tongues and if our church doesn't have a lot of tongues well who are we to say how can we get more of it we can't ask we can't force god to give us a gift in other words we have to use what god gives us we have to the bible said gifts and callings of god are without repentance so so is the same is true will all people have all gifts of healing no no but yet they'll say now this trickles over in the message but this is a doctrine of a devil everybody needs to be rich and if you're not rich it's your fault if you're not healthy it's your fault if you're sick see that's what the devil wants you to do it's your fault like god doesn't love you or you're not good enough that's a doctrine of a devil you know the scripture they uses god would that we all prosper in health even as our soul prospers yes god wants us to prosper in health but there's also times when god doesn't heal us how about this quote this is at the end of his ministry september 11th 65. i just come back from the east i kind of run myself down and i look overeating over kindness of the people down in the mountains and i got sick he's sick he's sick right now with the pulpit he was being kind to the churches he visited and he was just eating everything they gave him now when i went i realized right away i'm not gonna eat all that they gave me because i'm gonna get sick actually i knew this quote i said oh no thank you i'm sorry i can't eat that and look he got sick i haven't felt good all week so you pray for me well brother branham why don't you just speak to it now i'm not i'm not going against brother brown but you see all these people take these ideas just speak to it just speak to why didn't he speak to it the third poll was already open hello why don't you just speak to it because i don't control god god controls me amen god is not my servant i'm his servant amen hallelujah why don't you just speak to don't you speak to the storm why don't you speak to the sickness like you did the snowstorm because i gotta wait on god oh no but always god's will to heal you right now every instant healing right now not always now look the brother says you eat too much possum and he said what'd you say too much possum he said oh brother carl williams his sense of humor i think we need it right now he's sick going to preach and he said i think we need a little sense of humor because i'm sick right now i think we need it brother carl williams i want you to speak to the the sickness that'll leave the prophet because it wasn't god's time is he with that or brother iran's being they're being disrespectful to god and they're breaking god's word well which one is it it's not they're being disrespectful it's that god has a time and season for everything in other words god will anoint you when it's your time to be healed how come people are people aren't why why aren't they quoting this one not they use these quotes huh i don't like those oh but yeah i'm i'm the one or we're the ones that are against the message we're the ones not doing what the prophet said no i'm saying what the prophet said i'm taking it back to the word he said i don't know about that brother carl but a whole lot of squirrels i was eating so you want so you want to pray for someone this morning why i certainly appreciate it if it would be some of your prayer for me because i need it why don't you just speak to it brother you got the power of the third pole see how the there the devil comes to you to say he came to jesus and said jump off the cliff come on the bible says speak to the mountain amen there it is amen praise god the same devil says you got to produce a miracle you got it i can't produce nothing it ain't from me it ain't from my thoughts it's from god's thoughts amen hallelujah and that gentleman i met this week i was telling you about we're praying for his wife he actually was in those prosperity movement for 20 some years and he said those men were so full of demons he said that man would take his jacket like this and i'm not well i'm going to go in and call his name benny hen he'd go like that and he said those demon powers would go all the way to the back of the room he said he saw a man who had a big pot belly he said the demon threw his belly in like this and pushed it out and then slammed him to the ground that's how much demon power was at some of those meetings and that guy's caught on tape given on video giving people cocaine and the they uh they got millions of dollars he's a prosperity health and wealth preacher and they have the receipts when he travels over for his big meetings for these poor people supposedly to heal them he'll stay at a hotel for ten thousand dollars for one night at a hotel one night and they're living they're living their best life now well yeah they are because if they don't repent they're going to hell that's right my goodness and this is what this is see it's a doctrine of a devil oh you're not well enough well you need to sow some seed into my ministry then you'll get better they've got to honor your faith that's not faith that's fear give me money or you're going to get healed that's paying for that's that's the filthy looker amen filthy lucre and church that goes over in the message if you're not sick speak to it brother speak to it now it might be god sometimes church it might be like when you're when you're dead right brother bang and sisterhood when your dad was sick now why did we speak to it here's why we spoke to it because that morning the holy spirit woke me up at four o'clock i never wake up at four o'clock and i had three scriptures on my mind the only one i can remember now is there's life and death in the power of the tongue and i couldn't sleep i'm like rolling around my bed like why can't i go to sleep i gotta work today uh so i finally get up i'll just go study and pray okay pretty soon nine o'clock i get a call from brother amen he said really serious uh sister who is dad uh had a stroke last night he said can you pray i'm just cutting it short right i go out there i just take my phone out i don't want to pray run around the kids i just take my phone out i just got to i look at the sunrise i just say brother well let's just pray together and that's and i said brother then the holy spirit amen the holy spirit brought it to me at that moment amen the anointing of christ fell down and it reminded me this morning i woke you up i didn't say that but this morning you woke up there's power of life in the tongue and that's why we got that memorial amen that was yeah there it was right there that's when i got the prayer cloth so in other words the anointing king amen and then i told amen he was my witness i said i speak to the mountain of that heart a heart attack or whatever and i commanded to move in the name of jesus christ and it moved for two weeks but i said he's going to come out of there well praise god did he come out of there well yes he did he did in the name of jesus christ when the anointing came when it was god's time to heal and look he raised all of our faith through that so we know god does all things by his time in his season we must be humble servants and be led by the holy spirit amen hallelujah amen that was jesus christ doing that in other words when the hour of need comes i'll raise up a standard against it amen why don't you just speak to it brother brown because it ain't the time it ain't the hour and brother man has another quote they said are you going to speak our bodies in the rapture he said i don't know he said i don't know about that he said but remember i didn't ask to speak those squirrels to existence god told me to speak it right brother amen did not ask me to speak to that heart condition the holy spirit woke me up i didn't even know it and said speak life i didn't know what i was gonna i had no idea that was gonna happen nobody knew then god used your faith brother to go there and speak that jonah word there amen lying vanities amen see the word comes in this time and season don't let the devil criticize you you criticize the devil amen say you lying devil get behind me blue devil get behind me in the name of jesus christ get behind me i'm a child of god i'm moving on god always keeps his word god is faithful i love god i'm a child of the king i won't worship you i worship christ amen hallelujah see but the devil these men creeping unawares brother you know johnny they're creeping under the rule they creep in and bring these doctrines of devils to bring condemnation upon god's people but god's people will cast them down in jesus name how about paul how about timothy's stomach trouble timothy you got stomach trouble all the time just speak to it timothy is that what he said no he said go drink wine and the church said amen would you speak to the mountain brother speak to it whatever you ask god will give it to you don't we don't we have a scripture for that yes we do but there's wisdom on using those scriptures well i'm going to talk again about the tape church movement so just bear with me the tate church movie just listened to the fourth seal last week and the and the and the pastor says wrote on his blog he writes it right on the block it says you and i have power to speak to the worlds and move them we have that's what the four seal is about the two prophets you know uh at the end of the uh that's the sixth seal right but he talks about how the he talks about how uh the death rider rides into the the rider the spiritual death the fourth rider my goodness forgive me the pale horse rider rides on to the tribulation right and then brother man says those two prophets are there in the tribulation the man talks about how they they close the heavens well that the the pastor from uh jeffersonville says that we have power to close the heavens and whatever we say god will do it now there is some truth to that but we can't say it until god says it see they just make it sound like you can just do whatever you want no you can't do what you want you're a prisoner to christ what about those clothes amen you're a prisoner of jesus christ i'll only say what he tells me praise god there's such a lack of understanding why didn't paul just say speak to the stomach problem because it wasn't god's will for that time remember in john i believe it's john chapter 5 with that the blind man there when jesus the bible said he walked in and there was a there was a multitude of impotent people there and jesus healed one of them one of them that's why brother and son i thought jesus was a god of compassion he is in other words with a multitude of sick people he had a plan to either heal them or maybe some of them were under curses in other words god knew all their situations and that moment god was only going to heal one of them maybe church they were under unbelief right because the bible said because of many mighty works i'm sorry because of unbelief jesus could not do many mighty works now if you would go to second uh corinthians 12 i'm gonna pull i'm gonna try to find this quote real quick there's a good quote i found yesterday on paul help me lord maybe i didn't get it i might not have got it on there okay okay just a minute so second corinthians 12 let's look at paul again for a moment it's not always god's will to heal not always and you're not under condemnation if god doesn't heal you right we're familiar with this verse five corinthians 12 5. let me see if i can pull up that quote real quick that works as faith expressed not that one either thank you for your patience church here i'm looking for the shalom quote 1964. yeah that's it all right i'm not sure how to make that one larger so that's is that okay is that that's okay all right you know normally under most circumstances i try to make it really large for your eyes okay secretary 12 verse 5 of such and one will i glory of myself i will not glory not in my infirmities for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth for but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me or to be or that he heareth of me and look paul's aware he's written he's written bible and he's like god is making it so people don't think more of me than they should right now if god did that in paul's day wouldn't he do that for all days god has to humble these prophets so people don't worship them he did that and every day look at john the baptist god had to humble him god humbles every everybody god almost everybody right verse 7 and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buff at me lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord three times lord is this your will is this your will or heal me heal me heal me each time the lord said no let's finish verse eight that it might depart from me and he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory my infirmities that the power of jesus christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure and infirmities in reproaches and necessities and persecutions and disruptions for christ's sake for when i am weak then i'm strong let me see if i can magnify that okay that's a little better oh it's already at 200 okay well let's try 300 so the saints can see it okay all right yeah good good good thought here i was listening this found this yesterday listened to it this morning like paul said hallelujah he had an infirmity something was bothering him the devil would buff it and blow off their blow and he consulted the lord three times taken away from him and said i don't want this lord take it away from me and then one night the lord spoke to him and said saul paul my grace is efficient he said then i'll glory my infirmity in glory i'll glory in it i know you're the healer i've seen you heal the sick now search how many of us have he's seen god heal the sick or do miracles and that yet god will let you sit sick god will let you sit without money or without without what you need you've seen god do so much and all of a sudden where's god i've seen you paul paul saw a man raised from the dead remember eunicus i cast out devils open the eyes of the blind but i've consulted you and you tell me it's your grace is sufficient then this devil that bothers me is growing pains of your grace then i'll glory in my infirmities why if less i get exalted above the abundance of the revelation see is it always god's will to heal no it's not right i'm talking about instant healing is it always instant healing god's will no now did paul probably get better eventually yeah he probably got better but in this case it was not god's will to heal him now look at this paul had something the other disciples didn't have i love this he saw him after his death burial resurrection and ascension he saw him some of them say well i walk with him well so did everybody on the street now look at that right the disciples said well i walk with him well so could hundreds of thousands of people said he walked with him or maybe not hundreds of maybe thousands but after he was dead buried rose and ascended up and returned back in the form of the pillar fire he talked to paul that was more than any of the rest of them had amen he said except i get exalted and want to build now look at this this is really something he said except i get exalted and i want to build a great big seminary and everything else and great big something other lest i get exalted above the abundance of the revelation god let a messenger of the devil keep me beat down now church could we be humble enough to say maybe something's happened in our lives they seem to be discouraging but maybe it's god keeping us from being prideful now we don't know that paul wanted to build a denomination but look how brother brand brings us to our day god might let a man be sick so he doesn't accomplish something prideful just speak to it brother i did i spoke to jesus right just speak to it paul i did i talked to him i didn't speak to it but i talked to the lord and the lord told me it's for you to be humble see growing pains of god's grace he says he said we could stay he said then when i'm weak i'm strong growing pains of grace amen we can stay on that long time an hour 45 minutes has passed and we're suffering his grace pains i think that's where he stops it right there yeah he permits you on crossroads all right now does that help a little bit by god's grace see a doctrine of the devil would bring it in and say god always wants you rich god always wants you were just more spiritual you'd have more money that's not true right you think of all the examples of poor people they were very spiritual lazarus the man that died and the rich man was sent to hell he would he was very spiritual but yet he was poor very poor see and that creeps in the message well you must be doing something wrong if you're sick no it could be god keeping you from doing something wrong and for that church should we complain about it or should we rejoice in it we should rejoice when god when god says no we should rejoice in that and saying it's accomplishing a purpose in my life praise god you can stop the livestream i want to just say one more thing here by god's grace
