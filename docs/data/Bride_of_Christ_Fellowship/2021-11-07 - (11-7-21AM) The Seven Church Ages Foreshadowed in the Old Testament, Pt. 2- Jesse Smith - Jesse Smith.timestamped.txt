[0:00] [Music]
[0:42] lord that you walk beside us for we know
[0:45] before we were christians we were
[0:47] walking on the narrow house on the broad
[0:49] path that led to destruction
[0:51] and then lord the bible says the great
[0:53] shepherd left the 99 to go and save the
[0:56] one that was us lord god you left lord
[0:59] you left and you went and saved us and
[1:01] you brought us to the fold of god and

[1:06] walk that narrow road and you're right
[1:08] by our side we're walking the light and
[1:10] you're in the light dear god hallelujah
[1:12] and the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:14] us from all righteousness thank you lord

[1:18] alone because of your mercy today god we
[1:21] give you thanks and praise hallelujah
[1:23] thank you for being with us lord through
[1:24] the good times as we sang earlier

[1:28] mountain you're also not in the valley

[1:32] leave us or forsake us thank you for the
[1:34] fire that you've started in our lives in

[2:00] love you're the voice of mercy the voice
[2:02] of peace today may we hear it god for
[2:04] your glory and lord be comforted that

[2:08] you thanks and praise in jesus christ's
[2:10] name amen
[2:13] amen praise god i understand and take
[2:15] our bibles here
[2:17] this evening or this afternoon rather we
[2:19] like to look at the word of god i want
[2:20] to look at the church ages again here
[2:23] we i didn't get quite a chance to finish
[2:26] it so i'd like to
[2:27] finish that message from wednesday night
[2:30] today so let's go to ephesians chapter
[2:32] 3.
[2:33] i'd like to just start there
[2:40] this was our text on wednesday
[2:43] ephesians 3 5.
[2:53] ephesians 3 5.
[3:11] praise the lord
[3:15] we'll just read this one verse and
[3:20] then we'll have to be seated here by
[3:22] god's grace
[3:29] ephesians 3 5. now notice here
[3:31] the bible says there was ages previous
[3:35] to paul's day
[3:36] and then we'll read another verse here
[3:37] of course where the bible says the
[3:39] there's ages after paul's day
[3:41] so according to the bible there's ages
[3:43] all throughout human history praise god
[3:46] ephesians 3 5 let's read that together
[3:48] ready 1 2 3 which in other ages was not
[3:52] made known unto the sons of men
[3:55] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[3:57] apostles and prophets by the spirit
[4:01] let's go to colossians 1 26.
[4:07] we're willing we'll kind of dig down a
[4:08] little bit further into the lives of the
[4:09] kings of the old testament and trust the
[4:12] holy spirit will be able to speak a word
[4:14] to you
[4:15] and bless you
[4:21] colossians 1 26
[4:27] praise god
[4:29] let's read that on three one two three
[4:32] even the mystery which hath been hid
[4:34] from ages and from generations but now
[4:38] is made manifest to his saints amen god
[4:41] bless you may be seated here praise god
[4:48] so just keep your bibles handy we're
[4:49] going to just flip through some
[4:50] scriptures here uh by the grace of the
[4:52] lord and i do have a few slides to show
[4:56] today by god's grace
[5:01] well i tell you i enjoyed getting that
[5:02] extra hour of sleep i hope you did too i
[5:04] slept about nine hours last night that's
[5:06] the longest i slept in a long time
[5:08] so i kind of feel a little bit energized
[5:10] today
[5:11] naturally so i thank the lord for that
[5:13] and uh
[5:15] trust you got some rest as well by the
[5:16] grace of the lord
[5:18] so as i showed this on wednesday you
[5:19] know my source for this uh thought you
[5:21] know uh actually came from this book
[5:24] it's that book by the pentecostal
[5:25] preacher kevin connor
[5:27] it was his book that i also read about
[5:30] the seven feasts of israel which really
[5:32] gave me a great understanding about
[5:35] god's prophetic timeline for all or for
[5:37] all human history really it's just a
[5:40] beautiful book he's a pentecostal
[5:41] preacher
[5:42] and which is interesting as i was
[5:43] reading through it he's able to catch
[5:45] that the old testament has church ages
[5:48] and he actually identifies certain names
[5:50] of the of the kings but then in the new
[5:52] testament he's not able to identify any
[5:54] messengers
[5:55] it's interesting but it kind of goes to
[5:57] this pattern of how uh the bible said
[6:00] that the word of god would need restored
[6:02] at the end time
[6:03] right and so in other words uh
[6:05] throughout the ages they would have bits
[6:06] and pieces of truth but at the end time
[6:09] god would finish it and he would finish
[6:11] the mystery of god amen and so we're
[6:14] thankful for that by the grace of god
[6:16] now
[6:17] here's the picture i just looked at this
[6:19] last sunday morning and i was just
[6:20] sitting there and my eyes you know just
[6:22] got really wide and i said there it is
[6:24] so uh
[6:25] the brother the pentecostal brother this
[6:27] is page 148 was able to see how solomon
[6:29] was a messenger
[6:31] uh jehoshaphat uh amos verse nine or
[6:34] chapter nine he doesn't name a person
[6:36] but then hezekiah josiah doesn't name a
[6:38] person then names nehemiah and then
[6:40] shows how the early church had revival
[6:43] so he was able to point out and most of
[6:45] these i agree with i agree with you know
[6:47] i agree with ezra josiah hezekiah
[6:49] jehoshaphat and solomon
[6:52] okay but i kind of have my own ideas on
[6:54] a few other ones as we looked at on
[6:56] wednesday night
[6:57] so i want to uh
[7:00] i want to just
[7:01] kind of just rehearse real quick you
[7:03] know i guess i'll skip some of this but
[7:04] in 1954 brother braham mentions this he
[7:07] says seeing in the old testament how
[7:08] they were perfectly typed at the
[7:10] beginning in solomon on down through the
[7:12] time of ahab the dark age
[7:15] and i'm not going to read through all
[7:16] this again you can listen to it on
[7:18] on youtube now on youtube i did make the
[7:20] video unlisted because there were some
[7:22] statements i made in there that i didn't
[7:24] want to go public
[7:26] so if they already went public no
[7:27] problem but
[7:28] i just thought it'd be better to make
[7:30] that one unlisted so you can uh go
[7:32] through there if you'd like
[7:33] um
[7:35] and then we just read two scriptures
[7:37] we read two scriptures that showed how
[7:39] there was ages in the past
[7:41] and then in my book i wrote this as well
[7:43] ephesians 3 21 said unto him be glory in
[7:47] the church by jesus christ throughout
[7:49] all ages
[7:51] world without end
[7:53] so if you take those two scriptures we
[7:55] read for our texts plus this one
[7:57] it shows how there's ages before paul
[8:00] ages after paul so that means the days
[8:02] of paul it was an age as well
[8:04] in other words god always has ages now
[8:06] you'd be surprised that people have left
[8:07] the message say there's no such thing as
[8:09] church ages and i even listened to him
[8:10] this week and said there's no such thing
[8:12] as ages in the bible well apparently
[8:14] they got a perverted version of the
[8:15] bible
[8:16] because our bible that was backed up by
[8:19] vindication by prophecy by thus saith
[8:21] the word of god all these promises our
[8:24] bible records ages in the past and the
[8:27] future so that means there must be ages
[8:29] all throughout all human history praise
[8:31] god
[8:32] so we rejoice in that and we have
[8:34] confidence in that now i'm going to skip
[8:36] past some of these
[8:37] we have three types of church ages in
[8:39] the old testament we have moses's golden
[8:41] candlesticks which jesus christ
[8:43] interpreted
[8:45] as seven gentile cities in revelation
[8:49] chapters one two and three
[8:51] and then joshua's seven chapter book
[8:53] that he had written before he died that
[8:55] types of seven church ages as well and
[8:57] now the kings of israel which is new to
[8:59] me type the seven uh church ages also
[9:03] now i want to get i'm skip ahead
[9:06] i'm gonna stop right here now you got
[9:07] your bibles in the church age book
[9:09] brother brown brings this thought out
[9:11] that he mentioned numerous times before
[9:13] uh let's have some readers here malcolm
[9:15] you got your bible here brother amen can
[9:17] you get hebrews 13 8 brother amen uh
[9:19] malachi can you get ecclesiastes 3 14
[9:22] and 15. let's have a few readers here
[9:24] this this afternoon
[9:26] brother brandt brings out this thought
[9:28] you might remember it's called the
[9:29] keystone of the bible
[9:31] now the keystone is a foundation stone
[9:33] it's another word for cornerstone when i
[9:36] looked it up that last time
[9:37] so brother abraham says when he was
[9:39] studying for the church ages the holy
[9:41] spirit showed him a keystone of the
[9:43] bible
[9:44] okay and these two verses give us the
[9:46] keystone so brother amen can you read
[9:48] hebrews 13 8 brother
[9:53] amen so jesus christ is always the same
[9:56] in the past present future in other
[9:58] words jesus will never change
[10:00] so uh malachi ecclesiastes 3 14 and 15.
[10:22] amen praise god now hopefully by god's
[10:26] grace you can see that
[10:28] that out of those two scriptures god
[10:31] never changes
[10:32] now i'm going to read one as well
[10:34] malachi 3 6
[10:35] says for i am the lord i change not
[10:38] therefore ye sons of jacob are not
[10:41] consumed
[10:42] so the the keystone the cornerstone of
[10:44] the gospel is that god never changes
[10:48] and what god did before he's doing again
[10:50] amen praise god right in other words god
[10:52] goes over cycle
[10:54] prophecy cycles time and time again like
[10:57] we've seen that song these are the days
[10:59] of elijah are they
[11:01] yes they are
[11:03] in other words uh there's a people with
[11:04] the holy spirit that are standing up
[11:06] against ahab and jezebel amen hallelujah
[11:09] praise god the protestant and the
[11:10] catholics amen see that's repeated today
[11:14] hallelujah also jesus says as it was in
[11:16] days of sodom homosexuality so shall be
[11:19] in the days of the coming of the son of
[11:21] man
[11:22] as it was the days of noah where
[11:23] violence filled the earth and every
[11:25] thought of the imagination of every
[11:27] heart was evil continually and god was
[11:29] going to destroy the earth that's uh
[11:31] that's repeating again today
[11:33] so the keystone of the bible is that god
[11:36] and his ways are unchanging
[11:38] so that should make it easy whatever day
[11:40] we're living in we should be able to
[11:41] look at the bible and we can look at
[11:42] josiah we can look at noah or we can
[11:45] look at enoch and say my how did they
[11:47] live to overcome amen and however they
[11:49] were living that's how we can live amen
[11:52] and so brother man took this thought and
[11:54] he said i'm applying this to the church
[11:56] ages praise god
[11:58] and then the the to go along with that
[12:01] uh the bible said if any man add unto
[12:03] these things god adds the plagues that
[12:06] are written in the book
[12:07] so that's revelation 22. anybody that
[12:09] adds to the word of god
[12:11] gets plagues added to them in the
[12:13] probably the next life right probably
[12:14] the next life at the white after the
[12:16] white throne judgment
[12:18] and anybody that takes away from the
[12:20] book of the words here in this book
[12:22] their part is taken out of the book of
[12:23] life
[12:24] praise god and so we see that we see
[12:27] have an au we have an unchanging god who
[12:29] changes not and we are told not to
[12:32] change the word but to let the word be
[12:34] preached in its purity and let the
[12:36] unchanging word
[12:37] orchestrate our lives
[12:39] in other words the unchanging word we
[12:41] should always obey it it should guide
[12:43] our lives we should glory we should be
[12:45] able to open up the bible any day of the
[12:47] week and find inspiration to guide our
[12:49] lives amen
[12:50] because it's unchanging hallelujah
[12:54] in other words we've always been uh in
[12:56] other words the people of god has always
[12:58] been the minority
[12:59] we've always been the mock group we've
[13:01] always been the made fun of group we've
[13:03] always been the persecuted group now
[13:05] it's gonna if we live long enough we're
[13:07] gonna see it come to a real serious
[13:08] point amen
[13:10] where they're gonna get to the spot
[13:11] where laws are gonna change to persecute
[13:13] real christians you kind of see it doing
[13:15] now in america they're raiding
[13:17] conservatives companies even this week
[13:19] they rated another uh company uh they
[13:21] rated uh conservative lawyers this year
[13:24] you know the fbi and so forth they're
[13:26] they're raiding the conservatives and
[13:28] you can already see how it slanted
[13:29] towards
[13:30] uh the liberals and and and the sin
[13:33] group is starting
[13:34] trying to take away uh rights and laws
[13:37] of the conservative group in other words
[13:39] the people that believe the humble truth
[13:41] the people that are strong striving for
[13:42] truth they're going to be the persecuted
[13:44] ones
[13:45] so we can see that but that's been the
[13:47] same in every day praise god so we
[13:49] shouldn't fear but we should have faith
[13:51] that god is faithful
[13:53] and he doesn't change if he protected
[13:55] the old saints if he protected the
[13:57] saints and your mother your father your
[14:00] grandparents he'll protect you amen and
[14:02] if god cares he'll protect our children
[14:05] or your grandchildren amen god will
[14:07] protect us because he's faithful and we
[14:10] know the keystone in the bible that
[14:12] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[14:14] and forever
[14:16] amen
[14:17] that he's faithful and whatever he
[14:18] allows to happen in our lives we can
[14:20] rejoice in him amen even through the
[14:22] pain we can rejoice in it because god is
[14:25] in control amen
[14:27] and he orders the footsteps of the
[14:28] righteous unless we learn with job and
[14:30] satan god can't do anything or satan
[14:32] can't do anything to us unless god
[14:34] allows it amen
[14:36] and so we see by comparing the church
[14:38] ages that the prophet of god saw he said
[14:41] god is unchanging his word is unchanging
[14:43] i just need to look through history and
[14:45] see which man was the closest to the
[14:48] pattern of apostle paul
[14:50] or we could say which man was closest to
[14:52] jesus christ
[14:53] hallelujah because that's where paul
[14:55] learned the gospel from i didn't learn
[14:56] it from a man i didn't learn it from an
[14:58] organization or a creed or dogma but my
[15:01] revelation i received it from jesus
[15:03] christ
[15:04] amen now
[15:06] that's the keystone i want to make sure
[15:07] i get to that that you saw the keystone
[15:09] scriptures of the bible
[15:11] god and his ways are unchanging he said
[15:14] i am the lord and i change not so god's
[15:16] always looking for a man or woman like
[15:19] the original believers praise god who
[15:21] can overcome all the gates of hell
[15:24] hallelujah
[15:25] now i want to um
[15:28] i want to just go through this again
[15:29] here now uh
[15:31] i showed this on wednesday i update a
[15:32] little bit just a little bit
[15:34] now i'm able to identify the the number
[15:36] of years so the first the so this is
[15:39] basically the last two thousand years i
[15:41] was going to show this to sabrina so
[15:42] this is the last two thousand years
[15:44] since jesus died and wrote resurrected
[15:46] till now there's been about seven church
[15:49] ages
[15:50] where god sent mighty men of god so the
[15:52] first one was paul right and then uh
[15:55] irenaeus
[15:57] and then martin and then columba and
[15:59] then martin luther john wesley and then
[16:01] god sent us brother branham
[16:03] uh here
[16:04] about 60 years ago right
[16:07] so and each and each day you can
[16:09] recognize and it just makes sense uh all
[16:12] throughout history god's people been on
[16:13] fire and then after a generation or two
[16:15] they fall away right so god's got to
[16:17] send another group or god's got to send
[16:19] another man praise god who'll be
[16:21] inspired of the holy spirit to stir the
[16:23] people up and get them back to god amen
[16:27] hallelujah but thank god we're promised
[16:29] at the end time when the mystery of god
[16:30] is finished we're promised that we can
[16:32] eat the book and we can finish the plan
[16:35] of god the gentile dispensation on fire
[16:38] amen not lukewarm and not cold but we
[16:40] can finish it hot amen hallelujah praise
[16:43] god in other words there's got to be an
[16:45] overcoming church praise god at the end
[16:47] time who can go in the rapture who can
[16:49] be like enoch and elijah amen
[16:52] who can uh be so obedient and like enoch
[16:55] means dedicated amen can be so dedicated
[16:58] to the things of god that they live a
[17:00] testimony where god can snatch them off
[17:02] the earth amen
[17:05] so we had paul's age now paul died early
[17:08] in the age right so did
[17:10] iranians died early in the age now i
[17:12] find that the messengers always come at
[17:14] the beginning of the age
[17:16] brother man has different quotes on that
[17:18] sometimes he says and sometimes he says
[17:19] beginning so you got to rightly divide
[17:21] it
[17:22] paul iranius martin became at the
[17:24] beginning columba
[17:27] uh martin luther
[17:29] john wesley and brother brahm come at
[17:30] the beginning usually
[17:32] that's what i found now i find the same
[17:34] thing in the old testament so the first
[17:36] age was solomon he was a messenger then
[17:38] jehoshaphat
[17:40] and then uzziah and then hezekiah and
[17:43] then josiah and then ezra and then john
[17:46] the baptist
[17:48] i'm going to try to prove this by the
[17:50] way by the grace of god amen i'm going
[17:52] to try to prove that how many heard
[17:53] wednesday's sermon
[17:55] okay
[17:56] all right so uh
[17:57] hopefully uh then hopefully this will
[17:59] kind of build on i just want to spend a
[18:00] little more time on these kings so you
[18:02] can see some traits in their lives that
[18:04] resemble the new testament church ages
[18:07] praise god and uh as church as you know
[18:10] you know we can no matter what the word
[18:12] is whether it's old testament new
[18:13] testament we can glean strength out of
[18:15] it
[18:16] we've come to zion to seek his strength
[18:18] amen
[18:19] hallelujah his strength flows out of
[18:21] zion and we've come to mount zion amen
[18:23] hallelujah remember the last month or so
[18:25] we preached on that four sermons or so
[18:27] we've come to the spiritual mount zion
[18:29] and that's where strength that's where
[18:30] praise should go up at zion that's where
[18:33] his power flows forth that's where his
[18:35] name is identified on mount zion amen in
[18:38] other words the name of jesus christ is
[18:40] here so his power is here as well
[18:43] so whatever we have a need of whatever
[18:45] strength we have need of we can receive
[18:46] it today because we know we're in his
[18:48] presence
[18:50] amen
[18:52] now
[18:53] so we see how and just notice a few
[18:55] things you know the longest age of the
[18:58] old testament was that ezra nehemiah
[19:00] remember
[19:01] uh
[19:02] right after this you know right after
[19:04] ezra nehemiah
[19:05] as her nehemiah and and then malachi
[19:08] there was no profit for almost 400 years
[19:11] so that was that was a silent age right
[19:13] until god raised up john the baptist
[19:15] amen
[19:16] and so this was a very silent age like
[19:18] kind of like a dark age as well so in
[19:19] other words our dark age was earlier
[19:21] their dark age was kind of later okay so
[19:24] you just kind of have to see some
[19:25] differences it's a shadow it's not the
[19:27] exact thing but it's a shadow of it
[19:31] now i still believe this the most clear
[19:33] messengers i can find that i can clearly
[19:36] see type the the new testament are these
[19:38] four
[19:39] solomon josiah ezra and elijah
[19:44] i see very strong correlations now the
[19:46] second third fourth i see some
[19:48] similarities but i don't see much
[19:50] obvious
[19:51] types and shadows as i do in those four
[19:54] so that that remains unchanged from what
[19:56] i preached on wednesday but i think
[19:58] you'll see it as we go through this uh
[20:00] these mighty men of god in our day and
[20:02] then these were the mighty men of god uh
[20:04] during the time of the old testament the
[20:06] last thousand years before john the
[20:09] baptist in christ amen
[20:11] okay so
[20:12] let me scroll down here i was gonna just
[20:14] skip ahead well i guess we can just
[20:16] start right there okay
[20:17] now put these in yellow just so i could
[20:19] study them a little bit better and i
[20:20] could see them a little better
[20:22] so the first church age messenger was
[20:24] paul
[20:25] who lived 61 years imagine that 61 years
[20:28] my parents have already lived 71.
[20:31] he wrote two-thirds of the new testament
[20:32] his message was jesus sees your labor
[20:35] and patience but he warns them you must
[20:37] return to your first love
[20:40] church i hope i can get to this by the
[20:42] holy spirit but i might as well just say
[20:43] it right now this week i got an email
[20:45] from a person doesn't go to our church
[20:46] but but he was basically asking me how
[20:48] do i return to my first love
[20:50] i took him back to where jesus said it
[20:53] jesus says remember where you've fallen
[20:55] repent and then return to doing your
[20:57] first works the three r's
[21:00] so i just thought it might be uh needful
[21:02] you know if it came across to me there
[21:03] and i find it when i'm studying i
[21:04] thought well there's two witnesses maybe
[21:06] someone in the church needs to return
[21:08] to your first love
[21:10] and uh
[21:11] that's what you see all it takes is
[21:13] remember how did i used to serve god do
[21:15] we get so busy and so distracted with
[21:17] life and all the the responsibilities
[21:20] the daily needs of life you know daily
[21:21] needs of our friends and family that
[21:24] sometimes we forget what we used to do
[21:26] how do we show our love and devotion to
[21:27] god at the beginning
[21:29] well thankfully jesus says remember
[21:31] repent and return amen
[21:34] a three simple step process remember
[21:35] what you used to be you know sometimes
[21:37] it's really helpful to go listen to an
[21:38] older sermon
[21:39] from our church
[21:41] or sometimes it's really helpful to go
[21:42] look at some of your old pictures amen
[21:45] when we first came in the message
[21:46] brother bang
[21:47] i see how we were shouting and rejoicing
[21:49] and we're all praising god i got
[21:51] pictures from our first rental where i
[21:52] got pictures of you and brother uh uh
[21:55] brother john and a lady and carrie and
[21:57] my wife and lisa everybody's got their
[22:00] eyes closed clapping and praising the
[22:02] lord and the hands are up and
[22:03] sometimes it does good to remember where
[22:06] we were amen
[22:08] and that we can check up and see are we
[22:09] still on that same course amen are we
[22:12] still serving god with the same joy the
[22:14] same fervence and the same victory amen
[22:18] those can be very helpful praise god to
[22:20] look back and remember what we used to
[22:22] be amen
[22:23] because jesus christ said even in the
[22:26] first church age they're going to fall
[22:27] and they're going to need a revival
[22:31] not in the soul but in the human mind
[22:33] amen
[22:34] and the spirit to remember how that used
[22:36] to live
[22:37] and then repent god i'm sorry i don't do
[22:39] that like i used to but i'm returning to
[22:41] it now
[22:43] amen
[22:45] like i had a good another good text this
[22:47] week too
[22:48] um i told you that brother i was
[22:50] mentoring you know he
[22:51] he uh he said now he says since you come
[22:54] and visit me one time he said uh he said
[22:57] my family's back in church now he said
[22:59] my daughter's memorized the 20 books of
[23:01] the bible and he said i got in the
[23:02] prayer closet numerous times this week
[23:04] and i said hallelujah that's what i'm
[23:06] talking about a revival amen i didn't
[23:09] hear you praise god i'm talking about
[23:10] your first love he said get he said he's
[23:13] getting back to that first love church
[23:15] that's how we got to do it sometimes you
[23:17] and i remember we said last sunday you
[23:19] and i will be the ones that will restore
[23:21] others in the spirit of meekness when
[23:24] we're spiritual and when we're mature
[23:27] hallelujah
[23:29] so if so i'm just telling you if if a
[23:31] brother that i'm mentoring can see that
[23:33] victory in his life well then you know
[23:35] you can get that victory in your life i
[23:37] need that victory in my life at times
[23:39] you need that victory in your life and
[23:40] time and the way back is repentance amen
[23:45] repentance and return to the first works
[23:48] hallelujah
[23:49] and you'll see god come back in your
[23:50] life amen
[23:52] just like this brother is too
[23:55] now this is one of the best types i can
[23:57] find out through these seven church ages
[24:00] solomon is a type of the first new
[24:03] testament age messenger i'm sorry old
[24:05] testament age messenger he reigned 40
[24:07] years and then he wrote proverbs
[24:09] ecclesiastes song of solomon books of
[24:11] wisdom
[24:13] now his message that god told him when
[24:15] god met solomon the second time remember
[24:17] he met him twice the first time he said
[24:19] i'll give you whatever you ask he said
[24:20] give me judgment
[24:22] give me wisdom give me discernment
[24:24] after he finished the temple though
[24:25] seven years later god visited him again
[24:28] and god basically gave him a warning god
[24:30] gave him an if then kind of thing
[24:32] he said if you humble yourself and if my
[24:35] people call upon the lord then i'll hear
[24:37] them and i'll heal their land amen
[24:40] he said but if not if my people don't
[24:42] humble themselves and pray in the house
[24:44] of god then he said i'll pluck them out
[24:46] of the land
[24:48] and they'll be they won't have a king
[24:50] anymore in jerusalem and look what
[24:51] happens now look what's happened these
[24:53] two thousand years
[24:54] they don't have a king there
[24:56] right because they disobeyed and guess
[24:58] who was the ringleader of it solomon
[25:01] right
[25:02] he was the ringleader setting up those
[25:04] pagan temples and marrying a thousand
[25:06] wives you know
[25:07] he was the ringleader of the very man
[25:09] who started off he started off on fire
[25:12] but he left his first love
[25:15] but god's message was if you walk before
[25:17] me i'll establish your father's throne
[25:20] but if you turn away i'll pluck you out
[25:22] of the land
[25:23] that was the message sound very close
[25:25] sounds very close to me
[25:27] same idea
[25:28] now i want to show this as well in that
[25:30] first uh i kind of mentioned this
[25:32] briefly on wednesday night
[25:34] jesus's message
[25:36] to the ephesus church was very much
[25:38] echoed by paul here's what i mean jesus
[25:42] told ephesus i know your works well paul
[25:44] told us to be zealous of good works
[25:47] he said jesus said i see your labor your
[25:49] patience paul said uh
[25:52] well let's read it because i'm going to
[25:53] mess this one up i can't feel already
[25:55] i'm not going to remember that one
[25:56] romans 5 let's read that
[26:00] god is doing something in your life
[26:02] and he's building you church to be
[26:05] patient
[26:06] he's building all these through every
[26:08] trial of your life he's building a
[26:10] christ-like character
[26:13] look at verse three and not only so but
[26:15] we glory in tribulations knowing that
[26:17] tribulation works patience
[26:21] we all need more patience i'm not going
[26:23] to ask you to raise your hand we all
[26:24] need more patience
[26:26] how do you get patience trials
[26:28] tribulations
[26:30] but then tribulations make you more
[26:32] patient
[26:33] and then patience helps you have more
[26:35] experience and an experience gives you a
[26:38] hope of the resurrection amen
[26:41] gives you hope of eternal life amen
[26:45] this is god's four-step process to
[26:47] produce in you a confidence to know that
[26:50] you're saved
[26:51] to know that you have hope for the next
[26:53] life that you get to spend eternity with
[26:55] jesus amen
[26:57] tribulations patience
[27:00] that's the third one there experience
[27:02] and hope this is the four-step process
[27:05] so jesus says i see your patience in
[27:07] other words i see that you're letting me
[27:08] produce patience in your life so i'm
[27:10] giving you a hope and the hope was that
[27:13] they would eat from the tree of life
[27:15] hallelujah because that's the promise at
[27:17] the end of the letter
[27:19] to ephesus praise god
[27:23] and jesus said you cannot bear them that
[27:25] are evil
[27:27] you've tried them that say they're
[27:28] apostles and paul did this paul said
[27:29] prove all things
[27:31] and he said no we didn't give space one
[27:33] half hour to these people trying to
[27:34] bring legalism back into the message
[27:38] and are not and has found them liars
[27:40] and paul said those creations those
[27:42] jewish creations were always liars
[27:46] right
[27:47] and has borne and has patience and for
[27:49] my name's sake has labored and has not
[27:52] fainted paul said we faint not
[27:54] throughout our tribulations
[27:56] i see paul
[27:57] paul says the same message that jesus
[27:59] gave to ephesus because paul was the
[28:01] messenger to that age
[28:03] nevertheless i have someone against me
[28:05] because thou hast left their first love
[28:06] remember paul said i'm so soon i've seen
[28:09] you removed from the gospel
[28:12] glory and then he says grieve not offend
[28:14] not the holy spirit wear by your seal to
[28:17] the day of your redemption but the idea
[28:18] is that holy ghost-filled christians can
[28:20] offend the holy spirit
[28:23] they can grieve the holy spirit so
[28:25] whether god do repent and say you're
[28:27] sorry
[28:28] and return and stop stealing that's what
[28:30] he talks about ephesians 4 stop stealing
[28:32] stop lying tell the truth be tender
[28:34] hearted towards all the believers amen
[28:37] stop being so hardhearted right
[28:39] don't fornicate don't lust
[28:41] don't do those things come back to
[28:43] maturity and then you'll please the holy
[28:45] spirit instead of grieving
[28:48] so we see the same message
[28:51] as ephesus
[28:52] he says remember when you've fallen
[28:54] repent and do the first
[28:56] works and paul said be renewed daily in
[29:00] the in your mind praise god be
[29:02] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[29:05] see in other words you can get back to
[29:06] your original strength you can get back
[29:09] to your original zeal
[29:11] praise god that's what i feel like when
[29:12] i go to those churches
[29:14] and we now we didn't visit one today but
[29:16] that's what i feel like i feel like i'm
[29:17] back to my first love in other words
[29:18] anybody that comes up to me i got a i
[29:20] got a witnessing for them
[29:23] i got a word for them i try to give it
[29:24] to the pastors mostly but i try to give
[29:26] them a word just an encouragement praise
[29:28] god i find that takes me back to my
[29:31] first love because i know i need to be a
[29:32] witness praise god and brother ram said
[29:35] if he said if you don't do one thing
[29:36] else he said get a soul saved
[29:40] right and he that win his souls is
[29:41] foolish no he that wins souls is
[29:45] why so that if you're a wise virgin
[29:47] you'll pray for souls to be saved and
[29:49] you'll try to reach out and try to win
[29:51] he said if you can just win one soul if
[29:53] you've got one soul in your heart this
[29:55] morning keep keep praying for that
[29:56] person keep having a burden for that
[29:59] person that's why you're here you're
[30:01] here to take more people who will come
[30:03] and go with me to the promised land amen
[30:06] i'm bound for the promised land who will
[30:08] come and go with me praise god
[30:12] see
[30:12] so you've got to find we have to all
[30:14] find how do we get back to our first
[30:16] works if we're in that condition
[30:19] now what's amazing is that jesus says if
[30:22] you don't do this i'll remove your
[30:24] candlestick
[30:25] unless you repent
[30:27] and that happened to both of these
[30:29] that happened to both in ephesus and
[30:31] also solomon's day
[30:33] god removed the candlestick didn't he
[30:36] but this thou has that which uh thou
[30:38] hatest the deeds of nicoletanes which i
[30:40] also hate
[30:41] okay so that was in my book those are
[30:43] the scriptures i use and it's in my book
[30:44] that was on page uh if you're at 4 24 or
[30:47] 4 26.
[30:49] now here's what i mentioned on wednesday
[30:50] too solomon started off with one wife my
[30:53] dove my undefiled is but one
[30:57] but then by the end of his life he had
[30:59] to tell a thousand wives that i love you
[31:02] that doesn't sound very sincere does it
[31:05] i love you honey you're number 999
[31:08] but i'll see you tomorrow night i'm
[31:09] going over to number 1000 tonight
[31:11] remember like we saw with jacob remember
[31:13] jacob went from rachel to leah you know
[31:15] that's how they were but
[31:16] at the beginning salmon says i've just
[31:18] got one you're my dove you're my gentle
[31:21] tender sweet dove you're my uh you're my
[31:23] homing pigeon you're
[31:26] you're my lady right that's what doves
[31:27] are they're holding pigeons
[31:29] right they always come back
[31:32] he started off on fire
[31:35] but then he left his first love
[31:37] he even had all the wisdom he could have
[31:39] asked for
[31:40] he even he could have went back to his
[31:42] notes brother and sister he went back to
[31:44] his notes and said well this is how you
[31:45] love god proverbs
[31:48] but he he left that off for women
[31:51] right many strange the mouse and many
[31:52] strange wives turned his heart away from
[31:54] the lord
[31:56] now here's the revelation that came when
[31:57] i was preaching on wednesday night it's
[31:58] a small revelation
[32:00] but paul said according to the grace of
[32:02] god which is given unto me as a wise
[32:05] master builder i've laid the foundation
[32:08] another built it thereon let every man
[32:10] take heed how he built it thereon so
[32:12] paul was laying the foundation to the
[32:15] body of christ the temple of god that he
[32:17] was going to build up over a thousand
[32:19] years and here we are at the top of that
[32:21] pyramid temple amen
[32:23] there we are we're at the top of that
[32:25] pyramid temple paul laid the foundation
[32:27] song with wisdom and so did solomon
[32:30] solomon with with wisdom built the house
[32:32] of god
[32:34] they were both bible writers they were
[32:36] both wise men wise builders
[32:39] now i got this from a website solomon
[32:41] spared no expense for the building's
[32:42] creation he ordered vast quantities of
[32:45] cedarwood from king hiram
[32:47] had huge blocks of the choices stone
[32:49] cord and commanded that the building's
[32:51] foundation be laid with hewn stone
[32:54] to complete the massive project he
[32:55] imposed forced labor on all subjects
[32:58] drafting some for work shifts that
[33:00] sometimes lasted a month at a time i'm
[33:02] glad my work shift isn't a whole month
[33:03] at a time
[33:05] in other words i'll get a break after
[33:06] one month
[33:08] aren't you glad you don't live under
[33:09] solomon now
[33:11] he'd make you work 24 7. right give you
[33:13] a little break and you're there for a
[33:15] whole month and you finally got a month
[33:16] off
[33:17] and i had to last seven years brothers
[33:19] so i'm glad i'm grateful i'd live in
[33:21] this day
[33:22] right
[33:23] never get to see your family never get
[33:24] to see your kids grandkids
[33:26] he said there were 3 300 officials to
[33:29] oversee the temple's building
[33:32] solomon assumed such heavy debts in
[33:34] building that he's forced to pay off the
[33:36] king hiram by handing over 20 towns so
[33:38] he lost some of the possessions isn't
[33:40] that something
[33:41] he had to lose the possessions or some
[33:43] of the cities they possessed the gates
[33:44] they possessed
[33:46] he had to lose some of that in order to
[33:47] build up his temple which should only be
[33:49] holy for a couple of years
[33:51] let's say 20 years 30 years
[33:53] and then he's the one that made it
[33:54] unholy he defiled the own temple of god
[33:57] so he lost some of the blessings
[34:00] to gain the building but then when he
[34:02] had the building he lost the the
[34:04] significance of it he lost the love for
[34:06] the house of god
[34:07] and started building buildings unto the
[34:10] devil can you imagine that
[34:12] building the things that you once
[34:13] destroyed
[34:16] now here's another the last beautiful
[34:18] type
[34:19] paul said by the grace of god i am what
[34:21] i am his grace which was bestowed upon
[34:23] me was not in vain but i labored more
[34:26] abundantly than they are
[34:28] not i but the grace of god which was
[34:31] given to me praise god no one labored
[34:34] more than solomon right to build the
[34:36] house no one labored more just like paul
[34:38] no one labored more than paul that first
[34:41] church age messenger he sacrificed
[34:43] everything he said i can even recognize
[34:45] god was with me in such a way where i
[34:47] labored more in my short life than these
[34:49] brothers that live longer
[34:51] what does that grace
[34:54] let me say like this when you really
[34:55] appreciate god's grace you're able to
[34:58] serve god more than others
[35:01] when others might get weaker or stronger
[35:03] or discouraged right or sad or depressed
[35:07] for some reason because you love god's
[35:09] grace you're able to serve god with more
[35:11] fervency amen
[35:13] because god reminds you of his grace he
[35:15] reminds you of what he's done for you
[35:17] praise god and you and i are able to
[35:19] labor more praise god because we
[35:21] appreciate grace we remember where we
[35:23] come from praise god because we know
[35:25] that we that were forgiven much love
[35:28] much amen
[35:31] how could paul a man
[35:34] in the jewish faith labor more than
[35:36] peter
[35:38] but he could because the grace of god he
[35:40] always kept god's grace near him
[35:42] he always remembered god's grace
[35:45] so i can see ephesus and solomon as a
[35:48] beautiful it's like a great type
[35:50] both men were master builders one
[35:52] natural one spiritual of course the
[35:54] salmon i guess did too with the bible
[35:56] both men wrote the inspired word of god
[35:58] both ages were were warned to return to
[36:01] their first love
[36:03] and notice both ages had the candlestick
[36:05] removed from cities or from the nation
[36:11] it's a beautiful type
[36:13] now here's where we'll off get a little
[36:14] off there's three in a row that i just i
[36:16] had a hard time finding real good types
[36:18] now irenaeus
[36:20] he lived from 130 to 202 he had all the
[36:24] gifts of the spirit throughout all his
[36:25] churches in france
[36:27] now we're still laboring to get all of
[36:29] them here praise god and we're believing
[36:31] i'm not putting pressure on the people
[36:32] but i'm just urging the people let's
[36:34] keep praying let's find the position of
[36:36] god for your life and then you'll find
[36:37] your gifts amen
[36:39] praise god
[36:40] and that's something we need to grow
[36:41] into remember god is restoring the faith
[36:44] of the fathers
[36:46] that's why i often teach on that that's
[36:47] why i keep going back to joshua and your
[36:49] purpose and the gifts of the holy spirit
[36:51] because ultimately you have to answer
[36:54] you and i have to stand before jesus and
[36:55] he's going to say what did you do with
[36:57] the gifts that i gave you what'd you do
[36:59] with the talent so you could say lord
[37:00] here's what i did with them i knew what
[37:02] i was called to do i invested here
[37:04] here's what i did and we want to hear
[37:05] him say well done good and faithful
[37:07] servant
[37:08] how many want to hear him say that
[37:11] that's why it's good every now and then
[37:12] like maybe maybe for me every six months
[37:14] or so i like to go back to these gifts
[37:17] and i like to go back to this idea of
[37:19] you and i having to know our gifts and
[37:21] we should invest in our talents in order
[37:23] that we can see jesus and we'll have
[37:25] confidence on that day
[37:28] we won't be worried on that day we won't
[37:29] fret that day but we'll be happy looking
[37:31] for that day
[37:33] amen i'll be happy i know what he gave
[37:34] me i've invested in it by god's grace i
[37:37] did it the lord here's all the crowns
[37:39] for your head amen
[37:42] here's all the jewels for your crown
[37:43] amen
[37:46] now irenas also resisted idolatry of the
[37:50] false roman bishops in the first church
[37:52] of rome
[37:53] and he had the true godhead teaching
[37:56] now the message to smyrna was god knows
[37:58] your works be faithful unto death
[38:01] so this was the age of increased
[38:02] persecution now in the old testament
[38:04] josh jehoshaphat he reigned 25 years
[38:08] now his life started and ended well he
[38:11] just had one mishap in the middle
[38:14] when he compromised with ahab
[38:17] now church if we just have one mishap in
[38:18] our lives hallelujah
[38:20] that's why david always encourages us
[38:22] right because the bible said he did
[38:23] everything right just that one thing
[38:24] with your eye and bathsheba everything
[38:26] else was great in other words everything
[38:28] else was just minor little things under
[38:30] the blood of the lamb
[38:31] hallelujah but that's just that one area
[38:34] well same thing with jehoshaphat he had
[38:36] a wonderful life but he just compromised
[38:38] one time with ahab which brotherham said
[38:40] was that protestant
[38:42] a protestant make believer because he
[38:44] married the catholic i doubt or jezebel
[38:48] so what was his message his message was
[38:51] peace prosperity and he also had
[38:53] supernatural deliverance through the
[38:55] gift of prophecy
[38:56] through the removal of idolatry and
[38:58] seeking the lord i know it's a lot in
[39:00] there it's kind of jumbled maybe that's
[39:01] not the best sentence i could have wrote
[39:03] so forgive me
[39:05] now jesus message to smyrna
[39:07] was i know your works your tribulation
[39:10] poverty
[39:11] and but he says be faithful unto death
[39:15] the lord says fear not those things
[39:17] which thou shalt suffer it included a
[39:19] 10-day period of tribulation
[39:22] now the false vine became the literal
[39:25] synagogue of satan this age in other
[39:26] words the first church of rome
[39:29] right they became not the spiritual but
[39:31] the literal the physical church of satan
[39:35] this was the age with increased
[39:36] persecutions and the awful ten thousand
[39:38] year person i'm sorry ten year
[39:40] persecution by diocletian
[39:43] that awful roman emperor
[39:45] amen remember church many of the saints
[39:47] had to flee
[39:48] for their lives during that time
[39:50] they had to leave rome
[39:53] and thank god they did praise god
[39:55] see sometimes god's not calling us to
[39:57] suffer sometimes god's calling us to
[39:59] escape
[40:00] and take the gospel somewhere else amen
[40:03] sometimes god's calling us to run flee
[40:06] flee all appearances of evil praise god
[40:11] sometimes god will call people to give
[40:13] their lives other times god will cause
[40:15] people to save their lives
[40:16] and spread the gospel
[40:19] now let's look at jehoshaphat just for a
[40:20] few moments here just a brief few
[40:22] moments let's remember this good old
[40:23] saint here
[40:24] because he was quite a messenger
[40:27] he was known to seek the lord with all
[40:29] his heart now how many how many people
[40:31] could god say could god say that about
[40:33] in our church or our city
[40:35] where god could say you sought me with
[40:38] all your heart
[40:40] that's pretty humbling isn't it
[40:44] that's with that yet that's what the
[40:45] bible says about jehoshaphat
[40:48] the kingdom of judah was never more look
[40:50] at this never more peaceful or
[40:52] prosperous than under his reign
[40:54] because with the cities have store
[40:56] houses all the cities had city-side
[40:58] storehouses
[40:59] he was such a godly man now church
[41:01] doesn't encourage you if you want all
[41:03] the needs of your life just see god with
[41:05] all your heart
[41:06] if you want god to take care of all
[41:08] these little things i don't have to
[41:09] worry about the money and the food and
[41:11] the house i'm just going to see god with
[41:13] all my heart amen
[41:15] hallelujah i'm not going to get
[41:16] distracted with the little things i'm
[41:18] going to make seeking god my top
[41:20] priority
[41:22] and then god will bless you if you do
[41:23] that seek ye first the kingdom of god
[41:27] but his mate so he started off wonderful
[41:30] i think there was a couple of kings
[41:31] after uh
[41:33] sodom i'm not mistaken there's four or
[41:34] five
[41:36] maybe three or four
[41:38] but then he brought
[41:40] he brought a great uh revival to israel
[41:44] but his major mistake was uniting with
[41:46] ray with ahab to go against ramos gilead
[41:49] this brought disgrace upon jehoshaphat
[41:52] and disaster to his kingdom
[41:54] like they lost some of their previous
[41:55] blessing
[41:58] and then now the beautiful thing let's
[41:59] read this let's go to second chronicles
[42:01] 19. let's go down in your bibles because
[42:03] i don't have it up here
[42:04] i just want to encourage you with this
[42:06] church
[42:08] it's you know it's real my life i i know
[42:10] it's real in your life too
[42:15] you know we sing that little sunday
[42:16] school song just a little talk with
[42:18] jesus makes it right
[42:20] that's true
[42:21] but there's sometimes it's got to be a
[42:22] little bit longer talk with jesus to
[42:24] make it all right
[42:25] you understand what i'm saying not just
[42:27] a simple little prayer i'm talking about
[42:29] like a half hour prayer hour prayer
[42:32] spending a few hours studying your bible
[42:34] reading the bible and pray
[42:37] right that's what these men of god teach
[42:38] us if we're far from god we've got to
[42:41] draw close to god amen
[42:44] so
[42:45] jehoshaphat makes this awful mistake so
[42:48] god sends a prophet to him amen god sent
[42:51] a prophet to us amen
[42:53] to correct us from our mistakes and
[42:54] denominations amen and to bring us out
[42:57] of that and to teach us how to seek the
[42:58] lord
[43:03] so it's uh 19 11.
[43:07] look at verse two and jehu the son of
[43:09] hananiah the seer went out to meet him
[43:11] and said to king joseph shouldst thou
[43:13] help the ungodly and love them that hate
[43:15] the lord
[43:16] therefore his wrath upon thee from
[43:18] before the lord
[43:20] nevertheless there are good things found
[43:21] in thee and that thou has taken away the
[43:23] groves out of the land and has prepared
[43:25] thine heart to seek god isn't that so
[43:27] kind of god
[43:28] even when you're wrong god says look
[43:30] this you're wrong here but you've done
[43:31] some good things
[43:33] you got some good you got some good
[43:35] motives in your heart brother
[43:37] sisters you've got some good motives in
[43:38] your heart but you're just wrong on that
[43:39] one you're wrong on that
[43:41] you're going to pay for that
[43:42] but i found good things in your heart as
[43:44] well now look how he responds this is
[43:47] what i want you to catch look how he
[43:48] responds to this word of the lord
[43:54] in verse uh
[43:55] verse 4 at the end he says he brought
[43:58] the people back to the lord god of their
[44:00] fathers
[44:01] so after he gets rebuked he brings
[44:03] people back to the lord where he needs
[44:05] to be
[44:06] in verse five he sets judges in the land
[44:10] and then in verse six he says judge not
[44:11] for man but for the lord who's with you
[44:14] in judgment amen
[44:16] in other words he says let's get serious
[44:18] with god
[44:19] let's start playing let's stop playing
[44:20] games with god let's get some judgment
[44:22] over our lives let's get things settled
[44:24] right let's have peace and mercy and
[44:26] let's have uh let's have obedience reign
[44:28] let's have holiness reign over the
[44:30] people's lives
[44:34] verse seven wherefore now let the fear
[44:35] of the lord be upon you take heed and do
[44:38] in other words go do your first works
[44:40] hallelujah praise god
[44:45] all right now
[44:48] i think in the parallel passage
[44:50] well let's go down to verse 11 at the
[44:52] end of verse 11
[44:53] he says deal courageously and the lord
[44:55] shall be with the good the lord shall be
[44:58] with the good
[45:02] actually actually yeah there it is i'm
[45:03] sorry i go to the next uh chapter verse
[45:06] three and joseph feared and set himself
[45:07] to seek the lord and proclaim the fast
[45:09] throughout all judah
[45:11] okay so in other words church if we get
[45:13] rebuked and we fall away the simple way
[45:16] back is just repentance
[45:18] right just seek god
[45:20] spend some time just skip a meal how
[45:22] hard is that skip one meal and just read
[45:24] your bible the whole time right you
[45:25] don't have to be science fiction or
[45:26] something like that or something
[45:28] impossible just stop don't eat and just
[45:30] go pray and read your bible in the
[45:31] closet or something like that
[45:33] go get alone with god and god will honor
[45:36] that god sees that amen what's done in
[45:38] secret god sees it and then he rewards
[45:40] you openly
[45:46] now he was delivered
[45:50] and then these two nations come against
[45:52] him that i believe it's the moabites and
[45:54] the ammonites yeah in this chapter
[45:56] you remember this is this is where phil
[45:58] wickham wrote that song the battle
[45:59] belongs he got that song from this
[46:01] chapter
[46:02] because they were fighting on their
[46:03] knees
[46:04] right
[46:05] and they the the
[46:08] the prophet said uh jehoshaphat tell
[46:10] them to sing praise unto god and as soon
[46:13] as the praises started coming out god's
[46:15] in an ambush and the angel lord to slay
[46:17] all those hundreds of thousands of men
[46:18] out there while they were worshiping
[46:21] hallelujah so they'll see the battle
[46:23] belongs to god amen
[46:25] sing to the lord praise but you got to
[46:27] fast too you gotta you know see you
[46:29] gotta do these other things too you
[46:30] gotta show your sincerity and then god
[46:32] will fight your battles amen
[46:35] just admit i made a mistake i should not
[46:37] have joined with that group i should
[46:38] have not joined that person i should not
[46:39] have went to their house i should not
[46:40] have
[46:42] laughed at their jokes i should not have
[46:43] done i should not have done this
[46:45] financial deal with them right i should
[46:47] not have done that forgive me lord but
[46:48] now i'm seeking your face amen i won't
[46:51] be influenced by the ahab and jezebel
[46:53] around these heirs i'll be influenced by
[46:55] the holy spirit
[46:57] amen
[46:59] so jehoshaphat this was life or death so
[47:01] what do you do what did he do in a life
[47:03] or death situation he went to the church
[47:05] amen
[47:06] he went to the church he fasted and
[47:08] prayed and sang the songs he heard the
[47:10] voice of the prophet amen he went when
[47:13] his when his life was online he drew
[47:15] closer to god and no wonder the bible
[47:17] said his heart was after the heart of
[47:19] god too
[47:20] amen
[47:22] oh it's a beautiful story beginning's
[47:24] beautiful ends beautiful just one trial
[47:27] in between
[47:32] now what's interesting is ahab and
[47:33] jezebel married in this age but we know
[47:35] it was actually in the third old
[47:37] testament church age
[47:39] so i'm not going to major on that just
[47:40] just so you know now here we see some
[47:42] similarities between uh
[47:44] uh iranians and
[47:46] uh jehoshaphat both men have the gifts
[47:48] of the spirit operating we can see that
[47:50] and both men sought the lord and
[47:52] condemned idolatry
[47:54] so now i see i do not see many major
[47:57] signs like solomon the first love i can
[47:59] see that plainly
[48:00] but um
[48:02] i'll keep an open heart you know maybe
[48:03] there's other things there maybe
[48:04] jehoshaphat's not the messenger you know
[48:06] but i can't i can't see as good of a
[48:08] type as i can with solomon and paul okay
[48:11] just so you know now third age martin i
[48:13] know somebody's thinking i gotta get
[48:15] through seven church ages probably
[48:17] just give me a few minutes here let me
[48:18] see if i can get through this martin
[48:20] lived 315 to 399. he built schools and
[48:23] chapels for prayer he sent forth many
[48:25] preachers he had a miracle-filled life
[48:28] and he defied the first church of rome
[48:30] his message was saints hold fast jesus
[48:32] name and faith while you battle the
[48:34] doctrine of the nicolaitans and
[48:36] balaamism
[48:38] now the one that the closest one i can
[48:40] find
[48:41] is usia
[48:42] church look at this
[48:44] he saw god he had the longest rule of
[48:46] any of the good kings
[48:49] in other words church his rule lasted
[48:51] longer than david
[48:53] his rule lasted longer than solomon
[48:56] it lasted almost twice as long as
[48:58] jehoshaphat
[48:59] almost
[49:01] so there's something special about this
[49:02] man
[49:04] now the end of his life was horrible he
[49:06] had a horrible ending
[49:08] right just like solomon
[49:12] but he lived so many years so dedicated
[49:14] to god that we should learn something
[49:16] from this amen
[49:19] he was a vigorous wise ruler
[49:22] because but at the end he tried to
[49:24] insert himself he tried to make himself
[49:25] to something that he wasn't
[49:28] and church that's what you find have you
[49:29] seen it as people get older if they're
[49:31] not led by the holy spirit they just get
[49:32] more stubborn
[49:35] you got any older parents grandparents
[49:37] or anything
[49:38] any older aunts or uncles if they don't
[49:40] have the holy spirit you can't teach
[49:42] them anything new anymore they get so
[49:44] set in their ways they won't budge so
[49:46] i'm glad we got older saints here that
[49:48] are led by the holy spirit that can
[49:49] learn new things amen
[49:52] that are examples for us amen
[49:55] beatrice and brother william examples to
[49:57] us hallelujah brother jose
[49:59] where you can learn you can grow you
[50:01] don't get set in your ways and you don't
[50:03] get set in your sins amen
[50:05] but you get set and anchored in the word
[50:07] of god hallelujah amen
[50:10] as you get older you don't get more
[50:11] negative you get more kind
[50:14] like jose today gave you a holy kiss did
[50:15] you see that buddy
[50:17] he gave up jose gave he meant a holy
[50:19] kiss on the side of his head i like that
[50:21] sometimes i'll kiss some of you brothers
[50:22] on the on the neck too
[50:24] if not better get ready i'm going to
[50:25] kiss you on the neck
[50:27] i've gone when i go to cam church
[50:29] there's that one brother he always
[50:30] almost always kisses me on the neck
[50:31] every time he sees me the bible says
[50:33] greet one another with a holy kiss
[50:36] that's that's not a law but when you're
[50:39] so full of god's love how can you not
[50:40] kiss somebody
[50:42] well i'm just going to say that
[50:43] i'll stop right there
[50:45] be careful though right remember you
[50:47] want to make sure you're kissing the
[50:48] right place amen
[50:49] right you want to be
[50:51] holy you want to be sober
[50:54] not just throwing your lips all over the
[50:55] place you want to be sober
[50:57] but
[50:58] see this is what uzziah had he had a
[51:01] testimony that pleased god
[51:04] and his message was you'll get great
[51:06] prosperity
[51:07] and he almost reached the point of
[51:09] jehoshaphat the bible said through doing
[51:11] the right thing and seeking god
[51:14] now in the pergaming age of the new
[51:15] testament
[51:17] jesus saw their works their dwelling
[51:18] place now the third church age was awful
[51:21] for the false vine as far as the awful
[51:22] things they did church look at this
[51:26] uh
[51:27] the false vine feasted for 10 months at
[51:29] the council of nicaea but said that was
[51:31] the doctrine of balaam because balaam
[51:34] united israel and and moabites right at
[51:37] their feast 24 000 died that repeated
[51:40] under constantine at the council of
[51:42] nicaea it was an unholy feast
[51:45] right
[51:46] uniting church and state
[51:48] satan took his third and final seat in
[51:50] rome
[51:51] remember it was iraq right or shinar and
[51:54] then it was pergamos and then it was
[51:56] rome his three seats satan's three seats
[51:59] the doctrine of nicolaitans empowered
[52:01] the clergy to use the state to kill
[52:03] christians for the first time with help
[52:05] from saint that he wasn't a real saint
[52:07] saint augustine this first pope rose
[52:09] during this age damascus was the first
[52:11] pope and it happened during the third
[52:13] church age
[52:15] by fa now listen this by 500 years after
[52:18] christ the bible was only in one
[52:20] language
[52:21] latin
[52:22] 100 years before that it was in 500
[52:25] languages
[52:26] so see what they see what the catholic
[52:28] church did they cut off all the bibles
[52:30] and they destroyed and burnt all the
[52:31] bibles so they could control the bible
[52:34] they could control the bible and the
[52:36] language
[52:37] rather than allowing holy ghost-filled
[52:39] men to copy it translate it in other
[52:41] words get the message to every people
[52:43] nation tongue kindred and tribe amen
[52:47] satan tries to limit it where you got to
[52:48] come my way god said get it out make
[52:51] translations copy it go share the word
[52:53] amen
[52:55] go into all the world and preach the
[52:56] gospel with every creature these signs
[52:58] shall follow them that believe amen
[53:02] satan does the opposite
[53:04] he wants to control all the just one
[53:06] language he wants to limit the number of
[53:08] bibles available
[53:13] now here look at uzziah he did that
[53:14] which was right in the sight of the lord
[53:15] according to his father amaziah he
[53:18] sought god in the days of zechariah who
[53:19] had an understanding in the vision of
[53:20] god and as long as he sought the lord
[53:24] god made him prosper
[53:26] see he lived a godly life and reigned
[53:28] the longest of the godly kings now isn't
[53:30] this interesting the worst king reigned
[53:32] the longest which was manasseh
[53:34] the worst king reigned the longest
[53:36] that's just like the dark ages yeah
[53:38] right
[53:40] the longest age was the darkest age
[53:42] right the romantic church lived all that
[53:44] long
[53:45] because god was doing something god knew
[53:47] the church had to die amen he knew he
[53:49] had they had to rot but then he'd bring
[53:51] forth a shoot praise god he bring forth
[53:53] a luther in other words irish restore
[53:55] saith the lord amen
[53:58] amen amen
[53:59] that's what he did he restored through
[54:00] luther
[54:02] but it's interesting god allows this
[54:04] long dark age to go forth
[54:07] that was manasseh
[54:09] but uzziah always sought the lord for
[54:11] the first let's let's say 50 years of
[54:12] his life because he only got off at the
[54:14] very end of his life
[54:15] let's say 51 i mean
[54:17] you could say whatever you want i
[54:18] couldn't find it in history but
[54:20] so 50 think of that 50 years of solid
[54:22] worship
[54:25] think of that
[54:27] how long has your pastor been pastored
[54:28] now brother uh back there in ghana the
[54:30] one who shared the message
[54:33] pastor tag
[54:38] so it's over 50 years over 50 years
[54:41] imagine uh what a reward that man has
[54:46] 50 years
[54:47] now here let me bring this down to
[54:48] brother amen amen imagine leading songs
[54:50] 50 years
[54:53] he you know your pastor bastard 50 years
[54:56] in other words imagine being
[54:58] faithful to your ministry for 50 years
[55:02] don't you think god would have a great
[55:02] reward for that
[55:04] absolutely
[55:05] now now now let's go back to uzziah did
[55:07] that for 50 some years but just at the
[55:10] very end he's like i want to go into the
[55:11] holy place i want to go in there god's
[55:14] prospered me so much i can go in there
[55:16] and he made this awful mistake
[55:19] but the bible says
[55:21] great things about him he built towers
[55:23] in the desert he dug many wells he gave
[55:25] the people water he gave them much
[55:27] cattle the bible says he made vines and
[55:30] and orchards
[55:32] he loved the husbandry
[55:35] he loved the earth bringing forth
[55:38] he made engines and invented
[55:40] invented by cunning men he made them
[55:42] strong he gave them towers and bulwarks
[55:44] and arrows and great stones and his name
[55:47] spread far abroad
[55:50] he was marvelously helped till he was
[55:52] strong
[55:53] in other words god just made him
[55:55] stronger as the years got
[55:56] went by he got stronger and stronger and
[55:59] made the people stronger and stronger
[56:01] and healthier that's what's happening
[56:03] here praise god amen
[56:05] you and i are getting stronger amen
[56:07] hopefully healthier and more healthy
[56:08] natural but mostly spiritual praise god
[56:11] i know i might stop drinking pop amen
[56:15] but you know we need to get stronger
[56:16] physically but also spiritually that's
[56:18] the most important thing amen
[56:21] hallelujah
[56:25] and he did that for 50 years but at the
[56:27] end he kind of got this wrong spirit
[56:29] where i can be something i'm not
[56:31] and he had thankfully he had brothers
[56:33] trying to warn him right he had all
[56:34] those priests no you don't no don't
[56:37] don't stop stop
[56:39] but he wouldn't listen so he stopped you
[56:42] see zechariah died and he stopped having
[56:44] those visions from the prophet
[56:46] that's what happened he had to live the
[56:48] end of his life without the prophet
[56:49] zechariah
[56:52] so i can see some similarities
[56:54] both ages had declined right because
[56:57] martin was a trinitarian
[57:00] but he had tremendous miracles the bible
[57:03] said
[57:04] tremendous america he's the one that
[57:05] taught st patrick and patrick tore up
[57:08] ireland for the gospel
[57:10] he filled the whole uh nation island
[57:12] with the gospel of jesus christ
[57:15] but he was a trinitarian
[57:18] uzziah didn't reach the peace and
[57:19] prosperity joseph both men were builders
[57:22] martin built schools
[57:24] and usaid built engines and towers
[57:26] both men were famous for their good
[57:28] deeds
[57:29] the name of martin went around around
[57:31] the whole world during that time he was
[57:32] such a mighty man of god
[57:35] and so it is like uzi we saw that the
[57:37] bible said his name was known abroad
[57:39] now i don't see any other major
[57:41] similarities so i only see minor
[57:43] similarities that one's a little bit of
[57:44] a question to me
[57:46] fourth church age columba 1521-1596
[57:52] now he was a powerful missionary like
[57:54] and history says the only one they could
[57:56] compare him to were jesus's apostles
[57:59] for all the miracles like peter when he
[58:01] said rise up and walk right the gate
[58:03] beautiful
[58:04] the only ones they compare columba to
[58:06] were jesus apostles because they were so
[58:07] mighty he was so mighty in miracles
[58:10] he preserved the written word
[58:12] making reformation possible
[58:14] his college sustained evangelism for 700
[58:17] years now look at the church in his
[58:19] college his college was west of rome
[58:21] rome had so polluted everything that
[58:23] they'd shut they shut down all the
[58:24] churches and the bible's right it was
[58:26] all roman catholic but god had a little
[58:28] place over here amen
[58:30] columba had a little place over here
[58:32] where all the missionary work was done
[58:34] outside and around rome but not in rome
[58:37] god in other words god was sparing his
[58:38] little flock outside that major center
[58:41] of catholicism god always has a little
[58:44] remnant who stays true to the word they
[58:46] might not be at the center of it but
[58:48] god's going to protect his little bride
[58:50] and give her a little place in the
[58:51] wilderness where she can prosper
[58:54] amen
[58:56] see god can do it despite our ideas
[58:59] someone might have thought well you need
[59:00] to be in rome fighting against no god
[59:02] said it's okay i'm gonna have columba
[59:03] he's gonna be all safe out there he's
[59:05] gonna be protected he's gonna send all
[59:07] these preachers all outside of the roman
[59:09] empire because they don't want it in
[59:11] rome but they're gonna keep the gospel
[59:12] alive for 700 years of dark ages
[59:16] those in rome would go through the dark
[59:18] ages oh but there was a lie there was
[59:20] light in goshen amen there was a light
[59:23] in shiloh hallelujah where the holy
[59:25] ghost was with columba and his saints
[59:27] amen
[59:28] hallelujah church just because people
[59:30] are dark in your family just because
[59:31] their darkness around your friends and
[59:33] your family and your workplace just know
[59:35] that you have the light
[59:38] amen just accept it and say today i'm
[59:40] walking in the light amen amen
[59:43] let them walk in darkness but god has a
[59:45] special place provided me in the light
[59:48] of the hour amen
[59:51] i didn't hear you praise god
[59:53] thank god
[59:56] i do i see that all the time when i'm at
[59:57] school and this might seem small to you
[1:00:00] but every time i walk down the hallway
[1:00:01] there's kids you know different going to
[1:00:03] different classes all the teachers walk
[1:00:05] by and none of the kids wave at any
[1:00:07] other other teachers they just wave at
[1:00:08] me
[1:00:10] i walk down the hallway they'll be like
[1:00:12] hey mr smith hey mr smith they want to
[1:00:14] you know bump elbows give me high fives
[1:00:16] because everybody else has a frown on
[1:00:18] their face
[1:00:19] no i don't know their hearts
[1:00:21] but i know i show them the love of jesus
[1:00:23] christ and i've had new teachers move in
[1:00:25] they say why are you so popular mr smith
[1:00:27] i said i don't know it's just the love
[1:00:28] of god i guess
[1:00:30] because i told him i said i try to treat
[1:00:31] those kids like they're my own
[1:00:34] i try to be kind to them and sweet so i
[1:00:36] can see how
[1:00:38] if you love people if you show the love
[1:00:39] of god people will love you and the
[1:00:42] light of god will rest upon you amen
[1:00:45] but you got to show the love of god you
[1:00:47] can't clam yourself up and be all mad
[1:00:48] and angry and bitter and all these
[1:00:50] things you got to just cast those down
[1:00:52] you got to choose to walk in the lord
[1:00:54] amen as he's in the light amen
[1:00:56] you've got to choose to be a city on a
[1:00:58] hill that cannot be hidden amen
[1:01:01] amen
[1:01:02] let them see let the men see your good
[1:01:04] works and glorify the father which is in
[1:01:07] heaven
[1:01:08] amen seen in my life like i said i see
[1:01:11] it at work all the time there's so many
[1:01:12] testimonies but just just such as it's a
[1:01:15] basic one there you had a new teacher
[1:01:17] moving this year she said you're like a
[1:01:18] celebrity here i said i'm not a
[1:01:19] celebrity
[1:01:21] but the kid they just church i'm just
[1:01:22] saying they just know that i love them
[1:01:25] like the buses are driving let me give
[1:01:26] you the buses will come in i'll be going
[1:01:28] out
[1:01:28] and all the kids will be out the window
[1:01:30] waving bye mr smith hey bye see you
[1:01:32] tomorrow
[1:01:34] and they're like how are you so even the
[1:01:36] parents said it already this year why
[1:01:37] are you so popular it's just the love of
[1:01:39] god
[1:01:40] well i'm really strict on them you
[1:01:41] should come in my class i'm strict on
[1:01:43] them they lose recess you know but it's
[1:01:45] the love of god what i'm saying is show
[1:01:46] the love of god praise god amen let the
[1:01:49] light of god walk in the light as he's
[1:01:51] in the light amen
[1:01:54] that's kind of a side note
[1:01:56] so in this age jesus knew their works
[1:01:58] charity service faith and patience the
[1:02:00] last were more than the first
[1:02:04] now a type a type of this was hezekiah
[1:02:06] i can partially see it
[1:02:08] he reigned 29 years
[1:02:11] he did a great reformation this is the
[1:02:12] guy i love because he started
[1:02:14] as a king when he's 25 i started
[1:02:15] preaching at 25 or a pastor rather at
[1:02:17] 25.
[1:02:18] he restored the altar of the temple and
[1:02:20] worship after wicked ahaz
[1:02:23] that was his dead
[1:02:24] he destroyed that brass serpent those
[1:02:26] old moses worshipers
[1:02:29] there were some moses there are some
[1:02:30] prophet worshipers around when he was
[1:02:32] around but he made sure we destroy this
[1:02:34] brass serpent that everybody's idolizing
[1:02:37] i like that don't you church that's what
[1:02:39] we try to do we try to cast on all those
[1:02:41] brother man and worship in spirits right
[1:02:43] hallelujah they're trying to worship him
[1:02:45] and magnify him and all these things we
[1:02:47] have to destroy that praise god we have
[1:02:49] to make sure only one person only one
[1:02:52] prophet gets worshipped and that's our
[1:02:53] lord jesus christ
[1:02:56] god's saying that about you
[1:02:58] reminds me of jabez
[1:03:00] he said lord let me be more honorable
[1:03:01] than my brethren amen not that he had a
[1:03:04] competitive spirit but he wanted to see
[1:03:06] god expand his influence he wanted to
[1:03:08] see the glory of god move through him in
[1:03:10] a greater way praise god
[1:03:13] and he knew we have to earn rewards we
[1:03:14] he knew rewards are there for us and he
[1:03:17] knew i don't want to be a lazy worker i
[1:03:19] want to be a fruitful worker amen
[1:03:21] i want to bless the father's business
[1:03:24] the kingdom business i want to bless
[1:03:26] this gospel of jesus christ that has
[1:03:28] changed my life amen
[1:03:30] hallelujah nothing wrong with that
[1:03:35] so there was no kings like him
[1:03:37] in judah before or after
[1:03:40] now it's interesting i didn't have it up
[1:03:41] here but josiah they say something very
[1:03:43] similar about josiah so i don't have the
[1:03:44] revelation on that yet but i'm just
[1:03:46] going to look at hezekiah
[1:03:48] so outside of david and solomon
[1:03:50] who were united in one kingdom scripture
[1:03:52] says hezekiah stood out from all of them
[1:03:54] that includes 19 others
[1:03:56] can you imagine god lining up 19 people
[1:03:58] or 20 people he said let he said i'm
[1:04:00] going to call the one who served me best
[1:04:02] up front and god said bang
[1:04:05] bang steps and all 19 stay back there
[1:04:08] that that that's what god does
[1:04:11] god's going to exalt he says some are
[1:04:12] going to sit by my right hand somebody
[1:04:14] sit by my left hand
[1:04:17] it's equal opportunity everybody has a
[1:04:18] chance to fast everybody has a chance to
[1:04:20] pray everybody has a chance to witness
[1:04:22] everybody has a chance to give alms
[1:04:24] hallelujah
[1:04:26] everybody has a chance to be a blessing
[1:04:27] and say lord use me today uh show fruit
[1:04:30] in my life let me be faithful with what
[1:04:32] you've given to me because i know that
[1:04:34] he that's faithful and little will be
[1:04:36] blessed and much hallelujah
[1:04:38] everybody's got the fair chance
[1:04:40] so god says hezekiah
[1:04:43] trust in god more than jehoshaphat
[1:04:45] uzziah and josiah but there's a question
[1:04:48] mark after josiah isn't that something
[1:04:52] that's why church i don't mind anymore i
[1:04:54] used to get sad if nobody invited me to
[1:04:55] preach i used to get sad like well did i
[1:04:57] do something wrong but now i just
[1:04:59] rejoice in it i know god's in control
[1:05:02] and i know i don't look at it it's not a
[1:05:03] competition but i realize i've got to
[1:05:05] answer for my church just like those
[1:05:07] other brothers got to answer for their
[1:05:08] church
[1:05:09] and i'm going to devote myself to this
[1:05:10] church and to the word the bible said
[1:05:12] you must labor in the word and then if
[1:05:14] you labor in the word and doctrine you
[1:05:16] get double honor amen and that's not
[1:05:19] honor for men that's honor from the holy
[1:05:21] ghost amen
[1:05:23] because men aren't going to honor you
[1:05:24] for being more on the word they're going
[1:05:26] to despise you or be jealous or they'll
[1:05:27] speak evil maybe one or two will be a
[1:05:29] blessed but that means god is going to
[1:05:31] give you heavenly honor praise god and
[1:05:33] that's waiting for you and they're at
[1:05:35] the merit supper of the lamb hallelujah
[1:05:38] god oh god honors all those who are
[1:05:41] faithful to his name
[1:05:45] that's why
[1:05:46] church we just got to be focused laser
[1:05:48] focused on our ministry lord i'm going
[1:05:50] to be faithful
[1:05:51] i'm going to be faithful i'm devote all
[1:05:53] i have to you lord
[1:05:55] and then lord if there's anything else
[1:05:56] you want me to do just show me
[1:05:58] i'll be faithful to it
[1:06:00] i can't do everything but i can do the
[1:06:01] main things
[1:06:05] this was his prayer
[1:06:08] he died later than he should have now
[1:06:10] that's that's probably what most of us
[1:06:11] want brother and son i want to be late
[1:06:13] for my funeral
[1:06:15] he said i was waiting he said i was late
[1:06:17] for my wedding he said i was late for
[1:06:18] all these i was born late i was after my
[1:06:21] mom's due date
[1:06:22] he said i'm usually late to church he
[1:06:23] said i just want one more thing i want
[1:06:25] to be late for that's my funeral
[1:06:30] but
[1:06:31] but hezekiah prayed for this he said
[1:06:33] lord
[1:06:34] give me more time and god gave him 15
[1:06:37] years why because of his walk
[1:06:40] because of his dedication god gave him
[1:06:43] what he wanted just because of all those
[1:06:45] years
[1:06:47] he reigned 29 years
[1:06:49] so let's subtract it's just came to me
[1:06:50] now what's 29 minus 15 14
[1:06:53] 14 brother
[1:06:55] all he did was serve god faithfully for
[1:06:57] 14 years and then he's going to die say
[1:06:59] god i want more time god said okay you
[1:07:00] got 15 more he gave him more than what
[1:07:03] he had that's beautiful i've never seen
[1:07:04] that before till now
[1:07:06] god doubled his time hey
[1:07:09] lord double my time amen
[1:07:11] but let me be faithful with that time
[1:07:13] amen let me be totally devoted and
[1:07:15] focused and not
[1:07:17] leave my first love let me always seek
[1:07:19] your face and glorify jesus
[1:07:24] that was his
[1:07:26] his motive and objective with god was
[1:07:27] lord i you know i've served you with a
[1:07:29] pure heart so please ex
[1:07:32] expand my days
[1:07:33] and god did
[1:07:35] because god said i haven't seen any king
[1:07:37] seek trust in me like you have
[1:07:40] remember he's the one he got into he got
[1:07:42] into office
[1:07:43] the first thing he did was go uh put the
[1:07:46] the the gate of the temple back on the
[1:07:48] door had fallen off can you imagine all
[1:07:49] the animals that got in there all the
[1:07:51] you know the droppings and can you
[1:07:52] imagine this is a holy place the first
[1:07:55] thing he did was put a gate on there
[1:07:56] they said go restore the gate he said go
[1:07:59] restore the temple the tab go clean it
[1:08:01] out and they did it in such a quick time
[1:08:03] that they couldn't even keep up they
[1:08:04] announced it to the people they brought
[1:08:05] in all these sacrifices the priests
[1:08:07] couldn't keep up so they said let's hire
[1:08:09] some of those other levites here to come
[1:08:11] in and help us out it was a short quick
[1:08:13] work it was revival and church that's
[1:08:15] what we have to live live in revival
[1:08:17] amen clean up our lives amen get back to
[1:08:20] the things of god trust in god with all
[1:08:22] of our hearts amen
[1:08:24] live with the perfect heart before god
[1:08:28] and then maybe when you need it then
[1:08:30] maybe god will give you desire your
[1:08:31] heart
[1:08:32] but show first show first a perfect
[1:08:34] heart for years for 14 years
[1:08:36] we just passed 14 we're 15 hours of
[1:08:38] church amen how lord you uh trust you've
[1:08:40] seen my perfect heart these 15 years
[1:08:43] i've not been in this for money i've not
[1:08:45] been in this for popular for popularity
[1:08:47] i've not been in this for women like
[1:08:49] those three uh preachers temptations
[1:08:51] i've not been in it for any of that i've
[1:08:53] been in it to try to win souls amen
[1:08:56] i've been in to be devoted to the word
[1:08:58] of god and to finish the great
[1:08:59] commission i've been in to feed your
[1:09:01] families the word of god amen
[1:09:04] hallelujah that's why i've been in and
[1:09:06] keep myself
[1:09:07] also in the word of god as well
[1:09:12] like i said last week let me know how i
[1:09:13] can serve you better praise god if
[1:09:14] there's something i'm not doing right
[1:09:16] let me know
[1:09:20] so god gave him his permissive will just
[1:09:22] because of his perfect heart
[1:09:25] but god said would have been better if
[1:09:27] you died after 14 years
[1:09:28] but since i love you since you've been
[1:09:30] so faithful to me i'll let you live 15
[1:09:32] more
[1:09:35] so that was his prayer he was sick unto
[1:09:37] death
[1:09:38] yeah and he prayed to the lord the lord
[1:09:40] gave him a sign
[1:09:41] hezekiah look here's here's his fault he
[1:09:43] didn't render again according to the
[1:09:45] benefit done unto him in other words god
[1:09:47] blessed him but he didn't really respond
[1:09:49] the right way to god's blessing
[1:09:51] he was more selfish
[1:09:53] for look his heart was left he got
[1:09:55] prideful god gave him 15 years instead
[1:09:57] of saying lord thank you god he said
[1:09:59] look at me god gave me 15 years look how
[1:10:01] great a king i am
[1:10:03] he got prideful after the the miracle
[1:10:06] instead of humble
[1:10:08] that's what we need to be we need to be
[1:10:10] humble after god does something right
[1:10:12] and then we'll keep the blessing we'll
[1:10:14] keep the anointing and the blessing on
[1:10:15] our lives
[1:10:17] therefore there was wrath upon him and
[1:10:18] upon judah and jerusalem because he got
[1:10:20] prideful
[1:10:22] notwithstanding his guy humbled himself
[1:10:24] for the pride of his heart so he at the
[1:10:25] end he repented both he and the heavens
[1:10:27] and jerusalem so that the wrath lord
[1:10:29] came not on them in the days of hezekiah
[1:10:34] okay
[1:10:35] so he squandered the 15 extra years
[1:10:38] that god gave to set his house in order
[1:10:42] so i see some similarities but again i
[1:10:43] don't see major ones i just see minor
[1:10:45] both men were known as got the some of
[1:10:47] the most godly men colombia because
[1:10:49] compared to jesus disciples hezekiah was
[1:10:51] honored above all the kings outside
[1:10:54] david and solomon
[1:10:56] i see i see a few similarities there
[1:10:58] okay now this one is unmistakable this
[1:11:00] is just beautiful
[1:11:01] uh i was really excited on wednesday
[1:11:03] night martin luther was the first church
[1:11:05] at fifth church age messenger he brought
[1:11:07] the church out of the dark ages and he
[1:11:09] made the scripture in the people's
[1:11:10] language this was typed by josiah josiah
[1:11:13] reigned 31 years
[1:11:17] memory started ruling at 8 years old
[1:11:19] okay so that means let's see
[1:11:21] 39
[1:11:22] he died at 39
[1:11:25] wow
[1:11:26] my goodness and that's sad
[1:11:29] my goodness
[1:11:32] but he cleansed the temple and he
[1:11:33] brought israel out of manasseh and
[1:11:35] ammon's dark ages by literally finding
[1:11:38] the scrolls and he restored the feasts
[1:11:42] so i read this on wednesday this is kind
[1:11:44] of the story
[1:11:46] uh he started reigning at eight but then
[1:11:48] eight years later he finally started
[1:11:50] purging the idols out of the land and
[1:11:52] then when he started repairing the house
[1:11:53] of god he found the law of moses he had
[1:11:55] it read to him he weeps and cries and
[1:11:58] rents his clothes he calls the
[1:12:00] prophetess the woman prophetess and the
[1:12:01] sister said
[1:12:03] amen
[1:12:04] see god can use a woman as a prophetess
[1:12:08] not to lead the people but to edify the
[1:12:10] people
[1:12:11] god only leads the people with men right
[1:12:13] but god can inspire and edify through
[1:12:15] the sisters
[1:12:16] absolutely hold us fake by god that
[1:12:19] josiah's tender and humble heart was
[1:12:20] seen by god and he would not see the
[1:12:22] evil and wrath of god in his lifetime
[1:12:25] now here's the scripture now church look
[1:12:28] let me just jump ahead if i can
[1:12:30] manasseh manasseh was two kings before
[1:12:33] josiah look what this guy did he brought
[1:12:35] in abominations idolatry he sacrificed
[1:12:38] his own children
[1:12:39] he brought sun moon planet star worship
[1:12:42] back and back into judaism
[1:12:44] and he also prayed to the dead
[1:12:47] so josiah was raised up in a
[1:12:50] generation where the last two kings had
[1:12:52] prayed to dead people
[1:12:54] and there's abortions right and murder
[1:12:57] there's murder everywhere he rose up in
[1:12:59] that time
[1:13:01] and these evil men had done even worse
[1:13:03] they locked up the word of god in some
[1:13:05] of their dark castles and closets
[1:13:08] but when josiah was 16 he said i'm going
[1:13:10] to clean out the house of god i'm going
[1:13:11] to go through those dark areas i'm going
[1:13:13] to shine some light in those areas amen
[1:13:16] let's see what blessings are hiding in
[1:13:18] the dark amen
[1:13:20] hallelujah praise god
[1:13:22] and what did he find
[1:13:23] he found the book of the law and hilkiah
[1:13:26] gave it to him and he wrote it to josiah
[1:13:29] he runs his clothes
[1:13:31] he he humbles his heart he tears he has
[1:13:34] a tender heart
[1:13:36] tears and he says we need to make a in
[1:13:38] other words the people never heard the
[1:13:39] word like this before
[1:13:41] it had been hidden in the dark for two
[1:13:43] two generations
[1:13:45] but he said let's restore our covenant
[1:13:47] let's renew our faith and let's say god
[1:13:49] we're going to keep all these words with
[1:13:51] all of our heart
[1:13:52] now you're going to get revival when you
[1:13:54] start talking like that
[1:13:56] i'm going to serve you with my first
[1:13:57] love i'm going to keep all the message
[1:13:59] all the promises of god i'm going to
[1:14:01] keep all the word of god with a perfect
[1:14:03] heart now god's going to come back
[1:14:07] the king commanded all the people keep
[1:14:08] the passover
[1:14:10] now look he keeps the passover
[1:14:12] and there was not a passover like his
[1:14:15] think about this
[1:14:17] since the days of joshua
[1:14:20] because in the days of the judges the
[1:14:22] bible said in all the kings nobody had
[1:14:24] kept the passover like josiah
[1:14:27] nobody had killed nobody had inspected
[1:14:29] the lamb
[1:14:31] nobody inspected the lamb for 14 days
[1:14:33] right like josiah did
[1:14:36] nobody had slain the lamb there and
[1:14:38] applied the blood like josiah did amen
[1:14:41] hallelujah nobody made bitter bread
[1:14:44] unleavened bread nobody had purged
[1:14:46] hallelujah the leaven out of their
[1:14:48] kitchens nobody had swept and cleaned
[1:14:50] out better than than josiah since the
[1:14:52] days of joshua hallelujah
[1:14:56] 800 years earlier
[1:14:59] in other words their passover was the
[1:15:01] greatest in almost a millennium
[1:15:05] through the dark ages where there was
[1:15:07] not a real good passover celebration
[1:15:10] josiah brought it back
[1:15:12] and he could say we're having worship
[1:15:14] like the days of joshua
[1:15:16] oh
[1:15:17] hallelujah
[1:15:19] and what does pastor represent
[1:15:20] justification
[1:15:22] justification signification baptism holy
[1:15:24] ghost right
[1:15:26] passover justification sanctification
[1:15:27] take all the leaven away jesus went down
[1:15:29] to hell resurrection amen
[1:15:32] resurrection on the third day the
[1:15:33] baptism of the holy ghost and type amen
[1:15:39] i already looked at manasseh he was
[1:15:41] wicked above all so josiah had to undo
[1:15:43] all the wickedness that the worst king
[1:15:45] who lived for 55 years
[1:15:47] had brought in the back into the church
[1:15:49] now i see a lot of similarities both men
[1:15:51] majored on justification or the passover
[1:15:54] right martin luther what was his main
[1:15:56] message justification by
[1:15:58] faith
[1:15:59] both men brought their generations out
[1:16:01] of spiritual darkness through the
[1:16:02] revelations of the written word
[1:16:05] and both men reform the true church
[1:16:08] hallelujah
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:12] in other words martin luther gave them a
[1:16:13] bible brother amen they didn't have a
[1:16:15] bible martin luther made it possible now
[1:16:17] you can know the word of god before you
[1:16:19] did it but now you can know it no i knew
[1:16:22] that back buddy thank you if you can
[1:16:23] have it if you need it
[1:16:26] right but before nobody even had one and
[1:16:28] he found it in darkness and made copies
[1:16:30] and he gave it out to the people now
[1:16:32] they have the light of god's word amen
[1:16:35] he brought them out of darkness amen and
[1:16:37] he's let them walk in the light of the
[1:16:39] day praise god
[1:16:41] that's a beautiful type of martin luther
[1:16:44] it's exactly what martin luther did
[1:16:46] i'm trying to i'm trying to go a little
[1:16:47] faster
[1:16:49] wesley 1703 1791 he had an open door in
[1:16:52] sanctification
[1:16:54] open-air preaching revolutionized the
[1:16:56] age
[1:16:58] oh yeah this one i want to read out of
[1:16:59] my i have some history i found in my
[1:17:01] book here
[1:17:02] he was typed by ezra ezra had an open
[1:17:05] door for the jews to return to israel
[1:17:08] through a heathen king
[1:17:12] and zerubbabel's generation
[1:17:14] he opened air preach at a pulpit and
[1:17:16] then the wall was built by anointing
[1:17:19] upon that man hallelujah it was god's
[1:17:21] anointing for that hour it was god's
[1:17:23] open door praise god
[1:17:25] i'm giving you an open door you don't
[1:17:26] have to break the laws now the laws are
[1:17:28] behind you amen
[1:17:30] there was the age of open door for ezra
[1:17:33] and zerubbabel and nehemiah
[1:17:36] nehemiah was one crying and the king
[1:17:38] looks and said why you cried
[1:17:40] he said my people don't have a wall he
[1:17:42] said go up i'm giving you permission to
[1:17:43] go build it
[1:17:44] golden go there now an open door age
[1:17:47] amen the three heath and kings in a row
[1:17:50] right for his rooma esther nehemiah
[1:17:52] three heathen kings in a row open up
[1:17:54] those doors what god opens no man can
[1:17:56] close
[1:17:58] that's how it is in your life
[1:18:00] if god opens the door for you no man can
[1:18:02] close it praise god
[1:18:05] he was a ready scribe he knew the word
[1:18:07] he had a prepared heart the bible said
[1:18:09] to seek the lord and to do it
[1:18:12] and teach israel statutes and judgments
[1:18:16] he's present at the first mention of a
[1:18:17] pulpit i like that every time i see that
[1:18:19] every time i see this pulpit i think of
[1:18:21] ezra amen
[1:18:22] ezra got this out he said let's build a
[1:18:24] pulpit amen to preach the word of god to
[1:18:27] god's people amen
[1:18:29] and it was a religious awakening
[1:18:32] go to uh as you go to nehemiah 10 28 let
[1:18:35] me just show you a few things that he
[1:18:36] did
[1:18:37] nehemiah 10 28.
[1:18:38] it's right before job in psalms
[1:18:42] nehemiah i know i'm keeping you alone
[1:18:43] here i'm trying to
[1:18:46] oh my okay yeah i gotta close here
[1:18:52] maybe i'll close after this one maybe
[1:18:53] i'll preach one more here
[1:18:56] i thought maybe i'd get one or two
[1:18:57] sermons out of here just because it's a
[1:18:58] little bit smaller context here but uh
[1:19:01] have you enjoyed it have you enjoyed us
[1:19:02] okay good i love looking back at these
[1:19:04] old kings because the bible said i'm a
[1:19:06] king hallelujah praise god you're a king
[1:19:10] you sisters are queens unto god
[1:19:12] we're kings and priests and if a king
[1:19:15] how can a king learn anything he's got
[1:19:16] to look and see what the previous kings
[1:19:18] did amen or he's got to look to the king
[1:19:20] of kings and that's who we got today we
[1:19:22] got the king of kings
[1:19:24] i'm gonna try to preach two hours here
[1:19:25] so
[1:19:26] sorry uh uh nehemiah 10 28 i'm just so
[1:19:29] yeah these
[1:19:30] just heavenly places like brother tam
[1:19:32] said i'm still in heavenly places
[1:19:34] 10 28.
[1:19:36] and the rest of the people the priests
[1:19:38] the levites the porters of singers and
[1:19:39] netherlands and all they that separate
[1:19:41] themselves from the people of the lands
[1:19:43] unto the the law of god their wives
[1:19:45] their sons their daughters everyone
[1:19:47] having knowledge and having
[1:19:48] understanding they claim to their
[1:19:49] brethren their nobles and enter into a
[1:19:51] curse and into an oath to walk in god's
[1:19:53] law which was given by moses the servant
[1:19:56] of god and to observe to do all that the
[1:19:58] commandments of the lord our god and his
[1:20:00] judgments and the statutes and that he
[1:20:02] would not give our daughters unto the
[1:20:04] people of the land nor take their
[1:20:05] daughters
[1:20:07] for our sons
[1:20:09] so ezra had such a ministry that all the
[1:20:12] people came up and swore i said i give
[1:20:13] my oath i give my word i'm not going to
[1:20:15] compromise with all the heathen. i'm not
[1:20:18] gonna let my sons marry heathen girls
[1:20:20] i'm gonna i'm not gonna let my daughters
[1:20:22] marry heathen boys
[1:20:23] right
[1:20:25] and we are gonna separate ourselves
[1:20:26] we're gonna physically and spiritually
[1:20:29] separate ourselves from worldly people
[1:20:31] now that's a revival
[1:20:33] when you separate yourself unto god
[1:20:35] that's called sanctification
[1:20:37] that's what the word means
[1:20:38] sanctification set aside amen
[1:20:41] and so ezra's just preaching of the word
[1:20:44] causes these people to change their
[1:20:45] whole lives and say we're going to be
[1:20:47] different than our fathers we're going
[1:20:49] to be different than our previous
[1:20:50] generations we're going to be live
[1:20:51] separate unto god and we're going to
[1:20:53] obey all the word of god
[1:20:55] now look church they were even brave
[1:20:57] enough to say if i obey i'm blessed but
[1:20:58] if i don't i'll be cursed
[1:21:01] think about how brave that is
[1:21:03] they were sincere
[1:21:05] they were courageous
[1:21:09] how much okay yeah
[1:21:11] let me read this and then i'll just stop
[1:21:12] after this one uh
[1:21:15] page 462. i'm just reading history about
[1:21:17] john wesley
[1:21:20] 462. i didn't have time to get on there
[1:21:26] okay john wesley
[1:21:29] george whitfield oh introduce him to
[1:21:31] open air preaching and god bless his
[1:21:33] efforts with amazing supernatural
[1:21:35] results as tens of thousands at a time
[1:21:37] attended his services one two three four
[1:21:39] five six seven eight nine we have about
[1:21:42] 20 people here
[1:21:44] in those days though george whitefield
[1:21:46] said you go out stop preaching the
[1:21:47] churches
[1:21:48] he said the churches are dead he said go
[1:21:50] preach out there and they would have a
[1:21:52] few trickle in and pretty soon after a
[1:21:53] while waves of people started coming in
[1:21:55] waves because these people had never
[1:21:57] heard a preacher like john wesley he's
[1:21:59] the one that said he said live and burn
[1:22:01] for jesus in such a way that everybody
[1:22:03] comes to check out and see what the
[1:22:04] smoke's all about
[1:22:06] i've been touched by a fire amen so let
[1:22:09] the world come and watch me burn amen
[1:22:12] they kicked the fire out of the anglican
[1:22:14] church so john wesley said fine i'll
[1:22:15] just preach out there and it caused a
[1:22:17] great revival thousands came to church
[1:22:20] out there by the animals in the fields
[1:22:22] and they all got to hear the pure word
[1:22:23] of god
[1:22:25] the gifts of the holy ghost abounded in
[1:22:27] his life the believers shook under the
[1:22:29] holy ghost they fell to the ground as
[1:22:31] dead they wept shouted as they were
[1:22:34] healed and delivered from demons the
[1:22:36] dumb spoke and insane made sane and the
[1:22:40] dead raised the life under john wesley
[1:22:43] hallelujah
[1:22:46] he traveled 4 000 miles a year
[1:22:49] so he became a road warrior
[1:22:52] johnny was telling me how many miles he
[1:22:53] put on his car since he started coming
[1:22:55] here
[1:22:56] there's a lot of miles amen
[1:22:58] but he traveled 4 000 miles a year and
[1:23:00] over 40 000 preached over 40 000 sermons
[1:23:03] in his life
[1:23:05] at 88 years old he felt no infirmities
[1:23:08] of old age but then when he died he said
[1:23:10] the best of all god is with us the best
[1:23:12] of all god is with us
[1:23:17] let's stand
[1:23:18] both men preached or read the word in
[1:23:20] open air format i can see a beautiful
[1:23:23] type here
[1:23:24] both men brought sanctification
[1:23:26] musicians can come
[1:23:27] back to the people both men were
[1:23:29] thoroughly trained
[1:23:31] and prepared for their ministries you
[1:23:33] know john john wesley's dad was a
[1:23:35] preacher did you know that yeah and his
[1:23:36] mom taught him all these bible studies
[1:23:38] his mom's bible studies were so popular
[1:23:40] when his dad was out preaching that
[1:23:42] hundreds a hundred people would cram
[1:23:43] into his mom's home just to hear his mom
[1:23:45] read over his uh her husband's sermon
[1:23:47] notes
[1:23:49] they just love to hear the word of god
[1:23:52] church we got to get the word of god in
[1:23:53] our homes more praise god
[1:23:56] but he was trained from a child until he
[1:23:59] had this experience and then he was on
[1:24:00] fire ever since then
[1:24:03] both men had an open door ministry with
[1:24:06] little resistance from the enemy and the
[1:24:08] government
[1:24:13] now let me just say this as i close here
[1:24:17] i didn't have time to go through this
[1:24:18] but church each one of our lives is a
[1:24:20] story
[1:24:22] the bible says white throne judgment the
[1:24:24] books are going to be open and the book
[1:24:25] of life
[1:24:26] and you and i are going to be of course
[1:24:28] we'll be on the judgment but you and i
[1:24:30] all of our works will be recorded in the
[1:24:31] book there
[1:24:32] i was looking at uzi's life he only had
[1:24:34] about a page and a half in the bible to
[1:24:36] sum up his life what is god going to sum
[1:24:38] up about you for your life
[1:24:41] god could sum up that this man was
[1:24:43] faithful he built engines he built
[1:24:45] cities he had storehouses
[1:24:48] and just one time he turned away
[1:24:50] what is god's testimony going to say of
[1:24:52] you and i
[1:24:54] as we close say let's think about that
[1:24:57] the beautiful part is we still have the
[1:24:58] rest of today
[1:25:00] and the rest of our lives to make the
[1:25:02] story what it ought to be
[1:25:04] to let the author of our story let his
[1:25:06] will for our story be played out
[1:25:11] there's three
[1:25:12] things i want to bring out brother
[1:25:13] brown's life real quick at the beginning
[1:25:14] of his ministry his mother-in-law said
[1:25:16] don't go with those pentecostals and
[1:25:18] what happened he listened to her
[1:25:20] but then tragedy struck his home because
[1:25:22] of that
[1:25:24] his story's going to include that
[1:25:29] a second thing was in 1962 a brother
[1:25:31] named brother pope we have to look it up
[1:25:33] i can show it to you brother pope said
[1:25:34] you come join our organization he said
[1:25:37] we'll give you 500 a week which was five
[1:25:39] times the amount of money he was making
[1:25:41] he was only making a hundred dollars a
[1:25:43] week
[1:25:44] he said oh what have i got to do to join
[1:25:46] that he said oh just get rid of your
[1:25:47] water baptism and just you know get rid
[1:25:50] of that initial evidence thing and
[1:25:52] just get just get rid of that women no
[1:25:53] women preachers thing
[1:25:55] and brother man said i'm surprised that
[1:25:57] you would honor me and call me a man of
[1:25:58] god and ask me to compromise on the
[1:26:01] things that are more dear to me than
[1:26:03] life itself
[1:26:05] see church what's more dear to us
[1:26:07] popularity with friends money or the
[1:26:09] word of god
[1:26:11] the word
[1:26:12] the truth of god's word
[1:26:14] that tongues are not the evidence women
[1:26:16] should not preach water baptism should
[1:26:18] not be sprinkled it's immersed in the
[1:26:20] name of the lord jesus christ but that's
[1:26:22] an enemy that our prophet overcame amen
[1:26:25] how did you praise god and his story

[1:26:31] babylon
