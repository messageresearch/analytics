heroes updation chapter one I just want to read verse 3 like I certainly try to keep it as short as I can't hear by the grace of award thanks for the large appreciate about a wonderful job today thank you so much for all your labor of love amen so that's a remedy Revelation chapter 1 verse 3 yesterday was preparing this and I thought this quote about revelation will get to but really really jumped out at me and it's really quite striking so I want to start here and then start with some quotes and then some scriptures about just over overall like a review about the book of Revelation here as the prophet of God would teach us here I God's grace Oh revelation 13 while we read that together since we got on the screen there one two three blessed is he that readeth and they they hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand praise God even us have work fair nobody father / gathered again your presence Lord speakers now for that word thank you that you sent how the Easter more to tell us all about Isaac norden your profit was so faithful doing that Lord God and father were humbled here tonight Lord to know we're going to see Jesus for going to see Isaac while they were on that way Lord may we talk about it maybe love him maybe worship Him Oh God we worship you our husband are keen our ruler our Redeemer Savior or bless our died tonight in Jesus Christ's name everybody said maybe god bless you didn't see their grades back so we like to start their sister to mull not let alone us up here yeah if you'd like to switch it over on as these phones are here I really want to show these quotes okay praise God and trustee of lessee is you know I run over the church age book I think a couple times that I never quite had seen these quotes like this here so I want to start with that move on here sorry not coming up okay let's try this let me try the other device here and see if that works so the book of Revelation a powerful powerful book and brother Gabe preach at last week I was so struck struck when he said that he's like you know I used to be scared of the book of Revelation so was I for a while but then you know as you grow in grace is now to the Lord and you hear the word of God know then God takes away all your fear you know the last few years you know God's really opened it up to me where I feel like I understand it of course through the prophets revelation and so forth okay praise God alright that worked out pretty good I found that nice little picture out of here that oaks like that that's you that's us we're behind Christ these people can catch a really good inspiration can take I think it's pretty tremendous other cuts his inspiration but the person at the Battle of Armageddon as you know so for like that but let's look at this here and brother branham says some tremendous things I just want to take this thought tonight overall thought about brother branham says the book of Revelation gives you authority over Satan just this simple little thought and I just had never read that in a few years it seems like and it just blew my blew my mind away and it really humbled me I thought thank God that we're returning to this praise God the Bible of course the whole books been open the mystery the seven seals have been loosed off the books spiritually and the revelation has been sent down but it's such a good reminder here tonight so let's look at this as we'll see it so let's look here I'm going to start with the quote so you might just want to watch the screen and be blessed by a lot of these quotations cover and start with this quote I was so blessed by it it kind of give me like a whole new vision a whole new way to look at the book of Revelation I love you now progress and I said that the book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus and what he's doing in the churches for those seven ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these recorded troops right most of the ciples died before John wrote the book of Revelation 89 use the cycle that live the longest according to history right of course so Thomas went the furthest provide by a distance and so forth but John did the longest so this is a revelation that program tells us Jesus keeping kept from his disciples but Ramsey they had not been previously revealed to the hem you remember that they came to Jesus in the book of Acts NESN are you at this time to restore the king of Israel and he said it is not for you to know the times or seasons oh my those that were still thinking of Jesus having an earthly Kingdom wow so God that is bright of that name just continue thinking that's not for you to know you have to wait on that but he says it was a spiritual Kingdom he was going to build and even he could not tell them about his place in it for the father not reviewed it on the hitter but now after is that the resurrection on this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he's able to set forth herein this revelation of himself to chart this is when his glory and presence in the church would mean to the people and do praise God so how fast is that what is the friends of God being for us to tonight it means everything amen having his presence which is his power his spirit here means everything to us amen yeah and what would it do is glory let's see what his spirit would do in the churches all right that's what the book of Revelation is about now most of us know if you know the seven seals in the seven church ages most of us know what he did it through that okay but what I have to review it but I just want to us let's keep my own this stock here in this revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is one of the brothers and speakers tell me not that also one of the brothers tell me how he's so fearful to go to hell not I got a text in this brother but the thought came to me someone if seconds making you afraid to go to hell tell them I'm not going to take the fear that you live with right because say it has to live with that fear Satan lives with the fear to go to hell you can we can tell Satan Satan I'm not going to take your fear because God doesn't give me the spirit of fear God gives me the power of love and of a sound mind right just turn right right back about whatever Satan's tell you just sort of right back around and my headaches gone by God's grace oh thank you Jesus amen hallelujah he tells us how is he going to deal with the devil and passing lake of fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow Satan and Satan hates that Satan hates took for the people to remind him about where he's going right he hates it so brother BAM tells of the chapter a lot about was Satan hates we're going to look at that because he hates revelation and he hates the revealing of God's Word all right have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books the Bible more than all the others through though I'm sorry through liberal theologians and pseudo-scientists he's always attacking the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation and both these books we find Satan's origin is awful wings and his destruction now what were concerned about right now is his offer ways are we not because we you know will be there when he has his destruction right after got a guy he's tossing laying the fire those thousand years he's released i found will see that but what were most concerned about is we can live about his awful reception right now the church said that's what we need to but we need to be concerned about we to understand i might have said I've if you're in a war you don't need to understand the tactics of war praise God and to understand i was saying he's going to value invite you so you can buy them back it's just like a book on us and put off we would study the team all week and if you study hard enough you can pick up their tendency and then make amazing place I never remember one of these about guys on my team studied the place all week he was like living in the end up in the room and we were playing some big team that was really good i think it was Wisconsin or Marshall or somebody that was nationally ranked and he noticed he studied his enemy so well and he noticed their formation and when as soon as the ball was out he stepped right out because it was like a quick pass he stepped out intercepted it was like the passwords to him it took it for a touchdown and the whole crowd goes wild you know but I some how did you know they're good at least I studied the tapes as though i wish i would have said any more i wasn't interested in studying those as much as I was the Word of God back in those days but what a good illustration is when you study the Word of God enough right and know the Word of God you can throw your entity so well that when he comes to trick yup you already got the answer for I program said Christ the mystery revealed we got the answer for the devil's that right yeah so that's right he has awful ways and we must be concerned about that now but the book of Revelation tells us how to overcome them so that is why I Satan attacks those two books who hates Genesis and revelation as his beginning as ending he hates to be exposed and in those books he's exposed for exactly what he is what does expose me exposed before the Webster's mean you're not covered or protected and it also means open to view Satan hates to the open to view he hates to be detected right praise the Lord he hates for people to know that he's around so those same horse was like we were talking about at the same Bible and that's not where Satan puts most of his energy he puts most of his energy trying to deceive God's people that right say it hates to be exposed so see that's why all that young let's take worst 40 certainly having power darkness was say he's really not trying there he's not putting his efforts there but Madison as soon as you say y'all he go she points all his guns right it does that right so he loves to be hidden and not appeal people not know he's there what a coward he's a squatter right brother sees a squatter what a collar he is he loves to be hidden and undetected he loves to the sea now I said it my prayer murder because I know where I was going with my notes God glories in hiding himself but only because he loves to reveal himself Olivia only because he loves the power of Revelation amen at the experience of Revelation Bible said he know it's an honor of King to search out the mystery of God God loves to be sought after right and he but he's the one trawling us right I won't deceive us in your drawers and the nachos God is drawing us so we'll know hit her love him an understanding but Satan hates to be a brought to view he hates to be uncovered he loves to be undetected so that's what we wrote sakes being exposed for exactly what is what exactly is safe is that thought Kaimuki to my mind and some scripture started floating to my mind like John 844 you have your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do so the devil is a lustful fallen angel lustful that means pleasures right for lighting lustful is a forbidden craving so he has these cravings for things that are forbidden and he's constantly give himself over to those things he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not the truth because there's no truth in and when he speak of the lies because of his own for he is a liar and the father of it this is what my favorite i love the scripture this is after he says he rebukes Peter but he turned said to Peter get thee behind me Satan now we're going to fence unto me now that means that offense speeds of stumbling if you look up something stone so Peter was anointed of the devil to say Jesus do don't have to go to calorie surely you're not going to dial or surety and that was a stumbling block to Jesus right it was trying to discourage him from doing the will of God so Jesus looks at him as like this looks through him right not if he'd about the spirit anointed him right and he said Satan get thee behind me thou art offense you're trying to make me stumble to do the will of God for thou savers things that be of God but those that be a man now the word saver I just looked at this this was the one that made the most sense to me intensively to interest oneself in so he is not savoring the things of God say it doesn't get intensely interested in the plan of God ER in the ways of God he wants his ways and he does not set the infection on the things of God according to Jesus that's why we to make the Word of God and hearing servants and praying in church attendance and special meeting attendance right way to make that are our highest law or highest joy I'll say it like that let God be what you set your affection on a man like I said that sweats it make wednesday night the highlight of your week on make Sunday both services the highlight of your sunday yes it is amen because we are being filled with righteousness as we speak if we're receiving the words of God we've been training and receiving words of life and receiving seeds that water those they'll produce godly fruit in our lives amen so what exactly is say to me he's a disinterested in God in His Word Satan is love so for his own pleasures the man says is exposed for exactly what it is in the book of Revelation he's a murderer a hater of others lives he likes his life but I said he hates other people's lives he's a liar he hates truth he's one who will not speak God's Word or he'll give like ninety-nine percent of it right and then deceive you on the one percent but he won't tell the full truth that means the full truth one who cannot remain or live in the truth ordained for complete torment and annihilation in Jesus Christ exactly the opposite amen he is interested in God's Word where he is the Word made flesh he's only desiring the pleasures of the Lord he's a giver of life amen and he gave his life for others he's a teller of truth lover of truth he's one that only spoke the Word of God he's one that abode and truth the Bible said and he's ordained for eternal life andrew Lee program on the air amen nvidia it that beautiful now that he says in the church ebook I'm continue the same quote jesus said it out Satan this chapter one he has no part of me and I have no part in him a man i love that Olivia was let's take all of our parts Christ the word the devil would like to prove that everybody can not so he does all I can do to destroy the our confidence of the word of God praise God loves have confidence full assurance that God will keep his word but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirits revelation of the word the gates of Hell cannot prevail against her don't you love that when your stopper Satan tries to tempt you and he cannot prevail against you don't you know that let's call it walk into the spirit and I'd Olivia because when you're walking the flesh you fall short you make mistakes but when you're walking the spirit he does not prevail against you you prevail against it hey man as long as we have our confidence in the Word of God we will prevail against it when we live by the revelation of the word amen now I cut this short Earl is called a little short he talks about his ministry up here but I just got a little short cuz most you remember that it is the sermon ministry okay your airline industry he said I wish you could stay with me and see the face of people and Satan knows he didn't be exposed now it isn't the people that i'm talking about it is that Satan has got a hold in their lives through said indifference and disease well you should see their faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come over people's countess's st. is a brain he knows that the Spirit of God is about to let the people know of his works and that is why he hates these meetings so much I trust he hates our meetings to that idea that his his waves are being to see his deceptions his traps in sin are being deceived by the preaching of the word a mint preaching the message of God's problem amen hallelujah so Satan hates for the people of God to know about his works but he continues when names are called and disease is revealed Satan hates it ever listen to a good prayer line lately a Satan cause all their disease estate hates that God loves it here on Olivia does of their problem why is there what they can do to make it right God loves to be to be known right and he loves were Satan to be exposed what Satan hates it because what happened this is remember the law office session once it's exposed that there's a demon in the house but all the person has to do is confess that there's a demon in there repent of it right and then a greater power of faith will come in and drive him out then you got to get your house cleaned out right they got to have it have a stronger man on the inside to keep those seven forget back in Satan's going to come back in like our brother testified about being delivered from tobacco so was that but guys what's safe trying to cut back in but I had to keep them out right because I had a stronger one on the inside of me than those Devils that were in the World Cup it's this holy sphere is the faith and gods were any men that will keep out Satan from getting back in now what is this it is not by reading it's not telepathy north of witchcraft it is a revelation by the Holy Ghost that is the only way I can know it okay so by the AUSA just so you know you probably seen our videos videos on our website brother branham will come in a prayer line he'll tell people 15 secrets about their lives and say they'll say in the Lord and they get healed I met numerous ones and then that it got healed brother tim myers is a wife's grandmother sister hughes was healing tuberculosis in 1951 i got to shake your hand i got the meter it's right on tape you can listen to it romances go away yourself tomorrow let's save the Lord your heel and she and she kinda wanna she hung up oh she was faithful to brother Tim huge shirt that's her son yeah I came to preach one time and she shook my hand said you're preaching secular rather read a preacher said thank you that's the best compliment I could ever get I've been a lot to me and she went on to be a little old I think last year but this is a reality this was a gift that no creature has ever exercised and it is the last night of the Gentiles before the rapture amen its exact your I that's not save the lower from brother Brandon from the Bible too ok now let's keep going this is it's really really good here real good onions I'm going to try to buy half a half an hour more the Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all those is false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church into violent making it lukewarm formal and powerless amen church sometimes we feel lukewarm don't worry we got to be like that ego program talk about when your eyes get filled over you got to find a landing place and gotta beat your head until all that film comes off your eyes we gotta do it how to do that at the author writer and prayer or confession we said confess our sins but this is Satan's job to make us lukewarm formal and powerless oh my gods can help us overcome hallelujah auto break-ins see they're all savings change me broken by the bride of Jesus Christ amen now look that next he said the book of Revelation it exposes Satan revealing his works which which he rehearses works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's work right down to the time he's cashed in the lake of fire right he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before amen beautiful other video that's what we're striving for that's what we're living for this is what we're preaching for so that the church will grow in Revelation understanding that Satan will be cast before part not sure what that was okay forgive me that's pretty I worldly their partner not sure what had happened kicked me off that's what's st. trying to distract everybody with right there okay sister can you try that again and go back just cycle through maybe go two three all the way i'm not sure why that keep me up that was rather strange go back to hdmi to impossible thank you let's see if it'll take me up again sorry about a dad to work great ok well can you turn it off oppressor what does turn it off I'm sorry that that I grieves my heart say like that that kind of stuff grieves my heart cuz people give themselves to that nonsense thank goodness ok so we must discern the Antichrist spirit and then we stand it by God's grace so let me say like this like we said this morning with critical spear it's not enough to be able to point out all the wrongs out in the world we must withstand them race God amen we're talking about conspiracy there is between services all those things are true but if we let the music or we let those celebrities to lifestyles and tendencies and they're like into our lives me we just recognize that we didn't withstand it and we have to withstand all that by the grace of God Amen Alleluia now program says save will be as definitely for to today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert so just like jesus said it's written is written it's written so we can do the same thing it's great that's right it's written on the video yeah Satan hate revelation but we love it don't you love it when God murders reveal to you a revelation is a must at the lower let me know that a revelation is a making note of God's perfect will for your life so water baptism is a revelation is thus saith the Lord you must be baptized fully immersive water and you must do it as soon as you believe with all your heart and right that's a revelation and then we move on to marriage and divorce let me move on to all these church age is all these seals up we move on by God's grace but we're desiring today every day to hear the voice of God to know revelation for example like last week let me tear that testimony real quick brother Benjamin was up here and people saw him crying right out some people saw Carla than a service brought up standing worshiping I saw him crying a little bit I thought I just keep seeing some more song in my heart I thought I don't think he had enough experience with God that's what i was saying so I'm going to keep singing then I was going to go down and pray for him well brother back Brian I we went out to eat after church test as they brought Brian Hawkins in his family last Sunday night and he talked a little bit more about it he said brother Jesse said when I was standing there I said I felt a cool spirit kind of pass over me and I felt the presence of the lord and I felt something they said go pray for him and he said just ignored it right brother ran hundred many times that was the voice of Lord right we're trying to learn to hear the voice of the lord god help us to hear amen at the same time Benjamin's praying Lord if it's my day to repent I ran from you for 26 years if it's my day to repent have somebody come lay their hand on my shoulder last Sunday morning and brother bryan said he felt that cool spirit pass over him again and he said I don't care anymore i'm going to pray for him and brother mentor said he's cried Ares and all of a sudden he felt a hand on his on his shoulder unless he would've been his left shoulder because I was on that site and he looked up and he said praise God it must be my day he said he got to pray a little harder he says then he felt another hand on the shoulder that was brother cabin he said that's a double confirmation today's my day to repent I'm not happy are they near done but look at that that's a true revelation what's while I'm saying is that brother Briah got a revelation to go pray for somebody everybody see that that's a real revelation that's the will of God for that service and what's important it was at really important because God has heard our brothers heart God knew he was praying send somebody to lay head so that's why we got to be careful and all the time during service if you feel left to go pray for somebody if you just love somebody or just you try to follow leading to the Lord I thought that was so people in that beautiful so brother bride you really really doing good like it you keep pressing into those things of God he's just real humble i'll try to encourage of us that's really beautiful to see how hard to CERN like that oh my that was wonderful so Satan hates revelation we love it here's the next quote with true revelation our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over there now I find this in my life right now the reason I'm still prevailing over the gates of hell is because I must have received true revelation I amen right that's why I say he's not prevailing over me i'm going out into sin a worldliness all kinds that you can nade all the city the Bible there but that's why I'm still convicted because I have a genuine revelation so if people follow the way and deny this word to get back into sin it shows they never added to revelation that's right he's a true revelation jesus said will overcome the gates of hell let's read that Matthew I know it's familiar church but just that's a part sometimes we just forget over your number yeah Peter you got a new name it has the keys the kingdom and so we're like that but let's look at the power of Revelation once again because this is what struck me so much yesterday I got him out okay joke it on do good first half 25 Matthew 16 verse 17 and cheese answer is that had blessed art outside and bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed underneath but my father which is in heaven revealed that he was the Christ and I also say anything that thou art Peter and upon this rock of Revelation I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it we have a province church if we get real revelation hell cannot prevail against us who's going to take us to help but we already prevailed over hell hey today I knew yeah geez already conquered the gates of hell how can I go to hell when Jesus covered the gates of hell and crisis-hit knitting that Tim possible because it gave me the revelation of his word we will prevail over the gates of gates means councils and we literally you think my literal gates will there our literal gates of course to help because you wrote I talk on geez knocking down doors & gates and things like that one was weighed out but the Greek word actually means councils the council's have Satan to deceive us and take us away from Christ will be thwarted will be prevail against for true revelation of the word of God Amen hallelujah okay now I want to get down to buy important quotes here all right mr. Wendy I'm going to try this on the other device here so I really want people to see this I'm just gonna say oh ok it's that going help us jesus i really wanted this to work i want to see them people to see the quote oh okay I'm sorry sister I can't turn it off sorry church already tried to unless you're right it's not working that's the first time we ever had trouble with it we're preaching on Satan Oh at devil okay anyway as I've already said this book of Revelation is the consummation of the scripts remembers the last book of the Bible now you can know why it says that anyone who reads or even here same is what blessed that's where we right here that's why I open over that tech anyone who reads this program said if you couldn't read those days you just had to hear it haha cinematic so education doesn't matter somebody's gotta have education didn't read it right but education for every person doesn't matter it's the hearing of faith how the new gun right now here's Ralph this way I want to get to it is the revelation of God that will give you a 40 over the devil so when you know the revelation or the Word of God when you know the save the Lord you have authority over the devil so why hide one so in your life wise you have authority over all these temptation because you got a revelation of God's will that's why sisters will go back to pants as well go back to make up and all this thing like that why don't I go back to tobacco or dirty movies like that because I gather revelation with God's words that that's wrong and it's a reality to me and so I got Authority with those things come I could turn my eyes or I can rebuke them and their yeah you can turn it down because you've got an authority when God reviews his word and it's us say the Lord for you is thus saith the Lord to me that to put anything wicked before my eyes it's a sin so that when I see I looked away by God's grace that's power that's authority over city two are gonna be church that's exactly right and that struck me very powerfully he's talking about this revelation gives you authority over the devil he says and now can you see why they who would add to or take away from the book of Revelation would be cursed can't you see that now because the book of Revelation reveals all Satan's plan is all God's victories and to add to that plan or take away from that plan God curses you that's striking tremely striking because revelation is the blueprint of course the whole bottom but he's speaking about revelation tells that anything saying it's so important because these the shows you are you going to operate in this day at the end times and we need those revelations to overcome the gates of hell let's say phrasal already raised on the line amen other than you okay I said for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy is that simple brother branham says there's nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word Amen praise God hallelujah now this is the point I was once I got to that I really wanted to read preach this because I always spend a little bit of time limit brother have said no but messenger of Malachi for both men's ministry and revelation 10-7 is going to do two things number one he's going to he's going to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers I remember we looked at that a few weeks ago what has turned me turn means to repent because remember Israel has left Egypt and the Bible said in their hearts they turned back to Egypt so when your heart is turned toward something you fall in love with it amen ha ha ha so brother and his ministry turns our hearts back to the fathers that that means we fall in love with the early apostolic faith of the Christians praise God we fall in love with that that's exactly right now the second thing he would do he would reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are what they are the revelations contained in the seven seals okay alright so that's what the seventh age was supposed to do because that's what the Bible said he took the open book and he prophesied that book you refinish the mysteries that were in that open book and the book cannot be open until the skills were taking off right okay so this is completely scriptural this just is people making this up that's what the Bible said in chapters five six and seven right the seals Jesus looses the seals send comes down in that mighty angel gives them to a seventh angel and then John eats it up as we heard last Sunday and takes it to all nations kingdom to peoples and tongues hallelujah no this is powerful it will be these divinely revealed mystery truce that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so my so let me let me reword that another way our hearts can only be turned back to the apostolic faith through the book of Revelation praise God right because the seven dollars out of their voices when that open book come down to earth but God said john doe right it's for the end time when the mysteries finished with the seventh angel on Olivia amen if we don't understand the book of Revelation your heart cannot turn back but if your heart sugar back that God will help you understand the book of Revelation a then it's impossible because that's the Ministry of Revelation ten said you have to receive that in order to receive the Pentecostal faith of the fathers for the ramp steps oh my that's beautiful Oh hallelujah thank you Jesus now there's two quotes or mother has already set the thunders were already revealed people wonder the seven rather seven thunders weather have already said what they were in questions answers 1964 they said have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed where they revealed the seven seals but are not yet known to us as the thunders yet he said no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the seventh butters were about the seven thunders were about the seven seals okay and then he says again the church age book I just read it yes he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation tent which are the revelations contained in the seven seals praise God so let's go to Revelation chapter 10 please let's go there in your Bibles so just having the book of Revelation is so powerful did you brothers ever hear in your denomination I never did I never heard nothing about the book of everything today they say the real far away from them because people they know that that's controversial people got this idea that idea and everything like that and church and honestly those clouds features are awesome themselves they don't know because they're not profits if a prophet prophesize was only would have to interpret another prophet but we received a profit a man who's told us thus saith the Lord hallelujah and then were after each and every one of those seven seals he said that buff saith the Lord after each and every one ah I did he say God revealed this to me this is the perfect revelation the perfect interpretation of each seal hey man hallelujah and without that you cannot overcome the gates of hell with ram says you have to know the revelations of the book of Revelation is that the day an hour we're living it Oh beautiful beautiful okay so we're in Revelation chapter 10 right got through your box okay now brother amen King I'll shake your hand I just assumed you had okay yeah we got it looking I got sorry sometimes I I put you on the spot for guinea I just I just look up there I assume people got good eyesight they don't get the ohel people have their voices post my voice a little bit too sorry brother i do that that for the 7th they do forgive me because especially if i put it up there all the time just get used to me put it up there so forgive you verse 7 not when the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished if he had declared to his servants the prophets okay now I want to read this quote here brother Brandon gave this is from Paris what does he traction on the matter ok well the Bramson what's happened on not son said that's where brother branham met the angel the Lord and all those angels God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about all the noise that father on his ministry that's what it was about God fulfilling his word he said notice it's God fulfilling his promise word again of Revelation 10 12 7 and if you skipped down free pair could have some paragraph 1 52 but I said the God of heaven promised the evening time would have lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy in what time is it sir but now its history it's past the promise is fulfilled what time is it CERN what's this attraction it's God fulfilling his word amen so revelation 10 when the seven is history it's already happened the church said so when we read this it already happened God always does this guy always revealed his word first of course he prophesized it but he doesn't really tell the interpretation of it till the RT interprets it himself amen hi the video so that's what he did in Revelation 1074 told it but then it came to pass and he comes back later through a prophet and said I've already fulfilled this it's already done its history amen glory so verse 1 in Revelation 10 I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud that's the picture we have of the cloud looks just like the Hoffmans head of christ and the rainbow was on his head and his face was as to where the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had his head in a little book open and he said his right foot upon the scene his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voices with allied north and when he decried seven thunders uttered their voices praise God now remember when brother brahim said he went out come out sunset he said the Angels told him to go back east and opened the seven seals for God we know that so that age of coming down was versus one and two right but when brother Branham begins to preach the seven seals in March of 1963 first three starts being fulfilled amen not a video that's exactly right and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar and when he cried seven thunders uttered his voice on what well the better say the seven thunders were they were the revelations contained in the seven seals praise God it's exactly right now the book this mysterious little book was open in chapter 5 i'm sorry i'm in chapter 5 it was put in the hands of Christ will go to chapter 6 verse 1 chapter 5 Christ comes and takes the book right John screens everybody hears him in heaven earth under the seat everywhere God God less that phrase go throughout all times and spaces and dimensions through him so powerful my challenge on now verse 10 and I and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard I said where the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer praise God so how many can see that how they can see that when the seal was loose a thunder roared everybody see that praise God now brother branham steady each seal had three forms a symbol for which is what John saw the symbol form and wrote in a book the reality Foreman X that writer actually goes riding upon the earth the Antichrist spirit and then the revelation form to tell you what the symbols mean that was brother branham's ministry I got all the boats are going to email I'm ready to email Indy the coach from this corner if anybody wants these quotes brother arms the same thing this isn't another seal but I said notice the first seal when it was open the civil forum at thunder now what about when its open in skree ality for more the brand of sense haha oh hi he says first is with God next it's an assemble that it's revealed these things it's coming forward from the throne amen first it can be seen heard nothing it's sealed up but lambs blood paid the price at Thunder when he spoke out and when he did a white horse rider started out and it still was a symbol I want to go back to this now I just want to go back to this on March eighteen nineteen sixty-three brother branham priest the first seal when he got down he said thus saith the Lord these are the revelations while he was preaching that was the voice of God as a thunder thundering out that was one of the seven thunders of Revelation tenth chapter 3 everyone think that was one of the Thunder because my dad said there were seven consecutive one two three four five six seven seven consecutive letters at roar right in a row praise God so all the mysteries of Whitehorse the mystery of all these things that the boat without an arrow all that was a mystery until the voice of God Thunder not the revelation and set down safe below that's exactly right on March 19th the second seal and the house and that's this is my favorite one for program says it I say the Lord he put on one of my videos I love it but he says do you love it do you believe it and everybody's clapping shot he goes that's the same for the hard and they just erupted to worse about the pie feel like I'm there right down Adrian might Olivia but Marcia I teeth was the second seal and the revelations was the Thunder the second Thunder boys where he's gone and so for bars 22 third the third seal mark 20 Birds the fourth seal the fourth under glory mar 22nd the fifth seal which was the fifth under all those revelations was God thundering for his word about what they were other news program said this is history this already happened amen re bark 23rd the sixth seal was the sixth under and Mark 24 the seventh seal member only one of this part was revealed like the revelation of it was revealed not the reality and there was no symbol for it but the revelation of the seven thunders or seven seal was revealed the seven thunders uttered it out what was it it was the day and hour when Christ would return brother branham said so is the date it's the moment of the rapture praise God that's the mystery behind the Seventh Seal that's what the set of mother said about it at the day or hour when Christ comes and there's no symbol of it so nobody knows anything about it saying can impersonate it but will be ready because the times and seasons will be prepared for because we get our meat a new season we get our spiritual word due season will be ready church because God has feed us is where they had I knew yeah amen it's exactly right hmm now I said all that to get to this we don't have to be garrett of the book of Revelation it is our key to the authority over Satan okay and I got five minutes okay so i'm really going to close already going to close it's our key all these revelations I'm just going to just mention this real quick back when I preach other seven seals a few months ago I showed how the four horse riders are Satan's Antichrist spirit and how they got into the church but I took it a step further and I believe if your spiritual you saw that we got to keep that rider for riding into our lives and he uses the same method he comes as a white horse real sweet and deceptive all my surely he won't die he told he wrote in the leaves he's mine surely God will not kill you look how he comes in all deceptive and the Bible said he didn't even know what she was doing she was so deceived praise God but there that that sin that was deceptive will become a murderous a red horse and you start killing people's testimonies right killing their character their their character and all these things like that to start bickering bad enough and back by and stabbing people in the back that's what sin does and then the the black horse you start trying to build your own Kingdom that's what about their their had all the control of the money right with the scale bounces and all these things and you're trying to get make your own build your own Kingdom build your own ministry yourself like that you'd understand i said and then the last one was dead and that's where you're spiritually separated from God you you can be alive with dead to bible said she that live with it pleasure is dead wash this when it's true for him that lives a pleasure to their den mother alive amen exactly right to walk through here to here to the revelation of God and then walked away live and said God have mercy because it's very possible they've crossed a line from death of the life and now they're in death I'll do because that's the final step the white the red the black and the pale now let me just go through this or whether the next time we'll go a little bit more deeper into this for church brother I have said this romancin the first three chapters the book of Revelation reveals all the happenings that search then from the third chapter of the 19th chapter of Revelation there's no more scene of the church the church goes up at the board chapter of Revelation and returns back at the 19 chapter of Revelations the bride had grouped together coming to the earth he says during the form to the 19th chapter God is dealing with instra honey bleep net that's right now when I preach that I showed how though the bride was hiding in some of these chapters between chapter 4 19 the bride is hiding in a few those chapters at union if you know your Bible real well okay or gods revealed to you perhaps which would be a glorious thing so I'm going to go through all 22 chapters real quick in three minutes chapters 1 2 & 3 are the church agents there for the last 2,000 years plus today until the rapture goes that it's over then that's all fulfilled chapter four and five now I believe chapter 4 and 5 and this I could be wrong with this everybody listen I could be wrong with this but i believe chapter 4 or 5 is already history too I believe Jesus already came in heaven took the book open it up and send it down himself as an angel I just believe that cuz honking the book how can we receive the whole book if it wasn't open in heaven yeah that's just my thought where I can be wrong on that brother Jose you got to heard that but I that I didn't get that from anybody that's what came to me as I studied the Word of God that's what I honestly believe I think that is look either that happened in 1963 to be honest I can be your own but that's what I believe because he first had to come take the book everybody rejoice that now the seals can be loose Redemption can be fully briefed they head and then it came down through an angel anuya took his picture right gave it to a profit and now it's going around around the world hallelujah hey so I just I could be wrong with that but i believe chapter 4 and 5 is already fulfilled i believe its history chapter 6 is the first six steals so we're under the fourth seal right now right the pale horse rider that's we're on the right down so the first three been fulfilled before five six and seven are to come but you only see the first six there okay so tribulation is the sixth seal right so in chapter 6 we start getting into the Tribulation Period chapter 7 is the Tribulation Period this is 144 thousand Jews have to go through the tribulation their brother must suffer for a little season to receive the white robes okay chapter eight chapter eight god hi hit the rapture in their first one is the rapture he left the seven see the opening of seven sealed their silence in heaven because Christ come down to the sky to catch his bride away that's mine talk to you that's my thought too so and then the rest of chapter 8 is the first four trumpets and it mentions the first read all three woes so that's Tribulation Period chapter nine is the fifth and sixth trumpets and one was already passed backs Tribulation Period church they say ministry gotta make this as simple as ABC always believed Christ amen by the video revelation is simple when you sit down and pray and ask god and church I feel like people get or what are those books up there's like books that give like uh a short condensed that I would say that yeah what is it cliff notes a guy like that it's like we have a cliff notes of the whole Bible footnotes or shorter versions where you can look up and find with those stories really about another word find all the answers tell about the books actually about its kind of you have an answering book to all these things it's like we think there's a test out on the earth and God gave us the answer key to the test all you have to do is type in miles and go see what brother grant bond about it we got the answer book there's no excuse for us we can just type in first seal and see what the first feel is as though save the Lord glory oh yeah cuz that's all we have to do with all these trumpets and vials and things just type it in and go see what he said God he was the ants with there's no way we can there's no way we can fail the test for the bank but they then there's no way we could fail cuz we got the answer key Amen honey we won't fail holiday will overcome in Jesus Christ's name hallelujah just like the one behind the curtain in this great job we know the one he wrote to play and we know all the parts holiday via now chapter 10 chapter 10 I you just said verses 1 through San Lorenzo is history so that happen during the Gentile Church age they have been to 1963 its history that right amen chapter 11 is the two prophets of Israel the tribulation and the seventh trumpet and the second was passed that's the tribulation chapter 12 Israel and the woman and the third whoa that's Tribulation Period chapter 13 is the mark of the beast and the mark laid down now part of that is Gentile right because I just read it this morning by the radisson revelation 13 16 he says he was for the bride right they're going to try to persecute it's not the ride from pray she right that's what he said this morning was on that right he said the spirit of you side won't that swear to God wrote that praise God and revelation 13 is USA right so part of that deals with the church age and then part of that deals with the Tribulation Period when they actually set it down and kill anyone that would not take the mark so that's a little bit of mystery in there right there's hiding in there must a few scriptures about the bride how shall overcome the Beast by the new you now verse 14 chapter 14 has the lamb with 144,000 beautiful man of an angel with the everlasting gospel and the thrusting it of the sickle so there's part of the church age in there because they preach the everlasting gospel I think that's one more call they give before the tribulation but the thrusting of the signal that's Israel being harvested us that's the last time the sickles going horn to harvest hungerford 4,000 all the destruction comes for a chapter 15 the seven last plagues in seven vials that's tribulation chapter 16 the pouring out of the seven vials tribulation chapter 17 gives the description the Catholic Church and the mother heart I'm over my time I'm trying to finish sure some part of that a search eh but part of that is tribulation as well because it talks about the Kings all giving power to the woman during the Tribulation Period and all these all the wars they make it all these things like that chapter 18 there's a short version at the beginning where there's a calling out of the brides that come out of her my people being out our takers of her sins and legs so part of chapter 18 there's still some of the bride calling the Rio denominationalism aren't you glad he called out amen but the rest of that deals the tribulation of the destruction the mother harder chapter 19 we finally get to the bride again in here the bride comes back with Christ and arm again ha ha ha chapter 20 shows the bride in the millennium we preach on that to Sunday's going two resurrections on Sunday night they are given judgment during the Millennium and they're giving judgment at the white throne judgment and the white throne judgment is taught in Revelation chapter 20 that's all after the rapture chapter 21 the holy city we saw this morning about Zion our showdown our location of our showdown tonight comes down and its description is given a revelation chapter 21 in chapter 22 to send our feet we have the description of the holy city and the invitation of the sphere and ride telling us to come and we have Jesus reassuring us he comes quickly now in that short little 10 minutes I went how many would say the book of Revelation seems pretty simple now I would say is that I brother I'm gonna preach of aeschylus Lord really brother I were talking and he said there's all these you were talking on a bio setting there's all these symbols of the Bible and I said that's right but I said with it I said told the brother said the Bible interprets itself every symbol in the Bible that the Bible will tell what that symbol means everyone starting which are making a list I'm going to preach it for you brother so we can see it because guys give us an answer key he saw what the symbols mean we just gotta be patient enough and wait upon the Lord and he'll bring it to us you measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not you own the wine praise god bro just watch your head with that scripture i am at that scripture because Satan cannot touch us when we go into God's presence with the oil the Holy Ghost and the wine vestibular Revelation Jesus told him you can't touch for the a men's prayer life haha hey man you can't touch brother bags revelations that right he said touch not sister Wendy's oil and wine he with me church boy so when we choose to get back in that presence that oil life saved and cannot do nothing to us will conquer every demon every day of hell is under our feet will prevail over the gates of hell hey man because jesus said you cannot touch that devil don't touch their revelation and don't touch their baptism of the Holy Ghost and he can't he get in my soul cuz he sealed out the Bible says I Olivia and to get into my soul forever got to be a brother and come in but he can't do that because he's a deceiver he's not a brother and he's ordained to destruction so you are safely protected by the oil and the wine let's give the Lord rattleballs get you the authority over Satan how do you believe that hallelujah praise now let's bow our heads here thank you Jesus father God thank you for this book of Revelation lord I just I think about your grace in my life all those years 18 19 years actually when I'm ready to see the message i was twenty-one
