[36:28] in Jesus Christ
[36:29] a man able to say your vows this morning
[36:32] by God's grace sold up to Revelation
[36:37] chapter 2 let's look at the liar tear in
[36:41] church age part 3 this morning even
[36:43] looking at that I've been tying in
[36:45] different thoughts you know those as
[36:47] movie streaming and what presence you
[36:50] know from tiny different thoughts in
[36:51] Wednesday then listen that watch it what
[36:54] other night bring you the chance of this
[36:55] with that by God's grace I think of your
[36:57] vessels art last Sunday night was Daniel
[37:02] chapter age of your inner prophetic
[37:04] things which divide off to be the Holy
[37:06] Spirit or tells us things group to look
[37:09] forward to go to that one needs and
[37:12] Persia and also the four beasts and so
[37:14] for like that I know you be blessed
[37:15] tonight we're looking at Daniel chapter
[37:17] 9 Daniel 70 weeks so revisit that
[37:20] tonight by the grace of the Lord how
[37:22] many think we're the Word of God a man
[37:24] raised a little very thankful I
[37:26] experienced Revelation chapter 2 this
[37:35] morning I've also read another portion
[37:36] of text I just want to read a couple
[37:39] scriptures you're going to tie it in
[37:40] with judgment must begin at
[37:42] house of God men of the tight end with
[37:44] that because that's where the Prophet
[37:46] takes it is the fires here in church age
[37:50] let's look to starts at verse 18 where
[37:54] you noted that especially the song
[38:13] specials in it let's just reverse 19 and
[38:18] 22 verses there Halloween I know that
[38:26] works and charity and service and faith
[38:29] and thy patience and thy work and the
[38:35] last be more than the first last time
[38:37] you preached on this we closed without a
[38:39] Christian increases their service to God
[38:42] when times get hard
[38:43] they don't decrease it they increase
[38:45] above that's what Jesus recognized we
[38:48] will be scared perchik we're just money
[38:50] notwithstanding evidence against thee
[38:53] because thou sufferest that woman
[38:55] Jezebel which calleth herself a
[38:57] prophetess she said she'll give to teach
[39:01] and to seduce my servants to commit
[39:04] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[39:08] that's right if you went to first Peter
[39:10] chapter verse 16 pray our expectation
[39:28] for today so we're going to see what the
[39:29] Holy Spirit is first beer for see if any
[39:35] man suffer as a Christian let him not be
[39:38] ashamed but let him glory glorify God on
[39:41] this behalf when you suffer doing the
[39:44] right thing verse 17 for the time has
[39:47] come that a judgment must begin at the
[39:50] house of God first begin at us what
[39:54] should be the end of them
[39:56] that obey not the gospel you know I
[39:58] never study what brother Ram said about
[40:00] that scripture till this morning I'm
[40:02] going to bring that thought I thought I
[40:03] was gonna preach Daniel 70 weeks this
[40:05] morning but the Holy Spirit James my
[40:06] thought for this movie so entrusting to
[40:09] be the will of God I was 18 and if the
[40:12] righteous air city say never I'm going
[40:15] to preach on that last year who is
[40:16] righteous locked no other they were too
[40:20] scarcely say I'm right if the righteous
[40:25] scarcity saves so they're talking about
[40:26] the Buddhist version where Sheila
[40:29] ungodly and the sinner of fear ungodly
[40:32] or those who sell out to make believers
[40:33] center would be someone never did
[40:35] believe like fair Wow
[40:37] verse 19 what air war let them that
[40:40] suffer according to the will of God
[40:42] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[40:45] in well-doing
[40:46] as into a personal trainer so there you
[40:49] see the context of this you're in the
[40:51] midst of being a Christian and you're
[40:53] suffering for doing right and when you
[40:55] suffer for doing right so remember
[40:57] judgment begins with the house of God
[40:59] and take courage because the Bible says
[41:02] you committed our souls in the Christ
[41:05] let's have one more end every not your
[41:07] mother's make another $2 we pray don't
[41:10] your habits you see how hearts that
[41:12] might not be doing anyone arms right
[41:15] here this world I teach and every
[41:19] believer Lord into more truth that's one
[41:21] evidences someone's born again guided
[41:23] into a deeper truth or they're able to
[41:27] be taught the Word of God by the Holy
[41:29] Spirit through the fivefold ministry
[41:31] which is the Holy Ghost Channel and
[41:33] dress wear for this hour thank you Lord
[41:36] for the promises in your word help us be
[41:38] faithful as I've said Lord I'm expecting
[41:40] you going to pray for this moment

[41:45] hitch every heart of the soul Lord may

[42:50] the Holy Spirit as a preacher anyone
[42:52] with the gift knows when you have such a
[42:53] burden get away from it that's the
[42:56] leadership of the Holy Spirit and so

[42:59] the Lord I happened when I was there
[43:04] when I'm and last time I had such a
[43:05] burden two freaks that a message Oh

[43:46] age book to charge will begin to the
[43:47] house of God that's where it will end up
[43:49] this morning so we're going to start off
[43:51] with just a fling quotes from the church
[43:52] all know as I said I listen read through
[43:55] both the church age both piratey run and
[43:57] listen to the whole sermon back to your
[43:58] church age nineteen sixty and I'm trying
[44:00] to blend life feel the most important
[44:03] things for our assembly is brother BAM
[44:04] said you can't preach all of it he said
[44:06] if you get a fifty sermons on a blunt
[44:07] shortage and so all you have to do is
[44:10] hit the highlights and that's God
[44:12] with us late so I'm doing the same thing
[44:15] I'm trying to hit the highlights I'm
[44:16] preaching like five or seven sermons on
[44:18] each Church age by God's very so thank
[44:21] the Lord for that and let's look at this
[44:24] here enough fire to the church range was
[44:31] six oh six to fifteen to twenty the
[44:33] messenger was Columba now one thing
[44:35] that's interesting about this age
[44:36] brother Graham was the Holy Spirit to
[44:38] choose Kalama he actually died ten years
[44:41] before the age started remember he said
[44:43] the Holy Spirit showed him before his
[44:47] messenger it was and so forth
[44:50] as we study history what's the part one
[44:52] his ministry was so powerful Columbia he
[44:56] was such a visionary so many signs
[44:58] wonders and miracles he would get twelve
[45:00] men the Holy Ghost twelve men and women
[45:04] and he would move into a land nearby
[45:06] other places and start a city and they
[45:09] would pray and seek God and so people
[45:11] would come to the city and feel the
[45:12] presence of got to get saved that was
[45:14] his way to missionary are to evangelize
[45:16] Scotland the whole nation of Scotland
[45:18] what a man of God amen
[45:20] so what I'm saying is that even though
[45:22] he died there ten years before his
[45:23] imprint upon the age was undeniable even
[45:27] arty turned an entire nation Scotland to
[45:30] Christianity
[45:31] kind of like st. Patrick did with
[45:34] Ireland I mean they led by God's grace
[45:37] Marty what a man of God is is thankful
[45:40] what a testimony that it is man so
[45:43] that's Columba and so we're looking at
[45:44] this whole church age Jesus is speaking
[45:46] to this whole church age remember as it
[45:49] got darker brother have said this was
[45:50] the darkest age it wasn't the most
[45:53] deceptive age that's our day well that
[45:56] makes a difference between dark and
[45:58] deception right but mansard is more dark
[46:00] because of the persecution the physical
[46:02] death upon the people and the corruption
[46:05] in the church was at an all-time high
[46:07] now we are in the most deceptive age
[46:10] remember preach God is evil age and said
[46:13] people think they're worse than Jesus
[46:14] Christ and they're actually worshipping
[46:16] Satan because they're worshipping
[46:18] bichri's in vain do they worship Him
[46:20] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[46:22] of men
[46:23] that's right but we all need to be on
[46:25] our toes it's right now that's right
[46:27] that's exactly right
[46:29] you must get our toes right now is this
[46:31] the age of deception not so much dark
[46:34] persecution because that was the dark
[46:36] ages death so I had a black horse rider
[46:39] death now the Prophet says now he's
[46:42] already said this agents called the
[46:44] darkest days because it was indeed the
[46:46] darkest period of all history was the
[46:48] age of Pope Innocent a third who claimed
[46:50] that he was the Vicar of Christ supreme
[46:53] sovereign over the church in the world
[46:54] who instituted that Inquisition which
[46:57] under his direction shed more blood than
[46:59] at any other time except the Reformation
[47:01] it was the age of or not her seat the
[47:04] rule of harlots that's somehow surgery
[47:09] is the third had a mistress and a fill
[47:11] the papal choir and paramours and
[47:14] bastard sons and returned the apple
[47:17] palace into demócratas
[47:19] anastasius the third was smothered by
[47:21] death or to death by mono Co who is the
[47:24] mistress to Sark sarah dias sorry jumped
[47:27] up singing
[47:28] Jonathan eleven was Mara zoa's
[47:30] illegitimate son Jonathan 12 was the
[47:33] grandson of Arizona and he violated
[47:36] widows emergen was killed while the act
[47:38] of adultery by the woman's enrage
[47:40] husband this is the condition the church
[47:41] was in now not the true church the false
[47:43] Church the true church will never be a
[47:46] neck addition Clemenza the Holy Ghost
[47:48] Wakeeney from adultery
[47:49] that's why is there to come for me amen
[47:52] exactly right
[47:53] look at this false church it was the age
[47:55] of papal schism part two lines opposed
[47:58] one ruling from having epic nun and the
[48:00] other Rome cursed and bought each other
[48:03] these Pope's were not only guilty of
[48:05] immoral sex acts father sort of
[48:07] illegitimate children committing sodomy
[48:08] etc but were guilty of selling priestly
[48:11] offices to the highest bidders it was
[48:16] the age when the light glowed ever so
[48:18] faintly yet the few believers labored
[48:20] more fervently and that's what Jesus
[48:23] said you got works you've got faith
[48:25] you've got love and you got works and
[48:27] the last are more than the first holiday
[48:31] and Jesus recognized even though it's
[48:33] the darkest hour you're so
[48:35] me with more service now that he did the
[48:37] beginning right he said on this a
[48:40] darkness increased up toward the end eh
[48:43] penny arose attempting reforms their
[48:45] Labor's were so further that they paved
[48:47] the way for our company Reformation
[48:49] therefore as the word says the sign that
[48:51] HR last end of the age works are more
[48:54] than new curse amen what a powerful
[48:57] testimony in the darkest H Christ got
[48:59] the most about a service see that's the
[49:02] anointing of the Holy special anointing
[49:04] will do the anointing will rise above
[49:06] when the enemy comes in like a flood it
[49:08] raises the standard against that
[49:09] anointing it's exactly right because
[49:12] it's a more powerful anointing the word
[49:15] guy or tear has various meanings one is
[49:17] continual sacrifice now it's interesting
[49:19] though Graham says it means continual
[49:21] sacrifice and then another time he says
[49:23] a dominating female which we get to that
[49:25] I'll kind of state that portion for
[49:27] later when you preach as well yeah so it
[49:30] must have various mean by many this is
[49:33] believed to be a prophecy concerning the
[49:34] use of the mass which is a continual
[49:36] presentation the sacrifice of Christ
[49:39] that is an excellent thought but it also
[49:41] might mean the continual sacrifice in
[49:43] lives and labors of the true believers
[49:45] of the Lord look at this next time
[49:48] surely these daughters your Saints were
[49:51] the cream of the crop right full of the
[49:55] Holy Ghost and faith created other good
[49:57] works showing board this praise holding
[50:00] not their lives here unto themselves but
[50:03] gladly giving their all as a sweet
[50:06] sacrifice unto the Lord you want to be
[50:09] cream of the crop of the latest in
[50:10] church age give yourself as a full
[50:12] sacrifice of attraction don't hold
[50:14] anything back give all you have to Jesus
[50:16] he's going to have a crop Weiner tears
[50:18] for Henry it's going to have a crowd and
[50:21] we want to be the wheat that it brings
[50:22] forth a hundredfold a net Lord now we
[50:26] get to the review here here's the review
[50:27] which I want to as I said brother man
[50:29] brings his thought of Jesus trying the
[50:31] reins of the heart and then brings it to
[50:34] judgment we can get into the house of
[50:35] God so I want to revisit that the last
[50:37] few four or five sermons I've been
[50:39] dealing a lot with the home church
[50:40] because we've all here laughing last
[50:42] year and be honest I'm pretty hurt
[50:45] sometimes you know I've gone through
[50:46] that
[50:47] and like my bear said about brother
[50:48] devil the pastor don't always tell you
[50:50] what's going on behind scenes right and
[50:53] so I just had to felt that like I got to
[50:55] deal with that I got a preset I've got
[50:57] to get that off my heart that's the same
[50:59] thing brother Brandon my brother branham
[51:00] was going to quit preaching in 1961 he
[51:03] shared with the people and that
[51:05] afterwards one of the men repented the
[51:07] men were saying oh we believed your
[51:09] Jesus Christ remember that in 1961 and
[51:11] buh-bam said those men are sitting right
[51:13] in the congregation today he said they
[51:15] said I they believed every word I said
[51:17] but and didn't believe every word I said
[51:20] so see he had done things that were on
[51:22] his heart can't really get to remember
[51:24] when we preach on a critical spirit
[51:25] brother Branham tells the congregation
[51:28] before he preaches he said I've got a
[51:29] critical spirit I haven't got rid of it
[51:32] but pray for me now get rid of it as I
[51:34] preach so preacher many times cannot be
[51:37] separated from the trials and sufferings
[51:39] of that he's going through he's just got
[51:40] a brief child word anyway and you know
[51:43] that too sometimes with the midst of a
[51:44] trial you can't really separate yourself
[51:47] in the trial then you can from the reg
[51:48] your life but what do you do you press
[51:50] clear up your best foot forward on the
[51:52] word of God and you serve God the best
[51:54] you can occupy so the rebuke is in verse
[52:00] 22 read that fro text program said one
[52:03] church was tolerating Jezebel one church
[52:06] would allow it will just allow this
[52:07] woman to it
[52:08] I don't rule over the church and another
[52:10] church was not even the false church was
[52:14] allowing I wanted to rule over them the
[52:16] true church was not allowed in a woman
[52:18] to rule over them the program takes his
[52:21] side here's what he says now with this
[52:22] first I want you to drop down to the
[52:25] 23rd and see the proof of a picture I've
[52:27] been bringing your attention on Bob that
[52:29] will kill her children with death and
[52:30] all the churches that was the thought
[52:32] right here churches shall know that I he
[52:36] would serve the reigns of the hearts
[52:39] so remember says I just been saying
[52:41] right along that there are actually two
[52:43] churches though the spirit speaks to
[52:46] both of them at each age as though they
[52:48] were but one here it is plainly stated
[52:51] that there are the churches and it
[52:53] states just as plainly that some of
[52:55] those churches
[52:57] evidently do not know that he is the one
[52:59] who searches the reigns and the hearts
[53:03] he's going to prove that this so so
[53:08] let's get the picture around six oh six
[53:09] or you can fast-forward to nine
[53:11] something AD 980 the false church was
[53:16] not convinced that God hears the secrets
[53:18] of their heart they thought they could
[53:20] go to church and like those Pope's and
[53:23] things do awful things and get away with
[53:26] sin everyone said their own work showed
[53:29] they didn't believe that God searched
[53:32] their hearts all the time never read
[53:34] that because if there's a leave that
[53:35] they would have been pissed away you see
[53:38] how important is for you to know when
[53:40] the Holy Spirit is searching your heart
[53:42] anything under that and that's why every
[53:45] service is so important that's what
[53:47] shows the diagram gives a quote he talks
[53:49] about a family said God will heal the
[53:50] baby he said but then he said they'll
[53:53] get a little more money he said pretty
[53:55] soon he said pretty soon so get a better
[53:58] car a better home and then all he says
[54:00] he'll they won't go to church anymore he
[54:02] said him pretty soon he said the get
[54:05] away from the Spirit of God and he said
[54:07] we must constantly say where the Spirit
[54:10] of God is being poured out day and night
[54:11] data and and he gotta give you saya as
[54:15] the example he got lifted up for out
[54:17] look I've got a little more money and in
[54:19] America of all places Church you and I I
[54:22] myself we've all got to be careful not
[54:24] to let the riches and cares of this
[54:26] world distract us from serving Christ
[54:29] you must stay where the Spirit of God is
[54:31] being poured out again if our Maps
[54:35] you'll get like use I'd Sara I don't
[54:36] care what the light says God blessed me
[54:38] look how much I've done in my life I can
[54:40] do whatever I want and go outside the
[54:43] word but every any believer any true
[54:45] believer knows that God searches our
[54:47] artena he knows what's in our hearts and
[54:50] we must not hide anything we must offer
[54:52] it to hitting them and because that's
[54:54] how I wrong
[54:56] so he greens Astana there's two churches
[54:59] what actually believes God serves their
[55:01] heart the other one actually thinks they
[55:03] can hide something from God how many
[55:07] know you can't hide anything little and
[55:08] I mean oh you make a mistake it's going
[55:11] to show up you're going to pay for I
[55:12] don't know to make a mistake father's
[55:15] going to spank you all right exactly
[55:18] right okay I said now then what churches
[55:22] will be those that do not know this
[55:24] truth what is true that that God is
[55:26] loser to the great part of course it's
[55:29] the fall fine because the true believers
[55:32] certainly know that judgment begins at
[55:34] the house of God and they've been
[55:38] god-fearing judge themselves that they
[55:41] be not judged remember the words of our
[55:43] Lord Jesus said judge yourselves that
[55:46] should be not judged praised or so I
[55:49] wanted to give this thought and this
[55:50] morning I was coming to cross this I was
[55:51] going to preachers to the human service
[55:53] and I thought my I've never studied what
[55:55] mother have said about judgment begins
[55:57] at the house of God so I went to did it
[55:59] and thankfully is a real short search it
[56:00] was one of those thousand and five
[56:02] hundred is actually like 26 I believe
[56:04] I'm not mistaken well or I can't that
[56:07] nothin wake it up in the morning I can
[56:08] do that so this is a good judgment
[56:10] muster so how is your Bible because the
[56:13] true Church of God is here and knew that
[56:15] God is going to start judging everybody
[56:17] right here for Akron Ohio in 2017 gums
[56:21] up or how many years we have in Akron
[56:24] Ohio when God judges the Laodicean
[56:26] Church age I'll say by this as you fast
[56:28] forward the white throne judgment when
[56:30] God always put the latest in church eggs
[56:32] for our generation we're going to stand
[56:34] there and God is going to begin by
[56:36] judging at the house of God in other
[56:38] words judgment will go forth from Most
[56:40] Holy Ghost built saints that are
[56:42] seasoning on the throne with Jesus
[56:43] himself judgment will begin at the house
[56:46] of God amen
[56:47] those who lives true in every hour will
[56:50] stand there as witnesses that the Word
[56:52] of God could be live that the Word of
[56:55] God was true amen and then it will never
[56:57] fail other than God
[56:59] and Jesus said I'll even raise up people
[57:00] from past generation if I can't find
[57:03] somebody to accuse them in this
[57:04] generation maybe with you know award a
[57:06] second life in their generation jesus
[57:08] said I'll race up the queen of sheet
[57:10] Lena and she'll come and she'll give a
[57:13] judgment against these Pharisees because
[57:15] a greater than Solomon is here amen let
[57:17] me say with all due respect me over the
[57:19] red but a greater than brother Brandon
[57:21] is here it is the Holy Ghost amen
[57:23] all due respect we never say that any
[57:26] like it at all
[57:26] we have to recognize that although
[57:28] probably leaves the scene God is still
[57:30] here
[57:31] in fact brother and use that and if
[57:33] God's with us where he's the miracles at
[57:35] the end of 1961 perhaps it did you
[57:37] notice
[57:38] Gideon after the mini Knights came in
[57:40] remember that story for the random set
[57:43] of provocated idioms and he left the
[57:45] scene about manager said see how God
[57:47] does it after the Prophet leaves all
[57:49] this left is the angel the Lord and
[57:51] that's how God wanted an Indian's day
[57:53] God's going to be angel the Lord the
[57:56] Holy Spirit ministering the Prophet left
[57:58] the scene a telephonic brush that's gone
[58:00] here to the Holy Spirit a Safian Church
[58:04] like I've had friends and and know you
[58:08] years ago I used to carpool to work and
[58:10] with three other women you know that
[58:12] they are all there the damage done
[58:14] within a few years and so we just start
[58:16] fold you know we were short on money and
[58:18] you know I just carpool and I see
[58:21] nothing wrong with that as far as to
[58:22] know that but let's not be as some of
[58:25] them you know shirt certainly appreciate
[58:27] those people but as we were talking to
[58:30] the car they would say you know in our
[58:31] church all they preach on there's a
[58:32] table in the Sun never free time the
[58:34] Holy Ghost I was like yes but at that
[58:38] time I just started preaching those two
[58:39] thousand four so I'm preaching in 2004
[58:41] January 2004 and that was you know later
[58:44] on that far I believe I'm not mistaken
[58:46] at the end of 2004 I just got ordained
[58:48] to preach you know in August of 2010
[58:49] against my brother Brooks you know and
[58:52] uh and I was so came up and I said
[58:54] that's where our church is all about the
[58:56] Holy Spirit you know I was trying to be
[58:58] aligning you know that we need more of
[58:59] the Holy Spirit but George if the Holy
[59:01] Spirit is going to bring the bride to a
[59:03] wrap
[59:03] up side up you know a physical body of
[59:06] Christ or brother branham physically
[59:08] being here we better have a good
[59:10] relationship with the Holy Ghost we
[59:12] better start getting more in tune what
[59:14] is the Holy Spirit trying to show me
[59:16] what is his voice saying today let us
[59:18] have ears to hear what the spirit can
[59:21] say to this church amen
[59:22] a good thing we better be we better know
[59:25] the leadership of the Holy Spirit brings
[59:27] God because that's what we're going to
[59:29] have to have hallelujah from the spirit
[59:32] and the bride say come on now I'm just
[59:36] going to go through the quotes like I
[59:37] said there was something didn't apply to
[59:38] it when a man is what's going it again
[59:41] I'm not emotion worked up not some
[59:42] enthusiasm not by putting his name on a
[59:45] church but not by joining the biggest
[59:46] church in the city but when he's
[59:48] actually cried through you've heard
[59:50] about breakthrough but the band also
[59:52] uses crying through then oh yeah seek as
[59:56] you died when the man's actually cried
[59:58] through his beg with tears in his eyes
[1:00:01] until God has forgiven his sins cleanse
[1:00:03] his soul from a life of sin and filled
[1:00:05] with the Holy Spirit with such love and
[1:00:07] godly till he takes the old tool tires
[1:00:10] back he stole from the neighbors it goes
[1:00:15] and makes up to these things and live
[1:00:17] godly before men will never have a
[1:00:19] revival til we have that what is that
[1:00:23] you see what he got saved under
[1:00:24] justification he went and paid back all
[1:00:26] the people he stole from and this is the
[1:00:28] burden you know of the church people get
[1:00:33] baptized but the problem is they never
[1:00:34] repented before they got baptized
[1:00:37] praise God they wonder why there's no
[1:00:39] power in their lives or no Holy Spirit
[1:00:42] leadership or don't deserve it or no
[1:00:43] correction or no gifts or no power
[1:00:45] anything like that well my question is
[1:00:48] have they done works meet for repentance
[1:00:51] have they really repented like brother
[1:00:53] Graham said if they cry through a bit
[1:00:55] big as a blue hoot and they prayed
[1:00:57] through have they done these things
[1:00:59] Church we must pay the same price as all
[1:01:02] the other ones painting there's not two
[1:01:05] ace against all he goes there's one way
[1:01:06] to get to all the ghosts and that's died
[1:01:08] be born again
[1:01:10] dynamique wicked they met so see what
[1:01:12] he's saying I get to the house of God
[1:01:15] judgment begin to the house of God by
[1:01:17] the word of God amen not a textbook with
[1:01:19] the Bible not about some Church teaches
[1:01:22] in their theology but what God says then
[1:01:24] you'll have a revival where great hours
[1:01:26] and wonders and signs and miracles and
[1:01:27] everything else will take place I
[1:01:29] wouldn't do that like I was really sorry
[1:01:41] you
[1:01:46] so I just like to preach the way and I
[1:01:49] just feel like to preach that's the way
[1:01:51] I see it and then this time speaking
[1:01:55] especially on this real tough or cutting
[1:01:59] part of the gospel not just up on that a
[1:02:02] minute God's will mean flow this way
[1:02:04] gospel means good news so go down so
[1:02:07] there's a hard rough cutting part two
[1:02:10] good news
[1:02:11] I believe that yeah it doesn't feel good
[1:02:15] like like a good wine right taste in the
[1:02:18] mouth which is bitter the some of the
[1:02:19] book tastes good the mouth but it's
[1:02:21] better in the belly
[1:02:22] so there's parts of the good news that
[1:02:25] are hard for what your flesh and sinful
[1:02:27] nature exactly writing this will program
[1:02:31] said but you know this is a house of
[1:02:33] judgment because judgment begins that
[1:02:35] we're all sewed up here's where judgment
[1:02:38] begins and what is judgey tells us the
[1:02:41] evil sphere or God sphere that's judging
[1:02:44] judging is another word for discernment
[1:02:47] I'm understand net judgment or
[1:02:49] discernment against now cigar so the
[1:02:51] house of God should have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:53] flowing through it
[1:02:54] so we've usually this is a second but
[1:02:56] this is a god other Turks if we went
[1:03:01] there to course and you would have a
[1:03:02] trial they got a book of all their they
[1:03:04] have to read this to find out what
[1:03:05] you're judged for and that's the way it
[1:03:07] is in the house of God we've got to take
[1:03:09] it from the Word of God coming up on
[1:03:12] that Smith rock and they need of
[1:03:13] anything they might derive after that
[1:03:15] the blessing and things they still
[1:03:16] member I'm going to bring us on now
[1:03:18] brother random surprisingly
[1:03:20] ibuffer Timmy's pricey Denis he brings
[1:03:23] up Kadesh Barnea about ten times with
[1:03:26] judgment begins at the house of God and
[1:03:28] brother brand lightens kadish Barnea to
[1:03:31] every home Church the church said Amen
[1:03:36] other day I never do that so I thought I
[1:03:39] was so burden strike the mic I've never
[1:03:41] heard this breach man listen to it but I
[1:03:43] missed it he said they come to the place
[1:03:46] called Katie's party I'm sorry they got
[1:03:48] a blessing thing but they still murmured
[1:03:50] or complain they come to the place
[1:03:52] called Kadesh Barnea i'm
[1:03:54] this for a minute hey this Bernie was a
[1:03:56] judgment seeing the world of that day
[1:03:57] that's fine that's mounted 13 checker
[1:03:59] now numbers hey go to the market the
[1:04:02] scriptures if you wish now in there was

[1:04:09] high places milan three or four days
[1:04:10] your bible can't study at first by burst
[1:04:12] but here's what he said but it wasn't
[1:04:15] judgment seat there was a great well

[1:04:35] perfect type of the church Lord the
[1:04:40] church is the jug you see judgment
[1:04:43] begins at the house of God okay I never
[1:04:47] do this often today hey this bar here
[1:04:49] was ones the judgments of the world
[1:04:50] there's many great spring and the many
[1:04:52] little Springs late lead off from it
[1:04:54] which is a perfect type again Christ the
[1:04:58] big spring the church the little spring
[1:05:01] up from Christ the judgment seat
[1:05:03] judgment begins to the house of God
[1:05:05] here's where we are judged
[1:05:08] how many Bobbie like that there's one
[1:05:11] great as well in canis and that's night

[1:05:29] River there because we're so smart
[1:05:31] we're in the venerian and that's okay I
[1:05:34] like to work anywhere our Jesus calls me
[1:05:37] and I didn't have to come back I didn't
[1:05:39] ask for the message God gave it to me no
[1:05:41] I totally accurate I just must be
[1:05:43] faithful my toasted indeed I didn't ask
[1:05:46] to get rich I never thought I'd be a
[1:05:47] preacher Amen God help me to this place
[1:05:50] here's where we are judged
[1:05:52] isn't it a pity when we see what we're
[1:05:54] wrong and doing the wrong thing living
[1:05:57] the wrong life associating wrong
[1:05:58] everything and we're just not big enough
[1:06:00] to walk up and say God I'm sorry
[1:06:03] I know one's wrong
[1:06:06] you're right not wrong you forgive me
[1:06:08] help me to do better the next time too
[1:06:09] sorry for Christians he's talking about
[1:06:11] the church
[1:06:12] it's Kadesh Barnea everybody see that
[1:06:14] and we're not big enough to walk of the
[1:06:16] same God he said if we just that that
[1:06:21] real about ourselves but we don't hear
[1:06:23] the gospel freaks and say oh well I
[1:06:25] don't believe it that way as a preacher
[1:06:29] that's hard I preached over the last few
[1:06:31] years of labor in the people's life I'm
[1:06:33] invested borne people's lives last years
[1:06:35] I never had it into the life told in the
[1:06:38] exact truth told them exactly what the
[1:06:40] Word of God is and so I can go somewhere
[1:06:42] else ready to go to church I can do
[1:06:43] whatever I want
[1:06:44] that's not what a real Christian does a
[1:06:47] real Christian recognizes the house of
[1:06:50] God is the courtroom we met it is the
[1:06:53] courtroom of God
[1:06:54] you go there to hear that your sins are
[1:06:56] forgiven not just was but you must keep
[1:06:59] walking in the line as he's in the line
[1:07:01] a better Church if you're honest
[1:07:03] sometimes you come to church condemned
[1:07:05] don't you buy diffic or I did that first
[1:07:08] wrong in that deal yesterday I did that
[1:07:09] wrong and you don't you don't mean to be
[1:07:12] but you come to church condemned that's
[1:07:13] a day where you've got to look at the
[1:07:15] judge that just says you're forgiven you
[1:07:18] confess it all the guilt has passed away
[1:07:20] from you a many that's why you need
[1:07:22] because something like you come you feel
[1:07:24] like you're the guilty one but Jesus say
[1:07:26] my blood can reach to the highest
[1:07:28] mountain and the lowest I'll be a penny
[1:07:30] it can reach down to the lowest estate
[1:07:33] if you feel guilty or if you are guilty
[1:07:35] the photo price is there to set you free
[1:07:37] amen
[1:07:38] the only must confess and say Lord
[1:07:41] hoping to be hung enough to admit I was
[1:07:42] wrong again but you don't find that much
[1:07:46] you find a lot of pride like Israel had
[1:07:48] a case money oh we can go get the land
[1:07:50] of us mm you know after we go - Michaela
[1:07:52] come back they denied it we can go up
[1:07:54] there they're all prideful help us to be
[1:07:57] humble
[1:07:58] necessary man after we have knowledge of
[1:08:01] the truth Lord what we ought to do and
[1:08:03] then we won't do it we can't go no
[1:08:06] farther with God until we do it see God
[1:08:13] just presents something to us that we
[1:08:14] should stop this type of life we should
[1:08:17] quit letting for the world and
[1:08:18] professionally Christian
[1:08:19] these people already professional be
[1:08:20] Christians and will continue right on
[1:08:22] the same thing then we can't go no
[1:08:24] farther with God I'm gonna go farther
[1:08:26] with God amen ever felt like you hit a
[1:08:29] wall in god well there must be something
[1:08:31] laying there there must be a must be
[1:08:34] okay - right
[1:08:35] they got the K - and they couldn't go
[1:08:37] any further until they address the issue
[1:08:39] let me understand that by God's grace
[1:08:41] they had to dress this issue can we
[1:08:43] possess it or not - we believe guy was
[1:08:46] able to take us to the lantern up we
[1:08:48] they had to trust that issue they
[1:08:49] weren't going any further and got it
[1:08:50] back they went backwards and around and
[1:08:53] around and around and never went forward
[1:08:55] into another generation rose up Church
[1:08:57] let's not put this off to another
[1:08:58] generation
[1:08:59] let's serve God with everything we have
[1:09:00] right now if you don't you'll regret
[1:09:03] that's the program said it you don't get
[1:09:05] also Christ out you'll regret it over
[1:09:07] there he said you've got one life to
[1:09:08] live let's split it off for Christ write
[1:09:10] it down yeah exactly right right he said
[1:09:18] the place that's been done revealed to
[1:09:20] us so we got to stop right there until
[1:09:22] we make that thing right and then go on
[1:09:24] with God for that is when we're back in
[1:09:26] the gray see I told the story my dad
[1:09:28] he's the 1983 these top we would almost
[1:09:30] got he was going on with God moving on
[1:09:32] with God but 1983 tells you the story
[1:09:34] all the time almost every time I'm there
[1:09:35] he's telling this story so I know it's
[1:09:37] true
[1:09:37] he stopped praying the clause he stopped
[1:09:39] reading his Bible he said since then
[1:09:41] he's had nothing but trials for the last
[1:09:43] thirty years he imagined him he's 67
[1:09:45] he's 67 out of 30 years of his life
[1:09:49] taken away by the enemy because he will
[1:09:53] obey the Word of God and get right with
[1:09:54] the Word of God I look at that so I
[1:09:56] don't want to be like that I love him
[1:09:57] I'm trusting that I can pray them
[1:09:59] through like my dad said you pray for
[1:10:02] people and then you get Tel Aviv I'm
[1:10:03] Esther you can tell this he said I'm
[1:10:05] praying for you and you're going to go
[1:10:07] over all my prayers to God in order not
[1:10:09] to make it I'm an idiot all my friends
[1:10:13] are gone for God go from one pass all
[1:10:14] those predators in order not to make it
[1:10:17] so church we should believe that God
[1:10:18] will hear our prayer
[1:10:20] other nica's are from a pure sincere
[1:10:23] heart holiday we have tonight exactly
[1:10:25] right just wait on God remember patience
[1:10:27] let patience have a perfect work again
[1:10:30] and then you'll be perfect if you can
[1:10:32] just have patience saying that we'll see
[1:10:36] when we finally get to the spot where we
[1:10:38] can address whatever stopping us from
[1:10:40] moving on that's why we're back in
[1:10:42] Gracie get you man good
[1:10:43] that's why people feel like there's no
[1:10:45] more grace than that because they failed
[1:10:47] God it wasn't God it was them but once
[1:10:52] you address something went to address
[1:10:54] the kadish party of your life then you
[1:10:56] can move on in grace because the
[1:10:58] judgment of God boy judgment begins to
[1:11:01] the house of God the judgments of God
[1:11:02] are keeping you from moving on until you
[1:11:05] deal with it until you recognize it god
[1:11:07] help us to get back in grace again and
[1:11:09] move on with Christ amen
[1:11:11] yeah oh yeah right then we're back in
[1:11:14] Gracie see you got to have you got to
[1:11:17] have grace brothers hard being graced
[1:11:18] you got to have grace to forgive
[1:11:22] yourself
[1:11:22] you got a grace to forgive others or you
[1:11:24] are not walking in grace that's why
[1:11:26] people are condemned that if I'm the
[1:11:27] message because they let sins faster
[1:11:29] right now hold this against that hold
[1:11:31] that against that I have a secret thing
[1:11:33] in here like reset on the phones and and
[1:11:35] never games like that or this and we
[1:11:37] just family gets back this church
[1:11:39] against that church across the street
[1:11:40] that split up how is that possible it's
[1:11:43] because their only thing and the
[1:11:45] judgments of God remain upon them until
[1:11:47] they make it right then they're back in
[1:11:49] grace again I never said they were lost
[1:11:51] but in the current state where they are
[1:11:53] they're living in the judgments of God
[1:11:55] that's why they're convicted all the
[1:11:57] time that's why they make you like all
[1:11:58] the time but if you deal with it and
[1:12:00] confess it then you're walking in grace
[1:12:02] and lot of Jesus Christ again never
[1:12:04] understand that hey hey man I never do
[1:12:07] that to this money but heaven blueberry
[1:12:09] on the video then they're walking to
[1:12:12] Gracie in the beautiful type of KS
[1:12:14] cornea
[1:12:14] not glory they'll make a preacher happy
[1:12:18] to find something like that amen what a
[1:12:20] beautiful picture the church
[1:12:21] out on the desert everything had to come
[1:12:24] to K - to get water everything had to
[1:12:27] come to K - you get water therefore the
[1:12:29] one big strength but the other Springs
[1:12:30] that is a type of heaven that's a type
[1:12:33] of the judgment seat of God where that
[1:12:36] the judgment begins at the house of God
[1:12:37] and where this one great springfed and
[1:12:40] the other little springs run out from it
[1:12:42] means that heaven being the judgment
[1:12:45] seat of Christ and all the churches is
[1:12:47] giving life and the judgment seat
[1:12:49] wherever people comes to the church to
[1:12:52] be judged and the church said guess what
[1:12:55] if you come to Kay the church this is
[1:12:58] cater Sarnia preaching every one of us
[1:13:00] understand that but I said whatever
[1:13:02] church you go to the church is giving
[1:13:03] life the third preach is giving a slide
[1:13:06] if we receive it if not we can go on
[1:13:09] with God and the judges remain upon us
[1:13:11] and this human be building the shame and
[1:13:13] all these things because we want to
[1:13:15] dress something we must address it like
[1:13:17] hey - and move on in ox grace the other
[1:13:20] so hey - the one they found that are
[1:13:24] sprayed was a type of heaven glory and
[1:13:27] all these other streams and what else
[1:13:29] were types of little churches hallelujah
[1:13:34] the trouble is today people come to
[1:13:36] church and they're pat on the back and
[1:13:39] the thing is because they pay it on the
[1:13:41] collection plate because they become a
[1:13:42] deacon because it becomes something else
[1:13:44] in the church rather or can drive up in
[1:13:46] a better car or can wear better clothes
[1:13:49] or something like that you're respected
[1:13:52] and you're patted on the back rather
[1:13:55] what we did need today is some old
[1:13:57] fashioned preachers who call black black
[1:13:59] and white white like John the Baptist
[1:14:01] Laurie no matter how much you pay how
[1:14:05] much you don't pay god is romeo stay
[1:14:07] here we don't pet anybody on the back we
[1:14:09] look for the leadership of the holy
[1:14:10] spirit brother
[1:14:13] there's only one way to get to happen
[1:14:14] that's what the Christ Jesus being born
[1:14:16] again by the Holy Spirit set the baby
[1:14:17] born again I don't know why is there the
[1:14:19] kingdom said our Lord Jesus Christ what
[1:14:21] is it what it is I'm living it might
[1:14:24] change what a shaky guys always kind of
[1:14:26] haters Church god I'm always I don't say
[1:14:29] they'll all come to grammar school it'll
[1:14:31] see
[1:14:31] on the street I don't say though go to
[1:14:33] the Christian Church or whatever I say
[1:14:35] that God in every Church has dismembered
[1:14:39] a man I'm gonna say it again God in
[1:14:42] every Church has its member take a head
[1:14:45] so even this is one of the every even in
[1:14:48] this church God's got real members that
[1:14:50] are born again hey man he said he
[1:14:54] December's of the slightest or to get
[1:14:55] they're the ones who are true to God so
[1:15:00] every true Holy Ghost feel Christian
[1:15:02] will be true the word they're the ones
[1:15:05] who love the Lord Jesus with all their
[1:15:07] heart and all their soul don't find them
[1:15:09] reading their Bible and what prayer
[1:15:13] meetings well this week I've asked
[1:15:15] everybody to pray at your home if you
[1:15:16] didn't hear it on the email and that you
[1:15:17] heard it have prayer meetings in your
[1:15:19] home that's how I said you bring a
[1:15:21] revival some revival of your home you'll
[1:15:26] find them who the ones that are true to
[1:15:28] God reading their Bible prayer meetings
[1:15:30] doing everything they can for the
[1:15:33] kingdom of God that's right but the
[1:15:36] mixed multitude just overpowered and
[1:15:38] worldly trying to pull them back to the
[1:15:40] things of the world what we've got to
[1:15:41] have today is other Danish Barnea where
[1:15:43] judgment in so most people we don't need
[1:15:48] that program said we do need that right
[1:15:51] we need to see who's really going to
[1:15:53] take the promise of God who wants to go
[1:15:55] to the fullness of Pentecost that
[1:15:56] brother Ed Otis is the said the Lord who
[1:15:59] wants to go to that prophecy who wants
[1:16:01] to live out that prophecy who wants more
[1:16:02] of Christ we need a cash Barnea to see
[1:16:05] who really wants that amen cuz that's
[1:16:07] the prophecy of the Owlery then it's
[1:16:10] exactly right
[1:16:11] I don't understand that by God's grace
[1:16:13] let me go back to that bear with me just
[1:16:18] a moment preach that one in language go
[1:16:24] back maybe some of us forgot that
[1:16:26] prophecy but the prophecy is by Ram said
[1:16:35] the sale order all of the Pentecost will
[1:16:37] be in the prop should have plenty of
[1:16:39] meat just under wide plenty
[1:16:41] oils so rejoice aside or Savior I
[1:16:44] remember that yeah I'll be a motor I
[1:16:51] think that's important without a vision
[1:16:54] the people do us and vision means
[1:16:57] prophecy unless you know the prophecy
[1:17:00] for our day going to perish the prophecy
[1:17:02] we've got the prescient happy the
[1:17:04] fullness of Pentecost in the blood and
[1:17:06] you look at the Bible and that's what we
[1:17:09] should have praise God that's what we
[1:17:10] should be pressing on the upward way for
[1:17:12] alright here it is let me just review
[1:17:16] that number I'm a watch man number
[1:17:19] Wednesday a message on the west and I've
[1:17:20] got a Dagon what the word says yeah

[1:17:45] rapture in her will be the what fullness
[1:17:50] not a partial the fullness of what
[1:17:54] Pentecost not the denomination the
[1:17:57] experience for the spirits you have you
[1:18:00] got to be in touch with the holy spirit
[1:18:01] yes we believe father something oh the
[1:18:03] father is the holy spirit we know that
[1:18:05] I'm saying we've got to be in touch with
[1:18:07] God in us amen
[1:18:08] the Spirit will bring the people right
[1:18:11] back to where they were at the beginning
[1:18:12] in other words we'll go right back to
[1:18:14] Acts chapter 2:11 ornate
[1:18:16] that is the safe William Branham no
[1:18:19] shudder that is no safe Jesse Smith no
[1:18:22] sir that is thus saith the Lord amen
[1:18:25] how many like that by God's grace it's
[1:18:28] not me it's not vice not really random
[1:18:30] it's the Holy Spirit is going to take us
[1:18:32] back to Pentagon oh that serves me up at
[1:18:34] lures on a new young that is the cycle
[1:18:38] or that's what Joel - 23 to 26 sets
[1:18:40] how did Olivia that's where we're going
[1:18:44] that's the prophecy we're living under
[1:18:46] and so see we are making decisions at
[1:18:49] Kadesh Barnea either to believe this or
[1:18:52] not believe it
[1:18:54] actions are louder than our words are
[1:18:58] there yeah so your home in your prayer
[1:19:00] life and your reward with God either you
[1:19:02] are being made ready or you're not being
[1:19:03] ready your actions speak louder than
[1:19:05] anything you could possibly say on
[1:19:07] Sunday morning my life as well the
[1:19:12] former rain teaching ministry brother
[1:19:15] Brendan
[1:19:15] laterade fracturing faith Maghreb City
[1:19:18] and the floor should be full of wheat
[1:19:19] wheat makes bread well plenty of bread
[1:19:21] when we come to the house of God and the
[1:19:24] fast you overflow with white or white is
[1:19:26] about to I'm sorry oh those the batches
[1:19:28] Holy Ghost and why does the stimulation
[1:19:30] of the word exactly right and I'll
[1:19:33] restore to you the years of the locust
[1:19:34] disease okay there's that evil spirit
[1:19:37] right in the horse ages just like the
[1:19:38] poor horse riders so church we're living
[1:19:40] in our restoration I love the fact that
[1:19:44] I came out of the nominations of you
[1:19:46] were raised the message god bless your
[1:19:47] heart I wish I was Marie Sid but I was
[1:19:50] so what I'm saying is that I was raised
[1:19:52] the denomination coming to the message
[1:19:54] and I can see the restoration happening
[1:19:57] there understand what I'm saying
[1:19:58] although I saw his nomination was
[1:20:00] dollars five dollars for her more evil
[1:20:03] more evil but I look at my life now I
[1:20:05] look at the ministry no unity is other
[1:20:07] words the higher way more holiness more
[1:20:09] sanctification or of God's work or the
[1:20:11] Holy Spirit we are walking up the keys
[1:20:13] highway it's the way of holiness say
[1:20:16] that I could personally firsthand see
[1:20:19] the downward spiral but now I can see
[1:20:22] how God is restoring his church we all
[1:20:23] thank God for that if your life's not
[1:20:27] being restored to look of X and that's
[1:20:28] what this office for that's okay this
[1:20:30] party is for father there yet to give
[1:20:33] you a chance to say god I'm wrong God
[1:20:35] forgive me I'm doing this done wrong but
[1:20:37] that's it be big enough to admit you're
[1:20:39] wrong and then God can get you back in
[1:20:41] grace again don't you love that and he
[1:20:44] shall eat in plenty plenty of word food
[1:20:47] to eat
[1:20:48] romances or those tapes right you're
[1:20:51] starting to taste preaching the days
[1:20:52] watching one of the night on Wednesday
[1:20:54] night it's a tape start it up and be
[1:20:57] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:20:59] Lord your God this is what this is what
[1:21:01] as a pastor this is my biggest burden I
[1:21:02] want to see people satisfied with just
[1:21:04] coming to church just coming to church
[1:21:07] just serving the Lord just being
[1:21:09] satisfied to be a Christian because we
[1:21:12] have all the week we have all the oil
[1:21:14] here ball the one you could possibly
[1:21:15] work what could be more satisfying than
[1:21:17] the Holy Ghost
[1:21:18] nothing so the thing is that people
[1:21:20] aren't satisfied with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:21] they're getting their set of extractions
[1:21:23] somewhere else
[1:21:24] and that's from the devil we must be
[1:21:26] satisfied from the Holy Ghost a.m.
[1:21:29] Alleluia judgment begins here at the
[1:21:32] house of God nuts out in your house
[1:21:34] necessarily or down at the Akron Arena

[1:21:50] God because you don't wonder she with
[1:21:52] you and you'll never be ashamed of the
[1:21:53] message tell me about that

[1:22:45] so I got two of them I got one for my
[1:22:48] house I got one for the church of my

[1:23:08] all what brother Branham said we've got
[1:23:10] to recognize the prophecy the hour and
[1:23:12] then press our way into it what John the
[1:23:14] Baptist say about the kingdom of God is
[1:23:16] it easily got into you said no the
[1:23:18] violent take it by force
[1:23:20] in other words the aggressive I know
[1:23:23] where I need to go I know what I need to
[1:23:25] do and I'm going to press my way into
[1:23:26] the kingdom of God and there's no demon
[1:23:28] that's going to pull me down or anybody
[1:23:30] trying to discourage me or undercut me
[1:23:32] or anything like that or blackmail me

[1:23:36] people who've got is yours little flock
[1:23:38] it's God's good pleasure to give you the
[1:23:39] king of a man I know yeah and never very
[1:23:44] few we can be saved very few even go in
[1:23:47] the rapture brother ran out it exploded
[1:23:49] numerous times to say hopefully there's
[1:23:51] eight he said because that was the days
[1:23:53] of Noah and Jesus said as it was the
[1:23:54] days of Noah and then asked him is that
[1:23:56] crops he said no that's just my thought
[1:23:58] doctor do you think about that how many
[1:24:01] people do you know that want the force
[1:24:02] of Pentecost in their lives that's
[1:24:04] should be I say that's what we should be
[1:24:06] praying for that's what we should be
[1:24:07] living for for more of God in our lives
[1:24:10] hey man Zack you're right the world
[1:24:15] today America doesn't like the gospel
[1:24:17] they want entertain it they gotta have
[1:24:20] something to entertain them a lot of
[1:24:21] fancy music or something like that some
[1:24:23] kind of a party so quite a weenie roast
[1:24:24] which some things are alright outside
[1:24:26] the church but the church is where
[1:24:29] judgment ought to be preached in the
[1:24:31] power of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:24:33] Jesus and a warning watch more than I
[1:24:37] was that sermon about ones that it's my
[1:24:39] duty to warn the rest of the pastor must
[1:24:41] warn from the pulpit anything he sees he
[1:24:43] must warn the people I get he does it
[1:24:45] the souls on him the Bloods on him if I
[1:24:49] see sin if I see our church go visit
[1:24:51] sort of things that I don't preach
[1:24:52] against it it's shame on me woe to me if
[1:24:55] I don't preach the gospel it's exactly
[1:24:57] right there the watchman there the one
[1:25:01] who's called rest' he's responsible he
[1:25:04] said judgment begins those of God not
[1:25:06] parties judgment ah America people is
[1:25:10] entertained that's what they have to
[1:25:11] happen that leads the spirit that's in
[1:25:14] them be careful what you're feeding on
[1:25:15] right it shows what's in you whatever
[1:25:18] you feed on it's an entertainment spirit
[1:25:21] you have to entertain them god I don't
[1:25:22] entertain people he rebukes people well
[1:25:27] that's a tough hook to free sometimes he
[1:25:30] don't undertake you he wants to review
[1:25:33] you Jesus said as many as I love I
[1:25:38] rebuke and chasten and that's not for
[1:25:41] Philadelphia that's for you and I but as
[1:25:44] man that's the office later seeing
[1:25:46] Saints here by God's grace judgment
[1:25:50] begins at the house of God when it comes
[1:25:54] to time the church has to have soup
[1:25:55] suppers dances uncle games all kinds of
[1:25:57] nonsense of Roman sales to pay the
[1:25:58] preacher God have mercy
[1:26:00] yeah that's right so God don't come to
[1:26:04] entertain you now he'll bless you right
[1:26:06] if it would joy less your heart but he
[1:26:09] comes here to correct us right he comes
[1:26:12] to preview us and we got to have enough
[1:26:14] grace to know if God loves me he rebukes
[1:26:15] me we need the Holy Ghost and power and
[1:26:20] adoption that our ministry will speak
[1:26:21] out amen
[1:26:22] but the people when they go to see
[1:26:23] something they go to see a certain
[1:26:24] ministry here this pose got a certain
[1:26:26] ministry well they go over and say oh
[1:26:27] yeah that's pretty good huh that's ok
[1:26:29] well where we going tomorrow weather has
[1:26:32] photos making a point like people just
[1:26:34] get entertainment preachers instead of
[1:26:36] finding where the ministry God called
[1:26:37] him to set under they just go to be
[1:26:39] entertained by administer a little bit
[1:26:43] recognizing that spirit what was that
[1:26:44] 1960 even he saw well people's go to
[1:26:48] this church cuz they like that ministry
[1:26:49] it's fine if you like that ministry that
[1:26:52] supported for the RAM said with all your
[1:26:53] attendance and all your ties and make it
[1:26:56] your post of duty until you die or
[1:26:57] remember said or you go in the rapture
[1:26:59] other than via speak to this rock when
[1:27:04] they come to a place called Kadesh
[1:27:05] Barnea at one time I'm told as a great
[1:27:07] judgement seat it says a great spring or
[1:27:10] well there are many little whales a
[1:27:10] perfect type of church the church is the
[1:27:12] judgment seat we're having is the great
[1:27:14] judgment seat of God and the little
[1:27:15] widows represent the little churches all
[1:27:17] outta judgment begins the house of God
[1:27:18] see here's where the judgment begins
[1:27:21] here that's I don't see why so many
[1:27:26] people complain that I speak so too hard
[1:27:28] and try to make people straighten up and
[1:27:31] tell them the way they're living the way
[1:27:33] they're dressing and tell me I'm hurting
[1:27:34] my ministry when the judgment seat is
[1:27:36] the house of God
[1:27:40] he said I don't understand why they
[1:27:42] complain this is where you get judged
[1:27:44] this is where the Holy Spirit through
[1:27:46] the preaching says either that's wrong
[1:27:48] or that's right that's why you come here
[1:27:50] but see the Church of God how she God's
[1:27:53] become a entertainment house rather than
[1:27:54] a courthouse that's why I told so many
[1:27:57] ways how you dress up for church and I
[1:27:59] was trying to be real gentle I said you
[1:28:01] know brothers yeah I understand you I
[1:28:02] said come as you are I'm trying to be
[1:28:04] real diplomatic I said come as you are I
[1:28:06] said but we dress up because we know
[1:28:08] we're going to God's courtroom and you
[1:28:12] don't go be set before any Honorable
[1:28:14] Judge look in any old way because
[1:28:16] they'll see right through your laziness
[1:28:18] or your your disagreeable spirit right
[1:28:21] the fact that you're guilty but you come
[1:28:23] to the house of God it's business
[1:28:24] it is the judgments of God that are on
[1:28:26] our lives amen judging this is the right
[1:28:29] move this is the wrong move straighten
[1:28:31] up get back in line
[1:28:32] Jesus loves us when we're in line Amen
[1:28:34] hallelujah that's where you begin it
[1:28:38] right here where justice and
[1:28:40] righteousness and judgment of God is to
[1:28:42] go for for Blair the tape player the
[1:28:44] pulpit the pulpit is supposed to go from
[1:28:49] a living creature exactly right it's
[1:28:51] getting another sermon that noticed a a
[1:28:53] great famous Pentecostal preacher took
[1:28:56] me the room out a year ago and said
[1:28:57] brother grant let me lay hands upon you
[1:28:59] pray for you I said I'm not sick he said
[1:29:02] there's something wrong in your ministry
[1:29:04] you operate no wonder the preachers
[1:29:06] won't properly do it's the way you
[1:29:07] condemned them women
[1:29:09] he was just preaching on women living a
[1:29:11] holy life he said let me lay hands on
[1:29:12] you sir I'm not sick lover
[1:29:16] he said well people think they are they
[1:29:18] and you don't teach them spiritual
[1:29:20] things after they receive great
[1:29:21] spiritual blessings and things I said
[1:29:22] how can you teach the knowledge or they
[1:29:24] can be super ABCs they don't have the
[1:29:26] common decency to line up with the word
[1:29:28] of that long spiritual thing and they
[1:29:30] don't believe the earthly things how
[1:29:31] they going to believe how many things he
[1:29:34] said well you'll just you ruin your
[1:29:35] ministry and I said any ministry the
[1:29:37] Word of God will ruin it should be
[1:29:39] ruined oh come back to the word that's
[1:29:44] right a hard anymore you might like you
[1:29:46] all the way stay home on Wednesday
[1:29:48] nights and no come over here to church
[1:29:50] watching television
[1:29:51] other nights of church think you really
[1:29:53] say if you have to come to church you
[1:29:56] have to force yourself good because we
[1:29:58] think it's a law for you to do it so now
[1:30:00] is getting the people that you have to
[1:30:02] force themselves to come to church they
[1:30:03] don't love coming to church if you don't
[1:30:05] love it come to church by benches time
[1:30:07] you got to pray praise God
[1:30:10] I appreciate what - Wednesdays ago two
[1:30:12] Sundays ago if you don't love everybody
[1:30:14] here love coming out look out
[1:30:16] he said it's time to you about to
[1:30:17] praying because saint has objected you
[1:30:20] with some type of poison and it's hurt
[1:30:21] said that's what Christ to Mister God
[1:30:24] really just listen to this week he said
[1:30:27] you want to do it is I would do it if
[1:30:29] you don't love to do it why go to church
[1:30:31] on Wednesday night there's something
[1:30:32] wrong there's a Holy Spirit that makes
[1:30:34] you love to serve God what a quote that
[1:30:38] would be not to take that to all
[1:30:40] domestic churches that said before if
[1:30:42] you drive a live an hour and half I
[1:30:44] don't expect you to drive an hour and a
[1:30:45] half an hour on expect you do that but
[1:30:48] if you can be here and you're choosing
[1:30:50] not to and it's a your feel like you're
[1:30:53] forcing if you fit this quote and you
[1:30:55] feel like it's a force to go to church
[1:30:56] that you've missed something because the
[1:30:58] love of God makes you want to go to
[1:31:00] church not a duty but a love to God it
[1:31:04] supposed to duty but you keep the duty
[1:31:06] out of love anything though you hate it
[1:31:08] that you're right on beach the reason
[1:31:12] the Holy Spirit today we rebuke and tear
[1:31:13] down the church remember that is in
[1:31:15] church age as many as I love I rebuke
[1:31:17] as many as I love our group thank God
[1:31:19] for rebuking a real father who
[1:31:21] straightened us up and get us out
[1:31:24] brother having thanks God that's a real
[1:31:26] father that will straight you up so I
[1:31:28] got to straighten up Malachi in the
[1:31:29] Lydia and these different months I hate
[1:31:31] to do it but a real father does that and
[1:31:34] they always ask me daddy come in the
[1:31:36] store when you got spanked by your dad
[1:31:37] love here that day you never Eddie's
[1:31:42] thinking up to that you cannot because
[1:31:44] I'm in it but I just learned a lesson
[1:31:46] give the rod if you don't give the rod
[1:31:49] it spoils and makes a selfish shot I
[1:31:52] mean no that's the scripture to some
[1:31:54] degree out of this but you must give
[1:31:56] some physical pain or you spoil the
[1:31:58] child it's exactly right
[1:32:02] thank God for rebuking a real father he
[1:32:05] saw happen a medal day today you very
[1:32:07] much was upset at what I said the other
[1:32:08] night about widows it was not nice for
[1:32:11] persons do that absolutely up scripts
[1:32:13] you said I don't if I don't preach
[1:32:21] against sin are my ministry be ruined
[1:32:24] how many understand that because then
[1:32:27] you let the goats in and then it's no
[1:32:28] longer a Ministry of crisis and ministry

[1:32:40] them that lady met me outside she's let
[1:32:42] me tell you stuff right now preacher
[1:32:43] you're sure going to ruin your ministry
[1:32:45] I said any ministry the Word of God will
[1:32:46] ruin ought to be ruined exactly right
[1:32:49] she said well everybody walk away from
[1:32:50] you I said as long as he stays with me
[1:32:53] that's the main that you see let him say
[1:32:56] Amen that's my safe brochure says that's
[1:33:00] why these things are burning all the
[1:33:01] Arts for months and years in these
[1:33:02] things I'm just trying to stay with the
[1:33:05] word if I preach something wrong with
[1:33:07] ramps if we're duty obligated come talk
[1:33:09] to me about it privately and tell me
[1:33:10] I've had nobody to come to tell me I'm
[1:33:12] wrong on any major doctrine but see it's
[1:33:15] a pastor Bernstein I preach the truth I
[1:33:17] feed them the Word of God and people
[1:33:19] walk away what can you do just love them
[1:33:22] and pray for them and keep increasing
[1:33:24] your service for Jesus amen I thought

[1:33:29] decrease your service or dedication to
[1:33:31] Christ
[1:33:31] it must inspire you to increase your
[1:33:33] service a bang is that the season of my
[1:33:37] life I might be I might be in the
[1:33:38] darkest season in my life right now how
[1:33:40] do I know I might be I might be in a
[1:33:43] fire tear of of Jesse Smith litem praise
[1:33:47] God the darkest hour where I feel like
[1:33:50] all of the low and everything you know
[1:33:51] you know how it is go go go through hard
[1:33:54] times and people say things against you
[1:33:55] know all things like this but what you
[1:33:57] have to do you just have to love them
[1:34:00] back and you have to increase your
[1:34:02] service to Christ how many other Lord in

[1:34:12] Bible said rebuke a dog
[1:34:15] let us send rebuked before everybody let
[1:34:17] me know that also that Timothy we've had
[1:34:22] three people
[1:34:23] well three individuals over the years
[1:34:24] I'm not going to name any time spirits
[1:34:26] and we're still friends on Facebook and
[1:34:29] I'm trying to reach out to all of my
[1:34:30] email and calls and they won't get back
[1:34:32] with me and some of these are from years
[1:34:36] ago some of them a little more recent
[1:34:38] but let me just share some of these one
[1:34:40] of them was a preacher that preached
[1:34:42] here and we sat in ministers meetings
[1:34:46] together something's I shared I mean let
[1:34:48] me just show you with this I'm sharing
[1:34:49] you with you this because I've given
[1:34:51] them warnings and they able to take heed
[1:34:53] to the warning to understand this
[1:34:56] creature I've tried to warn him on
[1:34:57] different things like this and different
[1:34:59] pause things he was saying and recently
[1:35:02] I saw him on Facebook and he had put a
[1:35:04] video of himself a dancing tour dozen
[1:35:07] roses at a wedding reception of his
[1:35:08] daughter drunk singing oh sweet child of
[1:35:12] mine sweet you know if you're in the
[1:35:13] world you remember that song MS song
[1:35:15] house in the world preach from this
[1:35:17] pulpit right here and the first thing
[1:35:20] they left meetings and then they sound
[1:35:22] even church this is one of the first
[1:35:23] days
[1:35:24] where's judgement begin Church at the
[1:35:26] house of God and this person was up to
[1:35:29] be a pastor of the church and was almost
[1:35:33] coated as pastor you see how slide that
[1:35:38] demonic satanic spirit can be he's the
[1:35:40] upside of this just like Judas all
[1:35:42] around for three and a half three half
[1:35:43] years undetected but Jesus detective the
[1:35:48] oligo slow detected amen and this
[1:35:52] brother was a minister regular set
[1:35:53] ministers meeting sheriff's of things
[1:35:55] told testimony about speaking in tongues
[1:35:57] and all these things and message camp
[1:35:58] meetings around the world that don't
[1:36:01] mean nothing to your current walk with
[1:36:04] God is what shows what you are your
[1:36:06] curva that's it never judge yourself out
[1:36:08] how many miracles but how much fruit
[1:36:10] you're currently producing a night I
[1:36:12] mean understand that wondered I tried to
[1:36:16] correct him on doctrine he would say my
[1:36:17] dad was too hard about marriage and
[1:36:19] divorce and name-calling all these
[1:36:20] things like that I said no sir you got
[1:36:23] to understand where he's coming from
[1:36:24] and now dancing the rock and roll and he
[1:36:27] has a bastard on he put
[1:36:28] a post recently said one leg of a
[1:36:30] servant so he cusses telling a sermon or
[1:36:33] pastor what a great sermon was a man
[1:36:35] that used to presa medicine right
[1:36:36] alongside me at church you see what
[1:36:39] happens when you don't take a warning
[1:36:40] you see how the judgments of God rest
[1:36:43] upon these people god help us to be
[1:36:45] sincere with the word of your hand help
[1:36:46] us to see that everything we do has an
[1:36:48] impact every little decision must be
[1:36:51] brought back to the Word of God if not
[1:36:53] you'll just fall one step further and
[1:36:54] says one step and then what is that
[1:36:56] earlier one step further see you got to
[1:36:59] deal with the K - and you got to get
[1:37:00] right with God and then you'll be back
[1:37:02] in God's grace again amen
[1:37:04] one of our founding members of this
[1:37:06] church warden a warning repeatedly
[1:37:08] called it sobbing on the phone begging
[1:37:11] them to come back
[1:37:12] now post up about a homosexual rights
[1:37:15] and loving homosexuality and post things
[1:37:17] about making love with people and all
[1:37:19] kinds of things like that
[1:37:20] and I've seen them dancing the spirit
[1:37:22] I've seen them fast I see them speak in
[1:37:24] tongues I've seen through all these
[1:37:26] things like that it doesn't matter how
[1:37:28] you start with God it's how you finish
[1:37:30] with God it man it's exactly right
[1:37:33] warning after warning after warning what
[1:37:38] will happen they stopped coming to the
[1:37:40] house of God they stopped here the
[1:37:41] judgments of God and so they left and
[1:37:43] now they're under what they're under
[1:37:45] judgment instead of under grace you see
[1:37:47] that I do have a brother Adam called out
[1:37:50] people he caught them by name Elvis
[1:37:53] Presley Pat boom boom he named some more
[1:37:55] he called JFK Jacqueline Kennedy he
[1:37:58] called it all these people out by name
[1:37:59] and the Bible said them to sin rebuke
[1:38:02] before all and I'm sharing these
[1:38:05] examples as warnings the next one is a
[1:38:07] brother had one allowance eight minutes
[1:38:09] I ever had in my church and I sure
[1:38:11] appreciate Amen Corner always what did
[1:38:14] they make mortar you understand I'm
[1:38:17] saying oh but I walked and then I was
[1:38:21] dealing with this person met with them
[1:38:23] emailed them text them to repent all
[1:38:26] these things and one day and I walk in
[1:38:27] the minister and help out and they're
[1:38:30] actually in the act they just got done
[1:38:31] with fornication I got to turn my eyes
[1:38:33] and see things like this let's send the
[1:38:36] message I've cried with them I prayed
[1:38:38] with them all these things like this a
[1:38:40] facet for them all the
[1:38:41] things and you see how we have this no
[1:38:45] matter what happens to the people the
[1:38:47] true life of God will be pure to God
[1:38:49] they'll stay with the word they'll love
[1:38:51] the Word of God
[1:38:52] they'll be here the house of God hearing
[1:38:54] that their sins are forgiven a net glory
[1:38:57] and they'll line their lives up with the
[1:39:00] word that is preached at this spring at
[1:39:03] this well at this river that gives for
[1:39:06] living waters of living rivers of life

[1:39:23] another step these are all people I'm
[1:39:25] great with like I said seen God do great
[1:39:27] things through to understand so if I

[1:40:02] hurt anything when I got a breach
[1:40:03] against in or great people I should
[1:40:06] never be afraid he's going to hurt
[1:40:07] anything you might hurt sin but you'll
[1:40:11] never hurt righteousness by preaching
[1:40:13] righteous and that glory that's what
[1:40:17] I've got a hard time sometimes be like
[1:40:19] I'm hurt people's feelings things like
[1:40:20] that I got to have blinders on where all
[1:40:22] I see is Christ I don't see feelings I
[1:40:24] will see faces I just see what what is
[1:40:26] Christ what does the man of end of the
[1:40:27] balcony want me to say any minute

[1:40:32] gotta answer for for my ministry let me
[1:40:35] I shall answer for every word left
[1:40:37] reached I am sorry we're not dream I'm
[1:40:41] glad to know it's not my work Robin's
[1:40:43] words mouths word every Church has
[1:40:47] decadence running a primary doubt equip
[1:40:49] everybody else
[1:40:50] right the first thing I want to say my
[1:40:54] travels around the world as far as I
[1:40:55] know this is the one most spiritual
[1:40:56] places you feel the Spirit of God more
[1:40:58] in any of the church I know it's about
[1:40:59] granite ever now I had two other places
[1:41:02] in mind that used to be but so far we
[1:41:05] don't seem to see those places one of
[1:41:08] them is when the organization and the
[1:41:10] other has kind of followed see every
[1:41:14] church comes to a K - Barnea everybody
[1:41:17] see that brother Branham uses five three
[1:41:19] great churches where the Spirit of God
[1:41:20] moved all the time right but he said
[1:41:25] Reese just recently I found two churches
[1:41:27] that the Spirit of God doesn't move
[1:41:30] there anymore now whose fault is that
[1:41:31] but I said to the pastor or the
[1:41:33] congregation is fault
[1:41:34] or both their fault so we understand
[1:41:39] what I'm saying we are Church this is
[1:41:42] our little humble Bride of Christ
[1:41:43] fellowship we need to take a little more
[1:41:45] serious you don't when sometimes
[1:41:47] absolutely because we have welcome to
[1:41:49] Kadesh Barnea
[1:41:50] I want it aside with a men are we going
[1:41:52] into the promise of God are we going to
[1:41:53] hold back on God we can't do it we're
[1:41:55] not big enough our church is too small
[1:41:56] there's no way we can take rapture of
[1:41:58] faith oh come on Josh from Kate alert or
[1:42:01] Josh and Kayla get up there and testify
[1:42:02] I've been on that side I've seen rapture
[1:42:05] power I've seen healing power glory
[1:42:07] I've seen prophecy power I've seen all
[1:42:09] these things we're more than able to
[1:42:11] take the rapture amen
[1:42:13] sorry our church is going to cover that
[1:42:16] I understand that we're going to come to
[1:42:17] that bring a tabernacle Happy Valley
[1:42:20] Oh spoken word Tabernacle every Church
[1:42:23] is going to come the Kadish Barnea we've
[1:42:27] got to be able to say we're going to
[1:42:28] take that and then I actually got to
[1:42:30] back it up not doing less forgot it but
[1:42:33] do it and more for God however that
[1:42:35] looks for you it might just be praying
[1:42:37] at home and that is if that is praise
[1:42:39] God what a wonderful ministry that is
[1:42:41] prayer is the most powerful what we've
[1:42:43] got ever gained in the country okay for
[1:42:45] this church pay for the service pray for
[1:42:47] me pray for the musicians pray prayers
[1:42:49] most powerful thing you can do to help
[1:42:51] our church go into rapture in faith I
[1:42:53] understand that rather than I'm sure you
[1:42:57] do realize that as I made this remark
[1:42:58] about this being a spiritual place the
[1:43:00] branagh tabernacle it isn't the biggest
[1:43:02] place in the world it isn't what we
[1:43:03] have the most thing in the most
[1:43:05] screaming most holler of the most
[1:43:06] speaking and tons of things that isn't
[1:43:08] it but it's the quality of the sphere
[1:43:10] that operates here in this tabernacle
[1:43:12] and so far and I looked so far I don't
[1:43:16] know if it's there today now I'm not the
[1:43:17] pastor there that's all about the judges
[1:43:19] if I was passed so far I want to commend
[1:43:21] and thank mother Neville and you brother
[1:43:22] trustees because for what you have done
[1:43:26] in helping keeping this this way
[1:43:28] it's been a long prayer mind and desire
[1:43:30] since a boy to see the church put in
[1:43:32] order and kept it so you see every

[1:45:43] that you've wanted more of God how many
[1:45:45] can say that I slit I will or God you

[1:45:52] quote earlier is I kind of took the
[1:45:53] endless stuff that's only one time
[1:45:56] you're going to be mortal and this might
[1:45:59] be the time you got to make your
[1:46:00] decision you either going to move up
[1:46:02] with God or stay where you're at you may
[1:46:07] have to make your decision tonight now
[1:46:09] look may this may be Arcada she's
[1:46:11] serving right now I don't know what I
[1:46:15] know what the prophecy says and I know
[1:46:16] how to preach God's Word and I know the
[1:46:19] rapture seemed to come and we know the
[1:46:22] tribulation is soon to come - we've got
[1:46:24] to make ready for it for the registry if
[1:46:28] it is your can - I pray you don't throw
[1:46:30] everything loose remember I don't care
[1:46:31] what it is if it's a job if it's your
[1:46:33] family put your loved ones if it's
[1:46:35] associates and fit your partners
[1:46:36] whatever it is turn loose of everything
[1:46:38] either puts his hand on the plow it even
[1:46:40] turns to look back is not worthy plowing
[1:46:42] he said that's right the Candace based
[1:46:45] on cash marnya which was a great
[1:46:47] judgment seat and it's supposed to be an
[1:46:49] oasis out there in the desert
[1:46:50] we're big wells and Springs and say that
[1:46:53] it and we can go to Tyson say that it's
[1:46:56] a throne of God at the little judgment
[1:46:58] seats the churches so we're just a
[1:47:01] little judgment seat this is a little
[1:47:03] open little judgement seat he says where
[1:47:06] judgment begins he's preaching tonight
[1:47:08] and he said I want you I want to kind of
[1:47:10] use it more like it was a room of the
[1:47:12] courtroom where and after all the Pope
[1:47:14] and the church is a courtroom the Bible
[1:47:18] says the judgment see that begins the
[1:47:19] house of God and this is like the throne
[1:47:22] at the jury the witnesses so forth and
[1:47:26] here today for my witness is God's Word
[1:47:28] and what do I have lay before me when we
[1:47:31] have
[1:47:31] before every service God's Word this
[1:47:34] will witness our lives with us we either
[1:47:36] believed it organic our actions always
[1:47:39] speak louder than our words understand
[1:47:41] that I'm closing with this so Oh give my
[1:47:47] word I love this this is the court I
[1:47:52] just came across the story thankful more
[1:47:53] well the man who said this is a judgment
[1:47:56] house and the judgment house is where
[1:47:59] you let your sins go and it was so
[1:48:02] perfect that brother Mike came here to
[1:48:04] give his testimony for the Mike is from
[1:48:06] from the cam Church he was a like a
[1:48:09] bottom Serb construction worker 270
[1:48:13] pounds of all muscle and a police
[1:48:15] officer was called to shoot him because
[1:48:19] he was messing up the community they
[1:48:23] lived in and it's on and I got the video
[1:48:24] home I got a cop shot him 15 feet away
[1:48:27] in the back and for years he's been
[1:48:32] paralyzed for nine years and he was just
[1:48:35] ready to give up he bail from church to
[1:48:36] church and added Emmaline my cousin who
[1:48:38] was here in that sanctuary few months
[1:48:41] ago your ever remember that was Jason
[1:48:43] the Mars is here you guys remember my
[1:48:44] cousin Adam he left our church so on
[1:48:47] fire now he's since not you know he
[1:48:50] doesn't come to the churches yet but he
[1:48:52] left our church so on fire he went and
[1:48:56] he couldn't get this night guys out of
[1:48:58] his own wheelchair he shot by cop lost
[1:49:00] ability to walk and Mike's struggle with
[1:49:03] you know sin he struggled all these
[1:49:04] things never heard the message and but
[1:49:05] my because I was like I can't get Mike
[1:49:07] off my heart man I gotta share with my
[1:49:10] the message that Jesse and Simon bleed
[1:49:12] so he called him up Simon came and the
[1:49:15] brother Mike's like set it over right
[1:49:17] now he was searching he was really
[1:49:18] searching for God he says him over Simon
[1:49:22] goes over in the first Bible study their
[1:49:24] hearts got kindled together because
[1:49:25] they're both over there by one side of
[1:49:27] Hope pipefitters you know they're both
[1:49:28] of the trades and a preacher Kenneth and
[1:49:32] he started coming to camp search and a
[1:49:34] preacher came sandy beach and reach on
[1:49:36] to repentance
[1:49:36] and it was right before the court trial
[1:49:40] where they're going to condemn this cop
[1:49:42] he was
[1:49:43] gyah trying to kill brother might he was
[1:49:46] guilty of it and the sermon was all
[1:49:48] repentance and so for the mic was of
[1:49:50] course weeping and fighting out with
[1:49:53] true repentance is how is he going to go
[1:49:54] to court now condemn this man who shot
[1:49:56] him but the Bible says you have to
[1:49:58] forgive seventy times seven and so he
[1:50:04] goes to the courtroom and it's on tape I
[1:50:06] can show you the video if you want he
[1:50:08] goes to the courtroom and he holds up
[1:50:11] his King James Bible and he says I
[1:50:13] learned by true Christianity for the
[1:50:14] King James Bible that I must forgive
[1:50:16] this police officer please chop drop all
[1:50:18] the charges and it was news all over
[1:50:21] Toledo antenna and it was shared all
[1:50:24] over all kinds of stairs all over
[1:50:25] Facebook and all these things and so it
[1:50:29] was at that courtroom that brother Mike
[1:50:31] let the sin of anger of a man who shot
[1:50:33] him in the back he let that go in the
[1:50:36] courtroom and that man walked away
[1:50:39] scot-free where'd it happen at in the
[1:50:43] courtroom and that's a beautiful picture
[1:50:47] of what our life should look like every
[1:50:50] time we come to church if we're
[1:50:52] condemnation up if you're walking your
[1:50:53] fold all the O's will know will sense it
[1:50:56] somebody will sense it your feel the
[1:50:58] spirit go fire by your walk in the
[1:51:00] spirit will sense that when you go in
[1:51:02] here feeling guilty God's got away a
[1:51:04] piece of there's a great court system
[1:51:06] give up your sins to God and your sins
[1:51:08] will go before you your sins will be
[1:51:10] forgiven right here in God's courthouse
[1:51:11] and here's the scripture program uses
[1:51:13] for me some men's sins are open before
[1:51:18] him going before to judgment and some
[1:51:24] men they follow after some men's days go
[1:51:28] before them some men's sins follow after
[1:51:31] them to the judgement likewise also the
[1:51:33] good works of summer manifest beforehand
[1:51:35] and they that are otherwise cannot be
[1:51:38] hid the same are features a program says
[1:51:40] as we close I prayed for the church here
[1:51:42] that he's lovely
[1:51:43] that's they called in heavenly father
[1:51:44] now to us not just bring us to the house
[1:51:47] of correction and correction begins at
[1:51:50] the house of God judgment starts here
[1:51:56] some men's sins goes on before them some
[1:51:59] vowel if you go to the scripture I never
[1:52:01] had seen this before more let ours go
[1:52:05] before us as we confess them that
[1:52:09] they're wrong and may we have mercy
[1:52:14] grace from thy Son Jesus but the Bible
[1:52:19] say your sins either go before you
[1:52:21] they're going to follow you I don't want
[1:52:23] any sin follow me to the judgment to
[1:52:26] read with me Halon I hope you don't want
[1:52:29] your sins following you
[1:52:30] we've got to set our sins before us
[1:52:33] we're at the throne at the courtroom at
[1:52:37] the house of God how many like that by
[1:52:40] God's grace how many 1 that our reality
[1:52:42] in their life
[1:52:43] or let my sins go before me that they
[1:52:46] don't follow me
[1:52:47] I thought I could get away with this I
[1:52:48] thought I could cut it your orders here
[1:52:50] I thought I could kind of break the
[1:52:52] message here there you can't you can't
[1:52:56] God is the one who searches the hearts
[1:53:01] and so I just put this in this was for
[1:53:04] me it may be for some of you to the Rams
[1:53:09] I read this laugh a couple weeks ago
[1:53:10] it's hard to always be a servant isn't
[1:53:12] it but those who spend in our step for
[1:53:15] others will one day be seated with him
[1:53:17] in his throne but after what a lesson
[1:53:20] there's no ceasing of this gracious
[1:53:21] service of love unto the Lord but rather
[1:53:24] an increasing of service that is the
[1:53:28] secret to the Christian life we know the
[1:53:30] secret is more service more prayer more
[1:53:35] love more read your Bibles more spending
[1:53:38] time alone with God aren't you glad you
[1:53:39] know the secret a random says samson's
[1:53:42] see here was the prayer meetings his
[1:53:45] prayer times with God he could reach
[1:53:46] back inside to operating through
[1:53:48] hallelujah I can feel that covenant I
[1:53:50] can feel the power of God hey let the
[1:53:54] enemy attempt us for our service for the
[1:53:55] Lord our reply this will increase our
[1:53:58] service to God I'm not going to backside
[1:54:01] on God I'm not going to increase what
[1:54:03] I'm doing I'm going to increase it all
[1:54:07] so they'll be very gladly spend and be
[1:54:09] spent
[1:54:10] or you know the more abundantly I love
[1:54:14] you the less time you left parents can
[1:54:18] understand that I'm sure grandparents
[1:54:20] you try to love your children sometimes
[1:54:22] you try to love friends you trial of
[1:54:24] aunts and uncles the more you love them
[1:54:26] the less they love you Paul had to deal
[1:54:29] with that but guess what that's part of
[1:54:32] being a Christian the Bible said because
[1:54:35] of iniquity love of many shall wax but
[1:54:37] we should expect that this is what I'm
[1:54:38] trying to in my heart to try to wrap my
[1:54:40] mind around this constantly to fulfill
[1:54:43] this I will keep increasing my love for
[1:54:45] Christ
[1:54:45] I will not decrease it I'll keep
[1:54:47] increasing my love and if I can keep
[1:54:49] loving the less I'm loved that's fine as
[1:54:51] long as I know he loves hey man hey man
[1:54:54] I know the prophecy less love less Holy
[1:55:00] Spirit of people's lives but for us we
[1:55:02] can be different we can fall under the
[1:55:04] prophecy of the hour we want to do this
[1:55:08] stuff on us the first fruits the house
[1:55:11] is upon us
[1:55:12] they have addicted themselves to the
[1:55:14] Ministry of the saint where you going to

[1:55:33] going to give God more of myself hey man
[1:55:36] submit yourselves in a sense that's just
[1:55:40] our heads and work hope you raise your
[1:55:44] hands if I just pray for me something
