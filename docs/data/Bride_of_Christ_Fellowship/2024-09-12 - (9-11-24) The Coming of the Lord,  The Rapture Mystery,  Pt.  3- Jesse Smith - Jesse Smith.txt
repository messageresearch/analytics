preaching on this uh coming of the Lord uh the Rapture mystery part three and uh it's real good to be in the house of the Lord here today you know uh as before we're getting there you know I thought by now you know there might be some chicanery going on because the election so I'm sure you saw the debate last night and um well maybe you didn't hope maybe you didn't that's fine if you didn't um anyways um you know I thought you know as we headed into this year I thought there might be some more things like Co or something like that but you know so far thank God you know we haven't had to deal with things like that you know by the grace of God let's keep praying because there's power in prayer you know there's no demon that can stand before Jesus right we know that then we also know God has to allow things to get set up for the One World Government and so forth but we just don't know the day or the hour but I just reminded of that that God has been gracious so far you God and he's always gracious don't get me wrong he's always gracious but just specifically to the prayers for this year he's been very gracious so I want to thank the Lord for that that he is uh so gracious and merciful Hallelujah so 1 Thessalonians 4:16 And1 17 and then after this occasion we'll switch over but we can read this so I want to look at a little more like I didn't get to some of the things on Sunday so I'm just picking up right where I left off there and uh we we'll look uh little deeper into this topic of the Rapture mystery here all right so let's read this on three if we can on three one two three for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord let's have one more word of prayer Lord we love you Lord thank you for the song you given to our brother lord it's so refreshing Lord God we just want to thank you Lord you've Rewritten our stories Lord God and we're just so thankful Lord God could have been much more awful but but Lord you've been so gracious to us Lord God as the scripture saith he giveth more grace Lord God thank you for your Amazing Grace in our lives continue to bless each person here in the church Lord God and we just want to draw a nigh to you thank you again Lord God that this year we haven't had covid yet Lord of course we don't know what tomorrow holds Lord we just know that you hold tomorrow so father God we just want to say thank you for your grace for this year to this point and father we ask for peace God we ask for Mercy we pray for our leaders that you'd pull down lord those that won't repent raise up Godly leaders Lord uh uh as we're taught in the scripture Lord God we pray for our current leaders that they'll repent of Lord their uh uh their policies Lord God and uh we lord we We Trust You Lord you'll do what's right Lord God you always you always have the perfect plan Lord God and no man can resist your spirit we're told so father we thank you and we love you and father help me Lord here tonight and Bless the people in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God God bless you as you're being seated there praise God all right so we want to uh I got some slides here and hopefully these show up this time see see how long we'll go tonight I think I went 45 maybe last month or last week kind of see how it goes so we're looking at part three here we're going to pick up right where we left off that's the wrong text that's the one slide I didn't update there but I want to pick up right where I left off uh brother says unbelief does not hinder God of course we know the Bible teaches that brother Ram just said it in his own way his modern way to say it uh no man remember Paul said that in Romans nine no man can resist God's will right if God wants to do something nobody can resist him no one's unbelief can do it you know no one's no one's anger can do it no one's unrepentent heart can stop God God does what he wants praise God now uh we read this but I want to read this again uh uh the church is going to be there without spot or wrinkle and the church said no spots no wrinkles Hallelujah that's what the Bible says hallelujah the grace of God will do that it'll have to it'll take Grace like he talked to Abraham when Sarah doubt him well right then he could have slayed her but he would have slew Sarah right then for doubting but because that's the worst in there is is unbelief it's really the only sin so see because it's you disbelieve you then you have fruits of sin so unbelief is the root of all sin right unbelief if that's not kept in check or it's not cut off it will produce the fruit of adultery or the fruit of murder or the fruit of lie or something like that but ultimately the first part of that sin is unbelief we can see it plainly Hallelujah and she doubted and laughed within herself when the angel discerned her through the tent is that right but why couldn't she he take Sarah because she was part of Abraham he had to take Abraham too and we are part of Jesus when we're in the body of Christ Our unbelief are excused if we do it ignorantly like she did for she was scared amen so we all battle fear don't we right and we don't mean to be afraid right none of us enjoy being afraid do we none of us uh enjoy uh doubting what's go doubting the future right none of us enjoy that and the same thing with with Sarah you know because of fear she had a nervous laugh at God we'd say you know she just didn't know how it work out I mean how could it be possible how could I I'm n I'm 89 years old how could I ever have a baby she just was battling fear in the moment and laughed at it out of a nervous fear and but but God excused it because God already knew what was going to happen God knew he was going to discern her heart and then God knew because of that she'd receive strength and God knows Church the bride's going to receive strength hallelujah amen just like Sarah she had to receive strength to conceive and have a body change the same is true for this bride Hallelujah for the body change she's going to receive strength have a body change she's going to bring forth the Son of God hallelujah so he's going to manifest Jesus Christ amen and I wrote down here you know God help our unbelief just like he did Sarah Sarah laughed and lied to God yet God forgave it and God still changed her body amen Abraham laughed but God still changed his body Hallelujah Abraham lied right Abraham ran from the presence of the Lord hallelujah Thomas demanded a physical sign think about that you know uh you know God was so merciful he said if I'm not going to believe unless I can have a physical sign and God was so gracious he gave him a physical sign he showed up at at a at another time just to show Thomas this proves the love of God to me this proves God's love if somebody really wants to believe God's going to help them believe amen if somebody really wants to go in the Rapture if somebody really wants to be saved God's going to help them be saved amen God's going to help us be saved if even no matter what we need to believe if we want to believe God will help us just like this father with the demon-possessed child Hallelujah Jesus said to him if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth now look Jesus puts it on him in other words Austin if you can believe all things are possible look at that see how God tests our faith sometimes if you can believe brother or sisters if you can believe Brothers if you can believe Jesus puts it on them but what's the honest answer for every person Lord I believe help my unbelief amen see even when God challenges you when he challenges you he wants you to say Lord I believe but you've got to help me do this amen I mean right God doesn't expect us to be perfect God's not asking us to be perfect God knows uh he pies us like children as we looked at a few weeks ago he remembers we're just dust but he's a loving father Hallelujah and because of his love he'll challenge us but then he'll be able to raise our faith Hallelujah then Jesus saw the people came running together he rebuked the foul Spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit I charge you come out of him and enter no more into him that's what I share with each one of us we have authority to rebuke spirits and say you're not coming on me again right and I've seen in my life things wicked things I've done I've been able to speak to those and they've never come up back on me again amen hallelujah right that's right that's the power of God that we have amen we have the power of God I'll never do that again I'll never say that again I'll never do these things again that's what the power of the Holy Ghost gives you hallelujah amen and look all he did was say help me and Jesus said okay I'll help you amen CH if you can just say that tonight Jesus help me help me with this election or help me with this 2025 or help me help me with the Rapture or help me with this relationship or help me financially whatever it is if you just ask Jesus to help you don't you think he's going to help you amen if he helped this man who had a child that was uh trying to throw itself in the fire and drown itself in the water if Jesus cared about this man's Faith no doubt he cares about your faith too and and then look he's just like everybody else he's like he needed help he's just like Abraham he's just like Thomas I'll say like this we all we're all doubting Thomases sometimes see that's why a real person doesn't they they don't degrade Thomas because we'd all do that if we weren't there we would have all done it praise God any man you know atin and I Malachi Malachi's almost a man you know any man you know we would have done the same thing most of us would have ran right if we would have get the threat of arrest only one of us out of 12 would have went there to the Cross like John did just because that's what all men do that's what all you know all women do you know we're just human we need God's help but God is so gracious if we ask for help he'll give us help hallelujah amen glory now here's what I didn't get to this word harpazo now now we're getting into the Rapture back to the Rapture so I'm picking up where I left off the word caught up uh in in the Greek means harpazo we're going to be harpazo that's not a word but I'm just adding Ed where we're going to be harpazo in the moment of a twink of an eye we're going to be seized and carried off in a moment twink of an eye Jesus is going to come by and just snatch away as said's just going to snatch away and seize his bride off the Earth with Force earn eagerly he's in other words he's excited to do it h he's excited to get married to his bride amen he had to divorce his other bride church are you with me he had to divorce the Israel bride he's excited he's eager he's looking forward to the wedding amen hallelujah he's been waiting 2,000 years for this WD wedding Hallelujah you had to wait a long time brother lustin to get married amen I had to wait uh five years you know we we he's been waiting 2,000 years he's eagerly going to snatch his bride away Hallelujah he's going to claim that's my bride amen church he ain't going to take the he going to take the Catholic church that's not his bride Luther Methodist Baptist you know Pentecostal that's not his bride his bride is those who have the oil Hallelujah the Blood Bought Holy Ghost filled bride that's his bride amen he's going to claim that's my bride brother said in the church age book the final proof of the seven Church age messenger is those who are raptured are going to follow his message brother says it God's going to prove that we're the bride amen when we disappear Hallelujah when we're CAU away Lord willing if it's in our lifetime now all the preachers have preached it Wesley preach it Luther preach it they all preach we're going to be raptured right they all preach it amen so I got to preach it too Hallelujah and if God allows it will be raptured if not it be the next Generation they'll keep preaching it someone's going to be raptured Hallelujah that's the final proof that God sent brother Ram is that the bride will be raptured out of here hallelujah because remember he's a forerunner to the second coming like John the Baptist was a forerunner to the first coming Hallelujah so to seize it means to pluck see you pluck something away you catch it away you pull it away you take it by force Hallelujah now there's 13 verses I'm going to go through these uh fairly quickly I just want you to see the context that they're used in only two of them now are for the Rapture but I want you to see the idea here that that we get from the Greek harpazo I've never heard a preacher preach on this I hope it' be a blessing to you the first time it's used is in Matthew 11:12 and from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of violence or Heaven suffereth violence that means they were being persecuted right and the violent take it by force now here's a parallel passage to help you understand this is the same verse it's just written a different way by Luke he says the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it okay so the violent take the kingdom by force all right so that that just means they press on to it and they take God's promise isn't that what you did when you heard water baptism what' you do you went over there and you got baptized brother Austin right is that what I know I saw sister Lena do it amen she took that baptism by force amen she believed amen I didn't have to beg her well sister why don't you come get baptized right each one of you you said I'm going to take that you took it by force that's what the Bible said you you you see the kingdom of God and you press into it amen no one's got to force you or beg you to come to church or beg you to pay ties or beg you to pay offerings or anything like that or beg you to read your Bible beg you you take it by force you seize the opportunity it's mine amen this is going to be my prop for a few Services here see and every man presses into now that press doesn't mean the same as take it by force but it's just another way to look at it every time God's word is preached the real believers they press into it they become a part of it hallelujah hallelujah Glory see but see now the kingdom of God you got to snatch promises away there's times God's going to reveal something to you and you just snatch it away how you just snatch it up Hallelujah like Austin like this with this with this song today see God gave him that and he has a choice he can either toss that aside side or he can snatch it up amen right that's the kingdom of God if God reveals something to you snatch it up it's yours believe it if God reveals you he's going to heal you snatch it up and believe it praise God to save you snatch that promise up see you got you have have to have a spiritual mind here snatch up the spiritual things of God that's what God's people do church we ought to snatch up the fear of God last Sunday night hallelujah amen you are to snatch it up and you are to live differently that's what the kingdom of God's about God presents a blessing God presents a promise you've got to snatch it up just like Jesus is going to snatch us up in the Rapture like I said if you eat the book if you swallow the book death will swallow up you in life Hallelujah I'm sorry life will swallow up the death inside of you sorry I got that mixed up there too excited got to slow down here all right here's the second time harpazo used now this is bad here this is for the uh this is for the Judas scar type but I think we can all understand this in a in a in a small way when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and understands it not then cometh the wicked one and he catches away there's the same harpazo he snatches it away that which was swn in his heart doesn't the devil do that you get a little Victory and he tries to snatch that right out of your life doesn't he Church any he honest people here tonight of course you are that see that's what he does one day you can be so up on the Mountaintop and he'll try to snatch it away we got to stop him from snatching that away got to say no devil get out of my house or get away from my door I rebuke you in Jesus name you're not snatching away my blessing amen see now that's what he does to the Judah escaros so Judas believed for a while the Bible said he did he believed for a while but then when he saw the temptation of money he let the devil snatch that belief out of his heart that's what the Bible says hallelujah so see Satan tries to imitate God but God does it the right way God's got the real harpazo amen that's right church amen now how many think about this how many people we saw fall away from the message because the devil harpazo the message out of their out of their hearts numerous many people so see it's a war church it's a war this ain't a playground Hallelujah I know I laugh a lot you know sometimes we laugh we have a good time and we're brother and sisters but this is a playground this is a real Battlefield Satan trying to snatch Faith out of people's hearts amen you got to defend the the faith Hallelujah Paul said you're in a good fight of Faith Hallelujah see he snatches it people I thought had the Holy Ghost for years right and the devil will come along he'll snatch that out of their life because he they let them Hallelujah everybody see that same word harpazo the Seas eagerly take it Satan once they eagerly take blessings out of our Lives can't let him now this is a physical one uh when Jesus perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he depart again into Mountain himself alone so see the enemy was going the evil people the Pharisees were going to try to snatch him away now I like this one but he that is a hireling not the shepherd who own the Sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the Wolf catches them and scatters the Sheep okay so now we see this is what wolves do wolves will go in and they'll they'll seize on a a sheep and carry it off right and then devour it just snatch it away eagerly I showed a video of it years ago at the other Church remember the ca knows probably scar her for life for that one but you know the that's what the the wolf would run around until he'd find one sheep get away from everybody and that's the one he would attack right the one that doesn't stay in Fellowship that's why we got to stay in Fellowship right because Satan's going to harpazo that that sheep right snatch him up seize them up Hallelujah and he wants to scatter the Sheep divide them up I like this one I like this one right I will give them Jesus said I'll give them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man harpa them out of my hand hallelujah oh if you're in the hand of Jesus tonight you're in the safest hand in the universe amen nobody can grab it out of jesus' hands amen hallelujah My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to harpazo them out of my father's hand oh I love it amen beautiful and they were come up out of the water the spirit of God called away Philip harpazo him right he disappeared away from the unic as he praising God I baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Philip is harpazo out unic saw him no more and he went on his Road rejoicing her his way and There Rose a great dissension the chief Captain fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces them commanded the soldiers to go down and to harpazo him from among them to bring him into the castle so see you get the idea of of soldiers grabbing somebody seizing them and carrying away right let's apply that to the Rapture that's what Jesus is going to do for you and I hallelujah amen hallelujah so spiritually nobody can harpazo us out of jesus' hand right but then at the Rapture he's going to come down and he's going to harpazo us he's going to take us away from this sin cursed Earth hallelujah amen that's the promise of God hallelujah so here now we see philli and Paul have similar harpazo experiences I knew a man in Christ about 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such as one caught up or harpazo to the third heaven hallelujah how that he was harpazo into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter so see Paul like Phillip it wasn't their efforts to be harpazo so it ain't going to be your effort I thought somebody us should say Amen on that it was it wasn't there they didn't snatch themselves up Jesus snatched them up hallelujah hallelujah it's not going to be our effort it wasn't Enoch's effort yeah he pleased God but but that was under the blood and bulls and goats we can do a better job pleasing God because we've got the blood of Jesus and we got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah right we've got better promises the Bible says we got a better Covenant Hallelujah well surely we can be raptured Hallelujah if Enoch was raptured on the blood of bulls and goats but see caught up see God he whis he whisks us away he pulls us out of this Dimension he pulls us out of Leo deia he does it it's his powers not by our might not by power but by the harpazo of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen now here's the one that that's our text that's the fifth Rapture and I I'll remind you again these six raptures you might have it memorized but if not you're going to get a good review here tonight then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up harpazo together with them in the cloud now see harpazo together that kind of makes us think we'll see the dead in Christ for brother said maybe around 40 days we'll see we don't know he said maybe a month and a half he said in one 1962 quote I got that quote I always save it if you want it let me know I think brother B said about a month and a half we'll see the dead in Christ now it's not thus sayith the Lord but it it would be a it would be uh a pattern like he did at the first resurrection right or at the uh the resurrection of Christ to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord so he snatches us away so we'll be with him Hallelujah aren't you glad he's going to pull you out of this Dimension into his Dimension and then you're always going to be with him hallelujah oh we're not going to be around the devil thank God Amen we're not going to be around uh the this political system praise God we're not going to be around sin and deuch and lasciviousness we'll be with the Holy One we'll be with Jesus we'll be with our husband Jesus Christ Hallelujah we'll always be with him Hallelujah that's the fifth Rapture got two more on harpazo I've already showed you 11 here's 12 Jude 1:23 and others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire see church that this is this is what we need to think about tonight is there anybody God puts on our heart where we need to go tell them you know you're going to be lost if you don't get saved and we've got to use some actual persuasion to get them to be saved is everybody with me you got some people you might have to use persuasion to pull them out of the fires of hell and Temptation and lust and fear and greed and all these things that Pride all the things that are gripping them you might have to use like that brother I remember that brother that 76 year old brother down there in h Kentucky ah what's his name now I can't remember his name but anyways it's it's almost like he said they almost had to drag me to church well then there it is right there church if someone I'll say it like this if God leads you to drag somebody to church you drag them to church because some of them are going to be won by harpazo seizing them and bringing to church that's why if you're a parent you got children you got to seize them to come to church don't let don't don't let them sit at home as when they get older right you got to harpaz them you got to bring them to the house of God hallelujah no matter what what you got to do like I said uh look at cam Simon and me as preachers my mom beat us with a bat my mom uh sprayed us with vinegar uh my mom did all kinds of things to get us she harpazo us to go to church amen hallelujah and look what happened God did God worked it out Hallelujah and now there's nowhere else I'd rather be than in the house of God hallelujah see because it's it it's just the leading of the Lord some people you got to almost harpazo to church so that's something you and I should think about tonight maybe we'll pray for that in the service because it's just so unique it's such a scripture right and remember we get the picture of lot don't we he's got to be dragged out the Angels if I just excuse you the Angels got to come on lot let's go let's go let's go destruction's coming that's the picture that we get right they somebody hates somebody sins so much it's like come on come on up to the altar see that will do somebody good you remember uh brother Jose would remember but if you haven't listened to it Perry Green's testimony he was uh he was a good friend of brother brandom but anyways his testimony was his parents would force him to come to prayer meetings because he wasn't you know he just he was he was a teenager wasn't ready he said but week after week they prayed for him he said one time he was just at the altar praying he wasn't expecting anything he said they come by these old Saints laid hands on him and PR pressed on him and prayed for him until he was filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah remember Aaron's testimony remember Aaron the preacher from Pennsylvania well maybe he didn't tell you the testimony but he told me he said when he wasn't saved he was raised in the message he said he went Wayward he said just call him home from a college break and he come down and sit there and just you know he he was going to go to church he had plans to do all these sinful things right after church and he said something the preacher said about uh getting saved Drew him up to the Altar and they pulled him up to the Altar and got him saved and his life has never been the same sense the church said see sometimes you got to harpazo them to church say it like that and you can go with it however you feel led Hallelujah I'm always going to harple my children to church no matter how old they get amen as long as they're in my house amen now Revelation 125 the last Harpo in the Bible this is the fourth Rapture and she brought forth a man child that was Jesus right the Jewish Church the in the type the woman with the 12 stars is Israel Israel brought forth a Manchild right is Mary who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up harpos unto God and to his throme that's the fourth Rapture all right who's got the six raptures memorized you always break it up into three right you know Elijah I'm Enoch Elijah Jesus alone to present his sacrifice remember he said don't touch me I got to present myself to the father but then after he comes back now there's three three more raptures after that Jesus with the Old Testament Saints Gentile Saints that's the one we're looking for and then Moses and Elijah are raptured uh three and a half days after they're killed they're raised from the dead and they're raptured in the sight of everybody hallelujah hallelujah all right so now you got a good harpazo preaching okay now you know what it means it's snatch away eagerly right it's I'm going to take this by force this is mine Hallelujah this ain't somebody else's this is mine Church you belong to Jesus you are his you're the one he loves amen you're God's beloved Hallelujah well of course he's going to snatch you away from the tribulation you're the one that he loves ah now I thought I would show you what did this actually look like in the scripture so when Jesus was caught up this is what it looked like when he had spoken these things while they beheld him remember they upon the mountain he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight so Jesus starts Rising off the ground and he goes up to some cloud in the sky then they don't see him anymore that's how that that was the fourth Rapture right there Hallelujah some some way maybe they I I don't think they saw the Old Testament Saints the Bible say they just saw Jesus but somehow those Old Testament Saints they met him up in the air there individually in the the spiritual realm and then Jesus led them into heaven open up ye gates over Everlasting doors let the king of glory come in hallelujah hallelujah amen they say who is this king of glory the lord Mighty strong in battle hallelujah amen open up those Heaven Gates the king of glory is coming and oh one day Church Jesus is going to lead us into heaven the king of glory is going to lead his bride into heaven we'll be right behind him Hallelujah the king of Glory Hallelujah Heaven's Gates will open for us hallelujah cuz we'll be behind the king of glory praise God Heaven can't keep him out he's the creator of Heaven amen hallelujah praise God now getting back to John rich and Tucker and you guys remember Tucker and John Rich that I showed you on Sunday okay so he gave two proofs that there's no pre-tribulation Rapture but anybody that knows their Bible knows they're wrong right anybody that I I should say like this that's what I always say on the videos any honest person knows brother man was a real man of God that because they're not being honest right any honest person knows that Matthew 24 and second Thessalonians chapter two do not teach that there's no pre-tribulation Rapture any honest person knows that all right I'm not saying that to be arrogant I'm just saying that because that's the truth hallelujah I'm going to show it to you tonight so let's read through these get your Bible go to Matthew 24 now while you're turning there Matthew 24 has always struck me as just an amazing chapter right uh and I wrote this down three years ago I was reading my Bible one morning that's my that's my journal now I don't keep a journal anymore because I just got it all memorized now I did it for so many days you know I kind of in my mind I got all the things I got to get done then everything else if I got time I'll get to that but I had to use journals for about four years you know to be disciplined and time management where's time management that's a good request we look at down it took me about four or five years but now I got it just all buil into my head now I don't have to do the journal anymore unless I really get overwhelmed I haven't had to do it since uh I don't know last year maybe April so on this day February uh 17th 2021 I read Matthew 24 and I I knew brother random said now brother ROM got it from Clarence Lin I'm going to show it to you it doesn't make brother ROM uh a bad person he said he read Lin amen he told us what he did now the revelations were given with thus say the Lord all the thus say the Lord Revelations were different from Larin any honest person knows that like I had some critics a few weeks ago saying Jesse you always just repeat the same things that there's 38 differences on the seals and I'm like that's because none of you can answer it I'm going to keep using that because none of you can answer it none of you have any objection to prove me wrong I'm gonna I'm Gonna Be Right Hallelujah why would I give up a good argument well I better they're tired of that argument even though it's true I guess I'll give it up what a bunch of nonsense these people these people they have no answers for okay so what in that morning in my notes I looked at verses two and I looked at I read Verses 4 to 14 and we'll go through this here uh but here if you've listened to the uh let me go uh yeah let me go here if you've listened to the fourth no it's the Sixth Seal yeah if you've listened to the six seal lately brother random shows how the six seals are in Matthew 24 did you know that you remember that brother Ram said Jesus preached the six seals everybody's thinking out there good trying to remember when you listen to last last time you listen to The Sixth Seal and this is where brother brother ad is almost quoting verbatim Clarence Larin in that sermon at the beginning before he gets to the revelation of The Sixth Seal okay so this is Clarence arin's book U look he's said Matthew 24 1-3 Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto him see not all these things verely I said Toto you there shall not be here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down now here it is right first three so crucial And he as he sat upon the Mount of Oles the disciples came unto him privately saying they asked him three question questions now everybody remember this when shall these things be that's one question and what shall be the sign of thy coming that's the Rapture and third and of the end of the world that's Armageddon there's three questions in there but John Rich says oh no this whole chapter is just about the Rapture no it's not there's three different events in there I mean it's just it's it's so immature I don't I don't know what other word to say childish it's so childish it's so ignorant to say that all these things are the one and same event it's that that's so that's so childish it's so uninformed right but we wouldn't know it except God sent us a prophet and then brother found that from Lin but then God gave brother Ram the thus say the Lord Revelation on all the Seven Seals now if you remember who remembers how many seals did Brother random and Lin agree on does anybody remember no okay was a good review for everybody then all right great I'm uh I'm helping you get a little sharper I'm sharper than your swords tonight okay there's one they agreed on out of seven there's Seven Seals brother Ram only agreed with Lin on one and that was The Sixth Seal because the Sixth Seal is the easiest to see it's tribulation right moon is uh moon is turned to blood Sun's darkened you know uh they're hiding in caves you know uh they say oh hide us from the Lamb hide us from the face of lamb when is the Lamb coming in Wrath at the Battle get so this is the easiest one to understand but brother Braham differed on six out of the seven and that's what the accuser of brother Braham just want to ignore they just want to they want me to move on from that but I'm not moving on from the truth I wouldn't I would never move on from the truth okay so there's three questions in there and then brother said the first seal brother quotes this for btim he says the first seal is in Matthew 244 and5 Jesus answerers to them take heed that no man deceive you that's the white horse rider right deceive he looks white he looks like he's holy but he's not he's a liar he's a devil he's the Antichrist he's deceiver for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and he quotes the first seal Hallelujah Lin said the first seal is right after the Rapture to Lin the first seal hasn't even happened yet for brother random it happened 2,000 years ago right after the day of Pentecost the church said we're not following cunningly devised wives fables we're following thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah amen now the second seal is in Matthew 246 and 7 you should hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for Nations shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom that's the second seal all right now I'm not going to read the rest because I actually couldn't find them they only had this page okay but I'm going to go back to this here's a timeline this is what John rich and Tucker Carlson just don't know because they don't know Terence Larin and they don't know God's Prophet brother brandham I hope they know him someday they asked Jesus asked I'm sorry they asked Jesus three questions when shall not be here left one stone upon another that happened in ad70 when Titus the Roman uh General came and destroyed the temple that already happened right and they asked him what should be the sign of the end of the world that's Armageddon sometime after 2,000 right they ask him what should be the sign of thy coming that's the Rapture there's three questions in here and that's what they those men they just don't know Hallelujah all right so everybody see that there's three questions in there there's not one question there's three questions Hallelujah all right now get your Bibles here now let's read acts I'm sorry no Matthew 24 sorry now you'll see my question marks these are my honest and I still have the same question today I don't know which of these questions do all the verses apply to and God doesn't have to put everything in chronological order he can mix things up remember anybody remember Joel chapter 2 and the church said brother Bram said verses 23- 26 are the latter rain the Rapture verse 28 was the day of Pentecost 2,000 years ago so the order isn't chronological the order is flipped and who's read Joel one lately anybody read Joel one that's the that's the army of the 144,000 Jews that's even after Joel 228 it's totally mixed up Joel's prophecy is all mixed up hallelujah praise God Amen because it's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent all these people that believe it's chronological they let women cut their hair come on Church they believe God's three persons amen like that sign uh Genevie saw it tonight there's this there's this meme it said they have a sign it says uh one coffee per person and so God walks up or Jesus walks up and says can I have three coffees because I'm three persons I like that one that's a good sense of humor right there it shows that the it shows the insanity of three persons it's insane it's polytheistic it's tritheism monic teaching amen Jesus says oh can I have three because my father and the holy ghost need a coffee too one coffee per person what a bunch of trash my goodness I'm be a little harsh tonight but that's got to how the way it's going here tonight by God's grace now Matthew 24 if I could just get there almost there now verse one through three we already read verse three is the three questions okay now the first seal was verses four and five uh the second seal was verse six now the third and fourth seal are verse seven I'm going to read that for nation should Rise Against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom there should be famines right there's Co I'm sorry that's not Co that's that's famine and pestilence is there's Co right any pestilence that includes the Spanish Flu from a hundred years ago any pestilence or germ disease is right there and earthquakes in diverse places there's that 1964 earthquake when Alaska almost sunk into the ocean brother BR talked about I saw I I got brother Jose got the magazine in there you want to look at it after church this a Life Magazine 1964 you can see all the pictures look at verse eight and all these are the beginning of Sorrows okay now that's why we said Co was just a birth pain but it wasn't the it wasn't the last sign before the rapure it's just a birth pain it's a prefigure showing there is going to come a mark of the beast right there is going to come this one world there is going to come this forcing down on people right okay now I put on this list I hadn't known you know I don't know all the answers but let's read uh let's read the next verse I thought verses nine to 14 were about uh the Rapture now I could be wrong but let's read them then then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and should be hated of all Nations for my name's sake okay so people being this is either this is either the Jews being killed or the Christians being killed now hate of all Nations now that makes me think Israel because all nations are going to come against Israel as Zechariah says verse 10 and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many now that sounds like what we have right now like I told you all these false prophets on TV prophesying all these things and they get it wrong every single time literally Church literally Benny hin and this other false prophet named Chris Reed within the matter of a few months they both prophesied and said the Lord showed them there's going to be a two-state solution in the Gaza bank and Israel and church literally within two months the Hamas Israel war started that's how God shames these false prophets the one the Chris Reed guy said oh the Lord showed me a newspaper and it said a two-state deal is reached between 2022 and 2023 what a lie from the devil Benny Hinn said uh oh there's going to be a two-state solution here in 2023 and you better send me your money uh uh because then God's going to bless you and there's going to be a wealth transfer and all the Christians are going to get rich when this big world worldwide Revival what a liar they're lying to try to get money thank God that we believe the truth hallelujah let no man deceive you don't let any preacher deceive you you stand on the word of God be faithful to God's word God will back up his word hallelujah don't believe these false Liars or these false prophets and Liars remember the Bible said they just want to their God is their belly they're only after a payday that's their God their God is Not Jesus all right verse uh 12 and because iniquity shall bound the love of many shall wax cold and he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved it's like that other internet Prophet that who calls me the Pharisee of akan he said he said thus sayith the Lord by 2023 Joseph Bram has to repent or God's going to snatch the kingdom out of his hand he's going to lose his his place now look here we are it's almost 2025 God still hasn't snatched it out of his hand that's a lying Spirit right trying to and then he interprets it some other way it was Billy Paul I'm sorry snatching Billy Paul out of Joseph's hand that makes no sense it it just it makes no sense right these people don't know what they're doing they're not hearing from God they're not prophets God sent us a prophet his name was William brandham Hallelujah and we're just preachers here trying to rightly divide the word of Truth stay in our position Hallelujah just stay in your position and watch the miraculous move into action Hallelujah that's right our God is tremendous amen I'm just giving you some examples not even in my notes really not in my notes at all see you have to endure the same shall be saved that see now that makes it look like uh Israel but we'll see verse 14 and this gospel so now that looks like the the Gentiles the gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come all right so that was my guess three years ago it seems like Verses 4 to 14 are about the Rapture but is looks like there's some overlap there I don't know for sure now I put 15 to 21 I'm not sure I'm not sure on these ones when ye oh yeah okay so this looks like when uh this looks like when Titus came when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy Place whoo reth let him understand now that could have been Titus standing there in uh herod's Temple it could have been that but it also could have a comp compound prophecy that could be when the pope Antichrist stands in the new Jewish temple because there can be compound prophecy who so reth let them understand let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house so what event would be so serious when a when a demon filed person stands at the temple that they don't have time to pack a bag that to me sounds like Titus that sounds like what Titus did remember Titus surrounded them remember for four years and he starved them out remember and but all the Christians were out before Titus came this sounds like Titus is coming the question was when is it going to be when one Stone's not left upon another okay Verse 18 neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes verse 19 and woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days see you see that would be of course when Titus was there because he was going to slay everybody see that's the way I look at it as far as I can understand it verse 20 but pray that ye that your flight be not in Winter neither on the Sabbath day for when they shall for then shall be Great Tribulation such as not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be now that sounds like Daniel 12 ver1 the Great Tribulation so see some of these verses sound like they apply to Titus others sound like they apply to arm get in but see I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know the actual breaking right because remember this Sunday I read you Isaiah 25:8 it doesn't say anything about the Gentiles but you and I are trusting that death swalled up in life is our ticket out of leoa Hallelujah and Paul pulled it out of there and never that doesn't say Isaiah didn't say the Gentile Rapture he just says death is swallowed up in Victory Hallelujah I like malach had a good thought on Sunday night we're sharing our favorite thoughts the next verse says about how we must wait for him and that's what the wise virgin did they waited for the Lord that was a good I thought that was a good thought there Hallelujah right because they're waiting they got to wait for us coming Lord when are you coming I got my oil I I got my lamp trimmed I got extra oil I'm waiting for the coming and then he comes back and we're ready Hallelujah all right now that's something that's it's good thought there I like that and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened so God is actually going to shorten the days so people can be saved isn't that interesting it's just amazing verse 23 then if any man say here unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not now brother Ram uses of course verse 23 and 24 to talk about this day right anybody listen to anointed ones at the end times lately what what is brother ad's verse right here Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise false Christ that means false anointed ones they have the genuine anointing but they're false like balam like Judas and false prophets and shall show great one signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect if it were possible it's not possible Hallelujah that's brother R's verse for the anointed ones of the end times for the Gentiles Hallelujah so see how these three there's three questions but all these verses they're kind of just thrown in there they're not chronologically in order right Hallelujah TR everybody can see that by God's grace now verse 25 behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he's in the desert go not forth behold he's in the secret Chambers believe it not so I thought this all applied now I thought these verses apply to the Rapture verse 27 for as lightning cometh out of the East and shineth unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be now what does that remind you of the lightning what's that remind you of the twinkling of the eye it's so fast how many you see I saw lightning this summer I'm like oh I wish I could have taped that rewind it back I just want to see that again you it goes so fast I want to enjoy it again that's that's why this part seems like the Rapture it's G to be so fast right but there's false prophets false christs now verse 28 now here it is brother uses this all the time for the Rapture for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together when when the lightning comes at the at the coming of the son of man this this fast coming of Jesus this lightning coming verse 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be dark and the moon shall not give her light now what's that remind of that's the six seal that's almost the exact same words of the six seal so see you have all the you have the three events and all these details are kind of mixed up in here and the uh it's hidden from the foolish it's hidden from people uh that are focused on denomination and and and money and all these things but it's revealed to the bride because she's become like a child all right and the moon shall not give her light verse 29 and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth Rejoice did I read that right no they shall mourn but the Bible says when he comes we'll Rejoice Hallelujah these are three different comings amen hallelujah the coming of Jesus is called a blessed hope not a Mourning that must mean there's a different coming if some people are mourning it can't be the same coming as us getting what we've hoped for praise God the joy of being snatched away praise God oh my hallelujah it's like honey on the honeycomb Hallelujah and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory that's Armageddon and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds and from one end of Heaven to the other that's also in Revelation about the Jews all right now I got verses 32 okay no there's yeah 32s seems to be about the six seal yes because it talks about the Fig Tree who's the Fig Tree Church does anybody remember Israel yes the Fig Tree is Israel so verses 32 talks about the the the Fig Tree okay now look at verse 35 Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away now look at verse 36 now we get back to the Rapture there's the Rapture again it went from Israel 144,000 back to the Rapture of the Gentiles but in that day and hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of nowh so also shall be the coming of the son of man doesn't that sound familiar that's this is the parallel to Luke 17:30 right brother R's Ministry for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered in the ark and nunah until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be well that's a different coming right right that's a different coming there than the one we read earlier where the sun is blackened and all these it's a different coming it's the Rapture coming right you got the Rapture coming you got us coming to the 144,000 when When They Mourn from house to house and a fountain is open the House of David then you got another coming at Armageddon when they all mourn praise God oh it's going to take some wisdom hallelujah it's going to take the Holy Ghost for people to understand Hallelujah that's right right now verse 40 41 42 43 44 what do I got there I got yeah all seems to be the Rapture down to verse 51 right because what do you have you have uh uh one shall be in the field in verse 40 one will be in the field one taken one left there's the Rapture right one is snatched away one is not Hallelujah Glory verse 41 two women should be grinding at the Mill the one should be taken the other left that's the Rapture watch ye therefore for you know not what hour your Lord come now church this might be deeper but I wrote about in the chapter if people believe Jesus is coming in the tribulation period they can know the day he's coming because they can count three and a half years and they can know the day he's coming right if they believe he's coming at the end of the tribulation period they can know the days coming because the Bible tells us 1,260 days they can know the day so these scriptures that say no man knows the day it has to refer to the Gentile church amen it has to refer to the Rapture Hallelujah because they can everybody else can know they can know the day the two witnesses are going to be killed because that's after three and a half years right every other coming they can know the day except the Rapture coming amen oh my we're getting deep and Rich here tonight Hallelujah well Hallelujah now verse 45 is what I need to be a faithful who's this faithful wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over the household to give them his meat in due season this is every five-fold preacher I'm trying to give you the meat in due season to help you get ready for the Rapture I'm not giving you Baptist Doctrine I'm not giving you Lutheran Doctrine I'm not giving you Methodist Doctrine I'm giving you Bible brother man calls it the bride Doctrine Hallelujah I'm giving you the word of God hallelujah that's right church and like I've said everyone that's come in this door the since for 18 years that's received the word their lives have been changed Hallelujah that's right even to our children amen whoever will receive the word of God their lives will be changed because the Holy Ghost is giving us the meat in due season hallelujah how do I know because I'm strong by the meat of the word I'm not falling into scandals I'm not falling into all these sins like all these other preachers why because I'm eating on the food in Du Seas my life is ready your life should be ready we should be ready in season out of season we should be watching and praying for the coming of the Lord amen hallelujah that's right what does he do in verse 47 he rewards him he makes him ruler over all his Goods but the evil servant verse 48 says Ah the raptures delayed then he begins to Smite the people and eat and drink and be spiritually drunken remember you can be drunken with lies you can be drunken with lust you can be drunken with greed all the don't have to be natural drunk drunkenness right Hallelujah remember the Holy Ghost just told apparently just told Paul Griffin that my people need to re be rebuked this church is everybody listening now the Holy Ghost just told Paul that we need to be rebuked to have our first love but that we would receive it amen and the church said Hallelujah everybody with me see so just because we get a rebuking word or just because something harsh that don't mean it's not God Amen it means God's helping his children get the nonsense out of your lives let's serve God hallelujah let's eat the meat of the word praise God let's get our gifts in order amen let's everybody find out the gifts and invest in your gifts be faithful to God receive something from God hallelujah oh Hallelujah but see all those that get drunken and they serve themselves at the time of the Rapture Jesus will come in a time when they're not looking for him in verse 50 and then they're uh given their portion with the Hypocrites in verse 51 Hallelujah did anybody see anything in there that says there will not be a pre-tribulation Rapture I didn't see anything in there that says that but that's that's what they say now second Thessalonians is is even more proof it's even more obvious that there's nothing in that chapter saying there's no pre-tribulation Rapture I'm almost on my hour okay boy Busy Body okay now here's what I was telling you there's at least three more comings of Jesus there's the second coming the Gentile bride I'm talking about his physical body now his his glorified body I should say maybe that's a better way the glorified body will come to meet us in the air but then he's coming to the 144,000 he's going to show them the palms of his hands amen and then he's going to come back on armag again on the White Horse with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is the word of God thank God we've got the word of God today Hallelujah that's his name so there's at least four comings now that's what I thought after he burns over fire he'll just stay down here I don't think the Millennium is another coming I don't know I could be wrong but even if it is well then that's fine that's just that's a fifth coming then I mean it doesn't really matter what matters is that there is a pre-tribulation Rapture that we've got to get ready for praise God like all those scriptures said the preachers have to give us the meat and du season who doesn't need the fear of the Lord is anybody got so much fear of God you don't need any anybody going to raise their hand on that one I sure hope not I might have to rebuke you after service uh you got some pride in your life brother or sister you got some pride in your life that's let's meet and due season praise God that's what we need to overcome we need to be so hateful of sin that if something pops up on our phone or a screen or something we'll just look right away we won't even won't even give it a second look that's the fear of the Lord all right now let me see how many slides I got here I'm G to exit out of here yeah Cuts me off okay what that's strange the settings yeah why don't we just close with that one here we'll just close with this one here we'll just close with second Thessalonians chapter 2 because I'm already almost at an hour okay now bless you second Thessalonians 2 never says the bride will see the Antichrist that's what John Rich told Tucker and that's not what it says we just got to read verses 1 through 12 not see I don't know what Bible version he was he did not have a King James version maybe that's why Lydia he he's got the wrong Bible I'm going to preach on that again brother Cam and I are working on that and I already I already showed you some remember I showed you some of those examples from the new versions uh they had that that PDF on it with the dragon on it you know the new versions and how they're they're all corrupted 2 Thessalonians 2 now if somebody could please show me where the Bible says in here that that the Believers will see the the Antichrist well then I'm I'm open to be corrected after church okay please don't correct me in front of the live audience here give me the grace to go into the room and we can pray about it together verse verse one now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ now that's beg you we we persuade you and by our gathering together unto him see that's what we're doing we're Gathering to Christ right now we're Gathering to him that you be not soon shaken in your mind or troubled now that ties it right with that double-mindedness I was talking about on Sunday night we're going to preach on that pretty soon I was studying on that today right all you sisters those good questions see Paul tells him because that's what we're going to battle we're going to battle mind battles they seem to shake us and like Co shook us or whatever more you know things Shake us all the rumors about wars and the Israeli War Hamas War uh Russian war and Ukraine war that surely shook me for a little bit you know we and Paul says don't try not to get shaken in your mind about things like I said now the reason that shook me was because these well-known preachers all said now in 20 22 they said uh oh the Rapture is just a few days away that really shook me up because everybody respects these preachers I I respected them too now I've got less respect for him now right and they've also got another prophecy I'm waiting to see if it comes to pass they prophesied a person with fourth deegree cancer is going to be healed and so far that was months ago that was that was five months ago and he still has fourth fourth uh four stage cancer okay and they said the Lord said he was going to be healed now if that man dies I'm gonna make a video on him because that's a lying Spirit unless that person repents I'll try to reach out to them first but see you you we got to be very careful because we don't want to be shaken in our mind are troubled verse two neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand anybody see yet where it says we're going to see the Antichrist anybody did anybody say that did Paul say the Thessalonians are going to see the Antichrist no verse three let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first that's what we see today right the apostasy the the Turning Away the backsliding that's what that word means turn away the backslide the churches have turned away from the word of God right and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition okay so there's there's Antichrist right there he's not called the Antichrist in the Bible he's called the son of predition the wicked one he's called the false prophet see so that day the Rapture won't uh I'm sorry uh which one is it yeah the Rapture won't happen until they fall away first and then the son of man I'm sorry the son of predition will be revealed who oppos and exalts himself above all that's called God or that's worshiped so that he as God sth in Temple Of God showing himself that he is God now Paul never says you're going to see that he just tells them what the Antichrist is going to do he's going to sit in the Jewish temple and say that he's God he's goingon to have all these lying Miracles they're going to have it on they're going to have it on their cell phones well look the pope did this look at this miracle the pope did look at that Miracle the pope did they're going to say look he's the he's God he's going to solve all of our financial problems our violence problems our safety problems uh our our clothing problems all these problems he's going to solve it because look he's a miracle worker I got the proof of it right here and Jesus said by their fruits they're known their lies and their false doctrines right and their deception they're known by their fruits Hallelujah verse five remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things so Paul already told him face to face but he writes him another letter to let him know there has to come a falling way first then the son of man there something then the son of predition is revealed and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time so he says he says you know God is withholding this Antichrist from rising up until it's his time aren't you glad church I'm so glad God has withhold held the Antichrist he's going to do some terrible damage right he's do some terrible damage but God is withholding him so the church ages can go on this is he's been holding him for 2,000 years there's my hour going going try to close verse S for the mystery of iniquity that means lasciviousness or lawlessness or there's no law there's no rules in Christianity you can live however you want and Grace will be extended to you no sir right God will have Grace on you if you repent Hallelujah and you try to serve God for the mystery of iniquity doth already work Paul said it's already working this is written around 54 ad right uh 24 years after Jesus had left the scene only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way so that means the Holy Spirit the holy spirit will let until the spirit of God is taken out of the way that's right because when God takes a spirit from the Gentiles what happens the spirit goes up right the Saints go up and then Satan comes down verse eight and then shall that Wicked be revealed so see once the Holy Ghost is taken out of the way then that Wicked one's revealed the church said right there's the proof Paul never said that we see the Antichrist Paul said the Holy Ghost is taken away and then the wicked one is revealed that's just like brother randam talked the the bride goes up Satan comes down because he knows he has a short season that's right Church Hallelujah never one time does Paul say well well Church you're going to see the Antichrist he never said that he just tells the conditions of when the Antichrist comes yeah yes and then verse 8 and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy him with the brightness of a coming when that that's Armageddon right remember at the end of Armageddon what does he do he throws the Antichrist in the Lake of Fire H Allelujah and the Beast right the false prophet and the Beast get thrown in the lake of fire at the at Armageddon Hallelujah verse n even him Who coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders see all these false prophets today you've seen them do it have you seen them do it they have people in wheelchairs come up and they abuse these people in wheelchairs they make them stand up and say oh God's going to heal you look they took a few steps and they sit them down and say oh you're going to get healed eventually and they're just hurting these people they never get well or I've seen it where they pray for them and they you know how you they pray for them and they fall over apparently they pray for the people in wheelchairs and they fall over and everybody rejoices and they pick them up and they're not even healed right the Bible says false prophets are God's judgment on the people because they love lies and so God gives them what they want so that means a real preacher is God's gift to us amen hallelujah brother R was God's gift to us hallelujah it's exactly right verse 10 and with all deceivable of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved see all these people that take the Antichrist they're they're going to love unrighteousness they don't want the truth that's why God is allowing them to get the Antichrist because they don't love the word they don't care about the word they didn't receive the love of the truth verse 11 and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion think God is going to send them a lie yes if Church even if us us in here because we've seen it we've seen people turn from the message and leave if even us if we don't receive the truth and we don't want the truth God will give us the lie that we want I'm saying we because we had people leave this church that believe lies now God's not going to force anybody to believe you got to want to believe you got to love the truth hallelujah that's Stern that's that's that's that's that that that's strict but that's the truth hallelujah God actually gives them a reprobate mind and gives them the lie that they want to believe God help us to receive the truth God will give them the strong delusion they want that's what they want because they won't receive the love of the truth that they should believe a lie God God sent that lying Spirit right to the four the the Hebrew I'm sorry the uh Baal prophets with Micaiah right God sent that lying Spirit right the Bible said the evil spirit from the Lord went on Saul and troubled him because he wanted it verse 12 that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in
