[0:00] reason characters in the Bible that are
[0:02] tied together it's just it's just
[0:03] beautiful to see how

[0:11] how many believe the Bibles thou saith
[0:13] the Lord praise God
[0:14] praise God
[0:16] I certainly believe that I believe it's
[0:17] a infallible book I believe it's an
[0:19] eternal book praise God I believe

[0:22] will have all eternity to show us even
[0:24] more of his love and his grace praise
[0:26] God laying right here on the pages of

[2:41] Lord Here For Your Glory in Jesus
[2:43] Christ's name and the saint said
[2:45] amen God bless you as you're being
[2:46] seated praise God
[2:49] so let's look to uh
[2:52] the Lord here from the book of
[2:53] Colossians and like I said I'll tie a
[2:54] few important stories together as you
[2:56] may you may have already known here
[2:59] by the grace of God I'm just checking
[3:01] any text sometimes I get text during the
[3:03] song service okay
[3:06] all right so let's look at part 10 here
[3:08] and we may finish tonight like I said we
[3:09] may we'll see how far we go
[3:12] by God's grace
[3:14] so chapter one we had Paul's greeting
[3:17] his prayer for the Saints that's the
[3:18] prayer I prayed over the Amish community
[3:19] down there
[3:21] that they would be complete in all the
[3:23] will of God then we see Jesus Christ
[3:26] Supreme deity we see the power of Jesus
[3:28] cross now this will come in to play
[3:30] later I'm sorry yeah I have quotes today
[3:32] sorry about that
[3:34] um
[3:36] in other words I want you to notice how
[3:38] does he address a church that's mostly
[3:40] Gentile there are some Jews here I want
[3:42] you to notice how does Paul write to
[3:45] mostly gentiles
[3:47] it's not something to consider as we
[3:48] come to the close of this book here
[3:50] you'll see why in just a moment here
[3:52] so he greets them prays for them he
[3:54] focuses on the Supreme deed of Christ
[3:56] remember as creator of all things
[3:58] all things were made by him and for him
[4:00] praise God
[4:01] and the Bible said the fullness of the
[4:03] godhead dwelt in him bodily amen and
[4:07] then we saw the mystery of Christ in us
[4:08] then he ends chapter one with the
[4:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a mystery
[4:12] hid from ages church I don't know about
[4:13] you but I'm glad I live in the age when
[4:15] this is revealed praise God I appreciate
[4:17] the Old Testament Saints but they were
[4:19] lacking power that we have
[4:20] right and thank God God can spare our
[4:23] lives from some of the scars that they
[4:24] had to go through
[4:26] but remember it's all God's choice we're
[4:27] not better we're just chosen for this
[4:28] time
[4:29] right but I just want to thank God that
[4:31] I could have the baptism of the Holy
[4:33] Ghost on this side hallelujah praise God
[4:35] just to save my life from shame and
[4:38] despair and uh and just disgrace by the
[4:42] grace of God now of course all my sins
[4:44] are disgraced but uh the major sins we'd
[4:46] say like you know Moses's murder Abraham
[4:49] or David's murder adultery uh you know
[4:53] you get into some of these uh Old
[4:54] Testament Saints and some of the
[4:55] testimonies they had you know of course
[4:57] they were wonderful Saints as well but
[4:59] I'm thankful for the baptism of the Holy
[5:01] Ghost that's what I'm trying to say
[5:01] chapter two we looked at the treasures
[5:04] all the treasures of God are in Christ
[5:06] the godhead and then we saw there's
[5:08] three areas they had to overcome and
[5:10] this I say church this fits our church
[5:12] more than maybe other letters Paul wrote
[5:15] think about that you know the galatian
[5:16] church there's all legalism legalism
[5:18] legalism Jews getting back in right you
[5:20] must be circumcised that doesn't deal
[5:21] with us
[5:22] right we're not bound
[5:24] Jewish teachers coming in or trying to
[5:26] get us back to the law
[5:28] but we are battling enticing words right
[5:31] as we saw with other churches you know
[5:32] people falling away
[5:34] or you know leaving the truth you know
[5:36] enticing they're enticing words
[5:38] right they're tempting they sound uh
[5:40] they sound sane
[5:42] they sound legitimate right but it's not
[5:45] taking in the full truth of God's word
[5:48] right and then overcome philosophies now
[5:51] it depends which you know depends which
[5:53] uh
[5:55] kind of depends what what uh kind of
[5:57] family you're in whether you learn about
[5:59] philosophy growing up or not
[6:00] you know
[6:02] so some people might be affected by that
[6:03] if you're a reader you know if you were
[6:05] raised in a in a educated family we'd
[6:08] say you might battle that or Jewish
[6:11] legalism
[6:13] again that's not really us uh it's not
[6:15] really impacting us
[6:17] but it does impact the Amish community
[6:19] because they are they were so legal it
[6:21] was similar to like a legalism that the
[6:23] Jews would have where they controlled
[6:24] your closed colors you know your horse
[6:26] colors whether you can have electricity
[6:28] in the house or outside the house or
[6:32] wherever you can have it you know it was
[6:34] just so much legalism
[6:36] man-made Creeds well you're only holy if
[6:39] you do this you're only holy if you do
[6:40] exactly what I say
[6:42] and it was it was it was the like Jesus
[6:45] said it's the Gentiles lording over the
[6:47] people
[6:48] right so they live under fear rather
[6:51] than freedom
[6:52] praise God the only one we got to fear
[6:54] is Jesus right
[6:56] fear fear of God it's fear but in the
[6:58] fear of God is also happiness
[7:00] amen praise God
[7:02] but you know you've gotten illegalism
[7:03] when you fear the man you feel you fear
[7:06] of your pastor more than God
[7:07] we're supposed to love one another
[7:09] respect one another
[7:10] but the only one word to fear is God
[7:13] right fear of the Lord
[7:15] but see that's how denominations start
[7:17] that's how even Cults are right they
[7:19] fear the man a cult will fear the man
[7:21] more than God really because they think
[7:22] that man is God's image to them on this
[7:25] earth right
[7:28] uh and then you know here's something
[7:30] where we may battle you know mysticism
[7:31] you know people say well I had a dream
[7:33] or I saw a vision or I talk to angels
[7:36] you know what happens in the message you
[7:38] know people I had a dream of brother
[7:40] Brandon well
[7:41] that doesn't matter how does it line up
[7:43] with the word of God
[7:44] you know I've had a dream about brother
[7:46] random too but you know you know we
[7:48] can't take everything as thus saith the
[7:50] Lord we got to take everything back to
[7:52] the word we've got to wait on the Lord
[7:54] and then we'll renew our strength that
[7:56] we wait upon the Lord
[7:57] praise God just wait on it
[8:00] I'll pray about it those are four great
[8:02] words I'll pray about it and whenever
[8:04] God answers that it takes all the
[8:05] pressure off you right you say I'll pray
[8:08] about it I'm just waiting on God
[8:09] takes all the pressure off we don't have
[8:11] an answer yet it's not up to me it's up
[8:13] to God it takes all the pressure off you
[8:15] amen
[8:17] trusting in God and I remember
[8:18] asceticism but chapter four is where
[8:21] we're at now you know uh the we look at
[8:23] the Believers I'm sorry chapter three no
[8:25] we're not on this we already passed this
[8:26] the Believers focus on the Heavenly
[8:28] Kingdom set your affection on things
[8:29] above and the specifics we need to
[8:31] mortify in Christian Living now this is
[8:33] important because this was mostly a
[8:35] gentile Church
[8:36] and Gentiles were given over to fleshly
[8:38] lusts right and so they would need a
[8:41] longer section on gotta crucify this got
[8:43] to die to this don't do because it was
[8:45] commonplace did you know Church in Rome
[8:47] it was commonplace for men to have
[8:50] boys that they would have by their side
[8:52] with them all the time and those were
[8:54] the boys they abused in very very awful
[8:57] ways they were just they would just be
[8:58] with them
[8:59] all the time and everybody knew it
[9:02] and they would have open you know
[9:03] brothels I mean even way more way more
[9:06] than what we have here it was just a
[9:08] common thing for men to walk in and walk
[9:10] out and just common thing for women like
[9:12] like Solomon said the women was standing
[9:14] in the corners and the streets you know
[9:15] it was just common
[9:17] now there's certain parts of that you
[9:18] know you get down to Akron but this was
[9:20] much more commonplace it was an
[9:22] extremely Wicked place so for Paul to
[9:24] come around and say that's you got to be
[9:26] crucified of that that was a real High
[9:27] Calling praise God
[9:30] but that's what they needed because they
[9:32] were Gentiles right they weren't Jews a
[9:35] lot of these or some Jews but they were
[9:36] mostly gentiles and then we saw how
[9:38] Christianity is best expressed in the
[9:40] home amen
[9:42] hope your home life has been pretty good
[9:44] and since we pre-shown that by God's
[9:45] grace or I should say better she'll be
[9:48] better by God's grace
[9:49] now here we are with chapter four uh we
[9:51] started on verse five and six uh he
[9:53] gives instructions to the Masters
[9:54] remember because you have a master over
[9:56] you and then he requests
[9:58] he requests prayer and he gives
[10:00] admonition for prayer so he encourages
[10:03] them you need to pray and also pray for
[10:05] us and then he ends the book by greeting
[10:08] all these individuals and he gives us
[10:09] farewell so we'll kind of see uh we'll
[10:12] see how this uh plays out here by God's
[10:14] grace so verse 5 walk in wisdom toward
[10:17] them that are without Redeeming the time
[10:21] so church we got a daily ask God for
[10:23] wisdom for interacting with sinners
[10:27] and this will protect your time
[10:29] you know how many times have we seen
[10:30] people come into our church and then
[10:32] some friend who's not a Christian will
[10:34] draw them away we just seen it actually
[10:36] recently right
[10:38] uh
[10:40] wisdom though would cause people
[10:43] to make a to make the best decisions so
[10:46] they make the best use of their time
[10:49] so in this case in our church people
[10:52] that come into our church should choose
[10:54] to spend more time with us
[10:56] because we're the people that's going to
[10:57] build up their faith
[10:59] right
[11:01] if somebody new comes in here and but
[11:03] they spend their most time at the
[11:04] Catholic Church well who's going to
[11:05] influence them more
[11:06] now we can't force anybody but we sure
[11:08] can invite people
[11:10] right so we get the wisdom of God
[11:12] be careful who we're spending our time
[11:14] with
[11:16] because he says redeem the time make the
[11:18] most of your time make sure your time is
[11:21] serving you and not you serving the time
[11:23] right I'm just a slave to this situation
[11:25] no you need to rule over that situation
[11:28] and bring it into subjection to God's
[11:29] word amen don't waste your time you
[11:31] don't want to live your life with
[11:33] regrets well I wasted a whole year on
[11:35] that you know I've had different people
[11:36] tell me over the years
[11:38] well one one person in particular a real
[11:41] saying of God
[11:42] but he was telling me like people would
[11:44] come into his life and seem act like
[11:45] they're interested in the message but
[11:47] then they would just you know take up
[11:48] all their time on the phone complain
[11:51] cause problems and he realized later
[11:53] this person the devil's just anointing
[11:55] this person to steal my time
[11:57] he didn't have time with his family like
[11:59] he wanted to or time with God
[12:01] and he just saw the pattern it happened
[12:03] once well it happened again with a
[12:04] different person then this person come
[12:06] back and
[12:08] see what wisdom would tell you protect
[12:10] your time if you're going to complain I
[12:12] don't have time to talk to you
[12:14] right Church
[12:15] the Bible said Mark then that caused
[12:17] divisions
[12:19] you know if they won't repent you've
[12:20] gotta you have to redeem your time
[12:23] you only got one Life Church
[12:25] I only got one opportunity to serve God
[12:27] and to make the most of my time
[12:29] especially I have to be careful how how
[12:32] much time I give to people outside of
[12:34] the church
[12:35] all right now we saw a couple years ago
[12:38] there was a family in our church and
[12:39] every time they would have their natural
[12:42] family come in they would miss church
[12:44] well that's a perfect example that was
[12:47] not wisdom
[12:48] they skipped Church to spend time with
[12:50] their natural family that's not wisdom
[12:52] that's folly
[12:54] right now I'm being a little rebuking
[12:57] here but it's the Holy Spirit Church
[12:58] it's not me really it's the Holy Spirit
[13:00] that's what the word of God says
[13:03] it's an awful testimony to say I'm a
[13:05] Christian and then in front of your
[13:07] family deny the word of God
[13:11] right
[13:12] we've got to redeem the time make the
[13:13] most of your time especially be wise how
[13:16] you act around those without
[13:18] those out in the world
[13:23] so he ends this letter by telling these
[13:25] Gentiles who they used to give all their
[13:27] time to lustful desires Pleasures all
[13:30] these things he said make the most of
[13:31] your time
[13:32] don't waste your time be especially
[13:35] careful with people that are not in the
[13:36] message
[13:37] right
[13:39] or not a real believer in Jesus Christ
[13:41] be careful how much time you spend with
[13:42] them
[13:43] because if you're not careful it'll make
[13:45] you waste your time
[13:47] praise God
[13:49] now just let me give you an idea about
[13:51] the definition of wisdom
[13:52] so we got to use we have to use Broad
[13:54] and full intelligence
[13:57] we have to look for the sages advice
[14:01] we gotta look for the we gotta look for
[14:03] the best advice we got to walk in the
[14:05] best advice we can get
[14:07] walk in wisdom
[14:09] especially with the Sinners out in the
[14:10] world
[14:11] look for the best advice from where from
[14:13] the word of God right here
[14:17] buy back your time sorry my pen fell
[14:19] there happens sometimes I'll put in my
[14:21] pocket
[14:23] walking wisdom walking the skill and
[14:25] your management of your affairs
[14:28] right
[14:29] walking wisdom walk in devout and proper
[14:31] Prudence in intercourse with men not
[14:34] Disciples of Christ so be very careful
[14:36] they're not Disciples of Christ
[14:38] how much time we're spending with them
[14:41] because really they are they're not your
[14:43] friends
[14:45] because when push comes to shove and you
[14:47] want to tell them about Jesus they're
[14:47] going to listen to you
[14:49] and when you're hurt you're struggling
[14:51] who's going to help you out probably
[14:52] your Christian family is going to help
[14:53] you out
[14:54] right that's what I've seen at least in
[14:56] my life
[14:57] right
[14:59] look for knowledge and practice of
[15:02] requisites for Godly and upright living
[15:04] walk in Godly living walk in upright
[15:07] living
[15:08] another definition is supreme
[15:10] intelligence walk in the Supreme
[15:11] intelligence of the Holy Spirit
[15:13] I like that
[15:15] the wisdom of God as evidence informing
[15:17] and executing councils
[15:20] so walk in God's wisdom look for the
[15:23] best advice possible
[15:25] amen
[15:27] now remember this should remind us of
[15:30] the book of wisdom get wisdom get
[15:32] understanding forget it not neither
[15:34] decline from the words of my mouth
[15:35] forsake or not and she shall preserve
[15:37] thee how many want to last a long time
[15:39] serving God get wisdom it'll preserve
[15:42] you
[15:43] right I preached a few weeks ago and God
[15:45] preserves the Saints right what
[15:47] preserves God's Saints God's wisdom does

[16:09] therefore get wisdom with all thy
[16:11] getting get understanding exalt her and
[16:13] she shall promote thee
[16:15] she shall bring thee to honor when thou
[16:17] Dost Embrace her now who doesn't want to
[16:19] be honored praise God
[16:21] who doesn't want the Lord to say Well

[16:24] well done Austin
[16:26] well done sister Hua sisters there you
[16:28] know we could go through everybody here
[16:29] tonight we've got a small church I could
[16:31] I could do that but you understand I
[16:33] could I use all of you every now and
[16:34] then
[16:36] God honors those who embrace the wisdom
[16:38] of God
[16:40] and she shall give to thine head an
[16:42] ornament of Grace remember we're talking
[16:43] about being crowned with the right thing
[16:45] crying with God's loving kindness and
[16:46] mercy

[16:53] to her she'll hold on to you and then

[17:08] that give it to all men liberally you
[17:10] know Church many times they answered our
[17:11] problems it's just more prayer
[17:14] I'll say that again many times Church
[17:16] the answer to all of our problems is
[17:18] just talking to God about it
[17:20] because he gives it out freely
[17:24] really gives it up
[17:25] and he uprighteth or not I'm sorry and
[17:27] that wisdom uprighteth not
[17:30] and it shall be given him but we've got
[17:32] to ask in faith nothing wavering see
[17:35] that's where it's hard because right you
[17:36] were pressured we got to make a decision
[17:37] or maybe I'm on a time commitment here
[17:40] but we got to wait on God and not doubt
[17:42] God's going to bring the answer I just
[17:44] got to keep trusting God
[17:46] keep waiting on God
[17:48] for he that waverth is like a wave of
[17:51] the sea driven with the wind and tossed
[17:54] I don't I don't know what to do I don't
[17:56] know what to do with the situation I
[17:57] don't know do yes you do wait on God
[17:59] hallelujah that's what you need to do
[18:01] amen
[18:02] and the Bible said You shall seek me and
[18:04] buy me when you search for me with all
[18:05] your heart so we've got to ask God for
[18:07] wisdom but then we got to go seek it out
[18:09] too
[18:10] okay just well I'm going to say a prayer
[18:12] at church or I'm going to come up for
[18:13] prayer or I'm going to need her at the
[18:14] altar and then walk away and forget
[18:16] about God you got to see God about it
[18:18] praise God
[18:20] we want to walk in wisdom if we want to
[18:21] redeem the time if you want the
[18:23] principal thing we got to invest time
[18:25] into getting it praise God
[18:27] Hallelujah
[18:29] verse 6. let your speech be always with
[18:33] Grace which is good will sweetness charm
[18:37] Mercy
[18:39] season which is Savory or prepare
[18:41] prepare with salt now if anybody knows
[18:44] about spices it's the sisters in here
[18:45] right
[18:46] sisters could give us a good lesson on
[18:48] this natural to spiritual
[18:50] so our speech has to be seasoned
[18:54] with salt that you may know how you
[18:57] ought to answer every man in other words
[18:59] a sister when she makes a meal
[19:01] she knows I want it to taste like this
[19:03] so I've got a season now I got to put
[19:05] this and this and I gotta marinade
[19:06] that's all I really know about cooking
[19:07] right there that's on I can't tell you
[19:09] anything else sprinkle I don't know flip
[19:13] it over I don't know
[19:15] roast it Grill it that's about all I got
[19:20] I'm out that's all I got
[19:21] but you know what you want to you what
[19:24] you want to taste like so you make
[19:25] preparations to get it there same thing
[19:28] with your words
[19:29] you know you're going to come into
[19:30] contact with the person you're going to
[19:31] have this discussion you've got to
[19:33] season it with salt amen
[19:36] you got to make it Savory you got to
[19:38] prepare the scriptures amen hallelujah
[19:41] got to prepare the word of God now there
[19:43] are times where Jesus says don't prepare
[19:45] what you're going to say that's when
[19:46] you're brought before the judges and the
[19:47] magistrates and they're going to kill us
[19:48] or put us in court if they ever do
[19:51] Jesus says in those cases don't prepare
[19:53] anything he said the father will tell
[19:55] you what to say in that hour praise God
[19:58] but for other times when we're
[20:00] interacting with people
[20:01] he says always have sweetness Mercy
[20:05] charm
[20:08] goodness right
[20:10] have your words seasoned with Mercy
[20:13] you know what you know what really
[20:14] drives people away when message people
[20:16] get really judgmental
[20:18] right and they just rebuke them right to
[20:19] their face right you know it's just
[20:22] it just kind of turns people it turns a
[20:24] lot of people away
[20:26] right there's a reason you know when
[20:28] Austin come back I treat them in a
[20:29] certain way
[20:30] right
[20:31] because I know how I was treated when I
[20:33] came to the message
[20:35] I was treated with a lot of love and
[20:36] grace I wasn't treated by a legalistic
[20:39] you've got to believe this and you got
[20:40] to do this and fear this you know fear
[20:41] yeah I wasn't I was I was showing the
[20:44] love of Christ
[20:45] so we get meet new people in here I try
[20:47] to do the same thing I try to say I try
[20:50] to season my words with a lot of Mercy
[20:51] in it
[20:53] right because God has been merciful to
[20:55] me praise God
[20:56] who hasn't God been merciful to
[21:00] see when you when you prepare the right
[21:02] words when you when you season the food
[21:04] the right way you you know you're going
[21:05] to get the right results so when you
[21:06] prepare the words you study the word you
[21:09] memorize the word
[21:10] Senator said
[21:13] oh now you know how you can give an
[21:15] answer to every man
[21:16] and I just found this if I just stay
[21:18] studying all the time listening to
[21:19] quotes and talking to Brothers emailing
[21:21] about the Bible pretty soon I'll use
[21:23] those in a conversation like in a day or
[21:24] two
[21:25] it never fails it never fails I'm just
[21:28] talking about something pretty soon
[21:29] comes up just talking about that the
[21:30] other day praise God word and due season
[21:32] how pleasant it is hallelujah
[21:35] a word in due season how the right one
[21:37] you need it praise God
[21:39] in other words just keep set your
[21:41] affection on things of God right
[21:43] seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
[21:45] these things will be what added unto you
[21:48] get everything else
[21:49] put God first
[21:51] put seasoning on your words
[21:53] you're going to get some good you're
[21:55] gonna get a good result from that praise
[21:56] God
[21:57] just like we get some good suppers from
[21:59] Acacia and Mommy
[22:01] whoever's cooking Emma's been doing a
[22:02] good job there
[22:04] season it right the right way
[22:07] see every person needs a specific answer
[22:09] relative to their past experience
[22:12] right
[22:13] they're past their upbringing like with
[22:15] the Jews and Gentiles we'll get that in
[22:17] just a moment
[22:19] so see we gotta just like food is
[22:20] prepared we've got to ask God to prepare
[22:22] us for answers how we ought to answer
[22:24] people
[22:26] praise God
[22:28] now here's what Paul says though I be
[22:30] free from all men yet I made myself a
[22:32] servant unto all that I might gain the
[22:34] more you know you know how you win souls
[22:35] you know how we need can win souls
[22:36] becoming a sermon to more people
[22:39] so we just seen him with the Amish right
[22:40] I I had to sacrifice some time we have
[22:42] to sacrifice time away from my family I
[22:43] gotta sacrifice time away from the
[22:44] church I become a servant to them
[22:46] and by God's grace some Souls get
[22:48] baptized praise God
[22:50] we've got to become servants to all
[22:53] and unto the Jews I became as a Jew
[22:56] that I might gain the Jews
[22:59] and to them that are under the law as
[23:00] under the law that I might gain them
[23:02] that are under the law
[23:04] now he's not saying he's going to sin
[23:06] but he's going to take the mindset and
[23:08] he could
[23:09] how would a a Jew
[23:12] have to deal with this with this truth
[23:14] about Christianity from how he was
[23:16] raised what would his natural response
[23:18] be and what could I say that could help
[23:21] them understand the truth from their
[23:23] perspective
[23:26] for people that live holy people that
[23:28] sacrifice all the time constantly
[23:30] sacrifice and say daily prayers so much
[23:33] legalism what could I say to them to get
[23:35] them to see the freedom of the Holy
[23:36] Spirit
[23:38] the liberty of the Holy Spirit
[23:40] or like many of us not all of us but
[23:42] many of us were raised in Heathen
[23:44] atmospheres what can I say to get them
[23:46] to forsake the pleasure of the world and
[23:48] see that the greatest pleasure is Jesus
[23:49] Christ and become more diligent and
[23:51] dedicated
[23:53] and consecrated
[23:55] see we're trying to find the middle of
[23:57] the road here by God's grace
[23:58] not Jewish legalism but also not
[24:01] foolishness and wasting time we want to
[24:03] redeem the time praise God
[24:05] because the days are evil
[24:07] remember I said last week I thought it
[24:09] was a blessing I thought it was a Holy
[24:10] Spirit you do nothing for salvation but
[24:13] after that you got a lot to do after you
[24:14] get saved praise God
[24:16] die every day Hallelujah
[24:18] seek God first amen hallelujah show
[24:21] diligence every day serve God with all
[24:23] your heart soul mind and strength give
[24:25] God everything you've got praise God
[24:27] make it a sacrifice of praise
[24:29] make your life a free will offering
[24:33] Hallelujah
[24:34] to them that are without the law as
[24:36] without law not being or sorry being not
[24:38] without law to God but under the law to
[24:40] Christ that I might gain them that art
[24:42] without law
[24:45] see look he's still under the law of
[24:46] Christ
[24:47] see the holy spirit is the law remember
[24:49] the law of the spirit
[24:51] if you obey the Holy Spirit he anoints
[24:54] you if you disobey he you you grieve him
[24:56] and his anointing leaves you
[24:59] the mind
[25:00] right that's the law
[25:02] but if you repent and honesty real quick
[25:04] then he'll come right back to you praise
[25:06] God
[25:07] Hallelujah he's merciful praise God he's
[25:09] faithful praise God he he renews our
[25:12] minds day by day Hallelujah
[25:15] if that's the law of the Holy Spirit
[25:17] people say I'm not under the law well I
[25:19] beg your pardon the Bible said I'm under
[25:20] the law of Christ
[25:22] and Romans 8 says I'm under the law of
[25:24] the spirit praise God
[25:26] there's always a law there's laws
[25:27] everywhere there's laws of gravity
[25:28] there's laws of everything
[25:29] thermodynamics I don't know anything
[25:31] about those but there's laws everywhere
[25:33] I praise God I used to when I was in
[25:35] college but I forgot it all verse 22 to
[25:37] the week became Maya's week that I might
[25:39] gain the week and I'm I have made all
[25:41] things to all men that I might by all
[25:43] means save some
[25:46] I like this how Paul
[25:48] says I'm all things to all men
[25:51] so think about that how could I uh how
[25:53] could God use me to help a a Jew how
[25:56] could God use me to help a ranked sinner
[25:59] how could God use me to help the Amish
[26:02] I never thought that would be me to be
[26:04] honest with you how could God use me to
[26:06] help uh message Believers in a tape
[26:08] Church
[26:09] I'm trying to help him right now
[26:10] actually making videos for him
[26:14] how could God use me to uh to help the
[26:17] prostitute off the street
[26:19] or the wealthy CEO that comes into the
[26:21] restaurant
[26:23] Escape their sin how could God use me to
[26:25] do that praise God you can become all
[26:27] things to all men all you got to do is
[26:29] prepare the right words amen season them
[26:31] with God's Saul Hallelujah
[26:34] store up the word of God in your heart
[26:36] and God will give you the words to say
[26:37] in that season
[26:39] praise God
[26:42] so see
[26:44] look let's compare Paul's letter to the
[26:46] Hebrews
[26:47] to this letter to the Colossians real
[26:49] quick here if we can
[26:51] now this is hard to read
[26:53] but this is from the Bible project now
[26:55] they got some strange Doctrine so I'm
[26:57] not saying they're all good they're not
[26:59] the nice thing is there's no ads on
[27:00] YouTube that's what I like about it
[27:02] okay so the main idea of Hebrews
[27:06] uh chapter one and two talks about Jesus
[27:09] the angels and the Torah chapter three
[27:11] and fours on Moses in the promised land
[27:13] chapter five six and seven is on priests
[27:15] in Melchizedek do you see a lot of this
[27:16] there's a lot of Jewish Jewish content
[27:19] showing how the Old Testament connects
[27:22] to the New Testament right chapters 8
[27:24] 9-10 sacrifice and Covenant chapters 11
[27:27] 12 and 13. uh God's word hope for a new
[27:30] creation Jesus is the Eternal priest and
[27:33] there's lots of warnings about you must
[27:35] be steadfast or else you could fall away
[27:39] there's warnings you must keep the faith
[27:40] until the end
[27:42] right you must receive the you must
[27:44] press on towards the end of your faith
[27:46] people can crucify the son of God afresh
[27:49] how much more sower punishment will they
[27:51] have to those that just do despite the
[27:54] spirit of Grace
[27:55] and put Jesus Christ to an open shame
[27:58] why because the Jews know better
[28:01] they've been taught these things their
[28:02] whole life
[28:03] they're raised according to scripture
[28:05] the Shema Hebrews 6 4-6
[28:09] now the book of Colossians though
[28:13] which we just went through chapters one
[28:15] and two is on the exalted Messiah then
[28:17] we get into Paul's sufferings and
[28:19] chapter two uh the pressure is to turn
[28:21] away all the Temptations right the
[28:23] mysticism the polytheism of the Jewish
[28:25] legalism as we just I just put it in a
[28:27] word form earlier
[28:29] and then we must live a resurrected life
[28:33] and then uh the conclusion
[28:36] what a different letter it is compared
[28:38] to the Hebrews see Paul could become all
[28:40] things to all men
[28:42] you need a lesson on the Old Testament
[28:44] types Paul Paul Was Your Man
[28:46] he could tear it up on all the types of
[28:49] the Old Testament he'd wear you out with
[28:51] all the types Moses and Joseph and Mo
[28:54] and he and Aaron and all these Miriam I
[28:56] can take all the types praise God but he
[28:59] could also relate to the Gentile
[29:01] so you got to be really careful with
[29:03] these things that are in the Gentile
[29:04] world
[29:05] uncleanness and sins and sexual or
[29:08] immorality all these things you really
[29:10] got to watch out for that
[29:12] so he was able to craft his message to
[29:16] the right person that's that's what I'm
[29:19] praying for you know each time I go down
[29:20] to the Amish Lord give me a word that
[29:22] would set the legal is free
[29:25] Lord use me to show the freedom of the
[29:27] Holy Spirit
[29:30] the joy that it brings but also a
[29:32] balance because at some point we got to
[29:34] have some order
[29:36] we can't be so anti uh anti-order that
[29:40] we just have no order
[29:43] and well then we'll let the women preach
[29:45] or whatever you got to have an order
[29:46] praise God
[29:49] you've got to have some type of order
[29:51] but see the first thought might be well
[29:53] we're free and others now there's no
[29:55] more order there's no more but God's the
[29:58] author of order he's not the author of
[30:00] confusion
[30:01] it never ceases to amaze me we can have
[30:04] the same format for service we can pray
[30:06] before service then we can sing songs
[30:08] then we can do song specials then we can
[30:10] preach and then we can sing and pray and
[30:12] God's spirit will fall almost every time
[30:14] after service amen because God likes art
[30:17] or praise God or we don't have to do
[30:19] that and God's spirit can still fall but
[30:21] but we we choose to have order because
[30:24] we can see it in the word of God
[30:25] hallelujah
[30:27] just so you know I'm not open to
[30:28] changing the order
[30:30] I'm not open to that I'm sure I'm not
[30:32] close to that I'll be happy to change
[30:33] order somebody feels led to the Lord
[30:36] but that's what it means it's a leading
[30:37] of the Lord now that's a challenge now
[30:39] who's going to stand up and say I got
[30:40] the leading the Lord
[30:42] because most time everybody sits back
[30:44] and what does brother Jesse feel led to
[30:45] do well thank you I appreciate that
[30:48] I'm not always perfect you know
[30:52] and as the I'm the local Elder right so
[30:54] everybody expects me to have the lenient
[30:55] Lord and by God's grace I'm doing the
[30:57] best I can to follow in you Lord
[31:01] praise God like I felt led to have the
[31:03] Napoleon Services was that a leading the
[31:04] Lord I believe so
[31:07] each time he said these guest ministers
[31:09] come in and it speaks right to our lives
[31:10] that was just God's leading God's grace
[31:13] God's love to us God's mercy
[31:16] so see the book of Hebrews is directed
[31:18] mainly to Jews so Paul became as a Jew
[31:21] to the Jews the focus was on Jesus is
[31:23] fulfilling the many Old Testament types
[31:25] there's numerous warnings about losing
[31:26] salvation since they knew better but the
[31:28] Colossians focuses on Jesus deity and
[31:31] wrong creation overcoming their specific
[31:33] spiritual Temptations and how to live
[31:35] for Christ by mortifying the Flesh of
[31:37] desires there's more assurance and less
[31:39] warnings in this book
[31:40] right so different group different
[31:43] crafting different message
[31:45] right
[31:47] you see it in brother random sermons all
[31:49] the time sometimes he's preaching a Four
[31:51] Square Church and he won't ball he won't
[31:53] ball out women preachers in that church
[31:56] ever noticed that
[32:02] or he'll be in a group of businessmen
[32:05] and who really ball out businessmen you
[32:07] know he'll just bring and he'll try to
[32:09] he'll try to craft the or uh craft the
[32:12] message write to what a businessman
[32:13] Investments and everything
[32:15] and honest deals with the with business
[32:18] he'll just he'll just uh you know craft
[32:21] that message just exactly to what they
[32:22] need he'll cater that message right to
[32:24] what they need
[32:26] or if he's at the Pentecostal people who
[32:28] bring down you gotta grow your hair out
[32:30] and wash the makeup off your face you
[32:32] know there's
[32:33] he can just we just have to believe he
[32:35] was led by the Holy Spirit to preach
[32:37] what the people needed praise God
[32:41] that's what we have to find we have to
[32:42] find how can I become how can you and I
[32:45] become all things to all men
[32:49] so I'll just use you know whoa and
[32:50] Zero's example their mom's really
[32:51] hurting so we can pray Lord how can they
[32:54] be all things to all people
[32:57] how God how can I be a vessel to someone
[32:59] who's hurting after they lost a spouse
[33:00] that's real that's real Christianity
[33:03] right there
[33:04] praise God
[33:07] can I how can I be that
[33:08] or you got a really awful boss or
[33:10] something like that really vulgar boss
[33:12] how can I be all things
[33:14] to all men
[33:16] I don't want to partake in his sin or
[33:18] her sins or his
[33:21] but I'm around them all day
[33:24] Lord season my words with some salt
[33:28] or whatever you'd pour on there whatever
[33:29] you'd scoop on there
[33:31] trying to imagine what the people cook
[33:32] with
[33:35] whatever
[33:37] that comes by prayer that comes by
[33:39] reading the word of God
[33:41] Lord give me the word to say to this
[33:43] person
[33:47] and everybody just said this was thus
[33:49] saith the Lord right
[33:50] okay okay everybody still believes that
[33:51] okay again praise God so do I
[33:54] yeah for the second pencil pen there
[33:56] really good dropping dance verse seven
[33:58] all my statement look at this look how
[34:01] Paul was such an open book
[34:03] all my state shall take us declare unto
[34:06] you the Colossians who is a beloved
[34:08] brother and a faithful Minister and
[34:10] fellow servant Lord so Paul is going to
[34:12] send a preacher he's in prison he's
[34:14] going to send a preacher and tell the
[34:16] Colossians all about his life
[34:19] maybe his financial condition his health
[34:22] his recent sermons he's been preaching
[34:24] from Jim because he gets visitors right
[34:26] he can preach to them
[34:29] Paul says all my state in other words my
[34:32] life is an open book
[34:34] tell them how in other words share with
[34:37] them how a prophet of God serves God in
[34:39] prison
[34:40] see that's what I love about brother
[34:41] Ram's tapes we get to see all brother
[34:43] Rams state
[34:45] is that right Church
[34:46] you can see the great anointed services
[34:48] and then the Humble House services
[34:51] okay good to see the questions and
[34:53] answers with his home Church you know
[34:54] and also brother but other sermons
[34:56] brothers getting translated overseas
[35:00] and you hear the translations
[35:02] whole different different message
[35:04] different sermon totally different
[35:06] message to them
[35:08] all my state he says
[35:11] I like this Paul was an open Ministry
[35:13] now I just thought this too you know
[35:15] sometimes I'm a little nervous about
[35:16] churches that don't put their services
[35:18] online
[35:19] not all the time
[35:21] but I've noticed in a few cases some
[35:22] that don't put their services online all
[35:25] the time I get a little concerned about
[35:26] that what are you trying to hide
[35:30] right
[35:31] in a lot of cases
[35:33] people do hide things
[35:36] now
[35:37] let me balance that out sometimes I
[35:39] don't put all of our sermons on because
[35:40] I have to call out some specific things
[35:43] right you have to give some specific
[35:44] details
[35:47] but there's a reason sometimes people
[35:49] don't let all their state known
[35:52] look at Brother Bear look at all those
[35:53] tapes he let out church and it's from
[35:55] beginning to end
[35:57] prayer line and everything
[36:01] that's pretty honest that's pretty
[36:03] that's pretty transparent right Joe
[36:05] Biden said I'm going to be the most
[36:06] transparent president well of course he
[36:07] hasn't been but
[36:09] but look at the Christian
[36:11] he's so transparent
[36:13] I'm telling you I'll tell you guys all
[36:14] about me that's why I like doing this
[36:15] questions answers I'll tell you my
[36:17] honest opinion because I want to tell
[36:18] everybody in front of everybody
[36:20] I don't want to have this well this is
[36:21] just for amen and who over here and this
[36:23] just for Austin Lena over here well it's
[36:26] just for Emma here I like it now
[36:28] sometimes there are personal things we
[36:29] got to talk about but in most cases I
[36:31] want I want the truth to go out to
[36:32] everybody
[36:34] praise God like brother man said he said
[36:36] make sure you talk about other people as
[36:38] if they were standing right there
[36:40] right
[36:42] so that's why I like this openness I
[36:44] like this transparency I like the
[36:46] transparency about that you can ask me
[36:47] any question I'm in the hot seat right
[36:49] there you can ask me any question boy it
[36:51] sure does get hot sometimes
[36:54] verse eight and nine whom I've sent unto
[36:56] you for the same purpose so tickiest was
[36:58] set for that same purpose that he might
[37:00] know your estate and comfort your hearts
[37:02] so look at this a Christian prophet and
[37:05] a local church that they're ministering
[37:07] to they want to share how they're doing
[37:12] right
[37:13] now Church you and I both know sometimes
[37:15] we don't have enough time all the time
[37:16] and we were I'll say like this we rarely
[37:18] have enough time to really talk about
[37:19] how we're doing
[37:21] how was your week sister I hope you're
[37:23] good brother how was your week oh it's
[37:25] real good bye guys
[37:26] no that's me but do we do we really get
[37:28] to know the all the estate that we have
[37:31] sometimes not all the time that's why
[37:33] there's nice times where we really get
[37:34] to sit down and get some fellowship
[37:35] those are some really wonderful times
[37:37] and I know we don't have time every
[37:38] service to do that but look at the
[37:40] prophet of God he says tell them all
[37:43] about my life tell them about my
[37:45] Ministry everything tell them all my
[37:47] state but I want to hear all their state
[37:49] too
[37:52] because we can Comfort one another well
[37:55] brother Austin I didn't know you were
[37:56] struggling with that thanks for sharing
[37:57] that let me encourage you with this
[37:58] brother remember Austin say brother Jess
[38:00] I didn't know you were struggling with
[38:01] that let me pray for you can I pray for
[38:03] you brother Jesse I just heard brother
[38:05] man I just heard a scripture
[38:06] here this might be encouragement to you
[38:10] see there's going to be these special
[38:12] times when we get to really share what
[38:14] we're going through and that's when we
[38:16] can Comfort one another
[38:18] so what's the opposite of comfort
[38:20] discomfort
[38:22] so that's why Paul did this so the
[38:24] people would not be discomforted am I
[38:26] the only one going through this and
[38:28] I don't like this I feel like I'm
[38:30] backslinger I feel like
[38:31] I feel like uh
[38:33] God's So Far Away Paul wanted them to be
[38:36] comforted
[38:40] Comfort your hearts
[38:42] having a discomfort heart is an awful
[38:45] condition to be in
[38:47] so again we see look at the power of
[38:49] Fellowship look at the power Fellowship
[38:51] it takes away your discomforts
[38:53] oh I know brother so-and-so is praying
[38:55] for me
[38:56] thank God my wife prayed for me or my
[38:58] husband prayed for me oh I appreciate
[39:00] that that's such a blessing
[39:02] amen
[39:05] now see also Paul was not hiding
[39:09] anything
[39:10] like a lot of churches do
[39:12] or a lot of Christians they hide things
[39:14] he didn't he didn't say well tell them
[39:16] half of my estate what's going on
[39:19] he said tell them all the things going
[39:21] on that's all the things that you see
[39:25] does every church have good and bad or
[39:27] does or not
[39:29] every church has good and bad
[39:33] even your pastor makes mistakes dude
[39:36] yes yes
[39:37] all the time
[39:39] all the time
[39:40] every church has good and bad
[39:43] right
[39:45] but Paul said go ahead and share all the
[39:47] estate now think about if if Paul were
[39:49] to let's go over to the book of Timothy
[39:51] now
[39:52] Paul would have had to share the estate
[39:54] of Timothy he said oh our brother
[39:55] Timothy he's sick all the time could
[39:57] somebody pray for him he's drinking he's
[39:59] drinking wine for a stomach's sake but
[40:00] just just let him know he's sick all the
[40:02] time he gets he's often sick
[40:05] Paul why don't you just speak the word
[40:06] of God because I'm not led to do that
[40:08] yet
[40:10] right just tell just tell it like it is
[40:13] right tell it like it is that's kind of
[40:14] what Ben the rod was dealing with there
[40:15] was really inspiring
[40:17] you know every church has problems
[40:20] the thing we don't want to do is let
[40:22] Satan
[40:23] isolate us sounds like a sermon right
[40:25] there
[40:26] isolation
[40:28] we don't want to be isolated but Paul
[40:30] said go ahead and tell them all my state
[40:32] that I'm in
[40:36] now here's a beautiful
[40:37] uh
[40:39] story that gets tied in with colossi
[40:43] who's read the book of Philemon lately
[40:46] okay
[40:47] so he now he starts naming some names
[40:49] right tikius and now he goes with
[40:51] onesimus so onesimus lives in colossi
[40:53] who's onesimus he's the runaway slave
[40:57] from Philemon
[41:01] right so Tiki has shared all the things
[41:03] about Paul's estate wanted to learn the
[41:05] state of Colossians Paul wanted them
[41:07] comforted and now onesimus
[41:09] now look Paul calls onesimus he's that
[41:12] faithful brother
[41:14] and beloved brother
[41:17] who's one of you
[41:19] look at these words
[41:22] a faithful beloved man but Church did
[41:25] you know before this he was a runaway
[41:27] slave
[41:30] everybody know that
[41:32] he wasn't so faithful before
[41:35] Church some of us aren't always faithful
[41:37] all the time right
[41:40] but look how Paul
[41:42] builds him up look how Paul
[41:45] points out the good aspects of onesimus
[41:49] he could have said yeah that former
[41:51] backslider of Vanessa missing he costs
[41:53] filemon all these thousand dollars
[41:55] hundreds of thousands I don't know ten
[41:57] thousand Maybe
[41:59] go to the book of felima let's go there
[42:01] I got a couple verses up here
[42:11] it's right after Titus after
[42:14] Timothy Thessalonians Timothy Titus
[42:17] then Philemon
[42:19] so anessimist was philemon's runaway
[42:21] slave who got saved under Paul's
[42:24] Ministry so he ran away
[42:26] he was a sinner
[42:27] ran away from Philemon Philemon was a
[42:29] wealthy man in colossae
[42:32] he was wealthy enough to have servants
[42:33] or slaves
[42:36] this is interesting that Paul was
[42:38] writing about Masters treat your slaves
[42:41] the right way
[42:42] because there were some rich Christians
[42:43] in the colossi church
[42:45] they're rich enough to have slaves
[42:51] see so there was four churches there was
[42:53] rich churches
[42:55] right
[42:56] more wealthy churches more poor churches
[42:58] God has a variety
[43:03] and notice the book of Philemon
[43:09] so he's writing in verses one through
[43:11] three to the church in their house
[43:15] now let's go down to uh
[43:21] verse 10. Philemon
[43:23] only one chapter verse 10. I beseech
[43:25] thee for my son onesimus whom I begotten
[43:28] my bonds oh let's stop right there son
[43:31] this is a sinner who's run away but Paul
[43:33] lets him know now I was able to preach
[43:36] to him and he became a son of God
[43:39] hallelujah praise God
[43:42] so Paul uh there it is Paul became all
[43:45] things to all men
[43:47] Paul became The Giver of the word and
[43:50] due season to a runaway slave
[43:53] a sinner
[43:55] God gave Paul think about that God gave
[43:58] him the words to save a soul of a
[44:00] runaway Fugitive
[44:03] a law breaker but because Paul
[44:06] fellowship with Jesus so much amen
[44:08] God gave him that words that were
[44:10] seasoned with salt praise God
[44:13] able to win his soul
[44:14] oh it's beautiful
[44:17] while he was in his bonds while he was
[44:19] in prison he won a soul
[44:20] praise God which in time passed was to
[44:23] the unprofitable because he ran away but
[44:25] now profitable to thee and to me whom I
[44:28] have sent again thou therefore receive
[44:30] him that is mine own bowels
[44:33] so with just like we receive onesimus
[44:36] back into the church
[44:39] just like it was my own heart
[44:42] like it was me
[44:45] love him like you love me that's quite a
[44:48] thing
[44:49] quite a thing who's ever been but don't
[44:51] raise your hands but who's ever been
[44:52] betrayed here for we'd say thousands of
[44:54] dollars
[44:56] how easily could you trust that person
[44:58] again invite them back into church yes
[45:00] son come on in brother you stole 30
[45:01] grand off me come on in yes
[45:03] come on let me let me treat you as as a
[45:06] brother like everybody else it'd be hard
[45:08] wouldn't it
[45:09] let's be honest okay
[45:12] be difficult
[45:14] runaway slave a lot you know lost all
[45:17] that money
[45:18] lost my investment
[45:20] verse 13 whom I would have retained with
[45:23] me that is thy stead he might
[45:24] administered unto me and the bonds of
[45:25] the Gospel so he was ministering to Paul
[45:29] but without thy mind would I do nothing
[45:31] that thy benefit should not be as it
[45:33] were of necessity but willingly
[45:35] for perhaps he therefore departed for a
[45:37] season that thou should receive him
[45:39] forever
[45:40] so he left for a little bit so he could
[45:42] come back for the rest of his life
[45:45] is that something that's her sometimes
[45:46] you got to leave where you were
[45:49] to have an experience with God and then
[45:50] come back to where you were
[45:53] right
[45:56] verse 16 not now as a servant but above
[45:59] a servant a brother beloved
[46:03] don't look at him as a slave anymore
[46:04] runaway slave look him at his a loved
[46:07] brother
[46:09] the one who betrayed Philemon your your
[46:11] faithful brother in the church
[46:14] the rich brother in the church
[46:19] especially to me but how much more unto
[46:21] thee both in the flesh and the Lord if
[46:23] thou count me therefore a partner
[46:25] receive him as myself
[46:27] so we see this runaway slave like you
[46:30] would receive me
[46:31] How would how how would you act if
[46:33] brother random came in here if he was
[46:35] still alive and he preached for us today
[46:36] how would you act
[46:37] well I think I would be like
[46:42] sir
[46:44] I think I'd be really really sincere
[46:47] I don't think I'd be playing in my
[46:48] pockets or two of my nails
[46:50] that's a good one
[46:52] oh
[46:53] I don't think I'd be acting
[46:55] be carnal I think I'd be on just the
[46:58] very most reverent Hallelujah yeah we
[47:01] have a guest Minister coming here you
[47:02] know how we Act
[47:05] that's okay that's why there's different
[47:07] times and seasons for everything
[47:09] but Paul says receive this runaway slate
[47:12] this young convert receive him like you
[47:14] receive a prophet
[47:17] that's something that is something
[47:20] give him the honor give him the love you
[47:22] give a preacher
[47:24] a minister
[47:26] who's the Christian you admire most
[47:27] don't say it but maybe it's brother
[47:29] Brooks or brother cam or sister
[47:31] so-and-so brother so and so
[47:34] think of the honor think of the honor
[47:35] the respect you give to them then Paul
[47:37] says give this same respect to a new
[47:40] Christian
[47:41] who's betrayed the family in the church
[47:45] now they've got to have the fruits of
[47:46] repentance first
[47:48] which onesimus did
[47:50] he was willing to stay there and be a
[47:51] servant to a prisoner Paul
[47:55] like that's my whole job my whole life
[47:56] has just help this prisoner in the jail
[47:59] you know that Swiss is like I'll do that
[48:01] but Paul's like no go back to the home
[48:02] Church make this right
[48:05] Hallelujah
[48:09] these are some beautiful words here
[48:10] verse 18. if he hath wrong thee or o the
[48:13] ought put that on mine account
[48:19] there was a cost for runaway slaves
[48:20] right there was imprisonments there was
[48:22] fines Paul said if he costs you anything
[48:25] by running away
[48:26] if you missed out on having that uh his
[48:29] his Services as indentured servant or
[48:31] whatever slave whatever he was if you
[48:33] missed out on whatever that terms the
[48:34] service are put that money on my account
[48:36] and I'll pay that off
[48:40] now I'm not a business I'm not an owner
[48:42] where I I know how much an employee
[48:44] makes but think about if you knew how
[48:45] much an employee makes and that employee
[48:46] suddenly vanishes
[48:49] how much money is that going to take how
[48:51] much money is that going to cost a
[48:52] person or the company
[48:54] Paul said put all that on my account
[48:56] I'll pay for it he must have been a
[48:58] pretty good Tent Maker
[49:00] right
[49:01] he must have some money save he was in
[49:03] jail
[49:03] I don't know how I could make money in
[49:05] jail
[49:06] maybe had some savings somewhere
[49:09] he said put that on my account
[49:12] verse 9 19. I Paul have written it with
[49:15] my own hand I'll repay it think about
[49:17] that
[49:18] his brother's got a big debt but I'll
[49:21] pay it off
[49:22] I'll be I do not say to thee how thou
[49:25] owest unto me even thine own self
[49:28] besides so now Paul goes into the
[49:31] spiritual
[49:32] I'll gladly pay his natural because you
[49:35] owe me your soul spiritually that's what
[49:37] he's saying
[49:39] in other words you wouldn't be saved
[49:40] unless God sent me to preach the gospel
[49:42] to you
[49:44] isn't that something
[49:46] you forgive this brother his natural
[49:49] debt because you owe me a greater than
[49:51] that
[49:52] isn't that some persuasion right there
[49:56] Boys Everybody thinking in here real
[49:58] deep huh
[50:01] Paul doesn't use this language very
[50:02] often but here he says you owe me your
[50:05] very life
[50:07] maybe I don't know if he saved his life
[50:08] naturally but one thing's for sure if he
[50:11] preached the gospel he saved his soul
[50:16] isn't that something
[50:18] look at the depths of this
[50:20] verse 20. yay brother let me have joy of
[50:23] thee in the Lord refresh my bowels in
[50:25] the Lord
[50:26] in other words make me happy
[50:29] refresh my heart
[50:31] by forgiving this brother
[50:33] who you know basically Did You Wrong
[50:37] do it for me look at that church do it
[50:39] for me
[50:42] forgive him because you want to refresh
[50:44] me
[50:45] now that's eternal life right there
[50:48] that's eternal life
[50:51] my goodness
[50:54] verse 21 now how did Paul feel about
[50:56] philemon's ability to forgive having
[50:58] confidence in thy obedience I run into
[51:00] thee knowing that thou will also do more
[51:02] than I say
[51:04] I know you do more than that because you
[51:07] love me
[51:08] that's that's a lot church that is a lot
[51:11] hmm
[51:13] you know what they really wanted verse
[51:15] 22 is what he really wanted but with all
[51:17] prepare me also a lodging for I trust
[51:18] that through your prayers I shall be
[51:20] given even unto you
[51:22] so really Philemon really just wanted to
[51:24] see the prophet again
[51:27] if only we could have the prophet visit
[51:28] us he could Lodge with us oh if I could
[51:30] just hug Paul one more time
[51:33] if I could just hear one of his
[51:34] all-night sermons one more time one of
[51:37] those late Wednesday night services one
[51:38] more time praise God
[51:41] Hallelujah this is beautiful this is
[51:43] profound
[51:45] forgive him the natural debt because you
[51:47] owe me
[51:49] spiritual debt
[51:51] Church let's not go around pointing
[51:52] fingers at other people like you owe me
[51:53] you owe me
[51:55] that's not why I'm preaching this
[51:57] I'm preaching the show the level of
[51:59] forgiveness that Paul required or Paul
[52:01] asked for in this church
[52:03] and to look at the spiritual blessings
[52:06] as more important than the natural
[52:08] blessings
[52:11] praise God
[52:13] I could say something here about
[52:14] magazine
[52:15] I've actually left
[52:18] over there Glory
[52:22] let's finish this chapter or finish this
[52:23] book here
[52:26] aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluted
[52:28] to you now aristarchus must have been he
[52:30] shared Paul's imprisonment so he must
[52:32] have been a preacher who was arrested
[52:37] and Marcus sister son to Barnabas
[52:40] touching whom he receive Commandments if
[52:42] he come unto you receive him
[52:45] so he's greeting aristarchus and then
[52:48] Marcus now Marcus this is the same John
[52:50] Mark that Paul once refused to travel
[52:53] with
[52:54] do you know that
[52:56] there's a young man this this Mark
[52:57] gentleman Paul said I'm not even
[52:59] traveling with him
[53:02] right and Barnabas said why not you
[53:05] should let's he's going with us Paul's
[53:06] like no Pharmacy's like yeah
[53:09] no well then fine we're going Separate
[53:11] Ways
[53:13] two holy ghost film men
[53:17] two holy ghost film men couldn't agree
[53:19] on who to travel with
[53:20] did God stop moving amongst their
[53:22] Ministries did God stop blessing their
[53:24] Ministries no God kept blessing them
[53:27] answering their prayers Miracles
[53:29] Hallelujah the love of God the word of
[53:32] God the Holy Spirit kept flowing
[53:35] church sometimes our differences are are
[53:37] there's a purpose behind our differences
[53:39] so we can go accomplish different things
[53:40] God's called us to do
[53:44] or sometimes you're not going to agree
[53:46] with people but that's how God wants it
[53:48] to be so God can use you over here and
[53:51] use somebody else over there
[53:56] let's read to acts 15 36 we got time
[53:59] tonight we got
[54:04] 1536 I preached a message on this over
[54:06] in Albion years ago
[54:11] 1536-41 and some days after Paul said
[54:14] unto Barnabas let us go and visit our
[54:15] brother in every city where we would
[54:17] have preached the word of the Lord and
[54:18] see how they do let's go visit the
[54:19] brothers and see how they're doing
[54:20] verse 37 and Barnabas determined to take
[54:22] with them John whose surname was Mark
[54:24] this is the Marcus here but Paul thought
[54:26] not good to take him with them who
[54:28] departed from them from pampilia and
[54:31] went not with them to the work
[54:33] so Mark had already made this decision
[54:36] before he didn't go work with them
[54:37] previously
[54:39] and Paul remembered oh he didn't go with
[54:40] us the last time so I'm not taking him
[54:43] with me this time
[54:44] he turned down my offer last time I'm
[54:46] not taking him this time
[54:48] verse 39 and the contention was so sharp
[54:50] between them that they just departed
[54:52] asunder one from the other so Barnabas
[54:55] took Mark and sailed into Cyprus and
[54:57] Paul chose Silas
[54:59] and we all know what happened to Paul
[55:01] and Silas right they got locked up and
[55:03] at midnight they start praising God and
[55:06] God lose their chains praise God
[55:09] did God leave them no God continue to
[55:11] bless Barnabas he has a great history of
[55:13] serving Jesus I think he died as a
[55:15] martyr as well
[55:17] but God allowed this sharp contention
[55:18] sharp contention well I just don't see
[55:21] eye to eye with brother so and so that's
[55:22] okay
[55:23] sometimes that happens
[55:28] God kept doing Supernatural works so we
[55:30] can agree to disagree as long as we do
[55:32] it love and kindness
[55:33] but it's going to be awful Sharp
[55:37] you might say some sharp words of
[55:38] somebody
[55:40] Hallelujah
[55:44] but it's got to be done in love
[55:51] Paul chose Silas and departed and being
[55:53] recommended by the Brethren unto the
[55:55] grace of God
[55:57] and
[55:59] we can now see
[56:01] uh
[56:02] that Paul says receive John Mark so now
[56:05] we can see the wounds have been healed
[56:08] the trust look at that the trust has
[56:10] been restored
[56:12] church have you ever lost trust with
[56:13] somebody it's very hard to get it back
[56:16] right Paul's like I do not trust this
[56:18] man but now by this time I think this
[56:20] was his second or third mission
[56:21] missionary journey now he's like greet
[56:24] Marcus John Mark and receive him because
[56:28] last time he gave you Commandments
[56:30] receive mark
[56:32] receive him
[56:33] it's not well just avoid Mark don't let
[56:35] him participate in the service don't let
[56:37] him preach
[56:39] you know he's received mark
[56:41] now now now he's helpful to me for the
[56:44] ministry
[56:48] and Jesus which is called Justice
[56:51] who are of the circumcision now these
[56:53] are Jews that Paul is sending the
[56:55] greetings these only are my fellow
[56:57] workers under the kingdom of God which
[56:58] have been a comfort to me so Paul this
[57:00] all these names tikius and all the
[57:02] different names here onesimus
[57:04] he says these are my fellow workers and
[57:06] they've been a comfort to me
[57:10] now George let's make sure our lives are
[57:12] comforting people's lives in the church
[57:15] let's not be a discomfort to each other
[57:17] here let's be a comfort to everybody
[57:19] here
[57:22] praise God
[57:23] let me God use me so I can be a help to
[57:25] other people
[57:27] that I can make life easier for them by
[57:29] the grace of God
[57:31] I'm going to be a comfort to them
[57:33] because that's what Paul says the reason
[57:35] I'm listening these names these guys
[57:36] have been my helpers these guys have
[57:38] stood with me these guys have been my
[57:40] comfort
[57:42] you know this to be true like brother
[57:44] man said there's just special people in
[57:45] your life that you can get comfort from
[57:48] not everybody gives you comfort when you
[57:49] fellowship with them right
[57:51] hahaha
[57:52] my brother said you want to be nice to
[57:54] all people but then you got some special
[57:55] people
[57:56] I appreciate that in the Philippians
[57:57] series there
[58:00] we got to show love and we just got to
[58:02] trust that God will help us all to grow
[58:04] and Trust for one another praise God
[58:10] so Paul names them and they're noticed
[58:12] there's not many names that's the effect
[58:14] of preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[58:16] you get rejected so much you don't have
[58:18] a whole lot of people around you
[58:21] that's right
[58:24] you know we've had numerous people visit
[58:26] us years ago that if I would have been a
[58:27] tape Church they would have stayed here
[58:29] and come to our church
[58:31] but they left because I wouldn't play
[58:32] the tapes
[58:34] I'm glad they left
[58:37] but you know there's this pressure
[58:38] there's different people like there's
[58:39] pressure to cater to certain people
[58:42] but we got to stand on the word of God
[58:43] there's just those rejections going to
[58:45] happen
[58:46] just be prepared for that you stand on
[58:47] the word you're going to be rejected but
[58:49] Jesus is going to receive you praise God
[58:50] Amen
[58:51] rejected on Earth but not rejected in
[58:54] heaven in heaven you're accepting the
[58:56] Beloved praise God ah hallelujah amen
[59:00] oh
[59:01] apple fresh doesn't that sound familiar
[59:04] from part one
[59:06] epipherals who's one of you epperfist
[59:09] was the one who started this church
[59:11] in colossae a servant of Christ he
[59:13] salutes you always laboring fervent for
[59:16] you in prayers that ye may stand perfect
[59:18] and complete in all the will of God
[59:20] that's why I was praying that earlier
[59:21] for Napoleon and Albion
[59:25] because epifirst was constantly praying
[59:29] that the Saints would be mature lacking
[59:32] nothing spiritually and all their
[59:34] supplies would be liberally met and
[59:37] filled to the top we preach it on Sunday
[59:39] I don't want a half cup full I want a
[59:41] cup that runs over amen how many want
[59:43] that by God's grace you want to come to
[59:45] church half full or a quarter full no I
[59:48] wanted to fill up praise God I want
[59:50] God's spirit fill my heart and mind amen
[59:52] oh praise God hallelujah
[59:56] I don't want to be a half cup Christian
[59:58] or
[59:59] a one ounce Christian or something like
[1:00:01] that
[1:00:02] on my cup overflowing praise God
[1:00:05] Hallelujah
[1:00:07] and Paul says I bear record of that for
[1:00:10] Frisk he's got a great Zeal for the
[1:00:13] Saints and colossi for them in laodicea
[1:00:15] and also them in hieropolis which was
[1:00:18] phrygia that's the
[1:00:21] hieropolis was one of the cities of
[1:00:22] phrygio one of the provinces of phrygia
[1:00:25] I could never say that right
[1:00:28] and now look he was such a zealous
[1:00:29] prayer Warrior he was willing to pray
[1:00:31] for and the prophet said this guy has a
[1:00:33] burden to pray
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:37] Hallelujah may God give us a burden to
[1:00:38] pray for others praise God
[1:00:40] we everybody knew whoever first prayed
[1:00:42] for it was those three churches that was
[1:00:43] his prayer constantly praying constantly
[1:00:46] praying constantly praying help us to
[1:00:48] pray constantly for somebody by God
[1:00:51] 's Spirit can't pray for everybody right
[1:00:54] I can't pray for everybody I can't help
[1:00:55] everybody but I can pray for somebody
[1:00:57] I can pray to the walls come down amen
[1:01:00] amen thank God Amen
[1:01:04] Luke the Beloved Physician and demons
[1:01:06] greet you now Luke was a gentile
[1:01:08] physician who wrote the book of Acts and
[1:01:09] the Gospel of Luke
[1:01:11] he was also the strongest concordance
[1:01:13] called him an evangelist too
[1:01:16] but Demas later deserted Paul for the
[1:01:19] world now Church look at this
[1:01:22] Paul never told the Colossians he was
[1:01:24] going to fall away right here
[1:01:26] because Paul didn't know he was going to
[1:01:28] fall away
[1:01:29] the church said
[1:01:31] neither did Brother Branham know who's
[1:01:33] going to fall away
[1:01:36] a lot of people around brother Brown
[1:01:37] were finding out fell away bad from the
[1:01:40] faith
[1:01:42] and so people are making oh look they
[1:01:44] all fell away so brother man must be a
[1:01:45] bad person no if that's the case then
[1:01:46] Paul was a bad person
[1:01:50] Paul didn't say well greet demons but
[1:01:53] you all guys watch his life okay
[1:01:58] he didn't say that
[1:02:00] he said great Paul
[1:02:03] give my greeting I'm sorry give my
[1:02:05] greetings to Demas
[1:02:07] Paul didn't know he's going to fall away
[1:02:09] but yet he fell away he loved the
[1:02:11] present World more and he loves Paul's
[1:02:12] gospel
[1:02:15] remember Church 70 preachers left Jesus
[1:02:19] Christ
[1:02:21] God In the Flesh if 70 left Jesus there
[1:02:24] are I mean a lot a lot of people are
[1:02:25] going to leave me praise God because I'm
[1:02:26] I'm way less than Jesus
[1:02:29] way less wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:02:31] wait wait less infinitely less
[1:02:34] and so look people even left Paul
[1:02:36] despite the Miracles the Bible writing
[1:02:38] the prophecies all these gifts he spoke
[1:02:41] in tongues more than all of them
[1:02:42] hello
[1:02:45] and they still left him
[1:02:49] thank God all the children of God will
[1:02:51] be saved all that the father has given
[1:02:52] me will come unto me praise God
[1:02:56] oh it's beautiful he says salute the
[1:02:58] brother which are in laodicea and
[1:03:00] nymphis and the church which is in their
[1:03:02] house history says Nimbus was a wealthy
[1:03:04] zealous Christian from laodicea
[1:03:07] Hallelujah and he had a church in this
[1:03:09] house
[1:03:12] and when this epistle this Colossians
[1:03:14] epistle is read unto you cause of that
[1:03:16] also be read in the church and
[1:03:17] laodiceans and that you likewise read
[1:03:20] the epistle from laodicea
[1:03:22] look Church they had preachers Paul told
[1:03:23] them to preach but they also read Paul's
[1:03:25] letters
[1:03:27] same thing today
[1:03:28] right we read Paul's letters and we
[1:03:30] still got preachers Hallelujah
[1:03:32] right same thing
[1:03:34] it's not it's not pressed play and sit
[1:03:36] down that's that's not what Paul said
[1:03:38] Paul said read my letters because
[1:03:40] they're the word of God and then preach
[1:03:42] he said be instant in season and out of
[1:03:44] season praise God Amen
[1:03:48] and say to archipus take heed to the
[1:03:51] ministry which thou has received in the
[1:03:53] Lord that thou fulfill it now notice he
[1:03:55] calls out this man's name in front of
[1:03:57] everybody this was read to the
[1:03:59] laodiceans this is read in the
[1:04:00] Colossians
[1:04:02] archipus who is archipus we don't know
[1:04:06] but he had such an important Ministry
[1:04:09] that Paul calls him out
[1:04:11] and says everybody encourage him make
[1:04:14] sure he doesn't quit on his ministry
[1:04:18] take heed to it
[1:04:22] now we're all human so Satan's all going
[1:04:25] to try to attack us in our Ministries
[1:04:26] that we have because listen everybody's
[1:04:28] got a ministry here
[1:04:31] if you don't think you do you have been
[1:04:32] reading the Bible lately
[1:04:34] everybody's got a Ministry
[1:04:36] we're all supposed to come with a Psalm
[1:04:38] a proverb right a word a testimony all
[1:04:41] these things we're supposed to come to
[1:04:42] the house of God with the anointing of
[1:04:44] God on us and the church said
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:48] praise God
[1:04:51] so what Ministry does Jesus want you to
[1:04:54] fulfill tonight
[1:04:58] does any of us are any of us slipping in
[1:04:59] anything in any area
[1:05:02] is Paul the prophet makes us bold claim
[1:05:05] tell octopus take heed
[1:05:08] don't neglect your ministry
[1:05:10] he calls him out imagine that
[1:05:12] your name gets called out tell brother
[1:05:15] so-and-so tell brother Jesse take heed
[1:05:17] to your ministry make sure you fulfill
[1:05:19] it
[1:05:20] well that means he was struggling with
[1:05:21] fulfillment
[1:05:23] right
[1:05:26] take he that you fulfill it
[1:05:28] in other words whatever you start you
[1:05:29] better finish it
[1:05:31] praise God if God LED you to start
[1:05:34] something
[1:05:35] or finish it
[1:05:37] Hallelujah I've been kind of sharp
[1:05:39] tonight
[1:05:40] it's the Holy Spirit though
[1:05:42] Holy Spirit
[1:05:43] now strong concordance says this letter
[1:05:45] to the laosceans was the same as the
[1:05:47] book of Ephesians which that makes sense
[1:05:48] because we never found the letter to the
[1:05:50] laodiceans it makes sense
[1:05:53] which I've already preached the entire
[1:05:55] book of Ephesians to our church here
[1:05:57] and here's the closing scripture let's
[1:05:58] stand to our feet musicians can come
[1:05:59] Malachi's not here but that's okay he'll
[1:06:01] get here soon Lydia can play for us
[1:06:03] go ahead there's America perfect time
[1:06:06] everybody
[1:06:08] you're Redeeming the time sir
[1:06:12] what a way to end the letter
[1:06:14] the salutation by the hand of me Paul
[1:06:18] remember
[1:06:19] my bonds remember I'm a prisoner now I
[1:06:23] don't think he's saying oh remember me
[1:06:25] because I'm such a poor person
[1:06:27] I believe he's not seeking sympathy he's
[1:06:30] reminding them remember the cost to
[1:06:33] following Jesus Christ
[1:06:35] someday it might get you in jail
[1:06:38] for sure it's going to get you rejected
[1:06:39] by friends and family for sure
[1:06:43] like many of us have experienced
[1:06:46] remember this gospel has sent me to
[1:06:49] prison
[1:06:51] I'm a prisoner because of the Gospel of
[1:06:53] Jesus Christ
[1:06:54] don't forget that
[1:06:56] would that motivate you to finish your
[1:06:57] ministry you're not locked up in a
[1:06:59] prison like Paul Paul says tell archipus
[1:07:02] don't forget your ministry fulfill what
[1:07:05] God has called you to do what a warning
[1:07:08] what a warning
[1:07:10] if God's called you to do something
[1:07:12] let's finish it by God's grace
[1:07:14] this also shows his authenticity as a
[1:07:17] real possible real Apostles real
[1:07:19] preachers are hated of the world
[1:07:21] right when they really find out what you
[1:07:23] what you preach
[1:07:24] they hate you
[1:07:26] like Lydia Malachi had a piano teacher
[1:07:28] and sweet sweet woman I thought this
[1:07:30] woman loved us and everything as soon as
[1:07:31] she found out I preached about makeup
[1:07:32] and short hair
[1:07:35] never treated me good again
[1:07:37] boy I became the enemy you were like
[1:07:39] that
[1:07:40] and I got Bible four I got Bible verses
[1:07:42] for it
[1:07:43] I became I went from the happy the best
[1:07:45] guy I went to the I went to the enemy
[1:07:47] real quick
[1:07:50] I'm not coming over anymore I'm not
[1:07:51] training up them in piano anymore you
[1:07:53] won't see me again
[1:07:54] I hope I see you in heaven that's all I
[1:07:55] can say
[1:07:57] by the grace of God
[1:08:00] you really when you stand for the word
[1:08:03] of God you'll be rejected but Jesus
[1:08:05] Christ will always accept you praise God
[1:08:07] his last words
[1:08:09] Grace be with you how many want God's
[1:08:11] Own unmerited favor
[1:08:12] that's what I want with me I want God's
[1:08:14] favor with me how many believe it's with
[1:08:16] you by God's grace
[1:08:18] more than ever before I know like I said
[1:08:20] when Simon's here I know God loves me
[1:08:24] now I may have to suffer of course we
[1:08:25] have to suffer more as we get older but
[1:08:27] at this point in my life I could say
[1:08:28] without a shadow of a doubt God truly
[1:08:30] loves me his grace and favor has shined
[1:08:33] upon my life I hope you can say the same
[1:08:35] by the grace of God
[1:08:41] there's that prayer Warrior there
