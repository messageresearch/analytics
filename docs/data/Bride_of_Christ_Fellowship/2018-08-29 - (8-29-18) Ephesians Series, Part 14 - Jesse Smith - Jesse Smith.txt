[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] like the readout of pizzas chapter 4 tonight I just kind of had on my heart to go back to the Ephesian series I haven't preached on since January but this is part 14 of the series fees in Chapter four like to preach on the fivefold ministry a little bit more tonight by God but having some good conversations with the Saints brother Aaron and I've been talking about the fivefold ministry and went on in Jeffersonville we talked quite a little about it I'm sorry quite a bit about it because we fellowship with some of the Saints there at the voice of God recordings and then sister Wendy gave me encouraging thought so I like to preach that as well - nice by God's grace look at this tonight by God's grace B's in Chapter four like to start reading at verse 10 Bible says in Ephesians 4:10 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now this is what the fivefold ministry will keep us from being if we're feeding on the true Word of God that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just maybe lift your hand there at home Heavenly Father we just come reverently we thank you for this Eternal Word we give you glory tonight we ask o God that this this portion of Scripture will become more dear to us more real to us through the preaching of your word speak to us now anoint me the speaker annoying these the ears anoint them and their homes were live-streaming those on the archived may they feast on your word Lord may become such a reality to each one of us in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen god bless you bein seated so I'd like to look at that scripture tonight and this is part fourteen as we said and we just want to briefly remember in our series brother Brandon would mention Scofield and the prophet of God said there was three themes and I'm sorry Scofield says there was three themes in the book of Ephesians the first thing was the believers exalted position in Christ remember how we were supposed to be seated in heavenly places we're supposed to live in heavenly atmospheres and I were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world all those beautiful truths about our exalted position that was chapter 1 verse 1 all the way to chapter 2 verse 10 the second theme is there's one body of Christ composable Jew and Gentile that's reverse or chapter 2 verse 11 all the way to chapter 3 verse 21 the third and final theme is the one we're on now is the walk and warfare of the believer so our portion tonight in Ephesians chapter 4 is about the walk of the believer will see the warfare later on in chapter 4 and then chapter 5 and then even chapter 6 shows the warfare as well by the grace of God I just want to review briefly on part 13 I just want to go to Psalm 68 so if you have your Bibles go to Psalm 68 first one there's only 11 verses in this chapter Psalm 68 because remember when when Paul writes about Jesus ascending and and and giving gifts unto men and captivity being captive he's Paul's actually quoting Psalm 68 and one of the authors or one of the commentators says that this Psalm was probably sang or played when David brought up the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem the right way not the wrong way when he was trying to do God a service outside of the will of God but the right way when he did the time and season and worth and thus done according to do God a service as well Ram taught in that service trying to do God a service without it being I'm sorry with it being as well how we'd say so let's look at verse Psalm 68 verse 1 let God arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of God so how does God's presence sound right now pretty powerful amen all enemies flee all demons flee at the power Jesus Christ verse 3 but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before God yay let them exceedingly rejoice o Allah we should be glad in God's presence tonight verse 4 sing unto God singing praises to his name extol his name Chuck father of the fatherless and a judge of the widow's is God in His holy habitation so those who don't have a father for those who feel like they have no provider like a widow or widower or those who feel like they have no dwelling place Jesus Christ is your father Jesus Christ is your provider and he is your shelter where you stay amen verse 6 God said it the solitary and Families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains so if you need a family God will put you in a family where is that that's your home church and you bring it out those who are bound change so if you're if you're chaining up the addictions Jesus Christ will set you free I'm a witness of that he met with the rebellious try and a trial starts out a trial and so when people are trying to serve God but their their experience is dry it's because they're not living the way they ought to they're not abiding in the presence of God in their local church we would say Oh God when thou wentest forth before thy people when that is marched through the wilderness a lap the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the Friends of God even sinai itself was moved at the presence of God the God of Israel now Oh God did send a plentiful rain where by thou disconfirmed not inheritance when it was weary amen so see rain or anointing of the Holy Spirit is confirmation that God is with us amen when God sends a fresh anointing when you feel revived and inspired by the Holy Spirit and you feel as blessings poured on upon you that's confirmation that you're in the Covenant amen verse 10 my congregation have brought therein now oh god has prepared of thy goodness for the poor the Lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home divided the spoil now I'm going to skip down to verse 17 the chariots of God are 20,000 even thousands of angels the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the holy place now here's what Paul quotes when Paul talks about Jesus resurrecting ascending and then sending down gifts here's where he's quoting now as ascended on high that was led captivity captive now has received gifts for men yay for the rebellious also that the Lord might dwell among them amen so the fivefold ministry was given to the church that God might dwell among us how many want God as well among them if you do then you should take our church services extremely seriously because you will feel God's presence if God's true gifts are here and if we're truly trusting in God will feel the Friends of the Lord amen that's God's Way he says it right there look at verse 19 blessed be the Lord who daily loaded us with benefits even the god of our salvation say la I don't know about you but Sunday after brother Keith Brandon preached I felt like I was going home loaded with all blessings on my back now I always carry a backpack but really spiritually you know we should be carrying all the blessings of God out of church you got healing it's in your backpack deliverance if it's in your backpack if you need joy or gladness or you need some hope it's in your backpack you should daily be loaded with all God's benefits amen that's the scripture and this is where Paul pulls that idea of the fivefold ministry God giving gifts God wanting to dwell among us through the preaching of the word I hope that's how you feel when when when people are really hungry for God's Word you can feel God's presence you can feel that God is here you can feel that God is speaking to your heart in fact I hope that's how you feel right now that God is speaking to each and every one of your hearts that way we know we're in his presence amen so this is the context where it's taken from now let's go back to Ephesians chapter 4 and let's look at verse 12 now I never really put this together like I did tonight but there are seven benefits to the fivefold ministry listed and we know seven is a number of perfection right or complete I'm sorry completion three is perfection seven is completion so God gives us a perfect complete spiritual walk through the five gifts of the fivefold ministry now at the end of the sermon I'm going to get to kind of the attacks on the fivefold ministry which is what we were fellowshiping and talking about and when we went to Jeffersonville at the beginning of the month there's so many attacks on the phone hacking and saying all the fivefold ministry has failed the job done and we'll show how that's wrong will show how no Christian can ever fail you know we went to Jeffersonville and somebody said Oh on the fivefold ministry is failing that's impossible it's impossible for a Holy Ghost Christian to fail because there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus it's impossible now men and women or men that are pretending to be in the fivefold ministry they can fail but a true God called preacher can never fail because of blood of Jesus Christ has already forgiven him and he's more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus and amen so it's wrong to say that the fivefold ministry has failed it hasn't it's accomplishing all that God purpose for it to accomplish amen let's go to verse well in verse 12 we'll see the first few like I said that they're set and then it keeps us from four walls as we'll see later in verse believe it's verse 14 but let's go to verse 12 so why did why did Christ send the fivefold ministry that he might fill every Church the Bible said that he might fill all things God wants to feel fill everyone in the church so he sends the five gifts did you enjoy the evangelists gift from brother Keith on Sunday oh I just I just get so excited and happy I got a shout and scream you know I got a rejoice and raise my hands because that is feeding my soul it's loading me with benefits and I need all five today they're trying to make it just one brother branham just one all you need is brother Graham you don't need anything else I'm sorry that breaks the word of God we cannot break the word of God we need all five yes we need brother Adams ministry it's part but there's four more and we can't we must live by every word that proceeds out of God's mouth amen not just just some but every word we need every piece in God's puzzle to make the picture clear so verse well he sends it for the perfecting of the Saints now that word perfect means to equip or completely furnish so we've all we've all probably moved into apartment before right or you murdered moved into your own house before how many ever had to furnish your house with your own furniture we have many times there are numerous times we moved when I first went in the couch I had to furnish everything the only thing that was there was the air conditioner I didn't have to furnish that but I had to furnish everything else I'm sorry the bed was there too and the mattress and everything else I had to furnish the the toiletries and the sheets of the pillow you name it clothes everything else everything had to be furnished so that's spiritually what the fivefold ministry does it furnishes you or it equips you with everything you need to live a Christian life Amen hallelujah more than perfect or the equipping of the Saints oh I don't feel like I have enough equipment brother just to do the job well you just hang around the fivefold ministry it will equip you to do the job amen that's what the Word of God says either the Bible's line or the Bible is true and we know the Bible is right amen so we must remember that and if we don't feel equipped it's either the preachers fault it's either my fault or whoever's preaching and we need to go talk to them and tell them they're wrong and show them they're wrong or it's our fault we're not receiving the word by faith we're not mixing the word with faith we've got to mix the word with faith brother Branham says you've got when you feed on the word you've got to go exercise it he said I get spiritually obese he says just like if you eat too much naturally and you know exercise you're going to get obese and that's how it is we have to hear the word and then what the preacher preached we've got to go talk to others about it we've got to go we've got to go pray about it in the prayer closet we've got to do something with the food that God gave us amen so perfecting of the Saints equipping you giving you the tools you need next it works the ministry which is undertake undertaking of the ministry so the fivefold ministry it gives you your equipment and then it gives you the undertake in other words it tells you the undertaking it tells you the work you're supposed to do in the ministry and the word of the fivefold ministry will never point you outside of God's Bible it will always keep you in the Bible I'll never call woman to preach right I'll never call Manta to submit to his wife and let the wife rule and I never call that number called man to be a or a man to be violent or aggressive it will call us to do what the Word of God tells us to do next this is powerful it edifies the body of Christ so all five preaching gifts will edify it which means building up it also means promotes another's growth in Christian wisdom piety happiness and holiness how many want to be wise how many wanted a pot pious life how many want to be happy and holy the way you do that is you listen to the Bible ministry receive what they're preaching and it will exactly that it will edify you it will build your happiness up it will build up your holiness amen it'll lift up your wisdom it will give you so much wisdom if you receive it as God giving you daily benefits amen but you've got to receive it by faith and not by intellect just my face alright verse 13 so we've already seen three things out of the seven let's go to verse 13 here's the fourth till we all come in the unity which is agreement of the faith so that means the four thing is everyone and the bride of Jesus Christ will have faith that agrees on the Word of God everyone will agree about the rapture whether it's you know it just run around enough to come back or or is a return ministry or not or this is the rapture before the tribulation or after it's here through five gifts to bring us to a unity of the faith all the bride will agree about rapturing faith amen all the bride will agree about perfect faith because the Holy Spirit will unite us to agree on God's Word amen and it's supernaturals not by it's not by one man ruling and telling others what to preach it's by the Holy Ghost telling all the preachers went to preach amen and he brings that unity verse 13 and next is the knowledge of the Son of God so knowledge is precise truth that's what it means precise truth the knowledge of the Son of man unto now this is if we do those five things equip the Saints work the Mintos find your ministry build up the body grown up and and it's the precise truth to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ glory now this this means you will come unto a perfect man unto the portion of the maturity of the fullness of Christ how many want to be mature like Jesus remember what is the true anointing its its ultimate power with control that's the true anointing of the Holy Ghost you know you have all the power of God in your heart all the pain but you have your under control you're not doing what you want to do you're under the control of God and you'll only do what the father says do just like Jesus he had all power all faith everything like that when he was under the control he said I only do what the father shows me amen that's why the bride the bride when she's under control the Holy Spirit she doesn't try she doesn't try to do things she waits to the Holy Spirit leezar and then she marches ahead amen she cut because she's mature she has a measure of the portion or I'm sorry a portion of the maturity of Christ it builds us up to a portion of the maturity of Jesus Christ amen now verse 14 here's the four things we will no longer be if we have the true preaching if we receive the true preaching of the fivefold ministry we will not be children that's the first one you'll not be a baby Christian right you'll not like like like Paul said when I was a child I spoke as a child when you're a mature Christian you won't talk like a baby immature Christian you'll talk like a mature Christian you won't be a child the second thing he says sorry verse 14 we be no more children we won't be immature we'll put away childish things we won't be tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of man and by cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to the sea so toss means agitated like waves now if you've never been to the ocean well you should go on youtube and watch it because you can see all the waves as they they're agitated right they're tossed back and forth you can see them smashed against the rocks because there's so much agitation smashed up against ships if you want there's so much agitation with the waves but cor we should not be tossed from one doctor to the next from one problem to the next from one idea or opinion to the next we should be sound and stable not tossed around not constantly agitated am I saved or not am I filled with the Holy Ghost or not am I gonna go on the rapture or not we should know we should be solid Christians amen the third thing we are not carried by the winds which is which means pushed into doubts and hesitation and opinions so this these two kind of go together toss and carry we're not carrying around by this guy's opinion or that guy's opinion the only opinion we care about is the Holy Spirit's opinion amen and brother Branham would have given us or has given us the Holy Spirit's opinion and it's the Holy Bible by God's grace and if we really believe the five-o ministry we will not be to see which means to roam out of the true way we won't be led astray and let out into diverse lusts and and led away from the Word of God if we're truly feeding on the Word of God that's preached through the fivefold ministry Jesus said let no man deceive you so the true fivefold ministry will not deceive you they will teach you precise truth right from God's word that will equip you strengthen you edify you give you everything you need to become enough pure we say full measure of maturity of Jesus Christ amen glory amen yeah you know this but the Bible teaches a love and devotion for the house of God because that's where the fivefold ministry is David said one thing I desired that I will seek after that I may dwell the house the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to acquire in a simple the beauty today is not the preachers themselves it's the Word of God that they're preaching to us the beautiful thing amongst us today is not each other it's the promise of God that is unfailing amen and that's what David said that's why when he said I want to live in God's house so I can see the beauty of God I can see the character of Jesus now let me get to some quotes from brother Brandon you know now we know David said I set my affection to the house of God in other words David said I'm gonna set my heart on the church I'm gonna love church more than everything else cuz program tells us that same thing Colossians has set your affections on things above no brother Brandon tells us this brother branham says this he says this is God keeps his word fifty-seven to go to church you don't have to tell them people that through rain they'll go through death to go to church sure they love it they just got to get there that's all there is to it it's their life if they don't they feel like they're perishing amen if you don't go to church you feel like you're dying and the church said if you don't be like that and you're already dead right you're already dead if you don't you should feel done it when you don't go to church if you don't you're already dead you're not born again you need to get born again levan said you go there to worship and to go home refreshed we are gonna leave this church service refreshed now I'm not leaving physically but we're gonna end this church and I'm going to stay in my house and I'm gonna be refreshing God's presence that means afterwards we should be able to treat each other with love and kindness before we go to bed right if I'm in my family I can't it's my hug my son something's wrong fresh when I leave the church amen the man said if you complain about going to church he says you never touched the resurrection brother when you when the resurrections come into your heart you long to do it there's something that you just can't keep away from it something inside Alleluia well the RAM said if you love God he says you couldn't why are you away from church you couldn't chain you away from it you can't hide a believer from his God Amen you'd find a way if someone tied you up in Chains their wires you find a way to break those chains and wires chips is just to go to church that's the brother Ram says wow it's so true he said there's something wrong with you if you love the world better than you love prayer meetings or you rather watch a television program to pray there's something wrong with you if we rather spend time on our phones and pray something's wrong with us god help us all and everybody should have say amen to that amen I'll say to everybody we feel like we need more time on our phone or something wrong with us we need to pray more all right from Graham said if I live in a city and they just believe one thing that Jesus was divine yet all the rest was wrong so if they only believed that Jesus was God and yet all the other doctor was wrong brother Brown said I go to that church if I only agree with one thing they preached for the RAM side still go to that church how many people feel that way most people just sit at home and if they just disagree on one thing it's the opposite for most people they can agree on 99% but if one thing's wrong they won't go to church my brother Graham says the opposite if I disagree on 99 and I've got one I'll go to church there oh my they got through a prophet he said if I can't get a whole loaf of bread I'll take a slice I'll go listen worship the Lord show him I'm doing my part I wanted to know I'm alive I want everybody know which side I'm on other lujah x1 he says we must he says seeing the day is approaching we must assemble ourselves more off together we must love in our hearts to come to church if we don't love coming to God he said love God coming together he said I think we should constantly long to be in worship anywhere to worship the Lord that should be our constant longing you know I can't wait to get to church I can't wait to be in God's presence and if you love God that's how you feel that's right well the banner says this Christ the mystery don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers to see God must not be in people's hearts if they're not constantly waiting to get the church they can shake people's hands and be in God's house God must up either because of God's there you can't wait to get there hallelujah and again this is what brother Branham says so I ask again do all the people that say they believe everything brother Branham says do they believe this are they longing to get to church are they constantly they could could someone not wire them away from church is that how much they love God hold on Loran says the Holy Spirit makes you so hungry to go to church you can't stay away from church that's in part in 1963 you're so hungry you can't stay away from church in convinced then concerned brother have said the Spirit of God will run you right straight to the church every time the door opens for fellowship who will run you there not Satan Saint will keep you away the Holy Ghost will run you church every time the doors are open I mean Sunday morning Sunday night if it's there we have a Sunday night service Wednesday night Saturday night service if the Holy Spirit's in you it will drive you there hallelujah all right Oprah who said the American people want to be entertained they say all on Wednesday night to see who loves sushi or whatever program it is that shows what's in your heart if you love God you'd be at church brother Branham says you've got to get back to the church back to the Bible back to Christ amen Loran says is if you don't have a home church you'll die spiritually you'll just win no way that's what I was telling some of the brother was on our way I have a place where you call that place your home just wondering which is led astray what the Bible said you're deceived you're led astray you're just wandering you really don't have a home you have to have a home church or you're led astray by the enemy that's right program said this he prays for new converts in 1960 and in his I be not afraid he says may they find a good hold a good church home and there remain faithful at the post of duty until death shall set them free from this earthly course amen we should we equally go there until death God has not as a place where he wants us to stay there until he returns amen perhaps that every man ought to have a home church not just from pillar to post church somewhere where you pay your time and somewhere that you help support the cause take your choice but don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group Amen hallelujah I think we know most of these huh I don't think I need to keep going on those because most of us know this now look what brother Branham said I told you this a few weeks ago and knoweth it not 1965 brother Branham said now we got in towards daylight this morning so Sunday morning he got into Jefferson on a Sunday morning and I had about three hours of sleep and I'm pretty tired but when the church when it come time to come to church why I come down so came to church on three hours of sleep after driving all night brother Nevelson why don't you just go up and greet the people and talk to them and he said brother no I haven't even opened my Bible hardly he said well go out and say something and sister now I don't know how you do it he's a very persuasive fella he said brother man ends up preaching a message and knoweth it not about revelation three in the layers interchange and speaks about thus saith the Lord I believe he gave up he gave a few thus say the Lord's in this message on three hours of sleep I'm not saying that people work all night you know they have to come to church but I'm just saying look at the example brother Branham said he preached an hour and 45 minutes on three hours of sleep he could have stayed at home and slept when he came to the house of God to be with the people of God he didn't want them to be a church and him laying at home that's how a prophet modeled his preaching that's why I love about brother Branham he just didn't preach things he lived what he preached and that's what we must do we must live what we preach well Graham says this how can you stay at home and be as good of a Christian as you would be a church you can't do it you cannot be a good Christian if you don't go to church he says read the word the Holy Spirit feeds on the word the Bible is God's spiritual diet first church the Holy Spirit's the one who brings it to you places it in your heart with Thanksgiving you honor it amen so the very least we should do is come to God's house and thank him for the Word of God that's the very least we should say God make it so real to me and I can take this sermon that daddy's preaching and uncle Simon's preach it make it so real to me and lord I thank you for this and let me live what you've preached to me amen you can't be as good of a Christian if we don't hear the word of God no my turn don't have a choice what's your welven choice in a few short years and you have to choose up to the side am I gonna be a good of a Christian to stay at home or my gonna be the best Christian I can be ignored of the house and I hope you'll choose to go to the house of God well the man who said the fellow told me I can be a Christian and stay at home just as well brother Branham said no you can't you've got to be together with the rest of the body he's bless us together and how many places in Christ Jesus amen program said above all things under God and honor his house above everything under God honor his house okay now let me ask you a few questions actually let me read its thirsting for life 1960 the pleasure of a Christian is serving the Lord at the house of God it should be our joy not a burden it should be a joy and pleasure to go to God's house hear the word of God and serve God don't you like to come to church and pray for people don't you like to come to church and sing not a special or sing for him or just lift up your hands to God doesn't that make you feel good that's to bring you pleasure because God's Spirit is anointing you right it's freshly raining down upon you and it's giving you all the spiritual vitamins and all the all the benefits he's loading you with daily as we saw earlier and you get to be closer to God you get to feel God's presence and know that he's with you there could hardly be any better benefit than that did it for God presence to dwell with us continually amen hallelujah brother Graham said when we sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost comes upon us empowering us with gifts signs wonders and miracles it's the closest thing to heaven there is on earth hey management praise God think about how the miracles the different miracles we've had in our church in our sister Murray being healed of the bleeding my wife being healed of migraines I was healed twice in service think of all those blessings that's the closest tweaking is the church his first debate with other believers bless word and become empowered Christians amen that's that's what God wants us to do we can feel like heaven comes down to earth hallelujah now let me share a few things here I want to share this from my heart so I said this before when I said the home church is the most powerful weapon against Satan the home churches revival services are great but the home church services are the most powerful weapons that God has for the church and this is based on something sister Wendy shared with me that I preached and I I didn't even realize it I preached on the waters of separation have you ever studied that brother okay if some if somebody or something died in there that the waters in separation after three days and they had to clean out their house and three days they'd go get sprinkled they still could I come to the outer court yet then they had to come back on the seventh day so four days later they had to be sprinkled once they got sprinkled on the seventh day now they could come into the outer court they could sacrifice an animal and then they could see the priest go to the holy place and if it was if it was the name of torment they could see the high priests you know they know he brought in the holy supporters right but if he thought something dead he couldn't even get into the outer court and that's how we are because the Bible says we can grieve the Holy Spirit if we watch one evil thing or if we say one lie then we are cut off from God's presence that's the time when we don't even join coming to church because the Bible said that if they didn't get sprinkled they were cut off from the congregation so God showed a beautiful time and program said that type caused a Jewish rabbi to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and speak in tongues that's how powerful that type is and sister Wendy was sharing this quote this type with me she said and the Bible says we get sprinkled on the third day and the seventh thing well that works out to Wednesday Sunday because Sunday that Monday Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday is the third day and then four days later is Sunday so it works out beautifully we need to get the anointing on Wednesday get the noisy on Sunday and we'll be back in God's presence you see it works out it's a beautiful time that's why the home church is the most powerful weapon against Satan it's getting sprinkle it's gonna know anything on Wednesday anointing on Sunday and then we're back and perfect fellowship with Jesus Christ now let me ask you what is more powerful which testimony is more powerful you get excited and refreshed by God once every six months when we have a special meetings or you get anointed every Wednesday and Sunday and get excited every Wednesday and Sunday what's more powerful which one do you think is more powerful Pais a week that's more powerful you know what brother Graham said you loved about brother Neville was that he was the same man every day he wasn't he never said he wasn't up and down one day the next he was steady on fire loving God he said he was steady every single day he said he's always been Ormond Neville always the same man see so that shows Hermann Neville lived in the Holy of Holies and we've got to live in the Holies of Holies always refreshed always the same always in his presence always worshipped me always saying our lives are saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which and along the same lines which is a true test of spiritual maturity someone who can be early to church once every six months and get excited to pray for the guest preacher coming in one every six months or every service you come early to pray and seek God every service which one shows more maturity the one who can faithfully serve God every single service the Bible says how often should we be renewed the Bible said the Bible said be renewed day by day the Bible says die daily so your and I our behavior in our local church is the true test and the true the the true witness of our spiritual condition whether good or bad and the church said how you act in your home church how faithful you are to your home Church your post of duty is the true litmus test for your spiritual walk with God it shows which side or it shows how close you're living to God that's exactly right so which is more powerful because it's someone who's more on fire every time every time the doors are open or someone who just gets excited or dedicated when they know a guest preachers coming in it's the faithful Christian its faithful you want to be faithful by God's grace all right now let's look here briefly at the attack on the fivefold ministry okay just give me about 15 more minutes by God's grace I throw it really hurts I'm going back to work and sing-song leading and preaching my throat really hurts so I need to rest after the service I don't want to lose my voice again I told the Lord I take better care of my voice I'll try not to shout as much well let's see what brother Ram said brother Graham said in the church age book Quora the chorus of against Moses and Aaron the prophet in the fight and the ministry the priesthood the prophet priesthood and that's tight today - brother Branham in the five hole ministry prophet priesthood chorus spoke against them is that we're all holy we all can minister we can all burn incense before God brother Graham said the chorus today chorus a day have say they've styled themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 10 through 13 that God gave the church has failed how did you get sent Cora says Moses and Aaron have failed we can all do this we went to voice of God and one of the brothers I love him but he said the fivefold ministry has failed oh my church Oh Cora is the one who says Moses brother man tells us the cores of today say the fivefold ministry has failed we just gotta lean on brother branham are you gonna believe brother branham or somebody a voice of God or somebody in Arizona or somebody in in Ohio who are you gonna believe we're gonna believe the Word of God amen well Adam said here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy called the gang sayings of Korah and they don't even know they fulfilled it so anyone who criticizes the fivefold ministry says it's failed these preachers are no good all these things like that they are the cores of today when they're Preet when they're speaking about the true preachers like I said I'm not talking about the preachers who who commit adultery and are hungry for money and lust after things of the world they are chorus you know there there there Balaam i'ts there Balaam eyes when I'm talking about the true fivefold ministry when people speak against that and say it's failed they are the cores of today and we've got to be the Aaron up today amen we got to be the true ministry we got we got a rally around the Moses of the day brother brands ministry amen it's exactly right brother Graham said this he said this seven church age mention messenger will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for one moment not by one iota brother branham would be in the word exactly as God gave it to Paul so show me where did Paul ever say I'm the only one that preaches I have the trkage messenger I'm the only one who preaches everybody else sit down and shut up when did Paul ever say that he never said that he told Timothy to preach the word be instant in season out of season rightly divide the word of truth amen so anyone that says only brother branham should preach they broken the pattern of the Holy Spirit and now there they've taken an antichrist spirit now they can be forgiven if they repent but they've got an antichrist spirit Alleluia well Graham says the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts so any church that doesn't continue live preachers live five fold ministry creatures is breaking the Word of God it's exactly right now some people say well brother Ram told people they can play tapes that was only there's only three there's only three quotes on tape churches and two of them say you know you should go to church and not have tape service the one time brother Graham said you could have tape service was when there was no churches around you because I just read you the quote where brother Graham said if I disagreed on 99% and just agreed on one thing I would go to that church amen brother Brandon did not tell people to stay home and stay away from Christians he modeled it and live by gather with other Christians come to the house of God see the beauty of God hear the beautiful Word of God receive it leave loaded with all the blessings and spiritual promises of God that you might be able to serve God and live the right kind of Christian life amen well the band said the true church will I strive to be like the book of Acts hallelujah all right now let me know do a few more years this one came by God's grace hope everybody understands and I'm not attacking this precious brother I'm not attacking these precious brothers in Jeffersonville but on the show I'm telling you is that they say brother branham they say they're fine brother branham but their brother Brown shows that they're not because they're attacking and saying the fivefold ministry fails they're going against the very word that they say they believe so here's the attack here's here's someone they attack they want less live preaching but member God's pattern from Acts cannot change God always used a man to keep the garden a living man I never had a dead man - till the till the gardener - the soil and that's how God that's a church a woman represents a garden right and so a church represents a garden and God always had a living man tilling the soil working those hearts right breaking up the stony with the stony grounds of the heart right breaking up the fallow ground that he might plant the seed of God's Word in the hearts of the people and if you order it if I water with price it'll grow off into a great heavily plant a pen it will produce the fruit of the Spirit if we let God's Word break up our follow grounds and we take all the rocks out and we have good honest hearts before God people say brother Branham is their pastor but brother Branham said in the future home I will always be your pastor so brother Rama even himself says I'm not always going to be a bastard well brother Ram cannot be your pastor then because he said he wouldn't always be their pastor but but no accountability my pastor what they're really saying is that I'm not accountable to any living man I'm accountable to a dead man well either that's not in the scripture we never find that Christians are always accountable to the leaders the living leaders that God places them for example Paul told Timothy warned that warn them that are unruly if a person who has brother Rama as their pastor is breaking the Word of God they're not going to play the tape where brother branham rebukes their sin and their brother random can't leave the tape and warn them of their hey brother branham cannot administer church discipline right you need a living pastor to go out if there if there's a if there's a discrepancy between two families you can't take a tape and set it to our tape of itself won't go and try to bring reconciliation just sit there you need a living loan him to go and unite two families are two individuals because if one person has odd against another Jesus I'd go to that person if that doesn't work get somebody else and then bring it before the church if you tell the tape we'll take you know you you've got the announces before the church they won't repent the tape will just sit there it won't do it you need a living vessel to carry out Church order so people are saying I don't have to answer to anybody I don't want to be accountable I can live however I want and nobody can tell me I'm wrong that's what they're saying when they're saying oh brother branham's my pastor they're saying they don't want accountability remember Hebrews 13 said that God's ministers will give an account of the souls of the people that means you know that everyone is accountable to a pastor everyone is accountable to a pastor or a preacher because that's what God's pattern always is all right one of the biggest concerns about the attacks on the fivefold ministry is that people are saying every word brother random sentence that saith the Lord now we went to Jeffersonville and I asked them point blank the grandson of one of the program's closest friends in Jeffersonville I asked him point-blank do people in brother and his family and do you believe every word brother Bram said there's a snake Lord and they basically said yes because we don't know what's the state Florida what what's not and I thought how sad is that they're so afraid that they're gonna make a mistake with us saith the Lord that they just say everything is though saith the Lord well brother branham said that's tommyrot if you if you say every word I said as I say the Lord brother incest tommyrot he said that's one of the most awfulest thing you can do is make me infallible he said that see that proves those people who are scared that proves they're not born again because the holy spirit does not give the spirit of fear amen but a power love and a sound mind and I told the brother to his face I said well this is how I do that I know I know every word brother Ram said it's not enough say the Lord but this is how you know the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth amen the Holy Ghost will guide you than that the Holy Ghost will show you he'll point to the Word of God if you're not sure the Holy Ghost will always point you to God's Bible and then you need two or three witnesses and then that will tell you that it's thus saith the Lord just like with water baptism there's not two or three witnesses of people being baptized father son Holy Ghost so you know that's not thus saith the Lord but there's five examples of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Jesus Lord all these things and so the Bible tells us what the st. the Lord is amen so even romance family members say every word he said was up the son say the Lord and yet brother Graham said that's time you run that's awful to see they're scared and that's because they're not they're not they don't have to gift him down their life and that's what I told him I said a preacher with the gift of God can rightly divide the word of God because it's not his ability it's the gift from Christ the gift from Christ to edify the body to position the body to do all those things that Bible ministry supposed to do he's got power from the Holy Ghost into it it's not him it's the Holy Ghost through him amen remember brother Ram sharam says the spirit of the nickel and ISM is to conquer the lady it's to put all the holiness in one man and the church has no longer any Holy Ghost that's what they're trying to his brother branham they're just trying to give all the holiness to brother Branham when he sees the only one that can do he's all of it can do miracles we better listen to a tape have the Spirit of God here that's okay it's okay listen to tape in your home but it should be the same spirit that is willing to brother Ram should now be on preachers a day to preach the same word to raise our faith to get the same results amen and we've got to be careful today like you with 5-pole ministry not to let them be annoying to once we've got to happen that's why we've got to come too early to church and pray and get the Holy Spirit on us so at so Paul said everyone has a song everyone has a hint everyone has a revelation everyone has a tongue everybody should have some leadership with the Holy Spirit when they come to church that's exactly right amen brother Branham said the highest office in the world is a minister now that's not to make the preachers prideful but that's to show you that the minister is higher than a tape boy and there's a quote from 1965 brother Branham talking about Leo and Jean he said they used to make tapes he said but now they're feeding and shepherding people he said how much greater is it to shepherd and feed and preach to God's people than it is to make a tape so the highest office is is having a gift of God and preaching the Word of God that brings the people to life how many want to be in the fullness how many want to begin a full inscription this is the way today and say God make me more like that I receive that to give thanks and to leave a refreshed Christian amen that's that's the real gospel aim head to be formed to the maturity of Jesus Christ through the preaching of the word that's exactly right Orry glory let me make sure I got everything covered I want to say here tonight and the other attacks Sarge's you know with the increase of internet people can hear so many voices they have preached on this when I preach the the Shepard series there are so many voices are so many preachers I can now listen to every preacher but when we do that is sometimes causes confusion well which one's right is my pastor right or is the other pastor right and if we feed on too many voices we and then we become those who are tossed out that they into the next and we don't even hear what God is trying to tell us through our local ministry a local fivefold ministry met to limit the number of voices that we hear remember that God wants us to feed on the Word of God coming through our local ministry praise God okay I think I'll finish with that there's a whole lot more we can preach on Lord willing next week we may look at this I just want to revisit this because we've had so many conversations and so many things said about the importance of a local church and what is the Bible ministry has it failed or not and I hope that was a blessing for you to see all those promises and all those quotes where brother Branham was constantly supporting the home church I'll just do a few more let me just do these last few I know a little longer my brother Branham always supported the local church brother Graham said do not give me your ties when he was going to a healing campaign he said give those to your home church don't give your tithing to visiting ministers that goes to the home Church to support the home church well the Brad said when people would write him letters and ask him questions that were personal he said I always tell them go ask your pastor but see people today they would need it they need an answer they'll ask any pastor thus any preacher and they don't have the amount of respect that brother branham's that we should have for the local pastor and that's the kind of respect that we need or the random said if you're gonna miss a church service he said get permission from your pastor to do it because you need to be at your post of duty not expect you to be at your post of duty need to be in there alright I hope that's a by the grace of God let's stay in here Malachi you can come right here I don't know where myself out don't know were you out but as I said all these conversations I've had and the revelation about the third day and the seventh day that being such a powerful revelation I thought it was important to revisit that and even though even at a time today where you know even in our church where we can see Satan's fart our Wednesday night and Sunday gatherings you know because of the the pipe the water pipe that burst now we're not gathering on Wednesday nights as a whole body like we used to you may feel further from each other that's just the work of Satan we've got to work to be together and now we can only have one service on Sunday so we're not having to services so it shows how to say it is battling the church but we've got to come against that we've got to mean believing God we've got to be fully trusting in God's word that he'll feed us through these weekly gatherings these these gatherings Wednesday he's gathering Sunday over than ever before we got to trust God to lead us gonna be faithful to the house and not we want to live in his presence how many would say thank you Lord for all the benefits from the preaching of the word tonight would you thank the Lord for that through preaching the word every Wednesday and Sunday in that size they all Bible and not just preaching it but living it if I preach it don't live it I'm the war I'm sorry M : but there's every time I preach it and try and pass time to forgive me my name strength the master spring I leave invited living when I'm preaching staying God's presence being edified being unified why immaturity all these blessings I just want to share something you know yesterday on base we got mostly the twentieth anniversary of my wife's my wife and I our first date when we were sinners and the movie went to a small snake eyes and I came to know the message but I thought about look at the transformation God has done in our lives 20 years ago we were going with with scales over eyes going to worldly movies you know not even aware that God sent a prophet I think of all the addictions I had in all the struggles I had and how high no faith that was even certain Jesus and now 20 years later I could look at my life and see the life that I live it's not I that lives its Christ that lives in me that was twenty years he could save a wretch like me a minute he could wash me this blood cleanse me forgive me refresh me many times we do dis more than more than Wednesday and Sunday every day every day we can be refreshing presence it was such a beautiful reminder about with the love of Jesus Christ in do is transforming power it will receive the fresh refilling the fresh anointing if we receive the Holy Spirit I'll make us longer for more of God all the time they won't wire you from church they won't change you from church you'll be
