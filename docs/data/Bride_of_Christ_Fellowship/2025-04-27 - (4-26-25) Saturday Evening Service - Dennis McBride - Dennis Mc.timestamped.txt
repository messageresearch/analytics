[0:00] And if he allowed us to be here, we know
[0:03] it's for a purpose because there's
[0:06] purpose behind everything that he does.
[0:08] Yes, sir. So, we should always be
[0:10] looking for the purpose of God within
[0:14] each day that we live.
[0:16] Isn't that right? He don't just let us
[0:19] live just to live.
[0:21] Just to breathe the air and eat pizza
[0:25] and Chipotle.
[0:29] It's a reason why we're living. Yes,
[0:31] sir. Hallelujah. You know, and
[0:34] uh it was a brother that ministered
[0:36] recently and and it just kind of really
[0:38] sat well with my heart, of course,
[0:40] because he he expressed that, you know,
[0:43] the reason why we're here is to prepare
[0:47] for where we're going.
[0:51] So, our life here is not meant for us to
[0:54] satisfy ourselves.
[0:57] Hallelujah. Amen. But it's to come to
[0:59] know the one that made us so that we can
[1:01] be prepared to go to where we're going
[1:04] to
[1:05] go. Whether you want to or not,
[1:08] everybody got to die. Amen. I heard one
[1:12] brother say years ago, that's a point
[1:14] that that's an appointment that
[1:15] everybody has and you're going to meet
[1:17] it. Amen. That's right. Now, there's an
[1:21] exception to
[1:22] that. At the coming of the Lord, as far
[1:24] as the rapture is concerned, sir, we
[1:27] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:30] caught up, right? So, there are a few
[1:32] people that's not going to actually see
[1:34] death, right? Uh physically speaking,
[1:37] but nonetheless though, until that time
[1:40] comes, that's something that we all have
[1:41] to face. Amen. So, that's why we're
[1:43] here. Amen. You guys sound
[1:47] wonderful. Amen. The little children or
[1:50] whatever, man. Y'all sound spectacular.
[1:53] I ain't just saying that either. I
[1:55] really enjoyed it. Anyway, God bless you
[1:58] all. Good to see everybody. Amen. My
[2:01] precious brother here. Amen. Brother
[2:04] Benjamin. It's been a long time. About
[2:08] 50 years,
[2:11] huh? Amen. Your brother, what's your
[2:14] brother's name,
[2:16] man? Those guys was
[2:18] about this
[2:19] tall last time I saw them, man. So, it's
[2:23] good to see you, my brother. God bless
[2:25] you richly. Amen. It was good to meet
[2:27] our brother Chris.
[2:30] Thank God for him and the fellowship
[2:31] that we had. And it's good to see
[2:33] everybody. So, I don't want to keep you
[2:35] standing long. Uh so, let's just kind of
[2:39] get right into the word.
[2:44] Let's start with Psalms 145.
[2:58] Psalms 145. I'm going start at verse 15,
[3:02] Lord willing.
[3:09] It says, "The eyes of all wait upon
[3:12] thee, and thou givest them their meat in
[3:15] due
[3:17] season. Thou openest thine hand, and
[3:21] satisfest the desire of every living
[3:24] thing." Amen. Let us pray. Heavenly
[3:26] Father, Lord, have your way. We're here
[3:30] to serve you, Lord. Not our own agendas.
[3:35] We have no, we have nothing to glory in
[3:38] within ourselves, Lord. We can do
[3:40] nothing without you. You said it in your
[3:43] word, Lord, but we've experienced it,
[3:45] Father. Yes, Lord. We need you for
[3:47] everything, Lord. And we need you
[3:50] tonight both to minister and to hear
[3:54] because only you can open up our ears to
[3:56] give us understanding.
[3:58] So, Father, may you help us to
[4:00] understand, Lord. May you help us to
[4:02] minister just to yield to your spirit,
[4:04] Father. And may you just be able to have
[4:07] your way according to your will, Lord,
[4:10] what you purposed before the foundation
[4:12] of the world. Hallelujah. We thank you,
[4:15] Lord. We thank you for allowing us to be
[4:17] here, Father. For keeping us, Lord, for
[4:19] preserving us. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[4:21] Have your way. We ask these things in
[4:23] your name, the name of our Lord. Lord,
[4:25] forgive us of our sins. Yes, Jesus. And
[4:28] our iniquities, Lord. Yes, Lord. We all
[4:31] acknowledge that we are work in
[4:33] progress. Yes, Lord. We don't get
[4:35] everything right, Father. There's still
[4:37] some rough places, Lord. Lord, but we're
[4:40] glad, Father, that you helped us to come
[4:42] as far as we have. Hallelujah. And you
[4:44] are here to finish that work, Lord. So,
[4:47] may we submit ourselves to you.
[4:49] Hallelujah. Lord, you are the potter and
[4:51] we are the clay. Have your way, Lord. In
[4:54] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[4:57] Amen. You may be seated, saints. God
[4:59] bless you.
[5:15] man, what I've been studying
[5:18] lately, my heart is still full of
[5:22] that.
[5:24] Uh, and I don't know if I'll make it to
[5:27] that now or not.
[5:30] We'll see. I know I won't make it to it
[5:32] tonight because this is a whole another
[5:34] topic. Yes, sir.
[5:37] Uh but we just want God to have his way.
[5:40] Amen, brother. Amen. Amen.
[5:46] Your mother, Brother
[5:49] Benjamin, she she was in our service
[5:51] last
[5:52] night. I hadn't seen her in years.
[5:57] She came and shook my hand and greeted
[5:59] me. I was like, "Praise the Lord." Amen.
[6:02] So, praise God. Hallelujah.
[6:05] Now, I just share this also.
[6:09] Um, you know, it's a lot of people
[6:11] that's afraid to fly.
[6:15] Now, too many mechanical issues or
[6:18] whatever. You know, it's okay to have a
[6:21] mechanical issue in a in a in a car on
[6:23] ground.
[6:25] you know, you can just pull
[6:29] over when it comes to the air. Lord have
[6:33] mercy. So, today was my first time
[6:36] experiencing something and I I felt the
[6:38] enemy wanted to do something
[6:40] more. Um, was coming down for a
[6:45] landing and the guy behind me, I heard
[6:48] him say, "I've I've flown thousands of
[6:50] times." He said, "And I've never I've
[6:53] never seen this happen before. We're
[6:55] coming down for a landing. The wheels
[6:57] set and
[6:59] everything. And then right before we
[7:01] land, all of a sudden, it's like inside
[7:05] of the plane, it felt like a roller
[7:06] coaster ride. You know how when you're
[7:08] on a roller coaster, it goes down and
[7:10] all of a sudden it shoots up. Man, that
[7:13] that plane came down, all of a sudden it
[7:15] shot up. And like when it shot up, it
[7:19] had to increase
[7:21] speed. So that left everybody kind of
[7:24] like what what's going on here? What
[7:26] just happened? And they didn't say
[7:28] anything. So I knew something serious
[7:31] had happened that they were not making
[7:33] aware, making us aware of so that it
[7:36] wouldn't startle everyone. But we took
[7:39] back off, man. And we had to circle
[7:41] around and I don't know what I just
[7:43] started praying. I know that. And I
[7:46] said, "Lord, just help this plane to
[7:47] come down
[7:50] safe. Let it come down safe, Lord, and
[7:53] land
[7:54] correctly. Let me get
[7:59] off. Here I am." So the Lord
[8:04] [Applause]
[8:08] bless. So tonight saints
[8:13] um I actually dealt with this
[8:17] subject
[8:22] man ago or
[8:26] so and it just earlier
[8:31] today it came the word this word came on
[8:34] my heart just kind of it's a
[8:39] talk. So I paused for a moment. I was
[8:41] like, "Okay, but I was studying
[8:43] something totally
[8:45] different." So then once I got here
[8:48] tonight, here at the church
[8:53] tonight, just came back a second
[8:57] time. I was
[9:01] like, and all of a sudden I didn't feel
[9:04] to deal with what I was studying on.
[9:07] So that's why I'm approaching this right
[9:09] now. Amen. Just for that sole reason
[9:13] alone. Praise the Lord. Yes, sir.
[9:16] Hallelujah. So, as
[9:18] a as a
[9:20] title, and I I'll just read our opening
[9:22] scripture once more. It was Psalms 145
[9:26] starting at verse 15. The eyes of all
[9:31] wait upon thee. Yes. Isn't that true,
[9:35] saints? Amen. Amen. Yes.
[9:39] Whether they believe in God, human
[9:41] speaking, humanly speaking, whether they
[9:43] believe in God or
[9:46] not, they need God.
[9:49] Yes, sir. You understand?
[9:54] They're just deceived to the place to
[9:57] where they won't acknowledge him. Amen.
[10:01] And many people are deceived by evil
[10:03] spirits to call him other names. That's
[10:07] right. Right. But they're looking to a
[10:09] higher power
[10:11] to supply
[10:14] for needs.
[10:18] But we by the grace of God, we know who
[10:21] that higher power is. Amen. We know his
[10:24] name.
[10:26] What's his name, saints?
[10:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. And we're blessed
[10:31] by that, right? Cuz we know what we're
[10:33] approaching. We know who we're dealing
[10:35] with. Amen.
[10:37] So, it says, "The eyes of all wait upon
[10:41] me. That's that's that's every that's
[10:44] botney life. That's animal life."
[10:50] Right? It says, "And thou givest them
[10:53] their meat in due
[10:55] season.
[10:56] Again, I'm going to go back to this
[10:58] point. Even people that don't believe in
[11:00] God, they only have what they have
[11:02] because God allowed them to have it.
[11:04] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[11:07] They're just too ignorant, blind. That's
[11:09] what it is. They're too blind to the
[11:11] fact. Yes. And most people think they
[11:14] obtain a lot of things on their own,
[11:17] you know, and God don't like that.
[11:20] That's why he did Nebuchadnezzar like he
[11:22] did. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You know, he
[11:24] just he he he got a little amnesia.
[11:28] How many know that God will cure you
[11:29] from amnesia?
[11:32] When you think when you begin to think
[11:33] too much of yourself and too little of
[11:35] him, right? Right. Look at what I did.
[11:39] Oh, what the Bible why he yet spake.
[11:43] God, God, let me come down and help you
[11:45] to understand. Let me take you back to
[11:47] school. My creation, you little itty
[11:51] bitty man.
[11:54] You haven't done nothing on your own.
[11:57] Everything you beholding right now and
[11:59] you somehow getting puffed up about, I
[12:02] did that. G. And it was only for a
[12:05] purpose. Cuz he wasn't necessarily a
[12:08] godly man. That's right. Can we say
[12:11] praise the Lord? Praise the Lord. That's
[12:12] right. So even amongst the men of the
[12:14] earth that are not godly men, God
[12:17] allowed them to be to partake of their
[12:20] labors. That's right. Yes. Right. So,
[12:24] they got the trucks and the trailers and
[12:26] the houses and this and that and the
[12:28] other and won't even darken the doorstep
[12:31] of a church.
[12:33] That's right. Cuz they're deceived.
[12:34] They're blind. Yes, sir. You understand
[12:37] what I'm saying? But God can pull those
[12:39] blessings. God can pull the rug at any
[12:41] time. Just like that rich man that was
[12:44] dying. Or rather, he didn't know. And
[12:46] that's the key. He didn't know that he
[12:49] was going to die on that day. Yeah,
[12:51] that's right. He had worked hard and
[12:53] tried to establish things for himself or
[12:55] what have you. Right. And then here it
[12:57] is, you know, when when he's at the
[12:59] climax of his career. Amen. When when
[13:01] when when he's been you working within
[13:04] has has yielded the the the the biggest
[13:06] the biggest crop it seeming.
[13:09] He had to build new barns.
[13:14] And then he made the mistake that
[13:16] Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar made. God
[13:18] had grace upon Nebuchadnezzar because he
[13:21] just reduced him down to an animallike
[13:23] lifestyle for a season and that was
[13:26] enough to straighten him out. But this
[13:29] man, he didn't have that opportunity.
[13:31] That same grace wasn't extended to him.
[13:34] Now he was coming to his end of life
[13:37] and he failed to prepare
[13:40] properly for the afterlife. That's
[13:43] right. He thought he did. He was
[13:45] religious and everything. Right. But
[13:48] then he said out of his own mouth,
[13:50] "So, rest
[13:54] thyself, the audacity."
[13:58] Right? The audacity for him to actually
[14:01] tell his own soul to get rest. Who do
[14:05] you think you
[14:06] are? Huh? And when God looking at him,
[14:11] him thinking that he had favor with God,
[14:13] he was deceived in that.
[14:16] God said, "Thou fool,
[14:19] this night your soul is required of
[14:23] you." He didn't know when he woke up
[14:25] that morning, saints, that was his last
[14:27] day. He didn't know when he ate that
[14:30] delicious meal the night before that the
[14:32] next day that that was going to be his
[14:34] Well, he probably ate breakfast, too.
[14:36] You understand what I'm saying? But he
[14:38] didn't know that he was approaching his
[14:39] last moments in this life. He didn't He
[14:42] didn't see that. And that wasn't in his
[14:44] plans. He had other plans.
[14:50] People plan all the time.
[14:55] That's why the Bible says for people
[14:56] that are business owners and what have
[14:58] you, it says that you can make a plan.
[15:01] I'mma go into a certain area. I'mma buy
[15:03] and sell and get gain or what have you.
[15:05] You know,
[15:07] he said, "Well, hold on now. You you
[15:09] lacking something." Yes. you lacking
[15:12] something that's very
[15:13] needful. He says what you need to add to
[15:16] that to that plan. He didn't say it was
[15:18] wrong to
[15:19] plan good plan. Plan your career, plan
[15:23] your path of life or what have you. But
[15:25] the Bible lets us know we want to add
[15:27] this vital ingredient to that. If the
[15:30] Lord wills,
[15:32] then we'll do this or that.
[15:35] You understand what I'm saying? But
[15:37] that's how the devil has designed this
[15:39] world or what have you. you just get
[15:41] into a place or a mode or a groove
[15:43] sometimes where you just kind of get to
[15:45] going or whatever and you just think
[15:47] that it's all you and you got these
[15:49] plans and you got these outcomes that
[15:51] you've imagined.
[15:54] Amen. But God has control over all and
[15:56] then fail to acknowledge the one that
[15:58] brings things to pass.
[16:02] It might not even be his will for your
[16:04] life. That's right. That's right. Amen.
[16:06] That's why the Bible says they that
[16:08] would be rich, they pierced themselves
[16:11] through with many, how does it say it,
[16:14] brother? Sinful and hurtful
[16:17] lust, you know, cuz you trying to obtain
[16:21] something that's not for you. And when
[16:23] things fail, you all disappointed. You
[16:26] fail to go to God and ask God, Lord,
[16:28] what is your will? Where do you want me
[16:30] to go? Maybe he's stopping you from
[16:32] something that'll be harmful for your
[16:35] life.
[16:37] Something you think you want, but God
[16:39] know you don't need that. You don't need
[16:41] that person. You don't need that job.
[16:43] You don't need to stay in this location.
[16:45] Live over here. So, he'll cut off every
[16:48] corner to drive you into the place
[16:50] that'll actually be best for you. Listen
[16:52] now. It might not suit your carnal
[16:55] taste.
[16:58] Hallelujah. But it'll suit the taste of
[17:00] your soul.
[17:03] Hallelujah. Cuz that soul is wanting
[17:06] God's will. It was made to to thirst
[17:09] after God.
[17:13] Did I give you my title? Yeah.
[17:17] Satisfaction.
[17:21] Satisfaction.
[17:27] I ain't make it to verse 16.
[17:32] Thou openest thy hand. Speaking of God,
[17:35] it says, "And does what?" Satisfiest the
[17:39] desire of what?
[17:43] So where does satisfaction lie?
[17:48] Completely.
[17:49] Amen. Hallelujah. You understand what
[17:52] I'm saying? When people try to go about
[17:55] life and leave God out,
[17:58] you know what they become? They become
[18:00] dissatisfied.
[18:02] Ain't satisfied with that. There is
[18:04] nothing that's truly fulfilling.
[18:09] It can't be.
[18:11] Amen. Because the fulfiller is left out
[18:13] of the equation. Yes, sir.
[18:19] The Bible says the way of a transgressor
[18:21] is hard.
[18:28] Those that try to live outside of God's
[18:31] bounds, outside of his
[18:33] word, it's a hard life.
[18:39] Let me read something to you
[18:41] here. I'm not going to make it through
[18:43] all of this. I can tell it
[18:45] now. I'm just kind of according to how I
[18:48] feel led. Amen.
[18:51] This message here is called Identified
[18:53] with Christ 1959 December the 20th. It's
[18:56] a evening
[18:58] service. Brother Brandon says this,
[19:00] saints, and I'm I'mma rephrase that.
[19:03] It's the Holy Spirit expressing this.
[19:06] Yes. Yes. He says, you know, there is in
[19:11] the country today so many dissatisfied
[19:16] people and it's amazing when you get
[19:19] around and find out so much
[19:22] dissatisfaction. People hardly know what
[19:25] they want to do. He says some of them
[19:27] get so disturbed until they go down to
[19:30] the drugstore and purchase for
[19:32] themselves a bottle of
[19:33] arsenic or sulfuric acid or something
[19:36] and commit
[19:37] suicide. We were speaking about this a
[19:40] little earlier in our
[19:41] fellowship. People that are not
[19:44] spiritually in tune, people that don't
[19:45] have God in their life, they fail, this
[19:49] this is one very key
[19:51] thing. They fail to be able to recognize
[19:54] because only God can help you to do it
[19:56] the voice of evil spirits. That's right.
[20:00] Yes. Anybody listen to me, anybody that
[20:03] has ever committed
[20:05] suicide, as soon as they died, like as
[20:10] soon as they took their last breath
[20:13] here, they were able to see the spirit
[20:16] that led them to do it.
[20:20] Huh. and they see that wasn't even me.
[20:25] And that devil is tormenting them. Amen.
[20:29] And they're sitting there dwelling upon
[20:31] all the decisions that they made based
[20:34] upon this evil spirit.
[20:36] Yes, sir. And they can't come back and
[20:38] change nothing.
[20:46] He says, "And they find them laying
[20:48] dead. Some would turn their gas jets on
[20:52] in the room or setting their automobiles
[20:55] with a pipe for the carbon monoxide gas
[20:58] trying to
[21:00] listen trying to get away from
[21:06] life. You want to know what you you want
[21:09] to know what brings a person to try to
[21:10] get away from life through alcohol,
[21:14] through drugs, through these means that
[21:16] we're talking about now is because of
[21:19] failing to come in
[21:22] contact with the satisfier.
[21:25] Accepting
[21:28] substitutes that seem
[21:30] satisfying, but the results of the
[21:33] substitutes is corruption.
[21:38] I had an
[21:39] auntie. Her name was Nail
[21:44] Carter. I'mma tell you
[21:46] this. I don't say this to too many
[21:49] people. I just share for the sake of
[21:51] what I'm talking about. And just because
[21:53] I said her name and it brought back
[21:56] memories. She gave me a
[21:59] nickname. She used to call me
[22:03] Tweety, you know. But one thing about my
[22:07] aunt, and I can remember, ever since I
[22:09] was a little child, I remember her when
[22:12] she was in good health. I'm talking
[22:14] about substitutes and what they do to
[22:16] you. I remember when she was in good
[22:19] health. Listen, she wasn't a drug
[22:21] addict. She didn't smoke cigarettes. She
[22:24] wasn't alcoholic. She didn't even drink
[22:26] alcohol. At least I wasn't aware of it.
[22:30] But it's one thing that seems so
[22:32] innocent and so harmless. There's one
[22:35] thing that she just
[22:38] loved. And I believe she had it every
[22:41] day and probably multiple times a day.
[22:44] You know what that
[22:46] was?
[22:50] Pepsi. She loved Pepsi.
[22:56] uh that as a child I could always
[22:58] remember her talking about getting her a
[22:59] nice cold
[23:04] Pepsi. Pepsi led to her
[23:07] death. She became a
[23:11] diabetic. And once that diabetic process
[23:14] laid in because she
[23:16] wasn't she wasn't against God but she
[23:19] didn't give her life fully to God. Yes.
[23:23] And I say that because a person that's
[23:26] not even mindful of God like that, their
[23:28] minds don't automatically gravitate
[23:30] toward divine healing.
[23:34] Cuz God can come and stop you. You know
[23:36] how many times God had how many
[23:39] experienced healing in here before?
[23:43] You know, God is able to come and
[23:44] intervene.
[23:46] I've experienced it, right? He's able to
[23:48] intervene and bring corruption like
[23:50] bring correction to corruption.
[23:52] Hallelujah. Amen. But my aunt, she hit
[23:56] the diabetic point and initially it was
[24:00] just the initial diagnosis, you know,
[24:02] everything still functioning or
[24:03] whatever, you know, but then it got to a
[24:06] point to where she had to get on
[24:07] dialysis,
[24:10] right? And then once she got on
[24:13] dialysis, it was just all downhill from
[24:16] there.
[24:18] She start she lost her legs.
[24:27] Then her her sight began to leave her
[24:31] and then she passed
[24:34] on. What caused
[24:37] that? A
[24:39] substitute over time.
[24:44] You're filling your body with something
[24:47] that is not made to be filled with.
[24:52] And how many realize that mankind as a
[24:54] whole has done that with their souls and
[24:56] their spirits.
[24:58] That's right. Feed upon things that you
[25:02] shouldn't feed upon. Yes, sir. If you
[25:04] eat too much candy, too much junk food,
[25:06] what will it do for you? It'll actually
[25:09] in many cases bring you to that same
[25:11] state. You know how many people have
[25:12] died because of diabetes?
[25:15] Overindulging in substitutes.
[25:20] Amen. Very good. Yes, sir. People that
[25:22] try to live healthy and what have you
[25:23] and try to consume the right things. You
[25:25] don't see diabetes popping up all over
[25:27] the place amongst that percentage.
[25:31] Why? Because they're eating the right
[25:32] things.
[25:34] Yes. Amen. So whenever we eat the things
[25:37] of the world, I'm talking spiritually
[25:39] speaking, what kind of an outcome do you
[25:42] expect?
[25:44] Amen. Like I said, she was fine and
[25:46] still functioning, whatever for quite
[25:48] some time. Got a nice cold Pepsi, eating
[25:51] it with a steak and corn on the cob and
[25:53] some macaroni and rice and gravy and
[25:56] some
[25:57] chicken. Huh. sitting down seemingly
[26:00] having a feast and that Pepsi seemed
[26:02] like it added the f that that topping
[26:05] ingredient that just made everything so
[26:07] fine.
[26:09] Amen. But how great is that taste now?
[26:22] is actually
[26:23] pleasurable to the flesh. Yes. Yes, sir.
[26:27] Right.
[26:29] We've all had our conversations in times
[26:32] past. Glory. And God is still purging us
[26:37] from the effects of those substitutes.
[26:40] Amen. They have lingering effects many
[26:42] times. The Bible calls it the
[26:44] superfluity of
[26:48] naughtiness. Amen.
[26:50] Glory. Why saints? Because that's how
[26:53] the devil want he he got things that he
[26:55] try to control us by.
[26:58] Good.
[27:00] It's just like it's like drugs. You
[27:02] know, many people feel like, you know,
[27:04] that they hear about drugs and this and
[27:06] that and the other and and and and it's
[27:08] it's crazy to me. It's crazy to me how
[27:11] you got people that hear about drugs and
[27:13] even see the the the the raw effects of
[27:16] the downside of it.
[27:18] You understand what I'm saying? But
[27:20] still will have a
[27:22] curiosity suggested by an evil spirit
[27:26] that they don't realize is suggesting
[27:28] that they're still experienced that. But
[27:31] once they get that first
[27:33] pull, many times they can't come off
[27:36] unless God help them saints. I I pulled
[27:39] up to a beauty supply store in my in my
[27:42] in my neighborhood and I was getting out
[27:45] to go in and get some. I don't even know
[27:46] what I was going to
[27:48] get, but this I I pulled up and as soon
[27:51] as I pulled up, there was a guy standing
[27:53] in front of the store and he came and
[27:56] walked up to my car. He says, "Hey man,
[27:58] you got some you got some change I can
[28:00] get?"
[28:01] I and I don't know about a lot of you
[28:04] guys, but I almost never have money on
[28:07] me. It's just it's just the nature of
[28:09] society now. Everything is swipe tap.
[28:13] And you know, I pay I I I used to stay
[28:16] out for a long for many years. I
[28:17] wouldn't pay no bills online. But when
[28:20] co hit, it changed all of that. It
[28:21] converted
[28:23] me. Now I don't do nothing else but took
[28:27] all my fears
[28:29] away, you know. But this guy, he said,
[28:32] "Man, hey, can I get a little money from
[28:34] you?" And since when I looked up at him,
[28:37] he was a man that went to school with
[28:40] me. And when he looked and saw my eyes
[28:43] and he realized it was me, I could see
[28:46] it in his
[28:47] eyes, he didn't want me to see him like
[28:50] that. How How did he get to that
[28:54] place? There was something that he was
[28:56] thirsting for,
[28:59] right? And the enemy brought a
[29:01] substitute that out of
[29:04] curiosity he pulled from and that demon
[29:08] got a hold of
[29:09] him. He thought he was just pulling from
[29:12] a
[29:13] substance and this little bit of powder,
[29:16] this little bit of grass looking stuff.
[29:18] I can control that. But you didn't know
[29:21] that it was a demon that was attached to
[29:23] it. So when you took it in, you took
[29:26] that demon in. And now that you've
[29:27] allowed that demon to have take up
[29:30] residence.
[29:32] Amen. Now against your own will. Amen.
[29:36] You can't even stop.
[29:40] Unless the Lord help you. Amen. Unless
[29:43] you come to that one that opens up his
[29:45] hand and satisfies every living thing.
[29:49] Hallelujah.
[29:51] Amen.
[29:53] That woman, I don't know how she got
[29:55] into that situation as being a ill-famed
[29:58] woman, but she had an appointment at a
[30:01] well one day
[30:03] and she came and walked up to that well
[30:05] like she normally did. But Jesus had a
[30:08] need to go by that same place because he
[30:11] saw her and he knew he had to come and
[30:13] meet with her. Amen. Because listen, she
[30:17] wasn't ordained to stay that way.
[30:20] Hallelujah. G. Even though she was as
[30:23] black and dark and whatever in her
[30:25] spirit and in her soul as she was, she
[30:27] was still God's daughter.
[30:31] Hallelujah. And he said, listen, his
[30:33] whole purpose for going by there was for
[30:37] her.
[30:40] And he made sure his disciples wasn't
[30:42] around. Amen. Cuz they would have
[30:44] brought in an element, saints, that
[30:46] would have disturbed the atmosphere.
[30:49] Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Because when
[30:52] they came up, the Bible says, you know,
[30:55] he they saw him talking to her and no
[30:57] man would know what seekest
[30:59] thou cuz they had that
[31:02] mentality. They didn't have his mind.
[31:04] They had that unconverted mind still.
[31:06] They would have messed God's program up.
[31:09] So, he made sure they was away long
[31:11] enough for him to inject her. Listen,
[31:14] saints. He says,
[31:17] "Now give me a
[31:22] drink."
[31:25] Huh? She said, "You being a Jew, you
[31:28] know you ain't supposed to be talking to
[31:30] me." He said, "If you knew the gift of
[31:33] God." Amen. And who was talking to
[31:37] you? You would ask me for a drink.
[31:41] Amen.
[31:43] And you've been living this
[31:44] lifestyle that in your heart I know you
[31:46] don't want to live cuz you my daughter
[31:49] and there's a seed in there.
[31:52] Can we say praise the Lord? Amen. He
[31:54] sees her in her. Listen now. Even though
[31:57] she was in the lifestyle, she was
[31:59] dissatisfied.
[32:02] She was not satisfied living like that.
[32:04] Even though it looked like she was
[32:06] getting much pleasure, but her soul was
[32:08] crying out. Hallelujah.
[32:14] She says, "Sir, the well is
[32:17] deep." Cuz in her mind, she just not
[32:19] right. She's in the car. She said, "How
[32:21] you going to give me
[32:26] water?" He said, "It's not a water that
[32:29] I'll give
[32:30] you when you drink of this
[32:32] water, it'll so satisfy you until you
[32:36] are never." How many know what the word
[32:39] never mean?
[32:42] Huh? You will never thirst again. Glory.
[32:49] She said, "Hold on now. This a different
[32:51] kind of water you talking." She ain't
[32:53] really she ain't she ain't she ain't
[32:54] spiritually in tune like that, but she
[32:57] know a good product now. You telling me
[32:59] I can drink water and I ain't going to
[33:01] never thirst again. She said, "Sir, get
[33:03] give me this water you talking about."
[33:05] She ain't want to pass up the
[33:06] opportunity. the opportunity. This
[33:09] sounds good to me. Give me this water
[33:11] that I ain't gonna never thirst again.
[33:13] And what did he do,
[33:14] saints? He said, "Go and get your
[33:16] husband."
[33:19] Yes. You know what that was? That was
[33:22] the manifestation of the fountain of
[33:24] living waters. Hallelujah. Amen. Any
[33:27] true seed of God, they're satisfied when
[33:30] they come in contact with the word made
[33:33] flesh. Amen. Hallelujah. Uhhuh. Can we
[33:36] say praise the Lord? Look, he says, "Go
[33:38] and get your husband." She says, "Sir, I
[33:41] have none." He said, "You told the
[33:42] truth, but you have had five, and the
[33:45] one you with now is not yours."
[33:48] Sir, I perceive you a
[33:50] prophet. Now, we know when Messiah come,
[33:52] he said, "I'm he that speech."
[34:00] She became so full of that water.
[34:05] She dropped the water pot.
[34:08] She didn't care about the natural water
[34:10] no more cuz she became full of that
[34:12] spiritual water. Amen. Listen. And she
[34:15] began immediately to feel the satisfying
[34:19] quench. Glory to God. Amen. Moving
[34:22] through her being changed. Amen. And to
[34:25] the point she had to go run into the
[34:26] city and say, "Come see a man that's
[34:28] told me all the things I've ever done.
[34:31] Is not this the Christ?" Hallelujah.
[34:34] Amen. She never thirsted again, saints.
[34:36] How? Why? Because she allowed the
[34:39] satisfier
[34:41] to give her that drink. Praise God. By
[34:45] manifesting her his being in a way that
[34:48] he knew she would recognize
[34:51] cuz she was designed to recognize him in
[34:53] that way.
[34:58] Can you recognize him in your day?
[35:01] Hallelujah. Glory.
[35:05] That goes deep. That goes into the
[35:07] abyss.
[35:10] I'mma come back
[35:13] here. But right now, I'm coming back
[35:15] here. Praise the Lord. Praise God. Let
[35:17] me finish. He says they're trying to get
[35:19] away from life.
[35:22] People go about trying. Listen, you got
[35:24] Listen, people think that money solves
[35:25] so
[35:26] much. Oh, if I just had enough money,
[35:29] man, I'll do this and that and the
[35:31] other. What was the guy's name? His name
[35:33] was
[35:34] Robin
[35:37] Williams. Seemingly successful
[35:41] career, world
[35:44] notoriety. And what happened to his
[35:47] life? That demon
[35:50] whispered. How was that demon even able
[35:52] to get in? Because there was
[35:55] dissatisfaction there in the midst of
[35:58] the riches.
[36:01] There is no way for a person to be
[36:04] satisfied outside of God.
[36:07] No matter no matter what what kind of
[36:09] image, show, pretending or whatever they
[36:12] put on. No, you miserable.
[36:18] You need another fix of the substitute
[36:20] of life that you filling yourself with
[36:23] in order for you to feel something a
[36:26] little
[36:27] different. That's why people like to get
[36:29] high.
[36:31] It has put their mind in a different
[36:33] place because they're trying to get away
[36:35] from
[36:36] life when they start thinking about
[36:38] things. Amen. Cuz when you in this
[36:41] world, this is a dog eat dog world. It
[36:44] ain't fun out there. You got to watch
[36:46] your back. You got to you dealing with
[36:48] all kind of shady and and and just all
[36:50] kind of mess out there. You can't trust
[36:52] no ain't no tr no real trust out there.
[36:55] Amen. Brother, how many people done went
[36:57] into business deals with people and
[36:59] whatever and and even business partners
[37:01] or whatever done tried to, you know,
[37:03] swindle them out of they half and all
[37:04] kind of stuff. I just seen people, you
[37:06] know, win lotteryies and then all of a
[37:08] sudden because the Bible says a man got
[37:10] money, he got friends, huh? The the the
[37:14] prodical son show you that. Huh? When he
[37:17] had that first part of his inheritance,
[37:18] he out there, man. Everybody want to
[37:20] know a prodal. I don't know what his
[37:21] real name was. A prodical. Hey, where
[37:25] you going to be at tonight? Hey, come
[37:27] and have breakfast with us, man. Why? He
[37:31] got the money, right? But when that
[37:33] money ran out, the only friend he had
[37:36] was pigs,
[37:38] and they wasn't even his friend.
[37:41] Huh? Can we say praise the Lord, saints?
[37:45] There. And that's just how that's how
[37:47] the world is. It's it's it's it's a cold
[37:50] heartless. Why? Because the devil is the
[37:52] god of it. Amen.
[37:55] Huh? And everything that operates under
[37:57] that society is under his hand, his
[38:00] leadership, his influence.
[38:04] My good. Some of them will climb up to
[38:08] the bridge and write a little note and
[38:10] stick it on their coat and lay it down
[38:13] and plunge themselves to death in the
[38:15] river, jumping off of mountains, high
[38:17] towers. And some will take a pistol and
[38:20] put it up to their head and actually
[38:22] blow their brains
[38:24] out. And we understand that our prophet
[38:27] went through that
[38:29] once he lost the dearest things to his
[38:31] life. He didn't see no reason to live no
[38:35] more. Even being fully knowledgeable of
[38:38] God.
[38:42] And that strikes a chord right there.
[38:45] Because many
[38:46] people, they long too much for
[38:49] acceptance. Amen.
[38:52] That's right. You want to know why they
[38:54] want acceptance? Because they're
[38:57] dissatisfied. It's a demon whispering in
[38:59] their ear, highlighting things in a
[39:02] certain fashion to paint a certain
[39:04] picture in their minds. Amen. To make
[39:07] them feel like they odd and nobody like
[39:09] you and whatever. And they begin, he
[39:11] begin that demon to pour out people that
[39:14] seem to be popular and whatever. Oh, if
[39:16] you can be a part of this crowd or
[39:17] associated with this group or whatever,
[39:19] that's why people go to these big mega
[39:20] churches and whatever. They want to be
[39:22] associated with what the world looks
[39:24] upon as success.
[39:27] Amen. And for the and for the sake of
[39:29] being accepted, look at what people go
[39:31] through.
[39:36] Young boys and young girls when it comes
[39:38] to the opposite sex and things of that
[39:40] nature, they want to be not noticed by
[39:42] somebody and they go through all kind of
[39:44] changes for what? That's right. That per
[39:49] and then when you get what you think you
[39:52] want, you begin to
[39:55] realize, man, this ain't what I thought
[39:57] it was. That's right. Cuz now you begin
[39:59] to see the character and all the baggage
[40:02] that come along with what you thought
[40:04] you wanted. That's right, brother. Men
[40:07] and women alike. Amen. Many of them many
[40:10] of them listen. Many of them walk their
[40:13] way into death by going in by going with
[40:16] the wrong person. Yes, sir. That's
[40:17] right. They didn't wait on they they
[40:19] didn't look to the one that can give
[40:20] them somebody that'll really satisfy.
[40:23] Amen. And when you get a God-given
[40:25] partner, you talking about satisfaction,
[40:28] huh? Yes. Glory to God. Yeah. And then
[40:31] you you got to be in tune with God to be
[40:33] led by God to be able to come in contact
[40:36] with that. Hallelujah. You understand
[40:38] what I'm saying? Cuz it might not it
[40:40] might not it might not check off all of
[40:42] your prerequisites.
[40:44] Amen. But it checks off what God knows
[40:46] you need. And when you get it and you
[40:50] allow it to operate, you will see
[40:55] Yes. Oh my god, you feel like float.
[41:03] All loveydovey.
[41:08] It's the truth. Yes, sir. What comes
[41:11] from
[41:12] God is the only thing that satisfies.
[41:17] Let me try to finish this.
[41:19] things. It says, "And some will take a
[41:22] pistol and put it up to their head and
[41:23] actually blow their brains out. They're
[41:25] just
[41:26] dissatisfied." He says, "The hospitals
[41:28] are full of dissatisfied people. The
[41:30] insane institutions are overrun,
[41:33] dissatisfied." He says they they don't
[41:35] know what to do or what they want to do.
[41:38] It says or they don't know what they do
[41:40] want. He says there seem to be something
[41:43] that they're reaching after, but they
[41:46] just never come to
[41:49] it. That woman, she came to it. The
[41:52] woman at the well
[41:54] and it satisfied.
[41:57] Yes.
[42:03] My have to draw this down to a
[42:07] close. I'm enjoying myself now. Amen.
[42:10] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:13] So, I'm just going to I'm going kind of
[42:14] help you to to follow me a little close
[42:16] a little more closely. The word
[42:18] satisfaction itself, just by definition,
[42:20] it means fulfillment of one's
[42:24] wishes,
[42:25] expectations, needs, or the pleasure
[42:28] that comes from the fulfillment of
[42:32] it. Amen.
[42:34] The Bible talks about the effects of
[42:36] when a person desires
[42:38] come and when a person's desire is
[42:41] bypassed, it affects the heart.
[42:47] And we say, "Praise the Lord." And what
[42:49] you've been desiring don't come, it make
[42:53] your heart stoop.
[42:55] You don't see it, but
[42:58] it right. But when you see your desire
[43:01] come,
[43:03] now I'mma say it in this way. When your
[43:05] desire is in line with God's will,
[43:08] because that's the only thing that
[43:10] brings satisfaction. Now, seemingly your
[43:12] own desire might bring satisfaction if
[43:14] you get what you think you want, but
[43:16] then you will come out you you you'll
[43:18] come to realize real quick, not long
[43:21] after, you'll still be dissatisfied.
[43:24] That's right. Huh?
[43:28] Praise God.
[43:32] All right. So, dissatisfied means not
[43:34] satisfied or
[43:36] pleased. It says
[43:41] discontented. So, I want to say this by
[43:43] the grace of God. We read it in Psalms
[43:45] 145. God is the only one that can
[43:47] satisfy.
[43:49] Yes.
[43:51] And he's here now in the form of the
[43:53] Holy Ghost.
[43:57] the Holy Ghost. To have it is
[44:00] satisfaction.
[44:03] To not have it is
[44:05] dissatisfaction continuously.
[44:08] Yes. In every area of your life, nothing
[44:12] will be right. Nothing will seem right.
[44:17] I'm going to draw it down to a close on
[44:18] these points. Philippians chapter 4
[44:21] verse 11. This is a man with the Holy
[44:23] Ghost, right? He says in Philippians 4
[44:27] 11 starting not that I speak in respect
[44:30] of want for I have learned in whatsoever
[44:33] state I am therewith to be content.
[44:37] Amen. Amen. The Bible says godliness
[44:40] with contentment is great gain.
[44:43] Huh? Dissatisfaction is to be
[44:46] discontented. But the Holy Ghost brings
[44:49] contentment.
[44:52] Amen. He says, "I know in verse 12, I
[44:55] know both how to be abased and I know
[44:57] how to abound everywhere and in all
[45:00] things I am instructed both to be full."
[45:02] And he says, "What?" He said, "I am
[45:04] instructed."
[45:06] Where is that instruction coming from?
[45:09] Huh? Where is that power? You know, it's
[45:12] an actual power that helps you to be
[45:14] content. Amen.
[45:16] Cuz there's things that you want.
[45:18] There's things that you want to do.
[45:19] Amen. But there is a power that'll come
[45:21] and grab a hold of you and bring
[45:23] everything down. Temper everything right
[45:25] down. Settle it down.
[45:27] Sit down. Settle down. Be patient.
[45:32] Pray.
[45:33] Wait for me. I got a plan. I got a
[45:37] purpose. I got I got a
[45:40] provision that's specifically for
[45:46] you. Paul said, "I've been instructed
[45:49] I've experienced lack and I've
[45:52] experienced fit for uh you know
[45:57] abundance. Well, it don't matter which
[45:59] God w which which condition God allows
[46:02] me to experience. I've learned he's
[46:05] taught me to be satisfied. Amen.
[46:14] Man, so high blood
[46:17] pressure. Many times it comes from
[46:21] stresses. Stresses of
[46:23] life. Things that you're overly
[46:25] concerned about.
[46:28] Amen. Things you I'mma say it like this.
[46:31] Things you haven't given over to God
[46:33] properly.
[46:36] You see it as too big for you. is too
[46:38] much for you. And then the devil, the
[46:40] devil want to get your mind and lock it
[46:42] into that cycle of thinking about all
[46:45] those things that's just too much.
[46:47] That's gone too far. You know, he want
[46:50] to lock you in right there. Cuz with
[46:51] those cycle of thoughts, now all of a
[46:54] sudden you start experiencing physical
[46:56] ailments.
[46:58] Yes. All because of the mind.
[47:02] And when Satan can get in that mind,
[47:06] but how many realize God will bring your
[47:07] blood pressure down
[47:10] without a pill
[47:12] with side effects? Amen. Hallelujah. You
[47:15] want to know how God bl we ain't got
[47:17] high blood pressure. We ain't claiming
[47:19] that for nobody. You want to know how
[47:21] God do that? How he achieves that? Amen.
[47:24] He gives us something to do. Now we got
[47:26] to take the prescription. Amen. He says,
[47:28] "They that keep their mind stayed on
[47:32] me."
[47:34] I'll keep it in what?
[47:36] What kind of peace? That come that
[47:39] that's a godly heavenly peace. That
[47:40] ain't a man. That ain't an earthly
[47:42] peace. Amen. Cuz people on the earth,
[47:44] humans, they say they got peace and you
[47:46] ain't got me.
[47:48] You know what? Many times they do that
[47:51] because they taking substitutes and
[47:53] they've been deceived into thinking, you
[47:55] know, people they talking about, you
[47:57] know, they
[47:58] I got a they got bills to pay. They got
[48:01] all kind of human problems, relationship
[48:04] problems and all that stuff, you know.
[48:06] And the devil say, "Now just go get you
[48:08] a
[48:12] cigarette." Them two fingers,
[48:17] you know how much money the tobacco the
[48:19] the tobacco industry make every year,
[48:22] every month, every day?
[48:26] When I was little, I remember cuz my
[48:30] grandma used to smoke cigarettes. It was
[48:32] like below a
[48:34] dollar. I think now it's like four,
[48:37] five, $6 or 10. 10. He said 10. Come on,
[48:41] somebody. That's enough to deliver you
[48:44] right there. Should be. Hey remember,
[48:48] when something got a hold of
[48:51] you, you be paying, you know how much
[48:54] money that is and how many packs people
[48:56] smoke? All for
[48:58] what? Trying to escape the realities of
[49:01] life. Amen. Uhhuh. Substitutes that
[49:05] don't satisfy. That's why you got to
[49:07] pull out another $10 to get another pack
[49:10] to start smoking another string because
[49:13] it ain't hitting it. That's right.
[49:16] Right. Amen.
[49:19] Glory to God.
[49:21] But this hit it right here. This will
[49:24] make you stop. It'll make you have no
[49:26] more cravings. Amen. It'll satisfy you
[49:30] to where you will never desire to to
[49:33] taste tar again.
[49:36] That's right. Hallelujah.
[49:40] Glory. He says in verse 13, I can do all
[49:43] things through Christ. That's why he
[49:46] says he can he learned how to be a base
[49:48] and how to abound and to be content no
[49:50] matter what state he's in. It was
[49:51] because of Christ the satisfier who is
[49:55] God.
[49:58] All right. Few more scriptures and I'm
[50:00] done.
[50:02] So then it talks about you know he opens
[50:04] up his hand and he satisfies every
[50:07] living thing. Right. Amen. And also in
[50:10] the book of Habach 3:4 show you what's
[50:13] in his hand. See, it says, "And in his
[50:16] in his and in his brightness was and his
[50:18] brightness was as the light." It says,
[50:21] "And and he had horns coming out of his
[50:24] hand, and there was the hiding of his
[50:28] power." So, that goes deep, too. I ain't
[50:32] I ain't I ain't go no further with that
[50:34] thought. I'm just showing you the
[50:36] scripture, right? God has power in his
[50:40] hand.
[50:42] Obviously, he has a
[50:45] substance that's greater than any
[50:49] substance that's amongst mankind. Now,
[50:52] he's the greatest
[50:54] substance,
[50:56] man. Psalm 6565 and verse4 it says,
[51:00] "Blessed is the man whom thou choosest
[51:03] and causes to approach unto thee." It
[51:06] says, "That he may dwell in thy courts."
[51:08] It says, "We shall be satisfied with the
[51:12] goodness of thy house."
[51:15] Again, things that come from the Lord,
[51:17] coming to his house, entering into his
[51:19] courts, but he causes that to happen.
[51:22] Hallelujah. Amen. No man can come to me
[51:24] except my father draw him first. Isn't
[51:28] that right? Amen. But there is a
[51:30] satisfaction that come along with
[51:31] entering into his courts and abiding in
[51:34] his house. Hallelujah.
[51:37] Amen. Yes. Last verse of
[51:41] scripture, Proverbs 14 and 14.
[51:47] It says, "The backslider in heart shall
[51:50] be filled with his what?"
[51:54] The Bible talks
[51:56] about individuals whose God is their
[51:59] belly.
[52:02] And that's talking about their own
[52:05] desires. And because they put their own
[52:08] desires before God, it becomes their
[52:12] God. And in
[52:15] actuality, that means that Satan is
[52:17] their God
[52:19] because he brings selfishness. He brings
[52:23] self-centeredness, right? He brings
[52:25] about a person putting it putting things
[52:28] before the Lord whose God is their
[52:31] belly. The Bible says whose glory is
[52:34] within their shame. So the thing that's
[52:37] shameful which is the result of what
[52:39] they're indulging in that's their glory.
[52:43] Yes. You see that's that's what they
[52:45] live for.
[52:47] You understand what I'm saying?
[52:51] It says the backslider in heart shall be
[52:53] filled with his own ways. It says, "And
[52:56] a good man," notice how it words this,
[52:59] "shall be satisfied from himself,"
[53:06] meaning God will keep him from indulging
[53:09] in the fleshly lusts of this life,
[53:13] the places he could go, the things he
[53:16] could do. When God comes into a man's
[53:18] life, he satisfies him from himself.
[53:35] This part here touched me saying,
[53:43] "Man, I'm I'm I'mma stop
[53:46] with two two quotes.
[53:53] The first one is message called thirst
[53:56] 1965 September the 19th paragraph 141 he
[54:01] says and why would we want to take a
[54:04] substitute when there is a genuine
[54:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost that satisfies
[54:11] every fiber and longing in the human
[54:15] soul. Amen.
[54:20] That's scriptural. We just read it.
[54:23] Amen.
[54:25] Last thing I'll leave you with and this
[54:27] is
[54:28] it. This really touched
[54:30] me. As I said, people look for
[54:34] acceptance. They long that they they
[54:37] long to be liked. People become too
[54:39] wrapped up into being liked,
[54:42] right? to the point to that bring it
[54:45] brings them to the to
[54:48] compromise, you know, they'll begin to
[54:50] look out at groups or individuals or
[54:53] whatever that they, you know, I I want
[54:54] to have that person in my I want to be
[54:57] associated with that person or whatever,
[54:59] man or woman for whatever the reason is,
[55:02] right?
[55:06] And they're willing to
[55:07] compromise and knuck down to things that
[55:10] they
[55:12] shouldn't just to have another sinborn
[55:16] person that ain't got nothing that once
[55:19] you get it, you going to be you going to
[55:20] be thoroughly
[55:22] dissatisfied just to have another
[55:25] fleshborn, sinborn
[55:27] person acknowledge you.
[55:32] Social media is full of it.
[55:36] People get
[55:38] depressed, start going in all kind of
[55:41] what you call it
[55:44] uh self-esteem
[55:47] problems. Why? because they make
[55:50] posts, put out
[55:53] pictures, and nobody hit that little
[55:55] blue like button or that little red
[55:57] heart button or that other little hug
[56:00] button with a heart in
[56:06] it. Don't let no likes or nothing
[56:10] come. Oh
[56:12] man,
[56:14] why start going through all kind for
[56:17] what? Who are they? Right? You you you
[56:21] here to prepare for your afterlife.
[56:24] You ain't here to to to be to to become
[56:26] all kind of friends to all kind of
[56:28] people. Now God will give you friends.
[56:30] You won't real watch this.
[56:34] Um this message called thirst. I already
[56:37] told you that. He says, "When I was a
[56:39] little boy, I remember I was raised in a
[56:42] real poor family and I remember many of
[56:45] times I would go out with with fellows
[56:48] and I couldn't dress to go out to a
[56:51] decent place." But I Oh
[56:55] my, you know, God subject us to certain
[56:58] things.
[56:59] Sometimes he had to deal with this
[57:01] because it was building something in
[57:03] him. It was establishing something in
[57:05] him that was going to be needful for his
[57:07] future.
[57:08] Amen.
[57:13] Man, I couldn't dress like like like to
[57:16] go out to a decent place. I don't know
[57:18] that there is something about people
[57:20] that I liked. I like to get with them,
[57:23] but I was more or less he says what what
[57:26] he says what is called the black
[57:28] sheep. And when I get when I when I got
[57:31] saved, listen. And when I got
[57:34] saved and I found that something in me
[57:37] that I thirsted for, he said, "A friend,
[57:43] somebody that would be a
[57:45] buddy to me, somebody I could trust,
[57:50] somebody you can set down to and talk
[57:53] your troubles over with."
[57:57] God. Many times God let so many things
[58:00] be
[58:01] disrupted when it comes to our dealings
[58:03] with other people because he wants to be
[58:06] he want to show that I'm the one that's
[58:08] supposed to satisfy that.
[58:11] You looking to this person and that
[58:13] person you you you done judged them in
[58:15] your own sight. Oh, you know it'd be
[58:17] it'd be good to be a friend with that
[58:19] person, that sister, that brother,
[58:20] whatever. What? And then things ain't
[58:22] working out right. And now all of a
[58:24] sudden the devil battling you in your
[58:25] mind about you making you feel like
[58:27] something wrong with you. When the whole
[58:30] time God is trying to help you to see
[58:31] I'm your buddy.
[58:34] I can you you can you can get so close
[58:36] to me till you can sit down and have a
[58:38] conversation with me and hear me speak
[58:40] back on a more regular basis. Right.
[58:44] But you listen to that devil talking to
[58:46] your spirit and in your mind and have
[58:48] you going all over the place,
[58:50] experiencing all sorts of heartache and
[58:52] trouble and pain. Yes, sir.
[58:55] Why? Cuz you looking for a
[59:00] friend, somebody I could trust, somebody
[59:03] you can sit down to talk to sit down to
[59:07] and talk talk your troubles over with.
[59:10] He says, "And when I found that real
[59:12] true
[59:13] satisfaction. When I found Jesus Christ,
[59:17] that real true satisfier that takes away
[59:21] all, quenches all that thirst and gives
[59:24] you something that that just looks like
[59:27] that there is just nothing to take his
[59:30] place.
[59:33] Can we say praise the Lord?
[59:37] Satisfaction.
[59:41] We all want it.
[59:44] We all need it.
[59:47] But it only comes from one place.
[59:50] And the more we give ourselves to him,
[59:53] the more satisfaction each one of us
[59:56] will experience.
[59:59] I know that there is
[1:00:02] a there's dissatisfaction in this room
[1:00:06] tonight.
[1:00:09] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:12] Glory. And now you ain't got no excuse.
[1:00:17] Amen. He done told you, "I'm your
[1:00:20] satisfier." Amen. Give yourself to me.
[1:00:25] Hallelujah. And I'll quench every
[1:00:27] thirst.
[1:00:30] Things you ain't know you was thirsting
[1:00:31] for, it'll be filled.
[1:00:34] You'll be
[1:00:36] content. It'll make you whole. you will
[1:00:39] actually be able to be
[1:00:41] happy even though everything around you
[1:00:44] dictates that you're supposed to not be
[1:00:46] happy. The devil a fight but as long as
[1:00:50] you ain't as long as you stay locked in
[1:00:52] focus and even even that is not of
[1:00:54] yourself.
[1:00:56] You can't stay focused on your own.
[1:00:59] Can we say praise the Lord? Cuz we
[1:01:01] within
[1:01:02] ourselves we let go. We get tired. We
[1:01:07] get weary. Listen, we within oursel we
[1:01:10] make wrong decisions.
[1:01:12] Amen. Huh? Yes, sir. Cuz that that that
[1:01:14] that that spirit
[1:01:17] speaking, making you feel like this,
[1:01:20] that, or the other bring a certain
[1:01:22] satisfaction, but all it do is bring
[1:01:25] corruption. And the more you drink into
[1:01:27] it, the more corrupted you
[1:01:30] become until spiritually speaking, it'll
[1:01:33] take you out.
[1:01:42] sucks. That was the Lord.
[1:01:46] Hallelujah. I'm sorry. That was just
[1:01:49] God.
[1:01:50] Cuz ain't no way in the
[1:01:52] [Applause]
[1:01:57] world. He loves us.
[1:02:01] Amen.
[1:02:03] He takes time to come by our way
[1:02:06] and give me in due season. Amen.
[1:02:11] Let us stand together.
[1:02:17] Let us just bow our heads and our
[1:02:20] hearts. Everybody
[1:02:24] bow. I don't have to ask for hands to be
[1:02:28] raised because I already
[1:02:30] know. I know what I need. I need more of
[1:02:34] this satisfier.
[1:02:37] I have dissatisfying places in my life.
[1:02:41] Amen. Amen.
[1:02:44] Praise
[1:02:47] God. He's a true friend. Yes, Jesus. You
[1:02:52] will never receive a friend that's a
[1:02:54] greater friend. That's right. That's
[1:02:56] right.
[1:02:57] And he wants us to acknowledge him as
[1:03:01] our friend. He wants to fill that space.
[1:03:07] Now that's a friend with true
[1:03:11] benefits. Not trying to gain advantages
[1:03:14] in the world by linking up with people
[1:03:17] that are detrimental to your spiritual
[1:03:20] health, but being connected to the true
[1:03:23] lifegiver. Yes, Lord. Heavenly Father,
[1:03:27] you know every heart in here.
[1:03:29] Amen. God, you spoke tonight not because
[1:03:33] I'm here. It's never because of me. It's
[1:03:36] because it's what you purpose to do,
[1:03:39] Lord. You take time, Father. You got
[1:03:42] things that you want to say. Glory.
[1:03:45] Amen. And you you just so happen to do
[1:03:47] it through human
[1:03:49] instrumentality. You know me, Lord. You
[1:03:52] know that I realize I'm nothing.
[1:03:54] I can't do nothing. I don't have
[1:03:56] nothing. Lord,
[1:03:59] you are my everything. Yes, Lord.
[1:04:03] And Lord, we all are very sorry for how
[1:04:05] we've treated you.
[1:04:08] We've not given you what you've
[1:04:09] deserved,
[1:04:11] Lord. Father, you've been patient.
[1:04:13] You've been very long-suffering, Father.
[1:04:16] God, you've you've done much more than
[1:04:20] what we ever deserve. We We don't even
[1:04:21] deserve nothing.
[1:04:23] You you you you've protected us, Lord
[1:04:27] God, in our bad decisions, Father. Lord,
[1:04:30] you've protected us, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] The devil was trying to take us out,
[1:04:34] Father God, but Lord, you you were
[1:04:36] there. Amen. Even when we were turning
[1:04:38] our backs on you, Lord. Amen. You you
[1:04:42] you didn't turn your back on us, but you
[1:04:45] stayed there with Glory to God. That's a
[1:04:48] love that we're not used to,
[1:04:50] Lord. Amen. That's a divine love,
[1:04:53] Lord, that'll be mistreated, Father God,
[1:04:57] but still stay
[1:04:58] there. Amen. To be a benefit and a help
[1:05:02] to the one that's being
[1:05:04] loved. God, it's only because of you,
[1:05:07] Lord. And how grateful we are, Father,
[1:05:11] that we found favor in your sight. We
[1:05:14] didn't deserve it, Lord, but we found
[1:05:16] favor in your sight, Father, because of
[1:05:19] your grace, your unmmerited favor to
[1:05:23] each one of us, Lord. So God, we ask
[1:05:26] that you would please forgive us of our
[1:05:30] neglect. Forgive us, Lord God,
[1:05:35] of of our willful disobedience too many
[1:05:38] times.
[1:05:41] God, as your prophet said, Lord, we can
[1:05:43] prostitute our time
[1:05:45] away. Time that belongs to you, Lord,
[1:05:48] and we're giving it to so many
[1:05:51] substitutes. That leaves us in the end
[1:05:54] feeling
[1:05:56] void. It doesn't
[1:05:59] satisfy. But it's evil spirits that that
[1:06:01] come in, Lord, and and have us to go
[1:06:04] back to these things, Lord. Amen. And
[1:06:07] it's very clear. And you you you you
[1:06:09] you've caused it to become very clear,
[1:06:11] Lord, that these things have not been
[1:06:14] able to do for us what our hearts are
[1:06:16] longing
[1:06:18] for. It takes us away from it, Father.
[1:06:22] It makes the condition worse.
[1:06:27] But Lord, because of what you have
[1:06:29] planned for us, because of what you had
[1:06:32] planned for that woman at the well,
[1:06:35] regardless of how many partners she's
[1:06:38] had, she came to a place to where she
[1:06:41] met her last partner as far as in the
[1:06:44] way of her present
[1:06:47] lifestyle. Once she came in contact with
[1:06:49] you, Lord, that was the end of her
[1:06:52] lifestyle. In that
[1:06:53] way, she became a new person,
[1:06:57] Lord. And by your grace, Father God,
[1:06:59] you've come by each one of our ways,
[1:07:03] Lord. And Lord, you you have become our
[1:07:08] satisfier. So, Lord, may we give
[1:07:11] ourselves to you more because we're not
[1:07:13] satisfied even when even in where we're
[1:07:15] at now.
[1:07:17] May we give ourselves to you more, Lord,
[1:07:19] that you might come and fill our lives.
[1:07:23] Even as your prophet said, you want to
[1:07:25] fill every fiber and every longing of
[1:07:28] the human
[1:07:31] soul. Let it be so in our lives,
[1:07:34] Lord. That's what we're here for. You're
[1:07:38] preparing us for our future home.
[1:07:42] Amen. Now, that's a place of
[1:07:44] satisfaction.
[1:07:47] Amen. We're homesick, heavenly father.
[1:07:51] This is not our home,
[1:07:54] Lord. We all have come to recognize
[1:07:56] that, Father. And you're stirring up
[1:07:58] your
[1:08:00] nest. Amen. Lord, you're fluttering over
[1:08:03] your young, Father. You're making us
[1:08:06] uncomfortable in this life, in these
[1:08:08] situations, Lord, because we were never
[1:08:10] made to be comfortable here.
[1:08:15] Amen. You're stirring our taste for our
[1:08:18] new home. You're stirring our souls for
[1:08:21] a new
[1:08:22] place. Abraham's soul was
[1:08:25] stirred. And he looked for a city, Lord,
[1:08:28] whose builder and maker was
[1:08:31] God. And supernaturally, Lord, you had
[1:08:34] him standing over the very spot. Amen.
[1:08:38] That that mountain is going to protrude
[1:08:40] up from, Lord.
[1:08:42] Amen.
[1:08:44] Man, you're so good. Lord, forgive us,
[1:08:47] heavenly father. Help us, Lord God, to
[1:08:51] humble ourselves to you, Lord, and to
[1:08:54] begin to give you more of what you're
[1:08:56] looking for and what you're calling for
[1:08:58] that'll please you, Lord. Because you're
[1:09:00] only here to help us, Father. We're not
[1:09:03] doing you any
[1:09:04] favors. You're here to do us favors,
[1:09:07] Lord. You're here to benefit us.
[1:09:10] Who are we to neglect such greater a
[1:09:15] salvation? Bless every heart, every
[1:09:18] need, every soul, every spirit, every
[1:09:27] mind by your
[1:09:29] grace. We commit it all to you, Lord,
[1:09:33] because you are the great
[1:09:34] creator. Hallelujah. In the mighty name
[1:09:38] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we
[1:09:41] ask all these things and we
[1:09:44] pray. Amen.
[1:09:47] Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:09:48] praise.
