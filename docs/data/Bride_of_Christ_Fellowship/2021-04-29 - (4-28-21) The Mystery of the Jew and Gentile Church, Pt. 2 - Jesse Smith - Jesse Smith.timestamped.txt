[32:31] our bible tonight here let's go to
[32:33] uh ephesians chapter three and then
[32:34] we'll read our memory verse from brother
[32:36] jose
[32:37] and i believe sister naomi you're up for
[32:38] for may so maybe be meditating on a
[32:41] scripture if you'd like
[32:42] if you'd like to do one you don't have
[32:43] to but i think you're up for me by god's
[32:45] grace
[32:46] so look forward to that by god's grace
[32:48] boy it's hard to believe april's almost
[32:49] over
[32:50] uh but thank the lord it's been a
[32:52] wonderful month uh beautiful weather
[32:53] today man just what a what a blessing
[32:55] what in a refreshment
[32:56] an encouragement uh god is so gracious
[32:59] so good to us
[33:03] i like to look again at uh the new
[33:04] testament or the mystery of the jew and
[33:06] gentile church i'll just kind of
[33:08] keep it shorter brother braham calls it
[33:10] uh
[33:11] the mystery of the new testament church
[33:13] composed of both
[33:14] jew and gentile i like to continue on
[33:16] this
[33:17] thought here tonight so ephesians
[33:19] chapter 3.
[33:20] it's actually verses 1-11 we won't read
[33:22] all those but
[33:24] we kind of have a good understanding of
[33:25] them a couple years ago we preached on
[33:28] the whole book of ephesians so
[33:30] it's not as if we've never heard it but
[33:33] as christians we know and as humans we
[33:35] just need reminders
[33:36] i always ben i'm always benefited i
[33:38] forget so much i've preached so much
[33:40] i've read so much
[33:41] but i always forget so much so i just
[33:44] need uh constant reminders
[33:46] from the holy spirit uh in this
[33:48] particular portion paul uses the word
[33:49] mystery four times
[33:51] and he's talking about this same
[33:53] revelation the same
[33:54] revelation of the jew and gentile making
[33:58] one church and i'm so glad to be a part
[34:00] of it praise god
[34:01] what a blessing remember the bible said
[34:03] before we were heathens without
[34:05] knowledge without covenants without
[34:07] blessings we had nothing
[34:08] but now we got the full benefits amen we
[34:11] had no inheritance before
[34:13] but now we're the sons and daughters
[34:14] which song it says that we're
[34:16] we're the son now we're the sons and
[34:17] daughters seem like there's a song we've
[34:19] been singing
[34:20] lately that we were the beggars now yeah
[34:22] that's what i'm thinking
[34:23] we were the beggars now we're royalty i
[34:25] think it's kind of that one we were the
[34:27] prisoners now we're
[34:28] roman free by god's grace one of those
[34:31] songs
[34:33] ephesians chapter 3 thank the lord jesus
[34:35] amen so much to thank him for i'm
[34:36] singing to that scripture this week and
[34:40] how deuteronomy 28 said therefore he
[34:43] said
[34:43] god said because you did not serve the
[34:45] lord your god with joyfulness and
[34:46] gladness in the heart
[34:47] therefore you will serve your enemies
[34:49] which i'll send against you so
[34:50] it was just an encouragement to me i
[34:52] always want to praise god and be joyful
[34:54] i always want to serve god it's a joy to
[34:56] pray it's a joy to come to the house of
[34:58] god
[34:59] our flesh doesn't think so but our soul
[35:01] does
[35:02] and we've got to bring that bodiness
[35:03] objection amen
[35:05] so we thank the lord for that ephesians
[35:07] 3
[35:09] what a beautiful revelation
[35:13] it was not made known before the church
[35:16] ages they had no idea about this mystery
[35:19] none they just thought it was always
[35:20] going to be jews
[35:22] but god revealed it to paul the pharisee
[35:26] of the pharisees
[35:28] what a what a revelation verse 4 let's
[35:31] read verse 4 and we'll read
[35:34] well let me read four and five and then
[35:36] we'll all read six okay let me read four
[35:38] and five myself
[35:40] whereby when ye read you may understand
[35:42] my knowledge in the mystery of christ
[35:44] which in other ages was not made known
[35:47] unto the sons of men
[35:48] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[35:50] apostles and prophets
[35:52] by the spirit so they just cannot
[35:53] understand it i heard a man today said
[35:55] when the jews
[35:56] in the old testament looked at prophecy
[35:58] they saw mountaintops they saw the
[36:00] coming of christ
[36:02] they saw the millennium they saw the
[36:03] future home but it's like they missed
[36:05] the gentile part the church ages because
[36:07] it was hidden from them
[36:08] it's like that was the that was the
[36:10] valleys all they could see was the
[36:12] mountains and
[36:12] the white throne judgment right daniel
[36:14] saw the white throne judgment and jesus
[36:16] sitting on his throne the son of man
[36:18] and it was hidden all those valleys were
[36:20] hidden from them they could only see the
[36:22] mountain peaks for the gentile people
[36:24] i'm sorry for the jewish people israel
[36:26] but god
[36:27] hid it but he made it known by the
[36:29] apostle paul let's read verse six
[36:31] together
[36:31] on three one two three that the gentiles
[36:34] should be
[36:35] fellow heirs and of the same body
[36:38] and partakers of his promise in christ
[36:42] by the gospel amen let's go to uh sorry
[36:45] psalm 24.
[36:49] psalms 24 7.
[36:57] let's read this together on three one
[36:59] two three
[37:00] lift up your heads o ye gates and be
[37:04] lift up ye everlasting doors and the
[37:07] king of glory shall come
[37:09] in who is this king of glory the lord
[37:12] strong and mighty the lord mighty in
[37:15] battle
[37:16] lift up your heads o ye gates even lift
[37:20] them
[37:20] up ye everlasting doors and the king of
[37:23] glory shall come in
[37:25] who is this king of glory the lord of
[37:28] hosts
[37:29] he is the king of glory salah let's have
[37:32] one more word of prayer here
[37:33] heavenly father we love you we bless
[37:35] your holy name
[37:36] you died for us we know you love us now
[37:38] help us lord to love you more
[37:40] we know your love will never change
[37:42] towards us lord god
[37:43] there's nothing that can separate us
[37:45] from your love thank you god
[37:47] for such an amazing promise now lord
[37:49] help us to love you more
[37:50] help us to die to ourselves lord god and
[37:53] walk in the spirit lord god crucifying
[37:55] the lust of the flesh and the affections
[37:57] thereof
[37:58] that we might produce the fruits of the
[37:59] holy spirit bless the saints that press
[38:01] their way out to the house of god we
[38:03] appreciate their
[38:04] great sacrifice in the in the middle of
[38:05] the week lord god and we pray you'll
[38:07] bless them abundantly
[38:08] also bless the saints listening and
[38:10] father may the holy spirit have
[38:11] preeminence in our hearts and lives and
[38:13] and just direct every word to where it
[38:15] needs to go in jesus christ's name and
[38:17] the saint said
[38:18] amen god bless you as you're being
[38:20] seated praise god
[38:22] i want to just uh kind of start back to
[38:24] where we left off we kind of ended with
[38:26] the
[38:27] uh the the liberties and so i just
[38:29] wanted i just had a few more things to
[38:31] say about christian liberties
[38:33] uh we ended last week with numerous
[38:36] scriptures about that
[38:40] so i just want to say that god as we saw
[38:43] last week uh
[38:46] with this with this revelation god uh
[38:49] god destroyed any separation right he
[38:52] destroyed he eliminated
[38:54] any uh discrimination we said now
[38:56] remember god purposely discriminated
[38:58] israel and abraham so he could teach
[39:01] them it would be a school master to
[39:03] bring them to christ
[39:04] to show them that they couldn't earn
[39:06] salvation
[39:07] right they were going to show them
[39:08] through all the multitudes of sacrifices
[39:11] at one point god told isaiah what is
[39:13] this multitude of sacrifices to me
[39:15] he said it's a stink in my nostrils
[39:17] right think about all these animals that
[39:19] had to die
[39:20] because of the sins of israel but god
[39:23] was using it as a teacher
[39:25] to show them that they couldn't earn it
[39:27] animal blood
[39:28] could never wash away sins but the blood
[39:31] of jesus christ could wash away sins
[39:33] amen
[39:33] and that's what it was teaching and we
[39:36] saw
[39:37] last week how god loves variety
[39:40] we know he gives us uh uh he gives us
[39:43] differences in the foods we eat
[39:46] uh also the the holy days we observe
[39:50] uh wine and jewelry
[39:53] okay so we looked at that last week a
[39:55] little bit and then we kind of ended uh
[39:57] i might have i think i stopped the live
[39:59] stream but we kind of ended on some
[40:01] some uh some issues that may relate to
[40:04] us a little more like
[40:05] sometimes we discriminate against the
[40:07] poor right
[40:09] or someone rich walks in you can tell
[40:10] right away we treat them extra special
[40:12] right
[40:13] or we may do that hopefully we don't but
[40:15] we might do that we might fall short of
[40:16] god's glory
[40:18] because remember peter was a holy
[40:19] ghost-filled man and yet he separated
[40:21] himself from the gentiles right
[40:23] for a short time he and he even
[40:25] influenced barnabas to do that
[40:26] we must be careful about our influence
[40:29] that we have with others
[40:31] right so we see that that was one that
[40:34] we could relate to oh rich people are on
[40:36] the message they might get better
[40:38] uh better treatment also if your name uh
[40:41] is near
[40:42] branham or if you're related to branham
[40:44] or are related to a
[40:45] well-known preacher you might get some
[40:47] preferences right
[40:48] you might get treated a little better
[40:51] also maybe
[40:52] if people don't smell as good as others
[40:54] or don't take care of themselves or
[40:57] brush their teeth like they ought to we
[40:58] say the more dirty people the people
[41:00] that don't keep hygiene
[41:02] they might not get treated as well but
[41:04] see the love of jesus christ
[41:06] is what separates us right from
[41:09] uh that makes us actually the true bride
[41:11] of christ
[41:12] because jesus said my disciples are
[41:14] known by their love
[41:16] one for another and while some of these
[41:18] people that come amongst us maybe the
[41:20] extra rich or those that have a name
[41:22] or those that are not clean or don't
[41:24] brush their teeth or
[41:25] uh they don't take care of themselves uh
[41:28] they may not be christ's people right
[41:30] but we're still to love our enemies so
[41:34] no matter what whether they're in the
[41:35] body of christ or whether they're
[41:36] enemies to christ
[41:38] we are to show them some level of love
[41:40] now you also got to balance that with
[41:42] paul
[41:42] who we ended with last week he gave us
[41:44] permission separate yourselves from
[41:46] those that cause division
[41:49] so we can separate from people and yet
[41:51] still love them
[41:52] sometimes love is tough right but you
[41:55] know real christian love though should
[41:57] also be sweet at times
[41:58] paul calls it tenderhearted
[42:01] so sometimes we have tough love but many
[42:04] times we need to have
[42:05] tender hearted love praise god that's
[42:08] what we forget sometimes as messages
[42:10] message people
[42:10] we hear so much love is correct love is
[42:12] correct and that's true
[42:14] but sometimes we need to remember love
[42:15] is tenderhearted too
[42:17] praise god uh so we remember that uh
[42:21] sometimes love speaks words of grace
[42:24] right word seasoned with grace and not
[42:26] so
[42:27] uh not not so hurtful or we say maybe
[42:30] direct
[42:31] uh so we have to remember that and keep
[42:33] that in mind
[42:36] now see so so christians today that come
[42:40] into christianity but yet they're
[42:42] eastern christians
[42:44] they will probably make different
[42:45] choices than you and i on food
[42:48] holy days wine and jewelry right they
[42:51] may do that
[42:53] okay so if we hear about you know
[42:55] eastern christians worshiping
[42:57] different than us we must be not quick
[43:00] to judge see message people if they're
[43:01] not careful
[43:02] they get quick to judge i'm talking
[43:05] about judging their souls
[43:06] right we're supposed to judge fruits we
[43:08] just preached on that recently right
[43:10] we're to judge fruits but we're also we
[43:12] should be
[43:13] wise enough to to not judge people's
[43:15] souls
[43:16] and just and judge is this a liberty or
[43:19] are they actually breaking the word of
[43:20] god
[43:22] right and these are some of the areas uh
[43:24] that we may see
[43:26] people differ than us so instead of
[43:29] being quick to judge
[43:30] we should reach out and love and seek to
[43:33] understand we should ask questions
[43:35] right like i did with the jeffersonville
[43:37] like the prophet the prophet's sons i
[43:39] reached out to them with questions first
[43:41] i got answers from joseph i didn't get
[43:42] any from billy paul that's fine
[43:44] they don't have to you know they're kind
[43:47] but we should seek to understand first
[43:50] before we
[43:51] uh make any official statements right or
[43:53] judging
[43:55] unless the holy spirit would give us
[43:56] some certain insight like a discernment
[43:59] spirit
[44:00] okay and as paul said we must respect
[44:04] others convictions and be thankful
[44:06] they're trying their best to worship
[44:07] jesus
[44:09] right because we can be confident that
[44:11] if god started the work of salvation
[44:14] in their lives then god will finish it
[44:16] just like he's doing in
[44:17] our lives amen think about when you
[44:20] first came the message
[44:21] did you have everything figured out i
[44:24] still don't
[44:25] but i'm very thankful for what god did
[44:27] show me at the beginning
[44:29] right and i'm still learning and as i
[44:30] said i haven't changed many doctrines
[44:32] but i'm learning to have a more uh a
[44:35] more
[44:36] patient mindset towards people and not
[44:38] quick to judge
[44:40] because god does give areas of liberty
[44:43] and if we're sensitive to the holy
[44:44] spirit
[44:45] we'll continue uh to be guided into all
[44:48] truth
[44:49] right now today there's a lot of there's
[44:52] just a lot
[44:52] there's a few message churches that are
[44:54] now bringing jewish traditions into
[44:56] their worship
[44:57] which is fine they're allowed to do that
[44:59] like we have friends that have visited
[45:01] us before
[45:02] that do that i've talked with their
[45:03] pastor on text never face to face or
[45:06] never over the phone but
[45:07] through text and he told me how they
[45:09] they dance they have dance they have the
[45:11] young girls
[45:12] have a dance team and they got the long
[45:14] dresses on
[45:15] and they got flags and they'll dance in
[45:17] front of the churches and
[45:18] and he told me lots of message people
[45:20] have condemned them for having girls
[45:22] dance on a dance team but the bible says
[45:25] praise the lord with dancing amen
[45:28] so he encouraged me you know to that's
[45:30] when i had my my daughters in the dance
[45:32] class you know they don't do it anymore
[45:34] because they're covered in different you
[45:35] know
[45:35] they don't want to that's fine but
[45:37] there's nothing wrong with uh with a
[45:39] choreographed dance right just like
[45:42] there's nothing wrong with a
[45:43] choreographed song special right
[45:46] is that right and that's how the jews
[45:49] dance
[45:49] was it was choreographed many times
[45:52] right they just
[45:53] and that's what the brothers showed me
[45:54] show me videos and that you know the
[45:55] women would all dance together they'd
[45:57] they'd go in a circle they'd all be in a
[45:59] circle and they'd some of them would
[46:00] have tambourines
[46:01] and they'd have a certain step and they
[46:02] would kick and you know
[46:04] they just had their own cultural dances
[46:06] what's wrong with that there's nothing
[46:08] wrong with that
[46:09] right just like today a lot of message
[46:12] churches do those plays right they do
[46:13] the holy ghost plays
[46:14] brother and call them a holy ghost play
[46:17] what's wrong with that that's all
[46:18] choreographed
[46:19] right and that's not even really singing
[46:22] all the time or
[46:22] it's not even preaching it's just
[46:24] telling a story it's storytelling
[46:26] what's wrong with that well nothing
[46:28] that's their liberty as a christian
[46:30] but we can never let like stories uh
[46:33] storytelling or any of these things
[46:35] that can never take the place of the
[46:36] preaching of the gospel
[46:38] because the preaching of the gospel is
[46:40] the power of god unto salvation
[46:42] amen like you can't let the songs take
[46:45] have more prayers than the preaching
[46:47] songs are good that's how we stay in the
[46:49] holy spirit the bible says speak
[46:50] yourselves in psalms and
[46:52] spiritual songs and hymns making melody
[46:55] in your heart to the lord right through
[46:57] singing
[46:57] but it can never take the place of the
[46:59] preaching of the word
[47:01] the bible said wow they peter yet spake
[47:03] the words
[47:04] the holy ghost fell on them that heard
[47:06] the word of god amen
[47:08] so see that's how the baptism of the
[47:10] holy ghost falls but anyways message
[47:12] believers today
[47:13] that are messianic they have that right
[47:16] i've seen and then the brother told me
[47:18] he said they celebrate like
[47:20] a feast of tabernacles uh purim you know
[47:24] they celebrate those
[47:26] but like they don't take the whole seven
[47:27] days like jews do
[47:29] they'll take a weekend and do that
[47:30] they'll set up booths you know
[47:32] and they'll go sit in the booth but then
[47:34] at the end of the day they actually go
[47:35] home that's not how the jews did it the
[47:36] jews actually slept in the booths
[47:39] because it was a it was a reminder that
[47:41] they were in uh tabernacles right
[47:44] god brought them out of egypt as a
[47:45] reminder they didn't have permanent
[47:47] homes for a while
[47:48] they were sojourners and strangers right
[47:51] it was a reminder of that
[47:53] and it's also to point forward and
[47:55] remind them that god is going to
[47:57] tabernacle with his people
[47:58] amen the holy city of god is going to
[48:01] come down to earth from heaven
[48:03] the new jerusalem amen it's god
[48:06] tabernacling with his people amen
[48:09] so what's wrong with that what's wrong
[48:11] with a brother keeping a nazarite vow
[48:13] nothing paul did it but at some point he
[48:17] needs to cut that hair
[48:18] right because it's a shame for them to
[48:20] have long hair
[48:23] and so we have to look at these
[48:25] liberties and the kosher diet like
[48:27] like that church they don't eat meat
[48:28] some of them don't eat meat
[48:30] yet brother branham ate squirrel
[48:33] right he shoots squirrels he says it's
[48:35] from the best tasting meat i don't know
[48:36] i've never had squirrel
[48:38] but they believe brother brown's a
[48:40] prophet and yet they have enough liberty
[48:42] to let brother man eat his squirrel meat
[48:44] but they won't eat meat
[48:45] or they won't eat pork right they'll eat
[48:47] the other meat cattle you know steak
[48:50] because that's that's uh un that's clean
[48:53] to god from the old testament
[48:55] but what's wrong with that nothing's
[48:56] wrong with that they have their liberty
[48:58] to do that now
[48:59] it's wrong if they think they're more
[49:01] holy than us
[49:03] right if we eat squirrel meat let's say
[49:07] i don't but let's say you did they're
[49:09] not more holy because they sit in t
[49:11] and boost you know throughout the day uh
[49:14] they're in august or i'm sorry
[49:16] it's uh september uh that doesn't make
[49:19] them more holy
[49:20] right what makes us holy is the holy
[49:23] spirit praise god
[49:24] and walking in the spirit that's what
[49:27] makes us holy right
[49:28] being born again in the soul and then
[49:30] keeping your mind holy
[49:32] that's what makes you holy
[49:35] so i want to just say that that there's
[49:37] there's a numerous message churches
[49:39] which is fine
[49:39] they're bringing in some of these jewish
[49:41] traditions like for passover
[49:43] they'll they've researched how did the
[49:45] jews actually set the table
[49:47] and so they set up their tables like
[49:48] that and on that thursday night before
[49:51] uh uh monday thursday they called i
[49:53] think
[49:55] they set up the passover they have
[49:56] passover like the jews would
[49:58] well that's fine that's their liberty to
[50:01] do that right
[50:03] just like paul kept the vow we saw that
[50:04] in acts 18 a few weeks ago
[50:06] with the children's bible study these
[50:08] are no longer required under the law
[50:10] but paul was the one who said we're not
[50:12] under the law yet he kept the nazirite
[50:15] battle
[50:16] so he so see he was showing that he has
[50:19] liberty to express his faith
[50:21] through his personal convictions amen
[50:23] remember paul said
[50:25] i have become all things to all men
[50:28] so one of the reasons he may have kept
[50:30] that vow was because the jews around
[50:32] there in jerusalem
[50:33] he wanted to show them that he was a
[50:35] brother that he still
[50:37] accepted their faith and and they were
[50:39] christians right
[50:40] that made that may have been one of the
[50:42] reasons he said to
[50:43] those with with the law i became as
[50:45] those with the law
[50:46] to those without the law i became as
[50:48] without the law right i became all
[50:50] things to all men
[50:51] that i might win some amen praise god
[50:55] so the very man that said we're no
[50:57] longer under these laws
[50:58] he would keep some of them uh to be a
[51:02] light to other people
[51:04] how many can see the wisdom of god in
[51:05] that god gave him the bulk
[51:08] of the new testament and yet he would
[51:10] keep some of the
[51:11] vows and everything like that so see
[51:13] church as the jews
[51:14] chinese muslim hindus all come to christ
[51:17] by the thousands
[51:19] we should rejoice that they're coming
[51:21] respect their liberties
[51:22] right and then if it ever comes to us to
[51:25] help them
[51:26] understand we'll help them understand
[51:28] like aquila and priscilla amen
[51:30] if it's ever our duty god calls us to
[51:32] correct somebody
[51:33] or they ask us questions i get questions
[51:35] all the time on youtube so maybe me i
[51:37] get emails all the time
[51:38] and maybe me might be you you you might
[51:40] uh
[51:41] answer someone's question why do you
[51:43] they might they might watch our service
[51:44] why do you do this
[51:45] like i get asked all the time why do we
[51:47] have a picture of jesus uh
[51:50] isn't that idolatry and i say no the
[51:52] very god that said don't make an image
[51:54] said set up two cherubims and then
[51:55] they're they're usually
[51:56] they're usually consent by that just
[51:57] like brother branham use that same
[51:59] scripture to make people content
[52:01] there's nothing wrong with that as long
[52:03] as we know that's not jesus
[52:05] jesus is in heaven right his spirit's in
[52:07] heaven and his spirit's in us praise god
[52:10] and we don't bow down or worship it's
[52:11] just a reminder and i like that reminder
[52:13] i like looking over there every now and
[52:15] then every service and
[52:16] reminding me that he's present right
[52:18] here amen it's just a little reminder to
[52:20] my eyes amen
[52:22] and so we have that liberty to do that
[52:24] that doesn't condemn us to have a
[52:26] photograph or a picture
[52:29] so what it really comes down to is now
[52:31] as western christians
[52:33] in the western hemisphere we have to
[52:35] humble ourselves
[52:36] and realize we're ignorant about many
[52:38] middle eastern things
[52:40] i'll be the first to say it i'm one of
[52:42] the most ignorant
[52:43] what do i know about jewish traditions
[52:45] what do i know about eastern or
[52:47] asian traditions nothing i don't know
[52:49] anything
[52:50] and many gospel stories can't be
[52:52] understood unless you know the culture
[52:54] of the jews
[52:56] right like the wedding garments why
[52:58] would why would why would that why would
[53:00] the father kick out the man for not
[53:02] having a wedding garment
[53:03] because it was a disgrace that man's
[53:05] having a wedding for a son he bought all
[53:07] these brand new garments
[53:08] and you're going to turn down his
[53:09] beautiful garment he wants you to look
[53:11] your best when his son gets married
[53:13] and if you won't do that that's an act
[53:15] of disrespect just like in ghana the
[53:17] greatest
[53:18] compliment you can do is give somebody
[53:20] clothes i read that one time
[53:21] and so brother william got us close
[53:24] that's a great compliment amen
[53:26] that's a great cultural compliment right
[53:28] that's the same thing you see in the
[53:29] jewish tradition i'm giving you a new
[53:31] garment
[53:32] because my son you are my honored guest
[53:35] i'm honoring you
[53:36] to witness the marriage of my son
[53:39] remember the wine bottles we never would
[53:40] have understood the wine bottles
[53:42] unless broadband would have told us how
[53:44] the jews treat wine bottles right we
[53:46] thought what difference does it make if
[53:47] you put wine in a new bottle road bottle
[53:50] well an old bottle's already stretched
[53:52] out it can't stretch out anymore
[53:54] so you need a new bottle right how about
[53:57] the bridegroom coming at midnight
[54:00] how would you have sisters like that if
[54:02] if you would uh uh
[54:03] i don't think they would like that how
[54:05] would you sisters are like that if the
[54:07] husband could have came and said oh it's
[54:08] wedding time it's midnight
[54:10] and you had to have your dress ready
[54:14] you had to have your hair ready
[54:17] you had to have your veil ready i don't
[54:20] know what everything they need but
[54:22] you had all that ready and you didn't
[54:24] know when he was coming
[54:25] now look at the look at the westerners
[54:27] we know exactly the the hour
[54:29] we got it all lined up on a sheet it's
[54:30] all going to happen like this
[54:32] god was opposite see so see how we we
[54:35] just can't understand some things like
[54:37] that i remember down in south
[54:38] america i told you that we sat there and
[54:41] it was opposite the brother sat there
[54:43] on the front row he said like right here
[54:45] and he's sweating it out you know it's
[54:47] like 100 degrees there
[54:48] he's sweating out he's got a suit and
[54:49] tie on he just saw he don't look happy
[54:51] at all he's just sitting there like when
[54:52] is his sister gonna show up
[54:53] we sat there for an hour or two waiting
[54:56] for this sister to drive up
[54:57] and pretty soon we heard honking horns
[54:59] and this here comes the bride with all
[55:00] of her friends she's got the bridesmaids
[55:02] with her
[55:03] and then finally he stands up and then
[55:05] here comes the bride and they
[55:06] they do the wedding and i'm like boy
[55:08] that's a long way
[55:10] so it's switched in south america at
[55:12] least in that part in guyana
[55:14] the brother sits there and waits he's
[55:15] all sweating it out and
[55:17] he's just waiting for the bride to come
[55:20] but see uh we have to respect these
[55:23] and understand that we must be meek
[55:26] because jesus said to learn of me
[55:28] you must be meek and lowly of heart
[55:32] so this mystery shows again god breaks
[55:34] down all discrimination
[55:36] and if there's ever a time the people of
[55:38] god should have love it's right now amen
[55:41] because all these mysteries have been
[55:43] revealed amen
[55:45] they're all the mystery of god is amen
[55:48] hallelujah
[55:49] and so the love of god is shut abroad in
[55:52] our hearts
[55:52] and if any time we should have walls
[55:54] broken down and the love of god should
[55:56] flow out of
[55:57] us right now amen hallelujah
[56:01] now for my next few minutes give me a
[56:04] half hour here
[56:06] that'll be about 45 minutes now i'm
[56:08] going to start getting into the
[56:09] the deeper scriptures on this
[56:12] revelation i thought it would be most
[56:16] interesting to start with uh how
[56:20] for us the mystery is how could jews
[56:22] it's kind of flipped right
[56:23] how could jews come into the message how
[56:25] could jews
[56:26] how can they bring their their culture
[56:29] into the message of the hour
[56:30] because it's switched because gentiles
[56:32] receive the message first
[56:34] and so we have to understand it that way
[56:36] but in the in the bible days
[56:38] it was opposite how could god bring
[56:40] filthy
[56:41] gentiles into this holiness right
[56:45] so let's get your bibles ready let's do
[56:46] some uh some reading here
[56:51] lydia can you get exodus 12
[56:54] 37 and 38.
[56:58] malachi can you get um
[57:02] second chronicles 2 17.
[57:07] so lydia exodus 12 37 38 malachi
[57:10] 2 chronicles 2 verse 17.
[57:14] so now let's start getting into the
[57:16] biblical evidence for the revelation
[57:18] about jews and gentiles composing one
[57:21] church
[57:22] one church now before we read this keep
[57:26] that up there but before we just
[57:27] let me just say remember god had
[57:29] handpicked abraham
[57:31] to start a holy nation a kingdom of
[57:34] priests right that's what moses
[57:36] eventually said
[57:37] those 400 or 500 years after abraham
[57:40] god had had enough they they you know
[57:42] mankind ruined it at the tower of babel
[57:44] you know he flooded the earth he gave
[57:45] them another chance
[57:46] and they all said let's all be one so
[57:48] god said you got the wrong idea i'm
[57:50] going to scatter you over the face of
[57:51] the earth
[57:52] all mankind is just destitute i'm gonna
[57:54] find one man
[57:56] that will be my friend amen that was
[57:58] abraham praise god
[58:00] and god called abraham unto himself and
[58:03] made his seed exclusive from all other
[58:06] nations
[58:06] in the abrahamic covenant abraham we
[58:08] know had two seeds
[58:10] isaac and ishmael the promise went to
[58:12] isaac
[58:13] who meant laughter i like that laughter
[58:15] god made him laugh there's the joy of
[58:16] the lord
[58:18] hallelujah who have the promises the one
[58:20] with joy
[58:22] isaac amen isaac had the promises that
[58:24] was the seed of abraham amen
[58:26] the true spiritual seed of abraham and
[58:29] so god narrowed it down to abraham and
[58:31] then god narrowed it down to isaac seed
[58:34] not ishmael's seed and then even in
[58:38] isaac seed he had jacob and esau then he
[58:40] narrows it down again
[58:42] to jacob and not esau and esau had a
[58:45] great nation come out too
[58:47] right so see god was he was just
[58:50] narrowing it down
[58:51] and eventually showing that man's not
[58:53] going to be able to keep the commands
[58:54] so i've got to open it back up to
[58:56] everybody amen
[58:58] i found a man i love abraham he's a
[59:00] godly man
[59:01] uh he's my friend but i'm going to show
[59:04] him in his seat that they can't keep the
[59:05] commands i'm going to show them this
[59:08] and then and then i'm going to open the
[59:09] door of faith to the gentiles i'm going
[59:11] to open up to the whole world
[59:13] i'm going to pull out a bride unto
[59:14] myself from every nation
[59:16] tongue kindred and people amen
[59:19] hallelujah glory now
[59:24] jacob's family went into egypt with 75
[59:27] people
[59:28] and they come out with millions
[59:32] so lydia read exodus can you read that
[59:34] for us
[59:49] amen this is where we get about two
[59:50] million people if just the brothers were
[59:53] six hundred thousand
[59:54] and many of them had wives and many
[59:56] offspring
[59:57] you know if you just double the brothers
[59:59] and everybody's got a wife right there's
[1:00:00] a million
[1:00:01] right a million two hundred right two
[1:00:04] hundred thousand million two hundred
[1:00:05] thousand well then you got little
[1:00:06] kiddies running around there all those
[1:00:07] little babies
[1:00:08] right multiplying all the all over the
[1:00:11] place
[1:00:12] and god remember god blessed them when
[1:00:14] uh pharaoh tried to destroy them
[1:00:16] god blessed them more amen god opened up
[1:00:18] the wounds and wounds even more to bless
[1:00:20] his people make them stronger
[1:00:22] on the way out
[1:00:25] now look at god does he blesses the
[1:00:27] people he brings them out of egypt right
[1:00:30] now once they come out we know we're
[1:00:33] looking at the joshua series
[1:00:35] he takes them into the promised land and
[1:00:37] gives them a prophet joshua
[1:00:39] they go into judges and then kings uh
[1:00:42] by the time we get to the days of
[1:00:44] solomon
[1:00:46] there are many many gentiles so malachi
[1:00:48] can you read that second chronicles 2
[1:00:54] 17.
[1:01:05] amen now look at that church look at
[1:01:08] that
[1:01:08] they came out of egypt with about 2
[1:01:11] million all hebrews
[1:01:13] fast forward 500 years later they have
[1:01:16] uh 153 000 gentiles among them
[1:01:22] right now god had prepared them and said
[1:01:26] you're going to start getting some
[1:01:27] gentiles that was in uh actually that
[1:01:29] was through abraham
[1:01:30] genesis 17 12. i'll read it out of my
[1:01:32] bible here i just
[1:01:34] flip to it real quick and he that is
[1:01:36] eight days old should be circumcised
[1:01:37] among you every man child in your
[1:01:39] generations
[1:01:40] he that is born in his house or bought
[1:01:41] with the money of a stranger
[1:01:43] which is not of thy seed
[1:01:46] so god starts planting these thoughts in
[1:01:48] abraham's mind
[1:01:49] you're going to get some people in your
[1:01:50] house that aren't your seed they're
[1:01:52] strangers they're sojourners
[1:01:54] right and then verse 27 says and all the
[1:01:57] men of his house born in his house and
[1:01:59] bought with money of the stranger
[1:02:00] were circumcised with him so god said
[1:02:02] abraham as long as you circumcise them
[1:02:05] they can stay these gentiles can stay
[1:02:09] praise god and 500 years after that when
[1:02:11] abraha i'm sorry when
[1:02:12] solomon was ruling they're already up to
[1:02:16] 153 000 gentiles
[1:02:19] so we they have to all the gentile men
[1:02:21] have to be circumcised
[1:02:23] and they enjoyed many of the privileges
[1:02:26] of the law
[1:02:26] but they could not be priests
[1:02:30] right because the priest had to be the
[1:02:32] child of abraham
[1:02:33] i'm sorry the seed of levi sorry the
[1:02:35] seed of levi
[1:02:37] that was in uh the scripture that's in
[1:02:40] leviticus 22
[1:02:41] 10. so can you read that please or pull
[1:02:43] it up there i'll read it
[1:02:44] leviticus 22 10. so gentiles could start
[1:02:47] getting close to god remember we talked
[1:02:49] about that with the waters of separation
[1:02:51] they could come to the outer court my
[1:02:53] but they could never get into that holy
[1:02:54] place
[1:02:55] oh church state aren't you glad church
[1:02:57] you don't you're not kept outside
[1:02:59] god invites you and aren't you glad that
[1:03:01] veil was torn amen
[1:03:02] oh honey you are not kept out you are
[1:03:05] invited in amen
[1:03:08] glory they were purposely kept out they
[1:03:10] i'm so glad to live in this hour amen i
[1:03:12] know it's hard i know we got trials
[1:03:14] i know we got you know laodicean age but
[1:03:16] at least we can get into god's presence
[1:03:18] all the way amen
[1:03:20] we don't have to be a certain kind of
[1:03:21] race or a certain kind of family
[1:03:23] as long as we're in god's family we can
[1:03:26] go to the outer court the holy place
[1:03:28] and we can dwell and live in the
[1:03:30] presence of god almighty
[1:03:33] oh thank the lord what a blessing
[1:03:37] leviticus 22 10 there shall no stranger
[1:03:39] eat of the holy thing
[1:03:40] a sojourner of the priests or a hired
[1:03:42] servant shall not eat of the holy thing
[1:03:44] remember brother adam said
[1:03:45] you're feasting on the body word of the
[1:03:48] son of man
[1:03:49] amen you're feasting on the mysteries of
[1:03:52] god brother
[1:03:52] said it's this last day shoe bread that
[1:03:55] we're feeding on
[1:03:56] amen they couldn't eat of it but the
[1:04:00] gentile today
[1:04:01] feasts on the living word of god jesus
[1:04:03] said i am that bread
[1:04:05] he said i'm that living bread that was
[1:04:07] come down from heaven amen
[1:04:09] hallelujah i just read that this week
[1:04:12] john chapter six
[1:04:13] beautiful so gentiles could be a part
[1:04:16] they had to be circumcised they could
[1:04:17] stay in the outer core
[1:04:19] they could get forgiveness of sins but
[1:04:20] they could not get into the holy place
[1:04:23] or the holiest they had to observe the
[1:04:27] sabbath according to deuteronomy 5
[1:04:29] verse 14 they had to keep the passover
[1:04:32] laws
[1:04:32] according to exodus 12 19 and they had
[1:04:35] to rejoice
[1:04:36] on feast days according to deuteronomy
[1:04:38] 16 verses 11 and 14
[1:04:41] and they had to be purified ceremonially
[1:04:45] through the red heifer's waters of
[1:04:48] separation
[1:04:49] in numbers 19 verse 10.
[1:04:53] praise god so as even though it seemed
[1:04:56] like god was
[1:04:57] keeping all the gentiles out he was
[1:04:59] gracious
[1:05:00] and he had a way if they really wanted
[1:05:02] to get in
[1:05:03] they could get into the promises of god
[1:05:06] but they were
[1:05:07] still kept at a distance
[1:05:12] my what a what a thing what a thing
[1:05:16] what a picture that we get god was
[1:05:17] basically saying now you can come pretty
[1:05:19] close
[1:05:19] but you better stop right there church
[1:05:22] our
[1:05:23] our walk with god we should never feel
[1:05:25] like that we should never feel like
[1:05:27] god's saying oh you can't come any
[1:05:28] closer
[1:05:29] we should always hear jesus saying you i
[1:05:31] want you to come closer
[1:05:33] i want to know you more praise god i
[1:05:35] want to i want every door of your heart
[1:05:37] to be open
[1:05:38] right but in the old testament he said
[1:05:40] you can come this far and that's it
[1:05:42] but jesus says come unto me all you that
[1:05:45] weary and are heavy laden
[1:05:46] and i'll give you rest for your souls
[1:05:48] amen even said let the little children
[1:05:51] come unto me
[1:05:52] amen hallelujah and forbid them not
[1:05:55] for such is the kingdom of god the
[1:05:58] little children let them come unto me
[1:05:59] praise god
[1:06:01] now god chose many gentiles
[1:06:04] to use in prominent ways like rahab
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:10] rahab was the uh great great grandmother
[1:06:14] of david we've been looking at her in
[1:06:15] the joshua series right
[1:06:17] she was a harlot but god by grace
[1:06:19] purified her through that outer court
[1:06:22] and then brought her in the very lineage
[1:06:24] of jesus christ
[1:06:26] and out of rahab came boaz boaz married
[1:06:29] ruth
[1:06:30] another gentile right and they
[1:06:33] had obed obed had jesse jesse had david
[1:06:38] right so both rahab and ruth gentiles
[1:06:41] they don't belong into it
[1:06:42] but they're married into it and they're
[1:06:44] brought into the holiest sea lion amen
[1:06:47] showing that the most important seed
[1:06:49] line is the spiritual seed of god
[1:06:51] aren't you glad that your soul can hold
[1:06:54] the very spiritual seed of god
[1:06:56] amen hallelujah when we say royal blood
[1:06:59] flowing through our
[1:07:00] veins we don't mean a natural blood we
[1:07:03] mean spiritual life amen
[1:07:05] the life of god is flowing through our
[1:07:07] soul it's flowing out of our mind
[1:07:09] and it flows out into our praise it
[1:07:11] flows out into our worship
[1:07:13] it shows we are the children of god we
[1:07:15] look just like god amen
[1:07:17] we look just like jesus because his life
[1:07:19] flows through our body
[1:07:21] it flows through all parts of us amen we
[1:07:24] are vessels we're temples
[1:07:25] jesus bought us we are temples of the
[1:07:27] holy ghost and we must not frustrate the
[1:07:30] grace of god
[1:07:31] hallelujah i like uriah the hittite did
[1:07:35] you know he's a gentile
[1:07:37] oh my we know he was slain that david
[1:07:40] could take his wife on
[1:07:41] sadly but before that he was one of
[1:07:45] david's mighty men
[1:07:47] imagine that he wasn't holy enough
[1:07:51] to come into the holy holy place or the
[1:07:53] holy s of holies
[1:07:55] but he was holy enough to defend david
[1:07:58] praise god to fight david's battles amen
[1:08:03] he also became a chief officer or of the
[1:08:06] mighty men as well
[1:08:08] this wasn't some you know weak guy this
[1:08:10] was some strong man
[1:08:11] a gentile who by grace was brought into
[1:08:14] the promises of god
[1:08:15] and few people had loyalty like uriah
[1:08:19] had remember
[1:08:19] david tried to get him drunk and say
[1:08:21] well go see your wife remember that
[1:08:22] he said how can i go uh be with my wife
[1:08:26] when the armies of israel are fighting
[1:08:28] the lord's enemies
[1:08:29] oh he was so loyal amen he had such a
[1:08:32] warrior's heart praise god
[1:08:35] he carried his own death sentence can i
[1:08:38] say like that
[1:08:39] he carried that own death sentence back
[1:08:40] to the general and then
[1:08:42] he sent him into the very heat of the
[1:08:44] battle what a warrior
[1:08:46] and this guy wasn't even a jew right and
[1:08:49] no doubt the lord loved uriah praise god
[1:08:51] he
[1:08:52] exalted him as a general as an example
[1:08:55] to us
[1:08:56] he fought the lord's battles that's what
[1:08:58] we should do fight the lord's battles
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] he had extraordinary devotion to jehovah
[1:09:05] that's what we need
[1:09:07] hallelujah that's how our lives should
[1:09:09] show forth
[1:09:10] extraordinary devotion to jesus christ
[1:09:14] hallelujah thank the lord amen
[1:09:22] that's why i don't feel bad when people
[1:09:23] criticize me for writing books or
[1:09:25] making videos i don't feel bad it's just
[1:09:27] my devotion to jesus
[1:09:29] they might even be jealous i don't know
[1:09:31] they might even be critical i don't know
[1:09:33] why they would be do
[1:09:34] why they'd feel that way but we should
[1:09:35] be so devoted paul said make your i'm
[1:09:38] sorry peter said make your calling
[1:09:39] an election sure in other words do
[1:09:42] something for jesus amen brother

[1:11:30] hallelujah thank god
[1:11:33] now i got about 15 minutes here so let's
[1:11:36] jump in the next section
[1:11:37] that's the first section there i just
[1:11:38] want to show how god
[1:11:40] had a provided way for gentiles if they
[1:11:43] wanted to come in
[1:11:44] and inherit some of these promises and
[1:11:46] these blessings they could do it
[1:11:48] but they had to come god's provided way
[1:11:51] now let's look at prophecy church so uh
[1:11:54] let's get some readers there
[1:11:55] haven you want to read nature you want
[1:11:57] to read all right
[1:11:59] haven uh genesis 12
[1:12:03] verse 3 haven nature galatians 3 verse
[1:12:07] 8.
[1:12:09] so haven genesis 12
[1:12:12] 3 and nature galatians 3 verse 8.
[1:12:19] now i want to look at uh tonight we'll
[1:12:22] probably finish with this thought
[1:12:23] let's look at prophecy that foretold
[1:12:27] that god would open the gospel to the
[1:12:29] gentiles
[1:12:30] now i love this because all these
[1:12:33] scriptures were laying before him
[1:12:34] and it's like it just went over their
[1:12:36] head
[1:12:38] it's like god just put blinders god put
[1:12:40] blinders on the prophets and they
[1:12:42] couldn't see
[1:12:43] that the gentiles were coming in they
[1:12:45] read these
[1:12:46] every week right it's kind of like jesus
[1:12:49] right
[1:12:50] the bible says uh jesus told them over
[1:12:52] and over again the son of man
[1:12:53] is going to go to jerusalem i'm going to
[1:12:55] give my life i got to die i'm going to
[1:12:57] be committed in the hands of sinful men
[1:12:58] but i'll raise on the third day
[1:13:00] and the bible said they didn't
[1:13:02] understand it because god was hiding it
[1:13:04] from them
[1:13:05] oh let me say like this lord if there's
[1:13:06] anything hidden from me please reveal it
[1:13:08] to me amen
[1:13:10] i want to know and i'll lay before you
[1:13:11] in prayer i'll lay before here you
[1:13:14] before you in church i want to know the
[1:13:16] wisdom of god amen
[1:13:18] i want to know god's secrets praise god
[1:13:25] but it was hidden from them so they
[1:13:27] couldn't see it the prophets couldn't
[1:13:29] see it
[1:13:29] the disciples couldn't see it it shows
[1:13:31] god has a time and season for everything
[1:13:34] amen now haven uh genesis 12 3
[1:13:38] the first prophet who foretold of the
[1:13:40] gentiles
[1:13:41] coming in was the god prophet god
[1:13:46] go ahead haven genesis 12 3.
[1:13:56] amen great job haven we're not gonna
[1:13:58] clap first time but we love you
[1:14:00] okay we'll save that one for later uh
[1:14:02] galatians 3 8 nature got that one
[1:14:04] galatians 3 8 starts with
[1:14:05] and the scripture foresee
[1:14:24] great reading nice job wonderful so the
[1:14:27] who prophesied first of the gentiles
[1:14:29] coming into the blessings of god
[1:14:31] it was god himself amen
[1:14:34] i like that paul said god preached
[1:14:37] before the gospel unto abraham so that
[1:14:39] scripture is the gospel
[1:14:41] in thee abraham shall all families of
[1:14:44] the earth be blessed thank god
[1:14:46] i'm a son of abraham amen i see the
[1:14:49] blessings of god on my life i see it
[1:14:51] naturally
[1:14:52] i see it spiritually that's all possible
[1:14:54] because god prophesied that i'd be part
[1:14:56] of it amen
[1:14:58] oh hallelujah thank god amen god
[1:15:01] foretold it praise god
[1:15:03] amen
[1:15:07] now for human prophets foretold of it as
[1:15:11] well
[1:15:11] at least so when i wrote this chapter
[1:15:14] for some reason
[1:15:15] uh i guess the first ones i found i
[1:15:17] found four of them
[1:15:18] right away there's possibly more okay
[1:15:21] there's possibly more
[1:15:22] so the four prophets are david isaiah
[1:15:25] hosea and jeremiah all foretold the
[1:15:28] gospel coming to the gentiles
[1:15:32] david twice says all nations would
[1:15:35] worship the lord oh
[1:15:38] hallelujah psalm 22 verse 27 can you
[1:15:40] pull it out there
[1:15:41] 22 verse 27 chapter 22 verse 27
[1:15:45] psalm i'm sorry psalm 22 27.
[1:15:53] all the ends of the world shall remember
[1:15:55] and turn unto the lord look at that
[1:15:56] they're going to all the ends we'll turn
[1:15:57] to the lord
[1:15:58] and all the kindreds of the nations
[1:15:59] shall worship before thee so the jews
[1:16:01] reading that they'd be like
[1:16:02] that's interesting they just move on
[1:16:05] they wouldn't catch somehow that
[1:16:07] oh god's going to have grace on the
[1:16:08] gentiles
[1:16:10] they would they would think oh well the
[1:16:12] world's going to be full of jews then
[1:16:15] right because we're self-centered people
[1:16:17] right that's just how humans are
[1:16:19] everything revolves around us oh the
[1:16:22] whole world's gonna
[1:16:22] praise the lord there's no gonna be no
[1:16:24] more gentiles thank god
[1:16:26] we're just gonna have jews right but god
[1:16:29] was hiding it
[1:16:30] david was inspired to write it and god
[1:16:33] fulfilled
[1:16:34] it amen now he says it again in psalm 86
[1:16:37] 9
[1:16:37] people psalms 86 9.
[1:16:41] david says it a second time all nations
[1:16:43] whom thou hast made
[1:16:45] shall come and worship before thee o
[1:16:47] lord and glorify
[1:16:49] thy name amen all nations
[1:16:52] so you would think they would have got
[1:16:54] it on this one but they didn't
[1:16:56] they must been thinking natural nations
[1:16:57] right i'm sorry no spiritual nation they
[1:17:00] must be thinking oh spiritual there's
[1:17:01] only one spiritual
[1:17:02] uh nation is israel
[1:17:05] they missed it it just wasn't known
[1:17:07] before until
[1:17:09] paul revealed the mystery oh my
[1:17:13] now let's look at isaiah isaiah has at
[1:17:15] least five references so get your
[1:17:17] fingers ready acacia yeah it'll be
[1:17:19] lightning fingers tonight
[1:17:21] isaiah 9 verse 2 the people that walked
[1:17:24] in darkness have seen a great light
[1:17:26] they that dwell in the land of the
[1:17:28] shadow of death upon them
[1:17:30] hath the light shine oh aren't you glad
[1:17:32] church god called you out of death amen
[1:17:35] god called you out of the night time he
[1:17:38] shined his light on you now you see
[1:17:40] praise god you were in the valley of
[1:17:42] death we're talking about spiritual
[1:17:44] death
[1:17:44] some of us natural death right but many
[1:17:47] of us spiritual death
[1:17:48] and he shined his great light upon us to
[1:17:51] make us see his love and his goodness he
[1:17:53] didn't have to
[1:17:54] but he foretold he'd do it he's rich and
[1:17:56] mercy amen
[1:17:58] we didn't have covenant we'd have
[1:17:59] promises we have no blessings no nothing
[1:18:02] we were in darkness but he shined his
[1:18:03] great light upon us
[1:18:07] oh thank the lord thank you isaiah for
[1:18:11] giving us the word of the lord
[1:18:14] matthew 4 explains that this was
[1:18:17] fulfilled in jesus's ministry to the
[1:18:19] gentiles let's read that
[1:18:20] matthew 4 13. i'm going to take time on
[1:18:23] this because this is so beautiful
[1:18:26] i love how god anointed these new
[1:18:28] testament
[1:18:29] writers to pick up the
[1:18:33] understanding of the old testament
[1:18:36] and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt
[1:18:39] in capernaum which is upon the seacoast
[1:18:40] and the borders of zebulun and neph
[1:18:42] nephilim next verse 14 that it might be
[1:18:46] fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the
[1:18:48] prophet saying
[1:18:50] the land of zebulon land of nephilim by
[1:18:53] the way of the sea beyond jordan
[1:18:55] galileo the gentiles in verse 16 where
[1:18:56] we're going the people which sat in
[1:18:59] darkness
[1:19:00] saw great light and to them which sat in
[1:19:03] the region in shadow of death
[1:19:05] light has sprung up so jesus and his
[1:19:08] disciples went to gentile cities
[1:19:10] and the bible said they saw a great
[1:19:13] light amen
[1:19:14] they didn't see a beautiful man they saw
[1:19:16] a rather homely man jesus a little man
[1:19:19] but his love and his power and his
[1:19:21] healing was the light of god
[1:19:23] it shined brighter than any hollywood
[1:19:25] makeup could could make him shine right
[1:19:28] the love of jesus the power of god the
[1:19:30] humility of god
[1:19:31] and the power of the holy spirit is the
[1:19:33] greatest light you young people can
[1:19:35] shine
[1:19:37] don't worry about being fancy or dressed
[1:19:39] up or rich rich
[1:19:40] fancy clothes or makeup or anything like
[1:19:42] that don't worry about that
[1:19:43] jesus said no beauty that we would
[1:19:45] desire yet he was a great light amen
[1:19:49] remember church when he wasn't holding
[1:19:51] uh healing services
[1:19:52] he was in the synagogue teaching
[1:19:56] see i'm a teacher so i like i like to
[1:19:58] use that one
[1:20:00] because people say oh there's too much
[1:20:01] teaching we need more power well you
[1:20:02] gotta have both really you got it both
[1:20:04] right when jesus was not doing campaigns
[1:20:07] and healing
[1:20:08] the bible said he was in the temple or
[1:20:09] in the synagogues teaching the word of
[1:20:11] god
[1:20:12] that was still light right both are
[1:20:15] light his whole life was like
[1:20:16] everything he did was light amen we
[1:20:19] don't criticize jesus for teaching the
[1:20:20] word of god
[1:20:21] we praise him for it amen because it was
[1:20:23] a plan of god
[1:20:25] okay that's the first one from isaiah
[1:20:28] we'll try to finish isaiah
[1:20:30] now back to isaiah 11 verse 10 isaiah 11
[1:20:34] verse 10.
[1:20:37] oh this is a beautiful scripture right
[1:20:38] here beautiful
[1:20:40] probably my favorite word right now
[1:20:42] right here it's my favorite word right
[1:20:43] here
[1:20:44] and in that day there shall be a root of
[1:20:45] jesse which shall stand for an end sign
[1:20:48] of the people
[1:20:49] to it shall the gentiles seek and his
[1:20:52] rest shall be glorious
[1:20:55] oh thank god amen who's rest
[1:20:59] david's right the seed of david right
[1:21:02] the root of jesse jesus
[1:21:03] jesus's rest would be glorious he said
[1:21:06] come unto me
[1:21:07] all you that labored heavy laden and
[1:21:09] i'll give you rest for your souls
[1:21:11] i'll give you christ in you the hope of
[1:21:13] glory amen
[1:21:16] hallelujah go to isaiah 28
[1:21:19] uh yeah isaiah 28 12. thanks hon
[1:21:23] i forgot how fast you are you're really
[1:21:26] fast way faster than me
[1:21:29] to whom he said this is the rest
[1:21:31] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[1:21:33] rest and this is the refreshing
[1:21:34] yet they would not hear this scripture
[1:21:36] was fulfilled on the day of pentecost
[1:21:38] according to paul
[1:21:42] see the gentiles will have a glorious
[1:21:44] rest
[1:21:46] resting from their own labors right and
[1:21:49] working and laboring by the power
[1:21:52] of the holy ghost amen
[1:21:56] that's a testimony of my life any good
[1:21:57] that comes out of my life
[1:21:59] it was the laboring of the holy ghost
[1:22:01] right we're resting on him
[1:22:03] and as we surrender we just let christ
[1:22:06] work through us
[1:22:07] and it's jesus working through us we're
[1:22:09] resting in him
[1:22:10] but we're yielding our bodies and minds
[1:22:13] to his spirit
[1:22:14] and that's what's causing us to labor is
[1:22:16] the grace of god
[1:22:18] but our souls are resting on the promise
[1:22:20] of god
[1:22:21] oh thank the lord amen his rest is
[1:22:24] glorious
[1:22:26] our souls rest our souls are not
[1:22:29] warring and are my saved am i going to
[1:22:31] heaven am i going am i the bride or not
[1:22:33] our souls are not fighting our souls
[1:22:36] aren't rest
[1:22:37] our nature is at rest where's nature
[1:22:39] she's out there
[1:22:40] our nature is at rest our character is
[1:22:43] at rest praise god
[1:22:45] but we've got to yield to that spirit so
[1:22:47] we can labor and do god's will
[1:22:49] while we're on this earth amen
[1:22:52] and paul said i was giving and i was
[1:22:54] giving myself to be spent for you he
[1:22:56] said so paul's soul was that
[1:23:00] rest but his mind and his body were
[1:23:02] constantly laboring for the people
[1:23:04] he was spending his energy for the
[1:23:06] people of god
[1:23:07] that's what we should do amen
[1:23:14] so we see the gentiles rest will be
[1:23:16] glorious that's the baptism of the holy
[1:23:18] ghost
[1:23:21] jesus is the root of jesse
[1:23:24] third reference isaiah 42 isaiah 42
[1:23:28] or read verse 1 i imagine because it's a
[1:23:30] long it's a long passage
[1:23:34] i'm always worried about that time
[1:23:37] i should say always sometimes isaiah 42
[1:23:39] 1
[1:23:40] behold my servant whom i uphold mine
[1:23:42] elect in whom my soul delighteth i have
[1:23:44] put my spirit upon him
[1:23:46] he shall bring forth judgment to the
[1:23:49] gentiles
[1:23:52] now go to matthew 12 please matthew 12
[1:23:56] 14.
[1:23:59] so this scripture was fulfilled also
[1:24:03] matthew 12 14 through 21. i'm just going
[1:24:06] to take a brief look here in my
[1:24:08] my bibles my scriptures
[1:24:18] verse 15 but when jesus knew it he
[1:24:20] withdrew himself from dense and great
[1:24:21] multitudes fouled him and he healed them
[1:24:23] all
[1:24:24] and charged him that they should not
[1:24:25] make him known that it might be
[1:24:26] fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:24:28] isaiah the prophet saying behold my
[1:24:30] servant whom i have chosen my beloved
[1:24:33] in whom my soul as well please i'll put
[1:24:36] my spirit upon him
[1:24:37] and he shall show judgment to the
[1:24:39] gentiles amen
[1:24:41] hallelujah amen
[1:24:44] all these miracles all these people
[1:24:46] jesus healed it was showing god's
[1:24:48] judgment to the gentiles right that god
[1:24:51] could judge
[1:24:52] sin right that god had already judged
[1:24:54] sin amen he's going to judge it through
[1:24:55] the blood of jesus praise god
[1:24:57] and provide healing for sin amen
[1:25:03] now go down to verse 21
[1:25:08] and in his name shall the gentiles trust
[1:25:12] so now you have all these scriptures
[1:25:13] showing that everything jesus did it was
[1:25:15] also
[1:25:16] shining great light it was sent to the
[1:25:17] jews first we'll get to that lord
[1:25:19] willing next week
[1:25:20] but it also showed great light to the
[1:25:22] gentiles
[1:25:23] and the gentiles you and i should trust
[1:25:25] in jesus christ
[1:25:27] right that great light that he shined
[1:25:30] we trust in his light now i'm thinking
[1:25:32] of a scripture here before i forget
[1:25:33] uh let me turn to it real quick
[1:25:39] yeah there it is okay i don't want to
[1:25:40] miss this i kind of want to close with
[1:25:41] this
[1:25:43] all right uh isaiah 49 verse 6. you're
[1:25:47] doing a great job tonight in case you
[1:25:48] always do but i'm going to make sure i
[1:25:50] tell you that

[1:25:57] just be my servant to raise up the
[1:25:59] tribes of jacob and to restore the
[1:26:00] friends of israel
[1:26:01] i will also give thee for a light to the
[1:26:03] gentiles
[1:26:04] that thou mayest be my salvation unto
[1:26:07] the
[1:26:08] ends of the earth paul and barnabas
[1:26:10] quote this scripture
[1:26:13] in acts 13 47. now can you hop over

[1:26:23] to backspace i make all these mistakes
[1:26:26] you're good acacia you're pretty good
[1:26:28] for so hat the lord commanded us saying
[1:26:29] i have set thee to be a light for the
[1:26:31] gentiles
[1:26:32] that thou should especially salvation
[1:26:33] unto the ends of the earth
[1:26:35] paul's saying in other words paul's
[1:26:36] saying i'm fulfilling this scripture
[1:26:39] today this scripture is fulfilled i am a
[1:26:42] light to the gentiles can i say like
[1:26:44] this
[1:26:44] you are a light to the gentiles in this
[1:26:46] age amen
[1:26:48] you are light praise god you might
[1:26:49] remember remember john was a shining
[1:26:51] bright light for a season
[1:26:53] and they were willing to rejoice in his
[1:26:54] light for a season i'm thankful church
[1:26:57] that we can rejoice in brother branham's
[1:26:59] light for a season amen
[1:27:01] because his light was jesus he's
[1:27:03] pointing us to there's only one life
[1:27:05] that's jesus christ he's the light of
[1:27:06] the world amen
[1:27:08] hallelujah ah that's beautiful
[1:27:16] finally the last isaiah scripture
[1:27:20] isaiah 60 verse 3.
[1:27:23] oh thank you lord
[1:27:28] so glad i'm walking in the light as he's
[1:27:30] in the light church we could have been
[1:27:32] walking in darkness
[1:27:33] i was walking in darkness but i've seen
[1:27:35] a great light
[1:27:38] oh thank you jesus hallelujah see i
[1:27:41] gotta laugh because if i don't laugh i'm
[1:27:42] gonna start crying
[1:27:44] right you start if you really if you
[1:27:46] really think of the depths
[1:27:47] i got to have some emotional outlet
[1:27:49] right
[1:27:51] if the bible said it's joy unspeakable
[1:27:53] and full of glory we got to have some
[1:27:55] outlet for this joy praise god
[1:27:58] and a merry heart make us good medicine
[1:28:00] right is that right virtue
[1:28:02] a happy hearts medicine to everybody
[1:28:04] else when you smile
[1:28:05] when you love the lord and you sing and
[1:28:07] worship the lord it's medicine to
[1:28:09] anybody
[1:28:10] that has a real sincere heart praise god
[1:28:12] the joy of the lord
[1:28:14] is medicine
[1:28:20] that's usually what happens i usually
[1:28:21] laugh during the sermon because i'm so
[1:28:22] happy i usually not always
[1:28:24] and then i'll cry at the end because i'm
[1:28:25] finally just like i gotta get it out
[1:28:28] oh my goodness gracious i love jesus all
[1:28:31] i can say is thank you jesus for saving
[1:28:33] my soul praise god
[1:28:34] i was a wretch but he reached out his
[1:28:36] hand for me isaiah 60 verse 3
[1:28:39] and the gentiles shall come to thy light
[1:28:42] and the kings
[1:28:43] to the brightness of thy rising for the
[1:28:45] prophets
[1:28:47] oh there's no way the gentiles ah now
[1:28:50] that's a spiritual meaning
[1:28:52] or maybe they just maybe just they just
[1:28:54] read over it and it just didn't even
[1:28:55] register because god blended their
[1:28:57] spiritual eyes
[1:28:58] but the bible said this was not known
[1:29:01] that god was going to say look at this
[1:29:02] over 2000 almost 2000 years now right
[1:29:05] almost 2 thousand years we're almost at
[1:29:08] 2000 years because it was 80 30.
[1:29:10] wow we're so close my goodness
[1:29:14] we're so close but they couldn't see it
[1:29:17] until paul
[1:29:18] pointed out in the word and it was time
[1:29:20] to be revealed god has a time and season
[1:29:22] for forever
[1:29:23] aren't you glad god no matter what stage
[1:29:25] of life you're in god has something
[1:29:26] special for that season
[1:29:28] every season has something special right
[1:29:31] who doesn't like you like yeah you like
[1:29:32] eating snow you children i've seen all
[1:29:34] you eat snow out there
[1:29:36] who doesn't like win i mean there's good
[1:29:38] things about winter
[1:29:40] right there's something good about every
[1:29:42] season
[1:29:43] do you jump in leaves girls do you jump
[1:29:45] in leaves when it's when the leaves are
[1:29:46] falling
[1:29:47] yeah look at that thumbs up so fall has
[1:29:50] great things
[1:29:51] summer you like going swimming you like
[1:29:52] spraying yourself with the hose i know
[1:29:54] my girls do
[1:29:55] they always spray they'll spray
[1:29:56] themselves with a hose
[1:29:59] you can and this is spring we love
[1:30:01] spring we love the weather there's
[1:30:02] something beautiful in every season
[1:30:04] praise god
[1:30:05] but brother man tells us the most
[1:30:06] beautiful one is death autumn
[1:30:09] because that's when they get those
[1:30:10] beautiful colors
[1:30:12] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[1:30:14] death of his saints
[1:30:17] that's gonna be that sermon i'm gonna
[1:30:18] preach lord willing here pretty soon the
[1:30:20] best
[1:30:20] is always yet to come now that's a
[1:30:23] condition though
[1:30:25] if you honor the lord the best is yet to
[1:30:27] come
[1:30:29] because people can start out right they
[1:30:31] can start running the race but then they
[1:30:32] can
[1:30:32] trot and underfoot the son of god afresh
[1:30:36] and they can lose their salvation so
[1:30:38] it's all on conditions
[1:30:43] uh acts 26 23 repeats this scripture
[1:30:48] uh isaiah 60 verse 3. so acts 23 or 26
[1:30:51] 3. so i'm sorry 26 23 mercy i'm trying
[1:30:53] to slow down
[1:30:55] acts 26 23
[1:30:59] that christ should suffer and that he
[1:31:01] should be the first that should rise
[1:31:02] from the dead
[1:31:03] and show light unto the people and to
[1:31:06] the gentiles
[1:31:07] praise god
[1:31:12] let's stand uh but keep your bibles out
[1:31:15] musicians you can come keep your bibles
[1:31:16] out
[1:31:17] go to john 5 if you got your bibles
[1:31:29] how many want to manifest the light of
[1:31:30] god
[1:31:32] praise the lord how many want to be a
[1:31:34] light to the gentiles in your life
[1:31:37] now we want to be lights to jews and
[1:31:38] gentiles right but we don't not maybe
[1:31:40] around as many jews
[1:31:42] but we want to be a light to the
[1:31:43] gentiles we want to be a light to the
[1:31:45] jews
[1:31:45] well how do you be a light the same way
[1:31:47] jesus was a light
[1:31:50] john 5 19. can you pull that up there
[1:31:53] john 5 19.
[1:31:54] i was reading this this week and i was
[1:31:55] like oh what a blessing to read over
[1:31:58] this i
[1:31:58] you know we just forget about it but
[1:32:00] look what jesus said verily verily i say
[1:32:02] to you the son can do nothing of himself
[1:32:05] but what he sees the father do
[1:32:09] for whatsoever things he doeth these
[1:32:10] also the sun likewise
[1:32:12] church can't you say amen to that that
[1:32:13] we can do nothing of ourselves
[1:32:15] jesus christ could not do anything of
[1:32:18] him
[1:32:18] his own self his own human mind
[1:32:22] right he had to wait to the father
[1:32:24] showed him
[1:32:25] and then he acted upon what the father
[1:32:27] showed him and then
[1:32:28] his works were blessed in other words
[1:32:32] he had to follow the leading of the holy
[1:32:34] spirit
[1:32:35] if any good was going to come out of his
[1:32:38] life
[1:32:40] hope that encourages you but go to verse
[1:32:41] 30 as well
[1:32:47] let's put ourselves in there bride of
[1:32:48] christ fellowship can do nothing of
[1:32:50] ourselves
[1:32:51] but when we're yielded to the holy
[1:32:53] spirit then god can do something in our
[1:32:55] lives
[1:32:56] look at verse 30 i can of mine own self
[1:32:59] do
[1:33:00] nothing see preachers say you know i'm
[1:33:03] not talking about messages but there
[1:33:04] could be
[1:33:05] they're trying to say oh you you're so
[1:33:07] great you're so great you're so great
[1:33:08] you know
[1:33:09] you're handsome right you're beautiful
[1:33:10] you're they're trying to build you up
[1:33:12] but jesus
[1:33:14] says i can't do anything and he wasn't
[1:33:17] handsome
[1:33:19] so no matter how much he claimed it he
[1:33:20] was never going to be handsome right
[1:33:22] oh my goodness
[1:33:26] the only way we'll ever do anything is
[1:33:28] yielding to the holy spirit obeying what
[1:33:30] god
[1:33:31] tells us to do and thankfully church all
[1:33:34] we gotta do is open up this book
[1:33:36] and ten times out of ten we're gonna
[1:33:37] hear god's voice telling us what to do
[1:33:41] like i like that preacher he said you
[1:33:42] wanna hear god's voice
[1:33:44] he said uh he said you wanna hear god's
[1:33:46] audible voice
[1:33:47] just open up his bible start reading it
[1:33:49] out loud
[1:33:50] you'll hear god's voice right the voice
[1:33:53] of his word
[1:33:56] you want to get a uh you want to hear
[1:33:57] hear god speak to you
[1:33:59] he said read it out loud or have the
[1:34:01] have the computer play the bible out
[1:34:03] loud you hear god's voice
[1:34:05] in other words you hear his mind may not
[1:34:08] hear the literal voice but you hear
[1:34:09] the mind of christ because it's found
[1:34:12] right here in the word
[1:34:13] let's stand here are you encouraged
