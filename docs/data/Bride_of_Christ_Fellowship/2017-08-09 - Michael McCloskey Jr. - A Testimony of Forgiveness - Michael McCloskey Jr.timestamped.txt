[0:31] my name is Michael John McCluskey jr. 32
[0:35] years old I was raised by a loving
[0:38] mother and loving grandfather and father
[0:40] I knew his young man I always wanted to
[0:45] be a tradesman and was raised around a
[0:49] machinist and a welder
[0:55] it was 1994 I was I was at a Vacation
[0:59] Bible study and with some friends of
[1:03] mine from elementary school and gave
[1:06] myself to the Lord for the first time
[1:08] got down on my knees and said the
[1:10] sinner's prayer with a pastor there and
[1:13] just had a strong poll to know more
[1:17] about the Lord at that point
[1:25] through high school I worked
[1:26] arm jobs and at a high school I got my
[1:30] first break doing masonry graduated
[1:34] early and went into the trades and got a
[1:36] break for getting the union
[1:40] apprenticeship so I did a brief trial
[1:43] with the apprenticeship and ended up
[1:45] testing into journeyman Mason and Werth
[1:50] journeyman Mason for quite a few years I
[1:54] think about six years but in the
[1:56] beginning of that you know I had a high
[1:57] school I was always weight training and
[2:00] kind of catch up with my brother and you
[2:04] know being 10 years younger I was
[2:05] working that much harder
[2:08] you know they catch up and I could see
[2:10] God's hand on every part of my life even
[2:14] the weight training you know allowed me
[2:17] to train so hard in the gym five seven
[2:21] days a week
[2:23] dragging a trash can around with me
[2:25] while I would train building me up to
[2:28] 260 pounds where I would stop a
[2:31] 40-caliber bullet 240 green hollow-point
[2:35] at 15 feet the surgeon said within with
[2:40] an exit wound out of the front of my
[2:43] abdominal wall there would have been
[2:45] absolutely no chance of life due to the
[2:48] severe blood loss
[2:55] and let's see two
[2:59] and seven I started doing security work
[3:03] and was running my own company at the
[3:05] age of seventeen I you know started my
[3:07] own business on the side 18 years old
[3:09] was doing side jobs of construction and
[3:12] I was had an opportunity to start
[3:19] working for a facility remodeling it
[3:21] after work so I was working double
[3:23] shifts and and still weight training and
[3:25] I fought in a tough man contest actually
[3:30] these things of that nature you know
[3:33] growing up and competitive family type
[3:36] of scenario you know and so I started
[3:42] doing the nighttime security and got
[3:46] into a situation where work started
[3:49] getting slow where it pretty much took a
[3:51] crash and they wanted to hire me on
[3:54] full-time at this facility I had built
[3:57] doing security and building maintenance
[4:00] so I was real torn in between it was
[4:05] kind of something just kept telling me
[4:07] don't do it don't don't go down that
[4:11] road and I couldn't figure out what it
[4:13] was
[4:13] so I actually sat down for the first
[4:16] time in my life and rode out pros and
[4:19] cons of what was telling me you know not
[4:22] to do this now I had forgotten a few
[4:26] months prior to that that I had had a
[4:30] dream that I was shot up of a black
[4:33] harley-davidson Softail motorcycle that
[4:35] I hadn't even owned yet and later on
[4:39] after forgetting his dream I had
[4:40] purchased this motorcycle and actually
[4:46] ended up moving into a neighborhood a
[4:48] fancier neighborhood you know and took
[4:51] my business with me and my work trucks
[4:53] and was living in this neighborhood for
[4:56] a while and was working the night doing
[5:01] security and working my day job also run
[5:04] inside jobs so just running fit and
[5:06] running myself then
[5:13] one day I was working
[5:15] diligent you know I was running all over
[5:17] the place and someone I didn't know
[5:19] where just said Mike what's going to
[5:21] happen if someone pulls a gun on you and
[5:24] I said it would take a bullet to slow me
[5:26] down like it just fell out of my mouth
[5:29] it is something that I had heard in my
[5:31] past and when I said it I thought to
[5:35] myself why did I even say that but I
[5:38] just kept on with my work it wasn't but
[5:44] a short time after that I was actually
[5:47] shot in the back off of a
[5:48] harley-davidson Softail black just like
[5:52] the dream I didn't know that yet
[6:13] the most important thing about this is
[6:16] the moment when I was shot when that
[6:20] bullet hit me I knew instantly that I
[6:24] was paralyzed and when I fell to the
[6:26] ground and I was looking around me I
[6:29] knew I had already been there before it
[6:33] was such a moment that I was already
[6:38] there I've already been here I'm looking
[6:41] at the police officers around me
[6:42] pointing guns at me still even though my
[6:44] hands are up and I knew it I already had
[6:48] been there and didn't know how I didn't
[6:52] know where the man that was my assistant
[6:54] manager I had just left work when this
[6:57] had happened my assistant manager pulls
[7:00] up and sees me on the way to my house
[7:03] sees me laying on the ground shot he
[7:07] gets out of his car he runs up to me and
[7:09] I was in the most excruciating pain I've
[7:12] ever felt in my life I would never want
[7:15] anyone to feel this pain and when he
[7:18] approached me there was a what I
[7:20] understand now to be an anointing on
[7:21] this man he was glowing like an angel
[7:24] very bright glow around him it took my
[7:28] pain from me man's name is Clint sharp I
[7:31] couldn't speak to him he I couldn't hear
[7:34] what he was saying and I had no pain but
[7:37] comfort as this glow around him started
[7:41] to recede started to go away the pain
[7:44] came right back
[7:45] hit me strong right away and I told him
[7:51] take off your shirt pack my wound get
[7:54] the bike off of my leg the gasoline is
[7:57] going to burn me up call 9-1-1 that was
[8:01] the unit that was actually dispatched
[8:03] that came out and got me off the road
[8:06] and took me to the hospital and I had
[8:09] laid on the ground for an hour and 45
[8:11] minutes waiting for that help to come
[8:19] I spent 40 days in tweedle hospital they
[8:23] saved my life the surgeon came out and
[8:26] told my mother that he had never seen a
[8:29] man lose that much blood and still have
[8:32] a heartbeat and he said it was a tear in
[8:35] his eye the surgeon that had been you
[8:37] know with emergency surgeries for over
[8:41] 30 years and like I said I spent about
[8:44] 40 days in the hospital that was a very
[8:47] painful experience if I could warn
[8:50] anybody about the experience of taking a
[8:54] bullet I I would strongly advise them
[8:59] that you would never want to feel pain
[9:00] like that or the repercussions of pain
[9:03] like that they did exploratory surgery
[9:06] on my body pulling out all my organs
[9:09] cutting out hemorrhage muscle and meat
[9:12] my abdominal wall throwing most of that
[9:14] stuff away sewing me ball back up I
[9:18] remember I had a dream while I was in an
[9:24] ICU that I was in hell and that I was
[9:28] actually fighting demons and fighting my
[9:31] way through these different levels of
[9:32] hell and I got to a point to her I was
[9:36] surrounded by these demons and I had
[9:40] thought the only what can I do what can
[9:43] I do in this situation and I remembered
[9:46] our Lord Jesus Christ and I got down on
[9:49] one knee and I stuck my sword in the
[9:51] ground and I called out and said Lord
[9:54] Jesus Christ please save me and a
[9:57] lightning bolt struck me and it was like
[10:00] it I it took me right out of that place
[10:02] and it was the brightest white when this
[10:04] lightning bolt hit it was the brightest
[10:06] white I've ever seen ever
[10:08] it was so such a pure white light and I
[10:13] woke up out of an induced a coma from
[10:15] this and remember hearing my heart
[10:17] monitors and I looked down and I could
[10:20] see all my organs
[10:21] I was stapled shut but you I was so
[10:25] swollen you could see everything
[10:27] everything in me you could see my heart
[10:29] you could see my my intestinal you know
[10:31] intestines in me
[10:33] very traumatic experience very humbling
[10:38] experience to go from a very large man
[10:42] always in control of his situation no
[10:45] fear
[10:46] prideful you know just live in that past
[10:51] life and to be humbled that quickly was
[10:55] a very traumatic experience they set out
[11:00] I see you that I was saying induced a
[11:05] coma they said I was saying God told me
[11:08] not to have any hatred in your heart
[11:11] towards this police officer I don't
[11:14] recall saying this the first couple
[11:15] times but after coming you know into a
[11:18] step-down unit they had told me what I
[11:21] said and I continued to repeat that and
[11:24] tell everybody that came to visit me it
[11:25] was very important to me that they
[11:29] didn't have any hatred towards this man
[11:31] being the people that were working with
[11:34] me two people that I knew that there
[11:37] wasn't any retaliation that something I
[11:40] the Lord had told me I believe that this
[11:43] was somehow on me you know something I
[11:46] had done or said or whatever it be I
[11:48] didn't know any of that at that time but
[11:51] something was telling me that that
[11:55] everybody just needed to be peaceful
[11:57] about the situation and I had a preacher
[12:01] come to to my hospital room and really
[12:05] put some words of encouragement in me
[12:07] and my my family they just that they
[12:10] kept telling me in the hospital you know
[12:12] you could still die and your pancreas
[12:14] you know could put out enzymes and kill
[12:17] you and all this and I would just say
[12:19] when y'all let me out of here when do I
[12:21] get to go home I'm okay I'm going to be
[12:24] fine ever you know Lord's protecting me
[12:27] I'm gonna be all right
[12:34] it was not too long
[12:37] that I was released it was around 40
[12:39] days I believe I was released and I went
[12:44] home to my mother's house you know I had
[12:46] lost my residency where I was living and
[12:49] it was important I got out of that area
[12:53] due to the fact that just the
[12:56] neighborhood I had moved into they
[12:58] didn't really they didn't really like
[12:59] the blue-collar work trucks and
[13:01] everything that I had going on so I
[13:03] decided to get out of that neighborhood
[13:04] and moved back in with my mother and I
[13:07] was in my bedroom and it hit me that I
[13:13] had had that dream
[13:14] I remembered the dream 100% and I
[13:19] realized that when I was laying on the
[13:21] ground shot I was actually remembering
[13:23] the dream the Lord had tried to sharpen
[13:26] me of my future I had forgot that dream
[13:29] when I thought I had to move into that
[13:31] neighborhood because all my options you
[13:33] know with work had gone out and I moved
[13:36] in with the gentleman that owned the
[13:37] home there I couldn't figure out why I
[13:42] was so torn what what inside of me and
[13:45] my mind kept saying do not go there and
[13:49] I didn't listen to that and I started
[13:52] getting a full picture of what took
[13:55] place there and that was a very powerful
[13:58] moment for me
[14:05] not too long after that I went
[14:07] this facility a lot of people kept
[14:10] saying I'll come back you know we friend
[14:12] of mine had an annual work cut out
[14:15] get-together there so I went back there
[14:18] and I was outside the back of the
[14:21] building about 40 yards away from the
[14:23] back door in four inches of snow cold
[14:27] outside talking to the man that saved my
[14:30] life and he had watched a documentary
[14:32] about the Rosetta Stone and how it
[14:35] predated Christ and he was telling me
[14:38] that that that couldn't be real but you
[14:41] know the story of Christ could be real
[14:43] because this predated that and and I
[14:44] could was trying to get a word in and I
[14:46] couldn't and I had a tears coming out of
[14:50] my eyes and I just closed my eyes and I
[14:52] started saying don't worry Michael God
[14:55] loves you don't worry Michael God loves
[14:58] you don't worry Michael God loves you
[15:01] and the door on the back of the building
[15:04] open and a lady dressed as an angel
[15:07] happened to be around that time walk
[15:10] straight out to me and asked me what's
[15:13] your name and I said my name is Michael
[15:15] she said what happened to you and I said
[15:17] I was shot off of my Harley Davidson for
[15:22] going seven miles an hour over the speed
[15:24] limit and she said that's terrible can I
[15:27] give you a hug and I said I would love a
[15:29] hug right now and I hugged her and she
[15:32] whispered in my ear don't worry Michael
[15:34] God loves you and as I looked over to
[15:39] Clint to tell Clinton what she had said
[15:43] he was in Koval shion's
[15:45] he couldn't breathe I thought he was
[15:49] having a heart attack or was going into
[15:54] a seizure that has appeared after I got
[15:59] him to the baptism Lord got him to the
[16:01] baptism I reran that story through and
[16:03] he stopped me and he said I got to tell
[16:05] you something this is seven and a half
[16:07] years later he said the reason that I
[16:11] went into what seems like a full seizure
[16:15] was that when that lady dressed as an
[16:19] angel whispered
[16:20] to your ear there was a glow around you
[16:24] guys which I understand now to be a very
[16:27] strong anointing and the reason you ran
[16:29] in and out of the building was he was
[16:30] trying to see where he seen that light
[16:32] because after she had departed walked
[16:35] back into the building he ran in and
[16:39] looked at her and I was running back out
[16:40] looking at me and he said it was all
[16:43] dark around us there was there was no
[16:44] light there was it wasn't he thought
[16:47] something this perception was off or
[16:49] something you know and then which I
[16:51] understand knowledge and I knew at that
[16:53] moment it was a very supernatural moment
[16:57] and I just stands out to me you know
[17:03] through that bat doesn't mean he come
[17:05] out and told me what happened there that
[17:08] was another profound moment it was it
[17:13] was the second moment that I had in a
[17:16] very short time that was making me look
[17:21] around and touch things and pinch myself
[17:23] to see if I was awake if this was a
[17:25] mirage like and then I knew how serious
[17:29] and how real the spiritual realm was
[17:32] around us it was a quite quite a moment
[17:37] for me
[17:44] I was in and out of
[17:47] different churches I was baptized wrong
[17:49] I was baptized in the name of the Father
[17:52] Son Holy Ghost didn't even know it went
[17:57] to a few was going to prayer services
[17:59] ended up you know just seeing red flags
[18:04] you know didn't really know much about
[18:08] denomination had some had some tough
[18:11] times my my grandfather died of cancer
[18:14] and on his deathbed said it was he felt
[18:18] like it was from what happened to me
[18:20] just just took the life right out of him
[18:23] and it wasn't too long much after I was
[18:26] shot he come down with the cancer and
[18:28] had passed away and it was not but a few
[18:35] years ago I was taking my father to
[18:39] church the evangelical church and trying
[18:43] to get him to come to the Lord with me
[18:45] and I took him to a service and it
[18:49] wasn't it wasn't really sure what he
[18:51] thought so I was invited him do another
[18:53] one he said well I'd like to get lunch
[18:54] with you Saturday so we went out to
[18:56] lunch and we're having a real good time
[18:58] having some good talks and he was we
[19:02] were kind of reflecting over things over
[19:04] the life and all the good moments and it
[19:07] was just a real good day and before we
[19:11] left that launch some people walked in
[19:14] that knew me from my incident and
[19:16] started bringing up the whole scenario
[19:19] about the police officer and got my
[19:22] father really fired up really upset and
[19:25] many times I forgive I tell my father I
[19:28] forgive this man I forgive him I forgive
[19:30] him I forgive this man I forgive him and
[19:32] he said I could never forgive him Ike
[19:34] for now because it does hurt him so bad
[19:36] to see his son and so much pain to be
[19:40] his legs taken from all of these
[19:44] situations were were really tough
[19:46] between us I just wanted him to know I'm
[19:51] alright I'm a strong I'm strong guy
[19:53] Lord's made me that way everything's
[19:55] going to be all right I forgive this man
[19:58] and he said
[20:00] never forgive them and I'm your father
[20:03] and you to listen me and I said the Lord
[20:04] Jesus Christ is my father and he had
[20:10] went home not agreeing to go to church
[20:13] Sunday the next morning and then he text
[20:16] me and said I'll be at your house in the
[20:19] morning to go to church I said that'd be
[20:23] great father and now he never showed up
[20:25] and ended up shooting himself committing
[20:28] suicide and it was just a real tough
[20:32] moment I kind of got the atmosphere at
[20:37] that church was was a real standoffish
[20:40] and I just kind of went back to home
[20:44] every time I would go to one of these
[20:46] you know one of these assemblies and
[20:47] just see things that were red flags to
[20:51] me I would just go back to my home just
[20:53] mean the dog back to me in the dog back
[20:56] to me in the dog
[21:02] and one day I was in my house just
[21:06] thinking about everything that had
[21:08] happened you know I'm down to me and my
[21:10] mother and my friends were burning
[21:16] bridges with me even though worldly
[21:18] friends I was trying to help them out
[21:19] and like my situation with my parents
[21:25] were kind of getting abrasive you know
[21:27] and I was just I just cried out to the
[21:30] Lord in tears just yelling in my house
[21:34] that I needed the truth I needed the
[21:36] church and I needed now I can't wait no
[21:39] longer Lord and my phone had went off
[21:42] and a really good brother that I know
[21:46] that I've known for years contacted me
[21:50] and he had said brother the Lord has
[21:55] been telling me all day long to get a
[21:59] hold of you and to send my cousin over
[22:03] for a Bible study this man his name's
[22:05] Adam down the line and I said brother
[22:08] you sending he said you sure I said send
[22:10] him so a day went by and he said well
[22:13] I'm not able to make it I said send him
[22:15] he said are you sure
[22:16] I said I'm positive I want to know I'm
[22:18] going to heaven I don't want a shadow of
[22:20] doubt I want to know so he says okay
[22:24] I'll send him so he sends assignment
[22:26] over I learned this name Simon so he
[22:28] comes and comes up to my door you know
[22:30] and I look out and I'm like aw he's got
[22:33] a work van and I hope the door and I see
[22:34] him like he's a tradesman you got tape
[22:36] measure on you know so I'm like imma
[22:38] give him the Christian test I come in
[22:39] for a hug hey give me a hug I said
[22:41] alright this is looking good so he comes
[22:43] in and he goes into my house and he he
[22:46] looked out my window and he's seen my
[22:48] business sign said MCW certified welding
[22:52] and he looked at me and he said you're a
[22:54] welder and I said yes and he goes I'm a
[22:57] welder and right then I thought about
[23:00] Jesus and Joseph and carpentry and I
[23:03] thought pray to God he sent me a
[23:06] tradesman I'd do it right then I knew I
[23:09] was having one of those moments that I
[23:12] had had before you know
[23:14] just knew that I just couldn't quit
[23:17] thinking about that prayer that I had
[23:20] said Lord I need the truth and you know
[23:24] this it was right when I was about to
[23:28] make my own move I picked another church
[23:32] and I was like well I'm going to go here
[23:33] and and search it out and see if it
[23:37] feels right and before I could make that
[23:39] move
[23:40] Simon was standing on my porch and that
[23:44] was that really stood out to me that was
[23:46] just I knew it was a divine moment right
[23:50] there and thanks to a broken clock we
[23:54] did a seven-hour Bible study praise the
[23:57] Lord it was good and that was eleven
[24:01] eleven twenty sixteen and eleven
[24:04] thirteen twenty sixteen I was baptized
[24:07] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ for the
[24:10] mission of my sins so I shall receive
[24:12] the gift of the Holy Spirit and that was
[24:15] an amazing moment I had was baptized I
[24:18] come up out of the water and they laid
[24:20] hands on me and I I felt for the most
[24:24] part pretty normal things were like okay
[24:26] this is a really special moment and help
[24:30] get me out of the water and I started
[24:32] wheeling away and pastor Cameron Smith
[24:35] said get hands on him right now and they
[24:38] rushed over to me and they all laid
[24:40] hands on me getting started praying and
[24:42] I believe my hands went up like this and
[24:45] it felt like someone kicked the wind out
[24:49] of me like right in the stomach right my
[24:51] solar plex and I just went
[24:54] and I can't describe what happened there
[24:58] I think the Lord only knows what
[24:59] happened there but it was a very defined
[25:03] moment again I just I knew that that was
[25:07] a real baptism a big difference from
[25:11] being baptized falsely twice in the past
[25:14] you know and after that I'd started
[25:18] witnessing to people I mean I I don't
[25:21] think I could keep my battery on my
[25:23] phone going I was just calling everybody
[25:26] reaching out to everybody and got a got
[25:30] the gospel to a few people
[25:37] I heard a sermon from a brother preacher
[25:42] sandy beach and he preached on
[25:45] circumcision of the heart from the flesh
[25:48] and he hid repentance real good the true
[25:52] definition of repentance and I had no
[25:55] idea I didn't know it was that deep and
[25:58] that Monday morning after that service
[26:01] that Monday morning I made a call to the
[26:04] prosecuting attorney's office and
[26:06] requested for a meeting and he didn't
[26:10] call me back the next day so I called
[26:11] him again he said oh well I was thinking
[26:14] what kind of time frame you thinking and
[26:16] I said immediately I need to get down to
[26:18] talk to you so he made an appointment
[26:20] for the following week not on Wednesday
[26:23] and I went down there and talked to him
[26:26] and told him that I wanted to forgive
[26:27] this police officer and I told him what
[26:30] it all happened with my grandfather and
[26:32] my father and we were both crying and I
[26:38] told him a little bit about serpentine I
[26:42] said you know it kind of comes back to
[26:46] the the incident you know in a detail
[26:49] but I said our seed line comes from Cain
[26:56] and he said Abel write back to me right
[26:59] then and and I said oh you know
[27:01] something about this and he goes Mike
[27:04] I've been praying for you ever since you
[27:06] were shot that you're going to come down
[27:08] here and forgive this man he's a good
[27:11] Christian this is the federal prosecutor
[27:14] and so it worked out where he set it up
[27:18] I went down there for a little like a
[27:23] mock trial type of deal like and I got
[27:26] to have about 40 minutes with this
[27:32] police officer alone in a room by my
[27:35] request for this and he gave me one of
[27:39] the most sincere apologies that I've
[27:40] ever heard in my life he was crying I
[27:44] was crying
[27:46] we hugged I said a prayer and that
[27:50] prayer said in that prayer I asked the
[27:53] Lord of all negativity hatred any
[27:59] emotions attached to this would stay in
[28:03] that room and I let that man walk out
[28:07] ahead of me and I closed the door behind
[28:09] us and that was the end of it and we
[28:13] went out in front of the courtroom they
[28:16] gave me a opportunity to speak and I
[28:21] told in front of three different news
[28:23] channels in the entire city of Toledo
[28:27] Ohio what true repentance really was and
[28:30] that through the King James Bible I was
[28:35] taught proper Christianity and it was
[28:40] amazing moment I really don't even
[28:43] remember saying anything as far as that
[28:46] goes but I was just amazing that the
[28:50] Lord allowed all of that to come out it
[28:55] was they did a beautiful job on those
[28:57] four this morning a man in a wheelchair
[29:00] wholeheartedly forgives the man who shot
[29:03] him putting him in that chair former
[29:05] Ottawa Hills Police Officer Thomas wife
[29:07] wise to stand trial again after an
[29:10] appeal but his victim asked that the
[29:12] case be resolved our Michelle Zepeda was
[29:15] in the courtroom and watched as both
[29:16] families wanted peace Michelle what
[29:19] happened in the Honorable Gary cooks
[29:20] courtroom took us all by surprise Mike
[29:23] McCloskey was once an angry man and
[29:25] struggled after being paralyzed today he
[29:27] gave everyone hope and hope that his
[29:29] acts of forgiveness would move others to
[29:32] consider love rather than hate oh I
[29:34] think the Lord Jesus Christ through King
[29:37] James Bible teaching me what repentance
[29:40] truly is I cannot hold you the most is
[29:45] bad and I can cry with a smile now 32
[29:48] year old Mike McCloskey called
[29:50] prosecutors two weeks ago asking to
[29:52] resolve this case that was set for
[29:54] retrial his strength and
[29:56] courage and his compassion as an example
[29:59] for all of us and mr makovski is what
[30:02] drove us being able to resolve this
[30:05] McCluskey had one request to meet face
[30:08] to face with white before the hearing so
[30:10] he could forgive him for what happened
[30:12] back in 2009
[30:13] McClosky says they prayed together that
[30:16] prayer was a prayer forgiveness that he
[30:20] can truly get the forgiveness that he
[30:23] deserves for his family and know that
[30:25] life that I myself and my family are
[30:29] going to be okay
[30:30] and it was prayer in his religion that
[30:32] McCloskey says had given him a new lease
[30:35] on life and allowed him to give Thomas
[30:37] white a fresh start as well I think it's
[30:39] a an excellent example of forgiveness
[30:41] which a lot of times we don't see no way
[30:44] pled no fine I just really want to say
[30:46] thank you Lord our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:52] for opening up my eyes bringing me the
[30:54] truth of what true repentance really is
[30:58] I just want to pray that this is a
[31:03] powerful testimony that this can help
[31:08] people understand what your repentance
[31:10] is and that the reading of life is love
[31:13] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I
[31:16] can't say enough there's not enough
[31:19] words but the words are in this King
[31:21] James Bible and I know that's the truth
[31:24] and what has done to me is unexplainable
[31:28] but it is opened up my spirit and opened
[31:34] up my eyes and took off the blinders and
[31:37] I just want to share that with there's
[31:40] many people that it can get out and I
[31:44] didn't prepare a speech I just wanted
[31:46] him to come right through him that Holy
[31:49] Ghost his channel rings at the trial
[31:54] when I after I gave my statement to the
[31:57] judge he had told me that he was going
[32:00] to grant my request due to my testimony
[32:04] about the Lord Jesus and my clear
[32:07] judgment on my situation and how I felt
[32:12] towards his police officer which was
[32:15] 100% sincere forgiveness with all of my
[32:20] heart you see my emotions I told him I
[32:24] could cry with a smile because the Lord
[32:27] Jesus has got his hand on everything
[32:36] after that I kept witnessing to people I
[32:43] got three of my close friends from
[32:47] childhood baptized they came to the Lord
[32:50] and it's been it's been an amazing
[32:53] experience we had a really good service
[32:57] one night really anointed service just
[33:00] the Holy Ghost service and I we had left
[33:05] and was driving home and I had I had
[33:10] painted I used to have pain spasm
[33:12] severely you know and I was driving home
[33:17] and I turned on the airport highway and
[33:21] a pain spasm hit me so bad that I would
[33:23] crushed my steering wheel with my hands
[33:24] and I cried out to the Lord and said I
[33:29] love you Lord Jesus and it felt like a
[33:33] bucket of warm water was poured over me
[33:36] all the way down me inside now and it
[33:39] went all the way down and it hit my feet
[33:41] and I could feel my legs I could touch
[33:44] my legs I felt them I felt them
[33:46] connected to my body and it was just
[33:50] it's an amazing experience when you go
[33:52] from t12 paralysis to healed and I am
[33:58] healed by His stripes I was healed 2,000
[34:03] years ago isaiah 53:5 and says that and
[34:06] i stand on that word to this day and i
[34:11] just wanted to give this testimony
[34:12] you know why had the opportunity still
[34:16] sitting in this wheelchair to just give
[34:19] the Lord's give the Lord the testimony
[34:22] on this
[34:29] so I'm giving this testimony for the
[34:32] glory of the Lord's Kingdom and I pray
[34:36] that it can it can touch people's lives
[34:38] that they can see that you can speak
[34:42] life or death into your body with your
[34:46] tongue you really got to watch what you
[34:48] say that's one thing that really stands
[34:51] out to me another thing that really
[34:53] stands out to me is how he had his
[34:57] gentle hand on me the whole time has
[34:59] held me from death more testimonies than
[35:03] I could put on this video how many of my
[35:08] friends that were very close to me that
[35:12] have died and when I was right next to
[35:14] him I mean it come he's kept me from
[35:17] death so many times and I see the strong
[35:27] it pulls on me about salvation how he
[35:31] was guiding me towards it the whole time
[35:34] and the special moments even some that
[35:40] were small or some that were very great
[35:44] that was his voice talking to me that
[35:47] was his actions pulling on me saying
[35:51] come closer my son and I I just I pray
[35:57] that that through all this that
[36:01] forgiveness is a very important part of
[36:07] this that you have to forgive your
[36:10] trespasses you have to love your
[36:12] neighbors it is so very important that
[36:15] you just forgive everybody and just cast
[36:20] those cares aside and and just put it in
[36:24] prayer and just trust on the Lord and
[36:27] have faith that your prayers are
[36:29] answered
[36:30] pray for them and put them in past times
[36:33] and thank them
[36:42] you
