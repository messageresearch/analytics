[Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] to be as we stand we get right into the Word of God we'll try not to be long tonight you love the name of Jesus it was at that name mass salvation was purchased and that's what we're going to just talk about the name of Jesus tonight you know we don't hear the name of Jesus like we ought to in the world sometime in churches what is that name that God gave the angel God the angel gave Mary to call the the one who was going to save the entire world we understand this it's the name of the revelation of who Jesus is that the whole church was founded upon Carl said he laid the foundation no no other foundation can be laid we understand by God's grace that it's the name of Jesus who which was the not only the cornerstone but the rejected stone but now has become the chief Cornerstone because when we talk about Jesus the Bible says his name is one God's name is one and I know that even in this message people I have a problem with that name but I don't it's the name that I love to call on and I know that if we're going to have a full revival that God wants us to have as individuals we must know the name of Jesus Genesis 18 14 and Exodus 34 13 through 14 Genesis 18 14 don't worry we're not coming to rebuke nobody we just want to talk about the name of Jesus it is the sweetest name I know Genesis 18 14 it's anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son Exodus 34 but ye shall destroy their altars break down their images cut down their groves for thou shalt worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God let us pray father we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace in your mercy Lord sometimes I don't even know how to approach your throne seeing that I'm really nothing without you I try my heart's best humming myself before you you are my god you are my lord you are my everything I do know one thing Lord is in my heart to give you honor and glory and praise Lord for what it's worth I know nothing else to do you you are my Creator you saved me you raised me you kept me you've been my my daily sufficiency of things and father I don't know what else to say but glory to your name we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy bless your people now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I just want to start our subject this there's something about that name the name of Jesus Christ is so precious yet it is so powerful I think this is why we're not to take the Lord's name in vain it's a holy name it's a name that God himself named himself and you know this this Jesus we know by God's grace when he was on earth he did not have a good reputation among the religious people uh especially when he claimed to be God in the flesh when he said in Saint John I and my father one that was Saint John 10:30 they wanted to stone him and we find out in numerous occasions that Jesus Fred from death even as a young man because he realized that his death was to come by the cross now Jesus Christ Himself the Bible as John said John said he himself took upon himself no reputation and neither did Jesus Jesus Christ himself many times you know people want to glorify him and and he would hide and many times he said tell nobody he who did this thing so he kind of wanted to stay somewhat in the shadow to his appointed time there were times he even told the people that's not I that do the work you know but it's my father which is in heaven you know he doeth the work and said basically when I see him work then I work here the - so Jesus Christ came to do one thing and that was to glorify his father's name now understand now the father's name was Jesus Amen and this is why the angel told Mary said Mary this thing that being you is God's firstborn a man he he his name shall be called Jesus and Jesus is a New Testament word for Jehovah is salvation now we look at this thing and I say this because that name don't have the kind of effect that it used to have because Hollywood has downplayed it we've seen senator sinners call Jesus name when they would swear and things of that nature so we realize amen that sometimes people in the world even laugh at the name of Jesus but we who are Christians we love the name of Jesus because we realize a man that not only is his name Jesus but the Bible says that he named every all of his a creation his sons his daughters his family after him so their name is Jesus too many times I have told people I said don't you understand that in heaven you know every time you say Jesus on earth all of the family of heaven turns and look and says was it what is it that you want right because their name is Jesus oh come on somebody we are encamped about with a great hope hosts use me of angels and their name is called Jesus they said what do you mean I'm talking about the family of God those who have died in his name will rise again in his name now when we talk about God being a jealous God anybody ever experienced jealousy okay Yahoo y'all went fast enough but I understand I think everybody has at some point or another you know we try to fight it and speak to it and sometime it turn loose and sometimes it grab a hold event but yet it still I don't think I know a man or woman who has never felt the spirit of jealousy jealousy amen is when sometimes you feel like you ought to be getting the attention and you're somebody else is getting more attention than you right and they're always that feeling like oh it's a resentment that comes about for no apparent reason other than you feel like you ought to be getting the honor that the other person is getting amen when we talk about jealousy it's uh you know it's intolerant it's an intolerant of unfaithfulness or rivalry rivalry we talk about war right because that's what happens remember Cain with jealous of Abel and that kind of a jealousy was produced a murderer sometimes our jealousy causes us amen to speak evil of someone by way of our own imagination murdering their character right jealousy is a strong spirit even the prophet of God said that you know when it comes to uh filial love said you know a man loving his wife by way of jealousy can go and kill someone under that inspiration of jealousy yeah hear what I'm saying but you find out that the Bible said that God is jealousy jealous and you know our heard years ago that Oprah Winfrey said when she heard that God was jealous that really made her know that he wasn't God because God can't possibly be jealous we it made me know that alpha rip winfrey doesn't know God because God is even jealous of Oprah Winfrey any man or anything that is placed in God states becomes rival is that right remember there were many statues of the more bison all of them Moloch and all of they they erected before God and God was jealous God knocked him down they raised him up he knocked him down again they raised him up he took off his harms you know it was God he did not and he cared for no one to be in his position but he himself is that right not even you and I we can't allow ourselves and this is what I want everybody to know the bride of Jesus Christ is a wonderful thing to be but never ever mistake that you can take the place of God you understand me even when we preach about the bride we must always include Calvary we must always include the sacrifice of Jesus and how through Calvary it was Calvary a sword that gave us birth hallelujah see without him will nothing even as Eve was a byproduct of Adam liken it to us because without him see the word is perfect it was he who failed hallelujah the word never disbelieved but we disbelieve sometimes y'all hear what I'm saying so to be called by God's name is such an honor that everybody should never be ashamed of the name of Jesus hello somebody you know people they don't mind saying God you know god is good you ever hear people's oh yeah god is good you know the Lord is good but when you say ho praise God you know Jesus is awesome something happens in the atmosphere you know people don't care even if you talk about God in the restaurant but when they hear the name Jesus the demons awakens they know that something's going on when you call on the name of Jesus hallelujah you can say God and you can say Lord amen and nothing will happen but when you call upon the name of Jesus the Bible said demons has to trim the hallelujah oh yeah I tell you what that's one way to know that a person got a got a demon on when you start talking about Jesus and you see their whole countenance change it's something about that name when we talk about Jesus we we must understand you know we must it's a love affair people can tell when you the way you say Jesus you know I mean you know you know wife who's in love with her husband she's gonna pronounce his name different than way the way you or I would pronounce it it's something about the way she pronounces it because it it literally radiates a love our spirit attack on the husband when he hears her call her his name oh my god see I don't know don't talk about it but in the name of Jesus is powerful right amen and we find out that the name it must always be kept in reverence it's because above every name yeah and I'm saying the scripture says that the name of Jesus Christ is above every name right remember during the time of Paul when there were those who were making themselves disciples of Paul and some of Apollo's and some of us each listened and you know and they were they were dividing the self there were Christians but they were actually denominating themselves by raising up me that they can call themselves apart that's wrong we're not a part of any man except the man Christ Jesus right so you and I must understand he says is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul there was no salvation in Paul even though Paul had the ministry they could bring salvation to thousands but the name that Paul ministered under was the authority of Paul's ministry in that name was the name of Jesus Christ we talked about william branham but it was the name of Jesus Christ that gave our prophet the authority is that right he told us I forgot what country was in but there was working witchcraft and they had the table's floating with the chairs and he said I cast you out in the name of the Father nothing happened in the name of the son doesn't happen in the name of the Holy Ghost nothing happened you know brother madam said demons travel by way of that Trinity hello somebody he said but when I say in the name of Jesus Christ he said that kid that chair dropped so fast broke all the legs off of him I don't know who was holding it up or what was holding it up but when they heard the name Jesus well those demons had to let go of the table hallelujah you see when you cold brendham said it like this he said when you call on the name of Jesus he draw close to you see that's why we we don't feel him like we used to because we don't call on his name like used to but I tell you what I've got a wife whenever trouble calm she knows the name hallelujah sometimes when I'm fly we're flying she all she's mothering muttering is Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus chain she knows that that name is gonna keep that flame that plaintiff light hallelujah amen and let me tell you something people of God when it comes to the name of Jesus we should never forget it it should never be a secondary word it meant in our vocabulary it should be always before us when we wake up thank you Jesus when we go to bed thank you Jesus when we feelin thank you Jesus he should always be there the Bible said if you acknowledge the Lord in all of your ways he shall direct your path and when you acknowledge the Lord you call on his name hallelujah you can't say hey boy you get nothing or hey mister you'll get nothing hallelujah but when you call him by his name I remember brother Branham said when he got saved he said I didn't know how to pray he said but dear sir see you gotta come in room for this if you really God he said you would you please ask me sir oh I love that just gets my heart in I can you see it you know he didn't know he was a prophet that didn't know much about Christ he didn't even know how to call on his name but God knew his heart see when your heart is right God will reveal himself to you see so we look at this and I keep saying that folks because I want people to understand that I am seeing a revival of his name among the true believers because even when I was in the Apostolic Church it was always the bishop said this and the bishop whatever the bishop said but Bishop wasn't God hello you know and the prophet of God even says this if we lift a man of God up so high God will cause him to fall to get your attention all for him and back Oh God hmm and that's why I tell people I said don't be lifting me up give the other where armies do that sister Lord Jesus Christ y'all understand me amen now we find out Amen by the grace of God the Bible says Amen according to Psalms 86 6213 see this name is so important understand it was the first uh I put it this way wing when the angel gave it to to Mary Jesus she she may not have thought much about it but when she spoke that name in the presence of Elizabeth she saw that that name had resurrection power he was a bad baby daddy in the Elizabeth womb for six months and Mary goes over to Elizabeth to testify what God had done for her and so that a little bit could know that God has done for something from me just like he did it for you and then all of a sudden and this was concerned because John has not kicked yet and mary says without an angel call came by me and he told me I was going to have the son of God and I should call his name Jesus who it penetrated so much so it went into the womb of Elizabeth and John begins a shout hallelujah he came to life hallelujah just by the speaking network she that's what the devil has caught us he's got us in the place we don't call on him enough is this okay yeah brother and I hope this is all right a brother you know I was preaching the message similar to this and you know you know we have the brother branham in the pillar of fire and all and he asked me a question he said what brother man brother Brooks he said if I bow down before the pitcher and pray to that pillar of fire he said is that all right I said no tell me I'll probably say yes I said no I said first of all that's an image of the pillar fire that is not the pillar fire then I had to explain to him I said remember Amen when you had the brass Serpent up on the pole that represented Christ that represented healing it was a foreshadow what Jesus what I'm going to do sin being judged on the cross in order for those people to live it was a mighty thing happening amen because all of them were gonna be bitten and died by these snake bites remember everybody that looked up they acknowledge their sins and their transgressions and because they did it they lived but everybody that dropped their head wasn't ready to confess what they had done so they died then what happened after that it became a worshipping idol they began to worship that thing that thing wasn't God it was their obedience to what God told them to do that brought the healing you can burn a picture of brother Branham amen with that pillar of fire but you're not hurting brother Branham another pillar fire I wouldn't take a chance you know what I mean I cuz I reverence the picture but you don't bow to it you know when people do that they need the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost won't let you do that if God said don't go down to a graven image you know or any kind of image you know you got to tear it dinner y'all hear what I'm saying well it's amazing because you know people have gotten to the place where they don't even know what worship is and they're guilty of it I'm Wersching everything but God it is okay I'm not fussing I'm trying to share I'm just trying to exalt the name of Jesus because I realized amen it's not exalted it's not sad enough you don't you know even preachers don't even call on his name enough but we need to you know when the last time you heard acts 2:38 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you said well we don't need to do that yes we do we've got young fellows and folks coming up that need to hear that and know the reasons for that see it's the name of Jesus Christ it's the rejected stone he was to reject the stone did not did not Peter preached on it he said but just this the same Jesus God has made him both Lord and Christ he's not on the heel he's not only only the foundation but he said capping off of the building you can't change it because the Bible says according to Hebrews 13 and 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever you know I look at the problem of God and how he loved the Lord Jesus Christ and people seem to miss it his love was in Jesus not in himself or no other preacher oh come on somebody give ear o Lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplication in the day of my trouble I will call upon me for that will answer me among the gods there is none like unto thee O Lord neither are there are any works like unto thy works all nations whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee O Lord and shall what glory by thy name and we have come in this age to glory saw his name read the book of Acts all through Acts when they tried to glorify the men of God they turned them back to Jesus we didn't do nothing remember they even tried to worship Him says no no no I don't want that this belong to Jesus Christ it is he who has done these miracles is that what I probably did he did the same thing he said come in sister he said ah I wish I could heal you he said but I can't do nothing said he's the one that heals hallelujah he said and many times oh if I could heal everybody in this building I would do it he said but I can't do it he has to do it is that right he said even Jesus he said Jesus himself never healed one person when I first heard that I'm like world he says right he said jesus said I can do nothing except I see the father do it teach so we must understand people though we are the house of God that our power in our authority is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't come with no new name that he's got some kind of new me that will be given but the Bible says neither is there salvation under heaven there's no salvation in any other name under heaven except the name Jesus Christ and as long as we under heaven that's his name he can't change it it's his name people said well you know the seals open and he gave himself a new name well if he did you wouldn't know it and if he did like brother man who said if you knew the new name you wouldn't be able to tell it so somebody said well I know his new name you say you liar what is it they tell you a name you know the line but thou are great and doing wondrous things thou art God alone teach me thy way O God O Lord I will walk in that truth unite my heart to fear what thy name don't use his name around me loosely I feel that name because the name of Jesus Christ is not some sound it scary its power its eternal y'all hearing saying Amen it is it's amazing that he will allow although lips to say his name teach me that way or Lord I will walk in that truth unite my heart to fear thy name I will praise thee O Lord my God with all my heart and will I will glorify the name forevermore hi Steve a saying of thy name thy name thy name thy name you know he had a seven redemptive days and all those names according to the Prophet God was in that one name Jesus think about it folks here he was yeah ha ha Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide Jehovah Rapha our healer Jehovah Shalom our peace Joe Olga Vanessa at my feet you are my banner jehova rohi my shepherd Joe over some our Lord is present and you know Joe over tsking it's all through the word and when you call it Jesus you get a seven fold a Sevenfold power that comes in that name the devil can't escape it there's no hiding place when you're calling the name of Jesus is that right now listen I'm gonna say it like this if the whole heaven the family of God is named after Jesus can you imagine you in a situation you can't see what's going on in beyond the veil but the proper God comes along he says now he said I get Hades off oh you know was he largest servant he said whatever his name was but you know he you know what I'm saying and then he says Lord open up my servants eyes he did watch him n Chariots of Fire encompassing them and he like had already told him listen don't you understand he meant there more of them more of us than them if that was yesterday it is the day and a host of angels encompass one man and the purpose at the age of the Lord the angel not the Angels the angel of the Lord the cheapest of all angels and camp about us oh come on somebody he watches for his bride he he he watches for his bride and the victory of this this army onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before huh that name Jesus goes on before it's never lose sight of the name of Jesus Christ because if Jesus said oh one would come in another's name and you will receive it but when I come in my name you won't receive me brother Bantam goes in the blasphemous name he says all these things that this method is not the names right in front of us and these what I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist oh you know that if you are the word you are the bride and you carry his name that's why it's always important tonight I'd done something out of ignorance I didn't see it I was so caught up I've married somebody and didn't even notice that the girl didn't have on the veil because I wasn't there during the rehearsal if I would have been in there in the rehearsal I would like you got to get somebody else to marry you because I marrying you without a veil that's the word why is it important for the Veil the veil is symbolic of you losing your headship women sisters is that Alright when you put that veil over your head when you put that back over your head you're literally saying my headship is cut off he is now my head you understand me you are literally giving your whole self trusting Jesus right your whole self you you're working with his mind that his mind is capable of leading me and guiding me his mind is capable of protecting me and providing for me here's mine right well peace well yeah he might be the head and I am the neck and that's what I've been not sick sometime them next get still you and I must understand when our husband and wives work together Satan's afraid of you Satan is afraid of you when there's unity in the house he knows that a wife and a husband when they don't want Accord they are dynamite he's afraid of you because he knows that you can accomplish so much more being on one Accord a house divided can't stand he can come in and he can conquer you but when that wife stands by her husband and that husband stands by her why his wife says we may not agree on everything but we gonna fight you devil hallelujah see y'all me not some of y'all may not understand what I'm talking about when you killed me come teenagers you'll find a unity among parents like never before especially if they love them right you'll find them coming together and you'll find a unity that cannot withstand is that okay thank you you see what I'm saying my thing is you and I must understand that in believing God brother well said do you believe the seven redemptive names compound names belong to Jesus if he wasn't or didn't fulfill in him well what they'll need seven compound names he wasn't your hova Zahra there is your whole jar of God provided sacrifice you will have to admit that or say he wasn't the Son of God then if he was your home adhara he is Jehovah Rapha the heel also for all see and that's what we know Lord help me please help me please I guarantee you it's you sweetie you add Jesus on there you'll get a better answer how many of you have ever been pinned down by demons you're trying to get up and you can't get up anybody know y'all don't have to be ashamed I have okay I got to be for everybody you halfway sleep the devil pins you down you don't know you can't some people said with your you don't fell asleep no no you ain't sleep your mind is awake and you can't move your body because there's a spirit hole in your back and you can say everything you want I tell you what I call on everything and then I even said Jesus but one thing when I said but the Lord Jesus I got that out that they were trying to play games with me yeah there's a lot of Jesus's but when I said the blood of Jesus that devil had to go y'all understand me power in the name of Jesus he's a healer would you call on him and you said Lord Jesus heal me well you know you ain't talking to that door you're talking to him you are acknowledging that he is the healer oh I hate it you know I've done this myself I thought many times I saw some time I just wish brother Brandon was here and the Holy Ghost says and what would he be able to do he couldn't do nothing until I showed him I'm the one you hit me you should be calling on me and yet you are you you wanting to see him Jahna semi a little jealousy can get there you know you seem possible it is you know always say what if what if what if what if Rebecca would have come to Isaac tintin and in all she's woo I think that trip with Ellen was so wonderful Oh Ellen was that how you say you don't think he would have gotten a little jealous and he would have said well what is this thing about you and Elysa you come to marry me you understand me let's see people don't understand God but I'll tell you what if husbands if your wife came home she's working with somebody of something she'd come home talking about him all the time you might fight it awhile but a little jealousy going to rise up and say wait a min hold it I don't know what's going on but if you don't stop calling on that name you're gonna have to find another job I'm coming up and seeing who this guy is now if you love her you gonna do that know your wife don't talk about northern man but you that way that's okay so you got to understand God the same way right you got a call on the name of the Lord Shiva you've got to give honor where honor to that is where the revival is that's where it starts that's where it ends is that right when the Holy Ghost came down amen and an infant in them Peter went through all history talking about the page arrives and all of this thing but at the wall he said this is that and he preached Jesus you know there's so many people in this message that don't even know nothing about Calvary they can't explain how Kihara got saved what the blood of Jesus means to them hallelujah and it's nothing wrong with I'm not trying to take anything from the Prophet or Paul or Peter John or anything all of them did what they were supposed to do but folks understand they were in his head he wasn't in theirs he understand me the cell stars was in here in the right hand of him him who Jesus if I'm making sense he held them in his hand so what he was a he was doing the work he was the one creating he was the one that opened the eyes of the blind he we who Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Branham was a man who came that God used to declare that means to make you know to emphasize that he's the same yesterday today and forever we do him injustice sometimes because he wouldn't have it the way we do it sometimes you love the Lord as to 36 and 39 says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God had made the same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all them afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call who that name can never stop it will never die y'all hear what I'm sayin so let me say it like this you know how people say the voice of the rock are the voice of the Resurrection is in the bride you've heard that you've heard people say well people gonna one day get go by the gravesites I don't know whether you heard that and call people up don't believe that that's not true that's error the voice of the Archangel is the holy ghost the voice of the bridegroom is the holy ghost hallelujah and because you got it in you you'll be able to hear him he alone stood out at the grave and said Lazarus come forth he alone and because Lazarus was a seed of God he heard the voice you know you got to understand that how people twist this message and when they do they get a bad crop of stuff right so you say well what do you mean brother so I want you to understand people that their take brother branham's quote and their twist it to me something like it's a deep revelation but understand everything must go back here it must strike the Urim of tharam is that right brother branham said it himself when the angel came to me he would tell me anything I'll go back to this book am I making sense see what it is you don't want to take nothing away from the Lord Jesus Christ did you know that the Word of God is perfect the Bible said is so perfect you can try it if you like it's tried but let me tell you something there's no failure in this word listen everything that the prophet of God preached about Jesus Jesus vindicated it that's how you and I know it was Jesus Christ he was preaching and he's Jesus Christ who was doing it and then because he vindicated it when he told about that pillar fire above his head they didn't want to believe it and one day Jesus himself came down it took a picture right so you know it is warm in here and I know y'all fighting that sleep hallelujah hey man I'm just trying to help I'm not gonna be long but my opponents amen when we look at this thing we see even by the grace of God that the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess so you say well what do you mean by that just name know everything named when Adam named those animals in the garden there was a certain characteristics but the characteristics of the animal is what gave Adam the name when he said hog that Hall was the kind of animal a man that he slop in all kind of stuff now he knew that that animal was gonna eat slop when that Elmer at that time more than likely had never eaten slop before because there was nothing dying but he knew and when he called that thing a dog wad over and you know dogs are so cute some of them I don't like that I don't care for the sloppy can but you know the ones that are really cute you know you you know look and you think sometime they so smart you say they should have been human my lady sheep she catch attitudes and everything especially Tom if I come home and I'm she's jumping and jumping and I'm ignoring her because I'm busy she said to herself you can see it in eyes I get you back that next day I come home and she won't move she might even stand up and turn our back but it's something about the dog you know what I mean I don't have preached on that because I do have a love for dogs you know you look at that thing and God calls us Gentile dogs we have our bad habits but we know how to worship the master hallelujah we may go back and turn like a hog to the slop but we know our master amen you love the Lord listen jesus answered according to John 12 saying they always come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but it if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hated his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal If any man served me let him follow me where I am there shall also my servant be If any man serve me him will my father on earth the understand me if you serve Jesus Christ let me put it this way God will vindicate you but it must be Jesus Christ who you're following hallelujah now in my so troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour that's why I love God hosting now he's telling you he says Lord save me from this hour but it was for this cause I came into this this hour this world I was born to be the Lamb of God I was born to suffer for mankind and I and even though my flesh don't want to do it let your will be done see that's the bride of Jesus right it's not that every time God asked you to do something or praise the Lord I want to do it no there's going to be times you don't want to do it but he still know you will because it is you to humble yourself oh it's the truth you know Jonah was rebellious I'm not going my fact this is time for me to take a holiday and I'm skipping town I'm going down there with the yacht's are nice he gets on the boat not knowing he's in the will of God you can't run from him folks see God he knows how to wake he does things where you think you running into the air you're getting right where I want you right oh that's the truth he didn't know how else to get Moses out of Egypt how I'm gonna get Moses out of Egypt and I'm over here on that mountain inspires Moses I'm a leader I'm a leader and then all of a sudden that same zeal calls him to kill an Egyptian he gets kicked out of Egypt and now he's gonna end up where right where God wants him to be see look and sometimes that's why it's not so good to judge people or judge their lives too early you don't know what God is doing you don't know you know you can see it but you don't see a prostitute on the street and you might think she's going to hell you know she might even help tattoos all the way up to her skull but you don't know what's on the inside don't let see that's the devil right there right that's the devil even trying to make you fear or hate that so you won't given the gospel given the gospel because the reason why people do that kind of stuff is they want attention is that true oh i'ma tell you the truth most women that literally dress if you're Fame like only wants attention somewhere they like love somewhere and they'll do whatever they can do to get a little bit of tension right it's just that little childish thing that comes out of us sometime right it's that's right like most children most children if they're not getting attention they would rather get a beatin they wanna beat least mama no daddy no he spared me of some attention but that ain't the way God wants you to be anyway let me move on we're too here to glorify His name I've got to hurry glorify it means to reverence and respect it means to cause to be or treat as being most splendid excellent etc then would normally be considered to honor it praise admiration or worship extol to make glorious investment Lord - praise the glory of God especially as an act of worship he understand me so when you say Jesus you're not saying it in a common way put some love in it put some love in and so people can know there's love coming through that Jesus huh you know and that's what God knows when when you working in a just casual you know I'm saying you know it's the way y'all women know you my wife could say we call I call her sister Ruby or something and she sister Brooks and she called me brother Brooks but sometime it's the tone the way she called me when I know I know what she won't and she says in in a certain way I'm like oh man what did I do wrong but then there's another way she can say it you know to me you know she put some love in it and that's audience with Jesus you supposed to put some love in it don't make him your errand boy you put some love in it let me let me say it like this remember when David was going to go down there and kill what's-his-name the one that fool neighbor neighbor huh neighbor right his name was food yes wouldn't anyway and Abigail comes out and said don't you know his name is food but what did she do she put love so much love it caught Davis attention Oh David we know you a mighty man we don't heard of your reputation y'all him say huh me oh she didn't even say it like this but she come said you know I got all your photos up on the wall no she did say like that but she put so much love in it that she sincerely cared for him now she didn't push the husband aside you know his name neighbor his knees that means he's a food but you date it don't fall in the same trap God to get him but David you don't want God to get you because you didn't have a lot of blood on your hand you don't want to do this and your anger you know what who said she worked it she worked it and then she topped it off with oh just to prove to you that I mean when I say David said I'm coming back for you you ever them say see you gotta realize these things are set in the scripture so we'll know how to approach God with [Music] troubles in the house you don't your troubles in your home or troubles in your life you don't approach God like he's an Arab I love I just need you to do that no you need to love on him for a while god I just so thank you Lord you're so wonderful to me and God you done did this now give him a testimony service and lord I know if you did that yesterday you can do it for me today father God you know I love you I feel like God now you can't deal with that you say Oh what all whether you won't right that's what David said is that right I'm sorry that's what King uh a steward said to Esther when Esther then put all ice cream in the cake out stuff like that he said you can have the half of my king see that is the effect God trying to tell us the effect we have on him with the right approach those things are not just setting in the Bible for you to like a Cinderella story is there to help you understand God's Way of thinking hmm John 12 I'm almost done you just with this segment I wish I anyway he says now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me then he said signifying what death he should die do you believe that the Bible said if you lift him up if you lift up the name of Jesus he would draw all men unto Him you don't even have to preach a whole sermon to somebody you just tell them let me yeah can I just give you a testimony let me tell you something what God did for me today the Lord Jesus did this for me today you'll be surprised and how many people want to hear something some good news everything they're getting nowadays bad news and you can tell them right now this is the season to talk to them about Jesus and you know you don't need nothing well I mean the message and I'm following the message of william branham that will come that will come but get their attention with Calvary with Jesus I'll let them know that God is already died for you how many of y'all we have a witness like that you understand what I'm saying and I'm not saying you know you don't leave you can't leave Malachi 4 out he's part of the word but my point is you don't stop with him that's what John said don't stop with me I'm not even worthy to unloose his latches there's one coming after me I'm pointing you to the direction in the direction you should we go after you leave me even the Prophet God said I must decrease and he must increase he pointed us he's the only one you know Billy Graham couldn't do it all robbers couldn't do it none of them folks Kenneth Hagin none of them could direct us to the truth Jesus Christ it was Malachi 4 because he was a prophet God revealed to him the real Jesus in a deceiving age like this so we got the real deal so therefore we should have the real results yes you understand me even even the Prophet God tried to live weaning the people off of him at time y'all remember that remember that lady who had already pray for that baby she had pray for and God had already healed the baby the Holy Spirit talking to the lady you go pray for right and then when brother Branham gets up there he says because she felt unworthy why should I pray for him when the prophet of God is here hello and God using you and he using him he is a property to make your property but God using you go pray we are party people that's what people don't understand we are body when brother Bantam got up there he said you already healed your baby's already delivered that lady up in the bathroom with that funny whatever dress that was she pray for you it was at that time God healed you he said minister pastors you have the same Authority I have you can pray for the sick you can lay hands and pray for the sick so he was trying to get the people not to make it a one-man army this is a body hallelujah is this okay but we all do it by the same authority whose authority what daughter you get what school did you come from I come from me ology school of the saints hallelujah but what is your what is your degree my degree is a HGT degree Holy Ghost degree hallelujah yeah I guess what I graduated with honors I have the right to preach the name of Jesus right oh come on somebody it's the name of Jesus Christ the devil is trying to get the church to lose sight oh right I think it's the Methodist Church they put out the books no longer do they sing about the blood how long has it been you've heard songs on the blood of Jesus Christ you remove the blood of Jesus you ain't got nothing it's just okay you know I want people to understand there is a balance to it you know I've heard people and I myself I've come you know you know and people misunderstand because you you you you saying things about William Branham and you don't understand we're not trying to take away from the matter what God did for him that fact I can't Holly wait to me he's he's I can't explain it all I know is that in my life he's second in line with Jesus you don't have to say it that way but I know I know one thing I want to see he and God gone granted that I would see him before I see him right I'm gonna see William Branham before I see Jesus you say oh that's not right yes it is that that resurrection brother Branham said there'll be waves he said Ephesus - get up Smyrna get up he said I'd be wave after wave after wave your leader yo William Branham would get up with this bride age did you all know that he said because he's got to stand with his people like Paul Stewart here so we don't all get up at the same time it's a wave of the Holy Ghost if you've ever been in a service like that you know what I'm talking about that's old-time services I hadn't seen one of them I guess that we had one up there and I'm in the women's retreat but I missed out on the day were telling me about it how that way came in there and God feel the people all of a sudden they thought it was quieting down here come the way McKee going to God I remember those times amen mm-hmm I can find your quote where he said the other night did when I was preaching in I win the church is flooded our church that anointing mm-hmm see God knows what he's doing right and then we'll meet Jesus in the end we meet everybody else here but we meet Jesus Christ in the air hmm is that the Bible all right okay you love the Lord now my point is sisters when I had that thing on my head you are giving over our sisters and brothers we're giving our authority over to Jesus Christ right now it's a modern day thing where people don't want to take their husband's name why do you think David the devil did that he's trying to break down the Bible like it means nothing but sister when a man gives you his name you supposed a hole that in reverence and respect you know uh if my wife was here she would say I want you to know that I am sister Isiah Bruce she believes Ruby out because that's the way it used to be you just took his name of course you kept your name on the birth certificate but when it came to addressing you were sister Isiah Brooks or whatever your husband's name wow that's that's the way I knew it and you know what you was a proud of it if he was a drunk he was still proud of it right it's just the way it is so anyway we look at the same and women don't want to give it up no more this woman this American spirit is anointing all kinds of folks yeah you know they don't even want to say you know obey your husband obey you better earn that if he won't meet you obey you know what but you know what a man i'ma tell you brothers you know when you love your wives you can get her to a place where she will and it will be out of love and not not because it's a commandment you won't even have to ask her to do nothing she'll be jump into it because she loves you so much oh I know y'all like that aren't you I'm just teasing you now I'm working with you but my point is something to work toward right now husband y'all know you got to be good husbands to that's what you ought to be but every time I think about that kind of a thing I think about that woman who had a husband who was an alcoholic and she was a Christian yeah I love that story here's this boy down there with his boys and you know they're talking hollering well you know I just don't believe in Christianity because you know I've never seen one and that fella speaking up enough says well I'll tell you what I got one at home prove it prove it yeah come on home with me I'm going to show you and they all staggering up there and everything get up there to the house well I'm on fix me some food she didn't say like the modern well huh up and home all day cleaning why don't you fit your own you got two hands she didn't say that she just went there and she started working can you imagine sister Oh Lord you put you don't worked hard you already tired you put that food on Damen ego I don't that mess you be mopping the floor right yeah no she didn't say that she fell down and she says must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free when those guys saw that woman acting in the inspiration of the word it convicted them and they got saved huh she is that like people will see they do billion don't mean nothing everybody's rebellion but when they see humility they see that that Christ life in your life somebody might say you're stupid but they're gonna be somebody said wow that's powerful that's powerful whatever that is I want some of that right oh yeah I didn't have the Holy Ghost at first but I saw them people jumping and shouting and speaking in tongues and running I said oh god I ain't got it like that before I know the fire came on me and I were out there dancing like I ain't never danced before and it didn't stop there God had already told me my mother had the Holy Ghost and she told me she says she said and my mother couldn't read or write but she said junior before she died she said God garden gonna leave you at that church she said God gonna bring you to a greater light she said you wait now don't go nowhere she says go be times it's gonna be hard at this church but you wait cuz God gonna send you a greater light and out of all the Apostolic churches in Columbia South Carolina God sent some people at my church who knew the message I waited and when God gave me your understanding I was there at a picnic when I heard his voice again he said this is the thing that your mama talk to you about this is that greater life see nobody can take this from me I don't care what the world say I don't care what these people in the message doing and all they doing and saying I'm telling you right now this message is of God and everything is promised it's going to bring to pass you don't have to wrestle with it it will live its way through you hallelujah I know it's true I've had experiences that don't ask me why I don't know why God give me all these experiences but it sometimes make me afraid because you know I said Lord Israel had all these experiences and they were lost I'm gonna be like that make me dumb I'd rather not have nothing and know that I'm saving gonna be raptured then they have all this stuff you know to me but God said yet and still they were still with Joshua and Caleb I said yes no thank you they saw it and they crossed over Amen you love the Lord but it's the name of Jesus listen how many of us are willing to get thrown in jail you know one of the things in our me that really inspired me on this message because you remember in Las Vegas where all those people got killed there a couple of weeks ago and you saw in the you to where these preachers were preaching warning them not to go into the concert did you all see that and all I could think about was Noah in the ark and they were making fun at the man getting all up in his face he wasn't afraid he told him and these were people who were Christian or call them so he said this one man was stupid drunk and he's drunk he's a beloved Christian I'm serious I'm a Christian and the man said well you can't be a Christian drinking and worshipping the devil like that but he didn't know maybe he belong to a denomination and he thought he was a Christian it wasn't wrong and sometimes I wonder because I said Lord was he one of the ones that got shot there were various ones women and men making mockery of the man not knowing that they were going into a chamber of death see God is faithful and if gotta use a street preacher like that what about us what about us warning before judgment none of those people they all thought they'd go come out of that place and they got in there and that man was running that gun like a machine gun and you know what they first thought it was firecrackers people people people see that's why I don't go in crowds they accept you going to the church you're going to the church I don't mind dying in there they couldn't come in there but more than likely they won't right we know they do it right right but I don't go nowhere my mom my wife and I you know she goes down to the farmers market I don't even go there no more I said cuz that's just the right place some devil inspired person is gonna come and start shooting up I'm not afraid to die but I don't need to go nowhere I don't need to go you might say where you leading a boring life I am my choice in Jesus I don't know I don't need all of the world extra current extra stuff I'm serious I really don't I don't need that whiskey they wine and nothing like that I don't need no party and banging and all that I don't need many times when I'm down that's all I could do is call on the name of Jesus I'm telling you I'm telling you you go home and practices sometimes just say Jesus Jesus Lord Jesus oh lord have mercy you in for treat you in for truth when the devil try to get you down I'm telling you it works remember I told you about about my son uh his name Isaiah he was a little boy and I was whipping him I was spanking him I can't remember what he what he did and I was spanking him he said Jesus Jesus I said Paul you better stop calling on the name of Jesus he said Jesus I got scared I stopped with him okay I done dedicated you to the Lord and I don't need no trouble like a demon just telling him not to call on Jesus everybody worked it worked hallelujah this brother named Lowry Chris Lowry he's from South Africa and somebody stole his his buggy they you know we know the buggy is a Volkswagen arm you know what the Volkswagen fan and somebody stole it and he saw the band going down the street or something like that I forgot exactly detail but and the boss started running he said stop in the name of Jesus the boy couldn't move the name of Jesus held him in his tracks right I'm just a testimony oh no godless sister oh she's going on with the Lord down there and Cape Town Amen one of those old-fashioned glorified ones I love that kind of look I just love y'all don't understand I'm a ho I'm old-fashioned I love that and then she comes in and she she's in driving her car she said I picked up this guy and he had the nerve to my he give me your car she said I he giving you my car God gave me this car she said I'll take you where you want to go but I'm not giving you this car she ended up witnessing him to the man in the name of Jesus and telling him you're not gonna take my car what she drove her car huh see you know when you when you know people I'm gonna tell you how powerful God is when somebody said well I'm gonna fire you and you need to say what did Jesus tell you cuz Jesus gave me this job and if you fire me and Jesus didn't tell you to fire me you're gonna be in trouble with him try it if that guy got any kind of fear in him he's gonna double check and say I'll come back later yeah I was in the doctor's office with this bad bad bad sign on what do you call him Tasos yeah well in fiction I don't know what it was but I know I looked in my mirror and I couldn't see the back of my throat so I got scared this is about three or four o'clock in the morning didn't want to wake my wife up I went on a had a bad fever I go to the doctor and they did not like me coming in there the shift and change and they by themselves and the doctor was upset and first of all they let's just let me wait in there and when he came in he had gotten a q-tip and he punching in the back he opened up car I mean just pain getting I'm like and then we finished I said oh I didn't practice this it just came out of my mouth because I was in so much pain I said oh Jesus he said hold up I'm coming right back he went out the door probably asked God for forgiveness I don't know but he came back confessing he said I'm so sorry he says I'm a Christian myself I started witnessing to him about the Lord Jesus Christ see the name of Jesus I stopped a devil right in the track see that power is in the name folks that's what I'm trying to tell you the devil that's your name that represents you you you when you say Jesus that's like a woman in distress calling her husband and if he's a good husband he's coming to your rescue right so when you look and you see the power of the name of Jesus Christ amen and understand Amen that everything is must bow hmm that's why I love Esther because Esther displayed her authority even when the King didn't understand what was going on Esther winning and she told Naaman and all of his family up a man I love it was because she said Don only killed him he's got some offspring killed them too and that's what it is we gonna not only kill the devil but all his offsprings I'm even thrown in the lake of fire you love the Lord I hope this is not too elementary for you but I love the name of Jesus the Bible said in Colossians 3:17 whatsoever you do in the word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him huh that's God coming in vindicating you because you are using his name and he wants you to use it whatsoever you do in Word or in deed right giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting here it is yourself went to another in the fear of God see in the name of Jesus you and I are order to submit ourselves one to Adani this is a body situation right amen you love a god got I've got a quote here and then I'm then I'm gonna let you go t we and I must understand that God means business and you know this is a love affair honestly I'm enjoying Jesus I really uh like I said this morning I enjoy being a Christian I have my problems like everybody else but my my whole goal I want I don't want to be just a Christian you understand what I'm saying I I want to make a difference I will garden you know he's like we sang today he knows my name well I want him I wanna you know I don't I just cannot stand going anywhere if a person is not knowing what I am I don't want them figuring out how I'll tell them and they can watch me if they want to right I'm a Christian I preached Jesus wherever I go when I go to the the stores and and all of that I've had people comment I wait sometimes I'll smile I speak to him and I just wait for that door to open and when it does guess who comes to the door goes out Jesus some people like it and some don't but I don't care I'm searching for my kind mmm that's what I'm looking for my kind amongst all this darkness I'm looking for my kind and that kind is the word kind hallelujah of the Lord and we don't look far more how we gonna fight we we're here commissioned to find the rest of our body the rest of our family lost in war somewhere amnesia or something we're here we're supposed to go look for them it's okay cheek in that church age book what brother Branham said God told him to take up this pin and write those pages are so precious precious to me that I cannot even explain to you where some people don't want to acknowledge it but the bride of Jesus Christ knows the voice of her bridegroom and when you hear that you know that had to come from God because no man could have made anything up like that up and I'm not going to read all of it but I read something to you because I want you to understand that God did such a unique job when it came to his plan of salvation it cannot be duplicated or copied it's so Pat and it's so right it's so rich and we look at this thing and says what if that she remaineth in you you cannot see sin and we just look but that is powerful that God put a seed in you and me and he said the best seed remaineth in you you cannot commit sin that means there is no way you can disbelieve unbelief is not a word in your category you know you know it's not it's not that and we're not talking about flesh we're talking about soul if that's so that's see in you has been quickened you that's God and you do and God cannot disbelieve its word that's that's why the Bible says meditate you know why it tells you to meditate because meditation takes you beyond your flesh beyond your spirit right into your soul and when you see what's in your soul that's where your power is that's your power right in the area right in it that's your power natural spirit that's soul riding there with Jesus live death that's where you are and that's the real you that's the real you this ain't you it's just an image of you and God's gonna tear this thing apart and rebuild it but the real you is inside that Holies alone is that's the real you the devil say look at what you've done Paul said I didn't do nothing he said that was my flesh that wasn't me I love Paul Paul knew how to shut the devil's mouth didn't he say he said that ain't me I didn't do that my flesh needed now here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bring forth of its kind we should we read Genesis all those years we never would have really under the third the depth of it itself God sent Malakoff forward to us unfolding that word to us showing it and we saw it we knew it we didn't understand it corn brain for corn alpha brain for apples peaches peaches whatever now they just mix it all up and you know and you can't see it don't paint blue that harbored true good taste good anyway but it's dead come on now who in here don't like seedless grapes now I'm different because I like my watermelon with seeds for some reason seeds in the watermelon gives it a different taste and I like the idea of a spitting them out you know it's something about that you know boys you should love it let's see help me Jesus like I'm sorry I don't mean humorous but you know if it I still like that like I like my chicken and people you want you want a chicken basket only if it's got bone in it I don't like chicken with fillets I like my bone the bone gives it flavor and y'all know y'all not eating chicken right chicken is what God made she called is what the man is me it's hybrid ya hear what I'm saying you know what you go down in the country where they were they raising those those chickens and stuff like that you know and you know they aint got no all that funny stuff they don't put on them that's real chicken the real chicken the meaning is different colors that kind of chicken don't get on in between your teeth you got to work with that chicken that chicken the real chicken makes you tough that hybrid makes you saw well it'd be good y'all know it is fried up no but nevertheless it's not so good for you yeah let me move on Allah forgive me please I'm not trying to be humorous but let me read on the law of reproduction bring forth of this kind these last days true church bride comes through the air stone will be the super church super race me as it's near the head y'all don't heard it's a great head stone now how are you and I what will make us a super Church the super God did you know there's nothing to a bomb it was just a shell it's what's in the shell that is the power of the bomb a man without God ain't nothing but a shell but if you put God in him he's omnipotent he's all-powerful that's what I try to tell these kids I said don't y'all know y'all in the image of God you should never you dumb don't you know God don't like that God has never created a dumb child and I believe with all my heart every child has the ability of scoring a hundred if they want to and they can believe it it might take one child a little longer than the other but they still made in the image of God do you love the Lord I just believe it that way I don't believe in no stupid kid and all that no I don't sorry they might go through some trauma but these traumas they can be taken out of and be raised up in a normal way anyway I don't know why I said that but anyway let's move on so what they will be a church like so much like him even they would be in his very image in the order to be united with him they will be one they would be the very manifestation of word of the Living God listen denominations can never produce this see because you understand it's the seed it's what God put in you you're not doing it it's God in you doing it in other words God impersonate himself in you that's what he did he impersonated himself in the property impersonates himself in you the move is on the rise but what was the thing that you and I are failing to do with we're family to stay in the presence of the son because he said if we would be in the presence of the Sun we would be ripened in the world prayer right whatever it takes to stay in his presence that is what will bring us to maturity you love the Lord and then when you began to say things in the name of Jesus Christ it'll come to pass everything because you'll be inspired by him to do it just like God told me to bake by that lady's shoes she it was God I did it in the name of Jesus and I wanted to let that know that woman no I came in Jesus name you understand me I don't want to leave nothing God does I don't want nobody but he's a good man no no I'm not the good man the good man is a man who's inspired me to do the good thing you love the Lord God is good to us in the morning when I rise in the morning when I rise here in the morning will give me G give me Jesus
