[Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Raisa let's take our Bibles here tonight this was a Psalm chapter 33 I'd like to continue looking at American history by God's grace I like to title this identified with America's founding fathers start to look at some of the founding fathers and their testimonies tonight Psalms 33 look at verse 11 Psalms 33 11 on Sunday we looked at proverbs 14 that righteousness exalts a nation so we have a great idea why some nations are exalted and other nations are not it's because those that are exalted have kept the way of the Lord praise God and God's blessings lasts from generation to generation to generation praise God hallelujah proverbs 33 verse 11 actually let's read verse eight though I would like to read that I saw that earlier and I thought that'd be good scripture to read as well by God's grace Psalms 33 8 let all the earth fear the Lord that all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him are we standing in awe of him tonight praise God that's why we're standing because we know how great God is tonight let's go down to verse 11 the counsel of the Lord stands forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations let's all read verse 12 together Psalm 33:12 thank you three two on three one two three blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance praise God aren't you glad he chose you praise God he didn't have to but he chose you he knew you choose him for he's God he can't force you to serve Him that's how we're to pray let's bow our heads here tonight you haven't eaten on your heart just making known unto the Lord here how many father Lord we're happy to be in your house tonight on this pray Lord God and worship you and I pray God your truth would be preached your people would receive it they'd be fed their spiritual portion of spiritual manna Lord God for for tonight's service as we head into the holidays may we truly have the spirit of Thanksgiving which is the holy spirit dear God to be thankful for all the blessings that you've graciously bestowed upon us Lord God we don't deserve it but Lord we're grateful for our our forefathers or those in this nation who have laid the groundwork and sacrificed so much that we can enjoy your blessings and help us to continue to live righteously that we pass it on to Lydia's generation Malachi generation and nature's and virtues and Eden's and this next generation James and Lily Lord will pass on how we know the Lord is real and the testimonies that we've seen God do pass it on that right Lord can be lived out again it should there be another generation dear God granite Lord God and let us live righteously as we sing that song let us be a generation that seeks your face those of us who are adults those of us who are older and more mature and know better help us to seek your face O God for Lord we must seek you in a day you can be found and help us tonight as we preach your word help us to receive it and preach it and live it for your glory in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you being seated praise God so Lord willing we'll be looking at these thoughts here tonight by God's grace Lydia I'm sorry case you can switch over here I'm gonna try to show a visual here it's called the liberty matrix and I'll talk about this in just a moment here I'm pulling from three different references for this little series actually for one of them I read at school Sunday we looked at identified with the pilgrims and trust that was a blessing to you by God's grace I'm holding from a source this book is a good source on shaping history through prayer and fasting I'm pulling from this one I'm pulling from a documentary by Kirk Cameron called monumental and that's what this one's about this is not from that video but it's a picture describing the monument and then I'm pulling from another video I watched by David Barton he's the the leader of the ministry called wall builders he has over a thousand documents of the early American fathers like the literal real documents books the letters they wrote books books that they printed he's one of the largest collectors of American artifacts and then I'm pulling from a few facts from a book I read at school too about the pilgrims so praise God today let's just remember that quote I kind of started Sunday morning with the RAM said I was identified with them at he says at Plymouth Rock when they landed on Plymouth Rock I was with them so was you everybody praise God he said I was right there on Valley Forge I crossed the icy Delaware with a bunch of soldiers I prayed all night with George Washington I crossed the Delaware with a vision in my heart we are American he said I rang the Liberty Bell the first July 4th 1776 I rang the Liberty Bell here and declared that we are independent to be a real American I had to I was identified with her in the Revolutionary so that's what we look at today by God's grace so we'll look at our text again the Bible says blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord and the people whom he has chosen for his inheritance you know recently somebody emailed me about from Africa and emailed me about the condition of his country and I didn't know what to say I didn't know the history of how his country had treated the gospel but I do believe I shared this scripture if I wasn't if I'm not for not for I'm not mistaken that God honors every nation that fears him praise God look at Israel how many times have they tried to wipe them off the map over the last 6,000 years they've just tried each country you know Germany and Russia and different ones have tried to to wipe them off the map right Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iraq different kind of Syria all the nations have tried to wipe them off the map but they can't get rid of them because there's a small group of believers and God is faithful any nation that honors God in righteousness and teaches righteousness God will defend them although they had to suffer you know the Jews for crucifying Jesus Christ he said let the blood be upon us in our children God never forsakes them because they're part of Abraham's natural seed and we know there's a small remnant in there of about 144,000 that's gonna receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so there's a small group there's a little group and that's raising up now I imagine as we as we as we speak and as we preach it's increasing by the maybe the by the tens and the maybe the 20s and 50s year after year just increasing until pretty soon they're gonna have a hundred forty-four thousand that will fully believe the Word of God and of course they'll get the Holy Ghost after the rapture but we look here and see that blessed is a nation whose God is the Lord and righteousness exalts a nation we saw on Sunday how there's never been a nation as prosperous as United States of America and even so to this day you know recently last week the stock market reached its highest level ever so that means prosperity is happening businesses are growing here in America still to this day now of course we know her national debt is I think past twenty trillion if I'm not mistaken so it's a false sense of prosperity but nevertheless the businesses are growing and they're expanding and people are hiring and so we still see traces of this prosperity although we know our doom is eminent we know brother Branham said thus saith the Lord the very god that America claims to serve will destroy her but we know God will never destroy the righteous with the wicked and as long as there's god-fearing people here that are praying on their knees that are reading their Bibles that are singing and worshiping God in spirit and truth God will not let them be destroyed with the wicked amen so thank God for that praise God that we have that hope that God is going to spare all of us praise God that love the Lord no matter what church no matter what state no matter where you are God will be with those who fear Him and God is watching over his people praise God so I'm thankful he's watching over me tonight hallelujah but we are identified with America's founding fathers now around it this this monument I'll read a little bit out of it here a little bit I want to give us some background on it and I'm just gonna read off it if you could I'm not gonna zoom in so that because then you couldn't see it real well but this is a nearly forgotten monument to the forefathers and it actually is a hunt it's 81 feet tall so it's about four storeys tall and it's about 180 tons and some say it's the world's largest solid granite monument so as one piece of granite massive piece and it took 70 years to chisel out these statues in it and all the words 70 years okay it was dedicated in 1889 that means even before the Civil War they started working on this right before the Civil War they found one huge chunk of granite and this was like I say a hundred some years after the pilgrims had died Americans wanted a way to remember how this country started and they wanted they went to all the future generations to remember how was this country blessed why is this country so prosperous and even after the war of 1812 remember that war 1812 it started shortly after that so they had seen my we got victory over the British we got victory over the French we got all these victories how did this happen and the founding fathers knew it wasn't because they were smarter wasn't because they were stronger wasn't because they were better at war it was because God favoured them because they love God's Word amen praise God and so they thought nah how can we make a blueprint to remind future generations on how this country came to be so successful came to be so prosperous what can we do so they voted and spent all this money and over 70 years of chiseling away one one one stone at a time praise God and I'll say I just making this masterpiece praise God hey hey man idea this masterpiece and it's called the matrix of Liberty so the whole point of this is to show how a nation can give true Liberty to the people praise God how a nation can be truly free now think about all the other nations that had slavery now we had slavery for a while but it got eventually got outlawed by Abraham Lincoln praise the Lord and he lived during the time this was being built of course he died before it was finished because he died in 1865 and this wasn't dedicated until 1889 about 30 years 33 years afterwards so this was a great thing and Thomas Jefferson said there's a quote down here it's hard for you to read but it says the price of freedom is eternal vigilance so of course we know vigilance deals with dedication and diligence and watchfulness so if you want freedom if you want true Liberty you've got to be watchful you have to watch and pray you have to stay watchful and make sure the enemy doesn't overtake you praise God that's what we're saying today we're not just talking about the United States of America we're talking about the bride of Jesus Christ amen the Bible says Paul says we must keep a watch for the enemy Satan I'm sorry that's Peter I'm sorry yeah Peter says Satan goes around like a roaring lion seeking Him whom he may devour praise God and so we must be cautious at all times how Satan is trying to distract us praise God from spiritual things if ever need to be spiritual it's now praise the Lord if ever we need to watch and make sure we don't fall away spiritually or get loose in our spiritual life it must be now we must watch now we must pay the price in order to be right with God in order to be on fire with God you've got to pay the price and that's called diligence and I said it he knocks name actually means dedicate I think I said it meant something different on Sunday I think I said it discipline but it means dedicated but she had the same idea Enoch was a man dedicated to Christ for his day right the Holy Spirit the anointing and so after the pilgrims established over their colonies pretty soon you had colonies pretty soon then you had States and after the government had been established they built this monument and it was a just a beautiful memory here of of how to establish a godly nation so you think how come how come how come different countries like we say in South America or Africa or Europe how come they're not blessed or how come they don't have any blessings in their in their countries many times it's because they've disrespected God's Word they've turned it down they've they've shut the mouths of preachers right now it's difficult to it let me say this too it's difficult because there's many Middle Eastern countries that are seemingly prosperous right because they have oil and they have different natural resources but that's just the leaders if you look at just the regular people a lot of them are in poverty and a lot of them are being persecuted right and they're being they're being ruled over by tyrants so what this shows is that Satan controls every Kingdom right same controls every government but the majority of the people will be live under freedom and liberty when righteousness is is established by the leaders praise God and so that's why America has stood well for so long brother Branham said remember in nineteen had it's a revival member in 1906 at Azusa Street but then they turned that revival turn to the next revival down the 50 year jubilee in 1956 but ma'am said they turned it down so see America was blessed it was a Christian nation for a long time but somewhere after 1906 they turned down the revival right and then they started turning it down and then finally they had one last chance fifty years later and they turned it down and they'll never go back and so we've seen just recently it's been a time where the nation has turned its back on God right but see we're still enjoying blessings because the previous generation like brother Ram generation the one before that they live godly right and the generation before us live godly and so we're still reaping the benefits God still has to honor all the generations all the prayers of all the previous generations and church if God honor them that God will honor our prayers for the next generation praise God but but we've got to be just as faithful as the previous generation was praise God and you're gonna see Church this is a challenge to us when we go through some of these things tonight it's a challenge to us because they had a lot more prayer and fasting maybe than we do praise God as we've got to realize if we're gonna be a generation that seeks after God we've got to be more willing to sacrifice more of our time and more of our food and more of our American privileges in order to get the spiritual privileges of Christianity I know that's not popular but listen that's the Laodicea that's the age we're living in praise God but you and I believe God is helping me in my life but if it hasn't happened in your life your life needs to have a pattern of prayer and fasting if you're not constantly prayer and fasting then you're not truly reaching the level of a disciple that you could be Jesus didn't say if you want to fast he said when you fast Jesus say if you might pray he said when you pray any true disciple of Jesus Christ Jesus said when I leave then will my servants fast and that's what this book devotes a couple chapters to it devotes chapters are showing how real Christians fast real Christians realize we have so many natural benefits we've got a we got to get our eyes off the natural benefits and we got to look to heaven for spiritual benefits and that means starving our flesh sometimes and then feeding on spiritual things praise God now that won't get me a big church that won't get me a big amen but it will get me a good amen from the Angels praise God how do you thank the Lord amen so I know if not many people are behind me are on the internet or not many of people are behind me in my my town or anything like that I know one thing I know heavens behind me praise God because I got the word of the Lord praise God amen we have the word of the Lord thank God for that now this is the pattern on how to develop a godly country so let me go ahead and read a little bit about this and I probably see if I can zoom in here let me see if I can maybe there's different parts I can zoom into I think I should be able to yeah all right well that's why I didn't want to do that's why I've got to try to be careful here so it's a four story tall monument and this is 81 feet itself it's pretty massive just this lady faith now there's four human characters on towards the bottom but there's one character at the top and so all this one character we'd say is the most important of all of them and this is how the pilgrims bill America the very top of it is faith so they you can see faith right there so faith is the very first thing it's the first thing you see is this high faith faith is exalted right amen without faith it's impossible to please God amen praise God now Church what his faith also faith is a revelation of the will of God so America was founded on faith it's a woman pointing to heaven see you're pointing to heaven and she's got a book in her hand that represents the Bible praise God now you can't see it there but she's got to start her forehead and I don't know if these pilgrims understood what they were saying there but that star represents the mark jesus said I'll put the mark in their foreheads the seal of God amen the baptism of the Holy go the seal of God in their foreheads amen so a nation that's going to be prosperous the blueprint for how to have a prosperous nation is to have a lady a church who's received Fetty she knows where her faith comes from she know where she come from amen she comes from heaven her revelation comes from heaven and she's born again she's got the seal of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost hmm glory so faith is an member churches the foundation right so the course the foundation here is at the top but when in the snatch program and faith is the foundation you've got to have faith it's impossible to get anywhere with God without faith hallelujah now the next one now there's a special order it's not on this but the next one is morality so the next one's a woman of morality now it's hard to see there but she has no eyes it's as if her eyes were plucked out and that's because she's not looking at natural things morality that doesn't look at the natural things for guidance it has to look inward for guidance so morality there she's look she's not looking to outward things for her for her morality but she's looking at the transformation of her heart she has the Ten Commandments there and she also has the scroll of Revelation amen Safran got faith after you've got this a nation next needs morality and so morality comes from the Ten Commandments right and it comes from the scroll of Revelation amen praise God why because the Ten Commandments give you morals but then Revelation tells you the end of all things what is the end of morality it's being a part of Jesus's bride hallelujah it's being a part of the New Jerusalem oh my that's the end point of morality you got to have the Ten Commandments you got to keep the Word of God you must live the Word of God but you know you know that satan doesn't win this thing satan looks like he's winning right now but you know Jesus Christ is the mighty conquer now you can't see it real good there but underneath you can't see at all there's too little human statues one of them is called the Prophet the RA and one of them is called the Evangelist so you will gain morality by listening to God's prophet and listening to the Evangelist I wish they would have put pastor in there but they did it so maybe but you know you got to have that too so a nation must be I must have faith must be sealed in the forehead and then morality must be established it looks to the inward character you develop inwardly that's why when you pray church you say you close your eyes that God help me to obey help me not to lie help me not this steal and cheat and think evil thoughts you close your eyes because you don't want influence you know what your choice is influenced by what you see you want your choices influenced by what's in your heart that's the Word of God the Holy Spirit so it is the preaching of the Evangelist that establishes morality and it's the prophecy of the Prophet because the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy prophecy gives you morality because you and I know there's a day of judgment coming praise God death is the great equalizer right death it makes everybody the same everybody knows they're going to die in it and you have to like our Taekwondo master set like set it like that when you die no matter how many people around you do it alone really you die alone you come into the world alone and you go out of the world alone so it gives you that more at you got to have morality because you know you've got to face God alone praise God so we get that fir through the Evangelist and the Prophet praise God that's established next so first you gotta have faith and then you must establish morality praise God next is law let me see if I can now this is a man law as a man so once you have faith it produces internal morality and that creates a moral system of law okay so now you're beyond the individual now you see it you're getting out into a community right now you need law and here and they're statues under him statues called justice and mercy so see you must have swift justice and justice is holding the scales of justice right an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth the judgments must be fair right and it must be fair for rich or poor but there's also mercy whereas if someone makes a mistake they can be forgiven and they if they're locked up they can be let loose and they can be back into society and they can live a better life they can live a transformed life praise God now this says in holding the statue of law and extends the hand of mercy law has a warrior spirit with eyes that appear to be looking deep into the heart and the soul of the individual so we know the law must be established praise God there must be a order for society but this can't happen until we have faith right and experience with God recognizing where we come from understanding faith pleases God we've established morality in the individual who doesn't look to the world but looks inside of the heart to the word and then now law can it be established in society next we're almost to the end of this thing is education and education points of the book of knowledge praise God and now that you have civil law now you can educate your children now that the adults you know have order and they they have established what's right and wrong and justice and mercy now you can educate your children now you can't see it there but she's wearing a wreath of victory like the Roman athletes would wear and the Greek athletes there's a wreath of victory and that symbolizes that she's got the victory and this is like a 25 year old mother so when a mother has victory she's victorious because she knows she's trained the children in the law or the Word of God the word of knowledge amen so she's victorious because she's prepared these young children she's trained them up and the things of God and when they're older they won't depart from it so what is Satan done to this world Satan's done to our country he's gone down to the schools right and he's changed the thing that they're being taught right that's how he's now you know Satan's got the wreath he thinks at least with a lot of people with many families Satan's wearing his wreath because he's changed the way that people are educated right so he's done that but this is how the pilgrims knew they had to establish this on faith morality law and then education now underneath her are a picture of another mother holding a child's hand showing how it was the the parents responsibility to guide their children right so in other words uh you know the early pilgrims weren't about just having big school government right they believed in home school that was okay and you know of course it was okay to set him to schools but there had to be the Word of God at the school praise God now we went to public school and God had mercy on us so God will have mercy in this hour but we better be praying praise God if we send our children public school we better be praying if we homeschool we better be praying as well praise God because it's the parents responsibility after you have faith morality in law now it's the parents job to educate them to give them the knowledge they need praise God now so one one side is the the mother with the holding the head of the child on the other side is an old man and he's standing there he's got an open book and it's pointing at open books at his feet and that shows that the elderly have a part two the grandparents have an important part of Education the grandparent we're to look to the older ones for wisdom because they got the books open they know what the book says ain't a head and on the other side of the old man is a globe which shows the old ones should have a knowledge about the world they should know what the world is like and be able to teach the next generation about how to I'll say like this to finish the great commission praise God right that's what the world represents and also a Christian worldview how do we understand nations how do we understand a foreign affairs you understand it by the knowledge gained from the Word of God and the out the older ones should have that good wisdom and good understanding on how to think about world problems praise God and world solutions and every solution lays in the Word of God praise the Lord the church now we're coming down to the end of this so this last picture remember this is called the matrix of liberty this is how the Pilgrims and you can go this that this monument is in Plymouth Massachusetts it's right over looking you know Plymouth Rock where the Pilgrims landed it's overlooking that up on the hill and it's it's got more visitors since Kirk Cameron did his his documentary because it's been hidden people have forgotten about it right people have left the Word of God and they've gone to entertainment they've gone to Sports they've gone to money they've gone to everything except God's Word they've left the pattern the blueprint of God's Word but thank God and every age God has a witness amen hallelujah and this stands as a four story tall witness against this nation for those who will reject God's Word this is God's plan now the last man is called Liberty Man look he's a young man looks out of ice 22 or 21 he's a strong man he's a soldier and he is the fruit of obeying the matrix so if you have faith and then if you have morality law and education you are gonna produce young strong soldiers for the kingdom of God hey Dad hallelujah and he hopes you can't see it here but he holds broken chains so he's so strong that he breaks the yokes amen and the Bible said the anointing breaks the yokes hallelujah so if you want to be delivered from an addiction it takes the anointing of the Holy Spirit praise God now of course they were thinking natural many times of course being free from Great Britain right the chains of the Anglican Church in the England Church and over a shorter you can't see it but there's a skin a hide of a lion and the lion's head skin is at his feet hallelujah so the Bible said Satan's like a roaring lion so this liner can represent two things that can represent Satan that when you when you have all this established in your home in your country you have victory over the evil one because the gates of Hell will not prevail against the church amen it's the church praise God the church is a her praise God the gates of Hell will not prevail against her the church because she's the lady of the top lady faith amen and remember Mystery Babylon was a combination of those three other animals right the line the leopard and the bear so this shows even in their day the day of the the Sardis church age and then also now it goes into Philadelphia Church age it showed that this is how a person of believer gets victory over Mystery Babylon amen with faith morality living the word obeying the law establishing law being educated and taught the things of the the Word of God and then establishing Liberty praise God now just to give you an idea how big that is look how big that is you can see the people down at the bottom look how the God the cause of the small they are so I was looking at like one two three four over four stories tall its massive maybe one day we'll go see it honey we ready somebody say maybe we'll try to go see that Saturday I don't know that's possible but that's what this video documentary teaches about though they wanted to leave this behind this is one solid piece of granite mine 70 years so that all Americans would know this is how you establish Liberty and I just think it's good brother bang that I came out of Liberty Center I just think that my hometown was Liberty center and our nickname is the Sons of Liberty praise God so I just think that's just God gives that to encourage me but I said like this I preached a gospel that sets the captives free Amen because I've seen it I've seen people deliver it as I preach for them do people healed saved as I preached them i baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we preach the gospel of the Liberty the good news of Jesus Christ amen not many will receive it but those that will is the power of God unto salvation for them praise God thank the Lord now I'd like to look at a few ideas on prayer and fasting so now I'm gonna switch over here to the book by Derek Prince and hopefully I can that was a song service I think it was this one there yeah no severing that one oh yes this one Bible club Arrowhead Bible club I had this one there so let's just look at a few donor Rita a little bit of history on prayer and fasting we showed how the pilgrims prayed and fasted and God heard that member at the the drought they had in 1623 I think it was their third or or second summer there and they're gonna lose all their crops and it could mean death and they set aside a day of prayer and fasting and they prayed all day the Native Americans are like yeah right like nothing's gonna happen but then God answered with a nice gentle storm and a lot of rain water and the crops were saved and the Native Americans were amazed that God had answered and so that was prayer and fasting was part of their their history as part of their way to seek God now I want to look at a few things here let's look at George Washington first in May of 1774 the British Parliament had ordered an embargo on the port of Boston Massachusetts but then the House of Burgesses of Virginia passed a resolution protesting this act and setting aside the day of June first as a Day of Prayer how humiliation and fasting so in other words the leaders in America of course we had informed our government yet leaders in America were like we're not we don't want this embargo we don't want this tax so they said let's set aside a day of Prayer humiliation and fasting and it was ordered in 1774 that everyone submit to this and it was ordered by George Washington even before he was president he said that on the first day of June that it says to go to the to each person go to the church in his own City for the purposes of fasting humiliation prayer devoutly to implore the divine interposition for averting that heavy commodity which threatens the destruction of our civil rights and that each person read prayers and lists and pre and listen to sermons and preach sermons suitable for the occasion so in other words they could sense wars on the horizon so we need to pray and ask God God help us to miss out on this war please let us not go to war and so they set aside that day George Washington in his diary wrote these words 1 2 3 4 5 he wrote 7 words in his diary that day and it was says this went to church and fasted all day that was George Washington's diary entry for June 1st 1774 amen praise God and we were in one of those churches in Williamsburg I don't know if it was that one but we were in a church where the the founding fathers met right at the time of the revolution but before deciding so it might it must have been 1775 or something along those lines they prayed and fasted all day in that church Washington not only believed in prayer for divine intervention but he also pray believed in acknowledging such intervention when prayer was answered so a few years later now this is a different one I don't think I have this one up there no I don't but a few years later in 1795 once he was president he set aside a day a National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving in 1795 ok so about 21 years later and he said we want to make a day of devout reverence affectionate gratitude to acknowledge our many and great obligations to Almighty God and to implore him to continue and confirm the blessings we experienced amen amen so he saw that the blessings okay we won the or we won the Revolutionary War we defeat the Britons or the British he's but less devoted damn Thanksgiving and also in this day of Thanksgiving let's give him thanks and ask that the blessings continue Church we got to keep coming to church and thanking God saying God let your blessings continue let my health continue let let us continue to win souls every now and then praise God that miracles signs and wonders continue we need to ask for these things to continue we got to ask for it Amen if we don't ask we're not going to receive because that's the order you got to ask and then you receive praise God so he set aside the thirteenth I'm sorry yeah the thirteenth day I'm so the nineteenth day of February 1795 as a national day of Thanksgiving in prayer to follow up and give thanks he said I we will render their sincere and hearty thanks to the great ruler of nations for his manifest and signal mercies which distinguished our lot as a nation and at the same time humbly and reverently to beseech the kind of--the ER of these blessings to graciously prolong them to us to imprint on our hearts a deep and solemn sense of our obligations to him for them to teach us to rightly estimate their immense value to preserve us from the arrogance of prosperity that's what we need praise God amen God keep us for being arrogant and prideful help us remember where all these blessings come from hallelujah help us to establish habits of sobriety order morality and piety and finally to impart all the blessings we possess or ask for ourselves to the whole family of mankind so George Washington was praying not just for his nation but the blessings of Christianity to flow to every nation praise God I'm gonna jump a little bit to our second president John Adams we United States were coming to the verge of open war with France in 1798 so that was three years after this damned prayer and fasting to George Washington established but on March 23rd 1798 he proclaimed May 9th then that same year so - in two months in advance as a day of solemn humiliation fasting in prayer and John Adams wrote this we pray for safety and prosperity of Nations ultimately essentially depend on the protection and the blessing of Almighty God and the National acknowledgement of this truth is not only an indispensable duty which the people owe to him how many oh god that Amen I owe God that but a duty whose natural influence is favorable to the promotion of that morality and piety he said under these considerations it has appeared to me that the duty of employing the mercy and benediction of heaven on our country demands at this time a special attention from its inhabitants so he said I I proclaim a day of solemn humiliation fasting in prayer that the citizens of these United States abstain on that day from their customary worldly occupations and offer their devote addresses to the fathers of Mercy praise God in our deepest humility acknowledged before the god I serve before God the manifold sins and transgressions which we are justly chargeable as individuals and as a nation beseeching him at the same time his infinite grace through the Redeemer of the world freely to remit all of our offences and to Incline in us by His Holy Spirit that the sincere repentance and Reformation which may afford us reason to hope for his inestimable favour and heavenly benediction he raised God and they say these guys didn't believe in God nonsense they just don't know there praise God this don't read history praise God's there you have the first president the second president both designating days of prayer and fasting now of course you know they never went to war with France right God kept them from that so see the god ants when they fasted and prayed God heard their prayers the church I read this or I heard this today on a documentary when George Washington had them fat it was 3 million Americans on their knees pray amen hallelujah and look how hard it is hard is it to get one church to get on their knees fasting and praying how hard is it today just one church ours or another one how hard is it but see they were so sincere they were so believing God's Word they were so honest before God three million people got on their knees fasted and prayed and God gave him a victory the Revolutionary God gave him a victory over France look at the power of Prayer praise God three million people on their knees of course you know what God did with Daniel one man on his knees look at God did with Daniel God said the angel gave him the Daniel seventy weeks God God showed him all these revelations show where the lot his people would be in their end time and he showed him all this the future things mine he showed them the enemy shortened God Daniel saw the white throne judgment amen hallelujah Daniel Chapter seven so one man dedicated to God in prayer and passing can receive great revelations but look how much more can be done if we do it collectively so we think we think we sacrifice a lot now let's remember how much they sacrificed went to church all day and fasted and prayed George Washington said listen to preaching all day prayed all day saying all day didn't eat all day that's that's our first president praise God all right let's get jump ahead to our fourth president now in 1815 America was on the verge with another war with Britain they want some more fighting they hadn't had enough they wanted some more but this story has a miracle right the other two you know they prayed and fasted but they had to fight that fight and then the first one they got the Revolutionary War the second one they defeated France before was a big war but this one is a story of God answering their prayers even before the day of prayer and fasting and that fulfills Isaiah and I know this applies to the millennium and the future home but it was kind of fulfilled at this time because Isaiah 65 24 says and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they're yet speaking I will hear oh that's just like Eliezer Amen remember at least I just read that this week Eliezer is saying God let the woman that comes out and feeds my camel and then feeds the others let her be the the wife for my servant son Isaac and the Bible said while he praying that Rebecca walks out and says hey can I feed your camels amen I'm an alien race God that's the power of the Holy Spirit why are you praying many times God can answer while we pray praise God so James Madison saw a war on the horizon with Great Britain in church he set a date was Thursday a April I don't know the day as a Thursday in now the second Thursday in April 1815 he proclaimed a great day of fasting and prayer he said that got to Almighty God for his great goodness manifesting and restoring to them the blessing of peace they were starting to get rumors of war and this President James Madison here right yes sorry sometimes getting mixed up so let's pray for peace and we're gonna set aside a day for peace but four days before this day the last battle of this war was fought at New Orleans resulting in a victory for the United States phrase god amen so Madison Saturday let's pray for peace but before they got to that day for dad for a dead horse a number of deliverance amen hahaha amen four days before they prayed and fasted the war that little Wars got squelch right they got ended and peace prevailed at the four days before the day they were gonna pray for peace what great testimonies godly men now I didn't have time to get Lincoln's up here let me just close up close with Lincoln's here Lincoln did a few days of prayer and fasting - all right so I'm Lincoln fast forward to some hundred years here of course this is while that monument was being built right now Liberty matrix-y was being built Abraham Lincoln had at least three separate days of national humiliation prayer and fasting of course the prime cause of each was a civil war and the central theme of a petition was for the restoration of national peace and unity Lincoln in these at Lincoln's first proclamation was requested by Joint Committee of both both houses of Congress and the day set apart was the last Thursday in September 1861 the following is a part of his Proclamation he said I'm recommending a day of public humiliation prayer and fasting to be observed by the people United States with religious solemn matisse and the offering of fervent supplications to Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these states his blessing on their arms see he wanted God's blessings on their guns he wasn't trusting in the guns he was trusting in the God behind the guns praise God because it's God the Lord of Hosts right we sing about the Lord of Hosts he's the one that sets the chariots of fire praise God merry men and the speedy restoration of peace he said it is fit and becoming in all people at all times look at this 1861 church all people all times to acknowledge and revere the supreme government of God to bow in humble submission to the his chastisements to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions in the full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and to pray and withal fervency and contrition for the pardon of their past offenses and for blessings upon their present and prospective action amen I saying repent of all the past and look for God's leadership in your life right now he said I Abraham Lincoln president United States do a point in the last Thursday in September next as a day of humiliation prayer and fasting for all the people the nation and I recommend to all the people especially to all the ministers and the teachers of religion of all denominations and to all the heads of families to observe and keep that day according to their several Creed's and modes of worship in all humility and with all religious solemn duty to the end that the United prayer of the nation may ascend to the throne of grace amen and may bring down plentiful blessings upon our country hey hey man praise God he said I implore all people to assemble in their preferred places of what public worship on that day and there and then to render to the Almighty and merciful ruler of the universe such homages is it homage is homages homage and such confessions and to offer to him such supplications as the Congress of the United States have so solemnly so earnestly and so reverently recommended now Church OB see now this is one historical fact from the beginning of the pilgrims time in the United States all the way up to here the Civil War history says there was over 1,000 days of prayer and fasting that were assigned by the leaders of either you know the pilgrims or the United States the president's 1,000 days of prayer and fasting and sometimes we get discouraged coming to church three times a week right because life gets hard we get you know mind battles we struggle but if we want to see God's blessings continue we have to talk to God we have to clean up our lives amen we got to keep vigilant praise the Lord amen we got to following the pattern of God's holiness praise God and living how God would have us to live now I'm closing let me do a couple scriptures that I close here go to first Timothy chapter 2 let's read this again first Timothy chapter to verse one now I hope this helps you see Church why why brother Branham would say I would be honored to fight for this country remember program tried to sign up for the Second World War remember that they said we got enough guys already your clergy you're in your late 30s you know you need to stay and don't go over he said he wanted to he said it would've been an honor to go and fight and die for this country and Abraham Lincoln is like Lord be the the strength behind our arms right so you can see how God is the one moving even in the natural armies God many times with the righteous nation he's the one behind them and there's nothing wrong with that because you have to protect what God has given to you praise God now 1st Timothy 2 verse 1 now look at the order here I now remember this is the same chapter where he says women can't preach this is the same chapter where he says women need to wear modest clothes right and Adam was the one who sinned right he's the one that was he wasn't a seed he said willfully Adams mistake of course we know he did it to save Eve part of him it's the same chapter verse 1 i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men so Paul is laying out 2 Timothy this is how you hold a church this is how you live a godly life the first thing we're established on is prayer and prayer for all men praise God Catholic Rite Methodist pray for sinners the thing that this our house needs to be a house of prayer praise God if you know anyone that needs prayer bring them here you should come early and pray for people here praise God when we're United you should we should pray and have our minds on other people because Paul says first of all pray for all men verse 2 now look what he goes through now for Kings we should pray for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty amen look at all these that what are they praying for they're praying for peace God give us peace yet there's enemies out there but God will use the enemies to drive us to our knees to pray for peace amen hallelujah verse three for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior see God wants us to live a peaceful life but we do it by prayer if we're having battles in our homes if we're having battles in our families it's making us want to pray it's you guys using that so we'll pray for peace praise God now we had that in our life you know whenever we first came in the message there was arguments in my family there was arguments on all sides and it brought us to prayer right I mean what does those things drive you to it drives you to prayer because you don't want and thank God you don't God use his time you know time well many times cool people off praise God but it was through the prayers right prayer for peace prayer for that we can live our lives how we feel led to do and fulfill the Great Commission and do our part and teach our children praise God amen do that third step right with that fourth step of Education do that prepare God wants a generation prepared so we need peace to prepare the next generation that's part of God's plan amen we need years of peace to train up these children to take four so they later on can take the gospel elsewhere praise God we need years of peace to do that hallelujah amen all right go back to Luke 19 now preach on this recently as a parable of the kingdom this is the parable of the pounds let's go back to the Luke 19 verse 11 remember this parable he was talking to Jews and they thought my the kingdom of God is going to come right now and Jesus kinda had to cool them off say put on put on your brakes boys it ain't happening right now he was going to tell them that he you know if the Jews were to take the kingdom I'm gonna give it to the Gentiles but here's a thought that one of these documentaries brought out I really liked it he said a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called his ten servants and delivered them 10 pounds and said unto them occupy till I come but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called in him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading so I want to just close with that thought on occupy till i come so stay on our feet here having been closed or a be dismissed in just a moment here he said occupy until I come let me look up the Greek word I didn't forget to do that let me look it up real quick here occupy means too busy oneself with to trade to occupy so God has given each of us natural money but also spiritual talents as we looked at last month and the previous month's and Jesus didn't say be a pushover and just be lazy and don't do anything Jesus said occupy he said pray for those that are in the government pray for those that are ruling so you can live a quiet and peaceable life and preach the gospel and get the next generation to hear the word of God occupy that's my church I believe we should pray for our leaders in America we should vote people say now people say the voting is rigged how can it be rigged especially with last presidential election they wanted a Hillary Clinton to win right so how is it rigged it's not rigged as far as I can see because God is the one the Bible said God is the one who raises up and takes down even if it was rigged before God will sue you so use it too he'll use it to bring justice and he'll use it to ultimately bring about his prophecy but Jesus Christ said occupy take the goods I've given you protect it in other words fight for invest in it right fight the good fight of faith we're supposed to keep peace in our homes right we're supposed to establish morality and then educate our children and and keep the law of God and that will produce men and women that love the liberty of the Holy Spirit amen how do you praise God amen praise the Lord so I got a whole lot more Lord willing we'll get two on Sunday by God's grace did you like that was that helpful I know it's a lot of history Church but we got to do that we got to look at back at history we have to see we have to learn from history praise God so you can switch over there now let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer here let's remember that little monument I should say little let's remember that massive monument for a moment are we keeping God's command in this pattern now this is that we'd say the final pattern but it is a great look at how to establish real liberty and freedom as a Christian first thing is faith have we received a revelation from heaven then we got to establish morality godly habits in our lives that will make us obey the laws the land it or make us respect our government it will lead us to train the next generation so it's so important to chain that next generation and the effects of that will be people that really experience the power and the Liberty the Holy Spirit as Paul said we're the spirit Lord is theirs what church Liberty amen thank the Lord praise God we're the spirit of Jesus Christ is there's real Liberty let's have water prayer think about your life church Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight we thank you for this word
