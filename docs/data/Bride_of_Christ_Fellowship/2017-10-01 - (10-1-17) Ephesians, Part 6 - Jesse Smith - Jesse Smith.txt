mother passed away a few weeks ago and just got to picked up the card yesterday I've been pretty busy so I forgot to pick up the card but we got it today by the grace of the Lord and also we had a great service great services last week at the sisters meeting in New York and Pennsylvania was a tremendous time in the Lord and I share a little bit on Wednesday but it's just a great time great to be with Saints meet a lot of new Saints and to see the Holy Spirit move and bless people and help people and strain than them after brother Brooks preached on Saturday night seven sisters said they received the Holy Ghost they're raising their hands shout and praising God and sister got healed she couldn't raise her left arm and she got healed on Friday night then after the service so it was just great to see God moving on the scene I mean oh he wants to move on the scene today praise God and help us all with our our needs because he's a loving father Ephesians chapter 2 my Bible here by God's grace now I've had a lot of traveling time lately like last week I'd spent a lot of time on airplanes and everything sigh I was going back through my old notes and I've seen some numerous series I never finished I want to start back up a series I was preaching on the Ephesian the book of Ephesians so kind of felt led to preach on that of course Wednesday we looked at the book of life for our church age series but this one's about a year old I stopped preaching this on July of 2016 and I want to pick it up this morning I was reading yesterday and studying and I just felt this was inspiring to me so let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 and I left off in chapter 2 I left off with the scripture about verse 14 so let's pick up at 14 we're left off at the middle wall partition I don't expect you to remember that it was about a year ago but I just want to briefly review a little bit and then we'll move on into chapter finished at chapter 2 Lord willing and maybe begin chapter 3 how many love the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart let me love this good Holy Bible amen it's full it's free from errors this is the infallible Word of God so let's look at this Ephesians 2:14 if you're there say Amen let's read 14 together and then I'll read 15 by myself read verse 14 one two three four he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall partition between us I'll just read verse 15 that will be done having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace art so glad for the peace of God this morning let's just bow our heads you've haven't eaten your heart just make it known unto God have any father we love you Lord God this old-time religion makes us love everybody it makes us stop our sinning Lord God it lines us back up with the Word of God we're so grateful for that and nor one thing this Holy Spirit will make the devil fly hallelujah because as we cleave in obedience to the Holy Word of God Satan it must flee because we resist him with the Word of God we thank you Lord Jesus for this holy word father for our visitors and it's good to have our sister Wendy back and Lord is good to see all the Saints this morning Lord God father we just ask Lord that you minister by your Holy Spirit take me out of your way Lord God let your will be done we know you chose the five gifts of the fivefold ministry to perfect your church father may we get in line and may we all pull upon the Word of God to see what the spirit would say to us this morning father we're grateful Lord for this opportunity father we know the angels of God are here to write down our requests Lord and take them up to the throne of God Lord and we just want to Lord you want to get in unity with what the Holy Spirit would have us to say this morning and Lord have us to do so thank you Lord for your mercy bless us now in your divine presence in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you Jimmy and see their praise the Lord I just have a few pictures I'm going to review a little bit all right so we're happy to be in the House of Lords by God's grace it's good to be with everybody again and we went out like I said I want to pick this up I've been going back through my old notes and a lot of time just go through notes you know when you when you go into a meeting like last week's meeting I mean the Holy Spirit could bring out anything to preach you know so I was just digging through the notes and I thought okay I need to finish the Ephesians series and there's a couple more I need to finish by God's grace but I just kind of felt led to study on that and as I said I was studying different things and this was what kind of inspired me so I'd like to go with this this morning let's do a brief review you know the reason I started preaching on you know the book of Galatians and Ephesians was because those are the letters that give us the Apostolic Faith they lay the foundation for believers right we know that's in Scripture let's go to second Peter 3 let's read this briefly second Peter 3 verse 15 you know it would have been quite a thing Church and I just like if we could use our spiritual imaginations this morning it must have been quite a thing to live in the days of pompey Terr because like Peter says here they were receiving Paul's letters as the Word of God they were receiving it as Scripture most letters of course obviously 99.9% the letters you would receive in that day were not Scripture they were just regular letters you might have received but when they got a letter from Paul or and they got to listen to a letter that was written by Peter all of a sudden it was it was time to check up with God they had to handle this letter like it was the Word of God coming from the throne of God does every understand and so by God's grace if we could just tap into that same type of thought that same sincerity where we come to church and yeah we know this letters are 2,000 years old but there's power within those letters to speak to us today and we need to hear what the Spirit is saying through those letters because it will minister to our needs today if we're really trusting and believing in God we have to have that confidence look what he says in 3 verse 15 an account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you so this group of Christians had already received a letter from Paul now they're receiving a letter from Peter my the messenger to the Jews Peter and the messenger to the Gentiles Paul and Peter recognizes this man uses great wisdom how many want more wisdom of God well you come to the right place you come to the Word of God amen Paul's letter the wisdom of God you know even Peter has to recognize it I've got the keys but he's got the great wisdom of God he has the the mystery of the dispensation to the Gentiles verse 16 as also in all his epistles so see there had been more than one they did receive numerous epistles of Paul speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction so we see a few things want to point out in here that Paul wrote things that were so deep in wisdom and understanding that even Holy Ghost field Christians had a hard time understanding them so don't feel bad if you read the book of Romans by ever ever read Romans lately or second Corinthians Witcher or some some books that contains some deep some deep principles we'd say but even Holy Ghost Christians struggle to understand some of these things and so we understand that they but they receive it though as the Word of God but I want you to notice those that are destroyed they take the scripture and they make it say what they want instead of just saying what the scripture says we need to be a church that just says what the scripture says we don't change the scripture and this is how you know it's always what's called the word des you give the word test in the mouth of two or three window says that every word be established so when someone comes teaching something you never heard before you've got to examine that and take that back to the Word of God and there must be two or three witnesses about that teaching from the Word of God if not you can just brush it off and say that's a false doctrine I'm not gonna spend my time on that let the blind lead the blind I'm following Christ and so this is the understanding they had a false preacher will not just twist one scripture he'll start twisting more and more scriptures right because the Bible said they will increase unto more ungodliness remember we looked at that a few weeks ago from second Timothy that's what happens once they twist one thing wrong if they don't repent of that false doctrine that spirit they feed that spirit it gets worse and worse and worse their lives get more ungodly and ungodly and it increases unto more ungodliness amen but I want you to see that there it was so important when they when they receive that letter you know they had a seal around it you know like you we know in the seven seals when they would break that seal my think about that by they didn't have the revelation of the seven seals yet but they had seals breaking around Paul's letters around around Peter's letters they break that seal and unroll and now they would have the revelation of what was contained in that book amen hallelujah makes me rejoice thinking about that because we've had the spiritual revelation of the seven seals revealed to us amen so true amen now let's go back to Ephesians here I just want to lay that in there they knew this was the Word of God they knew a man is led by the Holy Ghost to write the word and we are the beneficiaries of this word amen we're receiving the true Word of God and that's what happens with you and I in our day God the Bible said God has restored the faith of the fathers so that means most churches today don't preach what they actually preach in the book of Galatians in the book of Ephesians and Colossians Colossians most churches today do they twist the scriptures and make it say something that they want to say so they can live in their lusts but the Holy Spirit in real believers will rightly divide the word and teach the truth that we might live in obedience which is living in righteousness amen so I want to start again now by after that I want to say that as you know Paul wrote this letter from prison he was either an accessory in prison or he was in the Roman prison or the house arrest that he was in an X 28 they're not sure which prison he wrote it from but Paul wrote this book from prison we get that in a few scriptures through three verse one he says he's the prisoner of the Lord for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles we also see in chapter four verse one I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called he's a prisoner and then chapter 6 verse 20 chapter 6 verse 24 which I am in an ambassador in Bonn see he's in bondage right now can you imagine being a prisoner and and then writing letters and your letters are the Word of God I mean this is just such an amazing story when you look at the life of Paul he's an ambassador's in bonds now look at verse 20 that there and I may speak boldly as I ought to speak so see Paul reek recognizes I'm in prison and I'm not as bold as I need to be they said may God help me to have the bonus that I need Church there's times we lose our boldness sometimes we lose it and our homes sometimes we lose bonus on the job but one thing about a Holy Ghost filled Christian they're supposed to pray for more boldness that's what they did in Acts chapter 4 after they got persecuted and before the council they went back rejoicing and prayed and said God give us more boldness so just because we lose our boldness that might not mean we're not born again it just means we need a refreshing of the Holy Spirit praise God how many can say amen to that so if you haven't been bold lately there's hope for you Paul's in prison he's saying God I'm not as bold as I need to be the Holy Spirit help me suck and be more bold even in prison amen he's in bonds he's a prisoner for Christ and program teaches you don't have to be in an actual prison to be a prisoner of Christ but every Christian should be a prisoner to the will of God amen that means every day you can't do what you want to do you only do what Christ tells you to do you only do what the Spirit says you're to do how many want to be a prisoner for Christ all but this world are so many temptations we must constantly crucify the lusts of the flesh and the affections thereof amen we must constantly make sure we're living for other people we're not living for ourselves it's so easy to live for ourselves today we must live for others hallelujah so this is a letter from prison and a man named Takei 'kiss or tikki cos I don't know how to say that he was a pause letter carrier you see that in chapter 6 verse 21 let's read that just so I got it but that ye also may know my affairs and how I do take I kiss tychicus tick I kiss I don't know a beloved brother and faithful minister Lord shall make known to you all things whom I have said unto you for the same purpose that he might know our fares and that he might comfort your hearts praise the Lord so see Takei cos I just say our brother t maybe I'll say that our brother T our brother T would visit Paul in the prison and I've also read other things where ever fruss he's named in the book of Colossians remember I profess that's this is a wonderful name there - I love those names but Epirus had let Paul know about the conditions of these churches around Ephesus and and where the Colossians were living and he reported that he went to visit Paul and I profess reported the net profess went back and then Takei kiss a brother t he he was there ministering the Paul in his bonds Paul's of prison or house arrest he's there ministering and so Paul writes two quick letters I'm sorry at least one quick letter Colossians was like a quickly written letter there's over 150 scriptures that are word-for-word in Colossians that are actually in Ephesians but Ephesians is the longer letter and as I was reading through this history I just got inspired man this is this is powerful this is we need to know this amen we need to know what they went through to bring us the true Word of God because then we'll appreciate it more how many one appreciate your Bible more I don't want to read your Bible more how many want to have a more sacred feeling when you wake up in the morning and say it's my time with Jesus these men were in jail for it these men were rugged men that sacrificed everything their wives would have to go without their husbands I mean these were rugged men all because of the Word of God Christianity was the most persecuted religion of this time and it was not popular being a Christian like it is today there was no prosperity gospel back then if you're a Christian you're automatically persecuted God help us to live above that nonsense God help us to live a rugged life amen to keep our eyes on the cross amen this is the kind of life they lived so Takei 'kiss would sit there and wait to her Paul to get the anointing and write the letter and then he Paul would you know through the bars or through maybe through the door I've even heard recently that when Paul was in house arrest and I looked this up I heard a preacher used a very trustworthy preacher he said when Paul was under house arrest he was actually chained to the guard the Roman guard chained so they were changing at the wrists or somewhere at the foot so can you imagine Paul having to take a bath or you know wash off and he's got this guy chained to him can you imagine that you know just taking care of business writing the letters I wonder if that guy got saved while Paul was writing those letters I wonder he's under that anointing they're chained he was a prisoner in bonds for Christ amen and this is the kind of atmosphere he lived under and he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was a man of God he was a dispensation of the Gentiles yet he went through really ten struggles and persecutions but he went through all that so he could be more like Jesus Christ god help us to go through our persecutions with joy that we might be more like Christ because our afflictions are light afflictions and you know who said that Paul is the one who said that Paul said my afflictions are light afflictions so what are ours ours or ours or feather afflictions then if his are light afflictions ours would be feather afflictions now we know their mind bounds they're intense mind battles it's the greatest battle ever fought but there's no real persecution like physical persecution that'd be the hardest persecution there would have to be because Jesus says that in the Sermon on the Mount blessed are those who are persecuted for my name's sake remember that rejoice because great is your reward in heaven amen so while we have light affliction our affliction is not the same of course as those days but we know it's coming to the u.s. we know persecution is coming and it's thus saith the Lord it's coming so we got to be prepared we never know the day in the hour that's right now so Takai kiss would make everything known from Paul to the church can you imagine Takei cos carrying that word I've got the revelation I've got the fresh revelation of God's Word for this hour huh I can imagine he must have been running along skipping along I've got the word I've got the message for the hour mine we can do the same thing when we got message books right or a church age mode we've got the word of the hour amen and we can give it to others praise God amen now I want to move past this now and get back to our some of our scriptures here too the the message is the central messages of Ephesians the book of Ephesians the central messages can name off a few themes Redemption God's intervention to man through grace predestination reconciliation union with christ the holy walk the recreation of the christian family and the walk and service and warfare of the believer Amen honey appreciate this book amen had to recreate the family and so he did it through the writings of Paul in Ephesians chapter 5 my goodness in chapter 6 hard to show us what our Warfare's like do we have on the full armor of God amen we know Peter put it on on the day of Pentecost holiday yeah he went up to the the day of Pentecost and he got filled with the Holy Ghost and the Prophet said he put on the full armor of God now he's ready to stand there and fight with the sword of the Spirit praise God beforehand he would lose his testimony before Widow not widow girls a little worker girls he was a little maids he would he couldn't stand like he needed to stand but he went up to Pentecost and he got on the full armor of God that's what we need today the full armor of God we need people praying that are always praying in the spirit praise God they have the helmet of salvation they know they're saved the belt of the truth their minds are centered on the truth of God's Word amen they're ready to answer because they've got the thoughts of God in their minds their feet are shod they're ready to go anywhere at any time to do something for the kingdom of God amen and most of all he said have the shield of faith the shield of faith is the confidence in God's word that no dart of the enemy can this can break through faith conquers hallelujah faith is our victory amen that's our shield is faith in Christ word hallelujah now let me get now to back to the scripture and I had it in my mind this morning I had in my mind to just reread all chapter 1 that'd be okay okay you know we're supposed to read a chapter every morning I don't know if you did but if you didn't here's your chapter let's read it I'm just gonna stop in a few moments and pull out a few thoughts visions 1 verse 1 hallelujah God's has mercy Church we want to be as dedicated as we can right but God is merciful Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus I can imagine Tai Chi cooter Takei kiss open that the faithful in Christ Jesus the ones that are staying with Paul the ones that are staying with brother Branham amen we must stay with God's messenger for the Sowers ever understand that you stay with the messenger for your hour then to stand with Moses glory let us stay with Joshua than to stay with Gideon that they stay with all these men of God and to stay with Daniel and to stay with all these men and today we stand with God's prophet amen verse two grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ if we're missing a blessing today we know God has already given it to us we've just got to get where two heavenly places and heavenly places program so does this believer spiritual position in Christ it's when you're walking in the spirit you're under the anointing but how many believe the how many oh the Bible says all blessings are given to you where's my blessings well they're in heavenly places you got to get caught up in the atmosphere got to get caught up in the Holy Spirit that's where you'll find your blessings hallelujah according verse 4 this is one of those beautiful scriptures according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world amen where did God choose me in his mind before the foundation of the world Paul couldn't write this to everybody right he couldn't write this to the Corinthian church he had to ride it to a deep mature church the ephesian church that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so if you were in the mind of God in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world you will live a holy life because he's called you to a holy life and holy means separate free from sin right I mean set apart hallelujah sacred verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen my destinations already been predetermined by the Amen its predetermined where was it determined in God's mind Amen if I came from out of God that's where I'm going back I'm going back to amen and God ordained to determine everything that would happen all the situations that I would shine forth his light and I'd bring forth fruit in my season amen it's exactly right for each one of us were predestinated unto this adoption verse 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the eleventh the loved' what beautiful words he has made us accepted amen we didn't make ourselves accepted he made us accepted amen in whom we have redemption through his blood hallelujah the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace what can wash away your sins nothing but the blood of Jesus nothing not your good conduct not your good character not how holy we live but first they're washed away by the blood of Christ amen now look at verse 8 this is I want to just emphasize these things again wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence so God has abounded toward us that means God has revealed himself to us God has come to us he's abounded to us in what all wisdom and prudence when you come to church you should look for wisdom what's the wisdom of God telling me my current situation praise the Lord because he is abounded towards us in other words he's kind of come up and greeted us right he sees he's made an effort to come to us that mean we might receive all the blessings and all the wisdom Oh aren't you glad about that he's abounded toward us he made a move towards us we didn't seek after God God sought us amen having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself God makes known the personal will for our lives he makes it known to us his will verse 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance glory I mean no you got treasure in heaven yeah there's inheritance you already have obtained the Bible said you've already got it right God knows what you're gonna do God knows your works you've already obtained it it's yours we should rejoice in that amen I've got inheritance I've got a home over yonder praise God I've got a mansion in that beautiful city praise God you understand I've got eternal body hallelujah there's inheritance for me in the home of God being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will if God allowed it in your heart we should thank her God allowed something to happen your life you should thank God for it this was predestinated to happen as hard as this is or as difficult as the struggle is God predestined this to happen guess what God predestinated this service right here and the church said all things are predestinated oh let's let's get the word let's catch the Word of God hallelujah yes that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ hallelujah so our lives should glorify Him that's why we sing and raise our hands and praise God our lies are for God's glory verse 13 in whom he also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation who in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise this is one of the major doctrines and ephesians for us in this our people are not born again the Holy Ghost just because they're saved you can be saved without being born again praise God the Holy Ghost baptism it comes after you've served God and you're justified you're baptized you're sanctified and then at some time after that then you get filled with the power of God and then you are sealed to the day of your Redemption you won't go back into the world you're sealed you're locked into Christ there's no going back you burned every Bridge you're a servant of Christ amen you're sealed in your whole body spirit and soul our Christ hallelujah that's one of the great mysteries laying in here so many churches teach oh you got saved oh now you're filled with the Holy Spirit no you're not you need to have a cleanse out sanctified life before you can be filled with the whole spirit look at the disciples they served Christ for three and a half years and still weren't fill at the Holy Spirit they need a little more sanctifying and they got it when Jesus except their weaknesses be exposed right they got a little more sanctification why did I don't know how didn't have what I thought I had and sometimes God will let us realize why I didn't have what I thought I had I thought I was stronger with this I thought I had more victory than this I thought I was above this and gotta let things happen he arranges everything to show us where we are that we might look to him for more wisdom more bonus more strength amen hallelujah God has to expose our weaknesses like you did with Peter and all the disciples has to show us where were weak so he might be strong amen now verse 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the earnest or down payment of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession which is our eternal body unto the praise of his glory wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints I hope people could say about our church open brother Brian visit last week I hope you saw my they just all love each other hallelujah that's what the Saints you do they should love everybody praise God they should love all the Christians amen beautiful cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you and my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him amen see how Paul keeps emphasizing this wisdom revelation knowledge we should all be growing in these things the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints do we often think about that you often think about the inheritance that lays for us in heaven we need to set our affections on things above amen there's a perfect body there's white robes praise God there's houses to be built during the praise God there's Thrones for us to sit on if we're faithful to Christ we must there's crowns for us to wear amen glory and there's also crowns for us to throw at the feet of Jesus amen Oh hallelujah but we must think about the things above the inheritance that lays before us as we run the race verse 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe this is where we need help brother have said this is where we need help in America in America the prophets said our biggest hindrance is fear that God won't keep his word Christians are so afraid God's not going to keep his word God won't answer my prayer but here Church let it be a strength to us this morning that we have exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe in you say amen to that what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power how many want the mighty power of Christ flowing through them absolutely I want it not just from service to service but we want to see it every day praise God power to cast down temptations power to love when it's hard right power to forgive when it's hard to forgive there's mighty power the Bible said exceeding great power that's given to us who believe praise God hope you come here for power this morning amen because if you if you came here you're gonna leave with it praise God power to face any situation because all spiritual blessings are for you and I today all spiritual blessings if we're missing one then we got to get in the heavenly places we got to get in the spirit we got to get in God's thoughts amen that's right verse twenty which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also and that which is to come and have put all things under his feet to give and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all aren't you glad to be a part of the body of Christ Christ is the head and were the body Amen always was if I'm the body of Christ I want to do what the head tells me to do I want to pack out the orders that the head is telling me to do praise God amen chapter two now you read your chapter right there's a good chapter we all hopefully ready to listen to the chapter this morning hey man now I think what I'm gonna do now cuz I've already bought going about a half hour okay I think I'm gonna do now is uh I'm gonna jump ahead to where we left off there's a chapter now remember let's go to chapter four chapter two verse fourteen we'll go back to that middle wall partition Malachi can switch over now back thanks for switching over to the scriptures I like that that's really good so everybody can see those I just want to review this briefly and then we'll get into we'll finish chapter to it and start chapter three chapter two verse 14 he's our peace who has who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us now there's a middle wall of partition between us there we go now remember we looked at this about a year ago the middle wall partition now the Bible said Christ broke this down there's a middle wall partition how many member that by God's grace anybody member okay maybe not all right so last year we showed this this was the temple of Herod of course in the days of Jesus I'm sorry this was the Temple of Solomon yeah because Herod's wasn't as large as that this is a temple of Solomon so outside of the walls here you're inside the walls you have the court of the Gentiles Gentiles could only go this close to God they could never go in and experience we'd say the sacrifices they can never experience the holy worship they were kept at a distance they were cut out because there were Gentiles they were unclean they didn't meet God's requirements that sound familiar like you and I we didn't meet God's requirements did we we were filthy without God without law without the word we had no promises and this great big wall here part of the building is called the great wall of partition if you remember and there was a warning written on the middle wall partition remember that warning it looked like this this is kind like a copy of it nearly rub it you know they rub it what's it called I forget because stone rubbing or something like that I forget what they caught now here's what it says that's in a foreign language it's called the stones of warning here's what it said no foreigner is to go beyond the balustrade and the plaza of the temple zone who suffers caught doing so will have himself to blame for his death which will follow so let's go back to that the Jews were so they were so they were so zealous for their word that they had these signs hanging up if any Gentile entered they'd only have themselves to be blamed but the Bible said Christ was our peace and broken down the middle wall of partition between us so in Christ died this wall this wall didn't fall but the Bible said there was a spiritual wall that fell there was no more division between Jew and Gentile the walls fell and now they were won by the blood of Jesus Christ now there's one thing that did fall that day that was the Veil the veil was rent praise God so not only was the wall broken down between man and man's you and Gentile the wall between God and man was broken down as well hallelujah and now there's no veil between God and man and God's holy presidents aren't you glad Church that we can enter in the holy presence of God this morning hey man you can enter in and receive your healing you can enter in and receive your forgiveness you can enter in and receive your bonus we just got to enter in and come into his presence amen hallelujah so see and God's always breaking down walls he broke down this spiritual wall he broke down Jericho walls he breaks down walls all the time God is always bringing the people together through the blood of Jesus Christ amen all right now thing I didn't get to I want to show is that the the only way we can kind of relate to this is that by understanding the Berlin wall because that was so you know we're so far removed from the days of you know the Jews and we don't even live in the East you know we're Western people I remember the Berlin Wall and we remember the Berlin Wall okay you might not this is a wall that stood for 28 years let me let me read a little bit about it by God's grace this was a barrier built to close off East Germany's access to West Germany and it stood for 28 years and I don't let me just show this picture a picture's worth a thousand words so they built this wall and they built it around 1961 yeah I was set up in 1961 and it stood until the 80s and you know I remember growing up I remember seeing when the wall came down on the news just as a little boy I don't remember much about it cuz I was so little now remember much anyway god I need God to help me with my memory but but I remember when that happened I remember when I'll have a picture in just a moment but this was standing from 1961 to 1989 and here's what was happening in the years between 1949 and 61 two and a half million East Germans had fled from east to the West Germany including steadily rising numbers of skilled workers professionals and intellectuals so all the rich people all the all the smart people were moving from the West East and their loss threatened to destroy the economic viability of the East German state so the eastern sides like we're losing all of our doctors we're losing all of our smart people we're losing all of our scientists we're losing all of our money and so out of fear they built the Berlin Wall it was erected on the night of August 12th and 13 1961 the original always bill of barbed wire and cinderblocks and was subsequently replaced by a series of concrete walls which were up to 15 feet tall and they were topped with barbed wire on the top so they really don't want those doctors to leave they didn't want all these uh scientists and educated professionals to leave that concrete wall plus barbed wire on top my goodness by the 1980s the system of law now had electrified fences and fornications that extended 28 miles around that part of Germany and divided the two parts of the city 5,000 people were captured by East German authorities attempting to get past the wall 5,000 almost 200 died because they were trapped in by this wall you ever felt trapped in by walls here I feel like I just can't get out of this kind of like reminds us of those strongholds in the complexes right I just can't get out of this so 5,000 people were arrested they didn't get through that wall 200 died attempting to get through the wall but you remember in 1989 remember 1989 they finally you know was covered and graffiti and everything like that I remember that from the news in 1989 remember that some of us okay that's the closest we can remember and that's the most we can relate to this there was a middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles you can get the Glock God but not as close as I can look that's what you could say you can serve God but you can't serve him like I can serve him does that sound familiar that suffer maker we have to make sure pride doesn't raise up for us believers right well you can't worship God like I can now part of that's true and part that's not true it depends how you say it right it depends what spirit you say that in praise the Lord because a wise version can worship God in a way that a foolish virgin can't are you with me the wise virgin could not go to the marriage procession because they could worship God with oil but the foolish version couldn't worship God with oil the thing I'm attacking is that spirit of Pride and that spirit of division that's what we're attacking because we know there's a difference between a wise virgin and a foolish version we know there's a great difference but pride when pride Rises isn't it rise in and weaken oh we can't do this and we can't do that when we're better we must never think we're better we just must feel that we're called amen oh yeah that's the word I want to use we're not better we're just called to a higher life how many called to a holy calling this morning hey man we're not better than ourselves but one thing because we've received a higher calling we can live higher amen and so this fell this this fell on November 9th 1989 this wall fell 28 years it's separated families can you imagine me on one side saying darn and how are you oh my son I wish I could see there was thousands of people that happened to once they erected that wall and shut it off that night they just had to peek through the wall can you imagine me in heartbroken so no we're just we can't work we're divided we're not United now apply that to the church how United we should be it's the middle wall partition anything that separates us even complexes anything at all that would separate us see how awful that is how it separates other people it separates us us from our family how many want all the walls to fall down amen in Jesus name we should believe that we should have all the walls fall down and they fall down by going through the blood of Jesus Christ which is the Holy Spirit in the sour amen does that help by God's grace that gives us a little bit of a modern kind of understanding of this middle wall of partition and Paul's writing this and Takaya kisses opening this up and this is the revealed Word of God all the walls between us should be broken down how do we do that we go to one another and talk about if they've sinned against us we go to them right praise the Lord somebody sinned against you go to them praise God and so if you sin against somebody they should come to you now if you know you sinned against somebody you should still go to them if you don't know you sinned against them you gotta wait till they come to you right that's how walls get broken down when we come through the blood of Jesus Christ exactly right amen this was a revolution what about a spiritual revolution we've had in Christ Jesus Oh hallelujah amen all the walls you know I denominational walls build up I was raised by the costal where we they spoke in tongues every week you know and that was fine but it was but I had a wall built up like you had to do this too to be born again and God had to break down that wall and say that's a man-made wall I'm breaking down that wall in Jesus name Amen speaking in tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost but it's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ amen it is the Holy Spirit Himself dwelling in the soul of man aren't you glad the walls been broken down Oh hallelujah this is what it's done for us it's broken down walls that separate walls that divide the blood of Christ has done that for us amen verse 15 having abolished in his flesh the enmity remember all sin was put upon Jesus body that's how sin was abolished he paid the penalty for our sins even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby hallelujah amen and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were nine for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father amen see we can't get to the Holy Ghost we can't get to God we can't get to God's Spirit unless we have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ let's not let's not say that's not deep enough preaching can you say amen to that let's not that's not how the attitude because our current walk with the Lord shows what we think about the blood of Jesus right because we can only get to the Father the Holy Ghost through remembering the cross I was out of New York and this pastor was a wonderful man of God brother Devon he's a wonderful man of God but he was telling me some of the spiritual battles they've had over the years and one of the battles was with a movement called the seven thunders movement you've probably heard of it there was many offshoots of that one of the offshoots was that they no longer needed to preach on the blood of Jesus Christ anymore because now the preaching is for the rapture they got to get the bride ready for the rapture oh my and brother Vaughn did not agree with that and he had to stand up in a convention after three preachers had preached on he had to stand there and say you're wrong in front of a thousand or I think it was a thousand or five hundred people and get them to see that the blood of Jesus Christ will never lose its power we're never in a spot where we don't need the blood of Jesus Christ so you with me Church because the Bible said it's the blood of the everlasting covenant and that blood of Christ remembering the cross makes us perfect for everything we have to do so if you're struggling with your job if you're struggling with your family if you're struggling with the church if you're struggling with your gifts apply the blood to that apply the cross to that look at the think of the cross and how how would this cross influence me to act in this situation and the church said keep your place go to Hebrews 13 that just reminded me of the scripture feeling definitely feeling led of the Holy Spirit Hebrews 13 because the Holy Spirit will always point us to the word fact the Prophet said it will only point you to the Word of God Hebrews 13 verse 20 that's what we must do we must picture ourselves today at the cross and then whatever battle whatever giant we preach on Giants last week they really enjoyed that message the Giants that Joshua drove out as a wonderful time in the Lord mine as we think about this whatever giant you're facing whatever problem you're trying to drive out the cross must be right there you must be right there at the cross you must picture Jesus Jesus died he's gonna guide me there's power in the cross the sins of this person who sinned against me Jesus died for those sins or I'm the guilty one sometimes we get overcome with guilt we won't forgive ourselves but we were us remember he had to die for me I needed him to die for me and there's forgiveness for me if that's my land that died there's forgiveness for me and the church said Amen mine we can't hold guilt we got to let it go because we know we're trusting in God's provided sacrifice he paid for our sins he took our guilt he took our punishment that's why we need the cross today amen glory verse 20 now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the Sheep through what church the blood of the everlasting covenant please don't let the blood become common this morning don't let the blood become common it is through the blood of this everlasting covenant verse 21 will make you what perfect complete God will complete his will in your life through the blood of the everlasting covenant in heaven to do his will everyone do his will I want to do only God's will I don't do my will I want to do my wife's will I don't want to do what the church wants me to do I want to do what God wants me to do you understand no disrespect against anybody but we must do God's will first working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight we got to please God not man we've got to please God through do that through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen do you appreciate that we must we must constantly trust in the blood of Jesus Christ that will help us forgive others help us forgive ourselves and it will prepare us to do every good work we do for God I remember the cross I remember what it did it's like the cross is right here I can see Jesus I can see he died and now I want to hear his voice I want to hear what he'd say I want to and I want to quickly respond to that like Isaiah did Lord send me let's close by finish in chapter 2 in Ephesians let's go back there let's close that up I just got timer I got 12 minutes on here about probably finished before that by God's grace oh I love this book amen book of Ephesians remember this all parallels Joshua and Joshua represented well Josh represented people taking the land the first people to possess the land by power and that types when you first get born of the Holy Ghost that's what Ephesian the book of Ephesians types you you're just a fresh Christian man I'm filled with the power of God I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I'm gonna possess this land but then we run into giants though we run into trouble sometimes we God restore our boldness praise God hallelujah the cross slain the enmity verse 16 by the cross slayed it the cross slayed the hatred that was against us hmm let's go to verse 19 now therefore ye are no longer strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and the house of God verse 20 and our bill upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord in whom he also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit let's stand to our feet I put this picture back up here because it's very fitting for what Paul just wrote it's very fitting God came to reconcile the body of Christ and he said we're not foreigners we're not far out here anymore but you know I think I dramatize it when I preach it last time boy I'd like to hear I like to hear those priests blown the trumpets a little better boy it's kind of quiet out here I'd really like to see what that lamb looks like I would like to be there how does the priest rightly divide their sacrifice how do they offer the fat here and how do they do these different things I like to see it but I'm not allowed in they're not allowed to see that I can't get as close to God as I like to all we want to be closer to the Lord don't you this is what he says he says we're not separated anymore we're not divided we're one body we're fellow citizens with the Saints the Bible said and we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord so Jesus Christ Seabees and the prophets they're like the foundation right oh maybe that maybe I'll go to this one right that's why the better one to go to Jesus Christ is the foundation and we're built upon that right 2,000 years later were these stones at the top how many know the Bible says we're lively stones we're not dead stone just sit here and do nothing for God we have a life for God we're supposed to live and declare the glory of God we're living stones Christ is our cornerstone were founded upon him that's why I can never be pushed off or I can never lose my fitting our footing I can never sink in the miry clay because I'm founded on a rock amen glory and I'm a part of this building my foundation is the holy apostles in Christ and here's my foundation the book of Ephesians book of Galatians went through that I'm glad to be a part of that and why do we do it verse twenty-two why are we part of this building so we can be a habitation of God through the Holy Spirit in other words God live in me God speaking to me God sing through me God witness through me God walking me God live through me how many want that to be their prayer today by God's grace let's bow our heads here let me pray you that will be a habitation of God through the spirit also before we pray would anybody say raise our hands they protest pray for me there's some walls I got a breakthrough I don't know what they might be bless those hands okay numerous hands let me pray please please pray for me Church let's pray for another Heavenly Father in Jesus Christ's name we come Lord by the blood of the everlasting covenant which your word says is able to make us perfect in Christ that we might do the will of God hallelujah in my mind I picture the cross Lord God I know you're not on the cross anymore but I'm picturing it because it reminds me of the effects of the cross all my sins all the sins of the church here were placed upon you Lord God and now we can picture you guys seated on your throne and we know there's blood there Lord God or else there can be no mercy there's no mercy without blood so father our thoughts go from this earth from earthly things to heavenly things from terrestrial things to celestial dear God just like Paul's letter makes us think of celestial things the rewards the inheritance what are we living for what are we dying for we're living for Christ we're living for the heavenly inheritance dear God so father I come in Jesus Christ's name I come to the Father through the son as we just read dear God thank you that we have access
