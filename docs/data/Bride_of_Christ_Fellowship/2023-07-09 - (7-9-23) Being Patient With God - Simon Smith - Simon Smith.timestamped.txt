[0:02] been better to me than I've been to
[0:04] myself
[0:06] as we can all probably say those things
[0:08] is for the Brooks Used to Say
[0:12] and uh
[0:14] we could have receipts here so we'll
[0:16] talk a little bit here
[0:19] you know the Lord's been so faithful and
[0:21] so kind to us and
[0:24] every day we should count our blessings
[0:28] for our freedoms you look at the the
[0:30] news and how Wars and riots and
[0:34] uprisings and civil Civil War things and
[0:38] everything is crumbling
[0:42] contact with the Pakistani and Pakistan
[0:44] and how the persecution's stepping up a
[0:46] little bit and he said he's
[0:49] keeping his congregation
[0:51] stay in the house because the Muslims
[0:54] are very rampant and they're obviously
[0:57] so it's
[0:59] and here we are yet and still peace
[1:01] and why God would allow us to live in
[1:04] such these dainties and these Finer
[1:07] Things and uh
[1:09] not worrying over our life constantly
[1:12] today could be our last to due to a
[1:14] martyrdom and maybe a persecution or
[1:17] however
[1:18] and we should thank the Lord for those
[1:20] things
[1:23] I was
[1:25] talking to a brother and he said he said
[1:27] you know the Bible said in the third
[1:29] seal that the voice of the throne says
[1:31] touch not the oil and the wine
[1:34] so the saints of God if you have the
[1:36] Holy Ghost within you and that
[1:38] Revelation keeps coming because Satan
[1:40] cannot touch you
[1:42] so we are believing in all things you
[1:45] know his promises are yea and amen he's
[1:48] uh
[1:50] he promised there would be a bride and
[1:51] not only just have a bride but that
[1:53] woman that wife of his would not see
[1:56] death
[1:57] And We believe We Believe those things
[2:00] so
[2:01] stay in prayer and
[2:04] just ask the Lord to guide you because
[2:07] remember when this thing starts and I'm
[2:09] talking like when it starts the finish
[2:12] the final move here
[2:14] remember the word Gentiles and God does
[2:17] not deal with us as a as a whole but he
[2:19] deals us with as us with individuals so
[2:23] we want to keep our lives
[2:24] right right so let's turn to the stand
[2:29] and turn to Exodus three I don't know if
[2:31] this is going to go or not but uh
[2:35] I'll see it though you can do this
[2:40] Exodus three just a little simple
[2:42] thought it was uh but just was so kind
[2:45] to give me a little room over there at
[2:47] the hotel and uh
[2:51] I don't know about you guys but I get
[2:52] tired I don't know
[2:55] just running things doing this and that
[2:57] run help this person do this he got jobs
[3:00] and work and and just the stress of this
[3:03] and you're sometimes your apprentices
[3:05] immune
[3:08] worries sometimes I A lot of times I
[3:11] give myself worries
[3:13] and uh
[3:16] so I was studying and nothing was really
[3:20] dropping and then so I took a little
[3:22] micro nap like which I mean some would
[3:26] call that a long nap I took like an hour
[3:27] and a half nap
[3:29] and I woke up and then it sure enough
[3:31] the little quotes I had pulled up before
[3:33] kind of
[3:35] one of them had something to do with
[3:37] Brother band was preaching an Akron a
[3:38] little service so I figured I went with
[3:40] that way so
[3:41] that was to me that was confirmation
[3:44] I was like oh there he is yes so I felt
[3:47] confident in where we're going this
[3:48] morning by God's grace so in Exodus 3
[3:51] verse 1.
[3:55] is everything okay can you hear me okay
[3:57] all right all right so all right so
[3:59] Exodus 3 verse 1
[4:03] and we'll read to verse 5.
[4:06] now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[4:08] father-in-law and the pre-summitian and
[4:10] he led the flock to the back side of the
[4:13] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[4:15] even to aurab
[4:17] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[4:20] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[4:22] of the Bush and he looked and behold the
[4:25] bush
[4:26] burnt with fire and the Bush was not
[4:29] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[4:32] aside and see this great sight
[4:36] why the bush is not burned up
[4:38] and when the Lord saw that he
[4:41] that he turned aside to see God called
[4:44] unto him out of the midst of the Bush
[4:46] and he said Moses Moses and he said here
[4:49] am I
[4:52] and he said draw not nigh hi hither
[4:56] he says put off those shoes from off thy
[4:58] feet for the place where on thou
[5:00] standeth is Holy Ground
[5:04] amen so let's turn to uh
[5:07] let's turn to Exodus 34 Verse 5.
[5:24] Exodus 34 Verse 5.
[5:35] a verse yep Exodus 34 5.
[5:38] and the Lord descended in the cloud and
[5:41] stood with him there and proclaimed the
[5:43] name of the Lord
[5:46] and the Lord passed by before him and
[5:48] proclaimed the Lord the Lord God
[5:51] merciful
[5:53] and gracious
[5:54] long-suffering and abundant in goodness
[5:57] and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands
[6:02] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[6:04] sin and that by no means clear the
[6:07] guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[6:08] fathers upon the children upon the

[7:39] I think I've used this here before and
[7:41] it worked but

[7:47] problem this
[7:48] is
[7:51] no problem we can go with that one thank
[7:54] you amen
[7:56] amen Saints all's well this morning
[7:59] we are uh here and
[8:05] I said we'll be ready to go here by
[8:06] God's grace and uh this morning I'd like
[8:09] to teach on on a subject day
[8:13] patient God
[8:14] and with the sub topic of a patient
[8:18] bride
[8:20] so we think we thank the Lord for
[8:23] giving us Grace
[8:26] to be here and
[8:29] uh
[8:30] for some reason last night and even this
[8:33] morning I had a little I don't have this
[8:35] too much too often you know mostly here
[8:37] in gung-ho mode and you know we're
[8:39] brothers we're man and sisters we're
[8:41] women you know
[8:43] and with the grace of God by the hand of
[8:45] by the strength of the lord we can take
[8:47] on anything you know and
[8:49] that uncircumcised for those teams your
[8:52] head's coming off and you know how we
[8:53] you know how I was like this when your
[8:56] faith is strong and the anointing is
[8:58] there and uh your word and and just you
[9:01] feel the presence of God anything is
[9:03] possible there is no fear God did not
[9:06] give us the the spirit of fear but of
[9:08] power and of love and a sound mind right
[9:11] but last night I had this thought about
[9:13] uh and for some reason it came on to me
[9:15] hard about uh uh what if I have to die
[9:19] and and I wasn't even thinking Nestle
[9:21] martyrdom or whatever but just coming to
[9:23] that point in life where uh my heart
[9:27] would stop
[9:28] or something would take place and I
[9:31] would have to move on and and I had
[9:33] almost had like a little fear come up uh
[9:36] on me and I was like Wow and I'm like
[9:37] why is this why why am I why am I
[9:40] feeling this right now why is why is
[9:42] this affecting me and I could feel a
[9:44] little bit of fear and I'm thinking and
[9:45] I started trying to rehearse the
[9:47] scripture and I'm thinking after this
[9:49] after this death is nothing but a door
[9:52] death is nothing but uh uh just just
[9:55] another Gateway it's it we there is life
[9:59] after death right there is something
[10:01] Beyond this life there has to be right
[10:04] there I mean this can't be all of it
[10:06] this can't be you know uh you wake up in
[10:09] the morning and you brush your teeth and
[10:10] you go to work and uh if God gives you
[10:12] Grace you go out to eat for for lunch
[10:14] eat at Chipotle and whatever and you and
[10:16] then you go back to work you finish the
[10:18] day you come home you you eat again and
[10:20] you talk to your wife or husband and or
[10:22] your family or however this and that and
[10:25] and then you go to sleep and you do it
[10:27] again that's that's life I mean that's
[10:29] essentially how things go every day
[10:32] maybe not now they'll order however but
[10:35] the general routine is the Sim is
[10:38] similar it's it's it's just exactly the
[10:40] same the day before it's just a
[10:43] repetition right
[10:46] but but on this side you have a
[10:49] beginning and you have an ending you
[10:50] have a the the the the morning and the
[10:52] night and you have the rising the sun
[10:54] you have the setting of sun and there's
[10:55] always there's always that there but
[10:57] once we get on to the other side there
[10:59] is none of that
[11:00] it is joy unspeakable and full of Joyful
[11:03] forever more it is the Lord Jesus I'll
[11:07] say like this and as I had those
[11:09] thoughts and fear came up I thought
[11:11] but um we're doing this for eternal life
[11:13] for him for Jesus Christ and he gives us
[11:16] and Promises eternal life why wouldn't
[11:19] we go in boldly and and fearless and
[11:22] without doubt without those sort of
[11:24] things uh we have to we are born to do
[11:27] this and may God rise our faith up to
[11:30] move into this these sort of things amen
[11:33] amen so I just want to be transparent
[11:35] before you that I I battled that last
[11:37] night for whatever reason I haven't
[11:38] battled that in a long long time and for
[11:41] some reason that came upon me and uh and
[11:44] I just saying well nonetheless
[11:45] nonetheless
[11:47] I'm here
[11:48] nonetheless you were born and when you
[11:51] were born God gave you a The Gift of
[11:54] Life and he gave you something to do on
[11:57] this side for him and now we have to now
[12:01] if we have if we have I was like this
[12:03] when we got baptized what would that
[12:04] what was that supposed to represent a
[12:06] death to self
[12:08] when a brother came up to I'll say like
[12:10] this when it came up to a point where a
[12:11] brother had to die or this is Brother
[12:12] bam said he said brother are you scared
[12:13] to die he goes I died way back then
[12:15] right when I was baptized in the name of
[12:19] Jesus Christ what we gave our lives to
[12:21] him amen and he has been faithful ever
[12:24] since amen that's the truth see so so
[12:26] we've got to look back we've already
[12:28] died back there to him what so we could
[12:31] have her here one and walk with him for
[12:33] all eternity
[12:35] that is our goal that's our desire none
[12:37] of this matters I'll say it like this
[12:38] and if you've been able to keep the very
[12:40] first dollar he ever made and he'll be
[12:43] able to keep uh your wealth or your
[12:45] health can anyone just say I'm never
[12:46] getting sick from here on and never get
[12:47] it chances are you're going to get sick
[12:49] again you're going to get tired again
[12:51] well I don't need sleep well try that
[12:53] for about two days
[12:54] we found out how we find out how weak
[12:57] and how mortal we are
[13:00] how fragile I says how fragile life is
[13:04] so uh I guess the starting with this
[13:07] topic uh
[13:08] uh a patient God and a patient bride
[13:13] and I guess sister cases you have to
[13:17] hang with me here
[13:19] because I'm running some scriptures here
[13:21] I don't know if you're since this isn't
[13:22] kicking up I don't know if you want some
[13:23] scriptures for the saints of God or not
[13:25] or however in Psalms 33 and 20.
[13:29] uh it says our soul waiteth for the Lord
[13:33] he is our help and our shield now notice
[13:37] this is this is talking about what he's
[13:39] saying he's our soul awaiteth what did
[13:41] they are they are in constant
[13:42] anticipation it's a time of danger it's
[13:46] a time of of of of anxiety a time of
[13:49] stress in fact he says if they've if
[13:51] visas are awaited in other words they
[13:52] have done something Beyond just waiting
[13:55] they believed they had spoken to him
[13:56] they've called out to him and now
[13:58] they're on at that point where they're
[14:00] just waiting why because they need help
[14:02] they need protection right
[14:05] in Psalms 62 verse 1 and to the chief
[14:10] musician
[14:11] to death to uh judathon uh Psalm of
[14:15] David my soul waiteth upon God from him
[14:19] cometh my salvation
[14:23] saints of God here's David he he battled
[14:26] from the time he was born as a little
[14:29] boy Shepherd all the way to the time his
[14:32] very end his last dying breath he had to
[14:34] fight and fight and fight and overcome
[14:38] what and he was trusting the Lord Jesus
[14:40] what did he would deliver him in every
[14:42] battle and because I'll say this and he
[14:44] rehearsed to David rehearsed he says a
[14:46] lot of times before David would go into
[14:48] battle he says he says boys he says
[14:49] God's going to deliver us God's going to
[14:51] deliver us now sometimes God we've seen
[14:53] the scripture where God would speak to
[14:55] him and say you're go ahead and take it
[14:57] you will you will capture all things
[14:59] back right but other times it's not
[15:01] recorded if God said anything to him he
[15:03] just said well he says this man's going
[15:05] down and we're going to take this one he
[15:07] literally prophesied he spoke and
[15:10] ordered his own footsteps Why by because
[15:13] what he believed and knew he was
[15:14] anointed and what he was the he was the
[15:17] chosen King right and then what God was
[15:19] with him and that's where we have to
[15:21] believe this point in ourselves and our
[15:23] lives we have to know that God is with
[15:25] us amen does he heal your prayer or does
[15:27] he not does do you feel him uh at times
[15:30] here or times there when you speak
[15:32] something and you just believe does it
[15:34] take place amen that's where we're
[15:35] supposed to be right
[15:37] now a lot of times he says now here he
[15:39] says he says truly my soul weighth upon
[15:42] God and from him cometh my salvation
[15:44] David was waiting what for Christ to
[15:47] come on this right here this ground we
[15:50] stand on today and what perform when you
[15:52] had to perform what and that he would
[15:54] rise up and go in a Rapture with him
[15:56] absolutely and that took place what a
[15:58] thousand plus years or however after he
[16:01] died right sure but who knows the exact
[16:03] numbers I don't know but uh he was
[16:05] waiting what for that body change which
[16:07] is what true salvation why David was
[16:09] down in the paradise he was down there
[16:11] separated he could look over and see how
[16:13] those in Hell could come and see him but
[16:16] he wanted out of that place that was not
[16:18] his final resting spot amen he knew what
[16:21] that salvation was getting out of there
[16:22] amen sure sure now
[16:25] so here we see the people of God we see
[16:28] David he they always waited on the Lord
[16:31] in Psalms 130 verse 6.
[16:36] he says my soul waiteth for the Lord
[16:38] more than they that watched for the
[16:42] morning I say more than they that watch
[16:44] for the morning David was up before the
[16:47] morning he went to bed the Bible says
[16:50] sometimes he would be on his bed at
[16:51] midnight crying out weeping upon his bed
[16:53] trying to find favor with God trying to
[16:56] make contact one more with the Lord
[16:57] Jesus Christ and and here he says he's
[17:00] I'm waiting for the Lord more than any
[17:02] us like this for people waiting to wake
[17:04] up in the morning to go to work and this
[17:05] is he says I'm waiting on the Lord we're
[17:08] waiting for this Rapture we're waiting
[17:10] for this time well this thing will
[17:11] strike and we will be changed in a
[17:13] moment in a twinkling of I and that's
[17:15] where we're that's that's that's we're
[17:17] waiting for
[17:18] people like the people the in the karma
[17:21] people these people here however they're
[17:23] way they're doing their jobs every day
[17:25] they're waking up and just doing the
[17:26] routine just like we do but overall our
[17:30] main our main focus our main objective
[17:33] is we're what waiting on the Lord Jesus
[17:36] we're waiting for him and we believe him
[17:40] now
[17:41] uh Isaiah 64 verse 4.
[17:45] he says for since the beginning of the
[17:47] world men have not heard nor perceived
[17:49] by the ear neither hath the I seen or o
[17:52] God beside thee what he hath prepared
[17:55] for him that waiteth for him
[18:00] well brother side the Rapture we've been
[18:02] preaching I remember it was a prophecy
[18:05] in this Delta Assembly of God and
[18:07] somebody spoke with tongues and someone
[18:09] interpreted and the interpretation was
[18:12] the angel of the Lord the trumpets
[18:14] coming upon his lips very very uh close
[18:17] right now and everybody in the church
[18:18] just went ah you know how it was back in
[18:21] uh in the old church but just when the
[18:23] the power of God would come down and
[18:24] people would run and shouting uh and and
[18:27] um
[18:28] all that where we saw that and uh
[18:31] but we we see here uh
[18:34] that we're waiting for him
[18:37] and they were excited back then in the
[18:39] early in the late 80s for what the
[18:41] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and yet
[18:43] it's been preached he's coming he's
[18:44] coming he's coming and what we are still
[18:46] waiting we have not given up we still
[18:49] believe what the word is saying
[18:51] amen amen now
[18:55] in Romans 8 verse 18.
[18:57] he says for I reckon that the sufferings
[19:00] of this present time are not worthy to
[19:02] be compared with the glory which shall
[19:04] be revealed
[19:05] in us there are things
[19:08] Beyond this life
[19:10] Beyond this the greater things you get
[19:12] on and listen to some testimonies of
[19:14] people who went on on Beyond and then
[19:16] God's called back and they did not want
[19:19] to come back but the voice said you must
[19:21] come back I'm not finished you're not
[19:23] finished with your work on earth right
[19:24] you've heard those testimonies those
[19:26] sort of things but they never wanted to
[19:28] come back you see sister uh uh hope when
[19:30] he's when she's talking to brother
[19:32] Brandon and brother Bram calls her back
[19:33] he says she said Bill why did you call
[19:35] me back
[19:36] she had a brand new baby had a son and
[19:39] she did not want to come back to them
[19:41] children or to her husband because
[19:42] what's over there is far greater than
[19:46] the struggles of life than the
[19:47] Temptations of the earth and the
[19:49] Temptations of the devil those sort of
[19:51] things and the things we have to go
[19:52] through the struggle constant grinding
[19:54] we're just grinding and pushing and and
[19:57] at least just just doing our best to
[19:59] make it through this life absolutely
[20:01] that's the best we can everything is a
[20:03] struggle life is a struggle it is a
[20:06] fight
[20:07] he says for I reckon that uh that the
[20:09] sufferings of this present time are not
[20:11] worldly to be compared with the glory
[20:13] which shall be revealed in Us Now That
[20:16] Glory that's to be revealed in US is
[20:18] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:19] there is coming a time where what his
[20:22] life his nature will be displayed and be
[20:25] fully manifest in you absolutely it's
[20:29] coming it's coming and we are we are
[20:31] what we as the bride are waiting for
[20:34] those things absolutely and we are being
[20:36] very very patient
[20:38] and what we're trying to watch our steps
[20:41] everybody trying to watch your steps as
[20:42] you walk through this world this world
[20:44] if you walk out just one step and it's
[20:46] sinful you your mind gets uh corrupted
[20:50] and polluted your eyes what you take in
[20:52] from what you see and what you hear it
[20:54] pollutes your entire being Mom
[20:57] and what we're still walking through it
[20:59] trying to do our best to keep what this
[21:01] Temple clean Amen to keep our our
[21:03] three-part uh person Body Soul and
[21:06] Spirit just as clean as we can now by
[21:08] the grace of God we don't have to keep
[21:10] our soul clean because once you receive
[21:12] the Holy Ghost the Bible says you are
[21:14] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[21:15] amen then God himself locks himself up
[21:18] in your being right there and you are
[21:20] God become one amen and that's when you
[21:22] become the bride right
[21:24] absolutely sure we believe those things
[21:27] yes now as we continue to move on here I
[21:31] want to uh
[21:35] there's I don't know so
[21:39] sometimes I get a little emotional
[21:41] sometimes I
[21:43] um see something
[21:45] and
[21:48] I say this if you keep if you allow the
[21:50] Lord
[21:52] keep your heart soft
[21:53] if your heart is soft and not hard if
[21:56] that that that Stony heart is gone and
[21:59] you have a heart of Flesh
[22:01] and you see things you know when
[22:03] it moves you sometimes it tears
[22:09] and let me read this these scriptures
[22:10] Romans 8 19.
[22:15] I don't know why I I mean I I love
[22:18] people are wonderful I love people but
[22:20] just something about nature
[22:24] it has almost the same effect if not
[22:26] more I say it like that just seeing the
[22:29] Fallen state of nature
[22:36] it says for the earnest expectation of
[22:39] the creature waited for the
[22:40] manifestation of the sons of God
[22:43] they're waiting as well
[22:46] the Lions
[22:47] the giraffes the hippos the gazelle
[22:51] the Bears
[22:53] the squirrels the Chipmunks
[22:57] they're waiting on us
[23:01] for the creature was made subject to
[23:03] vanity
[23:05] not willing by reason of whom he hath
[23:07] sub hath subjected the same in Hope
[23:11] so as Adam and Eve fell as well because
[23:15] Satan used the animal kingdom use an
[23:18] animal to bring in the fall of Man God
[23:22] had to use what God God not only allowed
[23:25] Humanity to bring go into the fall but
[23:27] he allowed what animal the animal
[23:30] kingdom to go as far as that as well
[23:32] right they they die they have to suffer
[23:34] they they're not Eternal they don't have
[23:36] perfect bodies they're they are in a
[23:38] fallen State as well he says because the
[23:40] creature itself also shall be delivered
[23:43] from the bondage of corruption into the
[23:45] Glorious Liberty of the children of gods
[23:49] sometimes I see uh something like a dog
[23:52] herding or a cat hurting or you catch a
[23:55] uh somebody sends you a video of of like
[23:58] something in the Safari and how this
[24:00] lion ate this hyena or killed us in my
[24:03] heart just starts
[24:04] inside I just start melting
[24:08] not long I long to see nature in harmony
[24:14] I cannot wait to see everything get
[24:17] along
[24:18] then you think about humanity and how
[24:20] they're just as vicious as animals
[24:23] there's this one in the same
[24:25] the same animal nature is within what
[24:28] Humanity why because it's a serpent race
[24:30] it's animal and it just breaks my heart
[24:33] to see it every time
[24:36] for we know that the whole creation
[24:38] groaneth and surveilleth in pain
[24:40] together until now and not only they but
[24:43] ourselves also which have the fruits
[24:46] first fruits of the spirit saints of God
[24:48] if you have the Holy Ghost there should
[24:50] be something within you saying Lord God
[24:52] change this body get me out of here I am
[24:57] so tired of this thing acting and this
[25:00] thing's saying and this thing thinking
[25:01] the things that it does amen I want I
[25:04] want my new body I want freedom from
[25:07] what unbelief I want freedom in in what
[25:10] in the liberty of the Holy Ghost I want
[25:12] I'll say this I want to walk pure I want
[25:15] to walk holy amen yes what and that
[25:18] comes by what the new body that God's
[25:21] going to give you yes that glorified
[25:23] body that still can eat and rest in play
[25:26] and build and plants saints of God we're
[25:29] coming to something greater absolutely
[25:31] yes sir praise God
[25:33] well that's our that's that's something
[25:35] what he because remember the spirit of
[25:37] God does everything he what he's the one
[25:39] that reveals the deep and secret things
[25:41] he's the one that draws us to those sort
[25:44] of things and he's also the one we see
[25:46] here right here that he's calling us
[25:47] what to that new body Amen to that body
[25:49] change that we believe in
[25:53] he says even we ourselves grow within us
[25:55] ours waiting for the adoption to win the
[25:58] Redemption of our body amen bring it
[26:00] Lord Jesus praise God for we are saved
[26:03] by hope but what hope that is seen is
[26:05] not hope but what a man seeth why does
[26:08] he yet hope for but we hope for that
[26:10] which we see not then do we have
[26:12] patience then do we with patience wait
[26:15] for it
[26:16] we don't see it
[26:18] so what we're hoping and we wait in hope
[26:21] in patience amen we are waiting for
[26:24] these things absolutely
[26:27] sometimes I'm going to uh a lot of times
[26:30] when Emma would come over and well
[26:32] sometimes she didn't come over all the
[26:33] time but when she does come over
[26:36] he usually ends up talking about her mom
[26:38] or dad or Uncle so and so or Aunt
[26:41] so-and-so so guess what I do I go up you
[26:43] get my little picture albums out and I
[26:45] start looking at pictures and you just
[26:46] look and even me in my mid-40s you're
[26:50] looking how Jess looked I got a couple
[26:52] of sister Kristen when she was young
[26:54] and how they young and when they looked
[26:57] like they when they were cases age and
[26:58] Lydia Malachi's age and just there's
[27:01] just it was like
[27:02] fresh
[27:04] [Laughter]
[27:06] and new
[27:08] and no wrinkles no stress they're just
[27:10] like
[27:12] and they know they look good see I mean
[27:14] that's they they just because they're
[27:16] young
[27:18] but that youth and I'm just and you know
[27:20] I say Emma look at this picture looks
[27:21] picture but I'm thinking the entire time
[27:23] I'm thinking look what we're going back
[27:25] to
[27:26] this when we cross over
[27:31] young Malachi gets his probably have the
[27:33] same kind of body if the Lord Terry's a
[27:35] little bit longer
[27:38] as well
[27:39] you meet your dad on the other side
[27:41] you're gonna be like whoa dad you're
[27:42] young I'm like no this is who I always
[27:45] was
[27:47] this is me
[27:49] if our father never gets old then we
[27:52] should not never get old as well amen so
[27:55] we come back what to the original
[27:56] thought that what we are Eternal we can
[27:59] never more die again amen we get that
[28:02] new flesh that what the skin of a child
[28:04] the Bible talks about remember when he
[28:06] was baptized there yes the Flesh of a
[28:09] child absolutely
[28:11] it's weird it's strange
[28:14] age and time I'm understanding it more
[28:16] and more every day
[28:18] brother Jose you understand that
[28:22] with the silver Moses beard absolutely
[28:24] he says looking more like Moses every
[28:26] day
[28:29] amen so we have we went with patience we
[28:32] wait for it by God's grace
[28:35] in second Peter one and four
[28:41] wherefore are given unto us exceeding
[28:44] great and precious promises that by
[28:46] these you might be partakers of the
[28:48] divine nature
[28:50] having escaped the corruption that is in
[28:53] the world through lust and be besides
[28:55] this giving all diligence and your faith
[28:57] virtue into virtue knowledge into
[28:59] knowledge Temperance into Temperance
[29:01] Temperance patience and into the
[29:03] patience godliness
[29:05] and God and his brother kindness and
[29:07] brother kindness to charity these are
[29:08] what they call the stature of perfect
[29:10] man these are Divine uh uh this is the
[29:13] divine nature
[29:15] now the prophet God said all these can
[29:17] be
[29:18] imitated
[29:19] you can see people who are very diligent
[29:22] this this but it's a carnal some some
[29:25] are very tempered and can handle a lot
[29:27] of stress and this and this but without
[29:28] the Holy Ghost is carnal right but when
[29:31] you have the Holy Ghost these these
[29:34] virtues are within you
[29:36] now notice that patience
[29:39] is in there
[29:42] and his brother Brandon would break this
[29:44] down in the Statue perfect man in one uh
[29:46] 10 14 and 62.
[29:48] patience he's talking about this Divine
[29:51] patience
[29:54] remember be
[29:55] a patient God and a patient bride and
[30:00] they're supposed to have the same Divine
[30:02] patience right patience he says patience
[30:05] with what what kind of patience he's
[30:08] dealing with that second Peter right
[30:10] there one he's talking about the statute
[30:12] proof man he's dealing with patience and
[30:14] what do you say first the first thing
[30:16] with patience is have patience with God
[30:23] something was string up in your life
[30:27] if something else I'll say this uh
[30:29] Brother Andy remember how he had that
[30:31] accident with his hand he can't play the
[30:32] guitar anymore he's now waiting he's
[30:35] waiting for God to restore that hand so
[30:38] he can play the guitar again
[30:40] does he get upset and say God I don't
[30:41] know he doesn't do that he's what having
[30:44] patience he's waiting on God
[30:49] if you have a sickness or an illness or
[30:53] something wrong in this or in that part
[30:55] of your life whatever it might be
[30:58] always we have to do is ask the Lord
[31:00] Jesus to do something in there to
[31:02] intervene and what have patience on him
[31:08] that's why he gave in the gifts of the
[31:09] Spirit healing and miracles
[31:12] one does not require patience the other
[31:15] one does
[31:17] you have to wait a lot of times for your
[31:20] healing amen but a miracle is like boom
[31:22] boom boom absolutely it just happens
[31:25] absolutely uh brother Jesse anointed
[31:27] whatever praise for somebody or or
[31:28] brother amen or brother Jose whoever
[31:30] they they pray over someone and they get
[31:32] healed instantly that is a miracle but
[31:35] if they do not get healed and we still
[31:37] believe we're waiting for a healing amen
[31:39] and a lot of times that healing will
[31:41] take some time
[31:44] absolutely
[31:45] he says first thing in this divine
[31:48] nature is have patience with God
[31:55] the Bible says you're going to make a
[31:56] rapture
[31:57] the prophet said in his message he said
[32:00] that when he comes you're going to be
[32:01] just like
[32:04] well I don't see it I'll be honest I
[32:06] don't see it right now like I want to
[32:07] see
[32:08] but I have to have patience with God
[32:12] he said that where he's going to put us
[32:14] through so much and he's going to build
[32:16] us and make us in such a way that when
[32:19] this thing strikes he's coming out and
[32:21] will be just like him
[32:25] explain it I don't know
[32:28] we're just going to see what he does
[32:30] when it comes to pass then we'll be able
[32:32] to explain it
[32:35] there it is this is that which was
[32:38] prophesied amen amen he says first thing
[32:42] is have patience of God if you've got
[32:44] real genuine faith you'll have real
[32:47] genuine patience see that's why faith is
[32:50] the base of that
[32:52] that patience has to have faith to lean
[32:54] on to that's the foundation of that
[32:56] Faith he says When God says anything you
[32:59] believe it he said that's all you've got
[33:00] patience you say well I asked him last
[33:03] night to heal me and I'm just as sick in
[33:04] the morning oh my what patience what
[33:06] patience
[33:07] saints of God when you get sick and God
[33:09] doesn't heal you the rat that night
[33:11] keep waiting I've learned in my some 40
[33:14] years or however that when you get hurt
[33:16] I'll say like this
[33:19] I just got my my tonsils out about a
[33:21] month ago
[33:22] and they and the nurse is like it's very
[33:24] very painful
[33:26] are you sure you want to do this and I'm
[33:27] like she's trying to scare me
[33:30] and the other nurse was like
[33:32] it's very very tough you're going to
[33:33] have a it's gonna it's a rough one and
[33:35] I'm like
[33:37] okay
[33:38] and I was going into that knowing that
[33:40] right
[33:41] but just like in any any time any time I
[33:43] get hurt on the job whether I I crush a
[33:46] thumb or cut this or cut that
[33:48] the next day it's going to get better
[33:49] and the next day it's going to get
[33:51] better and the next day it's going to be
[33:52] better and first the next thing you know
[33:54] you'll forget all about it
[33:56] because you know how it works you just
[33:58] have to give it some time
[34:00] you have to have what faith that God has
[34:02] given you a nice uh immune system and a
[34:05] healing uh healing and abilities within
[34:09] your body what God does the healing
[34:11] right
[34:12] the doctor can only set something or
[34:14] give you this medicine or this chemical
[34:16] or whatever but God does the healing
[34:18] amen yes
[34:21] so guess what I get these out
[34:23] I didn't take any pain pills
[34:25] it was just to me it was just a sore
[34:27] throat
[34:28] maybe you might have to drive a high
[34:30] pain tolerance I don't know
[34:31] but I wasn't I wasn't scared because I
[34:34] knew the next day it was gonna get
[34:35] better the next day it's going to get
[34:37] better the next day it's going to be
[34:39] better why because I was trusting in the
[34:40] Lord the next day the next day and now a
[34:43] month later I'm completely fine but I
[34:45] knew it was going to be that you just
[34:47] have to wait
[34:48] in every situation wait
[34:55] when I was Malachi and Lydia's age in
[34:58] high school
[35:00] thank God your home's gone
[35:05] when I was in high school there would be
[35:06] some a situation would take place in
[35:08] high school and you're under so many
[35:09] eyes you think when you're walking
[35:11] through that everybody's watching you in
[35:12] your mind in your mind everybody's
[35:14] watching you oh my goodness what do you
[35:16] think about this and you trip or
[35:18] something or somebody messes with you
[35:19] and embarrass you in front of everybody
[35:20] and you're like oh if I could only I
[35:22] don't want to come to school anymore
[35:23] because everybody's gonna laugh at me
[35:26] and at that at your age those things are
[35:28] huge I mean you're like
[35:30] what am I gonna do
[35:32] my life is over
[35:35] literally something like that small and
[35:38] you're in at that age in your mind my
[35:40] life is over
[35:44] I gotta run away from home and go to
[35:46] another school
[35:50] but as as you get older and the Lord
[35:53] puts you through more tests and more
[35:55] trials when something embarrassing or
[35:58] someone does this this you just keep on
[35:59] marching
[36:00] because you care less and less and less
[36:04] about what someone thinks about you
[36:07] I felt like my mom there wait a second
[36:12] yeah absolutely why because what we what
[36:15] you have to trust the process
[36:19] day after day and what God will
[36:21] encourage you and says don't worry about
[36:23] what you did in the past don't worry
[36:25] what happened to you yesterday or this
[36:27] person said just keep moving on amen
[36:29] that's a true face of God we're warriors
[36:32] we don't stop because this hits me or
[36:35] that hits you if this something bad
[36:37] takes place in your life it doesn't
[36:38] matter we're warriors we're soldiers in
[36:42] his army
[36:44] hey when I teach something up here and
[36:48] it's contrary to a mainstream message do
[36:50] you think I care
[36:51] I can only teach what God allows me to
[36:55] see
[36:56] and if I see something wrong you pray
[36:58] for me but I'll say it like this I can't
[37:00] teach anything I can't see
[37:03] or the way I see it I can't I can't
[37:05] affect that I can't change that this is
[37:07] how God has built me this is how God is
[37:09] about brother Jesse we can only teach
[37:11] and by the anointing about what's
[37:13] revealed to us the way they see it amen
[37:17] and we're all different
[37:23] he says well he says
[37:25] but God he said God believed now the
[37:27] reason I that's crazy I just said okay
[37:29] now God told Abraham 25 years later he
[37:32] said there wasn't signed he was still
[37:33] believing he had patience with God
[37:36] he said now the number of them said why
[37:38] he says he says the first part of that
[37:39] Divine patience is with God you know
[37:42] what the second one he says was
[37:43] dealing with that Divine patience that
[37:46] divine nature
[37:50] he says and we should have patience with
[37:52] one another too see
[37:55] one time we get so impatient with one
[37:57] another's we think we got to be like
[37:59] Moses Moses had patience with the people
[38:05] so there's a big shot Lydia just
[38:07] graduated
[38:08] all tough and super smart got a new job
[38:11] awesome building this Enterprise and
[38:13] this Enterprise
[38:19] she's got habilo patient on her sisters
[38:21] her little sisters who quite ain't there
[38:24] quite yet right and it's the same in the
[38:27] house of God
[38:32] from Malachi
[38:35] little Zion comes up to brother man okay
[38:36] big brother hate can you teach me how to
[38:38] play the piano
[38:42] oh and Malachi's going
[38:49] and Zion's just like think
[38:52] [Laughter]
[38:52] ing
[38:57] Malachi has to have patience with his
[39:00] little brother
[39:03] he can't just store offices he's too
[39:06] young I can't help there are virtuosos
[39:08] who are four and five years old who can
[39:09] play that piano probably as good as
[39:12] brother Malachi right
[39:15] but the same in the spiritual within
[39:18] ourselves
[39:20] if you see me
[39:22] lacking where you are strong
[39:24] patience with me amen and we the same we
[39:29] are I'll say like this
[39:31] I'm going to say this because I saw it
[39:33] in the natural
[39:36] brother Jess could you come up here real
[39:37] quick
[39:43] president Jesse what year were you born
[39:46] 1980. you know when I was born 1977.
[39:51] three years older
[39:54] and when I was growing up
[39:57] Jesse was like this like this and like
[40:00] this and then
[40:02] around junior high or High School
[40:05] freshman eighth grade Jesse for the
[40:08] Jesse caught up with me and was tall as
[40:10] I was
[40:12] and then
[40:13] I'm going to try and get my senior year
[40:15] and uh
[40:17] some of us grow
[40:22] a little more than others and grow
[40:25] faster some slower
[40:28] remember a dollar can't be a penny and a
[40:31] penny can't be a dollar okay
[40:35] that's why you have to have patience
[40:36] with one another
[40:39] but Jesse God bless you thank you yeah
[40:41] thanks for God two claps
[40:43] [Applause]
[40:47] you've got to have patience
[40:50] with God and one another
[40:53] well if this sister would just get the
[40:55] Holy Ghost she'd be able to see it my
[40:56] way or this brother saints of God wait
[41:00] we're a family we are a body
[41:06] just like he says here he says Moses had
[41:08] patience with the people they complained
[41:12] and bellyached after Miracle after
[41:16] Miracle after Vindication after
[41:18] Vindication and God what showed them
[41:21] continually that Moses was the one
[41:23] whether he was the he was the microphone
[41:25] he was the one to listen to and God was
[41:27] going to speak to him and him alone
[41:29] and the people complained and complained
[41:31] and complained and Moses stood in that
[41:33] gap for 40 years
[41:36] millions of people and he stood in the
[41:39] gap
[41:41] look that's what caused them not to go
[41:44] over see if you're trying to do
[41:45] something
[41:46] so that patience that Divine patience
[41:49] you'll have patience with God and your
[41:51] brother and sister
[41:57] can't they can't see the Deep things
[42:02] maybe they're just slow growing
[42:05] I will say this I will say this that
[42:08] when we see someone come into the word
[42:10] of God like such I've seen them grow so
[42:13] fast in Revelation and understanding and
[42:17] and be able to grasp the deeper things
[42:19] of God within a year or two just like
[42:20] that after they get baptized they start
[42:22] hearing that coming to church listening
[42:24] to the word of God and they grew rapidly
[42:26] many times they go Way Beyond me
[42:29] and understanding and types and shadows
[42:31] those sort of things amen right
[42:33] absolutely now
[42:35] he says like I've tried he says to get
[42:38] this message over
[42:41] he says now notice he says and we should
[42:44] have patience with one another too see
[42:46] one time we can get someone patient with
[42:47] one of the others and the prophet goes
[42:49] on he says like I've tried to get this
[42:51] message over to the Tabernacle he's to
[42:53] to see that each member of the
[42:55] Tabernacle become this he's preaching
[42:57] what to his own church he says I'm
[42:59] trying to get them what to the stature
[43:00] of Christ to get them to this measure
[43:02] right he said he said uh he said it's
[43:06] hard to do I've tried to have patience
[43:08] this is 33 years see
[43:11] Malachi 4 still could not get his church
[43:13] in line with this
[43:17] though he had this
[43:19] though he had this
[43:21] you're dealing this this the two signs
[43:24] you cannot get them to submit down to
[43:26] that
[43:27] he says have patience women still Bob
[43:30] their hair just the same just have but
[43:32] just have patience see just have
[43:34] patience wait have to it ain't got to if
[43:38] you ain't got it don't try to build on
[43:39] on this down here just have patience
[43:43] no matter what you're seeing let's say
[43:45] like there's something in the I don't
[43:46] know any problems here if there's if
[43:48] there is any but if there's a problem
[43:49] here just wait on it
[43:52] just wait on God
[43:53] God will fix everything
[43:55] because remember at the end he said he
[43:57] would he said he would restore all
[43:59] things
[44:01] so right now what we see look beyond
[44:03] that and see the Unseen amen see that
[44:05] brother and sister perfect see that
[44:07] brother uh just living as clean as he
[44:09] ever could that sister clean and this
[44:11] this see it all as a finished work amen
[44:13] as Christ sees you when you when you sin
[44:16] and mess up or have this thought to do
[44:18] that why doesn't God strike you dead
[44:20] because what you are under the blood of
[44:22] Christ and he only sees himself he sees
[44:25] you perfect already from the foundations
[44:28] of the world and if we could catch the
[44:31] same eyes not even the mind but let
[44:33] these eyes be in you which was in Christ
[44:36] that he sees each one of you as pure and
[44:38] holy amen yes and you someone says well
[44:42] brother listen just giving them excuse
[44:43] oh it's okay he'll come through it or
[44:45] she'll come through it all is well amen
[44:48] right yes
[44:50] yes yes yes
[44:52] now
[44:55] in Exodus 3 and 1.
[44:59] how he started there
[45:01] now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[45:04] father-in-law uh the priest Dominion he
[45:07] led the flock to the backside of the
[45:09] desert and came to the Mountain of God
[45:10] even to Horeb and the angel Lord
[45:12] appeared in him in a flame of fire out
[45:14] of the midst of the Bush and he looked
[45:15] and behold the Bush was burned of fire
[45:16] and the Bush was not consumed so here
[45:18] what takes place
[45:20] Moses sees a sign
[45:23] he sees
[45:24] a sight he sees something he's never
[45:27] seen before
[45:31] Supernatural
[45:32] and it was so Supernatural he looks at
[45:35] it and the Bible says what that he
[45:37] turned
[45:38] he says now I turn aside and see this
[45:40] great sight now notice God was waiting
[45:43] for that
[45:44] he says in the Lord he says and when the
[45:46] Lord saw thee he turned aside the sea
[45:48] see God was waiting to see if this sign
[45:51] and God knows how to appear to you and I
[45:53] he knows how to speak to you and I he
[45:54] knows how to move us he knows how to
[45:56] turn us amen it literally took I'll tell
[45:59] you after 40 years in the desert raising
[46:02] sheep it took God to come down it is a
[46:06] ball of fire and sit in the bush and
[46:07] just burn that's what that's what it
[46:10] took to catch Moses attention at the
[46:12] time amen something that big that's
[46:15] substantial why because something that
[46:17] big and that substantial is about ready
[46:19] to take place amen
[46:20] so the great God came down and now he
[46:24] saw a sign
[46:28] and when the Lord saw that he turned
[46:31] aside to see God called out unto him in
[46:33] the midst of the Bush and said Moses
[46:35] Moses and he said here am I
[46:37] so notice after this sign he's he
[46:40] actually he he turns aside and looks at
[46:43] it and now God speaks
[46:45] and the prophet of God would teach many
[46:48] times he says with every sign there is a
[46:50] voice
[46:52] with every Supernatural Southern you see
[46:54] there's always a voice a lot of times it
[46:56] goes with it
[46:59] so what must we check
[47:01] is the sign an absolute
[47:03] or should the voice be the absolute
[47:06] you check the voice
[47:09] because remember when God when Moses
[47:11] heard we saw he saw this light come down
[47:13] in this bush
[47:15] that voice said behold Moses he says he
[47:18] says aye what do you saying he says
[47:19] Moses Moses he said here am I he called
[47:21] out to him he knew his name I'll say it
[47:24] like that how did this bush how'd that
[47:26] voice or whatever was in this bush know
[47:28] the name of Moses
[47:29] sure he said here am I he's a draw not
[47:32] hither and if you look down Beyond it
[47:34] was a scriptural voice because God said
[47:37] he says I am the god of Abraham Isaac
[47:39] and Jacob he says and I have come down
[47:41] to deliver my people right and that was
[47:44] prophesied up 400 plus years beyond that
[47:47] and take them into the promised land
[47:49] which was promised to Abraham Isaac and
[47:51] Jacob right so notice every every sign
[47:54] will have a voice or the majority time
[47:56] there's a sign there's a voice and
[47:58] you've got to check that voice by the
[48:00] word amen by the scripture
[48:04] then not those in Matthew 7 says Lord
[48:06] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[48:08] and cast out tongues in thy name and
[48:09] cast out demons in a name and done many
[48:11] wonderful Works in thy name right but
[48:14] what we must see though those were signs
[48:16] and wonders we must see what was being
[48:18] taught amen the voice behind those signs
[48:21] what was the voice and God discerned The
[48:23] Voice he said your workers of iniquity
[48:25] right
[48:26] absolutely sure
[48:28] now let's continue on here
[48:33] and if you look at this dealing with
[48:36] these what God was doing right there
[48:43] when it comes down to the whole story
[48:46] Moses was told he says I've come down
[48:48] and I need you to go into Egypt and
[48:50] deliver my people
[48:52] and Moses made all these excuses he says
[48:55] well I can't talk and I'm not smart and
[48:57] I'm old and this and that and God said
[49:00] and God actually got angry with him he
[49:02] says who's doing this me or you who's in
[49:06] this voice right here me or you
[49:08] can set them who's on fire and who's not
[49:11] right
[49:12] now notice in Exodus 4-1 and Moses
[49:15] answered and said but behold they will
[49:17] not believe me nor hearken into my voice
[49:19] for they will say the Lord hath not
[49:21] appeared unto thee so here is a prophet
[49:24] who gets a sign with a voice and is
[49:26] scriptural so the prophet said this is
[49:28] thus saith the Lord
[49:30] and then now he's called to go to the
[49:32] people he's supposed to deal with God
[49:34] says he says
[49:36] he says
[49:37] there Moses said they're not going to
[49:38] listen to me and God says he says what
[49:40] is in their hand and he said oh rod
[49:43] and he said cast it upon the ground and
[49:45] he casted upon the ground and it became
[49:47] a serpent and Moses fled from before it
[49:49] and Moses said unto the in the Lord's
[49:52] unto Moses put forth thine hand and take
[49:54] it by the tail and he put forth his hand
[49:56] and caught it and became a rod in his
[49:58] hand that they may believe the Lord God
[50:00] of their fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[50:03] hath appeared unto thee right
[50:07] so notice there was a sign give or
[50:10] there's a sign given and it was a
[50:12] supernatural sign as well right
[50:17] and let me jump
[50:20] let me hit this real quick
[50:27] if you look at
[50:29] second Timothy
[50:32] now we know the story right Moses
[50:34] actually did go down to pharaoh and he
[50:37] and Moses said you got to let my people
[50:38] go we've got to let God's people go
[50:39] we've got to go worship we've got to
[50:40] we're taking them out of here and
[50:42] Pharaoh says no he says so Moses does
[50:45] exactly what the Lord says he takes his
[50:46] Rod drops it on the ground and it
[50:49] becomes a snake and Moses and the
[50:50] Pharaoh is looking at this
[50:52] and he's saying
[50:53] he calls his wise men out right
[50:56] his magicians and they performed the
[50:58] very same thing right
[51:02] and what remember children remember what
[51:04] takes place
[51:05] that Rod of Moses came and swallowed up
[51:08] the other two snakes right
[51:15] now how many magicians were there
[51:16] according to scripture
[51:18] there was two of them Janice and jambres
[51:22] he says now as Janice and jambers with
[51:24] student Moses so did these also resist
[51:27] the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[51:29] concerning the faith right now notice if
[51:32] you think about this I'll say like this
[51:36] if you think about that
[51:38] that was a sign right this one rod would
[51:41] turn into a snake and the other odds of
[51:44] The Magicians would turn to snakes and
[51:46] that one snake would swallow up two what
[51:49] does Scripture say would be swallowed up
[51:53] death would be swallowed up in Victory
[51:55] but how many deaths are there
[51:58] two deaths the first death and the
[52:02] second death showing what that this
[52:04] natural life right here there would be
[52:06] some that would Escape it because the
[52:08] scripture says he says for this
[52:10] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[52:12] this Mortal must put on immortality so
[52:15] in this corrupt that will have put on
[52:16] immoral and Corruption and this Mortal
[52:18] shall put on immortality then shall be
[52:21] brought to pass the saying that is
[52:22] written death is swallowed up in Victory
[52:25] saints of God when you have received the
[52:28] Holy Ghost and you make this Rapture you
[52:30] bypass the first snake and you bypass
[52:33] that second Snake
[52:35] once you receive the Holy Ghost you are
[52:37] no longer in danger what of going to the
[52:40] second death which is the Lake of Fire
[52:41] right absolutely notice this power is
[52:44] it's exactly scriptural sure now
[52:47] think on this um
[52:50] uh now the second sign
[52:55] let's see here
[52:57] and the second sign he said he says put
[52:58] now forth in thine hand thy bosom and he
[53:01] put his hand into his bosom and when he
[53:03] took it behold his his hand it was
[53:04] leprous as snow what does that leprosy
[53:06] represent sin right he says he says and
[53:10] leprosis it was leprous as snow and he
[53:12] put forth I and he said put forth I hand
[53:14] again into thy bosom and he put his hand
[53:16] into his bosom again and plucked it out
[53:18] of his wisdom behold of the turn again
[53:20] as his other flesh
[53:23] these two signs are prophecy right
[53:27] these are absolutely prophecy what is
[53:29] this who was in the prophet of God said
[53:31] who was that hand he said that was Jesus
[53:33] Christ because he was the right hand of
[53:34] God the power what an authority of God
[53:37] right so what Jesus came and he was what
[53:40] he came and went and went and went to
[53:42] the bosom came out of the bosom became
[53:44] sin and then when he went back to the
[53:46] bosom and was revealed that he was no
[53:48] longer sin right we know those things
[53:49] right so those two signs were given to
[53:52] Moses now
[53:55] and that's exactly what the prophet said
[53:57] he says but the other two had voices of
[54:00] Prophecy okay
[54:05] let's see if I can find that scripture
[54:09] I got here somewhere
[54:22] yeah there's so John 1 and 17. he says
[54:25] for the law was given by Moses but Grace
[54:27] and Truth came by Jesus Christ but no
[54:30] man has seen the father at any time the
[54:32] only begotten son which is in the bosom
[54:34] of the father he hath declared him so
[54:36] the sun came out of the bosom and then
[54:38] had what come back in sure now
[54:41] he says right here he says and it came
[54:43] to pass and it shall come to pass Jesus
[54:46] God said that if they will not believe
[54:48] thee nor hearken he says to the voice of
[54:51] the first sign that they will that that
[54:53] they will believe the voice of the
[54:55] latter sign
[54:56] uh so here each one of these signs was
[54:59] given a voice
[55:01] and the prophet said this
[55:04] he says now watch he said
[55:08] he said uh
[55:10] man where did that go oh that's I just
[55:12] read it sorry
[55:15] he said but the other two voices he's
[55:17] talking about the third he said the
[55:18] other two voices were prophetic
[55:21] so when Moses went and did this hand in
[55:23] front of the Pharaoh when he did this
[55:24] hand in front of the the his his
[55:27] brothers and sisters the Israelis uh the
[55:29] Jews and when he did the snake and all
[55:31] those sort of things there was nothing
[55:32] said
[55:33] but these voices were the voices of the
[55:35] prophecy that they were prophetic they
[55:38] actually these signs were signs that
[55:40] would come with a voice and these voice
[55:41] the voices was Jesus Christ
[55:44] right absolutely sorry now
[55:48] let's continue on here
[55:52] and then the third thing that would come
[55:54] to pass if they did not believe the
[55:56] voice the two voice the two signs he
[55:58] says it shall come to pass if they
[56:00] believe not also these two signs neither
[56:03] hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt
[56:05] tank of the water of the rivers and pour
[56:08] upon dry land he says and the water
[56:10] which thou take us out of the river
[56:12] shall become blood upon dry land
[56:15] so to reject the first pull to reject
[56:18] the second pull
[56:20] there was literally nothing else left
[56:22] but judgment
[56:24] and the prophet said he said this was
[56:26] judgment when it comes down to blood now
[56:28] water their life Source what the user
[56:32] the plants uh to to irrigate to their
[56:35] plants to feed their sheep to feed their
[56:37] oxen their their cattle when he takes
[56:39] that Life Source away in terms of the
[56:41] blood he says there's nothing left but
[56:42] judgment
[56:45] right he says now watch that third sign
[56:47] he give them was not related to his
[56:48] occupation neither was it related to his
[56:51] person his third sign notice the other
[56:53] two signs are related to him himself his
[56:56] occupation but they were the only two
[56:57] signs the Bible said had a voice right
[56:59] the other sign didn't have a voice but
[57:02] the two signs that was given was from
[57:04] his own person to his people and had
[57:06] voices
[57:08] but the third sign now notice it was
[57:10] given the sign the third sign was the
[57:12] sign of death
[57:14] so saints of God it's as as we had
[57:17] Malachi 4 come and he was given those
[57:20] two signs as well as they rejected those
[57:23] things
[57:25] I'll say like this they accepted the
[57:26] signs but they rejected the voice of the
[57:28] sign
[57:29] the prophet not only had two sons but he
[57:32] had a voice and they loved him when he
[57:34] did this when he had the healing when he
[57:36] had the sermon they loved him but when
[57:38] he started bringing the voice of God and
[57:40] the word back when they rejected that
[57:42] there's nothing left but death right
[57:45] absolutely now
[57:49] and as this as he would drop the first
[57:52] judgment and we know there was ten
[57:53] judgments right
[57:56] and it went on and on
[57:59] from from lice to to frogs and to uh
[58:04] light and darkness and then to uh death
[58:06] of the firstborn and God did all that
[58:11] but what was the trigger what was what
[58:12] triggered all of this
[58:14] what triggered all of this
[58:18] and then when they when Pharaoh finally
[58:20] did let him go they went into the
[58:21] Wilderness and they came to the Red Sea
[58:23] and God parted the Red Sea
[58:26] and God did another miracle for the
[58:27] Israel
[58:29] but what triggered it
[58:33] this is literally a type of the third
[58:35] pole of what's coming
[58:37] he said brother Brown said he says he
[58:38] says once this bride is able to come
[58:40] into into Perfection the way they're
[58:42] supposed to and coming to speaking
[58:44] conditions what they'll be able to open
[58:46] and shut those
[58:47] heavens and earth they'll be able to
[58:49] they'll be able to do control nature and
[58:51] do all these things and and as the Lord
[58:53] would lead them right
[58:55] but what was the trigger
[58:58] what started this whole thing
[59:04] in Exodus 3 7.
[59:08] in Exodus 3 7. and the Lord said I have
[59:11] surely seen the Affliction of my people
[59:14] which are in Egypt
[59:16] and I have heard their cry
[59:23] by reason of their task Masters
[59:26] for I know their sorrows
[59:29] and I am come down to deliver them out
[59:31] of the hand of the Egyptians do you see
[59:33] yourself here do you see what we're
[59:35] gonna have to do to get out of here
[59:37] what was Revelations 10 God comes down
[59:40] what is what is the voice out Trump God
[59:43] descending
[59:45] to come to get his bride
[59:48] what what kind of position or situation
[59:51] are we going to be in to fulfill this
[59:53] prophecy
[59:55] I am come down to deliver on the hand of
[59:57] the Egyptians verse 9. now therefore
[1:00:00] Behold The Cry of the children of
[1:00:03] Israel's come upon me
[1:00:06] now God had everything in set he was set
[1:00:08] in stone the prophet was waiting
[1:00:11] the prophet was already born he tried to
[1:00:14] do it himself and he went off the scene
[1:00:15] but God had him holding place in the
[1:00:18] desert
[1:00:21] God was waiting on Israel to be tired of
[1:00:27] where they're at
[1:00:28] the entire move
[1:00:31] the entire judgment all the signs all
[1:00:33] the Miracles everything that took place
[1:00:35] after this
[1:00:37] was waiting on them
[1:00:42] when they were ready to make the move
[1:00:45] when we're I'll say this when we are
[1:00:47] ready for this rapture
[1:00:50] it'll happen
[1:00:51] when we cry out for the body when we are
[1:00:56] waiting if they're waiting we are he
[1:00:58] who's
[1:01:00] we have to be patient with God and God
[1:01:03] has been patient with us
[1:01:05] he is waiting for us to get tired of
[1:01:09] this life
[1:01:13] Enoch he said I'm just sick of this I'm
[1:01:16] just going home today I'm just when he's
[1:01:18] what the Bob the Bible said he just went
[1:01:19] on and walked with God and walked right
[1:01:22] up to Glory
[1:01:23] he got just tired of his everyday life
[1:01:29] notice Psalms 50.
[1:01:35] Psalms 50.
[1:01:38] verse 14.
[1:01:43] everything is set up ready to go
[1:01:48] the big machinery that God has
[1:01:50] everything is ready setting waiting
[1:01:54] it's been fueled up it's been lubed up
[1:01:58] everything is right there
[1:02:01] Psalms 50 14 offer unto God Thanksgiving
[1:02:04] and pay thy vows upon the most unto the
[1:02:07] most high and call upon me in the day of
[1:02:11] trouble
[1:02:12] I will deliver thee and thou shalt
[1:02:15] glorify me
[1:02:17] there it is
[1:02:19] what is the what is the day of the Lord
[1:02:21] the day of the Lord is not a a good
[1:02:24] thing it's either Darkness nor lion it's
[1:02:27] a day of just
[1:02:28] it's day of judgment right
[1:02:30] look at this Psalms 18. verse 1.
[1:02:35] he says to the chief musician the psalm
[1:02:37] of David the the servant of the Lord who
[1:02:39] spake unto the Lord the words of the
[1:02:41] song and the day of the Lord delivered
[1:02:42] him from the hand of his all of his
[1:02:44] enemies and the Hand of Saul and he said
[1:02:46] I he says I love thee O Lord my strength
[1:02:49] the Lord is my rock and my Fortress my
[1:02:52] deliverer my God my strength in whom I
[1:02:55] will trust my buckler the Horn of my
[1:02:57] salvation and my high tower I will call
[1:02:59] upon the Lord now remember when did when
[1:03:02] did Davis write David sing the song or
[1:03:04] write the song it was directly after he
[1:03:07] took what the last battle with the
[1:03:08] Philistines those last four giants to
[1:03:12] fall David got weak and one of job's
[1:03:15] job's Brothers came and saved him and
[1:03:16] and said he said we can't you've got to
[1:03:18] stay home now why because you're the
[1:03:19] light of Israel you've got to stay home
[1:03:21] right he says and David said God you
[1:03:23] deliver him one time you need the
[1:03:25] inspiration of the Holy Ghost hit him
[1:03:27] and he started Penning he says God has
[1:03:29] delivery from what all my enemies from
[1:03:31] Saul which is a denominational
[1:03:33] organizational Spirit he delivered me
[1:03:35] from all this and all he had to do was
[1:03:38] what call upon the Lord now notice
[1:03:42] what kind of situation was David in the
[1:03:45] Sorrows of death Compass me there it is
[1:03:48] the sorrow's death he saw it coming
[1:03:50] David out of breath he probably just
[1:03:52] killed someone he's out of breath
[1:03:53] holding a sword like this just trying to
[1:03:55] get he was older he was trying to get
[1:03:58] some air and one of the Giants from
[1:04:00] across the field saw him he'd probably
[1:04:02] just slew the Israelite and he said this
[1:04:05] is the opportunity he's running towards
[1:04:07] the king
[1:04:09] and Dave is like
[1:04:11] here he comes what death was coming but
[1:04:15] one of his brothers amen a mighty
[1:04:18] warrior a gentile Warriors came in and
[1:04:21] slew the Giant and saved him amen that's
[1:04:24] exactly right that's the kind of
[1:04:25] inspiration where death is right there
[1:04:27] right there you're about ready to be
[1:04:29] expired put down in pain and suffering
[1:04:32] and what someone steps in and saves you
[1:04:35] and he gives does he give that brother
[1:04:36] any Glory he gives it to God
[1:04:39] I'll say it like that he never meant
[1:04:42] once mentioned this brother that saved
[1:04:44] him he gave all the glory to Jesus
[1:04:47] Christ because God knew that the Lord
[1:04:50] David knew that God had to anoint this
[1:04:52] brother and saw that giant coming he uh
[1:04:55] he's a hell or whoever saw saw the whole
[1:04:59] scene
[1:05:00] he might have just slew someone too took
[1:05:02] a little break saw David hurt and this
[1:05:04] guy seated him and he's like run into
[1:05:05] intercede amen saints of God that's a
[1:05:08] perfect thing for prayer right there if
[1:05:10] you see your brother and your sister
[1:05:11] down and out or going through something
[1:05:13] get on your knees and pray him through
[1:05:16] amen do something for him to encourage
[1:05:18] him amen and what God will stop what you
[1:05:21] will stop that death from hitting them
[1:05:23] amen that's why we pray for our brothers
[1:05:25] and sisters he said now notice he says
[1:05:27] the Sorrows of Hell come it's about me
[1:05:29] the snares of death prevented me he says
[1:05:31] in my distressed I called upon the Lord
[1:05:36] see what took place the Giants running
[1:05:38] David's here breathing he said Lord
[1:05:40] Jesus help me god Jehovah deliver me
[1:05:45] he called from what and he knew that
[1:05:47] what God was with him and he cried unto
[1:05:49] my God he heard my voice out of his
[1:05:52] Temple notice he knew that he was not
[1:05:54] his own he knew what he was here to
[1:05:56] serve God Amen as we are too once you
[1:05:59] receive the Holy Ghost once you have the
[1:06:01] spirit the indwelling spirit of God you
[1:06:02] become the literal temple of God oh how
[1:06:05] we ought to behave ourselves how we
[1:06:07] ought to watch what we see uh taken with
[1:06:09] our eyes taken with our ears and speak
[1:06:11] with our mouth amen sure
[1:06:13] yes he heard my voice out of his Temple
[1:06:16] and My Cry came before him even unto his
[1:06:18] ears
[1:06:22] now why does this why am I reading this
[1:06:23] because this is this is literally the
[1:06:25] type of the Rapture right here
[1:06:26] this is your rapture
[1:06:29] now notice as David is he's bringing
[1:06:32] these things he's saying how he's
[1:06:34] delivered and this and that
[1:06:36] if you look what happened in his
[1:06:38] distress he says I called into the Lord
[1:06:40] and Cried unto my God and he heard my
[1:06:42] voice out of his Temple and my Craig Cry
[1:06:44] came before him even into his ears and
[1:06:47] the Earth Shook and trembled the
[1:06:49] foundations also of the hills were moved
[1:06:51] and were shaken because he was Roth
[1:06:53] there went up smoke out of his mouth
[1:06:56] nostrils and fire on his mouth devoured
[1:06:58] the coals were kindled he bowed the
[1:07:00] heavens also and came down
[1:07:04] this is the situation the bride's going
[1:07:06] to be in it's going to be a battle it's
[1:07:09] going to be very close to death
[1:07:12] that's exactly right
[1:07:14] he cuts he catches us right before what
[1:07:16] the Great Tribulation starts in
[1:07:19] the persecution those things are
[1:07:21] striking the Earth right and what God
[1:07:23] can comes down and delivers him
[1:07:26] in verse 13 the Lord also thundered in
[1:07:29] the heavens and the highest gave his
[1:07:31] voice see right there's your thunders at
[1:07:33] the same time and now notice in verse 16
[1:07:35] he says he sent from above he he took me
[1:07:39] and Drew me out of many Waters there's
[1:07:43] your rapture right there
[1:07:45] but what was God waiting for this entire
[1:07:47] time he's waiting for David to cry out
[1:07:49] and say Lord help
[1:07:51] Lord deliver me
[1:07:54] yes amen
[1:07:55] now
[1:07:58] look here
[1:08:01] so God is waiting for us
[1:08:06] there's a there there's there's we see
[1:08:08] things being set up in this rapid so
[1:08:11] rapid
[1:08:12] what if
[1:08:14] in Target they would have set up those
[1:08:15] things back 30 years ago
[1:08:17] with those shirts and
[1:08:19] that filth like that that perversion
[1:08:21] the miracle would have
[1:08:24] what insane
[1:08:26] it's been so much uh
[1:08:28] backlash on that but now it seems like
[1:08:31] it's just growing you can't stop I've
[1:08:32] heard even Chick-fil-A's into this now
[1:08:35] saints of God it's coming
[1:08:38] all that will not
[1:08:40] take the mark of the beast or go into
[1:08:41] the system will be killed
[1:08:45] this thing is rapidly approaching
[1:08:49] now notice in verse in James 5 and 7 be
[1:08:53] patient therefore Brethren unto the
[1:08:55] coming of the Lord behold the husbandman
[1:08:57] waited
[1:08:59] he's waiting on on us and we're waiting
[1:09:02] for him
[1:09:03] notice he waited for the precious fruit
[1:09:05] of the earth and had long patience for
[1:09:08] it until he received the early and the
[1:09:10] latter rain
[1:09:12] be ye also patient so notice God's being
[1:09:14] patient and you must be patient as well
[1:09:18] establish your hearts for the coming of
[1:09:20] the Lord draweth nigh
[1:09:23] here's when two omnipotent patients meet
[1:09:27] something must take place
[1:09:32] say to God and we are waiting on the
[1:09:35] Lord but Saints he is waiting on us
[1:09:38] saints of God if there's a time to cry
[1:09:40] and call out for desperation it's right
[1:09:42] now
[1:09:43] right now
[1:09:45] and never since since I've been alive
[1:09:48] and probably you've been alive have they
[1:09:50] been saying the economy this thing's
[1:09:52] going to be bad it's coming it's coming
[1:09:53] I don't know have you has anyone ever
[1:09:55] studied the Great Depression
[1:09:58] you have
[1:09:59] were they saying before months and years
[1:10:01] before that there's a Great Depression
[1:10:03] coming
[1:10:05] took them as a snare
[1:10:07] they took them as a snare
[1:10:09] and people lost everything their Banks
[1:10:11] did it bail in instead of a bail out and
[1:10:15] they lost all their money people suicide
[1:10:18] and going insane and
[1:10:19] average dirt poor and there was no
[1:10:23] warning we are getting warning after
[1:10:26] warning they're blasting it on their
[1:10:29] headlines they're saying this now this
[1:10:32] this bubble is going to burst this
[1:10:33] bubble is going to burst this bubble is
[1:10:34] going to burst saints of God there God
[1:10:36] is trying to speak to us what if brother
[1:10:39] Brown was here right now what would he
[1:10:40] what would he preach sing the Highland
[1:10:42] headlines
[1:10:43] for the grandpa from the headlines all
[1:10:45] the time
[1:10:46] you hear in science they just did this
[1:10:48] and watch the politics is corrupted
[1:10:51] what would he be saying right now
[1:10:54] he said we better pray
[1:10:57] amen right
[1:11:00] now notice what the prophet God said
[1:11:01] here
[1:11:02] he says oh that we need today is a
[1:11:04] calling together a great a getting ready
[1:11:06] and not depending on the preacher but
[1:11:08] you as an individual before God making
[1:11:12] yourself ready for the coming of the
[1:11:14] Lord to escape all this corruption
[1:11:16] no matter what they call you or what
[1:11:19] action they take that doesn't change God
[1:11:21] one bit he says God will do it just the
[1:11:23] same he's depending and waiting on us oh
[1:11:26] my
[1:11:28] he's waiting on us some people say well

[1:11:34] fine preacher that's good and I
[1:11:36] appreciate that he says and you are an
[1:11:37] America of the world whoever it is but

[1:11:41] message from the pulpit it takes your
[1:11:43] life it takes you to get ready
[1:11:45] he's literally waiting for us
[1:11:47] to get ready
[1:11:50] so brother Randy was texting me and he's
[1:11:52] just a Revelator
[1:11:54] and he was saying he said
[1:11:56] he said brother side you ever notice how
[1:11:58] when they when the world like has
[1:12:00] something like demonic or they have the
[1:12:02] devil they always put fire around it
[1:12:06] like you always see Flames or this or
[1:12:08] that you know dealing with
[1:12:09] he said and yet the Bible says
[1:12:12] in Revelations 3
[1:12:14] he said God said I'd rather you have be
[1:12:17] hot or cold
[1:12:19] on fire or freezing and not live warm
[1:12:23] literally they're they're saying the
[1:12:24] devil's got the fire when he doesn't the
[1:12:27] devil is literally the coldest being on
[1:12:30] the face
[1:12:31] that ever was if the bride of Christ is
[1:12:34] supposed to be fired up I'm saying the
[1:12:36] fire the who is fire the fire is Jesus
[1:12:39] Christ he is a what a consuming fire
[1:12:41] he's the one that one can set a man and
[1:12:43] send them a blaze absolutely that's the
[1:12:45] one the brother said he says you light
[1:12:46] one man on fire and they'll come from a
[1:12:48] from miles and miles to watch The Man
[1:12:50] live to watch the man preach the watch
[1:12:52] the man uh act however what and that's
[1:12:55] what catches that's what that's what
[1:12:57] stopped Moses was what the pillar of
[1:12:59] fire right there
[1:13:02] Satan's the most coldest being
[1:13:05] there ever was
[1:13:07] hates everything evil I was like that's
[1:13:11] that's really good
[1:13:14] anybody now
[1:13:15] he says in Revelations 19 verse 7 he
[1:13:18] said the Bible said speaking of the
[1:13:20] bride of Christ she hath made herself
[1:13:22] ready she hath made herself ready and
[1:13:24] you as a member of this bride you've got
[1:13:26] to make yourself
[1:13:28] ready
[1:13:31] 1958
[1:13:34] he said that was a historical God that
[1:13:36] gave this promise and we're the people
[1:13:38] today of his pasture we're the Sheep of
[1:13:40] his fold
[1:13:41] and he's waiting on us to stand and call
[1:13:44] him on the action 1958.
[1:13:48] he's waiting for us
[1:13:49] to really stand saints of God I'll say
[1:13:52] like this what is what is God requiring
[1:13:54] here
[1:13:55] because I'm in I I was sitting in the
[1:14:00] in the the the the the
[1:14:02] the Job trailer with a bunch of guys 10
[1:14:04] guys
[1:14:05] and you know how that is
[1:14:08] and you know what I did I just was quiet
[1:14:10] Sat by myself
[1:14:12] to say my my my lunch or break you know
[1:14:16] yogurt whatever
[1:14:17] just I'm ignoring it
[1:14:20] or should I be in there
[1:14:23] tearing that place up
[1:14:27] what we'll call the God on the scene I
[1:14:29] wonder
[1:14:31] see I'm trying to examine myself because
[1:14:33] Lord is this how I'm supposed to be or
[1:14:35] am I supposed to be so on fire not
[1:14:38] trying to separate from the world but
[1:14:40] now we're saints of God we're supposed
[1:14:41] to be pleading for lost souls these
[1:14:44] people are going to go to hell
[1:14:46] they're going to miss the Rapture
[1:14:48] they're going to go into Great
[1:14:49] Tribulation
[1:14:51] should not I be like gosh quit talking
[1:14:54] like this watch your borrows let's talk
[1:14:57] about God or get out
[1:15:00] what should I be doing
[1:15:03] and then you know what's going there's
[1:15:04] going to be backlash on that people are
[1:15:06] not going to like that very much
[1:15:08] they're not going to be pleased with my
[1:15:11] actions
[1:15:12] and what at that time I'm gonna have to
[1:15:15] say well you're the Lord's gonna have to
[1:15:16] judge between me and you
[1:15:19] is that what he's looking for
[1:15:22] what was the message of John the Baptist
[1:15:25] he come out of the Wilderness repent for
[1:15:27] the kingdom of God is at hand
[1:15:29] repent he says repent for the king and
[1:15:32] as John the Baptist was taken to prison
[1:15:34] who took up that same message Jesus did
[1:15:38] he said repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:15:40] is at hand he mentioned and the first
[1:15:42] word was repent
[1:15:44] and as he would send his disciples and
[1:15:47] John
[1:15:48] six or seven five however he's told us
[1:15:51] two disciples he sent him two by two he
[1:15:53] says he told them what is your message
[1:15:54] he said preach repent for the kingdom of
[1:15:58] God is ahead
[1:15:59] the Kingdom of Heaven is hand
[1:16:02] he's waiting us to stand and make and
[1:16:05] call him on the action call him on the
[1:16:07] scene watch him go into movements watch
[1:16:10] him do the Supreme watch them do the
[1:16:13] thing that God will that man will wander
[1:16:15] and scratch their heads and not
[1:16:17] understand it
[1:16:20] he wants someone to stand there and say
[1:16:22] no the Lord wants this
[1:16:25] and see what God does and watch God back
[1:16:28] him
[1:16:29] he says and not understanding he's a
[1:16:31] he's a historical God in a present day
[1:16:34] God he's waiting to be called out of
[1:16:35] History I'll say it like this there's
[1:16:37] been a couple times that's happened one
[1:16:39] time I was backpacking in New Hampshire
[1:16:41] and I met a through hiker
[1:16:44] his name was Bootlegger you live names
[1:16:46] Bootlegger so me and him went to this
[1:16:48] Barn
[1:16:51] and we're up there because we rented a
[1:16:53] little cot to sleep and open this Barn
[1:16:56] and I told him I said
[1:16:57] I can't remember his name it's called
[1:16:58] boolier it's a bootlegger
[1:17:01] and I started bringing down serpent seed
[1:17:04] and showing how this and this and this
[1:17:06] and he's just like whoa that's wild
[1:17:07] because he was Catholic I said Kane was
[1:17:09] this and Abel was this and settled this
[1:17:11] and how they mingled and this and that
[1:17:13] and I said why do I said I said why do
[1:17:16] you think they can't find the missing
[1:17:17] link and when I said that he goes hold
[1:17:19] on I gotta go to the bathroom she walks
[1:17:20] downstairs in the barn goes to the
[1:17:22] bathroom and there was other through
[1:17:23] hikers watching a science documentary
[1:17:25] down there and he comes back up he goes
[1:17:27] Simon you're gonna believe this the guy
[1:17:29] down there does she said he says we
[1:17:30] can't find the missing link
[1:17:32] laughs
[1:17:34] he goes why'd it happen I said it was
[1:17:36] for you to prove that this was true and
[1:17:39] what he was scratching his head that
[1:17:40] night
[1:17:42] something like that but what did it take
[1:17:44] I had to open my mouth and say something
[1:17:46] bring some correction try to bring some
[1:17:48] enlightening to the man amen and then
[1:17:51] here God comes down and vindicates it
[1:17:52] just below sure
[1:17:54] yes amen
[1:17:57] now let's let's stand here by God's
[1:17:59] grace
[1:18:01] just a little cut up study here by God's
[1:18:03] grace but we are trying to
[1:18:05] see the where we're what we're supposed
[1:18:07] to do what he's what's what's going to
[1:18:08] happen next
[1:18:11] you say well brother Brandon you say
[1:18:13] let's let us
[1:18:14] that's what God's waiting on
[1:18:16] we're waiting on Jesus to return and
[1:18:19] Jesus is waiting on us
[1:18:21] you say well how can we do what can we
