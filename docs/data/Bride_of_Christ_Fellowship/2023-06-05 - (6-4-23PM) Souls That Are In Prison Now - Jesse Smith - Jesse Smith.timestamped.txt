[0:00] spot start there
[0:02] as I told you this morning I'd like to
[0:03] preach on Souls that are in prison now
[0:06] just kind of preach through the whole
[0:07] sermon that brother Brandon preached
[0:09] I'll probably get about a third of the
[0:10] way through tonight Lord willing we'll
[0:12] kind of see how things go you know
[0:14] sometimes it turns out different than
[0:15] you think it's going to go
[0:17] but
[0:18] after all these sermons just on the
[0:20] Bible the Bible and I pull in a little
[0:21] bit of brother Branham I like to just
[0:23] kind of go through some of his sermons
[0:24] and just get kind of deep into some of
[0:26] his teachings here
[0:28] we normally don't cover I told Jose
[0:29] before he left I said brother I'm going
[0:31] to preaching a little bit on the third
[0:32] poll tonight so I told him I said well
[0:33] you can listen in if you want
[0:35] I said you might like that topic
[0:38] and just for Lena since it's new to her
[0:40] the third poll is basically the third
[0:41] phase of brother Brown's Ministry
[0:44] he just had a vision where it was like
[0:46] he had he was fishing three times so a
[0:48] poll is like you know pulling in the
[0:51] line the fishing line you know
[0:55] it's kind of like the third phase of
[0:56] brother Adams Ministry and how and he
[0:59] connected it to the bride as well
[1:01] oh
[1:03] so we'll look at this here tonight by
[1:05] God's grace Jude
[1:09] 1 5 and 6 Jude one five and six
[1:14] Souls that are imprisoned now
[1:16] it's been kind of strangely drawn to
[1:18] this sermon the last few months I've
[1:19] been listening to this one off and on
[1:20] and yesterday I went through it and I
[1:22] took a lot of notes on it so we'll be
[1:24] looking at that here tonight
[1:26] since we have three of them I'll read
[1:28] the first two
[1:30] and then I'll read the first and the
[1:32] last we'll read the second because the
[1:33] last week we already read this morning
[1:35] Jude 5 6 says I will therefore put you
[1:38] in remembrance though ye once knew this
[1:39] that the Lord having saved the people
[1:42] out of the land of Egypt afterward
[1:43] destroyed them that believe not and the
[1:46] angels which kept not their first estate
[1:48] but left their own habitations these are
[1:51] the angels that became demons some of
[1:54] them he hath reserved in Everlasting
[1:56] chains under Darkness
[1:58] unto the Judgment of the great day
[2:01] so brother Ram noticed he says notice
[2:02] how the angels
[2:04] are reserved in Everlasting change
[2:06] there's some angels that are in Chains
[2:08] now no that's a that's an interesting
[2:10] topic I don't know a lot about that but
[2:12] the Bible says it and it's connected how
[2:15] their souls right in prison right now in
[2:17] the heart of the Earth right the little
[2:19] lost souls in prison
[2:21] okay let's read this one together though
[2:23] second Peter 2 4 and 5.
[2:29] there's a lot of wonderful things in
[2:30] this sermon by brother Brandon there's a
[2:32] few things that people misunderstand so
[2:33] I want to go over those that's part of
[2:34] the reason to go over it
[2:36] II Peter 2 4 and 5.
[2:43] and we can all read these together here
[2:44] by God's grace it's a little bit longer
[2:46] but if you can hear everyone's voice
[2:49] so to read read this on three one two
[2:50] three for if God spared not the angels
[2:54] that sinned but cast them down to Hell
[2:57] and deliver them into chains of Darkness
[3:00] to be reserved unto judgment and spared
[3:04] not the old world but save Noah the
[3:07] eighth person a preacher of
[3:10] righteousness bringing in the flood upon
[3:13] the world of the ungodly so again we see
[3:16] Angels right delivered into chains of
[3:18] Darkness reserved unto judgment so again
[3:21] we see angels that are in prison now
[3:24] okay then the last one I read this
[3:26] morning uh first Peter 3 18 19 and 20.
[3:29] I'll read that one
[3:32] for Christ also hath the once suffered
[3:35] for sins the just for the unjust that he
[3:37] might bring us to God being put to death
[3:39] in the flesh but quickened by the spirit
[3:42] here's the the main thought by which
[3:44] also he went and preached unto the
[3:46] spirits in prison
[3:49] of course those are lost souls in the
[3:51] prison in the heart of the earth and
[3:53] what brother random calls the region of
[3:55] the Lost
[3:56] verse 20 which sometimes were
[3:57] disobedient when Once the long-suffering
[4:00] of God waited in the days of Noah while
[4:02] the ark wasn't preparing where and few
[4:04] that is eight Souls were saved by water
[4:06] let's have one more word of prayer if we
[4:07] can hear it tonight by God's grace if
[4:09] you have a need on your heart let's make
[4:10] it known unto God I don't want to pray
[4:12] for Lena's sisters again Kyle Emma's
[4:16] travel
[4:17] as well here
[4:18] father God we thank you Lord we come
[4:20] into your presence with Grace and just
[4:22] worship to you Lord our all of our songs
[4:25] are for you Lord Jesus we thank you God
[4:27] for all you've done all your goodness
[4:28] you Porta upon us we want to come back
[4:30] and recognize it Lord thank you for your
[4:32] goodness and your mercy as we saw this
[4:34] morning thank you for salvation by grace
[4:36] alone Lord God not by works but Grace
[4:39] that no man would boast so we thank you
[4:41] and give you praise and now Lord this
[4:42] message is kind of the opposite Lord God
[4:44] this is this is the the warning if if
[4:47] people don't accept your Amazing Grace
[4:48] and try to earn it by works or
[4:51] go against it in defiance as as haters
[4:54] of God lord we never want to see people
[4:57] do this but Lord many many do because
[4:59] you said few there be that Friday so God
[5:02] I pray God you just guide us tonight
[5:04] Lord here by the word of God help me to
[5:06] to preach your word and Lord we also
[5:08] want to remember Emma she travels let
[5:10] your angel be with her Lord God protect
[5:12] her that she can get home enjoy her
[5:14] family time Lord God also be with Lena's
[5:16] sisters Lord God it just seems like Lord
[5:19] if you don't change anything we just got
[5:20] to keep praying how we love them we love
[5:23] to see them move here Lord God and
[5:25] become a part of the church but Lord
[5:27] we're just asking that your granted in
[5:28] your time and season in the meantime
[5:30] protect their lives Lord God let this be
[5:31] for a testimony for Venus Faith the
[5:34] church's Faith Austin's Faith we're all
[5:36] believing together that their souls can
[5:38] be saved and they could come to this
[5:39] church lorder some church that believes
[5:41] the truth Lord grant it dear God lastly
[5:44] we pray for Kyle Lord thank you for his
[5:46] kindness and I just pray God that his
[5:47] heart will open to the truth of your
[5:49] word and Lord the message is for him
[5:52] because the messages come out of her my
[5:54] people Lord God granted Lord Jesus if
[5:55] he's one of yours I pray you bring him
[5:58] out Lord God
[5:59] I thank you for this wonderful
[6:00] opportunity to be here thank you for 17
[6:02] years Lord with these Saints all these
[6:05] Saints in Jesus Christ name the Saints
[6:07] said amen God bless you as you're being
[6:09] seated praise God I do have some slides
[6:10] here like to show here
[6:14] we read our texts from Brother Branham
[6:16] here and I'll try to maybe just preach
[6:18] an hour like I said I want to get to
[6:21] I want to get to today I want to get to
[6:23] Four Points I think I'll just back up
[6:25] here I just if I had a title just Souls
[6:27] that are in prison now the first out of
[6:29] four or the first four important
[6:31] observations
[6:32] just been kind of drawn to this sermon I
[6:34] found a lot of good things in here then
[6:35] some things that are you know brother
[6:36] amps Human Side that we want to rightly
[6:38] divide you I want to rightly divide this
[6:40] sermon like we have to with every sermon
[6:42] has many truths but there's also some
[6:44] statements that are misunderstood and
[6:46] I'll just go straight in the order of
[6:49] the sermon like I said I've been doing a
[6:50] lot of just straight Bible teaching and
[6:52] bringing a little bit of quotes well
[6:54] this one's going to be mostly quotes and
[6:56] a little bit of scripture
[6:58] uh but it'd be good I thought it'd be a
[6:59] good refresher too to look at the third
[7:01] poll because I haven't talked about that
[7:02] I haven't preached about that for a
[7:03] while
[7:04] and I think it'd be Lena's first time
[7:06] hearing about the third pull
[7:09] so I I don't know I don't know how much
[7:11] you my children have in case you have
[7:12] you heard much about the third pole okay
[7:13] so yeah I haven't I haven't preached on
[7:15] it for years I mean
[7:16] the last time I preached on it I forget
[7:18] I think it was 2016. I was looking at it
[7:20] yesterday
[7:21] so it's been a while so the first thing
[7:23] with this sermon as you if you haven't
[7:25] listened to it it's November 10th 63 so
[7:29] it was let's see it was eight months
[7:32] after the Seven Seals were open
[7:35] and so brother Brown said he was just
[7:36] presuming in that's not I shouldn't be
[7:39] if it should be in
[7:40] he was just presuming in November
[7:43] of 63.
[7:47] um he was he was wondering
[7:49] uh was the hour of preaching was this
[7:52] the hour of preaching to the Eternal
[7:54] lost
[7:55] in other words brother bran was
[7:56] wondering if anybody could be saved
[7:57] anymore
[7:59] and there's a scriptural reason for that
[8:01] we see it in the Bible I won't get to it
[8:03] today but there was a time when Noah
[8:05] and his family were in the ark and no
[8:07] matter what they said no one else was
[8:10] going to get saved
[8:12] and then you know you have revelation 22
[8:15] 11. I'm just going to read that you've
[8:16] got your Bible you can read that with me
[8:17] there does come a time when no one else
[8:20] can be saved revelation 22 11.
[8:26] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[8:28] still and he which is filthy let him be
[8:30] filthy still and he that is righteous
[8:32] let him be righteous still and he that
[8:33] is Holy let him be holy still
[8:36] so there's going to come a time here at
[8:37] the end time when no one else is going
[8:40] to be saved
[8:41] of course our hearts break for that
[8:43] moment but it's happened in many many
[8:46] cases I was even thinking about Sodom
[8:48] and Gomorrah think about that Sodom and
[8:49] Gomorrah you know a lot couldn't save
[8:51] any more other than his three daughters
[8:53] or was it two daughters two daughters
[8:55] and his wife that come out and then his
[8:56] wife was lost
[8:58] um so they were preaching basically to
[8:59] the the Eternal lost
[9:02] so there's going to come a time and
[9:03] thank God it's not now thank God it's
[9:06] not now because we're still getting
[9:07] saved right people are still getting
[9:08] saved
[9:09] um but
[9:11] there there will come a time when this
[9:12] will be happening
[9:14] and even I believe the foolish version I
[9:15] believe they'll already be saved once
[9:17] they cross over the Rapture once of
[9:19] course they won't go in the Rapture but
[9:20] once they cross over the raptures pass
[9:21] and then they're in the tribulation I I
[9:23] don't see how they can be saved anymore
[9:25] they've already got to be saved
[9:27] right because God has now moved
[9:29] officially to the Jews he's raptured his
[9:31] bride the Gentile dispensation is over
[9:34] so it's a uh it's quite a subject so
[9:38] just so you know this whole sermon was a
[9:39] presumption brother random says it
[9:41] himself I'm not I didn't say that
[9:42] brother I'm going to read you the quote
[9:44] brother says I'm just presuming in this
[9:45] sermon
[9:47] so you have to be very careful and then
[9:49] it's sad that people can take this
[9:50] sermon and make it like nobody else gets
[9:52] saved and he just said I'm just
[9:54] presuming okay because he thought oh
[9:57] because of the experience he had at
[9:58] JCPenney we'll talk about that that's
[9:59] part of this here he had this experience
[10:02] um so here's how he starts this morning
[10:04] he said something struck my heart about
[10:05] a month ago that was the experience at
[10:06] JCPenney where it's like hell was
[10:08] blending in with the Earth
[10:12] um but we'll get to that in a moment
[10:13] here if you some like I know Lena hasn't
[10:15] heard that story
[10:16] but Brother Band constantly had vision
[10:18] and so there was so many Visions on tape
[10:20] and we got to take every Vision back to
[10:21] the word of God right we talked about
[10:23] that he says are they taping this yes so
[10:26] I want uh so that I would know where if
[10:29] the tape gets out to others I can't say
[10:30] that I'm going to speak on this morning
[10:31] I can't say it is I know it's right see
[10:33] the message part will be right but the
[10:35] thing that I want to do is a question in
[10:37] my mind
[10:38] it looks so real what are you saying it
[10:40] looks so real that time might be over
[10:43] first for people for people to be saved
[10:45] and yet since I come in it was revealed
[10:48] to me I have been so scared now look
[10:49] he's scared he's scared going to the
[10:51] pulpit
[10:53] then I'd say the wrong thing it might
[10:54] leave the wrong impression upon the
[10:56] people he says what I had notes wrote
[10:58] down or what I was going to say I cut
[11:00] part of it out so that I might not make
[11:01] it too strong because you see if a
[11:03] person I love the Lord God and the only
[11:05] way I love him is because I love you
[11:07] see so if you love each other then you
[11:09] know you love God right that's what the
[11:11] Bible says how can you love someone you
[11:13] can't see if you can't love the people
[11:14] you can see
[11:15] that's why it's so important to love
[11:17] people in this church right that proves
[11:19] you love God
[11:21] Hallelujah
[11:22] he says that's the only way I know yet I
[11:25] don't want to have anything that's
[11:26] revealed to me and not tell you
[11:29] if it's to tell you in church that's why
[11:31] you know when we do the uh
[11:33] when we do the kids Bible study I'll
[11:34] share things that I'll never share live
[11:37] because I want you to know everything I
[11:39] know that will help you in this life's
[11:40] journey sometimes I got to call names
[11:42] sometimes I gotta
[11:44] I just give examples
[11:46] dear friends and brothers or sisters in
[11:48] Christ or whatever you know sometimes I
[11:50] just got to be really plain because I
[11:51] want you to know everything I know so
[11:52] you're prepared for the coming of the
[11:54] Lord
[11:55] right and many times I say that you know
[11:57] so you'll be prepared for any trial or
[11:59] Temptation that might come so you'll be
[12:01] able to overcome that because the the
[12:03] last thing we want anyone to do is to
[12:05] Fall Away
[12:06] we want everyone to stand in the faith
[12:08] right and if I see people fall away and
[12:10] I know why they fell away then I'm going
[12:12] to tell you because I love you and I
[12:15] don't want you to fall away
[12:17] so brother Brown was the same way any
[12:18] Revelation he had he wanted to share
[12:19] with the people because he loved them
[12:21] okay so that's what this sermon is about
[12:23] sharing this experience he had in the
[12:25] JCPenney store it would have been
[12:27] October 63 because this is November 10th
[12:31] you can see it up there November 10th
[12:32] 63.
[12:35] um he doesn't want to hurt anybody he
[12:37] said you just have to almost just get to
[12:38] the platform and then feel led to say
[12:40] what you're going to say that's all and
[12:42] then sometimes you might say something
[12:43] and someone will get another slant to it
[12:45] they'd run off on that side then someone
[12:46] would say oh this is this see
[12:49] now look here's where he says it so does
[12:51] everybody know this I'm not making this
[12:52] up brother man said but I want you to
[12:53] know that what I'm saying is just
[12:56] presuming
[12:58] and the word presume means to Adventure
[13:00] without Authority so I don't say that
[13:02] this is true but it's just a little
[13:04] thought that I might drop along to you
[13:05] that you might weigh it out and see what
[13:07] you think about it now look he says it
[13:09] I'm gonna let you just make your own
[13:11] decision about it
[13:12] and then it'll of course it'll be
[13:14] scriptural because I wouldn't preach
[13:15] nothing now he's talking about the
[13:17] scriptural aspect of Noah having to
[13:18] preach the Eternal lost a lot had to
[13:20] preach the Eternal lost Jesus preached
[13:23] Eternal loss we see this idea of
[13:25] Believers preaching to the Eternal lost
[13:28] okay now there is a balance to it I want
[13:30] to get to it maybe in the next part I'll
[13:31] get to you know I think there's a I
[13:33] think there's a better balance because
[13:35] if you if you think about it every real
[13:37] believer at some time is preaching to
[13:39] eternally lost people
[13:41] right didn't Jesus tell the Pharisees
[13:43] your children of the your children of
[13:45] the devil you're two-fold more of the
[13:47] children of the of the devil than your
[13:48] fathers because you you made them twice
[13:51] as as devilish as you are right
[13:54] so and they were and then he said who
[13:56] will warn you to flee from the wrath of
[13:58] God that is to come who will save your
[13:59] soul from the wrath of God like they
[14:00] were already eternally lost
[14:03] so there's a certain balance of this
[14:04] that no matter what age you live in the
[14:07] preachers are going to be preaching to
[14:08] the Eternal lost
[14:09] now not you've got not this church
[14:11] because you're saved I'm talking about
[14:13] people that be like Jesus they call
[14:15] Jesus the devil so whoever would call us
[14:17] Devils sometimes not all the time but
[14:19] sometimes
[14:20] uh would be perhaps the Eternal lost
[14:23] right because Jesus had to deal with
[14:25] that they called him beelzebubble they
[14:26] were the Eternal lost he was the Eternal
[14:28] Son of God I should say Eternal Son of
[14:31] God I should say the Eternal uh
[14:33] Eternal God and flesh
[14:34] Eternal God and flesh so Bob Ram is
[14:36] presuming that's why this sermon is very
[14:38] important when you listen very closely
[14:40] and at the end church you can hear the
[14:41] people they're crying at the altar
[14:43] because they think time might be over
[14:44] and they they're begging God that their
[14:46] children will be saved and their loved
[14:48] ones you can hear them
[14:50] you know preaches as a presumption he
[14:53] said is time over
[14:54] because he was seeing so much happen in
[14:56] his life in his ministry having so many
[14:58] visions
[14:59] he says here's a question but is that
[15:01] hour yet has this arrived to this hour
[15:04] that these things meant that I pray with
[15:06] all that's within me that it isn't now
[15:08] look he's praying I pray that it isn't
[15:10] right and that that that this isn't that
[15:12] hour it's going to be at some point
[15:15] right but has it has it come to that
[15:17] time yet see see that's what I wonder
[15:19] now everybody understands thoroughly
[15:21] that I don't know is this a time if it
[15:24] is God be immersed with us but if it
[15:25] isn't that time then it's going to come
[15:27] so there's going to come a time when no
[15:29] one else is going to be saved that's
[15:30] brother Ram's point he's making here
[15:33] okay now I want you to see here's four
[15:35] times brother I'm talking about this
[15:37] sermon after he preached it so you
[15:39] understand his whole point of preaching
[15:41] this
[15:43] so this is uh what three days later New
[15:46] York he said you can stop the messenger
[15:48] but not the message and the Bible said
[15:50] he ascended into hell and preached the
[15:51] souls that were in prison that were
[15:52] sometimes disobedient and there his last
[15:55] message was to the doomed now I'm gonna
[15:57] stop right there I'm gonna get to this
[15:58] later but Jesus actually did have a
[16:00] Ministry after that right because he
[16:02] come up and ministered for 40 days
[16:05] so that's where you got to balance that
[16:06] Olive Jesus had more Ministry to do
[16:09] right he had to show himself alive
[16:10] remember
[16:11] to
[16:13] to the 11 and the women he had a
[16:15] Ministry
[16:17] so that's why I feel like this is a this
[16:19] is a very scriptural thought like
[16:20] preaching internal loss but I think
[16:22] brother random didn't have enough time
[16:23] to really go into it because Jesus had a
[16:25] fourth part of his ministry
[16:27] he came back right he came back to Earth
[16:30] for 40 days
[16:32] so just something to consider because
[16:35] that wasn't his last message you know he
[16:36] was still preaching after that he was
[16:38] preaching to the
[16:39] the people that saw him after he
[16:40] resurrected now here's why he taught it
[16:43] though it'd be awful to think now that
[16:45] some of these days that people would be
[16:46] going on preaching just like they did in
[16:48] the days of Noah they'd be going on just
[16:50] the same but to a doomed world that's
[16:51] already the doors is closed
[16:55] okay we don't know what time that might
[16:56] happen so if you're not a Christian
[16:57] tonight think real hard give it a
[16:59] serious thought in other words brother
[17:01] Adam just wanted people to be saved
[17:02] before the door closed
[17:04] that's why he preached his sermon
[17:06] he wanted people to get saved before you
[17:08] couldn't get saved right in other words
[17:10] before they crossed the line of mercy
[17:11] and judgment
[17:13] here he says it again in Shreveport a
[17:15] couple weeks after this and the last
[17:17] name that goes on the book or the last
[17:18] name that's redeemed that was put on the
[17:20] book that settles it he clo I'm sorry he
[17:23] comes to claim what he redeemed and it
[17:24] might be a strange time did you ever
[17:26] think people go right on preaching the
[17:28] church will go right on even thinking
[17:29] they're getting people saved it's too
[17:31] late then it's all over see and the
[17:33] message will go to the totally lost just
[17:35] like it did in the days in Noah seven
[17:37] days in the ark okay then you're good he
[17:39] ties inside him there I missed that
[17:40] there I should have highlighted that but
[17:41] that's a good thought
[17:44] okay so let's be warned he said just
[17:46] don't stand around let's do something
[17:47] about it if we're not if we're not right
[17:49] with god let's get right with God
[17:51] now here I think he says it most plainly
[17:52] I love this this is a really good quote
[17:54] even a month later
[17:56] oh God our father today there's Hungry
[17:58] Heart still left on Earth why little
[18:00] Bethlehem in my poor unlearned way Lord
[18:03] I've tried to let this little group
[18:04] which loves me I know they do Lord and I
[18:06] love them and I want them so much till I
[18:09] love them so much till Lord I'm zealous
[18:11] of them so his brother I was zealous for
[18:12] people to be saved I don't want to see
[18:15] them mixed up in these great things and
[18:16] get cut off then when it's too late and
[18:19] see them poor souljandra in prison and
[18:21] know at once had the opportunity
[18:24] so I love this because brother Rama is
[18:26] zealous for people he doesn't want to
[18:27] see them in the readings of the Lost he
[18:29] wants to see them in heaven
[18:31] okay all right and then he talks about
[18:33] he just mentions this and who is this
[18:34] Melchizedek that's the reason Jesus went
[18:36] to hell when he died and preached to the
[18:38] souls that were in prison turned back
[18:40] into that theophany he's just talking
[18:41] about Jesus changing you know from
[18:42] theophany to flesh back to theophany
[18:45] um okay now after brother man reads his
[18:48] text he teaches on the soul it's a
[18:49] beautiful teaching the soul is not the
[18:51] body man it's the soul see and the soul
[18:53] is is the nature of the human spirit and
[18:55] he goes off on this I taught on that a
[18:57] number of years ago about the soul he
[18:59] says man is in God's image man has a
[19:01] dual nature a body and a spirit so flesh
[19:04] and spirit God's nature must come in you
[19:06] though by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:07] and each Must Die to his own human
[19:09] nature that's in the soul right and of
[19:11] course in the mind we've got to Die
[19:12] daily to our sinful desires praise God
[19:15] now I put this up there for uh Kyle but
[19:18] Kyle I I changed the sermon before so we
[19:21] had a visitor this morning brother bang
[19:22] and I don't want to preach on this
[19:24] because it might just go over his head
[19:25] too much you know I don't want to drown
[19:27] him in
[19:28] brother man who I want to hear Jesus
[19:32] Jesus Jesus that's why I thank you for
[19:33] letting me preach Romans 4 this morning
[19:34] you know I didn't want to drown out our
[19:37] visitor with quotes about brother Ram
[19:39] because he just doesn't know who he is
[19:42] now here's a second observation brother
[19:43] Brown says any Jew outside of Israel's
[19:45] backslid now I'm not sure about that
[19:47] that's why I want to bring this up you
[19:48] know it just says I listen to these
[19:49] sermons I find so much good but then I
[19:51] find things I wonder about you know or
[19:53] things uh brother man may have corrected
[19:55] later like right now I think I'm at 87
[19:57] on 87 things brother man either changed
[19:59] or just got wrong you know like he would
[20:01] just cite the wrong scripture you know
[20:03] just to show he's human
[20:05] and just these people you know on
[20:07] YouTube They just they think I don't
[20:08] believe in brother Brandon as a prophet
[20:09] and I preach Brothers a prophet every
[20:11] sermon
[20:13] and I'm like you guys just don't and so
[20:15] some people they just hear whatever they
[20:17] want to hear
[20:18] like you can't you can't change what
[20:20] people are going to decide all you can
[20:22] do is tell the truth and then let the
[20:24] spirit on them and guide them whether
[20:25] it's a holy spirit or Unholy spirit
[20:28] I just you can't worry about it you just
[20:29] got to tell the truth and keep telling
[20:31] the truth the whole time just keep
[20:32] telling the truth
[20:34] but the reason I bring all those out is
[20:36] to show how insane the Jeffersonville
[20:38] people are that's why I bring it out
[20:40] but people just can't I don't know that
[20:42] you can't see it
[20:44] I think I believe that brother man was
[20:46] more of a prophet than they believe that
[20:47] they even worship brother brand but I
[20:48] think I believe brother Ram the right
[20:49] way I think they're wrong I'm I think
[20:51] I'm the actually one who believes in
[20:52] brother Brown the right way of course we
[20:54] are
[20:55] but it's so sad so brother says any Jew
[20:58] that leaves their promised land is
[20:59] backslid because God gave that to them
[21:02] and promised them to stay there see and
[21:04] they left it so he went down into career
[21:06] but it hadn't been for that
[21:08] end quote now
[21:10] I guess you know Daniel
[21:12] was he forced to leave he was forced to
[21:14] leave the promised land and Esther was
[21:16] probably born
[21:17] in needs of Persia in Persia and
[21:21] Mordecai I don't know he might have been
[21:22] born and probably saying we don't know
[21:24] but I don't know were they backslidden
[21:25] or you know so does brother Adam mean
[21:27] anyone who's outside the prophesied in
[21:29] his back son or just the people that
[21:31] purposely leave the promised land I
[21:33] don't know
[21:34] we know Abraham left the promised land
[21:36] and he was backslid that's where he made
[21:37] the lie to the king of Egypt right
[21:39] so it's just interesting you know uh and
[21:42] then when God manifest himself so
[21:43] powerfully to Daniel if he was backslid
[21:46] you know Daniel seemed like a tremendous
[21:49] man of God right very faithful man of
[21:51] God
[21:51] again God's seen the god seemed to
[21:54] vindicate that he was not backslid so
[21:55] just some observations here just some
[21:57] things to think about
[21:59] um
[22:01] uh brother Rams talks about you know the
[22:02] truth sometimes is like a Razor's Edge
[22:04] like here's the truth but then you know
[22:06] something could be off just so so close
[22:08] it's so close to the truth but it's not
[22:09] the truth
[22:10] that's how this is well
[22:13] when they just leave on their own or
[22:16] they're forced to leave or if they're
[22:17] just out of the promised land are they
[22:19] backslid you know it's it's just it's
[22:21] just a good question to have it's a good
[22:22] question
[22:24] um
[22:24] now here's where brother Adam says
[22:26] Daniel wasn't backslid this is in 57. he
[22:29] says now he said when you go go like
[22:30] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and Daniel
[22:32] they purpose in their heart that they
[22:34] would not defile themselves no matter
[22:36] what color went no matter whether the
[22:37] rest of the church back said what
[22:39] happened they purposed in their heart
[22:41] there we can see those four were not
[22:43] backslid according brother Branham
[22:45] so I just thought each other now the
[22:47] third thing third observation did God
[22:49] tell Abraham to marry Hagar
[22:53] I don't think so and brother Ram says he
[22:56] makes it sound like God told Abraham to
[22:58] marry Hagar I don't think he did I think
[23:00] what brother man meant to say was by
[23:01] foreknowledge God knew he would
[23:04] okay so here's where he says it see it's
[23:06] hard to understand that see but if it
[23:07] wasn't that we wouldn't know what Grace
[23:09] was why did he go and marry Hagar after
[23:11] having a lovely wife like Sarah and he
[23:13] didn't want to see but Sarah told him
[23:15] and then God told him you listen to what
[23:17] Sarah told you
[23:19] see those are things I catch
[23:21] right because church we should have a
[23:23] buzzer right we should have a
[23:24] discernment buzzer and it should go off
[23:26] every time
[23:27] right I don't think God ever told
[23:29] Abraham to marry Hagar
[23:32] so see this is where brother he's just
[23:33] human right he's just doing his best
[23:36] because here's what the Bible said
[23:37] there's no mention of God telling
[23:40] Abraham to marry Hagar
[23:42] Sarah said to Abram the Lord hath
[23:45] restrained me I pray they go into my
[23:47] maid
[23:48] and Abraham Harkin to the voice of Sarah
[23:50] now there's nothing in here where God
[23:51] says oh yeah you go ahead and listen to
[23:52] her
[23:55] see so that's where the Bible says now
[23:57] here that's where the Bible says search
[23:59] the scriptures right Jesus said search
[24:00] the scriptures for in them you think you
[24:02] have eternal life
[24:04] and what did what did the Bible call the
[24:06] bereans the Bible call them more noble
[24:08] than those in thessalonica why because
[24:11] they searched the Scriptures Daily
[24:12] whether these things were so
[24:14] so Church it makes us more spiritual
[24:16] brother Bang
[24:17] it makes us more like Christ when we
[24:19] take everything brother Ram said back to
[24:21] the word of God my wife reminded me of
[24:23] that so thank you this week this week
[24:24] she reminded me of that yeah thank you
[24:26] thank you so humble huh yeah
[24:29] but really Church no all joking aside
[24:32] we're more spiritual when we take
[24:34] everything back to the word to make sure
[24:36] that's the truth because we don't want
[24:37] to be deceived and I'll say like this we
[24:39] can't be deceived amen praise God we
[24:41] might make a mistake here and there but
[24:43] we're not going to be deceived by the
[24:44] devil
[24:45] right
[24:47] the Bible said they can't you can't be
[24:48] deceived
[24:50] now here's yeah it seems God only told
[24:53] Abraham to cast out the Bond woman God
[24:56] never told Abraham not I'm sorry God
[24:58] never told Abraham to marry Hagar that
[25:01] was all Sarah
[25:03] and that must have been Abraham's lust
[25:04] or Abraham's human desire I don't know
[25:07] okay so uh Sarah said to Abraham cast
[25:11] out this Bond woman and her son because
[25:13] remember Ishmael was making fun of Isaac
[25:15] oh you little baby now you're weaned and
[25:17] you're just a little baby making fun of
[25:18] the promised child
[25:20] right the promised son and it was very
[25:23] Grievous in Abraham's sight and so God
[25:25] said to Abraham
[25:27] uh hearken
[25:29] yeah and all that Sarah said unto you
[25:30] hearken unto her voice
[25:33] now here's an interesting thought I
[25:34] shared with Jose so let's get some more
[25:35] uh more discernment going on here
[25:39] can uh in the church age book brother
[25:41] Adam says the elect cannot persecute the
[25:44] elect but how far do you take that
[25:47] because Paul was elect and he allowed
[25:50] the persecution of Stephen
[25:52] how about King Saul was elect but he
[25:55] chased around David for years
[25:58] okay so you got that thought there's
[26:00] something else that you want
[26:02] right and here we now we know by this
[26:07] um we know by this the prom sorry the
[26:09] elect won't so how can I say it Ishmael
[26:12] was not the elect as far as the chosen
[26:15] one of God Isaac was
[26:18] right so Isaac didn't persecute Ishmael
[26:20] Ishmael the the the son by the flesh
[26:23] persecuted the son of the promise
[26:26] okay I don't know if Ishmael was saved
[26:28] or not I don't know it doesn't look like
[26:29] it but
[26:30] um I mean could be
[26:32] I don't know
[26:33] so I don't even know if you can use
[26:35] Ishmael and Isaac as a type of the wise
[26:36] and foolish virgin or not I don't even
[26:38] know that because I don't even know if
[26:39] Ishmael was saved I'd have to do read
[26:41] some more on his history but
[26:43] I don't think so
[26:44] so to something else to consider there
[26:46] by God's grace see just I pick up on
[26:48] these things as you as I listen
[26:50] now here despite brother I'm being wrong
[26:52] about that statement that God told
[26:54] Abraham to marry Hagar
[26:57] we understand the point brother Brown
[26:59] was trying to make he was trying to make
[27:01] the point that Ishmael and Isaac were a
[27:05] were a uh allegory right I think we used
[27:07] it a couple of weeks ago at the Sunday
[27:09] School the Sunday night Sunday school it
[27:11] was types and allegories yeah types of
[27:14] allegories a type is a foretelling of
[27:16] one a specific event and allegories just
[27:19] where two things represent some or
[27:21] something represents something
[27:22] so this was the allegory the Bible said
[27:24] Abraham had two sons one by the bond
[27:27] maid other by the free woman but he was
[27:29] of the Bond woman Ishmael was born after
[27:31] the flesh but here the free one was born
[27:34] by promise Isaac which things are an
[27:36] allegory
[27:38] for these are the two covenants the one
[27:39] which is from Mount Sinai which generate
[27:42] the bondage which is agar so we know
[27:44] that under we understand that now so
[27:45] Ishmael is the type of the law and Isaac
[27:48] is the type of the New Testament Grace
[27:50] okay
[27:51] so that's the point Brothers trying to
[27:53] make he just made a simple human mistake
[27:55] church I get stories mixed up in the
[27:57] Bible all the time and the church said
[27:59] okay see so you know I'm human right so
[28:01] we know brother I'm human we know all
[28:02] men are human right anyone outside of
[28:04] Jesus is going to make mistakes Christ
[28:06] never made a mistake never will but
[28:08] humans will make mistakes
[28:09] okay now after this program gets right
[28:12] into this story leading up to the
[28:14] JCPenney story
[28:16] he tells his short life story where he
[28:19] was born and everything until he was
[28:20] accidentally shot I think it was Jim
[28:22] Poole at 14 years old and he almost lost
[28:25] both of his legs because all the the
[28:27] bullets that was parts of the bulls that
[28:30] were in his legs he almost lost his legs
[28:33] so he's he just got shot he's in the
[28:36] hospital he tried to go to sleep
[28:37] he said I woke up something splashed and
[28:40] here was his own blood half a gal and he
[28:42] was laying in his own blood
[28:44] the the shot from the bullet was so
[28:47] close to the artery on either side just
[28:49] a little scratch would have cut it right
[28:50] in two he'd start bleeding well I
[28:53] thought this is the end of me I put my
[28:55] hands down like this and raise it up and
[28:56] the blood was running down my hands it
[28:58] was my own blood I was laying in now
[29:00] what a place to be and he's not even
[29:01] saved yet
[29:02] what a place to be in
[29:04] 14. now this gives it a little thought
[29:05] too God gives him a vision about going
[29:08] to hell could a 14 year old go to hell I
[29:10] don't know
[29:12] now the wrong uh the the Mormon Church
[29:14] our friend Mr Hasam I think they they
[29:18] say they have thus saved the Lord I
[29:19] think eight or seven is the age of
[29:21] accountability can you imagine that
[29:23] like if someone doesn't accept Christ by
[29:25] seven or eight they go to hell if they
[29:27] die that's really that's it's really
[29:29] strict
[29:30] no one knows the the the time though the
[29:32] age of accountability but here's brother
[29:34] random at 14 years old not even saved
[29:36] laying in his own blood
[29:39] we didn't he's uh here's this is another
[29:41] reason why this sermon is important
[29:43] brother Branham says the KKK which were
[29:46] awful Wicked people
[29:47] and the Masons which
[29:50] reject Jesus Christ as God
[29:52] they paid for his hospital bill and he
[29:55] says I can never forget them
[29:57] this is where people will take this and
[29:58] they'll say see brother random like the
[30:00] KKK that's not true
[30:02] he just recognized that they paid for
[30:04] his bill
[30:05] right so this sermon has a lot of good
[30:07] in it but then it's got a lot of human
[30:08] stories in it too
[30:11] he said they paid hundreds of dollars
[30:14] he said I can never forget them no
[30:15] matter what they do there's something
[30:17] and that stays with me see what they did
[30:19] for me so whenever somebody shows you
[30:21] kindness it stays with you that's the
[30:23] point he's trying to make not trying to
[30:25] support the Masons or the KKK
[30:27] we would never support any of those
[30:28] demonic institutions right never we
[30:31] never sport in those but he just
[30:33] recognizes they did something nice for
[30:35] me
[30:36] the no
[30:38] he's okay so he's in this surgery
[30:40] uh and he has a vision the first vision
[30:43] is the one where he's falling like he's
[30:45] going to hell
[30:47] and then he has a surgery I think a
[30:49] month later he says and then he has a
[30:51] second Vision so we'll go through this
[30:52] first Vision I think
[30:54] uh here so he has two visions one's
[30:56] about hell and the other one's about
[30:58] receiving Glory out in the west which is
[31:00] the type of the Seven Seals it's a
[31:02] beautiful picture
[31:03] so in the first Vision he was in a
[31:05] trance I thought I was just in hell now
[31:06] here's how he describes it oh no I'm
[31:09] sorry seven months later after the first
[31:10] surgery he had the second operation and
[31:13] then here's this here's his second
[31:15] mission the first Vision was about hell
[31:16] the second vision is about going out
[31:18] west he said I had another Vision there
[31:20] was a great Golden Cross in the sky and
[31:22] the glory of the Lord flowing out of
[31:24] that cross and I stood with my hands out
[31:26] like this and the glory was falling into
[31:28] my chest I like that Hallelujah the
[31:32] vision left me my father was sitting
[31:33] there looking at me when the vision came
[31:35] okay so that's the second mission you
[31:37] had after the second surgery to take out
[31:39] the shot out of his legs because he
[31:41] almost lost his legs he almost had to uh
[31:43] he said they almost had to amputate both
[31:44] of his legs and he said if you do that
[31:45] just amputate me right here he said
[31:47] which is a a joke for just just kill me
[31:50] right because I don't want to have a
[31:51] life without legs he said but now God's
[31:53] healed me so thoroughly he said I have
[31:55] such great strong legs by the grace of
[31:56] Christ
[31:57] amen
[31:59] so this is a
[32:02] yeah so this Vision I believe this
[32:04] Vision I believe brother Branham
[32:05] received a uh here when he was a 14 year
[32:08] old boy was a foretelling of him
[32:10] receiving the revelation of the Seven
[32:12] Seals because brother Adam says the Old
[32:15] Testament writer Moses had to be drove
[32:17] from his People Into the Wilderness to
[32:19] get the inspiration right the Old
[32:20] Testament and in the New Testament the
[32:22] writer Paul Paul wrote the majority of
[32:24] the books was drove by the author into
[32:26] the desert place to get the inspiration
[32:28] to write the New Testament and the books
[32:30] are sealed with Seven Seals it would
[32:32] also require the same I believe in these
[32:34] days to open those Seven Seals amen did
[32:37] you catch that so brother Adam says I'm
[32:39] just like Moses and Paul I'm a prophet I
[32:43] had to be driven out to the wet out west
[32:45] of the Wilderness to get the inspiration
[32:47] of the Seven Seals amen that's why
[32:50] people say you know God gave the
[32:51] Revelation to the Old Testament to Moses
[32:54] Revelation New Testament to uh Paul and
[32:57] then uh the Revelation brother random to
[32:59] tie it all together with the Revel with
[33:01] the Finnish Mysteries that's why people
[33:03] say that because brother man makes this
[33:05] statement he received the glory and it's
[33:08] likely the spirit's inspiration to
[33:10] preach the Seven Seals
[33:13] because remember Jesus is the only one
[33:14] who can lose the Seven Seals but the
[33:16] Lamb made it known to the seventh angel
[33:20] yes I told you I'm going to get into
[33:20] some message terminology here tonight
[33:23] right so we're seeing that you know
[33:25] dreams and visions and experiences maybe
[33:27] not found in the Bible
[33:28] if he was a genuine Prophet we got to
[33:30] take him back to the word and they got
[33:31] to match up with the word
[33:33] all right
[33:36] sorry because it's cold tonight here
[33:39] so but the first Vision was
[33:41] uh the region of the lost where brother
[33:44] man said he felt like he was falling so
[33:45] now he says the purpose of this message
[33:47] the souls are in prison now is to pose
[33:50] the church in everything he'll let me
[33:51] post to the church as far as I know as I
[33:54] go along
[33:56] so you want to just share this Vision
[33:58] with them or this experience he had out
[34:00] in JCPenney in October 63. he want to
[34:03] share it with the people how it
[34:04] connected to his previous Vision when he
[34:05] was 14.
[34:07] and after the vision struck me I was so
[34:09] weak I lost all the blood
[34:11] he said I thought I was sinking into an
[34:13] endless eternity so here he has a vision
[34:15] of Falling In Hell many of you has heard
[34:17] me tell this before I was sinking to the
[34:19] endless eternity
[34:21] and I was going through like clouds and
[34:22] then through darkness and sinking down
[34:24] down now this reminds us of the
[34:26] bottomless pit in Revelation chapter 19
[34:28] I think it is
[34:30] or is it 20. where Satan's cast into the
[34:33] bottom of spit I think it's maybe 20.
[34:35] let me just get the right verse in the
[34:36] kid yes 20.
[34:39] yeah verse 3 20 verse 3 children just
[34:41] you know that's when Satan's cast in the
[34:43] bottomless pit
[34:46] okay he says uh and the first thing you
[34:48] know I got into the reasons of the loss
[34:49] and there I screamed and I looked and
[34:51] there just about everything there was no
[34:53] Foundation to it I could never stop
[34:54] falling for eternity looked like I was
[34:56] going to fall there was no stop in
[34:58] nowhere and then what a difference it
[35:00] was from the vision I had not long ago
[35:01] of being in glory with the people the
[35:03] contrast
[35:04] in this I was falling I finally screamed
[35:07] for my dad of course being just a kid
[35:08] that's what I would do I scream for my
[35:10] daddy my daddy wasn't there
[35:11] and I screamed for my mother somebody
[35:13] catched me but there was no mother there
[35:14] I was just going and I screamed then to
[35:17] God there was no God there there was
[35:18] nothing there
[35:21] now that's interesting because David
[35:22] said God would be in hell if he made his
[35:24] bed in hell
[35:26] but that might mean something different
[35:27] right
[35:29] so I think brother Adam's experience was
[35:31] different than what David was writing
[35:33] about
[35:34] if David met his made his bed in hell
[35:36] God would be there I'm not sure
[35:38] I'm not sure what that means
[35:40] okay so I I don't know but there was no
[35:43] God there now church we know this though
[35:45] God is Everywhere by foreknowledge
[35:47] right but in this case program said he
[35:50] felt like there was no God there so
[35:53] I don't know maybe maybe just God
[35:55] doesn't allow his presence to be felt in
[35:57] the regions of the lost but by
[35:59] foreknowledge God knows everything
[36:00] that's going on there
[36:01] right if he doesn't he's not God but he
[36:03] has to know
[36:04] so again just some interesting
[36:05] statements and we've got to try to
[36:07] understand them by the best best we can
[36:11] and then brother random felt like that
[36:14] hellish Dimension that same Dimension he
[36:16] felt the regions of the Lost he felt
[36:17] like it was also come up to JCPenney
[36:21] okay
[36:23] and this was in Tucson Arizona in a
[36:25] JCPenney store in October of 63. so let
[36:29] me I'll just kind of shorten this a
[36:30] little bit so I went upstairs and I sat
[36:32] down and when I did there was an
[36:34] escalator it was in a JCPenney store and
[36:36] the escalator bringing the people up
[36:37] well I really turned sick at my stomach
[36:39] seen those women come up there
[36:41] young old and different wrinkled young
[36:43] everywhere those little bitty little
[36:45] bitty shorts on I think about the little
[36:46] bitty shorts they have on today I mean
[36:48] my goodness it's it's ten times worse
[36:51] today if not more
[36:53] like we were just at Chipotle with Lena
[36:55] and it don't look like they have clothes
[36:57] on it's like they're spray painting
[36:59] clothes on that's that's how tight their
[37:00] clothes are
[37:03] he says their filthy body and those sexy
[37:05] dressed women with those great big heads
[37:07] like that now she talked about the big
[37:09] hairdos they used to have like the
[37:10] Jackie Kennedy Heritage really big none
[37:13] of our sisters use those hairstyles
[37:15] thank goodness
[37:17] and one coming right off that escalator
[37:19] just coming right up like that where I
[37:21] was sitting back in a chair sitting
[37:22] there with my head down and I turned and
[37:24] look and one of them coming up the steps
[37:26] saying ooh Spanish speaking to another
[37:28] woman she was a white woman speaking to
[37:31] Spanish women and when I looked brother
[37:32] snaps his finger all at once I was
[37:34] changed there I had seen that before
[37:39] so brother man goes through some change
[37:40] I don't know if like the dimensions
[37:41] Blended
[37:42] I don't know if he went to another
[37:44] Vision like a vision popped up he's
[37:46] saying these women come up the escalator
[37:47] and they look like women that are
[37:49] actually in the readings of the Lost he
[37:51] says because they got the colors they
[37:53] got green and their faces blue on their
[37:55] faces all the crazy makeup he said
[37:57] that's what a cankered person looks like
[37:59] in the readings of the Lost
[38:03] he said her eyes you know how the women
[38:06] are doing now painting their eyes just
[38:07] like like cat you know put it up like
[38:09] this and wearing cat glasses and
[38:10] everything you know with eyes up like
[38:12] this and the green stuff under their
[38:13] eyes there was that thing that I seen
[38:16] when I was a child there was the woman
[38:18] just exactly and I just got numb all
[38:20] over began to look around and there was
[38:21] those people mumbling you know going on
[38:24] about the prices and things in the
[38:25] building
[38:29] and I said honey he says I'm almost as a
[38:32] dead man and she said what's the matter
[38:34] are you sick I said no something's just
[38:35] happened now she don't know so brother
[38:37] Adam didn't even tell the vision to his
[38:38] wife
[38:40] because he wanted to tell the church all
[38:42] of his Visions first
[38:43] that he said that's a promise he made to
[38:45] the church
[38:47] he said she don't know she's waiting for
[38:49] this tape to return I've never said to
[38:51] nobody and I thought I'd wait as I
[38:52] promised bring it to the church Mercy
[38:54] bring it to the church that was my
[38:55] promise and you'll realize after tonight
[38:57] the reason I try to keep my promise
[39:01] he and then them canker looking eyes so
[39:03] the woman with the blue and the green
[39:04] around their eyes and the eyes of the
[39:06] paint they run back like cat's eyes and
[39:08] them talking there I was again standing
[39:11] there in JCPenney store back in hell
[39:13] again
[39:15] so friends I don't know exactly what
[39:17] happened I don't know if you know that
[39:18] God let that Dimension come up for a
[39:20] little bit or God brought just a vision
[39:22] down from heaven and
[39:24] you know brother random saw their
[39:25] conditions like these are one of some of
[39:26] the ones that are eternally lost I don't
[39:28] know exactly what happened
[39:30] he said I got so scared I thought Lord
[39:32] surely I haven't died and you've not and
[39:34] you've let me come to this place after
[39:35] all
[39:36] so the women's faces and the way they
[39:38] were dressed reminded him of the canker
[39:40] condition of what he saw people look
[39:42] like in the regions of the Lost
[39:44] that's quite a quite a thought
[39:48] okay and now this would be my final
[39:50] thought right now I'm going to preach a
[39:52] little bit longer I don't know how I
[39:53] actually didn't set my timer
[39:57] I wanted to preach on the third poll
[39:58] because brother Ram connects this Vision
[40:00] to the third pole
[40:03] and that's why I've said over the years
[40:04] Church well I haven't mentioned it too
[40:05] much over the years I guess recently I
[40:07] guess I appreciated earlier in my
[40:08] Ministry but
[40:09] there's numerous access aspects to the
[40:11] third poll
[40:13] so let me give you three
[40:15] one aspect of the third poll is speaking
[40:17] the word and doing Miracles or
[40:19] Supernatural That's one of them we'll
[40:20] get to that today a second one is the
[40:22] opening of The Seven Seals
[40:25] right
[40:26] program got the sword of the king and he
[40:28] said now you're going to open the Seven
[40:29] Seals for God
[40:31] the third one is this the preaching to
[40:33] the Eternal lost
[40:35] I guess I can throw a fourth in there
[40:36] latter rain later rain is a fourth thing
[40:38] connected to the third pole so there's
[40:40] four Ministries all connected to the
[40:42] third poll and remember the third poll
[40:44] is brother around his final Ministry and
[40:46] then he says he says I don't say the
[40:48] Lord's telling me this but
[40:50] um the third pole will operate greatly
[40:51] at the time of the Rapture the latter
[40:53] rain
[40:55] but he said the Lord didn't tell me that
[40:57] he said I just feel like it is
[40:59] so see people banking on that they can
[41:01] go too far and what if it don't happen
[41:03] they'll be disappointed well does that
[41:05] mean they'll be in the Rapture or not I
[41:06] don't know
[41:07] I don't know so what are you trusting
[41:09] are trusting in Supernatural are you
[41:10] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ
[41:12] what are we trusting in
[41:15] the only absolute thing we have is the
[41:17] scriptures about the latter rain that's
[41:18] only it because that's what the Bible
[41:19] says the latter rain
[41:21] right
[41:23] so you know it just takes a lot of a lot
[41:25] of patience it takes a lot of long
[41:26] suffering a lot of wisdom
[41:29] um a lot of Grace you gotta we gotta be
[41:31] great gracious
[41:33] so now brother Ram connects this Vision
[41:34] about JCPenney store and uh his vision
[41:38] as a 14 year old kind of come in
[41:39] together all come together he connects
[41:41] us to the third pole
[41:43] he says his wife come up and he said
[41:45] just let me alone a minute honey if you
[41:47] don't mind I just want to go home are
[41:48] you sick no just go ahead if you got any
[41:50] shopping news she said no I'm finished
[41:51] let me he said let me take you by the
[41:53] arm see I walked out she said what's the
[41:55] matter she said Mita something happened
[41:56] up there he felt like he was in hell
[41:58] again now Church let's be honest and
[42:01] some of these rides we'd have over the
[42:02] last few years right and some of these
[42:04] gatherings of gay and lesbian and trans
[42:06] it looks like hell
[42:08] it looks like hell they hate God it
[42:11] looks like hell on Earth
[42:13] right and that's exactly what brother
[42:14] man was seeing now think if he could be
[42:16] in our day think what would he say today
[42:19] oh my goodness
[42:21] what would he say today
[42:25] and then he says while I was under that
[42:27] I thought this so he's under that shock
[42:30] and Something's Happened to me he's
[42:32] under that uh that vision
[42:34] and he says what day are we living in
[42:37] could this be the third poll
[42:40] now I've got some notes down here now
[42:41] next time I preach on this I'll pick up
[42:44] where his notes his notes are start with
[42:46] Jesus preaching the Eternal loss and
[42:48] then he goes through all those
[42:48] scriptures about
[42:50] that we read in the text about angels
[42:52] being lost and Angels chained up and
[42:55] souls that are in prison now and all
[42:56] that we'll go through all that next time
[42:58] Lord willing but I want to finish this
[42:59] sermon with the third pull thoughts okay
[43:02] by God's grace it'd be good Refresher
[43:04] anybody even remember last time I
[43:06] preached on the third poll do you
[43:07] remember brother Bank do you remember
[43:09] darling okay so nobody remembers all
[43:11] right neither do I son
[43:13] okay so I want to leave Souls that are
[43:15] in prison now and I want to finish with
[43:16] this just an overview of the third poll
[43:18] especially okay Lena stepped out but she
[43:20] and uh Austin can listen to this later
[43:22] if they like just a base let me give you
[43:24] just a timeline of the overview okay
[43:28] so brother man pastored I think from
[43:30] 1933 to 1947 or 46 some people say 46.
[43:35] to me it doesn't matter the point was he
[43:37] pastored right
[43:39] actually might be 46. I have to look it
[43:41] up but
[43:42] whatever year Billy Graham became famous
[43:44] and Oral Roberts brother Branham started
[43:46] that either that earlier that same year
[43:47] or the year before because everybody can
[43:49] prove that by the newspaper articles and
[43:51] everything like that so it's either 46
[43:53] or 47.
[43:55] but brother Adam said his first poll
[43:58] was the sign in his hand so brother man
[44:00] would take somebody's uh hand in his
[44:02] hand and then he'd look at his hand and
[44:05] it would have dots on it
[44:07] from what the brothers say and once he
[44:09] memorized the dots he know what Spirit
[44:11] they had or what disease or infirmity
[44:13] they had
[44:14] okay that was the first poll and that
[44:17] was and the first the first two uh polls
[44:20] were his first two signs that God gave
[44:22] him just like Mo God gave Moses two
[44:23] signs
[44:25] right the sign in his hand and then the
[44:26] sign of the staff
[44:29] now two years later the second poll
[44:32] manifested brother Adam said in in
[44:34] Regina Saskatchewan
[44:36] LeBron said a man came up and then he
[44:38] just knew all the thoughts and he saw
[44:40] the vision he and he told him the
[44:41] thoughts intents of his heart that was
[44:43] the second poll
[44:45] this is a that's a powerful testimony I
[44:47] mean you can just turn on brother
[44:48] Brandon I mean it's powerful like I told
[44:50] you I was listening to communion 1957 I
[44:53] think I was listening to that because
[44:54] Zur had asked me a good question about
[44:55] that a few weeks ago
[44:57] and brothers says how many got prayer
[44:58] cards he said okay we're not doing
[45:00] prayer cards I'm just gonna start and he
[45:01] called nine people out he told nine
[45:03] people their their names their addresses
[45:05] and where they live and their their
[45:07] sicknesses who can do that nobody can do
[45:10] that and the people are crying and you
[45:12] hear the you hear the faith of the
[45:13] people rise
[45:15] again you can hear Faith rise I want to
[45:17] get that on recording I want to send
[45:18] that to the The Junction City Saints
[45:21] because they don't they don't quite know
[45:22] what it feels like to have like Faith
[45:23] rise and everybody's singing everybody's
[45:25] shouting everybody's praising all those
[45:27] are great moments amen that's that's God
[45:29] pouring out his spear on the whole
[45:31] church
[45:32] all right every now and then you know
[45:33] one person will get it two people get it
[45:35] but it's awesome when everybody's under
[45:36] that anointing praise God Amen and
[45:39] that's what that and I met people like I
[45:41] met one or two people on tape that have
[45:43] had brother random discern them
[45:45] right now they've passed away
[45:47] but
[45:49] so the first poll 47 second pole 1949
[45:53] now in night it wasn't until 1956 that
[45:56] brother Adam even calls them polls at
[45:58] first he just called them signs and then
[46:00] he has visions and the angel shows them
[46:02] these are actually polls or phases of
[46:04] your ministry polling in the Saints
[46:06] pulling in the fish right Fishers and
[46:08] men pulling them in
[46:11] so brother I didn't even say the word
[46:12] third pole until 1956 after his first
[46:15] two polls have already started
[46:17] okay so he didn't get the terminology
[46:19] until 56. it's actually January 1st 1956
[46:22] where he says that
[46:24] okay so fast four I can't really draw
[46:26] hands I don't know why
[46:28] he says fast forward to uh 63.
[46:31] brother random preached Christ in the
[46:33] mystery of God revealed and he ends the
[46:35] sermon by saying look it's two o'clock
[46:37] now look he must have preached that must
[46:38] have been like a four-hour sermon now
[46:40] see I've never preached four hours to
[46:42] you all right
[46:45] he says look it's two o'clock the end of
[46:48] the second poll he says the third poll
[46:50] is on its way
[46:53] and then on August 25th he preaches
[46:56] perfect faith
[46:57] and he has that long prayer line I don't
[46:59] remember I preached on that years ago
[47:01] brother man it takes an hour to pray for
[47:03] almost every person they come to the
[47:05] prayer line
[47:06] and then he says now how many of you
[47:08] already feel an instant change in your
[47:10] body said look at those hands he's like
[47:12] over 90 percent of the people had almost
[47:14] instantaneous and he says what is this
[47:16] this is getting us ready for the third
[47:18] Bowl
[47:20] in other words Faith just by the spoken
[47:22] word of God
[47:23] right God's God's giving in other words
[47:25] God doing Supernatural works by the
[47:27] spoken word he just said he you can hear
[47:30] him he just says he says uh uh you're
[47:32] healed by Jesus Stripes he said I lay my
[47:34] hands on my sister in Jesus Christ's
[47:35] name let my sister be healed and they
[47:37] just go for an hour it's just an hour of
[47:39] they're singing The Great physician and
[47:40] praying
[47:41] and he says this is coming into that
[47:43] third poll
[47:44] so brother man was expecting a time of
[47:46] Great Mighty Miracles before the rapture
[47:49] right he thought that would be like the
[47:51] latter rain right that's what he thought
[47:53] and he for him it was called his third
[47:55] poll of his ministry
[47:57] now brother random died of course before
[47:59] the Rapture right
[48:01] some people say we're in the Millennium
[48:02] now
[48:03] you're wrong about that I don't see any
[48:05] uh wolf lying down with any Lambs right
[48:08] don't see it they just misunderstood
[48:10] quotes
[48:12] and then church four months later on
[48:14] December 29th 63 he says the third poll
[48:18] has now been Vindicated that it's here
[48:21] okay and then he gives five examples
[48:23] some of them were from before 1963.
[48:27] so the third poll had been in operation
[48:29] for a while but now here at the end of
[48:31] 63 now you can recognize wow the third
[48:33] poll has been operating
[48:35] then he gives us five examples of it
[48:38] okay
[48:39] that's a real brief overview there's
[48:42] other Visions in here he has Visions
[48:44] about a baby shoe trying to get the baby
[48:46] shoe through the latch you can't teach
[48:48] Pentecostal babies Supernatural things
[48:51] then he has a dream about fishing and
[48:54] how he his first two polls he made
[48:55] mistakes by trying to explain it I mean
[48:57] there's so much to this topic it's it's
[48:59] an extremely in-depth death topic but
[49:01] then the angel said you made a mistake
[49:03] on those first two but you won't make
[49:04] any mistake on the third pole he said
[49:06] don't say much about it
[49:08] and so brother Brown doesn't say much
[49:09] about it
[49:10] right
[49:12] with the third poll he just says I'll
[49:14] show I'll show the quote later with the
[49:16] third pull he says you have to wait till
[49:17] God leads you to speak the word of God
[49:21] you can't just wake up one day and say
[49:22] you know tastes like a nice day I like
[49:23] to speak squirrelsome to existence or
[49:25] something you know
[49:26] or I'd like to speak uh
[49:28] you know for the farmers I like to speak
[49:30] rain into existence today will that be
[49:31] nice but is that God's will
[49:35] so he said he didn't explain as much
[49:38] about it like he did the first two polls
[49:40] because that the angel got upset and
[49:41] said you caused a lot of fanaticism
[49:44] by trying to explain everything my
[49:46] brother man said I'm sorry I'm a stupid
[49:48] man of course he wasn't he was just
[49:49] being humble you know just being humble
[49:52] but he said don't say much about that
[49:54] third poll
[49:56] okay
[49:57] now here's where he says in 1950 that
[50:00] the first sign started manifesting three
[50:02] years ago
[50:05] okay so 1947 was about or 46 would have
[50:08] been about the time of the first sign
[50:09] the bumps in the hand and the color the
[50:11] colored dots now did you know this I
[50:13] think I have this
[50:15] oh no here's the next one
[50:17] here's where the angel met brother
[50:18] Brandon for either 46 or 47
[50:22] he said the people won't believe me
[50:24] because I'm not educated sufficient to
[50:26] speak to people and the angel said
[50:28] you'll be given two signs as the prophet
[50:30] Moses one sign will be that you'll
[50:32] detect diseases through your hand when
[50:34] the people contact you well you'll be
[50:36] able to tell them what diseases they
[50:37] have through a supernatural discernment
[50:39] and then said if you'll be sincere then
[50:41] it will come to pass it you'll tell the
[50:42] people the secrets of their hearts and
[50:44] the things that they've done in life
[50:45] that might have hindered their healing
[50:46] and so forth
[50:48] right and so these first two signs end
[50:51] up being the first two poles of the
[50:53] three poles or the three phases of his
[50:55] ministry
[50:58] okay now here's where he says this is in
[51:00] Souls that are imprisoned brother random
[51:01] says that the second Paul manifested he
[51:04] said up in uh Regina
[51:06] Saskatchewan before several thousand
[51:09] people there it was he said their second
[51:11] poll just manifested like that
[51:16] okay now now I'm jumping back here I'm
[51:18] jumping back not to 1956. here's the
[51:21] first time he makes mention of the third
[51:22] poll
[51:23] and then he taken me from there and I
[51:25] seen a great huge tent now this is where
[51:27] there's a lot of ideas about the this is
[51:30] called the tent Vision how many ever
[51:32] heard the tent Vision before
[51:33] service
[51:35] brother I'm seeing it this is what he
[51:37] says he's seen a tent
[51:39] it was packed and lined everywhere with
[51:41] people and I walked out looked like I
[51:42] was standing above the people looking
[51:43] down where I just made an altar call
[51:45] hundreds and hundreds of people were
[51:47] weeping and rejoicing after they
[51:48] accepted the Lord Jesus as their savior
[51:52] and I looked and then I heard a man get
[51:54] up and say call the prayer line and
[51:55] people begin to line up over on this
[51:57] side the left from where I was looking
[51:59] down towards the platform and they lined
[52:01] all the way up and down the street for
[52:03] Carolina notice to my left which would
[52:05] have been to my right if I was on the
[52:06] platform a little wooden building
[52:08] and I seen that light and all they that
[52:11] had the picture of you know that that's
[52:13] always in the meetings I seen that light
[52:14] leave me so brother ends up looking down
[52:16] the light leaves him and goes to that
[52:18] building and then the voice says I'll
[52:20] meet you in there that'll be the third
[52:22] poll
[52:24] I said why he said well it won't be a
[52:27] public show like the other and I came to
[52:30] so the first two polls were out in front
[52:32] of the public right he would discern
[52:33] he'd take him by the hand and discern
[52:35] you've got TB or you've got
[52:38] whatever problem you got cancer the
[52:40] second poll I see Visions I tell you the
[52:42] thoughts and intents of your heart
[52:43] Secret
[52:44] he said but the third poll I'll meet you
[52:46] in this little wooden building
[52:50] okay
[52:51] now brother Randy Cyrus years ago when
[52:54] we were at the Waterloo Place preached
[52:55] this quote to me and I was like oh I
[52:57] needed this quote you know because I
[52:58] didn't understand the third poll
[53:01] the angel told Brother Branham what the
[53:03] little wood building was it was a place
[53:06] of Prayer
[53:07] it wasn't a natural building
[53:10] you Saints know that after brother
[53:11] Branham died some of the people that
[53:13] worshiped him
[53:14] they bought a huge great tent expecting
[53:17] brother bam to rise from the dead
[53:19] and they were gonna they had planes
[53:20] ready they were gonna fly brother random
[53:22] around the world because he said I got
[53:23] to ride this Trail again he had he had
[53:24] different dreams and missions and
[53:26] we laugh now but these people were
[53:29] they're just insane they were random
[53:30] worshipers
[53:32] they didn't pray I mean I laughed
[53:34] I have too much
[53:36] avocado people think that like I
[53:39] how could they think that and now
[53:41] they've all died and it shows they
[53:44] misinterpreted the quotes
[53:46] they worship Brothers rather than taking
[53:48] everything he said back to the word and
[53:50] just waiting on God
[53:52] brother random said the angel told him
[53:55] he said I don't know what's going on in
[53:56] that closet like that he said is it not
[53:58] written by our Lord when thou praise be
[53:59] not like the Hypocrites who like to be
[54:01] heard before men but enter into the
[54:03] secret closet and pray to the father or
[54:04] seeth in secret and he who seeth in
[54:06] secret shall reward thee openly
[54:08] it's perfectly to the scripture every
[54:10] time it is
[54:12] it's beautiful I've always told Brother
[54:14] Randy I've seen him a couple years ago I
[54:15] said thank you brother for sharing that
[54:16] quote that just meant so much to me
[54:18] because I didn't know if it brother bang
[54:19] if we got do we have to go build a
[54:21] wooden building from other random to
[54:22] preach in one day you know is he gonna
[54:24] come back is he gonna come back
[54:26] you know
[54:28] because there's another dream brother or
[54:31] a man had a dream of brother Brandon he
[54:32] was on a white horse he looked dressed
[54:33] up like an Indian he said I'll ride this
[54:35] Trail again
[54:36] well we don't really know what that
[54:38] means brother Jose's got an idea he
[54:39] shared it with us a couple years ago
[54:42] I just think that it means brother Ram's
[54:43] gospel his gospel message the Bible
[54:46] revelations have to go around the world
[54:47] again
[54:48] and that because that's what's happened
[54:50] I mean it's been what 50
[54:52] 57 years his brother man passed away 50
[54:54] 58 years
[54:57] yeah come in December it'd be 58 years
[54:58] since brother man passed away well
[55:00] what's happened his message has gone to
[55:02] all the world
[55:04] seems the most logical answer right
[55:05] rather than brother is going to come
[55:07] back oh yeah they even had a white horse
[55:08] waiting for him brother they had a white
[55:10] horse and the white headdress yeah
[55:12] brother Perry green knew people that had
[55:14] he knew he knew the men that had the
[55:16] plane ready the tent the wooden building
[55:19] they thought this was all going to
[55:21] happen natural but brother bear says the
[55:23] angel said it's like a prayer closet
[55:25] it's not a literal it's a literal wooden
[55:27] building
[55:30] and that's why church I think I shared
[55:31] it on Wednesday and Austin said that the
[55:33] the sermon meant a lot to him he said
[55:37] every dream and vision everything that
[55:39] we have we've got to wait on the Lord
[55:41] and take it back to the word see if
[55:43] these people have done that they never
[55:44] would have bought that plane and now
[55:45] that that plane is collecting dust or
[55:47] you know it's it's done like it's it's
[55:49] going to be junk unless somebody pays
[55:51] all these efforts and all that waste and
[55:53] time and money because they didn't take
[55:55] things back to the word of God
[55:57] they just didn't wait on the Lord
[56:00] and some of those people were just tape
[56:01] people they didn't have a pastor
[56:03] they just press play
[56:06] because and that shows they're breaking
[56:07] the word of God Ephesians chapter four
[56:09] with the fivefold ministry Gathering
[56:11] more as you see that day approaching
[56:12] it's people that break the word of God
[56:14] they don't pray enough they don't search
[56:15] the scripture enough we ought to be so
[56:17] thankful that we search the word of God
[56:19] hallelujah amen praise God thank God
[56:21] Amen that's why I love Brothers message
[56:23] because it points me back to the word of
[56:25] God hallelujah and now no man or woman
[56:28] can to see me right because I'll say
[56:30] well that's a good idea that might be a
[56:31] good story but let's take that back to
[56:33] the word of God
[56:34] let's see what God's word says about
[56:36] that even the third Paul even the
[56:38] brothers all this has to go back to the
[56:40] Bible
[56:41] somewhere in the Bible where if someone
[56:42] has three three parts of their Ministry
[56:45] right
[56:46] right so the man said of God Son of
[56:48] David we preached on that last year you
[56:50] know there's just you know there's three
[56:51] there's justification sanctification
[56:53] baptism Holy Ghost you can kind of see
[56:54] how there's phases of ministry
[56:58] and so I got to study more on that but
[57:00] everything we everything God gave
[57:02] brother Brandon there has to be a
[57:04] Biblical principle for it
[57:06] there has to be
[57:08] and there is but it's uh you know uh
[57:12] I'll just say like this you know at the
[57:14] end time every seed has to manifest of
[57:16] its own kind
[57:18] so I Rejoice that our seed is The Good
[57:20] Seed praise God hallelujah we got the
[57:22] good seed the seed of the king
[57:24] Hallelujah
[57:25] real faith in God's word
[57:29] okay uh
[57:31] okay that's the same thing that's that's
[57:32] kind of more of the same quote now I
[57:35] don't know if you knew this but I okay I
[57:37] got the book in there lady can you go in
[57:38] there real quick it's on my desk there's
[57:40] a book in there I gave everybody copy
[57:41] now I want to give this one to Zur if
[57:42] she wants it because she wasn't here
[57:44] when I bought it you get that brown book
[57:46] The Message companion can you see it
[57:48] there
[57:50] doing a good job holding the door open
[57:52] and getting the book
[57:54] so years ago I remember when I gave
[57:55] everybody a copy this
[57:57] sister you can have one and then Lena if
[57:59] you and Austin yeah it was before you
[58:00] guys came if you want I can order one
[58:02] for you in Austin it's a great summary
[58:04] of brother Adam's Ministry from the last
[58:06] six years of his of his ministry it's
[58:07] beautiful
[58:09] uh they got a DVD in there if you like
[58:11] uh
[58:12] some videos on there
[58:15] um but yeah I got I got there's a page
[58:17] that talks about the three poles of his
[58:18] ministry it has quotes on it
[58:21] but anyways January 11th 63 is
[58:25] when they calculated brother Branham had
[58:28] the vision
[58:29] of the getting the king's sword
[58:31] let me find it yeah here's the king the
[58:33] sword the king and it was right there in
[58:35] uh
[58:37] I don't remember the name of the the
[58:38] mountain
[58:39] might be rattlesnake
[58:41] fall rattlesnake Mesa or something like
[58:44] that
[58:45] Somewhere in Arizona I can't remember
[58:48] the name of that right now because I
[58:49] don't that's not my Ministry to study
[58:51] every detail brother Adam's life I
[58:53] preached the word of God I don't have
[58:54] his whole Ministry memorized
[58:57] um anyways they calculated it by the
[58:59] time I think January 3rd brother Ram
[59:00] left uh Jeffersonville to go out west
[59:03] God called him to go out west
[59:06] and then it would have been uh January
[59:08] 11th that he had this experience where
[59:10] he uh Christ showed him that he had the
[59:13] sword of the king
[59:15] and the sword is the word
[59:17] right the sword and remember Ephesians
[59:20] chapter six what's our last piece of uh
[59:23] armor it's actually offensive it's the
[59:24] sword of the spirit
[59:25] so church not only does brother Brandon
[59:27] have a sword you've got a sword too amen
[59:30] don't forget that you've got the sword
[59:32] too
[59:33] so it's scriptural to say brother Ram
[59:35] had the sword of the spirit because each
[59:36] one of us have it amen
[59:39] Glory
[59:40] but he had this experience
[59:42] and be based upon this experience that's
[59:45] why I believe the tent vision is
[59:47] fulfilled
[59:49] now
[59:50] let me say this you've got people in
[59:53] this message some people believe the
[59:54] tent vision is not yet fulfilled and so
[59:56] we've got to set up a tent and brogram's
[59:58] going to raise from the dead and we've
[1:00:00] got to go set up a tent he's going to
[1:00:01] preach and we're gonna have Revival
[1:00:02] services with brother Brandon I don't
[1:00:04] believe that one bit
[1:00:07] some people believe
[1:00:09] that brother random failed Division and
[1:00:11] there was never a um so the tent Vision
[1:00:13] never happened so I'm not in either of
[1:00:15] those groups I believe when brother Adam
[1:00:17] preached the Seven Seals that was the
[1:00:19] Fulfillment of the tent vision
[1:00:21] because God said I'll meet you in there
[1:00:24] and brother I met or brother man was met
[1:00:26] by an Angel or the Holy Spirit every day
[1:00:28] for eight days
[1:00:31] that's my humble opinion he said he
[1:00:33] spent all those hours in there praying
[1:00:35] reading his Bible he said walking up and
[1:00:36] down the floor Lord what's the
[1:00:38] revelation of this first CLA he just had
[1:00:40] to wait what's the Revelation the second
[1:00:42] seal he said and then he'd have a vision
[1:00:44] sometimes you have to go outside it was
[1:00:46] so powerful he said I just he said
[1:00:47] standing in the ball if I preacher here
[1:00:49] years ago but standing in the prince of
[1:00:51] that ball of fire he said your human
[1:00:52] body can only take so much of that
[1:00:55] he'd have to go walk out you know and
[1:00:57] just he said feel like I'm human again
[1:01:00] so to me
[1:01:02] you know people say oh brother man's
[1:01:03] Visions fail not that I found
[1:01:05] what I found is that brother man didn't
[1:01:07] understand it or some people other than
[1:01:09] didn't understand it but if we looked at
[1:01:10] the word of God and we looked to his
[1:01:11] life they're fulfilled
[1:01:14] that's what I believe
[1:01:16] Hallelujah
[1:01:18] now here's the quote so this is in the
[1:01:20] seventh sea of romance preaching he said
[1:01:21] now
[1:01:22] if it said a sword of the king but it
[1:01:24] said the sword of the king and there's
[1:01:25] only one king that's God and he has one
[1:01:28] sword that's his word what I live by
[1:01:30] that so help me God standing over this
[1:01:32] holy desk here with this holy word
[1:01:33] laying here it's the word amen so
[1:01:36] brother I am sword in his is his
[1:01:38] revelation of the word of God the Seven
[1:01:41] Seals he just got done he's he's
[1:01:42] finishing up on the Seven Seals
[1:01:46] oh what a day we're living and what a
[1:01:48] great thing you see the mystery and the
[1:01:49] secret the third he's gonna say the
[1:01:51] third poll standing there when this left
[1:01:53] me so when this vision of the sword of
[1:01:54] the king he said it fit his hand
[1:01:56] perfectly was feather Ed sharp he said
[1:01:58] oh my fits my hand perfectly when this
[1:02:00] Vision left me of the sword of the king
[1:02:03] he said something just came to me and
[1:02:05] said Don't Fear
[1:02:07] now I didn't hear no voice like on the
[1:02:09] inside of me spoke I just have to tell
[1:02:10] you the truth that's exactly what
[1:02:12] happened something hit and said Don't
[1:02:13] Fear this is that third pole
[1:02:16] so on January 11th he had this Vision
[1:02:19] the third pole is this word and then two
[1:02:21] months later he preaches the Seven Seals
[1:02:26] right and the angel said I'll meet you
[1:02:27] in there in the third poll
[1:02:30] right for the third poll
[1:02:32] it'd be time of prayer it'll be
[1:02:33] consecration it won't be a public show
[1:02:35] not in front of the public it was just
[1:02:36] with their local home Church it wasn't a
[1:02:38] public show
[1:02:40] right like the other two wasn't
[1:02:41] campaigns it was just in their local
[1:02:43] church now to me that's just as simple
[1:02:45] that's to me that's just simple as one
[1:02:46] plus one is two or is it three
[1:02:49] I'm just kidding
[1:02:51] he said this is that third poll it's so
[1:02:54] simple to me why people I don't know why
[1:02:55] I guess it takes just humility it takes
[1:02:57] a revelation or something
[1:03:03] he said third poll you remember he said
[1:03:05] you've had so many impersonators of this
[1:03:06] the first two polls what you tried to
[1:03:08] explain but don't even try this see do
[1:03:10] you remember 100 numbers that Vision why
[1:03:12] it's been all over taping everywhere the
[1:03:13] vision of the tent like I read you
[1:03:14] earlier from 56. why it's all over the
[1:03:17] table that's been about six years ago
[1:03:18] seven years ago but seven years ago said
[1:03:20] don't try to explain to see this is that
[1:03:22] third poll but I'll meet you in there
[1:03:24] that's right he said don't try
[1:03:27] now this scripture shows how he was in
[1:03:30] there
[1:03:31] 560 it ended up being there eight days
[1:03:33] she was he was in prayer
[1:03:35] when the fifth seal came he said I was
[1:03:36] just out in prayer before Daybreak I was
[1:03:39] out in prayer and I just have set these
[1:03:41] last five or six days in a little room
[1:03:43] don't see no one
[1:03:46] now how many of us have ever sit in a
[1:03:47] room reading our Bible praying for eight
[1:03:49] days in a row I mean how many of us have
[1:03:51] ever done that
[1:03:53] I've never done that
[1:03:55] but this age the angel said I'll meet
[1:03:57] you in there in that private little room
[1:04:00] in a time of prayer and Consecration and
[1:04:03] this will be the third poll
[1:04:04] now it's got to be the Seven Seals it's
[1:04:06] got to be a memory of that Vision out
[1:04:08] west he's on the cross and all this
[1:04:10] Glory coming into him all this
[1:04:12] Revelation
[1:04:13] hallelujah praise God Amen
[1:04:16] remember out west he got the rebel what
[1:04:18] was Revelation he said go back to open
[1:04:20] the Seven Seals for God
[1:04:23] right so the inspiration was go back
[1:04:24] there and I'll meet you so we got that
[1:04:26] Glory got all that confidence the Lord's
[1:04:28] going to open the Seven Seals and he
[1:04:29] drove back and then the Lord met him
[1:04:31] every day for eight days in a row or
[1:04:33] eight or nine days in a row
[1:04:35] met him every single day to preach the
[1:04:37] revelation of the Seven Seals that's
[1:04:39] what I'm going to preach the Lord
[1:04:40] willing the next time I go to the
[1:04:41] Junction City Saints I'm going to preach
[1:04:43] in the Seven Seals because brother
[1:04:44] Irvin's like he's like you gotta get up
[1:04:46] to the church afterwards my brother
[1:04:47] Jesse said Seven Seals
[1:04:49] he said something leaped in my heart
[1:04:52] I thought Oh Glory you must be a saint
[1:04:55] because that's our message
[1:04:58] the message is the mystery of God is
[1:05:00] finished amen that's our mystery that's
[1:05:02] our revelation
[1:05:04] and I told her brother it's just the
[1:05:05] Seven Seals are just the anoint the
[1:05:07] first four seals just the anointings on
[1:05:08] the seven Church ages it's so simple all
[1:05:10] right so simple
[1:05:12] and then we get the the fifth seal which
[1:05:14] is the Jews Sixth Seal tribulation seven
[1:05:15] seal Rapture and all the time left
[1:05:18] before the new heavens and new earth
[1:05:20] it's very very simple now take some time
[1:05:22] to to digest it but once you once you
[1:05:25] catch it it's very very simple
[1:05:28] and and those unlock romance so those
[1:05:30] unlock those connect all the mysteries
[1:05:32] of the Bible together and they do
[1:05:33] especially the Jewish part
[1:05:35] that really unlocks everything
[1:05:37] because then we can see how people can
[1:05:39] be saved yet blinded to Christ
[1:05:41] right and then we know the Jews
[1:05:43] condition we know where they are they're
[1:05:45] Souls under the altar of incense in
[1:05:47] heaven and then there are souls right by
[1:05:48] the altar of Jesus throne in heaven
[1:05:50] there's there's at least two layers two
[1:05:52] levels in heaven at least
[1:05:54] right in the seventh we say the highest
[1:05:56] dimension
[1:05:58] all right
[1:06:01] now your brother I'm even admits
[1:06:03] when he preached the first seal he said
[1:06:05] I would have made a horrible mistake on
[1:06:07] that first seal if it hadn't been about
[1:06:08] 12 o'clock in the day when the Holy
[1:06:10] Spirit came in the room and corrected me
[1:06:12] on something I was writing down to say
[1:06:14] he was going to preach it from an old
[1:06:16] context he said but then the Holy Spirit
[1:06:18] swept out in the room and the first seal
[1:06:21] opened up
[1:06:22] amen praise God hallelujah in that
[1:06:24] wonderful praise God
[1:06:26] a church that should be a reality in our
[1:06:27] lives
[1:06:28] Holy Spirit should come into our lives
[1:06:30] into our services and it should open
[1:06:32] things up to us so we understand
[1:06:34] right
[1:06:35] Allelujah
[1:06:37] like that's what happened we're out
[1:06:38] there in the point it's just it's just I
[1:06:39] just use it because it's the most recent
[1:06:40] example right
[1:06:41] but it's like when it's like when I
[1:06:43] preach on the dancing and remember you
[1:06:44] were worshiping brother and the Holy
[1:06:45] Spirit struck you right that's how the
[1:06:46] Holy Spirit could just come in the room
[1:06:48] and just come he's just come in a great
[1:06:50] way like that
[1:06:52] praise God and look he said I'll meet
[1:06:53] you in there did God meet brother
[1:06:54] Brandon in the room yes he said it right
[1:06:56] here
[1:06:57] he emits I would have made horrible
[1:06:58] mistakes if God hadn't met me in the
[1:07:00] room down there
[1:07:02] um
[1:07:06] and then he says you know at the seventh
[1:07:08] seal he also says
[1:07:10] there was lots of things happening that
[1:07:11] week he says I'm sure you noticed the
[1:07:13] little Collins boy was healed dying and
[1:07:16] that girl was healed in leukemia there
[1:07:17] was numerous miracles going on he said
[1:07:20] the kingdom of God is coming it's been
[1:07:22] coming more from the negative the
[1:07:24] positive as it has been
[1:07:26] we're drawing closer to God all the time
[1:07:29] and then he says I like to add this of
[1:07:31] all the service that ever had in all my
[1:07:33] life I believe this week has been the
[1:07:35] most glorious time of all my life in
[1:07:37] services
[1:07:40] now wouldn't that make sense if this was
[1:07:42] the greatest Services of his life
[1:07:43] wouldn't this make sense that this is
[1:07:45] the third poll of his ministry
[1:07:47] where the angel would meet him every day
[1:07:49] I'll meet you in there it won't be a
[1:07:52] public show before the people but I'll
[1:07:53] meet you in there I'll give you the
[1:07:54] revelation of the Seven Seals and this
[1:07:57] was greater than the first pole and the
[1:07:59] second Pole
[1:08:00] right does that make sense
[1:08:03] he says these are the greatest sermons
[1:08:04] but I was also in the little room
[1:08:06] for nine days or eight days and God met
[1:08:09] with me every day why can't people see
[1:08:11] it my
[1:08:12] it's just so sad
[1:08:13] people can't see it
[1:08:15] they think Brothers got to rise from the
[1:08:16] dead and we've got to have a little tent
[1:08:18] or they think brother man's Vision
[1:08:19] failed it's impossible don't
[1:08:21] fail
[1:08:22] we went through it the only time a
[1:08:23] vision could fail is if it was a
[1:08:25] conditional promise of God
[1:08:29] fail because of the if it's a mistake
[1:08:32] right
[1:08:33] brother Brown didn't fail this one
[1:08:35] right he met the Lord met him there and
[1:08:37] he preached the revelation of the Seven
[1:08:39] Seals
[1:08:41] and look there's over a hundred people
[1:08:42] being baptized and that Vision he said
[1:08:44] there was hundreds of people being saved
[1:08:46] and baptized we don't know how many got
[1:08:48] saved during the week of the Seven Seals
[1:08:50] but over a hundred
[1:08:52] praise God
[1:08:54] okay now let me see how much more I got
[1:08:55] to go here uh where am I at slide 61
[1:08:58] where did I want to go
[1:09:00] oh my
[1:09:01] I want to go to 87.
[1:09:04] can I do it
[1:09:07] thanks sister
[1:09:09] Hallelujah some of these I'll just I'll
[1:09:11] skip let me let me skip through some of
[1:09:13] this this I appreciate that
[1:09:16] Hallelujah I feel pretty good I've
[1:09:18] actually I've been sleeping actually I
[1:09:19] was telling amen who actually been not
[1:09:20] setting my alarm the last few days I
[1:09:21] feel pretty good today I should be like
[1:09:24] I got some strength and energy
[1:09:26] but this goes back to that earlier slide
[1:09:29] I showed where I gave you the short
[1:09:31] timeline of the three polls
[1:09:34] so this is in Christ the mystery God
[1:09:36] revealed he preached I think for four
[1:09:37] hours in this sermon he says if you'll
[1:09:39] turn look at the clock look it's two
[1:09:40] o'clock the end of the second poll the
[1:09:42] third pulls at hand
[1:09:43] and then he says we took this song an
[1:09:46] octave higher the next poll is at hand
[1:09:47] amen so brother man kind of knew the
[1:09:50] third pole was coming on the seals had
[1:09:51] already been open four months earlier
[1:09:53] and then in perfect faith brother Adam I
[1:09:56] said prayed he did the out there's my 30
[1:09:57] minutes okay
[1:09:59] brother I did an hour prayer prayer line
[1:10:02] of just saying you know the blood of
[1:10:04] Jesus Christ makes you well your made
[1:10:06] whole sister your brother Lord Jesus
[1:10:08] heal my brother the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:09] Lord Jesus heal my sister in the name of
[1:10:11] Jesus Christ just for a whole straight
[1:10:12] whole hour
[1:10:15] and then he says I want to ask you a
[1:10:16] sincere question can you actually
[1:10:17] believe and feel now that there's
[1:10:19] something happened in you since you've
[1:10:20] laid hands on you raise your hand there
[1:10:22] it is this is what we waited for now
[1:10:24] look he said all these hands go up they
[1:10:25] already felt a change and they were sick
[1:10:27] in their bodies and after a prayer line
[1:10:28] they already felt the change all these
[1:10:31] people had felt a change in their bodies
[1:10:33] he says this is what we waited for this
[1:10:35] is just starting to bloom now see
[1:10:38] I did this for a purpose I'm working out
[1:10:39] something I'm taking this charge of
[1:10:41] faith and going right back to begin and
[1:10:43] come in to kind of raise faith in a
[1:10:45] bracket where you've never noticed it in
[1:10:47] that way before
[1:10:49] not a faith but a perfect Faith build it
[1:10:51] right in there
[1:10:52] watch a perfect god with a perfect heart
[1:10:54] keep a perfect Promise by his perfect
[1:10:55] word which is sharper than any two-edged
[1:10:57] sword and a discernment of thoughts and
[1:10:58] tens of the heart what we're coming to
[1:11:00] the Perfection because the people has
[1:11:02] come to this in order for the Rapture
[1:11:03] that's what's holding it away right now
[1:11:05] is waiting for that church to come that
[1:11:06] perfect raptured Faith looking for it it
[1:11:09] means a lot of Shaving down for me it
[1:11:11] means a lot for you but together we'll
[1:11:12] make it by the grace of God
[1:11:14] okay
[1:11:16] so now again I don't know Church how
[1:11:18] much of I don't know how perfect we have
[1:11:20] to be for the rapture well the reason I
[1:11:23] highlighted this is that whatever we
[1:11:24] need to be God's grace will bring us
[1:11:26] there praise God
[1:11:28] right just like God's grace brought
[1:11:30] Enoch to the Rapture and condition
[1:11:32] we saw that on Wednesday just like God's
[1:11:34] grace brought Elijah to the Rapture and
[1:11:36] condition right he was a man subject to
[1:11:38] like passions like you and I always men
[1:11:41] same Passions
[1:11:43] right but God's grace brought him to be
[1:11:45] in the condition for the Rapture God is
[1:11:47] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:11:49] amen hallelujah praise God I don't know
[1:11:52] how perfect we're going to be but
[1:11:53] whatever we have need of God's going to
[1:11:55] bring us to that at the right time of
[1:11:57] the rapture
[1:12:01] now this is uh how many months later
[1:12:03] let's see this would have been four
[1:12:04] months later
[1:12:07] now here's where he's going to go in the
[1:12:09] five times he says the third poll is
[1:12:11] operated in his ministry
[1:12:14] he said I'm going to say something to
[1:12:16] you now that haven't said all along that
[1:12:17] is the thing that we've been looked for
[1:12:19] for so long
[1:12:20] the third poll has now been Vindicated
[1:12:22] and I'm sure you all know what it is
[1:12:26] okay so back to that timeline in July he
[1:12:29] said we're getting ready for it right it
[1:12:31] already happened actually this because
[1:12:33] the Seven Seals were already revealed
[1:12:35] right you're just recognizing it and
[1:12:37] then in August the perfect Faith he says
[1:12:40] we're stepping into that third poll and
[1:12:42] now four months later he says it's
[1:12:44] Vindicated it's here
[1:12:46] and you know what it is
[1:12:48] and he precedes to tell five testimonies
[1:12:51] about speaking the word
[1:12:54] right just speaking the word
[1:12:57] so here's the five manifestations some
[1:12:59] of you might remember if you listen to
[1:13:00] that sermon Look Away to Jesus 63 he
[1:13:02] takes the first hour and goes through
[1:13:04] his thoughts about the third poll it's a
[1:13:06] great sermon to listen to you want to
[1:13:07] listen to me
[1:13:09] Sunny shimf which he has a candy store
[1:13:12] still it's in Jeffersonville I visited
[1:13:14] with brother Jose and brother William
[1:13:16] and we took pictures with those silly
[1:13:18] hats on so
[1:13:19] I got the proof on the slideshow I can
[1:13:21] show it to you
[1:13:22] he was dying and he was 45 pounds he was
[1:13:26] almost dead
[1:13:28] he was in some type of a plastic tent
[1:13:30] and brother bear had to dress up
[1:13:33] in the Hazmat suit or whatever and he
[1:13:35] had a vision in there he said he said he
[1:13:37] said you're going to sell me Red Hots
[1:13:39] again thus saith the Lord and he's dying
[1:13:41] he's 45 pounds he says thus say Lord
[1:13:44] you're going to sell me Red Hots again
[1:13:45] and he walks out and then a couple years
[1:13:47] later
[1:13:48] he goes in there to buy Christmas
[1:13:50] presents Red Hots
[1:13:53] and uh
[1:13:55] he says I'll take a bit of those Red
[1:13:56] Hots
[1:13:58] I love that story
[1:14:00] and he says Oh Brother Branham
[1:14:02] brother man says see it was thus saith
[1:14:04] the Lord
[1:14:05] you're gonna sell me Red Hots again
[1:14:08] so that's that's this that's the third
[1:14:10] poll speaking the word of God
[1:14:13] now that was in the 50s if I'm not
[1:14:15] mistaken
[1:14:18] second brother man squirrels I believe
[1:14:19] that was in 19 now that's why this is a
[1:14:21] good book sisters there and sister lean
[1:14:23] if you want one you can look up the
[1:14:24] squirrels I think squirrels was in 1960
[1:14:26] if I'm not mistaken maybe I can find it
[1:14:29] real quick it was in the fall
[1:14:31] there's a silver tip grizzly
[1:14:34] but you get all these uh that would have
[1:14:36] been before that would have been
[1:14:38] I don't know if I can find it real quick
[1:14:42] now it must have been 62.
[1:14:44] or maybe 1960. anyways
[1:14:48] now okay I could probably find it for me
[1:14:50] oh no there's right there it's 59 okay
[1:14:52] there's a squirrel all right I found it
[1:14:54] 59. so this was mid 50s this was 1959
[1:14:58] remember
[1:14:59] he said the third pole is already
[1:15:01] operating that was just three years
[1:15:02] after he had the vision of the third
[1:15:03] pole but he didn't know it was operating
[1:15:06] isn't that just like Jesus
[1:15:08] you know isn't that just like John the
[1:15:10] Baptist John the Baptist came and went
[1:15:11] and the disciples didn't even know he
[1:15:13] the scriptures that were fulfilled
[1:15:15] remember Jesus said he was a voice in
[1:15:17] the awareness he was Isaiah 40 and you
[1:15:19] didn't know it
[1:15:21] right so see how we see all this this is
[1:15:22] very scriptural God will be doing things
[1:15:24] and we're not even aware of what he's
[1:15:25] doing and we don't realize until later
[1:15:28] praise God
[1:15:29] right
[1:15:31] third how do you write now that's in
[1:15:32] here too I don't remember what year that
[1:15:33] was I have no idea on that one I think
[1:15:35] it's 62 or 61 if I'm not mistaken
[1:15:39] that's the one where she said that's
[1:15:41] nothing but the truth brother random
[1:15:42] about the squirrels and the Holy Spirit
[1:15:44] came on brother Ram said whatever you
[1:15:45] ask I'm giving to you right now in the
[1:15:46] name of Jesus Christ and if you don't
[1:15:47] get it right now I'm I'm a false prophet
[1:15:50] and he said she asked for the greatest
[1:15:52] thing you could ask for salvation of
[1:15:53] Souls that's why sister Lina you keep
[1:15:55] asking for the Salvation of your family
[1:15:58] don't ever quit on that that's the
[1:15:59] greatest thing you can ask for
[1:16:02] the fourth time brother man was out
[1:16:03] hunting with some brothers and they were
[1:16:06] way far out in the wilderness and they
[1:16:07] knew a storm was coming
[1:16:10] and they said as soon as you see that
[1:16:12] storm come in the snow you get back to
[1:16:14] camp
[1:16:16] and brother M saw the snow coming he
[1:16:18] started walking and the Holy Spirit said
[1:16:20] no turn and walk walk with me
[1:16:23] so then I said are you sure
[1:16:25] is that the God's voice or not because
[1:16:27] I'm gonna get buried in snow I'm going
[1:16:28] to be my wife's gonna be a widow if I
[1:16:30] don't get out of the snowstorm and The
[1:16:33] Voice come again said come walk with me
[1:16:35] so he turned to walked right into the
[1:16:37] snowstorm
[1:16:38] right towards the snowstorm and then the
[1:16:40] holy spirit said whatever you say it'll
[1:16:42] be that way
[1:16:43] now I'm just paraphrasing you can listen
[1:16:44] brother random brother brother Brown
[1:16:46] said he said in the name of Jesus he
[1:16:48] said it's going to be sunny now that
[1:16:50] storm is going to go back where it came
[1:16:51] from it's going to be sunny now until we
[1:16:53] leave this uh campgrounds
[1:16:56] and he said that's exactly what happened
[1:16:58] he said within a moment all the clouds
[1:17:00] and snow turned and went back he said
[1:17:02] they got to hunt the next few days
[1:17:05] so the third poll heals by the spoken
[1:17:08] word creates by the spoken word
[1:17:11] saved by the spoken word what Alters
[1:17:14] weather by this moment doesn't that
[1:17:16] sound like Jesus
[1:17:17] he said speak to the storm
[1:17:19] right he spoke to the storm
[1:17:22] right Moses created created by the
[1:17:24] spoken word
[1:17:26] thus saith the Lord there's going to be
[1:17:28] flies I'll say lord they're going to be
[1:17:29] fleas they'll say the Lord is going to
[1:17:30] be frogs he created by the spoken word
[1:17:33] and the last one was healing by the
[1:17:35] spoken word another healing by the
[1:17:36] spoken word when his wife had that tumor
[1:17:39] and Rhode Island was out in Arizona and
[1:17:41] prayed
[1:17:42] uh before his wife went into the the
[1:17:44] appointment
[1:17:45] and the Holy Spirit said stand up
[1:17:48] and he said whatever you say right now
[1:17:49] to be done for your wife he said before
[1:17:51] the doctor can the moment before he can
[1:17:54] touch the tumor it'll vanish it should
[1:17:55] be completely well and that's exactly
[1:17:58] what happened
[1:17:59] exactly what happened sister Mita was
[1:18:01] there to testify about it and uh so that
[1:18:04] those are the five times Brotherhood
[1:18:05] said the spoken word in the third poll
[1:18:08] had already operated
[1:18:10] okay we're at 4 30 all right
[1:18:12] now let me see here now here's where
[1:18:14] bunram says the third poll so this
[1:18:16] speaking the word is only operated by
[1:18:18] the leading of God and that's where it's
[1:18:19] real real difficult for us
[1:18:21] all right because even brother Brandon
[1:18:23] was like is this God telling me to walk
[1:18:24] with him here is this is this just my
[1:18:25] own imagination
[1:18:27] like what is
[1:18:28] like the still Small Voice we talked
[1:18:30] about sister all right
[1:18:34] they asked brother Branham they said
[1:18:36] brother Branham is the the third Paul is
[1:18:37] speaking the word
[1:18:39] it seems entirely possible for you to
[1:18:41] speak the word and we'd be fully
[1:18:43] restored ready for the Rapture if you
[1:18:45] just speak the word
[1:18:46] and would you do this if properly
[1:18:48] pressed upon they asked brother Brandon
[1:18:51] and he says my dear friend now I think
[1:18:53] you got a good statement yes sir
[1:18:55] in other words
[1:18:57] um you're believing because of the
[1:18:58] spoken words and things that he said
[1:19:00] about
[1:19:01] all of you here Witnesses squirrels and
[1:19:03] things but did you notice that was
[1:19:04] sovereignly given I never asked him Lord
[1:19:06] let me do this
[1:19:08] that's why people the people that want
[1:19:10] to speak things in the squeeze or
[1:19:11] whatever like if they want to do it it
[1:19:13] probably won't happen to them
[1:19:15] right because brother Adam said I never
[1:19:17] asked for this
[1:19:18] it was God leading me to do it and even
[1:19:20] if there will be a squeeze like that we
[1:19:21] don't know if there will be a squeeze
[1:19:23] like that
[1:19:26] he by his own Divine will came to me and
[1:19:28] said you do this remember I wasn't
[1:19:30] asking one thing about it Moses never
[1:19:32] asked to go down to Egypt right
[1:19:34] but God sent him down there
[1:19:37] now I believe the Holy Spirit could come
[1:19:39] to me and say in a vision go to a
[1:19:40] certain certain thing they're trying to
[1:19:41] overcome a certain thing I'm going to
[1:19:43] skip down and would it take place
[1:19:45] absolutely yes it absolutely would I'd
[1:19:47] take place but now upon my presuming now
[1:19:49] presume means Adventure without
[1:19:50] Authority Now isn't that what the
[1:19:52] sermon's about
[1:19:53] souls are in prison now that's he said
[1:19:55] it's presuming
[1:19:57] see I'd go right down there to help this
[1:19:59] person I'm just presuming it'll be all
[1:20:00] right then I don't know I can call the
[1:20:02] name Lord over them I can pray for them
[1:20:03] or do whatever I wish to
[1:20:07] he says it was up to my power if I had
[1:20:10] the authority to do it but I have to
[1:20:12] wait for orders to do those kind of
[1:20:14] things
[1:20:15] see I have the authority from God to do
[1:20:17] it but now when he gives the order she
[1:20:19] go back home well
[1:20:21] okay
[1:20:23] so we have authority over evil spirits
[1:20:25] we have authority over uh sicknesses
[1:20:28] diseases
[1:20:29] but the only way we know it's going to
[1:20:30] happen is if God gives us a actual thus
[1:20:33] saith the Lord for that
[1:20:35] right we don't know that's why you'll
[1:20:37] hear me pray If It Be Your Will Lord let
[1:20:39] it be done to court if it Be Your Will
[1:20:40] according to your will cause I don't
[1:20:41] know
[1:20:42] right unless God shows me something
[1:20:44] which
[1:20:46] never happened as far as Vision I've
[1:20:47] never seen a vision
[1:20:49] of that well maybe the vision when I got
[1:20:50] the Holy Ghost but not a vision of the
[1:20:52] future
[1:20:54] he said but first see no one even Jesus
[1:20:56] himself said the son can do nothing in
[1:20:58] himself but what do you see the father
[1:20:59] do that dude the son likewise we we know
[1:21:02] that Saint John 5 19.
[1:21:06] okay now here's an interesting thought
[1:21:08] too I'm almost done brother random felt
[1:21:09] the third pole would lay dormant until
[1:21:11] the time of the persecution before the
[1:21:12] Rapture if there is such a time and
[1:21:14] persecution for us if there is here's
[1:21:16] where he says it now we all know now he
[1:21:18] goes through those five examples that
[1:21:20] was a month earlier oh yeah just two
[1:21:22] weeks later he says we know what the
[1:21:24] third poll is we all understood that see
[1:21:26] you you'll have the tape that's the Look
[1:21:28] Away to Jesus
[1:21:30] and I think it'll just lay dormant for a
[1:21:32] little while until the great hour of
[1:21:33] persecution comes on that's when it be
[1:21:35] it'll speak it'll be manifested just
[1:21:37] like the five straight signs without
[1:21:39] failure perfectly and now I think just
[1:21:41] wait see to see what it does
[1:21:44] okay so see brother Brown thought the
[1:21:46] third poll wouldn't be as active until
[1:21:48] the time right before the rapture
[1:21:53] so I understand the third poll is
[1:21:55] speaking God's word right because he
[1:21:56] said that in perfect Faith he's praying
[1:21:58] for them
[1:21:59] to just believe God's promise that will
[1:22:01] heal you
[1:22:02] um
[1:22:03] oh yeah and even after a perfect Faith
[1:22:05] he says this
[1:22:08] he says now do you love him just think
[1:22:09] right here now already begun to work in
[1:22:11] your body now look at that he just
[1:22:12] prayed for them and God's already doing
[1:22:13] the healing in their body of your
[1:22:15] healing because that he he promised it
[1:22:16] would happen and now see did you catch
[1:22:19] what I was saying tonight so brother I
[1:22:20] was under the surface was trying to get
[1:22:23] them to see a scripture and I'm gonna
[1:22:24] I'm gonna show it next
[1:22:26] have you got the riddle of it
[1:22:29] don't you love when preachers give you a
[1:22:31] riddle
[1:22:32] Simon's really good at that give us
[1:22:34] riddles
[1:22:35] he's like let me try to
[1:22:37] discern you with something or let me try
[1:22:39] it right he's done that before
[1:22:44] he said have you got the riddle of it
[1:22:46] see if you say to this mountain see
[1:22:48] don't doubt don't doubt but believe
[1:22:50] what you have said
[1:22:52] now watch in less than five minutes
[1:22:54] every hand went up that's a work had
[1:22:56] begun in them right now
[1:22:59] so they believe Brothers prayer so much
[1:23:02] in faith in the word of God within five
[1:23:04] minutes they were already starting to
[1:23:05] feel the healing come on them
[1:23:07] that's a pretty good testimony right
[1:23:08] there
[1:23:10] now what does this all go back to what
[1:23:11] is all this third full stuff brother
[1:23:13] Jesse you went on for 45 minutes about
[1:23:15] the third Bowl what's the third pole
[1:23:17] it's this right here
[1:23:18] brother man I said this is the riddle
[1:23:20] behind all this
[1:23:22] in other words what is this third pole
[1:23:24] program says at the time of the rapture
[1:23:26] we may have such an anointing that we'll
[1:23:28] just speak
[1:23:29] God's word
[1:23:31] and whatever we have need of in that
[1:23:32] hour God may give it to us that's
[1:23:35] possible it's very possible
[1:23:37] right but I have later on here I can't
[1:23:39] find one thus saith the Lord quote about
[1:23:41] it
[1:23:43] so it's it's brother I'm just presuming
[1:23:45] it's him thinking he actually says I
[1:23:47] don't say the Lord tells me this but I
[1:23:49] think it won't though the third poll
[1:23:50] won't be used in a great way until the
[1:23:52] time of the squeeze
[1:23:53] he says I don't say the Lord tells me
[1:23:55] this
[1:23:57] have faith in God Jesus said now the
[1:24:00] only way you can have faith is is as if
[1:24:02] it's a gift of faith like we said this
[1:24:04] morning the only way you can have faith
[1:24:06] for healing is if God gives you a gift
[1:24:08] here's the gift of your healing here's
[1:24:10] the gift of your healing God has to give
[1:24:13] you that gift first everything we
[1:24:15] receive as a gift from God we don't earn
[1:24:17] it we're not going to brag in heaven
[1:24:19] right there's no boasting in heaven so
[1:24:21] you just have to humbly wait until God
[1:24:22] gives us gifts in our life that's part
[1:24:24] of our testimony
[1:24:27] for truly I say unto you that whatsoever
[1:24:29] shall I'm sorry that whosoever shall say
[1:24:32] in this mountain be thou removed and be
[1:24:34] thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt
[1:24:36] in his heart but shall believe that
[1:24:38] those things which he saith shall come
[1:24:41] to pass he shall have whatsoever he's
[1:24:43] saying now that's quite a promise
[1:24:45] therefore I say to you what things so
[1:24:48] ever ye desire When you pray believe
[1:24:50] that you receive them and ye shall have
[1:24:52] them what a promise
[1:24:54] right but then we know Paul died as a
[1:24:57] martyr John I'm sorry Peter was
[1:24:59] crucified upside down Timothy had often
[1:25:02] stomach's sake well what didn't they
[1:25:03] know this verse of course they knew this
[1:25:05] verse but you can't use this verse like
[1:25:07] it's a just your own toy in your pocket
[1:25:10] I don't keep I don't care I don't keep
[1:25:12] the third pole in my pocket I'll say
[1:25:13] that again so Brothers have said I like
[1:25:15] when you use that statement brother
[1:25:16] Jesse
[1:25:17] I don't keep the third pole in my pocket
[1:25:18] well I'll use it now I'll use it here I
[1:25:21] won't use it there I'll use it right
[1:25:22] here that's not that's not how it
[1:25:24] operates these scriptures were spoken
[1:25:26] and Paul could use them anytime so could
[1:25:28] Peter
[1:25:30] right but you can only use it as you're
[1:25:32] led to use it
[1:25:35] is this a good is this going to
[1:25:36] refresher tonight by God's grace
[1:25:38] now I'll close with this these are the
[1:25:40] three times I've spoken in the mountain
[1:25:42] and God moved in one of them I don't I
[1:25:44] gotta I gotta contact brother Mike I
[1:25:45] don't know
[1:25:46] I'll talk about that the first one was
[1:25:48] when I had a co-worker who couldn't get
[1:25:50] pregnant and uh my friend Debbie Lucas
[1:25:53] and I went over there and I did a Bible
[1:25:55] study and even some woman mocked me in
[1:25:57] the Bible study
[1:25:59] she's like Satan doesn't give us bad
[1:26:01] thoughts I just didn't say anything
[1:26:03] who was Vindicated to be right I was
[1:26:05] Vindicated to be right because they got
[1:26:07] pregnant
[1:26:08] she just kind of mocked me and made fun
[1:26:10] of me I said no there's scripture
[1:26:14] but I prayed for my co-worker and just
[1:26:16] one morning I was studying I can still
[1:26:17] remember at our house right now I just I
[1:26:20] just I stopped studying I got on my
[1:26:21] knees I started praying I was looking
[1:26:22] out the window and I just felt the power
[1:26:24] of God come on me I started weeping and
[1:26:25] crying I said I speak to that mountain
[1:26:27] of baroness in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:29] and I remember after I got started I
[1:26:31] went to my wife at the sink and I said
[1:26:32] honey I think I just spoke Something In
[1:26:34] The Name Of The Lord
[1:26:36] and I it might come to pass I don't know
[1:26:40] I didn't I was afraid I didn't tell
[1:26:41] anybody because it never happened to me
[1:26:43] ever like that before
[1:26:44] a few weeks later I got a text and there
[1:26:47] was her and her husband with the
[1:26:48] pregnancy test saying we're pregnant
[1:26:49] Jesse thanks for praying for us
[1:26:53] and I said glory and they had a little
[1:26:55] baby girl and then I ran into her in
[1:26:57] Fairlawn at the pulp
[1:26:59] the smoothie store she said I just had a
[1:27:01] dream about you about having another
[1:27:02] babies and I'm like oh no what
[1:27:04] he's a good dream or bad dream
[1:27:06] and I saw a third time she said we just
[1:27:08] had twins
[1:27:10] so she had a dream about me praying for
[1:27:13] them to have more babies and they had
[1:27:14] twins
[1:27:15] I can't explain that all I can say is
[1:27:18] that that's the first time I've ever
[1:27:19] spoken to a mountain ever
[1:27:22] second time was for hula and Zur and
[1:27:24] Bang's dad amen called me up at like
[1:27:26] seven or eight a.m on that Wednesday
[1:27:28] morning or whatever Tuesday morning
[1:27:30] and I went out there and I said I speak
[1:27:31] to that mountain of heart disease and I
[1:27:33] said he's going to come out of here
[1:27:34] completely well in the name of Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ and it happened
[1:27:37] and we just we just kept encouraging
[1:27:39] ourselves for weeks right to Speak Life
[1:27:41] brother but Jesse just speak life right
[1:27:42] and then bang had that Joan of Faith
[1:27:45] there by God's grace lying vanities
[1:27:47] lying vanities amen Hallelujah
[1:27:51] extra years with his family praise God
[1:27:53] all by the grace of God
[1:27:55] all by the grace of God extra window of
[1:27:57] Grace
[1:27:59] and then Tom Atkinson that was when
[1:28:00] Simon was involved in one of my best
[1:28:02] friends from high school called me and
[1:28:03] said my dad had a heart attack his wife
[1:28:06] uh
[1:28:08] gave him mouth to mouth and they had to
[1:28:10] shock him back to life very similar to
[1:28:11] Lee very similarly
[1:28:14] and he was in a coma and the doctor said
[1:28:15] he's got one percent chance just to wake
[1:28:18] up
[1:28:20] and Seth he's my friend Seth he called
[1:28:21] me up and said can you pray and I
[1:28:23] thought who can go pray for him Simon
[1:28:25] Simon Simon go pray for my best friend's
[1:28:27] dad or what not my best friend but one
[1:28:29] of my better friend
[1:28:31] and Simon got my text he said it was
[1:28:34] really late at night
[1:28:35] he said Simon said he went in his prayer
[1:28:37] clause and he said Lord he said if he's
[1:28:39] still alive in the morning I'll go pray
[1:28:40] for him
[1:28:41] and so Simon woke up texted me I said
[1:28:43] yeah he's still alive
[1:28:45] and Simon said he went and he said I was
[1:28:47] looking for signs God are you going to
[1:28:49] heal Tom or not he's a retired teacher
[1:28:54] and Simon said he saw all these signs
[1:28:55] like God's A Healer a guy like
[1:28:58] and Simon's Faith was raised up
[1:29:00] and so Simon got in there and my Heathen
[1:29:03] friend sat and listened to Simon tell
[1:29:05] testimonies for 10 minutes Simon
[1:29:06] preached for him for 10 minutes and
[1:29:08] Simon said my Heathen friend stood up
[1:29:10] and he said let's go pray for my dad
[1:29:12] right now and he's got one percent
[1:29:13] chance to even talk or wake up again
[1:29:17] that's how much God was anointing Simon
[1:29:19] and when Simon told me and Simon said
[1:29:21] Simon said he walked in there he said he
[1:29:23] said Seth your dad is going to live
[1:29:25] and all the doctors saying he's going to
[1:29:27] die and he's he's on uh he's on he's on
[1:29:30] the ventilator
[1:29:30] now when Simon told me that I'll be very
[1:29:32] honest I was very afraid when Simon told
[1:29:34] me that
[1:29:35] so I went my prayer closet that night
[1:29:38] and I started crying and I said Lord
[1:29:41] I said just something similar like this
[1:29:42] I said Lord I'm going to put my faith
[1:29:45] with Simons I said I feel how you I feel
[1:29:47] you've actually you've arranged these
[1:29:48] situations and I said Lord
[1:29:50] if you raise him up Tom Atkinson I said
[1:29:53] I'll tell him about brother Branham
[1:29:58] and so I was crying I said I speak to
[1:30:00] that mountain of that coma in Jesus
[1:30:02] Christ's name it's going to move and I
[1:30:04] forget how many weeks it was it might
[1:30:06] have been like you know your dad brother
[1:30:07] bank I don't know how many weeks but
[1:30:09] after a few weeks he woke up
[1:30:12] and then he started talking and then I
[1:30:13] got a picture of him on the last day he
[1:30:15] was in there he's still to this day
[1:30:16] completely whole
[1:30:18] and he had one chance to even live one
[1:30:20] percent
[1:30:21] and God turned it completely around
[1:30:23] now I remember I shared those
[1:30:24] testimonies in Napoleon and Mike and
[1:30:27] natania came up for netanya's back
[1:30:30] and I was just under that I was just
[1:30:32] crying so I don't know if it was God's
[1:30:33] anointing or not but I I said I speak to
[1:30:35] that mountain I think she had scoliosis
[1:30:37] or something like that
[1:30:39] so I need to always contact Mike today
[1:30:41] Lord winning after service I said I
[1:30:43] speak to that mountain of scoliosis I
[1:30:45] don't know if that's come to pass or not
[1:30:46] but she's at church she looks normal and
[1:30:48] healthy so I don't know
[1:30:50] and I remember when we prayed for Brian
[1:30:51] Hawkins Lydia you were there
[1:30:54] I don't know I don't remember if I spoke
[1:30:55] to them about it or not but I did use
[1:30:56] that verse
[1:30:58] where I spoke life his hips were
[1:31:00] degenerating and the the doctor said you
[1:31:03] got to have a double hip replacement and
[1:31:05] I said no that can't I can't happen to
[1:31:07] it he's 45.
[1:31:10] my uncle just had hip replacement he's
[1:31:11] in his 60s
[1:31:13] and I said brother can you confess all
[1:31:15] your sins yes something just come it
[1:31:16] just like the the sincerity the Holy
[1:31:19] Spirit fell on me
[1:31:20] and I said no we're going to pray right
[1:31:21] now we're going to rebuke that and then
[1:31:23] I was listening to Brother Ray I'm
[1:31:24] talking about the third poll two days
[1:31:26] later I was out weeding I Remember by
[1:31:27] the the blueberries
[1:31:28] I'm listening brother Brown I'm talking
[1:31:30] about the third poll and I get a text
[1:31:31] from Brian and said we don't know what
[1:31:32] happened
[1:31:33] he said but the doctor we went back for
[1:31:35] more scans the doctor said he's never
[1:31:36] she's never seen this before
[1:31:38] your degeneration has healed itself and
[1:31:41] you I don't need hip replacement anymore
[1:31:43] they said that's never happened before
[1:31:45] ever
[1:31:48] so I don't know if I spoke to the
[1:31:49] mountain or not but I did Speak Life
[1:31:52] okay and then remember the one about
[1:31:54] Jose I don't know if Jose spoke to the
[1:31:55] mountain but he told his niece she'd get
[1:31:57] pregnant and then the the next year the
[1:32:00] baby was born on my birthday
[1:32:02] tell you God has a sense of humor
[1:32:05] he really knows how to make us laugh and
[1:32:06] humble us
[1:32:08] so
[1:32:10] this is another reason why I know
[1:32:12] brother man's message is right because
[1:32:14] if I had not heard brother Brandon I
[1:32:15] never would have known those verses
[1:32:17] about speaking the mountain because
[1:32:18] that's the program majors on that like
[1:32:20] towards the end of his ministry because
[1:32:21] that's his ministry
[1:32:23] speak to the mountain he spoke to the
[1:32:24] storm squirrels how do you write you
[1:32:27] know you
[1:32:28] Sonny Schiff his wife's tumor
[1:32:31] speak the word
[1:32:33] but you got to wait for the right time
[1:32:34] of it
[1:32:36] okay no I want to yeah so I don't have
[1:32:39] any thus saith the Lord quotes third
[1:32:40] pull for the bride
[1:32:43] here's the only one now this one I
[1:32:44] wanted to show you but Ram said the
[1:32:46] third poll is so sacred I mustn't say
[1:32:47] much about it as he told me in the
[1:32:49] beginning this say nothing of it you
[1:32:50] remember that years ago it speaks for
[1:32:52] itself now look at that all those
[1:32:54] testimonies I had those testimony they
[1:32:56] speak for themselves
[1:32:57] because God does something Supernatural
[1:32:59] man can't do it
[1:33:02] I've tried to explain to others I made a
[1:33:04] mistake this will be the thing that to
[1:33:06] my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me
[1:33:07] this this will be the thing that will
[1:33:09] start the rapturing faith for the going
[1:33:10] of the way
[1:33:12] program thought it would be such on a
[1:33:14] greater scale right before the Rapture
[1:33:15] it could be I don't know it could be
[1:33:18] so let's uh let's stand in the promise
[1:33:20] we I'm sorry let's stand to our feet
[1:33:22] here we still have the promise musicians
[1:33:24] can come
[1:33:25] I will pick up on Souls that are in
[1:33:27] prison now
[1:33:28] I just wanted you to refreshing on the
[1:33:30] third pole it has at least four parts to
[1:33:32] it right
[1:33:34] I wanted to just have a good reminder
[1:33:36] every time brother random use the third
[1:33:38] pole
[1:33:40] it was God leading him to do it it
[1:33:42] wasn't what he wanted to do it was God
[1:33:45] leading him to do it
[1:33:47] okay
[1:33:48] so we know the same must be true in our
[1:33:50] lives
[1:33:51] it's probably good good spot to stop
[1:33:54] right there
[1:33:57] yeah I did have actually one more quote
[1:33:58] let me let me do one more here let's
[1:34:00] just start playing
[1:34:02] let me do one more here
[1:34:06] here brother Ram says it plainly
[1:34:09] that's what I'm saying is that church
[1:34:10] God may speak the word through you but
[1:34:12] you've got to wait for that moment
[1:34:15] right you don't know when it's going to
[1:34:16] come unless God will give you a vision
[1:34:17] or a dream right then that'd be like a
[1:34:19] vision like you know what's going to
[1:34:20] happen but you got to wait for these
[1:34:21] things to come to pass
[1:34:24] well the random said here's so here's
[1:34:25] what we need to work on as a church
[1:34:27] right we need to love each other too
[1:34:28] right that's really an important thing
[1:34:29] to work on but he said work on that
[1:34:31] pulsation that spare of the moment so
[1:34:33] that that moment where you feel like is
[1:34:34] God
[1:34:36] does God want me to speak the word
[1:34:39] he says like Joshua did Joshua spoke to
[1:34:41] the son and it Stood Still well how did
[1:34:43] he know it just happened right in that
[1:34:44] moment right
[1:34:46] how did I know about you know Tom
[1:34:48] Atkinson or how do you know about you
[1:34:50] know brother amen and his father-in-law
[1:34:51] when he called me how did I know I don't
[1:34:53] know I
[1:34:54] just in that moment
[1:34:56] how did Brother Graham no you know the
[1:34:57] Lord told him speak it right
[1:35:00] you got to just wait in that moment and
[1:35:01] Mary Magdalene all those I'm not sure
[1:35:03] about Mary Magdalene speaking the word
[1:35:04] I'm not sure
[1:35:06] just that moment when something is
[1:35:08] revealed to you grab it hold on to it
[1:35:10] the spare of a moment so we have to be
[1:35:12] aware of when God raises your faith in a
[1:35:15] particular moment in order to speak
[1:35:16] God's word
[1:35:18] now a good example recently was when
[1:35:19] Lena felt led to go pray for my wife a
[1:35:21] couple months ago remember that was like
[1:35:22] Lena like in that moment Lena like
[1:35:24] should I do this and she did and that
[1:35:25] was a real blessing to my wife
[1:35:28] so that's what I'm saying like this is
[1:35:30] just like a step of maturity like
[1:35:32] following the leadership of the Lord is
[1:35:34] not an easy thing right it's a we gotta
[1:35:36] have to Humble ourselves we've got to be
[1:35:37] very spiritual
[1:35:39] because what we don't want to happen is
[1:35:41] to speak to mountains and they don't
[1:35:43] move
[1:35:44] if that would happen then we got to say
[1:35:46] we're sorry
[1:35:47] right like that's why I need to go text
[1:35:48] brother Mike and I just remember that
[1:35:51] if not I got to say I'm sorry
[1:35:58] so it's a serious thing in other words
[1:36:00] God is speaking through us
[1:36:02] that's kind of like the third bullet God
[1:36:04] is speaking right through us and it's
[1:36:06] going to come to pass
[1:36:08] right like with all those times built
[1:36:10] around the five times they all came to
[1:36:11] pass
[1:36:15] okay so did you enjoy that tonight my
[1:36:19] God
[1:36:20] it's a little different than I normally
[1:36:21] preach right
[1:36:23] hope you enjoyed that good review on the
[1:36:25] third pull
[1:36:26] and just a bounce I want to bring a
[1:36:27] bounce to that to the tent Vision as
[1:36:29] well there's a lot in there I mean
[1:36:31] some preachers preach months on just the
[1:36:33] tent vision
[1:36:34] you can never do that
[1:36:36] for months on the third pole I don't
[1:36:38] think that's
[1:36:40] that's maybe not yet
[1:36:43] if God does lead us that way to the
[1:36:45] Rapture then we have to go that way but
[1:36:47] I just want you to be aware of that
[1:36:49] scripture Mark chapter 11. if God
[1:36:51] anoints you to speak the word of God
[1:36:53] then speak the word of God
[1:36:54] and then God's word cannot fail
[1:36:57] but until then we just ask the Lord If
[1:36:59] It Be Your Will
[1:37:00] that's why you hear me in the light If
[1:37:01] It Be Your Will It Be Your Will it would
[1:37:03] be your will because I don't know
[1:37:05] I wait for the moments when I'm highly
[1:37:07] emotional or highly sincere I start
[1:37:09] seeing things it's kind of like when I
[1:37:10] preach on David in the point like I'd
[1:37:12] seen all these signs David David like I
[1:37:14] just knew it
[1:37:15] and then God man it like God manifested
[1:37:17] like that was what God wanted to be
[1:37:19] preached undoubtedly
[1:37:22] it speaks for itself that service spoke
[1:37:25] for itself
[1:37:26] right
[1:37:29] and so as Christians we got to work on
[1:37:31] that
[1:37:32] moment we're recognized okay God's
[1:37:34] leading me
[1:37:37] remember did you
[1:37:38] spoke that word
[1:37:40] was there anything else working on you
[1:37:42] like do you listen to any sermons that
[1:37:44] week or anything that was got your
[1:37:45] thought or did that just come on you
[1:37:49] okay
[1:37:51] now I remember when brother amen got the
[1:37:53] Holy Ghost what'd he do what sister who
[1:37:54] what'd you do that whole week you were
[1:37:57] drawn closer to God right
[1:38:00] did you call them deep Eagle surface is
[1:38:02] nasty they made ready they they were
[1:38:04] feeling LED
[1:38:05] for that moment right God was leading
[1:38:07] you up to that same thing
[1:38:09] you're let you're let you're in that
[1:38:11] channel right
[1:38:12] and so with these type of things
[1:38:13] speaking the word it's got to be God
[1:38:15] leading us into that channel
[1:38:17] now how many want to follow the spirit
[1:38:19] thank God
[1:38:20] let's pray I know I went a long time
[1:38:21] you've been a good audience I got you
