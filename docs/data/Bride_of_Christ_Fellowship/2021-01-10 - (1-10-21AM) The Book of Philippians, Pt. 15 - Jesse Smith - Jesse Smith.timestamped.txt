[32:08] only but doers of the word speak blesses
[32:11] today in Jesus Christ name s amen praise
[32:15] God let's stand and take our Bibles here
[32:17] let's go to Philippians chapter 4 like
[32:19] to continue on this thought I'm going to
[32:21] just try to preach about 40 minutes on
[32:23] Philippians and then we'll I like to
[32:26] stop the live stream and then just just
[32:28] share some things about you know the
[32:29] political situation and uh just you know
[32:33] some things that I probably would rather
[32:35] not go on live
[32:39] stream just because of uh the system
[32:43] right the Big Brother system they're all
[32:44] listening and uh just I just want to
[32:47] share some things personally from my
[32:48] heart to the Saints so let me just
[32:50] preach a little bit on uh Philippians
[32:52] then Lord willing we'll get to uh just
[32:55] you know some reactions
[32:58] uh to this
[32:59] week you know it's amazing you know the
[33:01] whole world can be in turmoil and yet we
[33:03] can have peace yes that's right praise
[33:05] God like we're we're affected by it we
[33:07] see it but then when we come to the
[33:08] house of God or when we come to prayer
[33:10] it just seems like like okay like I went
[33:14] to the store this morning and bought
[33:15] those groceries I'm like everything's
[33:16] okay everybody looks all mad you know
[33:18] and I'm just happy I'm like excuse me
[33:21] you know like we're we got our carts and
[33:22] I'm like oh pardon me excuse me you know
[33:24] everyone's like
[33:26] okay but it's just the peace of God that
[33:28] passes all understanding amen and we're
[33:30] grateful for that you know and it's not
[33:32] anything that we've done it's just you
[33:34] know surrendering to the holy spirit so
[33:36] we're thankful for God's grace
[33:38] Philippians
[33:42] 4 uh let's start at verse
[33:47] eight now I keep thinking you know we'll
[33:49] get done with it today we'll get done
[33:50] with it today and as I study things just
[33:52] I like to go slower through these
[33:54] scriptures and um it just seems like I
[33:57] just want to stop and I want to
[33:59] emphasize each point this has been I
[34:03] think a very timely series for us you
[34:05] know Paul is in the midst of being in
[34:07] prison and yet he finds so much joy he
[34:10] is so full of God's joy that he's
[34:12] encouraging others who are not in prison
[34:14] to have joy and contentment and what a
[34:17] great lesson for us to be content in
[34:19] this hour praise
[34:20] God content with the Holy Spirit
[34:24] Philippians 4 uh let's read 8 and n and
[34:27] then we'll do our memory verse my choice
[34:29] would be uh 1st Samuel 17:47 but let's
[34:32] read Philippians
[34:33] 4 8
[34:35] and9 let's all read eight and nine
[34:38] together ready one 2 3 finally Brethren
[34:42] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[34:45] things are honest whatsoever things are
[34:49] just things are pure whatsoever things
[34:53] are lovely whatsoever things are of good
[34:56] report if there be any virtue and if
[34:59] there be any praise think on these
[35:03] things those things which ye have both
[35:06] learned and received and heard and seen
[35:10] in me do and the God of Peace shall be
[35:13] with you praise God now let's go to uh
[35:16] 1st Samuel 17:47 this is just a memory
[35:19] verse uh I like I selected for this
[35:22] month ask the Lord to write it on the
[35:23] fleshly tables of our hearts
[35:37] no doubt we're going to have trials this
[35:38] year but the Lord will save us out of
[35:41] everyone if it's the year of his coming
[35:43] then we'll be saved through the Rapture
[35:44] praise God Amen if it's not then he'll
[35:46] save us and Deliver Us from all of our
[35:48] Temptations and trials amen lead us not
[35:51] in temptation but Deliver Us from Evil
[35:54] he's the deliverer he saves by his
[35:56] mighty hand praise God let's all read
[35:58] verse 47 1 Samuel uh 17:47 1 2 3 and all
[36:04] this assembly shall know that the Lord
[36:07] saveth not with sword and spear for the
[36:10] battle is the Lord's and he will give
[36:12] you into our hands amen may God has
[36:15] blessings to the reading of his word you
[36:16] may be seated praise
[36:19] God I do have some quotes here and some
[36:22] slides here I just want to mention and
[36:24] let me open this up in case I got to
[36:26] look up some Greek or Hebrew or
[36:27] something like that just comes in handy
[36:29] when we got to do
[36:33] that I trust everybody had a good week
[36:35] in the Lord uh by God's grace we got
[36:37] back to school this week so it was a
[36:39] nice week I'm just a little tired and
[36:40] worn out but uh feeling refresh after
[36:43] yesterday hope everybody's feeling
[36:44] refreshed today brother Johnny did you
[36:45] have to work yesterday brother oh praise
[36:47] God so hopefully you're feeling
[36:48] refreshed too brother Jose did you work
[36:50] yesterday buddy no brother good praise
[36:52] the Lord oh sometimes did you work
[36:55] yesterday oh praise the Lord Praise
[36:57] night Friday oh it's your Friday night
[36:58] well yeah well it goes into Saturday
[37:00] brother so it goes into Saturday I yes
[37:03] yes sir I understand so I'm glad
[37:05] everybody's feeling good uh that
[37:07] Saturday is such a day of uh such a
[37:08] needed day to kind of recover for me I
[37:10] don't know about you but it's such a a
[37:12] great day to recover and hopefully
[37:14] you're feeling strong today in the
[37:16] spirit of the Lord so I'd like to uh uh
[37:19] look at this thought like I said I'll
[37:20] set the timer now give me about 40
[37:22] minutes here we'll try to uh look at
[37:25] Philippians here for a few moments
[37:30] uh how many remember where brother Bram
[37:32] said that we are resting on what Paul
[37:34] preached praise God I just always want
[37:36] to keep that at the for Forefront of our
[37:37] minds you know I imagine we'll go to
[37:39] Colossians after we finish this uh
[37:41] series here it's just been so wonderful
[37:44] to me you know at as you know just
[37:47] personally going through these books you
[37:49] know have been so perfect like when we
[37:51] went through Ephesians it was right at
[37:52] the time I was dealing with this uh
[37:54] brandom Tabernacle thing and emphasized
[37:57] the full ministry right and as I go
[37:59] through Philippians I see Paul defending
[38:01] the faith and that's what I've went
[38:03] through recently just defending the one
[38:05] Faith given to Jesus right or Jesus gave
[38:07] to brother brandham and so I just see
[38:09] how these scriptures just come alive and
[38:11] I hope you can see your life in these
[38:13] scriptures as well that's my great
[38:15] prayer that you will see and you will
[38:17] gain such spiritual benefits from these
[38:20] scriptures because this is what we're
[38:21] resting on praise God this is the gospel
[38:24] that if anybody changes one of these
[38:26] they're cursed
[38:28] so we must pay attention we must uh gain
[38:31] the insights that Paul is sharing uh as
[38:35] he got the revelation of this from Jesus
[38:38] Christ himself praise God and remember
[38:40] brother R said in the church agent book
[38:42] those that are in the bride are in the
[38:44] word all the way amen so we shouldn't
[38:46] get further away from the word we should
[38:48] get more into the word we must know what
[38:51] the word says praise God Amen now uh
[38:54] let's look at part 15 here probably have
[38:56] maybe one or two more part Parts we'll
[38:57] see it may stretch further we'll see
[38:59] what the Lord does but
[39:03] um he says those things both
[39:07] learned now look see how Paul Paul
[39:10] expected them to learn from the
[39:11] preachers praise God right like I expect
[39:14] you to learn something from the word
[39:16] that's preached whether it's me or
[39:17] brother cam or brother Keith Randolph or
[39:20] whoever it is expect you to learn praise
[39:23] God I expect myself to learn I don't
[39:26] want to be uh lazy each year I want to
[39:29] be more spiritually on fire each year
[39:32] praise God I want to be able to learn
[39:34] and say this year I'll be more diligent
[39:37] with this area of my life praise God
[39:39] even if even if it's just one more area
[39:41] I want to be more diligent with this
[39:43] area of my life yeah I want to learn how
[39:46] to draw closer to the Lord so Paul says
[39:49] you which you have both learned remember
[39:51] he was only around them maybe a few
[39:52] weeks or months at
[39:54] Max uh and this was 11 years prior to
[39:57] Paul writing this so most of the people
[40:00] in the church right probably didn't meet
[40:02] Paul at that point right it was 11 years
[40:03] later they never had a chance to meet
[40:05] him the church was steadily growing but
[40:08] he said those things which you both
[40:09] learned and received and heard and seen
[40:12] in me do and the God of Peace shall be
[40:15] with you now Church did you catch that
[40:17] he he just said the God of Peace will be
[40:20] with you but two verses
[40:22] earlier uh he said the peace of God will
[40:25] keep your hearts and Minds through
[40:27] Christ Jesus amen amen so he said in
[40:30] other words if you do what I'm telling
[40:31] you to do if you pray the way I'm
[40:34] telling you to pray Hallelujah if you
[40:36] act and learn those things I'm telling
[40:38] you to learn if you put this gospel into
[40:41] action then God's peace will be with you
[40:43] praise God you'll feel it uh in your
[40:46] mind you'll be uh you have a peaceful
[40:48] State about you praise God you won't be
[40:50] in turmoil all the time you'll have
[40:52] peace and he said then the God of Peace
[40:54] will stay with you Amy amen so Paul was
[40:59] and here's a man remember writing this
[41:01] from prison he's writing this from
[41:03] prison and he can have peace being a
[41:05] slave right he can have peace being a
[41:07] prisoner he doesn't have free more he
[41:09] doesn't have free will to go talk to
[41:11] whoever he wants to talk to he can't go
[41:13] call his mom right if his mom was still
[41:16] alive he couldn't go talk to his dad he
[41:19] couldn't even go to the store so look
[41:22] church we have so many freedoms and
[41:24] Liberties if a man in prison can have
[41:26] peace with God so can we amen he didn't
[41:29] have the free all he had to do was
[41:31] really the freedom to eat and get gifts
[41:33] the the Bible says we'll get to here he
[41:35] did have freedom to receive some gifts
[41:37] just like you know I've sent some gifts
[41:38] to people in prison from time to time
[41:40] you know or little monetary offerings or
[41:42] something like that you can give them
[41:43] gifts and so forth he had the freedom to
[41:46] get gifts uh thankfully he had the
[41:48] freedom to write letters and send them
[41:49] out thank God Amen look at that even in
[41:52] the midst of Satan trying to lock him
[41:53] down he couldn't stop the word of God
[41:56] see Church the God's word will never be
[41:57] stopped amen as much as they try to do
[42:00] it they'll keep trying they they'll
[42:02] never be able to stop God's word it's
[42:04] living and active and Jesus said it will
[42:06] go all the way around the world amen
[42:08] amen to every Kindred Nation people and
[42:11] tongue you cannot Satan cannot stop this
[42:14] word amen glory amen my even the prison
[42:19] houses couldn't stop it and they won't
[42:21] stop it yet praise God thank the Lord
[42:25] kind of getting into that Twitter thing
[42:27] now uh he says what things he said those
[42:30] things what things Paul the things that
[42:33] he mentioned previously in verse eight
[42:36] see not everything you see in a Believer
[42:38] you can you want to model right brother
[42:41] man he he says it numerous times he said
[42:43] be careful not to take your pastor's
[42:47] Spirit he says he said I go to many
[42:49] churches and the people act just like
[42:51] their Pastor that's why I like that I'm
[42:53] still probably the loudest shouter and
[42:55] screamer and I'm one of the few that
[42:56] dances from time to time you know like
[43:00] because you everybody's just letting me
[43:02] be me right and I'm letting you be you
[43:05] praise God right I like that that's nice
[43:08] Freedom praise God brother R said he go
[43:10] to many denominational churches and
[43:12] whatever the pastor does that's what
[43:13] they all do whatever the pastor says
[43:15] that's what they all say like just human
[43:17] things like human sayings and attitudes
[43:19] and he said instead of getting the Holy
[43:21] Spirit they're getting the pastor's
[43:23] Spirit right so I'm trusting by God's
[43:26] grace that Paul PA is saying and and
[43:27] we're saying that we're getting the Holy
[43:29] Spirit and not one another's spirit amen
[43:33] we're not getting each other's Spirit
[43:34] we're getting Jesus's spirit amen amen
[43:38] see there's variety right there's
[43:39] variety of flowers there's variety of
[43:42] Landscapes there's variety of all kinds
[43:44] of variety of nature Stars there's so
[43:47] much variety and so we have to have
[43:49] respect for all the variety in God's
[43:51] nature and also in God's people praise
[43:53] God Amen
[43:58] so we we want to have that by the grace
[43:59] of the Lord but Paul says what things he
[44:01] said those things you've seen in me what
[44:03] things the way Paul thought about true
[44:07] things the way he was truthful the way
[44:09] he was honest the way he was just and
[44:12] pure and lovely and a good report and
[44:15] virtuous and the praiseworthy things in
[44:17] Paul's life he said whatever you've seen
[44:20] about me heard about me that's these
[44:23] things he said do that praise God right
[44:27] right don't do the things that I do
[44:30] sinfully right don't don't mimic just my
[44:33] personality don't MIM don't mimic my
[44:36] human characteristics right and that's
[44:38] what that's what we've seen over these
[44:40] years since brother B left the message a
[44:42] lot of people try to wear you know they
[44:44] try to wear Eagle belt buckles like
[44:46] brother brandom or they they try to they
[44:49] try to hold their Bible just like
[44:50] brother brandom or they they're trying
[44:52] to impersonate brother Ram's physical
[44:54] attributes right they're trying to talk
[44:56] just just like brother Ram talked right
[44:59] they're trying to avoid uh maybe
[45:01] education or you know increasing their
[45:03] understanding uh just trying to
[45:05] physically be like him and they're
[45:07] trying to take brother Ram's human
[45:09] Spirit rather than the Holy Spirit
[45:11] that's right and the way you know is
[45:13] watch their life if their life gets more
[45:15] sinful they're trying to take brother
[45:16] Ram's human Spirit if their life gets
[45:18] more holy then they're trying to take
[45:20] the Holy Spirit praise
[45:22] God it's a great
[45:24] truth so Paul says those things which
[45:27] things the things that are pure and
[45:29] lovely all these things you've seen in
[45:31] my life he said do those
[45:33] things right uh because Peter could have
[45:36] said the same thing whatever you see in
[45:37] me do but does that mean we'd want to
[45:40] segregate and just have Jews and
[45:42] Gentiles no we don't want to imitate
[45:44] that right so so we understand that's
[45:47] what he's saying he he's not saying
[45:49] everything I do imitate that's not what
[45:51] he's say he said everything that's holy
[45:53] in my life everything you see Jesus do
[45:56] in my life that's what would you do
[45:58] praise God Amen
[46:01] Hallelujah so I just want to lay that in
[46:03] there I thought what what things what
[46:05] things is he talking about the things
[46:07] that are holy the things that bring
[46:09] God's peace
[46:11] amen when you see someone walking in
[46:13] peace that that's the peace you should
[46:15] have praise God right when when you see
[46:18] the peace of God flowing through other
[46:20] people's lives that's what you're
[46:21] supposed to imitate you know and that's
[46:24] what you kind of pick up in
[46:25] conversations with people you know like
[46:27] older ministers or maybe people like
[46:29] when somebody's on fire you know and you
[46:31] maybe you're not where you need to be
[46:33] right you just try to pick up and
[46:34] conversation well what you've been
[46:36] reading lately I don't know if you do it
[46:37] I do it you know what You' been reading
[46:39] what you've been listening to lately you
[46:41] know you try to pick up what's inspiring
[46:44] them
[46:45] amen because that's what Paul's saying
[46:48] these things that are in me the things
[46:49] that bring God's peace the things that
[46:51] bring God's power imitate that praise
[46:54] God or you have you see it all the time
[46:56] with preachers uh a preacher will catch
[46:58] inspiration and then that will inspire
[47:00] so many other preachers to keep studying
[47:02] and and preaching God's word you see all
[47:05] the
[47:06] time fact that's what's been going on
[47:07] for all these years we take one thought
[47:09] of brother Rand you can just run it all
[47:10] the way down through the Bible praise
[47:12] God that's what I've been doing in my
[47:13] whole Ministry praise God taking one
[47:15] little thought of brother RAM and seeing
[47:17] it go all the way down through the
[47:20] scripture see the things that we see we
[47:23] imitate that praise God
[47:28] all right now to me yeah all these eight
[47:31] things that you see Paul do or that you
[47:33] see men or women of God today do you
[47:36] want to imitate those
[47:38] things now remember most of the
[47:41] Philippians would have only heard of
[47:42] Paul's character because it would been
[47:44] 11 years since he visited remember so
[47:46] most of them just would have heard wow
[47:47] that's what a prophet of God lived like
[47:50] wow and that's what we do too when we
[47:52] listen to brother R Tes oh we hear
[47:54] that's what a prophet of God did that's
[47:56] how a prophet handled his finances or
[47:58] that's how a prophet you know corrected
[48:00] his children that's how a prophet dealt
[48:02] with
[48:03] teenagers that's coming up in my life
[48:05] right I got two of them right now I need
[48:07] to go play those tapes
[48:09] again I mean I might uh but you see how
[48:14] did Brother Bram handle it and you look
[48:15] and see uh and you try to gain wisdom
[48:18] and understanding from that example
[48:21] because that's what they did all these
[48:23] people had testimonies well Paul told me
[48:25] this or Paul prayed for me here or Paul
[48:27] did this Ah that's right I hear about
[48:29] what God did there oh so that's how I'm
[48:31] directing my life as
[48:34] well like I've seen people take it this
[48:36] far uh they said one time brother
[48:38] brandom uh was at somebody's house I
[48:40] think brother Wood's house I I can't
[48:42] remember the testimony and the the
[48:44] brother had a Bible laying there and the
[48:45] brother in his own house put brother
[48:47] bram's book on top of his Bible and
[48:50] brother Bram said no he said you don't
[48:51] put anything on top of the Bible now
[48:54] that that that's not a legalistic thing
[48:56] like if you ever stack something on your
[48:58] Bible you're backsliding you know but
[49:00] it's just an example of just just an
[49:02] idea of how we need to subconsciously
[49:05] honor the word of God now I thought the
[49:08] other way too the Bible's our foundation
[49:10] stone so if you're GNA Place anything on
[49:12] the Bible that's a pretty good idea too
[49:15] right because heaven and Earth shall
[49:16] pass away but my word will never pass
[49:19] away so see could go either
[49:22] way right it really could because the
[49:25] Bible's my Foundation what's your
[49:26] foundation
[49:28] my Foundation is the word of God there
[49:29] is no firmer Foundation than God's holy
[49:32] word so see just things so in other
[49:35] words in other words just find a way to
[49:37] reverence God in your home when you hear
[49:40] these things try to reverence it like
[49:43] the one time brother Jose and I were
[49:44] talking about brother Rams remember the
[49:46] three lights to know that you're in the
[49:47] will of God remember that we talked
[49:49] about that a few months ago that's a
[49:50] great suggestion you've heard brother
[49:52] Ram talk about that he told that to
[49:54] Perry green and so then we can try to
[49:56] apply that same thing to our lives it'll
[49:59] never disagree with the God's word it
[50:01] always uh uh be in the timing of God
[50:04] right and then the third thing you'll be
[50:06] able to do it you got to line up those
[50:08] three so see we hear these things but we
[50:11] got to make sure we do them and not just
[50:13] hear them how many here to do the word
[50:15] of God today amen not just here I just
[50:18] don't want to hear word I want to go out
[50:20] and do what I've heard
[50:23] amen see so we take the same idea not
[50:26] not everything that we hear like brother
[50:29] Ram like I've heard brother Ram let
[50:31] Joseph have a TV Joseph even said it
[50:33] I've heard Joseph say it brother Ram let
[50:35] Joseph have a TV out in Arizona because
[50:37] they were renting that house and it was
[50:39] the landlord's house so brother Ram
[50:41] didn't get rid of the TV now for me I
[50:43] won't let my kids have a TV but the same
[50:45] thing is they got tablets it's pretty
[50:47] close it's basically the same thing
[50:49] right so we got to be careful and say
[50:51] well no tablets here or only these apps
[50:53] and you got to control it praise God so
[50:56] see you got to have wisdom I don't know
[50:58] what was going through that TV I don't
[50:59] know uh I hope nothing bad you know so
[51:03] and we know brother BR put up a
[51:04] Christmas tree now for me I don't I I
[51:06] can't put up a Christmas tree okay
[51:07] because how I was raised but if you can
[51:09] do it and praise the Lord then
[51:11] hallelujah it's your Christian Liberty
[51:13] to do those things the main thing is
[51:15] always draw closer to Christ amen
[51:18] remember areas of Christian Liberty they
[51:19] will never impact you one way or the
[51:21] other as long as you're sincere because
[51:23] to the pure all things are pure
[51:26] right like if you reverence April 6
[51:29] brother's birthday if you say that's
[51:30] like that's a holiday for me well then
[51:32] praise the Lord you know fast and pray
[51:33] and you know get closer to God but you
[51:35] know that that's fine that's your
[51:36] Christian Liberty to do that you know uh
[51:41] so I just you know you wna you just want
[51:43] to uh have the right Spirit about you
[51:46] right not not not not try to be better
[51:48] than people not trying to fuss with
[51:50] people but make sure the peace of God
[51:53] that you're living with can flow out to
[51:54] other people praise God
[51:58] see we've only heard of brother Ram's
[52:00] character from Witnesses and we hear it
[52:01] on
[52:02] tape now this is like this one this one
[52:05] is so personal to me like the character
[52:07] to leave everything you've ever loved to
[52:09] do the will of God so in 1963 remember
[52:11] brother Ram uh left Jeffersonville right
[52:15] and moved out to Arizona so he's out
[52:18] there 63 64 so three years he was out
[52:21] there and only got one invitation to
[52:23] preach can you imagine he's a worldwide
[52:26] renowned preacher he only gets one
[52:27] invitation to preach out there but see
[52:30] he was able to leave everything in order
[52:33] to do the will of God Amen and that's
[52:36] something we hear on tape and that's
[52:37] something we should apply to our lives
[52:39] no matter what the word of no matter
[52:41] what our desires are we must obey the
[52:44] word of God and do what God's calling us
[52:46] to
[52:47] do okay just like he said he said now
[52:50] he's talking about Moses and Paul going
[52:53] to have to the having to go to the
[52:54] Wilderness to write the Bible
[52:57] he said and the New Testament writer was
[52:59] drove by the author into the desert
[53:00] place to get the inspiration to write
[53:02] the New Testament and the books are seal
[53:04] with Seven Seals it would also require
[53:06] the same I believe in the last days to
[53:08] open these Seven Seals so if the writers
[53:11] of the Old and New Testament had to go
[53:13] the desert to get the Revelation but
[53:15] then God sealed it with Seven Seals the
[53:17] one who's going to uh tell the
[53:19] revelation of it has to go to the desert
[53:20] as well to loose the Seven Seals praise
[53:23] God right they wrote it but but the
[53:26] Bible was written but then spiritually
[53:28] it had Seven Seals not physically church
[53:30] this this physically didn't have seven
[53:32] seals on it it was always open but the
[53:35] spiritual understanding of it a man had
[53:37] to consecrate himself and get along with
[53:39] God Amen and by doing that God could
[53:41] loose the seven mysterious Seven Seals
[53:44] and now the Bible makes sense to us and
[53:46] now the Bible can be
[53:49] lived because there was so much
[53:50] confusion for all those Church ages
[53:53] right for six Church ages there was
[53:55] confusion
[53:57] in fact did you realize church only the
[53:59] first and last Church age have the right
[54:01] understanding of the
[54:03] godhead because tertullian he was a real
[54:05] saint but he was in the second Church AG
[54:08] him he cast out Devils he raised the
[54:09] dead but he's the one that coined the
[54:12] word Trinity but he was a real godly man
[54:15] I read about his life this summer I put
[54:17] I'm putting in the next book what a man
[54:19] of God but that was the second Church
[54:21] age and the Bible said remember in the
[54:23] first church age don't lose your first
[54:25] love
[54:27] right and so the church begin to
[54:28] Backside a little bit losing losing
[54:30] losing it was all God part of God's plan
[54:33] that seed that plant had to die and that
[54:36] seed had to be planted again and it had
[54:38] to it had to die in order to bring new
[54:41] life praise God that's God's plan for
[54:44] the church age it's a bride tree praise
[54:46] God it's a tree amen right but then you
[54:51] know the the second third fourth fifth
[54:53] sixth all these other Church agents h no
[54:56] three persons until the last amen praise
[55:00] God see and Jesus is Alpha and Omega
[55:03] praise God first and last the first
[55:05] church agent the last Church agents are
[55:07] the only ones who know God's true
[55:09] personality that he's one person amen oh
[55:13] my what a beautiful thing he said to
[55:15] leave what you hold dear to what you
[55:18] cherish and the little home that was
[55:19] given me by the people remember brother
[55:20] R left that home Joseph lives in it
[55:22] today we drove by it took pictures of it
[55:25] uh churches has donated thousands of
[55:27] dollars to build that home just for
[55:29] brother brandham and
[55:31] ma and brother Bram said I had to leave
[55:33] the home the people bought me to do the
[55:36] will of
[55:38] God how many ever been given a home out
[55:40] there anybody ever been given a home no
[55:42] mortgage oh that would been a great
[55:44] blessing huh missed out on that blessing
[55:47] no no no because God has a season a time
[55:50] for it praise God he left that house
[55:53] that he cherished a little home given me
[55:55] by the people and amongst my people and
[55:57] friends and a church that was
[55:58] flourishing as far as remember this is
[56:00] right this is right before the seals I
[56:02] mean they have so many people there uh
[56:04] all the people like brother Neville's
[56:05] daughter you can watch it on YouTube
[56:07] they said you had to get there at least
[56:09] two hours early just to get a seat but
[56:12] we can slip in here two minutes early
[56:14] and get a
[56:15] seat right what a difference what a
[56:18] difference two hours they had to stand
[56:20] in lines brother Neville's daughter you
[56:21] can listen to it he she talks to Lonnie
[56:24] Jenkins and then the kids had to sit up
[56:27] here right on and you there's pictures
[56:28] of it they had to sit right up here and
[56:30] all the adults out there and they were
[56:32] just you know how they were more be they
[56:34] better better behaved back then right
[56:36] before all this ADHD and tablets and TV
[56:38] thing slipped in there right all this
[56:40] GMO or yeah all this GMO food messing up
[56:43] your body sugar addicts and everything
[56:45] like that I eat every day it's so awful
[56:47] my these kids got these kids got
[56:48] learning problems and alls their lunches
[56:50] are are
[56:51] muffins uh sugar drinks Kool-Aid
[56:57] brownies and they wonder why they got
[57:00] problems my goodness it's just so
[57:03] sad it was flourishing I mean there's
[57:05] just people flacking in and just they
[57:07] had to expand it remember they had to
[57:09] expand the Tabernacle in order to build
[57:12] it and God so he looked down and say oh
[57:15] I'm getting blessed on my church souls
[57:17] are getting saved they baptized a 100
[57:18] people in the seals remember that
[57:19] brother Jose over 100 people they
[57:21] baptized new
[57:22] converts and God said time to leave oh
[57:26] it's in the middle of
[57:28] growing oh it's flourishing oh we're
[57:30] putting forth our buds time to leave I
[57:32] got a different calling for you but said
[57:35] I wasn't called to be a pastor because I
[57:36] got a rambling
[57:39] Spirit right now I hope I don't ramble
[57:41] on about things right I hope I don't
[57:43] have a rambling spirit that way but I
[57:44] know I don't have a rambling Spirit to
[57:46] leave I like I like being home I like
[57:47] fixing up our home I like staying in one
[57:49] spot I like my drive to church yeah I
[57:51] like it it's it's fine with
[57:54] me I mean I want to do missionary work
[57:56] eventually but I like my life I enjoy it
[57:59] I can stay right here people come people
[58:01] go love everybody you know try to help
[58:03] people love people do all you can do
[58:06] brother said I didn't have the pastor
[58:08] spirit I had a missionary
[58:11] Spirit praise God Amen he said nothing
[58:15] lacking to leave that to pull away from
[58:17] it and move away into a desert where you
[58:19] knew nobody and everything against you
[58:22] so everything was open arms in
[58:24] Jeffersonville oh brother yes yeah
[58:26] brother let's have all kinds of meetings
[58:28] right out in Arizona all closed
[58:32] doors he goes on to say but there's
[58:34] something about God that he drives a man
[58:36] to do things Beyond any thinking of his
[58:39] own so it can be for the glory and honor
[58:42] of
[58:44] God and I feel that not self honor I
[58:47] feel a privilege that was to leave to
[58:49] everything that was called dear to me to
[58:50] get here in this Wilderness and S suffer
[58:52] like I've never suffered in my life here
[58:55] in the wilderness
[58:56] or this desert but I believe that in
[58:58] doing that and obeying what God
[59:00] commanded to be done God has opened to
[59:01] us the mysteries of the last day and we
[59:04] are here with this
[59:06] message if we had not left we wouldn't
[59:09] have the revelations that we have today
[59:11] praise God in other words we wouldn't
[59:13] enjoy the blessings of God we'd be
[59:15] living a denominational life if he had
[59:17] not left his home right and everything
[59:20] comfortable and all the riches and you
[59:22] know just all the blessings if he had
[59:24] not forsaken the blessings we wouldn't
[59:26] have the blessings what a lesson for us
[59:28] God help us to sacrifice today that
[59:31] others might experience the blessings of
[59:33] God what a lesson he left a flourishing
[59:36] church and flourishing all didn't lack
[59:39] anything everything I needs there to got
[59:41] to the place where he's all alone many
[59:44] times God will do that to you gotta get
[59:45] you alone praise God so you can hear the
[59:48] voice of God how many appreciate that
[59:50] there's so many voices out there God has
[59:52] to get us alone so we can hear one voice
[59:55] the Holy Spirit
[59:57] you of course through the five-fold
[59:59] ministry now this is a different message
[1:00:01] a
[1:00:02] prisoner he said just like Paul both of
[1:00:04] them trained he said Moses and Paul were
[1:00:06] trained the same
[1:00:07] way you you know to deliver the children
[1:00:09] of Israel by military might Paul trained
[1:00:11] to take them out of the hands of the
[1:00:13] Romans and put uh put them free by his
[1:00:16] great ecclesiastical force in the world
[1:00:18] that day great schools of training come
[1:00:20] up under gamea and both of them went
[1:00:22] into the desert come back different men
[1:00:24] both of them saw the pillar of fire and
[1:00:27] both of them were prophets is that right
[1:00:30] both of them prophets and they was both
[1:00:31] talked to by the pillar of fire exactly
[1:00:33] right coming for a deliverer there they
[1:00:36] was went in the desert left their homes
[1:00:38] and went to the desert to find out left
[1:00:40] their people and everything to find the
[1:00:42] will of God Amen what are we willing to
[1:00:46] do to find the will of God we must be
[1:00:48] willing to forsake everything amen
[1:00:51] that's the only way to find the will of
[1:00:52] God he said because he said if you want
[1:00:55] to save your life you got to lose
[1:00:57] it he said to find your life to save
[1:01:01] your life you got to find it praise God
[1:01:02] right you got to lose your life in order
[1:01:04] to find eternal life praise God and it
[1:01:06] may be contrary to all you've ever
[1:01:11] thought this is scripture Paul's saying
[1:01:13] these things you've seen in me do that
[1:01:16] in other words be willing to lose
[1:01:18] everything in order to find the perfect
[1:01:19] will of
[1:01:22] God he said they were trained in one way
[1:01:24] God changed it trained them to another
[1:01:25] another they had to become a complete
[1:01:28] prisoner to not act in the way that they
[1:01:30] wanted to act but act in the way that
[1:01:32] God wanted them to act he's the same
[1:01:34] yesterday today and forever how many
[1:01:36] think God's going to have to do uh make
[1:01:37] us prisoners in order to go in the
[1:01:39] Rapture yeah we have to go through maybe
[1:01:42] tougher times we have to learn to maybe
[1:01:45] sacrifice some more in order to be fully
[1:01:48] prisoners fully obedient to do the will
[1:01:50] of God hallelujah amen God's going have
[1:01:55] to take us
[1:01:57] out of what we think and he's going to
[1:01:58] have to place us into his perfect
[1:02:01] will we're going have to deal with some
[1:02:03] squeezing right we have to deal with a
[1:02:05] little bit of squeeze a little bit of
[1:02:06] pressure we all feel it at times but
[1:02:09] we're have to go through the pressure in
[1:02:11] order for God to get out of got get out
[1:02:13] of our Lives what he wants to get out of
[1:02:15] our
[1:02:18] Lives now Paul says here verse 10 let's
[1:02:21] move on here to this thought I got 20
[1:02:23] minutes on this little F first portion
[1:02:25] here
[1:02:27] so I'm going to preach a double header
[1:02:28] this morning praise God he said verse 10
[1:02:31] but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that
[1:02:33] now at the last your care of me hath
[1:02:35] flourished
[1:02:37] again wherein ye were also careful but
[1:02:40] you lacked
[1:02:42] opportunity now here is my thoughts on
[1:02:45] this the Philippians had at least twice
[1:02:47] given to Paul his Necessities previously
[1:02:51] recorded in 2 Corinthians 8 and N9 and
[1:02:54] Philippians 2
[1:02:56] 25 through3 so while we're in
[1:02:58] Philippians let's go to Philippians 2:25
[1:03:00] let's read about that so Paul's uh
[1:03:03] needed things on numerous occasions and
[1:03:07] they' they've sent word now can you
[1:03:08] imagine that think of the miles and the
[1:03:10] boat travels Church think about the
[1:03:12] travels oh Paul's in a Roman prison now
[1:03:16] Rome's far away from that right Rome's
[1:03:18] far away from uh Philippi right it's far
[1:03:22] it's a quite a d it's quite quite a
[1:03:24] travel but they hear about it after all
[1:03:28] these we'd say weeks let's say weeks of
[1:03:30] traveling right weeks of traveling the
[1:03:31] news finally gets there we get we get
[1:03:33] news in a matter of seconds but theirs
[1:03:35] takes weeks and then they hear about it
[1:03:37] now look how look how God was making
[1:03:39] Paul patient he had to wait weeks and
[1:03:41] months to get what he
[1:03:42] needed weeks and months and we get upset
[1:03:45] if we don't get an email reply after a
[1:03:47] few minutes
[1:03:49] right he would have to wait months and
[1:03:52] weeks in order to get the food or the
[1:03:55] the the Garment or the clothing or the
[1:03:56] parchments that he wanted right so they
[1:03:59] they' relay it they'd have Messengers go
[1:04:01] and then have to wait months and and get
[1:04:03] get whatever needed and then send it
[1:04:08] back so Philippians 2
[1:04:12] 25-30 dear Jesus make us more patient
[1:04:15] praise God Amen make us more
[1:04:19] patient yet I suppose it necessary to
[1:04:22] send to you epaphroditus my brother and
[1:04:25] companion in labor and fellow Soldier
[1:04:27] but your messenger so see this edtis he
[1:04:30] was the messenger he was the go between
[1:04:32] man between the church and the prophet
[1:04:36] praise God and he that ministered to my
[1:04:41] ones okay verse 26 for he longed after
[1:04:44] you all and was full of heaviness
[1:04:46] because that ye had heard that he had
[1:04:48] been sick for indeed he was sick nigh
[1:04:50] unto death but Paul I'm sorry but God
[1:04:52] had mercy on him and not on him only but
[1:04:54] on me also l I should have sorrow upon
[1:04:57] sorrow I sent him therefore the more
[1:04:58] carefully that when you see him again
[1:05:01] you may Rejoice that I may be the less
[1:05:05] sorrowful
[1:05:06] wow so Paul was going to be happy once
[1:05:09] they saw epicodus his messenger so Paul
[1:05:13] said just pray for him and just wait to
[1:05:15] receive epitus he he remember oh my can
[1:05:17] you imagine that edtis was carrying the
[1:05:19] message of the hour he was carrying this
[1:05:22] book of the Philippians amen he carried
[1:05:24] the Scrolls and the parts
[1:05:26] oh he had treasure and vessels praise
[1:05:28] God right because they packed him in
[1:05:29] vessels and there epaphroditus is
[1:05:31] carrying the vessel that had the word it
[1:05:34] had thus say the Lord in it and church
[1:05:36] you and I are the vessels today we've
[1:05:38] got treasure in our Earth and vessels
[1:05:40] amen and we're just not packing the
[1:05:43] message the message is in US amen
[1:05:46] hallelujah there he was packing the
[1:05:47] message of the hour oh my we do the same
[1:05:50] thing with the word of God today don't
[1:05:51] we we pack the word of God we carry the
[1:05:54] word of God and that's what eper frodus
[1:05:56] was
[1:06:01] doing so again so one time with eper
[1:06:03] Fortis he helped now let's look at
[1:06:06] Second Corinthians you don't have to
[1:06:07] turn there because I just put a few up
[1:06:10] here now look at
[1:06:13] Paul right he's writing to the the city
[1:06:15] of Corinth now the church in Corinth
[1:06:18] he's saying more brethren we do you to
[1:06:20] wit of the grace of God bestowed on the
[1:06:23] churches of Macedonia
[1:06:26] he Saidi like to tell you about the
[1:06:28] grace of God everybody say
[1:06:31] grace Paul's bragging about not I should
[1:06:34] say bragging but Paul's trying to point
[1:06:36] out to these Corinthians that the the
[1:06:39] the Saints in Macedonia have great grace
[1:06:42] upon
[1:06:43] them in other words he's trying to say
[1:06:45] look at this church you can learn
[1:06:47] something from this church right and we
[1:06:49] should be open to that too I want to
[1:06:51] learn I learn from cam Church often when
[1:06:53] I go there I oh I like how they do this
[1:06:55] and I like that my goodness right we
[1:06:58] want to learn from other
[1:07:01] churches now the Macedonian churches
[1:07:04] remember it's that whole area I got a
[1:07:05] few uh I got a few Maps let me show you
[1:07:07] some maps
[1:07:09] here okay so everybody can see this
[1:07:11] here's uh where's there's Jerusalem
[1:07:13] right so there's Israel Macedonia is
[1:07:15] that whole area where there's Berea
[1:07:17] thessalonica
[1:07:19] Philippi there's thyro tus there's Corin
[1:07:22] so think about remember he was in the uh
[1:07:25] yeah there's there's Corinth he's
[1:07:26] writing to the Saints of Corinth and
[1:07:27] there's
[1:07:29] Philippi I was looking for Rome am I
[1:07:31] missing Rome is it further west yeah
[1:07:34] sorry because it's the boot right that's
[1:07:35] where Italy's the
[1:07:36] boot so what a trip I mean if the boots
[1:07:39] way over here think about the trip to
[1:07:41] get the Philippi and send the messenger
[1:07:42] back that's quite a
[1:07:44] journey right without uh without your
[1:07:47] new Nissan right or your new uh
[1:07:50] Chevrolet right no air travel right no
[1:07:54] United Airlines back in those days they
[1:07:57] were men of God soldiers now I'm going
[1:08:00] to go
[1:08:01] back so Paul's saying I like to tell you
[1:08:05] about the grace of God that these
[1:08:07] churches in Macedonia have received
[1:08:10] verse two how that in great trial
[1:08:12] Affliction the abundance of their joy
[1:08:14] and their deep poverty abounded unto the
[1:08:17] riches of their liberality and other
[1:08:19] words their Hard Times their very hard
[1:08:22] times cause them to be more generous oh
[1:08:25] God
[1:08:26] our hard times I hope they make us more
[1:08:29] generous I hope they make us more giving
[1:08:32] especially to the Saints the Bible said
[1:08:34] especially when you see the Saints in
[1:08:35] the house of God uh do good to those
[1:08:38] especially those in
[1:08:40] church see Hard Times shouldn't make us
[1:08:43] bitter hard times should make us better
[1:08:46] better Christians right I took that line
[1:08:48] from TD Jake I heard him say that one
[1:08:49] time he said you don't you don't make
[1:08:51] you bitter they're supposed to make you
[1:08:53] better right in other words more holy
[1:08:55] praise God I don't know if that's what
[1:08:57] he was talking about but that's what I'm
[1:08:58] talking about they make us better
[1:09:00] servants right more humble
[1:09:04] Christians see so we can't say things
[1:09:06] are so hard I can't help anybody no we
[1:09:08] should say things are hard on me but I
[1:09:10] want to have Grace and I want to help
[1:09:11] other
[1:09:14] people because church is going to come
[1:09:17] down to this it's really not you and I
[1:09:19] doing it it's the Holy Spirit doing it
[1:09:21] in
[1:09:22] us if you can't do something and you
[1:09:25] know it's right you know what we need to
[1:09:26] pray give me more
[1:09:29] grace cuz Paul says it's the grace what
[1:09:33] allow these Philippian Saints to be so
[1:09:36] generous in the midst of their trials
[1:09:39] Paul says there are great afflictions
[1:09:41] you know being arrested and beaten the
[1:09:43] Bible said they were beaten on the house
[1:09:44] of Jason they were beaten on the house
[1:09:46] and say bring it out here bring them out
[1:09:48] here when was the last time somebody
[1:09:49] beat down your door for being a
[1:09:50] Christian it never happened to
[1:09:52] me they'll beat down my cell phone with
[1:09:55] evil text that's about it right or evil
[1:09:57] comments on YouTube that's about all
[1:09:59] they'll do to me but see their trials
[1:10:03] made them care and want to help out for
[1:10:05] the churches
[1:10:07] amen see they they knew they knew what
[1:10:10] it's like to suffer so they want to help
[1:10:12] people that are
[1:10:14] suffering praise
[1:10:18] God so Paul's saying now listen churches
[1:10:21] in Corinth you really need to see what
[1:10:23] Grace produces in someone's life
[1:10:26] look what it will produce it will
[1:10:28] produce a generous
[1:10:30] person everybody still believe this is
[1:10:32] thus sayith the Lord Philippians chapter
[1:10:34] 4 everybody everybody still believe that
[1:10:36] every everybody believe it still applies
[1:10:38] to us
[1:10:39] today every everybody believe we should
[1:10:41] still read it absolutely praise God
[1:10:45] absolutely because this is a day where
[1:10:47] we're rich and increased with goods and
[1:10:49] have need of nothing it's a selfish age
[1:10:51] so we need to be
[1:10:53] selfless like we saw last week I don't
[1:10:55] know brother John if you saw that
[1:10:56] message last week but my that was the
[1:10:58] Holy Spirit job was a basically a leot
[1:11:01] toan Believer he was rich and increased
[1:11:03] with Goods he said I'm at ease I don't
[1:11:05] have need of nothing and he said the
[1:11:08] Bible says that's why he had that was
[1:11:09] one reason why he had that great trial
[1:11:12] and look what it produced It produced
[1:11:13] more humility It produced repentance
[1:11:16] right amen It produced he was able to
[1:11:18] grow he was able to learn praise God
[1:11:22] through his trials
[1:11:25] now remember Philippi is the modern city
[1:11:27] Modern Day city of Greece it was this
[1:11:29] it's the second most populous area in
[1:11:31] Greece today so there's a modern picture
[1:11:33] from my iPhone right so there's Greece
[1:11:35] and there's Philippi so spelled a little
[1:11:37] differently there's
[1:11:39] thessalonica all those there's Athens
[1:11:41] yeah Paul preached down in Athens
[1:11:42] remember that Mars Hill acts
[1:11:45] 17 now remember Paul started this church
[1:11:48] by the vision remember he's sleeping and
[1:11:50] he sees a man from Macedonia say come
[1:11:52] and Minister he wanted to go to Asia but
[1:11:54] the holy spirit said don't go to Asia go
[1:11:56] to
[1:11:57] Macedonia now they hadn't heard the
[1:12:00] word so God has to send the man the
[1:12:02] prophet a vision go to these people and
[1:12:05] what are they going to become they're
[1:12:06] going to become the some of the most
[1:12:08] generous Christians the world has ever
[1:12:09] seen praise God Amen they never heard
[1:12:13] the gospel but God said all they need to
[1:12:15] do here is the grace of Jesus Christ and
[1:12:18] it will produce in them such a character
[1:12:20] that the next 2,000 years of church ages
[1:12:23] will hear preaching about such generous
[1:12:25] Christians in the midst of suffering
[1:12:27] they can be generous in the midst of
[1:12:29] trials they can think about other people
[1:12:31] instead of thinking about themselves
[1:12:34] praise God and God directed The Prophet
[1:12:38] messenger of that day to change his
[1:12:40] missionary
[1:12:42] plans don't go to Asia go to
[1:12:46] Macedonia go to these lost souls over
[1:12:48] here because really they're my
[1:12:51] children I've got children over there
[1:12:53] you need to go do missionary work over
[1:12:54] there
[1:12:56] and they're going to be some of the most
[1:12:57] generous people that you've ever met the
[1:13:00] grace of God upon their lives oh what's
[1:13:03] Grace unmar favor God's favor on you
[1:13:07] just because he's good amen oh the
[1:13:10] goodness of God Amen resting upon
[1:13:14] us hallelujah oh thankful for God's
[1:13:17] grace in my life
[1:13:18] amen oh thank you
[1:13:21] Jesus now there's another picture of it
[1:13:24] where you see this is the Macedonia area
[1:13:26] there's Berea remember the bans they
[1:13:28] were more noble than those of
[1:13:30] thessalonica because they searched the
[1:13:32] Scriptures Daily whether those things
[1:13:34] were so what Paul said you want to be
[1:13:36] Noble remember we looked at that a few
[1:13:37] months ago read your Bible study your
[1:13:39] Bible every day praise God you want to
[1:13:42] be a king and priest study the word
[1:13:44] search the scriptures find the will of
[1:13:46] God Amen never get satisfied with your
[1:13:49] knowledge of God keep seeking after God
[1:13:51] you'll be a king and priest un
[1:13:53] God see Paul could tell there's
[1:13:55] different cities different churches had
[1:13:57] different reactions to the word of
[1:13:59] God now no church was perfect right no
[1:14:03] church was perfect because even the
[1:14:04] Ephesus Church had said some things they
[1:14:06] need to
[1:14:07] correct right children obey your parents
[1:14:10] this is how marriage works and he laid
[1:14:11] out all these things stay in the spirit
[1:14:13] sing it sing hymns all the time stay in
[1:14:15] the spirit don't be foolish do the will
[1:14:17] of God be wise redeem the time right
[1:14:20] they they needed correction on things
[1:14:26] now look at this this is beautiful Paul
[1:14:27] magnifies I got eight minutes so bear
[1:14:29] with me here before we we transition a
[1:14:30] little bit Paul magnifies the grace of
[1:14:33] God
[1:14:37] forgiving giving is an area that Grace
[1:14:41] helps us grow in as well as Faith
[1:14:45] knowledge and Etc how many would say
[1:14:47] they want more faith I think everybody
[1:14:49] would raise their hand and say yeah I
[1:14:51] want more Revelation right well what's
[1:14:54] going to give that to you
[1:14:55] Grace God's favor so you humble yourself
[1:14:58] you repent you live you trust in God's
[1:15:00] grace trust in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:15:02] well the grace of God will give you more
[1:15:05] faith
[1:15:06] right well not only that but look what
[1:15:09] Paul says more of her Brethren that to
[1:15:11] it the grace of God bestowed on the
[1:15:12] churches of Macedonia look what he says
[1:15:14] in verse 7even therefore now look the
[1:15:16] Corinthians are abounding right now like
[1:15:19] their church when Paul writes it they're
[1:15:20] abounding in gifts right the Bible said
[1:15:23] they're growing in faith utterance and
[1:15:25] knowledge and all diligence and in love
[1:15:28] to us see that you abound in this Grace
[1:15:31] also if you read chapter 8 Paul rebukes
[1:15:35] the Corinthians because they're growing
[1:15:37] in all these other gifts and knowledge
[1:15:39] but they're not growing in being
[1:15:42] generous praise the
[1:15:45] Lord this must be a deep message or
[1:15:47] something like
[1:15:49] that see they're growing spiritually
[1:15:52] their faith is well they want to see
[1:15:54] more gifts come to church and they pray
[1:15:55] for gifts every service but Paul says
[1:15:57] you need to grow in the grace of giving
[1:15:59] as well like those churches at Macedonia
[1:16:03] so see how every Church you're never
[1:16:05] going to find a perfect church right and
[1:16:07] the church said unless you're talking
[1:16:08] about the blood now that's different
[1:16:11] we're talking about remember you're
[1:16:12] perfect in heaven but you're imperfect
[1:16:13] on Earth you're never going to find a
[1:16:15] perfect Church on this Earth as far as
[1:16:17] everything they do is
[1:16:18] perfect but everyone is perfect in
[1:16:22] heaven
[1:16:23] Hallelujah see Paul looked at the
[1:16:25] churches he said I'm a prophet uh wow
[1:16:28] the cor the Corinthians they got some
[1:16:29] good gifts and they're really grown
[1:16:30] there but these Macedonian churches up
[1:16:33] north they really got the grace to
[1:16:37] give and see you guys could learn a
[1:16:39] lesson from
[1:16:41] them right like I remember years ago I
[1:16:43] learned that great lesson from Albi and
[1:16:44] how my wife was exped and they sent a
[1:16:47] truckload Andy and Eileen brought over a
[1:16:49] truckload I mean the whole back of the
[1:16:51] truck was full of frozen food so some of
[1:16:53] you probably sent it to us thank you
[1:16:55] you we were so I I was crying I was just
[1:16:58] I was blown away and we had just enough
[1:17:01] room in our both of our freezers to fit
[1:17:03] all that food in there and we had to
[1:17:05] leave some out in order to eat that
[1:17:08] night I thought wow I learned something
[1:17:10] look at the
[1:17:11] generosity but you know like you know
[1:17:13] you go to albian church you're GNA find
[1:17:15] people make fall short of the glory
[1:17:17] right you're gonna come to akan you're
[1:17:19] going to find people that fall short of
[1:17:20] the glory of God ah my hand's one of
[1:17:23] them I'm not right but the blood of
[1:17:26] Jesus makes us perfect in heaven
[1:17:29] amen oh see I love this because Paul
[1:17:32] could look at the church in Cam's church
[1:17:34] and say they're doing some good things
[1:17:36] there now they could need some help
[1:17:38] here the same Holy Spirit look at our
[1:17:40] church and say they're doing some good
[1:17:41] things here but they could grow
[1:17:44] here if if the Saints in akan are
[1:17:47] willing to
[1:17:50] learn oh my praise the
[1:17:53] Lord Hallelujah
[1:17:57] church so what are you going to learn
[1:17:58] for
[1:17:59] 2021 well it's probably up to the Lord
[1:18:02] right what the Lord brings across the
[1:18:03] pulpit right that's probably what we're
[1:18:05] supposed to learn but of course we're
[1:18:07] supposed to learn in our daily prayer
[1:18:09] lives as well how many of you have come
[1:18:10] up in the last year come up for a closer
[1:18:12] walk with God that was your prayer
[1:18:15] request I've done it I asked for the
[1:18:18] Lord a few when Simon was here last time
[1:18:20] I asked Lord help me to be able to get
[1:18:21] up early and in most days I've seen that
[1:18:23] now a couple days I slept then I was
[1:18:25] kind of ashamed of myself but my body
[1:18:27] probably needed it but I wanted a
[1:18:29] rededication of having my my morning
[1:18:33] rededicated to God and God was gracious
[1:18:36] I feel like he's answered my
[1:18:39] request but see Paul saying what's going
[1:18:42] to do this is
[1:18:44] Grace in order to get Grace you got to
[1:18:46] repent right when you repent you're
[1:18:49] forgiven God's grace extends to you amen
[1:18:53] praise the Lord
[1:18:57] so church that's you know that's what
[1:18:59] the Holy Spirit would have us to know
[1:19:01] too if Paul could see churches have
[1:19:03] different strengths and different
[1:19:05] weaknesses and he could tell them that
[1:19:08] then we should be able to hear the the
[1:19:10] voice of the Holy Spirit to today saying
[1:19:12] you're doing good in these areas but you
[1:19:14] could need some more grace in another
[1:19:17] area praise God so again does anybody
[1:19:21] get any pats on the back because of
[1:19:22] anything we we've accomplished no all
[1:19:25] we've done is repented and then God
[1:19:27] gives us more grace remember Paul said
[1:19:30] Paul said I labored more abundantly he
[1:19:32] said not I but the grace of God that was
[1:19:36] with
[1:19:38] me it's what causes you to labor
[1:19:41] Grace Grace causes you to labor so see
[1:19:44] church just keep that in mind the
[1:19:45] Corinthians M they they were you could
[1:19:47] look at them and they always had more
[1:19:49] knowledge they always had more faith but
[1:19:52] when it came to pulling out their
[1:19:53] pockets and giving the
[1:19:55] people oh we say we call them today a
[1:19:58] little more frugal
[1:19:59] right boy they could really pray and M
[1:20:02] I'm learning new things and this is deep
[1:20:04] and wi praise the Lord I'm learning all
[1:20:06] about prophecy and all about tongues I'm
[1:20:08] learning all about knowledge and wisdom
[1:20:11] when it came to helping out the church
[1:20:12] down the
[1:20:13] street a let them do whatever they want
[1:20:16] you know ah you always have the poor
[1:20:19] with you why should you help him
[1:20:20] out goodness my goodness
[1:20:25] see every church when you go there
[1:20:26] you're going to find trouble you're
[1:20:28] going to find little things but Jesus if
[1:20:30] we accept Grace it'll bring us up above
[1:20:32] some of those things and churches you
[1:20:35] know coming down to the Rapture we're g
[1:20:37] to get anointing where ain't going to
[1:20:39] find too much sin in the church anymore
[1:20:42] praise God we're going back to the day
[1:20:43] of Pentecost amen amen we're going back
[1:20:46] to that we're going back to ananas and
[1:20:48] saf praise God we're going back to the
[1:20:50] restored
[1:20:52] church right where sin God amen God
[1:20:55] would even wouldn't even let sin get in
[1:20:57] the church amen Ah that's what we're
[1:20:59] going back to praise God what's going to
[1:21:01] do it your building no my ability no
[1:21:03] it's going to be Grace amen staying with
[1:21:07] God's word receiving his word repenting
[1:21:09] and Grace will bring these things that
[1:21:11] we
[1:21:12] need each one and all the message
[1:21:14] churches that really love the Lord that
[1:21:15] are born again they'll receive all the
[1:21:17] grace that they need in order to become
[1:21:19] what God has called them to
[1:21:23] be like got to tell you I was you know
[1:21:25] just trying to encourage brother amen I
[1:21:26] was trying to encourage the church you
[1:21:27] know pastors come from preachers come
[1:21:29] from different churches they say Ma you
[1:21:31] you're all abounding in
[1:21:33] music really right that they can tell
[1:21:36] we're growing in the freedom of worship
[1:21:39] I've had three I mean every guest every
[1:21:41] guest preacher that's come lately said
[1:21:42] that well thank God for the grace
[1:21:46] there now let's keep growing in that but
[1:21:49] what are some areas other areas of Grace
[1:21:51] we can grow in are we as generous as we
[1:21:54] need to be are we really do we see more
[1:21:56] faith in our lives where's the faith are
[1:21:57] we seeing more knowledge are we as
[1:21:59] diligent as we need to be or could we
[1:22:00] have some more grace
[1:22:02] there how about love how about utterance
[1:22:06] are we speaking the word of God like we
[1:22:08] ought to or could we use a little more
[1:22:09] grace there oh I could use some more
[1:22:13] grace there like utter it to my neighbor
[1:22:16] right or utter it to my coworker I could
[1:22:20] use some Grace there to utter it there's
[1:22:23] my 45 minutes here um let me finish this
[1:22:26] thought here that's what I my famous
[1:22:28] last word
[1:22:29] right yeah here's how you do it Church
[1:22:32] self sacrifice self-sacrifice is the
[1:22:34] only way to grow in God God's grace you
[1:22:36] got to repent amen because because Paul
[1:22:39] goes on to say this the Macedonian
[1:22:42] Saints did remember it was bereans
[1:22:44] Philippians Thessalonians they were so
[1:22:45] generous why not as we hope but first
[1:22:48] they gave theirselves to the Lord and
[1:22:51] then unto us by the will of God so
[1:22:54] before you can be used by God to bless
[1:22:57] people you first got to give yourself to
[1:22:59] God you got to say this is a season I'm
[1:23:02] G to devote myself to prayer this is a
[1:23:05] season I'm devote myself to just
[1:23:07] surrendering everything to God I'm gonna
[1:23:08] put everything else on hold and I'm just
[1:23:10] gonna seek God right now and see what he
[1:23:12] have me to do and then watch what he
[1:23:14] anoints you to
[1:23:15] do praise
[1:23:17] God you got to give yourself to God
[1:23:19] first right like Romans 12 put yourself
[1:23:21] on the
[1:23:23] altar right
[1:23:25] and then he'll transform your mind by
[1:23:28] the renewing of the holy
[1:23:30] spirit it's a beautiful Story I mean
[1:23:34] it's beautiful to see how the book of
[1:23:35] Philippians is tied in with all these
[1:23:37] other
[1:23:38] letters he's I never knew that he's
[1:23:41] bragging about the Philippians I didn't
[1:23:42] know Macedonia was you know pH Philippi
[1:23:45] thessalonica he's bragging on them
[1:23:47] because the but not really bragging on
[1:23:49] them he's bragging on the grace of God
[1:23:51] that's what I'm trying to say hallelujah
[1:23:54] the grace of God was so effective in
[1:23:56] their lives that Paul was telling other
[1:23:58] churches about the grace working in
[1:24:01] their
[1:24:02] lives praise God
[1:24:06] uh I'm G stop right
[1:24:09] there okay now I got a quote
[1:24:13] here everybody take a deep breath every
[1:24:16] can everybody take a deep breath God
[1:24:17] bless the live streamers have a great
[1:24:19] day by God's grace love the Lord with
