[0:06] isolation you know we'll look at Lord
[0:08] willing look at I kind of find three
[0:10] types of isolation in the scripture and
[0:12] uh
[0:13] uh I think we'll look at different ones
[0:15] I think they'll be very familiar you
[0:16] know as we look at them I trust to be a
[0:19] help and a blessing tonight let's read
[0:22] this one on Three this course the sinful
[0:23] one this is when we isolate ourselves
[0:25] you know through sin but let's read this
[0:27] on three one two three through desire a
[0:30] man having separated himself seeketh and
[0:35] inter-metalith with all wisdom of course
[0:38] this is a lustful desire if you look it
[0:40] up in the Hebrew and intermetalith means
[0:42] to fight against so fight against all
[0:44] wisdom like this kind of person you know
[0:46] Church we've all been there right we've
[0:48] all let's all say Amen can we
[0:50] sometimes when we're choosing to be
[0:52] isolated through our own sin the the
[0:54] wisdom is right there in front of us
[0:55] like we know what to do but we fight
[0:57] against it we disobey it anyway right I
[1:00] mean this is clear I think any all of us
[1:02] should be able to relate to this one
[1:03] here we know the right way but we fight
[1:05] again we resist the right way
[1:08] um but thank God there's Grace
[1:09] Hallelujah Luke 5 15 and 16. let's read
[1:12] that Luke 5 15 and 16.
[1:14] I'm going to try to watch the time I've
[1:16] been kind of battling the cold this week
[1:18] 60 kids were out in our school one day
[1:21] you know it's a flu is kind of going
[1:23] around so uh I hope you're eating a lot
[1:27] of vitamin C by God's grace so I've been
[1:29] chugging it this week by God's grace
[1:32] Luke 5 15 and 16.
[1:38] now here's the best kind of isolation
[1:40] praise God
[1:41] when you get along with Jesus Hallelujah
[1:44] of course Jesus models it by going along
[1:46] with the father
[1:47] I'm going to read 15 and then we'll read
[1:49] 16 together but so much the more went
[1:51] there a Fame abroad of him and great
[1:53] multitudes came together to hear and to
[1:56] be healed by him of their infirmities
[1:57] let's read this on three one two three
[1:59] and he withdrew himself into the
[2:02] Wilderness and prayed may God as a
[2:05] blessing to read his word you may be
[2:06] seated God bless you
[2:08] it's good to be back with you I surely
[2:09] missed you this weekend and but again
[2:12] thanks for recording that I appreciate
[2:13] that that was really great by the grace
[2:15] of God
[2:19] oh it's okay man that's okay that's all
[2:22] right God knows your heart right if you
[2:23] could stand you would stand God knows
[2:25] your heart appreciate that Chris of
[2:27] course you appreciate that
[2:29] yeah I definitely missed everybody and
[2:30] uh
[2:32] you know but I preached I was there I
[2:33] preached a message called um
[2:36] what was it uh yeah defending the gospel
[2:39] message and just showed how we're
[2:42] defending brother Bam's message and how
[2:44] we have to defend the message Paul
[2:46] defended the message and I showed I
[2:49] showed when you fight against the
[2:50] message you take evil spirits and of
[2:52] course I preached all that here before
[2:54] so like when when when they say oh it's
[2:57] okay to have women preachers they've
[2:58] taken a spirit of Jezebel The Jezebel
[3:00] spirit which is a dominating spirit
[3:03] right when they say uh God's three
[3:05] persons they take an idolatrous Spirit
[3:07] they become idolaters
[3:09] okay when they uh make lies about
[3:11] brother Graham they take a lying Spirit
[3:13] on them so I just showed I just showed
[3:16] seven simple examples Saints these
[3:18] people have seven demons on them if they
[3:20] you know if they that's at least seven
[3:22] demons
[3:23] that's just what they admit right but by
[3:27] God's grace we're free Hallelujah we we
[3:30] can live free he whom Jesus has set free
[3:32] is free indeed I come here tonight I'm
[3:34] free in Jesus name
[3:36] I don't care if there's only two people
[3:38] here if I'm free Hallelujah then I'm
[3:40] happy praise God hallelujah that's what
[3:43] we really need we need freedom in the
[3:44] Holy Spirit praise God
[3:45] so uh yeah I try not to bring anything
[3:47] new when I go to churches you know of
[3:49] course and if I would I'd preach it
[3:50] right here oh yeah I do have some slides
[3:52] here by God's grace so the purpose you
[3:54] know is uh
[3:56] you know after I listen to brother
[3:57] amen's message and then after I was
[3:58] thinking about the number of people I
[4:00] prayed for at other churches I thought
[4:02] well it seems like a lot of people feel
[4:04] isolated
[4:05] and I thought well I can relate to that
[4:07] I mean we all can relate to that you
[4:09] know we feel isolated the enemy isolates
[4:11] us
[4:12] and I thought well I'd like to preach on
[4:14] that
[4:15] and uh
[4:17] it's been a while I think since I
[4:19] preached on it I mean when we preached
[4:20] the Mighty Man series you know I uh
[4:22] I looked at scriptures to help you
[4:24] overcome not feeling alone so that that
[4:26] would be something on the similar line
[4:27] so so four souls not not none in our
[4:30] assembly have recently confessed secret
[4:32] sins now as I shared sexual secret sins
[4:35] okay to me
[4:37] and three of them have reported Victory
[4:39] so I was really happy about that because
[4:40] I told them I said I said if you don't
[4:43] have an accountability partner you need
[4:44] to get an accountability partner I said
[4:47] if you do that on your phone you need to
[4:48] get rid of your phone I don't know they
[4:49] didn't tell me if they did that or not
[4:50] but if they are a slave to those things
[4:53] on the phone they need to be strong
[4:55] enough and get rid of that phone
[4:58] I don't care I need it for my job I need
[4:59] it for my job nonsense you need eternal
[5:01] life or a new job
[5:03] is that right
[5:04] what are you going to do well make an
[5:06] excuse on the day of judgment well lord
[5:08] it's okay I was allowed to do it because
[5:09] I had to have a job no God's Jehovah
[5:12] Jireh if you take a stand God will stand
[5:15] for you praise God hallelujah
[5:18] so I don't know how far they've gone but
[5:20] I know we should go to any lengths to
[5:23] please God how many believe that let's
[5:25] go to Every length we can to please the
[5:28] Lord Jesus Christ and so I felt inspired
[5:30] Again by Brother the amen or other amen
[5:32] had mentioned it kind of and I'll get to
[5:33] it a little bit but he kind of mentioned
[5:34] I think at the beginning of the message
[5:36] where he was saying sometimes we're
[5:37] afraid to uh show our real selves right
[5:40] sometimes we're afraid to
[5:43] let people know how we're doing right or
[5:46] maybe what I should say what we're
[5:47] struggling with right and that's true I
[5:50] mean that's no doubt true
[5:51] um you know some battles lost or some
[5:53] battles last longer than others
[5:56] praise God and you know so when you're
[5:59] going through a longer battle you know
[6:00] sometimes it's helpful to reach out to
[6:02] someone for prayer and I appreciate that
[6:04] testimony brother you know that's what
[6:06] he gave at the end there
[6:07] and I've had to do that too on numerous
[6:09] occasions you know so we'll look into
[6:10] that but that's kind of inspired me
[6:11] inspired me I was like oh that's a great
[6:13] point I like to like look at that a
[6:15] little bit by God's grace
[6:17] um so let's look at how Webster's
[6:18] Dictionary defined isolation I think
[6:21] it's funny you quarantine because of the
[6:22] covet you know
[6:24] quarantine sermon tonight
[6:27] uh it means to set apart from others or
[6:29] to quarantine so and of course we know
[6:32] during during that time I'd heard
[6:33] different preachers preach on the idea
[6:34] of quarantining you know a spiritual
[6:38] um
[6:39] but it's a reality you know like like
[6:40] this year we have you know the the class
[6:44] I have was the first class that didn't
[6:46] have any preschool
[6:48] and so this class is
[6:50] a tough class I'll just say it like that
[6:52] because I know some people may be
[6:54] listening this is a tough class I've
[6:56] never had a class like this in 19 years
[6:58] but see they were separated from
[7:01] learning they were separated from peers
[7:03] how many their parents do you think
[7:04] Faithfully taught them when there was no
[7:06] preschool
[7:07] how many things just sat him in front of
[7:09] uh screens probably a lot
[7:12] and of course I've talked to different
[7:14] people too they've seen it on other
[7:17] levels of Education
[7:18] different teachers I've talked to
[7:21] um
[7:22] that people are just different now
[7:24] they're just different
[7:26] because that two years if people took
[7:29] the wrong Spirit during that time they
[7:31] actually isolated themselves and really
[7:33] it was just really them and Satan right
[7:35] if they isolate themselves from friends
[7:37] and and lost out on a lot of those Ben
[7:39] those beneficial relationships it was
[7:41] just them and the devil and the Devil
[7:43] comes to kill you steal from you and
[7:45] destroy you
[7:46] so some of them went through two years
[7:48] of Destruction
[7:51] and breaking down of any love they felt
[7:54] uh any peace they had any enjoyment in
[7:57] life I mean remember the suicide rates
[7:59] were so high during covet
[8:01] it's because of isolation
[8:03] Satan was isolating them and separating
[8:07] them from others
[8:09] because it's just like it's just like
[8:10] the Bible says the church the body of
[8:13] Christ is a body and everyone needs the
[8:17] other one
[8:18] we all need each other I need you and
[8:21] you need me right as long as this is
[8:23] your home Church you know if it's not
[8:25] your own church then you don't need us
[8:26] right you you need your home Church
[8:29] it's just like a body same thing we see
[8:30] in the natural like everybody needs to
[8:32] belong to something
[8:34] yeah everybody needs to everybody gets
[8:36] inspired through other people but when
[8:38] they're quarantined or separate or
[8:40] isolated Satan just takes from them
[8:42] destroys them he breaks them down
[8:44] Satan's not building them up he's
[8:46] breaking them down
[8:48] Hallelujah but when you say attached to
[8:50] real Christians and positive people and
[8:52] and you know the the word of God you get
[8:55] built up praise God you don't get weaker
[8:57] you get stronger praise God
[9:00] and so isolate means to select from
[9:02] others I like this this is really good
[9:04] here for the spiritual part to separate
[9:06] from another substance has to obtain
[9:10] Pure or in a free state Hallelujah
[9:13] that's a good one that's what I like
[9:15] right there I was reading I'm like I was
[9:16] thinking I was thinking like all these
[9:18] isolation definitions going to be evil
[9:20] evil evil and the second one's good I'm
[9:21] like oh this is beautiful praise God
[9:23] so God like Barbara said God's God's a
[9:26] segregationist right God has to separate
[9:28] true from false amen good from Evil
[9:31] Hallelujah live from truth amen God has
[9:34] to always separate them Hallelujah he's
[9:37] a he's a separator right like oil and
[9:39] water don't mix amen right lies and
[9:41] Truth don't mix God has to separate them
[9:43] God has to isolate one from the other
[9:45] praise God hallelujah
[9:48] and so we see it in the scripture now
[9:49] there's there's likely more okay so it's
[9:51] a you know you know me uh I I I I don't
[9:54] know a whole lot but
[9:56] um I know there's at least three there's
[9:57] probably more than three
[9:59] but we're going to go through these
[10:00] through the order you know
[10:02] um
[10:03] I'm sorry just a little tight
[10:06] first we can be isolated by our own
[10:09] sinful choosing our own sin isolates us
[10:12] from God
[10:13] as far as his anointing his influence
[10:17] we're never forsaken by God sinner or
[10:19] Saint right you know I mean God is
[10:21] merciful God's gracious
[10:23] right
[10:24] but we isolate ourselves when we choose
[10:27] to sin
[10:28] okay like brother amen was saying with
[10:30] afraid right fear is not a good example
[10:32] he's a good example fear isolates people
[10:34] why can't talk to people I gotta I gotta
[10:37] pretend like nothing's wrong
[10:39] okay that's fear it's you it's your own
[10:42] choice to do that you don't have to do
[10:43] that I don't have to do that we don't
[10:45] have to be that way but sometimes we
[10:47] choose that way
[10:49] right
[10:50] and they they start from worse to better
[10:52] by God's grace
[10:54] second
[10:55] we can be uh isolated from God for the
[10:59] purpose of being tested
[11:01] and that's just of course of his
[11:02] influence
[11:03] okay but uh and then like the example we
[11:06] gave with Jesus we can be isolated with
[11:09] God that's the one we want to do by
[11:11] God's grace Hallelujah
[11:13] Now Dave you get this one right all the
[11:15] other ones will be taken care of real
[11:16] quick
[11:18] or you may have like a year-long test
[11:20] like Bernie was saying or or job months
[11:22] long test or other tests can last a long
[11:24] time
[11:26] but if you get this one right you can
[11:28] endure all the others for sure
[11:30] I love this even though God allows at
[11:32] least three kinds of isolation we are
[11:34] never forsaken he said I will never
[11:37] let's all say never ready never that
[11:39] means not once not once will God ever
[11:42] forsake you and say I don't want nothing
[11:43] to do with you I don't care about
[11:45] brother Jesse I don't care about sister
[11:47] so and so or brother so-and-so God will
[11:49] never say that in other words God always
[11:51] cares amen Hallelujah and he's never
[11:54] going to get tired of you another thing
[11:55] about that think about how many times I
[11:57] sin every day every month and God never
[11:59] gets tired of me ah that's Divine love
[12:02] Hallelujah
[12:03] think about all the times we fall short
[12:05] and the mistakes we make and uh our
[12:07] questions our doubts our fears all these
[12:10] things we go through and God never says
[12:11] I've given them enough now we we give up
[12:14] on people but God never gives up on us
[12:16] amen
[12:17] I've given up on people
[12:20] I've told them not to come back to
[12:22] church
[12:23] now just a few
[12:25] I've given up on this
[12:26] right and I was Vindicated you know as
[12:29] time went by because they never came to
[12:31] repent
[12:32] and the Bible says that
[12:34] it's the Bible says separate yourself
[12:35] from them right don't let the leaven and
[12:37] if you let the leaven in eleven's all
[12:39] Church
[12:40] I've given up right now I know in a
[12:43] sense God can give up as if somebody
[12:44] crosses the line of mercy and judgment
[12:45] but the point is the point for the
[12:47] believer is that when you surrender to
[12:49] Jesus he'll never leave you he'll never
[12:51] forsake you because he foreknew you
[12:53] praise God
[12:55] and that's what I'm going to preach on
[12:57] Sunday at the Baptist Church Lord
[12:58] willing thankful to be chosen in Christ
[13:00] so I want to do a Thanksgiving message
[13:03] uh
[13:04] and we're thankful that he chose us in
[13:07] him before the foundation was I want to
[13:08] take the the Baptist people back before
[13:10] the foundation of the world
[13:13] like we get to do so many times right a
[13:15] preacher will say before the foundation
[13:18] days you know when I came in the message
[13:19] that was the loudest thing you shouted
[13:20] on you know but now you know time's
[13:22] going on and we just needs some fresh
[13:24] stuff you know so
[13:26] that I used to always shot on that
[13:27] before the foundation of the Wild
[13:30] um so you know but God he saw us and we
[13:33] can see now now that we're in the truth
[13:34] now that we're in the Bible truth of the
[13:36] message of the hour we can see how God
[13:38] chose us before the foundation world we
[13:41] can see how other people have turned it
[13:42] down but somehow it spoke to our hearts
[13:45] the Bible speaks to our heart and we
[13:47] want to obey all the word of God we can
[13:49] see oh my whole life was set up for this
[13:51] I was born for this I'd walk through
[13:54] snow for this amen hallelujah thank God
[13:57] Amen hallelujah or you're 12 years old
[14:00] uh talking about the Holy Ghost falling
[14:02] on you at your home Church you know and
[14:03] and fasting at 12 years old for the Holy
[14:05] Ghost you know there's something
[14:06] different about us praise God
[14:08] we are different God had everything
[14:10] ordained he and by foreknowledge he knew
[14:13] who would choose him and then because of
[14:15] four knowledge he could predetermine the
[14:17] events of your life so you could travel
[14:19] from Arizona and come to Ohio and hear
[14:21] about Jesus amen
[14:23] amen or for me God could take me away
[14:26] from my family from one side of the
[14:28] state to the other and finally get
[14:30] isolate me oh there it is amen isolate
[14:32] me so I'm away from every influence so
[14:34] now God can influence me and I can get
[14:36] saved and get filled with the Holy Ghost
[14:38] and Pastor our church amen
[14:41] Hallelujah you had to isolate me
[14:45] I was telling that to somebody the other
[14:46] maybe last month or something like that
[14:48] I was like
[14:49] I don't remember who it was now but I
[14:51] was saying I said God had this I feel
[14:53] like Abraham my wife and I feel like
[14:55] Abraham and Sarah
[14:56] God called us away from all of our
[14:58] family I miss my mom I cry when I don't
[15:00] get to be with my mom sometimes you know
[15:02] I miss my brothers but I see why God had
[15:05] to do it God had to separate us so we
[15:08] could serve the Lord praise God
[15:10] so God knows there was some other
[15:11] influence over there or my wife and I we
[15:13] could not have had as much Unity we
[15:15] could not she and I could not have
[15:17] served the Lord as well had we stayed
[15:19] over there so God separate us God
[15:21] isolated us amen
[15:23] so what are we honey we're isolated with
[15:25] God by God's grace
[15:27] Hallelujah
[15:28] now uh
[15:30] by our own sinful choosing at times we
[15:33] choose to isolate ourselves right we
[15:35] call this mind battles right
[15:38] uh what was I made a joke a couple years
[15:40] ago about mine battles
[15:42] oh yeah someone asked you how you're
[15:44] doing I'm just biting the battles
[15:45] brother Jesse you know we kind of know
[15:47] what that means now
[15:49] you know either it's a hard test from
[15:52] the Lord or we put ourselves in
[15:53] isolation right that's good
[15:56] right
[15:58] and so you know in the Hebrew this you
[15:59] know this verse we read this was our
[16:01] text
[16:01] see it's it's a it's a desire when we
[16:04] have a lustful desire and we go after it
[16:06] we separate ourselves we isolate ourself
[16:09] right and we seek and inner mentalism
[16:12] with or we fight against or contend with
[16:15] all wisdom in other words I mean the
[16:17] answer is so clear we can fix this so
[16:19] easily but we just go totally against it
[16:21] because of our own lusts
[16:23] right yeah
[16:25] our own uh like brother Branham even
[16:27] with the critical spirit I always go
[16:28] back to that because you can see it
[16:29] plainly in brother Brown's life
[16:31] all the wisdom of the world would have
[16:33] told him uh not to isolate himself well
[16:35] there it is again I didn't even mean to
[16:37] say that he was going to go isolate
[16:38] himself but standing in the Gap was
[16:40] going to go isolate himself and said if
[16:42] they won't hear my preaching just let
[16:43] him let him have not have no fellowship
[16:46] with me I'll just go up there with my
[16:48] wife and we'll move up in the mountains
[16:49] and when God gives me without saying
[16:50] Lord I'll come Thunder down and I'll
[16:52] give him thou saith the Lord I'll go
[16:53] back up see he was going to isolate
[16:55] himself by his own sin
[16:57] but what did God do God came and rescued
[16:59] himself from himself and in that quote
[17:02] George brother said it was a selfish
[17:04] thing because he wanted to go hunting
[17:06] and the church said
[17:08] selfish see through a desire what
[17:10] through your own desire he wanted to go
[17:12] hunting he was already discouraged the
[17:14] people aren't receiving my message oh
[17:16] but there's going to be some people that
[17:17] would receive his message that's you and
[17:19] me amen hallelujah amen but see it's a
[17:23] lust now even that case a lust after
[17:25] sports right hunting is a sport
[17:29] for the rest of I'm glad God gave me a
[17:30] sport
[17:32] so that's why we can't let football
[17:33] become a idol you know basketball and
[17:35] baseball and softball
[17:39] uh
[17:40] but see though you know when we get in
[17:42] this sinful condition when we're
[17:44] disobeying the word of God I'll say like
[17:46] this we get in the permissive will of
[17:47] God then we'll we'll go to any lengths
[17:49] not to do what's right so we can get our
[17:51] own way
[17:53] right this was I love this word by the
[17:55] University of teaching about that was
[17:56] really good
[17:58] I want to look at this a little more
[17:59] here
[18:02] and so that's where we get and that's
[18:04] what he was mentioning with afraid you
[18:06] know we can't be afraid to be honest
[18:07] okay
[18:09] you can't be afraid to be honest now
[18:11] um isolation has always been Satan's
[18:14] tactic start at the Garden of Eden you
[18:16] know what do you do
[18:18] it seems like Adam wasn't there if Adam
[18:21] was there then that's a big shame on
[18:23] Adam
[18:24] right it doesn't seem like Adam was
[18:25] there
[18:27] um but where was he he should have been
[18:28] there
[18:29] he had dominion over the whole garden
[18:30] right we've recently that's been a fresh
[18:33] thought to me like wow what was he doing
[18:37] um but remember Satan's attack of
[18:39] deception on Eve in Genesis was diminish
[18:42] the vision of God
[18:44] okay your vision of God diminish that
[18:46] well God's not so great anymore this is
[18:49] this might be not so good anymore
[18:51] diminish the Vengeance of God oh God's
[18:53] not you're surely not going to die
[18:55] distort the voice of God did God really
[18:57] say that
[18:59] and then decide to be void of God you
[19:01] can touch it you partake of it it's okay
[19:04] just just totally go against God so see
[19:06] Satan isolates us the same exact way
[19:08] does he not
[19:10] hey brother Jesse said amen same way
[19:13] same way
[19:14] oh it's okay and oh it's okay you to
[19:18] have that you know it's okay just you're
[19:20] tired or whatever
[19:21] struggling you you know you need to you
[19:24] need to do that
[19:25] but what did Satan do he isolated Eve
[19:30] and in that isolation she fell
[19:33] right and then and then Satan isolated
[19:35] Adam right Adam thought forgot about for
[19:37] some reason he forgot about the presence
[19:39] of God he knew God was going to come
[19:40] down and walk with him but you know he
[19:42] knew God was going to come down to
[19:43] Fellowship but he forgot about that
[19:45] and he let himself be isolated you know
[19:48] with his wife away from God
[19:50] so we see that this is Satan's tactic
[19:52] always to isolate people away from the
[19:55] truth or away from God or away from uh
[19:58] the word of God will say like that now
[20:01] you don't have to read all this I just
[20:02] threw all these ideas in here
[20:05] yeah I mean really I want to preach this
[20:06] because the numerous people had come to
[20:08] me and uh they're lusting after other
[20:10] people or phones things on phones and
[20:13] all these things
[20:15] but brother amen to mentioned it's the
[20:17] fear of people thinking less of us but
[20:19] we have to get but yeah but here's what
[20:21] I want to get to but see we're all going
[20:23] to sin but we've got to get rid of our
[20:25] sin
[20:26] in other words like I want to come to
[20:28] church happy every time if I possibly
[20:30] can
[20:31] and the only way I can be happy is
[20:32] either pretend or confess my sins amen
[20:35] hallelujah and if I confess my sin then
[20:37] I know that God forgave me Hallelujah
[20:40] that's why I lay up here many times and
[20:41] try to get right with God and you know I
[20:43] I don't want sin in my life I want to
[20:45] overcome it praise God
[20:48] so we have to pray and ask God to help
[20:50] us to hate this and that's what I was
[20:51] telling the people that were in their
[20:52] secret sins with sexual sin I said
[20:55] you've got to hate this
[20:57] if you hate like I say like if you hate
[20:59] trash stinky trash if you hate the smell
[21:01] of skunks you're going to get away from
[21:03] it
[21:04] if you hate the the presence of sin
[21:06] you're going to get away from it
[21:08] you've got to learn to hate it and see
[21:09] it for what it is now imagine that Satan
[21:12] tricks us into thinking skunk smells
[21:13] good
[21:14] Satan deceives us into thinking sin is
[21:17] good
[21:18] and the church said
[21:20] that's because nothing good dwells in
[21:21] your flesh Hallelujah
[21:24] it's easy to deceive your flesh because
[21:26] nothing good dwells in your flesh
[21:29] and when we get our mind off the word of
[21:30] God and we get our mind away from the
[21:32] soul the nature of the Soul trying to
[21:34] influence us then yeah we can be tempted
[21:36] by things in the mind in the mind and
[21:38] the flesh
[21:42] uh then I said then we can deal with it
[21:43] alone with Jesus now yeah that's what we
[21:45] need to do
[21:46] when we have sins we got to ask God God
[21:48] help me to hate this and then Lord I'm
[21:50] drawing nigh to you and I want you to
[21:52] deal with my sin
[21:54] I want you to forgive me
[21:55] if not church we need to get someone
[21:57] else's help and that's where where they
[21:59] even gave a good testimony that and we
[22:00] all have those testimonies like when I
[22:02] need help I usually go to my best friend
[22:03] my wife that's what I usually do when I
[22:05] need help
[22:05] we get to we have a date every week on
[22:07] Friday Lord willing and uh that's right
[22:09] you just get to talk to my wife
[22:11] I get to talk about all my deepest
[22:13] struggles
[22:14] okay you got to have somebody praise God
[22:16] and then there's certain Brothers I can
[22:18] talk to but amen about you know things I
[22:20] I need help with and pray have him pray
[22:22] for me praise God and different brothers
[22:24] or sisters you're close with different
[22:25] sisters in the Lord you can talk to and
[22:27] confide in and they'll pray for you
[22:29] praise God that's a wonderful thing
[22:31] uh but if we can't overcome it ourselves
[22:33] and we need to get someone's help
[22:35] confess our faults one to another and
[22:37] that may help us Church there is power
[22:39] in telling somebody about a fault
[22:42] there's so much power because now you're
[22:44] not alone praise God you know you don't
[22:46] feel isolated like I'm the only one who
[22:48] knows and I uh in church you know and if
[22:51] you trust that person like brothers
[22:52] saying if you trust them with love you
[22:54] know they're not going to go spread it
[22:55] around
[22:56] because honestly they got the same
[22:57] problems you got
[23:00] Hallelujah Church let's be honest here
[23:03] tonight let's not act like we're holy or
[23:04] something like that like all holy all
[23:06] the time my soul is Holy but my mind and
[23:08] body is not always holy
[23:10] if they're honest they can say yeah
[23:12] brother sister I I can relate to that
[23:15] I've been through that
[23:17] or I know somebody who's been through
[23:18] that
[23:21] now remember Church sin is never good
[23:24] and we can never condone it like if
[23:25] somebody so like when we if we confess
[23:27] our fault to somebody we can't expect
[23:28] them to say oh it's okay that you're
[23:30] what that you're watching porn it's not
[23:32] okay
[23:34] or it's okay uh that you're stealing
[23:36] from the bank
[23:37] it's not okay
[23:39] we're gonna go to jail
[23:40] you can't condone it okay and you know
[23:43] none of us here you know or battle those
[23:45] thank God you know uh
[23:48] but we can definitely support them
[23:50] through our efforts with prayer and help
[23:53] them battle against sin and eventually
[23:55] they will overcome it because they're
[23:57] Overcomers amen that's what Jesus calls
[24:00] to me praise God he's an overcometh
[24:02] praise God
[24:03] he's rewarding us praise God overcome
[24:05] he's to go through a test and then to be
[24:08] the Victor Hallelujah leave some
[24:10] knockout punches Hallelujah like we
[24:12] preached a few weeks ago amen Mighty Men
[24:14] Mighty women need knockout scriptures
[24:17] Hallelujah like get thee behind me Satan
[24:19] amen hallelujah or Jesus forgive me of
[24:22] my sin forgive me in my struggle I'm
[24:24] coming to you help me to hate this
[24:27] get thee behind me Satan in Jesus name
[24:31] so you know that's the beautiful part
[24:32] about marriage
[24:34] it's built in many times that you can
[24:36] talk to someone about your deepest
[24:38] struggles because guess what they see
[24:39] your deepest struggles
[24:41] they wake up next to their deepest
[24:43] struggles right
[24:44] Hallelujah are they going to bed next to
[24:47] their deepest struggles
[24:49] and that's why the Bible says confess
[24:52] your faults before the sun goes down
[24:54] right
[24:55] so we so we don't feel isolated when we
[24:57] go to bed right we don't want to be
[24:59] isolated like the devil's beating us up
[25:01] and you're condemned you're condemned
[25:03] you're condemned
[25:04] um
[25:06] you don't want to go to bed like that
[25:07] you want to go to bed with Grace you
[25:09] want to go to bed you go go to bed with
[25:11] confidence that God's heard your prayer
[25:14] and you know you're forgiven praise God
[25:15] sometimes I got to do that church
[25:17] sometimes I don't feel I don't sometimes
[25:19] I don't even feel what the Bible's
[25:20] saying so I just got to lay open my
[25:22] bible
[25:23] and I just gotta like rub the Bible just
[25:25] that's what it says it says that I am
[25:27] forgiven praise God he his mercies are
[25:30] new every day praise God I mean just
[25:32] gotta like get past the human thoughts
[25:34] and the feelings and just believe and
[25:37] just say I believe what the word of God
[25:39] says hallelujah
[25:40] that's casting down all imaginations
[25:43] Hallelujah
[25:47] now this may be a repeat here yeah
[25:49] sometimes you don't want to be afraid to
[25:50] confess our faults one to another and we
[25:52] should do that if needed now what I mean
[25:54] by that it's not always needed if you're
[25:56] over you're able to overcome your sin
[25:58] alone
[26:01] but we're all going to have ties when we
[26:03] need to share something with somebody
[26:04] else
[26:05] and we don't want to become like
[26:06] Jerusalem
[26:08] because this is what Satan does he
[26:10] isolates us and it's like everywhere you
[26:12] turn you just feel condemnation I feel
[26:14] condemnation I feel a condemnation I'm
[26:16] guilty every time you think you just
[26:19] feel bad all day right all day
[26:21] because you're isolated it seems like
[26:23] you're just surrounded by criticism or
[26:25] sort of surrounded by failures but
[26:27] you're not a failure praise God
[26:28] hallelujah you're more than the
[26:30] Conqueror in Christ Jesus Hallelujah
[26:33] like they say I'm not a victim I'm a
[26:36] Victor Hallelujah
[26:38] Hallelujah I'm not a victim Jesus was
[26:42] the victim so I don't have to be praise
[26:44] God Amen
[26:46] he was the victim so I don't have to be
[26:48] a victim
[26:49] I'm the Overcomer Hallelujah I'm the
[26:52] benefactor I'm the one who benefits from
[26:54] the will of the one who died amen I've
[26:58] got my inheritance him I want to give
[26:59] somebody a high five
[27:00] I got my inheritance Hallelujah come on
[27:03] front row front row sister Hallelujah
[27:06] I've got my inheritance because the the
[27:09] one who made the Covenant died and now I
[27:12] possess all those blessings Hallelujah
[27:14] amen
[27:16] I've got the inheritance
[27:19] every spiritual blessing hope that's
[27:21] okay I'll give you a high five
[27:23] I just thought I needed one praise God
[27:24] Amen that's what the Romans did in 1866
[27:28] they started
[27:30] uh surrounding
[27:32] but it wasn't until think about this it
[27:35] wasn't until 70 A.D at the time of
[27:37] Passover that they actually completely
[27:40] surrounded
[27:41] Jerusalem and they would not let anybody
[27:44] in or anybody out
[27:46] and that's when they really started
[27:48] starved them out now in 66 A.D they
[27:51] would let people come in but wouldn't
[27:52] tell them they're not letting them out
[27:54] can you imagine that
[27:55] they let people come in with goods and
[27:57] water food but nobody got out starting
[27:59] in 66 A.D so 60 60 70 69 five years
[28:04] but remember every Christian was out of
[28:06] that City by that time
[28:07] hallelujah amen
[28:11] now that was last months it was uh April
[28:13] May June July August
[28:15] those last five months right at Passover
[28:18] maybe March was in there too the last
[28:19] five or six months
[28:21] uh Britannica says Joe Joseph says the
[28:24] Romans encircled the city with the wall
[28:26] to cut off supplies to the city
[28:28] completely and thereby Drive the Jews to
[28:31] starvation doesn't that does that sound
[28:33] familiar Satan makes us feel like we're
[28:36] so hungry for the word of God like we
[28:38] haven't had a good experience with God
[28:39] in so long see what's that caused by
[28:42] isolation
[28:43] right it's been so long since I had a
[28:45] good experience with the lord it's been
[28:47] so long since I really felt close to God
[28:49] why you're isolated
[28:51] right you let yourself Jerusalem let
[28:54] themselves get isolated they didn't have
[28:56] the power to drive the enemy away but
[28:58] that's not in our case we have the power
[29:00] to drive our enemy away
[29:01] we don't have to be surrounded amen it
[29:04] may look like I'm surrounded but I'm
[29:06] surrounded by Christ Hallelujah
[29:08] like Elijah said amen
[29:10] we don't have to be surrounded Church by
[29:12] the enemy we can be surrounded by Jesus
[29:17] really we are we're true saints of God
[29:19] hallelujah we'll overcome eventually by
[29:21] the grace of God
[29:22] now look I keep always forget which one
[29:24] it was it's Elisha Elisha proved the
[29:27] Angels were surrounding God's prophets
[29:29] right
[29:30] and Jesus could have called now Jesus
[29:31] was surrounded by the Angels I'm not
[29:33] sure if they were right there or not but
[29:34] he could have called 12 Legions of
[29:36] angels to be surrounded by them
[29:38] in other words he had reinforcements the
[29:41] devil didn't have him the devil didn't
[29:42] have him tied down he tied himself down
[29:46] he was isil he isolated himself away
[29:48] from God so we he didn't so God didn't
[29:50] have to isolate himself away from us
[29:53] he isolated himself from God so we don't
[29:56] have to be isolated from God Amen
[30:00] is that what the Bible said the servant
[30:02] of the man of God was risen early gone
[30:03] forth Behold a host Compass the city
[30:06] both with horses and chariots and his
[30:08] servants unto him alas my master how
[30:10] should we do does that sound familiar
[30:11] how are we going to make it through
[30:12] 2022. how are we going to make it
[30:14] through this this crisis are we going to
[30:16] make it through coven how are we going
[30:18] to make it sound familiar
[30:19] right how are we gonna make it how am I
[30:22] ever gonna I'll get over this how am I
[30:24] ever gonna get out of this oh my God
[30:27] give us eyes like a prophet amen
[30:30] and he answered fear not ah I love those
[30:32] first words Angel say it uh the prophet
[30:35] says it Jesus says it all these Mighty
[30:37] wonderful Christians all these
[30:39] Messengers from God always begin with
[30:41] don't fear
[30:43] they always begin but stop being afraid
[30:45] Don't Be Afraid God is here hallelujah
[30:49] ah and Elisha prayed and said Lord I
[30:52] pray thee open his eyes that he may see
[30:55] God open our eyes tonight that we can
[30:57] see
[30:58] God open our eyes that we can see the
[30:59] blessing of God in our lives especially
[31:02] since we're coming to Thanksgiving
[31:04] open our eyes that we can see we don't
[31:07] we're not alone
[31:09] we're not we're not forsaken hallelujah
[31:13] we're not lacking really anything
[31:15] Hallelujah
[31:17] God open our eyes to see the spiritual
[31:20] reality that they saw
[31:22] and the Lord opened the eyes of the
[31:24] young man and he saw and behold the
[31:27] mountain fix your mouth Mountain full of
[31:30] horses and Chariots of Fire round about
[31:33] who Elisha not gehaza Elisha
[31:38] the man of God
[31:39] and doesn't the Bible say God has an
[31:42] angel encamped around those who fear God
[31:44] how many fear God
[31:45] you respect God
[31:47] if you respect God there's an angel
[31:49] around your life
[31:50] there's an angel with me
[31:53] I've never seen him but I know I've been
[31:54] protected from Death a couple times I
[31:56] should have been died numerous times
[31:57] especially car accidents
[32:03] yes sir you can see them on YouTube and
[32:05] everything it's on just something
[32:07] strange will happen and someone will be
[32:09] spared at the very last moment I've seen
[32:11] him
[32:12] and of course I've seen in my life too
[32:14] it's God sending his messenger God has
[32:17] his Angel there the Bible says they're
[32:19] sent to The Heirs of Salvation that
[32:21] means we we will inherit eternal life
[32:24] amen
[32:25] eternal life is ours hallelujah thank
[32:28] God Amen
[32:31] now I thought this before service I
[32:33] thought well these two men Samson and
[32:36] the prodigal
[32:37] they isolated themselves in their sin
[32:39] but notice how merciful god was to them
[32:43] Church Even in our deepest mistakes God
[32:46] is going to come to us
[32:48] God's not going to give up on you when
[32:50] you're struggling
[32:53] I don't care how low you get I don't
[32:55] care if your eyes get poked out I don't
[32:57] care if you're eating pig food like the
[32:58] prodigal
[32:59] if you are God's child God is going to
[33:02] stoop low enough to bring you out of
[33:04] that trial because God is going to bring
[33:07] you out of isolation God knows you're an
[33:10] heir of Salvation God knows your real
[33:12] desire is to serve him so God is going
[33:13] to stoop down and God is going to rescue
[33:15] you praise God because God is rich in
[33:18] Mercy hallelujah amen and he will not
[33:22] forsake his own hallelujah oh thank God
[33:26] if you and I won't forsake our own our
[33:28] own children our own nieces and nephews
[33:30] how much more will God not forsake his
[33:32] children praise God
[33:35] Glory so see Church Even in our own
[33:37] sinful isolation it ain't always a bad
[33:40] thing because that might be the place
[33:41] where you hit rock bottom and you turn
[33:43] back to God
[33:45] oh glory amen
[33:47] that's where brother Hammond is in his
[33:49] uh again into standing in the Gap
[33:51] servant he hit rock bottom I'm leaving
[33:53] now and who came to him the angel Lord
[33:54] came to him
[33:57] he said do that and your wife will leave
[33:58] you
[33:59] if you move up in the mountains your
[34:00] wife will leave You Who Came see it's
[34:03] not always a bad thing because we're all
[34:05] human we all got to be tested with these
[34:06] trials we all got to go through the
[34:08] fires amen but the fires will refine you
[34:11] the fires will isolate you from your
[34:13] human sinful nature and the fires will
[34:16] reveal what you're really made out of
[34:18] Amen
[34:20] now you know we're made of silver and
[34:22] we're not made of silver we're made of
[34:24] gold Hallelujah
[34:26] the most valuable metal the most
[34:28] valuable thing the most valuable
[34:29] substance in in all of all of the
[34:31] universe is the spirit of God that's all
[34:33] you're made out of Amen
[34:35] that's that's what the Bible says I was
[34:37] chosen in Christ praise God the seed of
[34:39] God in Me cannot sin it cannot sin the
[34:42] seeds of God the gold of God in you it's
[34:44] deity it cannot sin that's the real you
[34:46] praise God
[34:49] Glory
[34:50] like I said if time goes on Jesse
[34:52] Smith's body will stay here but that's
[34:54] not the real Jesse Smith the real Jesse
[34:56] Smith is the spirit of God the spirit of
[34:58] God In My Soul praise God
[35:00] that's the real one that's the real you
[35:04] see you get to be on speaking terms when
[35:06] you get to that lower spot then you
[35:07] start talking to Jesus
[35:09] before just talking about your sins and
[35:11] your desires your lusts right talking
[35:13] about all that I don't have to do the
[35:15] wise thing I want to do I want to do my
[35:16] thing
[35:18] and yet Jesus Stoops to our lowest State
[35:20] when we choose the wrong path Jesus
[35:22] comes gets us out of the wrong path and
[35:24] brings us to the right path
[35:26] that's Mercy praise God that's Mercy
[35:31] that's what his Mercy did for me yeah
[35:33] sorry I kind of already said these
[35:35] things that's actually just a repeat
[35:37] so that's that we gave you the imagery
[35:38] of The Siege That's what Satan likes to
[35:40] do he likes to call all of his resources
[35:44] right social media he'll call that he'll
[35:46] isolate you on social media you'll get
[35:48] text messages right you'll get bombarded
[35:50] with text messages evil ones I'm talking
[35:52] about
[35:53] you'll hear the Evil news right yo uh
[35:56] somebody mistreats you in the home
[35:57] somebody mistreat you on the job
[35:59] somebody misreach on school it's
[36:00] bombarded by all this
[36:03] all this negativity you bombarded and he
[36:06] isolates you and makes you feel like
[36:08] well I'm the only one going through this
[36:09] or I'm the only one that has struggles
[36:11] uh take a number or get behind me
[36:13] because I've got struggles too praise
[36:14] God get in the line amen
[36:18] well well so we all got to go talk to
[36:20] Jesus amen and we all got to work it out
[36:22] Hallelujah you're not the only one I'm
[36:24] not the only one
[36:25] the Saints down Through the Ages have
[36:27] overcome difficult trials we can
[36:30] overcome labor to see if we can do it
[36:32] because greater is he that's in you than
[36:34] he that's in later to say Amen
[36:37] Glory
[36:41] now this is the next kind sometimes God
[36:44] isolates us from that anointing in other
[36:46] words we don't feel God so much
[36:48] sometimes we feel god brother Chris and
[36:50] I'll shout and dance and scream I'll cry
[36:53] I'll sing Hallelujah I'll sing all the
[36:54] way home I'll sing it sing at home I'll
[36:56] dance I was dancing at home on Monday
[36:58] praise God I was dancing singing and
[36:59] worshiping on Monday I love to dance for
[37:02] Jesus
[37:03] but that's when I feel it praise God I
[37:05] don't always feel it though
[37:07] sometimes I don't feel like dancing
[37:08] somebody sometimes you don't feel like
[37:09] shouting
[37:11] yet if he isolates us from that
[37:14] anointing the feeling of it he still
[37:16] never forsakes us
[37:18] like here's four examples I don't I I'm
[37:20] not I'm sorry I did not get to the job
[37:21] when I just got to some of these
[37:22] remember in the business of the
[37:24] ambassadors of the prince of Babylon
[37:26] Hezekiah
[37:27] God left him look at that let's say God
[37:29] left him ready God left him God left him
[37:33] to try him
[37:35] now did God ever forsake Him no God's
[37:37] never forsaken anybody except Jesus
[37:44] forsaken is to leave and not care about
[37:48] like if you forsake your trash you leave
[37:49] in the trash can just leave it there so
[37:52] God never forgets about us
[37:54] God never has evil intentions for us
[37:57] right so like when you forsake some
[37:59] trash you don't want any more I don't
[38:01] want I have I just want that to go to
[38:03] the landfill you know you forsake it
[38:05] but if something's important to you like
[38:08] you might leave your phone somewhere
[38:10] well you're not going to forsake it well
[38:11] I don't need it you're going to go back
[38:12] and get it that's how it is with God
[38:15] Amen Hallelujah you know that's how it
[38:17] is with God you know God he now God
[38:19] though he leaves us though to test us
[38:21] how are we going to react
[38:23] because it's always going to be a lesson
[38:25] that where we can learn something out of
[38:27] that
[38:28] when God withdraws all the feelings and
[38:30] all the thoughts and all the anointing
[38:32] when God draws all that away then we're
[38:33] kind of left to ourselves and oh what
[38:35] have we learned
[38:37] uh what how are we going to react when
[38:39] we don't feel good
[38:41] how are we going to react when we don't
[38:42] feel like singing We don't feel like
[38:44] going to church we don't feel like
[38:46] singing We don't feel like clapping how
[38:48] are we going to react
[38:50] right and then that then that that is
[38:52] God showing us what's in our hearts
[38:55] right just like he did it that he might
[38:57] know oh that was it has a guy's heart
[38:59] amen
[39:01] see so God will withdraw he'll withdraw
[39:03] dreams we talked about that no more
[39:05] dreams or or no more uh no more
[39:07] inspiration like even for a preacher
[39:08] there will be times it's really hard for
[39:10] me to find inspiration like I don't even
[39:11] know what to preach
[39:13] I got inspiration today
[39:15] uh
[39:17] sometimes they'll withdraw you don't
[39:19] feel that
[39:20] but it reveals now what is in my heart
[39:24] what's left when I don't feel God what's
[39:27] left in my thoughts
[39:29] what's left in my habits
[39:31] what's left in my my mind what is left
[39:33] because I don't have that strong
[39:35] anointing on me you know that that
[39:37] excitement or that that the Zeal that
[39:39] sincerity now I'm just kind of left
[39:41] what's left in me that's what you find
[39:43] out
[39:44] and we all go through it every single
[39:46] one of us goes through it
[39:48] sometimes we do it to ourselves like we
[39:50] said uh I remember the one of brother
[39:52] Brandon where brother Adam said Lord you
[39:53] owe me understanding why you took that
[39:55] young woman's life after you saved her
[39:56] from drowning
[39:57] for two weeks brother said the sheet
[39:59] came down and he didn't hear from God so
[40:01] God was testing him
[40:03] but it showed brother random what was in
[40:05] his heart what was in his heart I'm
[40:06] sorry Lord I got prideful
[40:09] see your trials show you what's in your
[40:11] heart
[40:13] okay
[40:14] in other words Lord come back lord if
[40:15] you forgive me send back the Holy Spirit
[40:17] two weeks later God Did You Know
[40:19] see you get a Revival amen hallelujah
[40:21] all those six six types of revivals
[40:25] see God leaves those feelings God takes
[40:27] away the feelings and all the
[40:28] inspiration and all these things and
[40:30] you're just left with you and what what
[40:32] are you gonna do what are you going to
[40:34] yield to the holy spirit in your mind
[40:36] now he never leaves your soul if you're
[40:38] born again
[40:39] but the Mind goes back and the flesh
[40:41] just goes back to not having all that
[40:43] all that anointing on you
[40:45] that's what the Bible says
[40:47] to show you what is in your mind right
[40:50] what is in your emotions
[40:52] what is there left that needs to come
[40:54] out
[40:55] glory amen thank God Hallelujah
[40:59] David said my God my God why is Thou
[41:01] forsaken me now he thought he was but
[41:04] actually David was never forsaken he was
[41:06] actually speaking this of Christ
[41:09] why art thou so far from helping me
[41:11] anybody anybody ever felt like that you
[41:12] know for Asian I'll raise my hands up
[41:14] I'm like God how come you haven't helped
[41:16] me I feel like my help is so far away
[41:18] and from the words of my roaring I'm
[41:20] roaring God my my prayers are so loud
[41:22] it's like a roar where are you
[41:25] oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou
[41:27] hearest not in the night season and I'm
[41:30] not silent I'm crying I'm praying all
[41:32] the time I'm asking God about this
[41:33] service after service week after week
[41:36] where are you God
[41:38] hallelujah amen
[41:40] see we all have to go through that we
[41:42] all got to be tested to see what's
[41:44] really in our heart
[41:46] are the good things in our heart have we
[41:48] have we had enough character to trust
[41:49] God in the midst of the trials
[41:51] or we just serve God because it's easy
[41:53] because I got feelings for God what
[41:56] happens when you don't have feelings
[41:57] well
[41:58] I realize I got a growing God I got to
[42:00] grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord
[42:01] boy time's fine
[42:03] Jeremiah this is what I preached on
[42:04] years ago
[42:06] Jeremiah said that he's alone and look
[42:09] he's alone and In Perpetual pain now
[42:11] that's a different thing you can be
[42:13] alone and not in so much pain but when
[42:15] you're alone and in pain that's the
[42:16] worst
[42:18] what's worse than that what could be
[42:19] worse than that I'm alone I have nobody
[42:21] and I'm also in pain what can be worse
[42:23] than that nothing
[42:24] okay I'm in a loan and all I have is
[42:27] hurt and pain and bitterness and and
[42:30] guilt and shame and and selflessness
[42:33] and worry and fret and fear that's all I
[42:36] have
[42:38] Jeremiah said I sat not in the Assembly
[42:40] of the mockers nor Rejoice I sat alone
[42:41] because of thy hand for thou has fill me
[42:44] with Indian Nation now look he's
[42:45] accusing God you fill me with Indian
[42:47] Nation well actually that was a good
[42:48] thing because it was righteous in the
[42:50] nation against the Sinners that was a
[42:52] good one but he says later he actually
[42:53] accuses God of deceiving him
[42:55] but look he sit alone Jeremiah is all
[42:58] alone because God moved him off how'd
[43:01] you like that
[43:02] how'd you like that you're all you're
[43:04] all in a comfortable place but God moves
[43:06] you across said no no you got to come
[43:07] over all alone I want you all over alone
[43:09] all by yourself
[43:10] it was God's hand that did that
[43:13] God said well I want to I want to pull
[43:15] my servant aside and I want to test him
[43:16] a little bit all by himself or all by
[43:19] herself
[43:21] now church we got to be careful when
[43:22] we're all alone say oh it's sister's
[43:24] fault it's brother's fault or if only it
[43:27] was it might not be any of their fault
[43:29] it might be God doing it
[43:31] Hallelujah
[43:33] come on Church it might be God doing it
[43:36] we can't blame other people well if only
[43:38] they would call me or if only they would
[43:40] text me
[43:41] why don't you text them
[43:44] maybe God's holding it back praise God
[43:47] did this God's hand moved him all by
[43:49] himself I sat alone
[43:52] I sat alone in church I said hello to my
[43:55] car I sat alone at work
[43:57] I sat alone because God had me sitting
[44:00] by myself
[44:02] that's how does it work I'm like the
[44:04] only male teacher there I always sit all
[44:05] by myself usually now sometimes some of
[44:07] those teachers have mercy on me they'll
[44:08] come sit by me you know I'm not a very
[44:10] friendly I'm not a very sociable person
[44:12] I should say like I'm friendly but I'm
[44:13] not sociable but but in the natural I
[44:15] sit alone all the time at work you know
[44:17] at the at the meetings
[44:20] sometimes it's embarrassing but I
[44:21] thought well at least Jesus said with me
[44:23] by God's grace I'm glad not to be
[44:25] friends of Sinners you know like I say
[44:27] like that
[44:28] he says why is my pain unending how come
[44:30] this pain never leaves me that's what a
[44:33] prophet said
[44:34] and my wound uncurable I feel like I can
[44:37] never get over this
[44:39] I'm all alone and I feel like this is a
[44:41] never-ending pain
[44:43] which refuses to be healed I can't get
[44:45] healed I just can't find the victory
[44:46] will thou be all together unto me as a
[44:48] liar and as Waters that fail now look
[44:51] Jeremiah's saying God you're like a liar
[44:53] to me
[44:54] look at that
[44:57] see church sometimes will say things
[44:59] we'll say things in such ignorance
[45:01] against God
[45:03] we will say such foolish things
[45:06] I'm guilty
[45:08] sometimes I've said foolish things to
[45:10] God
[45:12] and yet does God forgive us Church
[45:14] does God give us one more chance
[45:17] there's always another chance thank God
[45:20] there is always another chance
[45:23] there's always another chance
[45:26] I feel like God's lying to me I feel
[45:27] like God don't keep his word
[45:29] nope God does keep his word
[45:32] you just need to be alone for a while
[45:34] right God just wants us alone for a
[45:36] little bit
[45:38] for even thy Brethren and the house of
[45:40] thy father even they have dealt
[45:42] treacherously against thee so his mom
[45:44] and Dad and brothers and sisters have
[45:45] all mistreated Jeremiah they've called a
[45:47] multitude after me not only that but
[45:49] they've sent people after me believe
[45:51] them not though they speak Fair words
[45:52] unto thee
[45:55] now look oh Lord thou has to see me and
[45:57] I was deceived as God deceive people
[46:01] Jeremiah thinks he does
[46:02] everybody thinks God deceived him as a
[46:04] prophet see here sometimes will say
[46:06] things it's not right
[46:09] how many believe God is gracious though
[46:12] but I like this though he says stronger
[46:14] than I that's prevailed I'm in derision
[46:16] daily everyone mocketh me doesn't sound
[46:18] like a very fun a fun experience to be a
[46:20] prophet you know church we all thank God
[46:22] we're not Prophets look what they've
[46:23] done to brother random
[46:25] right
[46:27] for since I spake I cried out I cried
[46:29] violence and spoil because the word Lord
[46:31] was made or approach unto me and a
[46:33] derision daily then I said I will not
[46:34] make mention of him nor speak any more
[46:37] in his name but his word was in my heart
[46:39] as a burning fire shut up in my bones
[46:41] and I was weary with forbearing and I
[46:43] could not stay praise God in other words
[46:45] he finally makes a decision I'm not
[46:47] preaching anymore I'm not testifying I'm
[46:49] not seen anymore but then all of a
[46:51] sudden the fire of God comes in and said
[46:52] okay I got to do it praise God I'm
[46:55] changing my plans amen
[46:57] I just made plans I'm no longer praying
[46:59] I'm no longer singing I'm no longer
[47:01] going to testify but then all of a
[47:03] sudden I just gotta testify
[47:06] hallelujah thank God
[47:08] amen
[47:11] for I heard the defaming of many and
[47:14] fear was on every side look fear he's
[47:16] isolated
[47:17] fears all around me everybody's against
[47:19] me the preachers are against me my dad's
[47:21] against me ever my whole family's
[47:23] against me fears everywhere
[47:25] Reports say they and we will report it
[47:28] all my familiars watch for my halting
[47:30] they couldn't wait perhaps he will be
[47:32] enticed and we'll Prevail against him
[47:34] and we shall take our revenge on him I
[47:36] can't wait till he falls I can't wait
[47:38] till she falls
[47:39] that's what he heard all the time
[47:41] oh he's a real Prophet he's a real
[47:43] preacher he's a real Saint she's a real
[47:46] Christian yeah I bet she's a real
[47:47] message believer I can't wait till they
[47:49] fall
[47:51] but the Lord is with me ah as a mighty
[47:55] terrible one therefore my persecutor
[47:57] shall stumble and they shall not Prevail
[47:59] they shall be greatly ashamed for they
[48:00] shall not Prosper their Everlasting
[48:02] confusion shall never be forgotten but O
[48:05] Lord of hosts that tries the righteous

[48:27] testifying start singing Hallelujah
[48:30] start calling on God start asking God to
[48:33] move and just keep connecting to God

[48:52] now look now what's interesting look at
[48:54] the next verse so let's see verse 13 now
[48:55] look at the next verse Jeremiah was
[48:57] going through some really bad roller
[48:59] coasters
[49:01] he just got done saying God's deceived
[49:03] me
[49:04] ah God's like a liar to me then he says
[49:08] fires in my bones Hallelujah I'm going
[49:09] to sing all day and the next paragraph
[49:12] is cursed to be the day wherein I was
[49:14] born that's just like job job had highs
[49:17] and lows
[49:18] right you and I got highs and lows maybe
[49:20] that's why we like Cedar Point so much
[49:22] right
[49:23] because that's like a it's an image of
[49:24] Our Lives
[49:26] okay
[49:31] you're missing out brother your whole
[49:33] life is there
[49:34] and I'm just kidding but look he's on
[49:38] the high low here he's in the real
[49:39] depths right now right
[49:41] curse now can you imagine that if I come
[49:43] up here you heard me praying before God
[49:45] I wish I never would have been born
[49:46] cursed a day in November 17th 1980. look
[49:51] that's what he was praying
[49:53] I wish I was I wish that day was curved
[49:56] life is so hard our church this ought to
[49:58] encourages us tonight that life is not
[49:59] so hard at least not yet we don't know
[50:02] what's going to happen
[50:03] this ought to encourage us Lord thank
[50:05] you for your blessings in my life
[50:08] I'm not cursing the day I was born thank
[50:10] you God for giving me a life thank you
[50:12] for giving me an opportunity to serve
[50:14] you thank you for giving me Grace in the
[50:16] land of the living thank you that you're
[50:18] my shepherd and you leave me beside
[50:20] Still Waters
[50:21] and I shall not lack amen the Lord is my
[50:25] shepherd amen I shall not what
[50:29] he maketh me lie down in Green Pastures
[50:32] he leads me by Still Waters he restores
[50:35] my my soul praise God
[50:37] aren't you glad he restores the church
[50:40] gives you a fresh start
[50:42] makes you feel life is worth living
[50:44] again because he lives
[50:47] let not the day where my mother bear me
[50:50] be blessed curse me the man who brought
[50:51] Tidings to my father saying a man child
[50:53] is born into the making him very glad
[50:55] he's he's wishing he was cursed
[50:58] right
[51:00] and then of course that's where I
[51:01] stopped it but I just want to show you
[51:02] that roller coaster ride
[51:04] you'll never think the same about Cedar
[51:06] Point will you Lydia
[51:08] now here's where we here's where we have
[51:10] to be church and I find this when I'm
[51:12] doing this I can get through my trials
[51:13] so much better
[51:15] when I choose to isolate and get along
[51:17] with God that's when I find the greatest
[51:19] victories
[51:21] now what happened church is people stop
[51:22] isolating with God at home and then they
[51:24] stop coming to church
[51:26] right
[51:28] that's usually what happens
[51:32] so Chris just so you know what we're
[51:34] we're worshiping here tonight this is
[51:35] not a show this is how we live at home
[51:38] right we don't act one way at church and
[51:40] act one way home we live the same way
[51:43] now you're going to see me make more
[51:45] mistakes at home for sure because you're
[51:48] you're there the whole time with me you
[51:49] know you see my ups and downs
[51:52] but it's a
[51:54] it's it's a it's a daily walk with God
[51:57] and I'm trying to bring this down to
[51:58] closer try to bring this down
[52:01] we want to be isolated with God because
[52:03] that's what Jesus did he isolated
[52:05] himself from others in order to pray he
[52:07] isolated himself to the father like our
[52:10] text said he purposely isolated himself
[52:13] to go pray
[52:16] he withdrew himself into the Wilderness
[52:18] and prayed I've got to leave I have to
[52:21] leave the bright lights of the city
[52:23] I gotta leave the noise of the crowd and
[52:25] I got to have some time in nature that's
[52:27] what Jesus said
[52:29] someone don't have the benefit of that
[52:30] but
[52:32] if you are struggling that'd be a good
[52:34] choice for you praise God
[52:36] Hallelujah
[52:38] I mean all those brothers that hunt you
[52:39] know I don't I don't like hunting but
[52:41] all of them say they just enjoy that
[52:42] time out in nature
[52:44] now that's fine as long as they're
[52:45] having communion with God I think that's
[52:47] a good thing I am kind of a little
[52:49] envious of that I'll admit you know
[52:51] I just don't see you when am I going to
[52:53] do that in the summertime I could do it
[52:54] but you really can't hunt in summer
[52:56] praise God
[52:57] so it just doesn't make any sense to me
[52:59] but the idea is leaving everything
[53:02] that's uh stressful and going to a place
[53:05] of peace
[53:08] now brother Adam gives this quote
[53:11] brother Ram uh God had to tell brother
[53:13] Branham in 1960. now I'm gonna I'm gonna
[53:16] skip down here
[53:18] program had a fever and missed some
[53:20] meetings and he was asking God about it
[53:21] and he said there he stood talking to me
[53:23] and Jesus said well you walk with two
[53:24] men he said to walk with me you'll walk
[53:26] alone he said I'd seen that so program
[53:28] had noticed this in his life
[53:30] and what was he doing he was catering to
[53:32] denominations
[53:34] to everything see somebody trying to
[53:37] tell you what to do and what not to do
[53:38] he says you've got to follow him
[53:42] so in this stage of his life brother
[53:44] Adam says I'm following too much
[53:45] denominational thoughts they're telling
[53:48] me what to do instead of me seeking God
[53:51] on what to do
[53:52] this is right before the church ages man
[53:54] right before the election of 60 where
[53:56] gfk got elected
[54:00] so what I'm trying to say is we don't
[54:02] cater denominations now I'm going there
[54:05] to witness on Sunday but I'm not going
[54:07] to cater to them and preach their
[54:08] Baptist message
[54:10] I'm going to preach the real message
[54:11] amen I'm going to lay in there you know
[54:14] with love of God you know I'm not going
[54:16] to compromise on what I believe
[54:18] but I was trying to bring it in a way
[54:20] that's wise as a serpent like that's
[54:21] what William told me last time he said
[54:23] he said there was such a wonderful
[54:25] message he said that was wise as a
[54:26] serpent harmless as a dove I said well
[54:28] thank you brother William I appreciate
[54:29] that Hallelujah
[54:33] and then they you know they texted me
[54:34] afterwards said it was such a wonderful
[54:35] time in the Lord and everything all the
[54:37] fellowship all the saints
[54:39] but I just want you to know brother Ram
[54:40] did not always like confrontation we
[54:43] don't have to like confrontation
[54:45] because brother Branham said this he
[54:46] said pray for me I'll pray for you
[54:48] together we might stand may God help us
[54:50] help us may there not be one of you here
[54:52] that'll ever fail and miss that great
[54:53] time coming speaking of the Rapture and
[54:55] future home and everything now I've been
[54:57] accused of a lot of things friends and a
[54:58] lot of things I'm guilty of now look at
[54:59] that I'm neglectful that's true I don't
[55:03] know why it is but somebody has to push
[55:04] me in the corner to make me fight I
[55:06] don't know that's a nature I've done
[55:08] things that I should not have done not
[55:09] willfully but I plundered at it and
[55:11] that's what's made me so afraid
[55:13] and seeing this and seeing in this this
[55:17] day that the day we're living at and you
[55:19] see now what I believe I want to hear
[55:21] from God if all possible before I make a
[55:23] move see because I don't want to fail
[55:24] him I want to be with him everywhere I
[55:26] want you to pray for me
[55:29] I just want you to see brother Adams I
[55:31] love Brothers humility right he says I'm
[55:34] guilty of not a few things
[55:37] church he said I'm guilty of a lot of
[55:39] things
[55:40] now if you're honest
[55:42] you would probably say Amen I'm guilty
[55:43] of a lot of things
[55:45] right I would say brother Jesse uh
[55:47] brother Jesse's guilty of a lot of
[55:49] things
[55:52] and let's be let's just let's be honest
[55:54] with it and we don't have to go brag on
[55:55] the devil we don't ever want to brag on
[55:56] the devil and tell people all of our
[55:58] faults but let's just be humble
[56:00] like that guy Giant Eagle eyewitness to
[56:01] all the time he's Catholic you know and
[56:02] he uh
[56:04] we were talking about things and I was
[56:05] talking about praying for people and
[56:07] he's like there's just a Halo up there
[56:09] on your head and I'm like no I said no I
[56:11] said and I said I almost started crying
[56:12] I said I sin every single day
[56:15] see people try to exalt us you know they
[56:17] only see the good side they don't see my
[56:19] bad side
[56:20] I said Jesus died you forgive me of all
[56:23] my sins I am nothing if you look at me
[56:26] you'll be disappointed if I'm your
[56:27] example you'll be disappointed Jesus
[56:29] Christ has to be your example don't
[56:31] follow me follow Christ praise God
[56:33] follow the Christ that I'm preaching yes
[56:35] yes but don't follow if you just follow
[56:37] me you'll be disappointed
[56:40] because I I'm neglectful there's things
[56:42] I'm guilty of
[56:44] right
[56:45] and I like what you'll notice this you
[56:48] know brother Ram says he brother Adam
[56:50] did not like confrontation all the time
[56:53] he did not like that he he would just
[56:55] and he says it in other sermons too uh
[56:58] he's just trying to make everybody happy
[57:00] right he was just trying to make the
[57:01] denominational people happy
[57:03] he's just trying his best so that's why
[57:05] you'll see in his sermons you'll see
[57:08] before God gives him certain Revelations
[57:09] he would be really kind and not bring up
[57:12] things he would not preach maybe harsh
[57:13] as he does other places
[57:15] because he didn't like that
[57:17] it wasn't in his it wasn't in his nature
[57:19] to want to just ball people out
[57:22] like he preached at the Four Square
[57:24] Church
[57:26] in California whose founder was a double
[57:29] married woman and brother man never
[57:30] bought out the woman Amy simple
[57:31] McPherson but Ram called her a gallant
[57:34] Soul she was married twice the program
[57:36] preached in her church after she died
[57:39] see what's he saying
[57:41] he said I'm not that type of person
[57:44] right I'm human how many how many humans
[57:47] we got in here today
[57:48] okay no hybrids in here okay
[57:50] thank God no AI people in here
[57:53] artificial intelligence clones in here
[57:55] laughs
[57:59] I just love this about brother random he
[58:01] was so humble
[58:02] he was so honest and so that should
[58:04] encourage us to be honest
[58:06] we're going to make mistakes
[58:09] there's things I'm neglectful about
[58:11] there's things you and I neglect we all
[58:12] neglect things we know how many know
[58:14] that you should probably take care of
[58:15] things but you just don't get around to
[58:17] it all the time
[58:19] yeah like cleaning my room
[58:22] my closet
[58:25] that's just and that those are the
[58:27] natural things what about the spiritual
[58:28] things which are actually more important
[58:31] I should have taken care of this I
[58:33] should have prayed about that I should
[58:35] have talked to that person
[58:36] instead of being isolated
[58:42] now Burlington preached on love I
[58:44] thought it was beautiful I thought wow
[58:45] listen brother even I'm like that's to
[58:47] hold the gospel right
[58:48] the end of every commandment you know we
[58:51] you know like we tell don't smoke and
[58:53] don't drink and don't women don't cut
[58:54] your hair men don't grow don't grow your
[58:56] hair out long men don't wear earrings
[58:58] the end of all this is what love
[59:01] out of a pure heart
[59:03] that's why we preach all these
[59:05] commandments so that we will love God
[59:07] with a pure heart
[59:10] and a good conscience and Faith that's
[59:13] real faith I can really have confidence
[59:15] in Christ because I'm not pretending I'm
[59:17] really living for Jesus with all my
[59:18] heart
[59:19] I'm really doing it with all my heart
[59:21] surrendering everything asking God to
[59:23] forgive me cleaning up my life as often
[59:25] as I possibly can
[59:29] this is that same new creature I'm going
[59:31] to read this if you got your Bible go to
[59:33] Galatians 6.
[59:34] that's right oh got that up there
[59:37] I ended a sermon with this a couple of
[59:39] weeks ago I think verse 15. Galatians 6
[59:41] 15. for in Christ Jesus neither
[59:43] circumcision availeth anything nor
[59:46] uncircumcision but a new creature so I
[59:48] ended with that
[59:50] the only thing that prevails in heaven
[59:52] is someone who becomes a new creature
[59:54] and church the beautiful part is we can
[59:56] be new every day
[59:58] I could have a new like like every time
[1:00:00] I leave the church I come back I always
[1:00:01] think oh here's a fresh start I can be a
[1:00:04] new preacher glory amen hallelujah I can
[1:00:07] be a new preacher today praise God I
[1:00:08] could not put people to sleep
[1:00:10] foreign
[1:00:12] and for me I can be more positive you
[1:00:14] know I can be I can be more patient
[1:00:18] I can be Stern when I need to be but I
[1:00:19] can be more patient more loving
[1:00:22] I can be more like this I can be more
[1:00:25] sincere
[1:00:26] I can be more sincere
[1:00:28] or I really care about everybody
[1:00:30] I don't lose that that sincerity
[1:00:33] the people don't become you don't become
[1:00:35] common to me where I I preached to them
[1:00:37] before I don't really care what I really
[1:00:39] want to care I really
[1:00:41] so I'm going to be a new creature in
[1:00:43] Christ Jesus well that's the same thing
[1:00:44] as this the end of everything the whole
[1:00:46] purpose of everything is so you can have
[1:00:48] the love of Jesus with a pure heart
[1:00:51] and every day we can have that how many
[1:00:53] believe we can have it every day you can
[1:00:55] have a pure heart every single day but
[1:00:57] we have to remain connected to the body
[1:00:58] of Christ we can't be disconnected or
[1:01:00] isolated from the body of Christ
[1:01:02] we're not going to read all these but
[1:01:03] God set the members every one of them in
[1:01:05] his body as it pleased him
[1:01:07] so we'll just use brother amen and
[1:01:09] myself God gave brother amen he's the
[1:01:11] part of the body that sings he's the
[1:01:12] tongue maybe or the vocal cords right
[1:01:15] I'm the preacher or whatever the part of
[1:01:17] that is you know I don't know
[1:01:18] is there all kind of Parts together
[1:01:21] but each one of you sisters is an
[1:01:23] important part of the body of Christ
[1:01:25] and we need everyone and God placed you
[1:01:28] and gave you those gifts because that's
[1:01:30] what he wanted you to be
[1:01:31] because he he thought oh Lydia in this
[1:01:33] way I make her with these gifts Malachi
[1:01:35] with these gifts maybe he's the hands
[1:01:37] huh
[1:01:38] piano
[1:01:40] that's that's going to please me
[1:01:43] because that's what I want him to be
[1:01:45] and he'll do that part the best that he
[1:01:48] possibly can
[1:01:51] if we were all song leaders or preachers
[1:01:53] where was the body be
[1:01:56] if we're all imagine if we're all
[1:01:58] preachers here
[1:01:59] we'd be all critic like as a preacher
[1:02:02] I'm constantly criticizing is that right
[1:02:05] you sure what about this what about that
[1:02:09] now I try to enter in as much as much as
[1:02:11] I can but if I'm really Loretta said a
[1:02:13] pre uh Pastor is supposed to be a
[1:02:15] suspicious person brother Brown said
[1:02:17] now I'm always going to amen the truth
[1:02:19] but I always got to go listen back to
[1:02:21] the sermons of the guest preachers and
[1:02:22] be like was that exactly right and my
[1:02:24] wife and I talked about was that exactly
[1:02:25] right
[1:02:26] I got to be that's good that's what God
[1:02:28] made me to be
[1:02:30] I'm supposed to feed you sheep food
[1:02:31] praise God
[1:02:35] but now are they many members yet one
[1:02:38] body
[1:02:39] so we are one body with many members but
[1:02:42] we need each other badly praise God
[1:02:45] now Christian gave me this example I was
[1:02:47] sharing it at uh
[1:02:49] Indiana
[1:02:52] you know it was our precious brother
[1:02:53] who's coming to preach he was one that
[1:02:55] was battling with well should I be a
[1:02:56] preacher can I be a preacher and a
[1:02:58] deacon and I'd told him I don't know
[1:02:59] I'll pray about it and that's when I
[1:03:01] talked to my wife I'm like oh yeah
[1:03:02] Philip was both a deacon and a preacher
[1:03:04] I called brother Brian up he was crying
[1:03:06] rejoicing
[1:03:07] and then that person that was attacking
[1:03:09] him stopped attacking him because the
[1:03:11] Brian had a scripture now
[1:03:13] the guy that was attacking him
[1:03:15] eventually died of cancer for attacking
[1:03:16] other people I don't know it seemed like
[1:03:18] it was connected I don't know
[1:03:20] I showed that to you uh maybe last year
[1:03:22] I think I showed that one of the letters
[1:03:24] he wrote
[1:03:28] oh shut off okay
[1:03:30] go look out there real quick just see if
[1:03:32] sometimes they steal the catalytic
[1:03:33] converters right out here the cops they
[1:03:35] make rounds out here they've told me
[1:03:38] when we were out there that one time
[1:03:40] and then people climb on the roof I
[1:03:42] don't know what they're trying to get on
[1:03:43] the roof
[1:03:45] is there gold up there or something is
[1:03:46] there I don't know Diamonds On The Roof
[1:03:49] somebody hide their box of diamonds up
[1:03:50] there
[1:03:51] I don't know but I just thought it was
[1:03:53] beautiful how my wife you know was
[1:03:54] telling me this and I remember her
[1:03:56] telling me in the van I'm like this such
[1:03:57] a beautiful example
[1:03:58] all those years ago you know um okay
[1:04:03] you know that inspired brother Brian to
[1:04:04] preach now brother Brian has come
[1:04:05] numerous times and God has healed people
[1:04:06] right God's he's blessed people he's
[1:04:08] spoken to our hearts you know and he
[1:04:10] spoke some people out of the church
[1:04:11] which was God
[1:04:13] removing leaven because they were
[1:04:16] criticizing me unfairly
[1:04:18] and they proved it by one of them
[1:04:19] repenting another one still hasn't
[1:04:21] but then brother Brian came this time
[1:04:23] last time
[1:04:24] and he gave a testimony about him being
[1:04:26] healed and the Holy Spirit put on my
[1:04:27] wife's Heart come up for prayer for her
[1:04:28] knee
[1:04:30] and brother brother Brian prayed the
[1:04:32] prayer of faith
[1:04:33] and then my wife was feeling so much
[1:04:35] better the next day and then a couple
[1:04:36] days later it's all gone all gone
[1:04:40] and so God used my wife to bless him and
[1:04:42] then God used him to bless my wife
[1:04:44] that's how it goes
[1:04:47] amen right God uses me to bless you God
[1:04:49] used you to bless me
[1:04:51] we just keep blessing each other over
[1:04:53] and over again and the church said
[1:04:55] I thought that's a beautiful example
[1:04:57] we just bless and encourage one another
[1:05:00] I'm trying to close I really am I didn't
[1:05:02] think I'd preached this long
[1:05:03] so love is the purpose of keeping all
[1:05:04] the commands already though see now
[1:05:06] Church the Lord strengthens you when
[1:05:08] you're isolated with him that's why it's
[1:05:10] so beautiful to be alone with God
[1:05:15] I love this
[1:05:16] Paul said he's he's almost ready to be
[1:05:18] crucified I'm sorry to be beheaded
[1:05:20] he said that my first answer no man
[1:05:22] stood with me
[1:05:24] but all men forsook me
[1:05:26] I pray that God I pray God that it be
[1:05:29] not laid to their charge but I love this
[1:05:30] now look at this at this uh at this uh
[1:05:33] court trial everybody left him all the
[1:05:35] preachers left him all the Christians he
[1:05:37] had nobody on his side he said but
[1:05:39] notwithstanding the Lord stood with me
[1:05:41] and strengthened me
[1:05:44] church when you are all alone and you
[1:05:46] feel like everybody's deserted you just
[1:05:48] remind remind yourself that Jesus is
[1:05:51] with you and Jesus is going to
[1:05:52] strengthen you
[1:05:57] Hallelujah you're right keep telling
[1:05:59] yourself that just like that song says
[1:06:00] preach it to your soul
[1:06:02] I'm going to preach to my soul that it's
[1:06:04] already won praise God
[1:06:07] sometimes God wants to see God sometimes
[1:06:09] sometimes God leaves you to see if
[1:06:10] you'll do that
[1:06:11] will you preach that word to yourself
[1:06:13] will you really believe that
[1:06:14] we can all say we don't always do that
[1:06:17] but we can all say Amen on Wednesday
[1:06:19] night and Sunday morning but can we say
[1:06:21] it on Friday morning
[1:06:22] that's what that's what we need help
[1:06:24] that's what I need help with I need it
[1:06:26] we all need it
[1:06:31] I love this notwithstanding I was not
[1:06:34] alone God was with me and God
[1:06:36] strengthened me through it all
[1:06:38] and I love this the Lord shall deliver
[1:06:39] me from every evil work
[1:06:42] and he will preserve me he'll keep me
[1:06:44] strong unto his Heavenly Kingdom
[1:06:46] because one day I'm have a seat in it
[1:06:48] praise God
[1:06:49] one day you're gonna have inheritance in
[1:06:51] the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:06:53] he's going to preserve you to make sure
[1:06:55] it happens
[1:06:56] even if nobody stands with you he's
[1:06:58] standing with you
[1:07:01] to whom be glory
[1:07:02] forever and ever amen
[1:07:06] so last thing these are the last few
[1:07:08] verses here yeah last few last few
[1:07:12] church this is the whole point of uh
[1:07:14] Christianity as having daily fellowship
[1:07:17] with Christ
[1:07:18] every day
[1:07:20] Paul said now of course this is the
[1:07:21] scripture that tells us we must have
[1:07:22] more church as we see the Rapture
[1:07:24] approaching
[1:07:25] amen okay gather together more as you
[1:07:28] see that day approaching
[1:07:30] I love our Sunday night services I don't
[1:07:32] know about you even though we've been
[1:07:33] doing Sunday school I still love those
[1:07:35] very much we still get to meditate on
[1:07:36] the things of God get to encourage the
[1:07:38] Next Generation you know
[1:07:40] we're really doing it's really a
[1:07:41] wonderful work there
[1:07:43] now think about just thinking about this
[1:07:44] if a church has a Sunday school those
[1:07:46] the sisters are teaching them that's
[1:07:48] good but would you rather have the
[1:07:49] sisters or the pastor teaching them
[1:07:52] I just thought I'd get a little better
[1:07:53] amen than that though I'm just kidding
[1:07:55] I'm just kidding
[1:07:57] sisters eat good too don't get wrong but
[1:07:59] they're not pastors
[1:08:01] they're not preachers
[1:08:02] so it works out if nobody feels LED it
[1:08:04] totally works out that they get that
[1:08:06] time with the pastor go with me
[1:08:08] and with all of our adults who give the
[1:08:10] good insight and the good testimonies
[1:08:12] and the good scriptures and it just
[1:08:13] really works out good by God's grace
[1:08:16] now if you don't think you need this
[1:08:17] daily fellowship with Jesus and his
[1:08:19] people then you really don't know what
[1:08:21] you're up against
[1:08:23] if you think you can get by without
[1:08:24] daily talking with Jesus and daily
[1:08:27] confessing your sins you don't even you
[1:08:29] don't understand that all of hell is
[1:08:31] against you
[1:08:34] I've had people call me up recently
[1:08:36] about
[1:08:36] doubting the message
[1:08:38] and why are all these people around
[1:08:39] brother Branham such failures because
[1:08:41] that's where Satan is pointing all his
[1:08:42] guns
[1:08:44] you don't got a point at the Roman
[1:08:45] Catholic Church
[1:08:48] he's going to attack the people that
[1:08:50] were closest
[1:08:51] Martin Luther said I wish ten percent I
[1:08:53] wish 10 of my Converse were still here I
[1:08:56] wish
[1:08:58] 10 percent
[1:08:59] that's who Satan attacks the most
[1:09:02] is the people right around the truth
[1:09:04] so we better make sure we got the seal
[1:09:06] the Holy Ghost and I'm confident people
[1:09:08] have it here tonight by God's grace
[1:09:10] because you're still standing with the
[1:09:12] saith the Lord praise God the Bible I'm
[1:09:15] talking about the Bible
[1:09:16] and the statements wrote around made
[1:09:17] with thus saith the Lord in the Bible
[1:09:20] see we're up against the very Gates and
[1:09:23] councils of hell
[1:09:24] Satan is very smart he gets more
[1:09:26] powerful influence every day we will
[1:09:29] either destroy our enemy
[1:09:31] or enemy will destroy us
[1:09:34] somebody's going to die here it ain't
[1:09:36] gonna be me
[1:09:37] Hallelujah
[1:09:39] someone's going to get beaten it ain't
[1:09:40] going to be me it's gonna be the devil
[1:09:44] he's going to leave me for a season amen
[1:09:46] hallelujah praise God Amen he will lead
[1:09:49] me for a season I'll enjoy the blessings
[1:09:51] of Victory amen hallelujah I'm going to
[1:09:53] join the blessings of a battle one
[1:09:57] because that's what they did the Bible
[1:09:58] said they they daily stayed in the
[1:09:59] fellowship with the preachers they broke
[1:10:02] bread they prayed they went from house
[1:10:04] to house
[1:10:06] breaking bread and they ate their meat
[1:10:08] with gladness and singing this out we're
[1:10:10] gonna have that next week at our house
[1:10:12] you're welcome to come to our house and
[1:10:13] let's break some bread amen let's have
[1:10:16] some fellowship praise God
[1:10:17] Hallelujah they praise God had favor
[1:10:19] with all the people
[1:10:20] and the Lord added to the church daily
[1:10:23] such as should be saved see our weekly
[1:10:25] meetings are meant to stimulate every
[1:10:27] day fellowship with Christ
[1:10:29] Wednesday and Sunday is to encourage you
[1:10:31] to have time with God on Thursday Friday
[1:10:33] Saturday Tuesday and Monday praise God
[1:10:37] like ain't that great to be a Christian
[1:10:39] every day of the week
[1:10:40] the Bible said take heed church we are
[1:10:43] going to get evil Hearts unless we build
[1:10:45] each other up every day
[1:10:48] and you and you you've got to build
[1:10:50] yourself up every day every day we've
[1:10:52] got to build ourselves up or else our
[1:10:54] hearts are going to get hardened
[1:10:56] in other words every day water the seed
[1:10:57] water the seed if not it's going to dry
[1:11:00] out and get hard
[1:11:02] you that's what the Bible says exhort
[1:11:04] one another while it's called today you
[1:11:07] will partake of Christ if you hold the
[1:11:09] beginning of your confidence steadfast
[1:11:11] into the end
[1:11:14] see while it's today hear his voice have
[1:11:16] you heard God's voice today
[1:11:18] yes because you heard the word of God
[1:11:20] but see every day that's why I can put a
[1:11:22] good sermon on from Brother Brooks right
[1:11:23] I can put amen sermon on now Hallelujah
[1:11:28] and you can hear the voice of God speak
[1:11:31] to you when it comes to the word of God
[1:11:34] that's exactly right
[1:11:36] now I put this on here I thought about
[1:11:38] this I could send everybody a daily
[1:11:39] video every morning because we have
[1:11:41] group text right
[1:11:43] and that'd be encouraging for a while
[1:11:45] but there's going to be a day where you
[1:11:46] forget to check that check that text
[1:11:49] and there might be two days in a row or
[1:11:51] three days or four days when you don't
[1:11:52] watch my video now I could do that right
[1:11:54] I could do that
[1:11:56] so what do you need you need a you need
[1:11:58] to feel the pull of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:59] every single day drawing you into
[1:12:01] Fellowship
[1:12:02] you need to build that expectation that
[1:12:05] relationship with Christ where every day
[1:12:07] you want to feel his presence
[1:12:10] now what does the word exhort mean I'm
[1:12:11] closing musicians can come
[1:12:13] exhort one another daily encourage
[1:12:16] strengthen
[1:12:17] receive strength be comforted let's
[1:12:20] stand our feet yeah sorry
[1:12:23] to instruct and teach so every day we
[1:12:26] should instruct receive instruction and
[1:12:28] teaching from the Lord every single day
[1:12:31] and encourage one another as well when
[1:12:33] we can
[1:12:35] now if you if enough of you want it I'll
[1:12:37] do some daily text if you want to do
[1:12:39] that
[1:12:40] I went 177 days straight on Facebook
[1:12:43] posting I kept count I just saw the
[1:12:45] reminder the other day and I'm like okay
[1:12:47] I don't see much fruit to this so I'm
[1:12:49] going to stop oh and then they kick
[1:12:50] Trump off of Facebook so I got off of
[1:12:52] Facebook
[1:12:54] because I just want to make a stand
[1:12:55] against it now they're going down you
[1:12:56] see that that's good that's good so we
[1:12:58] had we had a little bit of impact on
[1:12:59] that
[1:13:00] by God's grace
[1:13:03] I still don't think Trump is safe I
[1:13:04] don't think Trump is a Christian I'm
[1:13:06] just making the point
[1:13:07] but the Bible says we should daily
[1:13:09] strengthen one another
[1:13:12] daily exhort one another in other words
[1:13:13] receive strength from somebody
[1:13:15] and of course receive strength from
[1:13:17] Jesus how many want Jesus's strength
[1:13:19] praise God
[1:13:21] how many want to be isolated with Christ
[1:13:23] amen now we're all going to go through
[1:13:25] the other isolations but how many want
[1:13:27] to be isolated with Jesus praise God
[1:13:29] that's our desire let's bow our heads
[1:13:30] here for a moment
[1:13:32] how many enjoyed the word of God tonight
[1:13:34] praise God

[1:14:32] help you foreign

[1:14:37] some of you might feel like God has left
[1:14:39] you and you feel like you're being
[1:14:41] tested
[1:14:43] the thing to do like Jeremiah said is

[1:14:53] that no evil thought come out of your
[1:14:54] mouth

[1:15:02] you're in that real sacred Place praise
