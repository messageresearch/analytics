[6:56] hurry and then I hope not because I got
[6:59] more here than I could probably get out

[7:13] one of these days we'll be out of this
[7:15] old time body that we're stuck in we can
[7:16] just Rejoice forever and ever and ever
[7:18] that just seem like a moment amen
[7:21] amen but tonight I'll try to keep it
[7:23] within a moment in time that we can all
[7:26] amen endure amen let's put it that way
[7:29] amen last night we looked in 1st Samuel
[7:31] and we looked at the thought in 1 Samuel
[7:33] how that uh we we took the thought
[7:35] hither to the Lord have helped us hither
[7:37] too I preached this in our church amen a
[7:39] few months ago I don't remember how many
[7:41] months ago in our church but amen I I
[7:43] felt led of the Lord to preach that here
[7:45] last night and I believe it was the way
[7:46] that God the Lord wanted us to go but in
[7:49] that scripture Samuel amen talks to the
[7:51] people of God and he talks to him about
[7:53] amen turning to the Lord and getting the
[7:55] victory by turning back to the Lord how
[7:56] many knows we did we looked at that and
[7:58] he said when you put away the strange
[8:00] God among you and prepare your hearts
[8:02] unto the Lord and serve him only he will
[8:04] deliver you from the enemy amen that's a
[8:06] that's a promise from God righten as
[8:09] brother Mike said tonight in his prayer
[8:10] he says he's no respector of persons
[8:13] he'll do the same for you if you'll do
[8:15] the same for him how many believe that
[8:17] and we know the Bible tells us down
[8:19] there in 1st Samuel 7:4 said the
[8:21] children did put away the god they did
[8:23] start worshiping the Lord they did come
[8:25] under the under the word of the Prophet
[8:27] for that hour they did what he said to
[8:28] do
[8:30] amen and he offered up a s a sacrifice
[8:32] for their sin it was the bleeding lamb
[8:34] how many knows it was the truth amen how
[8:36] many bleedings like we said last night
[8:38] it's bleeding lamb that offered for us
[8:39] too amen and he offered up the bleeding
[8:42] lamb he poured out the water upon the
[8:44] ground there were Washed by the Water of
[8:46] the word and the blood of the Lamb amen
[8:49] hallelujah and we realize then they went
[8:51] to battle amen the enemy was still there
[8:54] but when they went to battle they
[8:55] realized amen that God had kept his word
[8:59] they turned to him when they repented of
[9:01] their sin God fought their battle God
[9:03] fought the enemy God destroyed the
[9:05] Philistines from before them they didn't
[9:07] have to do it amen
[9:10] hallelujah amen well that's that's
[9:12] yesterday's Glory but it still excites
[9:13] me
[9:15] today
[9:17] amen he said when they there and he says
[9:19] when they realized that the enemy was
[9:21] fighting their battle amen and that they
[9:23] didn't have to fight they pursued the
[9:25] enemy rather than the enemy pursuing
[9:27] them like we said last night amen you
[9:29] don't flee from the devil you resist the
[9:32] devil and he will flee from you he says
[9:34] and the enemy began to flee from them
[9:36] when they resisted him by the power of
[9:38] God Amen and the enemy began to flee and
[9:42] the people when they realized the enemy
[9:44] was fleeing they pursued the devil I
[9:46] pursue that devil where did he do it
[9:48] right on my knees right in this word
[9:50] every day I pursue him amen what's my
[9:52] weapon prayer what's my weapon the word
[9:55] what's my weapon faith in that word
[9:57] brother said take that weapon of the
[9:58] word of God in the strong hand of faith
[10:00] and cut your way to
[10:02] Victory amen how many want to do that
[10:07] tonight amen I better watch it I'll get
[10:09] off of my I'm not even preaching my
[10:11] message tonight amen but when those
[10:14] people began to realize that they had
[10:16] the victory amen when they begin to
[10:19] realize that they had the victory amen I
[10:21] want you to know it what it said there
[10:23] and I'm going to go back to what we
[10:24] preached last night in 1st Samuel 7:11
[10:26] it said the men of Israel went out of
[10:28] mispa and they pursued the Philistines
[10:30] and smoked them until they came unto
[10:33] bethar how many remember what bethar
[10:36] means oh church if you remember oh write
[10:39] it down put it on the fridge amen it
[10:41] said they pursued him until they came
[10:43] under bethar what's it mean to come
[10:46] under bethcar that word bethar am me

[10:51] lambs it means the house of exaltation
