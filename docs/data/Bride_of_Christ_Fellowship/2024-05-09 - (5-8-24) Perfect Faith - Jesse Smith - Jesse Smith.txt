TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Lord such beautiful lyrics Lord it just takes us back to why we are saved because of the Cross Hallelujah it reminds us we'll always remember Lord as even Revelation 5 shows these 24 Elders they got these beautiful crowns but yet when the lamb walks out they throw the crowns down at the feet of the Lamb they'll always remember Calvary Lord God and so we remember it tonight Lord God that you died for our sins you make us blameless spotless without rebuke Hallelujah you did that Lord God it's your Amazing Grace we're Justified as we would like to be Hallelujah forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ forgiven all trespasses Hallelujah the scripture says Lord there's no one that can condemn us who shall lay any charge to God's elect we thank you Lord for that and we know your elect because we've responded to your word Lord God we know that can't happen unless Lord You've ordained it you predestinated Lord God that we could you given us the gift of faith Hallelujah given us the gift of Grace Lord God we thank you for Amazing Grace we come humbly tonight Lord God bless your word bless the reading of Thy word Lord Jesus let these words sink down into our hearts Lord God use us God For Your Glory we thank you Lord God have your way here tonight in Jesus Christ's name Saints said amen God bless you let's take our Bibles here tonight thank you musicians appreciate that let's go to Mark chapter 11 here by the grace of the Lord I'd like to continue on this little series of uh songs that we've been sorry sermons that we've beening singing in that song so I'm going to preach on perfect Faith tonight by God's grace Mark 11 22 Mark 1122 trust everybody's had a good week in the Lord by God's grace hallelujah it's good to see the Saints again amen hallelujah this might be a part one we'll kind of see how this goes here tonight you know voice seems to go slower than what I think it's going to go it's kind of the nature of the preaching by God's grace so Mark 11:22 here I'll read 22 uh and then we could all read 23 and then after that I'll do 24 25 and 26 so the main verse we' like to read is 23 together by God's so I'll start with 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God let's read 23 1 2 3 for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen I just thought while we're praying here or reading that I just thought of Zechariah so I'm write that down where he uh he spoke to the Mount right told the mountain be thou removed so interesting Zechariah would tell rub this mountain shall be removed but it wasn't a mountain Hallelujah that would probably play into the word of God here verse 25 I'm sorry verse 24 therefore I say to you whatsoever things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive brother man will tell us later in this sermon faith is based on forgiveness wasn't it very timing you know brother Brooks preached that little message there forgiveness what a wonderful message by God's grace if ye have all against any so if you have anything against anybody and you're standing there praying forgive them as you're praying right as you're standing there worshiping God or you're here in the house of God if you have anything against anybody let Let It Go by God's grace forgive them Hallelujah if you need to go talk to that person then go talk to them by God's grace you know there's some things that we don't have to go confess to people if it's you know something maybe small that they did or something like that if they really hurt you you can't get over something then yes you want to definitely go talk to them by God's grace I think as we mature as Christians we understand when we need to do that don't you think that by God's grace Hallelujah that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses so what a lesson that is God will not forgive us until we forgive others think about that someone could say I'm sorry God forgive me God a hundred times and God will withhold that forgiveness until that person forgive somebody else there's that no doubt that's why many people come to church they ask God for forgiveness and they don't even feel it right they don't feel forgiven because in their hearts they know they've got to forgive someone God will withhold that feeling of forgiveness and that's why no doubt people can't have joy people can't have uh Victory many times because they don't forgive verse 26 but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses they God add his Blessing to read his word may be seated praise God so again I'm going to hit the highlights here by the God's grace you know I couldn't I couldn't uh it would take me weeks and weeks just to preach one sermon if I preached all the quotes what I'm hoping you've done if you haven't done it yet is you've gone listen to recognizing your day in this message I hope somebody's done that by God's grace and I hope maybe somebody's listened to serpent seed 1958 I sure enjoyed that last week that was such a blessing that message now here of course perfect Fai it's a short message I think it's only an hour and 40 minutes you know it's not going to take you forever to get through it's a beautiful message I listen to it numerous times and uh I'm going to hit the highlights here again we'll see if we do one part or maybe two parts here by God's grace brother Ram starts off the opening prayer by saying we've assembled together to only believe just believe the Lord Jesus there are those here tonight who are sick and Afflicted and we've dedicated our service tonight to the healing of the sick and broken body and then he finishes the prayer he said' Grant it Lord and help us as we look to the word now now look look to the word to find Faith sufficient for this hour we ask it in Jesus name so just a good reminder you know the reason we're in a service is so that we can find faith in that word that we're going to hear that night you know the reason you were here Sunday was to hear what brother Keith was preaching so you could receive something from that sermon Hallelujah same thing down there you know in uh Junction City I'll just share a little bit uh after the service you I was wondering why I was preaching the message I was preaching I have I had a real hard time knowing what to preach sometimes I know exactly what I'm going to preach other times I feel like I'm just wandering in the dark you know I I don't even know what to say Sunday was one of those times I didn't know what to preach I just had no idea um I preached on but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel I just was preaching a Ministry teaching more or a service on brother R's Ministry I went a lot through Revelation 10 and I got to the end you know and it wasn't Extremely Loud service or W I felt more free as the service went on but I didn't see anything Supernatural maybe going on until we started the prayer line at the end and then I said uh you who has need of requests and there was many people numerous people I should say many there's numerous people come up for prayer they're a small Church like us right but numerous people come up for prayer but then two people in a row had dreams just that week about witnessing to specific people in their family and they come up weeping and crying and the whole point of my message was it's our turn to eat the book Revelation 10 is brother braham's Ministry is done now we eat the book and I just emphasized a few times over the course of that sermon you know you're going to eat the book right and it's sweet in your mouth in other words it's lovely to talk about right but it's something else to become one with that word it's bitter right it's not easy to digest right it's not it's not easy to live all this these wonderful Revelations that we're hearing and so I emphasize that numerous times it's our duty now you know it's we've got a responsibility we've got to eat the open book John literally didn't fulfill uh taking the gospel Revelation 1011 he didn't fulfill that he didn't travel much after the a Patmos and then he died as an old man you know we know the story uh the disciple of Love they called him you know at the end of his life he was saying oh children he couldn't preach anymore and they just say John you want to say something from the back maybe he say little children love one another that's what history says about John brother R repeats it numerous times you hear him say that kind of like how John Wesley died and the last things he said I told you that was uh the best part of all is that God is with us remember think of that his last words he said the best thing is God is with us and the soul went to meet Christ amen what a testimony and then he was with Christ Hallelujah forever for eternity in a brand new body Hallelujah as one of the stars in the hands of Jesus Hallelujah and so you know I just thought and then you know to see them cry to see the sincerity my wife even remarked afterwards you know just to see these people are so sincere you know they're they're at the they're at the fresh stages of coming the message right they've been in the message one year you think about when you were in the message one year you know we'd all have to go back to that what was that like you know when there was explosion of Revelation in every service you know there was fireworks every service oh oh man serpent seed non- eternal hell water baptism godhead you know Divine Healing Miracles you know all the revelations anointed ones of the end time you know marriage and divorce it was every service was a firework service I know that's how was for me you know uh but to see them come up and they're praying Lord we want to see and there a lot of them are being rejected by family right now and persecuted now I need to put that sermon out maybe I'll do that tomorrow morning before work or something like that I just keep forgetting to do that um but it was just such a wonderful thing you know in other words they didn't let the service go by without seeing how does this apply to my life and they came up for prayer and I said ABS I said absolutely I believe with all my heart those dreams were from God you know uh because it's they were praying and it in the case it was sisters that wanted to speak now that's something right because sisters uh they the devil might make them feel oh you're just trying to preach what a but it's a testimony it's not a preaching it's a testimony right and so these these sisters wanted to go share with different family members testimonies right about the message and God I believe God is leading them to do that praise God and I just shared with them I said you know I believe that's of God you just wait on God I said maybe you'll write a letter I've done that with numerous people I've shared the message through letters if they won't talk on the phone or they won't talk to me at all I said just watch it I said now watch it remember this prayer because it might be a few years down the road with the Lord teres where they might get to witness that family member right my wife and I we told you we had dreams and maybe it wasn't until a year later two year two years later few I I told Brother Brooks about that dream I I told you about the man playing tennis he's like that's right I forgot about that he said no doubt that was fulfilled but it took years you know it took a few years to get to that point but our Point as I said is that we want to look to the word tonight to receive Faith sufficient for this hour Hallelujah brother Ram say now it's not too often we get to do these healing Services because usually now brother says usually the holy spirit will come around when there's an emergency case and discern it right quick and pick out something about something and then say it he said but I believe in Healing The Sick I believe it's a Bible command uh case you put up uh Mark 1618 we cannot preach that without the Full Gospel without including that so the gospel means good news Jesus did not just go around teaching all the time he healed the sick hallelujah it's part of the Gospel they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen so brother man said it's a Bible command we've got to do that we've got to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Hallelujah now before brother M gets to the text he says uh now he talks about how people have been TR driving many miles to hear his sermons he said many of you will be waiting over to the morning that's got a long distance to go and I appreciate that effort some of you will drive home tonight cuz you got to go to work by daylight in the morning I know it's hard and then when I think he said I see that he said I get spells too you know you know I get moody anybody ever know brother R got Moody I get moody I get to a spot where what gets me is where I get those spells when I get all overworked anybody feel stressed out from work this week and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you haven't got a friend in the world see so brother ad could see a pattern of his life every time I get overworked Satan comes in he tells me the same thing over and over again nobody loves you nobody cares about you you don't got a friend in the world nobody in this whole world even cares about you Hallelujah he said you're not alone he said we all go through that he said remember I'm not immune to Temptation see I got to overcome that but then when I looked back and see something like this he's talking about people driving up from Georgia to hear one sermon in Indiana from Georgia I think it was eight hours he said eight hours for one sermon some of us got I got to drive 25 minutes to church he said I put that right back in his face Satan and say what about that he said that helps me to overcome what about that Satan hallelujah praise God Amen so see church when Satan lies to you you got to find something to put back in his face this proves you're wrong Satan Hallelujah so we all get moody we all get discouraged we all go through Temptations but the whole point of that is so you'll overcome that remember God allowed you to go through these things so you would overcome God allowed Satan to whisper that in your ear right he had to get permission so find a way to overcome find a good scripture tonight to overcome Hallelujah and then brother R reads this text as we read before brother ra takes this this text he says now let's turn in now into that blessed Bible anybody open up your blessed Bible this morning and read it it's a bless it'll be a blessing to you if you do I want to read a passage that used to just turn me around we just thinking about being picked up and turn around well this is a different turn around that's a turnar around when you get saved Hallelujah brother said reading the Bible used to turn him around in other words I don't understand what's going on he said uh and then he says uh that was he said when I spoke this he said when God had me speak the seven squirrels into existence he said that was the very scripture I was thinking on Mark 11:22 it's always been a puzzle anybody ever had any puzzles in the Bible you read the Bible looks like a puzzle all scattered about pieces are all over the place he said if ye say not if I say if you say so that's what puzzled brother brandom where Jesus would say if you speak to the mountain it will move move right now of course if you know the context earlier in in Mark 11 the context is Jesus went up to a fig tree this is right before he passed away right sorry right before he was crucified rather and he he went to get a fruit off and it wasn't even in in season it was out of season and there was no fig there and he says no man eat of this tree from Hereafter he basically cursed the tree and you know some people might be confused about that but it's it's this idea idea of this fig tree represents Israel right the Fig Tree represents Israel so Jesus came to Israel to get some fruit to get some Believers am but they weren't producing right and really uh it it was a very good type of their Jesus coming to Israel and they had no fruit to give but God wanted fruit right God wanted fruit and since they didn't have fruit God cursed them right God the blood curse to come upon them that's why the Holocaust happened that's why they're still battling now of course there's a ceasefire now thank God for that we'll see how that goes but it's a type of Israel and then they go into Jerusalem they come out and the disciples see ma it's withered already just wasn't very long maybe it was a day I think it was wasn't very long at all and they're said my how how how powerful this is and this is the context where Jesus says if you say to the mountain and don't doubt you'll have what you asked for right Hallelujah and that's what turned brother Bram around he's like not not if God says but if you say hallelujah now I'm sure you already know the balance to this because you've already I'm sure you've already tried at some point to name it and claim it haven't we all as young Christians right you know you know as a new Christian you know God will answer some amazing prayers right we'll become new Christians I think of Austin and myself you know God did these great prayers and then we think well what else could God do which is it's okay okay thing to think but it's immature like like you know we I witnessed in one Souls right away when I got saved and I'm just like wow I'm going to win some more souls this person's going to come in this person no doubt this person will see it well if I just speak it but they don't come in just because I speak it it's got to be led of God hallelujah it all comes back to that praise God hallelujah this is what brother Ram learned of course and so we see that now hold your spot there I do want to read that in Zechariah because that just no man all these years man did I forget this Zechariah Chapter 4 amazing how I mean I just if I forgot that Lord forgive me that this is what the Bible says Doctrine must be built line upon line precept upon precept here a little there little Isaiah 28 Whom Shall God teach Doctrine the Bible said Whom Shall he wean from the breast right in other words who will be a child of God elhadi that could be there's more to study on that but Shad means breast and God came to Abraham as the elhadi the breasted one according to scoffield so God was telling Abraham you got a nurse you got to be real close to me you got to nurse your strength from me Hallelujah and then Isaiah says who's going to learn the doctrine it's those who come close to God and draw their strength from God hallelujah but like like a mother knows or anyone who's seen a baby they don't just drink all the time or they just don't pull all the time they they got to have little breaks right they got to have breaks I think I know what I'm talking about I've had eight children I think you just can't drink all night you know and uh they got to have a little break so it's here a little there a little they wake up in the I know this for sure they'll wake up in the middle of night and want a nurse you know I know that for sure I've shared my bed for 20 years huah with babies they' woke me up many time even this little this big guy down here not not a little guy anymore and so God gives this this picture this is what it's like to understand God's word you got to feed a little bit on God's word here a little bit of there a little bit of there hallelujah amen this whole time did I forget this my forgive me Lord if I forgot this but Zechariah Chapter 4 because I I know I preached it before that it's not necessarily speaking of mountains now if you were in the Old Testament or something like that or you needed a mountain moved or some physical thing mov yes you could they'd speak to the mountain it even happened in the New Testament right uh Paul and Barnabas uh were in the prison right and they just sang they just prayed and it shook the jail and the jail was broken up and the prisoners were set free Hallelujah a natural Mountain Moving Hallelujah a natural mountain and even Jesus speaking of that fig tree it's the same thing right it's a mountain moving it's an obstacle moving something's happening instantaneously praise God hallelujah Zechariah 4 now yeah there it is verse uh verse six then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord un iserable saying not by mind not by power but by my spirit sayi the Lord of hosts so how do mountains move by the Holy Spirit not by our thinking not by our power if I can just work myself enough enough faith of that's impossible you can't work it you don't even have any faith Hallelujah you've only got a natural faith we got to have the Faith of Christ Hallelujah I can already tell this going to be a part one Hallelujah this ain't going to get I'm not going to finish these no who art thou oh great mountain and he's talking about he's talking about the political forces that were making Israel afraid of finishing the temple remember they had a they had a they were working hard they built the altar right but then they started building the Temple and they got letters from the government and they're afraid so they stopped building for 16 years and how is God going to get them to start building again he's got to send prophets amen amen he's got to send somebody with thus sayith the Lord hallelujah what gets you going when you hear a scripture you forgot about amen when somebody preaches something you know God's talking to you that causes you to believe the word of God and the Bible said they prospered through the prophecy of heah and Zechariah amen what s you up only the word s you up praise God like just like them he says before he said oh great Mountain he said before Zub Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone that was the top of the temple right the last Stone in the temple with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it a double portion of favor hallelujah praise God more favor but and I preached that sermon last year remember I preached this uh uh uh Grace Grace yeah the head head Shone shouting Grace Grace and it's just double favor it's like a double anointing Hallelujah Glory Elisha had a double anointing so he said he did double miracles in Elijah Hallelujah and brother man types this last Stone as Jesus coming back because remember he's a stone that comes back like Daniel chapter 2 he's a stone that comes down and he strikes the image at the feet he's a stone he's a precious Cornerstone amen and it comes down with Grace Grace but here we can see a pattern how many can see a pattern how many can see the pattern if you speak to the mountain if you speak to the obstacle and it's God leading you to do it it's going to move Hallelujah all right now back to Mark 8 Mark 11 sorry now brother man says now faith is based on forgiveness because we read that it's also in James 5:15 so in case you when never ready uh pull that up now look what brother man says uh brother Dennis McBride used this quote a couple years ago when he was preaching it wasn't this last time uh it was a coule a couple years ago brother R said we're trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us how many want that where you're excited to come to church right now we're all going to battle but we all know there sometimes we're more excited than others oh I know brother Brooks is in town I know I'll get there you know I'll be more excited during the service right that's the pastor you know the pastor's always there you know so I understand I want you to be excited for brother I want you to be more excited for brother Brooks than me okay I I want that I'm here all the time um but here Apostolic times though is the fear of the Lord that's what I'm talking about the fear of God where we know God's moving and we don't want to miss what God's doing we don't we don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit praise God we want to be ready for the spirit of God to move Hallelujah like we uh like I think it was uh sister Nomi that put that text in there for the group you know we needed a dance service after all the legal things you know just the fears you know it was like attacks of the devil you know it really was I know I was going to bed fearful I know I had to quote the scripture just to go to bed a season of fear and then and then on top of that the identity theft and all these things it was an awful month it was aw uh but thank God it's over Hallelujah by God's grace by God's grace by God's grace you never know what these some of these people but he says now we want to see Apostolic times Among Us that were all hunger for it's just laying right at the door see but we want to see more of it we want to see such a a flow that it'll be a help to us and flow out to others amen I like that see so when we're on fire for God we want to see God flow in our lives and then bless somebody else as well Amen in other words I want to see God use this old bag of bones can I just quote that song that we sang earlier God use this bag of bones Hallelujah just use this old uh pest house brother BR calls it use me flow out of me flow through me Holy Spirit Hallelujah we sing that song flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me as I lift my hands to worship and magnify the name flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me hallelujah amen it's that that's what we're talking about Apostolic times so that's what brother M's prayer is before he starts I'm sorry a statement right before he starts preaching on this now uh brother R says I want to preach you on a different type of Faith he says perfect Faith Hallelujah he said that's a great thing now we're told in the Bible Faith cometh by hearing you cannot be saved with without faith faith is something you have to have to believe it's there that not that really nothing else will declare it it's there but Faith now I'm trying to bring you bring Faith to you so that you can be ready for this prayer line in the next few minutes so in a healing service brother R is specifically preaching on faith to raise their faith so that when we pray God can move but remember in the in we always know with wisdom of God it's still got to be God's time and season right it's always got to be God's time and season but as I've told you before I believe it's over 90 some per of the time God wants to move in many in in sick cases I'm talking about when people are sick right like even with brother Phil who would have thought God did over eight miracles for him with just your prayers I mean make a guess how long did you pray for Phil when I sent that text did you did you pray a minute I don't know maybe you know but think you know God and then he he he says thank the church for praying for me so see it it don't have to be an hourong prayer now if God leads you to that wonderful but God sees the sincerity of our hearts hallelujah it's the quality Hallelujah if we're if we're if we don't have a lot of time then God looks at the quality of it Hallelujah but see the the preaching of the word that's something I want to grow in too you know I'm as I told you I'm I'm I'm a teacher many times you know in a pastor of course I want to uh I think these sermons help help me also get my thoughts on the supernatural as well Hallelujah so I want to be able to preach that Hallelujah by God's grace brother R said now Faith he that cometh to God must believe that he is that's Hebrews 11 and it's impossible to please God without faith you cannot please him now remember faith is Assurance Church Assurance that's the actual meaning of it you cannot please God without assurance that God hears you where God sees you and it Assurance is a substance that's what faith is it's a substance and brother says nothing else declares it does your clothes today or Malachi and Austin got a nice haircut does your haircut declare faith is that does that declare Faith No just your shirt or your shoes or does that no you have no proof of it the only proof you have is inside of you amen the only proof is that you know something inside of me believes God I'm trusting God Amen and that's why good Services help stir that up Hallelujah CU we'll go throughout the day we'll forget about what we believe we'll forget about our promises that we're holding on to Hallelujah we'll forget about the future we forget about God's word and all these things and so we need reminders to stir up that Faith Hallelujah get it moving amen that's right because it's an invisible thing it's the spirit of God inside of us it's a substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen how do you know you're saved well I don't have any proof outside I just got faith inside how do you know you're going in the Rapture I can't produce anything to tell you that I've just got a faith on the inside I believe it's for me Hallelujah it I can't show it to you really now you can get a clue by watching my life you can see the fruits of my life that gives a good that gives a good clue he you know he or she may go in the Rapture praise God but it's nothing that I can't prove it to you it's a substance and you cannot please God until you've got that substance amen and you cannot get that substance until you receive it by a gift of Grace amen be like I'm reaching out pull him up out of the pit amen that's what the word pit mean pull him out of the pit Hallelujah save them amen God save our faith Hallelujah Glory now brother man said now these are real deep lessons here he says and I'll catch the top of it then you dig down in it see so if you want to go deeper in perfect Faith go listen to this sermon and listen to it slowly right I've listen to it while I drove to that funeral a couple weeks ago I listened to it while I was mowed the grass listen to in the drive to work you I've just listened to it over and over again he said these are deep lessons and you'll catch the top of it then dig down in it okay so brother admits I can only hit the highlights and you've got to go down and dig down in these scriptures Hallelujah I love that amen I love what brother R said brother R said any man that says he's got all the answers he said watch that man he's a false prophet he said only Jesus has all the answers right and then I'm talking about the spirit of Jesus the body of Jesus doesn't even know the day or the hour right I'm talking about the spirit of Jesus knows all things Hallelujah because you understand by God's grace the scripture all right now I'm just going to read these because I think they're important I don't want to skip over them here hallelujah now if you could see Jesus it would be no more faith because your faith has now become sight right faith is a substance of things not seen right so these are important points to point out he said see anything that the senses declares it's no more faith it's a scientific fact see it's no more faith but you have to accept him by faith he that cometh to God Must Believe God and faith comes by hearing the word of God Amen what what just what a simple reminder it is for us if we want to receive from God if we want to please God we just got to believe what God says and there even if there's no evidence just believe the word hallelujah just believe the word and then God as brother said God will lead you to believe all the things that he wants for your life hallelujah amen everything that God wants for you he'll lead you to believe it amen you had to lead Abraham and Sarah to believe no it's for Sarah not just Hagar it's for Sarah Hallelujah he led them to believe it Hallelujah it's Honey in the Rock Hallelujah he said you must first believe God's word and you must come to God by the word just take the word what it says say that's right everything else is contrary to it is not right Abraham had to believe just what the voice told him and when he's 100 years old 25 years later he was Stronger believing it than he was 25 years ago when it was given to him he believed it he staggered not the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving God praise notice brother is quoting the scripture that helps him overcome his depression too remember I read you that quote every time I'm feeling a little blue what do you read brother R Romans chapter 4 Abraham stagger not the promise of God but he was strong in faith giving God praise got any strong Saints in here tonight by God's grace I saw you I saw your praising God we have some strong Saints in here hallelujah you may not feel like it but you give God praise anyway Hallelujah that's strong faith I don't see any effects to it I don't see the mountain moving yet but I believe God's going to move it Hallelujah God is able to perform what he's promised he said but you have to be in a position to have that faith and that's what we're going to talk on see to receive that Faith he says faith is the substance of things hoped for now here's where many people fail to receive their healing and what they're asking for because they take Faith to be something that it's not it's not an imagination it's an actual substance Hallelujah now listen real close it's not what you imagine it's just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else it's just as real as my eyes say this is a piece of paper it's just as real as to say that that is a light brother starts pointing things out in the church it's just that real now see here's where we're going to get down to some maturity right because if we've got faith and faith means a revelation then we've got to be absolutely sure it is what it is amen we got to be absolutely sure we know it's God's word that's why I love those words if the Lord willing because if I don't know I'm going to say if the Lord is willing and that's a that's an okay thing to say that's what the Bible says don't don't just say well I'm going to move there next year and make a certain amount of money in James he said say if the Lord willing I'm going to go do that right you want God to bless you and ultimately what we want is God's will right but we must look to the will of God first brother BR said' it's just as real as I feel my coat or as I hear that baby somebody some baby cries and he says I hear that baby talking back there that's a baby's talk right it's crying it's making its noise see it's just as real as that music Malachi was playing it's just as real is I taste anything in my mouth it's that real only you can't show it to somebody else right it's like say Malachi can't you see my faith can't you see what I believe can't you see that I believe I'm going in the Rapture he can't see it he can't feel it neither can I but alls I know is it's inside of me praise God that's what faith is it's a revelation hallelujah how do you know you're saved I just know it amen I it's inside of me praise God hallelujah it's just that real amen you you have it alone it's yours faith is a substance it's not a myth brother man said these are deep things he says these are deep lessons notice it's something you possess you already have it you really have it it's just as real as you're riding in an automobile it's just as real as you're sitting in the church it's just as real as you hear my voice it's not in Emotion not an imagination it's something you have it comes to you by hearing the word of God now see church now that put it that puts it on us if we're lacking a revelation we've got to hear the word of God with a more sincere heart right and many times that comes by first we got to hear the word of God then we've got to act upon it and we got to obey it because remember the Bible says if we just hear the scriptures if we just hear the sermons of brother Keith but we don't act on what it says then we deceive ourselves so it comes back to that we got to hear the word of God we've got to act on it right and in doing that we'll get a revelation of God's word Glory he said Faith Comes by hearing hearing the word of God that puts it back to where your faith then is it's not some individual it's not in a man it's not in an organization it's not a group of people it's in God because God is the word see you so then it comes down to this if Keith prayed for you on Sunday or if I prayed for you or brother Diggs or anyone uh brother Brooks if anyone's prayed for you your faith is not in them your faith is in the word of God and brother R tell us at the end of the sermon he said all I am is an intercessor I'm holding up your request to God asking God to minister to your needs amen he said but I'm not the one your faith isn't in me your faith is in the one who answers prayer Hallelujah your faith is the one who gave you the gift of faith hallelujah amen now uh let me read this here he said now Faith is a substance and in there we find out in Hebrews 11 what faith was and what those did that had Faith there's many times that people have faith today and tomorrow they haven't got it okay so that's where we've got to watch ourselves right because then is it really a faith or not if we don't have it tomorrow then it wasn't faith it was a hope so right everybody understand that he says and something else but when God once anchors it you see there's nothing ever going to make you move from it you're just poking or reaching or presuming to presume is to venture without Authority you're just trying this and trying that and going this way and that's what I've told you before with Divine Healing when amen asked me that question a few years ago how do you know if it's God or not or how do you know and I said well you know sometimes God will give you the Revelation by uh anointing you with oil because that's what the Bible says anoint them with oil pray for the sick sometimes it's a prayer cloth we got all these prayer cloths up here Jose you know had at least a couple of friends he said we sent cl to and they were healed of their cancer that was a couple years ago sometimes God will use that right other times you just you God will drop it in your heart and I know I'm well I know I'm I'm going to get over I always remember that one time I was sick and it was a Sunday night after I preached twice and I felt like I was going to throw up I just we were still sleeping upstairs that was a while ago I got down on my knees by the bed and I say I grab I I touched my stomach I said Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I said I'm too busy to get sick I got to preach I got to work I got up there I walked around I still felt sick within a couple minutes I was walking around it all left me I felt sick that whole day I'm like no I'm not getting sick that wasn't my faith that was God's Gift Amen in other words God gave me the grace to not get sick amen right and then the one time when I passed out I stayed up all night sister who and I was saying devil get behind me I SHP thrope you know remember Kevin I was with Kevin and John grahon bang I stay up all night at the old church at w I said I'm going to preach anyway I said come here I was hot and sweaty I hot chills all night I said I'm going to believe by faith God's going to heal me pretty soon I passed out they caught me called the ambulance and you saw your pastor getting rolled out to the ambulance so thank God I didn't have to go to the hospital I tried all night by faith at least I can say I tried right I didn't give up you know that really embarrassing but I was just trying to just press through you know you know and I didn't I didn't stop confessing I I I was confessing the whole time pretty soon everything start getting dark dark dark dark dark dark dark go to sleep who turned out the lights brother brother John you turn out the lights here so sometimes you know you have that sometimes God will give you that Revelation other times I try to press through and I was just hoping God would I just believe God would honor my request I want to preach I'm the pastor well it wasn't God's will that time so I learn now try to make sure I I feel led of the Lord hallelujah but you know honestly church I'm not a prophet so it's sometimes it's hard to tell and it may be that way for you for you too I don't know I would imagine you know I imagine we're all not prophets you know if you are let me know by God's grace Hallelujah he said I want you to get this now the church has got to lift itself in the power of God but how we're too close to the end now I believe the church is condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make believe out and get into something real it's got to be something that you know and church let me just say to you I don't believe you know you our church is in a lot of make believe right we're past that we're past the uh the infancy stage of being a Christian right we're past the point of I'm just going to name it and claim it I'm just going to believe it you know we're past that but we can we we definitely can benefit from uh reminders right we definitely can benefit from reminding us what real faith is hallelujah now um AAA let's see maybe I got this to work here let's see I left my other laptop at school so I got the iPad here tonight thankful to have always always want to have a backup device if you ever a preacher make sure you get a backup device one of them is going to fail eventually all right can you uh project this H so I use these at brother cams you've heard me use these before hopefully it works if not then I apologize okay now um I'm going to read all these quotes but let's keep all these things in mind I think uh Matthew 13:58 is one of our uh just concerns as a Christian in Matthew 13:58 the Bible said Jesus could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief now nobody here wants to fail God right and say like well I didn't have faith for that who wants to fail God don't raise your hand I else go right but but but that that that's what you and I battle right that's what I know I battle as a pastor I don't want to fail God in other words brother Austin I want to be in the right condition when God wants to move I don't want to fail God I don't want to be the aen right I don't want to my sin to Har harm harm somebody else's request right and so we have to put all these scriptures together we don't want to I don't want to be the one that fails God because I didn't believe enough right I don't want people to think well I don't want to think well it's my fault this person didn't get healed that that that's awful thing to live under I don't want to live under guilt now is it possible sometimes I didn't have enough faith and it was my fault certainly certainly but the Bible said there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus so I so we confess our sin or if we had any unbelief forgive me Lord now try me again Hallelujah let me R ready the next time praise God let me be consecrated remember Jesus could not do many mighty works because of their unbelief and remember and here here's what it is here's here's where I think we can recognize Church uh Luke 5:17 said the power was present to heal them so in order for something to be healed there's got to be power there first first in other words we we will recognize the anointing like wow something different's here today right and sometimes you catch at the beginning of service sometimes you catch in the middle of service sometimes like on Sunday I didn't catch it to the end of the service I'm like what is God doing here Lord what am I doing you know sometimes I wonder what am I preaching what what in the world am I doing here today am I help am I helping anybody you know but then you catch it by the end like and then I'm weeping we're all weeping crying we're rejoicing we're singing to God praising God and we're all you know it just we just got to wait on the holy spirit so as Believers we don't want to we never want to fail we never want to have unbelief so we got to recognize we got to recognize we're children of God God has a purpose all things in our lives work together for good because we're the called of God and we got to recognize that God will raise our faith and God will help us to recognize the moments when the power of God is present and he wants to one of us praise God everybody understand what I'm saying so this means you know when when the when the power was there as I wrote there God was trying to get the Revelation for healing you know with these different cities that turn him down but they wouldn't get under the anointing so see Church what's our responsibility get under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and church I'm not I don't think any of us like brother man said none of us sit around like wall flowers no I'm not going to worship today pretty good balance there by God's grace oh no I'm not going to stand up I'm not going to I'm not going to clap I'm not going to sing I'm not going to raise my hands we don't sit around like wall flowers but also we know are we giv all of our worship or not are we real are are we distraction free tonight and I know it's hard that's part of the battle right once we get all back past the distraction then the power of God can come amen hallelujah then the power of God can come Hallelujah we can get past the distraction and we can get in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so the Bible says do all gifts of healing no so if there if there's no gifts of healing or there's fewer Gifts of healing well then uh it all depends that that that determines how often the spirit of God can come to heal right like uh uh like we see you know other churches may have more Miracles well maybe they have the more gifts of Miracles other churches may have more tongues or interpretation well they got the gifts to they got the gifts of it so as I've said many times before it's our responsibility to find out what gifts we got Hallelujah and then if we can get under the anointing if we can all get in one Accord and one place is that something they only needed two things one Accord and one place amen that's the only thing they needed for the Holy Ghost to fall Hallelujah and church we got one place amen hallelujah let's get in one Accord amen am I don't remember the exact quote brother ra said if we could just all get in the same mind and want for the Holy Spirit to move I can't remember the exact quote he said then God could do anything tonight how many believe that by God's grace it's it's a reality it's a reality God could do anything if we just get in one Accord Hallelujah that's what faith is all about Hallelujah faith is Assurance right faith is getting a revelation we all get one Accord we get our thoughts all on Jesus right we get and then his power comes to give us something whether it's healing or knowledge or understanding or discernment Hallelujah that's what a spirit does now this is why I shared with brother cams I was talking about you know the the goat movement of the message preachers I said I appreciate the results they get but and I appreciate their gifts but they also have failures you know stating God's going to heal and then God doesn't do it okay so they they they leave out the main thing is finding the will of God and that's what this perfect faith is tied into it's got to be the will of God Amen I've labored on that but I'm going to keep laboring on that Hallelujah now Faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation that's where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he's revealed it to you by his what Grace Grace Grace that sound famili anybody tonight it's nothing you did for zerubabel to finish that that that Temple it wasn't anything he did Glory amen hallelujah so when God does your miracle that you've been praying for when God heals a person or God does something when God does that it wasn't going to be you it's going to be Christ you're just there when it happens Hallelujah that's how it was with every person in the Bible and the situations with Jesus are all unique because they're actually getting thus sayth the Lord as they talk to Jesus they could get it and hear it we don't always get that right church we don't get to walk with with Jesus and say could you heal my uh my servant at home like the Roman Centon could you could you he said yeah I I I'll I'll go to your house no you don't even have to go just speak the word or like the leper I read that a couple times this week Lord if thou will make me whole if it's your will it's a it's a perfect question if you will make make me whole he says I will be Thou made clean be Thou made whole right asking the will of God well it's different we have done say the Lord there well now if brother manam said Jesus Christ is the same in every detail today except the Corporal body whoa now that takes it up to a different level Hallelujah that means we'll be able to hear from Jesus but just not ably it's got to be spoken on the inside and this is where how many want to grow in this area Hallelujah feeling the will of God feeling the leadership of the Holy Spirit why I feel led to do this that's what I want by God's grace I feel to do this I feel to do that I feel God leading me to do something praise God I can't just sit here I got to do something Hallelujah he gave it to you by Grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it give to you by the grace of God think I always think of Gideon God's like you're a mighty man of Valor like give me some signs prove it to me right that's what sign after sign after sign sign one more sign okay one more give me more you need it too if you're going against an innumerable Army right I would need it too but see it's it's not something Gideon did Gideon didn't work himself into it God helped him believe amen God strengthened his faith and that's what God's doing here tonight God's trying to strengthen our faith hallelujah amen and God re reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation the whole church is built on Revelation in the in an audience of people where a prayer line comes through you'll find they were all good people will say there's some that trying hard to believe it trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all and others it's just by Grace it's just given to them now there's a difference see that does it that's the real Revelation because faith is a revelation from God it must be revealed first Hallelujah Jesus clearly expressed that when he said no man can come to me except my father draws me first that's interesting brother Ties That in that's about salvation God drawing you to Salvation he applies that though to Healing God's going to draw you in come on in here son son or daughter come on in here daughter I'm going to give you your healing now let's apply it like brother R did this is your time to be healed come forward Hallelujah and the church said I'm draw I'm going to lead you into this healing just like with Abraham I'm gonna lead you into having Isaac I'm gonna lead you into this you're not going to work yourself into it this is my unconditional Covenant Hallelujah I made this Covenant I know the beginning from the end I'm the alpha and omega I'm the first and the last Hallelujah I know what I'm doing in your life Hallelujah I will bring it to pass because it's my work Hallelujah you are God's workmanship God made you one of his Works Hallelujah so he's going to lead you to do what he's called you and created you to do hallelujah amen no man can understand who he is or how it is except to be revealed to you by the revelation of God and then faith in that you act accordingly I forgot to set the timer but I know I started about 8 7:15 here so I got about 10 minutes but until you got that Revelation Church every preacher in the world could pray for you brother Keith brother Brooks brother Jesse brother cam brother Simon every preacher can pray for us he said I don't say it wouldn't help you it would encourage you how many encouraged when you go for prayer I am I'm always encouraged but until that Fai see the healing power is in you but it don't come from the preacher it comes You by Revelation not by my there it is good wow what a Vindication I forgot about that not by mind not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord my spirit by Grace reveals this to you and there's nothing can take it away by Faith by Revelation then brother R says when you know want to know what God wants you to do get in the spirit of God first amen so never forget Elisha remember ahab's son and uh Jehoshaphat said we need we need a prophecy he said bring me a Minstrel bring me a Malachi bring me an amen bring me a Lydia amen hallelujah bring me somebody that can worship God and I'll get under the anointing and then we'll see what God says hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen is that beautiful so he says get in the spirit he said and then it's all over he said we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done so that's why we got that's why we come here we pray we worship we sing We we try to yield ourselves to God lord I want to be in your spirit so then things can get done hallelujah I want God to do things in our church don't you amen amen we got to get in the spirit of it first and now as you know I pushed back brother uh Dennis a few weeks there by God's grace we had a lot of guest preachers and I need you need a little break we need a few extra weeks there by God's grace had a lot of preachers in so I asked him you know brother could you come come in a few more weeks so that worked out thank god it worked out by God's grace um it it all it's all good by God's grace I sure enjoyed all the sermons that I've heard Hallelujah I've been blessed but we just need to take a little few more weeks but that'll give us some time to build up some Faith praise God some not just some faith some perfect faith in other words look to God for Revelation right and then when God's man comes in trust God to speak to us hallelujah he sure did it last time he said don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what God will do Hallelujah so his example was with Divine Healing don't try to go figure out your healing he first and then get in the spirit get in the spirit first then then see what God does in other words start worshiping God start praising God loving God falling in love with God asking God for his will that's it right there amen get in the spirit of God ask for God's Will and then see what happens praise God all right I think that's it yep I preach on something else all right you can uh can go back to the scriptures I'm almost done hallelujah so church I I I went over that again to show you the foundation it's got to be God's will first but see God will gently guide you into his presence like we sing that song you gently call me into your presence guiding me by your Holy Spirit right same thing with Abraham and Sarah that's a great example they God just drew them into these promises that he's going to do in their lives now Church can't we trust God to draw us into his will for our lives can we trust God for that brother said one of the worst things when a Christian does he he or she tries to be like somebody else brother said don't never try to be like somebody else just be who God made you to be so what does that take it takes you loving Jesus it takes you submitting to God uh remember make yourself a Living Sacrifice pres just present yourself before God God here I am Use Me For Your Glory I've always just tried to do that right I've just you you've always tried to do that too just keep doing what God's called you to do just be yourself Hallelujah now don't get me wrong you can learn from other people too but I tell you this I'm going to tell this cuz my wife knows it's true there's a certain person that tried to impersonate another uh person like with prophecy and so forth at another church and it caused a lot of pain I think because the woman gave a false prophecy and then tried to cover it up and say it wasn't and it didn't turn out right and it caused a lot of pain maybe I'll tell you more about it on a Sunday night service but we got to wait a couple weeks by God's grace plus y'all would to have a questions and answers right after this sermon here God oh no brother I just I got to go to work yeah me too Hallelujah I I remember that that's right I'd like to tell you those personal things because then you'll learn from it that's how brother BR was that's how Jesus was the Bible say Jesus would tell these Parables I went through it and then when they're all alone they'd ask him Jesus tell us a little more about that Parable so we can understand it Lord right we have this personal relationship right we're we're a close-knit body of Believers that's what we are by God's grace brother R said I told brother said I I told you everything the Lord would allow me to tell you that's what brother Ram said and he gets criticized for telling all these things but the Holy Spirit told him to tell the people and I'm glad he did I love hearing brother R stories I I love it I love to see how he he uh he would go through his battles and trials how he'd uh get through his Moody spells how he'd overcome overwork you ever get overworked amen I love how how'd you get through that brother raham I took the word of God I stuck it in the devil's face Hallelujah amen I'm at my hour ah that busy body back there so church this these quotes and these scriptures about finding the will of God first it gives you the foundation for healings Miracles any gift the spoken word the third pole and even rapturing Faith Allelujah and God is going to give you all these things by his grace am by his election which means choosing God chose you before the foundation of the world remember brother Brooks preached on that God chose you Hallelujah by pre by forn knowledge right God chose you God made you a certain type of a vessel Glory you're a believer so you're a vessel of honor God wants to use you to honor His holy name God God you you God didn't create you to be a dishonor to him like these Sinners that we see going headlong into the into the grave into the pit right blasphemy in God blaspheming the message all these things if they don't repent they're going down to the pit God didn't use you for dishonor God used you for Honor Hallelujah God wants to use your testimony this is going to be honor to my name because they believe my word they keep my word they've got an invisible substance called Faith Hallelujah I've given it to them it's theirs and they're living by faith Hallelujah we have to sing that living by faith Hallelujah as we closed by God's grace let me see which one I should close on here I got a lot I still got a lot left here ah help me Jesus help me Lord I think I think I'll end with this here let me end with the uh some of the examples brother R uses for perfect Faith but now in with with our understanding of brother R's final Divine Healing service works as Faith expressed right uh November 1965 we got to look at perfect faith through those lenses in other words all these examples CH listen he gives all these examples the first example he uses is where did I write down is the woman with the blood issue that's the first example he uses he said that woman had perfect Faith what did she say she said the Bible said she said in her heart if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be made whole how did how did she know it was revealed to her that gave her the muscles think about that a little woman gave her the muscles to push through all those Brothers let me I got to touch him you know think of they big Burly men like Malachi and Austin and all they she just pushed through nothing's going to stop her because it was revealed to her and even Jesus didn't know it God had not reveal it to him he said who touched me he wasn't lying it wasn't revealed to Jesus it was revealed to her he said daughter great is your Faith your faith has made you whole great is the Revelation the gift of God that God revealed to you Hallelujah she didn't work herself up into it it was God's Gift Hallelujah God revealed it to her the next example was uh Jesus healing the epileptic child the the disciples prayed over it and he the child didn't get well and and and the parents came to Jesus and said your disciples couldn't cast out the devil and Jesus said oh ye of little faith and they and then Jesus rebukes the devil the child cl's well they say Jesus why couldn't we do it this kind only goes out by prayer and fasting oh so now we get a deeper Revelation here if we want if we want God to move through us we got to be consecrated at certain times in other words if we want a revelation from God if we want to see God do his will we got to be in the channel for it we got to be praying about it got to be giving up some meals about it these are the first two examples I want to get through this list here then I'll close you all love the word of God don't you Hallelujah next one is Joshua spoke to the son brother BR say didn't have to pray about it right he said just stand there I have a need I'm in the service of the Lord he sent me over here to do this job and I'm doing the best that I know how and the enemy's routed and they're out there if I let the sun go down they'll get together and cause me more trouble so son stand still he said Moon you hang there brother man said that was perfect Faith he just called for it but see that wasn't Joshua that was Christ in Joshua Hallelujah it was revealed to him that he could do it Hallelujah just like what brother Ram said you about all these individuals they all had to have it revealed to them brother Ram said God revealed to David I think it's in here too that David could would defeat Goliath that's why he could say those things that's why he could say I'm going to cut your head off today and uh overcome you I'm going to defeat you right because God showed him what was going to happen happen that makes it a lot easier if I know what's going to happen doesn't it brothers sisters it makes a lot easier to speak the word of God if I know what God wants me to say the next one he goes through is jesus' Miracles all of jesus' Miracles he said he said uh if I don't do the works don't believe me he said and I only do what the father shows me amen so brother R labors on Jesus more than all the other examples he had perfect Faith CU he knew what he was and he also heard what the father said Hallelujah and that's how we'll have perfect faith is when we know what the father's telling us to do and now as I honestly told you before even Jose has been healed numerous times these last this year last year and each time it's coming up in the prayer line normally well I don't always I don't have the Revelation I just ask him you know and you've heard me say too have you confess your sins and then we can take charge then we feel like we have authority but it's always if it's your will Lord right unless unless maybe I maybe I forget to say it and maybe then God is speaking that God is God's completely yielded me over or I've completely yielded over the Holy Spirit and God can speak something through my mouth praise God or whoever prayed it doesn't have to be me it could be anybody and that's what I found in my life you know most times we don't even we don't even know what we're doing we're just yielding to the Holy Spirit and God would do a supernatural work in our lives we wouldn't even call it perfect faith we just would feel like I I just believe God's going to do this I just know it's going to going to be all right I just know alls well Hallelujah God's going to be on our side Hallelujah that's perfect Faith although you don't say thus sayith the Lord somehow God's given you this unction this leadership of the Holy Spirit and you just speak God's word and it's perfect faith in your heart the next brother B said Elijah old Elijah out there on Mount Carmel he walked up and down before that I don't say won't you call a little louder maybe he's pursuing he know what was he was going to do because God had told him what he was going to happen he said let the god that answers by be or by fire be God he said then he even poured water on the altars they cut themselves they done everything oh ba o bail answer Elijah was just as calm as he could be so brother man says with perfect Faith you're just as calm as you can be he said uh maybe call a little louder maybe he's out pursuing maybe he's on a fishing trip keep calling to your God maybe he's doing something else you see just made fun of them because he knew what was going to happen hallelujah amen church that's why all these examples one after another all the way down through the Bible that's how they all had perfect Faith because God was leading them and God had showed them what was going to happen now in our case if we're not prophets we have to Simply follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit make sure what church all of our sin is confessed Hallelujah make sure everything's under the blood blood right then nothing will hinder the prayer if you're praying for somebody else ask them make sure all their sins are confessed Hallelujah and then see many times for me it's see what God will pray through me what will God bring to my mind as I'm praying for them I just try to pray what the holy spirit will bring to my mind praise God hallelujah I think I'll stop right there by God's grace there's so many other things to say uh but I think I'll preach a part twoo if that's okay so perfect Faith then is a perfect Revelation right God has made his will known to you and so you can speak to that mountain but we know most time it's not a physical thing it's a spiritual thing that we got to speak to now let's stand our feet musicians can come and think about the mountains in our lives here hallelujah you know as I was preparing I was thinking of if you haven't watched Simon's testimony in a while that I made a few years ago you might want to make it Simon's had this speaking to the mountain thing move numerous times so if you don't get if you haven't listened that I would encourage you to listen to that Simon uh numerous times has been led by the Holy Spirit and I've and uh one one time I was a part of it other time was with my brother with my brother uh my brother's uh youngest child was born with a heart defect and Simon felt led the Holy Spirit to go over there and Simon told him all these testimonies and you have to watch nobody can say like Simon and Simon just gave one he said by his stripes we're healed Simon just went through one verse another this is what makes Simon such a good Christian to me you know just just a humble Christian I'll say like that just I admire him he'll go over there and you know he's he's you know physically smaller than others but he's raising their faith he's building them up through the word of God and Simon told so many testimonies under the anointing of the Holy Spirit Well yeah they're goingon to have to have surgery on the baby and watch that watch that testimony if I got it wrong forgive me I always exaggerate I always say something wrong because I'm not perfect but you understand the point I'm trying to make by the end of it Simon had so built up my brother's faith my brother stood up and he said that boy is healed glory amen hallelujah and they took the baby there and didn't have to have they said we don't know what happened but his heart doesn't have the hole anymore praise God their scans showed a hole in the heart Simon built up his faith and then the my brother just said he's healed he spoke to the mountain of a hole in the heart and the mountain had to move hallelujah amen Glory Hallelujah I know because I heard about it from my own Brothers amen hallelujah another time impacted me my one of my best high school friends his dad I remember he had a stroke I remember he told you this story and he called me up he was my friend was crying he's like can you pray for I said yes I'll pray and all for some reason brother all was I can think it was Simon Hallelujah I called Simon I said bro Simon can you go pray for him he said I just work 12 hours I do he said I'll try to go pray for him I hung up the phone uh before Simon went to bed he went in his prayer closet I believe and he said Lord if that man his name is Tom if Tom is still alive in the morning then I'll know that's your sign for me to go pray for him well goes to bed wakes up he's still alive Simon worked all day that ain't no easy work either this guy works like a dog or a ax let me say ax ax is way better and Simon said the whole time he's walking the spe he said he he walked through the uh as he's going to the hospital where my best friend or my former best friend and his brother and family was at in the waiting room he said he was looking for signs and he said each sign he saw on the wall was like a healing sign or something like that and and as he's going along he's seeing all these signs building up his faith now remember my friend's dad had an 1% chance to live just to live on a ventilator my friend told me on the phone he's got a 9 90 99% chance if he to live and if he lives he's going to be on the ventilator they said he's going to be a vegetable the rest of his life but Simon's walking there you know how Simon is walking by I'm just a little teacher I'm nothing that's what God needs amen God needs a man like that and each sign talked about healing or something he was studying from the scriptures he walked in there and Simon did the the same thing he starts telling my friend his name was Seth all these things got it done and they're in the waiting room like about thinking he's going to die by the time Simon is done my friend who's a sinner stands up and said let's go pray for him he's going to be made well Simon talked a sinner it wasn't Simon it was the Holy Spirit in Simon amen raise this man this and he's my age he's 43 years old now probably was 38 back then he raised a sinner's faith to say let's go pray for him Hallelujah nothing happened that night but Simon called me up and said we pray for him brother Jess I said he he told me all that story all these things so I went in my prayer closet that night brother Austin I'm crying I got in my closet I still it's the closet I have right now I said in the name of Jesus Christ I speak to that mountain and I command to move in the name of Jesus Christ based upon Simon's testimony this person's testimony I command that heart whatever heart stroke uh to be healed in the name of Jesus Christ couple days later he wakes up it's kind of like kind of like your father it's the Saint's father and then they're like well he's not going to be able to talk he's not gonna be able to talk couple days later he's talking and they said well he's not going to be able to walk couple weeks later he's walking Hallelujah he had a 1% chance just to live on a ventilator amen Hallelujah they so he's brain dead and within a month or two he's out of the hospital we got a picture with them I caught him up on the phone and talked to him my God's grace still alive to this day amen see we're not prophets but we gotta if we stay under the spirit that's what I want to close with you thought I was closing 10 minutes ago so did I I want to close with Romans 88:13 and 14 for if you live after the flesh you shall die Simon was not living by the Flesh in those days he wasn't like well let's go to Chipotle or no I like Chipotle don't get me wrong you know what I'm saying I love Chipotle you know he wasn't saying well do I go to Chipotle or do I go pray for the man you know he went he was dedicated to the Holy Spirit if we live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live He's already worked hard all day but yet he still fils the leadership of the holy spirit for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are spirit of God we are the sons and daughters of God let's bow our hearts here how many raise your hand and say Lord Jesus help me to live after the spirit so my faith can be used for your glory that's my prayer tonight let's pray together father

forgiving us Lord God and we ask God that you would help us to be in this condition for Sunday Lord for Mother's Day Lord as Simon's testimony shows even mine Lord many of these times we've spoken the word of God it's outside of the church service Lord showing us that we got to be more dedicated I need to be more dedicated Lord God so I know you'll help us with that tonight Lord God you'll lead us

against it may we speak to the mountain in Jesus Christ's name
