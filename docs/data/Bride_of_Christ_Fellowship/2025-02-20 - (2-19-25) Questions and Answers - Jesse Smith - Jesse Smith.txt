TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to be in the house of the Lord hallelujah let's go if you would uh let's go just to Malachi chapter 4 5 and six I want to preach a little different topic tonight uh I want to preach on questions and answers I've got numerous questions and answers about brother brandom over the last few months and I've been kind of saving them up for a time I can just kind of preach them all together so I think I might i' like to do that tonight by the grace of the Lord so Malachi 4 5 and 6 Malachi 45 and six here by God's grace very familiar to us who have followed brother Ram's message for any amount of time this is a uh prophecy about a Prophet Elijah to come and so uh this is a scripture about abam emphasized numerous times on numerous occasions even with the uh infallible phrase of thus sayith the Lord and I realized the gravity of that statement of course I wouldn't be preaching all these 18 years if I didn't realize the gravity of brother raham statements about thus sayith the Lord and prophecies and being a prophet Hallelujah now most churches you know uh that aren't in Pentecostal ranks they would just shudder if you said that you know oh there's a man saying thus sayith the Lord they would just shudder with that but the thing is they're just ignorant of the scripture praise God and they just they just don't know they've been trapped in denomination too long but thank God he set us free from the chains of denominations hallelujah amen thank God for his grace and his mercy so uh we're thankful Let's uh Malachi 4 5 and six I'll read uh five and then we can all read six here uh tonight I've got numerous questions here U we try to just do the best we can here I love questions and answers I don't always have the answers but I love when the holy spirit gives us the answers Hallelujah I just got an email from South Africa today saying you know they appreciate our YouTube channel and they said the brother said so many of my questions have been answered through the preaching there I said praise God that's all God's grace and mercy just like it was uh the Bible said the holy spirit is a discerner of the thoughts intents of the heart Hallelujah so we're thankful for the holy spirit so I'll read verse five behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord let's read verse six on three 1 2 3 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it not it to God father God I have needs tonight Lord I Need Your Grace I need your strength you are the only real preacher Lord Jesus so father I submit myself to you Lord help me not to say anything foolish help me not to say anything wrong help me to have the memory of the Holy Spirit Lord as I'm preaching here tonight that your people might be benefited and and blessed thank you for these questions Lord God the Bible tells us Lord that we should have an answer for the hope that we have within us for every man Lord as we're led by the holy spirit so father God just take your spirit tonight Lord and preach tonight Lord God have your Liberty and minister to all the needs of thy people in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so I'll be doing some teaching tonight now of course you know I like to do quite a bit of teaching but I am working on a a a preaching sermon here I was sharing with a brother uh on the mage message from Minnesota I was sharing him a little message I've been working on here uh by the grace of God um I'm not going to give it away because I want know I don't want you to go study it I want to be fresh to you but if you want to know ask God he'll let you know what I'm studying just going to teach on or preach on it just a um a preaching message here brother man said there's of course the Bible says there's preaching messages that just declare declare declare then there's teaching Ms which give you instruction they instruct and so with these questions and answers I'll probably just be instructing answers to them uh giving Bible instruction here uh by the grace of God so I want to get to my other notes here and then we'll be ready to go okay okay so uh the first one is about uh and these will be focusing here on brother braham's Ministry a little bit here tonight by God's grace you know um I've been preaching heavy on the book of Corinthians I think we're we just finished part 13 um on Sunday there so I just thought I'd take a little break here okay all right that's good that's I'm very thankful that worked out tonight here so I want to look at there's three questions and answers let me set a timer here I'll do 45 minutes and see if how that goes here by got the grace of God there was basically three questions that I've been asked recently I made videos about them and studied on them and so forth and so i' like to show uh some answers here tonight the first one was about uh prophets making predictions that didn't come to pass and we're just talking human predictions we're not talking about thus sayith the Lord or in the name of the Lord we're just talking about human predictions okay there's three or four examples in the Bible and this relates of course to brother Brandon making a prediction about 1977 so we'll we'll look at that here the second one was about all the preaching gifts um could a could a prophet have all the preaching gifts okay uh so there's five preaching gifts so the question has come up uh people asked me you know did brother bradam have all five did anyone in the Bible have five and so I think we can prove uh by the scripture and so forth uh that uh a preacher can have all five gifts brother r said he read in history now he didn't give the citation which I'd like to get it maybe Rod Knows It But brother Ram was talking about Martin Luther and brother Ram said he read somewhere that Martin Luther had all nine of the spiritual gifts you know he spoke in tongues he prophesied he had discernment Faith knowledge you know you name it all nine of them uh now i' I'd like that reference on that I don't know enough about Martin Luther to know that um uh but uh if if in other words if somebody could have all nine right of the regular gifts then that would give some evidence that somebody could have all five preaching gifts and here the r of it is just kind of reminded me the rout of it is Jesus Christ had all nine gifts and all five preaching gifts right he was the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man right all the he said all power and authority was given unto me right and he said I only do that which pleased the father and he says I only please the father I always please the father in everything I do so he had all the supernatural gifts remember the Bible said there's not enough room to put the books in the world of all the things that he did by God's Gra so surely he had all the gifts of the holy spirit okay so let's look at this first one uh so you have your Bibles ready here um we'll look at uh I I made a video of course it was last fall uh about at least there's four human predictions and actually one of them is a thus sayeth the Lord uh that uh that God gives and uh it's it's altered so it's a we'll get to that in just a moment with uh Isaiah and Hezekiah so it takes a real good balance in the scripture actually before we get that let's just read a few verses about prophets let's go to I believe it's James chapter 5 because it's very important to understand this this is where a lot of critics will get brother brandham wrong they'll criticize brother brandham uh unjustly but the Bible says uh to be a prophet um you had to speak uh something in the name of the Lord so it's very important uh we look at what people say that uh prophets rather that speak in the name of the Lord it's uh James 510 okay so uh James 5:10 says take my brethren the prophets who have spoken of in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience so Prophets You Know prophets are born under the human curse right and so uh Romans 3 talks about that human curse every man or woman is born and the Bible said job of a few days they're full of trouble right and the Bible says in Romans 3 every mouth is like a supplier right with dead stuff coming out so we know every Prophet Moses you name it uh Enoch John the Baptist Joshua every prophet of God Ezekiel Jeremiah habac you know Zephaniah Zechariah Malachi all of them at some point uttered something that was just human and it was wrong right now the Bible says everything Samuel said God didn't let anything fall to the ground well to be scriptural that just means with thus sayith the Lord right because no man or I'm sorry all men have fallen short of the glory of God right so a statement like that must be balanced out with the word of God that means because the Bible said in Romans 3 everybody speaks lies everybody speaks uh uh uh evil things the Bible says that Romans chapter 3 uh a lie or something like that some something deceptive the Bible said the heart is deceitfully wicked Above All Things who can know it right and where do the where do the words come from the abundance of the heart the Bible says Jesus says that so uh sometimes people utter things well many times people utter things without understanding they'll falsely accuse a prophet of God and so we must make the scripture Our absolute and uh so a prophet must speak in the name of the Lord they must predict something in the name of the Lord not just I predict this or I predict that but it has to be in the name of the Lord now let's go to Deuteronomy 18 these are foundational scriptures for a prophet and it is true the uh a prophet cannot get one thing wrong in the name of the Lord if they do that would mean they're a false prophet Deuteronomy 18 and that's why I've gone through every time brother Ram said in the name of the Lord thus sayith the Lord there's over thousand of them I think there's over 12200 maybe 1100 some I'm guilty of exaggerating sometimes so um but I've gone through all uh let's say 1100 okay I'll just keep it on the lower end I know there's over a thousand and I've gone through every one of those that was in 2017 I went through every single I read every single one and I've not found one where brother Ram failed where God let it fall to the ground everyone's comeing to pass now there's times he's talking about stories of thus sayith the Lord and he might get a fact here there wrong but that wasn't the exact moment he was prophesying and so again you got to look at when when is a man actually prophesying not just telling a story about a prophecy because we all forget things right the older you get seem to forget a little more right we just forget details about things but you got to look at what's the point the prophet is saying what's or what's the point of the story that he's saying okay so uh that's what I found in my studies now let's go down down to verse 20 God uh of course God tells the the the Israel that this is the test of the prophets brother Ram Echoes this he actually used these same words as scoffield scoffield calls us the test of the Prophet CI scoffield um by verse 20 but here's the test verse 20 but the prophet which shall res presume to speak a word in my name which I've not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die so that's why it's very important a true prophet of God will only speak in in the name of the Lord now you and I would think oh how would you know well it's it's just a gift it's so simple the Bible said God will speak to them in dreams or visions but like Moses it was like lip to ear I think it was face to face or mouth to mouth I think is said there in the book of numbers in other words a prophet has such a special gift a such a special channel that they're not going to miss God won't allow them to miss Hallelujah God's got to have a witness God's got to have a prophet who cannot miss because of their predestinated gift of God hallelujah now verse 21 and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken very simple right verse 22 when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously or from his own heart right not from the mind of God Thou shalt not be afraid of him so don't fear that man that's not a that's not a true Prophet now the best example was in 2020 all these uh charismatic uh mega church preachers almost all of them predicted Trump would get two consecutive terms and he didn't get it even if they stole it he still didn't get two consecutive terms and they said the Lord told him that automatically that proves their false prophets and so don't fear them and I got a whole list them if you want to talk about after service I've kept the videos you know so you have to you know the Bible said Mark them that cause division right you got to mark them uh and of course you know uh there's just a long long list of but we don't follow them thank God God showed us the truth hallelujah now it it's always easy to know that's one thing but also they have many false doctrines you know like they let women preach and they uh they would let women wear makeup and sexy clothes and sexual things like sexual immorality like that let them marry two three four times when the Bible said it's adultery so in other words they have many corrupt fruits not just one corrupt fruit right so it's it's it's not something that would deceive us but it would deceive people who aren't really into the word right they they haven't dug deep down to the Deep things of God because the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God so if someone is really in touch with the Holy Ghost they will get deep down into the word of God it won't just be a surface understanding it'll be a real deep revelation of the word of God hallelujah so that's the foundation a prophet has to speak in the name so they have to say in the name of the Lord or in the name of Jesus or in the name uh of God Almighty or something along those lines in the Old Testament it was thus sayith the Lord but now in the New Testament now we know the name of the Lord It's the Lord Lord Jesus Christ so a new testament Prophet could say in the name of Jesus Christ all right now let's read these here uh 1st Samuel 27 there's at least four examples here 1st Samuel 27 1 through3 and David said in his heart I shall now perish One Day by the hand of Saul Church did he die by the hand of Saul no he died of old age there is nothing better for me that I should speedily Escape into the land of the Philistines and Saul shall despair of me to seek me anymore in any coast of Israel so I shall Escape out of his hand now this was spoken in his heart but what did God do God allowed it to be read before everybody right now to let us know that prophets can have things in their heart they think that they're right right but they're they they're not it's not God's thought it's the prophet's own thought right just like Nathan I don't have this on the list but remember Nathan said David do all that's in your heart and what did God say Nathan go down and tell him no he's not going to build the house in other words God's like no Nathan he's not going to do all that's in his heart Hallelujah so a prophet doesn't tell God what to do a prophet doesn't do what he say what he thinks you know with the name of the Lord he waits till God tells him then he speaks it praise God now just so you know David was a prophet a minor one right we would say you know we're not saying this is th thus sayi the Lord but there was Major Prophets and Minor Prophets now David looks like a major prophet because he prophesied of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross but you can see in his life though there was other prophets he submitted to like like Nathan right so see you got to it's just you know we're just trying our best to understand and we're trying to give labels you know people that were Major Prophets and then Minor Prophets like we're going to get to the example of Jonah who knows how many how many prophecies did Jonah have come to pass in the Bible anybody know one one now if you yeah you got the one if you want you could do two I I'll take that good one we'll get to that in a little bit I'll take that because if you consider the the one about Nineveh that warning if you consider that one yeah then yes that that counts too but there's one church we have I have brother random at least six and there's probably more that I just need to research more six from Brother Braham now that's good but think about think about Jeremiah Isaiah and Ezekiel I've just read I'm almost through Isaiah now I've read through all these they have scores of prophecies that thus sayi the Lord came to pass I mean they prophesied about Israel then they prophesied about Edom and Assyria and Babylon and Egypt like it's like thus say the Lord to everybody thus say the lord it's just like the just scores and scores of thus say the Lords so how do we know whether to call somebody major or minor so I'm just giving you an example in other words what I mean is there's Major Prophets that told many important events and then there's prophets that just told a few events does that make sense I'm not trying to confuse anybody but the word Major Prophets not in the Bible or that phrase the phrase minor Prophet is in the Bible we just call them major books right in the Old Testament the first few books then we call the rest of them Minor Prophets but Church let's just be honest you know that uh I don't think any Prophet wants to be called minor right or we as Believers we shouldn't take any of their prophecies in a minor way that's what I mean we should put uh equal emphasis on every prophecy because heaven and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away hallelujah amen think about that it's easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one word of God to to fail to come to pass amen hallelujah and one word of God will never come will never fail to come to pass Hallelujah forgive me let me get my words right here let's read that acts 2:29 and3 just so you can see David was a prophet he's the one that prophesied of the Resurrection in Psalm chapter 16 but we're just going to read Acts 2 I've always loved that when I preach out years ago God hid the resurrection from Satan in one half of one verse in psalm 16 Satan didn't Satan Satan didn't know the Messiah was going to raise from the dead but it was hidden in the language of his body shall not see corruption Hallelujah glory to God Acts 2 29-30 and then we'll we might as well go to Jonah next because that's that's what Malachi had a good good thought on that 29 men and Brethren let me speak freely unto you of the patriarch David that he's both dead and buried and his supplier is with us unto this day therefore being a what Prophet so said the Bible does say minor Bible doesn't say major hey church he wrote a lot of Psalms too that were prophetic right lots of them Hallelujah so he's a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on the throne this is how David knew he was going to defeat Goliath church God must have shown him a vision because remember he said today I'm going to take your head off how did he know that all he had was a sling God had to showed him before hand Hallelujah he was a prophet right that's what Jes even Jesus you know Jesus had that prophetic gift Jesus said I only do that which the father shows me so brother Chris that that's how it was God would show Jesus to go raise Lazarus from the dead then he would go do it he only did what God showed him first that's all a prophet can do he doesn't do things he wants to do he does what God shows him to do Hallelujah that's how a real Prophet operates okay so David makes this prediction Saul's going to kill me did it come to pass no it's just a human prediction was it spoken in the name of the Lord no no so see that's why it's okay sometimes prophets can speak uh just their own prophecies or their own predictions and they don't come to pass no big deal the thing is church a real Christian a real Christian knows what to major on and knows what to minor on see it's the spirit of idolatry that wants to make every word of brother brandom thus sayith the Lord that's an evil spirit of idolatry they make every human word he said thus sayith the Lord right that that's a current evil spirit it's a spirit of idolatry right and and and that can be applied to anybody who says they're a prophet right uh anyone who worships and and thinks every word a person utters is thus say the lord they're deceived they have an evil spirit on them because only the words that have thus sayith the Lord right or in the name of the Lord those are the only ones that we know for sure are prophetic now could there be other ones yes there could be other words that were prophetic but we don't know unless the spirit of God leads us to know all right because just just like uh just like psalm 16 does Psalm 16 start out as thus sayith the Lord no it doesn't right good brother see it does so not every time does a prophetic word have to have thus say the Lord see but for us to know God says God says for us to know a true Prophet they will speak in my name and it will come to pass and it will never fail Glory all right now Jonah 34 this one good one Malachi had here good Jonah 3:4 I'm gonna have some people read here by God's gra uh Haven get Second Kings 1425 that's the one other prophecy that Jonah is recorded as prophesying 2 Kings 14:25 I hope I got wrote down the right one here so uh Jonah 3:4 all right let me look at up here Jonah 34 let me pull that up here thank you for your patience here now this one uh brother Malachi is talking about and Jonah began to enter into the city a Day's Journey and he cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be over Throne now if you just look at the words does he give any out like does he give any way say well unless you repent just just what it records now if we don't add to the word or take from the word like the Bible tells us not to right if we don't add to it it just looks like he's making a prediction you got 40 days no no he just he said 40 days and you're going to be destroyed there's no real prediction in there or there's there's no uh plea for repentance and we know that because Jonah later gets mad God did spare them God get Jonah gets mad at God a prophet getting mad at God God's got to Humble Jona sometimes even prophets can uh see prophets can sin right they can get prideful all right now but see this is a just as it's recorded it's a prediction that actually didn't come to pass right if you just look at it now was it prophetic uh did did it seem like they had some type of awareness it was a prophet yes now brother tell tells the story I need to find it though as far as history brother said those ninevites which were Assyrians right they were part of the Assyrian Empire brother Ram said uh one of their main Gods was the fish God and so when they saw Jonah spit up out of the fish then they thought Oh Our God is sending a message to us and that's why they believed it now I found some other historical things where it said there was an eclipse and and so there was Eclipse before Jonah got there and so they knew like they were superstitious and they thought that was judgment uh all the politics around them was crumbling and so they were shaken up there were a time where they were shaken up historically and then so when God said in the prophet they were already shaken up and they were willing to repent think about that willing to repent and lay in dust in ashes my goodness make the animals lay in dust and Ashes that's how serious they took thus sayith the Lord but here do we does it actually say thus sayith the Lord no and did those exact words come to pass no because it says yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown it doesn't say unless you repent okay so I'm just giving you the basic Bible words now was Jonah a prophet yes Haven read that second Kings what' I say uh 1425 yeah I don't know that's pretty good Hallelujah so all as we know before Jonah went to Nineveh was he had one time and that's what the The Sight and Sound did a good job on that movie one time he stood up and he said he was speaking as a prophet he said thus sayeth the Lord God's going to give us Victory on the North the East and the southeast thus sayith the Lord we'll get our borders back and they went and did it and so like on the show it's really everybody's CL for oh the prophet Jonah we got a prophet Among Us and Jonah's just trying to be humble like well God just told me what was going to happen if you've seen Sight and Sound it's a really good show but that that's that's all we have in the scripture one time he said thus sayi the Lord and it came to pass now you want to consider Nineveh I I'll go with you on that because we don't maybe know the exact words on there but it they they must have known it was a prophet you know they must have known uh to repent it was God the god of Heaven speaking them warning them death or repentance but just the way it's worded I'm just I'm just showing the other side just the way it's worded it doesn't give and out of repentance okay now here's the real real uh just sometimes it's a difficult one to understand 2 Kings 20 1-5 because we know the Bible said uh I am the Lord I change not right uh and God will never change that which goes out of his mouth 2 Kings 21-5 so I put this on the same level as uh God telling Moses uh separate yourself from them I'm going to kill them and it's God allowing man to have to to play the part of a type of Christ that's what I put on here uh this is what I believe because God said I'm going to do it I'm going to start all over I'm going to start with Aaron and Moses or Moses and Aaron and I'm going to start a new people and what does Moses and Aaron do they fall in their face say no God have mercy on them right it gives them a chance to intercede like Christ a high priest right iny when when people deserve to die somebody stands in the Gap and God shows grace and mercy on people hallelujah and now this story though is just such an amazing story in those days was Hezekiah sicken to death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to him and said thus sayith the Lord set thine house in order for Thou shalt die and not live he says not live right you will not live you're GNA die now remember this we showed you this a few weeks ago it would have been better for Hezekiah to die because he had two sons and one of his sons did the very worst sins according to the Bible of all the kings of Israel it would have been better not to have two boys yeah Manassa good brother good that's the name I was going remember good Bible reader brother manasse was an awful King and it was actually his sins that led to Babylon and Assyria coming in and spreading out because it just was the Tipping Point but God looked at his heart and he served God all those years and God knew what he was going to ask for and the church said like God knew like God wasn't surprised oh I'm going to change my thus say the Lord no it was God allowing him uh to express his desires it's God showing him Mercy right because he's a pure-hearted servant he says thus say imagine brother dramatized imagine being Isaiah thus sayith the Lord You're not live you die you're walking out and God stops say oh no go back and tell him he's going to live oh God what oh God's going to give a different word right but so he's got to go back and say well no you actually you got 15 years to live I've heard your prayer so this this is a great lesson for us it shows God's mercy to his Faithful Servants and it shows these two things it shows the perfect will of God and the permissive will of God we also saw it with balum bam made Seven sacrifices remember he sacrif sacrificed seven altars and and seven Bullocks and he says can I go up with Bao and God said no he goes back and says okay Bao I can't go he says go try again you got to try again with God he goes back again he says can I go God says go go ahead and go what God changed his mind but uh but but we know from the scripture it's God allowing the false prophet to have his heart's desire God's not going to force you to do something he'll tell you what to do but he's not going going to force you and so with balam just like with Hezekiah it's God allowing Hezekiah to have the permissive will of God just like balum got the permissive will of God he had the perfect will of God first he should have took the perfect will of God and the church said and that's how people do today you know uh I'll just use an example it doesn't impact our church but someone will get married right and then they'll something bad will happen they'll want a divorce you know and it doesn't happen in this church it's never happened in this church but uh the perfect will of God would be to stay with that person work it out forgive right but then they they'll pray and church maybe God would allow them to do something like Mary again and they would say God told me but that wasn't God's first will just like with balam Hallelujah it wasn't the first will of God like brother BR said brother said one time a woman told me a God told me to preach and brother BR said I don't doubt that one bit but that wasn't the first thing God told you the first thing God would have told you is go read first Timothy chapter 3 Hallelujah I'm sorry chapter two sorry it's not chapter three chapter two right I suffer not a woman to preach or teach up to a man so see I I don't doubt uh that maybe God told Joseph Ram to play The Taste but that wasn't the first thing God told Joseph brandom because the first thing he would told him was already said in the word right so see that's why it takes a real spirit LED Christian to rightly divide things that happen in life think about that all these people could have come back and said Isaiah is not a prophet because he said thus say the Lord he's going to die oh but now he's going to live what how how could God change his mind it wasn't God changing his mind it was God allowing Hezekiah to have the permissive will of God God knew what Hezekiah would do God knew what balam would do God knew what Moses would do and Aaron because they did the right thing think about that Temptation brother you know God said I'm going to start a brand new family with you're going to be the next Abraham and Moses could have thought oh my that that sounds pretty good but instead he's like no God don't destroy them have mercy on them and God said good that's just like my son Jesus is going to do H he's going to intercede for the Sinners Hallelujah so it's a great lesson here verse two and he turned his face to the wall praying to the Lord and saying I beseech thee Oh Lord remember now how I've walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart now notice God never Rees him he walked with a perfect heart that means just confessing sins every day because no man is perfect right you just you to take care of your sins every day and the church said at the end of the day before you go to bed confess all your sins don't let the sun go down upon your wrath because no man is perfect of their own ability if that's the case why do we need Jesus we need Jesus to forgive all our sins I'm going to skip down verse four and it came to pass a four Isaiah was gone out in the middle of the Court he didn't even get out out the middle of the king's court he just made it out of the the the the the court and then he goes to the middle court the second court and now the Lord stops him says go back I got a I got a permissive will of God for him go back and tell him this right he says turn again and tell Hezekiah verse 5 the captain of my people thus sayith the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I've seen thy tears behold I will heal thee so he's not going to die right away but God just said he was going to die it was a test behold I will heal thee on the third day Thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord and remember he gives him the sign where he God actually stops time God turns back time God made the sun stand still for Joshua God turned back time for Hezekiah nothing is too hard for the Lord how many would like God to turn back a few years on your clock I'd like to go back a few more years I got too much gray here brother R anything think he only got three days or something like that it wasn't that much time but God turned back the time now here's the last one now this is uh it doesn't actually say Apostles it just says the Brethren but it's possible some of the Apostles thought that John was going to live to the coming the second coming of Christ John 21:21 oh man all right I'm getting there by God's grace pardon me it's taking me a little bit longer to get to them uh Peter seeing him saith to Jesus Lord what shall this man do Jesus saith unto him if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow me we get a good lesson there don't worry about other people's Ministries you be faithful with yours what's John going to do what what's brother so- and so what's this going to do Focus On Christ don't worry about other people do what God called you to do Hallelujah verse 23 then went out this saying abroad among the Brethren that the disciples should not die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that he ter till I come what is that to thee and we know John died about 100 AD right of old age he's the only apostle that wasn't martyred or killed the Apostle of Love okay but look there's a saying amongst all these brothers oh my goodness we're predicting John's gonna live Jesus said what is it if he live till I come so there's a we're predicting John's John's not going to die before the Lord gets here let's hang around John who would have been hanging around John I probably would have been hanging around joh let's be honest I would have been there uh John can I uh be your neighbor brother wherever you go I'm going to go because I know you're going to be ready for the Rapture right and there's people that still think John's alive to this day hiding out in some cave what a bunch of nonsense because they misunderstand this they don't and it just shows and these are the same people that make the false prophecies like the one guy said Biden he said thus he said the Lord told me thus say the Lord Biden won't even finish out his first term he did well no wonder this guy got he and then he got caught in sexual sin see is that all those Spirits go together all those evil spirits go together you get one evil spirit lying Spirit then you get a sexual lust of the flesh spirit and all these all these demon powers right if they don't clean it out the leaven just grows and it infects their whole life thank God for the unleavened bread of the word of God hallelujah thank God Amen we can have pure lives Hallelujah all right now now the reason I say that is because brother R said this now remember 19 times he says this 1977 prediction was a prediction I counted I went back counted 19 times he says I'm not prophesying 19 times he says this is not in the name of the Lord I just have three reasons now he didn't say that I found that but basically I got three reasons I think the Lord's going to come uh before 1977 this is in 1956 said remember I predict that before the great total Annihilation which I don't say the Lord told me this so see plainly God didn't tell me this I'm not speaking this in his name I believe there'll be something happened either between now or that time of 77 it may come at this hour but between now and 77 I predict that either a great destruction or total annihilation of the entire Earth between now and 77 I predicted it in 1933 now this stumbles a lot of people which I understand why if you haven't read more of the Bible but you have to know a real Prophet they have to say in the name of the Lord or thus sayith the Lord there was a lot of predictions going like around like this the time of brother Bram uh Charles Tes Russell Uriah Smith they were all making all these prophecies I'm sorry some were making predictions right some were making predictions some were making false prophecies but notice brother plainly says I don't say this and there's a quote where brother said I didn't see 1977 in my vision of the seven major Visions I'll show that he said I didn't see 1977 in there he had three reasons why it was a prediction he said no democracy had lasted 200 years so he went he looked at 19 or 1776 plus 200 was 1976 so that's one reason I got it on tape if you want to hear it and then he said the 70th Israeli Jubilee uh now what's I did this on my watch here 70 time 50 I got to change this here I I did the total number here 7 what's 70 somebody somebody probably I don't know let me try yeah brother 3,500 this guy's on he's on tonight he got good sleep last night so brother randam uh did that math now let's minus that uh 1977 so brother Ram scoffield Bible said the first first the first Jubilee that Moses spoke of was in 1523 BC and brother raham went and did the math he's like okay well well then the 70th Jubilee where uh that means uh Jesus uh Christ God bless you sir Jesus Christ will reveal himself to the Jews right and the blindness will fall off them like Paul talks about Romans 11 uh brother found that date it must have been uh in the Scofield bible or Usher he used Usher as a historian he's like oh that goes to 1977 the 70th Jubilee and third brother calculated that from Abraham to Jesus's Ascension Resurrection was 19 uh 19 1954 years okay so he again he used his Bible he's doing math calculations and then he's like oh well then uh from 33 ad or whatever it was 30 ad uh plus plus the rest of the year so whatever the year was that Jesus resurrected I don't know the exact year plus 50 1954 was 1977 so brother R thought he had three reasons and that's why he called it divine inspiration but he never said thus sayith the Lord okay he never said he said plainly I don't say the Lord told me this okay but clearly right clearly prophets can people can predict things but if it's not spoken in the name of the Lord you can't make it let it's in the name of the Lord don't put something in someone's mouth you'll know if it's thus say the Lord you'll hear it it's thus sayith the Lord hallelujah that's how God speaks to his people just read the book of Ezekiel and Jeremiah my goodness why don't people read their Bibles I mean ezekiel's like all the time thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord he says son of man give them thus sayith the Lord Jeremiah's like thus sayith the Lord anytime God's going to speak he's going to say this is me speaking okay through a prophet all right so that's the first question now how am I doing on time that was a long time okay okay so I got 30 I've already been going 35 minutes okay second question here now this a let's see oh all the preaching gifts okay let me uh I got to pull up those notes here okay there it is okay now let's let's show how Paul Paul we can prove by the Bible Paul had at least four and then if you look at another verse it's clear he had all five gifts okay so let's get some readers here uh you want to read there n brother brother Rod okay uh brother Rod Romans 1:1 pretty easy to find there first chapter first verse uh nature do you want to get 1 Thessalonians 4 15 16 and 17 and then Caris do you want to get uh 1 Timothy 2:7 uh brother Chris do you want to get one yeah you want to get uh acts 1536 so we can prove by the Bible Paul had at least four preaching gifts okay so brother R why don't you start with ROM Romans 1:1 amen hallelujah glory to God what is he he's an apostle what does Apostle mean one cent one cent forth that's right so that's a missionary we called a missionary to I don't know why they changed the name but said why do they want a missionary name he said I like the Apostle word better me too I'm with your brother B okay so he's an apostle uh now yeah uh nature here he now this doesn't call Paul a prophet but he speaks in the name of the Lord predicting future events that makes it a prophet so 1 Thessalonians 4:1 1516 and 17 nature all right Hallelujah I feel like clapping let's clap for two claps a rod so on our Sunday night bible I encourage the kids and we clap for them like saying hey great job keep up the good reading I just find a way to encourage them publicly Caris uh what did I say 1 Timothy 2:7 Caris that what it say oh give it to your class great job so so we got three we got Apostle Prophet remember he said I speak by the word of the Lord this is going to happen shout voice Trump so shall we ever be with the Lord by the word of the Lord not by by his word the word Lord and we just preached through 1 Corinthians 7 right and he says this is me this is not the Lord now this is a command from the Lord right so if you know your scriptures and then Peter said Paul writes some deep th things he said and the the people that don't understand it they rest the scriptures that Paul wrote Paul wrote scripture right that's inspired word of God that's thus sayth the Lord all right good all right uh and then brother uh Chris acts 15:36 and Malachi get acts 2031 would you okay brother Chris acts 15:36 Malachi acts 2031 go ahead brother Chris okay very good now this doesn't say evangelist but that's what evangelist does they go from one city to the next uh they go from church to church to evangelized to declare the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's what Paul was doing here he'd already started the churches he don't need to be an apostle to them anymore now he needs to be an evangelist to them to stir up their faith to preach the gospel to declare the the promises of God to them good give Chris two class good job brother Chris now this is the one brother Ram uses to say he thought Paul was a pastor as well at Ephesus because he was there I think three and a half years if I'm not mistaken so Malachi do you want to read that it's acts uh 2031 all right give him two classs great job okay so brother uses that to say Paul was the first pastor of Ephesus okay because he stayed there so long three and a half years was it three and a half years or three years I always forget Mal do you remember was that three years or three and a half three okay just three okay great great okay so now you can see we have an A A Bible precedent for a man having all five preaching gifts okay and brother brandom started off as a pastor uh brother BR said he was ordained as a local pastor Pastor in 1932 so brother man the first gift he had was a pastor and he used that gift along with teaching until he left the brandham Tabernacle around 46 or 47 so he was there at least uh 46 or 47 uh that have been 14 or 15 years he was in the pastor Ministry and then he said when he was pastoring he would do teaching he said I would teach and I got the quotes in front of me uh he would teach on the Book of Revelation for a year and a half straight on one book okay so now we got P we got Pastor teacher okay and then in uh 1933 he gave the prophecy of the seven major Visions let me see I'll pull that up real quick and he said these were thus sayeth the Lord these were thus sayeth the Lord in 1933 so that was before the World War II right he predicted these three before World War II and we're seeing I believe I believe these three have been fulfilled I believe we'll see these come to pass very shortly and some people say they might already they might uh but I always have my reasons you know just humble reasons why so brother mam said uh in 1933 he says on the morning I went to dedicate the Tabernacle he said uh it blasted in right to left that in this hour it's been told since 1933 when the Holy Spirit gave me the visions and showed me the end times seven things that I spoke of and five of them brother bam thought had already happened now he didn't say five with thus say the Lord had already happened but we've seen these three have fully been of course manifested that was uh right after I mean not right after but that would have been U uh World War II ended in 1945 so that would have been uh what 12 years 12 or yeah 12 years 33 45 12 years so these were fulfilled 12 years after they were given okay okay now his fourth one is Vance in science he said the last part of it was a American family in a bubble shaped type of car that's why I put that on there and they're facing each other playing some type of a board game and he said it's driving on beautiful highways we haven't had that yet I haven't seen it and of American family okay have you brother Rod seen one yeah it's here yes yes it's here yes so I'm waiting for like brother man said brother said they just don't have the highways yet that's what brother R said that was back in 63 or 64 yeah right right so that one could be fulfilled now I personally believe it's got to be something like something an American highway it's got to be so it's got to be all over over the internet now it's not newspapers anymore it's got to be all over the internet where it's undeniable right now the fifth one he said this ends up with a woman he said was the immoral problem with women he said and it was it was headed up in a vision of a woman wearing nothing just a fig Leaf over her loins that's all it was now we probably had something like that but we don't want to see that right uh but it has to be has to happen Okay the sixth one was a woman rising in the power of the US and he said the woman had Purp on now some people think it's K Harris but you got to look at the rest of the vision the vision said the whole nation bowed to her I don't know about you but I didn't bow to anything Kamal hair said so to me it wasn't a woman it was the Roman Catholic church because she's a woman in in Revelation uh 17 and 18 and what's her her color Scarlet and purple the whole nation has to Bow that's why I don't I I don't believe this one's fulfilled yet and the seventh one is the bombing now I don't know where that is in the Bible but I know this uh I know this we see that Beast out of the land in Revelation 13 brother B said that's United States of America is the last half of Revelation 13 but we don't see that Beast anymore after the Mark is laid down so sometime after the United States leads to the mark of the beast the United States will be destroyed brother saw it in a vision with thus sayith the Lord now if these came to pass so accurately I believe those will come to pass so accurately because it's God it's not man it's God okay I'm almost at my 45 minutes okay and then uh then brother BR said in 1946 he says seven years coming this week I left the Bram Tabernacle and went out into the Evangelistic campaigns of healing service so brother R said God sent me out with my gifts right uh the first gift was the dots on the hand and there's people alive that still saw them they're still alive today they saw the dots brother R would take somebody's hand brother rod and there would be a pattern of dots for like cancer or tuberculosis or heart disease and brother B had those patterns memorized yeah they were just like uh dark spots they look like bruises yeah uh one time he took his wife hand and said see my wife doesn't have anything wrong and the pattern came up of a t cancerous tumor and but it didn't show up for like five or six more years later but then God healed his wife and there's numerous people still alive that saw that that was the first poll the first stage of his ministry right the second stage was Discerning the thoughts and Tents of the heart which we'll see here and the the third stage was speaking the word of God just speaking like Jesus said speak to the mountain that was the third growth of brother Ram's Ministry speak the word remember he spoke to the snowstorm he spoke to the the tumor that his wife had and the doctor couldn't find it and remember there's a woman that was at that she was in that doctor's office when uh his wife had that tumor hanging on which I forget which side it was and it was on the table and she could barely get on the table and that woman said uh she saw that and then when the doctor went up to examine it it was gone so she saw she saw right before it was right right before it vanished and then she saw it was it was gone after that God took that tumor and God just vanished it because God told Brother Ram speak it whatever you say it'll be speak to the mountain right that's scriptural now there's my 45 minutes so H give me 15 more Church would you he said okay he raised his hands all right he clapped forward all right no thank you and then brother R started his uh fifth apostle Ministry around 1950 his first missionary trip was to Finland that was where the boy was ran over by the car and raised to life and that man was still alive I and he his family testified of it he was dead on the side of the road brother prayed for him he saw in a vision he's coming back to life and he come back to life he would testify to it there's people that knew his family like ad biso and different ones like that they've testified over the years so God is real Hallelujah God is in control so there's there's what I believe that's biblical proof somebody can have all five preaching gifts just like somebody could have all nine gifts of the holy spirit now I believe we could go through Paul's life and I need to do this I believe we can show he had all nine gifts of the Spirit too because he said I spoke in tongues more than you all well if he spoke in tongues I'm sure one time he interpreted you know and we know he's got faith he he spoke to the bloody flux and everything like he he had all kinds of Faith so uh Miracles I mean my goodness he no doubt he had all the all the gifts yes discernment yes that's right that's right very good brother now last one I got about four 13 minutes here now the last one was just fresh I just put this out today there's a cute guy who's that guy I'm talking about the little guy not the big guy the two ministries of Malachi uh 45 and six that's why I named my son Malachi because I love the Book of Malachi actually I was looking up and I I seen what does Malachi mean it means my messenger so I said God give me a son that looks in my image and let him be your messenger so no pressure okay that was just my heart's desire God gave me my heart's desire so he kind of looks like me except he's bigger but I'll take that I'm very thankful for Malai he's been so faithful so the last question was um they said brother Jesse is is there two Ministries in Malachi 45 and six so right here here's the first Ministry turn the heart of the fathers of the children and here's the second Ministry I didn't highlight it but I want you to see the first part was fulfilled by John the Baptist but this phrase is never repeated in the rest of the Bible okay now brother brandom used and I I probably won't get to it tonight unless I take an hour and a half I'm not going to take an hour and a half tonight I got to work tomorrow uh but we we can show brother Bram says thus sayith the Lord he said this Elijah is on the Earth right now of course he was just given a a a clue to the elect that brother Ram's Ministry was this fulfillment okay that was the Fulfillment of it okay now so behold I send Elijah the prophet before the great coming Dreadful day of the Lord now Dreadful what's that fire that's Armageddon right remember Church remember this the King of the North Russia and the kings of the East China will bring all their soldiers against Israel and then the Bible said Jesus Will Come Out of Heaven destroy them with the sword of his mouth and then the Bible said in I forget which prophet it was but the Bible said the Israelis will be bearing the dead bodies for seven months after that battle zekiel thank you brother yes yeah that's right yeah Ezekiel 37 38 or either 38 39 38 39 very good brother very good and then for seven years they're going to be breaking the the tanks and everything the metal all the all the swords now they call it swords they're going to be breaking those and turning them into uh yeah all the garden tools garden tools yeah ver seven years going to pulling apart all these tanks and everything look look at all the weapons and the battleships and everything they got you know seven years to pull those apart okay so that that that's that's the Dreadful day of the Lord that hasn't happened yet okay so the spirit of Elijah was on John the Baptist he should go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children now here's different this is this isn't the same this is a different Ministry and I'm going to prove it to you tonight by God's grace and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just so John the Baptist was going to tell the disobedient he's going to give them wisdom to be fair and just now some of you might know where I'm going with this here right if you're real real familiar with John the Baptist ministry in the in the gospels okay now this was John the Baptist he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children now you now you I challenge you search it out show me a verse where John the Baptist was dealing with fathers to uh turn their hearts to their children care more about your children he he wasn't he wasn't doing a natural Ministry of fathers to Children it was a spiritual Ministry in other words he was telling the telling the fathers of the faith behold there's the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world Hallelujah follow him right he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost he will Hallelujah so see that this wasn't a natural well you know Dad's let's have a dad's convention and let's show you how to love your your fathers that wasn't John the Baptist he was saying you're going to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said saying Jesus is the Lamb of God follow him Hallelujah he's the Messiah right so that's what he did he turned the hearts of the the the we'd say the apostolic fathers the the the the the fathers of the faith that were alive at Jesus first coming he turned their hearts back to the children or the people that would be alive at Jesus's second coming and that's this is what brother Ram did Brother Bram now turns the hearts of the children to their fathers in other words the children the the younger the the Young Generation that will be alive at the second coming of Christ it has to be because it's right before the Dreadful day of the Lord right before God pours out his wrath on the the Gentiles right as we just talked about with with Russia and China the kings of the East Kings of the north see he's got to send Elijah again to turn our hearts back to the fathers which is our hearts coming back to St Paul St John St Peter all the apostolic fathers of the faith hallelujah our hearts are turned back to the scriptures Hallelujah that's right now if you got your Bible uh well we'll just have I'll just have to read it okay Jesus yeah yeah Jesus said John the Baptist Was Elijah as well so not only did Luke record it Luke didn't see it Luke was a physician he was just recording historical events okay he wasn't an apostle uh but Jesus said John the Baptist was the spirit of Elijah okay so it's Matthew 11:14 and if ye will receive it this is Elias which was for to come so Jesus says John the Baptist is Elijah as well okay now here's where uh here's where we see a separation with these two so go to uh go to John 1:21 if you got your Bible go there because it's important John 1:21 and Caris since you're going there can you read it Caris I'll put you on the spot there you're good Under Pressure John 1:21 John 1: 211 now notice right here now either in this verse there's only three options either John the Baptist is lying which we know he wasn't or he didn't know he had the spirit of Elijah which he would have had to have known he had the spirit of Elijah or John was talking about a different Ministry of Elijah that's the answer ding ding ding ding ding ding ding it's a third option because Jesus said he was Elijah but then John says I'm not Elijah well he wasn't the last Elijah minister because Elijah comes again before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord there's Church read your Bible Rod knows this there's only one day of the Lord It's the day of Destruction that's Armageddon there's only one day of the Lord there's not days and days and weeks of the Lord there's one day of the Lord Armageddon yeah the Battle of arm I don't know how long it's going to last that's a good question it's in Revelation 19 all the armies are gathered against Israel so Jesus comes out of Heaven on a white horse we're all behind him on White Horses by God's grace dressed in the white righteousness of the Robes of Jesus Christ but Jesus wins the battle he sends a sword out of his mouth it's just the spirit of God destroys all them and then the Bible said God takes that fire burns the outside of the earth that spreads and then we walk down on the ashes of the wicked into the Millennium The Book of Malachi says that as well okay and then they're bearing the bodies for SE seven months of all the slain soldiers okay all right and I got you I got you on John 1 121 and they asked him what then art thou Elias and he said I am not wait Jesus said you were are you lying John no John do you not know your ministry no John knew it he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare and make ready for the coming of the Lord hallelujah he knew is he knew who he he knew who he was Hallelujah and he knew that because yes this was uh told to his father as well that's right in Luke 1:17 art thou that prophet he answered no so John says no I'm not Elijah Jesus said he is Elijah well there must be two Elijah and the church said have you seen a rod I've watched numerous Orthodox Jewish videos and they say at the end of every Passover they knock on the door and they're wait and somebody will stand there and said the let men say who are you Elijah Elijah's here oh my they know when Elijah comes their messiah's coming too hallelujah amen now that's the Elijah in Revelation 11 to Israel but there's also an Elijah to the Gentiles to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers Hallelujah because John pointed them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost was for the New Testament Hallelujah not the Old Testament right that's why that's why our Elijah has to turn us back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that's what John the Baptist pointed them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost not to the law of Moses not the blood of bulls and goats but to the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah oh my Hallelujah this is good glory not me not CU of me there's nothing good in me I'm a sinner saved by grace I'm nothing I'm a as far as I you can say I'm a piece of trash but the Lord Jesus Christ his word is true Hallelujah so see Jesus calls John Elijah Elijah says I'm not Elijah in other words I'm not the Elijah before the great and Dreadful day you can look at all the commentaries all the most of the commentaries say that John was saying I'm not the Elijah to come before the Dreadful day of the Lord because Church there's going to be 2,000 years God's going to Blind Israel because they rejected Jesus there's going to be 2,000 years of Gentile Church ages before the Dreadful day of the Lord there's going to be all this time God's got to send Elijah again and then he's going to send him one more time five comings of Elijah Elijah Elisha John the Baptist William brandom and the Elijah to come with Moses in Revelation 11 Hallelujah that'll be in the seven years we won't be here if we're born again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we go out to meet Jesus at the wedding or at the marriage supper in the sky no I'm sorry uh the Rapture in the Sky then we go to the marriage supper yeah as long as we got the oil remember the parable the wise versions everybody heard it oh the Jesus coming Jesus coming but only one group had extra oil that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost so if we got it we got the oil we'll go out to meet him we'll meet him in the air the Bible said we uh she read it tonight who read it nature read it will be changed in a moment twinkl of an eye praise God you can't get ready quickly you got to already have the oil amen you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's why Chrismas when I first came in this message I heard about that I would on numerous occasions I would wait till all the people were gone to in my house at the college house and I just get on my knees and say God fill me with the Holy Ghost God I would just yell God fill me with the Holy Ghost God send an angel and I just kept waiting until the day after I got married and then the Holy Ghost fell on me praise God and I shouted in joice and praise God like I'd never done before and I walked out of that church saying I love everybody in here I've never felt loved like this in my life who can I love can I buy a meal I was buying meals for people on the drive home I was just full of God's love I never felt that way before I saw a vision of the Cross that's the only time I've seen a vision in my whole life while I was awake it was just it was so Supernatural huh and of all days the day after I was married too praise God Jews are still looking for this Elijah to come okay I got two minutes left on my hour now yes I'm sorry let's do I'm going to close of this now this so so so one one of the critics of brother BR said oh no this phrase right here is the Fulfillment and no it's not no it's not because the heart's got to be turned back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost John was pointing the the fathers to the children to the Future right to the generation that would see his coming say You must be born again you he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost right it's all about the baptism of the Holy Ghost this this means uh if you got your Bible go to Luke chapter 3 ver10 Luke Chapter 3:10 I'm almost going to close here so appreciate everybody's Patience by God's grace this has been good tonight it's been a good uh lesson in the scriptures by God's grace and church all these things brother Bram taught I God didn't show this to me I'm nothing I'm just I'm just reading what he said I'm just I could point you to all these quotes brother Braham said this is Brother BR this is Brother br's Ministry because he's a prophet of God okay now and the disobedient to the wisdom of the J so John is gonna uh make the disobedient understand the wisdom to be fair everybody read this real close now get your uh glasses on clean off your glasses if you got glasses clean off your uh your contacts if you got contacts let's see if there's any disobedient people in here that need to have wisdom to be fair and just verse 10 and the people asked him saying what shall we do then they asked John the Baptist what are we going to do verse 11 he answered and said to him he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise okay now that's not disobedient yet but it's vers it's coming up now verse 12 an were the worst people in the entire Bible days they were the lowest of the low Tax Collectors they could say you owe $50 and you might only owe $1 they could rob you for all your money and you had there was nothing you could do about it because if you if you go to the Roman Emperor you say no no I you have to give them whatever they're my they're my servants they could just rip you off now we get mad if we go to the IRS and we don't get a big return back but we got it good compared to what they had they you you could owe a th they could charge you 10,000 and you had to pay it these were the lowest of the low so they asked the publicans came to be baptized and said Master what shall we do Oh you mean the disobedient that's what zakus was he was rich off of steal money from people he said any man I've I've done wrong I'll restore them four times the amount that's a real repentant heart right there what shall we do verse 13 He said them exact no more take no more than that which is appointed to you see if there was like a 3% tax then they might oh I I'm going to take 10% of them so I can make myself rich like zakus did but when the spirit of God came what it do it made the disobedient have the wisdom to be just to be fair just take what's required and don't take anymore see that now verse 14 and the soldiers likewise demanded him saying what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man see don't be disobedient just don't beat people up because you're the you're the police officer don't be disobedient do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely so see they pay him off uh Roman soldier let me pay you a few daer here whatever they had you know mites of course mites wouldn't be enough let me give you a few talents here and and you come testify against this person and I'm going to get I'm going to get my day in court see but John's like no don't do that don't be dis obedient use wisdom of the just be fair be just with all these things and be content with your wages see don't be disobedient always complaining about I don't make enough money I don't I why don't you work harder why you making yourself more valuable you'll be worth more money right why don't you work harder why don't you find a better job why don't you go Ed educate yourself see some people complain why they don't have enough money well why don't you pay the price and and get some good training why don't you do that the thing is most people just don't want to save money that's the thing they got a bad habit of spending and the church said that's the thing that's the problem with people and so some of these soldiers had some bad bad habits too and he says don't be fair be content with your wages don't complain for a raise every year all right last thing there's my hour just to prove it to you brother Ram gave us six thus sayith the Lords that have come to pass there's probably more I just got to go find them a brother what I mean is a brother sent me a a PDF and it's got 10 people that were prayed for by brother brandom and he says with thus sayith the Lord you're going to be healed and then we find here later they were healed so there could be potentially 16 thus sayi the Lords because I have six right here and he gave me a list of 10 more yes now see I would need his testimony yes I put his picture on a video brother but now I just I would love to hear his yes I need to talk to him yes I need to talk to so brother brother Rod knows a man named Max Manning you talked to him right a wall fell on him because he was in construction or something he was in the hospital what and the wall in the church and God honored him by building up go ahead brother go ahead what brother say wow but something hallelujah thank God for that Hallelujah yeah Rod wow I gotta talk to him brother yeah yes sir yes sir absolutely I'll try get I thought you did I just need to go dig for it too but yes if I can't find it I'd love to have it tell you that know Hallelujah so that's another one I could add if I get the the testimony of it but oh it's in that pamphlet yes okay yeah you sent me that pamphlet yes Hallelujah I need to go read that pamphlet again I read over it but I forgot it yeah yeah please do and I'd like I'd love to talk to him glory God still has testimonies Hallelujah to know that God said there was God sent a prophet among them Hallelujah now here's three that come to pass or six that come to pass in 1958 Marilyn Hickey now she's a woman preacher with short hair makeup brother Braham would not never approve of that but she was in a prayer line and brother Braham discerns here you've come from Denver Colorado thus sayith the Lord that's right go home and receive your child God will give it to you if you believe so see some people say oh well if that that's gives him a way out but that's what Jesus said Jesus said all things are possible if you can believe sometimes God will put it on you to believe he'll challenge your faith other times God will just heal you and he's not going to challenge your faith I prove that by the scripture like that man in John chapter 5 that who was paralyzed Jesus said just take up your bed and walk like he didn't say if you believe he just said take it up and it just God just did it there was no if about it but in this case there was an if and she and she 10 years later had only one child and it was thus sayith the Lord and come to pass a couple years later 1961 brother Ram said there'll be no greater gift to the Gentiles than his ministry thus sayith the Lord you'll never in any no more Gentile Church age see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign to the Gentile Church Hallelujah now the Jews will receive Great Signs right the blood will I'm sorry moon moon moon will turn to blood and so forth all those signs in The Sixth Seal in Revelation 11 uh earthquake in the city there'll be great signs there but this is true because like here's one example from 1954 Brotherman was in a prayer line in Washington DC he told this woman 15 Secrets she's sick dark Spirit he names the spirit's death it's on video you can watch it it's cancer it's breast cancer he was she was examined by a strong person ruptured condition in the bow stomach trouble severe heart trouble causes fainting nearly passed out sitting on a bed now you can't memorize that God's got to tell you that and then she he wasn't even done and then he said I still see a dark Spirit there your name's Eva York you live in this city Washington DC address is uh 6136 Street you're going home to be well thus sayeth the Lord that's a real prophet of God we've never seen any gift greater than this I'm watching I'm looking I'm looking online brother Austin I'm waiting because there it's thus sayith the Lord he said it six times thus sayith the Lord there'll be never greater no greater gift to the Gentiles till the coming for for the rest of the time of the Gentiles it's thus sayith the Lord third brother Ram said I've got thus sayith the Lord now this is according to that the fifth Vision where the Fig Leaf Vision brother Ram said according to that it's thus sayi the Lord she'll Contin God said you she'll continue to strip herself and look what we got today yoga pants and bikinis all summer that's if they're modest that's if they choose to be modest on those hot days because instead of instead of yoga pants they have yoga shorts on yes that's right exactly right oh it's so awful it's thus sayith the Lord that was all those years ago that was 1960 62 yeah 62 look where we are today now remember church just so remember remember the 1970s was the year of women in pants I'm a teacher I get magazines brother from the union I'm not anymore because I'm out but they even put out a magazine it was God and they said 1970 was the year teachers in schools got to wear suit pants right like brother R said they'll they crossdressed they started wearing women's clothing and now look where they're at now they're almost naked like even teachersday can wear yoga pants and all I mean in the school in the school now they haven't yet wore like sports BRS like you saying yet but they you wear yoga pants they might as well just walk down the hallway like this try not to bump into the kids I don't want to run you over guys but the fourth Vision uh this was from 1965 brother Ram saw a vision he said now this is thus say the Lord he saw the Church of the United States in a symbol he says they had on these tattle tail gray skirts like these barroom girls no back on it so they have skirts but no back on the back side brother said he had to turn his face when he saw it he says holding up he said a hola dancing and uh paint makeup short hair bobbed hair smoking cigarettes twisting doing the twist to rock and roll brother man said is that the church United States yes it is and church you know this is just s symbolism now look there's some some recent data from 2025 said there's either 16 people 16 million people or 67 that attend church every week that's either 4.6% of Americans and 19 or 19.6 as see this small we'd say a small little group I mean how many of those people smoke cigarettes it wasn't saying every person in the church it would just say the church would be defiled by these things right in modest skirts with no backs I was I I I got saved in the chapel there was women there wearing dresses that had no backs on them and skirts that were super short and distracting to worship even before I knew brother Ram's message that was back in 2001 2002 bobbed hair they've had bobbed hair for all these years makeup shaking their hips to rock and and my mom said this brother my mom was born in 1950 she was raised assembles of God and I asked her about this I told her about this and she said when we were growing up they just had the piano she said I never thought they'd bring rock and roll to the church but she said around the Year 20002000 2005 right in there she would go to the youth conferences and that's when they started bringing rock and roll and she said now there's rap and you just so I told you Mom now my mom doesn't follow this message brother R but I told her I said Mom you have seen brother R's Vision fulfilled thus sayith the Lord because the church is now dancing to rock and roll Joel o is the one that made it famous because every other church has copied him yeah you know brother they all try to copy up S up there and everything's so beautiful I'm spitting around here and saying glory to God hallah but everybody tries to just be this professional everything's fine and Prosperity Gospel he's the one that brought in rock and roll and every church has tried to be like him brother Chris yes yes right yep until they put pressure on him then he finally let them in yes people are homeless and he wouldn't even open up his church yep yep oh yeah he said he would go to a homosexual wedding he said that if it was his friend and they asked him why don't you preach on it he said well they got enough trouble in their life well they need to know about it so they can get rid of their abomination and get saved but he won't even preach on Abominations awful fifth one 1965 brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord Florence sharan was going to die now the critics say well uh of course she had cancer it's not hard to predict that but the reason this is prophetic is because uh Florence sharan was a brother I'm sorry a sister to de sharen who is head of the um the the Christian businessman Association so these guys were all had prophetic gifts and everything and they were all prophesying she's going to be healed of the cancer brother Ram was the only one saying sorry guys God showed me a vision she's going home to be with the Lord and all the other guys were saying she's going to all the other Pentecostals were saying she's going to be healed that's why this is significant yes I know it's easy to it would be easy to predict someone to die from cancer but the the the point was all the prophets of that day and the and the Pentecostals were saying she's going to be healed with us say the Lord Brother Braham said no she's going to die then she died by September of that year she'd already passed away and that's what that's what Elijah foretold remember he told King ahaz he said set your house in order you're going to die so there is times when people are sick and a prophet will tell you thus sayith the Lord you're not getting up from that okay so there's five told the future with thus sayith the Lord in the name of the Lord that's a real prophet and the last one I love this one let's stand our feet you've been you've been a very good audience I've gone way over an hour uh say wait but a little bit over I love I love this one so much because I can almost hear it my head I've heard it so many times I can almost hear Brother B saying it he said it's predicted that they're going to do it the denominations and they're going to do it for it's thus sayith the lord they're going to do it you think them denomination he calls them nominations you think them nominations will ever break up their denomination come back to the word now what's he talking about the word no women preachers right the Bible right the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost where the tongues are not the evidence the evidence is of the life of Jesus Christ Hallelujah now you might speak in tongues you might not you might shout you might dance you might scream you might boohoo at the altar but something's going to happen life is going to come into you Hallelujah and you're going to be changed the power of God is going to be inside of you because then Paul says not all speak with tongues not all are prophets not everybody has to be a prophet right or Apostle are all Apostles will any denomination ever break up and come back to the brother's bible-based teaching or Paul's teaching it's thus say the Lord they won't that's why I've told some of your family members you better come out of denomination he says thus say will they go into the Antichrist system exactly it's thus sayith the Lord because every denomination is a daughter of the mother denomination the Roman Catholic Church Hallelujah so what are you saying I have to be a witness and so do you all believers watch now look it's been that's uh uh this year it's going to be 60 years in 60 years has any denomination even tried to come back to the truth no they just usually get more worldly more compromised more members right bigger buildings thus saith the Lord how many glad you're standing with thus sayith the Lord today musicians can come how many enjoyed the questions and answers tonight by God's grace amen let's thank God for that hallelujah it's just to Rejoice that Jesus has sent us a genuine Prophet Hallelujah and we know the scripture is true uh like I these are all these are all thus sayith the Lord's here it's from and I preach this back in 2018 so some of you probably don't remember uh it's been what seven years now so I was thought I might preach it again just to refresh you on all these th so it's from 651 all the way down to 7:05 brother R said thus sayith the Lord so many times that's where he said oh yeah this is where he says Malachi 4 remember it's thus say the Lord it'll come to pass in this day speaking about tur the hearts of the children back to the fathers you search the word over take every call every Clan take every man every church I charge you in Christ's name do this you preachers I charge you to read the newspapers or take consideration anywhere you want to go see if it isn't on the Earth right now is it in the quote above that yes so brother said in here in July of 1965 it's thus sayith the Lord the Elijah Ministry turning the hearts of the children back to the fathers is here right now it was his ministry Hallelujah thus sayith the Lord Lord see he says in the last day the Bible promised that he send the spirit of Elijah and call the people the children of God back to the original Faith like it was in the beginning the word the word was confirmed the son of man in the last days that's Luke 17:30 the same as it was in Sodom yesterday today and forever he promised it it's a God's promise it's thus saith the Lord hallelujah Hal how many feel safe tonight under thus sayith the Lord hallelujah I feel safe thank God he sent a prophet to us to point us back to the word of God but now the the Holy Ghost is here hallelujah brother man's not here so the Holy Ghost is the prophet to us how many believe that amen let's bow our heads here let me make sure everything's good and all is well okay let's pray together father God we thank you for today Lord thank you for the answers of the holy spirit in the scripture Lord God it's so simple Lord God to look at the scriptures and see what a prophet is where a man could a prophet could make a prediction but if he doesn't use your name Lord you give us the wisdom to know it's just a human prediction not just one but looks like four Lord God we're learning Lord God to lean upon the holy spirit we're learning Lord to take everything back to the word to search the Scriptures Daily as acts 17 says whether these things brother Ram said we're so we know all the things Paul said we so we know all these Bible authors but Lord when we get a a prophet Lord post the days of the Bible we have to take everything they say back to the word of God so Lord we're doing that every day studying brother Ram's quotes every day I'm studying the Bible every day reading the Bible every day by your grace and mercy father we're grateful for the answers of the Holy Spirit now Lord let our hearts be turned back Hallelujah to St Paul's gospel let our hearts be turned back to Peter's gospel Hallelujah to the words of Lord John to the words of James Lord all these new testament authors let our hearts be turned back to the apostolic fathers Lord Jesus we thank you Lord God for this opportunity to be in your house tonight Lord God we put our faith together Lord in the promises of God and we ask Lord that you'd move Lord as we've testified before you've had some of us speak to mountains and they've moved I remember when brother Austin spoke and rebuked Satan off of the family member and Lord you honored it within a matter of a day or two thank you Lord God I remember speaking that mountain of infertility and then the mother was able to have three children Lord God I remember that Lord God hallelujah I remember praying for my grandfather who couldn't feel his leg because of diabetes and Lord I remember when I prayed for him he said all the feeling came back and he testified at the next night Supernatural healing Lord God I remember how you're faithful Lord God Lord let your Holy Spirit have preeminence in our lives may we yield to you Lord Jesus and only say things that would please you Lord God stop our our tongue if we would say the wrong thing God help us to only speak the words of the scripture bless us tonight as we worship help us tonight to focus on you as we go to bed and tomorrow as we get up and search the Scriptures Daily Lord God we want to be more like Jesus turn our hearts to be like these Apostolic fathers in Jesus Christ
