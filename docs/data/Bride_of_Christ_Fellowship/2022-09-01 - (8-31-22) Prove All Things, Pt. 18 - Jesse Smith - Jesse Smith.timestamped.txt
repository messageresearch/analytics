[0:00] praise the Lord hallelujah let's get
[0:02] right in the word of God here tonight
[0:05] let's go to a second I'm sorry first
[0:06] Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 21.
[0:14] let's I want to like to look at this
[0:15] thought again of approve all things I'm
[0:17] going back to this series I haven't
[0:18] preached it since December
[0:21] so it's been about nine months or ten
[0:22] months but I want to not just preach one
[0:24] more sermon on this I want to call it
[0:26] prove all things part 18 the word test I
[0:29] want to look at the word test here
[0:30] tonight I'm going to show numerous
[0:32] scriptures and then lots of quotes from
[0:33] Brother Branham so bear with me I have
[0:37] lots of quotes we'll see how it goes by
[0:40] the grace of the Lord
[0:45] first Thessalonians 5 21.
[0:58] praise God let's read
[1:00] 21 and then I'll read 22 and 23 myself
[1:04] but let's read 21 together ready one two
[1:06] three prove all things hold fast that
[1:10] which is good now I'll read 22 and 23.
[1:12] abstain from all appearance of evil and
[1:15] the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy
[1:17] so see Church we're always going to need
[1:18] more sanctification brother Brandon
[1:20] called it the Shaving down like that
[1:21] sheep illustration we gave on Sunday so
[1:24] you always need shaving down and I pray
[1:26] God your whole Spirit that's your mind
[1:28] and your soul and body be preserved
[1:30] blameless unto the coming of our Lord
[1:32] Jesus Christ Now isn't this this doesn't
[1:35] this seem impossible how could I be
[1:37] blameless
[1:38] when I sin every day but yet the blood
[1:41] of Jesus Christ makes us blame us
[1:43] Paul wouldn't write it if it wasn't
[1:45] possible it is possible through the
[1:48] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ aren't
[1:50] you glad he makes you blameless you just
[1:52] confess your sins he washes it wide as
[1:54] snow God bless you you may be seated by
[1:56] God's grace and then Keisha why don't
[1:58] you pull up Acts 17 11 and then after
[2:00] that I have some slides we'll show I'm
[2:02] going to try to set a timer here by the
[2:03] grace of the Lord
[2:04] just got to be wary of the be aware
[2:06] rather of the time
[2:12] acts 17 11 these were more noble than
[2:15] those in thessalonica in that they
[2:17] receive the word of God with all
[2:19] Readiness of mine and search the
[2:21] scriptures daily whether those things
[2:24] were so and just leave that up there for
[2:26] a moment this is a very familiar
[2:28] scripture to us I feel like you know God
[2:30] has given me a Ministry to teach the
[2:33] word of God also preach you know the
[2:35] Bible said these things command and
[2:37] preach these things command and teach so
[2:39] we're preaching and teaching the word of
[2:41] God this is a beautiful scripture uh
[2:43] Paul had preached to the bereans as
[2:47] you'll see in verse 10 but just leave
[2:48] that up there and the Bible said those
[2:50] in Berea were more noble than those in
[2:52] thessalonica because everything the
[2:55] prophet said they took it back to the
[2:56] word of God they spent their days
[2:58] hearing the prophet and then they'd go
[3:00] check the scriptures to make sure the
[3:01] prophet was right
[3:03] now George I hope you know I know you've
[3:05] been with me a long time I know you love
[3:07] me I love you but I hope we get to this
[3:09] spot I I trust we're there where we'll
[3:11] hear the sermons but then we'll also go
[3:13] read our Bible on Monday and Tuesday
[3:16] praise God and Wednesday and Thursday
[3:18] and Friday and Saturday make sure you
[3:20] check your pastor by the word of God
[3:22] because Church the way churches stumble
[3:24] is they get comfortable and they stop
[3:26] checking what's said by the word of God
[3:29] now many times maybe you don't feel like
[3:31] you have to check me because I give you
[3:33] a scripture and a quote that's what I
[3:36] want to do I hope that's that's always
[3:39] my practice I hope that's always my
[3:40] habit is to give you a scripture give
[3:43] you a quote praise God I hope that's
[3:45] always my practice and I believe it will
[3:46] be but also Church you know you should
[3:48] take the things that's preached and you
[3:50] should go search it in the scriptures
[3:52] praise God you should have a concert
[3:54] because the Bible calls it Noble how
[3:57] many believe you're a spiritual King
[3:59] a spiritual Queen
[4:01] if you are then the Bible says you'll
[4:03] search the scriptures every day
[4:06] you'll study you'll comb you'll take
[4:08] notes or you'll you'll you'll look
[4:10] deeper at the word of God and say what
[4:11] can God teach me today because we don't
[4:14] have it all figured out right we don't
[4:16] have every answer praise God we all need
[4:18] to grow in Grace and knowledge of the
[4:20] Lord
[4:20] and so as we look at this thought on the
[4:22] word test and notice they they gave the
[4:26] word test to the prophet of the hour
[4:29] Paul Paul was the first church age
[4:31] Messenger right of Ephesus and they
[4:34] didn't just take his word and say wow
[4:35] I've seen enough from Paul I don't have
[4:37] to I don't have to look at what uh the
[4:39] Bible says about what Paul's preaching
[4:40] no they didn't take that for granted
[4:42] they made sure every day they took what
[4:45] the prophet said and pointed it back to
[4:46] the word
[4:48] praise God now if you would uh would you
[4:51] switch over there acacia
[4:53] now church I am a living example of this
[4:56] and so are you
[4:57] in other words we listen to brother
[4:59] Branham and then we go see what what he
[5:01] said make sure it was in the word of God
[5:03] and so this week I put out two videos
[5:05] like this
[5:08] brother William as you know too as we
[5:10] listen to the program every day as we
[5:12] listen to them or very often
[5:14] we hear so much that's true but then we
[5:16] hear The Human Side
[5:18] okay and so this is a proof uh this
[5:22] video series I've been working on this
[5:23] is a proof that we I take what the
[5:26] prophet said and I take everything back
[5:28] to the word of God
[5:31] now 95 or whatever I say 90 99 whatever
[5:35] you want to say a 90 percentage of what
[5:38] he says is right but then there's the
[5:39] Human Side that's just like every other
[5:42] man on the Earth
[5:44] and George if God didn't hide Paul's
[5:47] sins or Peter sins or David sins if God
[5:50] didn't hide Moses's sins from us well
[5:52] then why would God hide brother and sins
[5:54] from us
[5:55] why would we why would he afraid of
[5:57] Brothers mistakes if we're not afraid of
[5:59] David's mistakes
[6:02] that's why people criticize us or
[6:03] criticize People Like Us message
[6:05] churches like us who believe you have to
[6:07] show brother's Human Side
[6:08] and the reason they do that is because
[6:10] they criticize us is because they've got
[6:12] a deity spirit
[6:13] they're worshiping the man more than
[6:15] Jesus Christ
[6:16] but that's why God put all that in there
[6:18] about all Moses's failures all of
[6:21] Peter's failures because it would point
[6:23] to the fact there's only one worthy to
[6:25] open the seals and loose the Seven Seals
[6:27] thereof that was the Lamb of Hallelujah
[6:30] Glory
[6:31] now right now I've got 67 or 68 just
[6:33] examples of how brother man made human
[6:35] mistakes or he grew in his Revelation or
[6:37] brother around has quotes on two on both
[6:40] sides of an issue and they can't be both
[6:42] thus saith the Lord
[6:44] okay now this week I was listening to
[6:46] another sermon
[6:47] the rapture
[6:49] and I found a couple more human mistakes
[6:50] like for example he said Enoch walked
[6:52] with God 500 years
[6:55] and I can take you to the Book of
[6:56] Genesis and the Bible said all the days
[6:58] of Enoch's life were 365 years
[7:01] now who are you going to believe church
[7:03] I mean what are you going to believe
[7:05] that they say every word is thus saith
[7:06] the Lord I mean but then I find so much
[7:09] truth about this shout voice Trump and
[7:11] the coming of the Lord I mean just
[7:13] beautiful Revelations
[7:15] but you can't help it as you're
[7:16] listening you've got to take everything
[7:18] a prophet says back to the word of God
[7:21] and this series is not any anybody that
[7:23] loves God would know this series is to
[7:25] show not every word on brother Brown's
[7:27] tapes as thou saith the Lord
[7:28] and it's absolute proof and so I made a
[7:30] blog post our 67 proofs enough to prove
[7:33] to these people that not every word is
[7:35] thus say the Lord
[7:37] if it isn't then they're clearly
[7:39] deceived and they're confused but God is
[7:41] not the author of confusion praise God
[7:44] and God loves an honest heart amen
[7:47] that's actually the good ground is the
[7:49] good and honest heart praise God that
[7:50] brings forth fruit Hallelujah fruit
[7:53] under Perfection and if somebody can't
[7:55] be honest enough of themselves to say
[7:56] brother man was human then they can't be
[7:58] honest enough to even know they're saved
[8:00] how can they be honest enough to be
[8:02] saved or know they have the Holy Ghost
[8:03] and they can't honestly look at the fact
[8:05] that there's human mistakes on a tape
[8:07] how can they be honest with God if they
[8:09] can't be honest with men
[8:11] you can't be that's that's the reality
[8:13] you can't be honest with God if you're
[8:15] not honest with your man your fellow man
[8:17] and woman I'm sorry fellow man and woman
[8:19] everybody got that by God's grace
[8:21] okay so now uh just a little
[8:22] introduction there
[8:24] now the first church age
[8:27] Jesus applauded the Ephesians for
[8:30] testing the false prophets
[8:33] see the church the angel of the Church
[8:34] of Ephesus he says I know your Works
[8:37] your labor your patience and how you
[8:39] cannot bear them which are evil the
[8:41] church that's how we are we can't bear
[8:43] people that spread evil lies
[8:45] no we don't we don't go anti-christian
[8:47] on him and wish they died we pray for
[8:49] their repentance but there's a part of
[8:51] us that loves the word and anybody
[8:53] that's against the word we know is
[8:55] Antichrist
[8:56] amen
[8:58] right when they're honestly against the
[9:00] word we can't stand them which are evil
[9:02] and look this is what they did they
[9:04] tried them in other words they gave them
[9:06] the word test
[9:08] they said they were apostles
[9:11] but they're not and we and the Believers
[9:13] found them to be Liars
[9:15] they were lying about being apostle
[9:18] in other words today they're lying about
[9:20] me a message believer they're not really
[9:21] a message believer
[9:23] they're lying about being a Bible
[9:24] believer not really a Bible believer
[9:27] but how do they know they had to test
[9:29] them by the word of God
[9:31] the Bible didn't say test them by signs
[9:33] wonders and miracles although that's
[9:34] that's good it's good to have that the
[9:37] Bible said you tested them by the word
[9:39] of God prove all things search the
[9:41] Scriptures Daily praise God
[9:44] see and the the Believers born them they
[9:47] had patience and for my sake has labored
[9:50] and it's not fainted
[9:52] so we see the Christian Life in the
[9:54] Ephesian Church age was to labor be
[9:57] patient try people that say that exalt
[10:00] themselves as something great try them
[10:02] if they say there's something great and
[10:04] you'll find out by giving them in the
[10:05] word test are they truly an apostle or
[10:07] not an apostle
[10:09] Hallelujah
[10:12] the Bible said he that spiritual judges
[10:14] all things yet he himself is Judge of no
[10:16] man
[10:18] see nobody can judge you when the holy
[10:20] spirit's revealed to you the truth
[10:22] like our our stance on music or our
[10:23] stance on the baptism the Holy Ghost
[10:25] without sensation or our stance on uh
[10:28] modesty you know nobody can nobody can
[10:30] really judge us in other words their
[10:32] evil words don't hurt my feelings
[10:34] they can't judge me because I know it's
[10:36] the word of God has already been judged
[10:38] amen the word of God judges me praise
[10:39] God now the word of God has given me a
[10:43] liberty I know the word of God has given
[10:44] me direction praise God
[10:48] see spiritual men and women judge all
[10:50] things
[10:52] right and then we find some things are
[10:53] in the scripture most things you know
[10:55] most things we preach of course in the
[10:57] scripture but there are some areas of
[10:59] Liberty
[11:00] and if something's not in the scripture
[11:02] that's called an area of Christian
[11:03] Liberty
[11:05] praise God and there's there's a list of
[11:06] women my first book from 2019 I have a
[11:08] whole little section on there in chapter
[11:10] two of areas of Christian Liberty
[11:13] right some some of them deal with you
[11:15] know jewelry how much jewelry you wear
[11:16] uh wine how much wine you drink and
[11:19] where you drink wine
[11:21] uh there's numerous areas of Christian
[11:22] Liberty some of them are not coming to
[11:24] me right now but see a spiritual person
[11:27] will judge all things in other words
[11:29] you're I'll say like this every day
[11:30] we're giving ourselves the word test or
[11:32] we ought to be
[11:34] right give ourselves the word test prove
[11:36] yourself the Bible says prove your own
[11:38] selves praise God
[11:39] make your calling election sure now
[11:41] you're familiar with this scripture for
[11:43] the time is when you ought to be
[11:45] teachers and you have need that one
[11:47] teacher again to be the first principles
[11:49] of the Oracles of God and or become such
[11:51] as have need a milk and not a strong
[11:53] meat
[11:54] for everyone that uses milk is
[11:56] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[11:57] for he's a babe now we saw that a few
[11:59] months ago that deals with every
[12:00] denomination
[12:02] they never go into the deep things of
[12:04] God
[12:05] they just fail to go into it most of
[12:07] them
[12:07] right so then they're bringing forth
[12:09] milk instead of meat to the people
[12:13] they have a Milky sermon God loves you
[12:15] you're forgiven say a sinner's prayer
[12:18] you're going to heaven all these milky
[12:20] things but they don't get down into the
[12:22] depths of situations like the government
[12:24] or black lives matter or drug abuse
[12:28] or the leaders uh your daily life the
[12:31] music you listen to the apps that you're
[12:32] into they don't get down into the real
[12:34] depths of a Christian Life your everyday
[12:36] walk with the Lord praise God
[12:39] rarely do they and they won't say
[12:40] anything against certain things like
[12:42] homosexuality or they won't say they
[12:44] won't say nothing against that because
[12:45] it's all milk
[12:47] but the Bible says they're unskillful in
[12:49] the word of God in other words they
[12:51] should be higher in the things of God
[12:53] they should be able to understand more
[12:55] but they don't because they're still
[12:57] drinking milk they haven't moved on to
[13:00] Christian maturity
[13:02] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[13:05] full age even those who by reason of use
[13:07] have their senses exercised to discern
[13:10] both good and evil praise God so when
[13:13] you can look at your daily life and say
[13:14] this is good for me this is evil for me
[13:17] praise God like there's some websites
[13:19] you see if you see it pretty some pretty
[13:21] bad ads popping up you should have
[13:23] discernment to stop going to that
[13:25] website
[13:26] right that's just one example or if you
[13:28] like a certain uh podcast we talk about
[13:30] podcasts you like a certain YouTube
[13:32] channel or if you like a certain thing
[13:34] and you start hearing cuss words all the
[13:36] time we should have enough discernment
[13:37] to start turning that out
[13:39] praise God
[13:41] I had to do that over the years
[13:42] different people I liked or followed and
[13:44] I can't follow them anymore
[13:47] because it's not helping my Christian
[13:49] walk I can see the fruits of their
[13:51] decisions
[13:53] right you can see the fruits but I'm
[13:55] Discerning I'm judging good and evil in
[13:57] my life
[13:58] it's just pointing me to Christ or is
[14:00] this pointing me to other carnal things
[14:02] of the world
[14:04] you see the preaching of the word should
[14:06] do that it should point us to the truth
[14:08] and then the Holy Spirit should convict
[14:10] each one of us the next day when we go
[14:12] study our Bible and search the
[14:13] Scriptures Daily praise God as you're a
[14:16] noble Christian the Holy Spirit should
[14:18] convict you this is either discernment
[14:19] of good or this is evil Hallelujah
[14:23] and that's a mature Christian walk now
[14:25] we're eating some meat now we're not
[14:27] just sucking on a straw or getting milk
[14:29] or drinking milk now we're shooting into
[14:31] something that's got some meat it's got
[14:33] some texture it's got some spice to it
[14:35] it's got some flavor praise God Amen
[14:38] it got some variety it tastes good
[14:40] praise God
[14:41] amen
[14:43] what would you think if I told Malachi
[14:45] okay tonight Malachi for supper we're
[14:47] just having milk tonight what would he
[14:48] say he'd probably he'd probably pass out
[14:52] no he's growing he needs some meat he
[14:54] needs something to stick to those ribs
[14:56] or whatever they say that's what you
[14:58] need you can't come to church and get a
[14:59] milk sermon you've got to get a meanie
[15:01] sermon praise God
[15:03] something that'll stick to you something
[15:04] that will fill you up praise God
[15:07] Hallelujah and then you ought to go in
[15:09] the morning and make sure it was right
[15:10] praise God tomorrow morning
[15:12] Hallelujah search it every day
[15:16] that's the only way like my dad told me
[15:17] the greatest lesson I know my dad has
[15:18] many faults I love him but the greatest
[15:21] lesson ever taught to me was my dad
[15:23] when he said you've got to know Jesus
[15:25] Christ so well that no man can deceive
[15:27] you
[15:28] and all these men face to face and all
[15:30] these people on phone calls all these
[15:32] people come to the church try to deceive
[15:33] me or all these emails and things I get
[15:35] none of it can move me because I know
[15:37] Jesus Christ more than they do praise
[15:39] God and it ain't exalted me it's just
[15:42] when you seek God you know him praise
[15:44] God he said open the door and I'll come
[15:46] in and fellowship with you praise God
[15:48] and when I've had fellowship with Jesus
[15:50] that much then no man can deceive me
[15:53] how many could say Amen to that
[15:55] when you have fellowship with Jesus
[15:56] nobody can deceive you
[15:58] because you were there when he showed
[16:00] you the truth
[16:01] it was an experience
[16:04] he pointed you to the word of God
[16:05] hallelujah he fed you on the word of God
[16:09] he get church he doesn't give us dead
[16:11] bread he gives us living bread praise
[16:13] God in other words you'll be just
[16:14] reading along and all of a sudden
[16:16] something will pop out and ah it's alive
[16:17] that's what it is I know that's what
[16:20] I've been looking for praise God
[16:23] Hallelujah that's right
[16:27] it's living bread
[16:29] like we looked at uh the fresh bread in
[16:31] the Holy place a number of weeks ago
[16:33] right
[16:34] now let's look at some quotes here so
[16:35] you won't maybe need your Bibles here I
[16:37] won't be turning too much in Bibles
[16:39] there are 17 quotes and as I was
[16:41] thinking about the sermon for this week
[16:42] of this thought came to me a couple of
[16:44] times about the word test
[16:47] Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my
[16:49] church The Gates of Hell shall not
[16:50] Prevail against it Matthew 15. or 16
[16:53] rather what kind of rock was it our
[16:55] mother Catholic Church said it was upon
[16:57] Peter The Rock if that's right he backs
[16:59] it a few days later the Protestant said
[17:01] it was built upon Jesus The Rock but let
[17:03] me tell you my version of it who does
[17:05] man say I am one said you're Elias one
[17:07] said Moses one said this to the other
[17:09] but who do you say but who do you say it
[17:12] isn't what somebody else says it's what
[17:14] we think it's what you say where's you
[17:16] what's your opinion of it God asked that
[17:19] question to every man here tonight
[17:20] what's your opinion of this thing that's
[17:22] going on is it with the word test it
[17:25] with the word
[17:26] Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son
[17:28] of the Living God
[17:30] in other words tonight God is asking
[17:32] every person here and all those live
[17:34] streaming is this right or not test this
[17:37] by the word if Jesus asked Peter and he
[17:40] had the Keys of the Kingdom praise God
[17:41] he's going to ask all of us is it right
[17:43] or not praise God
[17:47] now in spoken word original C brother
[17:49] random as or says the word tests four
[17:51] times so this is the main sermon where
[17:53] he kind of labored on the word test
[17:55] and this was a
[17:56] combined six hours of sermons he
[17:58] preached in the morning I think four
[17:59] hours and two hours in the evening it's
[18:01] a six hour sermon series in one day he
[18:04] preached in six hours see Church you
[18:06] don't have it so bad you know
[18:08] there's no reason to complain I know you
[18:10] don't complain
[18:12] hey look he said look what kind of
[18:13] revivals they're having great revivals
[18:15] have had looks good doesn't it you say
[18:17] brother Brown now you got us on the limb
[18:18] that's where I wanted you so see there's
[18:20] going to times the holy spirit's gonna
[18:21] put you out on the limb
[18:23] you're out there it seems a little
[18:25] unstable what is he going to preach what
[18:27] is he going to say next and you're out
[18:29] there on the limb to see what you say
[18:31] about it what do you think about it you
[18:33] need to make a stand Jesus said what do
[18:35] you say
[18:36] who do you say like he told the
[18:37] disciples you want to go away too like
[18:39] there's going to be a work test for each
[18:40] one of us praise God
[18:42] yes we're strong yes we're stable but
[18:44] yet he's he allows us to go through
[18:46] tests and he puts you out on the limb
[18:48] what you gonna do
[18:49] you're out there on the limb don't feel
[18:51] safe don't feel so secure as you always
[18:53] do it's a word test but don't don't fret
[18:56] church God made a way that you can pass
[18:58] the test amen can't say like this
[19:00] brother William he gave you two wings to
[19:02] fly amen when you're out there on the
[19:04] way on the limb praise God if you fall
[19:06] he'll give you two Wings an Old
[19:07] Testament New Testament Spear and truth
[19:09] hallelujah he'll give you that to fly
[19:11] and you'll overcome so there's nothing
[19:14] up here for a Christian
[19:19] how are you going to know what's right
[19:20] or wrong give it the word test
[19:23] so there's revivals going around the
[19:25] message I've told you I think they're
[19:26] genuine revivals but there's a mixture
[19:28] in there of We're the greatest of all
[19:30] time
[19:31] so I give the Revival a word test well
[19:33] it looks like it looks like good signs
[19:35] good wonders good Miracles lies being
[19:36] changed but there's this attitude we're
[19:38] the greatest of all time amongst the
[19:40] preachers
[19:42] so I give it the word test
[19:44] you know some of the testimonies look
[19:45] good but I've got a I've got a little
[19:47] concern about the things that are being
[19:48] preached some of the things not all the
[19:49] things but just some of them
[19:51] see that's the way to tell whether it's
[19:53] right or wrong just give it the word
[19:55] test see what it says about the word any
[19:57] Spirit see what it says about the word
[19:58] if it denies the word it's not of God
[20:01] no matter what it is if it denies the
[20:03] word it's not of God look give it the
[20:04] words ask see what happens now church I
[20:06] want you to know tonight I'm not asking
[20:07] people for perfection
[20:09] because I'm not perfect
[20:11] Hallelujah
[20:13] William Brother William knows this
[20:14] brother Adam died and the church lady
[20:16] book came out and he still had in there
[20:17] he believed it was going to end by 77.
[20:20] God let him die with a human thought
[20:22] that wasn't right
[20:24] in other words you don't have to be
[20:25] perfect you don't have to know every
[20:26] answer but one thing you got to have you
[20:29] got to be saved and you want to be
[20:30] filled with the Holy Ghost amen that's
[20:32] one thing that you want praise God you
[20:35] want to know you're saved and you want
[20:36] to know that Christ lives in you praise
[20:38] God
[20:39] he just doesn't anoint you at times
[20:41] which we thank God for but he actually
[20:43] lives inside of you you see God you see
[20:46] your life on an upward angle not
[20:48] downward angle praise God
[20:50] I know you're ascending into spiritual
[20:52] things a life a life of Greater
[20:54] sacrifice a life of Greater Service A
[20:57] Life That's directing others you're
[20:59] going up to heaven you're saying follow
[21:01] my example and if you follow me then
[21:04] I'll lead you I'll lead you to Christ
[21:05] I'm going to heaven who will come along
[21:08] and go with me to my father's house amen
[21:10] come and go with me to my father's house
[21:12] is that that's what I'm going to be
[21:13] saying
[21:14] Jesus is the way to my father's house
[21:16] where there's joy joy joy
[21:19] come and go with me tomorrow see your
[21:21] your life is leaving a trail
[21:23] and people are going to follow it praise
[21:25] God
[21:26] says you never know your influence you
[21:29] parents you know the children are going
[21:30] to follow you right
[21:31] I got a promise he doesn't even follow
[21:33] me not guaranteed but I gotta I got a uh
[21:36] what is it called uh
[21:39] again the other word now when I preach
[21:40] that series
[21:41] probability I've got a strong
[21:42] probability if I've trained them up if
[21:44] my wife has trained them up then they
[21:46] will not leave the faith when they get
[21:47] older
[21:48] I got a strong possibility praise God
[21:52] by God's law of reaping and sowing
[21:54] Hallelujah
[21:55] see let's leave
[21:57] a testimony unless everybody see our
[21:59] life as ascending up towards heaven
[22:01] where marching to Zion beautiful
[22:03] beautiful Zion praise God
[22:08] no matter what if it denies the word
[22:09] it's not of God look give it the word
[22:11] test see what happens you say brother
[22:12] man don't you believe that Holy Ghost
[22:14] speaks in tongues yes sir but give it
[22:15] the word test now he's talking about the
[22:17] initial evidence here Janice and Jammers
[22:19] work miracles that's right didn't he yes
[22:21] sir Janice Jammers when Moses went down
[22:22] to Egypt everything that Moses done in
[22:24] the way of a sign Janice the Jammers
[22:26] them two witches could produce the same
[22:27] thing two Devils now no it's not
[22:29] everything right it was just the first
[22:30] two things
[22:32] out of the ten so there's another one I
[22:33] could use I there's another one that's
[22:35] not everywhere that I say the Lord see
[22:37] they could only impersonate or do the
[22:39] first two the first two uh signs or
[22:42] plagues
[22:44] see two Devils Moses would say please
[22:47] they'd say fleas Moses said a stick on
[22:49] the ground they said a stick on the
[22:50] ground a serpent a serpent that's right
[22:51] they could work miracles but the thing
[22:54] of it is how he's talking now to the
[22:56] Roman Catholic Church how can then she
[22:59] be a harlot why give her the word test
[23:01] that's how you know try your own the
[23:03] word once and see what she says oh of
[23:05] course we're taught in the Seminary them
[23:06] days it used to be that way but the way
[23:09] back in those days of Apostles that was
[23:11] only for the apostles only
[23:13] you so-called Church of Christ speak
[23:15] where the Bible speaks in silent well
[23:16] I'd like to hear you do some speaking
[23:18] now uh-huh no he says no he says this
[23:21] word you you be quiet God's word shuts
[23:23] everything up brother no man can brag
[23:25] that's right all her daughters are
[23:27] harlots how by the same as their Mammy
[23:29] committing the spiritual fornications
[23:31] against the word so Barbara says take
[23:33] the denominations and give them the word
[23:34] test
[23:36] right take the Catholic Church any
[23:38] nomination see that's why you left Glory
[23:40] because you gave your church the word
[23:42] test praise God you know something's
[23:44] different about the message something's
[23:45] different about that kind of preaching
[23:47] that's preaching I've never heard before
[23:48] that's how I knew this message was right
[23:50] the first sermon I heard was Sovereign
[23:52] seed and I never heard a man preach like
[23:54] that praise God it was God it was the
[23:56] voice of the Holy Spirit speaking
[23:58] through the word of God I heard the
[24:00] voice of God the Revelation was clear
[24:02] and I knew it was truth it reached out
[24:04] into my soul it touched my soul praise
[24:06] God
[24:07] amen
[24:09] Hallelujah it was the word test
[24:12] Hallelujah
[24:14] it's the word test
[24:16] all it took of many of us the first time
[24:18] we heard it
[24:20] it just changed our lives now not all of
[24:22] us but many of us that was some of our
[24:23] first experiences
[24:25] where God just reached out into your
[24:27] heart revealed himself like the Bible
[24:29] said with Lydia God open your heart
[24:31] aren't you glad your heart wasn't closed
[24:33] but your heart opened to the things of
[24:34] God
[24:36] I receive it I want more of it see you
[24:38] passed the word test
[24:40] he give you a plus praise God you passed
[24:42] the test Hallelujah you received the
[24:45] word of God tonight Hallelujah
[24:48] now here's a good quote too now with
[24:51] thousands of signed workers in the last
[24:52] day
[24:53] they've created a generation of sign
[24:55] Seekers that knows no more nothing about
[24:58] the true move of God and his word in
[25:00] these last days isn't that the truth so
[25:02] many people just want Miracles but they
[25:03] don't know anything about the word of
[25:04] God
[25:06] give them blood and oil and fleshy
[25:08] demonstrations on the platform they'll
[25:10] support it whether it's God's word or
[25:12] not whether it's scripture or Not Jesus
[25:14] have warned us such things at the end
[25:15] time Matthew 24 2 spirits very close
[25:18] alike deceive the very elected
[25:20] impossible Church don't go to sleep on
[25:22] this
[25:23] don't go to sleep on this remember I did
[25:25] that series on false prophets last year
[25:28] they now invite the people up and they
[25:30] don't say you have to speak in tongues
[25:32] they just say you need some something to
[25:33] happen on you
[25:35] and evil spirits come on
[25:37] that's closer than what it was before
[25:39] before it was you got to speak in
[25:40] tongues you got to speak that became far
[25:42] away but the enemy got more deceptive he
[25:44] said well you need a refreshinger you
[25:46] need a refilling and who knows what
[25:48] could happen and they put these demon
[25:49] spirits on the people and they shake and
[25:51] they they scream in pain
[25:53] it's it's awful I don't know if I ever
[25:55] showed you that one I don't know but
[25:57] it's getting more deceptive church now
[25:58] that's a denomination we'll you know
[26:00] we'll we'll see or the charismatic
[26:02] Movement we know they're way out the
[26:03] word of God but what about when it comes
[26:05] close to the message
[26:08] praise God
[26:09] it's getting closer and closer all the
[26:11] time
[26:13] right like the like the tape Church
[26:15] movement is so close because we believe
[26:17] God sent a prophet we believe there's
[26:19] nothing on the tapes
[26:20] we believe all those things and that's
[26:23] so close to the truth but then when they
[26:26] say every word that is so wrong
[26:29] praise God
[26:31] and yet they've had people raised from
[26:32] the dead supposedly in their services
[26:34] we'll give them the word test do they
[26:36] say with the word of God not all the
[26:38] time
[26:39] so we stay away from those lies
[26:42] praise God but it's going to be so close
[26:45] it may deceive the very left everywhere
[26:47] possible it ain't possible though to
[26:49] deceive you and I
[26:50] that's one thing Lord that ain't
[26:52] possible praise God Satan might trick me
[26:54] and get me in a trap he might catch me
[26:55] to snare but by the grace of God I'm
[26:58] coming out of that praise God Amen
[27:00] because I cannot say deceived that long
[27:02] praise God I could not be in sin that
[27:04] long because there's a promise God's
[27:06] children cannot be enslaved praise God
[27:08] God's children are Overcomers amen
[27:11] that's what he said to he that overcomes
[27:13] amen that's what the rewards are for
[27:15] those people that overcome the devil
[27:18] praise God
[27:19] they can't be kept entrapped they're
[27:21] Eagles praise God they've got to fly
[27:23] they got their flying eels they've got
[27:25] to rise up in this hour they've got to
[27:27] come out of Earthly things they've got
[27:29] to be Heavenly Birds amen
[27:34] how can you tell them give them the word
[27:36] test how can you know it speak the word
[27:38] see church we have to argue we have to
[27:40] be anything like that just speak the
[27:41] word see what they say
[27:43] to speak the word
[27:46] see what they say about it if they don't
[27:48] believe the word they have no germ seed
[27:50] in them
[27:52] they are of the evil one and deceive you
[27:53] as the first bride was the seed and the
[27:56] second bride was deceived they're
[27:57] deceivers of the third bride by
[27:58] hybriding the word or trying to God
[28:01] never placed signs I love this quote God
[28:03] never plays signs above the word
[28:06] and the church said I saw the film like
[28:09] ma where's this quote been praise God I
[28:11] feel like I hadn't read it in a while oh
[28:13] that's beautiful amen God never does
[28:15] that praise God
[28:18] God never placed signs ahead of his word
[28:21] that's a scorcher
[28:23] God never play signs that is the word
[28:25] they were added for proof of the word
[28:27] but the word is first
[28:29] Jesus said if you can't believe my words
[28:31] believe me because of the works right so
[28:33] we see that too his work spoke but Jesus
[28:36] also said you know my doctrines from God
[28:39] because you'll do their will you'll do
[28:41] the will of God and then you'll know
[28:43] that it's God
[28:45] in other words I can tell Austin Lena as
[28:47] early Believers if you do this God will
[28:49] do this
[28:51] and they'll know my Doctrine is right or
[28:53] they'll know the preacher Doctrine is
[28:54] right because if they approach god with
[28:56] the same Faith the same promises they'll
[28:58] get the same results ah hallelujah
[29:01] praise God now it might not come at the
[29:03] right time and season or when we think
[29:04] it should but if you if you trust God if
[29:07] you believe God then God's word will
[29:09] back itself up praise God
[29:11] will back his word up
[29:14] Hallelujah
[29:16] and he the scripture for that where's
[29:18] the scripture for that brother Jesse
[29:19] it's in First Kings 17 or 18 if I'm not
[29:22] mistaken
[29:24] Elijah told the woman the widow woman
[29:25] bake me a cake first then watch the
[29:28] miracle happen
[29:29] come to the word first then watch the
[29:31] miracle the seed word itself is what the
[29:34] Holy Spirit energizes
[29:36] so you've got to receive the letter
[29:37] first can I say like that you got to
[29:39] receive the spoken word the word of God
[29:41] first and then the holy spirit will make
[29:43] this word live praise God but let me say
[29:46] let me say like this though when you
[29:48] hear him believe it that's the Living
[29:49] Word too praise God
[29:51] right your soul receives a Living Word
[29:54] the spiritual food but then God will
[29:56] also do Supernatural signs wonders and
[29:57] miracles to let you know this message is
[30:00] Right praise God
[30:01] and the message is the Bible verses like
[30:03] brothers said in the Rapture message uh
[30:05] December 5th 1965. brother Adam said you
[30:08] hear these Brethren talk about the mess
[30:09] what is the message it's the scriptures
[30:11] that God is scripturally vindicating
[30:13] right now it's the promised word the
[30:16] promised Bible verses of the hour amen
[30:19] that's the real definition of the
[30:20] message it's the Bible verses that God's
[30:23] fulfilling right now Hallelujah
[30:26] it's not every human thought a brother
[30:27] random or human thought of Billy Paul or
[30:29] Joseph Branham it's the Bible verses
[30:31] that God's fulfilling right now praise
[30:34] God
[30:35] Hallelujah I got about 50 quotes brother
[30:37] says the message is the message is that
[30:39] brother William you probably heard it
[30:40] the message is Hebrews 13 8. the message
[30:42] is Malachi 4 5 and 6.
[30:45] I mean there's like 50 of them there's
[30:46] and what is it those are all the
[30:48] scriptures that God's doing right now
[30:50] praise God
[30:52] that's what the message is praise God
[30:54] one place he said my message is
[30:56] justification sanctification baptism of
[30:58] the Holy that's the word of God Amen
[31:00] that's the word for this hour praise God
[31:04] but people say message and they'll think
[31:05] tapes or message of my opinions
[31:09] you know they think they they mix that
[31:10] in there and that's where they get off
[31:12] but see give it the word test and you'll
[31:15] see what's right
[31:16] give it the word test does God tell a
[31:18] lie does God have to apologize or
[31:20] anything does God ever get numbers mixed
[31:22] up
[31:23] no I don't have to apologize to anybody
[31:25] and yeah brother man will repeatedly
[31:27] apologize I'm sorry about this which was
[31:28] good that's a humble Christian thing to
[31:30] do but he wasn't Jesus was Jesus in him
[31:33] yes but Jesus and you too
[31:35] praise God he's a prophet we're no
[31:38] prophets but now if the prophet's gone
[31:40] then the Holy Spirit the move is on the
[31:42] broad amen
[31:44] Hallelujah brother Adam said the spirit
[31:47] the bride and the prophet will all say
[31:50] the same thing and everything they say
[31:52] will be already found in the word of God
[31:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[31:57] see a lot of these people are not saying
[31:59] what brother Brandon said or what the
[32:01] Bible says how do we know all right
[32:02] brother Austin because what we say is in
[32:04] the word of God hallelujah amen
[32:08] that makes us right
[32:09] but you got to give it the word test
[32:13] you've got to speak and just speak the
[32:14] word
[32:15] see what they say about the word now
[32:17] remember I'm not asking for Perfection
[32:18] but I'm asking for humility right we're
[32:21] asking for humility like I love I love
[32:23] Paul and Peter Peter Peter was you know
[32:26] uh discriminating and Paul goes right up
[32:29] and brother said he stuck his finger
[32:30] under his nose and says you're the
[32:32] guilty man and he humbled himself
[32:34] now Church which of us would humble
[32:36] himself now bear with me Malachi but
[32:37] what if I put my finger under his nose
[32:40] what if I put my finger under you guys
[32:42] knows what we I said you're wrong about
[32:44] would you say oh thanks brother Jess
[32:46] or would you say nobody talks to me like
[32:47] that
[32:50] don't get your finger out of my face now
[32:51] I'm not saying Paul actually did that
[32:53] but he went face to face and said you're
[32:56] wrong about this you're to be blamed
[32:59] and what if I went up to you and said
[33:01] you're to be blamed it's your fault
[33:03] do you still love me
[33:05] but that's what the Holy Spirit did in
[33:07] Paul
[33:08] through Peter he gave him the word test
[33:10] my church I'm not looking at you and
[33:12] your mistakes I'm not trying to point
[33:13] out anybody's mistakes here because we
[33:14] all have mistakes about making the point
[33:16] how many of us could receive correction
[33:18] how many of us would pass the word test
[33:20] if someone come brought us the word of
[33:21] God now hoping we would pass it by God's
[33:24] grace
[33:25] Hallelujah
[33:28] so remember signs are never placed ahead
[33:30] of God's word
[33:34] now brother man another place says uh
[33:37] there's a voice to the signs
[33:40] and so so sometimes God will do Miracles
[33:43] or signs but then you got to hang around
[33:44] you got to believe the sign but then
[33:46] listen to what the voice says afterwards
[33:49] that's what Moses Moses had two signs
[33:51] so he got Israel's attention he got
[33:53] Egypt's attention but you had to stay
[33:55] around and listen for the voice what did
[33:56] the message say
[33:58] let my people go well how many Saints
[34:01] would say would say Amen to that give it
[34:03] the word I believe that but it didn't
[34:05] happen right away you had to hang around
[34:08] think about that Moses day even though
[34:10] you saw these Miracles it got harder to
[34:12] be a believer
[34:16] they started complaining against Moses
[34:18] you're making life harder for us
[34:21] see the devil always give you something
[34:22] to complain about but let's choose not
[34:24] to complain Hallelujah life may get
[34:26] harder
[34:27] right but listen to the look at the
[34:29] signs and listen to the voice of God
[34:31] listen to the word of God because the
[34:33] word of God will ultimately set you free
[34:35] Hallelujah
[34:36] it's for a test it's fourth season
[34:40] how can you tell brother bam what's
[34:42] right or wrong give him the word test
[34:45] that'll tell whether they're right or
[34:47] wrong or not say right with the word see
[34:49] see what happens just throw the word
[34:51] down there and see where that I like
[34:53] that just I'm not going to throw this
[34:54] but just throw it down there
[34:58] see where they're at
[35:00] just throw it down there all you gotta
[35:01] do is lay out the word of God well the
[35:02] Bible says fathers it's an Holy Ghost
[35:04] but then Jesus said ten days or Peter
[35:05] said 10 days later Lord Jesus Christ you
[35:07] see where they're at
[35:09] just give him the word test
[35:12] oh every words thou saith the Lord
[35:14] well where's the Bible say uh
[35:16] Enoch lived for 500 years where the
[35:19] bible say that
[35:22] there's a quote in 1965 a month before
[35:24] brother died he said if people are going
[35:26] to die and go to an eternal hell
[35:28] I got to go brother
[35:30] I had to listen to it it's just a slip
[35:32] of the tongue
[35:33] what's up with the tongue
[35:35] right you're made of 80 percent water
[35:37] and petroleum
[35:39] if petroleum it's it's diesel fluid
[35:41] diesel fuel uh it can also make gasoline
[35:45] and kerosene if you get any of that in
[35:47] any living thing it dies
[35:50] always thus saith the Lord we'll give
[35:52] them the word test
[35:55] okay then you'll be the first one to
[35:56] drink this gallon of petroleum
[35:58] and I'll be ready to call 9-1-1 as soon
[36:00] as you take your first sip
[36:01] they're going to pump your stomach
[36:04] right
[36:06] see just lay just lay the word out there
[36:08] just lay it out there
[36:10] and they'll manifest what they're aren't
[36:11] you glad you're saying hallelujah the
[36:13] word of God takes away every Veil amen
[36:16] the word of God strips it all down all
[36:18] these masks all these uh confusion all
[36:20] this Darkness the word of God scatters
[36:22] all there and you see what's laying
[36:24] behind there praise God
[36:26] is that a Believer or not a Believer
[36:28] give him the word test
[36:34] oh then get right away then yeah just
[36:37] stay right with that word so if they
[36:39] give Makai the word test he proved out
[36:41] he was 100 with it
[36:45] had 400 prophets all saying ahab's going
[36:49] to go up Ahab is going to conquer he's
[36:51] going to come back and Makai is the only
[36:53] one that said you go up there and you're
[36:55] going to die
[36:57] who was right the 400 or the one
[37:00] the one who stayed with what Elijah said
[37:02] the dogs will lick his bones
[37:05] is that right lick his blood rather
[37:08] see who's right
[37:10] most the time it's not the majority we
[37:11] saw that in the 2020 election all those
[37:13] charismatics that Trump's going to get
[37:15] in he has two two consecutive terms the
[37:16] Lord showed me the Lord didn't show them
[37:18] nothing
[37:19] they were all wrong
[37:22] they had a 50 chance to get it and they
[37:25] had four years to guess it and they
[37:26] couldn't find the mind of God to get get
[37:28] it right with a 50 chance
[37:33] I didn't see anybody get it right
[37:36] another man so what good what good would
[37:37] do you anyway to guess the president
[37:39] what good would do you it's a 50 chance
[37:41] you're gonna get it right anyway that's
[37:42] nothing Supernatural
[37:48] when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost
[37:49] and say you got the Holy Ghost and then
[37:51] deny God's word
[37:53] say you believed and received the Holy
[37:55] Ghost then deny that the word is true
[37:56] then how can that be the Holy Ghost when
[37:58] he was the one that wrote the Bible
[38:01] the Holy Ghost deny his own words say I
[38:03] was wrong you're right no that ain't God
[38:05] no sir
[38:07] sharp sword
[38:08] Lord send us a great message that's what
[38:10] we're looking for then of course when he
[38:13] comes to fix those stones to cut them
[38:14] out to stand for the building what will
[38:16] happen many of them won't stand for the
[38:18] word test they'll love their
[38:19] organization better than they love the
[38:20] word although the word be Vindicated by
[38:23] that man he'll be a prophet that will
[38:24] come in the name of the Lord and he'll
[38:26] be the one that will come upon the earth
[38:27] I believe it oh everybody says it'll be
[38:29] a group of people I want somebody to
[38:31] show me the Bible where it'll be a group
[38:32] of people God would break his own word
[38:34] he can't do that no sir he promises
[38:36] it'll be one man now this is speaking of
[38:38] Revelation 10 7. there's one man there's
[38:41] one seventh angel that the mystery of
[38:43] God is finished through
[38:44] that was God's Prophet brother Brandon
[38:47] it's not going to be a group that's
[38:48] going to finish the mystery of God
[38:49] brother Brown finished the mystery of
[38:50] God
[38:52] you can't do that no sir it'll be one
[38:53] man and then there'll be others with him
[38:55] how many with him tonight
[38:56] that's you and I said you could say amen
[38:59] that's okay to say Amen
[39:00] I'm not trying to I'm not trying to put
[39:01] anybody on a limb now

[39:05] Church Believers will be with him
[39:07] everywhere
[39:08] even in Akron Ohio praise God they'll be
[39:11] with that one man that one Prophet who
[39:13] restores the word of God back to its
[39:15] original condition
[39:18] now Jesus come and brought the test oh
[39:20] do you know that Jesus brought the word
[39:21] test
[39:22] how many knew that by God's grace
[39:25] his word test was search the scriptures
[39:28] for in them you think you have eternal
[39:30] life and they are they which testify me
[39:33] wow so the word test According To Jesus
[39:36] and Paul is will you search the
[39:38] scriptures to make sure it's right
[39:43] could they stand the test
[39:46] would those Pharisees look in the word
[39:47] and say oh yes Jesus was born in
[39:49] Bethlehem oh yes a star of David did
[39:52] rise the star of Star of David did rise
[39:54] star would rise out of Bethlehem
[39:57] did they really search that out though
[39:59] to the Pharisees inside you see search
[40:01] that out friends

[40:12] cracked water broke it won't stand the
[40:13] test oh man then be sent to the scrap
