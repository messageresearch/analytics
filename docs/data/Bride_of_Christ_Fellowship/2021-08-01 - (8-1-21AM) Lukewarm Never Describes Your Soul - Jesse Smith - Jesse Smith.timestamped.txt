[0:00] gracious taste let's open up our bibles
[0:02] here this morning
[0:04] let me take a little break on the normal
[0:06] services like
[0:08] so for example i may preach the joshua
[0:09] message tonight we'll kind of see how
[0:11] that goes
[0:13] i like to preach on that thought about
[0:14] lukewarmness again i just preached a
[0:16] short little
[0:18] a few thoughts on it a couple wednesdays
[0:20] ago but i want to preach a full sermon
[0:22] on it today
[0:23] to kind of anchor the church in the
[0:25] truth of god's word praise god let's go
[0:27] to revelation 3 14.
[0:40] revelation 3 14.
[0:45] so it's revelation 3 16 rather pardon me
[0:48] revelation 3
[0:56] 16.
[1:01] i'd like to read in just three small
[1:02] portions of scripture here
[1:05] revelation 3
[1:10] i'll just read this myself verse 16 says
[1:11] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[1:13] neither cold nor hot
[1:15] i will spew thee out of my mouth so
[1:18] there's
[1:18] hot lukewarm and cold
[1:22] they go to luke 3 16. so these are both
[1:25] 3 16
[1:26] right revelation 3 16 luke 3 16.
[1:38] here's john the baptist
[1:41] speaking here remember he got the holy
[1:43] ghost on his human spirit while in the
[1:45] womb
[1:45] praise god hallelujah so if anybody knew
[1:48] about the fire of god
[1:50] under the old testament it was john the
[1:52] baptist praise god john 3 16.
[1:55] i'm sorry no it's luke's at 3 16 sorry
[1:56] luke 3 16
[1:58] john answered saying unto them all i
[1:59] indeed baptize you with water
[2:01] but one mightier than i cometh the
[2:04] latchette of whose shoes i am not worthy
[2:06] to loose
[2:07] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[2:09] and with
[2:11] fire fire so jesus christ baptizes you
[2:14] he immerses your soul
[2:16] with the holy ghost and
[2:22] at the end of the church jesus says you
[2:23] got to be hot on fire
[2:26] so what how is he going to do how are
[2:27] you going to do that by the baptism of
[2:28] the holy ghost
[2:30] okay acts 2 verse 3 acts 2 verse 3 last
[2:32] scripture will read this one together
[2:45] acts two verse three let's read verse
[2:47] three and four together here acts 2
[2:50] verse
[2:50] 3 and 4. let's begin on three one two
[2:53] three
[2:54] and there appeared unto them cloven
[2:57] tongues like as of fire
[2:59] and it sat upon each of them and they
[3:02] were all filled with the holy
[3:04] ghost and began to speak with other
[3:06] tongues
[3:07] as the spirit gave them utterance so
[3:09] here's what john was talking about
[3:11] he said he's going to baptize you with
[3:12] the holy ghost and
[3:14] fire and it happened praise god and
[3:16] every believer ever since who's got
[3:18] baptized with the holy ghost
[3:19] whether you saw the fire or not the fire
[3:22] went deep down
[3:23] past your forehead past your mind and
[3:25] down into your soul
[3:27] praise god let's have one more word of
[3:28] prayer if you have a need on your heart
[3:29] let's make it known to god today
[3:31] heavenly father we just love you we give
[3:33] you thanks and praise it's a joy to sing
[3:35] to you lord
[3:35] oh we magnify you today oh we've tasted
[3:38] and seen that the lord is good
[3:40] the lord we want a fresh taste lord we
[3:42] want to a freshly lord partake of your
[3:44] spiritual food today
[3:45] give us a fresh outpouring lord god just
[3:48] a special anointing today by the power
[3:50] of the holy ghost thank you for these
[3:51] songs
[3:52] thank you for the saints that can be in
[3:53] your house for guiding us here
[3:55] you protected us lord god and we give
[3:56] you thanks and praise now lord we read
[3:59] your word take these words lord break
[4:00] them to us
[4:01] that you might be glorified that we
[4:03] might leave here stronger than when we
[4:04] came in lord god for the glory of god
[4:06] make us mold for the kingdom of god
[4:08] we pray in jesus christ's name and the
[4:10] saint said
[4:11] amen god bless you as you being seated
[4:13] praise god
[4:18] i do have some slides here some quotes
[4:20] to show in some scriptures so
[4:22] that will be helpful for you i believe
[4:26] like i said i just want to take a normal
[4:28] break i uh from the regular
[4:30] joshua series although i do have a
[4:31] sermon ready i did study on that
[4:33] yesterday i have a sermon ready on that
[4:35] chapter 13 in joshua but i kind of felt
[4:38] like
[4:38] this was such an important issue i guess
[4:40] i was i was kind of inspired by brother
[4:42] william when he was uh
[4:43] we were talking on wednesday and and uh
[4:47] he was saying over the years he's been
[4:48] the message for what 40 years
[4:50] maybe longer he said over the years you
[4:53] know
[4:53] he's seen uh people go up for prayer
[4:57] and uh and and sometimes the preachers
[5:00] will
[5:01] say they're lukewarm or something like
[5:02] that right i think we were talking about
[5:04] that
[5:05] and how our church that can be that can
[5:07] be such a
[5:08] hard thing to hear right because if you
[5:11] if you look at the context of lukewarm
[5:14] the word lukewarm is only used one time
[5:16] in the bible
[5:17] and that's right there in revelation 3
[5:20] and the lukewarm person is actually spit
[5:22] out of the mouth of christ
[5:25] so when he said that it just struck me
[5:26] like wow i wonder how many people were
[5:29] maybe they were they were truly born
[5:31] again but they were going through a
[5:32] difficult
[5:33] season right where they were struggling
[5:35] in their mind
[5:37] but yet a preacher or maybe a friend
[5:39] could say oh you're just lukewarm
[5:42] and how that could be such a a a tactic
[5:45] of satan
[5:46] to discourage the saints right
[5:50] and get them to doubt because i don't
[5:51] know about you but almost every morning
[5:53] i wake up feeling lukewarm
[5:55] i don't know about you maybe when i was
[5:57] younger now i had a lot more fire and
[5:59] zeal now getting getting older
[6:01] i wake up tired now all the time and i
[6:03] wake up i don't want to read my bible
[6:04] you know
[6:05] i don't want to pray i'm just tired and
[6:07] worn out you know
[6:10] and so you know we all feel lukewarm in
[6:13] our flesh
[6:14] in fact the bible says our flesh is
[6:17] enmity against the spirit
[6:19] he said paul said it's enmity uh the
[6:22] flesh
[6:22] fights against the holy spirit and so
[6:25] we've got to
[6:26] we got to war against the flesh we have
[6:29] to put on a war and say okay it's time
[6:31] to go to battle
[6:33] right a few minutes after you wake up
[6:34] right here it's time to go to battle
[6:36] it's time to cast down this dead man
[6:40] right it's time to cast down this body
[6:43] of death the bible calls it
[6:45] and so if i had a title i'd say lukewarm
[6:47] never
[6:48] describes a holy ghost-filled christian
[6:51] soul and i
[6:52] want to put the word soul in there but
[6:54] lukewarm never describes your soul
[6:56] i could just shorten it like that a
[6:59] born-again christian is never lukewarm
[7:01] in their soul
[7:03] and and god never used that word for
[7:05] your mind
[7:07] so for me i just take it out out of my
[7:09] vocabulary for me totally
[7:12] and i've studied most of brother ham's
[7:13] quotes not all of them but i got through
[7:15] most of the lukewarm quotes and he never
[7:17] applies it to himself
[7:20] either lukewarm church member who's not
[7:22] born again
[7:23] he never applies it to himself okay
[7:27] so i want you to put that word lukewarm
[7:28] i want you to put a little
[7:30] uh marker on there and say not me
[7:33] not applied to me that's like saying
[7:36] well i'm blind i'm spiritually blind no
[7:37] you're not
[7:38] you can see the word of god amen right
[7:42] and even the sleeping virgin i'm not
[7:44] sleeping like i never apply that to me
[7:47] i'm never the sleeping virgin i'm never
[7:48] the blind person i'm never the lukewarm
[7:51] person i'm never them
[7:53] i'm battling in my mind because my mind
[7:56] gets weird my mind gets tired but i
[7:58] never place myself
[7:59] in that foolish virgin or judas iscariot
[8:02] group
[8:03] i'm always in that wise virgin group
[8:05] that's hot for jesus amen
[8:08] of course i don't always act like it
[8:09] paul didn't always act like it
[8:11] peter for sure didn't always act like it
[8:13] right because we have an example of him
[8:15] discriminating against gentiles
[8:17] wouldn't even eat with them right so we
[8:20] have examples of peter that's why i can
[8:22] say peter specifically
[8:23] because we have specific examples where
[8:26] he fell
[8:26] short of the glory of god yet he had the
[8:29] baptism of the holy ghost and fire amen
[8:32] yet church yes somebody can look at
[8:33] peter and say i saw the fire of god on
[8:35] your forehead
[8:36] and yet the fire wasn't in his mind at
[8:39] that moment fear was in his mind at that
[8:41] moment
[8:42] see that church so i want to just want
[8:45] you to notice
[8:46] if the fire of god is entered into you
[8:48] you'll never be lukewarm in the sight of
[8:50] god
[8:52] because that's a condition where someone
[8:54] is lukewarm where god can never speak
[8:56] through them oh
[8:57] let our desire be god always speak
[8:59] through me amen
[9:01] even in my weak conditions speak through
[9:03] me when i'm when i'm really on fire
[9:05] speak through me when i'm
[9:06] encouraged when i'm when i'm bold speak
[9:08] through me let me be your voice to this
[9:11] generation
[9:13] now let's preach through it i've already
[9:14] preached the majority thoughts of the
[9:15] sermon so
[9:16] let me go ahead and preach through it
[9:18] here now look at those are just
[9:20] beautiful texts jesus says
[9:22] or paul or john the baptist said jesus
[9:23] is going to give you fire
[9:25] right and then the fire came on the day
[9:27] of pentecost
[9:28] and it's been this fire has been burning
[9:31] in every believer's heart
[9:32] ever since let me set a timer here i'm
[9:35] going to try to
[9:36] spare uh myself and you here
[9:39] we'll see how the holy spirit leads so
[9:41] from these two texts jesus sent
[9:43] the baptism of the holy ghost so his
[9:45] fire would abide in our souls forever
[9:48] making us his mouthpiece he would not
[9:50] speak through the lukewarm group
[9:54] so if you look at the context of
[9:55] revelation 3 it's the laodicean age
[9:59] it's the age of the rights of the people
[10:01] that's what laodicea means
[10:02] justice of the people right so the
[10:04] rights of the people everybody wants
[10:06] rights
[10:07] okay so uh in this age in this seventh
[10:11] church age
[10:13] there's going to be three groups hot
[10:15] lukewarm
[10:17] cold but jesus says specifically i'm not
[10:19] speaking out of the lukewarm the church
[10:21] just look just think about the people
[10:22] you witness to
[10:24] if god's ever had you witnessed to
[10:25] somebody and spoke through you or
[10:27] prayed for somebody and healed through
[10:28] you you were god's mouthpiece
[10:31] praise god you were you were god's
[10:32] mouthpiece amen
[10:34] right so we have to look at this and
[10:36] realize the bride of christ
[10:37] will always be the mouthpiece of christ
[10:40] she will not be spewed out we'll get to
[10:42] that a little bit
[10:43] because the old testament gives us more
[10:44] clues about why they're spewed out
[10:47] okay of course we have a lot of them too
[10:49] but we have to place this let's place
[10:50] this lukewarm group
[10:52] among the bible groups because brother
[10:54] and taught us that there's groups in the
[10:56] bible and so did jesus of course
[10:58] uh so here's the verse because you're
[11:00] lukewarm i'll spew you spew the out so
[11:02] three conditions
[11:03] hot lukewarm cold the lukewarm never
[11:06] speak for jesus and of course the cold
[11:08] wouldn't
[11:08] so there's only one group on this earth
[11:10] that speaks for jesus
[11:12] aren't you glad to be a part of that
[11:13] group amen
[11:15] you have the fire of god burning in you
[11:16] you may not be perfect all the time but
[11:18] there's times where you know the fire of
[11:21] god is burned up in you and you've said
[11:22] exactly what god wanted you to say
[11:26] hallelujah you spoke for god hallelujah
[11:29] you were god's mouthpiece
[11:31] to this generation whether they accept
[11:33] it or not amen
[11:34] whether they want to or not if you tell
[11:36] them the truth you are god's mouthpiece
[11:39] and they'll answer church they'll answer
[11:41] for that on the day of judgment
[11:44] now look go to isaiah 28 because i i
[11:48] didn't put the whole verses just the
[11:49] same time
[11:50] in isaiah 28 we see the same condition
[11:54] of a spewed out church now think about
[11:58] that
[11:58] how think about the condition of most
[12:01] churches today
[12:02] they're in a condition of sickness
[12:04] they're spiritually sick and god's not
[12:06] there
[12:08] right because jesus is not going to hang
[12:10] around a house
[12:11] that's filthy right that's got vomit in
[12:14] it he's not going to hang around a
[12:15] church that's got spiritual vomit in it
[12:17] right he says
[12:21] out of my mouth you are out of the body
[12:23] you're not in the body of christ
[12:25] you're not my mouthpiece he and then he
[12:27] said he's knocking on the doors trying
[12:28] to get back in there clean it up let me
[12:30] in
[12:30] but you got to clean it up right right
[12:33] you got to get saved sanctified
[12:35] holy ghost then i'll come in with the
[12:36] holy ghost if you get cleaned up
[12:39] look at the condition of the church and
[12:41] see church we ought to be thankful
[12:42] uh all those small numbers we ought to
[12:44] be thankful we got a and span
[12:46] church
[12:48] we're cleaned out there's no vomit here
[12:50] there's fresh bread
[12:52] here there's wine here and oil amen
[12:55] hallelujah praise god because christ
[12:57] himself walks up and down these pews
[12:59] his angels protect you and guide you and
[13:02] bring you here
[13:03] christ is with us amen hallelujah
[13:07] i've been to other churches i know he's
[13:09] not in the other churches
[13:11] hallelujah i know christ is here amen
[13:15] because he backs up his word praise god
[13:17] he gives us what we have need of
[13:18] like when we're sick he heals us
[13:20] hallelujah
[13:21] when we need revelation he strengthens
[13:23] us when we need direction
[13:24] he shows us the way praise god when we
[13:27] need teaching he teaches
[13:28] us when we need rebuked he rebukes us
[13:31] when we need
[13:31] love he loves us hallelujah he pours out
[13:35] his love amen
[13:37] and his kindness and his mercy his
[13:39] goodness is poured out in the house of
[13:41] god
[13:42] amen everything i needed in my earthly
[13:45] journey i found it through
[13:47] the house of god that's why god never
[13:50] intended you to go to a certain
[13:52] convention to get the holy ghost
[13:54] god never intended you had to go to
[13:55] mecca like the islam
[13:58] god never intended you've got to go to
[13:59] jerusalem he said whosoever
[14:02] shall call upon the name of the lord
[14:04] shall be saved
[14:06] it's to you to your children them that
[14:08] are far
[14:09] off as many as the lord our god shall
[14:11] call praise god
[14:13] he said where to our three are gathered
[14:16] there i am in the midst of you amen
[14:20] but see denominational people got in my
[14:22] way i got to go this i got to go there
[14:24] you got to go on your knees is where you
[14:26] need to go praise god
[14:29] you got to get on your knees and confess
[14:30] your filthiness amen
[14:32] confess your sins he'll wipe it away
[14:34] he'll cleanse it better than bleach amen
[14:38] he'll cleanse it better than clorox
[14:39] hallelujah
[14:41] and then his presence will come in and
[14:43] fill you with joy amen
[14:46] power faith amen he'll fill you with his
[14:49] attributes
[14:50] his character his grace amen
[14:53] hallelujah thank god for the house of
[14:56] the lord amen
[14:58] i've needed nothing else but to sit
[15:00] under the presence of the holy ghost
[15:02] hearing the real word of god hearing the
[15:04] mouthpiece of christ
[15:06] that's all i needed praise god now look
[15:09] at
[15:10] chapter 28 here's another church in a
[15:13] vomit condition as gross as it is and
[15:15] it's one of the worst things i hate at
[15:16] our house you know somebody gets sick
[15:20] but in verses verse six this is a sphere
[15:24] of judgment
[15:24] has come upon israel remember isaiah is
[15:28] about 700 years before christ
[15:31] so they're they're not going to have a
[15:32] real another prophet until malachi right
[15:34] he's about 400 years before christ
[15:37] there's going to be a big break between
[15:38] isaiah and malachi
[15:40] but the spirit of judgment and god is
[15:42] going to god is going to there there's
[15:44] there it is god's going to spew them out
[15:45] of the land
[15:46] the bible says he's going to spew him
[15:47] out so their church is already in a
[15:50] vomit condition
[15:51] and so god said because of that i'm
[15:53] going to spew you out of the land
[15:56] see they're no longer going to be his
[15:57] light no longer be as this grace
[15:59] covenant people
[16:00] his light to the world right he's going
[16:02] to spew them out of the land
[16:03] so they're under judgment in verse 6
[16:06] verse 6 says
[16:07] for a spirit of judgment to him that
[16:09] sitteth in judgment
[16:12] all right now israelis now look their
[16:14] crown what are they crowned with
[16:16] what is the authority on their lives
[16:18] pride
[16:20] a crown represents authority so what
[16:22] authority do they have in this life not
[16:24] the authority of christ
[16:26] not the authority of the holy ghost
[16:28] their authority comes by pride
[16:30] i'm better than you i know more about it
[16:32] than you i know more than the prophets
[16:35] right i i know more than the bible i
[16:38] know more than jesus
[16:39] it's pride right there the bible said
[16:42] they're crowned with pride
[16:44] and they're also drunken with natural
[16:46] drink right
[16:47] that's what verse 1 and verse 3 says so
[16:50] because they're so prideful
[16:51] they feel like they can give into the
[16:53] flesh that's just like churches today
[16:54] you know churches today have wine
[16:56] tasting parties did you know that
[16:58] there's churches that they go have wine
[17:00] tasting now they don't do it at the
[17:01] church
[17:02] now i know your church the church you
[17:03] used to go to has beer in the
[17:05] in the basement remember that he went
[17:07] and visited a couple years ago they're
[17:08] drinking beer in the basement
[17:10] now if that isn't isaiah 28 i don't know
[17:12] what it is
[17:14] spewed on the mouth of god aren't you
[17:16] glad you don't go there anymore brother
[17:18] praise god oh man may god be merciful to
[17:21] them because they're
[17:22] uh they're polluting the very holiness
[17:24] of god amen
[17:26] aren't you glad god he he come fly by as
[17:29] an eagle and said come out of her
[17:31] brother amen
[17:32] come out of her my people be not a
[17:34] partaker of her sins and her pledge
[17:36] and like an eagle you heard your mama
[17:38] eagle and you flew up
[17:39] and you met with mama eagle and you
[17:41] followed mama eagle home
[17:45] glory so glad he called me out of that
[17:49] uh that vomit-filled church
[17:54] see there they got pride they think they
[17:56] know it all see church we gotta humble
[17:57] ourselves
[17:58] they always say lord i can learn more i
[18:00] want to learn more i'm thirsty for more
[18:02] i'm hungry for more of you
[18:05] now look they're preaching now look at
[18:07] verse 7 says
[18:09] he's speaking to the priests they've
[18:11] earned through strong wine the priest
[18:13] and prophet
[18:14] have earned now who are the priests and
[18:15] prophets they're the mouthpieces in this
[18:17] beautiful
[18:19] they are the mouthpieces of israel but
[18:21] they're the ones that are prideful
[18:23] and drunken on natural drink in other
[18:26] words the preachers are backslid
[18:28] so the people they're going to leave the
[18:29] people backslidden i'm so glad to tell
[18:31] you i'm not backslid today amen
[18:33] i came in here i had a good prayer
[18:35] brother mj we had a good prayer before
[18:36] church
[18:37] on fire crying out crying to god
[18:39] pleading for souls
[18:41] leading for spiritual blessings amen
[18:43] that's what we need today we have all
[18:44] the natural blessings
[18:45] we need spiritual blessings amen we need
[18:48] spiritual help today
[18:50] we need spiritual benefits we need
[18:52] spiritual blessings we need the holy
[18:54] ghost today amen
[18:57] we have all the food all the clothes and
[18:58] all the cars we can what we have
[19:00] all these things what we need is
[19:02] holiness amen
[19:06] hallelujah we need a holy desire amen
[19:10] a burden a leaning a word we need
[19:13] something from the holy ghost amen
[19:16] we've got enough natural things to last
[19:17] us for a long time
[19:19] right so who is perverted here
[19:24] the mouthpieces are the prophet and the
[19:25] priest
[19:27] see their worship is like the vomit look
[19:30] at verse eight
[19:31] for all the tables are full of vomit and
[19:33] filthiness so there's no
[19:35] place clean anywhere you go in the
[19:38] old testament tabernacle was unclean
[19:42] outer court inner court always of holies
[19:44] in god's sight it was just vomit
[19:46] everywhere
[19:48] how are you going to have any worship
[19:49] how is god ever going to come on the
[19:51] scene he's not going to come on the
[19:52] scene
[19:53] right in my two years of going to
[19:55] denominational churches
[19:56] i'm sorry i was 18 years in assemblies
[19:58] of god which i'm thankful for some of
[20:00] the people there
[20:00] but overall there's a lot of vomit
[20:02] hanging around
[20:04] just laying around people women dressing
[20:06] sexy men cussing
[20:08] one preach my one pastor when i was a
[20:10] boy he uh
[20:12] he called all the people's uh a cuss
[20:14] word
[20:15] right from the pulpit i mean what kind
[20:17] of what kind of manners is that what
[20:19] kind of church manners is that
[20:21] is that the spirit of god is that the
[20:22] spirit of the satan
[20:24] look at that you know that this is look
[20:27] at the condition of the churches
[20:29] we don't want a mess we don't want
[20:31] uncleanness
[20:32] we want holiness praise god we want god
[20:35] feeling free
[20:36] to visit our church where everything's
[20:38] cleaned out everything's in order
[20:40] everything's holy so the holy one can
[20:42] come
[20:45] but god can't come in a church like that
[20:49] and there's not just a little bit of
[20:51] vomit the bible said they're full now i
[20:52] don't want to get your minds going too
[20:53] far because that they'll probably get
[20:54] your stomach going but
[20:56] i'm saying you know it's full of
[20:57] uncleanness
[20:59] it's full of false doctrine like we said
[21:01] on wednesday
[21:02] that woman put the leaven in there and
[21:04] it was fully leavened
[21:06] see these so denominations get fully
[21:08] leavened their doctrine gets fully
[21:10] corrupted by sin
[21:12] and man-made ideas and man-made
[21:14] traditions till the whole thing
[21:16] is a bunch of trash right brother bang
[21:19] we can take that cma
[21:20] uh bylaws and we can just throw it in
[21:22] the trash because it's all infiltrated
[21:23] with sin
[21:25] right just like my assemblies of god you
[21:27] can take their their bylaws
[21:29] and just toss them in the trash well i'm
[21:31] glad to say our bylaws never change amen
[21:34] our by law is written up and printed up
[21:36] king james version praise god
[21:38] hallelujah it's the law of the holy
[21:40] spirit
[21:42] thank god but we see we're raising those
[21:45] things and we
[21:46] we can see the effects of sin and it
[21:49] causes a spiritual sick condition
[21:51] where the people know it's unclean but
[21:53] they do nothing about it
[21:54] church if we ever get unclean may god
[21:56] help us to repent and do something about
[21:58] it
[21:59] amen every no church is perfect right
[22:01] real peter fell short of the glory of
[22:03] god
[22:04] we're going to make mistakes at some
[22:05] point but the thing to do is clean up
[22:07] the mess
[22:09] clean up go to cleaning this is a
[22:11] cleaning out service maybe you don't
[22:13] understand you got to have a cleaning
[22:15] out service get all the trash out
[22:17] so that the holy one can come back in
[22:20] because he said i will not speak through
[22:23] a group
[22:24] where it's full of vomit where the
[22:25] tables are unclean whereas a spiritual
[22:27] dirty church
[22:28] a prideful church i will not speak in
[22:32] hallelujah that's verse 8
[22:36] and this foretold pharisees because look
[22:38] at verse 11
[22:40] verse 11 is the word for the day of
[22:42] pentecost
[22:44] for with stammering lips and another
[22:46] tongue will he speak to this people
[22:49] this was prophetic so these same
[22:52] conditions were going to be at the time
[22:54] of jesus
[22:54] when the holy ghost fell right and the
[22:57] pharisees would again
[22:58] turn it off that's why jesus looked at
[23:00] him and said you are twofold the child
[23:03] of hell
[23:03] i'm sorry you make your converse twofold
[23:05] the children of hell than you are
[23:08] he says you have the keys to the kingdom
[23:10] but you shut up yourself from going in
[23:12] and you keep others from going in as
[23:14] well therefore
[23:15] the greater condemnation is to you
[23:19] right he said it'll be more tolerable on
[23:21] the day of judgment for sodom and
[23:23] gomorrah
[23:24] a bunch of sodomite gang bangers it'll
[23:27] be more tolerable on the day of judgment
[23:29] for those
[23:30] immoral wicked people than it is for the
[23:32] pharisees and sadducees
[23:33] because they could have been the
[23:34] mouthpiece of god but instead they
[23:36] perverted the house of god
[23:38] they made waste the house of god they
[23:40] ruined the house of god
[23:41] but we're not ruiners amen we're
[23:43] cleaners amen
[23:45] we're those that build up the house of
[23:46] god we're those that are faithful to the
[23:48] word of god
[23:49] we're ushering in people into the
[23:51] presence of god
[23:53] they're keeping people out of the
[23:54] friends of god but we're saying come on
[23:56] in come on into christ come on into the
[23:59] word come on into revelation
[24:01] come on into the holy ghost and power
[24:04] amen i know it's small no it's humble
[24:06] god's church has always been that way
[24:07] praise god
[24:09] but see we've got to look beyond god
[24:11] does that to hide it from the eyes of
[24:12] the wise and prudent then reveal it to
[24:14] babe such as we learn
[24:17] hallelujah go to first corinthians 14
[24:20] 21 i'm going to prove it to you many
[24:23] people don't understand this scripture
[24:24] but it's a beautiful scripture
[24:28] god hath those saints speak in
[24:31] stammering lips now
[24:33] gives us an example of it he says
[24:38] they were so on fire with the holy ghost
[24:41] that they were stammering
[24:42] and that was a sign to these pharisees
[24:44] to repent
[24:45] but they hardened their hearts if they
[24:48] would have received it they would
[24:49] they would they would have done like
[24:50] everybody else they would have got
[24:52] baptized and they would have sent
[24:53] apostles and feet as they teach you the
[24:55] word of god
[24:56] let's have let's have bible study teach
[24:58] me the word we'll continue in fellowship
[25:00] and doctrine
[25:01] and breaking of bread and prayers that's
[25:03] what a real child of god does
[25:05] he comes to god and says feed me train
[25:07] me build me up i want to be a part of
[25:09] the kingdom of god
[25:11] but the pharisees stood there in their
[25:12] pride with their crown of pride on
[25:14] and their spiritual drunkenness and
[25:17] refuse those speakers and tongues
[25:20] we say let them in praise god hallelujah
[25:23] let the freedom of the holy ghost in
[25:25] here let the power of the holy ghost
[25:27] let the life of god in here amen we
[25:30] welcome it praise god
[25:32] first corinthians 14 21
[25:38] but the battle is very few will be that
[25:40] find it
[25:41] right we're at the end time we're at the
[25:44] feast of weeks
[25:45] the gathering of the last few grains
[25:47] right the last few sheaves
[25:49] we're gleaning first corinthians 14 21.
[25:53] in the law it's written with men of
[25:55] other tongues
[25:56] and other lips while i speak of these
[25:58] people yet for all that they will not
[26:00] hear me sayeth the lord
[26:03] god sent peter paul mary
[26:06] mary other wonderful works of god oh no
[26:09] thank you jesus
[26:12] hallelujah jesus as a sign to those
[26:15] prideful
[26:15] devils and they said no fanaticism
[26:20] fanaticism and and god was pouring out
[26:23] this blessing
[26:24] and god said for all that all that 120
[26:27] they won't receive it
[26:30] so because of that they're full of vomit
[26:32] uh their tables are unclean i don't care
[26:34] how clean they were
[26:35] i don't care how much ties they gave
[26:37] they were children of satan
[26:39] because they strained that in that and
[26:40] swallowed a camel
[26:43] right that's exactly right
[26:46] that's why many churches are legalistic
[26:47] like that same thing message pharisee
[26:50] if they don't have the holy ghost if
[26:52] they've if they've introduced all false
[26:54] doctrines
[26:55] many false doctrines in there with with
[26:57] less of the flesh and lust of the eyes
[26:58] and the pride of life
[27:00] pride in messenger churches we're better
[27:02] than other people see when pride goes in
[27:04] there what happens it's a place
[27:06] of vomit i don't care what name's on the
[27:08] door it don't matter what name's on the
[27:10] door
[27:10] it matters what name's on the soul
[27:13] is the name of the lord jesus christ on
[27:15] that soul has he marked that soul or not
[27:18] if he's marked that all you're god's
[27:23] then you'll live like he wants you to
[27:24] live hallelujah
[27:28] amen so we see the same condition at the
[27:32] end of the church age
[27:33] and the beginning of it basically the
[27:35] end of the old testament age
[27:38] vomit-filled churches not being cleaned
[27:40] up
[27:41] so god said i won't i won't and it was
[27:43] god's vomit right that was god
[27:44] jesus spewed them out of their mouth god
[27:47] was sick with them
[27:48] god tried it but he was sick with their
[27:50] decisions
[27:51] oh may god may we may we be obedient to
[27:54] christ church
[27:55] may we be humble so god so we remain in
[27:58] the body of christ
[28:00] right
[28:04] now i want to just give you a few
[28:06] visuals i think it'll help you out
[28:08] so there's three conditions right one
[28:11] speaks for god the other is rejected and
[28:13] this
[28:13] the code has no connection to god none
[28:15] at all
[28:17] but see can't you see how which one we
[28:18] are to me it's so plain
[28:21] i'm speaking for jesus today i got the
[28:23] same baptism as peter
[28:25] we've got some of the same miracles as
[28:26] them praise god i mean
[28:28] hallelujah we're not perfect you know
[28:29] but but only christ is
[28:31] but we're we're striving to be perfect
[28:34] amen
[28:34] we're pressing on with all that we have
[28:37] we're pressing with all the effort
[28:39] we're searching our salvation with fear
[28:41] and trembling amen
[28:43] hallelujah not playing games in church
[28:46] we're here with fear and trembling
[28:47] we're pressing on we're forgetting those
[28:49] things in the past and pressing on for
[28:51] the high calling in christ jesus
[28:54] amen we're speaking for god
[29:00] i'm not speaking for denomination i'm
[29:03] not speaking for a woman or man i'm
[29:04] speaking for jesus praise god
[29:06] i'm letting him preach today by the
[29:09] grace of god amen
[29:10] i'm doing everything i can to let him
[29:12] preach today yielding to the holy spirit
[29:17] now church this should remind us of the
[29:18] three kinds of believers
[29:20] which is true in brother branham's
[29:23] context
[29:24] but remember the church ages and other
[29:26] sermons brotherhood spoke of the
[29:27] another class of believers so four and
[29:30] then he says there was four crosses when
[29:32] jesus died
[29:34] all right there was jesus the same thief
[29:36] the lost thief and judas hung himself on
[29:38] a tree
[29:39] four people died that night so now we
[29:42] have the number four
[29:43] so see it has to fit inside here now
[29:46] here's where brother adam says it's
[29:47] phase 279
[29:48] he says the word bride is the first
[29:50] group the second group
[29:51] is the foolish virgin of matthew 25.
[29:55] so this is the church age book you have
[29:57] the first group bride
[29:59] second group bush version third group
[30:02] are the borderline christians
[30:03] like judas where is his name judas
[30:07] so they come up real close but then they
[30:09] fall away from the holy ghost and
[30:11] they're lost right now people can come
[30:14] up close and be saved
[30:15] but judas sold out jesus and he betrayed
[30:18] jesus for money
[30:19] so we know he was lost right so the
[30:22] foolish virgin will come up to the
[30:24] promised land
[30:24] but not come in but they're still saved
[30:27] right
[30:28] but then judas came up and walked away
[30:30] and said i'm for selling this out
[30:32] i'd rather have the money okay so that's
[30:35] the third group
[30:36] judas is the third group the pretenders
[30:38] right the make believers
[30:40] so foolish virgins are believers but
[30:42] they're foolish to the holy ghost
[30:45] and the last group are those that have
[30:47] never been on the books of life
[30:50] so judas's name was on there because he
[30:52] had faith in christ
[30:54] but jesus said he blotted out
[30:57] so yes people can lose their salvation
[31:00] once saved always saved
[31:02] isn't always true it's not true because
[31:04] judas was saved he had a confession
[31:06] his name was on the book but then jesus
[31:08] said i'll blot it out
[31:11] the real saying is once sealed always
[31:13] sealed
[31:15] that's the real saying see they got it
[31:17] confused
[31:18] once you're sealed with the holy ghost
[31:20] that seal lasts not to the next revival
[31:22] not to next week but it's to the day of
[31:24] your redemption amen
[31:26] today we meet christ in the air amen
[31:29] the seal lasts until the day i get a
[31:31] redeemed body praise god
[31:34] amen the fire inside the holy ghost and
[31:36] fire
[31:37] in our souls that hotness lasts unto the
[31:39] day of redemption
[31:43] that's what it was for they didn't have
[31:45] that in the old testament we had that
[31:46] today in the new testament that's what
[31:48] it's for
[31:50] so now now we got four groups so see now
[31:54] we still have three kinds of levers one
[31:56] two three but they're in four classes
[32:00] and brother ram taught both of them
[32:01] church so they got a fit right
[32:03] they have to fit so the heart speaks for
[32:06] god still
[32:07] they're saved and peter is the example
[32:10] once he got the holy ghost he's really
[32:11] hot
[32:13] the lukewarm they're rejected they don't
[32:14] speak for god like the saved
[32:16] they're saved it's like the same thief
[32:18] on the cross
[32:21] did the same people on the cross go
[32:22] preaching and winning souls do you speak
[32:24] for god with us say the lord no he just
[32:26] pleaded for mercy
[32:28] and god gave it to him the lukewarm they
[32:31] spurn god's mercy
[32:33] they're rejected from speaking from for
[32:35] god like then they're lost like judas
[32:37] iscariot
[32:39] or the pharisees right because they say
[32:42] i speak for god but they didn't
[32:44] god left them then you have the cold
[32:47] they have no connection to god they're
[32:48] lost
[32:49] that's like pilate he never had any
[32:51] connection to god
[32:52] right he's known as a heathen now does
[32:54] that help by god's grace you still have
[32:56] the three kinds like jesus said you have
[32:57] hot
[32:58] lukewarm cold but you have two kinds of
[33:00] lukewarm
[33:01] you got the lukewarm foolish virgins
[33:03] they never get the holy ghost
[33:05] they don't really speak for god right
[33:06] they're just trying to be saved like lot
[33:09] but then you have lukewarm that get
[33:11] close like judas and then sell it out
[33:14] now to me it's perfect to me that makes
[33:15] perfect sense to me that makes me
[33:17] appreciate my bible more
[33:18] that makes the bible more clear to me
[33:21] not less clear more clear
[33:23] because i'm being led into all truth
[33:26] that's one evidence i know i got the
[33:28] holy ghost the holy ghost will lead me
[33:30] into more truth
[33:32] in other words my questions get answered
[33:34] brother william
[33:36] hey amen if i got a bible question
[33:38] there's got to be a bible answer amen
[33:41] hallelujah because the holy ghost will
[33:43] direct us to the word amen
[33:49] now let's do some bible teaching here
[33:52] now i just put a few notes here's some
[33:53] notes lukewarm is only used one time
[33:57] the greek word for hot is only used
[33:59] those three times
[34:02] okay and we'll go to the definition of
[34:04] that so in other words when jesus spoke
[34:05] to laodicean church age he was using
[34:07] words
[34:08] that just weren't used by paul they
[34:10] weren't used by john
[34:12] okay they're just used by jesus because
[34:14] it's an end time condition
[34:16] now the definition of hot though gives
[34:18] us some clues
[34:19] we've got to be spiritual clues we've
[34:20] got these spiritual sleuths amen
[34:22] we've got to rightly divide the word of
[34:24] truth if you look at the definition of
[34:26] heart where jesus used it
[34:27] it gives clues to what kind of condition
[34:30] we should be in
[34:33] and it's all about this church it's all
[34:35] about having
[34:36] enthusiasm what did brother
[34:39] say never lose your well that means you
[34:42] can lose it right but then can you get
[34:44] it back
[34:45] yeah so jesus definition there deals
[34:48] with your enthusiasm
[34:49] your zeal your desire okay
[34:53] and then peter says stir up your minds
[34:56] which means bringing them to a boil
[34:58] he didn't say stir up your soul your
[35:00] soul's already stirred up
[35:02] you just gotta stop thinking like a
[35:04] human because i'm thinking about it like
[35:05] a christian
[35:07] right so the human spirit or mind is
[35:10] where you say your lukewarm
[35:11] now see if we ever if we ever said we're
[35:14] lukewarm that's what we're talking about
[35:15] the human's mind
[35:17] my mind is just thinking worldly
[35:19] thoughts right now which we're all
[35:20] guilty of
[35:22] but see i'm not even going to use that
[35:23] word ever i'm not going to use the word
[35:25] lukewarm
[35:26] i'm just going to use the word the bible
[35:27] word is weary i'm weary in my mind
[35:30] i've got a weary mind if jesus didn't
[35:33] use that lukewarm word for me i'm not
[35:34] using it for me
[35:36] now you can you can do whatever you want
[35:38] i mean you can however you want to do it
[35:40] but i'm not going to connect that word
[35:41] to me because it's nothing about me
[35:45] right there's nothing about me i don't
[35:48] preach here and then go off and get
[35:50] drunk and smoke tomorrow
[35:52] no i'm hot for jesus i'm hot for jesus
[35:55] on monday just like i am sunday hey
[35:58] man hallelujah praise god i stay hot for
[36:01] him on monday
[36:02] tuesday when you see me on wednesday i'm
[36:05] still hot for him
[36:06] you'll see me on thursday i'm still hot
[36:08] bang saw me yesterday i was hot for
[36:09] jesus
[36:10] so was he he was doing work for the
[36:11] church amen
[36:14] no i don't care what day you see me on i
[36:16] would be hot for jesus
[36:17] amen might be a little weary in my mind
[36:19] that's different
[36:22] i'm always hot for jesus
[36:25] see so that bible language doesn't
[36:29] belong to a holy ghost-filled christian
[36:31] now if someone's not born again then yes
[36:33] we would say yeah you might be lukewarm
[36:36] you gotta you gotta break out of that
[36:37] condition how do you break out of that
[36:40] heat it up right if you're lukewarm what
[36:43] do you just gotta add some heat
[36:45] how do you get hot you gotta get start
[36:46] praying you gotta get in the presence of
[36:48] god you gotta confess all your sin right
[36:50] get out all this clean out all the trash
[36:52] they can really heat it up praise god
[36:56] right if you were to start a fire you
[36:59] got to make you got to make a place for
[37:00] right you got to make got to get fresh
[37:02] wood on there you got to clean it up
[37:04] you got to clean up the situation right
[37:05] you got to organize the situation
[37:07] same thing here you want a fire you got
[37:09] to clean up your life amen
[37:11] you got to set your life in order if you
[37:13] set everything in order if you fast and
[37:14] pray
[37:15] clean out everything then you brother
[37:16] you sister you better believe
[37:18] the fire's coming how do i know because
[37:21] it fell on me
[37:22] and i was there when it happened amen i
[37:25] was there when it happened i ought to
[37:27] know praise god
[37:30] i ought to know because i went from not
[37:32] being on fire to burning with fire
[37:36] anyone that's born again could say the
[37:37] same
[37:39] there's a time you weren't burning
[37:41] there's a time i started burning
[37:43] and i was there when it happened i ought
[37:45] to know
[37:47] i didn't hear your church hallelujah
[37:50] now let's go through this now if you
[37:53] want to say it like this
[37:55] believers have all three conditions if
[37:58] you want to say it like that
[37:59] but again i'm not going to use the word
[38:01] lukewarm for me i'm just saying
[38:03] if you wanna if you wanna look at those
[38:04] three conditions you could say you have
[38:07] all three in your body soul spirit
[38:10] okay so look at this and your soul your
[38:12] heart because
[38:13] god's holy ghost is a fire baptism
[38:17] and the soul cannot sin brother william
[38:20] i don't care what you did all week
[38:22] your soul right in there it didn't sin
[38:24] all week
[38:26] no charges no condemnation
[38:34] the soul can never sin because god is a
[38:38] consuming fire
[38:39] god's fire has burned out the unbelief
[38:42] he's burned out the desire to live for
[38:44] the world
[38:44] or live for satan or live for the flesh
[38:47] the less of the flesh
[38:48] the only desire in there is god amen
[38:52] and i don't care how bad your week was
[38:54] if you're born again your soul
[38:55] never said jesus dropped the charges
[38:58] already amen
[39:00] hallelujah it can't sin
[39:03] if you sinned it was out here or out
[39:07] here
[39:08] but these two work really closely
[39:10] together unfortunately
[39:13] right so it's both of them are sitting
[39:17] so you might say you're lukewarm and
[39:19] you're thinking but i'm not going to use
[39:21] that word i could
[39:22] but i'm not going to use that word i'm
[39:22] using the word weary because that's what
[39:24] the bible says hebrews 12 3 says
[39:26] you're weird now look at this that greek
[39:28] word brother means sick
[39:31] paul says you're weary and faint in your
[39:33] mind so that that sick kind of relates
[39:34] to lukewarm
[39:36] right so i could see how somebody could
[39:38] say well i'm lukewarm in my mind well
[39:40] that's fine
[39:41] say whatever you want to say but i'm
[39:43] saying do not let the devil beat you
[39:45] down
[39:46] if you know you're born again don't ever
[39:48] let the devil tell you or not
[39:51] and don't let him ever tell you it's not
[39:53] for you jesus said if any man hunger
[39:56] and then the spirit and the bride say
[39:58] whosoever will praise god
[40:01] it's for everybody praise god in other
[40:03] words anybody who wants the holy ghost
[40:05] can have it praise god
[40:07] don't let the devil tell you it's not
[40:08] for you it is for me
[40:10] i am a man i am a woman and jesus said
[40:13] any man any woman
[40:17] i never let him tell me i'm lukewarm i
[40:19] am not
[40:20] a lukewarm denominational christian i
[40:22] used to be
[40:24] i used to be but i'm not what i once was
[40:27] praise god
[40:28] i'm not what i want to be but thank god
[40:29] i'm not what i used to be praise god
[40:32] i know i'm not one of those
[40:33] denominational cold-hearted uh
[40:36] vomit-filled church members i know i'm
[40:39] not
[40:39] i got the life of god in me i got the
[40:42] life of jesus in me
[40:44] i just tell my testimony brother amen on
[40:47] on youtube and people start having
[40:48] babies
[40:50] amen we just started talking about jesus
[40:53] and people get their prayers answered
[40:54] amen
[40:56] we've got the life of god in us amen we
[40:59] got the words of life church
[41:01] god help us just to speak the word amen
[41:04] there's life in the power of the tongue
[41:08] to share testimony watch what it does
[41:16] like i shared bang testimony and who is
[41:18] about their dad my brother craig said
[41:19] wow i'm so blessed it was on
[41:21] email he said wow what that brother has
[41:23] such great faith you know
[41:26] it's like people and he's in connecticut
[41:27] now he's two years been a pastor
[41:28] connecticut
[41:29] and he's like wow you guys are you said
[41:31] 15 years you've already been in church
[41:32] he's like that seems impossible i said
[41:34] exactly right but it's just like the
[41:36] bible the bible said they would hear of
[41:37] the faith of the romans
[41:39] or they'd heard of the faith of the
[41:41] corinthians right
[41:42] and it blessed paul he said i've heard
[41:45] of the faith of the
[41:46] festival and the thessalonicans right
[41:48] and so the saints in connecticut
[41:50] are hearing about the faith of the akron
[41:52] saints
[41:53] amen praise god oh it's bible days today
[41:57] praise god now see
[42:01] your mind can be lukewarm if you want to
[42:02] call it that that's fine
[42:04] i'm just not going to use that lyric
[42:06] that vocabulary with my life
[42:08] i used to be lukewarm i know what it is
[42:11] i just get sick minded sometimes or i
[42:13] get tired in my mind
[42:16] and i need transform
[42:21] paul said he hated the things he did he
[42:23] was wretched which means he's an
[42:24] afflicted man
[42:25] see church we're all victorious in our
[42:27] souls but everywhere else we're
[42:28] afflicted we're afflicted with that sin
[42:30] nature
[42:33] right it's an affliction right it's just
[42:35] a it's a sick it's a sin disease that
[42:38] lives inside of our bodies
[42:39] but god knew you would overcome it so he
[42:42] sent you a fire to overcome it
[42:45] amen he sent you fire
[42:48] to burn up those desires when they rise
[42:51] from time to time don't they
[42:53] oh yeah my desires rise up from time to
[42:56] time too
[42:56] what does it take a good old bonfire
[42:58] praise god
[42:59] it takes a good hold on fire throw some
[43:02] dead
[43:02] confessions in there get rid of
[43:04] everything dead burn it up and let the
[43:07] fire grow
[43:08] praise god and that fire catches the
[43:10] same fire as a soul and then once i got
[43:12] these two on fire
[43:13] this guy's gonna come into obedience to
[43:15] it
[43:20] paul said the carnal mind is hatred or
[43:22] enmity against god
[43:24] that's what i was saying i wake up and i
[43:26] don't even feel like reading my bible
[43:28] the thoughts are like you're too tired
[43:29] go back to bed that's hatred against
[43:32] god's word
[43:33] but yeah i love the bible why would it
[43:35] do that because i got
[43:36] a i got a a sick mind
[43:40] i've got i got a mind that needs
[43:41] transformed i got a problem in my mind
[43:44] i've got
[43:44] hatred in my mind so i've got to fight
[43:47] against that
[43:49] the soul's got to make a decision say no
[43:51] no you're not winning today
[43:53] you hateful mind got it god's spirit
[43:57] defies you
[43:58] right every day we got to have that
[44:00] battle we're going to
[44:01] see god or not right i don't feel like
[44:04] it so you got to have the battle you got
[44:05] to get that sword out
[44:10] the devil says you don't need to read
[44:11] your bible but i
[44:13] say man does not live by bread alone but
[44:15] by
[44:16] every word that proceeds out of the
[44:18] mouth of god
[44:18] [Applause]
[44:20] i don't need my breakfast first i need
[44:22] my bible first amen
[44:25] i've got to choose to pull that sword
[44:26] out and fight
[44:28] with that double-edged sword oh you know
[44:30] the devil's afraid of that thing amen
[44:32] oh it's gonna cut it up it's sharp it's
[44:34] so effective it'll cause him to flee
[44:37] he'll run you just start waving that
[44:39] church and you'll get the victory but
[44:40] we've got to be willing to fight
[44:44] that's where we see people get fallen
[44:46] away luke and luke warm right if they're
[44:47] not born again
[44:48] it's because they're not willing to
[44:49] fight but paul says i fought
[44:53] a good fight i love what he says there
[44:55] he says i have
[44:56] finished the course i have accomplished
[45:01] everything god has called me to do ah
[45:03] now we sound like joshua
[45:05] he possessed all the land that god gave
[45:07] him now he sounded like caleb
[45:10] caleb was a man the bible said he
[45:12] followed god with his whole heart
[45:14] he didn't leave part of his heart with
[45:15] the world like you know david did part
[45:17] of his heart with the
[45:18] with the bathsheba and uriah you know no
[45:21] no
[45:22] no caleb followed the lord with his
[45:24] whole heart
[45:25] and that's how he's known now as a
[45:27] wholehearted follower of christ i don't
[45:28] want to be a caleb
[45:31] i want to follow god with all my heart
[45:35] paul says i have fought the fight i
[45:37] finished my course in other words
[45:39] all that god called me to do all those
[45:41] that god sent me to i finished it
[45:44] i completed it that's my other message
[45:46] for tonight
[45:48] so now what's in your body your body's
[45:51] always cold unless it gets a sharp
[45:52] anointing of the holy ghost
[45:54] paul says it's the body of death
[45:59] body of death right because we know we
[46:02] die
[46:02] slowly right we're dying slowly but it's
[46:05] also it's
[46:06] death to the spirit of god it doesn't
[46:08] want the spirit of god to reign over it
[46:12] let me just tell a quick testimony my
[46:14] doctor told me this we got my physical
[46:15] this week
[46:16] he told me out of all the 40 year old
[46:17] men i see he said you're the healthiest
[46:19] one one of the healthiest of all
[46:21] i said that's from preaching doctor
[46:24] right because my body don't want to obey
[46:26] but i get up here i start sweating
[46:29] i start exercising it don't look like it
[46:31] but i'm actually exercising your
[46:32] punching and everything like that
[46:34] walking around here we're walking around
[46:36] we're looking all around
[46:37] we're turning all around we're keeping
[46:39] our bodies alive
[46:40] for the word of god i thought that was a
[46:42] good testimony my body is the body of
[46:44] death but i'm pumping in as much life as
[46:46] i can to it
[46:47] and even the doctors got to witness that
[46:50] he said you got some good blood work
[46:52] for a 40 year old man i said thank the
[46:54] lord jesus keeping me healthy
[46:58] i thank god for his mercy and his grace
[47:04] i got a little my cholesterol is a
[47:06] little high so i gotta eat more salads
[47:09] that's one thing i gotta do i gotta eat
[47:10] more salads this year
[47:13] now look at this quote bro church look
[47:15] at this quote from brother brown 57.
[47:17] listen brother you're not you're never
[47:19] saved by any sign
[47:22] you're never saved by any sensation now
[47:24] god might have given you a sensation
[47:26] to show you what he was doing in your
[47:28] soul
[47:30] but the sensation itself the crying the
[47:32] tongues the shouting whatever
[47:34] that didn't save you itself that was
[47:35] just a reaction to what happened in your
[47:37] soul
[47:40] god's spirit dropped down from heaven it
[47:43] got poured out
[47:44] and it ignited your soul amen it lit it
[47:48] on fire
[47:48] and because of the fire you started
[47:50] shouting or crying or jumping or
[47:52] like that or speaking in tongues because
[47:54] the fire is what started it
[47:57] amen the sensation didn't save you
[48:01] the sensation happened because of the
[48:03] fire amen
[48:05] the fire that saved you
[48:09] hallelujah
[48:14] you are saved when you meet god's
[48:15] condition of his word and nothing
[48:17] else
[48:21] that's right god's word has way you're
[48:23] not sick because you
[48:24] feel like you're saved like i said as i
[48:27] get older i don't even feel safe when i
[48:28] wake up in the morning
[48:30] right i don't even feel like it and
[48:31] brother graham said the same thing
[48:34] i'm not saying because i feel like i'm
[48:36] safe because a lot of times i
[48:38] don't feel sometimes
[48:42] just on mondays i don't feel safe
[48:43] because i'm tired no a lot of the times
[48:46] i don't even feel saved oh church
[48:49] god is teaching us to live from the soul
[48:53] we have to stop living from the flesh
[48:56] we need constant reminders we need
[48:58] constant reminders don't live from the
[49:00] flesh
[49:00] don't don't don't focus on what you feel
[49:03] focus on the word of god
[49:06] don't think about what you feel we all
[49:07] feel bad things right we all feel things
[49:09] that we shouldn't feel
[49:10] don't trust your feelings trust the word
[49:15] i'm not saying because god gave he says
[49:17] but i'm saved
[49:18] because god gave the promise
[49:22] i met god's conditions and upon god's
[49:24] holy word i can defeat say
[49:26] take it seven days a week
[49:31] because it's god's word so
[49:35] seven mornings i defeat him and seven
[49:37] nights i defeat him praise god
[49:40] amen by the promise of god
[49:45] he that hears my word believes on him
[49:46] that sent me half everlasting life and
[49:48] shall not
[49:49] come into the condemnation but pass from
[49:52] death
[49:53] unto life that's what the king of kings
[49:57] said what do you believe
[49:59] who are you going to believe your
[50:00] feelings your body that gets sick and
[50:01] lets you down all the time
[50:03] are you going to believe your lying mind
[50:05] when you think evil thoughts are you
[50:06] you want to you want to do what are you
[50:07] going to believe your line mind or your
[50:09] lying body
[50:10] will believe neither of them and we
[50:12] won't believe satan either because he's
[50:14] the one that gave us those evil thoughts
[50:16] so satan take your lies back to hell
[50:18] with you we're not trusting in our
[50:20] feelings
[50:20] we're not trusting in anything other
[50:22] than the promise of god
[50:24] and how god backed up his promise amen
[50:27] he backed it up by living inside of me
[50:30] amen hallelujah
[50:36] but amen i don't feel safe a lot of the
[50:38] times right
[50:40] but i feel born again i feel born again
[50:43] in my soul
[50:44] praise god because my body gets tired
[50:47] the body of death
[50:48] my mind is tempted to think about you
[50:50] know worry about finances or
[50:52] or worry about uh problems you know or
[50:55] worry about the future especially the
[50:56] future right
[50:57] i've always been a warrior you know but
[51:00] god's given me great victories over the
[51:01] years
[51:02] but before i got married did kristen i
[51:03] always tell her i i didn't want to ruin
[51:05] her life
[51:07] before we get before i proposed to her
[51:08] brother bang i didn't want to ruin her
[51:09] life so i'd sit up
[51:11] in my uh room at akron and i would just
[51:14] i would just sit there and just stare at
[51:15] the ceiling for hours i wouldn't go to
[51:16] bed
[51:17] i tried to go to bed like midnight
[51:18] wouldn't go to bed to like three in the
[51:19] morning
[51:20] should i marry her or not i want to ruin
[51:23] her life what's your idea i'm such a
[51:24] warrior
[51:27] and after i heard brother abraham say
[51:28] this he said he said only marry her if
[51:31] you can't live with god
[51:33] after i heard brother ram say that i
[51:34] said it's finished no more worried
[51:37] i don't want to live my life without her
[51:40] i don't want to be alone
[51:42] and she's so much that i wish i was
[51:44] praise god
[51:46] and once that came all the worry left
[51:48] praise god
[51:49] but i've got to make sure satan don't
[51:51] bring that feeling back inside me worry
[51:53] about the church
[51:54] worry about my job worry about covered
[51:56] shots am i going to lose my job because
[51:58] i don't get the covenant shot
[52:00] i've already been inoculated from heaven
[52:01] why do they want me to get why they want
[52:03] me to get another inoculation i've
[52:04] already got a shot from heaven praise
[52:06] god all right
[52:07] and i've already had coleman too why
[52:09] don't i need another shot i mean
[52:11] i've already had enough praise god i got
[52:13] enough of what they want to give me
[52:14] but see i can worry about that but i've
[52:16] gotta cast down
[52:19] i gotta go back to the fire and warm
[52:24] the holy ghost amen and warm up my
[52:26] thoughts and stir up my
[52:27] thoughts by way of remembrance
[52:33] so the king of kings says you're saved
[52:34] by the promise so what do you say by
[52:36] feelings of
[52:37] promise trust the promise don't trust
[52:40] your feelings

[53:11] rest your soul on jesus church
[53:15] don't trust your feelings you can't do
[53:16] it you must believe the word or the
[53:18] revelation in your soul
[53:20] and then say god stir up my mind today
[53:24] if you can't do it if you're not if you
[53:27] don't have the strength to do it say god
[53:28] stir me up today he will
[53:29] oh yeah like for me sometimes he'll just
[53:33] bring opposition if i'm tired and weary
[53:35] i'll bring an email where someone's
[53:36] really mean to me and that will stir me
[53:37] right up by the way
[53:40] or a youtube comment or something like
[53:42] that i'm like
[53:43] you want to fight me devil okay that's
[53:45] fine now i'm awake
[53:48] right or sometimes i'll get like a
[53:51] testimony i can put on a song and
[53:52] that'll stir me right up
[53:53] that's right praise god he's my portion
[53:56] amen jesus my portion
[53:57] i've been touched by a fire so let the
[53:59] world come and watch me burn amen
[54:02] so many times adversity stirs me up
[54:06] but church we're also commanded by the
[54:08] bible to stir ourselves up by
[54:11] remembrance
[54:14] so see church for you and i if we are
[54:16] born again if we have god's fire right
[54:18] in here in the soul
[54:19] then our goal is to have both the soul
[54:22] and the human spirit hot
[54:25] that's what we find from the scriptures
[54:27] it's our job to keep the mind hot
[54:36] now here's what jesus says you must be
[54:39] lukewarm cold or
[54:40] he said i wish you were zestus i wish
[54:41] you were hot he said i want everybody to
[54:43] be hot right
[54:44] he says better be lukewarm then coal i'm
[54:46] sorry it's very
[54:47] cold and lukewarm lukewarm is the
[54:49] awfulest condition you can be
[54:50] right the pharisees judas awfulest
[54:53] condition you can be in
[54:54] but here's hot hot is that stones
[54:57] jesus said i want you to be zestos in
[55:00] laodicea
[55:01] what's that mean boiling boiling hot
[55:06] fervor of mind and zeal
[55:10] so you're zealous right you've got a
[55:12] desire
[55:13] you have a fervent you have a burning
[55:15] desire
[55:16] that's what jesus said i need people
[55:18] with desire praise god
[55:21] now we know the soul is always going to
[55:23] have that but we
[55:25] need to get our minds to be that way all
[55:27] the time
[55:31] and that's what the bible says when they
[55:33] were all filled with the holy ghost
[55:34] in that prayer meeting they spoke the
[55:36] word of god with
[55:38] zestos hot
[55:42] their minds not only were their souls
[55:44] hot their minds were
[55:46] i've seen it at my live church too one
[55:48] time i preached on hell a few years ago
[55:50] i preached on hell
[55:51] and i was so hot the next monday i was
[55:54] so hot
[55:54] even after school i was at the gas
[55:56] station it was like 4 30
[55:58] i was pumping gas i was so hot for for
[56:00] jesus by the way
[56:01] i there's a guy across the the pumps
[56:03] there i said sir
[56:04] are you a christian are you going to
[56:07] heaven this is
[56:07] just a couple years ago he said yeah
[56:10] yeah yeah
[56:11] i'm saved i said well here's my card
[56:14] here's my card if you need to know if
[56:15] you know and it was like 2018 or
[56:16] something
[56:17] if you need anything you let me know sir
[56:19] i was so burning with him going to hell
[56:21] i didn't want to see him lost
[56:22] i did that for the next person that like
[56:24] couple days in a row
[56:26] now i want to be that way more often
[56:28] right but sometimes brother
[56:30] my my mind is on the book right it's
[56:32] been on the book
[56:33] so see my mind's not really on
[56:34] witnessing as much
[56:36] but remember the bible said there's a
[56:37] time and season for everything
[56:40] that's how i tell mother amen before
[56:42] church brother bam wrote that book in
[56:43] 65. guess what i didn't read it till
[56:45] 2002
[56:47] 37 years later i just sat there
[56:51] that book brother must have sat at voice
[56:52] of god for all those years well maybe
[56:54] some of those maybe like 10 years or
[56:55] something
[56:56] then all of a sudden jesse smith put an
[56:58] order in church
[57:01] and 37 years after i'm reading it like
[57:04] this was fresh off the printer
[57:06] this is fresh from the mind of god right
[57:09] and it stirred up my mind and see that
[57:12] that's what communion with god
[57:14] is it boils your mind like wow i i never
[57:17] had this before i never knew this before
[57:18] look this is alive this is powerful let
[57:21] me be born
[57:24] with this truth boils you up
[57:28] it's always boiling something's bubbling
[57:30] right there's life there's
[57:32] movement always moved by the holy spirit
[57:36] see there was a time for that book to
[57:37] really impact my life
[57:47] then paul says one of his last letters
[57:50] pray for me
[57:51] that i may open my mouth boldly here's a
[57:53] man if anybody had the fire of god it
[57:55] was just man
[57:56] because the fire met him on the road to
[57:58] damascus
[58:00] hallelujah and he said pray for me that
[58:02] i'll be able to speak
[58:04] holy zestos
[58:07] hot pray for me that i can speak it
[58:11] on fire seek what the mystery
[58:15] the mysteries of god right
[58:19] that i may speak boldly as i so in other
[58:21] words this message this bible
[58:23] is meant to be spoken boldly amen praise
[58:26] god amen
[58:27] it's meant to be spoken with power
[58:29] authority and courage
[58:31] and strength and confidence
[58:36] if you look up fervor though that was a
[58:38] greek word
[58:40] intense some other uh
[58:43] synonyms passionate intensity zeal
[58:48] emotion warmth sincerity earnestness i'm
[58:51] eager eagerness
[58:54] see if we're hot we're going to be eager
[58:56] about the things of god

[59:01] i'm eager to read my bible now i'm eager
[59:05] to pray now
[59:06] i'm eager to witness now i've got
[59:08] passion to do it
[59:09] because my mind is filled with god's
[59:11] boldness the fire of god has reached out
[59:13] into my mind
[59:14] and i'm going to speak the word with
[59:16] boldness
[59:18] oh that's that we could use that bride
[59:19] of christ stuff i don't have to ask i'm
[59:21] gonna take anybody's hands

[59:47] i mean we either got to be bold for the
[59:49] word of god or we'll be
[59:51] sick right

[1:02:53] amen and then there's lydia and malachi
[1:02:56] right there
[1:02:58] that's just a joke
[1:03:02] i always want to think about the things
[1:03:03] of god you know
[1:03:06] paul said follow after charity see if
[1:03:07] you've got to follow after the fire
[1:03:10] and desire spiritual gifts
[1:03:13] to keep your mind saying god send us
[1:03:15] gifts send us gifts
[1:03:16] i got the fire i want to see more fire
[1:03:19] but rather that you may prophecy god
[1:03:20] give us a prophecy
[1:03:22] for tell us what's going to happen
[1:03:28] wherefore brethren covet same thing
[1:03:30] desire desire prophesy
[1:03:32] prophecy and forbid not to speak or tell
[1:03:34] you
[1:03:37] but i'm jealous that's the same word
[1:03:38] that hot boiling i'm boiling over you
[1:03:41] with godly jealousy
[1:03:44] for i've espoused you to one husband in
[1:03:45] other words i don't want them to
[1:03:47] be become uh flirters with the world i
[1:03:49] don't want them to make love with the
[1:03:50] world
[1:03:51] i've got a real burden for the church of
[1:03:52] god
[1:03:54] that's what paul's saying i'm boiling
[1:03:56] for the church of god
[1:03:58] galatians says it is good to be boiling
[1:04:02] always in a good thing
[1:04:05] see church that's why brother ann would
[1:04:06] say if you if you start an orphanage he
[1:04:09] said that's a great thing to do
[1:04:11] because you're boiling with helping the
[1:04:12] poor children
[1:04:14] and the bible said pure religion visits
[1:04:17] the fatherless
[1:04:19] see so always always be zealous for some
[1:04:22] good things
[1:04:23] that's why church i used to i wasn't
[1:04:25] always zealous for book writing but now
[1:04:26] i'm really zealous for it because i
[1:04:28] think this will be a good thing
[1:04:30] i think it's going to show people that
[1:04:31] the message is backed up by the bible
[1:04:33] that's what the message is the bible
[1:04:35] right it's the revelation of the bible
[1:04:39] see we must be always boiling for some
[1:04:42] good thing
[1:04:43] for music for about amen right he he
[1:04:46] just got he's gotta be faithful right
[1:04:47] you gotta
[1:04:48] you gotta always make me boil for more
[1:04:51] music
[1:04:52] and he may have other gifts than that
[1:04:54] right but we could see that or like i
[1:04:55] was talking to his brother um
[1:04:57] i don't think he'll mind how many know
[1:04:59] brother mike mccloskey i talked to him
[1:05:00] two days ago on the phone
[1:05:01] he's in a wheelchair right and god still
[1:05:03] hasn't healed him from his paralyzed
[1:05:05] state because he got shot right in the
[1:05:06] middle of the back
[1:05:07] right there but he said this on the
[1:05:11] phone we're talking he's like
[1:05:12] brother jesse he said i just want to
[1:05:13] find my gifts in the body of christ i'm
[1:05:15] like brother
[1:05:16] that has been the desire of my heart for
[1:05:18] my church for like ever
[1:05:21] and i said brother tell me some of these
[1:05:22] testimonies he was in lowe's
[1:05:25] lows where you buy home decorations you
[1:05:29] buy uh tools
[1:05:30] right loads you know what loses like a
[1:05:32] home depot it's like a
[1:05:33] whole maintenance store right he was in
[1:05:37] lowe's there's a woman
[1:05:38] who had what was her problem
[1:05:42] i think it was like some type of a
[1:05:44] disease
[1:05:45] like some type of disease like in her
[1:05:47] back or something like that
[1:05:48] this brother's in a wheelchair he
[1:05:50] believes the message right so he he goes
[1:05:52] up and they're just talking
[1:05:53] and she said oh i've got this i got this
[1:05:55] i don't know if there's like a
[1:05:56] cyst or something and he said can i pray
[1:05:59] for you
[1:06:01] now this is a man that he asked god to
[1:06:03] heal him and let him walk but god won't
[1:06:05] answer his prayer
[1:06:06] he said can i pray for your cysts on
[1:06:08] your back
[1:06:10] he said he just laid his hand on this
[1:06:12] woman had short hair she cut her hair
[1:06:13] too
[1:06:15] that's just honoring her husband he's in
[1:06:17] a wheelchair he just laid his hands on
[1:06:19] her back
[1:06:20] and prayed and she started jumping and
[1:06:22] screaming
[1:06:23] and shouting and lows
[1:06:26] he said she started jumping she said
[1:06:28] it's gone it's gone she said your hand
[1:06:30] is so hot your hand is so hot thank you
[1:06:32] thank you
[1:06:32] he's like don't thank me thank christ
[1:06:36] and he said the holy spirit put out his
[1:06:37] heart leave right away
[1:06:39] because she was gonna like just thank
[1:06:40] him instead of christ
[1:06:42] so he just scooted on his wheelchair
[1:06:44] down the road
[1:06:47] and he said that it happened numerous
[1:06:48] times a man that god won't heal
[1:06:51] but using him to heal others now that's
[1:06:54] fake church
[1:06:56] i said brother you have the faith of
[1:06:57] give the gift of faith
[1:06:59] get the miracles that's a miracle and
[1:07:01] definitely divine healing too
[1:07:03] as i listen to all these testimonies see
[1:07:06] and then church now once you know your
[1:07:07] gift right invest in those
[1:07:08] right god help me to be ready to pray
[1:07:10] for sick people
[1:07:13] praise god amen you understand
[1:07:17] and i said brother i said brother that's

[1:07:21] got the book right here i said open up
[1:07:24] chapter 11 he said he opened it was
[1:07:26] exactly on chapter 11.
[1:07:28] he said look at that the lord wanted me
[1:07:30] to see that i said i teach on all the
[1:07:32] nine gifts of the holy spirit in chapter
[1:07:33] 11.
[1:07:35] proving what it is without a man without
[1:07:36] a shadow of doubt now church if that's
[1:07:38] and you know what he said he said
[1:07:39] brother jesse i'm not a scholar like you
[1:07:41] preachers
[1:07:41] i can't memorize things i can't i can't
[1:07:43] even remember all these scriptures
[1:07:45] he said but i have a burning passion to
[1:07:47] witness and to pray for sick people
[1:07:49] oh and i said brother let that let that
[1:07:51] fire burn
[1:07:52] let that desire burn let that mind boil

[1:08:32] apollos was fervent boiling in the
[1:08:34] spirit and now he wasn't even born again
[1:08:36] right because they in ephesus they
[1:08:38] didn't know the holy ghost right
[1:08:39] so he was just boiling in the human
[1:08:41] spirit until paul said until
[1:08:44] paul came then they got the real fire
[1:08:49] paul said we should be kind to one
[1:08:51] another fervent boiling in the spirit

[1:12:06] about it right
[1:12:07] jesus will work it out if we let him
[1:12:11] now there's so many more
[1:12:18] i have this is slide 35 over 2 almost 30
[1:12:22] quotes
[1:12:23] just on brother barron's quotes
[1:12:26] he net okay one time yeah let me show
[1:12:28] you but here's the one time he says
[1:12:29] lukewarm christian
[1:12:30] so this can only be foolish virgin i'm
[1:12:34] not saying this is scary i'm saying this
[1:12:35] sanely as i know how to stand near the
[1:12:37] pulpit and say it
[1:12:38] but my heart's been stirred for a time
[1:12:40] and i know that we're ready for
[1:12:41] something now come on in
[1:12:42] and you christians don't stay in that
[1:12:44] lukewarm condition anymore so see that's
[1:12:45] the foolish version
[1:12:48] because a holy ghost to a christian he's
[1:12:50] not lukewarm
[1:12:52] he can't be he's got eternal life he's
[1:12:55] already passed from death
[1:12:56] luke warmness is death it's death it's
[1:12:59] spewed out
[1:13:00] it's sickness a real christian those
[1:13:03] already passed from death
[1:13:05] unto life now i'll go to my favorite one
[1:13:09] so look
[1:13:09] see i studied all this up for you i
[1:13:11] don't have time to preach all these
[1:13:12] i wear you out
[1:13:16] um so i'm just gonna hit my favorite
[1:13:18] yeah
[1:13:19] so lot is the most often person chose to
[1:13:22] express lukewarmness
[1:13:23] now church look at that lot live right
[1:13:26] next
[1:13:26] to all those sodomite homosexual men
[1:13:28] that were violent
[1:13:29] gang bangers violent men that beat down
[1:13:31] doors just to get more men
[1:13:34] he lived right amongst that the bible
[1:13:35] said he was tormented day and night
[1:13:37] but he was a believer but there was a
[1:13:39] better believer
[1:13:40] there was abraham who said i'm not i
[1:13:43] don't care how much money they offer me
[1:13:44] i'm not buying property inside of i'm
[1:13:47] going to live away from those sinners
[1:13:49] and i'm going to train my family and
[1:13:50] friends to honor god
[1:13:53] so which one are you are you the one
[1:13:56] living close to sinners
[1:13:57] and being tormented by it every day
[1:13:59] because you're too close to it when you
[1:14:01] could just move out
[1:14:03] and enjoy the peace of god and live with
[1:14:05] the promises of god
[1:14:08] and have the son of man visit you amen
[1:14:11] hallelujah by an oak tree amen
[1:14:15] i don't know which one are you brother
[1:14:18] random always uses a lot
[1:14:21] and look church look at this he wasn't
[1:14:23] the mouthpiece
[1:14:24] lot was not the mouthpiece of god
[1:14:27] because he went to his son-in-laws and
[1:14:28] said you got to come out
[1:14:29] and the bible said they laughed at him
[1:14:32] yeah you're an old fool
[1:14:33] father-in-law yeah like like we're going
[1:14:35] to burn inside him
[1:14:37] see he wasn't the mouthpiece anymore but
[1:14:40] abraham was the mouthpiece
[1:14:42] abraham was the mouthpiece of god
[1:14:45] hallelujah
[1:14:46] him and his wife sarah up there so
[1:14:49] because god went to them and god said
[1:14:50] i'm not going down to sodom
[1:14:52] my mouth amen i'm saying with abraham's
[1:14:55] seed
[1:14:56] i'm saying with the royal seed of
[1:14:57] abraham praise god
[1:15:00] i'm saying with my mouthpiece in other
[1:15:01] words
[1:15:03] and brother man said billy graham is a
[1:15:05] modern day
[1:15:06] lot he called him by name
[1:15:10] remember billy graham taught you got the
[1:15:12] holy ghost as soon as you say a sinner's
[1:15:14] prayer
[1:15:15] oh lord forgive me i'm all my sins come
[1:15:18] into my heart
[1:15:18] amen i'm filled with the holy ghost and
[1:15:21] they act like a bunch of dead church
[1:15:23] members
[1:15:24] don't they they're going to smoke and
[1:15:27] drink and cuss and watch dirty filthy
[1:15:28] things and living homosexuality
[1:15:30] and living adultery that's what most of
[1:15:32] them do live in adultery
[1:15:33] right there and say they got the holy
[1:15:36] ghost they're far from it because my
[1:15:38] god's holy praise god
[1:15:40] he cleans out the church before he comes
[1:15:42] in amen he cleans it up it's not a sick
[1:15:44] church
[1:15:44] it's a healthy church it's a vibrant on
[1:15:47] fire church
[1:15:47] that's the kind of church he visits like
[1:15:49] ours amen
[1:15:51] hallelujah praise god you don't visit
[1:15:54] those billy graham denominations but
[1:15:55] bless his heart
[1:15:56] but he don't visit kind of those they're
[1:15:58] no longer the mouthpiece of god
[1:16:01] they can't even figure out do i get the
[1:16:02] holy ghost
[1:16:04] when i say a sinner's prayer or when i
[1:16:08] got real boldness to speak the word of
[1:16:09] god
[1:16:10] i can't figure out
[1:16:13] they can't forget this does a woman
[1:16:15] preach the bible or not
[1:16:16] the bible says she shouldn't but my
[1:16:18] pastor says she can
[1:16:20] i mean are you serious that's not an
[1:16:22] on-fire church
[1:16:24] right and on fire church is a saint paul
[1:16:27] fire baptized
[1:16:28] that's some of their names holy
[1:16:30] ghostfield church holy ghost and fire
[1:16:32] baptism in the church
[1:16:34] if paul said it i believe it that
[1:16:36] settles it i'll be judged by that praise
[1:16:38] god
[1:16:39] amen fearless with the word of god
[1:16:44] not these well i don't know i guess i'll
[1:16:45] let my wife
[1:16:47] paint her nails and wear high heels and
[1:16:50] show off her her body to the whole
[1:16:53] church and wear skin tie
[1:16:54] i guess it's okay if you wear skin tight
[1:16:56] clothes in the church
[1:16:58] you compromiser you lukewarm lot church
[1:17:02] member
[1:17:03] is that right that's what mrs lot was
[1:17:05] she must have been that because god
[1:17:07] turned her into salt
[1:17:10] god turned her into a piece of salt so
[1:17:12] she must have been some backslidden
[1:17:15] make-believe like like you this is scary
[1:17:17] she was lost
[1:17:19] but sarah wasn't anything like that she
[1:17:21] was a woman of promise
[1:17:24] she saw the son of man coming to cern
[1:17:26] standing behind her in the thoughts and
[1:17:28] tense of the heart
[1:17:30] she saw the sign of the son of man and
[1:17:33] we've seen it too
[1:17:34] it's thus saith the lord the last sign
[1:17:36] of the gentiles
[1:17:37] thank god we've received the sign and
[1:17:40] billy graham went like okay that's a
[1:17:42] fine sign and he walked away right
[1:17:44] no and he knew the man he knew the sign
[1:17:45] he knew that man
[1:17:47] and turned down the son of man
[1:17:50] that's foolish that's a lot experience
[1:17:54] well we like brother ram's gift but when
[1:17:56] he starts preaching the bible well
[1:17:58] maybe you should read the bible remember
[1:18:00] i saw that i told you i saw that article
[1:18:02] i saw the interview with billy graham
[1:18:04] they said what's one regret you have he
[1:18:05] said i wish i would have studied my
[1:18:07] bible more
[1:18:08] why wish you would have too you found
[1:18:11] out that brother branham wasn't he
[1:18:12] wasn't off his rocker he was right on
[1:18:13] the word
[1:18:15] he was right with the word and he had
[1:18:17] the signs to back it up which you didn't
[1:18:19] have
[1:18:20] right and then and the same said now
[1:18:23] it's easy to preach on
[1:18:24] the ground let's bring it down to us
[1:18:25] right are we boiling for jesus
[1:18:29] it's good to preach on that but let's
[1:18:30] check ourselves
[1:18:34] there was lot that lukewarm church
[1:18:36] member
[1:18:37] half backslidden see kirk you're not a
[1:18:39] lukewarm church member
[1:18:41] if you're praying for the i'm talking
[1:18:43] about if you're born again if you're
[1:18:44] praying for people if you come here
[1:18:45] worship god with all your heart
[1:18:47] give god your tithes give god your
[1:18:49] offerings anything the church is into
[1:18:50] you're into it you're not lukewarm
[1:18:53] you're a lukewarm church remember that
[1:18:54] god spewed out your mouth if god's ever
[1:18:56] witnessed you use you to witness to
[1:18:58] people
[1:18:58] and do those things you're god's
[1:18:59] mouthpiece you might be humble but
[1:19:01] you're still god's he still brought you
[1:19:03] with his own blood amen
[1:19:05] hallelujah and don't trust your feelings
[1:19:08] trust the king of kings amen trust the
[1:19:11] promise maker
[1:19:12] hallelujah he's the promised keeper too
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:18] i'm sure lay there until you get the
[1:19:20] holy ghost until something happens
[1:19:22] then you can go on with your life you
[1:19:23] know i'm not a lukewarm
[1:19:25] church member anymore right
[1:19:29] look at that a modern billy graham he
[1:19:32] calls him my name
[1:19:33] to this prophet by this point brother
[1:19:35] william he took off the point he he took
[1:19:36] off the
[1:19:37] the punching gloves he took off the
[1:19:40] boxing gloves it's a bare fisted match
[1:19:41] by this point
[1:19:43] he said i'm not playing around in 1961
[1:19:46] he comes out i'm not playing around
[1:19:47] anymore with the trinity
[1:19:48] it's thus saith the lord it's of the
[1:19:50] devil
[1:19:51] he took off his his gloves there so this
[1:19:53] is gonna be a real fight now
[1:19:55] and that's when they said get rid of
[1:19:56] away from another brand away from other
[1:19:57] brands
[1:19:58] away from the word are you serious away
[1:20:00] from the gifts that can tell everybody
[1:20:02] the secret to their heart
[1:20:04] brother mj i got a video brother ram
[1:20:06] told a woman 15 secrets
[1:20:08] 5 10 15 in one prayer line told her her
[1:20:11] name her address
[1:20:13] her doctor's name just like jesus at the
[1:20:15] woman at the well
[1:20:16] he said go get your husband he said i
[1:20:19] don't have him he says you're right you
[1:20:20] had five and the one you're living with
[1:20:22] now
[1:20:22] not your husband she said i perceive
[1:20:24] you're a prophet
[1:20:26] amen that's who's visiting our church
[1:20:29] amen
[1:20:30] the son of man amen that's a modern
[1:20:33] billy graham
[1:20:34] but the son of man jesus christ has
[1:20:36] visited this generation
[1:20:38] giving us stuff saith the lord that's
[1:20:39] what we stand on that's what we have
[1:20:41] that brings us to boiling i hope you're
[1:20:44] getting close to boiling by now
[1:20:47] after an hour and 15 minutes of
[1:20:48] preaching here
