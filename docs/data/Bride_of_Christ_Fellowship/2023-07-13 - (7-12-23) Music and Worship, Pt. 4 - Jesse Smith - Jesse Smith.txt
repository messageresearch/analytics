TRANSCRIPT
========================================
heart lately I like to look at music and worship tonight just a general a general look at music and worship because tomorrow I'm headed to Junction City and I felt led last time I like to preach to them on some of these scriptures so I like to revisit this I preach on music in 2021 there in January so I just want to just revisit a few of those things by the grace of the Lord I trust you'll be blessed how many are blessed already to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen hallelujah it's always a joy to serve the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so second Kings chapter 3 verse 15 it was read one verse and have you be seated here by the grace of the Lord it's really neat brother Levi brother Thomas both came out of the Amish community and that's something I've got a lot in common there by God's good wonderful testimonies praise God so let's look to like a look at just a general thought of music and worship I'll probably start looking at worship verses and then just a few verses and quotations about music second Kings chapter 3 verse 15 we can all read this here if we can here uh box Grace and honor the word of God let's read this on three one two three but now bring me a Minstrel and it came to pass when the menstrual played that the hand of the Lord came upon him praise God may God as the blessings to dream of his word you may be seated praise God praise God of course most you know this context here I believe it's the prophet Elisha and uh he was visited by Jehoshaphat and uh also the son of Ahab and now ahab's son wasn't a very good man he was a corrupt man but Jehoshaphat was a pretty good man he was a he was good but he disobeyed in some areas the Bible said but overall he no doubt he was saved you can switch over have a few quotes here I just want to bring out of this thought just the power of worship and music Elisha was a prophet and these two men these two kings came to him and said we need the word of God and he didn't want to do it because it was ahab's son but he said for jehoshaphat's sake I'll do it he was a little bit uh upset Prophet we'd say because he knew the testimony of ahab's son was not a good testimony it turns into how it is you know sometimes we love our enemies but we don't love what they do so the prophet was not happy with what ahab's son was doing uh but because of the believer brother calls him one place the lukewarm believer another place he calls him the foolish virgin uh the wise I'm sorry yeah the wise would have been Elisha right he said but because of that believer I'll I'll answer your request and so uh to get it to get to get the profit out of this bad mood to get the profit out of this discouragement that this at this sinner you know is kind of just trying to get a word from the Lord from him he says bring a menstrual down here and a minstrels just say skilled musician uh who plays stringed instruments so he brought some string instrument down there maybe a harp or a something like that some type of guitar or some some type of a string instrument he started playing and as soon as he starts playing the Bible says the hand of God comes upon God's servant now how many know that sometimes when you really start worshiping God you feel God's presence come on you I feel it tonight praise God I don't know if you felt it tonight or not praise God hallelujah and so we just got ahead to get out of his bad attitude he had to just get into the worship and as soon as he got in the worship he felt God's presence come on him Hallelujah Hallelujah and then we know the story you know dig the valley full of ditches and everything like that and of course it led to their deliverance and their Victory but that's not really want to look at I just want to look at the importance of music and worship praise God so I want to uh you know I felt led to look at revisit this uh in the last few weeks you know I've been talking to some other brothers about music and and so forth and I just want to I'll get to that music but I first want to look at just some general scriptures on worship uh as some of you as most of you know uh I bapt in in April I baptized 17 former Amish people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it was all God God used brother Levi and I was just I was just standing there watching God do it I didn't do nothing they just needed a preacher to baptize him what's that that's how it always is God gets all the glory but I was just standing there watching what God was doing Chad Lamb was there and his friend Brother Kyle the minister well but they come out of a man-made legalistic church I mean it was so legalistic outside of the Bible they had a book like this thick of their own human rules they had to follow that weren't in the Bible and on the very first sermon I said well who's sick and who wants prayer only one person was sick I said are there any other needs and every other person raised their hand I need deliverance from the fear of man I thought wow here uh the Believers you know they were all like I was looking at they look healthy they look fine but that's from the outside right God saw down to the inside and they were tormented by the fear of their former Pastor now thank God they're free they prayed anointed the place with oil and the pastor left by God's grace it's now they're free in Christ Jesus Hallelujah but it was really just something and you know to see them just come out of basically come out of legalism and just want the truth and so I just felt inspired to start preaching on preach on the Seven Seals uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost to them just laying these foundational truths that they need I preach a little bit on Dancing that was good by God's grace I got to dance around the brother's garage that was wonderful so I had to make sure I didn't hit my head on the garage door things there but it was great just to be free in the Holy Spirit and last time we were there we preached on the baptism Holy Ghost and the leaders weeping and crying he said he said I can't imagine for 58 years I never knew this but now I'm 59 and now the Bible's becoming a brand new Bible to me because he's not under the fear of man he's under the fear of God hallelujah amen but Lord willing tomorrow the Lord tarries and if the Lord guides our steps and we stay healthy and everything I want to preach on some of these scriptures about worship just general scriptures about worship tonight uh and I'll preach it Lord willing to them uh tomorrow now the first time the word worship is used in the Bible is of course with Abraham when he went to uh he was told by God to sacrifice Isaac we know it's just a test God is not a murderer right it was just a test and Abraham passed the test Hallelujah but he was told to go worship now of course we know there are other examples of worship before this like with Noah they had burnt offerings and and of course Cain and Abel different examples of worship some were accepted some were rejected and we want accepted worship praise God we want God to accept our worship praise God now worship is simply in the Hebrews means to bow down that's why I was bound down during that song you know I thought about this and that's just it's one way to worship now we know it's more important to Bow your heart than to Bow your knee but we know every knee will bow praise God if you don't bow your knee now to Jesus Christ one day you will praise God so let's do it now while we have life and breath praise God Hallelujah what God really wants though is a heart that's bowed to do God's will in other words God wants a humble heart that will hear the word of God receive it with gladness and then obey it praise God that's the Bowing that's the worship that God really wants tonight praise God and yes the real worship of God will make you fall down maybe lay at the altar maybe kneel at the altar here maybe kneel at your chair there and seek God and go home and pray in your closet praise God to make a bow down at your bed and pray and close your eyes and cry out to God it'll make you do that too praise God but what God wants is your homage or your respect that's what God wants now the word homage to us means respect or recognition or admiration or honor so if someone says well I'm a worshiper of God what they're what they're trying to say is I admire God I honor God I'm recognizing God hallelujah and so there's a lot of uh you know synonyms and and so forth and so we can understand basically homages worship and his respect it's giving God glory in other words praise God now of course we see this in the New Testament as well Jesus said God's a spirit and God is looking now previous verse says God's looking for worshipers amen praise God I wonder where he'd find him he'd find them right here tonight praise God that's where he'd find them amen you're not going to find him in the bar necessarily he's not going to find him at the movie theater he's going to find them in the house of God hallelujah this is God's house Hallelujah and so he's looking for true worshipers that will worship Him in spirit and in truth praise God and so now we see through Jesus this is the same of course in the Old Testament God wants people that will worship in the Holy Spirit and worship in truth praise God Hallelujah now it's very simple to understand you know uh Worship in the spirit means you're actually following the leading of the Holy Spirit the holy spirit's anointing you the holy spirit's empowering you amen and then at the same time you're obeying the truth of God's word amen amen you're not following some man-made idea or Jesus said a tradition of man like a traditional man is praying to Mary you never find that in the Bible that's a tradition of man or listening to a woman preach you'll never see a woman preacher in the Bible that's a tradition of man so there they are worshiping but they're not worshiping in the truth but Jesus said Worship in spirit and in truth praise God Amen that's the word here tonight by God's grace Amen to Worship in spirit and Truth Now the New Testament worship means to kiss like a dog licking his Master's Hand and I got a fresh experience that when I wrote with Austin last week his dog jumped all over me and licked me I felt like I'd taken a bath there laughs he was just licking me all over I don't have a dog or so it's kind of fresh to me you know also means you know just the act of you know kissing your hand out to kiss a man's hand is is worship that's why we don't kiss men we don't kiss the Pope's hand we don't kiss any man's hand because destruction of worship it also means profound reverence so the most the most possible respecter or an admiration you give to anybody that's worship but we don't give it to uh people we give it to Christ amen we respect everyone here but we don't respect them as much as we respect God because if someone in here told you to do something wrong you would respectfully decline amen because you respect God's word more Hallelujah amen but of course you should love your all your family friends and so forth we understand that so we get the idea it's this idea of giving the highest respect the highest honor is worship you know other definitions I remember are just you know someone's value right when you worship them you show their value I'm glad we could come here we can we can play the piano the organ and raise our hands and clap and stomp and and wave our hands we show God how much we value him praise God we don't do that for anybody else amen or anything else praise God we do that for Jesus only praise God he's worth it praise God Amen he's worthy of it Hallelujah because he died on the cross and he rose from the grave and he sent the Holy Ghost into our hearts Hallelujah that's why he's worthy amen Glory so just simple we get in the spirit by obeying the truth Simon preached out on Sunday right how do you walk in the spirit how do you walk in the light you obey the truth it's that simple whether you feel the anointing or not if you keep obeying you're going to feel the anointing praise God I eventually come back praise God you know if you grieve the Holy Spirit he's like the Dove and he flies away but if you keep obeying he'll come back and anoint you praise God hallelujah sort of walk in the spirit you have to obey and then crucify the desires of the flesh we saw that in Galatians 5 on Sunday and then church now that we got that now that we're obeying and we feel God's spirit now we start praising God just like Elisha amen hallelujah and the spirit drops down upon us like I wasn't anticipating to preach like this tonight I know the prince of God is here amen foreign before service now you won't see me yelling the rest of the service praise God I tell you thank God Amen because the spirit of God perks you up amen it anoints you it empowers you Hallelujah now there's many expressions of worship and this is what I want our former former Amish friends I want to call them Amish anymore I want to call them The Junction City Saints because they're not Amish anymore Hallelujah they come out of the Amish community I want to give them the right name but I want to just show them you know and just remind us some of the simple ways we can express worship now before I go on you know there's there's lots of ways to express worship to God I'll just share a few you know uh you know when we're over there in Napoleon a couple months ago and we had that six hour service I preached for two hours brother and then the children danced uh I dance we scream shouted we cried at the altar the Holy Ghost fell in six people for two hours we did that two hours straight but what started that I started dancing and then remember Haven come running up see so at some point someone's got to get in the spirit as well you've got to do something to get in the spirit all right amen see I I watched a video we want to watch the video didn't we last week I was dancing all by myself and then pretty soon Heyman comes up and then it's like a rush of the Holy Ghost fell remember you guys remember that yeah someone had to do something amen you need a Miriam out there amen and Moses to start singing in the spirit praise God amen amen he's somebody to act on the word to love God to worship God to show God some homage Hallelujah to show God some respect Hallelujah to show him some honor praise God now you remember brother Troy sweetie sweetie right uh it's been a while he's up in Michigan I just lost touch with him I wouldn't invite him to preach again I love his ministry he was the one that prayed for uh sorry he's the one that prayed for brother Philip who had a cane and he and he went when he went back to his seat he said I feel burning in my leg within one week he no longer needed the cane anymore because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he still does Miracles he still heals the sick he still raises the dead praise God maybe not when we want to but when he wants to praise God anyways brother Troy always tells this story I think he told last time I was listening to a sermon he said one time he was in the service and he said he heard a voice say stand up on the chair no way he just went back to singing you know you know Troy you know he's probably like this and you heard the voice again stand up on the chair and worship the third time he said stand up on the chair brother said he stood up on the chair he said as soon as he did that the Holy Ghost fell people started screaming shouting there was tongues interpretation weeping out the altar I don't know all the testimonies but he had to obey the leading of the Holy Spirit right just like this just like with uh the Prophet Elijah you have to oh yeah someone has to do something God is leading someone to do something right God's leading me to God's leading you God's leading us to do something but we got to do what the Holy Spirit wants us to do praise God amen like what led me that remember a few weeks ago what let me to say Austin you have a migraine this morning remember that I didn't even know he had a migraine it was discernment and then we prayed for him and it left in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah it was God it was just God speaking through me I mean how privileged are we that God could speak through US praise God because we're nothing we're nobodies what a privilege he'd borrow our lips and our in our confused Minds sometimes you know in our our bad attitudes he can still use us but we got to get in the spirit first amen [Applause] we just got to get in the spirit spirit and Truth praise God I know we got the truth I've written two books on it no one's ever stood up to it so I know we got the truth and that's because it was first in the church age book that's why I just borrowed those I just borrowed it and expanded on it now let's look at some of these examples you know and I want these you knew worst person no I want you to know too you can bless God with a loud voice in church now traditionally when we come into church we come in real quietly because the world is so busy right we can I mean who is busy today I thought my head was going to spin off I had so much going on well get Malachi the haircut I get this oh don't forget that get the car seats in the car I was like man I was so busy and that's why when we come in we don't come in talking we try to calm down and talk to God because our now we're eventually going to get loud praise God but the world is so loud there's so many distractions there's so many voices so many notifications and dings and videos and then we got to quiet our Spirits a little bit we got to say bring me a bring me a Malachi bring me an amen bring me a Lydia is that right Church bring me a menstrual bring me a Brother Ray who can play the tambourine or sister Naomi plays that or whoever whoever else plays that bring me a neutral praise God so we quiet down and we try to get in the spear and make sure we're obeying the truth praise God amen but the Bible says you know when Jesus here a week before he was arrested Palm Sunday they were the people were shouting blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees among the multitudes sending him Master rebuke our disciples and he answers to them I tell you if these would if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out because the Bible had said uh it was 500 years earlier that when Jesus came riding on a cult the foul of an ass that the Bible said they would shout Hosanna so God said it's going to happen it's going to happen Hallelujah and if the people wouldn't do it God said I'll raise up stones and do it praise God it's going to happen someone's going to shout with the loud voice saying blessed be the king Blessed Be King Jesus Hallelujah somebody's gonna do it praise God Hallelujah don't understand Jesus and say yeah you're right you know we should quiet down and maybe not praise praise me so much he said let him praise me amen hallelujah it's written God wanted it to happen that's why God prophesied about it praise God so we can expect that Hallelujah now we don't have the body of Jesus but when the spirit of Jesus comes in then we can shout blessings honor praise Glory Majesty might Old Dominion goes to Christ Our King Hallelujah [Applause] that's right [Applause] so you got the right to do that that's true worship also you can kneel or stand with their hands up you can stand like this if you want or you can kneel down whichever one you want or you can sit with your hands up you might as well now you got all three levels right standing kneeling and sitting you got all three levels and you can do that praying in a loud voice if you want now normally we wait till after the preaching right because the preaching is God's message to his people that's what the Bible says the ministers the Bible say they give themselves to study to word and prayer God gives them the word you come out the you sing and worship the spirit comes down you preach the word of God God's people receive God's word and then it's time to worship hallelujah or then it's time to cast out Devils Hallelujah amen because God's power is present to heal Hallelujah there's numerous examples in this case it's Solomon Solomon was kneeling in the blue there kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven he prayed his huge long prayer I think it's a whole chapter long so he's praying on his knees and and he's blessing God asking God to anoint the house and then he stands up and then He blesses all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice so he prayed with a loud voice and then he blessed the people of the LIE Bush saying blessed be the Lord hallelujah amen he blessed the Lord Jehovah the self-existent one now church it's okay like we know there's a balance too it's okay to quietly praise God we're going to get to that the Bible said be still and know that I'm God when you're going through difficult times you don't feel like shouting you don't always have to right right there are times to be quiet but I'm just letting you know God love this amen that was the service where God the priest couldn't even get in the temple because God failed it Hallelujah God stop the priest from ministering because God wanted to dwell in that place hallelujah oh that's real worship Hallelujah that'd make you get on your knees wouldn't it if you saw a miracle if you saw the Holy Ghost if you saw somebody speak in tongues and interpret if you saw somebody healed by a miracle it'd make you fall on your knees and give God praise Hallelujah it's exactly right just for our visitors both Steve and Shelby you know my mom was here with cancer when I was eight years old she was dying of cancer she had bruises all over her back in the hospital the doctor gave her six months to live it's in it's incurable there was cancer of the liver and my dad said no and then someone else gave her a word of Prophecy from Psalm 118 17. I shall not die but I will live and declare the works of the Lord and one night my dad went he touched that location the cancer he rebuked in the name of Jesus Christ the next day it vanished she's still alive today never had any more cancer that will make me stand and give praise amen all the rest of my life Hallelujah and if you need America ask God for a miracle praise God man can I be like Solomon thank you God I bless you God I thank you for all you've done you've done great things Hallelujah you're the only one that can heal cancer you're the only one I can say my soul Hallelujah you're the only one that can fill with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah [Applause] I think we got some more Solomons in here Hallelujah if you ever see a miracle you'll glorify God hallelujah because that's the very definition America is something God can do that we can't do praise God that's why we praise him that's why we sing Hallelujah that's why we give him our offerings Hallelujah makes you want to sing a ham by God's grace Paul said in the New Testament I wish men everywhere would lift up their hands pray without doubting Lord are you are you still in heaven now don't we all do that to yourself Lord are you sure you're there is anybody listening up there Paul said stand there lift up your hands don't doubt know that God hears your prayers amen sorry so I wish ever I will that's what I want everybody to do praise God stand there and give God praise know that he's close know that he'll never leave you nor forsake you no Romans 8 28 that all things will work together for your good because you love God hallelujah [Applause] now when you're in despair you can do the same thing Solomon fell down in just total Adoration of the the Holy Ghost fill in the temple but Ezra saw all the sin that had taken over Israel and Jerusalem especially the people in Jerusalem so he falls down the Bible says and he spreads out his hands to God and you should read this chapter I read it this morning he he confesses his sins the sins of his fathers the sins of the people they were marrying the wrong people they're marrying Sinners they were doing child sacrifices they were working on the Sabbath day and the Bible said he ripped out his own hair I don't advise that I mean you can do whatever you want I mean God might lead you to that I guess I've never done that but I want you to see you know God God heard that worship and he blessed it he helped Ezra teach the people they already had the house right the house of God as we're taught the people and then Nehemiah come and builds the house Hallelujah it was a it was a it was a waiting game it was Lord be it was Lord give me patience I know you're going to finish this but Lord clean out our lives as well amen separate the people from their sins help us obey your commands help us to Worship in truth amen Hallelujah we got the Holy Spirit now help us to Worship in truth praise God let us marry the right people praise God let us honor every command of God hallelujah then we're gonna get somewhere with God number three giving God praise and thanks to Jesus name is an acceptable sacrifice think about that people say I just want to find God's will I just want to do something for God we'll stand here and give him praise and now you've done it Hallelujah tell Jesus thank you and you can walk out that door knowing I gave God a sacrifice tonight that's what the Bible says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God not just Sunday not just Wednesday night now continually what is this the fruit of your lips giving thanks to Jesus's name that's why I love leaving here after church I said praise God God help me to obey the word of God I know I'm the worst of our praise God Satan can't talk me out of it amen I know I praise God I know I thank God I'm not forgetting that I'm a worshiper praise God I'm the one God is seeking after the one who worships in spirit and in truth amen I did what God wanted me to do praise God like I told you you can lay down your head at night and say God thank you Lord I know I paid your word tonight praise God I know you're gonna wake me up in the morning and I can obey more of your word hallelujah praise God thank God here he says it again Peter you are not a dead stone you're a living Stone we see a lot of dead stones out there right but you're different you're not dead you're not getting kicked around pushed around you're part of a building you're part of a living building it's called the body of Christ Hallelujah I'm a part of a living breathing body a building that keeps building ah it's an awesome brother I got my piece in and then you come in and then Austin came in and we all got our pieces we're part of the living body of Jesus Christ on Earth amen Hallelujah so my suggestion is find your place Hallelujah don't leave here until you know your place in the body of Christ Hallelujah Gloria this also includes keeping your body separate from sin that's what we all have trouble as Sinners the Bible said present your body as a Living Sacrifice right holy so you can't live Unholy you can't do drugs you can't get drunk you can't have sex before marriage you can't be a homosexual the Bible's against all that that's Unholy you've got to present your body a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God God only accepts you when you come through his word hallelujah yes and that's reasonable if you want to get to heaven you've got to obey the king of Heaven praise God if you want to be part of the the king of kings kingdom you've got to obey the laws of the king praise God Hallelujah don't be conformed don't be molded to this world don't be slowly Changed by what you see on Tick Tock I don't even have tick tock don't be molded by what you see on the news don't let the word of God mold you praise God that the word of God molds you and change you to be a Living Sacrifice and then you'll have a renewed mind you'll feel like like the brother said all that weight when he got saved all that weight come off of you it felt like a feather [Music] I was cleaning out you know art this may be silly illustration but I was cleaning out a broom you know kitchen brooming had all this hair on it and I tried to throw it down but the wind picked it up and I thought this is strange this big Bob of hair this handful of hair I thought wow the hair is flying like that I thought wow look at the power of how the wind lifts lifts something up praise God I'm expecting it to fall but God sends a win and it lifts it right up that's what the brother said that's like our sins right we cast them down but they all taken care of they all Fly Away praise God we become lives of feather we become brand new we're transformed praise God [Applause] just flies away send away see we have to keep our bodies separate from sin if we want to be a sacrifice fourth is sing songs and hymns Psalms and hymns and these help us be filled with the spirit Hallelujah Amino singing is very powerful if you want to experience God in your car in your home in your church at your job sing there sing that's what the Bible says be not drunk with wine where in his excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melt in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things oh I could say that again praise God because that's what I need that's what we need to give thanks in all things praise God no matter what comes my way God help me to give thanks in all things praise God not to complain not to have a pity party but Lord help me to give thanks in all things praise God unto the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so the Psalms are of course David's Psalms and the other writers of the book of Psalms hymns are sacred songs according to the Greek they're songs of sacred praise to these really like some of the ones we sang tonight so ones we sang on Sunday Hallelujah these sacred songs let it be done on Earth as it is in heaven let your will be done in me let your kingdom come in me of course Melody is the sequence of notes that's where you have sing some notes Jesus I'll never forget what you've done for me oh and I'm in the spirit praise God I said you can say hallelujah you can say that I'm singing I'm worshiping I got the melody I'm walking in the spirit praise God Hallelujah now I like this one a lot this has been my uh this has been my victory in 2023 and 2022. there's not a lot of room to dance but I've danced around this church many times this last year here hallelujah because I didn't realize all the freedom we had to dance praise God till this year and David danced the Lord with part of his might oh that that guy was sweating out there like I'm almost sweating tonight here he was sweating he was dancing for God he was praising the Lord oh he was giving God glory he was worshiping God he was maybe doing something like this I'm not sure but he was using all of his might to give God praise Hallelujah Hallelujah he was leaping and dancing before the Lord see church that's what we've got to realize when we come here you're not clapping to me you're not clapping to the Musicians you're clapping and singing to Jesus Christ I'm not really preaching for you I'm preaching to glorify God hallelujah I want you to receive the word I'm not trying to impress you I'm trying to say what the word of God says I want God's word to impress you praise God so it helps you overcome your trials helps you be a better Christian helps you to love the unlovable helps you to give your life as a spiritual sacrifice Hallelujah amen leaping and dancing before the Lord Hallelujah I can't believe what the preacher did before the entire congregation you missed it the preacher was doing that before the Lord missed it right that's what McCall was doing look at him look at him and said she should have been looking at the ark that's what we should be doing we should be looking at the ark we should be looking at the presence of Christ tonight Hallelujah this holy spirit that gives life it makes you holy praise God [Music] [Applause] David even told Macau she criticized him to say oh you were so she used sarcasm oh you were So Glorious today he said it was before God and if you didn't like that I'm going to play before the Lord again if you don't like the first round wait till round two comes look up play means play means to laugh it means to sing and dance so Dave was laughing saying praise God the ark is here the power of God is here God is living with us amen God is amongst his people we're an invincible Army praise God he was having a good time with all the smart praise God I'll do this one more time now watch out wall he leap with all of his might praise God that's what the Bible said he lead with all of his might and the woman has said uh she never had a child because she despised what he was doing to show God his thanks oh let's give God thanks tonight praise God let's give God praise Jesus is Worthy of all our praise we should thank him for life we should thank him for salvation we should thank him for the Bible praise God Glory like the brother said we should be thankful for clean water be thankful for three meals a day some of us might do four you know what I mean we should be thankful we should help out the poor those are called alms now here's the one most people like but they they pervert it right because the holy spirit will the holy spirit will move on them to worship or stand up on the chair or run where's Haven or run up to your dad and dance around of course she's out yeah and the No Doubt the Satan was saying just sit still just be still and know he's God that's the wrong verse for the wrong hour devil hallelujah praise God Amen but there's a time when we should be still and quiet like I said when we first come in unless you really under the anointing unless you were like worshiping God all day I've had a few days like that where I got to study and pray all day before I preach him boy I was ready to go I was pumped and primed hallelujah praise God I studied for three hours today so I'm pretty primed today by God's grace Hallelujah but I'm still tired you know but you know he said be still and know that I'm God I'll be exalted among the Heathen in other words

restrictions I'm an entire nation he'll build a church on somebody's property they don't even know what it's going to be used for I wonder if we'll get to use it brother I wonder about Thomas we'll get to use it who knows he'll put it on a man's heart he's the man's not even a preacher he's just what he just as he just said God told him to build the church Lord again God does what he wants what he wants let me give you some suggestions let's just get behind what God is doing praise God [Applause] Glory remember Elijah was in the cave in First Kings 19 he heard an earthquake God wasn't in that he saw fire god wasn't in that but after the fire he heard a whisper now it's here whisper you got to be kind of quiet don't you now what kind of a condition was in he was in a suicidal condition he was saying God let me die with my fathers he just killed 450 bail Prophets and then by the threat of one woman he was running for his life all of us would have did it right we're not putting any shade on him all of us would have done that but look how merciful god is even when you feel like I want this to be the end even when you feel like I wanted this to be over God will say what are you doing here he said I'm the only one left and God said preaching don't give up on God Hallelujah you're not the only one I'm gonna need that praise God you're Charles someone else has already gone through that and you get through it as well praise God you're not the only one remember he's the God of Angel Armies praise God he'll send his angels he'll send his Heavenly Host praise God he's so faithful he'll rescue you praise God amen it's in those moments of suicide and despair he'll whisper and say what are you doing you really want me to take your life no no God I'm sorry no God I'm so sorry we all do that right you sure you want me to do that Hallelujah I just said well I can I can try again let me eat some of that food I'll run for 40 miles on this one talk about an athlete my

outran and shared that's what we need spiritual food in new season thank God we got it praise God Hallelujah [Applause] there's a time to be still and know he's God there's also time to raise your hands and Shout I guess we're getting some of that tonight by God's grace members you want to play instruments we're not going to read all these but Moses when he's up to Tabernacle there was no instruments but when David sets it up 500 years later he says now you got to have new songs we love the old songs but you got to learn some new songs and to make sure I'm going to give you some new songs because we don't want the devil songs we want God songs amen how do you know they're God songs because they agree with the word of God Hallelujah he said Praise Him Rejoice before God Be Joyful that's what I can't say and I can't I just don't want to be a sad discouraged depressed Christian God help me I know I haven't gone through many trials maybe it's other people but God help me I always want to have some joy in my life praise God always be thankful for the cross praise God despite my trouser despite my troubles help me to show some Joy that people can see salvation is really a good thing God can actually make you happy drugs can't make you happy immoral sex can't make you happy but God can make you happy praise God money won't make you happy popularity won't make you happy overeating and obesity will make you happy the only thing that makes you happy is Jesus Christ forgiving your sins sending them away filling your soul with your spirit praise God [Applause] David said dance for God he said sing for God he said break out the timber break out the heart break out the trumpet the sultry the stringed instruments the organs the loud symbols and the high sounding symbols David said just lay all those out let's praise God oh you know what he was a man that loved God's heart praise God in other words he's allowed to use every single two I can to show God how much we love him praise God granted that we do the same thing praise God that was under the blood of bulls and goats yet we got better promises oh my goodness how much more will the blood of Christ Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God praise God oh Look What the Lord Has Done Hallelujah thank you Jesus you're allowed to shout and clap be glad in the Lord Saints and rejoice you righteous shout for joy all year that are upright all you that have integrity that means you don't say one thing and do the opposite you do what you say you tell God you're gonna do something you do it that's an upright heart if you make a mistake you come back and say I'm sorry that's my fault forgive me it's my fault and then if you do that the Bible says shout for Joy Hallelujah [Applause] be glad to the self-existent one you know because he existed before you came he existed right now and he exists when you'll be gone but you won't be totally gone you'll be with him praise God I just been gone from this pest house right here to the chief musician a psalm for the sons of Korah clap your hands all ye people shout unto God with the voice of Triumph Hallelujah [Music] if you ever go to Triumph you ought to clap for God hallelujah [Applause] stand for God if you've tried them because he's the man of war praise God he's fighting for you Hallelujah he bought the battle The Battle Belongs to the Lord hallelujah [Applause] doesn't say you might want to do it he said clap Hallelujah you've ever got a victory he said clap your hands and Shout because God is for you praise God won this battle God wrote the man in for the to buy the the the Timber and lumber by God's grace God sent that man in Hallelujah glory to God God's the one that provides God's the one that pours out blessings God the one that answers prayers he deserves all the clapping and praise Hallelujah yeah here's another one God's word will not return void it will accomplish what God wants and it will prosper see that's why you know God's doing something it's going to work out yeah may not be the way you wanted but it's going to work out it's going to comp generally it's going to accomplish God's purpose for your life if it's his word for ye who the Believers you will go out with joy because you know God's word is going to come to pass and be led forth with peace the mountains and Hell shall Break Forth before you and sing and imagine the mountains we just saw them over there in Pennsylvania a few weeks ago I didn't know they were singing to me actually I should have I should have listened a little harder there they were singing the whole time I was driving up those mountains on the curves boy I thought I was gonna fall off but the whole time they were singing praise God and all those trees were clapping their hands saying God is with you God's going to keep his word if God raised us up if God placed this mountain here hallelujah then he knows everything and he knows all the mountains in your life praise God hallelujah hallelujah he knows you're a tree of righteousness the Bible says ah Hallelujah thank God and saying amen is a part of church too in Deuteronomy 27 God had Moses given the law and he gave blessings and curses he also did in the days of Joshua and after every blessing the people said amen that means so shall so shall be so be it in other words truly barely that's right and so cursed be he that setteth his light by his father-in-law that means the disrespect to make light of a father mother and all the people shall Say Amen so be it curse of me he that removes his neighbor's Landmark you start to see on property and all the people shall say Thou shalt not steal I shall not steal I'll say amen hallelujah when people speak in tongues and they don't interpret Paul says how are people going to bless God in the occupying the room and the unlearned how should they say Amen when you're giving thanks for unknown tongues because they don't understand what you're saying see God wants every part of the service so the people can say Amen man like those songs on Sunday Naomi and I were talking we were talking we all said amen to those songs brother right hopefully you're saying Amen to this sermon Amen to the songs Amen to the greetings Amen to the testimonies praise God wants you to say Amen to his word that's what he wants you to do praise God Glory and there's times of fast don't eat and then there's time to feast Ezra going back to azer before he confesses sins in chapter 9 in chapter eight he's like I don't even know how we're going to get to Jerusalem so he said we got to have a fast nobody eat and we're going to get on our faces we're going to afflict ourselves before God I'm not eating breakfast I'm not eating lunch I'm not eating supper until God shows us how we're going to get our kids healthy how we're going to get to Jerusalem with all of our kids safe that's what the Bible says I Proclaim to fast before God to seek him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all of our substance when I didn't have a job I fasted and God gave me the job I got now what I didn't know about supposed to preach I fasted and God look at it look at me now I'm preach still preaching all these years 19 years later you got it fast praise God if you want to know the way praise God if you want to know Jesus he is the word he is the truth he is the Lord and if you want to know the word you gotta fast Hallelujah at least one time I'd say more than that but then Jesus says when you make a feast Saints call the poor the maim the lame and the blind now that's hard for us in this day and age that's why we got to give alms to people that's why we got to Give in secret praise God because everybody around me is wealthy just like we're we're Americans we're all have a certain level of wealth right I don't have to bite them right but I can't yeah I got my bands almost filled up what so what can I do I can give out alms praise God but Jesus said there's nothing wrong with having a feast now that's why I like I like some of the churches how they have these Feasts but they shouldn't brag about it you shouldn't know what your right hand your left hand should know what your right hand is doing right so may God give us wisdom praise God see that that's what we need there's nothing wrong with having a feast Jesus was a part of all the feasts of Israel and the Feast of Pentecost was a feast of rejoicing so was the Feast of trumpets and Tabernacles and Jesus stood up on Tabernacles and said If any man thirst let him come unto me praise God he was right there amongst the feasts and praise God nothing wrong with feasting just honor God in your Feasts anybody ready for a Thanksgiving meal this is no pressure honey there's many of these I mean I could put I couldn't put a number on there so many more another way to worship is to receive the word gladly in other words be happy for the sermon that you heard if it's if it's the Bible now if it's not the Bible you don't have to be happy about it but if I'm preaching you the Bible you ought to leave here happy because it's God's word and I'm making it easy for you don't have to turn your bible really you can just look off the screen here right try to make it as convenient as to me it's to redeem the time praise God because on Sunday nights that's when we'll go through the Bibles right Sunday nights we'll all turn to the Bible if I want to conserve my time while I'm here by God's grace so God wants you to receive the word with happiness give prayers wash each other's feet in communion take the bread and the wine ask for Doctrine ask doctrinal questions remember the Bible said the women aren't supposed to ask them that that was the case where they were challenging the preachers he said ask your husbands at home women because they had some contentious women in Corinth right so he said don't ask him in public ask him in private but that don't apply to us we're Holy Ghost filled Saints and a holy ghost woman wouldn't do that to a holy ghost preacher and none of you have either so God bless you I'm glad to be your pastor but we should want fellowship with everybody and we should gather more see that day approaching don't come to lest Church come to more Church then you know you're serving God the Bible said and they that gladly received Peter's word he preached were baptized if you haven't I forgot to put that one there get baptized if I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ not fathers and Holy Ghost because that's the title there's one name to the father son only goes that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a Catholic dogma the same day we're adding them three thousand Souls what a Revival well you had 14 or we had 17 brother they had 3 000. and they continue to steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and failures in other words they said teach me more teach me more of the word show me how to live a Christian Life let's Fellowship let's get together let's have a picnic praise God and the breaking the bread let's have communion and let's pray together praise God now just to summarize this just to give I want to do this for the Junction City Saints tomorrow night so your body's allowed to dance or be still whatever God leads you to do no pressure just let God pressure you or let God push you I'll say like that or let God encourage you yeah right God might want you to stand or he might want you to kneel or he might want you to bow whatever you feel like to do I'm not the Holy Ghost God's holy ghost he's going to tell you what to do these are all expressions of worship you might leap like I did you might have hands up or hands down you might be playing instruments or you might not be you might be tapping your feet like brother now brother bran was a prophet he died in 1965 but he prophesied numerous things in in advance and they came to pass he would tell people they're healed years before they were healed one time he told a woman thus say the Lord you have a baby she waited 10 years and she had the baby 10 years is no joke to wait the whole year all nine years like I said am I gonna have a baby or he said those other they're coming to pass God's word will never return void amen God's word will always be true praise God and he left us he left us instructions for the Bible Hallelujah brother says stomp your feet tap your feet of course I can go along with the symbols and the timber right fasting or you can Feast you can clap you can physically be gathered with the Saints you can take communion and be baptized now who wants to worship praise God doing that the last 23 years it's the greatest decision I ever made in my life Hallelujah I'm going to keep doing it for the next 23 praise God I gotta saved in the year 2000 so it's easy for me to calculate how many years I've been saved what can your voice do can be loud or can be quiet like you Lord you're not the only one there's more message Believers than just Akron I feel like we're the only ones they're down there in Kentucky aren't they they're down there in Delaware hallelujah or Navarre Navarre that's where that's your own Navarre I drive by Delaware singing you might sing you might praise you might thanks you might give a blessings you might magnify God you might shout you might speak in tongues of men or Angels Hallelujah you might say Amen you might ask to learn Doctrine you might uh ask for a fellowship with the Saints you might laugh for Joy like David did but all these are ways God loves to be worshiped I just proved it to you by the Bible praise God what more proof could we want praise God the Bible is good enough for me the b-i-b-l-e yes that's the book for me I stand upon the word of God the b-i-v-l-e Hallelujah now it's 8 15 already now how are we gonna how are we going to close this service here we're looking back what's going to happen here I think uh you know with music I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go from memory okay I studied three hours a day so I'm just gonna trust the Holy Spirit that first part was a lot longer than I thought let me set a timer for 15 minutes let me just do 15 minutes on this here now music for many years it wasn't a big issue but it's become a big issue because Satan has pressed his way into a lot of churches now we just had another witness that said they enjoy our worship right almost every Preacher Brother just before God almost every preacher that comes says that same thing yeah I just stand back and say well it's all Jesus we just love Jesus no one here deserves praise I mean you look nice but you a handsome guy but you know Jesus gives all the praise and then I fail every day you fail every day we know we're not worthy of any praise but there's someone who helps us overcome every day too and that's Jesus Hallelujah Glory but just a pair of just a just a shortness rock and roll is seeping its way into churches now if the churches are playing rock and roll they're already spiritually rebelling against the Holy Spirit that means their arms rays are in vain God doesn't receive it because the rock and roll spirit is a sexual spirit what does rock and roll mean it means sexual immorality we're between man and a woman I guess well I don't know what they do today but people do whatever they filthy filthies things today but it's it's basically fornication right two people knowing each other carnally the Bible says well once rock and roll gets in you they never get it out and then it it's the Bible says like leaven or Yeast it's going to make everything in the dough blow up it's going to make the problems worse and brother Brandon had a vision of this now think of this in 1965 brother brand had a vision I see I see the Church of America dancing to rock and roll and Church Rock and Roll didn't get in the churches to like the late 90s early 2000s how do I know because I was raised in charges I was raised in the church it didn't get in there until the late 1990s 30 over 35 years after brother Branham died God's word does not return voids Saints amen you can hang your soul on thus save the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah so that's what we got to watch out for me we have to make sure rock and roll doesn't get in our church and by God's grace we're doing a good job but we just want to review I just want to rehearse a few of these things because there's all my heart the sin of rock and roll is that the beats are sexually stimulating and if you're not sure about that go watch when Elvis first sang on Ed Sullivan go watch it the girls are shaking like they're going crazy and then a couple of concerts later they're throwing their undergarments up there on stage just the beat the Rhythm that will cause people to go sexually immoral just the beat right they didn't know that back then the Sinners didn't know that but God's Prophet knew that Hallelujah why because God chose the prophets the mysteries of God hallelujah God said I'll do nothing except I'll show my secret to my servants the prophets Hallelujah oh this is Rich amen glory because it was foretold and we got it on tape from 1965 and then the rock and roll didn't start to around 2000 35 years in advance thus say the Lord can never fail Hallelujah I know where we're standing we're not standing on a Creed we're not standing on a denomination like Baptist or Methodist or Lutheran we're not standing on that we're standing on the true interpretation of God's holy word we're standing on the Living God hallelujah Glory [Applause] and other men predicted rock and roll would take over none because none of them are prophets but God sent us a prophet Hallelujah as he promised in the Bible Malachi four five and six right Hallelujah Revelation 10 7 Luke 17 30. Hallelujah God prophesied of it he did it it's finished praise God thank God Hallelujah I just want to encourage you now there there were some foreshadowing so the origin of rock and roll was of course Satan right Satan was the worship leader in heaven according to Ezekiel 28. but then you know when when when Israel made the golden calf they had a noise of war and isn't that what rock and roll sounds like like I used to listen to Metallica right it was like man it's growing the war out here or something like that someone's gonna die today yeah we played before the football games like I'm gonna kill you it's a devil it's the devil it's the devil well this I mean there was origins of this even in the Old Testament any music that wasn't worse than God was Antichrist was from hell the Bible said it caused them to go naked so look at those women out there with bikinis on the beach they're practically naked they're full of demons and men that will wear this show disgusting body parts and show their body parts like that they got demons too they both got demons halleluia because they listen to rock and roll and rap and R B and Country and all it's all from hell because it worships man it worships Satan it worships whiskey bottles we go out to the Mexican restaurant I got this guy's thinking about whiskey like a hundred like every song is about whiskey like why do you worship alcohol the Bible said he'll come back and bite you like a snake in the end look at these people we got old family members they drink so much their liver's giving out on them and they look like they're orange almost I wonder if the orange man Trump drinks alcohol I don't know he sure looks Orange may God save his Souls my prayer all I know is when you drink alcohol your liver makes your skin look colors and what kind of dance did herodius's daughter do to make Herod say I'll give you half of my income now it's just a general statement you know I don't think they would actually give her half of the Kingdom but it's a statement like you've really pleased me what kind of dance would this girl do sexual how to be sexual right so what that's a pre-figure of rock and roll is not new any dance that's sexy produces sexual seduction is rock and roll it's playing they admit it all these guys admit it they don't have to you know you have to look very hard to find that this is a 1957. well the man said a lot of preachers try to justify Elvis Presley which is nothing in the world but a modern Judas is scared see he used to sing for God but then he sold out God's church and he went and sang For the Devil and look how he died he died on a toilet overdosed on drugs reading a book about sexual Magic a demon possession that's how he died but he could have stayed in the church and he could have been saved where did rock and roll get him what was he 40 40 37 or 42 remember brother young 40s that that's the poster boy the king of rock who wants to be like the king of rock and die on a toilet and church that rock and roll is trying to get in here we got to keep the rock and roll out it's every church not just us every Church well Graham said Judas got 30 pieces of silver Elvis Presley got a million dollars in a fleet of Cadillacs but he sold out same thing Whitney Houston did same thing Beyonce did they all started in church and they sold out their gifts to worship Satan you can see it there's videos Beyonce she's like I don't have power to sing but when that Spirit comes on me now she can sing and you can see her face it looks like a demon and then she starts dancing like a devil it's satanic filled with demonic Powers but thank God we're the opposite we're filled with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah praise God I raise my hands I can get on my knees I can leap for Jesus I can praise God I can sing his Praises I can wave my hands I'm filled with God's spirit Hallelujah I can be still and know that he's God here tonight whatever God leads me to do same thing for you Bill Graham said in 1957 I don't pull any punches on it he's a modern Judas he Elvis Presley said yeah I trust God for all my success how would a living holy God ever give success to vulgarity Elvis is on tape bragging about all the sexual adulteries he has like when he when he whenever he travels they would find prostitutes and he'd just do all kinds of filthiness and oh he sings Good gospel songs he's an imposter he's an impersonator right he's a pretender right he said I don't have any apology at all calling a guy like that old dirty filthy rock and roll and I was watching that video he was just singing that what song was saying the Hound Dog song we listened to that we said that's not that bad it was totally from hell he's telling girls you aren't anything but a hound dog how would that go over today uh yeah you want to go on a date you little hound dog I mean what what else you got I mean and people I mean they're they're shaking they're screaming he's basically degrading them and they fall in love with him and they lose their morals to him and he could never get it back now they can repent and get saved but they'll never get their integrity back that moment they can be saved or they'll repent noticeably says if you believe me to be God's Prophet remember there's an incarnate devil absolutely yeah he's pulled the devil now here's the vision brother brothers saw a vision and I'm going to skip ahead brother he's first sees a vision of the the true worshipers called the Jesus called them his bride in John chapter three they're walking in Step pretty young they got the stride of woman they're very gracefully ladylike that's the way she was walking so he first saw the True Believers walk really beautifully and then the he said the church of United States he said was led by a witch how many of these women singers are witches a lot of them are Tom Brady said his ex-wife was a witch did you know that he said his wife told him which years he'd win the Super Bowl and which ones he wouldn't and she trained him to set up altars in his locker to worship these demon spirits yeah yeah he won seven Super Bowls but he's possessed with demons probably his ex-wife certainly is and they just admit it right there I mean they admit it he said he said there were March into the time of twist and rock and roll he said they were holding like a a newspaper a gray newspaper he said holding in front of them like a hula skirt and completely nude from the waist up right twisting carrying on that music walking up and said that is the church and brothers he said I almost fainted he saw the he saw the first church go he said praise God and then he saw the American Church and then he said I won't say that if that's what is trying to be presented to Christ as a bride that kind of a immoral rock and roll uh naked Church of all the efforts and things I put forth to try to bring forth a bride for Christ a vulgar dirty filthy looking prostitute like that the bride of Christ it made me sick of my heart then he says it again she was twisting rocking moving herself one side the other like a modern dancers they had today using yourself in an immoral act so she's dancing sexy little man said I'm not responsible for things these things I can only say what I've seen and God is my judge but that was a church from the USA later he says this is thus saith the Lord and look it's come to pass look at Rock and rolls in every Big Church no wonder people don't want to come here we don't have rock and roll well good I don't want rock and roll I don't want prostitution here I want Holiness here praise God I want men that are true to their wives Hallelujah I want women that are true to their husbands praise God Like Jesus said one man one woman until death Hallelujah that's what Jesus said praise God not a bunch of like the Bible says whoremongers it's the Bible word and then he said when they passed by look he had to look in the vision and they didn't have any back covering on their back he said it almost felt faint and sickly but then God said the bride will come into preview again and here the bride came behind the very same looking bride that passed at the beginning lovely ladylike holy my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride and she'll be made of the same thing clothed in the same thing the one that was at the beginning she used to be called in other words the church in our day is going to be just like the book of Acts Church hallelujah amen hallelujah hahaha this Bible is going to live again Hallelujah God's going to restore the church Hallelujah Elias shall Truly Come and restore all things Matthew 17 11 says and I know that's the truth Saints if that isn't true than every Vision I've ever had in the back has been wrong like the vision of the woman having a baby 10 years later all divisions of all the sick people getting well they were all true because that's what God does God God doesn't lie Hallelujah and anyone knows that one thing he's ever told us but was the truth it come to pass can you see then the filthiness of the modern Church calling herself a church there's my 15 minutes a church some of the some of the debates say can we have drums or not well it all depends how you use them drums can either be holy or they can be Unholy depending how hard you bang on them and what kind of Beats you do with them too because that's all tambourine is it's just like a it's a handheld drum right didn't Miriam have a drum in her hand Glory it's a percussion instrument right and God said praise me with percussion praise me with loud symbols Hallelujah so there's a place for loud worship where people dance right people might leap around the church it might be fanatics but they love God they're God's Fanatics Hallelujah brother Brian was talking about our text we read at the beginning the prophet Elias I'm sorry uh Elisha he said they got to play in the music now listen if you can't be the prophet you can be one of the instruments how many know you're not a prophet good every every hand should be up I'm not I'm not I'm not looking right if you can't be the prophet be one of the instruments that plays the music to bring the spirit down to the prophet and brother said today the prophet is the Holy Ghost now that can be through your gift of Prophecy a gift of a dream speaking the word speaking to mountains and prophecy couldn't do any of that praise God he said you know I mean you know what I mean they begin to play they begin to beat the drums and play the instruments see drums aren't bad things as long as you're using the right way praise God these days God might raise us a little drummer up out of those little girls out there we got just enough room about right here for a drum I'll just try not to hit him when I'm dancing around trying to trip over the drums see there's a holy way to beat the drums remember Elijah said bring me a menstrual Minister was a player stringing bring me music if we want the spirit of God let's worship God here's another holy way brother I was talking about oh yeah brother I have said what we need today is the prophet arrives on the scene with thus say the Lord that was him and strip those things to the bottom and say that they become a stink the church denominations our dominations has grown our churches are big and they're finer than they ever was we'd be a lot better off with a tin pan standing on the Alley again with the guitar out there beating a drum or something other with the real Pentecostal fire in our souls Hallelujah ah I feel good amen I'd rather have freedom I'd Rather Have Jesus amen in a big church and fancy views and million dollar organ I'd Rather Have Jesus hallelujah praise God Amen [Applause] Glory thank God just a guitar all we had was a guitar and a tambourine we've been doing better praise God thank you Jesus I love you Jesus hallelujah we're better off amen that was filthy rock and roll [Applause] Hallelujah remember we're that original Church we're not the church United States we're the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we might live in the United States but we're really from Heaven Hallelujah boy can I ever close but ma'am also said Jesus is the great composer and in his Symphony he said there's heart there's violin there's Bass there's trumpets there's drums so now we got three quotes saying drums are okay but people come out and say no drums I'm sorry you can't take my Liberty from me if I remember Galatians chapter 5. verse one he put it up the Bible says and sister Karen shared this verse remember the Republic right before we started dancing remember that she said brother Jesse I always remember Galatians 5 verse one you know how she's so old she's so sweet about Jesse he reads Galatians 5 verse one that's right before he started dancing Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage that's why I'm preaching it to the uh the former Amish tomorrow I don't want the the devil to get them back into bondage we can't sing We got to be scared of the preacher all the time you ought to fear God but then you ought to rejoice in God hallelujah yo thank God when he hears your prayers you ought to give up you have a voice of Triumph when God answers your prayers Hallelujah you got to clap and sing and give God praise because God is so faithful praise God [Applause] the whole things together in a rhythm so there is a holy beat and there's an Unholy beat Hallelujah I'm glad we got the Holy One Hallelujah you want to hear all the Unholy one just put on Michael Jackson whatever the guys are today Jay-Z or Kanye whatever I don't know the guys who knows T.I 50 Cent and everything he's worth about 50 cents his mer his music ain't worth 50 cents it needs to be burnt and sent back to hell that's where he needs to go and he needs to repent and get saved now brother man does warn us though there's a devilish way to beat drumsy he says talking about worldly dances like nightclubs right I don't believe you would go up now surely not but if you used to go to dance clubs they'd play up the hop up music now that was 1954 talk what they call it sick music now or whatever they got that's sick or that's fire fire music I don't know I don't know I'm 42 I don't know a lingo and beat the bands and beat the drums and every kind of thing there was about it and women run out there half naked everything else and dance on the floors get you in the spirit of dance well you get in the spirit of it it's a spirit of the devil glad you said amen because it's the truth I just for Artie privacy by the Bible we don't need to read the Bible again there's other examples too so there's a good drums bad drums good dance bad dance I want the good stuff just give me the give me the good Lord and I know I'm gonna find it right here in your Bible praise God I'm gonna find a ride here I'm almost done now as I've danced and we've shouted we've played live music some people say oh that's too much well let me tell you what a prophet of God said he said I know there's a lot of fanaticism people carrying on I know sometimes they do it when the music's jumping up and down and everything I know that goes he says and I believe that too I've seen people in the day when as long as the music's playing everybody was jumping and screaming but when the music stopped they stopped now let me just pause right there that happens in most churches once the Music Stops people I mean we try to clap but most churches they just stop right because the music stopped there are special moments though when the Music Stops we start we keep worship and praise God so brother man is making the point some people just try to pump really loud the music but then the worship dies down after that Bill ramp said that's all right even if they do that he says but when they stop the music stops see that's still all right as far as I'm concerned as long as the people lives right see that's the balance of it we gotta live right you know I dance all over here I I leaped off of this I don't know if Steve's ever seen somebody leap off of Pulpit but he it might be the first time but you know tomorrow Steve I gotta go fight the devil Devil's going to come sometime tomorrow and try to tempt me I gotta defeat the Devil tomorrow just like I defeated him today I gotta keep living right if I don't live right I'm a hypocrite now we all sin so Devil Makes Us all feel like Hypocrites but when we repent we're no longer hypocrites I said I'm sorry and I'm asking God to change my life change my heart make me more dedicated to Christ Hallelujah your flesh will always be hypocrite but your soul will help you make up for that by repenting and saying God I want to overcome I mean how many Overcomers we got here all right praise God Amen let's stand to our feet
