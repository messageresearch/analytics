[44:50] for our musician by God's grace
[44:52] appreciate the invite and welcoming for
[44:58] the Jesse and his family we are just
[45:02] here to do the will of the Lord and if
[45:06] we would turn to two passes of scripture
[45:10] proverbs three and then we'll come from
[45:15] Matthew
[45:15] proverbs three and five six Matthew six
[45:20] nine through eleven preach this message
[45:28] at my church and I trust it will be a
[45:32] blessing to you all by God's grace this
[45:38] message was a powerful revelation to me
[45:41] it may be simple to you and maybe you
[45:44] have this revelation already but I like
[45:47] to share with you that a brother and I
[45:51] were just talking on the phone and we
[45:55] were dealing with the beginning of time
[45:57] what took place there and I saw
[46:03] something that I had never seen before
[46:05] and perhaps it will be God will give you
[46:10] what he gave me because it actually
[46:12] changed my life
[46:18] proverbs 3 through 5
[46:20] I'm sorry proverbs third chapter fifth
[46:24] verse trust in the Lord with all thine
[46:29] heart and lean not unto thine own
[46:33] understanding in all thy ways
[46:37] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[46:42] path Matthew 6:9 through 10
[46:54] after this manner therefore pray II our
[47:01] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[47:06] thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be
[47:11] done in earth as it is in heaven
[47:15] let us pray father we come before your
[47:19] Lord as humbly as we know how we thank
[47:21] you for your goodness we thank you for
[47:24] your grace and your mercy we pray father
[47:26] God that you would bless O God the
[47:29] service in a special way I pray that you
[47:32] will just open our hearts and
[47:35] understanding to what you would have us
[47:38] to see and to know and understand Lord
[47:41] we commit the service in your hand in
[47:44] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[47:47] you may be seated I wanted to do to deal
[47:54] with the will the will the will of man
[47:58] versus will of God
[48:05] when I was talking with my friend from
[48:08] South Carolina I was thinking about the
[48:13] way it must have been in heaven before
[48:19] Lucifer decided to think or to receive
[48:25] or to give thought to his own will
[48:30] before he allowed this darkness to come
[48:35] into him himself
[48:38] there was only one will respected and
[48:41] that was the will of the all-mighty God
[48:46] the angels at that point or before that
[48:49] time knew nothing other than the will of
[48:53] God I don't know how long a time that
[48:58] was but whatever God wanted is what they
[49:03] did there was no questioning to
[49:07] his authority there was no questioning
[49:10] to his word nor his will whatever he
[49:14] would require of them they did it heaven
[49:17] was unified heaven was beautiful and
[49:22] there was no Wars or any type of strife
[49:25] between the Angels and understand Amen
[49:30] that one thought one wheel that was
[49:35] contrary to God's will was found in
[49:41] Satan's heart according to Isaiah 14 the
[49:46] Bible tells us in the 13th verse for
[49:49] thou have said in thine heart I will
[49:52] ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[49:56] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[50:00] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[50:02] in the sides of the North I will ascend
[50:07] above the heights of the clouds I will
[50:10] be like the Most High God yet thou shalt
[50:14] be brought down to hell to the sides of
[50:18] the pit and we find out that it was so
[50:21] powerful that Lucifer had not even
[50:24] spoken the things that were in his heart
[50:29] so you understand that the word has
[50:33] always been the word and the word has
[50:35] always been a discerner God discerned
[50:39] what was in Lucifer's heart emptied the
[50:44] God discerned what was in his heart the
[50:47] Bible doesn't tell us how long it took
[50:49] Musha fer to spread his lie but however
[50:54] long it took him we understand that
[50:57] there was a third of heaven a harmony
[50:59] you know angels were deceived by his lie
[51:05] and his lie had to be somewhat on the
[51:12] same why's that
[51:14] he told Eve there was a
[51:18] life there's something greater than this
[51:23] and God is hiding it from you they had
[51:29] no idea that they were already in the
[51:31] perfect position that God had already
[51:34] intended them to be in but for some
[51:38] reason they fell to the lie of Satan
[51:42] Lucifer desire has always been to
[51:48] conquer God and to exalt himself above
[51:53] God and we find out that brother Branham
[51:58] said that even in this day here are what
[52:02] are they're speaking of Lucifer has
[52:04] achieved this is Satan's Eden he has
[52:09] exalted himself above the stars of God
[52:12] because remember all things are of God
[52:16] is that right and we realize Amen that
[52:20] the reason what makes us different is
[52:23] because we stood with God in the
[52:28] beginning when Lucifer was making his
[52:31] campaign in heaven brother Branham tells
[52:35] us that we stood with God then and
[52:37] because we stood with God then God
[52:40] stands with us now and you and I must
[52:43] understand by God's grace we stood
[52:49] because we loved his will we understood
[52:55] amen who he was in relationship to us in
[52:59] other words and then we we know by God's
[53:03] grace that there was no such thing as
[53:05] selfishness in heaven and to Lucifer
[53:11] exalted himself and selfishness is
[53:16] someone or some one who's devoted to or
[53:19] caring only for oneself concerned
[53:22] primarily with one's own interests
[53:27] benefits welfare etc
[53:31] regardless of others selfishness is not
[53:36] a great attribute to have and we find
[53:42] out that when people are selfish they
[53:45] seem to be blind to others needs and
[53:49] Lucifer could care less on the results
[53:52] of his selfishness even now he cares for
[53:57] no one but himself there is no love in
[54:00] him he cannot love
[54:03] so therefore everyone that serves him
[54:07] will serve him on the false pretense he
[54:13] could never love them but it is his
[54:17] whole thought is to be greater than God
[54:22] when we talk about will all of us have
[54:26] wheels God made us a free moral agent
[54:31] and God will never stop your will and I
[54:37] when I read the scripture there in in in
[54:40] Matthew where Jesus was praying I love
[54:43] that thought where he says not my will
[54:48] but thine be done see it takes us back
[54:53] to the beginning Lucifer followed his
[54:58] own will but you and I who were
[55:02] predestinated and our names were put in
[55:05] the Lamb's Book of Life we chose to
[55:08] follow God's will and because we follow
[55:11] God's will then we will follow his will
[55:15] now we look at these things and God God
[55:19] God I love the way God assures us
[55:23] because our salvation is not a hope so
[55:27] it is a no so and that's why Paul tells
[55:32] us make your calling and election sure I
[55:36] like that it is it is terrible to try to
[55:39] build upon hope feel something on hope
[55:43] because hope
[55:44] not really promising but when it comes
[55:49] to faith faith is a promise now we
[55:54] talked about we land and you know it's
[55:58] that part of us that is that
[56:00] consciousness that's conscience you know
[56:03] of our actions you know it's something
[56:05] that is a deliberate something we do
[56:08] deliberately it's something we process
[56:11] y'all know what I'm saying when there's
[56:13] an obstacle of when there is something
[56:15] um challenging before you you have to
[56:19] make a decision and your decision will
[56:22] be
[56:23] if wise will be a conscious decision and
[56:27] whatever that your will is to do you're
[56:30] going to do it
[56:31] whether it's good or bad alright that's
[56:37] what what happened to us when we ate off
[56:40] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[56:43] evil
[56:44] God gave us from that point on one
[56:47] choice is to make whether good or bad
[56:50] before then he says you'll be all right
[56:54] except the day that you eat of that tree
[56:58] that tree where you will allow your will
[57:03] to go against my will see Satan himself
[57:07] at that point in time was that tree he
[57:11] was that individual listened that was
[57:13] influenced and Eve and he began to talk
[57:17] with her amen and he allowed he began to
[57:20] build something in her so that she could
[57:22] see you got a will even though he told
[57:27] you don't either that tree you still can
[57:29] eat of it and surely you will not die
[57:34] but he didn't tell apart or to Eve that
[57:38] he was kicked out because of his will
[57:41] and you find out amen she fell for that
[57:45] and then she because she and then fell
[57:50] for his trick trickery she became the
[57:54] tree of death
[57:57] is that right those every man that's
[58:00] born of a woman what she'll surely die
[58:03] in other words we were born into death
[58:07] because of Eve and Adams failure to do I
[58:13] stay with the will of God and let me
[58:18] tell you something God will always place
[58:22] you in a position where you must make a
[58:25] choice we said what brother looks worthy
[58:33] where are you going with this I thought
[58:35] Lord every hardship basically that I
[58:38] have experienced in my life has been
[58:41] because of my own will I mean I mean as
[58:46] a Christian because we have the word and
[58:51] we know the word but yet he will not
[58:54] make us we still may have to make a
[58:59] choice every day what what we're going
[59:03] to do with it I'm so glad that Oh Lord
[59:08] I'm trying not to get too excited as I
[59:12] said Satan introduced selfishness and
[59:17] every time you make a sin it's because
[59:21] you are being selfish every time we
[59:25] falter what you mean brother was when
[59:29] you choose to do evil over good
[59:32] you don't just affect yourself you
[59:35] affect the whole body of Christ Oh
[59:37] somebody help me that's right he said Oh
[59:43] what do you mean let's just go to a
[59:45] Lillis tration we had a can it can was
[59:50] told don't say nothing kill everything
[59:55] and guess what he did he chose to hide a
[59:59] few inches and garments in his place and
[1:00:01] guess what over 3,000 I believe died
[1:00:03] because of his will because he
[1:00:09] chose to do wall or evil others died
[1:00:12] because of it
[1:00:14] brother Brown said even in a church if
[1:00:16] there's hidden sin in the church and
[1:00:19] then it will cause the church to die God
[1:00:24] is the saying he's the same yesterday
[1:00:26] today and forever hallelujah no other
[1:00:31] thoughts there was no other thoughts
[1:00:32] outside of God's thoughts there was no
[1:00:34] other works there you know God's worked
[1:00:37] amen except when Lucifer thought in his
[1:00:40] heart and then I will Excel I will be
[1:00:43] like the Most High God and remember in
[1:00:47] this last day the Bible said that he
[1:00:49] will be sitting on the throne acting and
[1:00:53] pretending like he is God now we're
[1:00:57] looking at the throne in in Rome but
[1:00:59] don't you understand that's not the
[1:01:01] throne God is talking about the real
[1:01:04] throne is your heart and right now in
[1:01:08] this day Lucifer is setting on the
[1:01:11] hearts of many people pretending to be
[1:01:13] the Holy Ghost right and that's why it's
[1:01:22] so important it meant to have the real
[1:01:25] pedigree Holy Ghost rah
[1:01:28] because the real Holy Ghost will always
[1:01:31] direct you back to the word it will
[1:01:35] never allow you to join up yourself with
[1:01:37] a creed or Dogma or some kind of
[1:01:40] authorization it'll never even cause you
[1:01:42] to turn your back on the Holy Ghost in
[1:01:44] an ever caused you to turn your back on
[1:01:47] the people of God we are not created for
[1:01:54] this worldly system this worldly system
[1:01:58] is contrary to the true believer there's
[1:02:03] nothing in this world we should love or
[1:02:05] desire it is it is it is vexing most of
[1:02:10] that time just to live in this place is
[1:02:13] that right
[1:02:14] I mean it's unless you're blind
[1:02:16] everything we see and then outside of
[1:02:19] this house amen
[1:02:21] is all contrary everything you gotta be
[1:02:25] really careful because Satan is a wise
[1:02:28] adversary hallelujah
[1:02:31] is that right he knows how to bring not
[1:02:35] only just a dish a distraction but he
[1:02:40] also knows how to grab you with an
[1:02:44] objection I'm getting the tongue twister
[1:02:47] but when you think about you so I would
[1:02:51] never do that I would never betray
[1:02:52] Christ
[1:02:53] oh I never will betray him there's no
[1:02:55] way think about it we don't know how
[1:02:58] long Lucifer were with was with God no
[1:03:05] doubt saw him face to face about says no
[1:03:07] man I've seen God but Lucifer was not so
[1:03:09] much a man he was an angel he was a
[1:03:11] chair of him he was a covering angel he
[1:03:14] saw things that perhaps we were not
[1:03:16] natural eyes could never see and yet he
[1:03:20] walked away from God hallelujah brother
[1:03:26] branham said he wasn't a son had he been
[1:03:31] a son he would have been a creator
[1:03:35] hallelujah and you must understand that
[1:03:38] God's grace amen that that's what makes
[1:03:41] us different our origin you can't go to
[1:03:49] heaven unless you came from heaven and
[1:03:54] if you came from Hell there's no way you
[1:03:57] can go to heaven you say brother what
[1:04:02] are you saying you and I ought to thank
[1:04:05] God for the seed that God placed in us
[1:04:08] before the foundation of the world it is
[1:04:13] the only thing that makes us different
[1:04:15] from the serpent is the seed God she
[1:04:21] placed in us why because we will to obey
[1:04:25] his will in the beginning I'm getting
[1:04:32] happy here you said what do you mean
[1:04:34] brother books DC because we have contact
[1:04:38] with God because we can feel in some
[1:04:40] time and because we've seen as
[1:04:42] miraculous does it make a seed hella
[1:04:47] millions came out of Egypt saw the signs
[1:04:51] and the wonders a man but don't you know
[1:04:55] millions were not of God
[1:04:58] you saw her brother mistake they they
[1:05:01] were the children of God only by flesh
[1:05:05] but when it came to the soul only two
[1:05:08] out of that generation were true seeds
[1:05:11] because I asked the Lord I said Lord how
[1:05:14] on earth Amen that you you destroyed all
[1:05:16] those the Lord loveth them that are
[1:05:20] hears and knoweth them that are his and
[1:05:21] he said that's true because they were
[1:05:24] the shock they were just the carriers of
[1:05:30] the seed forget it
[1:05:35] every type fits what was Pentecost many
[1:05:39] of them will just carry us of the seed
[1:05:44] come on somebody look at what we got now
[1:05:48] many of them were carriers of the seed
[1:05:51] brother Bayless say you wait to that
[1:05:53] spiritual bride come on the scene
[1:05:56] spiritual bride the only thing that
[1:05:58] makes the spiritual is the Holy Ghost
[1:06:01] what's that group of people that love
[1:06:04] the Holy Ghost hallelujah those who know
[1:06:09] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:06:11] forever those who know that he is their
[1:06:15] father I love that because Jesus said
[1:06:17] our Father when he said our that means
[1:06:23] he had other brothers and sisters
[1:06:24] somewhere hallelujah
[1:06:28] we'll come on somebody we were born of
[1:06:31] him and because we're born of him how
[1:06:35] can we not do his will though we be
[1:06:38] pressured don't we be tried as her
[1:06:40] brother was what are you saying watch
[1:06:41] Jesus he was our true example the
[1:06:45] I'm said in him he's with the word the
[1:06:47] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:06:49] him in the Bible said he took on the
[1:06:51] human flesh he humbled himself like a
[1:06:53] man he became a servant hallelujah even
[1:06:57] unto death that means with all the
[1:06:59] pressure of all the sins in the world
[1:07:02] and then laid upon his back he still had
[1:07:05] a battle he still had a choice and he
[1:07:09] could have said no I'm not going to do
[1:07:12] it
[1:07:13] hallelujah thank God he didn't
[1:07:16] hallelujah when it came down amen to the
[1:07:19] pressure and to his choosing he labored
[1:07:22] do you really think as a man as a
[1:07:25] fleshly man knowing what Kaveri was
[1:07:28] going to bring that he really wanted his
[1:07:30] fashion I don't want to do it father
[1:07:35] would you have this cup pass from me but
[1:07:42] nevertheless not my will
[1:07:44] oh I love it I love it because even so
[1:07:49] when you do the will of God it's not
[1:07:51] always a joyous thing it may bring you
[1:07:56] right down to your death right down to
[1:07:59] the chopping block hallelujah but at
[1:08:02] that time you must say Lord not my will
[1:08:05] but thine be done yo hear what I'm
[1:08:09] saying we want to do the will of God not
[1:08:12] what we think
[1:08:13] that's why brother Li got a quote but
[1:08:15] I'll just go ahead and preach it he said
[1:08:17] listen you and I must not just die but
[1:08:20] we must rock it took me a long while to
[1:08:22] understand that that means all of self
[1:08:26] must disappear all of self must
[1:08:31] disappear it must not just die because
[1:08:36] when you die you still got corpse but
[1:08:38] when it rots hallelujah is no longer
[1:08:41] identify has it the identity anymore
[1:08:46] identifiable it's no longer identifiable
[1:08:49] what it is and who it is and what was it
[1:08:53] in soul if it the longest dead and the
[1:08:56] long it rots sometimes
[1:08:58] left is a few ashes hallelujah and God
[1:09:04] wants a seat we can't be part super and
[1:09:08] part natural if I be understand what I
[1:09:11] mean when I say that I mean gods
[1:09:15] don't wanna rassle with your wheel
[1:09:19] you're supposed to be dead and a dead
[1:09:24] man has the wheel you can kick him you
[1:09:27] can stop them you can say whatever you
[1:09:29] want to him and he'll never ask you with
[1:09:31] you with the word you'll never see an
[1:09:34] expression on his face that he does not
[1:09:36] approve of what you're saying who help
[1:09:39] us Jesus hallelujah when your dad and
[1:09:43] when your rotted Amen you got an
[1:09:45] understanding man that God has you right
[1:09:47] where he wants you because now you did
[1:09:50] and he can live take powerful example
[1:09:54] Paul said is not I that live but Christ
[1:09:56] lives in me you know that's the kind of
[1:09:59] testimony I need I've got to have
[1:10:01] hallelujah why because Paul will say I
[1:10:05] have died to myself how many of you all
[1:10:08] he then would have been stoned
[1:10:11] hallelujah got up and the resurrection
[1:10:13] got up my goodness a man in Israel let
[1:10:16] me go preach some more oh hey man how
[1:10:20] many times did he do about two or three
[1:10:22] times
[1:10:22] Paul was resurrected he said I still got
[1:10:26] a job to do amen that was because Paul
[1:10:30] was dead to himself and all he wanted to
[1:10:33] do was the will of God the will of God
[1:10:36] will cause you to forsake mother father
[1:10:39] sister brother everybody but him it's
[1:10:43] your truth you think about those
[1:10:45] disciples they weren't because they were
[1:10:48] had been with him God said come follow
[1:10:50] me some quit their job immediately
[1:10:53] you understand me but when you know the
[1:10:57] will of God amen there is no processing
[1:11:04] is that right when you know the will of
[1:11:06] God you don't have to think about it you
[1:11:09] know it yeah somebody must know what I'm
[1:11:11] talking about
[1:11:13] when you know the will of God you just
[1:11:15] do it you don't even know how you know
[1:11:17] it you just know it you know why because
[1:11:21] my sheep heareth my voice oh I thought
[1:11:26] about priests that not long ago I said
[1:11:27] that voice will call you that voice will
[1:11:30] find you hallelujah that voice will
[1:11:34] expose you hallelujah
[1:11:37] ha because you belong to the voice is
[1:11:41] that right it made when Adam and Eve
[1:11:43] sinned and it's about said the voice of
[1:11:45] God walk to the cool of the evening huh
[1:11:49] what was that voice doing said Adam Adam
[1:11:52] where right now God knew what they were
[1:11:56] hallelujah but God wanted amen them to
[1:11:59] know and understand this voice is not
[1:12:03] only your God
[1:12:04] but this voice is your shelter this God
[1:12:08] is this voice is your Savior
[1:12:10] hallelujah this voice is your protector
[1:12:13] hallelujah
[1:12:14] this voice it meant that you heard all
[1:12:16] of these years I have along the time it
[1:12:19] was Amen is your Creator and the voice
[1:12:25] said it to Adam who told you you were
[1:12:29] naked that's one of those those serpents
[1:12:32] these scriptures who not what but who
[1:12:34] told you so we realize it man that voice
[1:12:38] is missing who toe he didn't say you
[1:12:40] weren't know you naked but who told you
[1:12:43] right and what God was trying to get out
[1:12:47] of them was that they could see what
[1:12:50] their will was how corrupt they had
[1:12:52] become because all Adam had to do is say
[1:12:57] Lord it's me I am guilty but because
[1:13:00] they had eaten off of the tree they
[1:13:02] didn't want to be exposed they didn't
[1:13:05] want the blame on them and they said
[1:13:07] that's woman you gave me and he at that
[1:13:13] moment in time
[1:13:14] God had sure was showing Adam amen the
[1:13:17] corruption of his heart way is hard now
[1:13:19] was standing
[1:13:24] when you are a tree the Bible said the
[1:13:27] real tree is a good tree you can't have
[1:13:28] building sweet coming out of the same
[1:13:30] fountain he said either make them found
[1:13:32] in sweet or bitter it has to be that way
[1:13:36] it can't be two kinds of water coming
[1:13:38] out of one fountain it must be one one
[1:13:43] must die in order for the other to live
[1:13:46] y'all hear what I'm saying I'm talking
[1:13:48] about see we're working with rapture
[1:13:50] material and the only way that we'll
[1:13:53] ever be wrapped to see because God is
[1:13:55] never going to ever have another Lucifer
[1:13:58] the time period of Lucifer is now and
[1:14:01] God is using Lucifer as a tuturro for us
[1:14:06] to train us to make us know the
[1:14:09] difference between good and evil
[1:14:11] hallelujah
[1:14:12] because after this there never be
[1:14:14] another day of evil y'all hear what I'm
[1:14:18] saying
[1:14:19] so you say what do you mean brother
[1:14:20] books I'm trying to tell you use your
[1:14:22] will check your wheel when it comes to
[1:14:26] anything and everything check your wheel
[1:14:29] is your wheel lining up with the will of
[1:14:33] God now the louia think about it if
[1:14:38] they're all Brotherhood's what are you
[1:14:39] saying
[1:14:39] I'm saying betrayal come because of your
[1:14:43] wheel when you betray trailers to be
[1:14:47] unfaithful or in guarding or maintaining
[1:14:49] or fulfilling to betray trusts right but
[1:14:54] it is to disappoint the hopes or
[1:14:56] expectations are right in other words if
[1:15:00] you law you if you have a law your
[1:15:01] friend you don't want to betray that
[1:15:03] friend by your will to reveal or
[1:15:07] disclose in violation of confidence
[1:15:09] you've told someone something and you
[1:15:12] just got to tell it right
[1:15:15] he's just got to tell it but you know
[1:15:18] not to tell it but your will says though
[1:15:21] I got to tell it that's betrayal
[1:15:24] Alleluia and you've done that not
[1:15:27] because the devil made you do it you did
[1:15:29] because you will to do it
[1:15:33] hello some honey and man is that right
[1:15:35] brother branham said your greatest enemy
[1:15:38] is not the devil as you you're the enemy
[1:15:42] I might be his enemy why because I have
[1:15:45] a will I love it when Jesus was about to
[1:15:53] go into Calvary of finished uh go to the
[1:15:58] cross and and he says father not my will
[1:16:00] but thine be done that we look at that
[1:16:02] like that was so light to say but the
[1:16:05] whole sin is sin in a work you know what
[1:16:07] I'm saying
[1:16:07] whip wood cattails according to history
[1:16:09] and plugs are flesh being pulled out of
[1:16:12] human you know all those things and
[1:16:15] people spit in your face and slapping
[1:16:16] you and everything else y'all know what
[1:16:18] I'm saying you said what do you mean
[1:16:20] even when the Holy Ghost tells you go
[1:16:22] talk to somebody about Jesus you got a
[1:16:24] battle between God's will and your will
[1:16:28] is that right oh I don't want them to
[1:16:31] hurt my feelings you see that
[1:16:33] selfishness when God has suffered all
[1:16:36] the pain of your sins and you can't even
[1:16:40] suffer a little bit of pain because
[1:16:43] you're talking about him his will versus
[1:16:47] your wheel are we staying in his will
[1:16:49] Oh Lord I was telling my son one of my
[1:16:52] son's I said you got to understand I
[1:16:54] said even if you're not living it you
[1:16:56] need to tell those who you say you're
[1:16:58] your friend you need to tell them the
[1:17:00] truth
[1:17:02] what if they died on you and you know
[1:17:05] you knew the truth but you didn't tell
[1:17:08] them because your wheel didn't want you
[1:17:10] to have your feelings hurt you didn't
[1:17:14] want to be rejected even though he was
[1:17:16] rejected you see what I'm saying but we
[1:17:20] say we in cars but we don't act like
[1:17:22] Christ when it comes to certain things
[1:17:24] that's contrary to our will that is why
[1:17:28] your will must die
[1:17:31] this is why you must die this is why you
[1:17:34] may rock because I'm gonna tell you
[1:17:35] something that influence that that that
[1:17:38] pride that comes with your will was
[1:17:40] given to you at birth
[1:17:44] yeah
[1:17:45] he was lifted up Satan was huh pride was
[1:17:50] found in him he didn't want to be a
[1:17:53] servant no more and that's the way it is
[1:17:55] even in charge like I tell people I said
[1:17:57] what is it that you don't want to
[1:17:59] worship God what is it you don't want to
[1:18:02] clap your hand what is it that you want
[1:18:04] to raise your voice what is it that
[1:18:05] you're afraid to dance in the spirit
[1:18:07] hallelujah is your will it ain't gods
[1:18:11] where the Bible said that's what we
[1:18:13] supposed to be doing
[1:18:15] Bob says rejoice always and again I say
[1:18:18] rejoice is your will
[1:18:22] here's what I'm not emotional that's
[1:18:24] Allah everybody's emotional if you're
[1:18:28] not emotional you're dead ooh I
[1:18:34] guarantee you I came in and slap your
[1:18:36] face you get emotional if you're not
[1:18:39] dead I can expect a response right
[1:18:42] [Laughter]
[1:18:46] because I would never do such a thing as
[1:18:48] that but my point is people said I'm not
[1:18:51] emotional like I had that supposed to
[1:18:55] tell me I'm not emotional in one day I
[1:18:57] called her first father bought a brand
[1:18:59] new ride lawnmower she didn't even know
[1:19:02] I was at the house and she loved to cut
[1:19:04] the grass and she was out there
[1:19:05] screaming holla I just looked at her
[1:19:08] like hmm I got you now did I preach it
[1:19:15] yeah I preached I didn't call her name
[1:19:19] but I preached it well I mean it is the
[1:19:23] devil that makes you think you're not
[1:19:25] emotional when it comes to God what it
[1:19:28] is people are ashamed that's the truth
[1:19:31] of it you're a shame because you don't
[1:19:33] know how he gonna make you act come on
[1:19:38] somebody is the truth and we don't even
[1:19:41] understand that when we sit down on God
[1:19:43] we're betraying him you're not gonna
[1:19:46] find the devil worship was out there
[1:19:48] sitting down on God you ever seen those
[1:19:50] constructs
[1:19:51] oh they dance be sure but they don't
[1:19:53] dance they dance in the spirit it ain't
[1:19:56] in God's Spirit but they in this
[1:19:57] right there is the devil spirit and they
[1:20:00] do it they dance they do whatever the
[1:20:02] devil say do if the devil say step turn
[1:20:04] on your head and everything else he'll
[1:20:06] do it we get in the church and we all
[1:20:09] pious hmm oh you don't need all of that
[1:20:16] no you don't you really don't but I
[1:20:20] think if people understood how good a
[1:20:21] person felt but when they danced in the
[1:20:23] spirit everybody be out in the floor
[1:20:28] yeah it's the truth you know people's
[1:20:31] well I don't believe they're about that
[1:20:33] there's no everybody don't because in
[1:20:35] their natural selves there are those
[1:20:37] like I said in their natural selves this
[1:20:40] is what God did God took a staunch group
[1:20:43] of Jews put him up in the upper room
[1:20:47] fill him with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:20:50] were running down the street screaming
[1:20:52] he's alive he's alive
[1:20:54] is that what brother him said oh yes the
[1:20:57] truth he said they were jumping out of
[1:20:59] windows laughs that ain't the whole egos
[1:21:04] I don't know what it is and how long
[1:21:07] it's been since you have seen the Holy
[1:21:09] Ghost break a heart and somebody's
[1:21:12] crying we've gotten so into a place in
[1:21:16] man that we allow I will do you feel
[1:21:18] they're not that come you want to cry
[1:21:19] but you're saying because you're afraid
[1:21:22] of what somebody else may say oh you
[1:21:23] might draw attention hallelujah all I
[1:21:26] know is my God said put your light upon
[1:21:29] us cat somewhere it could be seen don't
[1:21:33] hide it under a bushel I don't make had
[1:21:36] you don't hide your experience on the
[1:21:38] religion but this is not how the message
[1:21:42] people worship what misses people you're
[1:21:49] not a part of the message until Christ
[1:21:51] is in you is that right you're a real
[1:21:55] believer you go all the way to the Holy
[1:21:57] Ghost all the way no matter what it
[1:22:01] takes you go all the way is this okay
[1:22:05] but I'll never betray them look at Judas
[1:22:08] Judas wint was hit three and a half
[1:22:11] years face-to-face talk with him aid at
[1:22:14] the table and everything else as soon as
[1:22:16] that time came for him to betray him he
[1:22:18] did it why it was the seed that was in
[1:22:21] him he was the son of perdition
[1:22:24] hallelujah
[1:22:26] oh come on somebody I shall thank God
[1:22:29] for this message because this message
[1:22:32] uncovers this message tells us it shows
[1:22:37] us exactly where we are y'all hear what
[1:22:40] I'm saying
[1:22:40] you can't fake it in here because the
[1:22:43] Word of God will surely excellence' not
[1:22:46] just you me too I realized Amen I'm
[1:22:49] laying naked before God I'm open before
[1:22:51] God you know when I get to pray and then
[1:22:56] I don't know what I must say this I'm
[1:22:57] I'm I'm on the experience but you know
[1:23:00] you know in that old denominational
[1:23:03] Church we should say Lord forgive me of
[1:23:05] my known and unknown sins are you
[1:23:08] talking about if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:23:12] you know your sins not only God told you
[1:23:16] before you did it don't do it right it's
[1:23:21] a truth that's what mine that's what
[1:23:23] haha right but your will overrides it
[1:23:28] now I was telling the brothers church I
[1:23:31] say y'all notice the truth the devil say
[1:23:33] do it do it and then as soon as you do
[1:23:36] it he say you so stupid and look what
[1:23:41] you gotta do yeah you gotta make it
[1:23:43] right now now you say all Brotherhood's
[1:23:50] what are you saying think about it and
[1:23:52] all of that anointing I'm gonna show you
[1:23:54] how your will can just creep up on you
[1:23:56] and you don't even know that you deceive
[1:23:57] or you don't even know that you out of
[1:23:59] the will of God take a take for an
[1:24:01] example Ananias and Sapphira and then
[1:24:04] they saw their goods for whatever money
[1:24:07] they showed it right it was theirs they
[1:24:10] didn't even have to give it to God they
[1:24:13] had the charge to keep it or to give it
[1:24:15] and the devil said you know that's too
[1:24:17] much money to be putting in church
[1:24:20] that's too much money at least take some
[1:24:23] of it and just tell them this is what
[1:24:25] you pay for it so this is what you give
[1:24:27] it it to the reason to the reasoning it
[1:24:32] may have seemed logical but it was of
[1:24:36] the devil because it was just that much
[1:24:39] off of the truth y'all hear them say and
[1:24:43] their will did what caused them to die
[1:24:48] because they created a lie walk in the
[1:24:53] lie and got caught in the line so what
[1:24:58] I'm saying is that's just your real God
[1:25:01] don't mandate things on you sometimes we
[1:25:04] we let me tell you something God did not
[1:25:08] make this salvation how can I say it
[1:25:12] long this is the message of grace you
[1:25:18] make it long like Israel made it long
[1:25:22] y'all hear them saying because I believe
[1:25:25] if a person get the Holy Ghost a lot of
[1:25:28] the things that being taught in the
[1:25:29] church would not even be necessary
[1:25:32] because the Holy Ghost will lead you and
[1:25:34] guide you into all truth is that right
[1:25:37] it is the truth but we are making a law
[1:25:40] Amen we don't have the Holy Ghost we
[1:25:42] don't have a revelation of what we need
[1:25:44] to do and then we're fashion ourselves
[1:25:46] pretending to be something god never
[1:25:48] asks you to pretend God told you to get
[1:25:51] born again cuz once you born again you
[1:25:55] don't have to pretend to be part of
[1:25:57] everybody else but we'll do that because
[1:26:00] we don't want everybody to look at us
[1:26:02] and judge us is your will again and
[1:26:06] don't put that on God y'all hear what
[1:26:10] I'm saying you look at this thing you
[1:26:13] said oh Jesus said you got to recognize
[1:26:15] something who are you and where did you
[1:26:17] come from and I always tell people there
[1:26:20] is no way I came from hell
[1:26:24] I
[1:26:27] things about God when I was a child
[1:26:30] didn't even know him
[1:26:32] and God was on my mind nobody told me
[1:26:36] that God was one I went to a Baptist
[1:26:38] Church and I knew that God was one my
[1:26:43] first time here in a woman preach I knew
[1:26:46] it was wrong
[1:26:47] nobody told me that but election
[1:26:52] something on the inside of me made me
[1:26:55] know that certain things were not right
[1:26:57] even before I came to God I was able to
[1:27:00] see what was right and what was wrong
[1:27:02] some of those things y'all understand me
[1:27:05] I was not one and maybe you say well
[1:27:08] what do you mean why are you saying this
[1:27:09] listen the Bible said in John eight and
[1:27:12] I'm gonna move on 23 to 24 he said unto
[1:27:14] them ye are from beneath high and from
[1:27:16] above here of the world I am NOT up this
[1:27:18] world see when you not of this world you
[1:27:21] cannot love the things of the world you
[1:27:25] can't you can't love the things of the
[1:27:28] world when you're not of this world once
[1:27:30] you are born again truly born again the
[1:27:33] world is way off somewhere somewhere
[1:27:36] somewhere from you hey man you're not
[1:27:38] even thinking about it
[1:27:41] love not the things that were why
[1:27:43] because you've been born from a
[1:27:45] different city you've been born from a
[1:27:47] different place hallelujah right is that
[1:27:51] the word brother branham said if you was
[1:27:53] a pig how you going to condemn a pig for
[1:27:56] being a pig P go like pig things right
[1:28:01] he said a sinner a sinner is a sinner
[1:28:04] he's not condemned because he's a sinner
[1:28:06] he's a pig but when you're born again
[1:28:09] and you claim to be a Christian now he
[1:28:12] said the Christian can say hmmm the
[1:28:18] Christian can send a minute when we do
[1:28:21] and then we do we don't worry about it
[1:28:23] because we have an advocate we've got a
[1:28:25] solution to our problems but I don't
[1:28:27] believe a sin uh-uh when a sinner when a
[1:28:31] Christian sin or come short and I know
[1:28:33] the reality of it is once you truly get
[1:28:37] the seal of God you cannot sin
[1:28:43] we know that but what i'm saying i'm
[1:28:46] working with actions now those things
[1:28:48] that calls us to say Lord forgive me you
[1:28:52] see what I'm saying
[1:28:53] she you and I we is our precept this
[1:28:56] evening the lord tirion assurance but my
[1:28:58] thing is I was telling somebody I was
[1:29:00] telling his brother Jesse I said you
[1:29:01] know what I don't worry about making no
[1:29:03] rapture this message guaranteed me to
[1:29:07] rapture when I got the Holy Ghost when
[1:29:11] God gave me the Holy Ghost signed sealed
[1:29:13] and delivered
[1:29:14] already sitting in heavenly places in
[1:29:19] Christ Jesus
[1:29:19] Oh Lord you think when you think your
[1:29:22] righteousness gonna get you to heaven oh
[1:29:24] if I just did right if I just do right
[1:29:28] you can't live right and you can't do
[1:29:30] right without God on the inside
[1:29:32] hallelujah
[1:29:33] and none of us shall make 100 until
[1:29:36] Jesus say it's a hundred you understand
[1:29:39] me it's accounted to us as a hundred
[1:29:44] it's given to us as a hundred if you
[1:29:47] want to say it like that ah
[1:29:49] because Jesus Christ is the only man
[1:29:51] that made the hundred he was the only
[1:29:54] perfect man let me let me say it like
[1:29:57] this you know these things but listen
[1:29:59] there is no holy mountain unless the
[1:30:01] Holy Ghost is on the mountain there's no
[1:30:04] holy water unless God is in the water
[1:30:06] there's no holy man unless God is in the
[1:30:09] man it ain't you it's a holy God that
[1:30:12] makes you holy that's why he said be
[1:30:15] holy for I am holy the Lord you
[1:30:18] cannot be holy not on your own
[1:30:21] not in self righteousness whoo and
[1:30:26] that's why the people will uh I don't
[1:30:29] know whether I won't this holy goes I
[1:30:31] like I try to tell people this you don't
[1:30:36] know
[1:30:36] how good this Apple tastes until you
[1:30:38] bite it if I got Apple in my hand and
[1:30:41] I'm crunching it and you could smell it
[1:30:43] oh and it smells so good and you can
[1:30:45] almost taste its flavors from the scent
[1:30:49] but you'll never know how good it is
[1:30:51] until you bite into it
[1:30:52] that's how it is with God you don't know
[1:30:57] how good it is I I was when I was a boy
[1:30:59] actually see the holy goes to church
[1:31:00] people like that I used to be afraid of
[1:31:03] it because it looked like it hurt
[1:31:05] oh my god well when I got it myself
[1:31:11] oh it jerked me wherever it wanted to
[1:31:15] jerking it was there every time it judge
[1:31:17] me it was really good
[1:31:18] now it doesn't have to jerk everybody
[1:31:21] everybody don't jerk don't get me wrong
[1:31:22] I'm not trying to put who's the doctrine
[1:31:24] of jerking but my point is the joy of
[1:31:31] the Lord so feels your fibers of your
[1:31:33] being to your body sometimes don't even
[1:31:35] know how to react have you ever had you
[1:31:39] know you're just thinking about the Lord
[1:31:41] Jesus and all of a sudden the hallelujah
[1:31:42] come out of your mouth you use somewhere
[1:31:45] else and you're not even Church all over
[1:31:47] hallelujah you know you think about it
[1:31:49] praise the Lord it is because that joy
[1:31:55] is only inside there's a tabernacle that
[1:31:57] you are the tabernacle there's a worship
[1:31:59] going on all the time the greatest way
[1:32:02] you can worship God is to fulfill his
[1:32:04] will is that okay see my kingdom jesus
[1:32:11] said is not of this world if his kingdom
[1:32:13] is not of this world
[1:32:14] neither is mine neither is yours is that
[1:32:17] right
[1:32:17] he said if my kingdom were of this world
[1:32:19] then would my servants fight that I
[1:32:22] should not be delivered to the Jews but
[1:32:24] now is my kingdom not from hence Pilate
[1:32:27] said unto them o thou a king then
[1:32:29] hallelujah I like that I'm I asked you a
[1:32:32] question are you a king absolutely the
[1:32:37] Bible said when we come into Christ he
[1:32:39] has made us both kings and priests Oh
[1:32:42] sister said well I can't be a king
[1:32:44] because I'm a female well I can't be a
[1:32:47] queen because I'm
[1:32:50] y'all didn't get it I'm calling myself
[1:32:55] bride but I'm a man if I can call myself
[1:32:59] bride you can call yourself King ah
[1:33:03] because you must understand it is the
[1:33:06] king that's in you that makes you a king
[1:33:09] oh we must we must we must be selfless
[1:33:21] we must become self less and you said
[1:33:26] what brother Brooks and that's what I've
[1:33:28] been asking the Lord to help me help me
[1:33:32] become selfless and sometimes we do that
[1:33:38] even in our texting sometimes people may
[1:33:41] say or do something something and then
[1:33:43] all of a sudden that will of yours jump
[1:33:47] up and you're gonna text this and then
[1:33:49] the Holy Ghost says uh-uh
[1:33:51] don't do that then you go erase erase
[1:33:54] erase erase erase and then you might say
[1:33:57] a few words of kindness who did that
[1:34:01] that cop that's God that's God you just
[1:34:06] denied your will that God's will be done
[1:34:10] and because God's will be done you have
[1:34:12] kept peace because you know the text
[1:34:15] would have brought war you denied
[1:34:19] yourself even if you felt like you were
[1:34:21] right you still denied yourself is that
[1:34:26] okay we lost you so what do you mean
[1:34:29] brother and said eternal life is living
[1:34:31] for others you've got to come to that
[1:34:35] place I don't feel like doing it do it
[1:34:40] anyhow I don't want to do it do it
[1:34:44] anyhow why because the Bible said do
[1:34:48] unto others as you would have them do
[1:34:50] unto you you do not know the needs of
[1:34:52] other people but if God has placed you
[1:34:55] in a position to help and satisfy their
[1:34:57] needs that's what you're supposed to do
[1:35:00] whether you like it or not
[1:35:04] how many y'all know Jesus as a friend
[1:35:08] you may have heard me say that I said
[1:35:10] many people know him as Lord
[1:35:12] a lot of him know him as a Savior but
[1:35:15] only a few people have come to know that
[1:35:16] he's a friend and the Bible said friends
[1:35:19] I sticks closer than a brother that's
[1:35:22] what we all need hallelujah in this day
[1:35:25] and time we know your master Savior we
[1:35:27] know him as our Lord but we need him as
[1:35:29] a friend you know what a friend will do
[1:35:31] listen to all your problems and keep it
[1:35:34] a friend would be able to tell you and
[1:35:37] advise you in a healthy way
[1:35:40] is that right a friend would cop with
[1:35:44] you even when they know you're wrong one
[1:35:50] time my friend down in South Carolina
[1:35:52] we've been friends ever since third
[1:35:53] grade and he said just something to me
[1:35:55] on the phone and offended me and I said
[1:35:58] man you offended me he said I can't
[1:35:59] offend you I couldn't help but laugh
[1:36:06] because I was really trying to pretend
[1:36:08] that I was upset because I knew I would
[1:36:15] have offended me but because he's a
[1:36:17] friend right he could not oh Lord mercy
[1:36:22] I had a laugh about that he did too
[1:36:25] God is good to us and that's the kind of
[1:36:29] God we serve with the conch God we're
[1:36:33] serving a lord who didn't decide to love
[1:36:36] us when we were born but loved us before
[1:36:38] we were even on the earth
[1:36:40] God amen loved her so much he put our
[1:36:44] names in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:36:46] the foundation of the world God even
[1:36:50] when we were sinners about said in that
[1:36:51] Bob we're here same as he died for us so
[1:36:53] you gotta understand he claimed us right
[1:36:58] and he saw us and knew us and protected
[1:37:01] us even when we didn't even know him
[1:37:03] that was his will now if God protected
[1:37:08] us why we were sinners what is he going
[1:37:10] to do while we're Saints
[1:37:12] y'all hear me God but you gotta
[1:37:15] understand that things that we do go
[1:37:18] through it is the will of God he said I
[1:37:21] can't believe it if you know well you
[1:37:26] know I a friend of mine who lost his
[1:37:29] spouse I said brother God would put you
[1:37:33] to the test you say I love God then you
[1:37:39] must come to say I also love his will
[1:37:43] whatever he decides whatever his
[1:37:47] decisions are for me they're correct
[1:37:50] they're right y'all understand me when I
[1:37:54] came to the Lord when I came to the Lord
[1:37:56] my whole family for sickening people who
[1:37:59] I loved my friends first took me people
[1:38:01] who I love but God chose that for that
[1:38:05] to be hmm and you said what what don't
[1:38:10] get married with God cuz he's now saving
[1:38:12] you because you said you wanted to be
[1:38:13] saved he is his job to serve as a son to
[1:38:17] separate the light from the darkness and
[1:38:21] you said what brother was what he said
[1:38:22] let me tell you something you said well
[1:38:23] God I want to be just like you well when
[1:38:26] you say that you giving your life to God
[1:38:28] to mold and make you in there and every
[1:38:31] way he can to be just like him hello
[1:38:35] he's the Potter and you weren't the clay
[1:38:38] you know you'll never see that you know
[1:38:41] the thing is when you see that clay
[1:38:42] getting kind of stiff and hard what does
[1:38:45] he do he add more water to it and what
[1:38:48] pressure so when you reject God's will
[1:38:52] and you began to get hard on him I said
[1:38:54] I just remember what you told me you
[1:38:57] said you want to be like me and I'm
[1:38:59] molding you I'm in control here we don't
[1:39:05] like it when we're not in control it
[1:39:08] hurts when we're not in control come on
[1:39:10] somebody I know this is elementary but I
[1:39:12] want you to understand there's a
[1:39:13] revelation behind what I'm trying to get
[1:39:15] over it is your will your will that's
[1:39:19] hindering you you hinder you
[1:39:21] it ain't God that hinders you you hinder
[1:39:24] you and when
[1:39:26] fail to follow through with the will of
[1:39:28] God you're looking for trouble if not
[1:39:31] death
[1:39:38] you sure Oh what about a prophet you
[1:39:41] don't look like the Prophet had perfect
[1:39:43] lives no they didn't Nathan said under
[1:39:47] David Nathan said all David do what's in
[1:39:49] your heart a prophet could never be
[1:39:52] wrong but out of his mouth said David go
[1:39:56] do whatever in your heart and God called
[1:40:00] Nathan on the side says no David is not
[1:40:04] going to build this temple now I want
[1:40:07] you to go back and tell David what it
[1:40:11] had to be humiliating it was a humbling
[1:40:15] experience for Nathan he had to go back
[1:40:17] said David I was wrong
[1:40:18] the Lord corrected me you're not going
[1:40:23] to build a house but Solomon's gonna
[1:40:25] build it you say ain't nothing to that

[1:40:31] got it and you may not have it but there
[1:40:34] are times pride will anoint you to keep
[1:40:38] you from doing the will of God because
[1:40:41] it's gonna humiliate you you don't want
[1:40:43] people to see that you have a need and
[1:40:45] you don't want people to know that you
[1:40:47] having me that's nonsense
[1:40:51] one of my sons are going through
[1:40:53] something right now I said what you need
[1:40:55] to do is ask God to help you kill and
[1:40:57] destroy that pride that you got once you

[1:42:42] right mind but I am only because of the
[1:42:45] grace of God some things I can look back
[1:42:49] and laugh at but while I was going
[1:42:50] through it was not funny
[1:42:51] Jana Stephanie hey Jeremiah I want you

[1:43:16] and you must be crazy attitude but he
[1:43:22] had to preach it's hard on the preacher

[1:43:30] struggle brother brown said if you don't
[1:43:33] say Amen I feel funny
[1:43:34] right remember the man said what they be
[1:43:37] saying evening and doing all that
[1:43:38] screaming brother and said if they
[1:43:40] wouldn't you sure what do you mean Oh
[1:43:44] real birth and this is what God has
[1:43:46] shown me this is what I love about this
[1:43:47] thing about this message I could have
[1:43:51] been deceived
[1:43:53] oh when I was in the Apostolic Church I
[1:43:55] seen God create things in the Apostolic
[1:43:58] Church I saw God and I knew nothing
[1:44:00] about this message I had a need and he
[1:44:03] supplied it that's all I knew it wasn't
[1:44:06] I commanded the thing I just said lord I
[1:44:08] need this
[1:44:09] and God produced it I had a witness the
[1:44:11] witness she's going on now but she's
[1:44:13] standing right there when that thing all
[1:44:15] of a sudden appeared you don't have to
[1:44:17] believe it I'm just telling you I've
[1:44:19] seen the pillar of fire the pillar of
[1:44:21] cloud I've seen all kinds of things
[1:44:22] people Eurasian no pillar of fire I've
[1:44:25] seen the purified and people try to tell
[1:44:29] you didn't see it but because I saw the
[1:44:32] pillar fire doesn't save me millions of
[1:44:34] people saw the pillar fire look at all
[1:44:36] the people that follow brilliant Brandon
[1:44:38] who saw the field of fire where are they
[1:44:40] today it's the word birth the birth that
[1:44:44] makes you love this that's what makes
[1:44:52] you different brother ever said it like
[1:44:54] this amen and conferences he said birth
[1:44:58] is a mess
[1:44:59] it'll make you do things you didn't
[1:45:01] think you'll do but out of that death
[1:45:04] and corruption comes forth life no she
[1:45:08] can bring forth its life until it's dead
[1:45:11] and right and out of that rotten mess
[1:45:15] when there's nothing else left to rot it
[1:45:17] it's only the life that lives when the
[1:45:21] Sun comes to God he is given tests Oh
[1:45:26] Lord
[1:45:27] you should what do you mean I came home
[1:45:29] one day speaking in tongues and the
[1:45:31] people got scared and laughed at me when
[1:45:34] I was telling cost to you no that was
[1:45:36] that was the thing then but I want to
[1:45:42] tell you something I didn't have the
[1:45:44] word but if one thing for certain got an
[1:45:46] or thing kept me now I don't know what
[1:45:50] people you didn't get the Holy Ghost
[1:45:51] till you came to this message I beg your
[1:45:53] pardon and that means brother Branham
[1:45:55] didn't get the only goes until the
[1:45:56] message came he was in a Baptist Church
[1:46:00] among the Pentecostal people y'all hear
[1:46:04] no same
[1:46:06] the fullness of the world reveal more to
[1:46:09] me but my breath didn't come by way of a
[1:46:12] church or building my birth came by
[1:46:15] Christ into a well-bred brother boys you
[1:46:19] don't know how can you prove that
[1:46:20] Scripture
[1:46:21] the Bible says and even brother man said
[1:46:23] Philip was translated into the
[1:46:26] wilderness into the desert that that you
[1:46:31] not wasn't part of the group you ever
[1:46:36] thought about where that little that
[1:46:37] water came from they were in the desert
[1:46:40] all of a sudden all of a sudden they
[1:46:43] come up on their asses it's the same it
[1:46:48] came from the same place - Ram came from
[1:46:50] hallelujah of Abraham where did it come
[1:46:52] from it wasn't even the habitation of a
[1:46:54] ram to be in the top of a mountain
[1:46:57] hallelujah come on somebody
[1:46:59] you saw what do you mean what I'm trying
[1:47:01] to say and I don't mean to be so long
[1:47:02] I'm almost done when we trusted the Lord
[1:47:05] with all our hearts
[1:47:08] it will stop the murmuring and
[1:47:11] complaining why should you learn and
[1:47:16] complain if you trust God you say I love
[1:47:18] him but I tell you what this was going
[1:47:20] when I'm going through I don't know why
[1:47:22] I'm going through this and you know what
[1:47:24] I feel like this and all of us deserve
[1:47:27] hell we ought to be grateful that God
[1:47:30] has chosen us amen in him come home
[1:47:36] how many listen if we were under the law
[1:47:38] all of us would be dead long time ago
[1:47:42] but God rich and mercy and all God is
[1:47:47] asking for this little bride to do is
[1:47:49] line herself up in his will that's it do
[1:47:55] you deny yourself is that what Jesus
[1:47:58] said you must deny yourself to follow me
[1:48:03] mm-hmm God itself is that right I'm
[1:48:06] almost done died of self because
[1:48:08] remember Amen you think about a more by
[1:48:11] touch talking about Ruth now Ruth was a
[1:48:13] more - the law was against her her
[1:48:15] people was against her Israel was
[1:48:17] against her
[1:48:18] everybody was against Ruth
[1:48:20] right and here was Ruth caught a
[1:48:23] revelation that the god of Naomi was God
[1:48:27] she denied herself whatever her
[1:48:30] occupation was if she was a priestess if
[1:48:33] she was whatever she wasn't near Moab
[1:48:35] she denied it she did not her loved ones
[1:48:39] she didn't hide her origin when she said
[1:48:44] your God will be my god and your people
[1:48:46] be my God my people she denied her
[1:48:49] origin she denied everything about
[1:48:52] herself and she said wherever you live
[1:48:55] Ruth or Naomi when you die will die
[1:48:58] wherever you lie on the line you
[1:49:00] understand me your God will be my god
[1:49:02] and she that's what God requires from us
[1:49:06] and I find out that people you know they
[1:49:08] get to the place they honor their
[1:49:10] natural families more so than their
[1:49:12] spiritual and I don't think that's right
[1:49:14] it's not right is that right because
[1:49:17] when you're born into gods family
[1:49:19] there's a Lord Jesus your mother your
[1:49:21] mama they're waiting on you like she's
[1:49:24] gonna get some special privilege garden
[1:49:27] given those special privilege say who is
[1:49:29] my mother and my father my brother my
[1:49:31] sister who is but them that follow the
[1:49:36] father's will those who do my father's
[1:49:37] will right it's doing his will
[1:49:40] dying to yoga though I wish I can show
[1:49:43] you the way God has shown me a minute
[1:49:46] opened up something I can't even explain
[1:49:48] it all I know is that God from that
[1:49:50] point on has been giving me grace to
[1:49:52] check every motive that right in the
[1:50:02] message of unveiling God brother brother
[1:50:04] BAM said your people is my people
[1:50:05] working with Ruth your God is my God
[1:50:07] where you die I die where you buried
[1:50:10] I'll be buried I won't die to self so
[1:50:12] greatly until I am a new person in
[1:50:15] Christ Jesus see what he said I want to
[1:50:18] die to self and that's what Ruth did she
[1:50:21] died to self when she left everything
[1:50:23] behind she died to self and was willing
[1:50:26] to take the persecution from those she
[1:50:31] knew would person
[1:50:35] cuz the Jews hated Moabites right and
[1:50:39] there was a law don't have nothing to do
[1:50:42] with them
[1:50:42] oh come on somebody you know that's how
[1:50:45] it is oh you don't became one of them
[1:50:48] brother Mike you don't became one of
[1:50:49] them folks don't have men to do with
[1:50:51] those folks oh I can go
[1:50:52] you could go to any Church but you don't
[1:50:54] go to that kind oh I can't help myself
[1:50:59] hallelujah that's the thing that's
[1:51:02] called me hallelujah I am Who I am
[1:51:07] hallelujah oh my the first thing I want
[1:51:10] to say is Jesus never live for himself
[1:51:13] his life was spent for others that's
[1:51:16] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[1:51:18] go to church and you do good things
[1:51:20] that's fine
[1:51:21] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:51:23] you haven't eternal life eternal life is
[1:51:26] living for others it proves it when I
[1:51:28] come in the Lamb of God he lived in and
[1:51:32] had eternal life because he did not live
[1:51:35] for himself he lived for others and you
[1:51:37] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:51:40] day and you don't live for yourself no
[1:51:42] law you live for others mmm someone said
[1:51:46] how can you stand let anybody call you
[1:51:49] such bad names you don't live for
[1:51:52] yourself you live for others that you
[1:51:54] might redeem that man you become sons
[1:51:57] and the trouble of it is the church has
[1:51:59] forgotten forgotten that they were sons
[1:52:01] your son you're taking Christ place
[1:52:04] you're a son so don't live for yourself
[1:52:07] live for us well brother branham I can
[1:52:12] live for this brother but because he
[1:52:14] sure was a nice man he said that's not
[1:52:16] it live for that man who hates you live
[1:52:19] for that person who would kill you if
[1:52:21] they could that's what they've done to
[1:52:23] him they killed him and he died that he
[1:52:27] might save them that's eternal life when
[1:52:30] you that's in your bosom your face
[1:52:33] facing heaven then but you sacrifice
[1:52:35] your own things give them up like the
[1:52:38] Sheep gives up his wool you look on to
[1:52:40] our Calvary
[1:52:41] I hope this helped you to get in the
[1:52:44] place that's what the Taverner see
[1:52:46] that's what the people has
[1:52:47] got to do is find out where what you are
[1:52:50] and what's your purpose church is it
[1:52:54] isn't going to church to just play music
[1:52:57] sing song Church it's a place where
[1:52:59] correction judgment begins at the house
[1:53:01] of God we must recognize ourself dead
[1:53:05] and alive to Christ when then he may may
[1:53:09] the way that would come could sacrifice
[1:53:11] ourselves to his service to follow him
[1:53:15] if we follow him we lead the life that
[1:53:18] he lived hallelujah
[1:53:21] huh that's wonderful Jesus said and
[1:53:24] spoken let me just give you a few
[1:53:26] quotations on it listen close don't miss
[1:53:29] it Jesus said at that day he would
[1:53:32] separate the people like the sheep and
[1:53:34] the goats and he would say to the ghost
[1:53:36] stand on the left side and to the Sheep
[1:53:39] stand on the right side and he said to
[1:53:42] the ghost depart from me because I was
[1:53:44] hungry and you didn't feed me I was in
[1:53:47] prison and you did not visit me I was
[1:53:49] naked and you clothed me not I was
[1:53:52] thirsty and you gave me no drink I was
[1:53:55] sick and you don't and you didn't visit
[1:53:57] me so depart from me and on the sheet on
[1:54:00] the ship he said I was hungry and you
[1:54:03] fed me I was naked and you give me
[1:54:05] clothes I was sick and you ministered to
[1:54:08] me and notice don't fail to get this
[1:54:10] church keep this in your heart forever
[1:54:13] I was unconstant Lee it was
[1:54:15] unconsciously done in other words they
[1:54:19] weren't doing it for reward they were
[1:54:21] doing it for recognition
[1:54:22] it was unconsciously done the people
[1:54:25] done don't do it for line-of-duty a man
[1:54:29] that gives you something another because
[1:54:31] he ought to do it a man that feeds you
[1:54:33] because he ought to do it he's got a
[1:54:35] selfish idea it should be your very life
[1:54:41] your very action hallelujah
[1:54:46] he said well I know the people are not
[1:54:49] there yet they're not because when you
[1:54:50] call for prayer nobody ever comes they
[1:54:54] selfish you might not need something but
[1:54:57] there's somebody in this church that
[1:54:58] needs prayer
[1:55:00] mmm and when we don't show up for prayer
[1:55:02] it's because we're selfish
[1:55:04] we got everything everything is okay
[1:55:06] with us we got what we need what about
[1:55:08] your brothers and sisters in the church
[1:55:09] what about those who need deliverance
[1:55:11] and you ought to be down on your knees
[1:55:13] praying for them see that's what I'm
[1:55:16] talking about people you got to become
[1:55:19] self less it was so surprising to these
[1:55:24] sheep that they said Lord when were you
[1:55:27] hungry and when would we feed you when
[1:55:30] were you hungry and we fed you when were
[1:55:32] you naked and we give you clothes when
[1:55:34] were your thirst and we give you drink
[1:55:36] when were you sick and we minister to
[1:55:38] you
[1:55:38] it was so Adam Attica Lee out of love
[1:55:41] just your life lived in them God let the
[1:55:45] people say that Carrie did it for us
[1:55:47] so automatically woo he didn't even have
[1:55:51] to think about it when were you Lord
[1:55:54] when we never knew that look at what
[1:55:56] Jesus Turner said in so much as you have
[1:55:59] done it unto these you did it unto me
[1:56:03] unselfish life not the second thought
[1:56:06] not to think about it but you are so
[1:56:09] dead to the things of this world and so
[1:56:12] alive in Christ and so walking on the
[1:56:14] the highway that these things are just
[1:56:17] as automatic things you just do it not

[1:56:44] things here but you know we look at this
[1:56:46] thing and we must understand that at the
[1:56:49] end of the day with free women we're
[1:56:53] free church we're not buying woman we're
[1:56:56] not a bondsman we're free and the Bible
[1:56:59] said he whom the Sun is set free is free
[1:57:01] indeed
[1:57:01] when you find yourself Amen thinking
[1:57:04] about oh well I should I do this or
[1:57:07] shall I do that we need to repent says
[1:57:10] Lord help me
[1:57:10] he
[1:57:12] it shouldn't even be a second thought
[1:57:15] when there's opportunity to do good we
[1:57:18] must do it right you know it's not all

[1:57:45] why can't you get your own cake y'all
[1:57:51] know we guilty or no hallelujah and we
[1:57:55] fail to see we being tested do unto
[1:57:59] others as you would have right cuz we
[1:58:01] have no idea why the person is sitting
[1:58:03] there asking that question maybe they
[1:58:06] feel tired or something that's going on
[1:58:07] there you know and maybe they just won't
[1:58:09] see you share a little bit of love there
[1:58:11] can you get me a glass of water y'all
[1:58:17] understand me just simple things that
[1:58:19] pass us by and we need the jump and I
[1:58:24] you know what really caught my attention
[1:58:25] went with these things no hope she
[1:58:28] wouldn't mind it but my wife was inside
[1:58:31] and the mailman had come and my daughter
[1:58:34] was coming to the house and she called
[1:58:37] my daughter says why are you coming to
[1:58:40] the house could you check the mailbox
[1:58:41] before coming into the house all of a
[1:58:45] sudden there was a silence
[1:58:47] and she had to think about it she
[1:58:52] eventually did it but I can almost hear
[1:58:56] her say like what she did say oh why
[1:58:58] can't you get it you closer to the house
[1:59:00] than I am right now but it was cold
[1:59:03] outside yeah I understand but regardless
[1:59:08] at what point do we become a sacrifice
[1:59:11] you do it not because
[1:59:16] you're not gonna always want to do right
[1:59:17] right you know me wanna do because of
[1:59:20] your flesh y'all heard what I said
[1:59:22] your will will always get in the way
[1:59:25] thank you jesus said you know I'm tired
[1:59:28] and I've been preaching three and a half
[1:59:31] years and these disciples have not been
[1:59:33] such a good you know I had to go take
[1:59:36] breaks at times didn't he he got away
[1:59:39] from us they stay here till I get back
[1:59:41] y'all understand that human part of us I
[1:59:44] need a break
[1:59:46] and he did and the thing about it is but
[1:59:50] it never stopped him from moving forward
[1:59:53] when he saw his own wheel getting in the
[1:59:56] way he prayed not my will but thine be
[1:59:58] done and when we see our own wheel
[2:00:01] getting in the way that's what we should
[2:00:03] pray Father let your will be done and we
[2:00:10] can overcome I'm telling you will come
[2:00:12] to perfection quicker that way then
[2:00:15] being stubborn with our own will right
[2:00:21] you say stubbornness it's not it is not
[2:00:23] obvious stubbornness as witchcraft
[2:00:26] remember when Saul was supposed to do
[2:00:28] the will of God and he changed it just a
[2:00:31] little bit and he was so deceiving said
[2:00:34] but I've done it Sammy I did what God
[2:00:36] said do know God said kill everything
[2:00:38] kill the king kill everything if he's
[2:00:43] got a dog kill it Sammy says no
[2:00:49] kept the best thing I mean song-song
[2:00:50] said we've kept the best things Sammy
[2:00:53] said bring me that key where's that a
[2:00:54] gag and did what he did he cut see you
[2:00:58] got to understand that King is that that
[2:01:02] will I'm gonna kill it right now and
[2:01:06] Samuel I saw you're gonna die too
[2:01:08] because you disobeyed God and it was so
[2:01:12] made plain to you and you said right
[2:01:14] there and you let the people persuade
[2:01:17] you to do something different than what
[2:01:18] God say do that woman one time the
[2:01:20] Prophet said there's a prophet who was a
[2:01:22] prophet who said to the other prophet
[2:01:24] come on and go to my house it's gonna be
[2:01:26] okay God said and maybe God told him to
[2:01:30] say that I don't know all I know is this
[2:01:33] that prophet was eaten killed rather
[2:01:38] what was in the lion are there lion
[2:01:41] killed by a lion because he disobeyed
[2:01:43] because his will he let the devil
[2:01:46] persuade him I know I gave you a lot to
[2:01:52] think about and I trusted what I bought
[2:01:55] this morning was a blessing to you
[2:02:01] because it it helps me now every when
[2:02:05] you do the will of God like I say it
[2:02:07] won't bring bring pleasure to the flesh
[2:02:10] all the time sometimes it will you know
[2:02:15] when God told him and go over there and
[2:02:16] get them grapes I'm sure they enjoyed
[2:02:18] those grapes hallelujah but it was the
[2:02:23] will of man that came back and said we
[2:02:25] can't take it
[2:02:27] don't ever say if God said I'm gonna
[2:02:29] make you perfect and you can do all
[2:02:31] things through Christ Jesus don't ever
[2:02:33] let your will tell you something
[2:02:34] different
[2:02:35] let's Stan that's there I trust you were
[2:02:44] blessed Lord let thy will be done that's
[2:02:49] that's my desire I trust is your desire
[2:02:52] for God's perfect will to be done in
[2:02:55] your life that's what the bride is about
[2:02:58] the bride that's what brothers say the
[2:03:00] bride is about every word of God
[2:03:02] he broke one word but she will not and
[2:03:05] the only way that you could ever not
[2:03:07] break the word is to receive the Holy
[2:03:10] Ghost in you because that's perfection
[2:03:13] you become perfection because he's
[2:03:16] perfection
[2:03:16] you become accepted because he accepted
[2:03:19] he's accepted you are and I are accepted
[2:03:22] in the beloved he became our sin that we
[2:03:26] might become his righteousness and
[2:03:27] that's why the devil downplays the Holy
[2:03:29] Ghost he let the Holy Ghost be anything
[2:03:32] anything and you know what the Holy
[2:03:35] Ghost is life that's the only life it's
[2:03:39] the Holy life of God and I don't care
[2:03:43] what kind of emotional experiences you
[2:03:45] have don't settle down until you see the
[2:03:49] life of Christ on display in your life

[2:16:50] one thing about us as Christians we
[2:16:52] always want the will of God righteous
[2:16:57] with our flesh and so for like that when
[2:16:59] it comes down to it real crucial all
[2:17:03] [Music]
[2:17:07] world just give me Jesus just give me
[2:17:09] what Jesus wants that's all I really
[2:17:12] want my life to be what Christ wants me
[2:17:14] to do it's a great topic you know
[2:17:16] brother Brooks did a wonderful job
[2:17:18] preaching it remember the mystery of his
[2:17:21] will is the mystery for your life to
[2:17:24] seek God God revealed to us if we just
[2:17:28] walk with Him waiting it's really
[2:17:33] blessing the last scripture you use
[2:17:35] about the foolish verge of being sane it
[2:17:37] was so automatic brother Graham said
[2:17:39] that they just gave clothes to them the
[2:17:41] person needed clothes they visited the
[2:17:43] Sikh Christian Princeton it was so
[2:17:45] automatic to them and that's what we
[2:17:48] want we want to have our lives be just
[2:17:49] automatically given or just constantly
[2:17:51] given no one's got to ask us no one's
[2:17:53] got to beg us to give but our lives are
[2:17:56] just given over that so automatically
[2:17:59] we're just living from the people how do
[2:18:00] I live for other people that's what you
[2:18:03] know you're doing God's will because
[2:18:04] it's not about know what you want to do
[2:18:06] to help yourself it's about doing
[2:18:08] something for somebody else
[2:18:10] praise the Lord let's just close a
[2:18:13] prayer here heavenly topic we're so
