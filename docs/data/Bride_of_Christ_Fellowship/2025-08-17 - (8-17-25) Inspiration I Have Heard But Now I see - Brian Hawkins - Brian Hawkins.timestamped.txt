[0:00] It says that this is my story and this
[0:03] is my song. What does that mean? That's
[0:06] that means you have your own experience
[0:08] with the Lord. This is my story. This is
[0:10] your story. This is your story to tell.
[0:12] This is your story to testify of, right?
[0:15] This is your song. This is a song that
[0:17] you can sing. Why? Because there's
[0:19] something that struck you and it applies
[0:21] to you. It's something that you have
[0:23] that you can give praise to the Lord.
[0:25] Amen.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Uh just might as well get into the word.
[0:29] I've I've got uh many many pages here,
[0:31] but we don't we don't count the the
[0:33] quality of a service on how many pages
[0:35] you have, but uh just don't want to be
[0:38] dependent on the notes, but just want to
[0:40] be dependent on the on the spirit of the
[0:42] Lord. Amen. So, if you would turn with
[0:44] me to Job chapter 32.
[0:51] Appreciate the prayers.
[0:53] Appreciate the love that y'all have for
[0:55] us.
[0:58] and I'd probably be in trouble if I
[1:00] didn't do so. You know, everybody back
[1:01] home in Pennsylvania says hello.
[1:04] And uh it's been a busy summer. We've
[1:08] been to BYC. We just came back from TWT.
[1:12] We're getting ready to have our own uh
[1:14] Labor Day meetings and uh just a lot of
[1:17] things going on. There's meetings going
[1:19] on everywhere. Uh so what excuse would
[1:22] people have
[1:24] to not get closer to the Lord? Right. I
[1:26] mean, I I understand if you can't afford
[1:28] to travel, you know, we we understand
[1:31] those things, but the Lord knows your
[1:32] heart. And I'm not here to condemn you
[1:34] on those things, but I just think of the
[1:36] world uh the the people that uh they're
[1:39] just laden with excuses, excuse after
[1:41] excuse of why they can't do something,
[1:43] of why they won't surrender, why they
[1:45] won't go to church. You know, there's
[1:47] there's all kinds of excuses. But he
[1:49] that loves the Lord is not going to keep
[1:52] himself or herself away from the house
[1:54] of worship. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother,
[1:57] &gt;&gt; so uh Job chapter 32, let's start in the
[2:00] first verse. I wasn't going to read
[2:02] this, but I I was reading in the office
[2:04] and uh I was reading about that and I
[2:07] was like, you know, I should probably
[2:08] include this in here, so it might be a
[2:11] little lengthier. It might take what, a
[2:13] couple minutes. We have a couple extra
[2:14] minutes today, don't we? Yes, sir.
[2:16] But, uh, it's it's always good to go
[2:19] back to see what the thought is, you
[2:22] know, to to see where it started, you
[2:24] know, and you'd have to do that from
[2:26] Genesis to Revelation if you preach, you
[2:28] know, because Brother Jesse probably
[2:30] knows that when you start into
[2:31] something, well, wait, let me go get me
[2:32] the let me go get the the background
[2:34] behind this so you could see and then
[2:36] you'll keep going back to get a
[2:38] background, but you got to start
[2:39] somewhere, right?
[2:41] So Job 32,
[2:45] excuse me, starting first verse, it
[2:47] says, "So these three men
[2:49] ceased to answer Job because he was
[2:51] righteous in his own eyes."
[2:54] That's a very important part there that
[2:56] he was righteous in his own eyes.
[3:00] Then was kindled the wrath of Eliu, the
[3:03] son of Berkeel, the buzzite of the
[3:05] kindred of Ram. Against Job was his
[3:08] wrath kindled. Not because he was
[3:11] jealous
[3:13] but his wrath was kindled because he
[3:15] justified himself rather than God. Job
[3:18] was spent his time justifying himself
[3:21] instead of uh uh glorifying God uh on on
[3:25] his behalf. So we know we all know the
[3:27] story of Job in in the beginning where
[3:29] it talks about how the Lord loved Job
[3:31] and he the Lord was bragging on Job, you
[3:34] know. So we know how the Lord felt about
[3:37] him, but it seems that Job didn't didn't
[3:40] uh give place to the Lord. So verse
[3:42] three says, "Also against his three
[3:44] friends was his wrath kindled because
[3:46] they had found no answer and yet uh and
[3:49] yet had condemned Job." You know, a lot
[3:52] of people will bring out the the problem
[3:53] problem, but they give no solution,
[3:55] right? It's easy to call out the
[3:57] problem, but it's not so easy to give
[3:59] good counsel to give a solution, you
[4:02] know? So they were just answering
[4:03] whatever came to their mind, whatever
[4:05] they felt like felt like answering. He
[4:07] says, "Now Eliu had waited till Job had
[4:11] spoken." He had waited till Job had
[4:14] spoken because they were elder than he
[4:17] see the respect of this this man Eliu.
[4:20] He says, uh, "When Eliu saw that there
[4:22] was no answer in the mouth of these
[4:24] three men, then his wrath was kindled.
[4:28] And Eliu the son of Jericho the abusite
[4:31] answered and said,"I am young and ye are
[4:34] very old. Wherefore I was afraid and dur
[4:36] not show you mine opinion." So it just
[4:39] goes to show the respect that this man
[4:41] had that he held his peace. He let the
[4:43] elders speak. But when he saw that there
[4:46] was no answer, that's when he was upset
[4:48] and that's when he started to speak and
[4:51] gave his opinion. He said, I I I said
[4:54] days should speak and multitude
[4:56] multitude of years should teach wisdom,
[4:59] but there is a spirit in man and the
[5:01] inspiration of the Almighty giveth them
[5:04] understanding.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; Great men are not always wise.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[5:10] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that?
[5:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Right. Great men are not always wise. Do
[5:17] they have lifelong experience? Uh uh
[5:20] have they had good experiences? You see
[5:22] somebody that's overcome uh uh uh they
[5:24] seem like a wise man, but they don't
[5:26] always have the answers.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; That's a that's a good place to start,
[5:31] but just keep in mind they don't always
[5:34] have the right wisdom. Right. So neither
[5:36] do the aged understand judgment. He's
[5:39] not putting them down. He's saying they
[5:41] don't always they're not always wise. So
[5:46] therefore I said, hearken to me. I also
[5:48] will show mine opinion. Behold, I waited
[5:51] for your words.
[5:53] I waited for your words. I gave ear to
[5:56] your reasons, whilst you searched out
[5:58] what to say. Yay, I attended unto you,
[6:00] and behold, there was none of you that
[6:02] convinced Job. Not one of you convinced
[6:05] Job
[6:09] or that answered his words, lest you
[6:11] should say, we have found out wisdom,
[6:13] God thrusteth him down, not man.
[6:20] God will do the thrusting down. You
[6:22] know, they might have been aged. This
[6:24] man Eliu showed respect. And in Proverbs
[6:27] 16:31, you don't have to turn there. It
[6:29] says, "The horey head is a crown of
[6:30] glory.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; If it be found in righteous in the way
[6:34] of righteousness."
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So not every age person has wisdom
[6:39] and understanding. But that he that is
[6:41] in righteous in in righteousness in the
[6:44] way of righteousness he has uh uh that
[6:47] man the the hory head means mean means
[6:50] the gray head and you can't see my gray.
[6:53] I I hide it very well.
[6:58] But the the hory head is a crown of
[7:00] glory if it be found in the way of
[7:03] righteousness.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But like I said, the first one
[7:06] that you want to go to is somebody with
[7:08] experience. But just keep in mind, they
[7:11] don't always have the answer. That's why
[7:13] we have to look unto the unto the Lord
[7:15] for the answer. And one more spot real
[7:17] quick while you're standing. Job 42
[7:20] starting in the first verse. And while
[7:23] you're while you're turning there,
[7:24] inspiration in the Hebrew lexicon means
[7:27] breath, wind, angry or vital breath,
[7:32] divine inspiration,
[7:34] intellect,
[7:36] a blast of breath, inspiration, soul and
[7:40] spirit. This is in the Hebrew lexicon.
[7:43] So Job chapter 42,
[7:46] it says, "Then Job answered the Lord and
[7:48] said, I know that thou can't do
[7:49] everything." Excuse me. Yes. I know that
[7:53] thou can't do everything, and that no
[7:55] thought can be withholden from thee. Who
[7:57] is he that hideth counsel without
[7:59] knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that
[8:02] I understood not. Things too wonderful
[8:05] for me which I knew not. See, Job had a
[8:08] very sharp rebuke from the Lord. And uh
[8:11] now he's come to terms with it. Verse
[8:13] four, he says, "Here, I beseech thee,
[8:15] and I will speak, I will demand of thee,
[8:16] and declare thou unto me. I have heard
[8:19] of thee by the hearing of the ear, but
[8:21] now mine eyes seeth. Wherefore I abhore
[8:25] myself and repent and dust and ashes.
[8:29] Job is saying, I have seen the error of
[8:31] my ways and I bring myself to you with
[8:34] repentance.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Because he spoke things that he didn't
[8:38] really understand. He had uh uh he had
[8:40] his emotions that were running wild and
[8:42] he was just speaking. He was speaking
[8:45] how he felt, not realizing who he was
[8:48] speaking to and the complaint uh to the
[8:50] complaint department. He didn't realize
[8:52] the effect that it was going to have.
[8:53] But it was so selfish upon himself. It
[8:56] was until he had to he had to come to
[8:58] this selfnowledge
[9:00] of his wrongs.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[9:03] &gt;&gt; So what I'd like to speak on this
[9:04] morning is is uh inspiration.
[9:08] I have heard but now I see. Amen.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; I have heard but now I see.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; So seeing is also understanding.
[9:19] Understanding is seeing. You know when
[9:21] we read through the scripture where I I
[9:23] have come face to face with something
[9:25] that doesn't mean that I've that I've
[9:27] come face to face with the with the
[9:29] person but I've come face to face with
[9:31] the situation. I finally understood. I
[9:34] come to terms with it.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; So let's look to the Lord in prayer.
[9:40] Blessed heavenly father, I just thank
[9:42] you so much for the privilege that we
[9:43] have to be here behind this sacred desk
[9:45] one more time amongst your people. What
[9:46] a wonderful people uh they are to to
[9:49] come and speak to. Oh father Lord, just
[9:51] come with worship in their hearts,
[9:52] worship and praise coming from their
[9:54] mouth, Lord God, and their hands raised,
[9:56] Lord. They just want to come and they
[9:58] want to have church this morning. They
[9:59] want to hear from your spirit, oh God.
[10:01] They want to hear from you. Father, I
[10:03] just pray that you would uh help me to
[10:05] get myself out of the way to let your
[10:06] spirit do the speaking through my lips.
[10:08] So, Father, I yield this vessel unto you
[10:10] that you would speak freely, oh God.
[10:12] Father, I just pray that it would be a
[10:14] blessing to the people that we would
[10:15] take your word, that we would hear your
[10:17] word and not just only hear it, but we
[10:19] would apply it into our lives. Not that
[10:21] not that it would just be something that
[10:22] sounds like a good philosophy, but Lord,
[10:24] that it's a way of life, that it would
[10:26] change our lives for the better, oh God,
[10:28] in a positive way. Father, we just ask
[10:30] that you would strengthen every believer
[10:32] here, God. those that are weak, we just
[10:34] pray that you would give them strength,
[10:35] that they would continue to walk in your
[10:36] gospel, that they would not uh uh
[10:38] forsake you, oh God, but they would
[10:40] forsake the very things of the world,
[10:41] that they would dedicate or rededicate
[10:43] themselves to your way and to your
[10:45] purpose and to your kingdom. Father, we
[10:47] just ask for your blessings to be upon
[10:48] this service. Bless brother Jesse for
[10:50] opening the pulpit for us to come and
[10:52] minister uh to your people one more
[10:54] time. Lord, we ask all these things in
[10:56] your precious name, our Lord Jesus
[10:58] Christ. Amen. And amen. You may be
[11:00] seated. And is anybody in a hurry this
[11:03] morning?
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; Hopefully, you got good sleep.
[11:09] I don't know if you've ever listened to
[11:10] Brother George Smith preach, but he he
[11:13] he carries a level with him and he puts
[11:15] it on the pulpit. If he sees somebody
[11:17] sleeping, he'll slap that level on the
[11:19] pulpit and it'll scare you. It scares
[11:22] those that are awake.
[11:25] But, like I said, I'd like to speak on
[11:27] inspiration.
[11:28] I have heard but now I see. So
[11:31] inspiration in the free dictionary the
[11:33] definition is this just trying to uh uh
[11:36] lay the foundation here so we can so we
[11:38] can uh just hit our feet uh on the
[11:40] ground running right so inspiration
[11:45] is the excitement of the mind and
[11:48] where's the greatest battle ever fought
[11:50] &gt;&gt; is in the mind right so the excitement
[11:53] of the mind or emotions to a high level
[11:56] of feeling or activity so there's
[11:59] something behind The excitement of the
[12:01] emotions, it drives you to do something,
[12:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[12:06] The condition of being so excited. Who's
[12:10] excited this morning?
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Then you must be inspired.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; What inspired you? It must have been the
[12:16] worship because you were being happy in
[12:17] the Lord this morning. Raising our hands
[12:19] and giving God praise. There must have
[12:21] been something exciting about it.
[12:23] Something exciting that the that the
[12:25] world doesn't see as being very
[12:27] exciting, right? Uh, a lot of people
[12:30] think that that all church is just so
[12:32] boring. Ah, they haven't been to Akran,
[12:34] Ohio before, but
[12:38] and I've and I've been to other places
[12:40] and it's just so great to see people
[12:42] worship and it's not always in the
[12:44] jumping and shouting. Don't let that
[12:46] fool you. It's not always in jumping and
[12:48] shouting because that could fool the
[12:49] very people within the room,
[12:52] &gt;&gt; right? So, some people jump and shout
[12:54] because they heard something that that
[12:56] would tickle their ears or make them
[12:58] it'll have a feelood on their spirit,
[13:00] right? So, then they jump and they shout
[13:02] or they might have been talking about
[13:03] something the night before and the
[13:04] minister comes and and he's talking
[13:06] right to it. Isn't that exciting? That
[13:08] excites people. That excites me as a
[13:10] minister. That excites brother Jesse as
[13:12] a minister. That's exciting because you
[13:14] know it's the Lord moving. You know the
[13:16] Lord is in the presence and in the
[13:18] presence of the Lord there's liberty and
[13:20] excitement.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Right? There's a high level of emotion.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; You can have a high level of emotion
[13:30] and express it quietly,
[13:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, but wait a second. It's it's all you
[13:36] got to shout. You got to jump. You got
[13:38] to run. But it the Lord wasn't in the
[13:41] earthquake. The Lord wasn't in the in
[13:44] the thunderings. The Lord wasn't in all
[13:45] the loud stuff, but what was it? A still
[13:48] small voice.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. We don't want to be deceived by
[13:52] all that by that all that electric
[13:55] emotion uh uh uh uh being anointed on
[13:59] the spirit, but we want that Holy Spirit
[14:01] anointing on the soul. Amen.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; So,
[14:04] &gt;&gt; the quality of being so excited as
[14:07] manifested in something, something is
[14:09] showing forth because you've been
[14:11] excited about something. you something
[14:13] has moved you. Amen. A person or thing
[14:16] that moves the intellect or emotions or
[14:19] prompts action or invention.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Look at the light bulbs. Look at carpet.
[14:24] Look at the chairs. Look at everything
[14:26] in this room. Drywall, glass, whatever
[14:28] it is. Somebody was inspired to develop
[14:31] something. They they were inspired by
[14:33] something to create, to invent
[14:36] something.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; There was an inspiration. They saw a
[14:40] need. They were inspired to research, to
[14:43] develop, to create, to help uh make it a
[14:47] better place for uh uh men and women on
[14:49] the earth. Right.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; So something such as a a a creative act
[14:55] or idea that is inspired. Now this that
[14:59] also is is a divine guidance or
[15:03] influence.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Well, inspiration is an influence.
[15:08] Absolutely. It is an influence
[15:11] &gt;&gt; divine guidance or influence exerted
[15:14] directly on a human mind. Oh
[15:18] &gt;&gt; here it is or soul
[15:24] &gt;&gt; a divine guidance or influence. We have
[15:26] the watchtowwer on the inside, right?
[15:28] The inside man is the watchtowwer.
[15:30] Whether you whether you have faith in
[15:32] God or whether you doubt God, it's the
[15:35] faith or doubt struggle within the soul,
[15:37] right? Within the inside man.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; So it's that watchtowwer that we want to
[15:42] influence it. What happens when you cast
[15:44] out a spirit? What do you need to do?
[15:46] You need to influence your body. You
[15:48] need to influence your spirit. You need
[15:50] to influence your soul with
[15:52] righteousness. You need to fill it with
[15:54] something good. or else what? That same
[15:56] spirit that was cast out will come back.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; And bring seven other worse than it.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to do something about it.
[16:06] When there's that change in your life, a
[16:08] change for the positive,
[16:10] &gt;&gt; there has to be something that comes
[16:12] behind it to reinforce.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; There has to be something there of
[16:17] righteousness because if not, the
[16:20] influence of the wicked one will surely
[16:23] rush in.
[16:25] and to take try to take you captivity.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; So second Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16
[16:34] it says all scripture
[16:38] is given by inspiration of God. We know
[16:42] that we understand that as being God
[16:44] breathed, right? How many's heard that
[16:46] term God breathed? So the the all
[16:49] scripture,
[16:52] &gt;&gt; we like that threeletter word, right?
[16:55] &gt;&gt; All scripture
[16:57] &gt;&gt; is given by inspiration of God.
[17:01] We we'll get there in a minute. Just
[17:03] remember that it says all scripture
[17:06] &gt;&gt; and is profitable for doctrine, for
[17:09] reproof, for correction. How many wants
[17:12] to be corrected?
[17:14] &gt;&gt; Look, Job is our example, right? The
[17:16] Lord bragged on him for being an upright
[17:17] man and he shued evil. He didn't like
[17:19] evil or kicked evil out. He didn't
[17:21] entertain it.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; But he still had to go through that
[17:25] correction,
[17:27] &gt;&gt; right? It shows what spirit's on the
[17:30] inside of us. And it's not a godly
[17:31] spirit when we uh re rebuke reproof.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Try to say that a few times fast. Right.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So when you come against
[17:41] correction, see if you if if the Lord
[17:43] loves you, right,
[17:46] &gt;&gt; he's going to come and correct you.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; He's going to come and chastise you.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're his son. You're his
[17:53] daughter. He doesn't want to see you go
[17:55] in the error of your ways.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Because there's no error in his ways,
[18:00] &gt;&gt; right? He's trying to keep your foot
[18:02] less you dash your foot against a stone.
[18:05] let you let you misstep a foot
[18:08] &gt;&gt; and take a step in the wrong direction.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; He's there to guide you. He's there to
[18:12] comfort you. He's there to help you.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; He's there to strengthen you.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; He's there to inspire you. Amen.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; So it it is profitable for doctrine,
[18:25] for reprove, for correction, for
[18:27] instruction and righteousness that any
[18:30] common man may be perfect.
[18:34] Oh, did anybody catch that?
[18:37] That's wrong, isn't it?
[18:40] You should come against me all now. No,
[18:43] no, no, no, no, no. Let's rewind. It
[18:45] doesn't say that any common man.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; It says that the man of
[18:51] &gt;&gt; God,
[18:52] &gt;&gt; that the man of God is not just for
[18:54] anybody, but the one that loves him,
[18:57] &gt;&gt; the one that loves the correction, the
[18:59] one that loves the rebuke.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the one that loves his loving
[19:05] kindness, for his mercies are made new
[19:07] every day. Right? That the man of God
[19:09] may be perfect through thoroughly thorly
[19:13] furnished unto all good works.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to mold you. He wants to
[19:19] change you into a way that he is pleased
[19:21] with it.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; You are a masterpiece in his eyes. Amen.
[19:25] Because he's done a work for you.
[19:27] Hallelujah.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; I've been trying to think of a word and
[19:31] I and I can't think of it, but uh
[19:34] somebody help me out. That's uh begins
[19:37] with an R and it's the same as
[19:39] witchcraft.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Rebellion is the same as witchcraft.
[19:42] Thank you very much.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Devil get thee behind me. We're going to
[19:48] get through.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to rebel. That's the
[19:53] word that I was looking for. We don't
[19:54] want to rebel against his instruction,
[19:56] right?
[19:57] &gt;&gt; So, oh, I could go to another one. It's
[19:59] Psalms 119 and 140, but uh you don't
[20:03] have to turn there, but y'all can read
[20:05] it later. Psalms 119. There is so much
[20:07] in Psalms 119.
[20:10] If you don't know how to worship, let me
[20:11] direct you to Psalms.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[20:15] &gt;&gt; David knew how to worship.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Let David be your inspiration. Amen.
[20:21] But second Peter chapter 1 verse 20
[20:26] it says knowing this first
[20:31] that no prophecy of the scripture is of
[20:34] any private interpretation.
[20:37] The Methodists just don't have it. The
[20:39] Baptists just don't have it. Right?
[20:44] Knowing this verse that no prophecy of
[20:46] the scripture is of any private
[20:47] interpretation. I'd go so far as to not
[20:51] every message person is a message
[20:53] believer that even the message doesn't
[20:55] have it.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; If if you understand what I'm saying.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Because people try to make message a
[21:00] denomination. They use it as a label.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Because we don't know how what what else
[21:05] to do with it, right?
[21:07] &gt;&gt; But what is the message? The message is
[21:08] Jesus Christ. Turning the hearts back to
[21:11] the father. Right?
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Message is Jesus Christ. Message is not
[21:15] of any man save the man Jesus Christ.
[21:17] Right.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we could always always always
[21:20] always always point to Jesus Christ, we
[21:23] are doing well.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; So, I'm glad you all understand that
[21:29] because because usually I feel a
[21:31] resistance of of what I say then I have
[21:33] to explain it. So, I'm glad you
[21:35] understand what I'm trying to say. I'm
[21:37] not trying to to knock message by any by
[21:39] any means, right? So because I believe
[21:42] the message is Jesus Christ and if I
[21:44] keep that at the forefront I could
[21:45] understand and actually see what the
[21:47] message is because all scripture points
[21:50] to Christ.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; If it points to somebody else it's
[21:53] wrong. It's a wrong interpretation
[21:56] because then it becomes a private
[21:57] interpretation and then we know
[22:00] all the Joseph Smiths out there,
[22:02] &gt;&gt; right? all the all the other ones that
[22:04] all all the false Jesuses back in his
[22:07] day,
[22:09] &gt;&gt; you know, there were there were other
[22:10] people named Jesus than than the one
[22:12] that we call the Christ.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; There's many many with the name Jesus.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; So, oh my, we're getting into something
[22:20] good here.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; But remember what I'm speaking on this
[22:25] morning, inspiration, right?
[22:27] &gt;&gt; And remember second Timothy, what I told
[22:29] you to remember. All scripture is given
[22:33] by inspiration of God.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; So this is a quote that brother Brandham
[22:36] and this should be very familiar to a
[22:38] message believer. It reminds me of a
[22:41] lady in Chicago. Her boy went away to a
[22:43] seminary to learn to be a minister. Some
[22:45] Bible schoolers were in some seminary.
[22:47] And while he was away, the old mother
[22:49] took real seriously sick. And so they
[22:52] sent word for the boy to stand by. His
[22:54] mother was in such a high fever she had
[22:56] pneumonia and said that uh it might be
[22:58] an emergency call. So the boy packed his
[23:00] clothes and got ready, right? About
[23:02] sounds like the rapture.
[23:05] Getting your stuff in order. Getting
[23:06] your stuff packed. Of course, we're not
[23:08] going to pack any clothes because we
[23:09] can't take it with us, right? So he
[23:11] says, "Finally, the next day, he never
[23:12] heard no word through the night." And
[23:14] the next day said, "All is well." So
[23:17] about a year later he returned from the
[23:19] school in the east some great school of
[23:21] teaching and he came home and he greeted
[23:23] his precious mother and said uh after
[23:25] talking a while said mother I never did
[23:27] get the chance to ask you what happened.
[23:29] Said one night they told me to stand by
[23:31] and the next morning said you were well.
[23:32] Said what drug did the doctor use?
[23:36] &gt;&gt; What drug did the doctor use?
[23:39] &gt;&gt; She said honey the doctor didn't use
[23:41] nothing. He said well how did you do it?
[23:45] said, "You know where that little
[23:46] mission is down there at the square?"
[23:48] Says, "Yes." Said, "There was a lady
[23:50] that was having a prayer meeting down
[23:51] there one night and this little mission
[23:54] that that poor little humble bunch of
[23:55] people and said one of them was
[23:58] inspired.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; One of them was inspired to come up here
[24:02] and see me." And two women came and they
[24:04] asked me if if they could bring their
[24:06] pastor up and pray for me and anoint me
[24:08] with oil and lay their hands upon me
[24:09] that I'd be well. And said, you know, I
[24:12] told them, "Sure." And they brought the
[24:14] pastor up and he laid his hands on upon
[24:16] me and prayed and said, "Honey,"
[24:18] he read it right out of the Bible.
[24:22] Remember all scripture.
[24:26] All scripture. He read it right out of
[24:28] the Bible. Mark the 16th chapter said,
[24:30] "These signs will follow them that
[24:32] believe." How many believes that? Amen.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; How many people have seen it? Amen.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; And said, "You know what? The next
[24:39] morning, the doctor was so puzzled, he
[24:41] didn't know what to do. There was no
[24:42] fever in me.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; There was no fever in me.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he said, "Mother, you didn't
[24:49] associate with that group, did you?"
[24:51] See, trying to have a private
[24:53] interpretation of the word, trying to
[24:55] hold it into one group, one sect of
[24:58] people, you Pharisee,
[25:01] &gt;&gt; instead of trying to share it with other
[25:02] people, you're trying to hold it to
[25:04] yourself, trying to say, "We're the only
[25:06] ones with the truth." That's very
[25:08] denominational thinking right there. is
[25:11] when you're saying that you're the only
[25:13] one that could be saved and no one else.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "We in the school, we that are
[25:23] so highly educated, we that are that are
[25:25] so revelated above everybody else."
[25:30] Oh my, we in the school, we learned that
[25:33] Mark 16 from the ninth verse on is not
[25:35] even inspired. And she said, "Glory to
[25:38] God." God, I can imagine she could just
[25:40] jump and run and shout on that one. She
[25:42] says, "Glory to God." Says, "Way." He
[25:44] said, "Mother, you're beginning to act
[25:45] just like those people."
[25:49] &gt;&gt; She must have been in the atmosphere of
[25:52] somebody that was excited with
[25:54] inspiration.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody that had high emotions.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; She must have been in the presence of
[26:00] the Lord.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; She said, "Why?" He said, "Mother,
[26:05] you're beginning to act like those
[26:06] people. I would count it joy to act like
[26:09] those people that would glorify God
[26:12] because they saw something that
[26:13] happened. Being in the very presence of
[26:15] the God working when people say the days
[26:17] of miracles are passed.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; We've done seen it too many times. We've
[26:21] seen knees healed. We've seen hips
[26:23] healed. We've seen other things healed.
[26:25] Amen.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. She said, "You know, I was
[26:33] just thinking something." said, "I've
[26:35] been reading the Bible all the way
[26:37] through.
[26:39] Not just a portion here. Not just the
[26:41] thing that tickle my ears. Not just the
[26:43] things that that make me have a good
[26:44] philosophy to think about something. Not
[26:46] just a good quote for me to tell
[26:48] somebody when they're in despair, but
[26:50] I've been reading the Bible all the way
[26:52] through.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Something struck this woman. There's
[26:55] something on the inside that she had to
[26:57] read the Bible. There's something that
[26:59] she had to get a hold of. Amen.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; There was something real. There was
[27:03] something true.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; And it defeated every falsicity that she
[27:07] came across. Amen.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; She was faced with death.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; You know, that's when that's that's
[27:15] about the time that a lot of people only
[27:16] seek the Lord
[27:19] &gt;&gt; is when they're on their deathbed.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be so in the life of a
[27:23] believer, right?
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[27:28] She said, I was just thinking something.
[27:30] said, "I've been reading the Bible all
[27:32] the way through and other promises in
[27:34] other places, too, similar to that."
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Healing isn't the only promise.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I was just thinking, if
[27:47] God could heal me with the uninspired,
[27:50] what could he do with that which is
[27:53] really, really inspired?"
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he could give me the
[27:59] deliverance on something uninspired,
[28:02] &gt;&gt; what's going to hold a believer back?
[28:03] Amen. What's going to hold the mountain
[28:05] in your way back? Amen.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. See, if you're if you're in the
[28:13] Lord, you can find glory in just about
[28:15] anything you read. Amen.
[28:18] I'd go so far that you'd be able to find
[28:20] God in in Satan's Bible.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Because when you have one, you've got to
[28:28] have the other. That's the law of
[28:30] contrast. You can't get away from it. If
[28:32] there's good, there's evil. If there's
[28:34] evil, there's got to be good.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Because didn't the man say, "Whenever I
[28:39] do good, evil is present with me."
[28:42] Amen.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Now, don't go saying, "Oh, Brother
[28:46] Brian's saying the Satan's Bible is a
[28:47] good book." I'm not saying that. But I'm
[28:49] saying when you see one, just know that
[28:51] the other one is near.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; You know, whatever you talk about,
[28:54] that's what's going to be in your
[28:56] presence. If you start talking about
[28:57] demon spirits, you start talking about
[28:59] wickedness, you start talking about
[29:00] these things, those demons are going to
[29:02] come into your presence.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; You start talking about the Lord, you
[29:06] start talking about the angels, you
[29:07] start talking about the promises of God,
[29:09] guess who's going to show up? Amen.
[29:11] Hallelujah.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; You can find God in anything. Just like
[29:16] that little boy. He was searching. Have
[29:17] you seen God? Sunday school teacher,
[29:19] have you seen God? Well, nobody's seen
[29:20] God. Pastor, have you seen God? Nobody
[29:22] has seen God.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Even the scripture says, "No man saw God
[29:29] face to face." Right.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Because if you look upon them, they
[29:33] couldn't even touch the holy mountain.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Think of how holy God is. But coming to
[29:40] terms with the Lord, recognizing that
[29:43] who he is and putting him in his
[29:45] rightful place, giving his his him his
[29:48] rightful due, giving him his place of of
[29:50] of kingship,
[29:52] &gt;&gt; of redeemer,
[29:53] &gt;&gt; giving him his rightful place. Amen.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, you should be able to find God in
[29:59] anything. And then just a humble man
[30:01] that this young boy came across,
[30:03] have you seen God? I see God everywhere.
[30:07] Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; It's all in what you're looking for.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; I've got another quote. We We like
[30:14] quotes. We could do quotes, right?
[30:16] &gt;&gt; So, okay. So, a young lady come from a
[30:20] country church.
[30:24] I know y'all like this one. If I like
[30:26] it, I know you like it.
[30:28] A young lady come from a country church
[30:30] and her father was an oldfashioned
[30:32] shouting preacher or a member of the
[30:33] church. And so she moved into the city
[30:36] and she got all mixed up with with the
[30:38] women down there and got acting like
[30:40] they did. See, birds of a feather
[30:42] feather flock together.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; You know, be careful who you keep
[30:45] company with. Make sure that you are the
[30:46] influence, not taking on an ungodly
[30:48] influence. Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; When people start talking negative about
[30:52] the Lord, you just tell them how good
[30:53] God has been to you. Amen.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; I hate to contradict you. Actually, I
[31:00] love to contradict you, but that's not
[31:02] what I see with my God.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Bring everything unto the obedience of
[31:09] the Lord. Amen. Let every man's word be
[31:11] a lie, but God's word be truth. Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; And so, she moved into the city and got
[31:17] and she got all mixed up with with the
[31:19] women down there and got to acting like
[31:20] they did and the fashions. And one day,
[31:22] she was she was kind of ashamed for her
[31:24] papa and mama and uh to come or her
[31:27] father rather. Her mother was dead. So
[31:29] the old man, only thing he'd do, get up
[31:31] of a morning, eat his breakfast, and get
[31:33] the Bible and read it and cry.
[31:36] You know what the world thinks about men
[31:38] like that? Oh, you
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, but if you go back to Psalms,
[31:46] what do we learn that the Lord loves a
[31:49] broken and contrite spirit?
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He would he would read it
[31:57] and cry and pray and shout all day long
[32:00] and run up and down the room and she was
[32:02] a little embarrassed about it. So then
[32:04] when all the time through the night if
[32:05] he got a hold of the Bible started
[32:07] reading it, he'd raise up out of the bed
[32:08] and holler, "Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[32:10] Glory to God." Just stomp and cry half
[32:13] the night
[32:15] because this is a man who knew what the
[32:17] Lord had done for him.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; This this man had an understanding of
[32:21] where his place was in Christ.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[32:24] &gt;&gt; he had a reason to shout. Why? Because
[32:26] his name was written on the book of
[32:28] heaven. Why? Because he found himself in
[32:30] the scripture. Why? Because there was
[32:32] something that when he read it, it
[32:33] excited him. It gave him inspiration.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; It didn't tell him that he was a crow
[32:38] and he didn't belong. It told him he was
[32:40] an eagle and he was going to fly higher
[32:42] than his his his symptoms and his trials
[32:44] and his tribulations. It told him it was
[32:46] going to take him higher.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, one day she was going to
[32:52] entertain her church members to a little
[32:54] tea party like they always have, you
[32:56] know.
[32:57] I don't know if they have them so much
[32:58] anymore. I guess they just I I guess the
[33:00] women folk just gather at the bars
[33:02] anymore.
[33:04] So, she didn't know what she was going
[33:05] to do with her dad. After all, it was
[33:07] her daddy. So, she decided she put him
[33:10] up in the attic and say, "Daddy, you
[33:12] don't want to be around where these
[33:13] women are, do you?" He says, "No, I
[33:15] don't believe I want to do that." You
[33:17] know, who wants to sit around and hear
[33:19] negativity and people gossiping about
[33:21] one another? You know, who wants to sit
[33:23] there in a conversation like that? You
[33:24] know, that should be in a believer. That
[33:26] should be so sickening to your spirit
[33:28] that you can't stand being in that. That
[33:30] you would intervene like Eliu that he
[33:32] would that you would intervene.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Wait to turn. Those that are young, wait
[33:38] to turn and then you can then you could
[33:40] come with the truth. Eliu got upset
[33:43] because he was tired of hearing what he
[33:45] heard. Oh, just blabber this, blabber
[33:47] that, blabber this. You did this, you
[33:49] did that, you did this, you did that.
[33:50] You're you're a secret sinner
[33:52] &gt;&gt; is what they were trying to tell Job.
[33:54] Amen.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; But Eliu got sick of that.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; And so should we if we're ever in that
[34:02] atmosphere, we should get We should Oh,
[34:04] brother dear, sister, dear. We shouldn't
[34:06] speak ill about one another. We should
[34:08] say nice things about one another.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; And put the challenge forth. Can you say
[34:13] something nice and not something like I
[34:16] like your hair?
[34:19] That's an inside That's an inside story.
[34:22] Maybe we'll tell you someday.
[34:26] But genuinely say something nice. Amen.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Not saying something nice just to
[34:31] appease. You know, that's gains.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; So he says, "No, I don't believe I want
[34:37] to do that." He said, "Well, we're going
[34:39] to have the church women up here today
[34:40] and we're going to have a little
[34:41] meeting, a little prayer meeting." So, I
[34:43] tell you, Dad, why don't you just go up
[34:45] in the attic? Said, "I just believe I'll
[34:47] do that." Is that what they do now?
[34:49] Cloak a gossip session with a prayer as
[34:51] as a prayer meeting.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; So, we got to be careful. Oh, I saw
[34:58] brother so and so do this. Keep him in
[35:00] prayer. You know, I don't think he
[35:01] should be doing this and then just
[35:03] laying everything out there. Why can't
[35:05] you just keep it general? You
[35:07] &gt;&gt; know, you see a brother in a fault, you
[35:08] go to Matthew 18, go to him and him
[35:11] alone, right?
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Not blasting it before everybody. And
[35:15] then when you go to him alone, he
[35:17] doesn't hear you. Then you get two or
[35:18] three, right? Because a witness of two
[35:21] or three, let every word be established.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Then if they don't hear you, then you
[35:25] bring it to the church. You don't sit in
[35:27] a group and call it a prayer meeting
[35:29] blasting your brother or sister.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sorry. This this story made me go
[35:35] there, I guess.
[35:39] So
[35:41] he says, "I I just believe I'll do
[35:43] that." So she said, "Here, read this
[35:45] nice book." And she gave him a geography
[35:47] book, took his Bible away from him. And
[35:49] you know, that's what people are trying
[35:50] to do so much in this day. And it
[35:52] started years ago, decades ago, taking
[35:53] prayer and Bibles out of the schools,
[35:55] right? And you see it so much. They're
[35:57] still trying to take Bibles away.
[35:59] They're still trying to take the word
[36:00] away from the believer.
[36:03] See, he took his Bible away from him so
[36:05] he'd keep quiet. And that's what people
[36:06] want to do is they want to they want to
[36:08] silence the Christian. Why? Because they
[36:10] don't want to hear the truth. They don't
[36:11] want to hear about their sin because
[36:13] they love to entertain those demons that
[36:15] are upon them.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; She knew if he read the Bible, why he
[36:19] would go to making a lot of noise up
[36:20] there. So, he's right up over them, you
[36:22] know, where they was having a party. So,
[36:24] she gave him the geography book said,
[36:25] "This is nice. You should read it,
[36:27] daddy, because it tells you all the
[36:29] truth about the world.
[36:32] Oh, he said, "I'll be glad to read
[36:34] that."
[36:36] So, she said, "Now you go up there and
[36:38] keep real quiet till these women leave
[36:40] and then you can come back down and then
[36:42] you can do whatever you want to." Oh,
[36:45] this this woman ought to be ashamed of
[36:47] herself.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He agreed to it. So, he goes
[36:51] upstairs, sits up there, and they was
[36:53] all having their tea party, you know,
[36:54] talking about so- and so, and you know
[36:56] how it goes, having all that big time.
[36:58] And about that time, something cut loose
[37:00] upstairs. All the screaming and jumping
[37:02] and the plaster falling. He was tearing
[37:04] down the house with excitement. Amen.
[37:06] The old man running up and down. David,
[37:09] if you want to get the plaster off your
[37:10] wall, just have a jubilee in your house.
[37:12] Amen.
[37:14] The old man running up and down through
[37:15] the attic just as hard as he could go,
[37:17] jumping down, jumping up and down and
[37:19] hollering, "Glory to God. Glory to God."
[37:21] The women didn't know what happened up
[37:22] there, what they what they what he had
[37:24] upstairs. So directly down the steps he
[37:26] come as hard as he could go. She said,
[37:29] "Daddy, I gave you a geography book. I
[37:31] gave you a book that was supposed to be
[37:33] boring, uninspiring, right?"
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Said, "Yes, I know it." You know, said,
[37:39] "I was reading in this geography book
[37:41] here where there's a place in the sea
[37:43] that ain't got no bottom to it." Oh my.
[37:46] And he said, "I read over here in the
[37:48] Bible yesterday." He said, "Put my sins
[37:50] in the sea of forgiveness." Oh,
[37:52] hallelujah.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. said, "They're still
[37:55] going. They're still going with whatever
[37:57] machinery they got. They can go further
[37:59] than what they ever have before, and
[38:01] they still can't get to the bottom."
[38:03] Amen.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the pressure becomes too
[38:06] much. They can't handle the pressure.
[38:08] Glory to God. Amen.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; See, when somebody tries to keep your
[38:12] sins on you, you just take them up
[38:13] higher because they can't handle the
[38:15] pressure. Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; An eagle is a special built bird that's
[38:20] able to withstand the pressure. Amen.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm getting
[38:24] excited.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; He says they're still going. They don't
[38:30] have an end and they just keep on going.
[38:32] That's right, brother. Sister, if you
[38:34] don't know why I'm excited, then you
[38:36] haven't tasted and seen what I've
[38:37] tasted.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "That's right." And he was
[38:42] shouting about it. Well, that's about
[38:43] right. God puts our sins in the sea of
[38:45] forgetfulness. Blasts them out.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Who could lay any charge to God's elect?
[38:50] Amen. Yes.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blast them out and then they're
[38:55] there as if they've if they never
[38:57] happened. Oh my. Then we stand by the
[39:00] grace of God through Jesus Christ our
[39:02] Lord. Pure and holy just as holy as he
[39:05] was.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Do we understand that statement?
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Do we not understand what Jesus said? Be
[39:12] ye holy for I am holy. If we could if we
[39:15] could come to that same uh condition,
[39:18] &gt;&gt; he said that he is holy. Well, he is so
[39:21] holy. I can't become holy. We can't
[39:23] become holy all by ourselves. Now, see,
[39:25] we can't do anything because Jesus even
[39:27] said it. Without me, you can do nothing.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; But when we take on his spirit, Amen.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; then we could become holy like him.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We sing those songs. I I raise up
[39:45] holy hands. My hands aren't holy, but
[39:48] when I They weren't holy before, but now
[39:50] I'm in Christ. Now I can lift up holy
[39:53] hands because I've been cleansed.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Because I've been cleansed by the blood.
[39:57] Amen.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:03] Praise the Lord.
[40:05] Usually I'm about wanting to fall on the
[40:07] floor by now, but
[40:11] just as holy as he was because he
[40:13] doesn't see me.
[40:16] He doesn't see me when I come up there.
[40:18] He sees his own son. Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; The only way he can't see me because I'm
[40:26] in his son.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; And he only sees his son. Isn't that
[40:33] wonderful? We don't have to think about
[40:34] sins anymore. It's all gone. Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; It's under the blood. Yes, sir. Don't
[40:40] have to worry about it no more. It's all
[40:42] out of God's memory. He don't even
[40:45] remember it no more. Amen.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Now, see, God,
[40:50] &gt;&gt; like I said, people are always trying to
[40:52] take the word out of out of the hands of
[40:54] a believer.
[40:58] But, you know, the scripture tells us
[40:59] that before we were not a people of God,
[41:01] but now, but now we are a people. And he
[41:05] said that I will write my laws into into
[41:07] their minds and it will write it into
[41:09] our hearts. Amen.
[41:11] See, that might make it might them
[41:13] taking the word away for a little bit
[41:14] might make a believer stumble a little
[41:16] bit, but there's spiritual food put up
[41:19] in the storehouse. Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to be in this Bible,
[41:23] read and pray every day. So, because
[41:25] we're storing up spiritual food in due
[41:27] season, in the time of a famine when it
[41:30] comes. Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Well, what do you mean there isn't going
[41:32] to be a famine coming? I'm talking about
[41:35] a spiritual famine. What are you going
[41:36] to do when they start closing up
[41:38] churches? Amen.
[41:42] You're going to be like they did in the
[41:43] days of old. You're going to be looking
[41:45] for a house. You're going to be looking
[41:46] for a place to worship. And in that
[41:48] time, what are you going to have?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; So, we have to have his word written
[41:54] upon our hearts.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Because what happens when when the book
[41:59] form is gone?
[42:01] I don't I can't say if that's going to
[42:02] happen,
[42:05] but what if somebody takes your Bible
[42:07] away?
[42:08] And you know, brother, I heard this,
[42:11] brother Brad heard me say this already
[42:12] recently. I heard this older minister
[42:14] say uh uh he was being interviewed that
[42:18] uh what what an older I think it was
[42:21] Riyle or I can't remember his name, but
[42:23] RC Ral, is that a name that sounds
[42:25] familiar? JC Ral RC Sproul maybe. I I
[42:29] don't know. I can't remember what it is,
[42:30] but I just remember the interview uh the
[42:32] the man said, "What would you say to the
[42:34] younger you?" And he was saying, "Well,
[42:37] one, I wouldn't go to the seminary." I
[42:40] thought that was pretty profound of him
[42:42] to say, but he's actually uh uh
[42:45] recommending not to go to seminary. So,
[42:47] there must be something about seminary
[42:49] that ruins people's ministry. Amen. It
[42:51] takes the inspiration out of people.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; So, and then he says, "Read your Bible
[42:56] and pray every day."
[42:58] Sound familiar?
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; This is a this is a denominational
[43:03] minister. Okay.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Is is is that okay to say here?
[43:07] &gt;&gt; But this is the advice of an older
[43:09] minister.
[43:12] He's saying don't go to seminary. Read
[43:13] your Bible and pray every day.
[43:17] And then he says uh he he talks about
[43:19] ministers
[43:21] uh that they only read the scripture
[43:24] when they want to get a sermon together.
[43:29] I hope that's not the condition that
[43:31] that we as believers are in.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; We only read the Bible once in a while
[43:36] because somebody came to us and said,
[43:37] "Oh, I need your help. What do you think
[43:38] about this?" Well, let me go to the
[43:40] scripture and let me see what it says
[43:41] about it.
[43:43] Now, see, we should be so much into the
[43:45] scripture that we should know how to
[43:47] answer every man
[43:51] &gt;&gt; according as to what we've received and
[43:53] what our experience. Right? So, we
[43:56] should be so well-versed. That's another
[43:58] thing he says, know your Bible.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Of how important that is.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Just kind of throw that in there. I I
[44:08] thought that was pretty pretty profound
[44:10] with that with that older denominational
[44:12] minister advised people.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; That's what he would tell the younger
[44:17] him coming up into ministry.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It about sounds like we what we
[44:23] would advise, right, brother?
[44:27] &gt;&gt; So So
[44:29] now see, Job didn't have a Bible to go
[44:31] to. Abraham didn't have a Bible to go
[44:33] to. Moses didn't have a Bible to go to.
[44:36] These people in the Old Testament, they
[44:37] didn't really have a Bible like you and
[44:39] I have.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; They were making the Bible.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; They were living their experience that
[44:46] we could have a Bible.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; They had to go by what? inspiration.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; They had to go by what the spirit told
[44:55] them.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the Bible as a prophet.
[45:00] It isn't man's words,
[45:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:03] &gt;&gt; It's God breathed.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; A prophet spoke what the Lord put on his
[45:09] heart,
[45:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Huh? Bam. They tried to get Balum to say
[45:14] something contrary, but he couldn't do
[45:16] it.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was a prophet. He had to
[45:19] say what the Lord said.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; He couldn't say anything else.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; That's a magnificent story in itself.
[45:28] That should tell you that the spirit is
[45:29] true.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Even when you're influenced by an evil
[45:34] one, there's something greater. Amen.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; That he couldn't speak but what the Lord
[45:39] what the what the Lord put in his mouth.
[45:42] Amen.
[45:43] Now, see, in order to follow something,
[45:47] okay, in order to follow something,
[45:50] stay with me for a second, in order to
[45:52] follow something, it has to catch your
[45:54] interest.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; It has to be able to catch your
[45:58] attention and turn your eyes like a
[46:00] burning bush that wasn't being consumed.
[46:02] In order to follow something, there has
[46:05] to be an interest in that something
[46:09] &gt;&gt; or else you won't desire that something.
[46:11] Right.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Right now, in order to follow someone,
[46:17] in order to follow someone, you must be
[46:20] inspired by something that's in them.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Or else, why would you want to follow
[46:26] them?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; If you are following someone, there must
[46:30] be an inspiration inside of you that
[46:33] wants to follow them. There's an
[46:36] interest on the inside that says, "I
[46:38] like being around this person. I want to
[46:40] hang around with this person. I want to
[46:43] be like this person. I want to do what
[46:45] this person does.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; So there must be something in that in
[46:50] you that likes that person.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Right. You you with me?
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; So,
[46:58] so uh some people are inspired to do
[47:01] wicked works.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Some people that have that interest,
[47:05] there's something on the inside that
[47:07] they want to do the wicked works, too.
[47:11] Oh, but there's a law of contrast. Well,
[47:13] maybe we should maybe we should have
[47:14] preached on that this morning.
[47:17] But where there's good, there's evil.
[47:20] Where there's evil, there's there's
[47:22] bound to be a good to to prevail against
[47:24] it.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; So other people are prone to do good
[47:28] deeds because they are inspired by
[47:30] someone else. Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; See, the scripture teaches us, "No
[47:35] wonder it says, "Provoke one another
[47:37] unto love and to good works."
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Inspire them to do good.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; I remember years ago when I watched TV,
[47:45] there was a commercial on that uh there
[47:48] was one person who did something nice
[47:49] and somebody caught it. So that inspired
[47:53] them to in turn do something nice to
[47:55] somebody else and somebody else caught
[47:58] that. that inspired that person to do
[48:01] something kind for somebody else. And
[48:03] and it was a whole chain reaction
[48:06] because one person saw somebody do
[48:08] something good, it inspired someone else
[48:10] to do something good.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; See, we provoke unto love and unto good
[48:15] works. Be careful who you hang around
[48:18] with. Be careful who you like because
[48:21] those that you like, there's something
[48:23] on the inside of you that has an
[48:25] interest of that person that you're
[48:27] inspired by. Does that make sense?
[48:30] &gt;&gt; It's not real complicated. I probably
[48:31] just put it in a complicated way.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; So,
[48:37] knowing that in order to follow his
[48:39] word, there must have been something on
[48:42] the inside to inspire you to do so,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; in order to be able to receive the word,
[48:49] there must be something on the inside to
[48:52] say that is nothing but the truth.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; There has to be something there.
[48:58] Yes, sir.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; There has to be something there.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Because how is the sunlight supposed to
[49:05] strike that seed?
[49:07] &gt;&gt; When that sunlight strikes the seed,
[49:09] whether it's a seed of evil or it's a
[49:12] seed of righteousness, whenever the
[49:14] light strikes it, it's going to bloom to
[49:16] whatever it is.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; You won't know what the seed is until
[49:22] you see the fruit of it.
[49:25] Right.
[49:28] That went in my notes, but but we'll go
[49:30] with it.
[49:32] Does that make sense?
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want to lie. Part of that it it
[49:39] just I just kept going further.
[49:42] But there has to be something on the
[49:43] inside for you to be able to receive
[49:45] truth. Even Pilate himself said in
[49:47] Jesus' presence with truth right there
[49:50] with him, "What is truth?"
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:57] That's a philosopher's lifelong
[49:59] question. What is truth?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; What do we know the truth to be? What
[50:06] did Jesus say? I am the truth, the life,
[50:11] and the way.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; It become it's so simple to those that
[50:17] are able to see it.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; But it's a mystery to those that can't.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Why? because they don't have that on the
[50:25] inside. All scripture is God breathed.
[50:29] It's good for reproof.
[50:31] It's good for correction.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; For whom? To make the man of God
[50:38] perfect.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Because the world, they don't want it.
[50:43] There's nothing in them to desire it.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Even if they know the truth, there's
[50:48] nothing on the inside. If they read the
[50:50] scripture and they say, "Well," and and
[50:52] some of these people know the Bible
[50:54] probably better than what we do and they
[50:55] could quote scriptures and they could
[50:57] they could defeat you.
[51:00] They could, you know, they could whip
[51:01] you with the with all the scriptures
[51:03] that they could quote. But there's
[51:04] nothing on the inside.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Just because you know the scripture
[51:09] doesn't mean that you believe the
[51:10] scripture doesn't mean that you live the
[51:11] scripture.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:14] Oh my. See, we don't do things for
[51:17] nothing, right? We don't do it for
[51:18] nothing. If if you smoke cigarettes and
[51:20] there is something in there to to make
[51:21] you want to smoke cigarettes. If you
[51:23] drink alcohol, there's something in on
[51:24] the inside that wants to drink the
[51:26] alcohol. There has to be something on
[51:28] the inside. If you're craving something,
[51:33] if you're wanting a Mountain Dew,
[51:34] there's something on the inside that you
[51:36] need or that you want
[51:38] &gt;&gt; that you want a Mountain Dew.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; If you want to try chewing tobacco,
[51:42] there's something on the inside of you
[51:44] that wants to try chewing tobacco.
[51:47] Oh,
[51:49] bear with me. We doing okay,
[51:51] &gt;&gt; sir.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; The same with putting on makeup or
[51:55] ungodly clothing. There's something on
[51:57] the inside. If you want to go to a
[51:59] dance, there's something on the inside
[52:01] that makes you want to dance. If you
[52:03] want to go to a barroom, there's
[52:04] something on the inside that has a
[52:06] desire to go there.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; If you want to come to church,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; there's a desire on the inside that
[52:13] wants you that wants to go there.
[52:16] Hallelujah.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; But wait,
[52:21] you all of a sudden feel that you want
[52:24] to go here, but a part of you wants to
[52:27] go to church. And then it becomes a
[52:30] battle. I want part of me wants to go
[52:32] here. Part of me wants to go here. Part
[52:35] of me wants to go here. What do I do? I
[52:38] want to go here. But something tells me
[52:40] I want to go there. I go over here. Ah,
[52:43] there's something. It's a struggle
[52:45] &gt;&gt; to wherever you do good or the uh
[52:48] whenever you want to do good, evil is
[52:50] present, right?
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; And you do the things that you don't
[52:52] want to do,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; right? That's a struggle against the
[52:56] spirit in the flesh. There's something
[52:58] pulling you to one way and there's
[53:00] something else. I thank God there's
[53:01] something holding me.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Then when I want to go here, something
[53:05] overcomes that and says may and the the
[53:08] greater desire is what I serve. Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Because I love the Lord more than the
[53:13] world.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; So, what am I going to choose?
[53:16] &gt;&gt; That almost seems like an easy easy
[53:19] question, easy decision to make for a
[53:21] believer. But what about a new convert?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody that's not rooted and grounded.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; That struggle is real. That struggle is
[53:29] hard.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And then we think to ourselves, why
[53:32] can't you make that decision? I mean,
[53:34] why would you do that? Okay,
[53:37] let's go there. How many Don't raise
[53:41] your hand because I don't want to
[53:42] embarrass you. Just think about it in
[53:44] your heart. How many have done something
[53:46] that you knew was not right and you did
[53:48] it anyways,
[53:50] &gt;&gt; sir?
[53:50] &gt;&gt; But then we want to look upon Job and
[53:54] condemn him for his wrongs.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; But we're supposed to be the seasoned
[53:59] ones that make an easier decision to go
[54:02] to those to the things that are right.
[54:05] But we don't always do it do that, do
[54:07] we?
[54:08] Our
[54:10] struggle isn't as great as a new
[54:13] convert. Right? I don't know if that's a
[54:16] fair thing to say. Maybe I shouldn't
[54:17] have put it that way, but I think you
[54:18] understand what I'm trying to say
[54:21] &gt;&gt; is that it's like it it's harder for a
[54:23] new convert to make those kind of
[54:25] decisions. That's why we have to
[54:27] admonish and nurture them, right?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; That's why we need to be a mentor.
[54:31] That's why we need to provoke unto love
[54:33] and to good works, showing them,
[54:36] inspiring them, teaching them, helping
[54:38] them. Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; So whether it's a billboard or magazine
[54:42] or some YouTube video with some ungodly
[54:44] men or women or someone you hang around,
[54:46] there's something that comes within our
[54:48] atmosphere, our presence. I'm not
[54:50] talking about the ozone. There's
[54:51] something that within our our our
[54:53] atmosphere that inspires us to do what
[54:56] we do.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; So whatever company you keep, that's
[55:02] what's on the inside that you want to
[55:03] keep. Amen. Huh? What makes a person
[55:08] scream at a sporting event?
[55:10] Maybe it's their favorite athlete. I
[55:12] don't know. Somebody just hit a home
[55:14] run. Man, I can't hit a ball that far.
[55:16] Man, that guy is so good.
[55:19] What makes a person scream at a sporting
[55:21] event? What makes a person scream at a
[55:23] at a tractor pool? I tell you, I just
[55:26] told this story. I think it was
[55:28] yesterday.
[55:29] I went to our county fair. This was a
[55:32] few years ago. And okay, I'll go to a
[55:34] tractor pull. I've never been to a
[55:35] tractor pool. And I'm just, okay, I'm
[55:37] here at a tractor pool, you know. And
[55:39] then all of a sudden, uh, if you do the
[55:42] background,
[55:45] I used to really like hot rods. And, uh,
[55:50] sitting there and the first tractor,
[55:52] I think it was it was a semi, I think. I
[55:55] can't remember what it was, but it was
[55:56] that first engine revving up and then,
[55:58] man, it just, man, that sounds so good.
[56:00] And then the next one and then the next
[56:02] one. And then you see this one just who
[56:05] and then all of a sudden who
[56:07] what made me scream.
[56:11] It was something in the atmosphere that
[56:13] got me excited.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to lie. I like the sound
[56:17] of a high revan engine. I guess you know
[56:19] if it's done in the right way. I like a
[56:21] hot rod, you know. And uh and and that's
[56:24] a that's a young man's weakness right
[56:26] there.
[56:28] I'm still young,
[56:32] but that's a young man's weakness. So,
[56:34] what would make somebody that's in the
[56:36] tractors and I've never seen a semi-pool
[56:39] like this. I' I've never seen a a
[56:40] semi-pool wheelie, man. If you've ever
[56:42] seen that, oh my goodness, that that's
[56:44] quite the, you know, in a controlled
[56:46] environment. I don't want to see that on
[56:49] the highway. But it was it was pretty
[56:50] neat seeing a semi-pool wheel. What in
[56:53] the world?
[56:55] But that's uh it might have been a semi.
[56:57] It could have been those tractors were
[56:59] popping out wheels. That's all I
[57:00] remember. But truck pulls, you know,
[57:03] these these different events. What makes
[57:05] a person scream and shout? It's
[57:07] something in the atmosphere. Some It's
[57:09] the excitement that's in the atmosphere,
[57:12] &gt;&gt; right? And you find you're not the only
[57:14] one who's doing it.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of people losing their
[57:17] minds.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; What about a worship service?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Yep. You can better believe I'm Brother
[57:26] Brian's here. We're going to head home
[57:27] again.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; What about a worship service?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Why do I do that, you ask?
[57:36] Because I got to bring it to that level.
[57:38] I've got to bring it to where you're
[57:39] living, right?
[57:40] &gt;&gt; I have to.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Something inside of me compels it.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; And what kind of a minister would we be
[57:47] if we didn't bring it to where where you
[57:49] live?
[57:49] &gt;&gt; To where you are, right? So in a worship
[57:52] service, what makes a person scream and
[57:54] shout?
[57:56] &gt;&gt; What makes a person get up and dance and
[57:58] run? Something if some Oh goodness, my
[58:01] golly. If you've never seen a person
[58:04] struggling and they receive deliverance,
[58:07] &gt;&gt; if you don't know why they're running
[58:09] and shouting, then you just don't know.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; But if you have that understanding,
[58:14] &gt;&gt; you see them get deliverance and they
[58:16] just take off running, you can
[58:17] understand why. Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; And then who's the next person
[58:22] screaming? Whoa. Go on. Yeah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; You're cheering them on.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Weep with them that weep, but rejoice
[58:30] with them that rejoice. Amen,
[58:33] &gt;&gt; sir.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; We should be excited to see somebody get
[58:36] deliverance, especially a young one
[58:38] that's been struggling for so long. And
[58:40] when they jump up and down, I'm free.
[58:42] I'm free. There's something inside of
[58:44] them that's making them scream and shout
[58:46] because they struggled for so long. They
[58:48] finally got deliverance. Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And if you don't know, you just don't
[58:54] know.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; And if you don't know, just keep quiet.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Why do you say amen? Why do you raise
[59:02] your hands? I know I'm getting close to
[59:03] you. I hope I don't spit on you.
[59:06] But what makes a person say amen?
[59:09] &gt;&gt; You can agree with the word. There's
[59:11] something truth that struck your heart
[59:13] that says you can't help but say
[59:15] &gt;&gt; amen.
[59:16] I can relate to that.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; There's something relatable.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; There's a relationship there.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; You can see it where other people they
[59:28] search their their whole lives the the
[59:30] meaning of certain things of scripture.
[59:32] But blessed are your eyes
[59:34] &gt;&gt; that you could see.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed are your eyes.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And how dare we get proud just Oh, I
[59:43] could see the scripture. How come you
[59:44] how how come you can't you stuff shirt,
[59:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[59:51] say I don't believe in making people say
[59:53] amen. You know there's people say say
[59:56] amen. Say amen. Somebody say amen. I
[59:58] might say somebody praise the Lord.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; But if there's something in you that
[1:00:03] wants to say praise the Lord, then
[1:00:05] you're going to praise the Lord.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; If there's not, you're going to probably
[1:00:08] keep quiet, right?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; What am I going to say praise the Lord
[1:00:11] for? You haven't done anything for me.
[1:00:13] Oh, you just don't know yet.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; But I don't believe in forcing people to
[1:00:19] say amen. You know, because if you don't
[1:00:23] know what you're saying amen to, you
[1:00:25] should get quiet,
[1:00:27] right? Because what? Like that scripture
[1:00:29] that I read that any common man would be
[1:00:32] made perfect. You don't want to amen
[1:00:33] that because it's not true.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Right? You see where I'm You see where
[1:00:37] I'm coming from? Be careful what you're
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; amening. Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I understand that we need to
[1:00:42] pause a second. Okay. He said this. Is
[1:00:44] that true?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. He said this. Is that true?
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say anything.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; I want to talk to this fell after
[1:00:53] service.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; I don't think that was quite right.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So, that's why I don't I don't believe
[1:00:58] in forcing people to say amen.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; amen is a powerful powerful statement.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; What does it mean?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; So be it.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Let it be done.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So,
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; oh my. But what makes us do these
[1:01:13] things? It's something that strikes the
[1:01:16] spirit on the inside.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; You're involved in the spirit of the
[1:01:20] element.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; You're at a tractor pull, you're in the
[1:01:23] spirit of the tractor pull,
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; right? There's a spirit behind it.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; You're in a truck pool, there's a spirit
[1:01:30] behind it. You're at a pep rally, right?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's what they're doing is they're
[1:01:35] they're pinging you up. They're building
[1:01:37] you up. They're trying to get you in the
[1:01:38] spirit of the thing.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Remember that before football games,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; they would pump you up and pump you up
[1:01:46] and pump you up and and they would pump
[1:01:48] the audience up. You know, your
[1:01:49] classmates, they pump everybody up.
[1:01:52] Remember the wave? Woo! And everybody's
[1:01:55] getting all pumped up, getting rallied
[1:01:57] up.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's why we should read our Bible and
[1:02:01] pray before we get to church because
[1:02:02] we're getting pumped up. Amen. We
[1:02:05] shouldn't have to let the song leader
[1:02:06] get us pumped up.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; We should already be in that atmosphere.
[1:02:10] We should be bringing that atmosphere
[1:02:11] with us.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; That's why it's called the spirit of
[1:02:17] worship.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; But like that song that we sang, blessed
[1:02:28] assurance, how is it that we could sing
[1:02:30] blessed assurance? Because it's my
[1:02:32] story.
[1:02:34] This is my story. This is my song. This
[1:02:36] is my experience. This is my testimony
[1:02:39] that I've got to tell us and share with
[1:02:41] somebody else. I don't know what kind of
[1:02:42] time we got.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You could share that something
[1:02:48] has happened to you.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:53] And it's just not a small thing. Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let me tell I know you've heard
[1:03:01] my testimony.
[1:03:03] But cigarettes, the Lord taking the
[1:03:05] whole
[1:03:07] desire of smoking cigarettes. Let me
[1:03:09] tell you something, that was not a small
[1:03:12] thing
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; to me. That was that was a miracle for
[1:03:16] me.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Because I had struggled so hard with
[1:03:20] that. Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; There's something about being in his
[1:03:27] presence,
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; being where his spirit is. Amen.
[1:03:31] Oh my. What makes a minister preach what
[1:03:34] you have need of? And he has no idea
[1:03:35] what you have need of.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; What made Elijah speak the things? What
[1:03:40] What did he hear behind closed doors
[1:03:43] that that spoke what the king was about
[1:03:45] ready to do?
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Spoke the very secrets of what the king
[1:03:48] was going to do that it drove the king
[1:03:50] crazy and saying, "Who's spilling the
[1:03:52] beans?"
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; What gives that person that? It's the
[1:03:59] spirit of the Lord.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; What makes you give your a person your
[1:04:05] last $20?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; What makes you give the a person in need
[1:04:10] the very the the shirt off your back?
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; What makes you give a a word of
[1:04:15] encouragement when you have no idea what
[1:04:16] the person needs?
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of the Lord. It's the
[1:04:20] inspiration.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we could say, "Oh my, I have
[1:04:27] heard, but now I see." Because we know
[1:04:30] the scripture teaches that those that
[1:04:32] have eyes to see can't see. Those that
[1:04:36] have ears to hear can't hear. But
[1:04:38] blessed are your eyes that you could
[1:04:40] see. Blessed are your ears that you can
[1:04:43] hear.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, I have heard. I have heard
[1:04:47] the word, but now I see. Now I
[1:04:50] understand.
[1:04:52] Now I have the revelation. What is a
[1:04:54] revelation? Faith is a revelation.
[1:04:57] Revelation is an inspiration of the
[1:05:00] truth. Right?
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; What makes us want to come to church?
[1:05:06] It's that spirit on the inside that
[1:05:08] drives us because we love him. We love
[1:05:10] his statutes. We love his laws. We love
[1:05:13] his grace. We love his mercy. We love to
[1:05:15] give him praise. We love to give him
[1:05:16] honor. We love to give him his place.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is he not reigning king in
[1:05:22] your life? Is he not reigning capital L
[1:05:25] O R D in your life?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And we give our Lord, we give our King,
[1:05:31] our master, our God, his place, his
[1:05:35] rightful worship. Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:39] Wherever we go, we're we're surrounded
[1:05:41] by spirits. There are some there are
[1:05:43] spirits that that uh uh uh what makes us
[1:05:46] want to throw our hands in the air?
[1:05:47] There's a spirit on the inside that just
[1:05:49] wants to wants to throw your hand up in
[1:05:51] the air and give him praise, right? But
[1:05:54] there are spirits all around us and
[1:05:55] they're trying to influence us in any
[1:05:57] direction that they can and that
[1:05:59] direction is away from the Lord.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; They try to get you to doubt, but there
[1:06:04] are other spirits. There are angelic
[1:06:06] spirits. Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; They're trying to help you keep your
[1:06:11] faith. They get you there are some
[1:06:12] spirits that try to get you to
[1:06:14] criticize. There are other angelic
[1:06:16] spirits trying to get you to inspire
[1:06:17] grace.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; There's some spirits that try to get you
[1:06:22] to be prideful and thinking that you're
[1:06:23] better than someone else. But all the
[1:06:25] law of contrast, there's another spirit
[1:06:28] that that's there to try to inspire you
[1:06:31] to be humble.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; There are spirits that try to get you to
[1:06:34] gossip about the preacher. There are
[1:06:36] other spirits that try to get you to say
[1:06:38] something nice about the preacher. They
[1:06:39] try to get you to be greedy. There are
[1:06:41] other spirits that try to get you to be
[1:06:43] content. These are just some of the
[1:06:44] pools that we're dealing with this in
[1:06:46] this age. Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; There's spirit influences everywhere you
[1:06:51] go.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And we need to end. We're entertaining
[1:06:54] angels unaware.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; But I am so glad there's something that
[1:07:02] is holding me. Amen. And it's keeping me
[1:07:05] in truth. When I'm in doubt, he is
[1:07:07] there. When I feel shame, he is there.
[1:07:09] When I feel like I lost faith, he
[1:07:11] restores. Amen. When I am afraid, he
[1:07:14] gives me courage. Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; There was something that struck c the
[1:07:19] curiosity of Nicodemus one day. Why else
[1:07:22] would he come by night? Because he was
[1:07:23] too ashamed.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Like that man's daughter was too ashamed
[1:07:27] to have her papa around
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; because he'd be screaming and shouting,
[1:07:30] but he was ashamed to come to Jesus by
[1:07:32] day. So Nicodemus came to him by night
[1:07:34] and he had that that curiosity was just
[1:07:37] poking at him and he wanted to
[1:07:38] understand that mystery.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. of being born again.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; How can I be born again? How could I be
[1:07:46] put back into my mother's womb to be
[1:07:47] born again? That's not what he was
[1:07:49] talking about.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; But taking on a change, letting this
[1:07:53] word take hold in your life,
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; to let there be a change
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; to recognize truth and to embrace it
[1:08:01] into our bosoms. Let the word, let the
[1:08:03] Lord's word be written on your heart.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't resist the very spirit that
[1:08:09] would set you free.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] Oh my. But there was something on the
[1:08:17] inside of Nicodemus. There was a
[1:08:19] yearning. There was a thirst that was on
[1:08:21] the inside of him that he had to have
[1:08:23] some kind of a closure with an
[1:08:25] understanding of what the Lord meant.
[1:08:26] Amen.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there was something about
[1:08:30] Jesus when he spoke. There was something
[1:08:32] in his speech. It was full of grace but
[1:08:34] yet with the authority because they were
[1:08:37] baffled about this man because there was
[1:08:39] this man that never spoke like this man.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; There was something about this man that
[1:08:44] spoke uh boldness but yet it was gentle.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; It was with grace. It was instruction.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; But don't let that fool you because when
[1:08:55] wrath needs to come, wrath will come.
[1:09:00] that day when they were in the temple
[1:09:03] and those money changers when they're
[1:09:05] performing the evil. Oh, that struck the
[1:09:08] righteous indignation of our Lord.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; How dare you bring evil into the temple?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And that's how we should be. How
[1:09:19] dare you bring this that evil to this
[1:09:22] temple? For know you not that you are
[1:09:24] the temple of the Holy Ghost? How dare
[1:09:26] you bring that evil, vile, wicked stuff
[1:09:28] to this temple?
[1:09:30] Let the righteous ignation kick it out.
[1:09:32] Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Don't let it reside there.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; You know what's right and wrong.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and ponder, should I go
[1:09:40] this way of of of adversity, this way of
[1:09:42] of wickedness, or should I go this way
[1:09:44] of righteousness. You know the way. You
[1:09:46] know the truth.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; You know which way is the way of
[1:09:51] prosperity.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking monetary stuff. I'm not
[1:09:54] talking about worldly treasures, but you
[1:09:56] know the way of prosperity, of
[1:09:58] salvation. You know the way of
[1:10:00] prosperity, of deliverance.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; We doing okay.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus asked his disciples one
[1:10:09] day, "Whom do men say that I am?"
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Well, some say
[1:10:17] that you're Elijah.
[1:10:19] Some say that you're John the Baptist.
[1:10:22] Some say that you're Jeremiah.
[1:10:26] But what did the Lord say? I don't care
[1:10:28] what those other ones are saying. That's
[1:10:30] not a quote. But he's he doesn't care
[1:10:33] what the other people were saying.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't want their influence based on
[1:10:37] what other people were saying.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "But who do you say that I
[1:10:44] am?"
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; How do you see me? And Peter struck with
[1:10:47] inspiration said, "Thou art the Christ,
[1:10:49] the son of the living God." Amen.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; He had to be inspired for those words to
[1:10:54] come out of his mouth.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Because you can't say that Jesus is the
[1:10:58] Christ but by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; He had to be inspired to utter those
[1:11:04] words. And Jesus told him flesh and
[1:11:07] blood didn't reveal that to you.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Men's philosophy didn't reveal that.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Aristotle, all these Greek philosophers,
[1:11:17] philosophers, sorry, I was trying to
[1:11:19] think of another one. That's what
[1:11:21] happens when you're thinking and talking
[1:11:22] at the same time.
[1:11:26] But all these Greek philosophers,
[1:11:29] they didn't have it.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; They didn't reveal it.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; The humble man in the hut with the beard
[1:11:37] yay long, he didn't reveal it.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Anome didn't reveal it.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; But what did he say? Flesh and blood
[1:11:47] didn't reveal it, but the father which
[1:11:49] is in heaven
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; gave you that understanding.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Could you now see we get so
[1:11:57] caught up in in these things that we
[1:11:59] don't even understand that the spirit
[1:12:01] spoke
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; that the father spoke to me.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Now to me in my mind if I was Peter and
[1:12:09] the Lord told me that in my mind I'm
[1:12:11] thinking glory to God. Hallelujah. The
[1:12:14] father spoke to me.
[1:12:18] Do you not realize how blessed you are
[1:12:20] to hear the spirit of the Lord?
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We just don't know what our
[1:12:27] position is.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; How blessed of a people we are.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; To be in his presence.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, we take that for granted.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Was I in the Lord's presence or not? Oh,
[1:12:43] people were jumping and shouting. We had
[1:12:45] to have been in the Lord's presence
[1:12:48] possibly.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; What was the fruit
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; of it?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's where it's at.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; What happened in the service?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Were people jumping and shouting because
[1:13:05] they heard some nice words? The the
[1:13:08] minister was getting fired up
[1:13:11] and it fired them up. Or was there
[1:13:14] something that really took place?
[1:13:18] Did it change the way of somebody's
[1:13:20] thinking?
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Was somebody delivered
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; from fear? Was somebody delivered from
[1:13:25] anxiety?
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; That's worthy of praise. That's worthy
[1:13:31] of glory. Amen.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's worthy of g shouting a hallelujah
[1:13:35] to our Lord. Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:13:39] But you know, that was so nice to be
[1:13:42] able to hear that Peter heard that flesh
[1:13:44] and blood didn't reveal that, but the
[1:13:46] father spoke to you himself.
[1:13:49] Just a few lines down.
[1:13:52] See, you got to be careful which spirit
[1:13:54] we're of because Jesus came by and he
[1:13:57] was speaking the things that he was
[1:13:58] going to have to suffer. And Peter came
[1:14:00] along. The same one that said, "Thou art
[1:14:03] the Christ, the son of the living God."
[1:14:05] Came by, spoke with the father who laid
[1:14:08] on his heart, came by and said, "That's
[1:14:10] not so, Jesus."
[1:14:15] Oh, no. We don't We can't have that
[1:14:17] happen to you.
[1:14:19] As much as he spoke glorious thing, here
[1:14:22] in the next few moments, he spoke
[1:14:24] something that he was rebuked of. And
[1:14:27] Jesus called it out and said, "Satan, I
[1:14:29] rebuked you
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; because you desire the things of man and
[1:14:33] not the things of God."
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; So Peter had the influence of the Holy
[1:14:37] Spirit one time and then he had the
[1:14:39] influence of Satan and just a few
[1:14:41] moments later.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:14:47] See how the spirits work?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; When you have one, there's the other.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Be careful what spirit you're
[1:14:55] entertaining. Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:15:04] Oh my.
[1:15:09] I feel good. I don't know about you all.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You might be getting weary, but I kind
[1:15:15] of feel like I'm just getting started.
[1:15:19] No, actually, I feel like I'm waning.
[1:15:24] I'm past 25 the second time.
[1:15:28] I'm twice this young man's age. So, he
[1:15:31] should have twice as much as I got.
[1:15:35] It's It's not what man has. It's the
[1:15:37] measure of what the Lord puts into the
[1:15:38] man. Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:15:45] we try to shut things down if we if it
[1:15:47] doesn't come just quite to our
[1:15:49] understanding. Right. Well, we enjoyed
[1:15:52] that service, but I think it should have
[1:15:53] gone I think it would have gone better
[1:15:55] if it would have done this and this and
[1:15:57] this. And then what are you sitting What
[1:15:58] are you sitting at? You're sitting in
[1:16:00] the seat of the scornful.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; You're you're bringing man's
[1:16:04] understanding into it. Well, I think it
[1:16:05] should have been this. I think it should
[1:16:07] have been that. I don't think this
[1:16:08] should have happened. I don't think that
[1:16:09] should have happened.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Well, whatever happened happened. Okay?
[1:16:13] You can't go back and change it,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; right? If something bad happened, you be
[1:16:17] cautious for the next time,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; right? You repent and then you go on. If
[1:16:21] you find that you did something wrong,
[1:16:23] we should be humble enough. Oh,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; is that a bad word?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; We should be humble enough.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; It's hard for some people, but we should
[1:16:32] be humble enough to say, "I did wrong."
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's what happened with Job.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; I spoke all this and I didn't have the
[1:16:40] understanding of why things were
[1:16:42] happening. I heard and now I see. Now I
[1:16:45] understand.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for speaking the things that
[1:16:48] I spoke. See, Job was able to humble
[1:16:51] himself and say that I did wrong.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; How hard that is even for some seasoned
[1:16:57] message believers.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; It's hard.
[1:17:02] It's hard.
[1:17:06] See, we shouldn't say it should be this
[1:17:08] in the period,
[1:17:10] but it should be this and whatever the
[1:17:13] Lord shall desire to add to it.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever blessings he's willing to
[1:17:18] add to it, I want to be willing to
[1:17:20] receive whatever blessings he has.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, we start putting the the w
[1:17:25] the fire out. We start bringing the the
[1:17:27] wet blanket out. when we start into
[1:17:29] these scornful thoughts. Now, if
[1:17:31] something blatantly is wrong, you know,
[1:17:34] yeah, pray about it. That's that's
[1:17:37] probably first and foremost, pray about
[1:17:38] it.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And then find the area to rebuke that.
[1:17:42] Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:46] I think you I think you're well taught
[1:17:47] here. I think you I think it would be uh
[1:17:50] I think you would have the understanding
[1:17:51] of of what to do. Right.
[1:17:54] So the disciples had had a a zeal for
[1:17:57] the Lord. And I I I know I've got more.
[1:18:00] I'm probably just page. Yeah, I've got a
[1:18:03] lot more. So I don't I I probably won't
[1:18:05] go through everything. I'll just start
[1:18:06] trying to sum summarize everything.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; But the disciples had uh uh they they
[1:18:12] had a zeal sometimes to where they were
[1:18:14] overzealous. Right? There's a there's a
[1:18:16] time that we could be overzealous
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; to where it becomes that we don't
[1:18:20] recognize what spirit that we have on
[1:18:22] us.
[1:18:23] Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; So that's why I say you need to be
[1:18:26] cautious about what you do in in a in a
[1:18:29] h in a service, right? Be careful what
[1:18:32] you speak out against because it might
[1:18:34] very well be the Lord moving in that
[1:18:36] service, right? So the disciples were
[1:18:40] were rebuked for for No, they weren't
[1:18:42] rebuked. They were rebuking other this
[1:18:44] is a story that I'm thinking of, but
[1:18:46] they were rebuking other people for
[1:18:47] casting out devils. And they came to
[1:18:49] they came to Jesus and they said, "Hey,
[1:18:51] we saw some casting casting out devils
[1:18:54] in your name.
[1:18:57] We saw some casting out devils, but we
[1:18:59] rebuked them. We told them how they're
[1:19:01] they're not with they're not with the
[1:19:02] bride of Christ, Ohio."
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; So they they can't they they can't cast
[1:19:08] out devils like we cast out devils. But
[1:19:10] we have the proprietary assignment for
[1:19:13] that, though. We are the only ones that
[1:19:15] could do that. Oh, what's the name of
[1:19:18] our church? Church. It's Oh, it's the
[1:19:21] church of of Jesus Christ in God. Oh,
[1:19:24] we're the only ones that can do it. I
[1:19:27] see, brother. I told you I get those
[1:19:28] moments a lot. But we'll overcome.
[1:19:32] So,
[1:19:34] they were trying to say that we have
[1:19:36] this that's a proprietary that we got
[1:19:38] the patent on that thing. How dare they?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; But Jesus came by and said, "Oh, no. You
[1:19:45] leave them alone. For those that are for
[1:19:47] us, they're not against us.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; You just go ahead and leave them alone.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; They're doing a work that I told them to
[1:19:55] do. He didn't say that, but I I could
[1:19:57] just see that because they have to be
[1:19:59] inspired, right? They have to be
[1:20:01] inspired by his spirit to be able to do
[1:20:02] that. Now, be careful you go on your own
[1:20:05] because those spirits might say, "Now,
[1:20:08] Paul, I know. Jesus, I know.
[1:20:12] Jesse Smith. I know. Jim Schumank, I
[1:20:15] know.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Brother So and So, I know,
[1:20:20] but who are you?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; You try to come and take care of it
[1:20:24] yourself uninspired.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You're going to fail at it. Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; So, they were rebuked by that. They
[1:20:32] rebuked other people, but Jesus came and
[1:20:34] rebuked that man.
[1:20:37] Now see the disciples tried to uh uh
[1:20:39] they they came because Jesus had his
[1:20:41] face set to where he was going to go
[1:20:43] somewhere else to another city. I can't
[1:20:45] remember where he was but but into this
[1:20:48] particular story you know his his face
[1:20:51] was set to go to another city and the
[1:20:53] people of that city were kind of upset
[1:20:54] because it seems like well it doesn't
[1:20:56] seem like he's he's interested in us. So
[1:21:01] they were getting angry. So the
[1:21:02] disciples were getting angry at them for
[1:21:04] getting angry.
[1:21:07] Be angry and sin not.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; But their anger was so kindled they even
[1:21:12] asked Jesus, "Jesus, shall we not shall
[1:21:14] we cast? Shall we call down fire from
[1:21:16] heaven?" And Jesus says, "You don't even
[1:21:18] know what spirit you're of. You don't
[1:21:20] even realize what you're asking."
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Because what they were doing was the
[1:21:25] same thing what Elijah did or what they
[1:21:27] were they were thinking that they were
[1:21:28] going to do the same thing as Elijah
[1:21:30] did. But those men were coming up
[1:21:32] against a prophet.
[1:21:34] So he had to that was his defense,
[1:21:36] right?
[1:21:39] So they were wanting to do the same
[1:21:41] works as what Elijah did, not realizing
[1:21:44] what spirit they had upon them
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; just because they were upset. Now see,
[1:21:49] there's a righteous indignation that you
[1:21:51] can go on and still still be good and be
[1:21:54] righteous about it.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; But there's a there's a sin of the
[1:21:57] indignation
[1:21:59] because it says be angry and sin not.
[1:22:01] You could be in uh you could have that
[1:22:04] indignation and then you can misstep and
[1:22:07] do something wrong. Amen.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; So the influence, the inspiration being
[1:22:12] filled uh with another Satan filled
[1:22:15] Judas to betray Jesus. Saul had to
[1:22:17] receive inspiration to turn from the
[1:22:19] things Saul uh formerly Paul. He had to
[1:22:21] receive inspiration, right? Uh to turn
[1:22:24] from the things that he was doing. He
[1:22:26] thought he was doing a work for God when
[1:22:29] he was coming against the Christians. He
[1:22:31] thought he was doing a a a good work
[1:22:33] because he thought that they were
[1:22:34] heretics,
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; but he had to have a change one day.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; He had to receive the the inspiration of
[1:22:40] the Holy Spirit one day.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; And it changed his thinking. It changed
[1:22:44] his mind. It changed on how he viewed
[1:22:46] things.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; He heard and then he understood. Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Ananas and Safar,
[1:22:55] let Satan fill their heart to lie to the
[1:22:57] Holy Ghost. Even Peter said, "Ananas,
[1:22:59] why has Satan filled thine heart to lie
[1:23:01] to the Holy Ghost and to keep back a
[1:23:03] part of the price of the land?" King
[1:23:05] Agria felt so inspired, but he let it
[1:23:08] fizzle in the statement that he that it
[1:23:10] sounded good to him that he says, "Paul,
[1:23:13] you almost persuade me to be a
[1:23:16] Christian, but he couldn't go any
[1:23:17] further with it."
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; The inspiration struck. You almost
[1:23:23] persuaded me,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; but he couldn't take that extra step.
[1:23:27] Why? Because it wasn't in him. Right?
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; The sermon on the mount, Peter wanted to
[1:23:33] build three tabernacles. One for Jesus,
[1:23:35] one for Moses, one for Elijah, not
[1:23:37] knowing what he said. Why? It was an
[1:23:39] inspiration that struck him. Right?
[1:23:42] Rahab mentioned that the people of
[1:23:43] Jericho heard how the Jews God was with
[1:23:45] them. Right? They heard how they
[1:23:47] triumphed in their situations and the
[1:23:48] people of Jericho feared them because
[1:23:51] they knew what their God was capable of.
[1:23:53] But they weren't able to see it because
[1:23:55] by the time they saw it, it was a little
[1:23:56] bit too late,
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; right? But Rahab got into that same
[1:24:00] inspiration that she wanted a part of
[1:24:02] that.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; She knew where the overcoming power was
[1:24:07] and she wanted to get into that one.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; She wanted to get into that boat.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; She wanted to get with that group of
[1:24:13] people.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; I see deliverance there. I want that
[1:24:17] God. Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; That God is powerful. That God could do
[1:24:20] something. He isn't on holiday.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He's actually doing something in there.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; There's power within that God.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I want that God.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Moses had to catch real inspiration. He
[1:24:35] was taught from a young age that there
[1:24:36] was a deliver. He knew something was
[1:24:38] going to happen, but then it fell
[1:24:40] through because he thought he missed it.
[1:24:43] He thought he made a mistake, but he
[1:24:45] didn't. He Heard, but he didn't
[1:24:47] understand until he got on the back side
[1:24:49] of the desert.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; In the desperation, the in the
[1:24:52] understanding comes.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, not only Moses had
[1:24:58] to come under the inspiration, but the
[1:25:00] people that followed him
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; had to come under the same inspiration.
[1:25:04] But were there some that rebelled?
[1:25:06] Absolutely. He had to deal with Kora and
[1:25:08] Nathan.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Right. He had to deal with the
[1:25:12] rebellious spirits. But the people that
[1:25:14] followed, they had to come under the
[1:25:16] same inspiration.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Why else were the signs shown to them?
[1:25:22] They had to see the signs.
[1:25:24] And that's how they believed it. Because
[1:25:26] they knew that God was with them.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; They had to get in the same inspiration.
[1:25:31] Your pastor preaches, preaches, uh uh
[1:25:33] service after service, has ministry come
[1:25:35] in, the congregation has to get under
[1:25:37] the same inspiration.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:44] In the times of doubt, the Lord would
[1:25:46] send an angel to inspire. You think of
[1:25:47] Gideon, right? We see that through the
[1:25:49] scripture when when when men of God
[1:25:51] would would uh uh uh just lose hope if
[1:25:54] if if if that's okay to say, they would
[1:25:56] they would uh they would be uh uh uh
[1:25:58] discouraged.
[1:26:00] I say, I'm getting tired. I should
[1:26:01] probably wind down because I'm having a
[1:26:02] hard time finding words. But people
[1:26:05] would when they would get discouraged,
[1:26:07] he would send an angel,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; an encouraging angel. Right? So Gideon
[1:26:11] Gideon said, "If God be before be before
[1:26:13] us, where are all the miracles? Alas, oh
[1:26:15] Lord God, for because I have seen an
[1:26:18] angel of the Lord of h face to face.
[1:26:23] He had an experience with the Lord."
[1:26:25] Amen. He came face to face with it. He
[1:26:27] came to terms with it. He had his
[1:26:30] experience with it.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Joshua was told by an angel of the Lord,
[1:26:34] "Be strong and be not dismayed. Be
[1:26:36] strong and of a good courage." I can't
[1:26:38] even remember how many times that
[1:26:39] statement is all through the scripture.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; But a lot of it was spoken to Joshua.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Be strong and of a good courage. Think
[1:26:47] of you read in Hebrews 11, think of
[1:26:50] Barack and Jeepa and David and Samuel
[1:26:52] and Job and all these these men the the
[1:26:54] heroes of the faith, right?
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; They were of of they were men of like
[1:26:59] passions.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; They were men just like us. They weren't
[1:27:03] superhuman,
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; They had they probably had questions in
[1:27:06] their minds. Am I being led to the Lord?
[1:27:08] Is this the spirit of the Lord or is
[1:27:09] this the spirit of Satan? Is this this?
[1:27:11] Is this that? Is this it? Even John the
[1:27:13] Baptist had that struggle, right?
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Is this the one that we look for? And
[1:27:17] then Jesus had to send messengers.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; The lepers are healed.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; The blind see, the deaf ear.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; That answered his question. Yes. This is
[1:27:27] the one that we've been looking for.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to wind down. Okay. And uh in
[1:27:36] Job 1 and two, Job is described as as
[1:27:39] perfect and upright, one that feared God
[1:27:41] and assued evil. He put evil away. And
[1:27:44] and and the scripture says that there
[1:27:45] was no one else like him in the earth.
[1:27:47] God bragged on him for doing so. Satan
[1:27:49] is one that walked around to and fro.
[1:27:50] That that fellow, poor guy, don't have
[1:27:53] mercy on him. He's got to walk to and
[1:27:55] fro. Amen. Satan accused Job of being
[1:27:58] babyed and sheltered from God. And
[1:28:00] that's why Job was the way that he was.
[1:28:02] Right?
[1:28:03] So that was that was the accusation that
[1:28:05] Satan brought against Job. So God told
[1:28:07] Satan that he could have his way with
[1:28:08] him. Only he couldn't take his life. And
[1:28:10] Satan didn't waste any time. He went
[1:28:12] right on it.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Took his servants, took his family, took
[1:28:16] his uhh his riches, took everything that
[1:28:18] he had except what except his life,
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; trying to get him to curse God.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; But Job's loyalty to God was greater
[1:28:29] than the temptation of Satan. Amen. Job
[1:28:32] 3, Job begins his lamentation theology.
[1:28:36] Amen.
[1:28:37] He starts lamenting about woe is me, why
[1:28:40] am I going through all this stuff and
[1:28:42] all the things that he's speaking.
[1:28:44] Sorry, I'd labeled that as his
[1:28:46] lamentation theology.
[1:28:48] And after Job was in his lamentation, he
[1:28:50] couldn't get any word from the Lord. He
[1:28:52] didn't get any comfort from the Lord. He
[1:28:54] was so focused on his situation. The
[1:28:56] company of his three friends didn't help
[1:28:58] him any which we read about Eliu even
[1:29:00] rebuking them for saying so. You said
[1:29:02] all this stuff but yet you had nothing
[1:29:04] to say.
[1:29:07] They were accusing him of being a secret
[1:29:08] sinner. So Job was trying to just him
[1:29:10] justify himself rather than God. Right?
[1:29:13] Seeing himself righteous in his own
[1:29:15] eyes.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; So that's what Eliu had enough. Not only
[1:29:19] was he angry with Job, but he was also
[1:29:20] angry with his three friends.
[1:29:24] because they were guessing.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Now, the inspiration of God, it comes
[1:29:30] true every time.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; They were just guessing. They didn't
[1:29:34] have the inspiration.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; They were guessing. Well, how do you
[1:29:39] know a prophet is a true prophet by what
[1:29:42] he says if it comes to pass or not?
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, inspiration struck Eliu
[1:29:49] that it came and rebuked these men. You
[1:29:52] just you just uttered all these things,
[1:29:54] labelled him as a hypocrite, but had
[1:29:56] nothing to say. You really had no answer
[1:29:59] for him.
[1:30:01] You could have at least said, "Hey,
[1:30:03] brother, we're here with you." Yeah. But
[1:30:06] I don't know. It was just criticism
[1:30:07] after criticism after criticism. It was
[1:30:10] hammer, hammer, hammer.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Where's the word of encouragement?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:17] See, Eliu right at that moment, he
[1:30:19] didn't have a respector. He wasn't a
[1:30:20] respector of persons, right? He just
[1:30:23] came and threw the rebuke.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; He had respect, but he didn't have
[1:30:28] respect of persons. He respect them as
[1:30:31] because they were elders. He even he
[1:30:33] even said himself that I kept myself
[1:30:35] quiet. I let you say these things. I'm
[1:30:38] talking to the young ones and even to
[1:30:40] the older ones. You know, there are some
[1:30:42] people that just have no respect.
[1:30:45] You know, when you're talking to people,
[1:30:46] they just come and they just jump right
[1:30:48] into the conversation,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; right? When one of you is talking,
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; you know, and they don't care what
[1:30:53] you're saying. They just jump right into
[1:30:55] the conversation. No respect at all.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Zero. If they had an ounce of respect,
[1:31:01] they would have waited until the person
[1:31:02] finished.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't know why I'm teaching
[1:31:06] manners here, but you know, but that
[1:31:08] that's like a basic manner that you
[1:31:10] teach your young ones. Yes.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Wait until the older one is done
[1:31:13] speaking. Then you could say, "Excuse
[1:31:16] me.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; May I say something?"
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; That's the way it should be. That's a
[1:31:22] good example right there. Eliu kept
[1:31:24] himself quiet. Let the elders speak,
[1:31:27] brother. Sorry, I I don't mean to take
[1:31:29] your spot there. That's a pastoral spot
[1:31:32] right there.
[1:31:35] But you understand what I mean,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; he had respect. And oh my, that's I just
[1:31:40] think Eliu is a is a very good example
[1:31:42] in the scripture right there.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know when the re when the
[1:31:47] Lord came and brought his rebuke, Eliu
[1:31:50] wasn't in the rebuke
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; because he conducted himself with good
[1:31:57] manners.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He conducted himself with respect.
[1:32:01] Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; God isn't a respector of persons, but he
[1:32:05] respects respect.
[1:32:07] You have respect unto the Lord. God
[1:32:09] demands respect, right? So when we show
[1:32:12] respect unto the Lord, let me tell you
[1:32:13] something. This whole thing, I could go
[1:32:15] through this. I'm just going to cover it
[1:32:16] in in in a nutshell here. Pretty much
[1:32:18] what it's saying is if you bring a a a
[1:32:22] repentance unto the Lord, you might have
[1:32:24] done some wrongs.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; You might have done some wrongs, but if
[1:32:29] you can humble yourself and say, "Lord,
[1:32:32] I have done wrong. Please forgive me."
[1:32:34] Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Repentance will bring favor of God.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you humbled yourself and
[1:32:40] you gave respect.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:50] I would encourage you to read Job. You
[1:32:52] know, it's only 40, what is it? 42
[1:32:55] chapters long. 42 43 42 vers or chapters
[1:32:58] long. Not verses. Brother, you lied to
[1:33:01] us. There's more than 42 verses.
[1:33:05] There's 42 chapters,
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; but there's some good stuff in there.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of it is repetitive. I I
[1:33:12] give you that. I I I understand that.
[1:33:14] Like, it took it took a whole chapter
[1:33:16] for Elijah to to say what he was trying
[1:33:18] to say
[1:33:21] before he even got started and say what
[1:33:22] he wanted to say.
[1:33:25] I I understand that.
[1:33:27] uh job in Job in 38 that's when God
[1:33:30] starts to rebuke Job. So I just wanted
[1:33:33] to uh in Job chapter 40 in the third
[1:33:37] verse he says then Job answered the Lord
[1:33:40] and said behold I am vile.
[1:33:43] He says I am vile. What shall I answer
[1:33:46] thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
[1:33:50] Once I have spoken I will not answer.
[1:33:54] He said I've already spoke once. I'm
[1:33:56] just going to keep quiet right here. I'm
[1:33:58] not going to say anymore. I done dug
[1:34:00] myself a hole. I got myself in trouble.
[1:34:03] I'm just going to keep quiet. Lord,
[1:34:05] whatever you say, that's what goes. Now,
[1:34:08] he's saying, once have I spoken, but I
[1:34:10] will not answer. Yay. Twice, but I will
[1:34:12] proceed no further.
[1:34:15] Amen. And now, we're going to get to the
[1:34:17] opening scripture
[1:34:20] uh sooner or later,
[1:34:23] I guess. Well, it's it's the second
[1:34:25] portion.
[1:34:28] Job 42.
[1:34:31] In the first verse, he says, "Then Job
[1:34:33] answered,
[1:34:36] Then Job answered the Lord and said, I
[1:34:38] know that thou canst do everything, and
[1:34:41] that no thought can be withholden from
[1:34:43] thee. Who is he that hideth counsel
[1:34:45] without knowledge? Therefore, have I
[1:34:46] uttered that I understood not? I uttered
[1:34:49] those things which I didn't understand.
[1:34:52] Things too wonderful for me which I knew
[1:34:53] not. Here I beseech thee. I will speak.
[1:34:56] I will demand of thee and declare thou
[1:34:58] unto me. I have heard of thee by the
[1:35:00] hearing of the ear, but now mine eyes
[1:35:02] seeth thee. Wherefore I abore myself and
[1:35:05] repent and dust and ashes.
[1:35:11] Amen.
[1:35:15] See, we we've got to get beyond the head
[1:35:18] knowledge. You know, a lot of it's up
[1:35:21] here, but we got to get beyond that.
[1:35:22] We've got to let it drop down into our
[1:35:24] heart.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; But people, until you see it for
[1:35:27] yourself, and I and I know that most of
[1:35:30] you, I don't know where everybody's
[1:35:31] sitting, but until you see it for
[1:35:33] yourself, until you see him for
[1:35:36] yourself, he is someone else's God. You
[1:35:39] read through the promises, those are
[1:35:41] someone else's prom promises. until you
[1:35:44] see it for yourself, he becomes yours.
[1:35:47] Those promises become yours.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; So don't make it just a head knowledge,
[1:35:52] but it got to be on the inside.
[1:35:55] Amen.
[1:35:56] So
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to find a good place to
[1:36:02] close here.
[1:36:11] you know, when we get into the types of
[1:36:12] those situations of, you know, uh, in
[1:36:16] Job's situation where it feels like
[1:36:18] we're just down, we're discouraged,
[1:36:19] we're disheartened, we're in despair.
[1:36:24] We wonder how we get into those
[1:36:26] conditions, you know, and then we start
[1:36:28] feeling about the feeling the same way
[1:36:31] that Job did.
[1:36:33] But Job asked where is where is the one
[1:36:36] whom I believed? Where is the God that I
[1:36:38] have lived my life for? Where is my God
[1:36:40] in whom I have put my trust? You feel
[1:36:42] lost. These are some of the questions
[1:36:44] that the heroes of the faith people
[1:36:46] renown in the scripture. These are the
[1:36:47] same questions that they were asking.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Where is my God? Where is the God of the
[1:36:52] Bible? Where is the God of that laid out
[1:36:54] these promises? Where is the God? Where
[1:36:56] is the one whom I have put my trust in?
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Because you might feel lost. You might
[1:37:01] feel abandoned. You might feel that he's
[1:37:02] far from you and that he doesn't love
[1:37:05] you anymore. That's not true. These are
[1:37:08] the trying times of faith. This is where
[1:37:10] the older eagles drop down. They they
[1:37:12] have had the same experience and they
[1:37:14] drop down the meat to the other eagles
[1:37:16] during the moping period. I don't have I
[1:37:18] ever preached that message here? I don't
[1:37:20] think I have. Well, Lord willing. Wait a
[1:37:23] second. Did something change? Didn't you
[1:37:26] have an eagle hanging up? Wasn't that
[1:37:28] y'all? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe that was
[1:37:30] somewhere else.
[1:37:32] Okay,
[1:37:34] that must have been somewhere else.
[1:37:35] Sorry.
[1:37:37] But there there's something about the
[1:37:39] the the the way that eagles are and it's
[1:37:42] and it's a wonderful type because the
[1:37:44] older eagles, they get into what's
[1:37:46] called a moping period and they're
[1:37:48] they're discard they're discard dis oh
[1:37:50] goodness disheartened. Let me say that
[1:37:52] one first. Seems how it wants to come
[1:37:54] out first. They were discouraged. They
[1:37:57] were they're having a hard time. They
[1:37:58] they just feel like they can't fly
[1:38:00] anymore. They're just so weak they can't
[1:38:01] do anything. But the older eagles that
[1:38:03] have gone through that experience, they
[1:38:05] are the ones that go and they get the
[1:38:07] fresh meat.
[1:38:09] They get the fresh meat and then they
[1:38:11] drop it down to these ones that are
[1:38:13] going through the moping period. Not all
[1:38:15] the not all the ones that are going
[1:38:16] through the moping period overcome.
[1:38:19] But the ones that have a will, the ones
[1:38:21] that have a drive, the ones that want to
[1:38:22] stay alive, they'll eat the fresh meat.
[1:38:25] And then when they start partaking of
[1:38:26] the fresh meat, they tend to they they
[1:38:28] become strong. They become encouraged.
[1:38:30] They they they get to be able to start
[1:38:32] flapping their wings again. Their eyes
[1:38:34] are becoming open again. It's a
[1:38:36] renewing. It's a refreshing.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's where the experienced ones come
[1:38:42] in. Say, "I've been in your shoes
[1:38:44] before. I've had that experience before.
[1:38:47] This is how I got out of it. Let me
[1:38:50] encourage you a little bit. Let me give
[1:38:51] you a little bit of meat of the word."
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They drop down the meat and
[1:38:56] it just strengthens those eagles during
[1:38:58] the moping period
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; to where they can rise up one more time.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; They can flap their wings and get into
[1:39:04] the skies where they belong.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] But this is the time when we need to
[1:39:10] inspire one another. This is where we
[1:39:12] need to unify. I'm not talking just this
[1:39:14] body of believers. I'm talking the body
[1:39:16] of believers. This is a many membered
[1:39:17] bride. I'm talking about believers
[1:39:19] across the world. You hear when somebody
[1:39:21] has a has a a need of prayer, we go to
[1:39:23] pray for him, right? We pray for the
[1:39:25] bride across the whole world.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is the time where we
[1:39:31] admonish one another in psalms and hymns
[1:39:33] and spiritual songs, which is what we're
[1:39:35] instructed to do in the scriptures,
[1:39:36] right? Singing with grace into our
[1:39:38] hearts unto the Lord.
[1:39:41] This is where we need to find
[1:39:42] inspiration in the Lord. Inspiration to
[1:39:44] sing out and praise him. This is the
[1:39:46] time to recognize who he is and our
[1:39:48] position in him. Amen.
[1:39:51] Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; You know that's how songs
[1:39:56] and hymns came about was through
[1:39:58] adversity.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; It as well comes to my mind. A man that
[1:40:05] loses his family, but yet he can still
[1:40:08] write a song that encourages hundreds
[1:40:12] and thousands and millions that it is
[1:40:15] well with my soul.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. It's through adversity
[1:40:21] where people were able to receive an
[1:40:24] inspiration to write these songs, to
[1:40:27] write poems,
[1:40:29] to write different books, to encourage
[1:40:32] and inspire others.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So inspiration is a good thing as
[1:40:38] long as you are in the way of
[1:40:40] righteousness. Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I've taken a long time. I'm
[1:40:44] going to close with this.
[1:40:49] Second Timothy chapter 1
[1:40:52] and verse 12, it says, "For the which
[1:40:54] cause I also suffer these things.
[1:40:57] Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I
[1:40:59] know whom I have believed, and I am
[1:41:02] persuaded that he is able to keep that
[1:41:04] which I have committed unto him against
[1:41:06] that day. Hold fast the form of sound
[1:41:09] words which thou has heard of me in
[1:41:11] faith and in love which is in Christ
[1:41:14] Jesus. That good thing which was
[1:41:17] committed unto thee, keep by the Holy
[1:41:20] Ghost which dwelleth in us. Amen. Let's
[1:41:23] stand to your feet.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:32] You might get tired of thinking
[1:41:33] wondering if God is real. I know we have
[1:41:35] young ones sitting here. You know, you
[1:41:37] hear the older ones talk about the
[1:41:38] goodness of the Lord and
[1:41:41] you you hear other people's testimonies
[1:41:44] of different things that of good things.
[1:41:46] You know, you hear these things that
[1:41:47] have happened in people's lives. I' I
[1:41:49] think I've said it here before. Don't go
[1:41:52] try to have a testimony like what I
[1:41:54] have, like what brother David has, like
[1:41:56] what my wife has.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; You need to have find your testimony.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Don't go seeking one like what I have. I
[1:42:04] was in the world.
[1:42:07] You have a better, stronger testimony
[1:42:11] when you can keep yourself from the
[1:42:13] things of the world.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; People that have gone out of the world
[1:42:16] are scarred from the things that they
[1:42:20] endured.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Don't go looking for those things. Be
[1:42:26] content with what the Lord has done for
[1:42:28] you. It's stronger than what you think.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:34] If you maintain that testimony,
[1:42:38] oh, yours would be better than mine any
[1:42:42] day.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Any day. Because I would love to say
[1:42:47] that I was unmarked from the things of
[1:42:49] the world. I would love to be able to
[1:42:51] say I never picked up a cigarette. I
[1:42:54] would love to say I never picked up an
[1:42:55] adult book.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; I would love to say that I never drank
[1:43:01] alcohol for pleasure.
[1:43:04] I would love to say that I didn't do the
[1:43:07] things that I did.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; So keep yourselves pure, unspotted from
[1:43:12] the things of the world.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Greater is your testimony. Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; But you might be tired of hearing
[1:43:19] somebody else's testimony and you're
[1:43:21] wondering, you might be wondering when
[1:43:23] am I going to have my testimony.
[1:43:27] You've got your testimony. When you say,
[1:43:29] "I love to o when the doors of the the
[1:43:32] house of worship open, I'm glad to be in
[1:43:35] the house of the Lord." That's a
[1:43:36] testimony. When you could say, "I'm
[1:43:39] happy to sing praises unto God without
[1:43:41] things of the world, things that I've
[1:43:43] done, mistakes that I've done coming and
[1:43:45] clouding your mind, you're free of those
[1:43:47] things."
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; You can worship more freely.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Because we're struggling with those
[1:43:54] things in our minds.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, when you when you it you
[1:43:58] think it's easy for me to come preach
[1:44:00] these things. How many times have I
[1:44:02] thought of myself as a hypocrite
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; trying to get your to get your foothold
[1:44:09] in Christ? How many times I think of
[1:44:12] myself as a hypocrite knowing that I've
[1:44:14] done some of those things
[1:44:18] is not easy for somebody that was out in
[1:44:21] the world. You think it's easy to come
[1:44:23] and minister the things that I do. You
[1:44:25] know how many spirits, brother, you
[1:44:27] could attest to it. You You know how
[1:44:28] many spirits are battling up here?
[1:44:31] Just to bring you the word of grace.
[1:44:34] Just to bring you the word of the Lord.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a breakthrough. It's not an
[1:44:39] easy job.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I was naive when I first
[1:44:42] started ministering, not realizing. I
[1:44:44] don't know why I'm going on, but it's
[1:44:46] it's it's not an easy thing to do,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Well, people just they they have the
[1:44:52] wrong idea about it. Well, well, I have
[1:44:54] so many thoughts I could be sermons. Did
[1:44:57] an anointing strike it?
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Did an inspiration strike it? Then it's
[1:45:02] not going to do me any good.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Words are just that, words.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Until some quickening life comes behind
[1:45:10] it.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; That's what makes it come alive.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I don't know why I said
[1:45:17] those things,
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; but what I want to say is you might be
[1:45:22] looking at somebody else's testimony and
[1:45:24] thinking, "Why can't I experience those
[1:45:26] things?" You're having your own
[1:45:29] experiences right now to where somebody
[1:45:31] else might say, "Why can't I have that
[1:45:33] experience?
[1:45:35] You can't be me. I can't be you. You
[1:45:37] can't be brother Jesse. You can't be
[1:45:39] brother Jose. You can't be I don't know
[1:45:41] your name, brother, but you can't be
[1:45:42] brother Malachi. And I can't remember
[1:45:44] your name, brother, but you can't be
[1:45:46] somebody else. You have to live in your
[1:45:49] moment, in your life.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; You're developing your relationship with
[1:45:53] the Lord.
[1:45:55] Don't try to look at somebody else's
[1:45:57] testimony and say, "Why can't I be
[1:45:59] there?" You just be content and say,
[1:46:01] "Thank you, Lord, that you have kept me
[1:46:03] from these things and you've brought me
[1:46:05] here."
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; And if you're here, you're in a good
[1:46:09] spot.
[1:46:13] Now, see, when I was young, I understand
[1:46:14] you were forced to come to church. Don't
[1:46:17] raise your hands, little ones.
[1:46:21] But if you weren't forced to come to
[1:46:23] church because mommy and daddy goes to
[1:46:25] church and they can't leave you at home
[1:46:26] by yourself,
[1:46:29] would you still want to come to church?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Would you still want to come to church?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Now, you older ones, here I go again.
[1:46:42] bringing it right now. If so and so
[1:46:45] doesn't see me at church, are going to
[1:46:47] they are they going to think less
[1:46:48] spiritual? Am I are they going to think
[1:46:50] that I'm less spiritual?
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Are they going to think that I'm serpent
[1:46:54] seed because I didn't show up to church?
[1:46:56] Well, I better go to church. If you're
[1:46:58] thinking that, then you're coming for
[1:46:59] the wrong reason.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; The real genuine reason why you can't
[1:47:05] wait for the doors to open is because
[1:47:06] you want to hear the word of God.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; You want to come and worship. You want
[1:47:11] to become better than what you than what
[1:47:13] you came in.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; You want to change your condition.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; And I've gone on. I've gone on. So
[1:47:21] So I just thank the Lord for all that
[1:47:24] he's done. Thank you for letting me yell
[1:47:26] at you one more time.
[1:47:29] But shouting, I just get excited
[1:47:31] sometimes. But remember, you can't judge
[1:47:34] the quality of a service by how much a a
[1:47:37] minister shouts or how excited they get.
[1:47:39] You know, and people get addicted to
[1:47:41] those things. I think I've talked about
[1:47:42] here that here before, but we be careful
[1:47:45] of those things. But what is the fruit
[1:47:46] of it? My whole purpose, my whole drive,
[1:47:49] the whole inspiration that drives me is
[1:47:52] has it made a difference in your life?
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; That's the question that I want you to
[1:47:57] ask yourself. Lord, what what was spoken
[1:47:59] here this morning, is that going to have
[1:48:02] an impact for the positive in my life?
[1:48:04] What is it in my life that I need to
[1:48:06] change today before I even walk out of
[1:48:08] here that I want to walk out of here in
[1:48:10] a better condition than when I showed
[1:48:12] up?
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. As the musicians come
[1:48:15] and brother Jesse, if you want,
[1:48:20] let's bow our heads.
[1:48:23] Most gracious heavenly father. Lord, I
[1:48:25] just I' I've gone on for a long time,
[1:48:27] but uh Lord, I just uh pray that it was
[1:48:30] of good substance,
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; but Lord, I more importantly, I pray
[1:48:34] that it was your spirit speaking these
[1:48:36] things through my lips. Father, I I know
[1:48:38] I spoke things as as a man in human
[1:48:41] flesh, but Lord, may I have been moved
[1:48:43] by inspiration of your Holy Spirit. May
[1:48:46] it be God breathed. But Lord, I just
[1:48:48] pray that there was an impact on
[1:48:50] somebody's life here for the positive
[1:48:52] today that they have seen something that
[1:48:54] they have heard something that they not
[1:48:56] only heard but they see and it turns
[1:48:59] into understanding.
[1:49:01] Being able to see is understanding. But
[1:49:04] Lord, I just pray that something has
[1:49:06] changed somebody today.
[1:49:10] Father, we know that there's nothing
[1:49:11] good in me except what you've placed in
[1:49:13] in in in in my life, oh God. And I just
[1:49:16] thank you and I appreciate you. But
[1:49:18] Lord, I pray that you would be with the
[1:49:20] young ones here today,
[1:49:22] Lord. Some may have no desire to be here
[1:49:29] because they're forced to come here.
[1:49:30] Lord, some might have a have have the
[1:49:33] desire to to want to leave up quick and
[1:49:36] in a hurry. But there are others that
[1:49:39] have a desire to stay here. And I thank
[1:49:41] you for those that have that desire. But
[1:49:43] the ones that don't have the desire for
[1:49:45] you, I pray that today would be a
[1:49:47] changing time in their life. That they
[1:49:49] would have a a hunger and a thirst for
[1:49:52] Jesus Christ. That they would have a
[1:49:54] hunger and a thirst for the word of God.
[1:49:56] That they would have a hunger and a
[1:49:58] thirst for the inspiration of your
[1:50:00] spirit to come into their lives. Lord,
[1:50:01] maybe they'll write a song. Lord, maybe
[1:50:03] they'll write a poem. Maybe they'll
[1:50:05] they'll they'll they'll write a book.
[1:50:07] Maybe they'll they'll they'll do
[1:50:08] something else that encourages somebody
[1:50:11] else. But Lord, when we when we receive
[1:50:13] the inspiration, may it may not just be
[1:50:16] a hearing, but may we act upon it. May
[1:50:19] it be a true inspiration when when a
[1:50:21] when a great excitement comes upon us
[1:50:23] that we that we have we can't do
[1:50:25] anything but what you want us to do, oh
[1:50:28] Lord. Father, may we be found uh uh uh
[1:50:31] uh faithful being about the father's
[1:50:33] business, Lord. May we just be faithful,
[1:50:35] found in your word, found reading and
[1:50:38] praying and waiting for you to come. May
[1:50:41] that may we be like the servants uh uh
[1:50:43] just waiting for your appearance to to
[1:50:45] arrive. Oh God, Lord, we just love you.
[1:50:47] We appreciate you. We ask that you would
[1:50:49] bless the ministry that would come
[1:50:50] through come through this place, be with
[1:50:52] the pastor, just help him and lead him
[1:50:54] and guide him as as the shepherd of this
[1:50:56] flock. Continue to give him revelation.
[1:50:58] Continue to to be with him that he would
[1:51:00] speak boldness with grace from his
[1:51:02] mouth. the thing the oracles of God Lord
[1:51:04] as you lay it upon his heart father as
[1:51:06] we depart from here uh uh may we never
[1:51:08] depart from your presence may but may
[1:51:10] you always be with us and about us oh
[1:51:12] God giving us h
[1:51:16] giving us encouragement giving us safety
[1:51:18] where wherever we would go and may we
[1:51:20] always have uh something nice to say
