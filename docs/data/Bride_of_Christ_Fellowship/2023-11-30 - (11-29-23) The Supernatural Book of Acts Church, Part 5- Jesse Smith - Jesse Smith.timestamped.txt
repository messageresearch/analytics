[0:00] Supernatural book of Acts church I think
[0:02] it's part five or four
[0:08] five I had a different thought I was
[0:10] going to preach a different thought
[0:11] tonight and I started studying like a I
[0:13] just start read through acts six like
[0:15] all these thoughts that coming to me
[0:17] that's normally how God works not always
[0:19] but I just kind of felt more inspiration
[0:21] here as I went to that thought tonight
[0:26] so acts 6
[0:28] verse1
[0:31] I love Acts chapter 6 because it shows
[0:33] here's a side of the church that we
[0:35] normally don't think about when we think
[0:37] book of Acts Church our first thought
[0:39] usually isn't
[0:41] murmuring is that your first thought
[0:43] when someone preaches on you're the book
[0:45] of Acts church it's your first thought
[0:47] murmuring and disputing that's usually
[0:50] your last thought right or my last
[0:52] thought but this is something to
[0:54] remember even amongst the people that
[0:56] had the full power of the Holy Ghost
[0:58] we'd say the people that were most
[1:00] yielded to God the very birth the very
[1:03] uh U infancy of the church There Rose up
[1:06] sin right there's just they're they're
[1:09] still Sinners saved by grace how many
[1:11] believe they're Sinners saved by grace
[1:13] yes no doubt um and so here we'll start
[1:16] with this and then we'll kind of see how
[1:18] the Lord directs
[1:20] here acts 6 verse
[1:24] one this is really I think the first if
[1:26] I'm not mistaken as I've preached this
[1:28] and been reviewing this this might be
[1:30] the first kind of like sin we see in the
[1:33] book of Acts Church other than ananas
[1:35] and sa fire right but of course I'm not
[1:37] sure if they were actually part of the
[1:39] church I'm I'm more inclined to think
[1:42] they were just like Judas they kind of
[1:43] sold out and they got filled with Satan
[1:46] like Judas did I'm more inclined to
[1:48] think that but either way acts
[1:53] 6 we'll just read verse one by God's
[1:55] grace just to preserve our time it's
[1:57] already
[1:58] 7:05 that's read that on three 1 2 3 and
[2:02] in those days when the number of the
[2:05] disciples was multiplied there arose a
[2:08] murmuring of the grecians against the
[2:11] Hebrews because their widows were
[2:14] neglected in the daily minist God
[2:18] blessing ring of
[2:23] hisek so
[2:25] I my a few times please forgive
[2:28] me
[2:35] so we'll try to look at this thought
[2:36] here tonight here our by the grace of
[2:39] the Lord again it's good to see all the
[2:41] saints here tonight appreciate everybody
[2:43] coming out to the house of the Lord
[2:45] hopefully hope hopefully you're looking
[2:46] forward to Sunday where brother Samuel
[2:48] coming and you know I were texting back
[2:50] and forth he's really looking forward to
[2:51] coming remember he's got three boys
[2:53] they're kind of malkey age they're kind
[2:55] of malkey buddies and I thought that's
[2:57] another good reason to get him out here
[2:59] fellowship and also want to give Mali
[3:02] some boy
[3:03] time he's got amen amen also like his
[3:06] older brothers you know but it's nice to
[3:09] have those teenage buddies with him and
[3:11] you can have some fellowship there by
[3:13] God's grace so we're looking forward to
[3:15] it you know it's been a while since we
[3:16] had brother Samuel I'm looking forward
[3:18] to hearing him Minister I was listening
[3:20] to a couple of his sermons last week and
[3:22] really enjoyed what I was
[3:24] here so uh we look at this thought here
[3:26] the supernatural book of Acts church is
[3:28] part five starting in verse one but I
[3:31] want to review just by reading this
[3:32] quote again from the church age book uh
[3:34] brother Bram says this he says the true
[3:38] church would always try to be like it
[3:41] was in the book of Acts that is exactly
[3:46] rightel and so the book of Acts is our
[3:49] blueprint brother Rand callon I don't
[3:52] work with blueprints I know Simon does
[3:54] extensively so Simon could teach us a
[3:56] good lesson on
[3:57] blueprints he has to study the blue
[3:59] blueprints over and over again the
[4:01] length of the pipes he's talked about it
[4:02] briefly I'll just that's all I can
[4:04] really remember he's got to get all the
[4:06] measurements all the layers everything
[4:08] all the pipes all the
[4:10] connections and so that's church that's
[4:12] what I as a pastor for 17 years I've
[4:15] tried to always look at the book of Acts
[4:16] and say uh what can our church do to be
[4:18] more like the book of Acts that's been
[4:20] my pattern amen and by God's grace I
[4:23] believe we're following it as closely as
[4:25] possible as close as I know how and
[4:27] remember on Wednesday I said there are
[4:28] some things there's Liberties right
[4:30] there's so much Liberty in the gospel
[4:32] and I gave the examples of how brother
[4:34] brandom asked the angel how should I do
[4:36] prayer lines and the angel said just as
[4:37] you're
[4:38] LED you didn't tell them so there was in
[4:41] other words there was no specific
[4:42] pattern in the book of Acts for prayer
[4:44] lines but God allows the the liberty and
[4:47] the freedom of different gifts of the
[4:49] holy spirit remember the Bible said
[4:51] there's Gifts of healing so they're not
[4:53] just one there's different kinds brother
[4:55] said some people he said well have the
[4:57] Bulldog Faith like or Roberts I don't
[4:59] know I if You' seen old Roberts you know
[5:00] some of the old videos but he'll just
[5:02] he'll put his hands on the person's head
[5:03] and he'll just yell at the Devil brother
[5:06] said at the beginning he got good
[5:07] results because he had Bulldog faith
[5:10] that was just one expression now brother
[5:11] RAM on the other side you never hear
[5:13] Brother Ram yell at the de the devil do
[5:14] you he just says Satan you know I rebuke
[5:18] you Satan I jur you by the name of Jesus
[5:20] Christ leave the person and then he says
[5:22] go on your way rejoicing you're made
[5:23] well amen so he never had to raise his
[5:26] voice like
[5:28] that uh but then you know our Roberts
[5:31] would kind of have that Bulldog Faith
[5:33] now my Ministry I'm more of a
[5:36] yeller at least in the times God
[5:38] answered my some of my
[5:40] prayers um not always you know pardon
[5:46] me but you just look at that you know so
[5:48] we have a blueprint but then there's
[5:50] areas of freedom and areas of Liberty so
[5:53] we want to keep that in mind as well and
[5:55] I think cam did a great job when he
[5:56] taught on the Sunday school you know the
[5:58] the youth activities there's liberty in
[6:01] that right and so that's what we
[6:03] experien you know we had our first youth
[6:05] meeting amen did an awesome job sister
[6:07] who to don't to leave you out you're
[6:09] both do a good job on that but that
[6:11] that's kind of the idea there and
[6:12] brother Ram even said Sunday school is
[6:14] not in the book of Acts anybody ever
[6:15] seen Sunday School in the book of Acts
[6:17] it's not in there so what is it it's an
[6:19] area of Liberty but you don't want to
[6:21] make that uh with with each thing you
[6:23] don't want to make it a tradition that
[6:26] loses its its sincerity okay okay uh so
[6:30] that's how it is with youth youth events
[6:32] and honestly this is why I told
[6:33] different Brothers I said you know some
[6:34] of the churches that are having the
[6:36] message churches now that are having
[6:37] some good revivals if they're not
[6:39] careful now what it looks like to me
[6:40] they're eventually going to get to the
[6:41] spot where all the emotion and
[6:43] excitement dies down and they're going
[6:45] have to go through this cycle again yes
[6:47] right every church has to go through
[6:49] I've seen it in our church I've seen in
[6:50] other churches it's just going through
[6:52] that cycle you got to go through the
[6:54] cycle because with with humans we just
[6:57] naturally get used to it things just
[6:59] become common to us but thank God we can
[7:02] always kind of shake ourselves off go
[7:04] talk to Jesus and come back to the
[7:06] blueprint and say Lord I want this again
[7:08] hallelujah amen bring me back to the
[7:11] sincerity brother said never forget the
[7:13] Wonder of the book of Acts The Wonder of
[7:16] the Holy Ghost right
[7:19] Hallelujah and so there's you know with
[7:21] within this blueprint I love it God
[7:23] gives us Liberty of
[7:25] expression uh because there's different
[7:27] size churches there's big churches
[7:28] there's small churches thank God he
[7:30] loves small churches too in fact the the
[7:32] book of Acts church was almost all small
[7:34] churches so we can we can we have that
[7:37] you know ability to say well we're most
[7:38] like the book of Acts in that way
[7:41] although it's not you know it's not a
[7:42] requirement or anything just an
[7:44] encouragement that we should do
[7:46] everything we should always try to be
[7:48] like it was in the book of Acts praise
[7:52] God now I just did this today and I want
[7:54] to make this as I go through the book of
[7:55] Acts Lord willing uh sometimes I stop in
[7:58] the middle of my series and I leave it
[7:59] and I'll come back to it but I just made
[8:02] a list of the different nine spiritual
[8:04] gifts that we've seen in the book of
[8:05] Acts thus far okay acts 24 we had
[8:08] tongues and we had I guess it was
[8:10] interpretation right I guess it was the
[8:12] miracle was in the speaking and the
[8:13] hearing right so that tongues and
[8:15] interpretation oh actually want to add
[8:18] that because they did hear that um in
[8:22] chapter two uh then the Holy Ghost said
[8:24] you're going to have prophecy dreams and
[8:26] visions and we had those praise God you
[8:28] had those
[8:30] Hallelujah uh now this is not these are
[8:32] not the nine gifts but Doctrine was in
[8:34] chapter 2 verse 42 and then teaching the
[8:37] angel let them out of jail we saw this
[8:39] on Sunday the angel let them out of jail
[8:40] and said go teach in the temple amen
[8:43] right so there's teaching that's now
[8:44] that's the five bold ministry right but
[8:46] I just want to bring those out too not
[8:47] only did you have Miracles tongues
[8:49] Visions prophecies but you have teaching
[8:51] too uh acts 32-7 and acts 4:16 and 22
[8:55] the miracle of the lame man walked and
[8:58] leaped he never walked before but God
[9:01] the Bible called it a notable
[9:03] Miracle right or you might even call
[9:05] that a sign Wonder or
[9:08] Miracle now to me I'm just thinking
[9:10] about it now I think when God heal my
[9:11] mom of cancer that was a sign to Liberty
[9:14] Center that or that local area that was
[9:17] a sign and look what God did God brought
[9:19] three preachers out of that woman maybe
[9:22] more we're still waiting on a couple
[9:24] more Lord
[9:27] willing if they're watching this you
[9:28] know I love you Brothers Hallelujah
[9:31] that's my
[9:32] desire that was a sign that was a Wonder
[9:35] right and it even led to my friend's dad
[9:37] I told you that story of brother ainson
[9:39] Mr ainson him being healed too because I
[9:43] testified of that to him right before he
[9:44] almost died and then Simon went and
[9:46] prayed for him in chapter five Peter had
[9:48] discernment of the lie so there's one of
[9:51] the nine gifts so got Tong's
[9:53] interpretation prophecy we have Miracles
[9:56] discernment Right There is five out of
[9:58] the nine
[10:01] uh and then
[10:02] uh people got healed just by being in
[10:05] Peter's Shadow which the shadow has no
[10:08] virtue to it the prayer cloth has no
[10:11] virtue to it right being baptized in
[10:13] water the water has no virtue to it the
[10:14] church that amen God just uses that as a
[10:19] sign Wonder or Miracle amen amen so that
[10:22] you and I would stand in awe of God amen
[10:26] hallelujah
[10:28] amen and that brings us up to chapter
[10:30] six so just in those first five chapters
[10:34] we already have five out of the nine
[10:36] gifts have already been manifested now
[10:38] who knows how many does anybody remember
[10:39] how many years does the book of Acts
[10:41] cover from chapter one to chapter 28
[10:43] does anybody remember how many 30 was it
[10:47] 30 or 28 what were you goingon to say h
[10:50] oh you know okay I thought say you say
[10:51] 30 I thought it was 30 scopio talks
[10:53] about it I just wanted I thought it was
[10:56] 28 but I could be wrong on that let me
[10:58] go check
[11:00] oh yeah well Scofield says 32 so real
[11:02] good real good that's good that's right
[11:04] on because Scofield is not God so think
[11:07] about that so already in the first few
[11:09] chapters we've already got five of the
[11:11] nine gifts
[11:12] operating and I went through a couple
[11:14] years ago and I wrote that book we've
[11:16] had all nine operate here in our 17
[11:19] years of
[11:21] ministry so where people get hung up is
[11:24] where brother Ram will say you know all
[11:26] nine gifts need to be operating in every
[11:28] uh every Church well that's a good
[11:30] thought that's a that's a great desire
[11:32] but even brother Bram said we don't even
[11:34] have those in our church two years
[11:36] before he died in 1963 he said we don't
[11:38] have too many operating in our
[11:42] church isn't that something you know so
[11:44] we can see that okay now now you know
[11:46] having nine nine gifts operating every
[11:49] service that that's that was what we
[11:50] would call maybe ideal I'm not even sure
[11:52] if that's that ever happened in the book
[11:54] of Acts I'm not even sure right I can't
[11:57] prove it in other words I can't prove it
[11:58] by by the Bible the Bible never says
[12:00] Thou shalt have all nine gifts operating
[12:02] every service Church said so see that
[12:06] see that area of Liberty now we're
[12:07] talking about see that so we got to be
[12:09] careful not to add to the word of God
[12:13] right or and we don't want to take away
[12:14] either don't want to take away but if
[12:16] we're going to be Bible Believers if
[12:17] we're going if we're really going to
[12:18] believe the Bible let's point back to
[12:19] the blueprint
[12:23] amen all right now chapter one I'm sorry
[12:25] chapter 6 verse one sorry I bet verse
[12:27] one
[12:30] uh in those days when the number of the
[12:32] disciples was multiplied there arose a
[12:35] murmuring you see what brother like what
[12:37] they say more people more problems right
[12:40] less people less problems that's true
[12:43] cam told me that he's like wow brother
[12:44] Jess he said you have a smart Church
[12:46] than us and I have all these problems he
[12:47] said he said it's true even if you have
[12:50] a few more it's more
[12:52] problems church you've been a wonderful
[12:54] Church by God's grace wonderful group of
[12:56] saints here we hardly have any problems
[12:58] by God's Gra
[12:59] so what does that tell me that means
[13:00] you're mature in the faith right you
[13:02] settle your problems one onone or you
[13:04] settle with Jesus one on one with Jesus
[13:08] Hallelujah you live a holy ghost filled
[13:10] life Hallelujah repenting of your sins
[13:12] just daily dying serving God growing in
[13:15] Grace and knowledge of the Lord oh it's
[13:17] a joy to be a Christian praise
[13:19] God and what was the first M what's the
[13:21] first complaint in the church did you
[13:23] notice it's nationalities and
[13:27] races isn't that
[13:30] something remind you of anybody reminds
[13:32] you of St Peter I mean I've referen that
[13:34] over and over G galatian is it something
[13:37] right holy ghost fed people the first
[13:40] problem that
[13:41] rises is nationalities now church we
[13:45] should feel so blessed that we have all
[13:46] of our nationalities here and we're such
[13:48] a family of
[13:49] God right nobody ever walked out there
[13:52] in the fellowship room Sunday and said
[13:54] I'm not eating with the Smiths because
[13:55] they're
[13:57] Americans
[14:00] I'm not going to sit by brother Jesse
[14:01] he's
[14:02] American I thank you for that shows you
[14:06] got the right Spirit right amen is that
[14:09] but is that something and then look at
[14:10] some of the the problems in message
[14:11] churches today right it just goes to
[14:14] show you know you know as Christians
[14:16] we're going to struggle with one thing
[14:18] or another but I'm glad we don't
[14:19] struggle with that by God's grace glad
[14:22] because we have love one for another
[14:24] other words I see as much value in you
[14:26] as I see in myself right you're just as
[14:29] valuable as I am and if you need
[14:32] something I'm going to help you out
[14:33] praise God if there's anything I can do
[14:35] to help you out let me know I'll do it
[14:37] if I can by the grace of
[14:41] God but here the first one once you know
[14:43] see once your church gets bigger bigger
[14:44] bigger bigger bigger here the first
[14:47] problem is murmuring that means
[14:49] complaining uh There Rose up a complaint
[14:52] of the grecians so the Gentiles are
[14:54] complaining about the
[14:56] Jews and that something
[14:59] because their widows were neglected wow
[15:02] so the first two uh sins we'd say in the
[15:06] church other than lying of Anis
[15:09] of was murmuring and
[15:12] neglected church it's easy for us to
[15:15] feel overlooked sometimes I'll say it
[15:17] like this you
[15:18] know one problem amongst preach or
[15:21] message churches is the preachers get
[15:23] all the respect the preachers get all
[15:24] the attention right so it's easy to feel
[15:28] overlooked right I could easily see how
[15:31] some Churches could feel
[15:32] overlooked but brother but not only the
[15:35] brother Ram brother Ram said the
[15:36] preachers are actually should be the
[15:37] lowest because they're the they're the
[15:38] they're the servants but not only that
[15:41] but the Bible says God honors the Lesser
[15:44] Parts more than the other parts remember
[15:46] I preached that not long ago I think
[15:48] last year 1 Corinthians 12 says that God
[15:51] will honor the less seen ones more than
[15:53] the scene parts right so you've got the
[15:56] scripture for that Hallelujah we got
[15:58] script
[15:59] so so so what I'm try trying to say is
[16:02] don't let the devil try to convince you
[16:03] you're overlooked because if you're
[16:05] overlooked by man you'll never be
[16:06] overlooked by
[16:08] God because God brings the H the
[16:11] prideful down and he exalts The Humble
[16:14] right so God help us all just be as
[16:16] humble as we possibly can be praise God
[16:21] Amen so Gentile widows were neglected by
[16:24] Jewish
[16:27] Christians remember what Paul says later
[16:30] the wall between Jew and Gentile was
[16:32] knocked down that's a new testament
[16:34] Jericho if I ever seen what does that
[16:37] mean we've had a new testament Jericho
[16:38] right in the church amen amen our church
[16:40] there's no wall between us we're all
[16:42] just children of God
[16:44] hallelujah that just struck me up so
[16:47] let's so let's be an example of true
[16:49] unity and love praise let's continue to
[16:51] be that example hallelujah amen for all
[16:53] those who need a good
[16:56] example Hallelujah so remember this is
[16:59] part of the book of Acts church we say
[17:01] we want to be like the book of Acts
[17:02] Church well book of Acts churches have
[17:04] trouble sometimes right
[17:08] Hallelujah so this just being part uh
[17:11] this is just part of being a a Christian
[17:12] right we're gonna we're going to have
[17:14] lots of Victories we're going to have
[17:16] the the character of Christ but
[17:17] sometimes we're going to be overlooked
[17:20] sometimes uh we're going to be we're
[17:22] going to murmur and complain you know
[17:24] have to say you don't have to raise your
[17:25] hand I know this is a live stream but
[17:28] I'll be the first who admit sometimes I
[17:30] complain I feel sorry for myself and I
[17:32] shouldn't and God always humbles me
[17:34] somehow I always hear about somebody
[17:35] else's problem and I'm like me I have
[17:38] nothing to complain
[17:40] about I have nothing complain about like
[17:42] I even found it this week people are
[17:43] asking me how is your Thanksgiving how
[17:44] is Thanksgiving and the one thing I was
[17:46] saying oh we had three sick children I'm
[17:48] like why like forgive me Lord why should
[17:50] I been bringing up I should say my wife
[17:52] was healthy and made us a wonderful meal
[17:53] like amen what why am I even saying
[17:57] that you know just just wrong I
[18:00] shouldn't I should I shouldn't say all
[18:02] the positive
[18:05] things but murmuring and complaining and
[18:08] then neglect was the first uh the first
[18:13] problems and notice you know there were
[18:15] so people were so poor they daily come
[18:17] to the Saints to get food every day they
[18:19] had to
[18:20] come right so you Mom your parents with
[18:23] children you know what it's like every
[18:24] day uh can I have breakfast few hours
[18:26] later or I'm sorry a few minutes later
[18:28] I'm hungry again you just had breakfast
[18:30] can I have some more food I'm still
[18:33] hungry especially when they get real
[18:40] big but every day you know they come to
[18:42] you every day now pretty soon people got
[18:44] the Flesh and they just imagine that
[18:46] Jewish Christians just walk by and not
[18:47] give them any food can you imagine that
[18:50] Holy Ghost build
[18:52] saes you imagine Peter not eating with
[18:54] the
[18:57] Gentiles just want to emphasize that
[18:59] this is the book of Acts
[19:00] church right right but I love this in
[19:05] every problem God gives a solution
[19:07] praise God so the thing to do the thing
[19:09] to do is not focus on the problem let's
[19:11] pray for a solution praise God
[19:13] hallelujah because we're always going to
[19:15] have problems we're always going to have
[19:16] issues we're always going to have things
[19:17] we got to take care of but let's ask God
[19:19] lord show us the right leadership of the
[19:21] holy spirit so we can solve this problem
[19:24] amen and the people that are overlooked
[19:25] can be seen and heard amen amen
[19:28] hallelujah praise God grant it Lord
[19:30] grant it that all the complaining can
[19:32] stop the the the neglected can be
[19:34] ministered to hallelujah amen that your
[19:37] people can have their needs met
[19:40] Hallelujah their physical needs and
[19:42] remember James chapter 2 says if you
[19:44] don't meet someone's physical needs it
[19:46] doesn't mean anything to try to help
[19:48] them spiritually just remember that we
[19:51] got winter coming up let's remember that
[19:53] here that's good reminder if you see
[19:55] somebody without a coat let's try to get
[19:56] him a coat by God's grace like and we've
[19:59] had that talk you might not want to give
[20:00] him cash I don't give him cash anymore
[20:01] unless I that's all I have I just give
[20:04] him a water bottle or something like
[20:06] that but you know we just got to be
[20:08] really careful we got to just be led by
[20:10] the Holy Spirit Hallelujah now verse two
[20:13] oh no actually we didn't read Phil let's
[20:15] go to Philippians 21:14 I think we got
[20:17] time Philippians 21415 to 16 can you put
[20:20] up there
[20:21] patient so the Bible said they had
[20:23] murmurings but then Paul says by the
[20:25] Holy Spirit do all things
[20:29] without
[20:30] burs amen but that's in the book of Acts
[20:34] Church yeah that's in the book of Acts
[20:36] church sometimes we might
[20:38] dispute right we might dispute about
[20:41] things I'll try to think of some
[20:44] examples oh yeah brother Jesse uh you
[20:48] should wear you shouldn't wear short
[20:49] sleeves or something like that you know
[20:51] I was thinking one like people might
[20:53] struggle oh no no I I can wear short
[20:55] sleeves no you can't wear short sleeves
[20:59] you know just think of any dispute
[21:00] someone might have with somebody you
[21:02] know that just seem this frivolous right
[21:05] now this is a real dispute though
[21:06] because people are not being fed that's
[21:07] God really cares about people's needs
[21:09] being met Amen in other words we just we
[21:12] just got to be careful not to let
[21:13] disputes rise up and try to just meet
[21:16] the people's needs as much as possible
[21:18] try not to complain try not to murmur
[21:21] try not to dispute about things there's
[21:22] got to be a peaceful solution everybody
[21:24] can say Amen to amen all right verse 15
[21:29] that ye may be blameless and harmless
[21:31] the sons of God now were were these
[21:34] Saints in act chapter 6 the sons of God
[21:36] yes right we're not de christianizing
[21:39] them we're just saying we should all
[21:41] strive We should strive to do all things
[21:43] without murmuring and disput that should
[21:46] be our goal I'll say like this that's
[21:47] the word I'm going to use later the
[21:49] ideal We should strive for the
[21:51] ideal right it's not always going to be
[21:54] ideal but we should strive to live an
[21:57] ideal life that that's in much IM
[21:58] balance with the scripture as possible
[22:02] hallelujah it's not always going to be
[22:04] perfect it's not always going to be
[22:05] pretty we got to strive to do the best
[22:06] we can yes without rebuke in the midst
[22:10] of a crooked and perverse Nation among
[22:13] whom ye shine as lights in the world
[22:15] verse
[22:16] 16 holding forth the word of life that I
[22:19] may rejoice in the Name of Christ that I
[22:21] have not run in vain neither labored in
[22:23] vain so see Paul's saying if we let
[22:25] murmuring and disputes and we let these
[22:27] other things if we let them rise up then
[22:30] sometimes he could he said I could lose
[22:32] my
[22:33] reward right so kind of like lot lot was
[22:36] saved but he lost all's
[22:38] reward so Mur like murmuring and
[22:40] disputes can lead to what people losing
[22:42] their
[22:43] rewards so we want to be humble we want
[22:46] to be
[22:47] blameless the sons of God grant it Jesus
[22:50] amen all right go to back to Acts
[22:53] chapter 6 here verse two then the 12
[22:56] called the multitude of disciples under
[22:58] to them and said it is not reason that
[23:00] we should leave the word of God and
[23:02] serve tables now reason means agreeable
[23:04] or acceptable so for them it's not
[23:07] acceptable that we should leave the word
[23:09] of God and then serve
[23:11] tables
[23:15] Hallelujah so um so here now we're
[23:18] getting to the ideal
[23:23] situation now how many know this how
[23:25] many know that brother random at one
[23:26] time was the pastor Deacon trustee and
[23:29] song leader and he said everything else
[23:32] how many know that nobody knew that okay
[23:35] GL I taught you something something new
[23:37] there huh Eden said she knew it so you
[23:39] knew it
[23:41] Eden ah you must have listened to church
[23:43] order this week
[23:46] 1963 it is church order 1963 brother R
[23:49] said look years ago he says when I
[23:51] pastored here I had to be the pastor
[23:53] Deacon trustee and everything else at
[23:56] once see but I had to do it because
[24:01] there was no one else now you don't have
[24:03] to do it that way see because you got
[24:05] men to carry this out then brother said
[24:08] when he got men he made them ushers and
[24:11] then he said I made the ushers he said
[24:13] he said
[24:15] uh he said they had books piled around
[24:18] here at the door setting a chair or
[24:19] something or other and when someone come
[24:21] in you show them a place to hang their
[24:22] coat and help them give them their seat
[24:24] give them a song book and ask them to be
[24:26] in prayer so brother Church once he got
[24:28] men he set ushers in the
[24:31] back and when people would walk in they
[24:34] he'd say oh can you can I hang up your
[24:35] coat for you you need a place to sit he
[24:37] said you need a song book and he said
[24:39] can you be in prayer please how many
[24:41] would like a brother back there to
[24:42] remind you to pray before service amen
[24:44] can we set set somebody up there for
[24:47] you no we should know that brother said
[24:50] either either pray or read your Bible
[24:52] before service now I've seen message
[24:54] churches I'm not trying to be critical
[24:55] but they put all these things up on the
[24:57] screen like birthdays and all these
[24:59] things and to me I'm like I'm not going
[25:00] that far it's time to pray and read your
[25:03] Bible I believe in praying for people
[25:06] I'll announce your birthday when it's
[25:07] your
[25:08] birthday was joking but to me when
[25:11] people start getting away from prayer
[25:13] and reading the Bible something's a
[25:15] little wrong there right it's just a
[25:17] little bit of the sacredness uh nature
[25:18] asked me a good question why don't we
[25:19] chew gum uh in church it's it's a good
[25:22] question we don't want to lose the
[25:23] sacredness of this place right this is a
[25:26] meeting place with God this is a place
[25:28] where a life can be changed in one
[25:30] moment praise God Amen or an answer to a
[25:34] prayer can happen in just one moment
[25:36] hallelujah amen we never want to lose
[25:38] the sacredness of that now we're going
[25:40] to we're going have to be tested not to
[25:41] let it become common we're tested all
[25:43] the time as we go through Seas the
[25:45] ministry we're to be tested all the time
[25:47] but we got to do everything in our duty
[25:49] every everything in our power to keep
[25:51] this a sacred Place
[25:52] Hallelujah remember brother Kevin
[25:54] remember he said when he went to per
[25:56] green church he said he was ch gum the
[25:58] first time and the the Deacon come by
[25:59] and said spit out your gum and you had a
[26:02] trash can Kevin spit it out he said I
[26:04] realized right away they were serious
[26:06] people how' you like that hat you on the
[26:09] back spit out your gum young
[26:14] man but it's it's the idea of you know
[26:18] this we're meeting with God here right
[26:20] we're meeting with
[26:21] God and so in the early church the
[26:24] preacher said it's not acceptable for us
[26:27] to be de but that's because they could
[26:29] have other brothers that were deacons
[26:31] brother brandom started a church and he
[26:33] had to be Deacon and everything else
[26:35] sound
[26:37] familiar I'm glad I got some help you
[26:39] know with trustees and song leaders I
[26:41] love it I love it um but it just it's it
[26:45] just shows me every church is
[26:47] different and you got to be as ideal as
[26:51] po just make it as ideal as
[26:53] possible like I said I've asked God for
[26:55] I've prayed right here and cried how
[26:57] many times in this sday probably find
[26:58] some of my tear tear stains there I've
[27:01] asked God if I could be a full-time
[27:02] pastor and give all my time so far God
[27:04] hasn't answered my prayer that doesn't
[27:06] mean he's not gonna but I want to be
[27:08] faithful I just want to be just as
[27:09] faithful as I can no matter what God's
[27:11] called me to
[27:12] do and so do you praise God I know you
[27:14] do too you just want to be just as
[27:16] faithful as you can at whatever God's
[27:19] called you to do amen like there's
[27:21] something else I I was going to share oh
[27:23] yeah that's this one too brother Brandon
[27:25] started pastoring even before was
[27:28] Ned anybody know that that okay so did
[27:33] Brother Craig boore remember brother
[27:34] Craig boore you've had him preach a
[27:35] couple time he was pastoring before he
[27:38] was even
[27:40] married
[27:43] Hallelujah but the Bible says a bishop
[27:46] must be the husband
[27:48] of and he must have his children and
[27:53] subjection so see we have
[27:55] a we have a blueprint but there is some
[27:59] flexibility in here when people are led
[28:01] by the Holy
[28:03] Spirit okay
[28:05] amen that's going to come up this going
[28:07] to be important a little later here by
[28:08] God's grace because we got to we want to
[28:10] be as scriptural as possible now I never
[28:12] we never want to break the word of God
[28:14] but look how God I'll just say like this
[28:17] God was gracious in those
[28:18] areas I think I shared it with would I
[28:20] share with amen yeah yeah two Sundays
[28:23] ago in hezekiah's day they had such a
[28:26] Revival and so many animal being
[28:27] sacrificed they didn't have enough
[28:29] priests to kill all the animals so they
[28:31] had to let men that were not priests now
[28:33] I think they still handled I think they
[28:34] were the coites I think they still
[28:36] handled like the the Tabernacle but they
[28:38] were not priests but God allowed them to
[28:41] be priests just for that
[28:43] moment and then when they were done they
[28:45] steep
[28:47] back interesting somebody could have
[28:50] went and said oh you're breaking Moses
[28:52] law you're you're
[28:54] guilty but then they were having Revival
[28:57] and it seemed like God was honoring
[28:59] their
[28:59] Revival
[29:02] Hallelujah didn't Seymour remember
[29:04] Seymour didn't even have children right
[29:07] and yet God used him to spearhead the
[29:11] beginning of the leoan church age
[29:14] brother R said the greatest Revival
[29:15] since Pentecost amen remember that
[29:18] goodness gracious right and he pastored
[29:21] that
[29:22] church I didn't wasn't plan on saying
[29:24] that that was justu my memory there so
[29:27] we got this we got this
[29:29] blueprint but we got to have
[29:32] wisdom the Jesus also said he said the
[29:35] Pharisees forgot the other things Mercy
[29:37] was one of them that's it mercy and
[29:40] judgment what was the other one he said
[29:43] you you kept these uh uh you kept the
[29:45] minor things you kept all these details
[29:47] of every TI he said but you left off
[29:49] mercy and judgment maybe just mercy and
[29:51] judgment somebody can look that up you
[29:53] look it up might be helpful to
[29:55] us all right so
[29:58] that's why when I look at our church I
[30:00] don't see any problem with the way we're
[30:01] running things because brother Brandon
[30:03] at one point had to have this kind of
[30:05] setup as well with a small church until
[30:07] you get more more labors in the
[30:11] vineyard all right so he said it's not
[30:14] reason it's not acceptable for us but
[30:16] yet it was acceptable for brother
[30:18] Brandon right for his that short time
[30:21] his Myer it's been acceptable for us
[30:23] verse three wherefore Brethren look ye
[30:24] Out Among you seven men of honest report
[30:27] full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom
[30:29] we may appoint over this business so
[30:32] what is giving food to people in the
[30:33] church it's called a
[30:35] business it's a
[30:37] business but we will give ourselves
[30:40] continually to prayer and to the
[30:42] ministry of the
[30:43] word okay so in the early church they
[30:45] the preachers the apostles really wanted
[30:47] to just give themselves a prayer and
[30:49] preaching prayer and preaching and God
[30:51] honored it praise God now they had the
[30:54] large numbers to it remember 3,000 on
[30:56] the day of pagos 3,000 3,000 in your all
[30:59] the the related
[31:01] churches all
[31:02] right verse
[31:06] 5 so uh the ideal way is for each person
[31:09] to focus on their one Ministry but it's
[31:12] not always ideal right Apostles just
[31:15] want to focus on prayer preaching and
[31:17] now deacons just focus on business focus
[31:20] on the business of the people give them
[31:23] their food now for us brother tells the
[31:25] business now is now we have buildings we
[31:26] have church buildings that's the
[31:28] business of a of Deacon too right Deacon
[31:30] can take care of that truste can take
[31:31] really the trustee takes care of
[31:34] that but the Deacon is brother calls him
[31:36] the policeman of the church but they
[31:38] also they can do the business of the
[31:40] church they can feed the poor all right
[31:43] verse uh five and the saying pleased the
[31:47] whole multitude and they chose stepen a
[31:48] man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost
[31:50] and Philip and proris and nikanor and
[31:54] timan and par par
[31:57] and Nicholas a proelite of
[32:01] Antioch verse six whom they set before
[32:04] the apostles and when they had prayed
[32:06] they laid their hands on them so now
[32:08] here we get the example anytime
[32:10] someone's ordained for an office you got
[32:12] to lay hands on them like when we
[32:14] dedicated our church brother Brooks laid
[32:15] hands on me and sent me out to Pastor
[32:17] The church here hallelujah
[32:21] am remember we can take brother Brooks
[32:23] all the way back to brother Brandon
[32:24] right from each one that he heard the
[32:25] word of God from we can take it all the
[32:26] way back brother
[32:29] Rand so uh we can see remember Paul said
[32:32] lay hands not on a man
[32:35] suddenly so brother Brooks had known me
[32:37] since 2001 the end of 2001 and then he
[32:40] ordained me as a pastor in 2006 so he
[32:42] knew me just about five years he knew me
[32:45] there so he didn't do it right away well
[32:47] brother Jesse got saved in a let's make
[32:48] him a pastor
[32:50] tomorrow don't give that guy a chance to
[32:52] preach not yet don't do it suddenly so
[32:56] Stephen must must been known for a while
[32:58] before the before the Holy Ghost fell he
[33:00] must have been seen as a Godly Jewish
[33:01] man and now he's a Godly Holy Ghost F
[33:03] Christian many Wonder many Bible said
[33:06] great Fai full of Faith signs wonders
[33:08] and miracles amongst all the
[33:10] people he had a powerful testimony among
[33:13] the people God had used him to do great
[33:15] things how many want to be used by
[33:18] Goden it's just like Joshua the Bible
[33:20] said there came a day when God magnified
[33:22] Joshua in the sight of the people that's
[33:24] what I want for our church I want God to
[33:26] vindicate person's gifts in our
[33:29] congregation I believe God's done it
[33:31] praise God if he hasn't he's going to do
[33:33] it praise God there's some way God's
[33:35] going to use your gift use something in
[33:37] your life where you just know that was
[33:39] God hallelujah that was God amen amen
[33:41] remember you got different levels of
[33:43] gift you got five gifts four 3 two one
[33:45] you know there's different
[33:47] levels the thing to do is just make
[33:49] yourself available be that glove right
[33:52] be that glove God can stick uh go God
[33:54] can anoint you a poor in his spirit and
[33:56] God can use use that glove Hallelujah to
[33:58] do something for his glory praise
[34:02] God just like Joshua just like the other
[34:05] Apostles just so Stephen gets used by
[34:07] God it's undeniable this is a holy ghost
[34:10] filled man he's full of Faith praise God
[34:13] it's full of
[34:15] power now uh verse seven and the word of
[34:19] God increased now look at that the
[34:22] preachers want to focus on the word so
[34:23] they they anoint men uh to be do the
[34:27] business work and the preachers do their
[34:29] preaching work and God blesses it amen
[34:32] hallelujah that's what God's done with
[34:33] us God blesses our ministry too amen
[34:35] whatever we feel led to do praise God we
[34:38] do it by the grace of the
[34:40] Lord hallelujah uh and the number of
[34:44] disciples multitude and I'm sorry
[34:45] multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and the
[34:47] great company of the priests were
[34:48] obedient to the faith I'm just going to
[34:50] try to finish chapter 6 tonight okay I'm
[34:52] not trying to go to chapter 7 chapter 7
[34:53] is a beautiful it's not a sermon it's a
[34:56] beautiful testimon of rebuke from stepen
[34:59] uh to the the resists of the Holy Ghost
[35:03] so we never want to resist the Holy
[35:04] Ghost say holy ghost have your full way
[35:06] in my
[35:08] life I don't resist you I accept you
[35:10] Hallelujah I I I let you flow through my
[35:12] life amen let's not resist the Holy
[35:15] Spirit let's let him into our lives
[35:16] praise God more and more so the word of
[35:18] God increases God blesses this setup of
[35:22] order now you got preachers and you got
[35:23] deacons He blesses us but remember
[35:26] there's Deacon requirements years later
[35:29] Paul gives Deacon requirements years
[35:31] later okay let's go read that uh 1
[35:35] Timothy 3:8 I keep my
[35:38] place 1 Timothy
[35:41] 38 now what's interesting church this
[35:44] thought just come to me too I'm not
[35:45] trying to be you know uh hard to
[35:47] understand anything but but if if if a
[35:50] if a bishop can be a pastor and not be
[35:53] married and have children well then can
[35:55] a deacon be a deacon and not be be
[35:56] married with Children that's
[35:59] interesting if we'll let the preacher do
[36:02] it will we let the deacon do
[36:03] it or do we just favor the preachers you
[36:06] know or favor the deacons you see so
[36:09] just interesting just a thought I never
[36:11] had
[36:13] before now verse eight uh 1 Timothy 38
[36:16] remember the the pastor is called a
[36:18] bishop Bishop just means overseer Pastor
[36:20] is a pastor is a Shepherd he oversees
[36:22] the flock right so Bishop is another
[36:25] Bible word for pastor verse 8 likewise
[36:28] must the deacons be great not double
[36:31] Tong not given to much wine not guilty
[36:33] of I'm sorry not greedy of filthy lucer
[36:35] why because they're they're feeding the
[36:36] uh feeding the poor they got the
[36:38] money holding the mystery of the faith
[36:41] in a pure conscience have a pure
[36:44] conscience before the people and let
[36:46] these also first be proved so again you
[36:48] just don't lay hands on suddenly I'm
[36:49] making this brother a deacon tomorrow we
[36:51] just got saved then let them use the
[36:53] office of a deacon being found blameless
[36:55] so deons do to be blameless just like
[36:57] the bishop must be
[36:59] blameless that was spoken of in verse
[37:01] two now verse 11 now we get to even
[37:04] requirements for a Deacon's wife even so
[37:07] must their wives be grave not slanderers
[37:10] sober faithful in all
[37:13] things let the deacons be the husband of
[37:15] one wife ruling their children and their
[37:17] own house as well that's the same thing
[37:18] a bishop says right but brother Bram was
[37:22] a bishop before he had a wife and
[37:25] children
[37:29] hallelujah it's good to think about
[37:31] isn't it and church you know some of
[37:34] these things have made people upset it's
[37:36] brought in murmurings and
[37:38] disputings what does the Bible say all
[37:40] these things are done to what manifest
[37:42] who's the True
[37:44] Believer Hallelujah that's all these
[37:47] problems are they're just manifesting
[37:48] they're just letting everybody see what
[37:50] seeds inside of you how many got the
[37:53] seed of God tonight amen praise God
[37:55] hallelujah these little disputes and
[37:58] little murmurings and
[38:01] complainings it just now can the Holy
[38:03] Ghost for bu person complain sure but
[38:06] they'll repent of
[38:09] it all right so we can see this here um
[38:12] verse 13 for they that have used the
[38:15] office of a deacon well purchased
[38:16] themselves a good degree and great
[38:18] boldness in the faith which is in Christ
[38:20] Jesus I know message churches you can
[38:22] see them online they'll let the deacons
[38:23] come do the prayer requests you know uh
[38:26] in the song service and they pray bold
[38:29] prayers I like that that reminds me of
[38:30] this right here but not every Deacon has
[38:33] to be exactly you know have as much
[38:35] Faith as everyone else just like every
[38:36] preacher doesn't have to have the same
[38:37] amount of Faith right everybody's got
[38:39] different amounts uh of the Bible said a
[38:42] Measure of Faith a measure of a gift
[38:44] everyone has a different measure right
[38:46] we want we want we want to grow in the
[38:48] full measure that God has given to us
[38:51] that's what we
[38:52] want brother Ram said preachers and
[38:56] deacons are made by the word of God he
[38:58] said all the other offices were made by
[39:00] man the office of a
[39:02] trustee uh the office of a song leader
[39:04] all these other officers they're all
[39:06] made by
[39:07] man brother brother says though the
[39:09] Bible makes preachers and deacons and
[39:13] look God allowed trustees right in
[39:15] brother Ram's
[39:16] church so there's that Liberty again
[39:19] hallelujah how many grateful for
[39:22] Liberties not every church is a cookie
[39:24] cutter church if it would probably an
[39:27] eagle right Eagle cookie Eagle cookie
[39:29] Eagle cookie Eagle cookie not everyone's
[39:32] the exactly the same God loves variety
[39:37] amen right just like some of you rejoice
[39:40] or some of the kids at school rejoice
[39:41] when they saw snow on Tuesday not
[39:43] everybody did not every teacher
[39:45] did some people Rejoice at the rain some
[39:48] people Rejoice at the summer some people
[39:50] Rejoice it's snow God's a god of variety
[39:54] and in the church he allows us varet
[39:56] iety as well he allows even offices made
[40:00] by man you say that's man-made brother
[40:02] Jesse the truste is man-made that's
[40:04] exactly right it is and God allowed
[40:07] it God allows some of our
[40:11] Traditions God allow brother to set up a
[40:13] Christmas tree we talked about that and
[40:15] the church said what's wrong with the
[40:17] tree there's nothing wrong with the tree
[40:18] as long you don't worship it what's
[40:19] wrong with the TV nothing as long as you
[40:20] don't worship it R says what's wrong
[40:23] with the newspaper magazine nothing as
[40:24] long as it doesn't cause you to sin
[40:27] righten he said if you make the T
[40:30] newspaper sin and the TV's a sin and
[40:31] everything's a sin everything's a sin
[40:33] where's the room for
[40:38] Liberty so Church what we need is just
[40:41] Holy Ghost balance praise God and
[40:44] humility we need to be blameless
[40:46] Hallelujah the Sons and Daughters of God
[40:49] amen
[40:51] amen
[40:54] now I'm going to say something here
[40:59] uh in one quote brother brandom says a
[41:02] uh this is interesting I'm not sure how
[41:04] to approaches
[41:06] just the Lord here I'm not sure if I'll
[41:09] bring that one up
[41:11] yet I'll just read the quote and I won't
[41:13] get into the actual real situation I
[41:15] might have mentioned about I'm not sure
[41:17] I would mentioned it yet publicly while
[41:19] we're on live stream I'll tell everybody
[41:20] on Sunday night well two Sunday nights
[41:22] okay I don't want to hide nothing from
[41:24] the church but in this quote um in 1958
[41:27] brother BR was asked about the placing
[41:28] of deacons that's the sermon the placing
[41:30] of
[41:31] deacons and he says the Bible requires a
[41:33] deacon to be a married man he must be
[41:35] the husband of one wife and the other
[41:36] he's talking about two men that both
[41:38] wanted to be deacons brother Ram
[41:39] accepted one man but he didn't accept
[41:41] the other man now listen
[41:44] why he said uh after investigating the
[41:47] case so see if you want to be office
[41:49] holder Brothers we got to investigate
[41:51] your
[41:52] lives the church
[41:54] said that's why I try to try to
[41:56] investigate uh you know if there's ever
[41:58] a situation you want invest you get all
[41:59] the facts right you would do the same
[42:02] thing right especially when you start
[42:04] having children then you see how you got
[42:05] to investigate things because one of
[42:06] them what usually the younger one will
[42:08] run and say well this person did that
[42:10] and that might be true but what did the
[42:11] younger one do
[42:13] first then he is saying
[42:16] amen and that's just being young right
[42:19] you don't tell the whole part of the
[42:21] story I'll just tell what was done to me
[42:24] I won't say what I done
[42:26] so you got to investigate said you got
[42:28] to investigate each case of a person who
[42:30] wants to hold an office in the church
[42:32] the brother had just recently come into
[42:34] this Faith the message his wife doesn't
[42:37] believe it then that disqualified the
[42:39] man as the office because he must have
[42:42] all his family in
[42:44] subjection they must also be in the
[42:46] faith because it would be a
[42:50] confident see how interesting see how
[42:53] close it is you can be a deacon you can
[42:56] I'm sorry you can be a preacher or
[42:57] Pastor without being married with
[42:59] children but you can't be one if your
[43:02] wife and children are in subjection the
[43:04] word of
[43:06] God isn't that
[43:08] something see how close it
[43:11] is see how close that is and then the
[43:15] Bible doesn't give marriage requirements
[43:16] for the other four gifts of the five
[43:18] full ministry it only gives it for the
[43:19] pastor well that leaves questions now
[43:22] does evangelist teacher Prophet apostle
[43:26] do they have to have wives and children
[43:29] the Bible doesn't tell us so what do we
[43:31] got to do have a lot of
[43:34] love yes and pray amen pray for God's
[43:38] leadership now what I normally do is I
[43:40] just take I take all the other four
[43:43] gifts right back to the pastor I just
[43:45] say well they all we want them to be
[43:47] ideal as the pastor
[43:50] gift okay really thinking tonight AR me
[43:54] good those are all good thoughts
[43:56] so just interesting thought I'd share
[43:58] that with you so you can see sometimes
[44:00] there's questions and we just got to
[44:02] pray and wait on God see how we feel
[44:05] led right we never want to break the
[44:07] word of God but I guess in this case
[44:08] brother brandom and brother Craig and
[44:10] other
[44:10] brothers and and this is what one
[44:12] brother told me one brother said well as
[44:13] long as that Pastor if he's not married
[44:15] with children as long as he wants a wife
[44:18] and children he can be a
[44:20] pastor that's a fine idea but that's not
[44:23] in the Bible right so what am I saying
[44:26] that's your that's your tradition that's
[44:30] your
[44:32] Liberty and God may have had you to do
[44:34] that just like brother brandom had to
[44:37] have had to be all the offices of the
[44:39] church how many glad he was how many
[44:41] glad he didn't quit and go to the
[44:42] Methodist
[44:43] Church how be glad God gave us brandom
[44:46] Tabernacle not so happy about what they
[44:48] do now but I'm glad they started I'm
[44:52] glad God started that church there good
[44:54] look what we got now we have all those
[44:56] sermons all those sermons sort up
[44:58] brother hallelujah praise
[45:03] God it's deep and rich is it tonight
[45:05] deep and Rich all right go back to acts
[45:07] 611 I'm G to try to a place to
[45:10] close in 15 minutes acts six sorry
[45:16] wrong so yeah I was studying I was
[45:18] studying on this other thought I was
[45:19] going to preach on um God saw a man
[45:24] among them to stand the that was I
[45:26] remember I showed you on Sunday Ezekiel
[45:28] 22 I was going to preach on that and
[45:30] show all the men that stood in the Gap
[45:31] but then as I read read this I'm like I
[45:33] think I want to be love to preach that
[45:34] tonight hopefully somebody's being
[45:36] blessed tonight by God's gra and I saw a
[45:38] few hands go up where they learn
[45:39] something so that's a good sign to me
[45:41] praise God that's a good
[45:43] sign okay so U the word of God increased
[45:46] in verse 7 the number of the disciples
[45:48] multiplied greatly and there was a great
[45:50] company that were obedient to the faith
[45:52] that's what we have we have a church
[45:53] that's very obedient to the message what
[45:55] I mean by message the Bible verses God
[45:57] has restored to
[45:58] us verse eight and stepen full of faith
[46:01] and power did great wonders and miracles
[46:04] among the people then there arose
[46:06] certain of the synagogue which is called
[46:08] the synagogue of The
[46:09] Libertines and cenans and alexandrians
[46:12] and and of them of CIA or cissa and of
[46:17] Asia disputing with
[46:19] stepen and they were not able to resist
[46:21] the wisdom and the Spirit by which he
[46:24] spake in other words stepen always had
[46:27] the truth I find that to be true in my
[46:31] debate and other things I've done the
[46:33] Holy Ghost always has the right answer
[46:35] amen the word of God cannot be defeated
[46:37] praise God Amen like you're never going
[46:39] to find a verse where a woman cuts her
[46:42] hair and God says that's
[46:44] great or a person's baptized and titles
[46:47] father son holy ghost or God says I am
[46:50] God alone and two other persons
[46:52] alongside of me God don't say
[46:54] that the
[46:56] Bible so what I seen is that the word of
[46:59] God cannot be defeated brother said the
[47:01] word of God will defeat Satan any time
[47:03] any place anywhere hallelujah praise God
[47:06] you cannot defeat the word of God
[47:11] hallelujah so neither could these
[47:15] legalists these Christ deniers these
[47:17] Antichrist men defeat the wisdom by
[47:20] which he spoke oh there's a wisdom gift
[47:23] right there I didn't have that WR down
[47:24] okay Glory I just seen it okay now
[47:27] that's uh six of them right there six
[47:28] out of nine in the first six chapters
[47:31] the church said amen I didn't even s
[47:33] glory to God
[47:34] hallelujah I might be the happiest
[47:36] person here
[47:37] tonight wisdom Stephen spoke with wisdom
[47:40] gory he wasn't a preacher said he was
[47:42] not a preacher
[47:46] Deon
[47:48] St look at that Hallelujah wow six out
[47:52] of nine praise God just the first six
[47:54] chapters
[47:57] verse 11 then they suborn men now that
[48:00] means bribe they bribed men because they
[48:02] couldn't win the argument they couldn't
[48:05] win the debate Stephen wasn't arguing he
[48:06] was just reasoning which is healthy
[48:11] debating they suborn suborned men and
[48:14] said we have heard him speak Blasphemous
[48:16] words against Moses and against God and
[48:18] they stir up the people and the elders
[48:19] and the scribes and came upon him and
[48:21] caught him and brought to the
[48:23] counsel boy lter does a great job on
[48:25] that don't
[48:26] they with Titus of the Cross that's a
[48:30] beautiful that's a beautiful end that's
[48:32] probably the most beautiful ending I've
[48:33] heard to Audio
[48:36] Drama like Stephen I'll just kind of
[48:38] dramatize it real Stephen's talking to
[48:40] his friend and he's he's retelling all
[48:42] these things he saw Jesus did and then
[48:45] the guy comes in and saids the mob's
[48:46] coming after you and you think he got
[48:47] scared he said he said something alongs
[48:50] the line is he said I'm not afraid to be
[48:51] arrested he said I'm willing to die for
[48:54] my Jesus
[48:57] and then they said he said oh they're
[48:58] coming they're coming he said don't you
[48:59] know in five minutes I'll see
[49:03] Jesus Amen in other words today I'll be
[49:07] with him in Paradise hallelujah
[49:11] hallelujah not caring for his life and
[49:13] the history said he was 29 years old s
[49:16] Lena what are you
[49:17] 22 20 sorry I didn't mean to add to your

[49:30] everything every all the Earthly world
[49:32] Amen I'll give up everything in this
[49:34] world so that I can gain Christ
[49:39] today I don't care if they Li on me I
[49:41] don't care if they paid them off all I
[49:43] know is I might see Jesus
[49:46] today that's a real Christian right
[49:48] there
[49:49] Hallelujah in the flower of his age we'd
[49:52] say the the the strength the the beauty
[49:55] of his manhood or the strength of his
[49:56] manhood said I'd be happy to die for
[49:59] Jesus
[50:01] today that's real Holy Ghost
[50:05] poweru
[50:09] amen verse 14 for we have heard him
[50:14] say SP we have heard him say that this
[50:17] Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
[50:18] place and shall change the custom which
[50:20] Moses delivered to us and all they that
[50:22] sat in the counsil looked steadfastly on
[50:24] him saw his face face as it had been the
[50:27] face of an
[50:29] Angel this scripture reminded me of that
[50:35] song where the B I'm sorry the song
[50:39] says I want to get so close to him so
[50:43] there's no real change I'm sorry so
[50:46] there's no big change on that day when
[50:49] Jesus somay
[50:51] Jesus will call name as days go by I
[50:58] hope I don't stay the same think about
[51:01] Stephen i w to get
[51:04] close that
[51:06] there's CH on that
[51:09] day
[51:14] Jesus look at Stephen the day he dies
[51:17] what does he look like
[51:19] Angel
[51:22] Hallelujah in other words he's turning
[51:24] so much like Christ he's almost like
[51:26] Christ
[51:27] amen he's so much like Jesus they look
[51:30] on him and they see a face like an angel
[51:32] now remember the Angels the Bible said
[51:33] they they made you fearful so he had
[51:36] brother bam said they had such a look
[51:38] they look like they were so
[51:41] Stern and he be think about this he
[51:43] became so much like Christ by being a
[51:45] deacon think about that by being a
[51:46] deacon by serving widows food you become
[51:50] like Christ isn't that beautiful praise
[51:51] God never seen that before amen glory
[51:54] amen give me alls you become so much
[51:57] like Christ you become like an angel to
[52:00] the
[52:00] people Sinners will look at you and
[52:02] think that person is just like Christ
[52:06] they're just like God but Jesse how can
[52:09] I be more like Christ um let's look at
[52:11] the life of
[52:14] Stephen let's start giving people food
[52:16] that need food let's start doing the
[52:18] business of the
[52:24] overlooked
[52:26] let's see who can we find out that might
[52:28] be being overlooked in the church is it
[52:29] the children is it the older Saints in
[52:32] the
[52:33] church is it the moms is it the young
[52:36] young young ones is it the teenagers
[52:38] who's being overlooked and nobody's
[52:40] being overlooked in the church let's
[52:42] look outside of the church prise god
[52:44] let's look at our friends and our
[52:46] family because Stephen became more like
[52:49] Christ through his faith of course signs
[52:51] wonders and miracles but also by
[52:53] ministering to the needs of the the
[52:55] needy the
[52:57] unfortunate the widows that didn't have
[52:59] a husband and there Stephen out there
[53:00] every day here's your breakfast are you
[53:03] hungry again here's your lunch you want
[53:05] some supper here's your supper a man so
[53:08] much like Christ that he's he was almost
[53:12] in that stage like
[53:13] Moses where Moses went the presence of
[53:16] God and he comes out off the mountain
[53:18] and they got to put a they got to put a
[53:19] sheet over his face because it was
[53:21] glowing with the glory of God oh is that
[53:24] I always thought is that possible the
[53:25] New Testament you better believe it's
[53:28] possible you better believe it's
[53:30] possible Hallelujah full of Faith full
[53:33] of the Holy Ghost about the father's
[53:35] business Hallelujah helping those who
[53:38] only have only have their daily meal is
[53:41] that possible in the presence of God in
[53:42] the New Testament
[53:45] absolutely in fact the Bible tells us we
[53:47] should have that put up 2 Corinthians
[53:50] 3:18 the Bible says the more you behold
[53:53] the word of
[53:54] God
[53:56] right Bible said you more the more you
[53:58] listen to the word of God the more you
[54:00] pray at home and also Church the more
[54:02] you're in the presence of God you are
[54:04] changed from one glory to another glory
[54:07] amen
[54:10] hallelujah can you put that up there 2
[54:12] Corinthians
[54:17] 3:18 but we all with open face beholding
[54:20] as in a glass now that's a mirror the
[54:23] glory of the Lord changed into the same
[54:26] image from glory to glory even as by the
[54:29] spirit of God so each day Stephen must
[54:31] have been praying you know staying in
[54:33] the word and then serving and each day
[54:36] brother amen he got more and more like
[54:38] an angel until that last day he was just
[54:41] like an
[54:42] angel he was so Stern he was so sincere
[54:46] so pure there's no hypocrisy remember
[54:48] what's the opposite of Purity
[54:51] hypocrisy he had so the Bible calls it
[54:54] addicted he had so addicted himself to
[54:56] the service of the
[54:58] saints that he looked like an
[55:02] angel said it was 6 foot tall 200 stand
[55:05] up buddy what are you
[55:07] 180 it's actually about his size except
[55:10] like 20 more
[55:11] pound so when the actual Angel brother
[55:14] saw look just kind of like him he had
[55:17] black
[55:22] hair but so put 20 more pounds on and
[55:25] brother said he'd see that
[55:27] angel and he would just be frightened
[55:30] and he would wait for that angel brother
[55:32] Billy Paul testimony wherever brother
[55:34] would go the angel only watched brother
[55:36] brandom in the room when Billy Paul was
[55:38] moving around he would just just look at
[55:39] me the whole time he would always turn
[55:41] to look at brother brand that's all he
[55:42] did look at brother brand you can sit
[55:45] down good job give him two claps there
[55:48] so that's about the size of the Angel of
[55:49] the Lord and he said I come from the
[55:51] presence of God
[55:54] hallelujah
[55:56] now that's what we want to do church we
[55:57] want to behold the word of God now you
[55:59] can do that in prayer too I'm just not
[56:00] saying read your Bible yeah we need to
[56:02] read our Bibles more but just like

[56:05] believe the word of God say Lord I want
[56:07] that to be a part of me and you will go
[56:10] from Glory unto
[56:12] Glory now virtue would bring it up why
[56:14] you look so young brother Jesse maybe
[56:15] that's why God's
[56:18] gra I appreciate you say
[56:20] that I hope that happens for a long
[56:23] time
[56:25] but he looked like so so Heavenly he
[56:29] looked like an angel of God remember
[56:31] angels have no
[56:34] blemishes this is what the spirit of God
[56:38] produces Moses the Bible said Moses had
[56:40] skin that was shining like an
[56:43] angel you look at stepen right before he
[56:46] knows he's going to be he knows he's
[56:47] going to be Marty he knows he's going
[56:49] home to see Jesus and he's shining with
[56:52] the glory of God hallelujah
[56:56] he lived so close to God Satan didn't
[57:00] know what to do with him but Satan went
[57:03] before
[57:04] God and God said this time you can take
[57:08] him you can touch his life but what do
[57:11] we know also as soon as he took his life
[57:13] the Angels were there to pack his soul
[57:15] up to Glory Hallelujah praise God and
[57:18] that's
[57:20] something Satan said uh well I bet
[57:23] Stephen just serves him because uh
[57:24] because you're so good to him and you
[57:26] let him do all these Miracles right
[57:28] imagine what Satan was saying you he
[57:30] just serves you if you if you take his
[57:32] life he'll deny you at the last moment
[57:34] and God said go ahead and
[57:35] try I'm bragging on my son he must have
[57:38] had a bragging session he must had a
[57:39] testimony session in heaven Satan have
[57:41] you considered my servant
[57:43] Stephen
[57:45] good he's so much like me he turned it
[57:48] into an angel
[57:49] Hallelujah Glory praise God oh Jes just
[57:53] serves you because of all the blessings
[57:55] and he gets to beat everybody every day
[57:57] and just let me take his life and he'll
[57:59] deny you go ahead take his
[58:02] life take his life but he'll be with me
[58:05] in
[58:07] Paradise that
[58:09] something how we know that your life is
[58:11] in Christ's
[58:12] hands whatever happens he ordained and
[58:16] he knows you're going to overcome the
[58:19] testen said whether you got to go to the
[58:21] grave as a martyr whether you got to get
[58:23] sickness and die or
[58:25] whatever you may go by gunshot car
[58:27] accident brother went by car accident
[58:29] what's the difference between that and
[58:30] cancer or anything else what's the
[58:32] difference you still got to
[58:34] go but said that's God's prerogative for
[58:37] your life that's God's plan and purpose
[58:39] for your
[58:42] life and alls we must do is stay true to
[58:45] Christ and his calling for us
[58:48] amen and live so close to him that you
[58:51] start
[58:52] looking like Malachi
[58:59] but the the Holiness talk about the Hol
[59:03] of an
[59:06] Angel he told brother he said I come
[59:08] from the presence of God imagine
[59:12] that and then he comes down to give
[59:15] brother the Revelation
[59:18] SE glory amen I come from the presence
[59:21] of God to reveal this Bible to you like
[59:24] I challenged that guy was challenging me
[59:26] this morning I challenged him I said
[59:27] show me one thing I preached that was in
[59:29] the Bible and I don't hear back from it
[59:32] because that's what the angel did the
[59:33] angel came to show brother brand the
[59:35] scriptures yes remember the denomination
[59:37] told Brother brandom uh you're
[59:39] hallucinating those are demon showing
[59:41] you those
[59:42] visions and the angel said no brother R
[59:45] said well well then why do I get sick
[59:46] afterwards and the angel said turn to
[59:48] Daniel Daniel saw one Vision he was sick
[59:51] on his head for seven days that's what I
[59:53] love about this mess amen everything
[59:56] brother heard from the angel you can
[59:57] take it back to the Bible Hallelujah
[1:00:00] thus sa the Bible
[1:00:02] Hallelujah that's I told those guys they
[1:00:04] they're criticizing me what I preached
[1:00:05] to The Junction City Saints I said you
[1:00:07] show me one thing I preached that was in
[1:00:09] the Bible and I'll I'll repent and say
[1:00:11] I'm a I made a mistake they haven't said
[1:00:13] nothing yet Hallelujah because that's
[1:00:15] what the message came to do it came to
[1:00:17] point us back to the scriptures yes amen
[1:00:23] hallelujah R said Stephen was full of
[1:00:26] the Holy Ghost and Faith he respected no
[1:00:30] one he feared no one now that means uh
[1:00:33] he had no
[1:00:34] favorites now I know there's another
[1:00:36] quote where said you got your favorite
[1:00:38] friends so I'm just just a quote you
[1:00:41] know just a
[1:00:42] quote but
[1:00:45] look and when death was pronounced upon
[1:00:48] all who would take that name of Christ
[1:00:50] and walk in the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:00:52] Stephen took his stand with those who
[1:00:54] would not turn back that's what this all
[1:00:56] boils down to are you going to turn back
[1:00:59] like Lot's wife or are you going to
[1:01:01] press on towards the mark of the High
[1:01:03] Calling of God in Christ
[1:01:07] Jesus and Satan will stand there at the
[1:01:09] Throne of God and say well I know
[1:01:10] brother amen will give up if you say
[1:01:11] this or I know brother Jesse will give
[1:01:13] up if you just do this God said go ahead
[1:01:15] he won't deny me he'll
[1:01:17] overcome he's a part of that book of
[1:01:19] Acts Church Hallelujah he and he or she
[1:01:22] they're trying everything they can do to
[1:01:24] be a just like the book of Acts Church
[1:01:27] Hallelujah sometimes you got murmurings
[1:01:29] disputes sometimes you got problems but
[1:01:31] the Lord delivers us from them
[1:01:37] all it's already 8:05 uh let me
[1:01:42] see had a little bit more left
[1:01:48] here let me just CL I'll just close with
[1:01:51] this quote here I want to read this
[1:01:52] quote um this is from the church book
[1:01:54] brother R said though Scholars may try
[1:01:56] to tell you the apostolic age is over
[1:01:58] don't believe it such a statement is
[1:02:00] wrong on two accounts now let me just
[1:02:02] stop right there there's very few
[1:02:03] Apostles like Simon is starting to get
[1:02:05] in that if Simon would actually start a
[1:02:07] church somewhere and set them up he
[1:02:08] would now be an
[1:02:10] apostle I think Jason dears might be I
[1:02:13] think he started a church in Egypt or if
[1:02:17] I'm not
[1:02:17] mistaken but if anyone goes to a foreign
[1:02:20] land and starts a Christian Church sets
[1:02:22] it up they are now an apostle
[1:02:25] okay brother says but we don't have a
[1:02:27] lot right because a lot of message well
[1:02:29] the world's been preached a lot the
[1:02:31] fields have been sewed right harvested
[1:02:34] but people could still do it like Simon
[1:02:35] and Ron feel led to do it next
[1:02:37] month um brother said now they're called
[1:02:40] missionaries not
[1:02:41] Apostles the second proof is that um
[1:02:45] they refer to the age of manifested holy
[1:02:47] ghost power as being over since the
[1:02:50] Bible has been completed but that's
[1:02:52] untrue and then he quotes Acts 238 and
[1:02:55] 39 you shall receive the gift of the
[1:02:57] Holy Ghost for the promises unto you
[1:02:59] your children to all them that are far
[1:03:01] off amen even as many as the Lord Our
[1:03:04] God shall call brother said if they're
[1:03:06] still calling the apostolic age is still
[1:03:08] on Hallelujah that's a simple way
[1:03:12] brother R proves it brother R says until
[1:03:14] he stops calling the Pentecostal message
[1:03:16] and power will not cease
[1:03:18] Hallelujah it will not cease there will
[1:03:21] always be that power Hallelujah and the
[1:03:23] Pentecost message what the church had at
[1:03:26] Pentecost is her inalienable
[1:03:30] right originally she had the pure word
[1:03:32] of God she had the power of the spirit
[1:03:35] manifested in diverse signs wonders and
[1:03:37] Gifts of the Holy
[1:03:40] Ghost let's stop right there so let's
[1:03:41] stand our feet Malachi can come by God's
[1:03:45] grace I want to end with that because I
[1:03:48] want to remind everybody that this
[1:03:49] Apostolic age has not
[1:03:52] ceased Hallelujah the Bible said ordain
[1:03:55] Elders in every city that's what
[1:03:57] happened to me brother Brooks ordained
[1:03:59] me the Elder in AC I'm the only ordained
[1:04:02] Elder of the book of Acts Church in Aran
[1:04:05] as far as I know
[1:04:07] Hallelujah there's another message
[1:04:09] church here let me know we either join
[1:04:10] up with them or they can join us or we
[1:04:12] can be separate if we have
[1:04:13] to but that's the apostolic pattern
[1:04:17] ordain Elder and I didn't ask to come
[1:04:18] here God sent me here hallelujah just
[1:04:21] like Joseph Joseph didn't ask to go to
[1:04:22] Egypt God sent him there
[1:04:24] right find like find yourself in the
[1:04:26] word of God
[1:04:29] hallelujah and this Apostolic age has
[1:04:32] not ceased and I want to end with that
[1:04:35] thought everything in the book of Acts
[1:04:37] is your right now what is a right it's
[1:04:40] something that you can
[1:04:42] do right we have the right to bear arms
[1:04:44] you can do that if you want right
[1:04:47] Mal that's your right you can do it so
[1:04:50] what does that mean for us if it's in
[1:04:52] the book of Acts we can do it
[1:04:55] Hallelujah and then it boils down to
[1:04:57] what does God want done that's finding
[1:05:00] the perfect will of
[1:05:02] God hallelujah what does God want done
[1:05:05] in acurate that's what I want to know
[1:05:06] praise God I see what he's done in 17
[1:05:09] years I want to know Lord what do you
[1:05:10] want to do for
[1:05:18] 2024 let's play that song you got a song
[1:05:20] in your
[1:05:22] heart keep your mind me
[1:05:27] just I guess I've been thinking a lot
[1:05:29] about 2024 lately you know Monday night
[1:05:31] I was just at the house I just I'm going
[1:05:33] to have a little prayer meeting I just
[1:05:35] had a little prayer meeting with God I
[1:05:37] was just praying about
[1:05:40] 2024 just kind of Hit me hard over the
[1:05:42] weekend you know with Thanksgiving I had
[1:05:44] a little more time to watch some more
[1:05:45] political videos and they started
[1:05:46] talking
[1:05:47] about you know here's 2020 could repeat
[1:05:51] I thought
[1:05:53] Lord
[1:05:55] I just want to have a little time to
[1:05:56] talk it over with the Lord by God's
[1:05:58] grace I just said Lord Whatever May Come
[1:06:01] Lord just make me ready by God's grace
[1:06:04] make me
[1:06:05] ready no matter what test might come
[1:06:08] help me to stand withstand the test and
[1:06:11] help me to overcome the test praise but
[1:06:14] I also pray God show us
[1:06:17] Mercy show us
[1:06:20] mercy and that tied into the thought I
[1:06:22] almost preached tonight God was seeking
[1:06:25] a man who would pray for the
[1:06:30] land
