[10:27] did a prayer request
[10:30] [Music]
[10:37] I stand here for a few prayer requests
[10:41] by God's grace - pretty serious requests
[10:47] here
[10:48] one of our friends has a daughter named
[10:51] named named Macy rather and she's
[10:53] battling leukemia so let's pray for that
[10:55] how it is may see two or three so that's
[10:58] let's pray for Macy this evening by
[11:01] God's grace also there's a student I
[11:04] taught at Copley and her great aunt
[11:07] Melinda's dying of cancer she's older so
[11:10] I told her we'd pray for her Belinda I
[11:12] don't know if it's the Lord's will to
[11:14] take her at this time or not but we know
[11:16] God can do all things and our trust is
[11:19] in the Lord Jesus so those two requests
[11:22] are they on the request tonight by the
[11:23] grace of the Lord for that unspoken yes
[11:26] sir
[11:27] Haman amen thank you very for our
[11:31] friends
[11:32] okay Karis friends amen
[11:37] praise the love our Victoria's guy
[11:41] there's a need on that little heart no
[11:43] doubt about that
[11:44] so we'll take those requests before the
[11:46] Lord also to announcements as well for
[11:49] those live-streaming there's no video
[11:50] tonight I don't know if something got
[11:52] unplugged back there but we just
[11:54] couldn't get it through there's usually
[11:55] an option that comes up for the camera I
[11:57] don't know didn't come up today so we're
[11:59] just streaming live audio tonight so god
[12:02] bless the live streamers but it's all
[12:04] audio tonight that's good they don't
[12:06] have to look at me so but they get to
[12:08] miss out on really amen but anyway we'll
[12:13] try to figure that out I got a reminder
[12:14] I'll text brother bang tomorrow well

[12:18] and also this Sunday we'll have two
[12:19] services I try to keep the second one
[12:21] shorter I'm feeling a lot stronger just

[12:25] grace so we'll try to have two services
[12:28] and also an update on the postcard
[12:32] ministry we're working on the rough
[12:36] draft of the postcards and also we're
[12:39] going to have summer a summer series in

[25:40] let's take our Bibles tonight by the
[25:42] grace of the Lord let's go to proverbs
[25:45] chapter 31 we like to finish on this
[25:48] thought of the proverbs 31 woman tonight
[25:50] by God's grace sorry I don't have my mic
[25:54] on robbers chapter 31 and Lord willing
[25:59] if we have time I still want to finish
[26:01] the thought about my son here the
[26:03] instruction so I kind of got five time
[26:05] I'll combine both messages into one
[26:07] tonight by God's grace that's the beauty
[26:11] a pastor and praise the Lord I just love
[26:12] it I can always pick up and finish
[26:14] wherever the Lord leads me and I've been
[26:16] studying uh brother branham's sermons
[26:17] called revelation chapter four parts one
[26:21] two and three I've been studying those
[26:23] so I want to continue on the book of
[26:24] Revelation soon by the grace of God and
[26:27] we'll pick up on that as well by the
[26:30] grace of the Lord
[26:32] so let's just go to verse 30 proverbs
[26:35] chapter 31 verse 30 we'll just read that
[26:37] one verse there just a moment as I get
[26:41] there
[26:41] verse 31 30 let's read that verse
[26:48] together one two three favor is
[26:51] deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman
[26:54] that feareth the Lord she shall be
[26:57] praised that's power heads a word of
[26:58] Prayer if you need on your heart just
[26:59] make it known unto God here
[27:01] Heavenly Father Lord we again come into
[27:03] your house Lord
[27:04] here worshiping you coming into your
[27:06] presence with praise and adoration we
[27:09] worship you Almighty God there's none
[27:11] like you father God we just give you
[27:14] glory tonight we ask Oh God you
[27:16] ministered all those hands that were
[27:17] raised all the hearts Lord that were
[27:19] raised to heaven Lord God we're looking
[27:22] forward Lord you speak into a
[27:24] strengthening us Lord encouraging us
[27:26] Lord by the grace of God and we trust
[27:29] you'll do it Lord we know you promised
[27:30] to meet wherever two or three are
[27:31] gathered Lord God you said everything
[27:33] revealed when we sit at your feet would
[27:35] never be taken from us Lord because
[27:37] that's a revelation which the gates of
[27:40] Hell cannot prevail against Lord so we
[27:42] ask Lord that you do that again tonight
[27:43] in your faithful mercy Lord and your
[27:46] faithful character feed your sheep again
[27:48] tonight and we'll give you all the
[27:50] praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name
[27:52] and the Saint said Amen god bless yous
[27:54] beaten seated praise the Lord well I
[27:58] have some video air quotes Mac I'll put
[27:59] if you could put those up there we'd
[28:00] appreciate that well just want to greet
[28:03] everybody in Jesus name we missed you
[28:05] last weekend both Simon had good reports
[28:07] he said he got a lot of good feedback so
[28:10] very happy about that by the grace of
[28:12] Lord I haven't had time to watch it
[28:13] I'm sorry watch it or listen to it I've
[28:16] been quite busy traveling and then
[28:17] getting back into school and everything
[28:19] like that but I told him I'll try to
[28:20] watch it as soon as I can
[28:22] perhaps this weekend by the grace of the
[28:25] Lord so we appreciate all the efforts
[28:26] that were put into that I know Malachi
[28:29] was helping out with Simon so I
[28:31] appreciate Malachi by God's grace and
[28:34] thank you sir for all your help Lydia
[28:36] thank you for your help
[28:37] while we were out by the grace of the
[28:39] Lord
[28:42] let's look at this thought here tonight
[28:43] let's finish the proverbs 31 woman and
[28:46] my son here are the instructions so
[28:48] let's look at these thoughts and I know
[28:50] you'll be blessed tonight by the grace
[28:52] of God the Prophet said I've never gone
[28:54] in the house of God and left
[28:55] disappointed I could say the same for
[28:57] that I've never left disappointed even
[28:59] when I've gone to different churches you
[29:00] know what maybe our denominational and
[29:02] visited you know a couple years ago we
[29:04] were on vacation now in Virginia we went
[29:08] to a Pentecostal church and I still
[29:09] enjoyed that service if I couldn't get a
[29:11] whole loaf I got a few slices and I I
[29:14] really enjoyed that by the grace of the
[29:16] Lord anytime we're in the presence and
[29:18] people are worshiping the name of Jesus
[29:20] Christ we're grateful for that I don't
[29:22] know the I don't know everyone's seed
[29:24] whether they're serpent seed or not or
[29:25] what other whatever they are one thing I
[29:28] know in the presence of Christ is
[29:29] fullness of joy he meant and so we're
[29:32] grateful for that by the grace of the
[29:33] Lord so I didn't read that text I
[29:35] actually forgot to change that slide I
[29:37] didn't do that text many ways I want to
[29:40] jump right into this thought here like I
[29:41] said we'll try to finish these two
[29:42] thoughts tonight by God's grace let me
[29:44] set a timer so I don't wear myself out
[29:46] wear you out how do we know the proverbs
[29:50] 31 woman feared the Lord here's how we
[29:55] know we we come to the end of this
[29:56] chapter and we looked at a little bit
[29:59] last week but the Bible said she
[30:01] excelled all of them in virtue this
[30:04] proverbs 31 woman and we write we
[30:08] finished with it a couple Sunday nights
[30:10] ago where the Bible said give her the
[30:13] fruit of her hands let her works praise
[30:16] her and the gates so the character of
[30:20] this woman would be known in the entire
[30:22] community that's how we know she feared
[30:25] the Lord she lives such a godly life
[30:27] that everyone around her we say in her
[30:30] church everyone in her family everyone
[30:33] in her community knew that she was a
[30:35] godly woman I hope that's how your
[30:37] neighbors know you
[30:38] Oh sister this sister this neighbor
[30:41] godly woman or he could trust her
[30:44] anything she tells you she's gonna do it
[30:46] cuz she's a godly woman she keeps her
[30:48] word
[30:48] this brother oh he's so godly he's such
[30:50] a faith he helped me out when I needed
[30:52] some money or he helped me do this when
[30:54] I was out of town and you
[30:56] help me out the house may be mowed the
[30:57] yard for me when I couldn't mow the yard
[30:58] or you know he we should have such a
[31:01] godly testimony everywhere we go
[31:05] cuz look at this if you look at this
[31:07] thought here her life blessed everyone
[31:11] her life and work blessed everyone
[31:14] around her including her home her
[31:17] community and her church
[31:20] this woman was filled with such strength
[31:22] such honor such an anointing of the Holy
[31:25] Spirit as much as you could get in the
[31:27] Old Testament which you could get a lot
[31:28] you couldn't get the seal but you could
[31:30] get a lot you get enough to slay a giant
[31:32] amen
[31:33] you could get enough to have Christ in
[31:37] your midst in the midst of a fiery
[31:38] furnace you have enough anointing to
[31:41] close the mouth of hungry lions amen and
[31:44] that's what she has she had this
[31:46] powerful anointing maybe we'd say just
[31:49] manifested it in a different way than
[31:51] what we would expect maybe we'll look at
[31:54] that eventually with you know the Hall
[31:56] of Fame of faith with the sisters in the
[31:57] Hall of Fame of faith but look what Adam
[32:00] Clarke said about her the result of her
[32:02] labor is her best eulogy so you look at
[32:05] what did her labors produce that's the
[32:07] best way we could describe her life
[32:10] nothing can add to the simple beauty of
[32:12] this admirable portrait on the measure
[32:15] of its realization in the daughters of
[32:17] our own day rests untold results in the
[32:21] domestic that's the home life and
[32:24] therefore the civil and religious
[32:27] welfare of the people this woman her
[32:30] life touched every aspect of her
[32:32] community her home her church and it
[32:36] impacted the government as well how do
[32:38] you say government cuz member her
[32:39] husband was sitting amongst the elders
[32:41] and the gates her husband had a place of
[32:44] prominence in the community and it was
[32:47] because partly because of her godly
[32:49] reputation that helped her husband have
[32:52] respect and honor in a public setting
[32:54] that's right
[32:56] now this reminded me I just couldn't get
[32:58] away from the scripture where God tells
[33:00] Abraham he says separate yourself from
[33:03] your family get away from Shinar he said
[33:06] then go to land of Canaan and I'll make
[33:08] via great
[33:09] and I'll bless you and make your name
[33:13] great and thou shalt be a blessing to
[33:15] others amen so everywhere Abraham went
[33:19] as long as he stayed in the will of God
[33:21] he was blessed and He blessed other
[33:24] people that's why I hope people around
[33:26] you can say my this brother such a
[33:28] blessing this sister is such a blessing
[33:30] to me if we're not being a blessing to
[33:32] someone that we need to get our eyes off
[33:34] of whatever thing is distracting us from
[33:36] those Holy Spirit and be a blessing to
[33:39] somebody and just be a help to them you
[33:42] see they have any where you can help
[33:43] them out try to be a blessing to him
[33:46] because Abraham was a blessing
[33:48] everywhere he went and he was blessed of
[33:52] God as well so that's the way the same
[33:54] woman is this proverbs 31 woman the same
[33:57] thing is is characterizing her life
[34:00] she's blessed by God and she's blessing
[34:03] other people hallelujah and that's how I
[34:05] think that's how we all feel
[34:07] how many enjoy the blessings of the Holy
[34:09] Spirit you walk out of here on a Sunday
[34:11] or Wednesday night you felt the present
[34:13] Lord well if you really felt the
[34:15] presence of Lord you'll go out and bless
[34:16] somebody else you won't keep that
[34:19] anointing just for yourself you'll want
[34:21] to go bless somebody else by the grace
[34:23] of God huh that's so true
[34:25] now remember church remembrance is quite
[34:27] a statement the Bible said she excelled
[34:29] all the daughters in this day all of
[34:32] them this this this resume that she had
[34:37] excelled every woman of that day this
[34:40] proverbs 31 woman we'd say and so then
[34:45] these attributes are very important of a
[34:48] proper 31 woman we're gonna review them
[34:50] here briefly by God's grace we're gonna
[34:52] kind of organize them based upon the
[34:55] location so here let's review the
[34:58] attributes of this property one woman in
[35:00] those three locations we talked about
[35:02] home community and church let's look at
[35:06] how they fit into her home community in
[35:09] church and I try to add these little
[35:10] abbreviations I'm adding these seasons
[35:12] of life I've witnessed these attributes
[35:15] by observing my wife mother and other
[35:17] sisters so some of these attributes
[35:21] you'll see in a single from a single
[35:22] woman
[35:23] a newlywed married with young children
[35:27] married with older children and then of
[35:29] course empty nest so some of these
[35:32] attributes you would expect in different
[35:33] phases of life like I told you you're
[35:35] not gonna see a woman with a bunch of
[35:38] young children out there you know
[35:40] pulling rocks out of the field you know
[35:43] and working all day out in the field she
[35:44] can't she's got to feed these babies
[35:46] these babies get hungry every two hours
[35:48] don't they some of them you're hungry
[35:50] every hour like some of mine
[35:53] I'm just joking but they do ask for food
[35:56] all the time and if they kept asking if
[35:58] they if we kept giving to them they'd
[36:00] keep eating too but see you can't you
[36:02] can't you don't see that you don't see
[36:04] that in communities you see a young
[36:06] mother with young children you see her
[36:08] at the home you see her in the home she
[36:10] don't have time for other things because
[36:11] this is a very important stage of life
[36:13] taking care of the young children NASA I
[36:17] get older she's got a lot more freedom
[36:19] like I saw with my mother once once all
[36:22] of us grew up I saw my mother her
[36:24] ministry just expanded in other words
[36:28] instead of just going to church you know
[36:30] taking us a church she would actually
[36:32] clean the church and then she got a
[36:35] little a business she would do a little
[36:37] consignment business and then my mom
[36:39] started doing Meals on Wheels and
[36:41] helping people as we got older her
[36:43] business or her gifts expanded and now I
[36:47] think I was gonna give this later but I
[36:49] don't know some of you know but my
[36:51] mother every Thanksgiving Easter and
[36:53] Christmas feeds over 200 people every
[36:55] time and does it all by donations people
[37:00] just see her wanting to help people and
[37:01] they just flock to the church and I know
[37:04] she's got cut hair on and makeup on but
[37:06] behind that there's a heart that loves
[37:08] God and I believe God I just trust God
[37:10] is going to break through that heart one
[37:12] of these days there's a real sincere
[37:14] heart but as I say like I'm giving you
[37:19] these thoughts based upon when I see my
[37:21] wife mother and then other sisters I've
[37:22] seen as they get older that their their
[37:26] influence expands their ministry expands
[37:29] as they get older
[37:30] okay so sisters here these are all
[37:32] things the Bible said in Proverbs 31 you
[37:34] can do at home and I just put the
[37:36] abbreviations because the other ones I
[37:38] think can fit at all the times and I
[37:40] think you know what I'm talking about
[37:41] like for example the first one faithful
[37:44] with resources sisters at every age are
[37:47] probably faithful with resources you're
[37:50] not out blowing y'all your money on
[37:52] what's a woman's website Amazon okay I
[37:56] was thinking of like a women's clothing
[37:58] like Lane and Bryant is that one that's
[38:02] one okay you know what I'm talking about
[38:03] so she's gonna be no matter what age she
[38:06] is she's gonna be faithful she's gonna
[38:09] be fruit more frugal right if not
[38:12] they're gonna be in bankruptcy pretty
[38:14] soon because remember that's not just
[38:16] the husband's money that's the husband
[38:17] and wife's money
[38:18] right cuz if the wife said well I'll
[38:22] take a day off and hubby you'd take care
[38:24] of the children well then he can't make
[38:26] money at work that's their money
[38:28] together right and so see she's
[38:32] trustworthy to her husband at all time
[38:34] every season she should be trust worth
[38:37] now of course yeah you want to grow in
[38:38] faithfulness and Trust with us but if
[38:40] she's a believer
[38:41] she should be trustworthy right away and
[38:43] she should be good to her husband every
[38:45] day he at all times of her life now she
[38:50] should take initiative to work with her
[38:52] hands for example that's what I mean by
[38:53] cooking in the kitchen or or you know
[38:56] fixing the clothes or folding the
[38:57] clothes or all those things a woman does
[38:59] Mother's think about how many things
[39:01] your hands touch every day to help run
[39:03] your home and your family you're working
[39:06] with your hands at all stages of life if
[39:08] that brother even picks up a dish rag or
[39:11] a sweeper you're blessed because I know
[39:13] a lot of brothers a dope or to even take
[39:17] time to feed the babies or something
[39:18] like that you understand so what I
[39:20] really mean is that women often use
[39:22] their hands that's a godly
[39:23] characteristics they use it all off
[39:25] phase of their life now but a woman
[39:28] buying and selling wisely like a
[39:30] merchant that might that could be before
[39:33] they get you know have children before
[39:35] probably not a lot at with young
[39:38] children unless they're really good you
[39:39] know they're really business minded but
[39:42] you're gonna see this like my saw this
[39:43] with my mom more so as that the children
[39:46] got older I saw my mom like I said do
[39:48] his consignment business she started
[39:50] working at the
[39:50] I break clean the library clean sweep in
[39:52] the church when we got older and then
[39:55] helping out the the needy as she got
[39:59] older she was able to do some of these
[40:00] things now serving her family at all
[40:04] hours of the night she's prepared and
[40:06] alert for every emergency most sisters
[40:08] do that all the time right no matter
[40:10] what age of life you're in or stage of
[40:13] life rather planning preparing work for
[40:16] everyone the household I imagine mothers
[40:17] do that as soon as they have the little
[40:18] children soon as they can help out work
[40:20] actually I probably could put a YC right
[40:22] there probably YC once they get young
[40:24] children that's probably the stage that
[40:26] starts healthy and physically fit
[40:28] hopefully the mothers are taking care of
[40:29] themselves
[40:30] you know walk-in or exercising or
[40:32] something we got you got to take care of
[40:34] your bodies and then works with hands on
[40:37] older tools I'd imagine as a woman gets
[40:40] older and life she'll have more time to
[40:42] maybe have like a sewing or whatever she
[40:45] does or whatever business online
[40:47] business she might do I imagine that's
[40:48] with older children she you know she's
[40:51] able to have a little more free time and
[40:53] work with her hands on special tools and
[40:56] they're so here's the last slide for a
[40:58] home she prepares warm clothes for
[41:00] entire household I imagine she's
[41:02] constantly doing that making her own
[41:05] blankets that mate that may take time
[41:07] unless she's really good at sewing right
[41:09] away but if she learns uh so you know
[41:13] later on in life or she's able to you
[41:16] know do a lot of work meet the needs of
[41:18] her home you know with her own her own
[41:20] hands maybe that would happen later on
[41:22] life or whenever they can learn how to
[41:23] do that I that's just what I saw you
[41:26] know with my wife and my mother you know
[41:28] I was a little more experienced you know
[41:30] a little more a little more years or
[41:32] more years under their belt there
[41:33] anybody have some more time to do some
[41:35] of their own goods wares high quality
[41:38] clothes well hopefully they wear their
[41:39] best clothes all the time I remember
[41:41] we're not worried so much about quality
[41:42] as we are modesty that's what we're most
[41:45] concerned about but you wear the best
[41:47] clothes that you have and she's an
[41:50] extremely focused manager the Bible said
[41:52] she looks well to the stage of her house
[41:54] and then she doesn't eat the bread of
[41:57] idleness she's constantly working in the
[41:59] home so how many sisters feel good about
[42:02] those by God's grace no you have to
[42:03] raise your hands
[42:04] but see these are things these are all
[42:06] things that God you know anoints King
[42:10] Lemuel to say these are all virtuous
[42:13] things these things take strength how
[42:15] many sisters can say amen to that all
[42:17] these things waking up any hour and you
[42:19] have three or four sick kids and all
[42:21] these things these things take strength
[42:23] they take honor they take the anointing
[42:26] of God it's exactly right so I've talked
[42:29] to numerous women through school other
[42:31] things I said well I could never handle
[42:32] this many kids we stopped after one or
[42:34] we stopped after two they don't have the
[42:36] strength and honor to do it but for some
[42:38] reason you've got their strength and
[42:40] honor because you've got the Holy Ghost
[42:41] amen
[42:42] you've got God's Spirit inside of your
[42:44] soul hallelujah you see that some people
[42:47] don't have strength and do this they
[42:50] don't have the honor it takes but a
[42:52] godly woman will have this strength now
[42:55] the business ones I all love together
[42:57] these were again they would probably
[42:59] take place if you're really you know
[43:01] business minded maybe you with younger
[43:03] married with young children or married
[43:05] with older children or memory maybe when
[43:07] you get in this empty nest stage of your
[43:09] life you take initiative to work with
[43:12] your hands so you go get you get the
[43:14] materials you go get them and you bring
[43:16] them into your home or whatever you do
[43:18] it and you work with your hands there
[43:19] you take initiative you seek out wool
[43:21] and all these silk and everything and
[43:22] you start doing something you buy and
[43:26] sell wisely like a merchant you make
[43:28] deals so I can sell this here I can make
[43:29] a profit here it could help out the
[43:31] family now this one was business-minded
[43:35] this is the one about the field she
[43:37] foresaw a profit which was 20 years
[43:40] prior 20 15 years in advance and the
[43:42] Bible said with the fruits of her
[43:44] Labor's she invests in that field so
[43:48] that means she's already made a profit
[43:50] on other business deals she takes all
[43:52] that money she made off the previous
[43:54] business and she pours it into her next
[43:56] business amen
[43:57] her next profit this is a very virtuous
[44:00] woman that's very hard to find right and
[44:04] that's then she does long term investing
[44:06] all this vineyard is going to be good in
[44:08] about 20 years or once these vines grow
[44:11] and when it'll be it'll be fruitful and
[44:12] productive this is probably later on in
[44:15] life probably but again
[44:18] depends on how many children you have
[44:19] depends how many years between children
[44:21] right depends on the quality of your
[44:24] health your mental health and your
[44:26] physical health there's a lot of
[44:28] variables but this woman was able to
[44:30] pull off all of these attributes because
[44:33] she was anointed by God to do so and she
[44:37] produces high quality merchandise so
[44:40] she's gonna make belts or girdles she's
[44:42] gonna make the best girdles there are on
[44:44] the market I like that she's got the
[44:48] time to do this the time to invest and
[44:50] make sure this is a a one product and
[44:53] then she produces high quality clothing
[44:55] then she delivers it and sells it
[44:56] herself so she's watching over her goods
[44:59] does this help by God's grace I'm
[45:02] lumping them all together in category so
[45:04] you can see them now community and
[45:07] church this is where we see these are
[45:11] the the two main attributes we see how
[45:13] her she impacts her community not just
[45:15] and I forgot economically to I could
[45:17] have put that that up there she blesses
[45:19] the economy of the area - all right so
[45:23] this is probably when she's got older
[45:24] children or she's got an empty nest she
[45:27] seeks it helps the poor and needy that's
[45:28] what I saw my mother do when I was
[45:30] younger I know my mom did help people
[45:32] when we were younger but it really
[45:34] blossomed once we were all in high
[45:36] school and she had a little more free
[45:37] time we went off to school she could
[45:38] prepare things plan things get things
[45:40] ready it really started blossoming and
[45:42] now like we said almost 600 people a
[45:45] year are fed because my mother's efforts
[45:48] there to help the poor she's actively
[45:50] trying to help the poor and the Bible
[45:54] said she seeks it out she reaches her
[45:55] hand out to the poor so this is what
[45:59] sisters should look for and this is what
[46:01] brothers of course should do - to help
[46:03] the poor and remember her her godly
[46:07] character in her community is so godly
[46:11] that people look to her husband as a
[46:13] leader my if if her wife lives as godly
[46:17] he must be a godly man - how many want
[46:21] that testimony I do people will respect
[46:24] me in the community you know whether a
[46:25] Copley or whether boils down and they
[46:28] could somehow respect me for I don't
[46:29] know what reason they'd expect her
[46:31] bacne for but maybe they would say well
[46:34] we need a we need a civilians opinion on
[46:37] this road worker and this ballot issue
[46:39] it
[46:39] what would Jesse Smith say well I hope
[46:41] that my wife's character my character
[46:43] would be so great that they could trust
[46:45] our testimony this is what she had she
[46:50] lived such a godly life that they said
[46:52] we can trust this man because of his
[46:55] wife's testimony of course his testimony
[46:57] to the church that's all we were we were
[47:00] our godliness to impact not just the
[47:03] church not just our home but we want to
[47:06] impact a community amen glory and that's
[47:12] what I can see you know even in my life
[47:13] you know as I work in Copley I've had
[47:16] numerous families tell me how much
[47:17] they've been blessed by the work that I
[47:20] do but a member I'm not bragging it's
[47:22] not on me but I'm just sharing it as a
[47:23] testimony like I can see how this is
[47:25] true if you and I've been there 14 years
[47:28] now if you live a godly life in front of
[47:30] people they're gonna notice that you
[47:32] love Jesus and then they're gonna have
[47:35] it reputation is either good reputation
[47:37] or bad reputation and so our testimony
[47:43] should impact the community the church
[47:45] and the home it should impact all these
[47:49] places now these are the three
[47:52] attributes she should have that are
[47:54] everywhere home Community Church she
[47:57] should be anointed with strength and
[47:59] honor amen that should be her anointing
[48:03] the Bible said her clothing is strength
[48:05] and honor hallelujah
[48:06] and then also people should see she's
[48:09] not a prideful person she's not a
[48:11] bragger
[48:12] but she's humbly aware that her
[48:15] rejoicing lies in the future so she
[48:18] doesn't have a lot of time to throw
[48:19] parties she don't have a lot of time to
[48:23] to be involved in frivolous things going
[48:26] to sporting events sir
[48:27] you know frivolous things that she's
[48:29] gotta use her time wisely so people know
[48:34] that she's not she's humble she's not
[48:36] rejoicing right now her rejoicing her
[48:38] celebration is gonna be at the rapture
[48:41] hallelujah all right though marriage
[48:44] for the lamb right or at the white
[48:46] throne judgement she'll be rejoicing
[48:47] there he meant when she sees soul saved
[48:50] because of her efforts hallelujah amen
[48:53] she's gonna rejoice in time to come her
[48:56] life's not a party here her life's a
[48:58] ministry here amen
[49:00] her life is a blessing here she's so
[49:03] busy blessing others sure she's saving
[49:05] her rejoicing for the future amen and
[49:08] this is what I love about her and this
[49:11] is where we all can use help men and
[49:13] women she speaks wisely she doesn't open
[49:16] her mouth to tell jokes all the time or
[49:19] to be show sarcasm or things like that
[49:21] she opens her mouth with wisdom and she
[49:26] has the law that she's always kind
[49:28] that's her law her rules are a moist
[49:31] kind she has the law of kindness
[49:34] so she says wise things will have you
[49:37] prayed about this did you try this
[49:39] maybe you could try that can I help you
[49:41] out I could do this for you to try to
[49:43] help out your situation would you like
[49:44] me to help you out
[49:45] she says wise things and then whatever
[49:49] she says she says it with kindness by
[49:51] God's grace how many appreciate that by
[49:54] God's grace so I tried to just put put
[49:56] those in groups here so now we'll move
[49:58] on to this other little thought here
[50:00] just a small little thought I want to
[50:02] put in here remember this woman in the
[50:06] days of Solomon she excelled all the
[50:08] other women she was the most virtuous in
[50:10] other words the strongest of all women
[50:12] and she lived in a time where you know
[50:16] the days of Solomon how many know
[50:17] brother Branham said they were it was
[50:20] the he said it was the highlight time of
[50:22] Israel what he called the the kingdom
[50:25] age what'd he call it the Golden Age
[50:27] thank you brother John thank you I think
[50:29] my wife said it too it was the Golden
[50:30] Age of Israel so she wasn't living in a
[50:32] time where they were getting attacked
[50:34] she was living in a time of peace so we
[50:36] have to take that into consideration too
[50:38] you have to look at the the the
[50:42] situation of the culture you're living
[50:44] in so she lived in a culture where it
[50:46] was thriving economically and so she was
[50:48] turning profits all the time she was
[50:50] very good with business because that's
[50:52] what that it was a golden age
[50:53] economically there was peace she was not
[50:56] living in a time of war
[50:58] so she had all these resources all these
[51:01] all these uh well resources that had her
[51:05] and her fingertips and she put to good
[51:07] use and Solomon said nobody excelled
[51:10] more than her
[51:11] you gave her resources she put him to
[51:14] you she was humble with it she feared
[51:16] the Lord and she did good to her husband
[51:18] every day of her life amen and the Bible
[51:22] said she needs to be praised in other
[51:25] words people look at this woman say god
[51:26] bless you you are a fine example of a
[51:29] Christian woman your works have have
[51:32] just blessed so many thank you for
[51:34] serving the Lord you're such a wonderful
[51:35] Holy Ghost field Saint any words you can
[51:39] think to say to this godly Saint you'd
[51:41] say it oh never praising them with
[51:44] compliments
[51:45] you're such an example to me you're such
[51:48] a blessing to me I'm so glad you're at
[51:50] our church amen
[51:51] I trust that we've got sisters like that
[51:53] amen brothers like that where you can
[51:55] literally look them in the face and say
[51:57] thank you you're such a great blessing
[51:58] to our church you're such a blessing in
[52:00] the kingdom of God how do you ought to
[52:03] live to hear words like that amen
[52:05] because your works ought to praise you
[52:07] as well that's exactly right your work
[52:10] should praise you and not condemn you
[52:12] right your work should praise you too
[52:15] the Bible said when you're a Holy Ghost
[52:17] field st. you have zeal to do good works
[52:20] how do you understand that that means
[52:22] you just want to do something good to
[52:24] bless people's hearts that's right amen
[52:27] glory amen
[52:29] now let's just compare this I'd like I
[52:31] said I just want to give a brief thought
[52:33] here because remember these women were
[52:35] put in the Hall of Fame of faith we're
[52:39] giving two names and then we're just
[52:40] given a few others and let's just
[52:44] compare them briefly with these proverbs
[52:47] 31 attributes oh but remember again this
[52:49] proverbs 31 woman she excelled all the
[52:52] women of her day remember not everybody
[52:55] lived in the same type of day the Golden
[52:56] Age of Israel not everybody lived in
[52:58] that age so we got to take that into
[53:00] consideration now the first thing is
[53:02] Hebrews 11 verse 11 the Bible said Sarah
[53:06] received strength to conceive seed
[53:10] strength
[53:12] what was it about Sarah where she's in
[53:14] the Hall of Fame of faith
[53:15] she received the strength of God amen
[53:19] she didn't turn down God's strength she
[53:22] didn't reject God's strength and say
[53:24] well that's just for somebody else well
[53:26] I'm too old I couldn't be a blessing to
[53:28] somebody there's no way God could use me
[53:30] for that she humbled herself and
[53:32] received the Word of God we know she
[53:35] received correction from God in flesh in
[53:38] the messenger that came to her in the
[53:40] tenth right
[53:41] she received correction and she received
[53:45] the promise of God that this time next
[53:48] year you'll conceives you'll bring forth
[53:50] a son right amen
[53:53] so this made her in the Hall of Fame of
[53:56] faith by faith she received that
[53:58] strength so she heard the word and she
[54:01] believed it I hope that's how we come to
[54:03] church when you come to church you come
[54:05] here to receive a promise that will hold
[54:08] you for years to come amen if not you're
[54:12] just coming here for hope but the Bible
[54:14] said we got to receive faith and God's
[54:16] Word in other words say God reveal faith
[54:19] to me reveal your perfect will to me and
[54:24] let me walk by faith and not by sight
[54:27] amen I'm walking by faith what faith are
[54:32] you walking by well I'm walking by the
[54:33] faith I want to be in the rapture I
[54:35] believe I'll be in the rapture
[54:37] I'm also walking the faith that I
[54:39] believe will receive the latter rain
[54:41] because I don't see it like I think I
[54:43] need to see it right like I want to see
[54:45] it so I'm walking by faith trusting that
[54:48] will receive the latter rain which is
[54:50] rapturing peg they met and if not me
[54:53] then I mean the next generation by the
[54:55] grace of God that's the faith I'm
[54:56] receiving that's the faith that's what
[54:59] brings me back to church every time
[55:00] preaching sermon after sermon after
[55:02] sermon is the faith that I've received
[55:04] it's giving me strength to take the Word
[55:07] of God and act upon it amen hallelujah
[55:11] now see this up this strength directly
[55:15] goes with this proverbs 31 woman because
[55:18] she was clothed with strength how many
[55:20] remember that okay
[55:22] so see we see both attributes we see
[55:24] Sarah
[55:25] she's in the Hall of Fame because she
[55:27] receives strength and this proverbs 31
[55:30] woman was strong in the Lord as well
[55:32] amen
[55:33] both women received strength from God
[55:36] and we know how it happened how did it
[55:38] happen because they feared God because
[55:41] outside of fear of God you don't have
[55:43] any wisdom right
[55:45] you have nothing so we know Sara had to
[55:48] fear God even though she laughed at God
[55:50] and God could have struck her dead she
[55:52] must have got some fear shortly after
[55:54] that are you with me she had to have in
[55:57] order to receive strength from God she
[55:59] had to fear God first oh it's so
[56:03] important to fear the Lord the only
[56:09] other woman that's listed by name is
[56:12] Rahab because she had respect to the
[56:15] spies the Bible said this one little
[56:17] short sense about Rahab yet she's in the
[56:19] Hall of Fame of faith she Rehan respect
[56:23] to the spies and now church this
[56:25] reminded me of Proverbs 31 27 where she
[56:29] looketh well to her household and she
[56:32] feared the Lord because remember what
[56:36] did she say she said give me a true
[56:37] token right give me a token so that my
[56:40] self and my house can be saved amen
[56:43] she had a desire for her family to be
[56:47] saved
[56:47] she was looking not just to the natural
[56:50] needs of the family but to the spiritual
[56:52] needs which ones are more important well
[56:55] spiritual most important but a real
[56:57] woman we know we'll meet both needs
[56:59] right spiritual and natural so see she
[57:04] had this attribute
[57:05] she had this godly nature about her but
[57:09] she cared about her household she did
[57:10] want to see them die she want to see
[57:12] them in an awful condition and she
[57:14] feared God she said all of us here in
[57:16] Jericho have heard about the mighty God
[57:19] that you serve amen and she said I fear
[57:21] that God I believe that God I respect
[57:24] that God and he even made her lie to the
[57:27] guards and God never as far as we know
[57:30] God never punished her for that lie in
[57:31] that striking God never punished Sara
[57:34] for her lie god never punished Rahab for
[57:37] her life and that's
[57:39] liking now I'm not telling you to lie I
[57:41] would never tell you to lie but perhaps
[57:45] in a situation like let me just give you
[57:46] a hypothetical situation maybe there's
[57:48] uh now remember this was under the Old
[57:51] Testament before the Holy Ghost but
[57:52] maybe there's a missionary you know and
[57:54] and they were in a country that might
[57:56] kill them or something like that and
[57:57] maybe they would lie I don't know
[57:59] perhaps God would honor that but I just
[58:01] believe in this day we've got the
[58:03] Baptist holy ghost I just leave God was
[58:05] sent His angels and do a miracle amen so
[58:08] the person wouldn't have to lie but we
[58:11] do have those facts to women lied one
[58:14] lied in the very presence of God behind
[58:17] his back you know in the tenth so in
[58:20] that area she lied or she laughed at God
[58:22] lied and then here Rahab lies to save
[58:25] these messengers and God puts her in the
[58:27] Hall of Fame of faith for that all right
[58:31] see she cared about her she cared about
[58:33] God she had fear of God she cared about
[58:36] her family and God puts her in the Hall
[58:39] of Fame of faith man what is what a
[58:42] statement next women are mentioned the
[58:45] Bible said women received their dead
[58:47] raised to life again now and it gives
[58:52] the my Bible gave two references Elijah
[58:55] and Elijah both had a widow war oh I'm
[58:59] sorry not a widow with one hand a
[59:00] widowed woman and what was a married
[59:02] woman both had children that died and
[59:05] they read and they prayed for the child
[59:06] and both raised from the dead what was
[59:09] it about both of those women both of
[59:11] those women kept going to the prophet of
[59:13] God they didn't give up faith they had
[59:16] faith they had strength they didn't give
[59:18] up on God they didn't give him the fear
[59:20] they believed God's Word and that's what
[59:23] this woman had she had strength she
[59:26] wasn't afraid and if they were afraid
[59:28] they overcame it amen remember the one
[59:32] in 2nd Kings for that was the woman that
[59:34] said all as well they said she said hi
[59:36] how you doing she said all as well all's
[59:39] well God gave me this son and even
[59:42] though the son has died I know God gave
[59:44] me the son by thus saith the Lord and
[59:46] God is going to if not gave me this
[59:48] child God's gonna take care of this
[59:49] child or we should pray that for our
[59:52] children amen
[59:53] if God gave me that child then God's
[59:55] gonna heal this child amen
[59:57] God's gonna save this child God's gonna
[59:59] use this child for the glory of God but
[1:00:01] we've got to have strength and faith
[1:00:03] like those women did we have to have the
[1:00:06] testimony that all is well amen
[1:00:10] that God will keep his word honey no God
[1:00:13] keeps his word Church hallelujah yes
[1:00:16] strength these are godly women that God
[1:00:20] highlighted in the chapter on faith in
[1:00:23] Hebrews 11 they received strength they
[1:00:28] received spies they received the
[1:00:30] messengers of God they feared God and
[1:00:35] they had faith to believe that even the
[1:00:38] darkest hour God was with them is God
[1:00:41] with you tonight Church is God with you
[1:00:44] even if it's a dark hour even if it's a
[1:00:46] hard hour even if it's a discouraging
[1:00:48] hour lonely hour whatever the kind of
[1:00:51] hour is we must know that God is with us
[1:00:53] amen okay now I think I finished that
[1:01:00] now I'm gonna go on to this my son I'm
[1:01:02] gonna finish with this and I got plenty
[1:01:04] of time I got thirty minutes so I'm
[1:01:06] gonna finish with that so that's what I
[1:01:07] thought I thought I'd have time to
[1:01:08] finish both of these enough by the grace
[1:01:10] of the Lord amen now I hope those are
[1:01:14] about four and a half sermons wears for
[1:01:16] four and a half so about 4.5 4 and a
[1:01:19] half sermons on a proverbs 31 woman I
[1:01:21] help I hope it helped our sisters I hope
[1:01:25] it took away any of the doubt or fear
[1:01:27] well I'll never be as good as that
[1:01:28] remember it's not about doing everything
[1:01:31] she did it's about doing all that you're
[1:01:34] called to do that she did remember
[1:01:36] Dorcas or Tabitha what did she do she
[1:01:38] had the clothes that she made for the
[1:01:40] kids that's all that we know about
[1:01:42] Dorcas is that she cared about kids kids
[1:01:46] who were cold and she wasn't going to
[1:01:49] let them just say well I'll pray for you
[1:01:50] I hope you get warmer she was gonna make
[1:01:53] clothes for them to make sure they were
[1:01:55] warmer praise the Lord
[1:01:59] so these are exam
[1:02:01] that we should see in the scripture we
[1:02:04] should learn from these so I trust our
[1:02:06] sisters you know enjoy their Mother's
[1:02:07] Day sermon a few weeks early by God's
[1:02:09] grace like I said I don't know if I'll
[1:02:12] preach on Mother's Day or Mother's on
[1:02:14] Mother's Day or not we'll see what the
[1:02:15] Lord leads us to now let's see if you
[1:02:17] got your Bibles let's go to back to
[1:02:19] proverbs chapter 27 let's go back there
[1:02:21] let's finish up this my son thought here
[1:02:26] proverbs 27 woe I turn right there
[1:02:29] praise God verse 11 this is the 22nd
[1:02:33] time and you've been very patient with
[1:02:35] me I've gone through I'm trying to go
[1:02:37] through all 23 I've already gone through
[1:02:38] 21 of these my son Solomon directly
[1:02:42] speaks probably two to Jeroboam or Raya
[1:02:45] boom and he says my son listen to my
[1:02:48] words 27 11 now let's get back to this
[1:02:55] here verse 11 my son be wise and make my
[1:02:59] heart glad that I may answer him that
[1:03:03] reproaches me I'm just gonna read this
[1:03:06] one scripture because this is quite an
[1:03:07] interesting thought and I'm gonna read
[1:03:08] you what Matthew Henry said about this
[1:03:11] so he's saying my son be wise make me
[1:03:14] glad that I may answer him that
[1:03:16] reproaches me that in other words then I
[1:03:19] may answer him that abrades me or defies
[1:03:21] me so at some point this father is just
[1:03:24] going to be be upgraded or be rebuked by
[1:03:27] somebody somebody's gonna try to get in
[1:03:30] the father's face and say something bad
[1:03:32] about his family the father knows that
[1:03:37] how many ever how many ever had somebody
[1:03:39] get in your face and say some real ugly
[1:03:41] things anybody ever had that this dad
[1:03:44] knew somebody is going to get my face
[1:03:47] and try to rail me upbraid me so he says
[1:03:50] my son be wise so that when this day
[1:03:54] comes I can answer this person with the
[1:03:57] right answer that kind of sounds odd but
[1:04:01] let me hear you let me show you what
[1:04:03] Matthew Henry says Matthew Henry of
[1:04:04] course was a Bible scholar truly
[1:04:08] anointed to teach on God's Word here's
[1:04:10] what he said children are here exhorted
[1:04:12] to be wise and good that they may be a
[1:04:14] comfort
[1:04:15] their parents and make their hearts glad
[1:04:17] even when the evil days come so no
[1:04:20] recompense them for their care that they
[1:04:24] may be a credit to them now here's where
[1:04:26] I want to get that I may answer him that
[1:04:28] reproaches me with having been over
[1:04:31] strict or severe and bringing up my
[1:04:33] children so this is what Matthew Henry
[1:04:36] said would happen in the days of Israel
[1:04:38] some people might go up to fathers and
[1:04:40] say you are too stricter you were too
[1:04:43] severe on your children and having taken
[1:04:47] a wrong method with them in restraining
[1:04:49] them from the liberties which other
[1:04:51] young people takes in other words
[1:04:53] another father might come up and say
[1:04:55] well why didn't you let your children do
[1:04:56] this and your way to stricter you should
[1:04:59] have be more relaxed you should love
[1:05:00] your children more and the whole time
[1:05:01] you were loving your children more but
[1:05:05] see they just love sin right so he says
[1:05:09] son be wise because there's gonna come a
[1:05:11] day when other men are gonna come and
[1:05:13] try to upbraid me for how I raised you
[1:05:15] and live such a godly life that I can
[1:05:18] answer them with a good answer
[1:05:21] whether they say the proof is in the
[1:05:23] what the pudding the proof of our
[1:05:27] parenting is often in our children right
[1:05:30] many times it is now there's some like
[1:05:32] we said with Esau there's some times if
[1:05:34] they're not elected to salvation you
[1:05:35] just do the best you can only God knows
[1:05:39] so he says my son be wise and then it
[1:05:42] will appear in the effect that I went
[1:05:44] the wisest way to work with my children
[1:05:48] so when parents come and yell at me
[1:05:50] they're upset with me how I raise my
[1:05:52] children that they'll see that I
[1:05:53] actually chose the right way they chose
[1:05:57] the wrong way but I chose the right way
[1:06:00] he says those that have been blessed
[1:06:02] with a religious education should in
[1:06:04] everything conduct themselves so as to
[1:06:07] be a credit to their education and to
[1:06:09] silence those who say a young saint and
[1:06:12] old devil so you see there's some people
[1:06:14] that say oh they're gonna be fine when
[1:06:16] they're young but when they get older
[1:06:17] they're gonna go sow their Wild Oats
[1:06:18] right and to prove to the contrary so
[1:06:22] we're trying to prove those people wrong
[1:06:24] we're gonna raise them godly and they'll
[1:06:26] grow up and be godly amen
[1:06:28] all those that who are elected to
[1:06:31] eternal life all those that are for Dane
[1:06:34] we're not going to let people come and
[1:06:37] in other words he's saying son don't let
[1:06:39] people come and say that I didn't raise
[1:06:41] you the right way live such a godly life
[1:06:43] that people can say my these parents
[1:06:45] pointed their children to Christ they
[1:06:47] pray for them to receive Christ and then
[1:06:49] they actually receive Christ's spirit
[1:06:50] amen that's what he's saying here when
[1:06:54] they come to reproach me that I'll have
[1:06:57] an answer for them about how I raised
[1:06:59] you
[1:07:00] I like that let me go back here's the
[1:07:06] twenty third and final time hard to
[1:07:09] believe let's go to chapter 27 I'm sorry
[1:07:13] chapter 31 verse two I've already read
[1:07:14] this one but let's just read it for the
[1:07:15] sake of it so you've read it 23 times
[1:07:18] and like I said the Holy Spirit just
[1:07:20] kept I felt just a nudge every time I
[1:07:22] read through each chapter I'm like
[1:07:24] there's another my son there's another
[1:07:26] my son there's another my son I kept
[1:07:28] noting this I kept noted noticing this
[1:07:30] and I believe it's been a blessing to
[1:07:31] our children and I hope our parents as
[1:07:33] well 23 times the wisest man on earth
[1:07:38] says my son listen to me of course we
[1:07:42] know our daughters can gain from that as
[1:07:44] well when applied correctly so 31 verse
[1:07:49] 2 what my son and what the son of my
[1:07:52] womb and what the son of my vows so this
[1:07:54] is the mother of the future King Lemuel
[1:07:56] mother and number we already preached
[1:07:59] this but he's saying what don't you know
[1:08:01] that you're going to be a king someday
[1:08:03] and stay away from wine and evil women
[1:08:06] and then he she's a give a voice to the
[1:08:10] poor and the afflicted judge righteously
[1:08:13] because you're gonna be a king someday
[1:08:15] hallelujah so that concludes the 23
[1:08:20] times that Solomon said my son in the
[1:08:24] book of Proverbs now I want to go
[1:08:29] through
[1:08:29] so have your Bibles handy maybe we can
[1:08:31] have the young children read those if we
[1:08:32] I don't know if they have their Bibles
[1:08:34] with them or not
[1:08:35] because there's other times the Bible
[1:08:38] literally says what a wise son will make
[1:08:41] their parents feel like and we did not
[1:08:43] read all these I think one or two we
[1:08:44] read but we did not read all these so
[1:08:46] these are not repeats except maybe one
[1:08:48] let's go to proverbs chapter 10 verse 1
[1:08:51] let's go proverbs 10 verse 1 how many
[1:08:59] love the wisdom of God the Bible said it
[1:09:01] should taste like honey if you've got
[1:09:03] the Holy Ghost it should taste like
[1:09:04] honey because you're a wise virgin you
[1:09:06] love the wisdom of God convers 10 verse
[1:09:09] 1 the problems of solomon a wise son
[1:09:12] maketh a what father glad father but a
[1:09:17] foolish son is the heaviness of his
[1:09:19] mother you ever seen that I've seen
[1:09:22] numerous mothers that their children
[1:09:23] have gone astray and they just they have
[1:09:25] a heaviness about him
[1:09:26] they're so burdened they're so sad like
[1:09:28] I've had like I told you in Guyana I've
[1:09:30] had mothers sit across the table and say
[1:09:33] don't forget to pray for my son and my
[1:09:36] husband they're lost and they're gone
[1:09:39] astray and I raised them the right way I
[1:09:40] raised them in the message I raised them
[1:09:42] in church and they've just shook my hand
[1:09:44] said don't you forget to pray for my son
[1:09:46] Church that'll have an impact on you
[1:09:47] when somebody when some mother does that
[1:09:49] what what is that
[1:09:51] it's her heaviness in her heart because
[1:09:54] her son is not doing what she taught him
[1:09:56] right and so she wants a man of God if
[1:09:59] she wants other people she wants God to
[1:10:01] hear more prayers that God might answer
[1:10:03] her prayers and bring her son to Christ
[1:10:06] like when I was out there in New York
[1:10:08] last time I had numerous sisters I told
[1:10:10] you about it please pray for my pastor
[1:10:12] he's going through an awful time and
[1:10:14] would you pray for my pastor so I'm
[1:10:16] lifting up his name and another woman
[1:10:19] saying will you pray for my son and my
[1:10:21] husband it's interesting you know in New
[1:10:22] York and in Guyana both places
[1:10:24] they just looked at my eyes and looked
[1:10:25] me in the eye dead serious and said will
[1:10:27] you please pray for them don't forget to
[1:10:30] pray for them so I said okay let me
[1:10:32] write it down so I don't forget because
[1:10:33] I'm going to forget and I look at these
[1:10:36] women and I know they're serious they've
[1:10:38] got a heaviness they've got a burden and
[1:10:41] church God knows if we got a burden
[1:10:43] something that we're just we're just
[1:10:45] trying to act spiritual right Oh pray
[1:10:48] for me keep me in prayer well are we
[1:10:51] just saying that to be spiritual or do
[1:10:53] we really desire those prayers see it
[1:10:57] creates a heaviness when a boy when a
[1:10:58] son or daughter won't listen their
[1:11:01] parents it makes the parents heavy with
[1:11:04] a burden they care they care so much
[1:11:07] they've done all they can do to point
[1:11:09] their children to Christ and yet they
[1:11:10] still leave the Word of God but what
[1:11:15] does a wise son or daughter do it makes
[1:11:16] a glad mother and father children how do
[1:11:19] you want to make your which one of you
[1:11:21] want to make your parents glad
[1:11:23] alright then be wise learn wisdom learn
[1:11:29] what to do when you have all these
[1:11:31] choices learn to make the right choice
[1:11:33] ask your parents right ask your pastor
[1:11:37] look to the Word of God look at verse 2
[1:11:41] treasures of wickedness profit nothing
[1:11:43] so it's my son listen as America
[1:11:46] treasures of wickedness profit nothing
[1:11:48] but righteousness delivereth from death
[1:11:51] amen the Lord will not suffer the soul
[1:11:55] of the righteous to famish but he
[1:11:57] casteth away the substance of the wicked
[1:12:00] he becometh poor that deals with a slack
[1:12:02] hand but the hand of the diligent maketh
[1:12:05] rich he that gather then summer is a
[1:12:08] wise son but he that sleeper than
[1:12:10] harvest is a son that causes shame amen
[1:12:13] so what does a wise son do he works when
[1:12:16] it's time to work right he makes his
[1:12:20] parents glad by doing wise decisions
[1:12:23] proverbs 13 1 let's go there 13 1 these
[1:12:27] are all scriptures about wise sons and I
[1:12:29] don't think I read them so I think
[1:12:30] they're fresh to us has anybody ever
[1:12:33] reading in Proverbs lately has anyone
[1:12:35] been reading in Proverbs okay just me
[1:12:36] alright praise the Lord then this should
[1:12:40] all be fresh to you 13 1 a wise son here
[1:12:43] with his father's instruction but a
[1:12:46] scorner heareth not rebuke so in other
[1:12:49] words a wise son will take correction
[1:12:52] from his father and daughters there's
[1:12:55] new
[1:12:55] first times I told Malachi Liddy I've
[1:12:57] had to correct him on things like a Mac
[1:12:59] I'll just tell one example where you did
[1:13:00] a really good job
[1:13:01] I asked me how I take out the trash last
[1:13:04] year well he would take the trash bag
[1:13:06] and just throw it in the black container
[1:13:07] and I just had to show him one time I
[1:13:09] said Malachi you can't just throw it in
[1:13:11] there because there's another bag in
[1:13:12] there and if that bags full and you
[1:13:15] throw it in there it's not gonna or if
[1:13:16] it's not full but if it's falling over
[1:13:18] it's just gonna fall in there and then
[1:13:19] that bag might spill in other words you
[1:13:21] got to get the little trash bag in the
[1:13:23] big trash bag I said to show my son one
[1:13:26] time and had no more mistakes after that
[1:13:28] that's just one small example of how he
[1:13:31] took my correction and I first told him
[1:13:33] I appreciate you taking out the trash
[1:13:35] but I don't want to pick up that kitty
[1:13:38] litter anymore you know what whatever it
[1:13:40] was that was spilled or tissues or you
[1:13:42] know whatever foods you know a few food
[1:13:45] scraps I want to pick up the food scraps
[1:13:47] but see children if you can take
[1:13:50] correction it'll make your parents so
[1:13:52] happy you got to learn from that first
[1:13:55] mistake that's called first-time
[1:13:58] obedience you know and and obeying the
[1:13:59] first time that will make your parents
[1:14:02] happy verse that was verse one but see
[1:14:05] ass corner I don't care what dad says
[1:14:07] imagine Malik I just walked in there
[1:14:08] I'll just throw it in there you can
[1:14:11] guarantee on that second time around it
[1:14:13] was said maokai come out to meet with
[1:14:14] the garage you're gonna fix this and
[1:14:17] you're gonna pick this up yourself but I
[1:14:19] didn't have to do that thank God and
[1:14:23] that's what a wise son does or daughter
[1:14:27] they listen to correction they can be
[1:14:29] corrected they can do it right the next
[1:14:31] time let's go to 15-20 proverbs 15 20
[1:14:40] and remember that
[1:14:42] ability to be taught the ability or I
[1:14:47] should say the nature of being a learner
[1:14:50] is one of the most valuable attributes
[1:14:52] for Christian where you can continue to
[1:14:56] be corrected by the Word of God the
[1:14:59] attitude where I'm coming to church to
[1:15:01] learn I'm coming to church to be a
[1:15:03] better Christian if you can keep that it
[1:15:04] proves you're a real Christian because
[1:15:07] pride will often come up in people's
[1:15:09] hearts where you can't teach me nothing
[1:15:11] I know more than you I know all about it
[1:15:13] come on get me excited about God go
[1:15:16] ahead and try and then even God couldn't
[1:15:19] get them excited about God because
[1:15:20] they're not receiving God's channel to
[1:15:22] be reset to be receiving the word
[1:15:24] through the preaching of the word and so
[1:15:27] children you got to keep that humble
[1:15:28] attitude you can meet you want to be
[1:15:30] taught you want to learn things better
[1:15:31] you want to get smarter right you want
[1:15:33] to be more wise you want people to
[1:15:36] correct you I know it's hard to feel
[1:15:38] that sometimes but we have to have that
[1:15:40] ability I'm going to preach a whole
[1:15:42] sermon on that because it's all through
[1:15:43] Proverbs there's two kinds of people
[1:15:45] there's a scorner that won't be
[1:15:47] corrected and there's somebody that's
[1:15:48] called a learner in the Bible we're
[1:15:51] gonna choose to be one of the other
[1:15:52] you're they're gonna learn from the
[1:15:53] preacher learn from your Christian
[1:15:55] friends or you're just gonna make fun of
[1:15:57] them or degrade them behind their back
[1:15:59] you're the only new one or the other you
[1:16:01] can't do both
[1:16:03] and so having a teachable spirit is
[1:16:06] valuable in the sight of God hallelujah
[1:16:10] 15:20 I said yeah that's right fifteen
[1:16:12] twenty maokai can you read that for me
[1:16:15] okay so we see
[1:16:22] contrast again or why Sun makes his dad
[1:16:25] happy but a foolish one despises his
[1:16:28] mother
[1:16:29] okay so children always love your mother
[1:16:32] she's the one that corrects you the most
[1:16:34] you got to love her the most all right
[1:16:36] children look at me you got to love your
[1:16:39] mom's the most okay I'm I'm getting good
[1:16:41] I'm getting good eye contact here I
[1:16:42] appreciate that you need to love your
[1:16:46] mother them oh don't be upset with your
[1:16:47] mom don't be upset with your mountain
[1:16:49] love your mother make her glad proverbs
[1:16:54] 28 7 let's go there proverbs 28 7 we're
[1:16:56] getting close to some of these good ones
[1:17:01] 28 7 maybe Lydia can read this for me
[1:17:04] I'll start with my children why'd you
[1:17:06] have a Bible okay and then we're back
[1:17:08] together by with you okay Thank You
[1:17:09] Brooke okay should you have a Bible okay
[1:17:11] all right kay so Lydia can you read 28 7
[1:17:20] all right so we get the understanding
[1:17:23] there if you keep the Word of God if you
[1:17:27] keep your parents commands that makes
[1:17:29] you wise you don't have to worry about
[1:17:32] well I can't figure out a Rubik's Cube
[1:17:33] Rubik's Cube I must not be smart or
[1:17:36] something like that that's not wisdom
[1:17:38] well I can do a Rubik's Cube in 10
[1:17:40] seconds who cares
[1:17:41] that's not wisdom wisdom is obeying your
[1:17:43] parents wisdom is keeping the Word of
[1:17:46] God
[1:17:46] I don't know algebra I don't know
[1:17:49] trigonometry I never even took a class
[1:17:51] on trigonometry the highest I got was
[1:17:53] college algebra too I think was highs I
[1:17:55] never got to college geometry so I
[1:17:58] couldn't say I'm not very smart but
[1:18:00] that's not really what wisdom is because
[1:18:02] the sinner can send a man to the moon
[1:18:04] right a sinner can be president United
[1:18:07] States but that doesn't make one wise
[1:18:09] somebody that loves God makes you eyes
[1:18:12] something that keeps the command of God
[1:18:14] makes you wise some of that honors your
[1:18:15] parents that makes you wise see that
[1:18:19] that's verse 7 there and also
[1:18:24] goes back to your companions who do you
[1:18:26] hang out with children do you hang out
[1:18:28] with my children I see graffiti all the
[1:18:30] time on the stop signs and maokai and i
[1:18:31] often talk about that
[1:18:32] why would somebody write spray-paint on
[1:18:35] that stop sign why would they do that
[1:18:37] what three or do they get out of the
[1:18:38] doing that it's so silly it's so foolish
[1:18:41] to do that well let's just go let's go
[1:18:43] let's go break-in some mailboxes like
[1:18:45] some of my friends used to do
[1:18:46] let's go toilet paper there trees now I
[1:18:48] did that a couple of times that was
[1:18:50] foolish of me as a boy growing up but
[1:18:53] see if you hang around people that riot
[1:18:55] and make destruction you're a fool but
[1:18:59] as soon as you leave them and run to God
[1:19:00] now you're wise amen now God can do
[1:19:04] something with you because you're one to
[1:19:06] keep God's commands that's right I never
[1:19:09] got in a much public destruction I don't
[1:19:11] think I ever did graffiti or anything
[1:19:12] like that
[1:19:12] but even if that's a children's give an
[1:19:15] example oh let's go in the bathroom and
[1:19:16] and then the star let's scratch some
[1:19:18] dirty words on the wall look that's
[1:19:20] still destruction right that's still
[1:19:23] rioting that's still doing unlawful
[1:19:26] things under the law because if you can
[1:19:29] out of the law you'll certainly honor
[1:19:30] God
[1:19:31] you can't honor man how can you honor
[1:19:33] God if you can't love man how can you
[1:19:35] love God that's what God says we must
[1:19:37] honor our parents that will prove we
[1:19:39] love God two more chapter 29 verse 3 I
[1:19:48] see it all the time
[1:19:50] my school or they try to destroy pencils
[1:19:52] you know they'd break pencils and they
[1:19:54] stab pencils into erasers you know just
[1:19:56] destroying property or they'll one time
[1:19:59] and they took a sharpie marker wrote
[1:20:00] cuss words all over the playground
[1:20:02] equipment and they got away with it but
[1:20:04] I wish I could have caught him I really
[1:20:05] would have gave him a real lecture
[1:20:07] because I can't you know we that's all
[1:20:08] we can do is just lecture them but I
[1:20:11] would love that I love when I catch
[1:20:13] people you know the little children
[1:20:14] because I want to correct them I want
[1:20:16] them to respect their teachers I want
[1:20:19] them to respect or I've caught people in
[1:20:21] the bathroom boys in the bathroom you
[1:20:22] know playing around throwing paper
[1:20:24] towels in the toilets and I didn't make
[1:20:26] them get it out of there but I wish I
[1:20:28] could have to teach them a lesson
[1:20:30] that if they don't if they can't respect
[1:20:32] man then they'll never be respected by
[1:20:34] God simple lessons like that but member
[1:20:38] they stay with you like I told you I got
[1:20:40] whipped one time with a leather belt and
[1:20:42] I never did that again also took me was
[1:20:45] one time so I hope children I hope that
[1:20:48] was wisdom in me I hope that means I'm
[1:20:50] wise I believe it does you know just
[1:20:53] cause of my own testimony but if you
[1:20:56] obey and keep the commands it makes you
[1:20:57] a wise person that's right 29 verse 3
[1:21:02] all right now this is we're here this is
[1:21:05] what we all want to see his parents who
[1:21:07] so loveth wisdom rejoices his father Oh
[1:21:11] glory that's what I pray for that so I
[1:21:14] want to see a my children I'm sure
[1:21:16] brother John and all of us want to see
[1:21:17] an arc tune children that love the
[1:21:20] wisdom of God in other words they just
[1:21:22] want to keep reading God's Word or
[1:21:24] reading sermon books and and
[1:21:26] understanding God more and more and more
[1:21:28] that will make your parents rejoice amen
[1:21:33] children that love wisdom they're more
[1:21:36] interested in the wisdom of God than
[1:21:38] anything else
[1:21:40] hallelujah that makes your parents that
[1:21:43] makes your parents heart rejoice my my
[1:21:46] son wants to he wants to grow in wisdom
[1:21:48] he loves reading the Word of God or my
[1:21:50] daughters they love reading God's Word
[1:21:52] that's what all parents want I want to
[1:21:55] just I want to do right I want to help
[1:21:57] somebody I want to see my friends say
[1:21:58] but I want to witness to my teacher I
[1:22:00] don't know witness to this verse and
[1:22:02] children that love
[1:22:03] God's Word love the wisdom of God makes
[1:22:06] your parents rejoice Oh hallelujah but
[1:22:09] he that keepeth company with harlots
[1:22:11] spent with his substance so again the
[1:22:13] opposite your company bad company
[1:22:15] corrupts good character that's a pretty
[1:22:18] serious awful company right there
[1:22:20] harlots but loving wisdom so this would
[1:22:25] apply as they get older to trust when
[1:22:27] our children get older that when they
[1:22:29] have the choice like once they turn 18
[1:22:31] they can move out right according to the
[1:22:34] law but I trust that all of our children
[1:22:36] will make the choice I'm gonna stay
[1:22:38] under my parents wisdom and leadership
[1:22:40] until I feel God calling me to leave the
[1:22:43] house weathers through marriage college
[1:22:47] or whatever whatever it is I can afford
[1:22:50] my own apartment now but you see I trust
[1:22:53] that they'll sit under the wisdom of the
[1:22:54] Holy Spirit and put themselves around
[1:22:59] the right kind of individuals surround
[1:23:03] themselves with godly influences that's
[1:23:09] verse three right keep with company the
[1:23:12] hearts spin it's okay loves wisdom for
[1:23:15] example I want to see my children when
[1:23:16] they're 18 let's say let's say 19 or 20
[1:23:18] they get married move out I want to see
[1:23:20] them on a Sunday morning right here to
[1:23:21] hear the word of God or wherever their
[1:23:23] home church is it blessed my heart a few
[1:23:26] weeks ago uh what was that doing I don't
[1:23:30] know where I was that I don't know where
[1:23:33] I was that but I walked in here I think
[1:23:36] I was out I think I oh I went to go pick
[1:23:37] up brother Troy when you Brent remember
[1:23:39] brother Troy I was here on a Sunday
[1:23:40] morning I came back and I just got here
[1:23:43] five minutes before service and look up
[1:23:45] at the screen in the the fellowship room
[1:23:47] and two of my children are here at the
[1:23:48] altar praying and I didn't ask him to
[1:23:51] well what I've been trying to do as I've
[1:23:53] been trying to train them to do that to
[1:23:55] understand if you want to get something
[1:23:57] from God you've got to be in contact
[1:23:59] with God
[1:24:00] because if you draw near to God is God
[1:24:02] gonna avoid you during service no he's
[1:24:05] gonna draw nigh to you draw nigh to God
[1:24:08] he'll draw nigh to you but that just
[1:24:12] bless my heart as a father like I want
[1:24:14] to see that though as they get older
[1:24:15] where it's free will where they'll get
[1:24:17] up early and their own bed on a Sunday
[1:24:19] morning or there they'll come on ass
[1:24:20] Wednesday night of their own accord and
[1:24:22] they'll love the Word of God so much
[1:24:24] that they'll be here every time to hear
[1:24:26] God's Holy Word amen that will make this
[1:24:29] guy rejoice do you think I'm happy now
[1:24:31] I'll be a lot happier then by God's
[1:24:33] grace because of the Bible says it
[1:24:35] rejoices the heart of a father last one
[1:24:41] verse 17 correct thy son and he will
[1:24:47] give the rest
[1:24:49] yay he should give delight unto thy soul
[1:24:52] that's the promise we have as parents if
[1:24:55] we correct our children whether verbally
[1:24:58] or with the rod or however we do it how
[1:25:01] do we correct them we have this hope
[1:25:03] that if we correct them they're gonna
[1:25:05] bring us a lot of blessings this is the
[1:25:08] promise of the scripture we're promised
[1:25:11] rest and a light unto our souls if we
[1:25:15] correct them how many know that as they
[1:25:20] get older it gets harder to correct let
[1:25:21] me know that so we got to start as soon
[1:25:24] as possible right or as soon as we feel
[1:25:26] that of the Holy Spirit it's just got to
[1:25:28] be consistent correction we got to
[1:25:30] constantly whenever we need whenever we
[1:25:32] need to do it correct them and let them
[1:25:33] know if we see it as a parents how much
[1:25:36] more is God seeing it
[1:25:38] God has eyes everywhere right his eyes
[1:25:40] run to and fro on the earth now I just
[1:25:44] want to read this quote maybe you I
[1:25:46] heard this recently brother Rams asking
[1:25:48] for prayer for his family and don't
[1:25:50] forget pray for me and pray for my wife
[1:25:52] the sweetest woman in all the world and
[1:25:54] for my children
[1:25:56] and I now I've claimed them everyone for
[1:25:59] the Lord Jesus now Becky is just at the
[1:26:02] age of little ricotta you've know little
[1:26:04] teeny as we used to call and she's just
[1:26:07] at that age but now she's a very sweet
[1:26:09] girl I thank the Lord for that no
[1:26:10] smoking drinking to run around nothing
[1:26:12] but she's just that age she's carefree
[1:26:14] she don't want to go to church you
[1:26:16] imagine that she's in the prophet's
[1:26:17] house and no one didn't want to go hear
[1:26:20] a prophet preach the Word of God TV I
[1:26:25] let
[1:26:25] children me children we gotta let them
[1:26:26] teenagers be teenagers he just committed
[1:26:29] it unto God she don't want to go to
[1:26:33] church and if she does she sits back
[1:26:35] there chew chewing gum so brother
[1:26:36] branham had seen his daughter chewing
[1:26:38] gum during the service I wonder if the
[1:26:40] Deacons asked her to go spit it out or
[1:26:43] not they should have if I see any use
[1:26:47] chewing gum in here I'm asking you to
[1:26:49] spit it out to you that I see I wonder
[1:26:53] to see it I want her to be filled with
[1:26:55] the Holy Ghost that so when you get the
[1:26:58] Holy Ghost you must want to go to church
[1:27:00] and step chewing on gum you want to chew
[1:27:02] on God's promises his wisdom I want to
[1:27:06] chew on that again preach that again let
[1:27:08] me hear that again raise my faith amen
[1:27:10] and I like this one and I want to see
[1:27:13] Joseph now remember we've been preaching
[1:27:14] on my son I want to see Joseph I want
[1:27:18] that boy I believe that someday when I
[1:27:19] can't walk to the pulpit no more I want
[1:27:21] to take this old worn-out Bible and hand
[1:27:23] it over to him and say Joseph stay with
[1:27:26] it son then I'm ready to climb on up I
[1:27:29] want to hear a wind blowing somewhere
[1:27:31] look up wave my hand and take off look
[1:27:35] at a Father's heart and that just like a
[1:27:36] Father's heart he wants to see all of
[1:27:39] his children loving to go to church
[1:27:41] loving the Word of God fill with the
[1:27:43] Holy Ghost and then he wants to take his
[1:27:45] Bible and hand it to his son and say you
[1:27:48] preach it to you preach the same thing I
[1:27:51] preached I've long desired that maybe
[1:27:53] God will call Malachi to preach one day
[1:27:54] I don't know but I as a I think all
[1:27:57] fathers there's a tire of that don't you
[1:27:59] they want to see their sons be leaders
[1:28:01] maybe not preachers but be leaders
[1:28:03] somehow to be able to know that the next
[1:28:06] generation is going to honor the Word of
[1:28:08] God that my son everything I taught my
[1:28:11] son everything my son heard preached
[1:28:13] he's gonna believe it and he's gonna
[1:28:15] live it and he's gonna keep following
[1:28:17] those bloody footprints of Jesus Christ
[1:28:18] amen this is a desire of a father I just
[1:28:23] want to I want to see my son stay with
[1:28:25] the Word of God amen

[1:29:08] brand was thinking about his natural son
[1:29:09] this brought me to the thought of pause
[1:29:11] spiritual sons and we don't have time to
[1:29:14] read all these but you're probably
[1:29:15] familiar with some of them Paul calls
[1:29:17] the entire Corinthian church my son's
[1:29:20] because he started the church that's in
[1:29:25] first corinthians 4 14 through 17 let's
[1:29:29] read that - I think that's what I like
[1:29:30] to read here cuz this I think this is
[1:29:32] the one where he says remember yeah
[1:29:33] remember my ways through Timothy which I
[1:29:36] taught him and I teach everywhere in
[1:29:38] every church first corinthians 4:14
[1:29:42] please and then maybe Elijah Rebekah
[1:29:44] could you read some of those that'd be
[1:29:45] okay I think it's your turn if that's
[1:29:47] okay
[1:29:49] Elijah could you do 14 and 15 would I be
[1:29:52] alright 1st Corinthians 4 14 and 15 then
[1:29:58] Rebecca maybe if you could do 16 and 17
[1:30:01] maybe I'd be okay whenever you're ready
[1:30:04] Elijah 14 I'm sorry about 14 15 yes sir
[1:30:30] so he called all these men in the
[1:30:32] Corinthian church might be loved' sons
[1:30:34] so Paulette look out of the church and
[1:30:36] say you bunch of rebels like Moses did
[1:30:38] he said I'm warning you because you're
[1:30:41] my beloved sons I love you but I've got
[1:30:44] to warn you you're getting caught up on
[1:30:46] gifts there's sin in the church remember
[1:30:48] their sexual sins in the church there's
[1:30:49] all these things going on the church
[1:30:51] I'm warning you to stay away from that
[1:30:55] and he says though you have ten thousand
[1:30:58] instructors in Christ you have not many
[1:31:00] fathers because Paul begot them to
[1:31:05] Christ now the begot means to birth how
[1:31:07] we know that so that means these people
[1:31:09] receive the baptism the Holy Ghost under
[1:31:13] Paul's ministry
[1:31:15] alright so Rebecca could you try sixteen
[1:31:18] and seventeen timotheus all right thanks
[1:31:39] add your Rebecca I appreciate that how
[1:31:41] did you catch that Paul calls all the
[1:31:44] men my beloved sons and then he says
[1:31:46] Timothy my son he says follow me he
[1:31:49] tells all the church follow my example
[1:31:51] I'm the one you received the Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] I'm the ministry you receive the Holy
[1:31:55] Ghost under he says so follow my example
[1:31:58] and then he says listen to Timothy
[1:32:00] because Timothy learned everything he
[1:32:03] learned from me and he said he's gonna
[1:32:05] Timothy is gonna teach you everything
[1:32:06] that that I know praise God so these are
[1:32:12] spiritual sons a spiritual son is
[1:32:15] someone that got the Holy Ghost through
[1:32:16] your ministry right in this case Timothy
[1:32:22] was a spiritual son to Paul and I like
[1:32:25] that he taught everything that Paul
[1:32:27] preached amen
[1:32:29] that's what I believe I do by the grace
[1:32:31] of the Lord now he calls him son for
[1:32:36] numerous more times in 1st Timothy 1 1 &
[1:32:38] 2 verse 18 as well
[1:32:40] 2nd Timothy 1 verse 2
[1:32:43] now look at this church Paul even
[1:32:44] circumcised Timothy before going on many
[1:32:47] missionary trips because the Jews didn't
[1:32:50] like him he was half Greek after you he
[1:32:53] said we can't have this this mixed
[1:32:55] person with us he's mixed so Paul said
[1:32:58] fine we'll circumcise him he went and
[1:33:00] circumcised Timothy and they went on
[1:33:01] many trips and then the Jews would
[1:33:03] receive him and not only that but Paul
[1:33:09] knew the prophecies about Timothy's
[1:33:11] gifts the Bible said there was
[1:33:12] prophecies that were set over Timothy
[1:33:15] when he before he started the ministry
[1:33:16] he's going to be a missionary he'll be
[1:33:18] an evangelist he'll be a preacher of
[1:33:20] God's Word all these things he's must
[1:33:22] say the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:24] Timothy here impart of what the gift of
[1:33:26] the Holy Ghost to preach God's Word and
[1:33:28] Paul knew that and so he learned under
[1:33:31] Paul he got saved under Paul's ministry
[1:33:33] Paul taught him everything he knew and
[1:33:36] then Paul could trust him that Timothy
[1:33:39] is gonna teach everything I teach amen
[1:33:45] onesimus in Philemon 1 verse 10 remember
[1:33:49] the story Onesimus had run away from
[1:33:54] Philemon remember that he was a slave
[1:33:56] he'd run away and he stole things from
[1:33:59] Philemon and so he was on the we must
[1:34:01] have thought even on the way to see Paul
[1:34:03] there's my timer again I'm trying to
[1:34:05] finish it and he must have gotten the
[1:34:09] presence of Paul and the Holy Spirit
[1:34:12] convicted him and made him repent and
[1:34:14] who nessam escaped under Paul's ministry
[1:34:16] and then Paul turns around right
[1:34:19] Philemon a letter and said whatever
[1:34:21] Onesimus owes you he's my son the gospel
[1:34:24] put it on my account and I'll pay you
[1:34:26] back
[1:34:27] these are Paul's spiritual sons someone
[1:34:31] you lead to Christ someone that you
[1:34:33] someone that you pray for and they get
[1:34:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:34:37] your spiritual that's a man's spiritual
[1:34:38] son in the Lord now I know for sure
[1:34:44] I prayed over people and they've got the
[1:34:45] Holy Ghost cuz they've told me but I
[1:34:47] don't think any of this church so I'm
[1:34:50] not really their spiritual father in a
[1:34:51] way like where Paul he could pray for
[1:34:54] them they get the Holy Ghost and then
[1:34:55] they would learn everything from Paul
[1:34:57] that's what I would like to see that in
[1:34:59] Akron if God terry's I would like to
[1:35:01] pray for some man they'd be filled with
[1:35:03] the Holy Ghost and then they would learn
[1:35:05] everything I taught them that I would
[1:35:08] know that they're younger than me that
[1:35:09] when I left the scene or God called me
[1:35:11] off the scene I know somebody would be
[1:35:12] there to teach them the Word of God I
[1:35:14] would like that now I need to start
[1:35:16] praying for that because I'm getting
[1:35:18] older now
[1:35:18] x times fine I need to start praying for
[1:35:21] that I started out as a 25 year old
[1:35:23] pastor and I'm close to 40 you know so I
[1:35:25] need to think about those things but he
[1:35:28] led him to Christ while he was in prison
[1:35:30] and lastly let's say our feet here I'm
[1:35:33] gonna disclose her lastly Paul calls
[1:35:36] Titus my son in the faith in Titus was
[1:35:40] also converted through Paul's ministry
[1:35:42] so see Paul had all these sons there
[1:35:45] were people that they saw Christ in
[1:35:47] Paul's life they got saved or they got
[1:35:50] baptized with the Holy Ghost and then
[1:35:52] they wouldn't Alert from Paul or Paul
[1:35:54] would place them and say you know you
[1:35:55] need to stay you need to stay in this
[1:35:59] city and you're gonna be a pastor I
[1:36:01] believe God's leading you to stay here
[1:36:03] and be a pastor you're gonna be a bishop
[1:36:05] Titus or Timothy you're gonna be an
[1:36:08] event do the work of evangelist make
[1:36:10] full proof of your ministry now that
[1:36:14] this is not organizational leave the
[1:36:16] leadership right this is not a
[1:36:18] denominational this is all that of the
[1:36:20] Holy Spirit it's different if somebody
[1:36:22] tells you well the board of directors at
[1:36:24] the Missionary Baptist Church told me
[1:36:25] you have to stay in Akron for five years
[1:36:27] that's man lead it's different but if
[1:36:30] someone some sister prophesizes I'm
[1:36:32] brother prophesize say thus saith the
[1:36:34] Lord this preacher you so-and-so you're
[1:36:36] got to get the pastoring you'll be
[1:36:37] pastoring Akron in 20 years or five
[1:36:40] years whatever God that's different
[1:36:42] that's not man placing a person there
[1:36:45] that's God placing you there and that's
[1:36:47] what Timothy had he had a prophecy that
[1:36:50] went over his life thus saith the Lord
[1:36:52] Timothy he's gonna be the first bishop
[1:36:54] their own that's what I'm they're not
[1:36:55] Bishop Tyrone Bishop to Ephesus that's
[1:36:57] what brother Branson
[1:36:58] Timothy was the first bishop of Ephesus
[1:37:02] so he had the state the Lord he he
[1:37:05] wasn't guessing I wonder if Timothy's
[1:37:06] gonna be a good preacher I wonder if
[1:37:08] he'll stick it out I wonder if he'll
[1:37:09] give up after a few years he knew this
[1:37:13] man has a prophecy over his life I've
[1:37:15] seen him get born again in fact I was
[1:37:17] just listened to brother bran this week
[1:37:18] and he said he was talking about a woman
[1:37:20] in the message letting off the pressure
[1:37:24] and he just did a funeral for a woman an
[1:37:28] old mother and he looks out at during
[1:37:31] the funeral and he says children could
[1:37:33] you ask for a better mother and they
[1:37:34] said no he said could you ask for a
[1:37:38] better one to love you and they said no
[1:37:41] brother branham said he said how could
[1:37:44] this woman now he's at the funeral
[1:37:45] looking at the casket how could this
[1:37:47] woman not rise again if a flower can die
[1:37:50] and rise again how can this woman who
[1:37:53] has all this witness of godly life with
[1:37:56] godly children live true to her husband
[1:37:57] all those days if she lived true to her
[1:37:59] husband did all these things godly how
[1:38:01] could she not rise again amen hallelujah
[1:38:05] and program said I know she's gonna rise
[1:38:08] again because I had the pleasure of
[1:38:10] seeing life come into her when she got
[1:38:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:38:15] so he saw eternal life come into her so
[1:38:20] he said I know I'll see her rise again
[1:38:22] he was a witness of this person being
[1:38:24] birth in the kingdom of God amen
[1:38:29] last scriptures that is my last night
[1:38:33] look that's my lesson
[1:38:37] third john 1:1 - four familiar but in
[1:38:44] this context I hope it has a little more
[1:38:46] power to your life to your heart and
[1:38:48] mind third John 1 the
[1:38:55] to the well-beloved Gaius whom I love in
[1:38:57] the truth beloved I wish above all
[1:39:00] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[1:39:01] in health even as I saw prosperous for I
[1:39:05] rejoice greatly when the Brethren came
[1:39:07] and testified of the truth that is in
[1:39:09] thee even as thou walkest in the truth I
[1:39:13] have no greater joy than to hear that my
[1:39:18] children walk in the truth amen children
[1:39:23] there's nothing you can do to make your
[1:39:25] parents happier than to love Jesus
[1:39:28] Christ with all your heart and the walk
[1:39:30] in truth now that's not why you do it
[1:39:32] you know you you do it because you love
[1:39:34] Jesus Christ you love the cross you want
[1:39:36] to be forgiven you for God so loved the
[1:39:38] world you love God because of God loved
[1:39:40] you but part of that part of the effect
[1:39:45] of loving God and loving Christ is that
[1:39:47] your children your parents will never be
[1:39:48] happier when you walk in the truth I
[1:39:51] remember the truths got to be in you too
[1:39:53] you gotta have the born-again experience
[1:39:55] got to have it inside you the truth must
[1:39:59] be in you you must walk in it and then
[1:40:02] the the Saints and the the elders the
[1:40:05] parents they have no greater joy than
[1:40:07] that and let me see if I read proverbs
[1:40:11] 23 15 yet I might have already read that
[1:40:15] I can't remember so part of me yeah my
[1:40:24] son if thine heart be wise my heart
[1:40:27] shall rejoice even mine
[1:40:29] amen praise the Lord let's stop right
[1:40:32] there by the grace of Lord hallelujah I
[1:40:37] love this Word of God I truly love this
[1:40:41] Word of God as we
[1:40:48] clothes here let's think about all these
[1:40:49] things I'm just looking back through my
[1:40:51] notes here I'm sure all of our sisters
[1:40:56] here want to be sisters of strength
[1:40:58] how many would say that Sarah
[1:41:03] Rahab got placed in the Hall of Fame of
[1:41:06] faith for receiving strength from God I
[1:41:08] wonder if we could receive some strength
[1:41:10] tonight receive a little extra strength
[1:41:12] tonight by the grace of God and then for
[1:41:16] our children of course all of us to even
[1:41:18] adults can learn from these things but
[1:41:20] to be wise by being wise you save
[1:41:25] yourself so much pain and you bring so
[1:41:29] much joy children to your parents when
[1:41:31] you make the right decisions and you
[1:41:33] walk in the truth so let's pray to God
[1:41:41] give us grace to accomplish all those
[1:41:42] I'm gonna pray also that God will give
[1:41:44] me a spiritual son to someone that if
[1:41:47] this work goes on they'll be taught the
[1:41:50] Word of God and be able to carry on if
[1:41:53] something should ever happen to me by
[1:41:55] the grace of Lord I think they'd be good
[1:41:56] time to pray for this because they got
[1:41:57] preached today let's bow our heads with
