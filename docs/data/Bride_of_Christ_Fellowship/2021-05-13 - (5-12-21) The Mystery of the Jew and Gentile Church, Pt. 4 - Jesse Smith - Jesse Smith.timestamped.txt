[25:27] then we'll read the memory verse
[25:28] together tonight
[25:30] by the grace of the lord which in other
[25:32] ages was not made known
[25:34] unto the sons of men as it is now
[25:37] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[25:39] prophets
[25:40] by the spirit that the gentiles should
[25:42] be fellow heirs and of the same body
[25:44] and partakers of his promise in christ
[25:47] by the gospel
[25:51] i'm so glad i can partake of his promise
[25:54] praise god not just hear about it not
[25:56] just think about it
[25:57] but i actually partake of it i'm a
[26:01] i'm a benefiter i'm an heir of the
[26:03] promise
[26:05] verse 7 wherefore i was made a minister
[26:07] according to the gift of grace of god
[26:09] given unto
[26:10] me by the effectual working of his power
[26:13] i like verse 8 though unto me
[26:14] who am less than the least of all saints
[26:20] is this grace given less than
[26:23] the least uh what a humble man paul was
[26:27] i'm less than the least
[26:30] thank god for grace let's go to psalms
[26:32] 19 here
[26:43] psalm 19 verse 13 and 14 we'll read this
[26:46] one together here
[26:55] let's read verses 13 and 14 ask the lord
[26:57] to write this upon
[26:58] the fleshly tables of our hearts here
[27:00] tonight
[27:02] let's read that on three one two three
[27:04] keep back
[27:05] thy servant also from presumptuous sins
[27:09] let them not have dominion over me
[27:12] then shall i be upright and i shall be
[27:15] innocent from the great transgression
[27:18] let the words of my mouth and the
[27:21] meditation
[27:22] of my heart be acceptable in thy
[27:25] sight o lord my strength and my redeemer
[27:29] amen may god add his blessings to the
[27:31] ring of his word you may be seated
[27:33] praise god
[27:46] we'll look at part four tonight on this
[27:48] mystery of the jew and gentile church
[27:51] uh brother branham calls it uh the
[27:54] longer version the mystery of the new
[27:55] testament new testament church rather
[27:57] composed of both jew and gentile
[28:01] amen i'm going to pick up right where we
[28:02] left off here i've been really enjoying
[28:04] this series here it's been a real
[28:05] blessing
[28:06] uh i got a little story to kind of go
[28:08] along with it uh
[28:10] tonight we just had a we had some guests
[28:12] over a couple weeks ago and
[28:14] my wife had a nice little opportunity to
[28:16] share the word of god with one of her
[28:18] friends it's just a really nice
[28:19] testimony but before that let's go to
[28:22] acts 13 here
[28:24] in acts 13 uh paul
[28:28] i think i'll lord willing i think uh
[28:32] we'll go to acts 13 and uh we see paul
[28:34] here
[28:35] uh finally gets to go to the gentiles we
[28:38] ended last week by looking at peter and
[28:40] paul
[28:40] how they were men of failures right
[28:42] they'd failed god one way or the other
[28:44] paul was uh consenting unto murder of
[28:47] stephen
[28:48] right a legalistic person he failed god
[28:50] that way
[28:51] peter was the opposite uh not very
[28:54] legalistic but he just lost
[28:55] all of his all of his dignity lying
[28:58] cussing
[28:59] i'm sorry not lying but cussing and
[29:01] running deserting jesus
[29:02] in the very hour jesus would need
[29:04] someone to stand with him
[29:06] but the bible said the sheep would be
[29:07] scattered right from the shepherd
[29:10] and so uh here but yet god's grace
[29:13] comes to these two men and then one has
[29:16] uh
[29:16] a ministry uh the ministry to the
[29:18] circumcision
[29:19] peter and then paul has the ministry of
[29:21] circumcision
[29:22] uh ministry to the uncircumcision the
[29:24] gentiles
[29:26] but in acts 13 here we get to see the
[29:28] moment paul
[29:29] turns to the gentiles and i just want to
[29:32] pull out a couple
[29:33] thoughts in here that may encourage you
[29:37] as i was reading this today i was i was
[29:39] uh
[29:41] i was just kind of remembering you know
[29:42] the reason many times people get mad at
[29:44] you as a christian
[29:45] is because they're jealous of you that's
[29:48] many times the reason
[29:50] someone will get mad at you and that's
[29:51] kind of what happened to paul here
[29:53] as paul started taking the gospel to the
[29:55] gentiles
[29:56] the jews got a
[29:59] uh if you've done nothing wrong and
[30:02] you're just living a christian life and
[30:04] testifying and you're loving the lord
[30:06] and someone kind of gets mad
[30:08] at you and uh they're accusing you that
[30:10] then many times it's just
[30:11] jealousy and that's kind of what the
[30:14] scripture says remember the bible said
[30:16] all k all contention comes by what
[30:19] pride right so see that's why they're
[30:21] jealous
[30:23] you know they're prideful that you know
[30:24] they they want their way they want all
[30:26] the attention or they they want the
[30:27] the gifts of that you have or they want
[30:29] the attention that you have
[30:30] and so we see that here as paul
[30:32] ministers to the jews
[30:41] okay so just to back up a little bit on
[30:43] the story here this is paul's first
[30:45] missionary journey
[30:46] he's in antioch which we know christians
[30:48] were first called christians
[30:50] in antioch what a what a testimony that
[30:53] is there
[30:54] there was never the word christian
[30:55] before until
[30:57] these uh gentiles got the holy ghost and
[31:00] when these gentiles and antioch got the
[31:01] holy ghost they said they're so much
[31:03] like christ
[31:04] they're christ-like they're christians
[31:07] what a testimony praise god
[31:09] that you're so much like jesus christ
[31:11] that you take his name amen
[31:14] what a what a beautiful testimony that
[31:16] these
[31:17] gentiles receive they're so much like
[31:19] christ
[31:20] they call them christians
[31:23] and so paul and barnabas go to antioch
[31:26] and and the bible said
[31:28] uh here that they they go into the
[31:31] synagogue
[31:32] and uh they wait for an opportunity to
[31:35] speak
[31:36] and that's kind of what i'm feeling led
[31:37] to do i've been talking about this for
[31:38] about six months
[31:39] once my book comes out i'm feeling led
[31:41] to just go to churches and
[31:43] i just kind of feel compelled to share
[31:45] this message with somebody
[31:46] anybody that will listen uh but just to
[31:49] go and wait for an opportunity to speak
[31:52] and so paul and barnabas go and wait and
[31:55] uh can you pull up proverbs 18 16 honey
[31:57] we'll just pull that up real quick
[32:00] remember a church that they were sent
[32:01] out by prayer and fasting by the holy
[32:03] ghost and that's what i would before i'd
[32:05] go i'd have to do that too
[32:06] i want to pray and fast and feel the
[32:08] leading of the lord i kind of mentioned
[32:10] this in my prayer earlier
[32:11] a man's gift maketh room for him and
[32:15] bringeth
[32:15] him before great men now we know paul
[32:19] eventually went before you know
[32:20] festus and different ones leaders and he
[32:22] went before great men
[32:24] but here jesus sent him out
[32:27] ministering a missionary work and
[32:31] uh he he had a gift to be a prophet
[32:33] right we saw that he was a prisoner to
[32:35] his gift
[32:36] and so eventually he sat there and he
[32:38] just laid in there in the synagogue
[32:40] and then god opened up a door for him to
[32:42] talk right
[32:44] for him to preach that's in acts 13.
[32:49] and so you probably are familiar with
[32:51] the story a little bit but
[32:52] but god's word is true gifts make
[32:55] room for themselves so paul didn't have
[32:58] to beg anybody to preach paul didn't
[32:59] have to
[33:00] persuade anybody can i say a word the
[33:02] bible said that
[33:04] they just offered him an opportunity to
[33:06] speak praise god
[33:08] and so if god sends you to do anything
[33:10] he's going to provide
[33:11] opportunities for you
[33:14] if god wants you to witness to someone
[33:16] and god's going to give you
[33:17] a listener that wants to hear it praise
[33:20] god
[33:22] because god's gift make room for
[33:24] themselves
[33:26] everywhere i've gone and preached i've
[33:27] never asked i never had to beg anybody
[33:29] to preach right the doors have just
[33:30] always opened for me
[33:32] right that's i've always taken that
[33:34] approach if if god sends me
[33:36] he's gonna uh make a way for me to get
[33:38] there he's gonna make a way for me to
[33:40] minister
[33:40] the door's going to be open
[33:44] now in this chapter it's a beautiful
[33:46] chapter uh the
[33:48] you know he about verse 14 he goes down
[33:51] to the synagogue
[33:52] and the bible says in verse 15 ye men
[33:57] and brethren if any of
[33:58] have any word of exhortation for the
[34:00] people say on so they just said if
[34:02] anybody has anything to say
[34:03] go ahead and stand up and paul of course
[34:06] paul takes his opportunity
[34:08] well this is what i've been waiting for
[34:10] paul stands up
[34:11] and he preaches the history of the law
[34:15] he starts at moses and goes to joshua
[34:17] like we've been preaching on joshua and
[34:20] then he goes through the judges kings
[34:22] and then he skips forward from the kings
[34:24] and goes to john the baptist
[34:26] praise god and then he and then he goes
[34:29] from john the baptist to the one
[34:30] john was talking about jesus christ this
[34:33] is around
[34:34] 1844. this is 14
[34:37] years after calvary imagine that 14
[34:40] years our church is 15 years old in a
[34:42] couple weeks
[34:43] 14 years after calvary and paul's
[34:47] finally sharing the gospel with these
[34:49] antioch people these jews
[34:52] so he preaches jesus death and
[34:55] resurrection can i say like this today
[34:57] if the gospel was just as fresh 14 years
[35:01] after calvary it's just as fresh today
[35:04] praise god
[35:05] almost 2 000 years after calvary amen
[35:08] right because if it's fresh 14 years
[35:10] it's going to be fresh
[35:11] 1400 years and now 2 000 years
[35:14] it's just as fresh because the blood is
[35:16] still on the mercy seat praise god
[35:19] christ is still on the throne amen
[35:21] hallelujah
[35:22] the blood will never lose its power amen
[35:25] as long as the the messiah the savior
[35:28] the christ
[35:28] is on the throne then the power of god
[35:31] is in effect today amen
[35:32] it's when he steps off that throne
[35:34] that's when the there's no more covenant
[35:37] right
[35:37] there's no more opportunity for them to
[35:39] get the holy ghost the gentiles speaking
[35:42] but this is our time as i said like last
[35:44] week this is the times of the gentiles
[35:46] church this is your time this is my time
[35:49] jesus said this is the acceptable year
[35:51] of the lord
[35:52] it's your year amen it's my year it's

[38:01] broken hearts
[38:02] glory we proclaim liberty to the
[38:06] captives we don't have to be bound by
[38:07] the spirit of depression
[38:09] right we don't have to be bound by the
[38:11] spirit of greed right
[38:12] or the spirit of fear or the spirit of
[38:14] lust we are proclaiming
[38:16] you're free in jesus name that's my
[38:19] message
[38:20] that's the message of the brother
[38:21] abraham gave us we are free
[38:23] in jesus name amen we're proclaiming
[38:26] liberty to the captives and the opening
[38:29] of the prison to them that are bound see
[38:31] along the same lines
[38:33] you can be free you don't have to stay
[38:35] uh captive you don't have to stay a
[38:36] prisoner
[38:37] you can walk out of that prison jesus
[38:39] christ opened the prison doors
[38:41] you just got to walk out praise god he
[38:44] paid your fine amen he paid your ransom
[38:46] right
[38:47] you don't you no longer are bound in the
[38:49] prison the ransom is paid
[38:52] now verse two is where brother shows us
[38:54] uh jesus
[38:55] paused this here he he fulfilled the
[38:57] first part
[38:58] but not the second part of the verse to
[39:01] proclaim the acceptable
[39:03] year of the lord and that's where jesus
[39:06] stopped in luke chapter four he read
[39:08] this portion of the scroll
[39:09] but he stopped right there to proclaim
[39:12] the acceptable year of the lord he
[39:13] closed the scroll
[39:14] sat down and everybody was watching him
[39:16] he said this day
[39:18] this scripture is fulfilled amen praise
[39:21] god right
[39:22] and jesus still said jesus went to
[39:23] heaven and said you cast out devils
[39:25] you pray for the sick you'll speak with
[39:28] tongues praise god
[39:29] all these things he promised all these
[39:31] things that means this
[39:32] is still the acceptable year of the lord
[39:35] amen
[39:37] now the day of vengeance of our lord
[39:39] that's the tribulation
[39:40] right to come for all to comfort all
[39:42] that more
[39:44] so brother showed us jesus stopped after
[39:46] that first phrase
[39:48] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[39:49] lord this is the year of the lord this
[39:52] is like we sing it this is the year of
[39:54] jubilee praise god
[39:56] this is the year we don't have to be
[39:58] bound we don't have to be slaves right
[40:00] we ought to be encouraged we ought to be
[40:02] strong in the lord we ought to be very
[40:04] courageous amen this is our opportunity
[40:06] this is your time my time to do
[40:08] something with god's word
[40:11] hallelujah now back to acts 13.
[40:14] ah he said hey anybody got anybody
[40:16] anybody got anything good to say
[40:18] go ahead and say on paul says i'll stand
[40:20] up and preach
[40:22] let me preach the acceptable year of the
[40:23] lord amen he was just waiting he was led
[40:26] by the holy spirit
[40:27] he sat in that synagogue just waiting
[40:29] for the opportunity
[40:31] god had arranged it perfectly because he
[40:33] knew a great multitude
[40:34] of antioch christians would believe amen
[40:38] of course they weren't christians then
[40:39] but they became christians
[40:41] paul stood up and preached the gospel
[40:44] he gave a warning to anyone
[40:47] that would reject it and then the bible
[40:51] said that the next
[40:52] sabbath they came together again
[40:56] praise god let me just see if i can find
[40:59] that here briefly here
[41:03] yes yeah so verse 42 says they come the
[41:06] next sabbath
[41:07] and verse 43 now when the congregation
[41:09] was broken up many of the jews and
[41:10] religious prosecutes follow paul and
[41:12] barnabas
[41:13] who speak to them persuaded them to
[41:14] continue in the grace of god so paul was
[41:18] persuading them continuing salvation by
[41:21] grace
[41:21] continue in grace not law stay in the
[41:24] grace of god right
[41:25] verse 44 the next sabbath day came
[41:28] almost the whole city together
[41:30] to hear the word of god so now almost
[41:32] the whole city wants to hear they had a
[41:33] great
[41:34] big stir paul preached a lot of people
[41:36] started believing
[41:37] now the news spreads see when something
[41:40] real happens in your life you got to
[41:41] spread the news
[41:43] right when jesus does something for you
[41:45] you just can't help but you got to
[41:46] spread it praise god
[41:48] hallelujah it spread throughout the
[41:50] whole city
[41:52] verse 45 but when the jews saw the
[41:54] multitudes they were filled with enemies
[41:55] so this is what i was saying
[41:57] when when uh when god has
[42:00] favor on you people get jealous of you
[42:03] right and speak against those things
[42:05] which were spoken by paul
[42:07] contradicting and blaspheming so the
[42:09] jews see all this big crowd come
[42:11] and they get jealous they get angry
[42:13] right
[42:14] and then paul and barnabas waxed bold
[42:16] and said it was necessary
[42:17] that the word of god should first have
[42:19] been spoken to you but seeing you put it
[42:21] from you and judge yourselves unworthy
[42:23] of everlasting life
[42:25] lo we turn to the gentiles
[42:28] and there it is right there
[42:31] and for so the lord hath commanded us
[42:33] saying i have set thee to be a light of
[42:35] the gentiles
[42:36] that thou should be for uh salvation
[42:39] unto the ends of the earth
[42:41] and when the gentiles heard this they
[42:42] were glad and glorified the word of the
[42:44] lord
[42:44] and as many as were ordained to er
[42:47] eternal life
[42:48] believed and the word of the lord was
[42:50] published throughout
[42:51] all the region now isn't that something
[42:54] the gentiles rejoice now look church
[42:56] what what are they showing
[42:58] paul's showing them that before they had
[43:00] no connection to moses
[43:02] right no connection to joshua the judges
[43:04] the king
[43:05] david john they had no connection the
[43:07] gentiles had no connection because of
[43:09] the law
[43:10] but paul's saying no now you are you are
[43:12] connected to them
[43:14] but now you have grace instead of law
[43:17] those people are part of your heritage
[43:19] amen
[43:20] they're a part of your heritage and so
[43:22] that was good news to them
[43:23] i can look back and i i realize uh uh
[43:26] moses i can believe moses but moses was
[43:29] pointing
[43:30] this is what moses pointed to this is
[43:32] what joshua pointed to
[43:34] amen nobody can say that i don't have a
[43:37] part with them
[43:38] they could say we have a part with them
[43:40] we have the further revelation of what
[43:42] they were preaching praise god
[43:43] amen they weren't cut off from the
[43:46] patriarchs they weren't cut off from the
[43:48] prophets
[43:48] they were the fulfillment of the
[43:50] prophets
[43:51] did we just read it last week church
[43:53] they were the fulfillment of jeremiah
[43:55] isaiah
[43:56] hosea right all these prophets in other
[43:59] words
[43:59] they wrote about me amen isaiah they
[44:02] could say isaiah
[44:03] wrote about me church we can say the
[44:05] same thing hosea wrote about you amen
[44:09] hallelujah ezekiel wrote about you
[44:12] uh jeremiah wrote about you all these
[44:15] prophets can i say like this
[44:16] god spoke about you to abraham in
[44:18] genesis chapter 12.
[44:20] right you're not disconnected from them
[44:23] you're connected for them
[44:25] you are the very fulfillment of what
[44:27] they talked about
[44:28] praise god oh church we could get a
[44:30] grasp of that tonight amen
[44:32] we are the fulfillment we are what they
[44:35] wanted to see
[44:36] and what they wanted to experience
[44:38] praise god
[44:41] church remember the bible said every
[44:44] sacrifice they had they left there with
[44:46] a
[44:46] with still a defiled conscience you
[44:49] don't think they wanted to see this day
[44:51] you don't think they wanted to see the
[44:53] day where they'd have to worry about
[44:54] animals anymore
[44:55] it was all by faith and grace and they
[44:57] could actually feel forgiven by the holy
[44:59] spirit
[44:59] you don't think they wanted to see that
[45:01] the bible said even the angels look
[45:03] wanted to look into those things amen
[45:05] hallelujah the bible jesus said those
[45:08] prophets
[45:08] longed to see these days that jesus was
[45:11] preaching
[45:12] right and so we are the fulfillment oh
[45:15] we should be praising god amen
[45:18] oh my what a blessing church it was
[45:21] necessary did you catch that it was
[45:23] necessary
[45:24] the word of god should have first been
[45:26] preached to you
[45:28] he said but lo now we turn
[45:32] to the gentiles anybody had everyone
[45:36] and anybody ever felt uh someone was
[45:38] jealous of them
[45:39] because you had the blessings of god on
[45:41] your life that's what happened to the
[45:44] paul barnabas and the antioch uh
[45:46] gentiles right
[45:50] they were just totally uh jealous
[45:53] because of the blessing of god upon
[45:55] their life
[45:59] now church i want to i like if you would
[46:01] just let's look at a few scriptures here
[46:04] this particular text right here
[46:07] proves something i i just want to make
[46:09] sure i i state it the the right way
[46:12] yeah let's go to verse 46 can you put up
[46:14] verse 46 again there verse 46
[46:18] this particular verse proves that
[46:20] blinded jews
[46:22] are responsible for their blindness
[46:27] i'm going to say that again this verse
[46:29] proves
[46:30] that when god blinded the jews they
[46:33] actually wanted to be blind
[46:36] he didn't blind them and they didn't
[46:38] want to be blind he blinded them because
[46:40] they wanted to be blind
[46:44] okay in other words god's not going to
[46:46] blind somebody
[46:47] without their will to be blinded right
[46:50] because the the gospel was available to
[46:52] them
[46:53] they were now they preached at 14 years
[46:54] right paul after 14 years finally says
[46:57] hello
[46:57] we turn to the gentiles now he wasn't
[46:59] preaching that whole time but i'm just
[47:00] giving you
[47:01] an idea the jews had 14 years to receive
[47:03] that message
[47:05] and they turned it down now here's where
[47:07] it is
[47:08] seeing you put it from you you judge
[47:11] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[47:14] so when god blinded the jews it's
[47:16] because they didn't want to receive it
[47:19] and people that are blind today the
[47:21] bible said they're blinded by the god of
[47:23] this world
[47:24] satan and the reason they're blind is
[47:26] because they want to be blind
[47:28] the bible says they don't want to retain
[47:31] the knowledge of god in their minds and
[47:32] so because of that
[47:34] god gives them over to believe a lie oh
[47:36] church you ought to be so happy
[47:38] that you don't have a reprobate mind
[47:39] amen you don't serve the god of this
[47:41] world
[47:42] your eyes are open and you see the truth
[47:44] of god's word
[47:45] you see it clearly you rejoice in it
[47:47] praise god and god has turned his favor
[47:49] toward you amen
[47:51] and you're not blinded you see the light
[47:53] amen
[47:54] oh hallelujah
[47:58] church they wanted to the bible said
[48:00] they wanted they turned
[48:01] themselves they judged themselves
[48:05] we've got to be sure we judge ourselves
[48:07] the right way too
[48:08] right because each service we either
[48:10] leave closer to god or further away from
[48:12] god
[48:13] right you judge yourself right you judge
[48:15] am i am i
[48:16] living the gospel or not right you judge
[48:19] yourself
[48:20] either worthy or unworthy of that
[48:24] and so this is a great this is a great
[48:26] scripture that we have
[48:28] and so god says well after 14 years if
[48:31] you don't want it
[48:31] i'm going to give it to the
[48:32] hungry-hearted people like we saw last
[48:35] week
[48:35] if somebody won't take up a ministry god
[48:37] will give it to somebody
[48:38] else i think i'm sorry that was sunday i
[48:41] think it's mother's day
[48:42] yeah that's mother's day if somebody
[48:44] won't take a position
[48:45] if you won't fill the position god's
[48:47] called you to do god will find somebody
[48:49] else to do it or he'll take the
[48:50] candlestick totally away
[48:51] right that was ephesus god told ephesus
[48:53] i'm taking the candlestick away
[48:55] within 50 years of i'm sorry within 20
[48:58] years of that letter
[48:59] ephesus was almost uninhabited god took
[49:02] the candlestick away
[49:05] so for us it's a warning if we don't let
[49:06] the light of jesus christ shine
[49:08] god could take the church out of akron
[49:10] there could be no church in akron
[49:11] right if we don't repent constantly
[49:15] if we don't keep our first love god can
[49:17] remove the candlestick or he'll raise
[49:19] somebody else
[49:20] up to do it oh let's make the most of
[49:21] this year that we have amen
[49:24] let's make the most of it this is our
[49:25] time it's our opportunity praise god
[49:27] let's put everything we got into it
[49:29] praise god
[49:30] like this weekend i know it's a lot of
[49:32] services but we got to put everything we
[49:34] got into it praise god
[49:36] we got to do everything we can because
[49:37] we can see over the years people will
[49:39] compromise on one service and compromise
[49:41] on another pretty soon within a few
[49:42] years or months we never see him anymore
[49:44] right
[49:44] because they compromise and they don't
[49:46] live the gospel
[49:48] satan has somehow set up some something
[49:50] that's more attractive than the word of
[49:52] god oh my
[49:53] look at that look at the lie that he he
[49:55] gets people to believe
[49:56] lies that something of the world is more
[49:59] valuable than eternal life
[50:00] let me tell you there's nothing more
[50:02] valuable than eternal life amen
[50:04] than the word of god what could be more
[50:06] important than god's word and
[50:08] and and learning how to be like christ
[50:11] being a christian
[50:12] amen being like christ what could be
[50:15] more valuable than that but the bible
[50:17] said they judge themselves
[50:18] unworthy of everlasting life
[50:22] and remember brotherhood said that he
[50:24] said man don't he said god don't send
[50:26] anybody to hell brother man said right
[50:28] what's he talking about this scripture
[50:29] right here
[50:31] they send themselves to hell right
[50:35] because it's their choice right the word
[50:38] they've heard the word
[50:39] either accept it or reject it so this
[50:41] proves god doesn't blind anybody
[50:43] outside of their perfect i'm sorry
[50:45] outside of their free will
[50:47] right they have to they have to turn it
[50:50] down
[50:52] now church after many more uh missionary
[50:55] travels it's beautiful paul returns to
[50:57] antioch
[50:58] in acts 14 27. if you could pull that up
[51:01] and he testifies all that god did to the
[51:03] gentiles
[51:05] in verse 27 he said that when they were
[51:06] come had gathered the church together
[51:09] they rehearse all that god had done with
[51:11] them
[51:13] and how he had opened the door of faith
[51:16] unto the gentiles the only reason god
[51:18] could open the door
[51:19] was because the jews closed the door oh
[51:22] man our door is always open for jesus
[51:24] may we always invite the holy ghost holy
[51:26] ghost come on in
[51:27] cleanse us of our sin increase our faith
[51:30] for miracles amen right
[51:32] increase our boldness to speak the word
[51:34] of god always come in change our lives
[51:37] make us more pure make us more like you
[51:39] make us more holy praise god
[51:41] amen we've got to open the door because
[51:43] the jews closed the door they're blinded
[51:45] and now the door's open to the gentiles
[51:48] and jesus said i
[51:49] am the door amen yeah he rehearses it
[51:53] the door of faith that's jesus we've
[51:55] opened
[51:56] jesus unto the gentiles
[52:00] oh i think that's a beautiful scripture
[52:02] see all are responsible
[52:04] to open the door to christ each and
[52:06] every one of us
[52:10] and god doesn't blind anybody outside of
[52:12] their
[52:13] free will god has to work with free more
[52:16] agency
[52:17] i want to get this next thought here
[52:20] so the next thought i take is paul's
[52:23] gospel
[52:24] is christ's judgment standard
[52:28] so to say to say paul's teachings are
[52:31] important is a huge
[52:33] gross understatement right
[52:36] just as if you just said oh paul's
[52:38] paul's teachings are pretty important
[52:39] that's a huge understatement paul's
[52:43] words are
[52:43] of the utmost importance they're of
[52:46] supreme importance
[52:48] is that right he was he was
[52:51] the messenger the prophet to the
[52:53] gentiles he was a teacher to the
[52:55] gentiles
[52:57] he was the minister of the gospel to the
[53:00] uncircumcision
[53:04] and the bible places curses on anyone
[53:07] who changes paul's teachings
[53:10] because they are the judgment standard
[53:13] on judgment
[53:14] day they are christ's judgment standard
[53:18] on judgment day let's pull up galatians
[53:20] 1 if you could verses 6 and 7.
[53:23] let's just go over this here briefly
[53:25] because this kind of ties in this little
[53:26] story i want to tell just a small little
[53:28] story of a testimony
[53:34] i marvel that you are so soon removed
[53:36] from him that called you into the grace
[53:38] of christ
[53:39] unto another gospel and as you read
[53:40] later i preached this years ago it's the
[53:42] legalistic gospel they were moved back
[53:45] into legalism
[53:46] they had some liberty and grace but then
[53:49] because of circumcision they got moved
[53:51] back into legalistic
[53:53] gospel paul says which is not another
[53:55] but there will be some that trouble you
[53:57] and would pervert the gospel of christ
[54:00] so any addition to the word of god
[54:03] becomes a perverted gospel right
[54:05] it becomes something that's not real
[54:07] it's it doesn't have the same power
[54:10] praise god and so any addition to the
[54:14] word any addition
[54:16] makes it perverted now go to verses 8
[54:18] and 9.
[54:22] galatians 1 89 but though we or an angel
[54:25] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[54:27] you
[54:27] than that which we have preached unto
[54:29] you let him be
[54:31] accursed and no and and you know he says
[54:33] it again
[54:34] he doubles down on this he says if you
[54:36] add anything
[54:37] you're cursed now why would paul say
[54:40] such strong words
[54:43] why would he say you're cursed to add
[54:45] anything to the gospel
[54:47] well i think the answer is in verse 10.
[54:49] so uh in case you can put up 10
[54:51] we'll read 10 11 12 13.
[54:54] the reason paul would curse anybody
[54:56] because he said for now do i persuade
[54:58] men or god or do i seek to please men
[55:00] for if i yet please men i should not be
[55:02] the servant of christ
[55:04] verse 11 but i certify you brother that
[55:06] the gospel which was preached of me
[55:08] is not after man next verse for i
[55:11] neither received it of man neither was i
[55:13] taught it by man
[55:14] but by revelation of jesus christ
[55:18] go to verse 13 for ye have heard of my
[55:21] conversation in time past
[55:23] in the jews religion how that beyond
[55:25] measure i persecuted the church of god
[55:28] and wasted it i will stop right there
[55:31] so why would paul have such strong words
[55:33] he said because no man
[55:34] taught me this right i didn't learn it
[55:37] from myself
[55:39] jesus revealed it to me jesus
[55:42] unveiled this to me now look look at
[55:43] this god could have had peter
[55:46] teach paul right pretty good teacher how
[55:50] many would say amen to that pretty good
[55:51] teacher
[55:52] peter's a good teacher how about james
[55:54] yes wonderful teacher
[55:56] any of these men of god luke right any
[55:59] of these many of these mighty teachers
[56:02] could have taught paul but jesus said
[56:04] i'm not going to use any of them
[56:07] i'm not going to use an angel i'm not
[56:08] going to use anything i'm coming myself
[56:11] to deliver this message
[56:12] amen this is so so important i'm going
[56:14] to use paul in such a mighty way
[56:16] i'm not i'm not giving this uh uh this
[56:19] job to any man
[56:20] i'm gonna do it myself praise god amen
[56:24] it was
[56:24] such importance and that's why paul
[56:27] could say if you change
[56:28] what jesus showed me you're cursed
[56:33] remember proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 says
[56:36] don't let
[56:36] or let no man add to the word of god
[56:40] the bible says or god will call you a
[56:42] liar if you add to the word of god
[56:44] revelation 22 18 and 19 says if you add
[56:48] to the word of god the prophecy
[56:50] the plagues are attitude if you take
[56:52] away your name is taken off the book of
[56:54] life and how come people can't see that
[56:55] you can be saved and lose your salvation
[56:58] how can your name be on a book of life
[57:00] and then be taken off
[57:01] and you not lose your salvation
[57:05] people they just can't understand that
[57:06] they have such a
[57:08] baby gospel they have such a milky baby
[57:11] gospel that they can't even accept the
[57:13] plain words of christ
[57:15] right it shows that because they're not
[57:18] taught by christ they're taught by man
[57:20] and they can be persuaded by men jesus
[57:22] said in the in the church ages
[57:24] he says if you don't obey if you don't
[57:26] repent i'll blot your name out of the
[57:28] book of life
[57:29] so jesus christ gives that warning and
[57:32] then paul says though
[57:33] we are an angel so not even him not even
[57:37] his preachers
[57:38] no one can change a word that christ
[57:40] taught him
[57:43] now where did paul get this revelation
[57:45] galatians 1 17
[57:47] he received it likely in the wilderness
[57:49] of arabia
[57:51] god didn't send paul to a seminary
[57:53] although god used some of those
[57:54] sometimes right
[57:55] he doesn't use them anymore really
[58:00] he didn't send peter as we say he didn't
[58:02] send peter to teach him
[58:04] he had a special meeting praise god
[58:07] he had to meet paul face to face he said
[58:10] neither went out to jerusalem to them
[58:11] which were apostles before me
[58:13] but i went to arabia and returned again
[58:16] into damascus amen he had to have a
[58:19] special fellowship
[58:21] a special meeting with jesus now church
[58:24] i just trust each one of you will have
[58:27] that room meeting with jesus
[58:28] praise god not to write the bible but to
[58:31] accept the bible praise god
[58:33] each one of our children no matter our
[58:34] adults no matter how young or old
[58:36] each one of you have to have a meeting
[58:39] where you met the grace of god
[58:41] where you met jesus right where you
[58:43] experience the life-changing power of
[58:45] the gospel praise god
[58:47] if a man can talk you into it a man can
[58:49] talk you out of it but if you meet jesus
[58:51] face to face
[58:52] you know where it happened you know when
[58:54] it happened nobody can talk you out of
[58:56] it praise god
[58:57] amen
[59:01] paul says i can't change it angels can't
[59:03] change it
[59:04] this is jesus's gospel he gave it to me
[59:07] in the desert
[59:09] i like that can you imagine paul he's
[59:11] out there in the desert maybe he's in a
[59:13] cave
[59:13] maybe he's in a tent and that same light
[59:16] starts shining in the tent let's say
[59:18] it's an early morning
[59:19] like brother branham would meet the
[59:20] angel of the lord early in the morning
[59:22] he'd paul be praying or something pretty
[59:25] soon he'd see a bright light
[59:26] and he said oh that's a sun is really
[59:28] bright today it but it wasn't the
[59:30] it wasn't the s-u-n it was the s-o-n
[59:34] and he had the same feeling he had when
[59:36] he got knocked off the horse on the road
[59:38] to damascus praise god
[59:40] he said that's not a different light
[59:41] that's the same light amen
[59:44] and now that light is talking to him
[59:45] again and now he now he doesn't say who
[59:47] are you lord
[59:48] he said he said he said uh lord jesus
[59:51] uh i bless your holy name i thank you
[59:53] lord thank you for coming to meet with
[59:55] me i worship you jesus amen
[59:58] praise god it's not who are you lord
[59:59] it's o lord i love you
[1:00:01] i humble myself what would you have your
[1:00:03] servant to know praise god
[1:00:05] he met the same light that he met on
[1:00:08] damascus
[1:00:08] out there in the desert and he taught
[1:00:10] him the word of god
[1:00:12] what a privilege and now he's not
[1:00:15] persecuting that light
[1:00:17] now he's trying to save people by that
[1:00:19] light praise god
[1:00:20] now he's trying to point people to that
[1:00:23] light
[1:00:24] it's a great blessing what a great
[1:00:25] revelation he persecuted
[1:00:28] the light but now he's getting
[1:00:29] revelation from the light
[1:00:31] to shine the spiritual light of god
[1:00:34] amen just like moses met god in the
[1:00:37] wilderness praise god
[1:00:39] just like moses met god in the
[1:00:40] wilderness of mount sinai for 40 days
[1:00:43] praise god his face shone like an angel
[1:00:45] i wonder if
[1:00:46] paul's face shone like an angel he met
[1:00:49] jesus face to face
[1:00:50] and then brother bretta met the angels
[1:00:52] the seven angels out in the
[1:00:54] out of the desert praise god out in
[1:00:55] arizona god met uh brother branham there
[1:00:58] to give him the revelation of marriage
[1:00:59] and divorce praise god
[1:01:04] and so we see we have a modern example
[1:01:06] of god meaning a prophet
[1:01:08] in the wilderness so 1500 years before
[1:01:10] christ
[1:01:11] and then about 15 or so years after
[1:01:15] christ
[1:01:16] and then about 1900 years after that
[1:01:20] god is constantly meeting with prophets
[1:01:22] giving them
[1:01:23] the word of the lord amen
[1:01:26] hallelujah so this is a modern day
[1:01:29] example
[1:01:30] we see giving the standard now let me
[1:01:33] just tell this brief little
[1:01:34] testimony and i call it a testimony
[1:01:36] because my wife was able to witness for
[1:01:38] a while maybe was it maybe five or ten
[1:01:39] minutes you got to talk a little bit
[1:01:42] in person yeah so we every now and then
[1:01:46] we have friends over and
[1:01:47] and uh you know the the friend was a
[1:01:50] mother as well and was kind of confiding
[1:01:52] in my wife and
[1:01:53] and talking about one a situation where
[1:01:55] her
[1:01:56] one of her daughters can i say it maybe
[1:01:59] not
[1:02:00] okay just trouble with the daughters
[1:02:03] right uh with one of the daughters
[1:02:07] and a very serious issue i'll just sound
[1:02:09] like that very serious sin
[1:02:11] maybe that's the best i could do a very
[1:02:13] serious sin
[1:02:15] and uh and
[1:02:18] though the mother asked my wife her
[1:02:20] opinion you know my wife's opinion on it
[1:02:23] and my wife said well saint paul said
[1:02:25] this sin is
[1:02:26] so-and-so saint paul called it a sin
[1:02:30] and then the the mother said well that
[1:02:33] those are just paul's opinions
[1:02:36] she said that's what we've been taught
[1:02:37] and this person's been going to church
[1:02:39] their whole life and this is an obvious
[1:02:43] blatant
[1:02:43] i'll say it like this it's an abominable
[1:02:45] sin that kind of gives you more
[1:02:47] our older ones a little more
[1:02:48] understanding the kind of sin this is
[1:02:51] and uh and this this this daughter was
[1:02:55] telling her mother well
[1:02:56] well yeah the bible says that but that
[1:02:57] was just paul's opinion
[1:03:00] and the holy spirit must have anointed
[1:03:02] my wife and my wife said
[1:03:04] no those are not paul's opinions paul
[1:03:08] didn't get his thoughts from himself
[1:03:10] paul got
[1:03:11] his thoughts from jesus christ
[1:03:15] and they got talking and this this
[1:03:16] mother she's in her 50s right she's in
[1:03:19] or if not 50s late 40s i think 50s maybe
[1:03:22] mid 50s she said wow i never knew
[1:03:25] galatians 1 said that so i think later
[1:03:28] after they went home
[1:03:28] my wife sent the scriptures from
[1:03:30] galatians 1 the ones we just read
[1:03:32] now can you imagine that you're 50 years
[1:03:34] old and you never knew now we're raising
[1:03:37] it now he's raising it my children are
[1:03:38] raising it
[1:03:40] you're raised to know that paul had such
[1:03:43] authority that he said if you change one
[1:03:45] word of it you're cursed
[1:03:47] but this you know this sweet woman here
[1:03:49] this mother
[1:03:51] is 50 some years old and never knew it
[1:03:53] until god anoints my wife
[1:03:55] to share the scripture with her and now
[1:03:58] and now think of the understanding
[1:04:00] think about this what a difference it is
[1:04:03] to say oh this is just opinions
[1:04:05] to change from that to say no this is
[1:04:08] the absolute truth
[1:04:09] and you're responsible for it then my
[1:04:11] wife sent me a text and i said well yeah
[1:04:13] share this scripture from romans
[1:04:15] 2 where it said you'll the secrets of
[1:04:17] men's hearts
[1:04:18] will be judged by jesus christ according
[1:04:21] to paul's gospel amen
[1:04:23] now what now to me church this was such
[1:04:25] a eye-opening
[1:04:27] uh reminder about the condition of
[1:04:29] denominational churches
[1:04:31] i'm talking about outside of this
[1:04:32] message and most churches in general
[1:04:35] most churches have no idea that paul lay
[1:04:38] down a standard and if they if churches
[1:04:40] don't meet the standard
[1:04:41] they are cursed it's gonna be hard to
[1:04:44] make it to heaven when you're cursed
[1:04:46] right as we said you're either
[1:04:48] permanently cursed
[1:04:49] like cain or temporarily cursed right
[1:04:52] like saul
[1:04:53] king saul because he had those evil
[1:04:54] spirits on him right
[1:04:56] and it's it's obvious a lot of people
[1:04:58] going to churches denominational
[1:05:00] have evil spirits on them right they're
[1:05:03] anointed with some
[1:05:04] like depression or whatever it is you
[1:05:06] know pride whatever it is
[1:05:07] they're anointed with something that's
[1:05:09] that's not holy it's evil
[1:05:11] right and so it was just an eye-opening
[1:05:14] uh lesson and i just love how god
[1:05:17] anointed my wife she sits back there
[1:05:18] you know year after year we we talk
[1:05:21] about
[1:05:22] our desire it was so it's so beautiful
[1:05:24] we always talk about our desire to share
[1:05:25] the message with our friends and we
[1:05:28] never would have thought you know this
[1:05:29] would have been the moment i hit that
[1:05:30] thing last week
[1:05:33] you know we never would have thought
[1:05:34] this would have been the time but
[1:05:35] because this sin has raised up in that
[1:05:37] person's family a very serious
[1:05:39] abomination by the way
[1:05:42] it caused her to kind of bring it up
[1:05:44] this mother to bring it up to my wife
[1:05:45] and god had those scriptures right on my
[1:05:48] wife's mind
[1:05:49] to be able to witness and share right
[1:05:51] there and now the mother
[1:05:53] has a better realization this isn't an
[1:05:55] option this is required
[1:05:58] praise god and so now we'll see where
[1:06:00] the family
[1:06:01] i don't know where the family the
[1:06:02] direction they'll go whether they'll
[1:06:03] support the abomination or
[1:06:05] keep standing against it but also but i
[1:06:08] can say this
[1:06:09] uh that the door of faith has now opened
[1:06:12] that family and that at least that
[1:06:13] mother
[1:06:14] and she has to walk through that door of
[1:06:15] faith can i say it like that
[1:06:17] that the door is open wow this is a new
[1:06:19] understanding
[1:06:21] and church this is part of the
[1:06:23] revelation
[1:06:25] of the jew and gentile church as one
[1:06:28] church amen both jew and gentile
[1:06:31] have the same standard it's the word of
[1:06:33] god brought by paul
[1:06:35] praise god amen it's the same standard
[1:06:38] that's the standard for you malachi for
[1:06:39] your acacia
[1:06:41] it's the same standard for me we are all
[1:06:43] under the same standard
[1:06:44] we all must live the bible and keep its
[1:06:47] precepts
[1:06:48] and we'll be blessed amen but if we
[1:06:50] change it we'll be cursed
[1:06:51] or it'll preach a perverted gospel where
[1:06:54] the power of god doesn't move anymore
[1:06:56] but we've got to stay with the original
[1:06:58] word so the blessings can remain on
[1:07:00] us
[1:07:03] there's just an amazing reminder to me
[1:07:07] how blessed we are to have had a prophet
[1:07:09] come we really are
[1:07:12] because now like uh the believe the sign
[1:07:14] people if they're watching they haven't
[1:07:16] made a
[1:07:16] video about me yet so we'll see maybe
[1:07:18] it'll be this week and i'm just waiting
[1:07:20] for it to drop
[1:07:22] but that that's what they do um you know
[1:07:25] like hair like
[1:07:26] women's hair or men's hair they don't
[1:07:28] make it a command they make it that's
[1:07:29] just a custom
[1:07:31] now we know it's not a custom paul says
[1:07:34] all the churches he said we have no
[1:07:36] other practice this is the only practice
[1:07:38] we have
[1:07:39] and so that's just one example where
[1:07:41] they've made that teaching it's a
[1:07:43] doctrine right it's a bible command you
[1:07:45] can see it
[1:07:45] all through the scripture they've made
[1:07:47] that just a custom
[1:07:49] and they've made it of no effect
[1:07:52] right they make a net effect and now
[1:07:55] paul's gospel
[1:07:56] is changed right and now they
[1:07:59] and now they also preach they don't
[1:08:00] preach three works of grace anymore
[1:08:02] as soon as you say a sinner's prayer
[1:08:04] you're filled with the holy ghost
[1:08:06] with all the power of god and all all
[1:08:08] the holiness of god but their lives
[1:08:10] don't even testify to it
[1:08:12] right you don't see any fruits but jesus
[1:08:15] said if you abide in me
[1:08:17] and i in you you'll bear much fruit
[1:08:19] praise god
[1:08:22] amen
[1:08:24] see we can see the effects of a
[1:08:25] perverted gospel
[1:08:27] we can see the effects of it and then
[1:08:29] what do you do they mock brother branham
[1:08:31] they make fun of brother branham they
[1:08:33] they uh they just take his name through
[1:08:35] the mud
[1:08:36] a servant of god right
[1:08:39] just speak against him and uh say all
[1:08:42] kinds of evil things against a servant
[1:08:43] of god
[1:08:46] which their lives can't their lives
[1:08:47] can't even compare one one lick
[1:08:49] to brother branham's life all that he
[1:08:51] sacrificed all the miles he traveled
[1:08:53] all the sermons he preached all the
[1:08:54] people he prayed for laid hands on
[1:08:57] uh discernments in the prayer lines all
[1:09:00] the sacrifice
[1:09:01] their lives don't even come close to the
[1:09:03] sacrifice
[1:09:04] that brother random gave for the gospel
[1:09:07] it's because they're preaching in a
[1:09:08] different gospel
[1:09:10] now let's read romans 2 16. can you pull
[1:09:12] that up here
[1:09:15] and that just really brought a real
[1:09:17] reality these churches most churches
[1:09:19] have no idea about paul's gospel
[1:09:21] therefore how can they be the bride
[1:09:22] like you said with the last with the
[1:09:25] last revelation
[1:09:26] the mystery of the church is bright how
[1:09:27] can they breathe be the bride church
[1:09:29] when they don't keep the bridegroom's
[1:09:30] word
[1:09:32] it's impossible it can't be
[1:09:35] because they'll allow such abominable
[1:09:37] sins they'll allow in their family
[1:09:38] they'll allow the church
[1:09:41] how can they be the bride it's
[1:09:42] impossible because they're breaking the
[1:09:44] word of the bridegroom
[1:09:45] that he delivered through paul romans 2
[1:09:48] 16 this is the one i think i share with
[1:09:50] my wife
[1:09:51] in that day when god shall judge the
[1:09:53] secrets of men
[1:09:54] by jesus christ according to my gospel
[1:09:58] now church how in the world is god going
[1:10:00] to do that
[1:10:05] is he going to have people stand there
[1:10:07] and then
[1:10:08] god is going to have like a tv screen
[1:10:09] like we we picture our minds
[1:10:11] and god's going to play back all their
[1:10:13] secret thoughts that they thought about
[1:10:14] the word of god
[1:10:16] then what is god going to do have a have
[1:10:18] like a bible reader over here one of the
[1:10:19] angels reading the scripture that they
[1:10:21] broke
[1:10:21] let's go to women's hair uh
[1:10:25] that's just old-fashioned what does hair
[1:10:27] have anything to do with it those
[1:10:28] preachers have lost their mind
[1:10:30] their you know it'll play their thoughts
[1:10:33] and then the angel will read the
[1:10:35] scripture
[1:10:37] where we have no other practice no no
[1:10:39] nor do the churches of god
[1:10:41] and they'll be judged by that right
[1:10:45] the secrets will be judged things they
[1:10:47] wouldn't say out loud
[1:10:49] will be judged on that day
[1:10:52] may god help us to say the right thing
[1:10:53] may god help us to confess all of our
[1:10:55] secrets because we all got them right
[1:10:57] we all got secrets but we got to confess
[1:11:00] them under the blood
[1:11:01] and we can't meditate upon them that's
[1:11:02] why that memory verse was so beautiful
[1:11:04] the meditation let let me meditate on
[1:11:07] the word
[1:11:09] right that's what that's what god told
[1:11:10] joshua think about the word meditate on
[1:11:12] it day and night
[1:11:13] then you'll be a success we just have to
[1:11:15] make sure we don't meditate on the wrong
[1:11:17] things
[1:11:18] we don't we can't meditate on the evil
[1:11:20] secrets of our heart we must confess the
[1:11:22] secrets of our heart
[1:11:23] and learn to meditate on only the word
[1:11:25] of god
[1:11:27] because that day church you and i are
[1:11:28] gonna stand there right because we're
[1:11:30] gonna do it right after the rapture
[1:11:31] it's under the blood of jesus right all
[1:11:34] of our secrets all of our
[1:11:35] any of our evil words or thoughts or
[1:11:36] deeds we have to make sure it's all
[1:11:38] under the blood
[1:11:40] because if not the white the white
[1:11:41] throne judgment they'll stand there
[1:11:43] and they'll have to answer for every
[1:11:44] secret thing they said about you
[1:11:48] or us right in this hour the word of god
[1:11:51] though all their secrets will be judged
[1:11:54] all the times they mocked it mocked you
[1:11:56] made fun of you spoke evil of you called
[1:11:59] you a
[1:12:00] loser old-fashioned whatever they called
[1:12:03] you
[1:12:04] every evil secret they thought will be
[1:12:06] judged according this
[1:12:07] word praise god that's why i'm so
[1:12:11] thankful
[1:12:11] everything we believe we got a scripture
[1:12:13] for praise god
[1:12:15] right if not then we just say well it's
[1:12:17] a liberty or something like that
[1:12:19] right or a custom you can have some
[1:12:21] traditions as long as they're liberties
[1:12:23] but everything we believe we can find it
[1:12:26] on here because this is what's going to
[1:12:28] be our judgment standard praise god
[1:12:32] the secrets of men's hearts will be no
[1:12:36] made known by the gospel of jesus christ
[1:12:42] how important it is to know what paul
[1:12:44] preached that's why i'm going to
[1:12:45] continue on that lord willing the next
[1:12:46] one i'm going to get to is colossians
[1:12:47] right
[1:12:48] galatians ephesians philippians i preach
[1:12:49] those next one's colossians i got to
[1:12:51] preach all paul's gospels
[1:12:53] until the lord comes because paul we are
[1:12:56] judged by that
[1:12:57] right we don't have any option we got to
[1:12:59] know what paul said
[1:13:01] and we have to do what paul said because
[1:13:02] that's our judgment standard
[1:13:04] and the church said praise god see it's
[1:13:06] not preached enough
[1:13:07] right paul's paul's letters aren't
[1:13:09] preached enough
[1:13:11] they need to be preached more praise god
[1:13:14] like when i like just preaching through
[1:13:15] you know how many blessings did we get
[1:13:17] out of you know galatians ephesians
[1:13:19] and philippians the book of joy i mean
[1:13:21] how many how many how many wonderful
[1:13:22] blessings came out of that series
[1:13:25] i was just on cloud nine and there are
[1:13:27] no sermons praise god
[1:13:28] there's just a fresh thing here tying in
[1:13:30] here and all the blessings that's when
[1:13:32] we have the faith for the prayer cloth
[1:13:34] right that's what philippians remind us
[1:13:35] where did philippians start
[1:13:37] there at the philippians they're at
[1:13:39] philippi when
[1:13:40] when paul got the the clause laid on him
[1:13:42] and that's what caused us to pray for
[1:13:43] vang's dad and who is that that way
[1:13:45] that's the sermon that moved it was the
[1:13:47] the philippians series praise god oh my
[1:13:51] that's what moved it was that's where it
[1:13:53] started in acts 19. that's the city of
[1:13:55] philippi
[1:13:57] and so see uh like brother man said we
[1:13:59] go from glory to glory
[1:14:00] from bible experience to bible
[1:14:02] experience amen
[1:14:05] hallelujah praise god i'm almost at an
[1:14:07] hour there i got about
[1:14:09] 15 more minutes here i'm going to try to
[1:14:10] finish up
[1:14:12] now paul's now when he says my gospel
[1:14:15] he's not saying like
[1:14:16] they came from his thoughts right but
[1:14:19] they come from his dispensation
[1:14:22] or his stewardship that came from jesus
[1:14:24] christ
[1:14:26] not every word paul wrote or
[1:14:29] uttered from his lips was from jesus
[1:14:31] right
[1:14:34] uh go to uh go to first corinthians
[1:14:36] seven i'll just show you an example real
[1:14:37] quick
[1:14:38] not every word paul said was thus saith
[1:14:40] the lord
[1:14:43] and that's what i can't understand about
[1:14:44] brother branham's worshipers and joseph
[1:14:47] branham's worshippers i can't understand
[1:14:48] how they say they keep saying it they
[1:14:50] just said it last week every word he
[1:14:52] said was thus saith the lord i have a
[1:14:53] quote
[1:14:54] brother brahm said he said this is not
[1:14:56] thus saith the lord this is william
[1:14:57] branham now how in the world
[1:14:59] is that not thus saith the lord when he
[1:15:02] says this
[1:15:03] is not thus saith the lord how is that
[1:15:05] thus saith the lord
[1:15:08] he just said it isn't but yet they'll
[1:15:11] still
[1:15:13] just fight through it and they'll still
[1:15:15] pervert the gospel of jesus is what
[1:15:16] they'll do they're doing
[1:15:18] they're perverting the gospel because
[1:15:20] it's not scriptural that every word a
[1:15:22] man says is thus saith the lord outside
[1:15:24] of christ
[1:15:26] first corinthians 7.
[1:15:30] now look at verse 25 now concerning
[1:15:33] virgins i have no commandment of the
[1:15:35] lord
[1:15:36] look at this so even paul couldn't say
[1:15:39] every word i say and write is thus saith
[1:15:41] the lord even paul couldn't say that
[1:15:43] now most of it was that was written but
[1:15:44] not all of it
[1:15:47] yet i give my judgment as one that hath
[1:15:49] obtained mercy
[1:15:51] of the lord to be faithful he said i
[1:15:54] don't have a commandment for this one
[1:15:55] this is just my judgment now early in
[1:15:57] the chapter there's another i just
[1:15:58] flipped to that one i saw it right away
[1:16:00] because i got it highlighted there
[1:16:01] in my bible yeah here it is verse 10 go
[1:16:04] to verse 10.
[1:16:08] and unto the married i command yet not i
[1:16:11] but the lord
[1:16:13] let not the white depart from her
[1:16:14] husband but it but and if she depart let
[1:16:16] her remain unmarried or be reconciled to
[1:16:18] her husband and let not the husband put
[1:16:20] away his wife
[1:16:21] to the rest speak i not the lord
[1:16:26] not the lord so see how especially you
[1:16:29] young people
[1:16:30] see how you got to be very careful how
[1:16:31] you rightly divide the word of god
[1:16:34] paul says you're judged by my gospel but
[1:16:35] then he said there's a few thoughts in
[1:16:37] there that are just my thoughts
[1:16:40] you guys understand so you have to be
[1:16:43] very careful now most of it is god's
[1:16:45] thoughts
[1:16:46] and the the best part of it is paul will
[1:16:48] say this is not i
[1:16:50] i'm sorry this is not the lord this is
[1:16:51] me like those examples right there
[1:16:57] so when when the random worshipers make
[1:17:00] every word
[1:17:00] thus saith the lord they're actually
[1:17:02] making brother branham equal to jesus
[1:17:04] christ
[1:17:05] higher than paul right
[1:17:08] remember brother and said in his day men
[1:17:10] tried to trick him
[1:17:12] to make him write or make his words
[1:17:15] another part of the bible and brother
[1:17:17] graham said he said
[1:17:18] no you can't do that because you can't
[1:17:20] add one word to it
[1:17:22] or take one word away hallelujah that's
[1:17:25] a real prophet right there amen not
[1:17:26] joseph smith who has a
[1:17:27] whole new testament to the the bible he
[1:17:30] says he says another testament of jesus
[1:17:32] christ
[1:17:32] there is no other testament this is the
[1:17:34] only testament of jesus christ
[1:17:36] the king james version of the bible
[1:17:38] praise god
[1:17:43] you know why paul did that you know why
[1:17:44] paul said this because he knew men would
[1:17:46] worship him
[1:17:47] go to first corinthians 2 1 verse 12.
[1:17:50] first corinthians 1 12. paul's like i'm
[1:17:53] glad
[1:17:54] i didn't baptize you because you would
[1:17:56] have said i baptize you in my own name
[1:17:59] that's how much they worship paul that's
[1:18:01] evil
[1:18:02] right it's evil look at this now this i
[1:18:04] say
[1:18:05] that every one of you saith i'm a palm
[1:18:06] of apollos i'm a cephas i have christ
[1:18:08] next one
[1:18:11] is christ divided was paul crucified for
[1:18:13] you or were you baptized in the name of
[1:18:14] paul verse 14
[1:18:15] i thank god that i baptized none of you
[1:18:18] but christmas and gaius verse 15
[1:18:21] lest and he should say that i baptized
[1:18:23] in my own name
[1:18:24] wow around the message of the hour
[1:18:27] people
[1:18:28] would get their eyes off the message and
[1:18:30] get eyes too much
[1:18:32] on the messenger it's the same now right
[1:18:34] same problem now
[1:18:36] they get their eyes on a man instead of
[1:18:39] on
[1:18:39] jesus christ same thing today
[1:18:43] right it's the spirit of our look how
[1:18:45] close the spirit of idolatry
[1:18:48] hovers around this message
[1:18:51] right and and if you listen to those
[1:18:53] jeffersonville people
[1:18:54] they're so sincere they sound so happy
[1:18:57] so sincere
[1:18:58] but when they say every word is thus
[1:19:00] saith the lord they've got the wrong
[1:19:02] spirit
[1:19:02] they've just exalted a man equal to
[1:19:04] jesus christ
[1:19:06] no man's equal to jesus christ he's the
[1:19:09] man
[1:19:09] of he's the man of among all men right
[1:19:12] he's the he's the
[1:19:12] he's the highest of the highest praise
[1:19:15] god he's the
[1:19:16] he's he's the all-in-all praise god he's
[1:19:18] the he's the holy one of israel he's the
[1:19:20] high lifted up one
[1:19:22] he's the only one that deserves our
[1:19:24] praise and our worship praise god
[1:19:26] but they are exalting just like they did
[1:19:28] paul they're exalting brother branham
[1:19:30] today and they're making him higher than
[1:19:31] paul
[1:19:33] like you've heard him say this that they
[1:19:35] said if you had a message book and a
[1:19:37] bible
[1:19:37] i've heard his his followers say this
[1:19:39] the brandon followers or the joseph
[1:19:40] branophobes they say if you had a
[1:19:42] message book and a bible which one would
[1:19:43] you take they said i take the message
[1:19:45] book
[1:19:45] because it has the fresh revelation of
[1:19:47] the bible i'd say no i take all of god's
[1:19:50] word and then if i love god god will
[1:19:52] reveal to me
[1:19:53] the revelation that's in that message
[1:19:54] book
[1:19:57] see the the the best part is god ain't
[1:19:59] going to make you choose
[1:20:00] right that's why he sent them the
[1:20:02] prophet to us that's why he had printing
[1:20:04] machines and computers right in his mind
[1:20:07] hallelujah see same thing did they do
[1:20:11] today they still baptize them brother
[1:20:12] bram's name they worship brother branham
[1:20:15] they say every word brother ram said
[1:20:16] what same thing they did to paul
[1:20:18] because he was such a man a mighty man
[1:20:20] of god
[1:20:24] see only paul's commandments from jesus
[1:20:27] christ
[1:20:27] carried authority now remember paul said
[1:20:31] in romans 3 can you put up romans 3
[1:20:33] 4 real quick
[1:20:40] romans 3 4. now who wrote romans say it
[1:20:44] out loud who wrote romans
[1:20:46] paul god forbid yay let god be true but
[1:20:49] some did he say some
[1:20:52] every so that includes who paul
[1:20:58] not every word paul said was thus saith
[1:20:59] the lord every man's a liar didn't
[1:21:01] brother
[1:21:01] i lied to the irs then how is that thus
[1:21:04] saith the lord
[1:21:05] to lie to the irs it's not
[1:21:08] as is written that thou mightest be
[1:21:10] justified in thy sayings
[1:21:11] and might just overcome when thou art
[1:21:14] judged
[1:21:15] uh would you go to verse 13
[1:21:20] 313. their throat is open sepulchre with
[1:21:23] their tongues they have used a seat the
[1:21:25] poison of ass was under the lips verse
[1:21:26] 14
[1:21:28] whose mouth is full of cursing and
[1:21:30] bitterness so all men
[1:21:32] every man says evil things right from
[1:21:34] time to time paul puts himself in there
[1:21:36] he's the one that wrote it paul was
[1:21:38] never saying every word i say is thus
[1:21:40] saith the lord
[1:21:41] he said only the commandments from jesus
[1:21:44] are thus saith the lord
[1:21:45] and so much thus saith the lord that
[1:21:47] you'll be judged by them on the day of
[1:21:48] judgment amen
[1:21:52] what a statement that the secrets of
[1:21:55] men's hearts will be judged by my gospel
[1:21:58] in that day by jesus christ
[1:22:04] these are not just common words right
[1:22:07] the commandments
[1:22:08] are the word of the lord
[1:22:11] ah remember in romans 7 paul said i did
[1:22:15] things that i hated
[1:22:16] the thing that i i hated that what i did
[1:22:20] he said oh wretched man that i am but
[1:22:22] thanks be to god
[1:22:23] who gives us the victory through our
[1:22:25] lord jesus christ
[1:22:28] let me close here paul was not
[1:22:31] infallible
[1:22:32] but his revealed gospel from jesus
[1:22:34] christ
[1:22:35] was infallible that's the difference
[1:22:39] paul's revelation from jesus is god's
[1:22:41] divine will for mankind
[1:22:43] and think about that all people will be
[1:22:46] judged by paul's letters
[1:22:49] every single person on this earth will
[1:22:51] be judged by romans
[1:22:55] corinthians second corinthians right
[1:22:58] galatians ephesians philippians
[1:23:00] colossians
[1:23:01] first thessalonians second thessalonians
[1:23:03] first timothy second timothy
[1:23:04] all men will be judged by those epistles
[1:23:10] you cannot overemphasize the importance
[1:23:12] of paul's letters
[1:23:14] they are god's divine will for us
[1:23:19] so water baptism paul taught water
[1:23:20] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[1:23:23] right in the literal name of the lord
[1:23:25] jesus christ that's of course an acts
[1:23:28] but paul said whatever you do in word or
[1:23:30] deed in colossians do it all
[1:23:32] in the name of jesus christ the godhead
[1:23:34] paul said never said was three persons
[1:23:36] he said jesus is the image of the one
[1:23:39] person
[1:23:41] paul taught all the church's appropriate
[1:23:42] hair length right
[1:23:44] paul taught modest clothing how many
[1:23:46] people are going to answer for that one
[1:23:48] almost the whole world women preachers
[1:23:52] paul forbid women preachers how many
[1:23:53] churches are going to answer for that
[1:23:54] one
[1:23:59] the false doctrine of inviting jesus
[1:24:01] into your heart
[1:24:02] that's a lie right you're inviting jesus
[1:24:05] in your heart and then you're born again
[1:24:07] no you repent and then the holy spirit
[1:24:09] comes upon you praise god
[1:24:11] right you repent of your sins it's not
[1:24:14] just oh jesus i love you i believe in
[1:24:16] you come into my heart
[1:24:17] he won't come in you got to repent first
[1:24:19] you got to be justified sanctified
[1:24:21] then he comes in praise god then he
[1:24:24] comes in the soul
[1:24:27] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:24:30] given to paul
[1:24:31] the word of god that we've received how
[1:24:34] many glad to have heard it by god's
[1:24:35] grace
[1:24:36] let's stand to our feet i'm gonna stop
[1:24:37] there by god's grace
[1:24:40] so thankful growing up i never heard
[1:24:42] these things i had no idea all
[1:24:44] i knew was john 3 16 that's about all i
[1:24:46] knew musicians can come
[1:24:48] now i thank god for john 3 16.
[1:24:51] but as i became a man i was 19 when i
[1:24:53] got saved i started going like i said i
[1:24:55] went to a baptist church for a while i
[1:24:56] went to that
[1:24:57] uh the chapel for a while which is
[1:24:59] basically presbyterian
[1:25:01] uh i went back to my pentecostal church
[1:25:03] for uh
[1:25:04] for a few services to try i went to the
[1:25:06] membership classes to understand their
[1:25:08] doctrine
[1:25:09] and i just i just saw all these
[1:25:10] differences and i just hungered for
[1:25:12] something i just hungered
[1:25:13] somebody tell me the truth just give me
[1:25:16] the truth and i'll believe it
[1:25:17] and finally simon said jesse you've got
[1:25:18] to listen to this sermon
[1:25:20] you got to do it tonight on thanksgiving
[1:25:22] night 2001.
[1:25:25] i still got the picture that night what

[1:28:50] how many want to overcome and how many
[1:28:51] want to prevail with the gospel
[1:28:54] in other words i don't want to fail the
[1:28:56] grace of god
[1:28:57] the bible says you can fail the grace of
[1:28:59] god we don't want to fail the grace of
[1:29:00] god
[1:29:02] we want to meet the requirements of
[1:29:03] god's grace and like the bible said oh

[1:29:09] an expected end
[1:29:11] praise god in other words i want to know

[1:29:23] surprised praise god
[1:29:24] i don't want any surprises after i die
[1:29:26] well you weren't clean and you were
[1:29:28] no i wouldn't expect it to end i want to
[1:29:30] know exactly what's going to happen
[1:29:32] when i cross over the angels of god will
[1:29:34] carry me up
[1:29:35] not devils take me down but the angels
[1:29:38] of god will carry me up
[1:29:39] into the presence of god amen
[1:29:43] i want an expected end so god gave me a
[1:29:45] rubric to make sure i get there
[1:29:48] and all i gotta do is keep preaching
[1:29:50] paul keep keep reading paul
[1:29:52] praise god keep teaching paul because
[1:29:55] this is how you live
[1:29:56] this is how you please god this is how
[1:29:58] you have an expected
[1:29:59] end
[1:30:02] the secrets of men's hearts will be
[1:30:05] judged on that day
[1:30:06] by jesus christ according to my gospel
[1:30:11] so thankful church that at 21 years old
[1:30:14] i got to hear
[1:30:15] that there's only one gospel and you'll
[1:30:17] be judged by it i was 21.
[1:30:19] this woman just a few weeks ago she's
[1:30:21] probably 55.
[1:30:23] she didn't hear that until she was 55
[1:30:25] years old think about the regrets
[1:30:27] this mother now has now of course god
[1:30:29] can forgive him
[1:30:31] but think about the regrets this woman
[1:30:33] has 55 years
[1:30:35] i never knew i was going to be judged by
[1:30:36] this but church we have the privilege of
[1:30:39] knowing it right now
[1:30:40] that ought to make us thankful that
[1:30:43] ought to make us
[1:30:43] feel blessed by god's grace and it will
[1:30:47] cause us to live more obedient to god's
[1:30:51] standards
[1:30:52] how many want to live more obedient to
[1:30:53] the standards of god how many want to
[1:30:55] meet the requirements and get an a plus
