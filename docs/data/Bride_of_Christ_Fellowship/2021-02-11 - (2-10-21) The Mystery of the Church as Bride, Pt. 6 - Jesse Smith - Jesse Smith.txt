only one that's going to bring us over to that side right so thank the lord for god's amazing grace we're going to ephesians 5 tonight by the grace of the lord ephesians 5 32 and we'll read our memory verse ephesians 5 32 let's read that together ephesians 5 32 1 2 3. this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church james 5 please james 5 7 and 8. a beautiful scripture here about the rapture the harvest and the former ladder rain ephesians i'm sorry james five seven eight let's read that on three one two three be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husband that waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord let's have one more word of prayer here let's ask the lord to give us patience and to receive as wheat plants to receive all the water to lay in the prince of the sun to come to maturity to unite with christ the word we see the world uniting being bound together in the tares but we want to unite to jesus christ so let's pray for that tonight heavenly father we gather in your mighty name lord god hear over the livestream god we just pray lord you'll do what you always do lord only you can do it come and preach lord god come and speak your word that by faith lord we can receive your promises lord god let it fall on good ground our duty lord is to make sure the ground is good a good honest and sincere heart lord god we're sincere tonight we love you lord god we're not wasting this moment lord god we're we're focused on this moment dear god and may good seed fall upon good ground here tonight father minister our church and anyone live streaming doesn't have a home church if they don't have a home church i pray you direct them to a home church lord they can have a pastor and a church family lord god and gather more as they see that day approaching lord god so i pray in jesus christ's name give us a portion of thy holy spirit lord a supply of the spirit as paul said dear god that we need to hear tonight father minister to us i pray in jesus christ's name saint said amen amen god bless you as you're being seated so tonight by god's grace we're looking at part six of the church the mystery of the church as the bride even this week i've got a few emails kind of criticizing this uh title of the sermon it's kind of hard to believe but it's a revelation they said they said the church is the mother not the bride and i said no i said the mother is new jerusalem we're not jesus's mother or jesus bride so no doubt and that just goes to show the reason there's confusion is because it's a mystery right and so the true saints have the revelation of the mystery if jesus christ calls himself the bridegroom and john the baptist calls himself a friend of the bridegroom then who's his bride is the church praise god we can see that clearly in the scripture so last wednesday night you know we left off with looking at different names of denominations and we actually showed how none of them could be the bride because they all disagree with 15 of paul's teachings and paul said the bride would obey christ in everything and paul said in romans 2 he said that the secrets of men's hearts will be uh judged by my gospel so let's read that again tonight we'll start with that one uh lydia malachi in case you can get your bibles here and have you read for us uh let me go to romans 2 16. i believe it's romans 2 16. maokai while we're there uh maokai can you go to ii chronicles 16 9 aca john 4 24. i just want to lay down a few scriptures here these are so critical to understanding the revelation of the mystery so may the holy spirit write these on the fleshly tables of our hearts by the holy spirit so this first scripture is where paul says all men secrets will be judged by his gospel think about that every secret a person would have whether they lied or lusted or stole or destroyed someone's character any secret they would have is going to be judged according to paul's gospel the bible says liars and adulterers and whoremongers thieves will not inherit the kingdom of god they'll all be judged by paul's gospel so lydia go ahead romans i believe it's 2 16 in the day when when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel amen so paul makes it very plain there's going to be a day think of that there's going to be a day when every secret is going to be judged by paul's gospel and we know if we read galatians 1 it's not paul's as far as his own thoughts it was his dispensation right it was his stewardship that's what the word dispensation means the stewardship he was to take the gospel to the gentiles thank you lydia so every church then all those churches that claim to be christ churches we'll go over it again here uh roman catholic protestant uh eastern orthodox anglican oriental orthodox and all the other ones baptist methodists seven day advance adventists mormons jehovah's witnesses pentecostals none of them can be the bride because they all break some of paul's commands or they disregard them or do away with them or add to them so the bride won't do that she won't add or take away she'll keep every command of her lord her husband jesus christ now i just want to look at a few scriptures here that tell you um any person who's in one of those organizations we name that really is hungry and thirsty for righteousness god is god will search for them and then draw them out of denominations because the bible said come out of her my people the mother harlot come out of the mother harlot roman catholic church and we know she has daughters according to revelation chapter 2. so these scriptures show god is searching the earth to find any member who really wants to be the bride of jesus christ married to christ in everything so malcolm go ahead second chronicles 16 verse 9 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect for him amen so no one on the face of the earth has to wonder can god see me can god reach me his eyes go all around the world praise god this world's a small thing compared to an almighty infinite all-knowing omnipotent omniscient eternal god so thank god he's with us praise god he's with us he's with uh africa he's worth he's with europe and antarctica even the arctic he's everywhere thank god he's with us praise god acacia john 4 24 and 20 sorry 23 and 24 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeking such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship and must worship him in him and spirit and truth wonderful so we see again god is seeking true worshipers how's he doing that the eyes of the lord are going around the earth we can say that's the holy spirit the church book brother branham said that's god's messengers his eyes uh go around the the earth preachers right angelus go around the world when god sends a pastor they're the lord the fire of the lord so there god is seeking true worshipers now i have another one acts 10 verse 35. that's what it was 34-35 then peter opened his mouth and said of the truth i perceive god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him so see every nation right every nation jesus said take the gospel and preach it to every nation for a witness and then the end shall come see god is constantly searching the earth he's seeking he's moving and he's constantly striving with man as we looked at last week he's striving he's pleading with them uh to accept all of his word and the bible says any man that fears god and does righteous works god will accept him any nation so thank god for that no matter where you live uh as long as you're fearing god and doing the right things god will accept you praise god what a great testimony for justification isn't that that shows the person's justified when they respect god they've no doubt repented they're trying to do the right thing god accepts them there his amen now i take a few paragraphs and look at who is the bride and where she's located we kind of went through who she is she's the one that keeps all the word of god uh she's in the all other categories right in the uh pew research centers uh counting of church members but scripture is clear that uh where is she she's all around the world jesus says some will be sleeping when the rapture takes place oh what a great night that would be right to go to bed and wake up and it's not a dream but you're in the presence of jesus christ brother amen has had dreams about jesus and different ones have had dreams about jesus but if it's the rapture that won't be a dream it won't end the bible says then we'll forever be with the lord praise god some will be working in a field some will be grinding at the mill some of our uh brothers and sisters that still grind their uh grind their meal by god's grace so see she's all around the world so it may be night and maybe morning but she's not located in one location physically she's spiritually located in christ by the baptism of the holy spirit she doesn't have one church name like jehovah's witnesses or mormons or catholics they're not all wise virgin churches or holy ghost filled churches or bible-believing churches she has no official name but she does have a spiritual name that's mrs lord jesus christ and the bible says the whole family of god has this name in ephesians chapter 3 verses 14 and 15. now remember she's made of both jew and gentile because the bride has to be made out of every nation under heaven so a few jews will by god's grace not have the spiritual blinders on and they'll be able to have eyes that can see their messiah although ancestors missed it 2 000 years ago they'll be able to see it and they'll be part of the bokeh bride from every nation this church the bride is organized by the holy spirit through her heavenly headquarters there's no physical headquarters uh according to paul's apostolic pattern the fightful ministry all has gifts from jesus from heaven they all when he ascended the gifts descended right through the holy spirit so that's how jesus keeps everyone in the world who's in the bride in one accord not by a man on earth but by the god-man in heaven no earthly headquarters there's no man-made control over the bride of jesus christ like brother graham said she's an independent woman she's independent from satan she's independent from man-made creeds she's fully dependent upon jesus christ amen now let's look at tonight we'll start looking at some of the eight old testament women who foreshadowed the rapture of the bride of jesus christ the jew gentile church now we went over one when we preached part one on a sunday night and you probably remember we looked at esther right we looked at esther so we probably won't get to that one tonight we probably skipped through most of it anyway just maybe rehearse a few things about that now there of course could be more than eight no doubt there's probably more than eight but these are the eight as i studied and prayed and waited on the lord for the few weeks that i wrote this chapter uh these are the eight that kind of came to my mind and my thinking and the bible said the holy ghost will bring all things to remembrance so all that god ordained to bring to my memory i believe came to my memory now i just want to read this as a great reminder here look at the uh the amazing prophecy here that we see so lydia amos 9 verses 11 and 12. maokai acts 15 verse 14. look at the amazing uh rich truth that god hides in prophecy like we already looked at a few months ago with galatians 3 where paul says paul's quoting genesis 12 and says that in abraham's seed all nations will be blessed showing that gentiles can have faith and be justified by faith in jesus christ but if you just read genesis 12 you wouldn't see that you would just say all families of the earth will be blessed through abraham so in other words god hides deep rich spiritual truths treasures in these old testament scriptures and i love it god's the only one who can interpret his word just like with brother ramsey thus saith the lord prophecies god is the only one who can interpret that we have men today that think they can interpret well they can't unless they're anointed by the holy spirit they'll get it wrong every time and i say that with love because i prayed for those people with tears to repent but god is the only one who can interpret those thus saith the lord's so now let's look here before we start let's remember what beautiful truth god hides in the depths of the riches of his prophecies so lydia amos 9 11 and 12. in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that has fallen and close up the breaches thereof and i will raise up his ruins and i will build it as in the days of old that they may possess the remnant of edom and of all the heathen which are called by my name saith the lord that does this amen so the scripture is talking about israel right then it talks about those of edom which is gentile just listening to that or just reading that would would you think that scripture would mean god is gonna put put a pause on israel for two thousand years to pull out a gentile bride no no it doesn't say it doesn't say anything close to that but god hid deep treasures in there god there was glorious truth in there that god was gonna blind the jews because they rejected him and pull out a gentile bride so malachi's got this scripture in acts 15 verse 14 saint james is the one who recognizes this scripture i believe if i'm not mistaken it could be barnabas this is james okay yeah sorry about that james is the one who recognizes that god was going to god prophesied and foretold he was going to open up a door of faith to the gentiles so now can i read that for us bless you sirian hath declared how god at the first to visit the gentiles to take out of them as people for his name amen very simple that's why uh the bride is known as mrs lord jesus christ the whole family in heaven earth is named the lord jesus christ proving that's the name of god the lord jesus christ jesus is jehovah our salvation praise god so i just want to lay that in there again so you can see that that this was four told 2 000 years i remember we went through the scriptures already about um i think a couple sermons ago about there was days that god was gonna keep israel silent and then after after two days uh after two thousand years god would return to israel right i think we looked at that uh in part two if i'm not mistaken or part one the scripture i believe was hosea i believe it was hosea where the bible says that so if you put amos and hosea together and all these scriptures together you see god is going to blind israel for two thousand years pull out and rescue a gentile bride now here's the eight sarah rebecca azinath rahab samson's bride from timnath that's five ruth esther solomon's wife the shulamite and that's eight by god's grace no doubt there's more that's the ones and we've already looked at esther a little bit so tonight we'll just go right through order we'll just start with sarah here and we'll look at her we'll have a few scriptures to read in just a moment but generally we know the story of sarah we know a lot about her she's the wife of abraham and she bore isaac at 90 years old and it's such a beautiful example i was thinking about that today how in genesis 18 sarah is laughing saying shall i have pleasure with my lord right how am i going to never have a child i we don't even have any we don't we're not even in a family relationship anymore it's impossible and then a few chapters later in chapter uh 20 king abimelech wants to marry her because she's so beautiful so it proves there's a mystery laying in there that just you know chapters before she was an old woman and slowly but surely she started changing and life started coming back to her so much that it came on to mary a beautiful woman named sarah oh it's so awesome how god hides his revelation in the scripture beautiful and so sarah types uh the old jew gentile church she types the uh the church that it's it would seem impossible that she could bring forth life right it seems impossible this woman this old woman this 2000 year old church right impossible how could this church at this old state have a body change impossible but with god all things will be possible praise god nothing shall be impossible with the lord is anything too hard for the lord the lord told abraham so isaac birth then foretells jesus's second coming to earth because both are promised sons that come on the scene right and isaac's birth happened about the same time like right after sodom's destruction so we see the destruction of the homosexual community and the coming of the promised son uh the an impossible emerging of a promised son all linked together right and this fits jesus describing the end time in luke 17 verses 28 through 30. he said it would occur at a time when the world was again in sodomite conditions right as it was in the days of lot here we are at the end time again so we see those two events closely associated together right the destruction of sodom the mob rule like they they're a bunch of the mob mentality on twitter trying to shut people down and on facebook trying to shut people down let them do it mercy god will make a way god god's word will get where it needs to go by his grace no one can stop the power of our god no one can stop eternal prophecy foretold before the foundation of the world written in heaven and then written by man upon the earth no one can stop the mind of god his plan cannot be stopped praise god all right so we see sarah as this type of a woman now let's get the scripture um acacia romans 4 19 just a beautiful scripture here and then lydia can you get uh first corinthians 15 51 and 52. so i want to i want casio to read this scripture it's so suitable which tells us why sarah was laughing so romans 4 19 whenever you're ready and being that weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's world thank you i just gotta write this down here all right so we see the scripture the deadness of her womb she realized she knew that's why she laughed at god and god said no you did laugh don't lie she knew her womb was dead impossible that's why hagar you know take hagar so sarah's womb was dead impossible to conceive right so god had to change her body so much so that she could travel down to career i forget how many miles that was now i think it was i think it was 90. i could be wrong on that but it was quite a trip on camel for a 90 or 89 or 85 year old woman and she must have been a he must have got some new looks right must have got some new vitality and new health through the power of the holy spirit and her so her womb was dead she needed a body change that's exactly what the scripture calls the rapture lydia first corinthians 15 51-52 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound then the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed amen the promise is we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye it looks like sarah's change was slow and steady doesn't it looks like it's just slow uh maybe she traveled after the the visitation of the holy spirit uh left with the two messengers went down beside him just seemed like it was a slow change but the bible said our change will be instant this death will be swallowed up in life praise god now we're thankful that in our soul we've already had a change right from death unto life the bible said we're quickened or made alive by the holy spirit in our souls praise god we've already had a portion of life come into us hallelujah the new birth amen jesus said my words are spirit and they are life the word of god brings life to the soul so see our bodies must be changed to be christ in the air just like sarah's body had to be changed to bring forth the promised son with god or things are possible sarah doubted god's promise but god kept his word we're so thankful that god is the one who keeps the word i just had an interesting thought tonight maybe i thought this before and forgot it i must have forgot it but let's go to genesis 18 here let's look at this visit again i just want to look at this thought again here and they're looking for the wrong word here genesis three angels come down god is one of them and then there's two other just regular angels they come and visit and uh we know that god discerns sarah's heart she's uh behind the tent right not in the room and uh god says in verse 10 he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard in the in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken with age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within herself saying am i waxed old sorry after i'm waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also and the lord said to abram wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety very child which am old now this is such a beautiful portion of scripture for us who follow the message of william branham because in this scripture we can see that the bride sarah represents the brighter church of the new testament god is represented by the holy spirit that anointed brother branham to give the gift of discernment right so here the the lord discerns sarah's heart and he's and he's stan and she's about standing behind him not even in the tent right and so she just he discerns the thoughts and intents of her heart it's exactly what the ministry of brother branham did discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart so much so brother branham said thus saith the lord he said the gentiles have received their last and greatest sign he said call me a false prophet if you ever see a greater sign than his discernment to the gentile people we haven't seen anything close to it in fact i watched a video where they now have a google profit it's so fake he gets on his smartphone he goes on people's facebook's account uh you know some of his friends meet people out there and then before the service they let know their names and he says he discerns them uh through notes he took on their smartphone but he's actually looking at their facebook accounts and supposedly telling them secrets and it's so fake it's so uh it's such a false impersonation right but brother ram didn't have a smartphone brother ram didn't have human sparks he had the smarts of the holy spirit praise god he had the wisdom of the holy spirit the discernment of god to tell people the very secrets the thoughts intents of their heart true gift of god never missed like all the prophets we talked about the so-called prophets they missed on coronavirus they missed on the riots they missed on the election they missed on everything because they're not called of god and they're doing evil i want you to just notice there in verse 10 i just had this little thought i may have preached it before but the holy spirit seemed to bring to my mind that this was the first visitation but there was going to be another because he said surly he said certainly i'll return according to the time of life so in other words there was two visitations and that should remind us of the former and latter rain right amen brother branham said his ministry was the teaching rain or former rain so this is the former rain the first visitation but then the latter rain what happens body change amen hallelujah the latter rain is the body change the second visitation i believe it's chapter 21 yes 21 verse 1 and the lord visited sarah in the latter rain as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken hallelujah so i got another scripture i need to add that to my notes for the book by god's grace there's another former and latter rain two visitations bless you so we're thankful somehow the angel maybe an angel will visit with the anointing of the holy spirit maybe to be the holy spirit himself maybe we're not sure but we know there's a laddering to come it's thus saith the lord brother man told us out of joel 2 23-26 that's our vision that's what we're longing for that's what we're praying for that's what we're laboring for here out in the vineyard praise god we're in the vineyard of akron ohio right laboring out in the vineyard where the 11th hour workers we gotta just gotta keep laboring he promised to send another rain praise god amen and we're gonna work to that rain comes amen and then the last thought was remember hebrews 11 the bible said that sarah received strength oh my that anointing is going to be so strong it's going to give us the strength we need for a body change just like sarah received the strength for the womb to come back to life and the eggs and everything on the inside and everything inside we had to receive life again and god did it by his amazing grace george that's what we're going to receive and isn't it something that you know in our own human thinking it may seem impossible how is god i don't even know we might say i don't even have faith to heal too thick or i don't even have faith to do this it may seem impossible but sarah you're part of abraham praise god right church you're part of christ you're part of the father right you're children of abraham because you keep the commands of god and god will prove it to you by his visitation we're expecting god to visit us so i hope it happens in my lifetime by god's grace amen we see the former rain we see the former visitation of the teaching rain teaching the people teaching them the word revelations mysteries finished right the teaching reign perhaps we're still under it but the reality is there's coming a ladder rain to finish it where the body gets changed thank god for the visitation of the holy spirit that is to come all right let's go to rebecca here years ago i preached on rebecca i remember when kevin and marie were coming they were really enjoying that little series there on rebecca now this is in genesis 24 i believe the whole story is in genesis 24. rebecca is espoused and married to isaac in in there and it types the spiritual espousal and heavenly marriage to christ the bridegroom remember second corinthians 11 3 says paul had espoused the corinthians to one husband even christ so we see a spousals represent uh natural spouses represent being engaged to jesus christ the new testament church all right now eliezer abraham's chief servant was guided by the holy spirit to find a suitable wife for isaac was it an easy journey and he was under great pressure great strain right but the word got where it needed to go praise god amen what did it go to the big crowds children did you go to the big cities no just went to a little humble place right where rebecca's there and she's able to to answer the prayer of eliezer through the holy spirit that's what it is today but god said brother branham just some humble family praise god there's some humble groups right of course yeah he let him all know around the world but towards the end of his ministry when he realized he was the alleys remember the last time he said he'd uh he just opened up his bible and pointed in 1965 the holy spirit took him to genesis 24 where he's the eliezer to get a bride for isaac and so we know brother branham was the eliezer to get us ready to meet isaac or christ right now once a rebecca's found and accepts a marriage proposal eliezer gives her gifts of valuable jewelry this types the gifts of the holy ghost praise god so the church needs to have the gifts in operation and we looked at them on sunday a little bit uh in a prayer we had a prayer request and come up after service and we looked at them on faith and wisdom and knowledge and and faith and healing and miracles and prophecy and tongues interpretations all these wonderful gifts discernment we see them from time to time as they operate we thank god for it and this bride has all of them praise god amen the bride of jesus christ has all of them praise god i'm speaking of the collective bride of jesus christ imagine if we went through our church and really went down each and every one i imagine we'd see examples of all of them no doubt of course uh eliezer wants to go right back after he finds rebecca she agrees and she and her maidens make the long journey i believe there was 10 of them wasn't there that types of 10 virgins i believe if not mistaken and uh on our way back she's carried by camels right and camel symbolizes the power of the holy ghost uh that will carry us to meet our bridegroom and we just got to keep feeding that power right we just got to keep blessing that power loving and catering to that power right serving that power of the holy spirit focusing on the power of the holy spirit and as we do that that's feeding our souls the word of god that will empower us uh we'll receive the strength right to meet our heavenly bridegroom and then we see the final type here is rebecca meeting isaac out in the field they don't meet in the tent they don't meet in the heavenly house rather they don't meet on the road they meet out in the field and this types meeting christ not in heaven or on earth but meeting christ in the air praise god so that's a really quick go through through the the life of rebecca by god's grace how am i doing on time okay so we've been through that before but i just wanted to go through that quickly here now let's go to the next example azinath wife of joseph let's read this by god's grace actually i'm just going to kind of go through this one rather quickly again i kind of want to end with rahab that's kind of what i i want to end with i've been listening to as i was with moses and brother brown mentions rahab a number of times but let's just go through this briefly as an aph the egyptian wife of joseph types the new testament church her status was a gentile marrying a jew and joseph types christ of course as paul types believers espoused in marriage to christ so in azerath we see ourselves the gentile bride of christ joseph's life before marrying aznath clearly types jesus's earthly ministry they're both rejected by their brethren sold for silver went to prison they were surrounded by two guilty ones ones killed one spared joseph is exalted to second in command which type jesus's resurrection going to the right hand of the majesty on high and then once there on the throne he got a gentile wife which is a type of christ begins to call and espouse a gentile wife to himself after he ascends to the throne remember i read it this week and he said he told the woman of sir venetian i'm not sent to you i'm just sent to the lost house of israel you're a dog basically and she said even the dogs get the crumbs that fall from the masters table praise god look at that gentile faith praise god so gentiles will take whatever they can get amen but we're not dogs anymore we'll say it like that we're not under the table anymore we're not scrounging around the table looking for scraps we have a place at the table how many believe that we're the because the jews have been blind and the children been blinded and now the jews i'm sorry now the gentiles rather have a place at the father's table praise god as paul said be followers of christ he said imitators as dear children right imitate christ as christ's dear children then we know joseph revealing himself to his brethren types the jews revealing himself to the faithful hundred forty four thousand jewish remnant after the rapture the brothers were blinded to his identity just as israel is currently blinded as we looked at under the last series to recognizing jesus as messiah now this revelation couldn't come until joseph put out everyone first from his presence uh even as an ath as she was in her royal quarters uh when he revealed himself to his brethren this types jesus's true bride will be in her heavenly royal headquarters in heaven at the marriage supper of the lamb as christ slips down brother branham says he slips down to make himself known to the 144 000 on mount zion praise god okay so in closing let's just close with uh rahab here all right so the rescue of rahab the gentile harlot from jericho's destruction types the rapture event in 1st thessalonians 4 verses 15 to 18. she's a gentile so she has gentile lineage that speaks of christ rescuing the gentile people at the very end of the times of the gentiles because a small little remnant of gentiles is saved rahab and her family the rest of the gentiles perish right the walls come down every every protection they have every man-made protection crumbles right that's what's gonna happen to this world right that image of the beast right there it is there's the crumbling when christ comes back as a stone he smites the image and it scatters away right uh like like the sheaves i think it was or what was that the chaff like the chaff it's scattered like the chaff just totally scattered and just like when the walls fall down the the stones are just broken and scattered all around nothing left beautiful type there connecting those together i've never seen that before until tonight now what's what was interesting is that rahab is saved by a trumpet and a shout right in joshua 6 verse 5. now the jew gentile bride has one more she has a voice right a voice of an archangel because paul says that the rapture comes as a shout voice and trump of god so very very similar things going on there i'm still praying still asking god show me that voice there praise god i know they shouted with their voices but a voice of an angel right so one archangel not two not three not four not a band of angels one angel one voice of an angel all right now malachi hebrews 11 31 can you read that please i don't know if it's your turn or not but just forgive me look at this uh here we pick up uh rahab here in the hall of fame of faith all right and let's see what it says here uh romans 11 31 i'm sorry hebrews 11 31 by faith the harlot rahab perished not with him that believed not when she had received the spices peace amen so she received the spies with peace did say in peace or with peace is a with or in with there you go we see them with peace so this is the hall of fame of faith chapter so we know rahab received faith and she received them with peace so when she had faith in israel's god it brought peace to the messengers she expressed peace to them she didn't sell them out remember that she actually lied through her teeth right so her faith caused her to express peace to god's spies god's messengers brother graham calls them tape boys we know jeffersonville takes that one to seed right makes it a false doctrine but preachers i'll say like this and that oh there's another case brother brown calls them preachers that's right there's another one i found later so he said two preachers slip in there because state boys don't play or i'm sorry hey boys just play they don't preach so brother i'm called a minister slipped in there he calls him preachers another case so i just think it's so beautiful and brother ram points it out and as i was with moses he said rahab is a type of the gentile bride who never had to see a miracle to believe for the rapture right thomas had to see to believe right so did peter they all had to believe that like all those apostles probably said they didn't have time as faith but remember thomas was a real man of god um he just was a man that needed to see that but this woman rahab didn't need to see it all she did was hear about this god of israel because faith comes by hearing praise god that's all she had to do this is why she types the gentile bride because we don't even have to we don't we didn't even most of us didn't even see brother branham right we never even met him we never saw we never saw water stand up on itself right we never crossed through the red sea we never crossed through a natural river the river jordan imagine that 33 300 billion gallons in a year would pass through there well all those millions of gallons were stacked up on top of each other they walked right through there rahab didn't see that all israel had had was faith and because she had faith in israel's god she received the preachers in peace so that's that's all we have to do we have to have faith in the god that we know there's only one god the true god and whether we see or not we hear it and then we believe it amen that's why especially our young people that's why we had those testimonies last summer right even if you don't see it you need to believe it praise god even though i've seen a few miracles i thank god for them i haven't seen loads and loads and tons of them like um like extreme amazing ones like water being stacked up right or someone walking on water or the dead rays haven't seen that but i believe praise god i know god can do it with all with god all things will be possible but this is the faith of this gentile bride she just hears and then she believes she receives them in peace and they say and she said give me a token right give me something that i know you won't forget and they give her a red cord right and so they give her this red cord it signified her faith but ram types it to the baptism of the holy ghost read of course the blood right the blood of the everlasting covenant the covenant is the holy spirit the life is in the blood the holy spirit is life so we can see how the red core the scarlet cord types the baptism of the holy ghost it's on public display right it's the token it's the token as we saw in exodus chapter 12. and it must be on public display it was it was it was publicly displayed to god's army as they approached remember they marched around there six times right and then on the seventh day they marched around six times or seven times was it seven times or just one more time seven times thank you and so they would have had to seen that march around they would have seen that red cord right the armies of god let's have this the angels of god know we got the token praise god they can see it amen because it's a public life uh the the church of god the armies of god the angels of god can recognize because remember the bible said they go about the city right remember marking with the writers in corn those who sign cry for the abominations done in the city they can see they know who's marked by the holy spirit so we see that's a type the token is a type oil is a type new wedding garment's a type of the holy spirit the dove is the type of the baptism holy ghost there's so many great symbols of the holy ghost only rahab and those in her house were spared from death right everyone else died and that's the type of the tribulation period right they all die but before the destruction we know they had the red core right they were they were saved by grace amen so we know we can see the beautiful type there of the gentile bride being saved from the destruction through the red cord token praise god all right now just a few more things here as we close now what's amazing is we see in the scripture so lydia can you get matthew 1 verse 5. in case you can get ephesians two verse one it's amazing to see that this uh harlot who was rescued she once lived such an ill-famed life sexually immoral but she found faith she received faith so the word of god fell on good ground isn't that something we know if she was a harlot it would the ground wasn't good at one time right but the ram makes a real good case for her like her parents got sick and she had no way to to pay the bills so she had the only way she could get money was to do the work of a harlot but she knew it was wrong the whole time she was kind of trapped into it just like we're trapped into it right we got sin trapped into us that's the reality of it but what did she become after she received that token well she became i said like this she became a kind of like a saver to her family right she said getting here getting here she'd be him a witness and a testimony to her family get inside the house and be saying get inside here you'll be saved and then lydia uh can you read matthew one verse five in simon we got boaz of record and buzzfeed obed of ruth and obedient jesse amen and so rahab is in this lineage here that leads to christ such a beautiful story so god pulls out a gentile out of the world with an ill fame destroys all the people that would have witnessed against her right and said she was an immoral woman they all were destroyed right there was no witnesses against her right that's what god does he takes away all the witnesses right satan has no satan has nothing to accuse us of because it's all been washed away by the blood of jesus christ so she marries into the family right and pretty soon produces a boaz and then a obed and then a a jess and then a david and out of that comes christ amen hallelujah oh my jesus god chose a gentile with an awful previous life and chooses her by faith by the hearing of faith to overcome the destruction of the whole city through a shout and a trump praise god i shout into trump just like the shout voice and trump for the gentile bride to be raptured and saved from destruction it's a beautiful picture uh acacia ephesians two can you read one to six it's a longer portion but this this portion explains our rags to riches story just like rahab's rags to riches story she was under the sense of death she was a harlot spiritually and then physical death she was going to die with the messengers i'm sorry with israel coming and walking around jericho she was going to die so she was under the death sentence but god saved her by grace amen quick and nerve let's read dedication you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the less of our flesh full fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and whereby nature the children of wrath even as others the god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace we are saved amen praise god isn't that beautiful we were all dead in sins we served uh rest of the flesh and the mind like rahab a harlot you know sitting in her body and her mind no doubt but grace came to her she was saved by grace through faith and she was quickened when she heard about the god of israel she was quickened to believe and god saw that quickening and sent her to preachers i was going to say preachers and she heard the word they rece she received the token from their preaching started her own home church praise god like aquila and priscilla hallelujah and then when it came time for the armies of god when god visited the city she was spared praise god such a beautiful scripture now i want to close with this first corinthians 6 the bible says know ye not the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators idolaters adulterers nor effeminate nor abuse or themselves with mankind nor thies nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god now clearly rahab would be either a fornicator or an adulterer look at verse 11 one of the most beautiful scriptures for us and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but you are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god amen think about that think how how long we could imagine rahab was a harlot maybe a year maybe five years consider 10 years how many awful experiences would she have had to relive and satan could have battled her over and over oh you would never be saved god would never love you how could you ever be saved right all those all those mind battles and all those evil things but this proves the quickening power someone could be dead spiritually but when faith drops into their heart it's a brand new life and the power of faith will wash away all those memories can you imagine she went from all those evil memories and the late nights and all the evil things to being married right a new husband a new home receiving a baby right and then seeing the the the family lineage go on and now she of course she would not have seen all of it but eventually would have brought forth a king after the heart of god amen and out of that would have come a real son of david jesus christ why because god knows we were all fallen short of the glory of god we were all in sin we were all dead in sins and trespasses but god sent us the amazing gift of grace it justifies us sanctifies us it washes us by the power of the holy spirit if god can wash that jet that gentile harlot rahab god can surely wash us and he will and he'll keep doing it praise god let's stand let's play spirit of the living god fall fresh that's the beautiful part about joshua the story of joshua i was thinking about that today it's such a beautiful story because god god said i'm with you as i was with moses moses had quite a few mistakes he had more victories no doubt he had quite a few mistakes god never left him god never forsook him despite all rahab's mistakes once faith entered she was a new creature amen we'd say a new creature in christ her sins were washed away forgiven given in marriage fruitful god even blessed the fruit of her womb after all the evils of the womb she had done god bless the fruit of her own because god is the great cleansing agent he's the great redeemer the great healer the great savior the consuming fire the refiners fire praise god thank you jesus i'm reminded as joshua they just even though they lose a battle even though they made a mistake god was still with them church we may have made mistakes this week we may have done evil but we confess it we need to confess it put it under the blood of jesus christ we might have lost one fight we'll definitely win this war by god's grace let's pray together ask the lord to forgive us if we've done anything wrong if we've sinned and embarrassed ourselves or fallen short of the glory of god that god will forgive us just wash that away and the faith that god is trying to give to us tonight we'd receive it it'd quicken us and strengthen us and encourage us to keep going and start the battle over receive a new inspiration of fresh revelation jesus ever lives to do this he ever lives to make intercession for our mistakes hear our prayers minister to our needs it's making us more patient it's a good thing he is because we need patience let's pray heavenly father we thank you for tonight we thank you for the word lord these women lord

power of jesus's blood oh god thank you for that amazing grace thank you for the reality of this truth lord god [Music] you ever lived to make intercession lord and you rebuke the accuser satan and his demons day and night because of the blood of christ thank you jesus for that precious blood hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is all my righteousness
