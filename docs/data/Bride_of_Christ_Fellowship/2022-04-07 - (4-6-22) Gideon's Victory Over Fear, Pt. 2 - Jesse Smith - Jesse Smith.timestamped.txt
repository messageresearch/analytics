[18:12] amen god bless you as you're being
[18:13] seated praise god
[18:20] so we'll pick up right where we left off
[18:25] i just want to reiterate
[18:27] so far what gideon has heard here
[18:29] up to this point there's
[18:31] seven things the angel has told him or
[18:34] the lord has told him
[18:37] and just put yourself in gideon's spot
[18:38] here for a moment
[18:40] you know what would it take for you uh
[18:42] to
[18:43] to believe that god was gonna use you to
[18:46] destroy a whole army of heathens what
[18:48] would it take
[18:49] that are that have the number of the
[18:51] sand of the sea
[18:52] what would it take what kind of
[18:54] uh what kind of faith would you need
[18:57] to do something like that
[19:00] i believe we would need
[19:02] the faith of god i believe we would need
[19:03] the faith of the son of god praise god
[19:06] and so god has got to work on gideon
[19:09] over the course of these
[19:10] days and weeks and months here to help
[19:13] him to overcome his fear that he can
[19:16] lead israel to victory and bring them
[19:19] out of bondage how many want to see your
[19:20] family members out of bondage praise god
[19:22] your friends out of bondage amen god was
[19:24] gonna use this man because this man
[19:27] uh
[19:28] deep down inside he had potential for
[19:30] faith praise god and god was gonna let
[19:32] the trials of his life and the tests and
[19:34] his next few prayers and god was going
[19:37] to work everything together to bring out
[19:39] gideon's real faith which is recorded
[19:42] remember in hebrews 11 this man is a
[19:45] hall of fame member praise god
[19:47] hallelujah he's a member of the hall of
[19:50] fame of faith hallelujah and yet we look
[19:52] at his life and we see you know he was
[19:54] the least in his father's house he
[19:55] wasn't a he wasn't a great one if you
[19:57] lined up getting all of his brothers and
[19:58] sisters he was the least of them he was
[20:01] the one you think well this guy is not
[20:02] going to amount to much but just like
[20:04] david right but when god looks at it
[20:05] when god looks at somebody he doesn't
[20:07] look at the outward appearance amen he
[20:09] looks upon the heart praise god amen
[20:11] that's what god's looking at us tonight
[20:12] god's not looking at so much on our
[20:14] outward appearance yes he wants us to
[20:15] dress holy he wants us to live holy but
[20:17] he's looking at our heart amen
[20:20] and
[20:21] and so we just want to look look what
[20:23] the angels told him so the angel told
[20:25] him six things to this point and god has
[20:27] told him a seventh thing
[20:29] the first thing the angel said is god is
[20:31] with you
[20:33] the second thing he said he said you're
[20:35] a mighty man of valor
[20:37] yet he's the least in his house
[20:40] the angel said go in your might and
[20:41] you'll save israel.
[20:44] the fourth thing he said god has sent
[20:47] you
[20:48] the fifth saying the fifth fifth thing
[20:50] sorry the fifth thing the angel said was
[20:53] i will be with you and you will smite
[20:55] the midianites
[20:56] the sixth thing he said the angel
[20:59] accepted i'm sorry the sixth thing was
[21:01] yes the angel was accepting his meat and
[21:04] bread sacrifice so six things already
[21:07] that the angels told him or accepted and
[21:09] he had every vindication everything he's
[21:11] asked of god god has accepted praise god
[21:16] and then the next thing that very night
[21:17] god meets him at the night time
[21:20] and said get in i give you peace so what
[21:22] does that mean gideon was still battling
[21:24] fear
[21:25] he had all those
[21:27] vindications from the angel but that
[21:28] night he's got he's battling fear and
[21:30] god said peace be with you
[21:33] and then god said fear not you'll not
[21:35] die church what is the what's the you
[21:37] know what's the main thing a man's gonna
[21:38] have to battle a woman's gotta have to
[21:40] battle fear of death
[21:42] right that's the main thing we have to
[21:43] battle in church if we're honest with
[21:45] ourselves as the rapture nears what's
[21:47] the one question we have well am i going
[21:48] to have to die before the rapture
[21:51] right
[21:52] is the squeeze going to produce
[21:53] persecution where some people are going
[21:55] to die before the rapture
[21:58] what about the children will they be
[21:59] will they go in the rapture or they have
[22:00] to stay here and and and be prisoners
[22:03] you know we have all these questions in
[22:05] our mind right and they're real
[22:06] questions they're there's questions
[22:08] these are the same questions we've had
[22:10] for 2000 years because every generation
[22:12] every real believer has believed god was
[22:15] coming in their day
[22:17] if they didn't then they weren't really
[22:19] on fire for god right
[22:21] when you're on fire you live like he's
[22:23] coming soon praise god
[22:25] you keep your soul in a condition where
[22:27] all the sins repented i made this right
[22:29] lord god you know financially you live
[22:31] like you're going to have you know a
[22:33] lifetime but spiritually you live like
[22:35] he could come at any hour and i'll be
[22:37] ready when he calls me amen
[22:39] hallelujah
[22:41] like can you imagine paul's day
[22:43] the roman emperor was murdering
[22:46] christians
[22:47] and you would think you would think
[22:49] after seeing a hundred martyrs you know
[22:51] tens and twenties scores of your friends
[22:54] die you would think well this would be
[22:56] the coming of the lord
[22:58] look at rome the beast the beast is
[23:00] persecuting us right they could say the
[23:02] roman beast is persecuting us
[23:04] and no doubt they would think the
[23:05] rapture would be any day now
[23:07] persecution's at its highest realm
[23:10] but yet what happens another generation
[23:12] comes
[23:13] another and then a couple generations
[23:14] later then rome unites with the
[23:16] government and the government shuts down
[23:18] the persecution
[23:20] and then there's no more persecution
[23:22] right physical persecution but then it's
[23:25] it's a and then following that was the
[23:26] dark ages battle no bad or no very few
[23:29] bibles
[23:31] yet then persecution had really
[23:32] increased during that time
[23:35] but then here we are in the days of john
[23:37] wesley the persecution weakened
[23:39] and since since the days of john wesley
[23:41] the church over well at least in
[23:43] north america has experienced very
[23:46] little persecution but of course in the
[23:47] middle east there's all kinds of
[23:48] persecution on christians and even in
[23:50] the even in the uh the east uh china and
[23:53] so forth north korea there's a lot of
[23:55] persecution on christians
[23:57] so church no matter down through the
[23:58] 2000 years we each believer has had to
[24:01] recognize that jesus could come and the
[24:03] bible said they've got to make
[24:04] themselves ready the bible says you're
[24:06] like a
[24:07] the preachers are like servants feeding
[24:09] the people and then the people are
[24:11] looking and watching for jesus to come
[24:13] in other words we have to be eating and
[24:15] feasting on the word of god and ready so
[24:17] whenever jesus knocks we're ready to
[24:19] open praise god
[24:21] whenever we hear
[24:22] whenever we hear about the coming of the
[24:23] lord whenever you hear the voice of the
[24:25] holy spirit the shout the voice of trump
[24:27] amen the voice of the trump we got to be
[24:29] ready for those times amen we got to
[24:30] live like we're ready to go hallelujah
[24:33] the bible said we'll either live like
[24:34] that or we'll the bible says the
[24:36] preachers will get drunk and start
[24:38] beating the the people
[24:41] right and that's where you get preachers
[24:42] that abuse and hurt the people
[24:44] see but we're not we're not of that type
[24:46] we're not here to beat people and
[24:48] and uh discourage them we're here to
[24:50] feed you the word of god amen and yes
[24:52] part of the feeding is correcting and we
[24:54] get we all got to be corrected from
[24:56] every day the holy spirit has got to
[24:57] correct us praise god so we should
[24:59] expect in sermons to be corrected praise
[25:01] god but overall we're feeding on the
[25:03] word of god we're pointing everyone
[25:05] we're pointing you i'm being pointed the
[25:07] holy spirit's pointing all of us to the
[25:08] word of god amen
[25:10] to feast on the word of god hallelujah
[25:13] whereas denominations are pointing us to
[25:15] their creeds trinity creed you know like
[25:17] we've been talking with people from
[25:18] austin they're pointing them to creeds
[25:20] rather than the word but our objective
[25:22] is to point us to the word of god
[25:24] hallelujah
[25:25] amen
[25:27] so god says you'll not die so church
[25:29] we've got to have the same faith
[25:31] whether i die whether i live or die i'm
[25:33] going to live like jesus christ is
[25:35] coming in my lifetime
[25:37] amen
[25:41] so with all these seven
[25:43] visitations these seven words rather two
[25:45] visitations but seven groups of words
[25:48] gideon is now strong enough with these
[25:50] words he's strong enough to sneak out at
[25:52] night and he's able to chop down his
[25:54] father's groves of idols and destroy the
[25:57] idols and on top of that he's able to
[25:59] organize and set up an altar doesn't
[26:02] that remind you of elijah on mount
[26:03] carmel
[26:04] after the the baal prophets worshiped
[26:07] and cut themselves and no they never got
[26:09] fired from heaven elijah had to order
[26:12] uh the stones first 12 stones amen
[26:14] hallelujah 12
[26:16] government kingdom he had to
[26:19] organize the 12 and then they put water
[26:21] on it in other words you've got to make
[26:22] ready in other words you got to put
[26:24] god's word first and obey all the word
[26:26] of god amen
[26:29] gideon had to obey all the word of god
[26:31] set up a sacrifice church our lives
[26:33] should be living sacrifices amen that's
[26:36] what that represents praise god we live
[26:38] sacrifices unto god
[26:40] like i'm mentoring a brother and tonight
[26:43] tonight is the brother's first night to
[26:45] go to wednesday services in years
[26:48] and i'm mentoring this brother and he's
[26:50] so excited he said i'm trying to get my
[26:51] life back in the habits of god
[26:54] he done it for a year but then he's had
[26:56] some battles and uh there's been some
[26:59] hard mind battles there's been some
[27:00] hurts in the in churches
[27:02] and so the holy spirit has directed him
[27:03] to another church and tonight's his
[27:05] first night he's getting his strength
[27:06] back he's going back to church amen
[27:09] now you know what that's like buddy you
[27:10] just got back
[27:11] in december right now you know what that
[27:13] get those habits back right get your
[27:15] strength back amen
[27:18] and god is building us up amen
[27:20] hallelujah that's what that's what i
[27:22] tell everybody you know that's how i was
[27:23] telling even the uh the man i was
[27:25] mentoring a few days ago i was telling
[27:26] him i said i said you never know what
[27:28] god's gonna do
[27:30] the main thing is to be faithful god can
[27:32] move on to wednesday a sunday morning or
[27:34] sunday night you never know what god's
[27:35] going to do the thing to do is be ready
[27:37] be sanctified be set aside live like
[27:40] he's coming feast on the meat of god and
[27:42] god will show up and god will do what
[27:43] only he can do praise god
[27:45] amen
[27:47] our desire is to be ready
[27:49] for god to use us our desires to be
[27:51] ready for the coming of the lord amen
[27:53] just as getting here is getting ready by
[27:55] the holy spirit he's setting the altar
[27:58] in order and then he sacrifices unto god
[28:03] now wasn't that a beautiful picture
[28:06] we've got a we've got to undo the sins
[28:09] of our past
[28:10] we've got to undo the sins of our
[28:12] parents if if our parents were sinners
[28:14] you know gideon had to undo the sins of
[28:18] his past generation
[28:20] so for us if we're christians we have to
[28:21] forgive people who've hurt us in the
[28:23] past
[28:24] we've got to forgive our mothers forgive
[28:26] our fathers amen if anyone our uncles
[28:28] aunts or grandparents anyone who's hurt
[28:30] us we got to forgive that we got to undo
[28:32] that praise god
[28:33] amen we got to move on from the past we
[28:36] have to give a fresh sacrifice of
[28:38] ourselves unto god amen
[28:40] that's how you move on with god that's
[28:42] how you see the miracle praise god
[28:44] amen
[28:45] hallelujah
[28:48] and so gideon sets up the altar in verse
[28:50] 26 26 and 27 as we read
[28:55] now look at verse 28 now here we are
[28:56] let's get into our text here we'll
[28:57] preach as
[28:58] far as we can here by the grace of god
[29:03] his battle overcoming fear
[29:06] verse 28 when the men of the city arose
[29:08] early in the morning behold the altar of
[29:09] baal was cast down and the grove was cut
[29:12] down that was by it and the second
[29:14] bullock was offered upon that altar that
[29:16] was built and they said one to another
[29:18] who had done this thing and when they
[29:19] inquired and asked they said gideon the
[29:22] son of joash
[29:23] had done this thing
[29:27] all right so now his name gets out it's
[29:29] a morning everybody saw oh they uh our
[29:32] gods are down someone's uh someone's
[29:34] trying to clean up our lives here
[29:36] someone's trying to clean up the
[29:37] neighborhood
[29:38] who was it who was it gideon
[29:41] see church let me say like this
[29:43] whenever you try to do something for god
[29:45] there's always going to be criticism
[29:47] there's always going to be people
[29:49] mocking you or
[29:51] there's always going to be somebody
[29:52] against you
[29:54] right but you but
[29:56] if we look at the picture the angel of
[29:58] the lord has told gideon he's with him
[30:00] and god has told him he's with him so if
[30:03] the angel and god is with gideon who can
[30:05] be against him amen
[30:07] if you're standing for god's word if
[30:09] you're making sacrifices for god who can
[30:11] be against you nobody can be against you
[30:13] praise god
[30:14] amen
[30:17] verse 30 then the men of that city said
[30:19] unto joash bring out thy son that he may
[30:21] die okay now now it's getting serious
[30:24] death threats
[30:27] because he hath cast down the altar of
[30:28] baal because he hath cut down the grove
[30:30] that was by it
[30:32] and joe i said unto all that stood
[30:34] against him that's a good question
[30:36] will you plead for baal
[30:39] will you save him
[30:40] in other words are you going to save
[30:42] your god
[30:43] are you going to are you going to argue
[30:45] your god's case why does your god fight
[30:47] for himself
[30:48] if he's god let him fight for himself
[30:50] right
[30:51] he that will plead for him let him be
[30:53] put to death whilst it is yet mourning
[30:55] if he be a god let him plead for himself
[30:57] because one hath cast down his altar
[31:02] great that's a great comeback amen
[31:05] why do we got to kill him if he's a god
[31:06] he'll fight for himself amen
[31:08] is that right
[31:10] church god knows how to do things amen
[31:12] god knows how to get his man or his
[31:14] woman in position amen
[31:16] the bible said god is a man of war
[31:18] praise god
[31:20] god wants to move if god wants to raise
[31:21] up valleys or bring down mountains god
[31:23] can do it praise god
[31:25] he can do whatever he wants
[31:27] and look at the wisdom of this father
[31:28] here
[31:30] to say don't go kill him let that god
[31:32] fight for himself
[31:34] hallelujah if he's really god he'll
[31:35] fight for himself verse 32 therefore on
[31:38] that day he called him
[31:40] jerubale
[31:42] drew bale saying let baal plead against
[31:44] him because he had thrown down his altar
[31:46] so here gideon gets a new name
[31:50] gideon gets a name jerubable or druba
[31:53] yeah somehow they say like that drubale
[31:55] or drubable
[31:57] and that means let baal plead against
[31:59] him
[32:00] so now he's known
[32:02] now he gets a reputation now he's known
[32:05] by the god that he defeated
[32:07] amen
[32:08] see in other words church as you get
[32:10] victories you're going to have a
[32:11] reputation praise god amen hallelujah as
[32:15] you serve god you're going to have
[32:16] reputation well you better

[32:31] called you to do praise god
[32:33] now what was getting his name his name
[32:34] met hewer right he was a cutter down
[32:37] of trees in this case he didn't cut down
[32:40] trees so much the main thing he got done
[32:42] was false idols amen
[32:44] he was born to destroy the works of
[32:47] satan amen hallelujah
[32:49] he was born to redeem his family can i
[32:51] say it like that praise god brother
[32:53] austin and sister lena you're born to

[33:28] brothers know when they really need
[33:29] prayer they're going to go to that
[33:30] person for prayer my wife knows who i'm
[33:31] talking about
[33:33] there's people you'll go to when you
[33:35] need prayer
[33:36] hallelujah
[33:38] and thank god for the prayers of the
[33:39] saints because it's through the holy
[33:41] spirit
[33:42] so gideon gets a reputation now that
[33:45] he's the one who cut down bale's altar
[33:47] hallelujah
[33:50] god used him to defeat false gods
[33:53] and look he's got a new name he's got a
[33:55] new reputation or new reputation praise
[33:57] god that's what happened when that's
[33:58] what happened to brother branham when he
[34:00] come out and started discerning now he's
[34:01] called a prophet of god he's called a
[34:02] seer
[34:03] right you gotta you gotta issue go to
[34:05] god's seer
[34:07] right and that's what they do they would
[34:08] flock to his meetings just to get a
[34:10] chance to be in his presence that
[34:12] perhaps god would speak to them and how
[34:14] many hundreds how many thousands of
[34:15] people praise god maybe millions were
[34:18] helped by the prophet of god because he
[34:19] had a reputation for being a seer praise
[34:21] god

[34:34] devote time amen
[34:36] you got to sacrifice time like gideon
[34:38] sacrifice amen
[34:41] sacrifice
[34:43] that's why time is the most valuable
[34:45] thing
[34:45] time is way more valuable than money but
[34:48] i'm saying you're gonna have to
[34:49] sacrifice time if you want to see the
[34:50] gifts of god in operation
[34:52] i remember the night we prayed and god

[34:56] was what a sacrifice of time and energy
[34:58] we were up later that night i got less

[38:51] dad changed amen
[38:53] when they see you change others will
[38:55] want to change praise god
[38:56] amen
[39:01] now
[39:02] verse 33
[39:04] then all the midianites and the
[39:06] amalekites and the children of the east
[39:07] were gathered together and went over and
[39:09] pitched in the valley of jezreel
[39:11] now look at this verse 34.
[39:13] but the spirit of the lord came upon
[39:15] gideon
[39:17] and he blew a trumpet and abby eezer was
[39:20] gathered after him
[39:22] now look church the spirit
[39:25] closed getting in verse 34 he gets
[39:28] clothed with the spirit the spirit comes
[39:30] on him
[39:32] praise god
[39:33] see church when the spirit's on you
[39:36] you're you're a different person
[39:38] when the anointing is on you now you
[39:40] blow a public trumpet i'm ready to fight
[39:43] now amen what's a trump a trumpets for
[39:45] gathering or war praise god
[39:49] he didn't blow it before that he had to
[39:50] wait till he got victory in his home
[39:52] life amen when he got victory in his
[39:54] home life he got the real victory there
[39:57] then the holy spirit comes out upon he
[39:59] obeyed the first three steps he gets the
[40:01] spirit up the spirit comes upon him he
[40:02] said now i'm ready to fight now i'm
[40:05] ready to go out and do what god's really
[40:06] called me to do
[40:09] right that lines up with the joshua
[40:10] series right don't try to go conquer
[40:12] some other land conquer your land first
[40:16] don't try to correct other people you
[40:17] correct yourself first
[40:19] get your life cleaned up first then
[40:22] god's spirit will come upon you and now
[40:23] you're ready to fight
[40:25] amen
[40:27] hallelujah praise god
[40:30] he blows the trumpet
[40:32] and ebby ease of the priest was gathered
[40:33] after him this is so beautiful the bible
[40:36] says put you on the lord jesus christ
[40:39] see just like the spirit comes upon
[40:41] gideon
[40:43] the bible says as many as have been
[40:45] baptized into christ have put on christ
[40:48] amen
[40:50] see the anointing comes it's time for
[40:52] the blowing of the trumpet for a
[40:54] gathering
[40:56] because jesus said you'll be endued or
[40:58] clothed with power from on high
[41:00] hallelujah
[41:02] so this is a type of the baptism of the
[41:04] holy ghost
[41:08] justification was when gideon got called
[41:11] right
[41:14] sanctification would have been breaking
[41:16] down the altar of baal
[41:17] and this is the feeling because the
[41:19] spirit of god came upon him amen
[41:22] hallelujah beautiful type there
[41:24] so justification is just giving a
[41:27] sacrifice right believing the word of
[41:29] god sanctification clean out your life
[41:32] clean out your home amen get all the
[41:34] idols out of your family out of your
[41:36] life amen
[41:38] then when you get that victory pretty
[41:39] soon the spirit's going to come
[41:41] hallelujah amen
[41:43] in that beautiful
[41:44] the spirit of god comes upon him
[41:48] in verse 35 and he sent messengers
[41:50] throughout all manasseh who also was
[41:52] gathered after him and he sent
[41:53] messengers unto asher and his unto
[41:55] zebulon and the naphtali and they came
[41:57] up to medium
[42:01] all right so he's got the baptism of the
[42:03] holy ghost now he's ready for war he's
[42:05] got a big church behind him now too
[42:07] big church
[42:10] he's got a big church
[42:14] but you know even now even with a big
[42:16] church with a big uh a big group behind
[42:19] him even with all this support of
[42:21] warriors men that would fight
[42:24] he still has fear within him
[42:28] praise god
[42:30] how many know what i'm talking about you
[42:31] can be baptized filled with the holy
[42:33] ghost you can be sanctified justified
[42:35] and so so uh so bold sometimes but then
[42:38] other times you can have still feel fear
[42:40] inside your body
[42:43] simon just told me there's a sister that
[42:44] he still talks to and elderly sister and
[42:46] she says every time remember i come up
[42:48] for prayer crying on was it sunday night
[42:49] i was praying oh yeah sunday night i
[42:51] come up for prayer i really needed god
[42:53] to help me and i felt like god answered
[42:55] my prayer because i felt strike this
[42:57] week
[43:00] but brother simon tried to encourage me
[43:01] he said brother he said every time i
[43:03] talk to this certain sister
[43:06] she says oh thank god for brother jesse
[43:08] he's such a bull he's bold as a lion
[43:10] and he said every time
[43:13] i see her and we talk about you she says
[43:15] that
[43:16] you have that testimony
[43:18] because i'm afraid to preach whatever
[43:20] god puts on my heart now there's
[43:22] sometimes i fall short i'm not perfect
[43:23] you know who is
[43:25] there's no perfect preacher
[43:29] but i've never really cared about
[43:30] popularity
[43:32] right and so it is to this day
[43:35] that's fine i'm going to preach the
[43:37] truth no matter what anybody says amen
[43:39] if i gotta stand alone i'm gonna preach
[43:41] the truth of god
[43:43] i can only preach what the holy spirit
[43:44] has shown me praise god
[43:48] but i need a prayer for that i need a
[43:49] prayer for more boldness amen
[43:53] i need a prayer for uh to god to help me
[43:57] in this particular battle of my life
[44:02] see because we all have fear even paul
[44:05] remember paul paul raised the dead
[44:08] paul had prayed for eutychus he fell out
[44:10] of the the second story room he died he
[44:13] prayed for him raised him from the dead
[44:15] paul had been to the aina melita and
[44:17] seen that the governor
[44:19] his father healed of a bloody flux
[44:23] just a a blood oozing out of his body
[44:26] with infections
[44:28] paul had seen a miraculous miracle there
[44:31] but still the bible says in second
[44:33] corinthians 7 5 that paul had fears
[44:35] within and fears without
[44:38] praise god this ought to be so
[44:40] encouraging to us church no matter what
[44:43] god has called us to he's going to use
[44:45] all the events of our life to drive out
[44:47] all of our fear
[44:49] amen
[44:50] hallelujah
[44:52] a church that's why i rehearse from time
[44:54] to time with austin that's why i
[44:55] rehearse what that we got through y2k
[44:58] that i got through barack obama
[45:01] that i got through the blood moons that
[45:03] we got through the uh
[45:05] 2018 70 years from israel
[45:08] we got through coronavirus in 2020
[45:11] we got through the election of 2020 even
[45:13] though it was rigged
[45:15] they know it's rigged that's why the you
[45:17] just you just take whatever opposite
[45:18] whatever the liberal media is saying
[45:20] that's what's probably true
[45:21] it's very very simple
[45:23] very simple
[45:24] because they're liars
[45:26] right
[45:28] and now here russia ukraine we've got to
[45:30] live through this
[45:32] everybody's shaken up is this the end of
[45:33] the world shaking up
[45:36] it may be but it may not be amen
[45:38] and if it's not then we've got to have
[45:40] faith no matter what we've got to have
[45:41] faith amen
[45:43] we've got to look at our past and say
[45:45] god has helped me here god help me there
[45:47] god help me there god never left me
[45:48] there he's with me here he'll bring me
[45:50] through this the spirit of god will
[45:52] raise up a standard amen
[45:54] i'll be able to fly the banner of
[45:56] christianity if nobody else stands i'll
[45:58] stand amen our army does not retreat
[46:02] praise god our army goes forward in the
[46:04] name of jesus amen
[46:06] hallelujah
[46:08] so paul had fears within we have fears
[46:10] within
[46:12] he overcame will overcome
[46:14] gideon had fears and so the next verse
[46:16] verse 36
[46:18] is
[46:19] the second sign that he asks for
[46:23] now remember when brother brian hawkins
[46:25] was here and he said
[46:27] there's times you got to test god what
[46:29] he meant and he corrected it later he
[46:30] said what i meant is you can prove god
[46:34] because that's what the bible says with
[46:36] tithes and offerings remember in the
[46:37] book of malachi god said himself prove
[46:40] me
[46:41] with your tithe offering see if i won't
[46:43] open up the windows of heaven amen
[46:45] hallelujah
[46:47] and you're debt-free because of that
[46:48] amen
[46:49] hallelujah so am i except for my
[46:51] mortgage yeah
[46:54] because god has opened up the windows of
[46:56] heaven praise god
[46:57] and so gideon is just like any of us we
[47:00] we we get we get uh fearful sometimes we
[47:03] battle unbelief our faith is growing
[47:05] right but it's not maybe where it needs
[47:07] to be and so we need we say god give me
[47:09] a sign here god give me a give me an
[47:11] encouragement here lord give me a sign
[47:13] that i'm on the right direction church
[47:14] and that's what it is we're proving god
[47:16] that's normal
[47:18] remember paul was going to go to
[47:20] missionary work but then the holy spirit
[47:22] said i forbid you to go there so god
[47:24] sent him a dream of a man right
[47:27] in philippi
[47:29] saying come minister to us come in and
[47:31] the bible said well based father's dream
[47:32] we know which way to go now
[47:35] they're putting god to the test they're
[47:37] proving god's word they're proving god's
[47:39] will church that's the main thing i love
[47:41] that quote brother i said read your
[47:42] bible and pray every day
[47:44] he said before you make a decision say
[47:46] father would you have me to do this and
[47:48] he said somehow a way or another god
[47:50] will answer your request
[47:52] just pray about it amen
[47:55] just pray about every situation
[47:59] that's all we got to do church
[48:01] just pray and say god show me your will
[48:04] now some people need more signs than
[48:05] others
[48:06] but we can't criticize that because we
[48:08] all need signs that sometimes
[48:11] brother ram needed signs at the end of
[48:12] his life right he was he wanted a sign
[48:14] that he was going to be healed right
[48:15] from the
[48:16] uh the
[48:17] stomach sickness he got a sign praise
[48:18] god came on the wings of a dove amen
[48:21] hallelujah
[48:23] there's nothing wrong with wanting signs
[48:25] to know you're in the will of god
[48:27] just make sure it's a real sign from god
[48:30] and if we're not sure like we talked
[48:31] about say lord willing
[48:34] if the lord is willing
[48:36] because we're not prophets
[48:38] right we don't speak i've never heard
[48:40] any of you say thus saith the lord which
[48:41] is good
[48:43] because you're not testing god you're
[48:44] not trying to promote yourself as a
[48:45] false prophet and you see the uh
[48:47] happened a few months ago one of the
[48:49] false prophets of the uh prosperity
[48:51] gospel died from coven after he cursed
[48:54] coven and said it was gone in the name
[48:56] of the lord and he died from covet
[48:58] so you don't play around with god
[49:01] do not that man was playing around with
[49:02] he was pretending to be a prophet and
[49:04] then he died he said uh god he said i'm
[49:06] quoting all these scriptures i rebuke
[49:08] cove and it's gone and he died from it
[49:11] that's a false prophet
[49:14] remember that kenneth copeland he cursed
[49:17] it a couple weeks after it started it
[49:18] said it was gone and it was dead and but
[49:20] it hung it's still here people still get
[49:23] covered
[49:25] liars they're liars
[49:26] professional liars money making liars
[49:28] and no one holds them accountable
[49:31] see but you and i will hold each other
[49:32] accountable because we're honest we're
[49:34] really we have good and honest hearts
[49:35] the bible says
[49:37] so it's good
[49:38] it's good we don't prophesy unless we're
[49:40] called to it by god
[49:45] okay
[49:46] now he needs a sign he's now he's got
[49:48] his he got his clothes got his spiritual
[49:49] anointing he's baptized with the holy
[49:51] ghost but he still has a great enemy to
[49:53] overcome
[49:55] so he said lord i need a few more signs
[49:57] that you're with me
[49:59] in fact he actually gets four total
[50:00] signs
[50:02] he's got the first one the first one was
[50:04] that offering he laid before the angel
[50:06] right the meat and the cakes he said if
[50:08] you're it's really god receive my
[50:10] sacrifice and the bible said the angel
[50:12] stuck the the stick out and burned it up
[50:14] and consumed it
[50:16] now he's got the holy ghost we say in
[50:17] type he's got his army he's got his
[50:19] brother and his big church behind him
[50:21] and in verse 36 and gideon said unto god
[50:26] notice it's not god to gideon it's
[50:27] getting to god
[50:31] if thou wilt save israel by mine hand as
[50:33] thou hast said behold i will put a
[50:36] fleece of wool in the floor and if the
[50:39] dew be on the fleece only
[50:41] and if he be dry upon all the earth
[50:43] beside then shall i know that thou wilt
[50:45] save israel by mine hand as thou has
[50:47] said
[50:49] and look church and it was so
[50:53] for he rose up early on the morrow and
[50:55] thrust the fleece together and ring the
[50:57] dew out of the fleece a bowl full of
[50:59] water
[51:01] right
[51:03] now look church we have to remember this
[51:06] gideon could ask this because he already
[51:08] had thus saith the lord that this was
[51:10] his job
[51:12] see many times the mistake we make as
[51:14] christians we ask god for signs but we
[51:16] don't even know yet if this is god's
[51:17] will for us
[51:19] but gideon already had the will of god
[51:22] it was god's will he said you're not
[51:24] going to die i'm going to be with you
[51:25] you're going to conquer the midi nights
[51:27] don't fear
[51:29] but he still needed some more
[51:30] vindications that he was going to get it
[51:35] so the trouble of the trouble that we do
[51:36] sometimes we say lord just give me this
[51:38] sign if it's your will but we haven't
[51:40] even prayed first and made sure the
[51:41] direction we're going is the right
[51:42] direction
[51:49] so what is it gideon wants to get rid of
[51:51] all the doubt because what the bible say
[51:52] he's a man of faith
[51:55] he's a man of faith
[51:57] what is faith faith is a substance of
[51:59] things hoped for what the evidence of
[52:01] things not seen
[52:03] so what he he needed more substance in
[52:06] his heart right he he said
[52:08] i just read that this week that man come
[52:09] up
[52:10] uh
[52:11] the man come up to jesus
[52:13] i forget i can't remember the story now
[52:15] i've just been
[52:17] i can't remember exactly the scripture
[52:18] but the man uh
[52:20] the man cried out for healing i believe
[52:21] was that maybe was the leper and i can't
[52:23] remember the leper the blind man
[52:26] and jesus said if you can believe and he
[52:27] said lord i believe but he said help
[52:29] might unbelief that was the father the
[52:31] boy with the the demon the father the
[52:32] boy with the demon
[52:35] he said lord i believe and he said it in
[52:37] tears he said help my unbelief
[52:40] and so jesus helps his unbelief see
[52:43] that's a church that's what we got we
[52:44] all get we all have that see he has a
[52:46] face side but he still has a human side
[52:49] and our human side is never going to
[52:50] want to believe so that should almost
[52:52] always be our prayer god i believe help
[52:54] me to get past this unbelief amen
[52:56] hallelujah that's the battle between
[52:58] faith and doubt
[53:03] he's a man of faith see that's a good
[53:05] sign that you do have faith
[53:07] that you know you got to overcome your
[53:08] unbelief praise god
[53:10] god has brought you so far but you know
[53:12] you got to go further with god how many
[53:14] want to go further with god
[53:16] then we've got to say lord i believe
[53:18] you're going to take me to rapture i
[53:19] believe you're going to save my mom or
[53:20] save my dad but help my unbelief praise
[53:23] god that's me tonight amen
[53:24] hallelujah praise god
[53:27] i believe but help my unbelief
[53:33] in other words gideon in other words
[53:35] pray in other words he prayed with the
[53:37] fleece he prayed until he got the answer
[53:40] and that's what we do we pray till we
[53:42] get the answer
[53:47] lord i got a big church now but i want
[53:48] to make sure this is your will for me
[53:51] you told me but i want to make sure
[53:57] now notice a fleece is a woolly covering
[53:59] of a sheep or a goat
[54:02] and in this case it's a miracle only
[54:05] when the dew falls on the lamb's
[54:07] covering rather than on the ground
[54:10] wet fleece and a dry ground was a
[54:13] miracle
[54:15] so this fleece was a lost sheep
[54:18] because it lost its life i'm just going
[54:20] to use a little type here
[54:21] but see first the water must fall on the
[54:24] lost sheep of the house of israel
[54:26] this type's israel
[54:28] right
[54:29] the ground which represents the gentile
[54:31] was dry first and had no rain
[54:34] because dew represents speech or the
[54:37] word of god right
[54:39] the bible said let your word fall as
[54:41] rain i read that to you a few weeks ago
[54:45] and also reign represents the coming of
[54:47] god so jesus was coming down praise god
[54:50] amen
[54:51] and then god answered he woke and he
[54:53] found the fleece
[54:55] wet and the ground dry
[54:57] the lost sheep was rung together in
[54:59] order to extract the water
[55:01] see water fills a bowl when a fleece is
[55:03] rung or or drained out
[55:06] praise god
[55:07] that's a good type there i'll fill my
[55:09] cup lord amen
[55:10] so this was showing gideon god's going
[55:12] to fill the cup amen
[55:14] god's going to bless you god's going to
[55:16] meet all your desires amen
[55:20] look at verse 30
[55:21] 39
[55:25] and gideon said unto god let not thine
[55:27] anger be hot against you does that
[55:29] remind you of anybody
[55:31] abraham
[55:33] remember brother austin abraham prayed
[55:35] for a lot to be saved and he went back
[55:38] and each time he went back he went back
[55:39] i think five or six times
[55:41] and each time he said lord please don't
[55:42] be angry i'm going to ask you another
[55:44] request
[55:47] he said lord he said lord if there's 50
[55:49] yes if there's 40 if there's 30. finally
[55:52] abraham got lord if there's 10 please he
[55:54] said don't let your anger be hiding
[55:56] against me
[55:57] but lord if there's 10 will you spare
[55:59] nineveh and he said yes if there's 10.
[56:01] and the bible said then the lord left
[56:02] from abraham
[56:05] so we see gideon praying a lot like his
[56:07] father abraham amen his spiritual father
[56:10] amen
[56:12] he's asking for more grace and prayer
[56:14] requests oh church we can do the same
[56:15] thing today ask for more grace
[56:19] lord give me more grace
[56:22] times are getting tougher
[56:24] the challenge seems harder but i'm going
[56:26] to come again lord i need i need you to
[56:28] answer my prayer lord i'm coming again
[56:30] answer our request dear god
[56:32] amen
[56:34] i'm asking again here i am again lord
[56:36] here i am again
[56:40] that's why we never give up praying
[56:42] because we never gave up for you buddy
[56:44] never gave up for austin five years
[56:46] that's why we got to keep praying for
[56:47] the miracles of these sick people we got
[56:48] to keep praying don't we can't give up
[56:52] if we give up then we'll never get
[56:53] nothing
[56:56] he prays like abraham asking for more
[56:58] grace
[57:02] let me finish that scripture
[57:04] let not thine anger be hide against me
[57:05] verse 39 and i will speak but this once
[57:07] let me prove i pray thee with this but
[57:09] once with the fleece
[57:12] let it now be dry upon
[57:14] only upon the fleece and upon all the
[57:17] ground let there be dew
[57:19] and god did so that night
[57:22] for it was dry upon the fleece only and
[57:24] there was dew on all the ground
[57:28] praise god
[57:30] so now he says let it be opposite let
[57:32] the ground have do
[57:33] he wanted god's proofs forward and
[57:35] backwards
[57:37] inside and out praise god he wanted
[57:39] everything and in every way
[57:43] in other words i want to know for sure i
[57:44] don't want one shadow of doubt that
[57:46] you're going to do what you promise
[57:48] you're going to do praise god
[57:50] that's why we should pray more right
[57:51] that's why we need to keep praying lord
[57:53] i don't want any doubts or take out all
[57:54] my doubts help me to be a man help me to
[57:57] be a woman of faith
[57:59] praise god i don't want to be in god's
[58:00] hall of fame one day
[58:02] hallelujah
[58:04] i'm in the hall of fame of high school
[58:06] sports
[58:08] how did i get there by practicing
[58:10] working hard
[58:12] i i i
[58:14] i didn't cheat the system i worked hard
[58:16] i kept going even though i got hurt it's
[58:18] okay i rehab and get better
[58:20] and now i'm in the hall of fame
[58:22] who cares about that one but we got
[58:25] lessons from that amen hallelujah praise
[58:27] god
[58:28] we're running a race for jesus amen
[58:32] the bible says we're not beating the air
[58:34] we're actually fighting a real enemy
[58:36] and so we need to say lord increase my
[58:38] faith lord i might lose a few fights but
[58:40] help me to keep battling praise god that
[58:42] i do not lose the war i win the war if i
[58:45] just keep going at it praise god
[58:47] amen
[58:51] gideon new you can't quit
[58:53] you can't give up you can't quit and
[58:54] expect to win
[58:57] and then there's also the you can't
[58:59] break the rules and expect to win you've
[59:00] got to come god's provided way
[59:03] amen
[59:05] there's 30 minutes about 45 minutes
[59:07] preaching
[59:08] let me try to close this here
[59:12] see there's nothing wrong with being
[59:13] like gideon lord i need to know that i
[59:15] know that i know you're going to do this
[59:19] i need additional signs
[59:21] okay whatever you need
[59:23] the thing to do is keep praying and so
[59:25] you're certain you know god's will
[59:30] that's why before i started preaching
[59:31] brother i fasted and prayed i think two
[59:32] days that week
[59:34] and asked god lord give me an undeniable
[59:36] vindication
[59:37] and before i even come up to preach a
[59:39] sister in the congregation
[59:41] gave a word of knowledge and it was
[59:43] basically telling what i was going to
[59:44] preach and i felt real good after that
[59:47] and after i preached the first two times
[59:48] the altar was full of people crying
[59:50] weeping repenting getting deliverance
[59:52] getting victories healings all kinds of
[59:54] things so there was no doubt anymore in
[59:56] my mind that was called to preach now
[59:58] did i have doubts later on when the when
[59:59] i come here and the church is small yes
[1:00:01] i have doubts
[1:00:03] but i just asked god for more
[1:00:04] vindication i asked god for an amen and
[1:00:06] god gave me an amen
[1:00:08] hallelujah in 2014 amen
[1:00:11] that's right
[1:00:13] i put god to the test amen
[1:00:17] i said prove your word god prove your
[1:00:19] will for my life i don't want to be
[1:00:20] outside your will i just want to do what
[1:00:22] you've called me to do praise god
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:30] so see church we can all look at our
[1:00:31] lives and we can see ourselves in
[1:00:33] getting how many can see yourself and
[1:00:34] get in
[1:00:35] i clean out my house
[1:00:38] anointed by the holy spirit ready for
[1:00:40] war but i still lord i still need your
[1:00:42] your signs in my life
[1:00:45] i still need to know that i know inside
[1:00:47] and out forwards and backwards that you
[1:00:49] are with me
[1:00:52] see
[1:00:54] the the backsliding comes when you don't
[1:00:56] when you just assume god is with you
[1:00:58] instead of knowing inside and out that
[1:01:00] god is with you
[1:01:02] that's when the backsliding starts
[1:01:04] you just assume you're well god anointed
[1:01:06] me one time gideon said well god anoint
[1:01:08] me one time i don't need any more signs
[1:01:10] no see i need that constant there just i
[1:01:12] knew that constant communion with jesus
[1:01:15] amen
[1:01:16] oh
[1:01:18] i said god said something there praise
[1:01:20] god
[1:01:20] amen
[1:01:22] it's that constant if i'm going to do
[1:01:24] something that takes more than a
[1:01:26] conqueror i need the conqueror with me
[1:01:28] praise god
[1:01:29] because i am not a conqueror on my own
[1:01:31] i'm nothing i'm a sinner saved by grace
[1:01:33] i'm just a vessel but i'm a vessel in
[1:01:35] the potter's hand amen
[1:01:38] i have to make sure that my decisions my
[1:01:40] life is pleasing the potter
[1:01:50] see church we got to know god is with us
[1:01:52] through and through
[1:01:54] inside out up and down forward and
[1:01:56] backward praise god
[1:01:58] like when you go to those taekwondo
[1:01:59] tests brother i got to know those
[1:02:01] the korean words and the english words
[1:02:02] forward and backwards
[1:02:04] now they usually only ask us in korean
[1:02:06] right but you got to know it forward and
[1:02:07] backward
[1:02:09] you got to know it
[1:02:10] because you're going to get tested
[1:02:12] how many know you're going to get tested
[1:02:13] praise god
[1:02:15] don't forget job now church
[1:02:18] he lost his family his health his money
[1:02:20] all for what a test
[1:02:22] to test his character
[1:02:24] that's what it was all about that's the
[1:02:26] only thing it was about of course it
[1:02:27] made him more humble he repented but the
[1:02:30] whole thing was testing that man does
[1:02:31] that man really loved god god said find
[1:02:34] devil take everything away from him
[1:02:35] except his life and you'll see his
[1:02:38] character will stand all your tests may
[1:02:40] god help us have real character like
[1:02:42] that praise god no matter what god
[1:02:44] allows we'll stand the test and we'll
[1:02:46] overcome and we'll we'll shine the
[1:02:48] character of jesus christ of this world
[1:02:50] amen

[1:03:31] for hezekiah
[1:03:33] he defied the very laws of nature joshua

[1:03:42] joshua water move back water make up a
[1:03:45] wall two million people are coming

[1:03:53] to highways amen
[1:03:55] graves in the gardens amen that's what
[1:03:58] he does he defies the very laws of
[1:04:00] nature praise god
[1:04:04] to tell you and vindicate that he's with
[1:04:07] you
[1:04:10] that's a lot like joshua a lot like
[1:04:12] moses
[1:04:13] a lot like all these prophets of god
[1:04:15] like the kings of israel
[1:04:18] now look church now gideon could say the
[1:04:20] god of joshua's with me because i just
[1:04:23] saw nature's laws defied just like
[1:04:26] joshua
[1:04:27] amen praise god
[1:04:29] hallelujah
[1:04:31] and church that's how we are when when
[1:04:33] we come to church and somebody preaches
[1:04:35] on our lives or some secret is revealed
[1:04:37] through a fellowship with a believer and
[1:04:39] we should say the same god that did that
[1:04:41] brother brahm's life that same god is
[1:04:43] here tonight amen
[1:04:45] hallelujah
[1:04:47] when we see god doing the same thing he
[1:04:49] did back there today we can say this is
[1:04:52] that praise god it's the same god god is
[1:04:54] here directing us he's letting us know
[1:04:57] we're on the way to victory just keep
[1:04:59] pressing forward receive the signs
[1:05:01] receive the word receive all of it
[1:05:03] praise god
[1:05:06] almost tripped there
[1:05:09] hallelujah the god of joshua's here
[1:05:12] he's doing the same works that he's
[1:05:14] always done
[1:05:20] hallelujah
[1:05:22] see this shows church god can put his
[1:05:24] water anywhere he wants
[1:05:26] with his fleece
[1:05:28] he can put it wherever he wants
[1:05:31] he can send water there can i say like
[1:05:33] this he can send a revival to our
[1:05:34] families
[1:05:38] that's what i need to prayer for amen
[1:05:39] that's what i want prayer for
[1:05:42] to have faith that god can do it praise
[1:05:44] god
[1:05:45] but see it also takes desperation also
[1:05:47] takes a man who's desperate like gideon
[1:05:48] too the bible said getting went to god
[1:05:52] god didn't come ask again hey you want
[1:05:53] to sign gideon was desperate and wanted
[1:05:55] to go to god for another sign
[1:06:01] hallelujah
[1:06:03] god can direct his waters his blessings
[1:06:05] to anyone he wants to
[1:06:09] see now the waters are on the vast
[1:06:11] ground which is the gentiles
[1:06:13] then the fleece of israel is dry isn't
[1:06:15] that what we got today didn't jesus say
[1:06:17] what will be done in the dry tree
[1:06:20] what about the green tree what about the
[1:06:21] dry tree
[1:06:22] the dry tree is a time without christ
[1:06:27] so the gentiles the green tree the
[1:06:29] living tree
[1:06:30] so we see a beautiful type in this
[1:06:32] fleece of jew and gentile
[1:06:34] christ death does it both right
[1:06:38] christ's death brings forth water to the
[1:06:40] jews water to the gentiles
[1:06:42] hallelujah
[1:06:54] now let's go to chapter seven here we'll
[1:06:55] just do a couple more verses and we'll
[1:06:56] be done here tonight
[1:07:08] then drubable who is
[1:07:09] gideon and all the people that were with
[1:07:11] him rose up early and pitched beside the
[1:07:13] well of herod
[1:07:14] so that the host of the midnights were
[1:07:15] on the north side of them by the hill of
[1:07:18] mora in the valley and the lord said
[1:07:20] again the people that are with thee
[1:07:22] are too many for me to give
[1:07:25] the midianites into their hands lest
[1:07:27] israel vault themselves against me
[1:07:30] saying mine own hand
[1:07:32] hath saved me
[1:07:35] god says with this big of a church
[1:07:38] you guys are going to get prideful
[1:07:41] so i've got to shrink your church
[1:07:43] i've got to make it smaller
[1:07:46] because this people has
[1:07:49] a tendency to get prideful whenever they
[1:07:51] get the victory
[1:07:53] i need a group of people that are humble
[1:07:55] here that are not going to take credit
[1:07:57] for the supernatural
[1:07:59] but will give all the credit to god
[1:08:02] so i've got to make the church smaller
[1:08:05] now how many would want to be a part of
[1:08:06] that
[1:08:08] and look look the the the the enemies
[1:08:10] north of them the enemies way out there
[1:08:12] they can see the enemy like the sand of
[1:08:14] the sea
[1:08:15] like the stars in the sky
[1:08:17] and now god that god comes down again
[1:08:18] and said your church is too big
[1:08:21] there's too much pride amen god may god
[1:08:23] drive all the pride out of our church
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:26] that we would never exalt and take any
[1:08:28] credit for what god has done like we
[1:08:30] could do it anyway like it was our
[1:08:32] goodness now god will use your obedience
[1:08:34] but you don't have the power yourself to
[1:08:36] do anything
[1:08:37] you only have authority
[1:08:40] we have no power of ourselves we only
[1:08:42] have authority to speak god's word but
[1:08:44] we only do it with god's leadership
[1:08:47] praise god
[1:08:53] a great lesson for us a great lesson
[1:08:55] and church just
[1:08:57] let me say this i've heard new i've
[1:08:59] heard it numerous times over the years
[1:09:00] it just made more real to me
[1:09:02] many times when churches build a new
[1:09:04] building they get prideful and brother
[1:09:06] bram even says it on tape
[1:09:08] remember i was telling you about you i
[1:09:09] was telling you about that uh
[1:09:12] that child abuse case up north remember
[1:09:13] that last week
[1:09:15] that happened just two or three years
[1:09:17] after they built the brand new church
[1:09:19] just to fit one thousand
[1:09:23] see because when you get exalted up and
[1:09:24] prideful
[1:09:26] what happens you get your eyes off of
[1:09:27] the lord you stop seeking the lord
[1:09:32] see that
[1:09:35] oh look
[1:09:36] think of the one i i preached at a
[1:09:38] church a few years ago down south
[1:09:40] built a brand new beautiful log cabin
[1:09:43] church
[1:09:44] where they stand today they've left the
[1:09:46] message today
[1:09:48] beautiful i mean their logo on their
[1:09:49] website is that log cabin church
[1:09:52] beautiful
[1:09:54] and just a few years after that
[1:09:56] leave the message
[1:10:00] it's quite quite striking
[1:10:03] what big numbers will do and remember
[1:10:04] we've been told here in the name of the
[1:10:06] lord god's protecting us by keeping us
[1:10:07] small
[1:10:09] i believe that is a protection
[1:10:11] praise god
[1:10:13] because we see in the scripture
[1:10:16] not not every case but in this case
[1:10:17] particular
[1:10:18] remember brother adam likens this story
[1:10:20] of gideon unto the rapture
[1:10:23] the man likens it under the rapture
[1:10:25] because it's a it's a thinning down like
[1:10:27] like the statue of a man it's a smaller
[1:10:29] group all the time smaller smaller
[1:10:30] smaller but god's going to do something
[1:10:32] great with this small group amen praise
[1:10:34] god
[1:10:36] the undefeatable enemy will be defeated
[1:10:38] by a small minority of holy ghost-filled
[1:10:41] believers amen
[1:10:42] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:10:49] church is too big
[1:10:52] too much pride in the church i've gotta
[1:10:55] i gotta slim down the church
[1:11:00] now let's review this real quick
[1:11:03] so far three times gideon had fear
[1:11:06] judges 6 15
[1:11:08] and he said oh my lord where wherewith
[1:11:10] shall i save israel behold my family is
[1:11:12] poor
[1:11:13] in manasseh and i am the least in my
[1:11:15] father's house so here's fear how am i
[1:11:17] going to do this
[1:11:21] judges 6 23 he has fear again and the
[1:11:24] lord sent him peace be unto you fear not
[1:11:26] thou shalt not die he was scared of his
[1:11:28] life
[1:11:30] scared scared he was going to die
[1:11:32] and then judges 6 27
[1:11:36] then gideon took 10 men of the servants
[1:11:38] and did as the lord had sent to him and
[1:11:40] it was so because he feared us he feared
[1:11:42] his father's household
[1:11:44] and that he did it by night
[1:11:46] fear constant fear of church isn't that
[1:11:48] what we do
[1:11:49] i remember when i first started youtube
[1:11:50] brother i was so afraid of the comments
[1:11:52] i was a i told my wife that i afraid
[1:11:54] they were going to like
[1:11:56] you know
[1:11:57] cut off my channel all these things and
[1:11:59] i was i was scared i was going to fend
[1:12:00] message people you know
[1:12:02] but i found out you can't offend the
[1:12:03] real holy ghost-filled saint praise god
[1:12:06] they might disagree with you but they're
[1:12:07] still going to love you
[1:12:08] amen that's what i found out praise god
[1:12:11] you just stand for the truth and god
[1:12:13] will stand with you amen you might stand
[1:12:15] alone but he shall be standing in the
[1:12:17] word in obedience in faith hallelujah
[1:12:20] so much fear
[1:12:25] sometimes there's fear to pray for the
[1:12:26] sick
[1:12:27] there's sometimes fear to uh
[1:12:30] which direction should i go in my life
[1:12:34] should i do this should i call this
[1:12:35] preacher or not you know we battle fear
[1:12:37] it's fear all the time so what's going
[1:12:39] to take that away communion with god
[1:12:42] talking with god asking god to guide me
[1:12:44] and direct me because i don't i don't
[1:12:45] even have i mean i have no ability to
[1:12:47] myself i need the leadership of the holy
[1:12:49] spirit praise god
[1:12:50] in other words what do you need humility
[1:12:54] because pride will always vault
[1:12:56] vaulteth the bible said vaunt is excel
[1:12:58] itself up it'll always puff itself up
[1:13:00] look how great i am
[1:13:04] and god's got to get all the pride out
[1:13:05] of the church god's got to get all the
[1:13:07] pride out and then god steps in and does
[1:13:09] something for his glory
[1:13:13] yes gideon was a man of faith
[1:13:16] he battled fear
[1:13:18] but he eventually overcame fear
[1:13:21] and next time lord willing will look at
[1:13:23] this preparation for battle
[1:13:26] gideon's got one more moment of fear
[1:13:28] left
[1:13:30] think about this he's heard from god
[1:13:31] over
[1:13:32] let's see seven eight nine ten times
[1:13:34] he's already heard from god
[1:13:35] church he's he heard audible voices
[1:13:39] he saw literal angels
[1:13:42] and yet he still battled fear
[1:13:45] do you think you're going to battle fear
[1:13:47] yeah
[1:13:47] but do you think the same god that was
[1:13:48] with gideon is with you
[1:13:50] yes because there's only one god
[1:13:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:13:54] forever aren't you glad god is with you
[1:13:57] musicians can come let's stand to our
[1:13:58] feet
[1:14:01] many great lessons in the life of gideon
[1:14:10] there's nothing wrong with asking god
[1:14:11] for a sign nothing but just make sure
[1:14:14] your heart's right first before you ask
[1:14:15] it
[1:14:18] make sure it's god's will first to go
[1:14:20] this direction
[1:14:23] and be willing to say lord if it's not
[1:14:25] your will
[1:14:26] that's fine i want god's will above all
[1:14:29] else
[1:14:33] hallelujah
[1:14:38] you know this would be a good night
[1:14:39] churches we're
[1:14:41] closing in prayer here
[1:14:43] let's pray for
[1:14:44] a need on your heart
[1:14:47] gideon was called to defeat this enemy
[1:14:49] what do you feel god calling you to do
[1:14:51] what do you need an answer from god on
[1:14:54] what would help you serve god better
[1:14:58] what would help you have more courage as
[1:14:59] a christian lord give me a sign if i
[1:15:01] just had this sign i could
[1:15:03] get more courage
