God Lord is so faithful Matthew 13 I just want to you know I just felt a little lead and I was studying more this weekend on the kingdom of heaven so I want to look at part three of the kingdom of heaven and Lord willing we'll look at the talents and the pounds okay is that on alright thank you Matthew 13 Matthew verse 11 I heard some really good reports you know Simon being here and appreciate everybody's support and everything I listened to the evening service I think it a chance I didn't make enough time I guess to listen in the morning but really enjoy the evening service has a tremendous blessing a great word there nice warning as well some really nice revelations there about the Nicolaitans spirit and also how to keep the right spear praise God that was really wonderful thank the Lord for that message that was a wonderful message even malachi was telling me about he's like daddy you got to listen to that message as a great mess i don't praise the lord son thank you sir matthew 13 11 let's read verse 11 together I know I don't do not have any quotes tonight so I apologize about that I went back to work this week so I had a lot less time to study but I said got to study a lot over the weekend you know flying to Iowan back I had quite a bit of study time so I thank the Lord for that Matthew 13 11 let's read just verse 11 on three one two three he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mystery kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given now verse 12 I'll read for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but who suffer hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath now go to Matthew 25:14 now while we're turning there I just had a scripture come to my mind I'm just typing in real quick so I'm gonna find it ok now the 25 will just read but I'll just read 14 and 15 for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his Goods and until one he gave five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey let's have a word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart let's just make it known unto God maybe raise your hand to heaven or bow your head to the earth Heavenly Father we love you tonight we're happy to be assembled Lord this is how we overcome the devil Lord God by coming to hear the preaching Lord cuz we know when we hear and believe the word it becomes a revelation and the gates of Hell will not prevail against the revelation of your word we're so happy what we receive tonight will never be taken from us Lord God it's an eternal deposit of the Almighty God Lord depositing his word his very life into our hearts minds and ultimately our character we thank you Lord bless your saints that pressed our way out to the house of God bless every effort Lord especially the mother's Lord bringing the children Lord God and those travelling far distances Lord and we just thank you for all the sacrifices minister to every need Lord God and I've known in my life the greater the sacrifice the greater blessing so father we just cling to your promise your Jehovah Jireh just provide every need tonight we'll give you the glory in Jesus Christ's name in Saint said Amen god bless you as you being seated there praise the Lord so I was reading the scripture here in Matthew 13 about the the kingdom of heaven verse 11 the scripture says it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given so I want to just take a thought just just briefly look at this you know if you if you know the scripture here in verse 10 Jesus is speaking to his disciples so this is a private conversation amongst Christ and the twelve because they came and said why do you speak unto them in parables and back Lidia back to verse 11 please huh and I remember the scripture I was looking for here okay yes there's I've to find in a minute here but we see here this thought it's given unto you so the disciples were predestinated to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given now remember this is a beautiful Scripture as shows election right and predestination but memmer don't forget foreknowledge God foreknew the disciples would want to hear it right even Judas wanted to hear at the beginning but he didn't go all the way at the end the Bible said he trotted underfoot the Son of Man and he smashed it with his foot and he left the Bible said he was sanctified but then he left the holy thing for the unholy thing in other words he was climbing the king's highway and he fell off but the Bible said but to them it is not given okay now this is the thought here I had in my heart here that that it's not as if God is just hiding it from him because he doesn't want it because he doesn't care about them you know the scripture I've been preaching it lately where God doesn't delight in the death of the wicked it's because of God's long-suffering and his love that he lets the time go on he's trying to save more Souls we know that and the scripture I'm looking up and maybe he can help me the Bible said Oh is a lack of knowledge that's the word lack yeah let's go to Hosea 4:6 sorry this is this kind of came to me right now so I just wanna look it up real quick Hosea 4:6 and keep in mind as we read this keep in mind where Jesus said it's not given to them because we want to understand this a lot of people read this first part to the the colon there and they stopped okay so let's look at this my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge so churches will use that and say so see they never heard before but that's not exactly what the scripture is saying the scripture saying my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge so that the the truth is Israel had heard the knowledge of God but they lacked the ability to obey it amen and so when Jesus says and keep it up they're little because we're gonna read the rest when Jesus said it to you it's given to them it's not given it wasn't as if Jesus was saying well you know they're not gonna hear it no they did hear it they just didn't want to believe it amen and that's what makes people accountable alright that's what makes the entire world accountable they'll hear about Christ they'll hear God sent a prophet they'll hear about miracles there he'll about here about revelations and they'll hear about the end times and the rapture right everybody hears about it the tribulation everybody knows about the tribulation almost everybody knows about it but see the reason they're destroyed is because they lack the knowledge in other words they rejected it when they heard it they turned it down and Jesus said it's like a seed that fell on the stony ground right it springs up for a while maybe they're interested but then a but then it gets it gets burned out by the Sun or maybe it falls on the side to the road and a bird comes up and eats the seed and Jesus said that Satan snatching the word out of their hearts amen he said because you rejected an ouch I'll also reject V that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou has forgotten the law so not only was it just rejection but they so much they so much rejected they forgot about it see I also forget thy children I what a striking thing nothing could hurt the Jews more than when God forsook their children but they were so Baxton and they didn't even realize well they didn't realize the judgment that were gonna come upon him and it would hurt their children so I hope that I hope this balances it out by God's grace I want I want to balance that out and make sure you understand that because it's something that was quickened to me recently I'd forgotten about that because I hear people say well we're destroyed for the lack of knowledge with either we don't know we don't know but that's not what God's saying God's saying you had a chance but you didn't act on it and so that brings responsibility to you and I that because we hear the message Church I hope everybody's listen on a live stream too because we've heard the message that means we're more responsible praise God that means we got to be more diligent with the things of God but what happens as I travel and I'm not this time aiiow what about travel to numerous places over the course of the last few years what I see amongst message people is they hear it but then they get complacent on God brother branham makes the statement I can't remember the sermon it's in but he says a log in the river rots twice as quickly as a row or as a log that's not in the river how many know what I'm talking about he said if you throw a piece of wood in the river you know right out faster because it's in the fresh water right the moving water if you just leave a log on the ground it's not gonna ride out as quickly and program said that's the date all right that's the that's the nothing danger but that's I guess it is the danger for the unbeliever that is the danger for the unbeliever who doesn't stay obedient and responsible with the Word of God praise God and so we have a greater responsibility as I travel more and more the last few years and see what I see I see more of that I see a lot of people that are wood chopped out but they're just rotting in the water but you and I can't rot we don't want to rot in the message we want to stay attached to the tree that's planted by rivers alone or amen but what happens is that people get complacent and they get read because they reject God's knowledge God in a sense kind of cuts them off we'd say now I'm not saying eternally cuts them off what I'm saying is like that message I preached a few years ago about the waters of separation Israel was a privileged people but if they let something die in their tents they were cut off from worship remember that nothing from numbers 19 if something died they had to wait three days after being sprinkled and then to wait four more days for a total of seven days before they could be purified and then after the seventh day they could go back to the house of God and worship but if they got lazy ungodly might lay out of church for a few weeks right they may it late they might lay out for a few months praise praise God no not a good thing but to help us with our understanding and so we understand that we've got to be responsible and that's what a lot of people who run away from in the message they don't want any responsibility they just want the pastor to do it or the deacon or the psalm leader or something like that but like brother BAM said God wants to be in the entire laity he's the God of the entire church not just the pulpit he wants the pulpit he wants the musicians he wants a deacon he wants that but he wants everybody praise God amen he wants to be feared by all the saints amen now if we could let's now let me take a pause remember a few weeks ago and I preached our time and seasons I think it was when Ray was here I remember when I showed the quotes about brother Branham when it was a time for him to be silent and his wife to him just be quiet I and then remember he had a vision after that and I told you I said I wonder what vision was I forgot to read that let me go back and read it to you because I did some research to dig it up I think you'll like it by God's grace so program he had a fever nine days and he missed all the meetings and he could hardly talk he's whispering and he sat down to meet emotion or over and said Mita sometimes I wonder I wonder what's the matter why would their meetings be there and God let me lay like this I said why was it I said sometimes I wonder if he even called me how many member now that I've read how many remember now so brother may have says I wonder if God's even called me to preach and this is a what years as 1960 April 1960 and Meeta said ain't you ashamed of yourself she just told me bill don't you know that God knows what he's doing with you just just be quiet so see this was a season for brother Branham to be quiet and not complain right and that question did God even called me to preach right you know already a picture taken with a pillar of fire you know it had tremendous meetings in India where half a million or thought well I'm sorry three thousand three hundred thousand people got saved or healed and then overall at this time I believe he had over half a million commerce to Christ already and then he's asking because of nine days of fever lord have even called me to preach how many can how many can relate to brother Branham and say sometimes in your darkest hours sometimes it gets it gets hard how many could say Amen now brother banner has a vision I'm gonna skip the vision because I'm gonna go to the interpretation to save time but Ram said I looked after he saw vision he said I looked and I seen something make a flicker over to one side I looked and there my wall opened up and I seen Jesus how many ever heard me say twice in my life in a vision I believed I would see him again before the end time seemed again and now I looked and the skies was right out there and I just looked like I looked through the wall and there was the Bible standing right like this the great big Bible standing in the skies there was something got light around the Bible and now the Bible come a real pretty golden cross and it stood out like this and the lights coming from all around it and out of that cross he walked so Jesus came out of the cross which came out of the Bible I like that the Holy Ghost come out of the word amen glory he said the Bible reflected the cross the cross reflected him and he come walking out and walked right down to eyes at I can see it just as plain I can see that cross reflecting his hair standing there hung down over his face he looked down at me like that he said you are waiting for your new ministry to be confirmed to you that was speaking the word or opening the seals the third bolt he said I've already confirmed it to you memory smoke squirrel six squirrels in existence had he who right had been spoken had given the spoken word it's already confirmed you've got to accept it he says and I sort of listen to him just a minute and it come into my mind I didn't hear that it just come into my mind like a man that's been a sinner all his life and he knows there's a Bible he knows there's a God but all at once he hears a sermon that something tells him it's you then that same word has been there all the time yet it's confirmed to him and then he says Lord forgive me but it won't do any good until he accepts his salvation then he goes out and is a Christian no matter how much he cries how much he begs he's got to accept it and he said to me Jesus said you've got to accept the third Pole the same way you've got to believe it Church I just wonder you know as we go along I wonder at what point we're gonna accept the the plan of God for our lives maybe you have already I'm just saying if you haven't there's got to come a time when you and I accept it there had to come a time when I accept the fact I'm a preacher I'm accepted the fact I'm a pastor I accepted the fact I'm a teacher I accepted the fact God heals the sick sometimes when I pray for them we've all got to come and accept the fact that God has a ministry for our lives and that we're willing to do it if he'll help us amen well the RAM said I'm afraid of defeat so look at him he's so honest he tells the people I'm scared of being defeated in the third poll can you imagine that God has another ministry form but he's scared to go into it I think that's pretty common right we know God has special gifts in our life but we're afraid to operate in them well tha have said anything I'm afraid I'll bring a reproach I'm always afraid of it watching think I'll call the wrong thing because I took warning of the Bible how that Moses was given great power and he smoked the rock instead of just speaking to it I remember Elijah because he went bald-headed them little children teasing him was about being bald-headed and he put a curse on those shirt and 42 of them killed by bears that wasn't the Holy Spirit it was a prophet angered I went through all those things coming to that and he stood there talking to me and he said now listen Jesus says but you walk with too many he said to walk with me now you finish the quote to walk with me you'll walk alone I thought maybe more people would finish it I'm sorry if you didn't know that quote but Jesus said to walk if you want to walk in the third Pole you can't walk with all these other people and I was gonna share it next its denominational people amen I don't know yeah to walk with Jesus you gotta walk alone now think about now think about the interpretation of brother and never left his family to walk alone he stay with his family he never left his church although Satan tried to get him to leave his church right to go up in the mountains when he had that when he had that C word complex sorry Satan try to get them do that but see what that he had to leave the influence of other men and only be influenced by the Holy Spirit well Graham said I had seen that in my life he said I had been catering too much to denominations and everything you see somebody trying to tell you what to do and what not to do look how humble our prophet is brother Aaron he can admit that he was catering to man more than God praise God now maybe he was just catering this much but he was he that was still that much a potential God could use to do great things in his life in ministry do we want to give 90% church or do we want to give a hundred percent how much do we want to give of our gifts how much how much do we want to really be influenced by all of Christ the word so God was showing brother brand this is 1960 he's 51 years old God showing him you can't even be influenced this much by denominational people now how about us for most of us it's not denominational people that's going to influence us it's family members or friends right or coworkers or mother message people that got a denominational spirit hey hallelujah and let me just share this part of the testimonies from the weekend on Sunday morning I preached at the church and I was preaching on Talent you know the white is deception red is murdering black is money and then fourth is spiritual death why just showed my my personal understanding of that how Satan's trying to get into message churches and he's trying to divide churches and get people divided and have people money-hungry the black horse rider but of course they kill the pastors influence first they kill the pastors influence they take their own tithes and offerings and they separate themselves build their own Kingdom and then they die spiritual death in church I didn't even know it but brother Brooks told me afterwards there's a passer sitting on the front row that had done that to him and it was just a clear sign that God was discerning the life now looking back now I can see he was a little nervous I was preaching but I didn't know that you know I wasn't aware of that but now it's up to brother Brooks and those those to follow up and see if they can follow up and try to get that fixed the night before at the other church we were preaching and God did another discernment I had called up a brother on the front row over here and I called him up and I kind of did an illustration with him about Jesus and his talents and I said brother if Jesus said to you what have you done with the talents I gave you have you been faithful and everybody the church knew that he had talents he wasn't devoting to the Lord so after church he come up he fell on his knees in the back office saying brother Jesse brother Brooks pray for me that was God speaking to me tonight because he the he'd left off I'm not going to tell the details but he left off some of his talents cuz there was some sin in this family you know his wife had left him and different things like that but his wife had come back and he wasn't investing in his talents because of some things that had happened but he recognized that I called him out it's almost like a brother man in a sermon line of course but it wasn't I'm not a prophet I'm not trying to claim I'm a prophet what I'm saying this Holy Spirit is the spirit of discernment the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen so it lets us know when that happens the words here amen the Holy Spirit's here hallelujah because he discerns him so see he tells him now get back to us to walk with me you'll walk alone that doesn't mean you abandon your family doesn't mean you abandon your job but you stop being influenced by what other people say and you only take the word the Rev said I've been catering too much to denominations but see you've got to follow him now remember the vision that he gave me about the fish as you know and how that you couldn't teach supernatural signs the Pentecostal babies you remember that there it is and right at the brim of the new message so what was it brother Branham had tried to explain the first two poles to the the preachers remember that and brotherman said it caused a major impersonation praise God it caused preachers to go up and stomp their feet and saying I smell Devils because brother Branham could look in his hand he could look at his hand on the first pole and he could see the type of disease it was well when brother Han tried to explain these things people start impersonating it so then people started saying I smell devil or I hear a devil she would smash the brew different little things that would that kind of made it seem like they were more spiritual and the angel said you should not have tried to explain that to the preachers now to me brothers and sisters it's not thought my thought but it looks like he was kind of casting pearls before swine maybe that's kind of what it looks like to me because remember we all fall short of the glory God but member of course God forgives the Prophet and member every bride member there's no condemnation in there in Christ Jesus God will make everything in the permissive will work out to the perfect will because everybody's got to make mistakes except Christ amen so see just as God was merciful to David just as God was merciful to Paul just as God forgave Moses for killing a man and Paul for holding the jacket when receiving God's own God forgive brother Brandon God will forgive you and I the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of our sins amen no more than the vision left me I said amen Lord and my wife was standing there almost fainted and I jumped up out of the bed now remember he's got a fever nine days in a row and I could talk as good as ever I ever did so his fever left him and the problem with his throat the the cracked voice or the lost voice and left him he said just in a second every bit of the fever left me showing I said I like free look at me he said what I say come over there looking at me look through those sinuses said tell me what happened brother branham I said you believe my story he said how could I doubt it it's happened I said that's it that's it friend listen God knows how to hold you on an ash heap he knows how to do something for you until he can get the message over to you see to get you to do something and the Church said sometimes search we wonder why we struggle in life right wonder why is this struggle so long why is this now this was nine days he missed preaching opportunities he missed campaigns he missed special meetings why God was trying to get to see you've got to walk alone you cannot be influenced you can't try to explain some of these things to these these people don't try to explain it just stay true to the word praise God so church of Parana ash-heap sorry there's a net in here he said he said if your honor a sheep river going through a difficult time the thing to do is hang on to God don't doubt your calling don't doubt what God's already done for you but try to stay strong and try to see what God's trying to teach you so you can do something many times it's something we're not doing God's trying to open our eyes listen to the sermons especially close to that time because God wants us to do something praise God see brother God want to program to do something to not doubt the third Pole and to stay away from being influencing or influenced by the denominational trying to just don't try to explain how God does everything just explain the word Amen Alleluia so I hope that's helpful you know there's one thing praying about I'm not going to share the details there's one thing I'm praying about perhaps maybe God's got me on a sheep on a certain area in my life so I want to I want to be aware of that and I'm praying about it to see what what the Lord will do and I I told my wife about it just as a witness so that if something comes to pass soon we'll know it was the Lord I'll know was the Lord okay now let's go to Matthew 25 hope that was a blessing remember I told you and I remember some of the Saints were here I told you I wanted to go back and read what vision was that what vision did he have why did God allow brother Branham to get sick like that it was because he was catering too much denominational people explaining too much and he had to walk more alone with God Matthew 25:14 all right now I read this for our text so the kingdom of heaven what is the kingdom of heaven the baptism of Holy Ghost so this is for people that are born again into the kingdom of heaven it's as a man traveling in a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods now notice again whose money whose goods are they is it the servants or is it the rich man rich man so as we start looking at this and these these series are going to overlaps the purpose series and the Kingdom of Heaven series they're gonna overlap a little bit as we look at talents and your purpose in life and things like that if you have a supernatural gift it's God's gift not yours and God puts a great value on spiritual gifts it's a very valuable thing I'll show you the value in a little bit according to John Gill the English Protestant minister of the 1800s but look at verse 15 so he delivered unto them as Goods and he unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one it's every man according to several ability and straightway took a journey so God by foreknowledge says well this person's gonna have a greater ability I'm gonna give this person a greater ability because of their love for me because their desire so I'm going to them five talents and he says this one there have a still great desire I'm gonna give them three years it to two talents and they says this one I'm gonna give them I know their desire I'm gonna give them one talent because remember he bases everything not by but romances not by his desire does he predestinate but by his foreknowledge amen hallelujah now before yeah before I get to some quotes let me read you the value so John John Gill the Protestant preacher he tells us one talent and I'll use gold because it's just it's a better teacher it gives you a better idea one talent of gold from the Bible was equivalent to 375 English pounds of silver or 4,500 pounds of gold so I'm just gonna use gold to convert these there's a website you can use and you can convert pounds from the 1770s when John Gill was alive those English pounds you can convert to convert those to US dollars so let me say this the one talent Christian had eight hundred sixty thousand or about a million dollars okay so each tale it's about a million dollars the two talent preacher had about 1 million seven hundred thousand dollars or about two thousand we'll just run it up and the five tail it had four million three hundred thousand we'll just round up to five thousand I'm sorry five million okay so does that give you an idea Church about how valuable the gifts of God in your life are if you have to get them knowledge right if you have faith all these things and you should have seen some of the faces when I preached on that I had numerous people cry no even because they knew they weren't investing in the gifts got to given them and I've seen tremendous testimonies but currently they weren't investing in them or it ought to make us real sober right it ought to make us up a little bit and shake us a little bit and say God has given me a lot of money spiritually amen he's giving you a lot of money naturally too but forcing got a lot of big bills but it's the spiritual money that's most valuable praise God so a one talent preacher has about equivalent of 1 million dollars a to talent preacher 2 million 5 talent 5 million and he's got to invest that preaching gift he's got to go trade it he's got to go out and invest in it amen he's gonna go out and preach the gospel amen I think you'll like him about talent but Ram said in 1950 he said I believe that gifts and callings are without repentance you're born here in the world with these gifts just the same as you're born to be a musician you might give your child give it all kinds of lessons but if that musical talent isn't in it it'll debt never do no more good is that right but we're born the same way in the spiritual realms for gifts and callings of God are without repentance ok so I know different people that have taken piano lessons not in our family but other lessons and it doesn't do them any good you can give them less than after lesson and it's never gonna do any good that's because they don't have a talent from God but if somebody has a talent it'll start to manifest there's a gift there right like I've had people come up even when before Malachi was playing piano I had people come up and look at him when he's first hour playing said he's anointed of the Holy Spirit in fact he was brother ray his brother ray the first time mother I heard you play Malachi he said he's anointed he's anointed and yeah we gave Malachi lessons but at some point there's a time when the the gift started just manifesting itself the interest was there the effort was there the desire was there praise the Lord the next quo said dreams and singing our gifts from God he said what about a man who doesn't dream a dream his subconscious would be way back way back at the wall he never gets to it he sleeps around nothing alarms him now he can't help because he doesn't dream a dream and neither can this one help because he does dream a dream what do people what a few people that dreams dreams if you say dream me a dream you couldn't do it it's impossible somebody know what he's saying even if you have a gift you can't force it to operate if you have a gift of dreaming you should have saw in Iowa I asked both churches how many people have had a dream come to pass there was like five to ten people in each church and I told them that's the spirit of prophecy we always wonder where is the spirit of prophecy how come people are prophesied well how many people are praying to prophesy how many people are consecrated so God can trust them with a consecrated dream very few I didn't get a whole lot of amens on that and I hope because a lot of people are not dedicated or diligent with their gifts and our church said like I asked them how many you pray over the gift and said God increased my gift no hey maybe one hand went up out of all those people so God has given them like two million dollars or a million dollars and there let it set in there under the mattress right there let me just lay there I mean the least you could do is give it to a bank and least you'll get a couple hundred dollars every month at least you could do put it in a CD account right or put it in a give it to the banker let him take your money you know give it good increase good interest you and I must not bury our gifts in the world like this we must not bury them in the fear in a message Church we've got to invest in them we've got to not be afraid we've just got to cut off any other voice and just hear the voice of Christ hey man hallelujah but how many people want to be responsible for the talent very few programs so the reason Jesus doesn't Marrs because he can't trust people with it because he knows their life they're not very dedicated to it so he's not gonna send more gifts and more operation because they're not dedicated to it they'll get off the mark st. no slip in there and it'll become a hindrance rather than a benefit I don't want to be a benefit for the kingdom of God I want my preaching to be a benefit that's why I got in the closet this morning that's why I try to get in there every morning I try to lay here at the altar I want to be a blessing I want God to speak if I speak no one's help but if God speaks everybody's blessed hey man I got a humble myself though I got a belittle myself that Christ might be magnified in me he said now God made you so you dream a dream if you're a seer he made the other ones so he did not dream a dream but a seer or prophet is not something laid hands on and wished him over him a prophet a prophet is born from birth gifts and callings of God without repentance God told Jeremiah before you is even formed in your mother's womb I knew you and sanctified you ordain your prophet to the nation's see it's without repentance now the man who dreams the dream can't help it the man who doesn't dream a dream can't help it but a seer his subconscious is neither back there neither is it here it's right here he doesn't go to sleep he just breaks from one dimension to the other wide awake he can't help it he can't do that on his own will it's God but if you're giving a gift and don't use it for the glory of God then God's going to make you answer for it at the Day of Judgment now Church that's the white throne judgment and the church said but Rev says if you don't use your gift you're gonna answer the day judgment that's not that's not that's not the judgment seat of Christ that happened some time after the marriage supper or some time after I'm sure that's not that that's the white throne judgment other words the people that don't invest in their gifts are not born again and that's the reality of it because that's what brother man says plainly the people that go off and bury their gift in the world are the ones that are gonna go in the tribulation not know about you but that that puts a lot of seriousness and ruther Brooks called it sobering he said these were sobering sermons that makes a lot of us it should make us very serious about the things of God he says please without any reflection I hear on the radio when I'm in the middle part of the country here man named mr. Foley I believe they call him by a slur name or given name red red Foley he sang a piece here I hear not long ago called peace in the valley what a marvelous voice but what's he using for it God will require that so red Foley was a worldly singer but he's like Elvis he would convert over collect I don't want to call names yet kind of like Amy Grant huh me no Amy Grant is it me no Amy Grant no one okay she was a famous woman in the 80s I grew up listening nursing about thy word is a lamp unto my feet is a beautiful song well around 1980 or 91 or 92 converted over like Christian Christian singers do today from Christian to mainstream in church I was in fifth grade and I remember I bought her cassette tape when she crossed over and that's when I left God I was memorizing the Bible in fifth grade I was going to a Bible Camp memorizing Scripture but as soon as I bought that filthy music I'll stop memorizing the Bible and that's when I left God right there oh it just struck me and then when I got baptized and got saved even before the message the first thing I did sister Beatrice was throw away all my worldly music so I came back where I left him amen Abraham had to come back where he left God at the same altar Peter had to come back to a fire because that's where he left Christ and a fire with the maid so had to come back to a fire and that's where he got right with God and Jesus said do you love me he said I love you more than these you know my heart Lord that's right now thank you lord bye thank you Jesus so from fifth grade I'll just say like this to 13th grade Wow eight years uh thank the Lord so I ran from God for eight years I came back to the place I left him worldly music MA praise the Lord I think I'll share that for a testimony now program said we had a Stewart Hamblin that was converting our brother Billy Graham's meeting out California movie star god bless him and he let him write a song to record there's no secret what God can do honey remember that song there is no secret what God can do what he's done for others he'll do for you but RAM said which taken the first place and all of our songs in the nation beautiful one many to Christ God makes us answer for our talent praise God so boat ramps talked about dream so far he's talked about singing what was the other one did I skip one oh and music yeah music alright yeah that's right so singing in music so far now brother Graham tells us when Moses had this thick and God said use what's in your hand that was Moses his talent and brother Ram said the boy that came to Jesus and gave us lunch that lunch was his talent okay so I'm just giving you some different quotes in other words Romero says whatever's in your hand give it to Jesus right whatever your whatever you're doing give it to Jesus and Jesus will bless it amen so of course Moses was a ministry of being a shepherd right so he went from shepherding natural sheep to shepherd in God's he baby that was in his hand amen I don't know about the boy with the fish I'm not sure about that we don't know much about his life maybe the only thing that we know about him all right Bertram's talking about a boy who sang silent night at one of his services and he said did you have a music lesson and didn't even know what a music lesson was and brother branham said he picked up a pipe one day and he blow the star-spangled banner without one practice can you imagine picking up a flute and playing the star-spangled banger oh say can you see the rest of the boy just saying that he played star-spangled banner' and he sang silent life he said that boy don't need a music lesson he was born that way he don't need lesson it's just a gift and now you hear these singers come on the air these fellows with different ones I don't want to mention their names in public become millionaires in a week's time just singing two songs he said America has become full of Bali Bali whoo and all kinds of programs so even the other nations laugh at us for our nonsense he said it's just somebody cracked jokes or some sing some song no doubt these fellows women are good singers they're gifted people but you know what God will make them answer for what they do at that talent that's right they better be using it for the kingdom of God that's true whatever we have let's use it for the kingdom of God's sake every town we have let's put it in the kingdom of God hallelujah now this is a good one let me see how much further I should go all right now in this quote this is from earnestly contending for the faith 1954 when I was talking about how birds sing member how he sang the song birds in the sky sing but was that brother Mannis talking about how birds worship the Lord he said that's the gospel preached in bird language did you know that he said that the birds were preaching the gospel every time they sing they're preaching to the birds he said oh I'm sorry no brother I said the birds are preaching the gospel to us praise the Lord that's what he says maybe that's what the birds are doing when they're singing like that preaching the gospel to us in bird language I think of a chickety chickety chickety chickety that's the gospel now let me go to the next paragraph him he said now you when you hear our brother and those birds like that that is a spiritual gift I'm out singing try to impersonate it once and see how you get along in other words one of you tonight trap and come up and and close the service on piano who'd like to do it who'd like to personate Malachi tonight who'd like to do it anybody I didn't think so which EU men would like to come up here and try to impersonate the sermon tonight or the young men we only got two sorry don't mean to point you out or anything but I'm just saying like when it's a gift of God like I heard a preacher say you know give give one man all the quotes in the scriptures see what he'll do with it and then give a gifted man quotes in scriptures see what he'll do with it well we see that all the time when people people for each peach of sorry when people preach false doctrine sorry peach I had a peach yesterday when people preach false doctrine that's what happens many times those people aren't called to preach sometimes they are if they're right many times in the then Satan to seize them and they get off in a false doctrine that caused a lot of sin and evil immorality and lust and things like that then Satan just got in and perverted the gift but if they never really get a good anointing then they work hard of God to preach because they're just impersonating it because God will come and back it up he said that gift was in and when he was born the gift was another man when he was born now it's interesting - I never thought I'd be a pastor but because I was a successful athlete every time we had an assembly to celebrate our victories they always hand the microphone to me it's like brother Aaron the whole time they were telling me you're the spokesman you're the spokesman I'm like I don't want to talk why you calling me to talk why don't he when I was 17 years old when I wasn't even the leader of the team I can see God was trying to prepare me to be a pastor now he says this he says but what they use their gifts for is what goes every man will have to answer first Talent God gives men tell and they have to use it some can preach like a house on fire and other different things but God requires these talents and I'm so thankful to know that these two brethren sitting back there have used their talents which they could be out there in night clubs and everything else are using those sounds but they surrender them to the Lord Jesus Christ to win souls and I'm happy for that this morning and my brother and may the Lord ever continue he said the little brother they are the song leader brother Coble many others hear God has give you a talents of song leaders maybe you say well brother brand he hasn't given me nothing now watch what brother man would say if someone would come up and say God didn't give me any talent watcher Bill Graham says he says you don't know maybe you just may go try something maybe you've never went out and tried to testify to somebody praise God he try that amen someone that says I already know anything Iran said go try and testify to somebody go try and tell about the things God has done for you he said everybody can't do that how many believing programs right now everybody can witless like brother Simon I used to feel bad when I could have witnessed like brother Simon but I'm not brother Simon you know he's small like that but he's got he's got the heart of a lion he don't he's not scared of anybody I've seen him go up and witness the guys way bigger than me he's something else that you could do he says there's something that you can do that you can put it to God but now the thing you have to do is do what the brother do what the brother sing in his song yield amen so the thing you've gotta do to find your gift is yield in other words to let the Holy Spirit have his way like Malachi had to yield I had to tell me okay Marik I need to play every service member that Malachi you need to play every service I've been trying to get Liddy to yield to Lydia play the piano she's got a little gift there hope it's okay that I use you I know you love me I love you too well but see with and there's a time and season for every gift so remember that there was a time and season for every gift but see that's all we've got to do is yield to what the Holy Spirit's trying to gently push us to do he's trying to lead us to do it praise God what's God trying to get us to do yield to him say yes Lord okay I'll obey program goes on to say this that the man who could whistle by man calls whistling a gift of God whistling a man who could whistle and personally all the birds had ever lived well then that man yield himself to give in to it the man who could sing he yield himself he give in to now for these things here of the gospel of the manifestation of visions I just yield myself and give into it and that's what does it so it's not me it's him and it's something that you can't help the man can't help because he was born to whistle like birds why he's just he was born that way the man that sang was the same way to see visions is just as common to me as it is to them to whistle so you see what I mean now it's all together it's for one edification of the glory of Jesus Christ the Son of God here's another one from was this the same same year but may have said I was sitting back with brother would just a few moments ago and a certain little fellow that's been around the church for a long time it wasn't Brotherhood if somebody else he's always one to find his place now how many can say amen to that you've always wanted to find your place I believe I could tell him if he just do it program says it's singing brother temple so now he names a brother temple brother temple had a gift of singing about Rams like I could tell you it's singing you might do one thing in another but you're you're a good singer I sure appreciate that if you would just turn yourself loose to singing God would use you to see how a lot of people program could even see in his church people have gifts they just don't do it you just got to turn yourself loose and do it that's what God wants us to do turn ourselves loose and do it for the glory of God try it try it praise God he says but you're around over everything else but the right thing get in the singing there is your talent you have to use that wonderful I like that old-time singing don't you yes sir to hear that that way like that brother Neville I sure do Oh hallelujah you have to use the talents God gave you and if you're not sure it's because you haven't tried enough how about that oh well that's the court I'm going to use in the future I don't have any gifts I don't know what God's called me do well what have you tried have you tried whistling have you tried singing have you tried testifying to your neighbor about the Lord have you tried preaching have you tried praying for a sick person when they're sick up here you say well how do I know they're sick well the next time let me know I'll let you know when there's a sick person I'll call you up to pray for them let's see if God moves on your behalf just turn yourself loose to singing God would use you so I had to make a decision am I going to turn myself loose to preaching or not I had turned myself loose to praying for the sick or not we often make that decision are we going to turn ourselves loose praise God all right let me find a place to close here give me about five or ten more minutes here set a timer alright let me head back here to this document here alright so let's look at this let's go back to the town so we'll finish with that one now if you were in Matthew 25 just turn back one chapter to Matthew 24 verse 1 unless you can pull it up here let's look at this now in this particular context Jesus is actually only talking to his disciples so the only ones that heard the parable of the talents was the disciples which is good especially for preachers right preachers need to know some preachers have one talent like me and then some got two and then some got five I'm sorry I only got a one-town but I'm trying to invest all I can't do it amen to that hallelujah I've done everything I can do to invest in it study more pray more write books meditate pray make videos I'm driving everything I can do to invest in this gift amen we look at 24 good Lydia thank you and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for show him the the buildings of the temple next verse and Jesus on them see not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down now verse 4 that it can I'm sorry verse 3 and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what should be the sign of thy coming and the 4:25 they all answer those questions praise God hallelujah so now do you understand when Jesus told the talents there's a bunch of jealous preachers can you imagine sitting there a few days later they'll be arguing well I'm greater I've got five no you you sit out I've got five because the Bible said they were arguing just a few days before Christ was crucified it was right along the time the fig tree was cursed like that's like a week less than a week there are you saying I'm a five talent preacher you know what look at you did you hear about my meetings over there and Cappadocia or whatever you know I'm just making up Tyree did you hear about the meetings I had in Tyree I'm a 5-2 and a preacher bro brother they're arguing who is greater now that was after this parable so they come to Jesus quietly when will these things be now if we look at the parable of tails which question is it answering is it the question of when shall the stones be cast down no is it the question of what should be the sign of thy coming yes and watch to me the sign of the end of the world kind of with the with the one talent preacher okay so it's kind of both of those because they're so close together right cuz my man and the Bible tells us I think they're they're tossed out into outer darkness I think if I'm not mistaken okay so now head over to chapter 25 so now we got the understanding of this and I love this because program said the pastor's job I'm just it's my job to tell you what's in the Bible I don't have to prophesy I'm to speak in tongues I'm going to do all the miracles I got to do my gifts but one of my most important gifts as a pastor is to tell you what the Bible says they aim ahead I had a brother out there in Iowa said he said I like watching your sermons he said how do you know all those scriptures I said well I just study uh all the time it's just God's gift it's not me it's just he's now like hearing you because you actually mentioned a lot of verses you know where a lot of verses are found I said well that's just because it's God's gift it's not I don't take any credit it's just I'm trying to invest in the gifts God gave me now 25 verse 14 we read 14 and 15 Jesus goes on a journey right now the kingdom of heaven is like a rich man most of us are pretty familiar with this now verse 16 then he that had the I'm sure I had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two but he that received one went and digged in the earth and hid his Lords money now who's that Judas right because there's 12 preachers around and Jesus saying I've given each of you talents some have more than others say hey man you remember Peter got all upset but I already said he said well what Jesus what about John it's John gonna be here till you see the Lord's coming anyone Jesus say don't worry about me I'm sorry don't worry about John follow thou me remember that don't worry about John remember jesus said John he said some are standing here that will not taste death till they see the Lord's appearing and Peter thought oh well what do you mean John gets to live to the rapture and Jesus said don't worry about John preached the word Peter amen in other words don't worry about other people's gifts and callings worry be concerned about investing in the talents God gave you amen he knew there be some jealousy amongst preachers god help us god help us all so Judas is the one who went and buried his Lords money in the earth because he forsook his bishopric the Bible calls it a bishop prickers which is like in a position of a bishop as an apostle verse 19 and after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and recognized with him and so he had received the five talents came and brought other five talents saying Lord thou delivers unto me five tales behold I came beside them five talents more his Lord said to him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I'll make the rule many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord he also that received two talents came and said Lord thou delivers unto me two talents behold I've gained two other talents beside them his Lord sending him well done good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord verse 24 then he which had received the one talent came and said lord I knew that thou were in a hard man reap now has not sown and gathering where there hast not straw now did you ever noticed this this is the lie this isn't true is God unjust is God is God imp I'm sorry is God partial no gods impartial so see the servant has a wrong attitude about Christ and his words the Bible said your words we either justify you or your words will condemn you how could it be a hard man when he just gave you a million dollars ain't head he's a loving man he gave you a million of his dollars dollars he gave you a precious gift to say case you Tamra gotta use that million dollars for the kingdom of God now as we get older Haman will start seeing yours Karras was our seein yours but it's just I'm just recognizing the gift maybe you can play piano way better than other people because it's just a gift but that doesn't mean you get complacent or you don't practice it with it that means your practice harder that means you focus more that mean you give yourself to where you see God blessing your life amen you give yourself wholly to that because you can see God's hand in it praise God and Lydia you got a real sense of sensitivity to the Holy Spirit you do you got a gift in that air I don't know if that's a gift of discernment or remember when you come up praying for the Holy Ghost and then who had God at that very day that's a gift like you felt you felt the presence of Lord you thought it was near got some type of uh because not everybody felt that that day I didn't feel so there's there's a gift there's there's something God invested with you he gave you something when you were born maokai you were given the town to play when you were born probably maybe some other things acacia sing you were given the town to sing I think you know that don't you you were because I'll try to sing like you I can't do it well Ram said try to impersonate at them if you think you can do it if it's so easy do it right so see this is a lie God is not a hard man now has got a fair man has got a strict man yes but he's not hard and he doesn't reap where it in so amen he's faithful he's true he's fair he's just he only reaps where he sews amen God's not a thief God's not gonna take something that doesn't belong to him he's a he's an honest man but this servants got some bad attitudes here he's got some false doctrine praise God sorry there was my time verse 25 and I was afraid see what did this what caused it to happen the spirit of fear so the man took the spirit of fear rather than the spirit of the Holy Ghost fear will make you bury your talents in the things of the world and that's why brother sister that's why I know all the people that really love our church we'll listen tonight even if they're not here and all the people that are really dedicated will listen to this and they'll hear this and the reality is that those that really love God they want to invest in the gifts that they're given and they want to be the dedicated ones but the that don't want to be dedicated they might have a spirit of fear or they might just not be born again so let me say like this if you're not currently investing in a gift then it's time to get down to the business with God some say God I don't want to be afraid I don't have the wrong attitude I don't want to think God in and give me something listen the Bible said he gave every servant something amen you've got something I've got something we've all got something now we got to find out what is it amen if you don't know try something try it amen try it do it amen there's something try it of course pray first don't do anything without praying first before I went to preach I told you this but I think I fasted two days out of the week before I preached for brother Brooks and I asked God give me a sign and before I even before I even took my text a sister Karen Sanders gave like a word a knowledge and she basically told what I was going to preach before I even stepped to the pulpit and then at the end of the sermon the whole the entire pulpit area was filled with people weeping and crying and repenting my very first sermon in Lima and then it happened the same way twice in a row that's so God gave me two witnesses and I've always hung on to that brother Aaron that see I put God to the test I prayed him fasted I said God if you want me to preach to prove it to me he proved it to me I don't doubt it anymore although some sermons are more annoying to than others it doesn't matter the same Holy Ghost is still here every service amen and if we're obedient than God's blessing us amen there's times to water church and there's time to plant but God gives the increase I know you're not every service is not every day out there is a harvest is it now it's beautiful during the summer [Music] over there we can go there at the beginning I forget when we get to begin lettuce at the beginning brought to the garden a few weeks later blueberries when we get out of the garden this week Tomatoes we got peaches this week I love it but this is the harvest season amen but there's a different season for every harvest praise God same thing true with these gifts not invest in them pray first before you do something seek my advice or seek seek see God's leadership and then invest in them but see the reason message people a lot of them don't invest in the kingdom of God they don't know their gift because they're afraid to fail we are fair but rancid I'm always a failure but God never fails amen see and like like we said last week the reason they don't they don't pray enough they don't pray enough they don't obey enough they don't fast enough hello they don't give alms enough see they're too selfish they're too self-centered so how can God use them to help other people when all they worry about is their self gifts are not for you they're for somebody else how can God use some of our gifts if we're always looking at me me me no I'm not saying people here I'm saying just anyone who's listening or anyone the message I'm not really poor I'm not pointing out anybody right I don't know where people's lives are but I'm saying our church needs to not be afraid if we're letting the Holy Spirit we're praying we need to try and find what God's called us to do on this earth because listen you are gonna stand before Christ I'm gonna stand before Christ and he's gonna say Jesse Smith what did you do with them talents I gave you now that's a makes me want to cry cuz that's so serious what did you do with it now to me that that that makes you want to go pray right now that makes you want to go study tonight you know because I don't want to be negligent I don't want to be lazy with the money he gave me never understand I was afraid I went and hid thy preaching gift your Apostle gift in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine his Lord answered and said to him that wicked sea is wicked you think God steals from people he said that's wicked Jesus doesn't steal from anybody amen now wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i so see you thought you knew this about me you did it it's not true verse 27 now artists therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury take therefore the tale from him and give it to him that hath ten talents verse 29 front every one that hath shall be given but he that shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath and caste the unprofitable servant into outer darkness see there's the tribulation there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth that sin to our feet here Lydia pull up one more scripture here first Corinthians 12 31 I am NOT going off the balance I'm not going off the deep end tonight but just breathe the scripture covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show i unto you a more excellent way now we all battle coveting right we covet cars sometime gonna see a new car and mine's got rust all over I think boy be really nice to have a new car not the van my other little car we all battle coveting right we want a house or we want a money or you want to a spouse or something like we want something that's not ours it's somebody else's but here's one of the few times in the Bible God said it's okay to covet okay - what what somebody else has in other words you want to see God use what somebody else has I want to see God use the song leader on Sunday I want to see God use the brother that speaks in tongues on Wednesday night I want to see God use the preacher on Sunday morning I can't wait oh I really wanted to seek somebody healing on Sunday morning is there anything wrong with that Church anything wrong with it no as long as you know the greatest the more excellent way is being born again as long as you don't turn this into all gifts are greater than the Holy Ghost baptism not true I don't think we'll ever do that here Church if we do I'm in a big trouble on the day judgment I'm in big trouble I don't think we'll ever do that here nothing is greater than the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal of God - the day of your Redemption but if you've got that then this is your next this is your next move and all this means is you want to come and you want to see God move in our services that's what that means you covet earnestly the best gifts now what is the best gifts we know wisdom is the best gift program says also prophesies a great gift because it blesses everybody can you imagine ounces I'm gonna say I announce tonight and I said thus saith the Lord Benjamin Austen I'm not saying that let's say Benjamin Austen will return by the end of this year and give their
