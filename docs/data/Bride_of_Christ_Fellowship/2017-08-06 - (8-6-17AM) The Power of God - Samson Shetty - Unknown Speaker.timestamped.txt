[57:41] said for I not ashamed of the gospel of
[57:43] Christ for it is the power of God it is
[57:48] the power of God unto salvation to
[57:50] everyone that
[57:52] believeth amen amen hallelujah the
[57:55] gospel of Christ is the power of God
[57:58] Amen and Paul also said that for our
[58:01] gospel came not unto you in the word
[58:04] only but also in the power and in the
[58:07] Holy
[58:08] Ghost a brother asked me from Australia
[58:11] in when he came to India in 2012 Brother
[58:15] Gary Walker he asked me brother Samson
[58:17] can I can I bring anything from uh can I
[58:20] bring anything to you from Australia I
[58:22] said brother you just bring the the word
[58:26] with the power and the demonstration of
[58:29] the Holy Ghost you know what brothers
[58:31] and sisters he came amen he came and we
[58:36] had a a wonderful tremendous services
[58:39] and that morning evening uh eight
[58:42] conventions uh oh brother sister the
[58:45] power of God came down in a such a
[58:48] wonderful way a supernatural way you
[58:51] know in the daytime even the the the the
[58:54] you know the outside it was very hot but
[58:57] the sun you know was very hot and and
[59:00] and and and the cloud
[59:03] appeared and stood over our
[59:06] tent praise the Lord and we felt the
[59:09] Cool Breeze coming through our sides and
[59:12] we experiened the power of God 200
[59:15] people coming in the prayer line
[59:16] everybody got healed cancer gone
[59:20] tuberculous is gone oh everybody got
[59:23] healed because that's the power of the
[59:27] Gospel the gospel came not by the word
[59:30] only but by the spirit of God but by the
[59:34] demonstration of the Holy Ghost so
[59:36] that's why Peter and John said silver
[59:38] and gold is not with us but whatever we
[59:42] have we will give unto you rise up and
[59:45] walk amen That Shook him that shook his
[59:49] legs That Shook him and he started
[59:52] jumping he started walking he started
[59:54] running what is that
[59:56] that is not only the word but also the
[1:00:00] power and the demonstration of the Holy
[1:00:04] Ghost Hallelujah these signs shall
[1:00:07] follow them that believe and God
[1:00:11] identified God you know established his
[1:00:14] word by the signs and wonders and
[1:00:18] miracles
[1:00:20] hallelujah amen and amen so that's why
[1:00:23] Paul said for the Our Gospel came not
[1:00:26] unto you in the word only but also in
[1:00:30] the
[1:00:32] power and in the Holy Ghost when the
[1:00:35] Holy Ghost fall upon you when the Holy
[1:00:38] Ghost come upon you you shall receive
[1:00:40] the power you will receive the power we
[1:00:44] will receive the power the power to
[1:00:48] overcome the darkness the power to
[1:00:51] overcome this world to uh uh the power
[1:00:55] to overcome for
[1:00:58] ourselves there are two things that
[1:01:00] cause Christians to go into error there
[1:01:03] are two things Jesus said not knowing
[1:01:06] the scriptures and not knowing the power
[1:01:09] of God Jesus said you do ear not knowing

[1:32:36] this a big big big big city and there
[1:32:39] are many souls are dying without knowing
[1:32:41] Christ the word Christ they don't if you
[1:32:44] tell about the Christ they see they show
[1:32:45] you a picture that's not not only the
[1:32:47] picture you know the Christ is the
[1:32:49] anointed word of this hour many people

[1:32:54] anointed word of this hour and God is
[1:32:57] going to raise you up Hallelujah with
[1:32:59] the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:04] hallelujah that's right that's the thing
[1:33:07] it takes humility humbling ourselves
[1:33:11] before God and letting God just work
[1:33:14] through us don't have to make a lot of
[1:33:17] noise
[1:33:19] Hallelujah and here brother sometimes
[1:33:22] sometimes as the farmer said he went out
[1:33:24] to the field with his wagon and every
[1:33:27] time it hit a bump it just rattled and
[1:33:31] went
[1:33:33] on if there is nothing in there it makes
[1:33:37] noise right see and but when he come
[1:33:41] back he hit the same bump and did not
[1:33:44] make no noise at all because it was
[1:33:47] loaded with good
[1:33:49] things lorded with good things amen when
[1:33:53] is empty it makes noise when it filled
[1:33:58] up then no noise when you hit sence some
[1:34:02] kind of problem you can't make any noise
[1:34:04] you just pray you read your word your
[1:34:07] faith will stand upon his principles in
[1:34:10] upon his solid word amen and so that's
[1:34:14] why Paul said my preaching my speech is
[1:34:18] not standing upon man's Wisdom or
[1:34:20] man-made system or man-made Dogma or de
[1:34:24] a a Doctrine any kind of things like
[1:34:27] that but my faith is standing upon
[1:34:30] Christ the solid rock
[1:34:34] amen hallelujah he said but when he come
[1:34:38] back he hit the same bump and didn't
[1:34:40] make no noise at all because it was
[1:34:42] loaded with good so I think that's just
[1:34:45] about right that we get filled up with
[1:34:49] good things of God that the fruit of the
[1:34:52] spirit might be known through us amen
[1:34:55] fruit of the spirit when we fill love
[1:34:58] with the fruit of the spirit love joy
[1:35:00] peace Temperance longsuffering uh

[1:35:06] when we filled with this good fruit when
[1:35:09] we filled with God's fruit when we
[1:35:11] filled with the spirit of God then then
[1:35:14] we we will We Will We Will bear fruit we
[1:35:17] will be fruitful amen and then that that

[1:49:21] powerless but but any religion that
[1:49:24] Christ in is under his own blood and
[1:49:27] it's got power in it God hates powerless
[1:49:31] religion it's got to have power in it
[1:49:35] it's got to have sincerity sincerity

[1:50:53] by God's
[1:50:59] grace praise God how many appreciate the
[1:51:01] power of God Amen you know Wednesday
[1:51:04] last even last week I preached on the
[1:51:05] spirit of
[1:51:07] fear and Wednesday night I ended the
[1:51:09] message by saying this is how you
[1:51:10] operate faith I don't know if you get a
[1:51:12] chance to saw that or not I mean some
[1:51:13] people were here but you got to confess
[1:51:15] all
[1:51:17] sin uh and be filled with the love of
[1:51:19] God right because love or faith worketh
[1:51:22] through
[1:51:23] love so you must recognize that God
[1:51:26] loves you the goodness of God leads us
[1:51:28] to repentance we must see God's goodness
[1:51:30] in our lives he wants to forgive us he's
[1:51:33] ready to Pardon and that
[1:51:36] love casts out our sins you know casts
[1:51:39] out our fear fills us with love and then
[1:51:41] that love operates Faith how many can
[1:51:44] understand that by God's grace I know
[1:51:46] there's many needs in here um we all
[1:51:48] have them and I just want to share one
[1:51:50] more time from last Sunday night I was
