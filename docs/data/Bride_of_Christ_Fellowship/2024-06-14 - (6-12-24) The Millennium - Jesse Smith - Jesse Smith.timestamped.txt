[0:00] so we're looking at the Millennium here
[0:01] tonight by God's grace preaching outside
[0:04] uh behind my house due to the uh
[0:07] flooding there in the church so we read
[0:10] Revelation 20 ver1 ver2 says and he laid
[0:13] hold on the dragon that old serpent
[0:14] which is the devil and Satan and bound
[0:16] him a thousand years notice four titles
[0:19] right or four or three titles in one
[0:21] name we'd say maybe his name is Satan
[0:24] but he has these titles just like God is
[0:26] Father Son and Holy Ghost but there's
[0:27] one name the Lord Jesus Christ verse
[0:30] three and cast him into the bottomless
[0:32] pit and shut him up and set a seal upon
[0:34] him that he should deceive the Nations
[0:36] no more till the Thousand Years should
[0:38] be fulfilled and after that he must be
[0:40] loosed a little
[0:42] season so he falls for a thousand years
[0:45] what a awful uh we'd say punishment but
[0:49] of course that's what he deserves verse
[0:51] four here's where you and I come in and
[0:54] I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and
[0:58] judgment was given unto them and don't
[1:00] forget 1 Corinthians 6 you'll judge the
[1:02] world you'll judge Angels the Bible said
[1:04] if we can judge the little matters
[1:05] amongst us now and do it the right way
[1:08] the Bible said we'll judge the world and
[1:09] will judge
[1:11] angels and I saw the souls
[1:14] of them that were beheaded for the
[1:17] witness of Jesus like St Paul and for
[1:20] the word of God other saints that died
[1:22] for the word of God which had not
[1:25] worshiped the beast that's where you and
[1:27] I come in right there we did not worship
[1:29] the Beast we don't but R says you don't
[1:30] have to be beheaded to be here you just
[1:32] have to overcome the Beast
[1:34] system neither his image which is the
[1:37] World Council of churches neither had
[1:39] received his Mark upon their foreheads
[1:42] that's the doctrine of the the false
[1:43] church or in their hands brother Ram
[1:45] said that's doing the will of the
[1:47] Antichrist
[1:49] system and they lived and reigned with
[1:52] Christ a, years praise God verse 5 but
[1:57] the rest of the Dead live not again
[1:59] until till the thousand years were
[2:01] finished this is the first resurrection
[2:04] now let's read verse 6 on three 1 2 3
[2:07] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[2:11] the First Resurrection on such the
[2:13] second death hath no power but they
[2:16] shall be Priests of God and of Christ
[2:20] and shall reign with him a thousand
[2:22] years may God add his Blessing to read
[2:24] of his word you can be
[2:27] seated also my wife said there there's
[2:30] some bug repellent back there we got
[2:31] some bugs down here you know I tried to
[2:33] shoot them away but of course they come
[2:35] back you know I don't know something
[2:36] something about they want to be down
[2:37] here so by God's grace we'll look here
[2:40] at the scriptures on the Millennium I
[2:42] appreciate you coming out here in our
[2:43] makeshift church here by the grace of
[2:45] the Lord um I got a lot of things uh uh
[2:48] I'll probably save for the video some of
[2:50] this will be uh new to you some of it
[2:52] will be reviewed so I'll try to kind of
[2:54] have a sense of how you feel about
[2:57] this so I want to give a disclaimer you
[3:00] know there's no thus sayith the Lord
[3:01] from Brother brandham on this topic so
[3:03] that's why a few of the statements I'm
[3:05] going to say you know might be different
[3:06] than what you've heard brother brandham
[3:07] say uh particularly if you listen to
[3:09] questions and answers
[3:11] 64 uh so there's no but there's no thus
[3:13] sayith the Lord on it um so we know it
[3:15] doesn't pertain to
[3:16] Salvation now another thing brother
[3:19] ramam said it was the Millennium was
[3:20] hard for him to understand how many
[3:22] remember that it was in uh questions
[3:24] answers uh part two they asked brother
[3:27] brandom I'd like to know more about the
[3:30] Millennium is it after the marriage
[3:31] supper or on the Earth all about it I
[3:34] don't understand about it brother Bram
[3:35] says well brother sister it's hard for
[3:38] me to understand it myself so this was a
[3:41] topic he was uh he would say the word
[3:43] presuming he was presuming about this
[3:45] topic uh for uh for certain things other
[3:49] things he got exactly right but I want
[3:51] you to see there's no thus sayith the
[3:52] Lord and it was hard for him to
[3:54] understand there's another quote where
[3:56] he says they asked brother brandom are
[3:58] there going to be children in the
[3:59] Millennium he says it it looks a lot
[4:01] like there will be he said but it looks
[4:03] like a lot that there won't be he said I
[4:05] don't know he said if the Lord lets me
[4:07] know I'll tell you Hallelujah so um I
[4:12] want to read this quote this is a
[4:13] beautiful
[4:16] quote Oh yeah sorry brother than sorry
[4:19] hopefully it wouldn't fall off the nail
[4:21] there by God's grace thank you
[4:23] Mal in the church age book chapter 7
[4:25] brother Bram says the foolish virgin
[4:27] will miss the Millennium which you can
[4:29] be begin to see by these truths is much
[4:32] more
[4:33] important and wonderful than we have
[4:36] ever thought or
[4:39] believed so if you believe the
[4:40] Millennium was important before I think
[4:42] after tonight you're going to see it's
[4:44] more important than what you thought it
[4:45] was because that's what I found out when
[4:47] I started reading the scriptures and and
[4:49] it started connecting wow all these
[4:50] scriptures about they have the same idea
[4:52] All Nations coming to Worship in
[4:54] Jerusalem when I started reading these
[4:55] things I thought wow this is more
[4:56] important than I thought and then I
[4:59] found out it's more wonderful than I'd
[5:01] imagined so if you think the Millennium
[5:03] is going to be wonderful now wait till
[5:05] after this sermon hopefully it's more
[5:06] wonderful to you because hopefully
[5:08] you'll read new scriptures in a new
[5:10] light by the grace of God that's what I
[5:12] found as I've studied this I've put
[5:13] numerous hours into studying this so let
[5:16] me tell you this why is it so important
[5:18] I believe it's important because Eternal
[5:20] positions that God ordained for you and
[5:24] eternal purposes become reality in other
[5:27] words you become there what God always
[5:30] meant you to be MH here on this Earth
[5:32] sometimes it feels like there's
[5:33] disappointments doesn't it you know we
[5:35] can't maybe we don't accomplish what we
[5:37] think we should accomplish or uh you
[5:39] would you know you want good things to
[5:40] happen to Christians right you think oh
[5:42] my I just think this Christian they
[5:43] ought to they ought to have better than
[5:45] this or they ought to have a better life
[5:46] than that but in the Millennium
[5:49] everything is brought back to its
[5:51] original design the plan of God Amen
[5:54] God's Eternal position for you you'll
[5:56] have it there Hallelujah brother says
[5:58] your eternal purpose you'll have it
[6:00] there brother even says if you married
[6:01] the wrong one here he says you'll get
[6:03] the right one there now that goes back
[6:05] to whoever your spirit your soul was
[6:07] connected to in the mind of God before
[6:10] the foundation of the world Hallelujah
[6:12] like Adam and Eve their souls were one
[6:14] their souls were one spear right and
[6:16] then God broke them apart and they come
[6:18] back together so that's quite a
[6:20] thought and remember Church God's word
[6:23] does not return void whatever God's word
[6:25] promises you will receive it amen and it
[6:28] also brings this the light you know the
[6:30] Eternal position and purpose the Eternal
[6:32] position of Jesus's 12 Apostles was to
[6:34] rule and Reign Over The 12 Tribes of
[6:36] Israel MH and Jesus said they will have
[6:39] that in the Millennium imagine Peter
[6:41] will reign over one of the tribes maybe
[6:43] it's Manasseh maybe it's Ephraim you
[6:45] know maybe it's Judah Hallelujah but
[6:48] Peter will reign over one of those
[6:50] tribes he'll he'll uh rule over them and
[6:53] tell them what to do and where to live
[6:54] and and how to how to live and what
[6:56] their jobs will be Peter will rule over
[6:58] One Tribe because that's what God that's
[7:00] what God's purpose always was right God
[7:02] gave the Keys of the Kingdom but not
[7:04] just that there was eternal purpose
[7:05] behind that that he could rule over
[7:07] people in the Millennium praise God Amen
[7:10] God always saw Peter as a ruler as a
[7:13] leader Hallelujah although it didn't
[7:15] look like it when when he denied Christ
[7:17] three times right it didn't look like he
[7:18] was a real leader but the Bible said
[7:20] Jesus comes to wash us hallelujah and
[7:23] justify us and he comes to empower us
[7:25] and fill us with his Spirit praise God
[7:27] so see church here we might not look all
[7:29] the time
[7:30] uh uh how we're going to be in the
[7:31] Millennium but in the Millennium we'll
[7:33] have all the positions all the purposes
[7:35] all the rights and responsibilities
[7:37] we'll re be restored in the Millennium
[7:38] Hallelujah now why is it so wonderful
[7:41] because we'll witness this Earth the
[7:43] same Earth except with a new outside
[7:45] part right with a new renovation of the
[7:47] outward part new trees and new grass and
[7:49] new leaves and everything new plants and
[7:51] everything will witness the Earth and
[7:54] but will also see Fallen man ruled by
[7:57] Perfect Divine love the way it was
[7:59] originally meant to be that's why it's
[8:02] so wonderful we're going to see uh the
[8:05] the the Earth and the Earth Systems as
[8:07] it ought to be brother R said we he said
[8:09] when we get to Lum it's going to be just
[8:10] like we live now except no planes no
[8:13] automobiles none of these government
[8:15] buildings or something like that you
[8:16] know none of the uh none of the trains
[8:19] he said because we'll be able to travel
[8:20] like a thought praise God if you've got
[8:22] a glorified body amen hallelujah so it's
[8:26] so much more important than we can even
[8:27] think now and it's also so much more
[8:29] wonderful than we can even imagine now A
[8:33] Thousand Years where we'll never get
[8:35] tired we'll never run out of uh things
[8:37] to do we never feel bored how many
[8:39] looking forward to that praise God never
[8:41] you you'll never lack anything praise
[8:43] God you you and the Bible says in one
[8:45] place before you make a call now the
[8:47] Bible doesn't say this is to God or to a
[8:49] friend before you call the answer will
[8:52] come that's what I'm looking forward to
[8:53] Hallelujah I don't even got to ask for
[8:55] anything I just got to think about it
[8:56] and then there it is it's right there
[8:58] Hallelujah all this is better than any
[8:59] movie they could make Hallelujah we've
[9:01] seen lots of crazy movies you know well
[9:03] when we were Sinners not all of us you
[9:04] know thank God we've seen Lots some of
[9:07] us saw lots of movies but they cannot
[9:08] even come close to how wonderful the
[9:11] Millennium is going to be for Christ and
[9:13] his bride amen
[9:16] hallelujah now the inspiration came as I
[9:18] said since January I've been reading
[9:20] through Genesis now I'm in uh what I'm
[9:22] in now Rome Romans no I'm in 1
[9:25] Corinthians and I'm just uh uh
[9:28] transferring all my favorite notes and
[9:30] bible studies like in my Bible over to
[9:32] my new Bible and I came across Zechariah
[9:34] 14 Isaiah 2 Isaiah 11 Isaiah 65 Jeremiah
[9:38] 3 Micah 4 I came across all these texts
[9:41] and something stuck out they all said
[9:42] all nations will flow into Jerusalem
[9:45] many nations will flow into Jerusalem
[9:47] the wolf will lie down with the lamb
[9:49] right we always we always see pictures
[9:50] of lions laying by Lambs but that's not
[9:53] the word of God the Bible says the wolf
[9:56] will lay down with the lamb so see how
[9:58] we even you know even people's art even
[10:00] artists need corrected by the word of
[10:01] God right they have one idea about uh
[10:04] the Millennium now it may be a lion lied
[10:05] down with a lamb but the Bible calls it
[10:07] a wolf so after reading all these things
[10:10] I was just blown away and uh I'll try to
[10:13] bring these out I'm going to briefly go
[10:15] through these uh Five Points what's the
[10:17] Millennium when is it how do we get
[10:18] there now the main one for me number
[10:20] four what happens during it I have so
[10:23] many uh new thoughts about that from the
[10:26] scriptures I want to share with you I
[10:27] think it'll encourage you by God's Grace
[10:29] cuz that's what we're living for how
[10:30] many living for the Millennium amen I'm
[10:32] I'm trying to re over sin now that I can
[10:35] re over cities later am if I can Reign
[10:38] Over the sin nature of Jesse Smith then
[10:40] Jesus promised me I'll at least re over
[10:42] one city Hallelujah if I'm a one Talent
[10:44] preacher then I maybe I'll get two
[10:45] cities in fact actually maybe I'll get
[10:47] two cities if I can just re over this
[10:48] one this one uh sin nature God will give
[10:51] me two cities to rule over by God's
[10:53] grace we see that's plain from the
[10:55] scripture Jesus doesn't lie he doesn't
[10:57] tell fables hallelujah amen he tells the
[10:59] truth now this is all review but brother
[11:01] B said the 1,000 year Millennium is the
[11:03] Everlasting righteousness on the earth
[11:06] this is one of the six purposes of
[11:08] Daniel's 70 weeks from Daniel
[11:12] 9:24 the six purposes
[11:15] are uh are determined okay to finish the
[11:18] transgression to make an end of sin to
[11:22] make reconciliation for iniquity to
[11:24] bring in Everlasting righteousness to
[11:27] seal up the vision and to anoint the
[11:28] most holy that's the six reasons Gabriel
[11:31] visited Daniel in Daniel chapter 9 the
[11:33] fourth reason was to bring in
[11:35] Everlasting righteousness that's the
[11:37] millenum amen so that's what it is it's
[11:39] Everlasting righteous now the people
[11:41] there's going to be all kinds of we'll
[11:42] see there's people from all over the
[11:43] world are going to cover this world and
[11:46] we're going to have to bring in
[11:47] righteousness if they won't do the
[11:49] righteous thing we'll get we'll make
[11:50] them do righteousness we'll make them
[11:53] because we'll be rulers Hallelujah and
[11:54] we've already proved we can rule right
[11:56] now so that's why Jesus can trust us
[11:58] there Hallelujah Amen to rule in
[12:01] righteousness make them do right now
[12:04] brother said Jesus think about this when
[12:06] Jesus was tempted three times by Satan
[12:09] the reason he didn't give in was because
[12:11] he knew he was going to fall air to the
[12:13] Millennium how many remember brother
[12:14] Bram saying that Jesus said I'm sorry
[12:17] Satan said he took Jesus on the mountain
[12:20] and said all these are mine he says I'll
[12:23] give them to you if you worship me and
[12:25] brother bam said Jesus said get behind
[12:27] me Satan he knew he was going to fall
[12:29] heir to them in the Millennium
[12:31] hallelujah amen see even Jesus overcame
[12:35] sin by looking to the Millennium and
[12:37] friends that's what we can do tonight we
[12:39] can overcome sin and we can think no I'm
[12:41] not going to fall to that because I want
[12:43] to rule in the Millennium amen I'm not
[12:45] going to compromise I'm not going to
[12:47] give in I'm not going to fall into this
[12:49] because I want to rule in the Millennium
[12:50] like my Lord amen hallelujah so Jesus
[12:53] used that as motivation oh he's trying
[12:55] to give me these kingdoms now but I
[12:56] don't want him in this condition I'm
[12:58] going to get him in there perfect
[12:59] condition hallelujah amen hallelujah
[13:03] brother R said the Millennium proves the
[13:05] price for sins has been paid brother
[13:08] Braham said the man that's going to live
[13:09] through the Millennium 1,000 years and
[13:11] it shows the penalty has been paid man
[13:15] lives forever because remember was it
[13:18] methusa was the one who lived the
[13:20] longest 969 years no man ever lived a
[13:23] thousand years but church if we're
[13:24] faithful if we overcome by the blood of
[13:26] the Lamb we will live longer than
[13:28] Methuselah and our bodies will never get
[13:30] old or tired Hallelujah because Jesus
[13:32] pray paid the price he paid the penalty
[13:35] for our sin and so we we receive his
[13:37] life and then he rewards us for living a
[13:39] life to glorify him and he rewards us
[13:41] with a Thousand-Year lifetime Hallelujah
[13:44] and then of course eternity after that
[13:46] Amen brother Ram said Jesus is the son
[13:50] of David he said and in the Millennium
[13:52] he'll sit on the throne of David
[13:55] Hallelujah and that's why the Bible said
[13:56] he's given the Key of David mhm or the
[13:59] responsibility of kingship during the
[14:02] Millennium brother said it's Jesus who
[14:04] bring in the Millennium after the battle
[14:06] of Armageddon Hallelujah brother Bram
[14:09] said in the Millennium he comes as son
[14:11] of David to set on the throne of David
[14:13] King so what was he remember on Earth he
[14:15] was prophet right now Jesus is priest
[14:18] but he's going to be king Hallelujah
[14:20] Prophet priest king son of man Son of
[14:23] God Son of David Hallelujah and then
[14:26] brother Bram says when he's in the
[14:27] Millennium he'll sit on his own Throne
[14:30] right now Jesus sits on his father's
[14:32] throne in heaven right Jesus said he
[14:34] that overcometh shall set with me on my
[14:37] Throne as I've overcome and set on my
[14:40] father's Throne isn't that amazing Jesus
[14:42] is on the father's Throne now but when
[14:44] he comes down here he sits on his own
[14:46] Throne Hallelujah because that's his
[14:48] reward that's his reward for overcoming
[14:50] sin he gets his own throne and church
[14:52] that's your reward too you get your own
[14:54] Throne you get to rule on this Earth and
[14:56] I don't know how it works out for
[14:57] sisters I don't know how it works out I
[14:58] don't know how it works out like that
[15:00] but the Bible says if you overcome you
[15:02] get to sit with him on his throne
[15:04] hallelujah amen so the Bible said in the
[15:07] Millennium he'll be son of David
[15:10] Hallelujah now brother also says the
[15:12] Millennium is the honeymoon they asked
[15:14] brother Bram will there be people on the
[15:15] Earth in Corporal bodies during that
[15:17] time of the Millennium yes sir we will
[15:19] have our glorified body eating drinking
[15:23] and building houses see I'm not going to
[15:24] build a house here I'm going to build a
[15:26] house there by God's grace as far as I
[15:28] know
[15:29] Hallelujah he said just he says just
[15:33] living just like we do now for a
[15:35] thousand years Hallelujah but there you
[15:38] know there's not going to be these
[15:38] mosquitoes around right I believe it by
[15:40] God's grace and if there are you got
[15:41] power over them Hallelujah you rule over
[15:44] there amen hallelujah so living think
[15:47] about that just like we live now except
[15:49] in a glorified body oh that's going to
[15:51] be wonderful praise God um and that's
[15:54] what I'm living for right that's what
[15:55] we're brother say that's what you're
[15:56] living for that's what you're dying for
[15:58] right you're dying so that you could be
[16:00] rebirthed in a brand new body Hallelujah
[16:02] reborn in a brand new body Hallelujah
[16:05] brother BR said the Millennium it's a
[16:06] th000 years it's a honeymoon for the
[16:09] bride and groom so again the Rapture is
[16:11] the wedding ceremony the Millennia I'm
[16:13] sorry then we go to the wedding supper
[16:15] in the sky the marriage supper of the
[16:16] Lamb then we come back down here for the
[16:18] honeymoon A Thousand Years with Christ
[16:21] hallelujah amen amen now that's all fam
[16:24] mear brother also says the Millennium is
[16:26] the seventh day there were six days of
[16:28] creation right the first day second
[16:30] third fourth uh fifth and then six but
[16:34] then the seventh was interrupted by sin
[16:36] so brother said God wants to get his day
[16:38] back he wants to get his his seventh day
[16:40] back and brother said it's going to be a
[16:42] thousand years it's called the
[16:44] Millennium so we get the seventh day
[16:46] back he teaches that in the future home
[16:48] if you want to look at that and then 2
[16:49] Peter 3:8 says but beloved be not
[16:52] ignorant of this one thing one day is
[16:54] with the Lord as a thousand years and
[16:56] the Thousand Years as one day think of
[16:59] that when we get done with a thousand
[17:00] years we'll say wow that was a great day
[17:04] I I can't wait for day number two right
[17:06] you get know with the Thousand Years and

[17:16] just an eternal day Hallelujah by the
[17:18] grace of God it's amazing this might be
[17:22] new to you brother said the Millennium
[17:23] typed the Feast of Tabernacles remember
[17:25] there seven uh seven feasts of Israel
[17:27] how many you remember that Passover was
[17:29] type by I'm sorry the Passover was a
[17:31] type the anti-type was the cross of
[17:33] Jesus unleavened bread was a type the
[17:36] literal thing was Jesus going down to
[17:38] Hell right to preach to the spirits in
[17:40] prison get the keys of death in Hell the
[17:42] third Feast was first fruits that was
[17:44] that was a type of Jesus resurrection
[17:46] the fourth is what we're in right now
[17:48] the Feast of Pentecost or the Feast of
[17:50] Weeks right that was the baptism of I'm
[17:52] sorry that was the day of Pentecost and
[17:54] the Fulfillment was the church ages amen
[17:57] sorry uh number five five was uh the
[18:00] Feast of trumpets that's a that's a uh
[18:03] that's fulfilled by the two Jewish
[18:05] prophets and then six is the day of
[18:07] atonement that's fulfilled by the
[18:09] 144,000 being sealed the seventh is the
[18:12] Feast of Tabernacles that's when they
[18:14] lived in the the tents for uh for for
[18:17] seven days and brother B said the
[18:19] Fulfillment of that is the Millennium
[18:21] amen and then the eth day after the the
[18:24] eth day after the seven days of Feast of
[18:25] Tabernacles brother Ram says that's the
[18:27] future home there's a whole convocation
[18:30] that's the future home where the pyramid
[18:32] shaped home comes down to earth Heaven
[18:34] and Earth is eternally United praise God
[18:36] amen amen my so beautiful so many
[18:39] wonderful teachings in here but I'm
[18:41] going through these fast because you've
[18:42] heard them probably over the years when
[18:44] is it brother M said the Millennium is
[18:46] after the battle of Armageddon because
[18:48] Armageddon cleanses the Earth for a
[18:50] thousand years hallelujah it's also a
[18:54] space of time brother Braham said time
[18:56] keeps going during the Millennium time
[18:58] is still kept track
[19:00] of and and as we're going to see there
[19:03] is sin during the Millennium now brother
[19:04] baham said there wasn't sin but remember
[19:06] he didn't have thus sayth the Lord on it
[19:07] but if you look at these scriptures
[19:08] there is sin during the Millennium but
[19:10] brother Bram does say there's sin after
[19:12] the Millennium so we know there's sin
[19:14] before we know there's sin after so uh
[19:16] no doubt there's sin during the
[19:17] Millennium as well and let me read that
[19:19] where brother Ram says
[19:21] that just so you got
[19:25] it I must have misplaced the quote but
[19:27] I'll find it here in just a moment by
[19:28] God's
[19:30] grace yeah it's in questions answers
[19:33] part three brother Ram said now the
[19:35] Millennium is not the new heavens and
[19:36] the new Earth there will still be sin
[19:39] after the Millennium so you know there's
[19:41] sin before the Millennium there's sin
[19:42] after the Millennium so no doubt the
[19:44] scriptures teach there's even sin during
[19:45] theum but it's not our sin right how
[19:48] many looking forward to that thousand
[19:49] years you never sin you never fall short
[19:51] of God's glory you're never ashamed no
[19:53] more guilt hallelujah amen no no no more
[19:55] questions no no more personal
[19:57] condemnation right nothing like that
[20:00] it's just perfect peace for a thousand
[20:02] years
[20:03] hallelujah
[20:05] amen now you you're all familiar with
[20:07] this you know uh in the Millennium or
[20:10] right right before the Millennium
[20:11] there's a a holy fire Peter says there's
[20:14] fervent heat the Earth burns with
[20:15] fervent heat it just burns the outside
[20:17] of the earth not the inside and then

[21:28] later in these next few verses to the
[21:30] spirit of Elijah that's not for tonight
[21:31] that's a message I've already preached
[21:33] before but notice Jesus is going to
[21:35] bring healing so he's going to bring
[21:36] fire all over the Earth it's going to
[21:37] burn like stubble like we we got a we
[21:40] got a pile of uh sticks back there and
[21:42] every time we burn it it's just a pile
[21:43] of Ashes right well the Earth is going
[21:45] to look like that after the battle of
[21:46] Armageddon but Jesus is going to rise
[21:49] upon the Earth and heal the earth oh
[21:51] it's going to be a beautiful thing verse
[21:53] three sister who would you want to read
[21:54] verse three and you shall tread down the

[21:58] Souls of your feet in the day that I
[22:00] shall do this amen Lord of host amen
[22:03] thank you sister Hallelujah so brother
[22:05] Ram says the the battle of Armageddon
[22:08] purges the Earth it cleans off the Earth
[22:11] so Jesus can step on the Earth right
[22:14] Jesus is not going to step on this Earth
[22:15] until it's burned over with fire and
[22:18] cleaned out remember he comes down he
[22:20] meets Us in the air he actually doesn't
[22:22] touch the Earth he purchased the Earth
[22:24] with his blood Hallelujah but he's not
[22:26] going to touch the Earth with his
[22:28] Corporal glorified body until the Earth
[22:31] is burnt over and all the sin is burned
[22:33] off it hallelujah amen amen now again
[22:36] I'm skipping a little bit here by God's
[22:38] grace now how do we get there this is
[22:40] very familiar you know this but you must
[22:41] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[22:43] your souls and then if you do that you
[22:45] will reign for a thousand years in the
[22:47] Millennium because when you have the
[22:48] Holy Ghost you'll overcome the Beast
[22:50] system remember you'll overcome His
[22:52] Image his mark his name you'll overcome
[22:55] uh the Beast system amen amen now Church
[22:59] you might not think that's a big thing
[23:00] but think about all these people that
[23:01] are trapped in denominational churches
[23:03] right uh you know I've seen different
[23:05] preachers you know they kiss the Pop's
[23:06] ring and they they bow down and kiss his
[23:09] feet and uh there's this one gentleman
[23:11] that had these Evangelical meetings
[23:14] 20,000 people there Lu angle was his
[23:15] name and he and he he apologized he
[23:18] brought these Catholic priests out there
[23:20] and he apologized for being against the
[23:22] Catholic church cuz they were
[23:23] Protestants and he literally kissed
[23:25] their shoes that was a number of years
[23:26] ago probably 5 or 10 years ago now but
[23:29] already but Mo see most people are going
[23:31] back to the be system right you saw
[23:33] Candace Owens she's going back to the be
[23:35] system all these people are going back
[23:37] to the mother Harlot so see there is
[23:40] something wonderful inside of you
[23:41] there's a power inside of you there's a
[23:43] spirit inside of you that won't let you
[23:45] unite or Unite with that Beast system
[23:47] why because the spirit of Christ is
[23:48] against the Beast it just right goes
[23:51] back to the beginning right it was uh
[23:53] Adam and Eve against the Beast right the
[23:54] serpent the battle with the serpent from
[23:56] the beginning is the same battle at the
[23:58] end we're still overcoming the Beast
[24:00] system Hallelujah but we do it by the
[24:02] spirit of God like brother man said the
[24:04] last Eve won't fall amen the first Adam
[24:06] and Eve fell but the last Eve won't
[24:09] hallelujah praise God she'll overcome
[24:10] amen because she's more than a conqueror
[24:13] in Christ Jesus
[24:16] Hallelujah okay so notice it doesn't
[24:18] matter you don't have to be beheaded to
[24:20] be there you just have to not worship
[24:23] the beast in other words you just have
[24:24] to worship Jesus Christ and have a
[24:27] testimony of the word of God and you
[24:29] have to avoid worshiping the Beast His
[24:31] Image his Mark in their foreheads and
[24:33] their hands that's all you've got to do
[24:35] now think about this even John the
[24:36] Revelator he wasn't beheaded and how
[24:39] many think he's going to be there amen
[24:41] some people think oh you got to be a
[24:42] martyr to be there no way you think
[24:44] God's going to keep John out of there
[24:46] right the Beloved the one who leaned on
[24:48] his bosom the one who wanted to be
[24:50] closer to Jesus than everybody else
[24:52] right of course not that's his beloved
[24:55] and so see brother man says these are
[24:57] just different descriptions
[24:59] however you however you overcome the
[25:01] Beast it doesn't matter as long as you
[25:03] overcome the Beast you'll be in the
[25:05] Millennium praise God hallelujah amen so
[25:08] he if John will be there and he died by
[25:10] natural causes we can be there too
[25:12] hallelujah hallelujah thank God they
[25:14] asked brother brandom is are are these
[25:16] part of the Bride past or future brother
[25:18] BR said they're the bride completely
[25:20] both past and now everybody say now
[25:22] ready now so brother brother Bram reads
[25:25] Revelation 20:4 and he says there the
[25:27] bride in the past and they're the bride
[25:29] right now hallelujah oh my it's
[25:34] beautiful now I have to SK skip some of
[25:36] these uh sister Lena do you want to read
[25:38] Romans
[25:41] 5:17 want to get that then Haven do you
[25:43] want to get
[25:44] um Haven 2 Timothy 2:12 Romans 5:17 2
[25:49] Timothy
[25:50] 2:12 whenever you're ready sistera uh uh
[25:54] Romans
[25:55] 5:17 4 517 yes for If by one's man
[26:00] offense death by one more they which
[26:03] receive abundance of Grace and of gift
[26:07] of righteousness shall reign in life by
[26:09] one Jesus Christ amen so how do we reign
[26:12] in life Jesus has given us go I'm sorry
[26:15] given us a gift of righteousness that's
[26:16] the holy spirit amen right how are you
[26:19] righteous not by your righteousness by
[26:20] God's righteousness right so how do we
[26:23] get there we got to have the Holy Ghost
[26:24] and that means you reign in this life by
[26:27] one Jesus Christ
[26:28] amen right and you remember when you
[26:30] were a sinner sin reigned over you right
[26:32] the Bible said sin Reed over your mortal
[26:34] body did it not yeah and if you're you
[26:36] know if you remember that well then
[26:38] praise God now you can see sin doesn't
[26:40] Reign Over man anymore I Reign Over sin
[26:43] amen I'm bringing my body in the
[26:45] subjection to the word of God
[26:46] hallelujah Glory so that's another way
[26:48] to say it right there that's another way
[26:49] to say how you overcame the Beast system
[26:52] you reigned in this life over sin and
[26:54] then Haven 2 Timothy 2:12 H whenever
[26:56] you're ready if we SE if we suffer we
[26:59] shall also re with him if we deny him he
[27:02] will also deny us amen praise God so how
[27:06] can we reign with Christ we have to
[27:07] suffer with him right so that God is
[27:11] going to bring us through sufferings
[27:13] it's not all uh pleasantries right
[27:15] brother man said we're when we came a
[27:17] Christian we didn't come to a picnic
[27:18] he's saying he said we came to a
[27:20] battlefield how many understand that by
[27:21] God's grace and sometimes we go through
[27:23] trials we think why am I going through
[27:24] trials did I do something wrong well it
[27:26] could be or it could be God has just
[27:28] training your character to suffer so you
[27:30] can Reign Hallelujah cuz that's what he
[27:33] says you have to suffer in order to
[27:35] Reign now we see it in America with
[27:37] rejection of our family that's where we
[27:38] often see it like I often use brother
[27:40] amen as an example he's rejected he's
[27:42] kicked out of his house I mean that's
[27:43] truly suffering uh for for being a
[27:46] Christian right and now some of us we
[27:49] may suffer with natural sickness some of
[27:51] us may suffer with other things but the
[27:53] point is God's going to let us suffer
[27:55] but I love what you know Haven shared
[27:57] with me in Lydia isaah 43 I'm going to
[27:58] turn there real quick I love what they
[28:00] shared we are going to suffer but look
[28:02] what God promised if he promises to
[28:03] Israel how much more the
[28:05] bride verse uh Isaiah
[28:08] 432 when thou passest through the waters
[28:11] I will be with thee
[28:13] amen and through the rivers they shall
[28:15] not overflow the ever feel like life's
[28:17] going to overflow you and you're going
[28:19] to drown in all your all your busyness
[28:21] and all your trials ever feel like that
[28:24] God said I'll be with you when you walk
[28:26] through the fire Thou shalt not be
[28:29] burned sound like sounds like Shadrach
[28:31] Meshach and Abednego amen hallelujah
[28:33] neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee
[28:36] Hallelujah now verse five fear not for I
[28:39] am with thee verse 7even says for I've
[28:42] created him for my glory I have formed
[28:45] him yay I have made him so this is the
[28:48] scripture that really encouraged me when
[28:49] I was going through my threats that I
[28:51] had to receive maybe that's a suffering
[28:53] Hallelujah I don't know I I I felt like
[28:55] I suffered that's for sure okay so I
[28:58] just put that in there that reminded me
[29:00] of that verse there so we reign in this
[29:03] life we suffer in order to Reign we have
[29:06] to have the right character so the only
[29:08] way you can have real character is to
[29:09] suffer difficult times then you'll know
[29:11] how to act when those things happen
[29:13] again amen you might fail the first time
[29:15] but by God's grace you won't fail the
[29:17] second time hallelujah amen I'll know
[29:19] when I'll know the next time when that
[29:21] comes around
[29:22] hallelujah
[29:24] amen we sit with Jesus and we judge the
[29:27] Bible said we'll judge angels will judge
[29:29] the world to him that overcometh
[29:31] Revelation 3:21 will I grant to sit with
[29:33] me in my Throne hallelujah amen and then
[29:36] Revelation 24 again they lived and
[29:39] reigned with Christ A Thousand Years
[29:41] Hallelujah because they overcame during
[29:43] their lifetime now here is the most
[29:45] wonderful part of the sermon hopefully
[29:46] by God's grace get your Bibles ready I'm
[29:48] going to need some Bible readers here by
[29:49] God's grace what happens during the
[29:51] Millennium now I've already said some of
[29:52] them the first thing is we the the uh
[29:55] sorry the most holy place is Anointed
[29:59] amen the second third things they have
[30:01] to bury all the soldiers from Armageddon
[30:04] remember uh Russia China are listed in
[30:06] there uh the the 10 tyrants of the earth
[30:09] so probably North Korea some other ones
[30:11] in there Syria probably uh and then they
[30:15] got to burn the weapons so think about
[30:18] all these tanks right we see these tanks
[30:19] and planes they have to burn those
[30:21] during the Millennium going to be a lot
[30:23] of fire right right it's the Bible says
[30:26] it's going to take years to burn their
[30:27] planes and all their guns
[30:30] years and then this is for you and I
[30:32] we're going to build plant and
[30:35] inhabit and then we're also going to be
[30:37] part of some worldwide worship Services
[30:39] by God's grace oh my I can't wait for
[30:41] that Hallelujah again I want to be on
[30:44] the side where brother Brooks is leading
[30:45] songs okay brother Brooks and brother
[30:47] amen by God's
[30:49] gra
[30:51] Hallelujah so what does anoint the most
[30:53] holy mean it means Jesus comes in and he
[30:56] sits on the new Millennial Temple in
[30:59] Jerusalem in the holiest of holies but
[31:02] Church don't fret there's no veil in
[31:04] that Temple Hallelujah cuz the veil's
[31:06] already been torn hallelujah amen so
[31:08] we'll be able to approach the throne of
[31:10] God we'll go from the outer Court the
[31:12] inner court and we'll see Jesus in the
[31:14] holiest of holies hallelujah amen now
[31:16] we'll already have an exalted position
[31:18] we're already Kings and Priests unto God
[31:20] right we'll have a way weigh in we'll
[31:22] just have a a way in there already now
[31:25] the Sinners they have a different
[31:26] process they actually have to bring
[31:27] animal sacrific we're going to see in
[31:28] the scripture if you haven't read
[31:31] Ezekiel 40 40-48 read that you'll see
[31:35] all these things that Heathen have to do
[31:37] in order to worship
[31:39] amen it's the end of Ezekiel the last
[31:41] chapter is 48 so Ezekiel 40 to 48 and
[31:44] brother R said any Bible reader knows
[31:47] that's the millennial
[31:48] Temple and I I felt bad brother Austin I
[31:51] I didn't know that I thought I was a
[31:53] Bible reader I realized I'm not really a
[31:55] Bible reader in other words I'm just a
[31:58] young Christian well brother said any
[32:00] reader should know that well I'm not
[32:01] much of a reader then by God's grace
[32:03] he's going to help me though amen
[32:06] hallelujah so we'll probably skip over
[32:08] that one um brother bam said notice
[32:11] anoint the most holy brother said Jesus
[32:13] is already anointed how many know that
[32:16] acts 10:38 already said Jesus is
[32:18] Anointed was anointed with the Holy
[32:19] Ghost and power to do signs wonders and
[32:21] miracles Jesus don't need anointing it's
[32:23] the temple that needs anointing amen and
[32:26] that Temple gets anointed when Jes Jesus
[32:28] comes in he says he says Jesus is
[32:30] already anointed is that right the book
[32:31] of Acts said that God anointed Jesus
[32:34] with the Holy Ghost
[32:36] Hallelujah the most holy place is a
[32:38] sanctuary where God lived between the
[32:40] cherubims and this time Christ will set
[32:42] in the most holy place with the
[32:44] anointing on him oh my hallelujah praise
[32:48] God so if you haven't read it brother
[32:51] said any reader knows that from Ezekiel
[32:53] the 40th chapter until about the 44th
[32:55] chapter is nothing in the world but the
[32:58] Millennium temple being erected on Earth
[33:01] anyone knows that
[33:04] see yes sir brother BR that's right
[33:06] anyone knows it well that that's that's
[33:08] perfect because I'm I'm a nobody right
[33:11] anyone knows that well I'm no one so
[33:14] that that fits me by God's
[33:15] grace now I showed you this a while ago
[33:18] uh let me see if I can just show it to
[33:20] you Ezekiel Temple looks like that I
[33:23] mean it's I'm not you're not going to be
[33:24] able to see it very long but it's just a
[33:26] it's a massive massive Temple because
[33:28] all the nations of the earth need to
[33:30] have time to come in there worship and
[33:33] sacrifice and it's much larger than um
[33:36] any other
[33:39] Temple so here I'll Point down here in
[33:41] the green is a American football field
[33:44] and that's the Ezekiel Temple remember
[33:45] this picture I showed it about a year
[33:47] ago so how many football fields can you
[33:49] get in there probably like 10 that's a
[33:51] football field and then that's the
[33:53] millennial Temple just imagine how large
[33:56] that is how many thousands of people
[33:57] football field ezekiel's Temple that's
[34:00] in uh Ezekiel
[34:03] 40-48 so the green one is American
[34:05] football field and that's the millennial
[34:07] Temple just the massive size of that
[34:11] Hallelujah and in their Church you're a
[34:13] priest amen and the church said right
[34:17] you don't have to be born out of Levi
[34:19] you just got to be born from Heaven
[34:21] hallelujah praise God amen amen it don't
[34:23] matter your natural birth doesn't matter
[34:26] your spiritual birth is all the that
[34:28] matters Hallelujah you get to be a part
[34:30] of that a priest unto God that
[34:33] Millennial Temple is only 750 ft
[34:38] wide anybody remember how many miles
[34:40] wide uh the length is of the New
[34:43] Jerusalem
[34:44] 1,500 miles
[34:47] wide so the millennial Temple is only
[34:49] 750 ft I like to measure that out
[34:51] sometime maybe after service I'll
[34:52] measure that
[34:54] after but the New Jerusalem so it's it's
[34:56] only 14 % of one mile right but the New
[35:00] Jerusalem is 1,500 mil length of it
[35:05] right brother man' said it's from Maine
[35:06] to Florida that's just one side of the
[35:09] of the new of the New Jerusalem Temple
[35:11] praise God hallelujah so there's no
[35:13] comparison how great that
[35:16] is okay now got your Bibles there let's
[35:19] read about bearing soldiers and bearing
[35:21] weapons here uh who would like to read
[35:23] here sister Z you want to read that
[35:24] sister Z do you want to go to Ezekiel
[35:26] 399
[35:28] and then I'll give sister uh H I'll give
[35:30] you a verse there sister why don't you
[35:32] go to Isaiah 65 sister haa uh
[35:36] 6517 and then sister Zur Ezekiel
[35:41] 399 so let's first read about bearing
[35:45] bodies and bearing weapons so sister Zer
[35:48] could you read N9 and 10 yeah and they
[35:52] that dwell in the cities of Israel shall
[35:54] go forth and shall set on fire and burn
[35:56] the weapons both the Shields and the
[35:58] bucklers the bows and the arrows and the
[36:00] hand stades and the Spears and they
[36:03] shall burn them with fire seven years so
[36:06] that they shall take no wood out of the
[36:08] field neither cut down any out of the
[36:10] forces for they shall burn the weapons
[36:13] with fire and they shall spoil those
[36:15] that spoil them and Rob those that Rob
[36:17] them sayeth the Lord God Amen verse 12
[36:20] look if you skip down to verse 12 I'll
[36:21] read that and seven months shall be the
[36:23] house of Israel be bearing of them that
[36:26] they may cleanse the land
[36:28] s years of just burning the
[36:32] weapons and seven months of bearing the
[36:35] bodies right so God's not just God's not
[36:38] just going to send down Holy Fire and
[36:39] burn up all the the Russians or the
[36:41] Chinese or the I don't think a miracle
[36:43] will be existing at that time but in
[36:46] other words anyone who comes against
[36:47] anyone in the B system who comes against
[36:49] Christ God's not just going to burn them
[36:52] up with fire right some of their bodies
[36:54] will be stubbled but they still got to
[36:56] bury those right the Bible said the be a
[36:57] stubble they still have to bury them
[37:00] they're going to have something to do
[37:02] right they got to they got to live right
[37:03] they got to inhabit they got to start

[37:39] create for behold I create Jerusalem a
[37:42] rejoicing and her people of joy and I
[37:46] will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my
[37:48] people and the voice of weeping shall be
[37:50] no more heard in her nor the voice of
[37:53] crime amen we know Jerusalem and
[37:57] Israel's is not in a happy condition

[38:34] praise God look at verse 20 there shall
[38:37] be no more than an infant of days nor an
[38:39] old man that shall not fill his days so
[38:42] see there's not going to be an infant
[38:43] who dies or an old man that doesn't get
[38:45] to live out his years see
[38:48] this for the child shall die 100 years
[38:51] old but the sinner being 100 years old
[38:53] shall be accursed so see uh it seems
[38:56] like the least of amount of time a
[38:58] person will live will be 100 that's what
[38:59] it seems like from the scripture so
[39:01] God's going to protect them and give
[39:02] them good lives remember they they got
[39:04] good rulers to rule over them praise God

[42:26] brother yeah got
[42:28] okay all right so brother a why don't
[42:31] you get Zechariah 14:16 Zechariah right
[42:33] before Matthew find Matthew it's a book
[42:36] right before that I'm sorry two books
[42:37] before that Malachi Zechariah 14:16 you
[42:41] said Zechariah 14 sir yep Zechariah
[42:45] 14:16 so as I was reading these last you
[42:47] know six months I've been reading
[42:49] through the Old Testament and everything
[42:51] I kept coming across these same thoughts
[42:53] about going up to Jerusalem to worship
[42:55] so brother could you read uh 16 17 and
[42:57] 18 yeah
[43:00] um and it shall come to pass that
[43:02] everyone that is left of all the nations
[43:04] which came against Jerusalem shall even
[43:07] go up from year to year to worship the
[43:09] king the Lord of hosts and to keep the
[43:11] Feast of Tabernacles and shall be that
[43:14] who so will not come up of all the
[43:16] families of the earth unto Jerusalem to
[43:18] worship the king the Lord of hosts even
[43:21] upon them shall be no rain and if the
[43:24] family of Egypt go not up and come not
[43:28] that have no rain there shall be the
[43:30] plague wherewith the Lord will Smite the
[43:32] Heathen that come not up to keep the
[43:35] Feast of Tabernacles amen how many are
[43:37] shocked by that statement there there's
[43:39] going to be parts of the world that that
[43:42] I wonder if we'll control it right
[43:43] because Jesus controlled nature there'll
[43:45] be parts of the world that will not
[43:47] receive rain because they don't come up
[43:49] to worship Jesus now friends this has
[43:51] not been fulfilled yet right this was
[43:54] written uh what's the verse there 14
[43:58] well this must have been what 400 years
[43:59] before Christ yeah almost 500 years
[44:01] before Christ you know after this Israel
[44:04] never had a king that everybody Came To
[44:05] Worship it hasn't been fulfilled this
[44:07] has to be the Millennium this has to be
[44:09] Jesus the king and did you see that in
[44:11] verse 16 everyone that's left of all the
[44:14] nations so there's some people you know
[44:16] those movies about living through armor
[44:18] gedon bright brother Austin you that's
[44:20] that's from the Bible that's that's real
[44:22] some people are when God burns the Earth
[44:24] over maybe they got their maybe they're
[44:26] camped in the ground I don't know who
[44:28] knows maybe they're in caves the Bible
[44:29] said they'll be in caves some of them
[44:31] will be in caves calling out from
[44:32] calling out to the
[44:34] lamb but some of them there's going to
[44:36] be some people left over and they're
[44:37] going to just walk out into ashes right
[44:40] and they're going to see Jesus heal the
[44:42] Earth and heal the
[44:43] Nations
[44:46] Hallelujah and no no notice there'll be
[44:48] no rain if you don't go up to worship
[44:49] Jesus and there's going to be plagues
[44:51] now Egypt's going to get a good reminder
[44:53] of plagues they already got some plagues
[44:54] Hallelujah Jesus is going to give them
[44:56] some more plagues because they don't
[44:57] come to worship yeah right and now look
[45:00] at verse 19 this shall be what the
[45:02] punishment see there's punishments
[45:03] during the
[45:04] Millennium because there's rulers and if
[45:07] you don't follow the rulers you get
[45:08] punished this is the right way the Earth
[45:11] should have always been and the
[45:13] punishment of all Nations that come not
[45:15] up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles All
[45:18] Nations see the whole world imagine that
[45:19] the whole world is going to be required
[45:21] to come and travel to Jerusalem verse 20
[45:25] in that day there shall be upon the
[45:27] bells of the horses Holiness unto the
[45:29] Lord look we're going back to the horse
[45:30] and buggy days
[45:32] hallelujah amen and the pots in the
[45:35] Lord's house shall be like the bows
[45:36] before the altar I don't know what that
[45:39] means but verse 21 yay every pot in
[45:41] Jerusalem and in Judah shall be Holiness
[45:42] under the Lord oh they'll all be set
[45:44] aside that's right for Holy purposes
[45:46] won't anybody be getting drunk there
[45:49] Hallelujah and notice and all they that
[45:51] sacrifice so look animal sacrifices so
[45:54] as much as we love our animals right
[45:56] there's going to be some animal
[45:57] sacrifices God is going to reinstitute
[46:00] this so the heathens of the earth
[46:01] understand what Jesus did for them right
[46:04] it's going to be a lital that's going to
[46:05] be a type in Shadow and that there's the
[46:06] antitype right there Jesus
[46:08] Christ and they that sacrifice shall
[46:10] come and take of them and see therein
[46:12] and in that day there shall be no more
[46:14] of the Canaanite in the house of the
[46:16] Lord of hosts so I don't know what that
[46:18] means maybe God destroys that whole
[46:19] nation you know in the M I'm sorry in
[46:21] the battle of Armageddon I don't know
[46:23] that's a good thought I'm at 46 minutes

[47:04] last days that the mountain of the
[47:05] Lord's house shall be established in the

[47:28] law and the word of the Lord the Lord
[47:31] from Jerusalem and he shall judge among
[47:33] nations and shall re rebuke many people
[47:37] and they shall beat their swords into
[47:40] plowshares and their Spears into pruning
[47:44] hooks hooks Nations shall not lift up
[47:46] the Nations shall not lift up sword
[47:49] against Nation neither shall they learn

[47:57] let us walk in the light of Lord that's
[47:59] where we get that song we walk in the
[48:01] light such a beautiful light now we do
[48:03] it spiritually when we confess our sins
[48:05] the Bible says spiritually walk in the
[48:07] light right but here is the literal
[48:09] light we'll walk in the light of Jesus
[48:11] Christ the light of his glory shining
[48:14] upon the
[48:15] Nations Hallelujah so see verse two said
[48:18] all the nations will flow into this this
[48:20] I I show you that Ezekiel house 750 ft
[48:23] wide all the nations shall flow and they
[48:26] got to go out a separate door the Bible
[48:27] said they can't go in the same door they
[48:28] came Hallelujah that's a good type there
[48:31] in other words like church you shouldn't
[48:33] leave the same way you came to church
[48:35] right right if you're down or
[48:36] discouraged don't leave that way

[48:57] their ways in verse three he has to
[48:58] teach these Heathen Nations that made it
[49:00] through Armageddon he's got to teach
[49:02] them their
[49:03] ways and the and out of Zion shall go
[49:06] forth the law Zion's been hearing his

[49:19] Temple he's got to give the law so the
[49:21] people know the
[49:22] law and notice he shall judge them and
[49:25] you catch that that she read in verse
[49:26] four rebuke many people so Jesus Will
[49:30] rebuke many people I imagine we will too
[49:32] because the Bible said we'll rule with a
[49:34] rod of iron in other words we'll slam
[49:35] down that Rod right this is how it's
[49:37] going to be we'll rule with a rod of

[50:13] call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord
[50:15] and all the nations shall be gathered
[50:17] unto it to the name of the Lord to
[50:19] Jerusalem neither shall they walk
[50:22] anymore after the imaginations of their
[50:24] evil heart amen wonderful this was not
[50:27] fulfilled in Jeremiah's day right
[50:29] because they still wanted the Ark of the
[50:30] Covenant even today the temple Institute
[50:33] that's the name of the Jews who trying
[50:34] to get ready for the Third Temple right

[52:33] worshiping learning the word of God
[52:35] everybody see that all the same thoughts
[52:36] as all these other verses isn't it
[52:38] awesome how God scattered this truth all
[52:39] over the Old Testament it's scattered
[52:41] all over there but as I was reading just
[52:43] this year I came across all these and
[52:45] wrote them down in a notepad I'm like
[52:46] this is a sermon right here hallelujah
[52:48] this is our future amen we are going to
[52:51] see this Hallelujah not somebody else
[52:53] our eyes will see it praise God verse
[52:56] three and he shall judge among many
[52:58] people and rebuke strong Nations a far
[53:00] off look at that Jesus is going to
[53:01] rebuke all the nations far from
[53:02] Jerusalem like maybe North America right
[53:05] South
[53:06] America Australia all these nations far
[53:09] off from Jerusalem Jesus Will rebuke
[53:11] them from his throne because they don't
[53:13] come to worship Him and they shall beat
[53:15] the swords into plow shears and their
[53:17] Spears into pruning hooks remember Lena
[53:18] read that pruning hooks Nations shall
[53:20] not lift up a sword against Nation
[53:21] neither shall they learn War anymore but
[53:23] they shall sit every man under his Vine
[53:25] and under his fig tree think of that
[53:26] think about that you're going to find
[53:27] your tree you're going to find your
[53:29] Vineyard and you're just going to go sit
[53:30] under there and enjoy
[53:31] it amen you're going to take a few
[53:33] minutes off by God's
[53:36] grace and None Shall make them afraid
[53:38] look at that you'll never be afraid
[53:40] Hallelujah there'll be no fear there
[53:42] because Jesus is King amen for the mouth
[53:45] of the lord of the hosts has spoken it
[53:48] for all people will walk everyone in the
[53:50] name of his God and we will walk in the
[53:52] name of our Lord Our God forever and
[53:55] ever because remember at the end of this
[53:57] Thousand Years Satan's going to deceive
[53:58] almost everybody on the earth so see
[54:01] they might even have their own Gods
[54:03] right but just keep them secret but if
[54:06] they don't come up and worship they
[54:07] might be worshiping their gods if they
[54:08] don't come up and worship they're going
[54:09] to have no reain they're going to have
[54:13] plagues Hallelujah so again no need for
[54:16] the ark the king is there and then
[54:18] remember Satan will deceive them all at
[54:19] the end that's Revelation 20:8 and bring
[54:21] them to Gog and Magog all right great
[54:24] reading nature um all right Caris Isaiah

[57:02] that science has ever done there will be
[57:03] no such things in the world that is to
[57:05] come but it will be God's Own type of
[57:08] civilization that he'll set up in his
[57:11] glorious Reign Hallelujah that's from
[57:13] God's power to transform

[57:29] brandom okay let me
[57:33] sorry oh yeah brother br will there be
[57:36] children during the Thousand Years of
[57:37] the Millennium Reign that's the question
[57:38] in my mind that I told you the other day
[57:41] I don't know it looks a whole lot like
[57:43] it could be it looks a whole lot like it
[57:45] couldn't be I'm going to be as honest
[57:47] with you as I know how to be I don't
[57:49] know at this time I don't know whether
[57:51] there'll be there will be or whether
[57:53] there not be I can't say hallelujah
[57:57] see there brother Ram was learning right
[57:59] he's going by the scripture he's seeing
[58:00] all these scriptures but he doesn't know
[58:01] for
[58:02] sure but as as as I've showed you I've
[58:05] showed you how many verses and you know
[58:06] and all these Micah Jeremiah and Isaiah
[58:09] Zechariah all these Witnesses they all
[58:11] say the same thing right and so we can
[58:13] see there's going to be birth there's
[58:16] going to be death there's going to be
[58:17] sin but there's going to be a holy
[58:19] righteous Everlasting Kingdom
[58:21] Hallelujah I'm trying to find a place to
[58:23] close here by God's grace so just in
[58:25] summary there's there's births there's
[58:27] death there's Sinners there's children
[58:29] there's families there's infants there's
[58:31] marriage if you want to write this down
[58:33] Ezekiel 44 says Israel is going to have
[58:36] natural people too and uh the priests
[58:39] have to marry certain type of women
[58:41] right remember that Ezekiel
[58:43] 44:22 so Israelis the 12 tribes remember
[58:46] they're getting ruled over by the TW
[58:48] Apostles there'll be animal sacrifices
[58:51] Ezekiel 42 Ezekiel 43 Ezekiel 44 Ezekiel
[58:54] 46
[58:57] the Millennium will have survivors from
[58:59] Armageddon we read that the Millennium
[59:00] will have plagues as punishment the TW
[59:03] Apostles will judge the 12 tribes that's
[59:05] Matthew
[59:06] 19:28 Israel's priests will judge the
[59:09] Earth as well Ezekiel 4046 and 44
[59:12] 24 there will be a time for burnings of
[59:15] weapons and burials from Armageddon we
[59:17] saw that there will be answers before we
[59:20] call Hallelujah there'll be Saints
[59:22] ruling up to 10 cities with rods of iron
[59:26] in glorified bodies that's Luke 19:17
[59:28] Revelation 2:26 and 27 Romans 8:30 cu
[59:32] the Bible said he whom God is Justified
[59:35] God is already glorified amen how many
[59:37] Justified here tonight if you're
[59:38] Justified you've already promised I've
[59:40] got a glorified body waiting for me and
[59:43] that's how you'll Reign during the
[59:44] Millennium in a glorified body remember
[59:46] Jesus glorified body it walked through
[59:49] walls in John 2019 the Bible said they
[59:51] shut the doors for fear and then the
[59:53] Bible said Jesus appeared to them so he
[59:56] just walked through the wall then also
[59:59] he showed himself down at the Sea of
[1:00:00] Galilee right and he ate the fish they
[1:00:02] said he said have you hear any meat oh
[1:00:05] there's a deer out there there's some
[1:00:06] good meat out there amen
[1:00:10] hallelujah have you any meat and they
[1:00:12] gave Jesus some fish and Jesus ate the
[1:00:15] fish right in a glorified body so that's
[1:00:17] what we'll have we'll have glorified
[1:00:18] body we still get to enjoy the tastiness
[1:00:21] of nature Hallelujah right talk about
[1:00:22] organic food there Hallelujah we have
[1:00:24] some real real organic food there by
[1:00:26] God's grace no man's science and they're
[1:00:29] not even going to not going to come to
[1:00:30] their mind
[1:00:33] Hallelujah and friends no more Ark of
[1:00:36] the Covenant because the Lord is there
[1:00:38] in fact that's the final verse of
[1:00:40] Ezekiel 48: 35 said they're going to say
[1:00:43] no more uh we going to go no more the
[1:00:46] Ark of the Lord because the Lord is
[1:00:48] there Jesus is there in the holiest of
[1:00:52] holies amen oh we're looking forward to
[1:00:54] that by God's grace let me find a place
[1:00:56] to close
[1:01:00] here I've read you this quote before but
[1:01:02] listen here chapter 6 Church age book
[1:01:05] brother Ram reads the verses about how
[1:01:06] we'll have rods of iron he will have
[1:01:09] power over the Nations think about that
[1:01:10] some of the Saints I imagine Paul will
[1:01:12] have power over Nations Paul because he
[1:01:14] sacrificed more than
[1:01:17] anybody brother Ram says he that who
[1:01:20] keeps doing his Works Faithfully Until
[1:01:23] the End see Church don't give up when
[1:01:25] times get hard don't don't stop doing
[1:01:27] the right thing always do the right
[1:01:28] thing because brother R said if you keep
[1:01:31] keep Faithfully doing it until the end
[1:01:32] you'll be given power over
[1:01:34] Nations even if nobody else does it in
[1:01:36] the church you keep doing what's right
[1:01:38] now hopefully our church will do what's
[1:01:39] right right I'm just saying if nobody
[1:01:40] else does right you do
[1:01:42] right because you're you're going to be
[1:01:44] given power over Nations and brother B
[1:01:46] said you'll be a strong capable
[1:01:49] unbending
[1:01:51] ruler brother says who can cope so
[1:01:54] powerfully with any
[1:01:57] situation right so if a 100-year old
[1:01:59] dies you can you'll know right what to
[1:02:01] do in that
[1:02:02] situation right if if a if a family
[1:02:04] won't go up and worship you'll know
[1:02:05] right what to do in that
[1:02:07] situation because God's given he's
[1:02:09] already given you that Authority he's
[1:02:10] giv you that anointing and a glorified
[1:02:12] body but the way you get that is to do
[1:02:14] what's right right now amen keep doing
[1:02:17] what's right remember Jesus said
[1:02:19] increase your works that's how that's
[1:02:20] the secret of Christianity keep
[1:02:22] increasing your Works don't do less for
[1:02:24] Jesus try to increase it
[1:02:28] Hallelujah brother said even the most
[1:02:31] desperate enemy will be broken if need
[1:02:33] be by you in the
[1:02:34] Millennium the most desperate enemy
[1:02:36] right Egypt right because Egypt's going
[1:02:38] to deserve plagues some some Christians
[1:02:40] are going to have to deal with
[1:02:41] Egypt and call plagues on
[1:02:44] them see but you'll have the character
[1:02:46] that's proven God will be able to trust
[1:02:48] your character because he can trust you
[1:02:50] right now amen right his demonstration
[1:02:55] of rule by power will be like unto the
[1:02:57] very Son of God brother man said this is
[1:02:59] very amazing he
[1:03:01] says amen my unless we suffer with him
[1:03:05] we cannot reign with him you have to
[1:03:07] suffer to rain that's the reason for
[1:03:10] this is that character simply never made
[1:03:12] without suffering character is a victory
[1:03:15] not a gift Hallelujah a man without
[1:03:18] character can't Reign because power
[1:03:21] apart from character is
[1:03:23] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:03:26] to rule amen we just saw another Mega
[1:03:28] preacher this week fall into some sin
[1:03:30] and he had he's been pastoring 48 years
[1:03:32] he has a worldwide Ministry all over the
[1:03:34] radio internet and he had he said I had
[1:03:36] a sinful uh sinful act years ago but it
[1:03:39] wasn't illegal so that tells us what it
[1:03:41] was it was probably adultery or
[1:03:42] something like that and after 48 years
[1:03:44] of everybody looking to him he's this
[1:03:46] leader he falls see he doesn't have the
[1:03:49] character right right he doesn't have
[1:03:51] the character he might have had it for a
[1:03:53] few for a number of years but at some
[1:03:54] point his character uh it failed cuz he
[1:03:58] wasn't born again he lets his daughter
[1:04:00] preach his daughter's a preacher see
[1:04:03] that's not character that's fit to rule
[1:04:05] right a woman is to be silent right
[1:04:08] according to the word of God see this
[1:04:11] just again provu us no matter how big a
[1:04:13] kingdoms these people have or big
[1:04:14] influence what matters is Christlike
[1:04:16] character Hallelujah Jesus is watching
[1:04:19] Hallelujah and see a man that does have
[1:04:21] the real Holy Ghost his you know that
[1:04:23] that satanic influence is going to catch
[1:04:25] up to him it's going to catch up and
[1:04:29] brother mam said he won't be sitting on
[1:04:30] the father's throne but we want to have
[1:04:32] the character where Jesus can trust us
[1:04:34] to sit on the throne hallelujah amen
[1:04:38] Amen brother Braham said all wrongs will
[1:04:42] be made right in the Millennium so if
[1:04:45] anyone's ever done you wrong if
[1:04:47] anything's happened that's wrong in this
[1:04:48] case he's talking about marriage if
[1:04:50] anything's been done wrong he said all
[1:04:52] wrongs will be made right there that's
[1:04:55] why this is such an important time
[1:04:58] Hallelujah if we can do everything
[1:05:01] everything in our power now to follow
[1:05:03] Christ he'll make everything right there
[1:05:06] we'll have the our ordained position our
[1:05:08] ordained Authority everything God
[1:05:09] ordained us to be we'll fulfill it in
[1:05:12] that land in the Millennium amen
[1:05:17] hallelujah all right let me see anything
[1:05:19] else here I want to bring
[1:05:21] out I think that's it let's stand to our
[1:05:24] feet by God's grace did you enjoy that
[1:05:27] hour and five minutes that wasn't too
[1:05:28] long Hallelujah I preach I preach hour
[1:05:30] and a half Thursday night at at Junction
[1:05:32] City by God's grace God bless you all
