[25:03] the birds singing i said lord i want to
[25:05] lift my hands to you so i stood up there

[25:08] i raised my hand i said i want to sing
[25:09] that church on wednesday but i didn't

[25:29] ephesians chapter three
[25:31] let's look at uh verse four well you
[25:34] know let's
[25:35] go back to verse three it's been a few
[25:36] weeks since i minister on this i want to
[25:37] get back to this series here
[25:39] uh we're kind of taking some and i was
[25:41] of course studying on the name of god
[25:42] today i just have time to get it all
[25:43] together
[25:44] it's a tremendous subject uh so let's go
[25:47] back to this series here and then maybe
[25:48] lord willing sunday we'll look back at
[25:50] the name of god again
[25:53] verse 3 says how that by revelation he
[25:55] made known unto me the mystery
[25:57] who do you make known the mystery to
[25:58] paul jesus christ made known this
[26:01] mystery to paul
[26:05] as i wrote before in few words verse 4
[26:07] whereby when you read you may understand
[26:09] my knowledge in the mystery of christ
[26:10] and that's something
[26:11] all they had to do was just read this
[26:13] and god would show them the mystery
[26:15] that's all they had to do they just had
[26:17] to read this epistle have an open heart
[26:19] and then god would show them the
[26:20] revelation of the mystery
[26:22] what a privilege look at the power of
[26:24] reading look at the power of reading
[26:28] verse 5 which in other ages was not made
[26:31] known unto the sons of men
[26:32] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[26:34] apostles and prophets by the spirit
[26:36] let's read verse six together ready
[26:38] one two three that the gentiles should
[26:40] be
[26:41] fellow heirs and of the same body and
[26:44] partakers of his promise
[26:46] in christ by the gospel amen let's go to
[26:49] isaiah 41 we'll read our memory verse
[26:52] for the month of june
[26:54] i may push this into july 2 brother amen
[26:56] if that's okay you know because
[26:57] we missed a few weeks there uh
[27:00] so i would like to maybe push it ahead
[27:03] such a beautiful verse here listen
[27:06] this is like the verse you want to hear
[27:07] every day
[27:10] don't be afraid right trust in the lord
[27:12] be strong and courageous
[27:17] isaiah 41 verse 10. pardon me
[27:24] let's read this together on three one
[27:26] two three
[27:27] fear thou not for i am with thee
[27:30] be not dismayed for i am thy god
[27:34] i will strengthen thee yea i will help
[27:37] thee
[27:38] yea i will uphold thee with the right
[27:40] hand of my righteousness how many can
[27:42] say amen to that
[27:44] i look george just can you leave that
[27:45] out there real quick before you're
[27:46] seated remember we looked on sunday
[27:47] night about i
[27:48] am i am not afraid right
[27:52] i am surrounded by god because he says i
[27:54] am with thee
[27:56] i am not dismayed
[27:59] i am a child of god i am strong because
[28:02] god's strengthening me i mean you can
[28:04] take all these
[28:05] and see what the i am has made you amen
[28:08] may god has blessing reading his word
[28:09] may be seated that's why that sermon is
[28:11] an unending sermon
[28:13] every promise in the bible is yours
[28:17] praise god is ours so if you would
[28:18] switch over here i just want to uh
[28:20] i'd like to just you know kind of
[28:22] background a little bit uh
[28:25] with this new book lord willing it
[28:27] should come out next month it was
[28:28] supposed to come out this month but we
[28:29] had a little delay
[28:30] the the gentleman who's formatting it uh
[28:32] it's he does two jobs kind of like me
[28:35] uh so uh he won't he didn't have time to
[28:37] get it all done but
[28:38] uh hopefully he'll come out next month
[28:40] but it's just an update on what i preach
[28:42] to you right now we're finishing up this
[28:44] one i got maybe a three
[28:45] maybe three or four more sermons on this
[28:46] one we're winning and then i probably
[28:49] preach the godhead next i'll shorten
[28:50] that up because that's
[28:51] a very familiar subject i just want to
[28:53] review though with you a few things
[28:56] because like i said on sunday every time
[28:57] brother branham mentions the mark of the
[28:58] beast
[28:59] he always mentions the mark in the
[29:01] forehead with trinitarianism
[29:04] notice it's in the forehead and brother
[29:06] in the church age book mentions
[29:07] trinitarianism
[29:09] and so denominations the way that uh the
[29:12] way the beast is going to deceive many
[29:14] people
[29:15] is by throwing out well if you're not
[29:17] trinitarian
[29:18] you don't get to buy and sell right
[29:20] that's going to be
[29:21] part of the deception to get them to
[29:24] join along
[29:25] with the image of the beast which is the
[29:26] world council of churches right
[29:28] so i just want to review that lord
[29:29] willing after we finish this one i want
[29:31] to review
[29:32] what the creeds actually say the creeds
[29:34] are full of contradictions right
[29:35] and i want to i want to just go over the
[29:37] last mystery the last mystery about the
[29:38] godhead is the use of plural pronouns
[29:41] like let us and jesus says the glory
[29:44] that we shared
[29:45] before the foundation of the world okay
[29:48] that's the only remaining mystery to me
[29:50] about the godhead
[29:51] and i just got an email on it today from
[29:52] somebody overseas so i i answered them
[29:54] right back because i've been thinking
[29:55] about it
[29:56] but uh i just kind of want to just i'll
[29:58] really shorten that one the lord willing
[30:00] uh of course we'll go over jesus baptism
[30:02] and we'll kind of go over those things a
[30:04] little shortly
[30:05] and uh seven stars that's the seven
[30:07] church ages that's really familiar
[30:09] i'll probably just hit the highlights on
[30:10] that one uh and then i've preached all
[30:12] 12 mysteries to you in their fullness
[30:15] and in the fullness of what's going to
[30:17] be in the book and uh so the next screen
[30:19] is what i've read through this week so
[30:22] this gentleman uh his name is james he
[30:24] edited my whole book he said this is the
[30:26] final draft he said read it one more
[30:28] time
[30:29] and so uh this week i've read 600 or 700
[30:32] pages
[30:33] no 600 pages i've just been reading all
[30:35] the time reading reading reading
[30:36] trying to find am i writing out all the
[30:38] mistakes you know because there's
[30:39] different mistakes when you
[30:40] transition a document over to a
[30:41] different program so i've read through
[30:43] all the ones with checks i've
[30:44] right so right now i'm on chapter 10 11
[30:47] 12 and then i have to read 13 hopefully
[30:50] i'll get it done by saturday
[30:52] and then i can send it to him and say
[30:53] hey it's done buddy it's done
[30:55] and now he's hoping he's hoping this can
[30:57] be one book now
[30:58] which i would love that uh two would be
[31:00] fun you know or not fun but two would be
[31:02] very uh
[31:04] symbolic because the bread had two
[31:06] stacks
[31:07] two would be very uh symbolic but one
[31:10] would be easier
[31:12] because then you would just have it and
[31:14] brother william i don't know if i showed
[31:15] you this but here's the potential cover
[31:17] of it that's what it looks like
[31:18] the 12 new testament mysteries revealed
[31:21] so lord willing next month it should
[31:22] come out
[31:23] it was going to be two books but it
[31:24] might be one book now we'll see
[31:26] it kind of depends what the gentleman
[31:28] says now here's the thought behind this
[31:30] brother branham said in the
[31:31] services of the end time he says now the
[31:34] sounding fourth this messenger the
[31:36] seventh angel here signing forth his
[31:37] message
[31:38] notice the type of message it wasn't to
[31:40] the first angel it wasn't to the second
[31:41] third four fifth sixth
[31:43] but it's the seventh angel that had this
[31:44] type of message what is it
[31:47] he said notice this type of message
[31:48] finishing all the mysteries of god that
[31:50] are written in the book
[31:52] right now we know there's mysteries that
[31:53] are not in the book like jesus's new
[31:55] name
[31:56] right like the other new names and
[31:58] there's different there's different
[31:59] names the bible says you'll get a new
[32:01] name
[32:01] in the in the future home so there's
[32:04] some mysteries that are not written in
[32:06] the book
[32:06] right but all the mysteries that are in
[32:08] the book should be revealed at the end
[32:10] time
[32:11] okay brother ram says the seventh angel
[32:13] is winding up all the mysteries that's
[32:15] laying loose
[32:16] out ended out throughout these
[32:17] organizations denominations the seventh
[32:19] angel gathers him up
[32:20] and finishes the entire mystery that's
[32:23] what the bible said
[32:24] finishes the mysteries written in the
[32:25] book right
[32:28] now let's know a few of these mysteries
[32:30] if you want to write them down
[32:32] he said first i'll take what schofield
[32:33] says
[32:35] in matthew 13. if you'd like to take
[32:37] some of them down if you haven't got a
[32:38] scofield bible you might read what he
[32:40] thinks some of the mysteries are
[32:41] so then he reads scofield's list in your
[32:43] scofield bible
[32:44] he lists 11 of them but i went to the
[32:47] scripture
[32:48] and it's just my personal opinion and i
[32:50] looked up every time the word mysteries
[32:52] in the new testament 27 times
[32:55] so i just went through every time the
[32:57] bible said mystery
[32:58] and i found 12 of them are actually
[33:00] doctrines
[33:02] okay and that's where i got the 12
[33:04] mysteries from
[33:06] so brother brahm says the seventh angel
[33:07] has to take all the mysteries that are
[33:09] in the bible
[33:10] and then finish them up he did and
[33:13] that's what i'm writing the book about
[33:15] praise god and it's a privilege to do it
[33:17] because i've never seen the bible tied
[33:19] together before
[33:20] like this and you know brother james
[33:22] browning before he passed away i
[33:23] preached a sermon at the church up there
[33:25] and he kind of joked with me a little
[33:26] bit i think i preached like two hours
[33:28] one time at the church
[33:29] and he said boy brother jesse said i
[33:30] really enjoyed your sermon you preached
[33:32] the whole bible today
[33:34] and i said thank you but i thought how
[33:37] fitting because here i'm tying the whole
[33:40] bible together with brother abraham's
[33:42] revelations
[33:44] because all the mysteries that are in
[33:46] the book
[33:47] have to be finished that's according to
[33:49] revelation 10
[33:50] 7. right all right so i just thought i'd
[33:53] rehearse that because i thought it would
[33:54] be a
[33:55] a little blessing there if you can see
[33:57] so that's what i do had to go through
[33:58] all these every time the bible used the
[34:00] word mystery
[34:01] all 27 of them and you have to see you
[34:04] have to
[34:04] you have to use the discernment of the
[34:05] holy spirit which one was a doctrine
[34:07] which one was just
[34:08] speaking of general mysteries right so
[34:11] that's what we've done by the grace of
[34:12] the lord so
[34:13] i'm going to uh detach this here you can
[34:15] get back to some scriptures here
[34:17] hope that was just i just want to review
[34:19] real quick here
[34:20] on that topic i think it's a really
[34:22] important topic
[34:24] um i know there's less and less people
[34:27] going to be saved so i'm not expecting a
[34:28] lot of people to read the book
[34:30] but i'm expecting all the predestinated
[34:32] to read the book
[34:34] that's what i'm expecting right so i
[34:37] trust the lord will grant that by his
[34:38] grace and by his mercy i'm excited and
[34:40] hopefully i can finish this week send it
[34:42] off to him and say there it is it's all
[34:43] done it's in your hands get it out
[34:45] get it get it there on amazon so it's
[34:48] ready to go
[34:50] all right so uh i'll just background you
[34:52] know briefly we've been looking at the
[34:53] mystery of the one church
[34:55] and i'm just gonna just quickly go
[34:57] through here this is part seven
[34:59] so the mystery of the one church is that
[35:01] the jew and gentile
[35:03] everyone that's born again is part of
[35:05] god's family and they're entitled to all
[35:07] the rights
[35:08] benefits and future inheritances this
[35:11] was a
[35:11] major issue in the bible days which
[35:14] we'll get to it's not a big issue now
[35:15] because we're westerners
[35:17] right we've lived in a a christian
[35:19] judeo-christian
[35:20] uh uh culture for over over 250 years
[35:24] right with
[35:25] united states so we're used to it where
[35:27] you say oh yeah anybody can be a
[35:28] christian now
[35:29] but before it was well only jews could
[35:31] be christians and then god had to give
[35:33] this revelation to paul to say no
[35:35] gentiles can be christians too and
[35:37] that's a great revelation
[35:39] this was all foretold by many prophets
[35:41] in the old testament
[35:42] even by god himself jesus though had to
[35:45] first offer the gospel to the jews
[35:47] once they rejected it god gave the keys
[35:50] to peter
[35:50] he opened the door of the holy ghost to
[35:52] jews samaritans
[35:54] and then gentiles praise god and then
[35:56] god save paul
[35:58] and god god say paul this man who hated
[36:00] gentiles
[36:01] god sent him to the gentiles as a great
[36:04] paradox praise god
[36:05] and and then paul gets his own
[36:08] dispensation which is a stewardship
[36:10] paul had a stewardship he had an
[36:11] overseeing job to make sure
[36:13] the true gospel got to the gentiles
[36:15] praise god
[36:16] as peter had to make sure the gospel got
[36:18] to the jews amen
[36:20] and then paul there's a moment paul
[36:22] started going to the jews but then
[36:23] he had to turn he said lo we turn to the
[36:25] gentiles so you know he made a turn in
[36:27] acts 13
[36:28] and he started going to the gentiles but
[36:30] then we saw
[36:31] paul's gospel was the judgment standard
[36:35] on the day of pentecost every person
[36:37] i'll be judged brother william you'll be
[36:39] judged but amen
[36:40] we'll all be judged by paul's gospel
[36:42] praise god so i want to make sure that
[36:44] my life lines up with it right now
[36:46] praise god that there's no surprises
[36:48] right we know the bible says the secrets
[36:50] of hearts will be made known on that day
[36:52] but we shouldn't have any secrets we
[36:55] should have
[36:56] everything confess everything under the
[36:58] blood praise god
[37:00] because we're walking in the light as he
[37:02] is in the light
[37:03] and the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[37:05] us from all unrighteousness
[37:07] so we should have no secrets all of our
[37:09] seekers should be confessed now
[37:10] anything in our heart we can just
[37:12] confess and then the bible says he'll
[37:14] forgive us of all unrighteousness
[37:16] amen but there'll be many secrets of
[37:18] people made known on that day
[37:21] people we wondered why they leave the
[37:22] message or uh do they
[37:24] they hung around the church but do they
[37:25] really believe well there'll be no
[37:27] secrets on that day they'll be all made
[37:29] known on that great screen in the sky
[37:31] right all the lives will be played back
[37:33] and all the answers
[37:35] during the our lifetime they'll be
[37:37] they'll be fulfilled right
[37:40] right and so we're we're looking forward
[37:43] uh in that time to sit with jesus
[37:46] so he can use our lives as a judgment
[37:49] standard
[37:51] so we're not being judged that will
[37:52] actually take place before the marriage
[37:54] supper right
[37:55] uh with the he'll pro he'll present you
[37:57] know uh
[37:58] christ i'm sorry brother abraham the
[37:59] messenger will present the people to
[38:01] christ as a chaste virgin
[38:03] paul said that paul will present his
[38:05] group and then irenaeus
[38:07] uh and martin and all the way down you
[38:10] know
[38:10] to brother brandon brother branham will
[38:12] present us as the bride to christ
[38:14] by god's grace and then we'll get
[38:17] rewards for what we've done praise god
[38:20] and then we'll have communion with the
[38:22] lord jesus praise god
[38:23] he'll drink of the cup anew amen he'll
[38:26] partake of the bread again amen
[38:29] amen and the bible said there he'll
[38:31] start wiping away tears from our eyes
[38:34] amen we'll weep and cry we made it over
[38:37] by the grace of god we didn't deserve it
[38:40] but god's grace was sufficient amen in
[38:43] my weakness
[38:44] his strength was perfect amen he made a
[38:47] way that i could be over here and have
[38:49] communion with him praise god
[38:50] amen and then you know uh after we see
[38:54] that we looked at paul
[38:55] he started teaching on this revelation
[38:58] out of
[38:59] uh the book of ephesians i'm sorry
[39:02] i'm sorry we looked at galatians first
[39:03] i'm sorry look at romans first then
[39:05] corinthians then galatians
[39:07] now we're in ephesians and uh and so now
[39:10] we're in ephesians three so let's go
[39:12] there we'll kind of pick up right there
[39:14] in chapter three i'm sorry chapter two
[39:17] rather
[39:19] paul gave two pictures of this jew
[39:22] gentile church
[39:23] he said they were like two men but now
[39:26] they're one man right
[39:28] he said christ is the head but the jew
[39:31] gentile
[39:32] are the one body so we need the jewish
[39:36] saints just like you need your
[39:37] right hand and your left hand right
[39:41] we need uh we need the uh we need the
[39:43] european saints just like we need the
[39:45] american saints
[39:46] right we need every every believer from
[39:50] every nation
[39:51] is a part of the body of christ but
[39:53] christ is the head
[39:54] he tells us all what to do
[39:58] and so he says out of twain he made one
[40:00] new man
[40:01] now we ended last time looking at this
[40:04] by the other imagery paul gave
[40:06] we're all one temple jesus christ is the
[40:08] chief cornerstone
[40:10] the apostles and prophets were the
[40:12] foundation stones
[40:13] here we find ourselves at the top of the
[40:16] pyramid amen
[40:17] hallelujah so here we are and we saw the
[40:20] type of it was solomon
[40:22] because solomon didn't build that temple
[40:24] just with jewish help
[40:25] he built it with gentile help jew and
[40:28] gentile work together
[40:30] to make a habitation for the spirit amen
[40:33] what a beautiful time amen of us god
[40:36] building a habitation
[40:38] in other words we are the temple of god
[40:41] that means god is here tonight amen
[40:44] we are the habitation of the holy ghost
[40:46] jew and gentile bonder free
[40:48] male or female right uh a freer bond you
[40:52] know wherever we find
[40:53] ourselves we are the body of christ
[40:55] we're the temple of jesus christ
[40:57] here tonight and we must all have a
[40:59] leading of the holy ghost
[41:01] i ended the sermon with that scripture
[41:03] first corinthians
[41:05] 14 26 point up there though because this
[41:07] is such an encouragement
[41:10] you know each person as i said uh
[41:13] each person needs to have anointing of
[41:15] the holy ghost for every service
[41:18] right now the bible said if i come unto
[41:20] you speaking with tongues
[41:21] i'm sorry 14 26 i'm sorry hon 14 26 my
[41:25] fault
[41:28] brother ram says and he talks about this
[41:29] in the church age book
[41:31] every person needs to be a partaker of
[41:33] the holy ghost and every person
[41:35] has a ministry of the holy ghost how is
[41:37] it then brethren when you come together
[41:38] every one of you have to solve
[41:42] so brother amen brought some psalms
[41:43] tonight so did his wife i heard her
[41:46] sing along real good they must have been
[41:48] practicing at home
[41:50] everybody has a doctor now that might be
[41:51] me tonight i might be bringing a
[41:52] doctrine to you
[41:53] a teaching right an instruction
[41:56] commandment
[41:57] everybody has a tongue we don't see that
[42:00] very much but that's okay we don't want
[42:01] to impersonate it
[42:02] we want the real thing when it comes and
[42:03] it has to be a gift from god
[42:06] we don't want to be impersonation
[42:07] because i know two friends that
[42:09] impersonated it
[42:10] and both have suffered uh suffered very
[42:13] much because of it
[42:16] the one friend he and his fiancee
[42:18] pretended to speak in tongues
[42:19] and within three years of their marriage
[42:21] she committed adultery on him left him
[42:24] and he was a he was a oneness
[42:26] pentecostal preacher
[42:28] and he fell from that because they
[42:30] pretended to speak in tongues
[42:32] then they never sought for the
[42:33] interpretations the other one i played
[42:35] football with
[42:36] a friend i had named greg and uh
[42:40] he told me this the night before we
[42:41] played a football game we're at a hotel
[42:43] together in michigan
[42:44] eastern michigan and we were talking
[42:46] about the word awesome
[42:47] instead talking about football we're
[42:48] talking about the word
[42:51] and he said i said he said have you ever
[42:53] spoken in tongues i said no sir i said
[42:55] i've asked god to let me but i've just
[42:56] never done it the bible said not all
[42:58] speak with tongues
[43:00] he said nor have i he's but then he
[43:02] started crying i said i said greg why
[43:03] are you crying
[43:05] he said because i was at a revival
[43:07] service and everybody was up seeking the
[43:09] holy ghost and they were
[43:10] a tongue's evidence church and the
[43:13] preacher
[43:14] uh put the microphone right in his face
[43:16] because he was an all-state football
[43:17] player he's like a famous
[43:18] high school athlete he said did you
[43:20] receive the holy ghost and he was
[43:22] nervous
[43:23] he was pressured into it so he said yes
[43:25] and the preacher said fine then speak in
[43:26] tongues
[43:28] and so he made it up right there he made
[43:30] up some unknown to
[43:32] and he was crying to me i said greg i
[43:33] said jesus loved you i said
[43:35] i just god will forgive you just say
[43:37] you're sorry can you imagine that
[43:38] impersonating a gift because all the
[43:40] pressure
[43:41] see i don't i want to stay a million
[43:42] miles away from that when it comes
[43:44] let it come genuine i'd rather have
[43:47] genuine than pretend amen
[43:48] we don't want to pressure anybody into
[43:50] anything we want the holy ghost to lead
[43:52] us into something
[43:54] amen lead us great shepherd amen
[43:56] hallelujah
[43:57] we don't want to push and force our way
[43:59] into it we want the holy ghost to lead
[44:01] us into it
[44:02] like humble obedient little lambs amen
[44:05] hallelujah now i do got to write though
[44:08] to compel people to come
[44:10] that means urge it even means pressure
[44:14] i've got to write as a preacher i'm
[44:16] pressuring you i'm urging you to come
[44:17] and
[44:18] be born again right but i don't urge for
[44:20] a gift
[44:21] or urge for the giver i don't know yeah
[44:24] that's right
[44:25] we urge for the giver praise god i tell
[44:27] them every time we do it right we tell
[44:28] them you may speak in tongues you may
[44:30] prophesy
[44:31] you may shout you may scream you may
[44:32] jump you may pass out but one thing you
[44:34] will do
[44:35] you will glorify god amen and you'll
[44:38] have an emotional experience that
[44:40] everybody can see or hear
[44:41] and we think you're drunk praise god
[44:44] that's right
[44:45] see everybody now where how did i get
[44:47] off of that see that everybody have the
[44:48] revelation you're all pulling up real
[44:50] hard i guess
[44:51] everybody hath the revelation unveiling
[44:53] everybody have an interpretation
[44:55] let all things be done in edifying so we
[44:57] ended that if we're a part of the body
[44:59] of christ we want to come to church
[45:01] where i got something to bring now
[45:03] church if we're discouraged and we're
[45:04] just coming to get
[45:06] uh renewed then praise the lord then
[45:08] come thirsty
[45:10] right it happens to me too and i gotta
[45:12] preach sometimes and that's me
[45:14] i'm the one that god helped me i've
[45:16] struggled i've been battled all week i
[45:18] need you to touch me tonight you know
[45:19] sometimes i come like that but sometimes
[45:21] i come all served up by the holy spirit
[45:23] i got a fresh revelation a fresh
[45:25] doctrine
[45:26] i want to bring from the holy spirit and
[45:28] i want to bring that praise god that's
[45:29] my part
[45:30] as the holy ghost-filled christian to
[45:32] help the body of christ
[45:34] amen amen so each one of us must have
[45:37] one of these leadings we'll call it
[45:39] a leading of the holy ghost now
[45:42] in ephesians 3 we read our texts
[45:46] now i'm just gonna go through a few uh
[45:48] points about ephesians three
[45:49] and then we're gonna get to the the next
[45:51] text
[45:52] because paul talks about this mystery uh
[45:55] here in ephesians three now
[45:58] in chapter 3 verse
[46:01] 15 he gives the revelation that the
[46:03] whole family in heaven and earth
[46:05] is named the lord jesus christ
[46:08] hallelujah the whole family is not
[46:10] father son holy ghost
[46:12] the whole family is the lord jesus
[46:13] christ the whole family
[46:15] ain't branham's the whole family is the
[46:17] lord jesus christ amen
[46:19] thank god we love the brahms we love the
[46:21] the reagans the smiths you put your name
[46:23] in there
[46:25] right the least we love everybody praise
[46:27] god but that's not the name of the whole
[46:29] family
[46:30] the whole family is messaged lord jesus
[46:32] christ amen
[46:33] that's the name above all names and so
[46:37] paul gives us revelation this body has
[46:39] one name
[46:41] right she's the the she's the bride of
[46:43] christ
[46:44] christ jesus and they share a name and
[46:46] then he ends chapter three by reminding
[46:48] us
[46:49] in verse 16 that he wants us
[46:51] strengthened
[46:52] with might in our inner man that christ
[46:55] may dwell in your hearts by faith
[46:58] rooted and grounded in love and then in
[47:00] verse 19
[47:01] to know the love of christ so see uh
[47:04] paul wants the holy ghost filled
[47:05] jew or gentile to know how much god
[47:08] loves you
[47:10] he wants you to know the love of christ
[47:12] and that's one thing in the message we
[47:13] don't preach on a whole lot
[47:15] god loves you because that sounds too
[47:17] much like a denominational
[47:18] and it can be it can go overboard right
[47:20] they take it overboard
[47:22] but we cannot forget what the bible says
[47:25] paul says you need to understand what is
[47:27] the breadth
[47:28] the length the depth and the height of
[47:31] god's love are you picturing something
[47:33] big here
[47:34] if god's love could be measured in four
[47:36] dimensions
[47:37] it'd be great love for you and i praise
[47:39] god
[47:41] he said to know the love of christ and
[47:43] be filled with all the fullness of god
[47:45] see the only way we'll be filled with
[47:47] the fullness of god is to remember how
[47:49] much he loves us
[47:53] thank god he loves me amen he provides
[47:56] for he helps me
[47:57] he strengthens me he corrects me he
[48:00] fails me amen he leads me
[48:02] he guides me he loves me amen
[48:05] when you're convinced of god's great
[48:07] love you'll walk in the fullness of his
[48:09] power better
[48:11] that's what paul says see we leave that
[48:13] out sometimes
[48:14] that's why sometimes i listen to some of
[48:15] those mega preachers because
[48:17] i can glean i'm always listening to the
[48:19] message and it's hard and it's cutting
[48:20] but sometimes i just need encouraged
[48:23] right and a lot
[48:25] i mean that's just the nature of it
[48:26] right it's all many times many are
[48:28] cutting and things like that
[48:29] so sometimes i listen and i'll get
[48:31] encouraged i remember how much god loves
[48:34] me
[48:34] but really it's right in the bible there
[48:36] and paul's reminding us this
[48:38] body is love you are love if jesus
[48:41] if jesus was here he'd love his body
[48:44] right
[48:45] you love your body who took a shower
[48:46] today don't raise your hand who took a
[48:48] shower who brushed your teeth today
[48:49] before you come to church
[48:50] that shows how much you love love your
[48:52] body right love your family
[48:55] see and if you take care of your body
[48:57] jesus loves his body amen
[49:00] he takes so he said that's what he's
[49:02] reminding us you are loved
[49:04] you're a part of the family of god amen
[49:06] you're not outside the body
[49:08] you're a part of the body amen remember
[49:11] how much he loves you
[49:12] because he says in verse 20 it's the
[49:13] power of god
[49:15] working in us anything good out of our
[49:18] lives wasn't us
[49:20] it was the power of god in us amen that
[49:23] makes us happy that makes us rejoice
[49:25] because we can see we we finally got
[49:27] humble enough so god can use us
[49:31] remember he said humble yourself in the
[49:33] sight of the lord he'll lift you up
[49:35] see whenever something good happens you
[49:36] humble yourself so god can pick you up
[49:39] that little humble life that you have
[49:40] you lay yourself at the altar
[49:42] he lifts you up he uses you and then he
[49:44] sets you back down don't don't try to
[49:46] come up stay low
[49:48] just say hello so he can use you again
[49:50] right somebody gets healed when you pray
[49:52] for him
[49:52] that's god lifting you up right because
[49:54] he could use you
[49:56] he knew you went in glory to but then
[49:57] you got to go back got to stay back down
[49:59] there
[49:59] he can lift you up again let's be humble
[50:01] in the sight of the lord we'll see god's
[50:03] power in us
[50:06] amen now
[50:10] chapter i'm just gonna skip to the end
[50:13] we
[50:13] we know chapter four and five quite well
[50:16] uh with
[50:17] marriage and uh the fivefold ministry
[50:20] now look how he ends this uh book
[50:22] ephesians 6
[50:23] 18 honey if you can pull it up there
[50:25] ephesians 6 18.
[50:27] i've just been more amazed and and just
[50:29] the profound nature of this
[50:32] idea of the mystery of the jew and
[50:34] gentile church
[50:37] praying always now he's talking about
[50:38] the armor of god right when we have the
[50:40] armor of god we're praying
[50:42] so if we're not praying we've got to put
[50:43] on the armor got to put on the armor of
[50:45] god right
[50:46] praying always with all prayer and
[50:48] supplication in the spirit and watching
[50:50] there unto you with all perseverance and
[50:51] supplication for all saints
[50:53] and for me pray for me that utterance
[50:55] may be given unto me that i may open my
[50:57] mouth boldly
[50:58] to make known the mystery of the gospel
[51:03] paul said pray for me that i'll get a
[51:05] door open
[51:06] to reveal the mystery of the gospel
[51:10] for which i am an ambassador in bonds
[51:13] that's why he was in prison
[51:15] because he was preaching the revelation
[51:16] that jesus christ is the messiah
[51:19] for both jew and gentile praise god
[51:22] the jews i was just i'm finishing up
[51:23] acts the book of the book of acts i'm in
[51:25] acts 27
[51:26] i think i'll do 28 tomorrow finish it up
[51:28] that's why he was in prison the jews
[51:30] hated him because he was saying your
[51:31] messiah is here
[51:33] the mystery the christ now that a
[51:35] messiah has come
[51:36] and the mystery of us he's not going to
[51:38] take over rome he's going to take over
[51:40] you
[51:41] hallelujah now eventually he'll take
[51:43] over the world systems
[51:44] but he wants to rule you they were
[51:46] looking for a natural ruler take over
[51:48] rome take over caesar
[51:50] and jesus said i want to rule you amen
[51:53] hallelujah
[51:54] because the kingdom of god is within us
[51:58] amen thank god amen
[52:01] that's why paul is in prison preaching
[52:04] the revelation of the mystery
[52:06] they hated it we love it
[52:10] that's why they call us holy rollers and
[52:11] they call satanists or whatever they
[52:13] want to call us
[52:14] but we love the revelation of jesus
[52:15] christ
[52:17] to them we're called heresy but uh but
[52:19] to us
[52:20] they're heretics right that's right
[52:24] verse 20 that there and i may speak
[52:26] boldly
[52:27] as i ought to speak so paul knew he best
[52:31] represented christ and the mystery of
[52:33] god
[52:34] when he spoke boldly amen
[52:38] okay now moving on let's go to
[52:41] colossians
[52:44] i'm just going to hit a few verses in
[52:45] colossians now colossians
[52:48] uh is a city about a hundred miles east
[52:51] of ephesus paul went there after he
[52:53] went to ephesus right uh the church
[52:55] actually started through epiphanes
[52:57] epiphyses was a prayer war you remember
[52:59] paul said he's always labor and prayer
[53:01] for you
[53:02] he was a real prayer warrior god used
[53:04] him as a missionary epiphys
[53:06] i've always liked to name a child i
[53:07] profess them i always joke around with
[53:08] my wife okay
[53:09] would that be a beautiful name maybe one
[53:13] of my grandchildren at the lord teresa
[53:16] i just love that name just because of
[53:18] who prayer warrior that started the
[53:19] church of colosse
[53:23] uh now this book is best known
[53:26] for being the most complete expression
[53:29] of the godhead
[53:31] right talks about the he's the image of
[53:34] the invisible god
[53:35] right brother random preached two
[53:37] sermons and this was his text
[53:39] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[53:41] and the unveiling of god that's what he
[53:42] talks about in morphe
[53:44] right how christ changes mass he changes
[53:46] form god always changing his mask
[53:49] right so
[53:52] you know in chapter one he says the
[53:54] mystery of christ
[53:56] in you the hope of glory praise god now
[53:58] that's a mystery we've already preached
[54:00] i've spent a lot of time on that the
[54:01] baptism holy ghost
[54:02] uh we made there's a few things i didn't
[54:04] get to remember i kind of left off on
[54:06] the soul do you remember when i was
[54:07] working with a soul a while ago and i
[54:09] was really getting into some new things
[54:11] for me on the soul hopefully for youtube
[54:13] i kind of stopped there and went to the
[54:15] next one but there was actually more i
[54:16] needed to preach on that
[54:17] but uh we'll see what the lord does but
[54:20] just go ahead to chapter 3 verse 10
[54:22] colossians 3 verse 10.
[54:25] just you'll you'll start see here where
[54:27] he starts laying in how
[54:29] the new man treats everybody with love
[54:33] now this is related to the jew gentile
[54:35] church
[54:37] okay colossians 3 verse 10.
[54:42] and i'm gonna maybe read it out of my
[54:44] bible here
[54:45] and have put on the new man which is
[54:47] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[54:49] him that created him so see are you in
[54:52] the image of christ that's what you
[54:53] should be
[54:54] when you put on the new man you put it
[54:56] on christ right
[54:58] where there is neither greek nor jew
[55:01] okay so there's neither jew nor gentile
[55:03] circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian
[55:05] scothian
[55:06] skythian bond or free but christ is
[55:10] all and in all wow christ can be
[55:13] enslaved
[55:14] yes christ can be in the free yes
[55:18] christ can be in the gentile christ can
[55:20] mean the jew
[55:21] he says christ is all and in all
[55:25] put on therefore as the elect of god
[55:27] holy and beloved
[55:28] biles i'm sorry bowels of mercies
[55:32] kindness humbleness of mind meekness
[55:35] long-suffering
[55:36] forbearing one another
[55:39] and forgiving one another if any man
[55:41] have a quarrel against any even as
[55:43] christ forgave you so also do ye now i
[55:45] wonder how many people really do that
[55:47] how many people forgive their their
[55:49] their friends and their church members
[55:51] and their family
[55:52] like christ forgives them christ does it
[55:55] instantly
[55:56] right you say jesus forgive me you're
[55:58] forgiven
[56:00] right but someone does us wrong i gotta
[56:02] think about it for a few weeks
[56:04] i ain't gonna text them back today
[56:07] you're right
[56:07] i'm gonna call them back today they're
[56:08] gonna talk to me tomorrow
[56:10] maybe next week you see the
[56:13] the new man when you're a part of this
[56:15] body you aim to be just like christ
[56:20] and so jews would have had a hard time
[56:21] with that so were the gentiles right
[56:23] because gentiles were always mistreated
[56:25] by jews
[56:26] right if the jews would walk by a
[56:29] samaritan and go
[56:30] walk on the other side of the street
[56:31] what would they do to a jew i'm sorry a
[56:33] gentile rather
[56:34] they would do the same thing right they
[56:37] would not
[56:38] they want nothing with a samaritan they
[56:40] don't want nothing with a gentile
[56:41] so there was hurt feelings on both sides
[56:44] but somebody who's got the new man
[56:46] someone who's manifesting christ someone
[56:48] who's in the image of christ
[56:49] who's put on the image of christ will
[56:52] forbear with them
[56:53] love them treat them just the same as
[56:55] their own family members praise god
[56:58] because they're in a new family
[57:00] hallelujah
[57:02] verse 14 and above all these things
[57:06] put on competition did i read that right
[57:10] no don't compete against your friends
[57:13] put on
[57:13] charity see which is the bond of
[57:17] perfectness so charity is like the glue
[57:20] that makes us complete
[57:22] right love makes us feel like one body
[57:25] one family praise god
[57:26] it makes us feel like everything's good
[57:28] here you know some people struggle i fee
[57:30] i don't feel like my church feels like
[57:32] home and and you know
[57:33] some people may feel that well the thing
[57:35] to do is fall in love with everybody
[57:37] because love is the bond of perfectness
[57:40] why don't you love people are you trying
[57:42] to love them
[57:43] right i know it's hard to love some
[57:45] people it's probably hard to love me
[57:46] right we can all be hard to love at
[57:48] times but we have to take
[57:50] on with to put on christ amen don't put
[57:53] on the world
[57:54] put on christ amen then you're easy love
[57:57] because christ forgave me last night
[57:59] this morning with my mistake or
[58:00] yesterday christ forgave me easily i can
[58:02] easily forgive you
[58:04] because i'm close with christ
[58:08] how many churches you know act like that
[58:11] that's a challenge it's a challenge
[58:14] verse 15 let the peace of god rule in
[58:16] your hearts
[58:18] see let god's peace rule your hearts
[58:21] peace
[58:24] to which also you are called in one body
[58:26] and be
[58:28] thankful all right
[58:31] so i think i'll stop right there for a
[58:33] moment so see paul addresses the same id
[58:35] he has to write to the ephesians
[58:36] and if you know your bible the
[58:37] colossians letter is very familiar or
[58:39] very similar to the ephesian letter it's
[58:41] just a little shorter
[58:43] he doesn't hit everything but this one
[58:44] is especially known for the godhead
[58:46] revelation
[58:47] but he he he repeats this to the saints
[58:50] in colosse
[58:52] he said you can't treat people
[58:53] differently you've got to treat
[58:55] everybody the same
[58:57] and by the way we gave some examples a
[58:58] few weeks ago
[59:00] in message churches most people i'm
[59:03] sorry
[59:03] in message churches there's a problem
[59:05] sometimes with the rich people
[59:07] mistreating the poor james talked about
[59:09] that in james chapter two
[59:12] right they'll see a rich guy coming oh
[59:13] you sit right here you richmond and i'm
[59:15] gonna make sure i pass the basket right
[59:16] to you
[59:18] got an offering today
[59:19] [Laughter]
[59:21] a bunch of hypocrites right and the poor
[59:23] guy that just walked by him
[59:24] he don't have no money now that that
[59:28] would be a common example of
[59:30] discrimination in messed
[59:31] churches or any church
[59:35] now for me let me be honest for me
[59:37] sometimes it's hard
[59:38] i think it may be for other people too
[59:40] if people come to church and they're
[59:42] they haven't brushed their teeth or they
[59:44] haven't done their hair
[59:46] right just for me as a i look and i look
[59:48] at people's faces sometimes i think
[59:50] um i hope they don't like spit on me or
[59:52] something like that you know
[59:54] you know and so that's just me you know
[59:57] every day i go to school so i have to
[59:58] brush you
[59:59] look like a looked like i took care of
[1:00:01] myself you know
[1:00:03] but you know that's just honesty you
[1:00:04] know um
[1:00:07] and so we have to make sure the love of
[1:00:09] christ shines through
[1:00:10] any fears right
[1:00:14] so money physical appearance
[1:00:17] uh right maybe uh the physical
[1:00:19] attraction and people
[1:00:21] they're just me or even their youth the
[1:00:23] youth oh it's easier to talk to young
[1:00:24] people because i'm young or something
[1:00:25] like that
[1:00:26] i like talking to old people there's
[1:00:27] people that are like that they don't
[1:00:28] want to talk to old people right
[1:00:30] we've had people leave this church
[1:00:32] because we were too young and they
[1:00:33] wanted to fellowship with older people
[1:00:36] we love them i still love them but
[1:00:38] that's why they left now church
[1:00:39] the word the reason wasn't the word it
[1:00:42] was the fellowship
[1:00:44] they loved the word but they just didn't
[1:00:46] feel like they fit in well
[1:00:47] there's a there's a solution that it's
[1:00:49] called the glue of love
[1:00:51] love will keep you glued together right
[1:00:54] and i'm not telling you you have to you
[1:00:55] know stay at one church
[1:00:56] you go wherever the lord leads you but
[1:00:58] if god calls you to a church
[1:01:00] there's always going to be struggles
[1:01:02] just like with them
[1:01:03] they had struggles jew and gentile man
[1:01:05] this guy ate pork i've been on a kosher
[1:01:07] diet
[1:01:07] my whole life i'm supposed to eat with
[1:01:09] this guy
[1:01:11] that was a problem but the love of god
[1:01:14] should bring them together and they can
[1:01:16] sit down at the same table
[1:01:19] or at least hug write your handshake or
[1:01:21] something like that
[1:01:23] instead of saying i i'm not going to sit
[1:01:24] with you this is a great mystery paul
[1:01:27] said
[1:01:28] but it was revealed to him by jesus
[1:01:29] christ don't discriminate against people
[1:01:31] because of their diet
[1:01:32] because their skin color their age their
[1:01:35] mind
[1:01:36] their financial status if christ is in
[1:01:39] you
[1:01:40] christ loves all he's in all and he
[1:01:42] loves all
[1:01:44] praise god how many know churches that
[1:01:46] could use some preaching like that
[1:01:49] sure every church could i could we all
[1:01:51] we all could but see that's why this
[1:01:53] revelation is so important people just
[1:01:54] gloss right over oh we too many
[1:01:56] mysteries too many mysteries well you
[1:01:58] haven't even received the revelation of
[1:01:59] how to treat somebody
[1:02:01] because you favor rich people or you
[1:02:03] favor sisters or you favor brothers
[1:02:05] or you favor preachers you just talk to
[1:02:06] the preachers if a guy's not a preacher
[1:02:08] you won't talk to him
[1:02:10] see they haven't even got the revelation
[1:02:12] of this mystery yet
[1:02:13] that christ doesn't look at all those
[1:02:15] things there's neither bond nor free
[1:02:18] jew nor greek preacher or not preacher
[1:02:20] song leader or not song leader
[1:02:22] right it's none of that it's all love
[1:02:25] because love conquers all things amen
[1:02:27] love cast out all fear amen amen
[1:02:31] oh we don't need the mysteries well you
[1:02:33] surely could if you're discriminating
[1:02:34] against poor people
[1:02:36] you surely could use this revelation
[1:02:39] oh i love the word of god don't you
[1:02:41] these are things that people
[1:02:42] see if they don't humble themselves and
[1:02:44] dig deeper in the word they'll never see
[1:02:46] these things
[1:02:47] right you gotta we actually have to
[1:02:49] preach what paul preached
[1:02:51] right yeah right we're resting on what
[1:02:54] paul preached right
[1:02:55] we're all resting on that we're all
[1:02:57] shouting we're resting on what paul
[1:02:59] preached right
[1:03:00] well he preached it so why are more
[1:03:02] message churches doing it well they
[1:03:03] maybe
[1:03:04] it's not the time for yet or maybe
[1:03:06] they're ignoring the word of god
[1:03:07] let it not uh we pray it's not that last
[1:03:09] one we pray it's not that one
[1:03:11] now colossians 4 let's see how the book
[1:03:13] ends colossians 4. just a beautiful book
[1:03:17] he echoes the same prayer now look at
[1:03:19] that praying
[1:03:20] god please give me a chance to share the
[1:03:23] mystery with someone
[1:03:25] that's why i wrote the book brother
[1:03:26] william it took me 26 months to write
[1:03:27] that book
[1:03:28] and now all these other months i'm
[1:03:30] trying to edit that book but you know
[1:03:31] why i'm doing it
[1:03:32] because people need to know the mystery
[1:03:36] just like you edit all those magazines
[1:03:37] that's right that's awesome
[1:03:39] see because you had a burden you wanted
[1:03:41] to see somebody be blessed
[1:03:43] right you want to see someone else
[1:03:45] receive the same revelation you did
[1:03:49] you're not content with you having the
[1:03:51] knowledge of god
[1:03:52] you want to share it with somebody else
[1:03:54] praise god that they can experience the
[1:03:56] same christ that you love
[1:03:58] amen colossians 4 2 continue in prayer
[1:04:02] watching the same with thanksgiving see
[1:04:04] be thankful
[1:04:04] all the time be thankful don't be down
[1:04:07] the gutters
[1:04:09] don't be discontent be thankful
[1:04:12] if god wanted me to have that i'd be
[1:04:14] there right if i
[1:04:16] if god wanted me to have that i'd have
[1:04:17] that because i asked for it
[1:04:19] and he he hears all my prayers
[1:04:22] hallelujah
[1:04:24] so i'm content because he didn't answer
[1:04:26] yet not saying he won't answer but i'm
[1:04:28] content waiting
[1:04:29] because i asked the strong one and the
[1:04:31] strong one's not weak like me
[1:04:32] right i asked elohim right
[1:04:35] i asked he's the strong one praise god
[1:04:38] and he can do anything
[1:04:39] amen he's the self-existent one praise
[1:04:42] god
[1:04:43] he can do all things so i can be happy i
[1:04:46] can be thankful
[1:04:47] because i know the strong one has
[1:04:48] everything in control
[1:04:52] verse 3 with all praying also for us
[1:04:56] that god would open unto us a door of
[1:04:58] utterance
[1:04:59] to speak the mystery of christ
[1:05:02] of which i am also in bonds
[1:05:06] see the the revelation didn't make him
[1:05:08] more popular brother william
[1:05:10] oh god help me amen these revelations
[1:05:14] actually make you less popular
[1:05:16] when did brother ram become the least
[1:05:17] popular at the end when he get all the
[1:05:19] revelations
[1:05:20] at the end hallelujah
[1:05:25] i'm gonna get more popular no i'm
[1:05:26] probably getting more uh talked about
[1:05:28] and rejected after writing this book
[1:05:30] but it doesn't matter because paul said
[1:05:33] just pray
[1:05:34] that we have a chance to share it with
[1:05:36] the predestined
[1:05:37] amen pray for
[1:05:40] open door to share the revelation that i
[1:05:44] may speak make it manifest
[1:05:45] as i ought to speak
[1:05:49] see god just give me a chance just give
[1:05:51] me
[1:05:52] five minutes right how many minutes do
[1:05:55] you think you need to share the message
[1:05:56] one lord just give me one minute so i
[1:05:58] can be bold and just share god has sent
[1:06:00] a prophet
[1:06:01] he's finished the mystery of god the
[1:06:03] main mystery is that christ live in you
[1:06:05] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:06] and then you're ready for the rapture
[1:06:08] the oil of the holy ghost is your ticket
[1:06:10] to the rapture amen
[1:06:12] well how much was that was that 30
[1:06:13] seconds let's go back in time that
[1:06:15] no we're not going to time that but
[1:06:17] listen that's what he's saying
[1:06:19] give me an open door to share this
[1:06:21] mystery i'm in jail because of this
[1:06:23] mystery
[1:06:24] i'm rejected because of this mystery but
[1:06:26] pray that i'll be able to share it with
[1:06:28] somebody amen
[1:06:30] and we know he did i don't know if
[1:06:31] brother william remembers that we
[1:06:32] preached on it
[1:06:33] in philippians paul said everyone in
[1:06:36] that prison knew about christ because he
[1:06:38] was in prison
[1:06:40] so sometimes god may send us on a dark
[1:06:43] path but that's so everybody there where
[1:06:45] we go can hear the gospel of christ
[1:06:48] right right he may send us a place i
[1:06:51] don't like this place this wasn't my
[1:06:53] choice
[1:06:53] i didn't ask for this jesus asked for it
[1:06:56] and you're just the person he needs in
[1:06:58] that tough situation to tell everybody
[1:07:00] about jesus
[1:07:03] amen that's what paul said amen
[1:07:06] everybody there got to hear the
[1:07:08] revelation
[1:07:09] because one man became a prisoner of
[1:07:12] christ
[1:07:14] now let's look at some of the challenges
[1:07:17] here
[1:07:18] now the next section of this chapter is
[1:07:20] called blessings and challengings
[1:07:23] or challenges transitioning to one body
[1:07:26] it was not easy to transition from two
[1:07:29] separate bodies
[1:07:30] jew gentile or actually three samaritan
[1:07:32] now samaritans
[1:07:33] now if you ever study samaritan's church
[1:07:35] samaritans were the people that
[1:07:37] uh some of them were jews poor jews left
[1:07:40] over
[1:07:41] after nebuchad after nebuchadnezzar and
[1:07:43] assyria took all the jews out of the
[1:07:45] promised land
[1:07:46] they left the poorest jews there well
[1:07:49] the bible says in ii kings though
[1:07:51] there were so few people there wasn't
[1:07:52] enough people there left of the poor
[1:07:54] jews
[1:07:54] so the king of assyria set babylonians
[1:07:58] there
[1:07:59] so they could take care of the land and
[1:08:01] that mixture of babel assyrians
[1:08:03] babylonians and jews
[1:08:04] became the samaritans
[1:08:08] so they were half have gentiles because
[1:08:11] they just married between because there
[1:08:12] was nobody else to marry i mean are you
[1:08:13] gonna marry
[1:08:14] if you're poor and there's nobody else
[1:08:15] there you've got to marry somebody
[1:08:19] yeah and then and then they just kept
[1:08:21] the torah they didn't keep the prophets
[1:08:23] so they didn't
[1:08:24] they didn't want to hear about elijah
[1:08:26] they didn't want to hear about any of
[1:08:27] those
[1:08:27] they want to hear about jeremiah they
[1:08:29] just only kept the torah
[1:08:31] and they had jacob's well which they
[1:08:33] thought was a holy place to be
[1:08:36] and they didn't worship at jerusalem
[1:08:37] they didn't want to go down to jerusalem
[1:08:39] that's why the woman at the well she
[1:08:40] said well we're you know she let jacob's
[1:08:42] well right
[1:08:42] she said well we we believe our fathers
[1:08:45] you know and jesus is like
[1:08:46] i'm gonna give you water you don't know
[1:08:47] about right are you thirsty woman i'm
[1:08:49] gonna give you water you don't know
[1:08:50] about
[1:08:52] right it doesn't matter the well it
[1:08:53] doesn't matter where you worship right
[1:08:55] but jesus even said the jews worship we
[1:08:56] know what we worship for salvation is of
[1:08:58] the jews right
[1:09:00] so that's where the samaritans come from
[1:09:02] but so that was like
[1:09:03] but they hated each other samaritans
[1:09:05] hated jews jews hated samaritans you
[1:09:07] know samaritans
[1:09:08] couldn't even go to court and testify
[1:09:10] against a jew
[1:09:11] kind of reminds us of the discrimination
[1:09:13] in our uh nation years ago
[1:09:15] women couldn't go in court black people
[1:09:16] couldn't go to court right
[1:09:18] because it was such an evil spirit of
[1:09:19] discrimination right
[1:09:21] thank god that there's been progress
[1:09:23] thank god for that all the prayers of
[1:09:24] those saints
[1:09:25] yeah we saw yeah we were at gettysburg
[1:09:27] and we saw uh how
[1:09:28] many of those people said god is for
[1:09:31] this war
[1:09:32] to free the people from slavery god was
[1:09:34] in that war
[1:09:36] god held that those confederate soldiers
[1:09:38] back there
[1:09:39] at gettysburg amen they came out as
[1:09:42] they those confederate soldiers from the
[1:09:44] south they came out a mile wide
[1:09:46] to try to take the final hill what was
[1:09:48] it called uh
[1:09:50] that last charge remember what it's
[1:09:51] called pickett's charge
[1:09:53] that that southern army he brought all
[1:09:55] the soldiers it was i think it was like
[1:09:57] six thousand or twelve thousand soldiers
[1:09:59] they just they just formed one line and
[1:10:00] they started marching up that final hill
[1:10:02] to take over gettysburg
[1:10:03] and it's it's as if the angel of the
[1:10:05] lord just helped them
[1:10:07] just mow them down and that was the
[1:10:09] turning point for the north they'd been
[1:10:11] losing losing losing
[1:10:12] it looked like the slaves was going to
[1:10:14] continue but then god gave them the
[1:10:16] victory
[1:10:16] because they said god is behind this
[1:10:18] battle amen
[1:10:19] they were trusting the bat the battle
[1:10:21] belongs to the lord amen
[1:10:23] hallelujah abraham lincoln many times
[1:10:26] prayed for god to give them the victory
[1:10:28] and they got the victory
[1:10:30] so there's another discrimination god
[1:10:31] always destroys that we just got to give
[1:10:33] time for it praise god
[1:10:35] but there was challenges going from jew
[1:10:38] holy kosher diet you know separation
[1:10:41] and gentile none of that right
[1:10:45] so there was challenges now i found a
[1:10:47] couple of them that were pretty uh
[1:10:49] uh familiar but i just want to go over
[1:10:50] them here uh go to galatians we'll go
[1:10:53] back to galatians 2 if you would let's
[1:10:55] go back there just a familiar one
[1:11:01] now what's interesting in galatians
[1:11:03] chapter two
[1:11:04] this was difficult transitioning
[1:11:11] how many knows difficult if you've been
[1:11:12] raised one way your whole life it's
[1:11:14] difficult to change it
[1:11:15] when you get older right you've always
[1:11:18] been taught this
[1:11:19] don't talk to samaritan don't talk to
[1:11:21] jew right don't talk to gentiles don't
[1:11:23] don't even look at him on the street you
[1:11:25] if you see them go to the other side of
[1:11:26] the street
[1:11:26] your whole life you're taught that and
[1:11:28] then all of a sudden yeah
[1:11:30] you can go right up and hug them what
[1:11:33] what if they what if they're defiled and
[1:11:35] i'm going to go out have to go get the
[1:11:37] waters of separation you don't really
[1:11:38] have to do that anymore
[1:11:41] well i mean that's about my whole life i
[1:11:43] mean
[1:11:45] this is just mind-blowing so there was
[1:11:47] problems transitioning over to their
[1:11:50] man-made well not man-made but their
[1:11:51] their law-based
[1:11:52] life into this this word of grace can i
[1:11:55] say it like that
[1:11:56] aren't you glad we're in grace amen i've
[1:11:59] said that many times you know
[1:12:00] i'm so glad i'm not under the law
[1:12:03] because if you come upon a dead body you
[1:12:04] got to get sprinkled on the third day
[1:12:06] seventh day you can't go to church for
[1:12:07] those so those seven days are over
[1:12:09] i would be really sad missing church
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:13] or you get defiled somehow and you can't
[1:12:14] go to church oh my that'd be
[1:12:16] i'd be one sad little puppy there
[1:12:19] but it was very difficult so peter was a
[1:12:22] man who walked on water
[1:12:25] he was a man who had the holy ghost he
[1:12:28] saw
[1:12:28] three thousand can you imagine that
[1:12:30] three thousand converts from one sermon
[1:12:33] i've seen maybe my first time i
[1:12:35] preaching god and we had maybe 10 or 12
[1:12:37] people get baptized after one sermon i
[1:12:38] preached
[1:12:39] they just came one after another and it
[1:12:41] was all out of the holy ghost
[1:12:42] but now it was such of the holy ghost i
[1:12:44] got up i was preaching right by a beach
[1:12:46] and the holy spirit just came upon me
[1:12:48] and i said if god doesn't back up this
[1:12:50] sermon then i'm a false prie and then
[1:12:52] i'm a false preacher
[1:12:54] and i didn't even realize what i brother
[1:12:55] william i don't even know what i was
[1:12:56] saying
[1:12:57] and then i said and i said if you love
[1:12:59] jesus christ you ought to run down to
[1:13:01] that river
[1:13:02] at the end those guys run down there i
[1:13:04] baptize every one of them
[1:13:07] it was totally totally supernatural i
[1:13:09] didn't even know what i was saying like
[1:13:11] i never ever issued a challenge like
[1:13:12] that before like if god doesn't back the
[1:13:15] sermon up then i'm a false preacher
[1:13:17] that it was just it was just god but
[1:13:20] that's a kind of a
[1:13:22] uh that's a kind of a desire that we
[1:13:24] like to see praise god right
[1:13:26] that's revival time but peter had 3 000
[1:13:29] of those
[1:13:31] and then peter saw the vision three
[1:13:33] times that sheet come down
[1:13:35] rise kill and eat no so no sir rice
[1:13:37] couldn't eat no lord
[1:13:39] rise could he no lord and then look how
[1:13:41] stubborn he was
[1:13:43] the lord told him it's okay those are
[1:13:46] red letter words you ever look at your
[1:13:48] bible
[1:13:48] those are red letter words the same
[1:13:50] jesus he walked with all those years
[1:13:52] he's like no no jesus no no can you
[1:13:55] imagine that
[1:13:56] that's how ingrained some of our
[1:13:59] childhood memories are
[1:14:00] but jesus christ can change our hearts
[1:14:03] amen amen
[1:14:04] it's hard for you to you know treat
[1:14:06] people a certain way jesus can change
[1:14:08] you
[1:14:10] it's going to take some time but he can
[1:14:11] do it he can do it we just got to be
[1:14:13] open to being changed
[1:14:15] the same man that saw the holy ghost
[1:14:17] there in galatians chapter 2
[1:14:20] he refuses to eat with gentile i'm sorry
[1:14:23] yeah with gentiles
[1:14:25] in verse 11 he paul was stood into the
[1:14:29] face he was to be blamed that word means
[1:14:30] condemned
[1:14:32] not eternally but temporarily
[1:14:35] right in other words when we sin we
[1:14:36] should feel the condemnation in our
[1:14:37] hearts right
[1:14:40] so uh verse 12 for before that certain
[1:14:44] came
[1:14:44] from james he did eat with the gentiles
[1:14:46] when they were come he withdrew and
[1:14:47] separated himself
[1:14:49] fearing them which were of the
[1:14:50] circumcision and the other jews
[1:14:52] dissembled likewise with them in so much
[1:14:53] barnabas also was carried away
[1:14:55] with their dissimilation
[1:14:58] can you imagine that the very man who
[1:15:01] saw the holy ghost fall on cornelius
[1:15:04] is now he's so afraid of these jewish
[1:15:06] preachers
[1:15:09] do you realize there's a lot of pressure
[1:15:10] with preachers you realize that i'm sure
[1:15:13] brother
[1:15:13] knows that like you really want the
[1:15:15] preachers to like you right
[1:15:16] and you really want to fit in and you
[1:15:19] you don't want to feel like you know
[1:15:20] you're you're against the preachers
[1:15:21] well peter fell under this spirit of
[1:15:23] fear that's right
[1:15:25] god has not given us a spirit of fear
[1:15:28] but peter was born again right in here
[1:15:30] but this is where he had the spirit of
[1:15:32] fear right here oh if i eat with them
[1:15:34] the preachers are going to this
[1:15:35] fellowship with me
[1:15:36] they're going to say i'm backslidden who
[1:15:38] knows what he thought right
[1:15:39] so he's like barnabas hey come on don't
[1:15:42] sit with brother jesse you know he's
[1:15:43] just
[1:15:44] he jumped out come sit over here
[1:15:48] and all the jews did that so when you
[1:15:51] went to the church
[1:15:52] fellowship the jews were sitting way far
[1:15:54] from the gentiles
[1:15:56] how come you guys ain't fellowshipping
[1:15:59] what's going on see sir sometimes
[1:16:02] there's keys to problems
[1:16:04] if we just look at how people fellowship
[1:16:07] right you can tell many times what did
[1:16:10] this the spirit of fear
[1:16:12] fear separated the brethren love was
[1:16:14] going to glue them back together
[1:16:16] now what did it take it took a prophet
[1:16:18] brother said a hook knows
[1:16:20] jew to come up and put his finger under
[1:16:23] peter's face and said you're the guilty
[1:16:25] one
[1:16:25] everybody's following you peter man with
[1:16:27] the keys everybody's following you
[1:16:29] and you're leading them the wrong way he
[1:16:30] said god forgive me
[1:16:33] i'll fellowship with the gentiles again
[1:16:36] isn't that something this was a
[1:16:38] difficult transition
[1:16:40] god had to send somebody who didn't know
[1:16:42] as much as peter
[1:16:43] right as far as jesus didn't know jesus
[1:16:45] you know in the flesh
[1:16:48] but paul said we don't know him after
[1:16:49] the flesh anymore we know him after the
[1:16:51] spirit praise god
[1:16:53] so peter knew i'm sorry paul knew him
[1:16:55] just as well as peter amen
[1:16:57] because he knew him by the holy ghost
[1:16:59] praise god
[1:17:00] he said you're the one that should be
[1:17:01] condemned you should feel guilty you
[1:17:03] should feel convicted peter
[1:17:05] because you're not eating with the
[1:17:06] gentiles for us to be
[1:17:08] oh you're not eating with the poor
[1:17:09] brothers you're just eating with the
[1:17:11] rich people
[1:17:13] or you're only eating with your family
[1:17:15] you're not eating with any of the other
[1:17:16] saints
[1:17:17] or you just want to eat with the
[1:17:18] preachers you don't want to eat with
[1:17:20] anybody else in the church
[1:17:22] see how see how that spirit of fear just
[1:17:24] gets in with people
[1:17:26] what are they going to think of me who
[1:17:27] cares what they think of you what
[1:17:28] matters is what jesus
[1:17:30] thinks of you i don't care what you
[1:17:32] think of me i mean i do it one way i
[1:17:33] want you to think i'm a christian but
[1:17:35] really when it comes down to it i want
[1:17:36] jesus to think good to me praise god
[1:17:39] that's what i'm really trying to please
[1:17:42] tonight
[1:17:44] um let's remind me of scripture
[1:17:48] i wasn't planning on saying this
[1:17:54] can't quite remember the
[1:18:00] got your bibles
[1:18:04] yeah go yeah first corinthians yeah
[1:18:06] first corinthians 4 9.
[1:18:08] sorry i just want to look this scripture
[1:18:11] up
[1:18:12] church because listen you and i whether
[1:18:14] you know it or not we're on a stage
[1:18:16] tonight
[1:18:17] when you go home tonight really you're
[1:18:20] on a stage
[1:18:22] you are performing
[1:18:26] all the spirits are watching you
[1:18:28] including the holy spirit
[1:18:31] for i think that god has set forth us
[1:18:33] the apostles last as it were appointed
[1:18:35] in death
[1:18:36] for we are made a spectacle unto the
[1:18:38] world
[1:18:40] and to angels and to men
[1:18:44] that word spectacle if you look it up is
[1:18:45] a theater
[1:18:48] how many you like being on stage you
[1:18:49] like being on stage brother
[1:18:50] [Laughter]
[1:18:51] you like being yeah let's see how he
[1:18:53] come up there i remember i told him i
[1:18:55] said i said brother think about what you
[1:18:56] want to say he's like he just got right
[1:18:57] up and he's
[1:18:58] i'm ready to talk i like that i don't
[1:19:00] think i could have done that
[1:19:02] but i like that but see church we have
[1:19:04] to realize this is where
[1:19:06] satan got peter the devil's
[1:19:09] the holy ghost was there too but the
[1:19:11] devils are watching peter
[1:19:13] and they whisper in his ear don't eat
[1:19:15] with those gentiles
[1:19:19] and pretty soon he's like yeah i i might
[1:19:21] lose fellowship i might lose
[1:19:23] ties or offerings or something i might
[1:19:25] lose my reputation right that's what
[1:19:27] preachers feared today
[1:19:29] that's why i'm glad i got my own job i
[1:19:31] don't have to worry about that
[1:19:33] that's why i think a lot of preachers
[1:19:34] backslide the message because they're
[1:19:35] scared about losing ties
[1:19:38] so i'm thankful i'm thankful god made a
[1:19:41] smile to protect us
[1:19:44] but look at that the bible says devils
[1:19:47] and angels holy angels are watching
[1:19:48] thank god holy angels are watching too
[1:19:51] but see we always have to remember that
[1:19:52] we're on stage tonight
[1:19:55] see we're a spectacle to men the world
[1:19:57] and
[1:19:58] angels always remember that wherever you
[1:20:00] go there's angels watching you
[1:20:02] amen good and bad but thank god the good
[1:20:05] ones are there praise god
[1:20:09] always remember that so see the angels
[1:20:11] caught peter a time when he was weak
[1:20:13] he said don't eat with them
[1:20:21] you're better than them you said yeah
[1:20:23] you're right
[1:20:25] i don't think i can eat with that
[1:20:28] so the angels see remember say brother
[1:20:30] says satan studies you right
[1:20:32] that's what it is and they watch where
[1:20:36] we're weak
[1:20:36] peter was a little weak with the
[1:20:38] gentiles i mean rightfully so
[1:20:41] right his whole life he was raised not
[1:20:44] to like
[1:20:44] not like samaritans not like gento
[1:20:47] that's how he was raised
[1:20:49] church sometimes we're raised with
[1:20:52] things
[1:20:52] ingrained into us and we don't even
[1:20:54] realize it
[1:20:56] right can i share this it's ingrained in
[1:21:00] me to like cigarette smoke
[1:21:03] whenever i smell cigarette smoke i want
[1:21:05] to my flesh wants to go smoke
[1:21:08] it's been ingrained into me my dad used
[1:21:10] to act real cool like smoking and my
[1:21:11] friends and i
[1:21:12] when we were sinners we used to do that
[1:21:15] we used to act it was fun to us i always
[1:21:18] wanted to be like my dad my dad smoked
[1:21:20] all that so when i was a sinner
[1:21:22] i liked it i like doing that i like to
[1:21:23] go off and smoke like that
[1:21:25] my flesh every time i smell it wants to
[1:21:28] have one
[1:21:29] but for all these years i've turned him
[1:21:31] down but you better believe devils are
[1:21:33] there behind me
[1:21:34] whispering oh you can just go buy one
[1:21:37] you're a grown man now
[1:21:39] i say well shut up
[1:21:43] i'm a holy vessel now i'll say this
[1:21:46] my body is not mine it's jesus's man
[1:21:50] and i'm not going to put cancer causing
[1:21:51] agents in my body
[1:21:53] but see i'm going to i'm going sp i'm on
[1:21:55] a stage
[1:21:56] and they're watching me trying to see
[1:21:57] any weaknesses i had built into me as
[1:21:59] a young boy they're watching just
[1:22:03] waiting for a moment
[1:22:06] for some of us it's too much joking for
[1:22:08] some of us is too serious
[1:22:10] some of us were too judgmental
[1:22:14] right some of us were just too fearful
[1:22:17] some of us were too prideful i think we
[1:22:20] know everything
[1:22:21] we deserve everything we're the best no
[1:22:23] you're not
[1:22:25] but see we're on a we're on a we're on a
[1:22:27] theater we're on a stage
[1:22:29] and the angels are trying to
[1:22:32] find the next way to try to bring us
[1:22:34] down the bible calls it snare
[1:22:35] they're setting a trap so you can walk
[1:22:38] right into it
[1:22:42] so see i just thought i brought that
[1:22:43] scripture i didn't really plan on saying
[1:22:44] that but
[1:22:45] it just kind of came to my heart
[1:22:49] see we have to be careful who we
[1:22:50] influence look how peter influenced
[1:22:53] barnabas
[1:22:54] a holy ghostville preacher who'd been
[1:22:56] rescued out of jail by praying at
[1:22:58] midnight
[1:22:59] he'd seen the earthquakes look at that
[1:23:00] church see that's why miracles
[1:23:02] miracles won't save you right
[1:23:06] miracles won't keep you holy all the
[1:23:07] time and yet there'll be a blessing on
[1:23:09] the short term
[1:23:12] it's faith that saves you praise god
[1:23:17] you praise god right it's submission to
[1:23:19] the will of god
[1:23:22] but it's it's having the submissive
[1:23:24] obedient heart
[1:23:26] it's like jesus to say it is written
[1:23:28] satan
[1:23:29] get behind me satan
[1:23:33] and what happened that's what i like if
[1:23:34] you stay on the stage long enough and
[1:23:35] rebuke satan
[1:23:36] the devils go away for a while amen then
[1:23:39] you can just be happy
[1:23:41] there's nothing going you feel great you
[1:23:43] feel blessed you feel protected like
[1:23:45] there's a hedge about you yeah
[1:23:48] sometimes god takes away the hedge
[1:23:52] and there's great challenges all right
[1:23:54] let me try to bring this down
[1:23:55] in just a moment here so that was a
[1:23:59] a difficulty transitioning to one body
[1:24:03] well all these preachers are gonna think
[1:24:05] um this or that
[1:24:07] all these sisters all my friends are
[1:24:08] gonna think this or that
[1:24:12] we can't be hypocrites we gotta be
[1:24:13] honest
[1:24:15] right and if we're wrong we gotta admit
[1:24:17] we're wrong
[1:24:19] and say we're sorry like peter did it's
[1:24:22] believed he repented and they had the
[1:24:23] fellowship as it did before
[1:24:26] and god used the prophet to do it
[1:24:29] circumcision was another issue remember
[1:24:31] in acts 15 we're not going to go there
[1:24:33] but in acts 15 paul comes back he says
[1:24:36] they got the holy ghost in
[1:24:37] in uh at christ's house and the bible
[1:24:39] said they contended with him they argued
[1:24:42] no
[1:24:42] the holy ghost doesn't fall on gentiles
[1:24:45] and so peter said who was i that i could
[1:24:48] withstand god
[1:24:51] because the holy ghost fell on them in
[1:24:53] cornelius house the same way it did
[1:24:55] on us at the beginning and the bible
[1:24:58] said it pleased all the multitude
[1:25:01] they acted they they rejoiced in jesus
[1:25:03] christ they spoke in tongues
[1:25:05] they prophesied they shouted they they
[1:25:08] praised jesus christ well then praise
[1:25:10] god god's given the holy ghost to the
[1:25:12] gentiles amen
[1:25:13] that's all it took see somebody with the
[1:25:15] holy ghost gets
[1:25:16] really happy when other people get the
[1:25:18] holy ghost
[1:25:21] they rejoice in an amen
[1:25:25] they acted the same what they they act
[1:25:27] the same way i do in church praise god
[1:25:29] thank god for sending us another holy
[1:25:32] ghost-filled saint
[1:25:33] amen that's what i'm praying for for mj
[1:25:35] i was praying for him this week i said
[1:25:37] lord fill him with the holy ghost
[1:25:39] church he's already justified for sure
[1:25:40] and he's partly sanctified because god
[1:25:42] delivered him from homosexuality
[1:25:44] right he's more sanctified than maybe we
[1:25:47] we'd think
[1:25:48] so let's pray for him that he gets the
[1:25:49] holy ghost then we don't have to worry
[1:25:51] about him right once you get the holy
[1:25:52] ghost you're sealed to the day of
[1:25:53] redemption
[1:25:54] you're gonna fight you're gonna battle
[1:25:55] but you're in the promised land
[1:25:57] hallelujah and you are more than a
[1:26:00] conqueror in christ jesus amen
[1:26:02] hallelujah you'll be a victor when
[1:26:05] you're born again
[1:26:07] that's the great difference between
[1:26:08] sanification being born again born again
[1:26:10] constant battles but constant victory
[1:26:13] [Laughter]
[1:26:16] praise god when you're born again it's
[1:26:17] just battle after battle
[1:26:19] but at the same time it's victory after
[1:26:21] victory praise god amen
[1:26:24] but you're out in the wilderness like i
[1:26:25] said you're out there in your tent oh
[1:26:27] yeah i'll get my honey toast today or
[1:26:29] honey bread
[1:26:31] okay back to the tent just relaxing you
[1:26:33] know
[1:26:34] i'll just try not to get too hot out in
[1:26:36] the sun out here in the wilderness you
[1:26:37] know
[1:26:38] oh go get my food oh that that
[1:26:40] sanctification
[1:26:42] right what is this oh it's nice and easy
[1:26:44] bread
[1:26:45] nice and easy life out here just kind of
[1:26:47] temporary life just hanging out here but
[1:26:49] when you're in the promised land it's
[1:26:50] battle
[1:26:51] after battle but it's also victory after
[1:26:54] victory
[1:26:55] it's communion with the captain of the
[1:26:57] lord's hosts
[1:26:58] amen it's following joshua amen
[1:27:02] jehovah's our salvation hallelujah from
[1:27:05] victory to victory from glory to glory
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:09] hallelujah yeah i'd rather have the
[1:27:11] harder life but it's also a more
[1:27:13] victorious life
[1:27:15] i remember what it was like to be in
[1:27:16] denomination i remember that that was an
[1:27:18] awful thing in sanctification that was
[1:27:19] no fun
[1:27:21] that was no fun i was a slave to many
[1:27:22] things i was
[1:27:24] i had no permanent home i didn't know
[1:27:26] where i was going
[1:27:28] but no i know i know exactly where i am
[1:27:31] amen
[1:27:32] i'm in christ i'm a new creature i'm a
[1:27:35] child of god
[1:27:36] i'm filled with the fullness of god's
[1:27:38] love
[1:27:40] and i know the love of christ the height
[1:27:43] the breadth
[1:27:44] the length the width of christ's love he
[1:27:47] loves me
[1:27:48] and i don't want to love him amen i love
[1:27:51] him more than i did yesterday praise god
[1:27:55] oh my thank god
[1:28:00] but they were saying they got to be
[1:28:02] circumcised
[1:28:04] i'm sorry that was acts 11 right that's
[1:28:05] actually where peter said that in acts
[1:28:07] 15
[1:28:07] yeah so forgive me i got my scriptures
[1:28:09] mixed up acts 11
[1:28:10] they all say praise god they got the
[1:28:12] holy ghost but acts 15 they were saying
[1:28:14] oh you got to be circumcised to be saved
[1:28:16] you got to be just like us or you're not
[1:28:19] saved
[1:28:20] the bible said paul and barnabas didn't
[1:28:22] listen to that for one hour
[1:28:24] in other words it would have been our
[1:28:25] day and you said brother jesse let me
[1:28:27] show you this false doctrine
[1:28:28] they wouldn't hit stop right away that's
[1:28:30] from the devil
[1:28:31] don't show me that i'm not even
[1:28:32] listening that one hour
[1:28:35] don't try to bring that legalism here in
[1:28:36] the church we're free in christ in here
[1:28:39] hallelujah there's one way we're saved
[1:28:41] in here that's by the blood amen
[1:28:44] the blood of jesus christ not by a man
[1:28:46] made
[1:28:47] a tradition a legalistic way we're saved
[1:28:50] by the blood
[1:28:51] the blood keeps us safe and the blood
[1:28:53] directs us
[1:28:54] into every good work amen hallelujah
[1:28:58] don't have none of your false doctrine
[1:28:59] well you got to come to my church to be
[1:29:01] safer
[1:29:01] you got to believe this about the tapes
[1:29:03] to be saved you got to believe that
[1:29:04] jesus christ
[1:29:06] died for your sins raised for your
[1:29:08] justification he became your
[1:29:10] sin that you might be made his
[1:29:11] righteousness amen
[1:29:13] that's how you get saved amen not saying
[1:29:16] i worship brother branham i follow
[1:29:17] everything in jeffersonville that's not
[1:29:18] how you get saved
[1:29:19] that's how you get lost praise god or
[1:29:22] backslid that's how you do that
[1:29:24] but you get saved by the blood of jesus
[1:29:26] christ
[1:29:27] amen faith in the blood amen
[1:29:31] that's how you're saved hallelujah
[1:29:35] they say no you've got to be circumcised
[1:29:37] you got to follow the old ways of the
[1:29:38] old prophet
[1:29:41] you got to follow the ways of prophet
[1:29:42] moses
[1:29:44] well he's a great prophet but there's a
[1:29:45] new prophet amen his name is jesus
[1:29:47] christ
[1:29:49] right and they everybody gave their
[1:29:52] point and then
[1:29:53] james said or amos
[1:29:56] said that i would raise up a people call
[1:29:59] by my name
[1:30:01] he and james said this old saint before
[1:30:03] he was remember he was slaughtered
[1:30:04] remember he was slaughtered by herod
[1:30:06] this was one of his great revelations
[1:30:08] before he died he said let the
[1:30:10] gentiles not be troubled let's not force
[1:30:12] them to be circumcised
[1:30:14] let's just give them four guidelines in
[1:30:15] other words until paul gives them the
[1:30:17] whole counsel of god
[1:30:19] these letters all these letters hadn't
[1:30:20] been written yet see she said let's just
[1:30:22] give them four to kind of
[1:30:24] just get get them get their bodies in
[1:30:26] order be sanctified and stay clean
[1:30:28] before god
[1:30:29] he said then the rest will come later
[1:30:30] when paul starts writing these
[1:30:32] these letters hallelujah when he gets in
[1:30:34] prison my goodness
[1:30:37] abstain from idols abstain from
[1:30:41] fornication
[1:30:42] abstain from things strangled and ex
[1:30:45] abstained from eating blood
[1:30:49] see those are the four things james just
[1:30:51] said so this was a this was a battle
[1:30:52] right
[1:30:53] they had to have a council they had to
[1:30:54] call the preachers together and say
[1:30:55] what's going to happen
[1:30:56] what's going to happen should what
[1:30:58] should we tell the gentiles
[1:31:00] it was hard to transition give them four
[1:31:03] rules who says
[1:31:04] oh the bible's not about rules he just
[1:31:07] gave him four rules right there
[1:31:09] that was god's love to them right that
[1:31:12] was god's love
[1:31:14] rules are protection rules are borders
[1:31:17] rules are like a wall
[1:31:19] right rules are like a fence it protects
[1:31:21] you it makes you feel good praise god
[1:31:23] amen it makes you it helps you to know
[1:31:26] you've met
[1:31:27] god's requirements amen hallelujah
[1:31:31] oh these people my goodness
[1:31:37] so they rejoice the bible said the
[1:31:39] gentiles rejoice
[1:31:41] the last one i'll close with this the
[1:31:42] last example so there's two examples
[1:31:44] peter not wanting to eat with gentiles
[1:31:46] you know discrimination
[1:31:48] segregation right in the church of
[1:31:50] living god
[1:31:51] in the church of the living god
[1:31:53] segregation we've all seen it haven't we
[1:31:55] i've seen brother william i've seen it
[1:31:56] where the the rich people the
[1:31:58] nice-looking people won't go eat with
[1:31:59] message people if they're a little
[1:32:00] overweight
[1:32:01] if their teeth aren't straight if
[1:32:03] they're a little older
[1:32:05] i've seen that at different church
[1:32:06] fellowships not here but other churches
[1:32:08] and i'm like what in the world so i go
[1:32:10] up and talk to the people that you know
[1:32:12] they don't look really
[1:32:14] maybe presentable or something like that
[1:32:16] because i i know the scripture i'm like
[1:32:18] oh jesus or james said when you see
[1:32:21] somebody
[1:32:21] he said condescend to men of lower
[1:32:24] degree
[1:32:25] so in other words humble yourself and go
[1:32:27] talk to the people that don't have
[1:32:28] anybody talk to you
[1:32:30] because i know how those rich people are
[1:32:31] brother william
[1:32:33] uh they're gonna try to influence you
[1:32:35] because you know
[1:32:36] or they know that you know they've got
[1:32:38] money
[1:32:40] they're going to try to influence you to
[1:32:41] do what they want to do because they've
[1:32:42] got the big bucks
[1:32:45] it's always that way usually usually the
[1:32:47] richest people
[1:32:48] are the ones trying to persuade people
[1:32:51] you should do this and i don't know
[1:32:53] about that
[1:32:54] just try this i don't care what you say
[1:32:58] i care what the word says praise god
[1:33:01] but they had to battle that spirit look
[1:33:03] at that they did about that that
[1:33:04] segregation right there in the early
[1:33:05] church
[1:33:06] but they overcame it by god's grace by
[1:33:08] correction from the holy spirit
[1:33:10] so that was the first one second one
[1:33:12] what do the gentiles do what laws do
[1:33:14] they keep he said give them four
[1:33:16] they gotta have something do they get
[1:33:17] circumcised or not they have to be
[1:33:18] circumcised to be saved no
[1:33:20] just do these four things trust in
[1:33:21] christ and the last one
[1:33:25] i think is is worthy i put in the book
[1:33:27] it's worthy of an individ
[1:33:28] individual mention it was paul's
[1:33:31] circumcision of timothy
[1:33:36] this was an issue okay
[1:33:40] now if you know the scripture paul told
[1:33:42] titus
[1:33:43] not to be circumcised
[1:33:47] right that was in galatians 2 3 and five
[1:33:50] but then paul went and circumcised
[1:33:52] timothy himself
[1:33:55] this is a difficult transition because
[1:33:57] now it's surgery time brothers
[1:33:59] right this is quite a transition
[1:34:04] are you a surgery or not you know
[1:34:07] this is quite a quite a change
[1:34:11] paul and that's why paul could call
[1:34:12] timothy his son i mean honestly
[1:34:15] right that's part of it no not only
[1:34:17] gospel but even the physical aspect of
[1:34:19] it
[1:34:20] so see there was different reasons why
[1:34:22] right there's different reasons
[1:34:24] so galatians two let's go to writing
[1:34:26] galatians two
[1:34:27] three and four but neither titus who is
[1:34:31] with me being a greek was compelled to
[1:34:33] be circumcised
[1:34:34] because of the false brethren unawares
[1:34:36] brought in who came in privately to
[1:34:37] spout our liberty
[1:34:38] which we have in christ jesus that they
[1:34:40] might bring us into bondage
[1:34:42] to whom we gave place by subjection no
[1:34:44] not for an hour that the truth of the
[1:34:46] gospel
[1:34:47] might continue with you
[1:34:52] okay so look at this church satan
[1:34:55] set in wolves into the church and their
[1:34:59] whole purpose was to secretly come in
[1:35:01] and try to uh convince them to get
[1:35:04] circumcised
[1:35:05] so you've got to be careful when new
[1:35:06] people come like we've had new people
[1:35:08] come
[1:35:09] i'm very i've told my wife we got to be
[1:35:10] very careful with new people coming no
[1:35:11] not you bro i'm talking about somebody
[1:35:13] else
[1:35:14] we know you you're you're a real saint
[1:35:16] we love you
[1:35:18] you gotta what you have to watch
[1:35:19] everybody you know as a pe he knows as a
[1:35:20] pastor and you know he's been around
[1:35:22] church a long time
[1:35:22] you always got to watch the new people
[1:35:24] come here
[1:35:26] in other words you just don't trust them
[1:35:27] right away right you got to watch them
[1:35:28] they have to earn trust
[1:35:32] but here satan
[1:35:35] sends them in and the purpose is to spy
[1:35:37] out and steal their liberty in christ
[1:35:39] so satan will do that he sees how we're
[1:35:42] happy here right
[1:35:43] now he sees how he's singing joy in the
[1:35:44] house of the lord how the girls shout
[1:35:46] and
[1:35:46] we talk about that we have such liberty
[1:35:49] here i can dance around and praise the
[1:35:50] lord
[1:35:51] shout hallelujah thank you jesus there's
[1:35:53] just so much liberty here but satan
[1:35:54] wants to poison
[1:35:56] somebody and send him in just to steal
[1:35:58] our liberty
[1:36:00] because then if we just lose that then
[1:36:01] we'll start losing other things too
[1:36:06] don't get i'm sure i'm sure of it i'm
[1:36:07] sure but amen loves when people raise
[1:36:09] their hands during songs
[1:36:10] but satan would love to steal the
[1:36:12] liberty of people
[1:36:14] i'm not going to raise my hands because
[1:36:16] i'm not going to shout or scream because
[1:36:19] i'm kind of embarrassed
[1:36:20] don't be embarrassed if jesus tells you
[1:36:22] to clap clap for jesus
[1:36:24] praise god that's the liberty of the
[1:36:26] holy spirit
[1:36:27] but satan said i'm going to send people
[1:36:29] in there just to break their
[1:36:30] liberty and make them legalists but paul
[1:36:34] said i'm not having that for one hour
[1:36:36] i'm not gonna listen to that he said get
[1:36:38] out of the church
[1:36:40] oh no no titus needs to be circumcised
[1:36:42] and he needs to be like the rest of us
[1:36:44] he said get out of the church you devil
[1:36:46] right get out of the church are you
[1:36:48] unclean devil get out
[1:36:50] and so he kicked him out he said you
[1:36:52] don't have to be circumcised titus
[1:36:54] remember then he wrote titus he said he
[1:36:56] said you meet the qualifications
[1:36:58] you ordain elders in every church even
[1:37:00] though you're uncircumcised
[1:37:01] you can ordain elders because this is a
[1:37:03] new church amen
[1:37:05] this is a new body praise god this is
[1:37:07] based upon the hard circumcision amen
[1:37:12] so he says no titus is not going to be
[1:37:15] circumcised
[1:37:17] but then timothy does get circumcised
[1:37:22] what's the difference the difference is
[1:37:25] there was pressure on titus to do it
[1:37:26] from the devil
[1:37:28] just throughout their liberty timothy
[1:37:31] did it out of the freedom
[1:37:33] and the hope to save souls
[1:37:37] totally different motivations right
[1:37:41] if you're pressured by fear into
[1:37:42] something that's the devil
[1:37:46] but if you make a choice out of liberty
[1:37:50] to make a sacrifice to win souls
[1:37:54] then we call that holiness
[1:37:58] the other one is legalism the other
[1:38:00] one's liberty
[1:38:02] i've got the liberty i can make a choice
[1:38:04] i can be more consecrated
[1:38:06] so someone can get saved
[1:38:09] that's true paul
[1:38:13] showed timothy was not under any
[1:38:15] pressure he was half jew
[1:38:17] half greek his father didn't permit to
[1:38:19] be circumcised as a baby because he was
[1:38:20] he was greek
[1:38:21] but yet his mom and grandma diligently
[1:38:23] taught him the jewish
[1:38:25] uh revelation right
[1:38:28] and paul said i see you got the same
[1:38:29] faith as mom and grandma not dead
[1:38:33] see sometimes our dads won't walk in it
[1:38:34] but we can
[1:38:37] praise god amen thank god amen
[1:38:39] hallelujah
[1:38:41] because i'm walking after my heavenly
[1:38:42] father right now praise god i'm trying
[1:38:44] to be like him
[1:38:46] thank god amen
[1:38:49] i see faith in you like your heavenly
[1:38:51] father and then like your teachers your
[1:38:53] grandmother
[1:38:54] your mother there was three reasons he
[1:38:58] voluntarily chose it nobody forced him
[1:39:02] first reason he wanted to honor his
[1:39:03] judaic upbringing
[1:39:06] he wanted to honor that because he'd
[1:39:07] been taught his whole life
[1:39:09] second he didn't want to offend the jews
[1:39:11] he was associated with
[1:39:12] they didn't ask him this wasn't satan
[1:39:14] like the other time the other one
[1:39:15] satan's trying to pressure them to take
[1:39:16] away their liberty
[1:39:17] here he just had a burden i just want to
[1:39:19] make my brothers feel more comfortable
[1:39:22] oh my goodness i just want to make sure
[1:39:25] everybody at church
[1:39:27] feels welcome i don't want there to be
[1:39:29] anything to hinder the holy ghost
[1:39:31] movement in the church
[1:39:33] that's how i feel praise god let nothing
[1:39:36] hinder the move of the holy spirit that
[1:39:37] people can be saved
[1:39:39] encouraged filled with the holy ghost
[1:39:41] operate gifts
[1:39:42] grow to love christ more be filled with
[1:39:46] all his fullness
[1:39:48] we don't want people stiff and starchy
[1:39:50] and no liberty and
[1:39:51] under fear and pressure all the time
[1:39:54] we want people free in the holy spirit
[1:39:57] to weep cry shout
[1:39:58] prophesy worship god love god give a
[1:40:01] word of wisdom give a word of knowledge
[1:40:02] you know whatever you feel like
[1:40:04] pray for the sick praise god
[1:40:09] and thirdly he believed his circumcision
[1:40:13] would cause
[1:40:13] some jews to listen to him preach the
[1:40:17] gospel
[1:40:20] that was in acts 16 3. him would paul
[1:40:23] have to go forth with him
[1:40:24] and took and circumcised him because of
[1:40:26] the jews which were in those quarters
[1:40:28] for they all knew that his father was a
[1:40:31] greek
[1:40:33] as paul's travel companion timothy was
[1:40:35] in constant contact with jews
[1:40:37] and look church he just thought if i can
[1:40:39] influence them
[1:40:41] somehow to the gospel of christ i'll do
[1:40:44] it
[1:40:45] huh i wonder where he got that idea from
[1:40:48] where would he get the i where would
[1:40:49] timothy get the idea from
[1:40:52] i need to become all things to all men
[1:40:56] that i might win some
[1:41:00] some church we're not going to win
[1:41:02] everybody
[1:41:03] but if we can win some
[1:41:07] we'll achieve what jesus wanted us to
[1:41:09] achieve
[1:41:11] we want to win somebody to christ i'm so
[1:41:14] glad when i preached both of you
[1:41:16] just come in you're you're our sub right
[1:41:19] there
[1:41:19] there are some remember that old church
[1:41:21] over there you guys came up and
[1:41:23] cried and wept your way to the cross ah
[1:41:26] i'm so glad we can win some amen
[1:41:29] can't win all you can win some
[1:41:33] he says i become all things to all men
[1:41:36] that
[1:41:36] by all means i might save
[1:41:40] son where did timothy get that idea well
[1:41:43] if i'm circumcised
[1:41:44] someone actually might listen to me and
[1:41:47] i could share the message
[1:41:49] he got that from paul his father in the
[1:41:52] gospel
[1:41:53] let's stand to our feet
[1:41:58] all that to say possibly just one song
[1:42:02] one or two souls first how willing
[1:42:05] how far are we willing to go to save a
[1:42:07] soul you can stop the livestream now i
[1:42:08] just want to share this one more thought
[1:42:10] here
[1:42:11] musicians can come
