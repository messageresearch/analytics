TRANSCRIPT
========================================
verse 27 I'd like to preach again on personal Revival and I'll take it out of this text here Isaiah chapter 10 verse 27. yeah I know these a little bit of a review here but I believe they're important for us especially having a personal Revival reminded of how David said you lead me beside Green Pastures you restore my soul praise God he was constantly being restored Hallelujah Isaiah chapter 10 verse 27 I was listening to a sermon the other day and I thought wow I never think I really preached real deeply on this sermon or this scripture right here so I I thought it tied in pretty well with uh the thought on personal Revival by the grace of God so I trust would be a blessing to you and Lord willing tonight if Jeannie comes again I'll I think I'm going to preach because last week I preached so children I apologize in advance if I can't do some teaching tonight uh because she so received it so if she comes tonight I'm going to preach by God's grace and I'll get into water baptism Lord willing and the modesty and these Revelations the specific Revelations that you know God has set apart for his bride praise God so um you know it's interesting you know I came in through the serpent seat you know and of course in water baptism but everybody comes in a different way you know so just want to be led by the spirit and she looked at me last week I was praying up here for her before I prayed and she said God spoke through you mightily today she said I have never heard a sermon like that and she was weeping and crying she wanted prayer for her her nine children to be saved but she said God spoke to Austin and then God spoke through me and God was dealing with her so we'll see if she continues to yield to the Holy Spirit aren't you glad you yielded though praise God and let's pray that shall yield as well Isaiah 10 27 let's read this if we can on three one two three and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing let's have one more word of prayer how many you need the anointing of the Lord today father God in heaven we just come to you Lord in humility and reverence satisfy us with your anointing today Lord God hallelujah satisfies With Your Love Lord God we know your anointing is your spirit and you are love for God is love Lord we recognize we constantly more of your spirit for what we're battling these evil spirits uh this the spiritual wickedness in high places the Lord God and it's a constant battle the enemy is like as a roaring lion seeking to devour our lives he has his his evil servants Lord attacking us every day thank you for your grace though Lord God that we could get back to the house of God and Lord today satisfy us with your love dear God satisfy us with the anointing may it break every yoke Lord God for your glory and father God we just want to be personally revived Lord God and we want to we want to magnify you Lord Jesus we want to be drawn into a Closer Walk with You Lord we want more intimacy The Fellowship of the mystery Lord we want this intimacy of this mystery that you've revealed to us Lord It's the mystery of who you are Lord God hallelujah your works and your power and your prophecy what you're doing right now Lord God Hallelujah the reality of your presence in our lives today thank you for for Lord being in this congregation thank you for bringing this church by your grace and mercy and I pray you speak to every heart Lord God use me just set me aside Lord God lord I come here Lord to show my love for you dear God you said if you love me Lord you'd feed my sheep Lord God so Lord I love you help me to feed your sheep today Father God I love you with all my heart dear God I just want to be a faithful servant to you Lord these are your sheep they're the Sheep of your pasture Lord God and I pray you lead them to steal Waters and green grass the Lord God Green Pastures Lord God restore our souls today we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you you're being seated praise God Hallelujah I have some quotes I like to show so you can switch over there whenever you're ready by the grace of the Lord so you want to take a few thoughts here today and I don't like I said there's a little bit of a review but I feel it's important you know like I said this thought was placed on my heart you know before brother amen and sister who had that Revival that he had praise God and then others thought it worked out really well and uh I constantly see this in my life as well the need for continual Revival by the grace of the Lord and so I would like to look at this here one more time here I don't know if I'll be on this next week or not we'll see how the Lord directs here by the Holy Spirit so we want to look at how the anointing breaks the Yokes a personal Revival just a short very short series here we've been of course looking at Revival we looked at the Four kinds of Revival and then you know as I was preaching I realized it was six and so revive means to to cause to grow to bring strength again to renew strength to restore life praise God and so I'm going to skip past those and um remember church that this revival that God sent to us this is the blessing that was for us the fact that you and I can be revived is God's blessing to you amen God told Abraham I'm going to bless the whole world through you Abraham and so many people just see natural blessings that's all they want to see is natural blessings but there's so much more than that because the natural blessings you cannot take with you praise God to the next uh the next World praise God the next Dimension you can't take those but what you can take is the spiritual blessings praise God because you can store up Treasures in Heaven you know when you leave this earth by God's grace you'll have uh you'll have a welcome in heaven you'll have Treasures in Heaven praise God hallelujah and of course you'll take your spirit and your soul with you Hallelujah and all the Godly character that's been built up in your life will go with you praise God just as the Sinners all their human Spirit remains all their immoral character remains we know in the in the Lake of Fire or not like if I rather but in the in in hell and gehenna in the prison house their wicked character remains so our Godly character will remain when we go to be with Jesus Hallelujah and so this blessing of course is The Blessing of Abraham the Bible said Jesus redeemed us from the curse of the law because he was made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree praise God that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Hallelujah so let's enjoy these blessings amen let's not miss out on this wonderful blessing God has given to us The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit God's spirit able to abide in our thoughts and and we're able to to instead of have our mind instead of thinking our thoughts we can think the thoughts of Christ I'm sure you're like me I get tired of Jesse Smith's thoughts I want to have I don't I get tired of the mind of Jesse Smith I want to have the mind of Christ Hallelujah that's Revival praise God when the mind of Jesus Christ has captured your mind amen and so you're no longer thinking your thoughts you're thinking the thoughts of God hallelujah Church These are the sweetest moments of your life when you're thinking about Jesus Christ when you're meditating and talking about nothing can be sweeter than that praise God the psalmist says it's sweeter than the honey and the honeycomb praise God these thoughts these meditations this is the blessing praise God the blessing is having God's thoughts in the place of Austin's thoughts and place your name in there of Jesse's thoughts and Williams thoughts amen's thoughts the blessing is having the Holy Spirit in your mind Hallelujah you entertaining him you loving him you meditating on him Hallelujah you're focusing on him fellowshipping with him praise God like the cool of the evening praise God how about the chill of the morning you like the cool we like the cool of the evening how about the chill of the morning praise God we saw the frost on the on the ground this morning you know and it's a beautiful still time isn't it you know I love that atmosphere out there in the still of the morning praise God but this is the blessing church that we could be revived and that God's spirit could fill our thoughts Hallelujah instead of the cares of this world as we saw last week because that's the great battle the great battle is are we going to have cares of the world or are we going to have a good and honest heart praise God are we going to choose to be revived or are you going to choose to care about the things of the world that's the test praise God that's a test how many pass in the test by God's grace Glory I got yeah I got my ups and downs but I'm Overcoming By God's grace I know that Hallelujah the Bible says if we live after the flesh ye shall die of course this is speaking not just some natural this is speaking of the Soul death to the soul separation of the Soul but if you live through this Spirit I'm sorry but if you eat through the spirit do mortify crucify the Deeds of the body you shall live amen Paul said I Die daily of course and so Paul is saying it here here mortify means crucified so the way to live through the spirit is to crucify the desires of the flesh and you know you're following the leadership of the spirit when you're actively trying to crucify the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life you can know right there I know I'm in the will of God I know the spirit's guiding me because I'm trying to overcome I am fighting against these inward passions or these outward Temptations I'm fighting against them I'm actively trying to put him under my feet praise God and you can know in that moment you are led by the Holy Spirit praise God it may not feel like it because it may feel like a battle but it's actually God giving you the tools for the battle it's God equipping you with the full armor of God hallelujah to fight the battle Hallelujah that's what the Bible says I forget that sometimes that's why I appreciate this scripture is a great reminder sometimes I forget I feel like I'm bowed all the time but I'm actually empowered by the holy spirit amen the fact I got strength to fight and I'm fighting and I'm overcoming actually proves I'm led by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah because I'm led by the spirit into obedience to the spirit overcoming the Deeds of the flesh praise God in church we have not received the spirit of bondage of yoke we'll get to that in a moment here the Holy Spirit does not want to yoke you to fear or greed or lust or anger or bitterness the Holy Spirit does not want to Anchor you to that or enslave you to that praise God but the spirit of God is sent here that we've received and the Bible says when we receive that Spirit it cries out Abba Father like Daddy father my daddy my father Hallelujah so what a beautiful text here we've got to crucify the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life amen and the lust of the eyes and the spirit leads us to do that and as we do that we're crying out to God Daddy help me Daddy I need your strength Daddy help me overcome praise God that proves the spirit of God is in you when you're crying out for your dad to help you praise God thank God Amen that's proof of the spirit of God active in your life even in sanctification we're going to get to that a little bit here I know as many numerous of us are in sanctification seeking the baptism Holy Ghost I've had numerous people come up prayer for the last few weeks praying for the Holy Ghost which is beautiful but that's a great anointing justification is a great anointing it caused the woman at the well to run this city and said say come see a man who's told me all the things I've done that's a great anointing Hallelujah now before I get to this thought I just want to brief this again remember Church there's uh remember there's at least six kinds of revivals and we got to constantly make sure we we discern when we're listening to brother Brandon
