to us praise god let's take our bibles let's go to the first john again chapter 2 verse 15. i'd like to continue on looking at this thought of overcoming pride overcoming pride first john 2. 15-17 [Music] first john 2 15 through 17. imagine we can read all three verses of those together here this morning by the grace of god let's begin on three for kids one two three love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is on the world and the world passeth away and the lusts are out and he that doeth the will of god and the light of the bread how many will do the will of god may god has blessings we have some uh scriptures and quotes to show here as i said i want to use the same text look at pride here overcoming the sin of pride we want to overcome the sin of pride you know we looked at you know the last few times we've been gathered here looking at pride we looked at how jesus taught us about pride and jesus said if we humble ourselves uh from pride he would exalt us but he said if we exalt ourselves he would bring us down to humbleness and we saw you know of course the first person that ever sinned was an angel was lucifer and he was so beautiful he was so so wise that he thought well i should i should have a better position i should have a better place and and i thought it was interesting that you know he was so beautiful he had he had the most beauty and the most wisdom but he wasn't the strongest there's a stronger one than lucifer and that was michael praise god the sea church you know god gives us all different measures and different portions of gifts but there's always going to be someone that is better that's better than us at something praise god and that's what lucifer found out he thought well i'm so beautiful i've got all these gifts i'm so wise i i think i can exalt myself to a higher place and i deserve i deserve a better position but he found out there's someone stronger than him praise god he wasn't the strongest of the angels and so god always has a way to humble us praise god and uh of course we know we know pride will never become something to us that will cause us to lose our salvation but it is something we're always going to have to battle praise god as we saw in our text today and as we've been rehearsing the last few times we're always going to have to battle pride it is one of the three areas where we'll be tempted in throughout our life but i just want to read a few quotes here what brother graham said i was listening to you know there's one sermon that has the word pride in it it's called pride from 1955 and brother random he takes a text out of the book of luke where simon the pharisee invited jesus over and he was and he came in and they didn't wash jesus feet you know the story they didn't they didn't anoint his head and then so then a woman comes in and does all that she she cries you know she weeps tears on jesus feet and it's just a beautiful picture of how religious people religious pride will not welcome jesus but a humble person who's humble and knows they're a sinner knows they need salvation they'll welcome jesus amen amen aren't you glad we welcome jesus this morning praise god amen hallelujah with our worship amen with our prayers amen with our devotion to god we worship him and we recognize his presence is here praise god but we must be very careful when we invite jesus to then recognize his presence once he comes and he says how do we know his presence people will repent [Applause] that's how you know his presence amen because that's what the woman did she was weeping there seeking forgiveness and jesus said her sins which are many are forgiven hallelujah amen amen so that's the one sermon where brother brown used the word pride in the title right there's over there's almost 1200 sermons and that's the only one where he used the word pride in the sermon but brother ham says pride is a cursed thing he said it's an awful thing to be a slave to it's an evil thing it's a horrible thing and the church said amen now here's what he says in that sermon he says my subject would be pride oh pride such a cursive thing so awful so evil he says is pride and that he goes in this story of jesus life i just want to remind us of that churchill it is so awful if we get a higher estimation of ourselves than what we really are that is an awful thing to be in that's a that's an awful state to be in if we start having confidence like i can do this without god i can do this without seeking god i don't really need to pray about this i can just do this because i've always done this i don't have this ability god has blessed me before so i can just do this without praying that is a cursive thing that is an awful thing when we get so confident that we feel like we don't need god's direction anymore that is an awful hindrance to our walk with god thank god that god humbles us and brings us down and makes us remember where every good blessing comes from amen hallelujah it's such an awful thing when we get prideful and think uh we can do something without god's help just consider that you know think i think i was awful for satan and we'll get to some other examples think how awful pride can become to people if they don't quickly repent of it and humble themselves and get themselves back in a more uh lower position than what we actually should be in so brother man now preaches again on the unwelcome christ he said that big pharisee asked my lord to come and let and let him sit over there with that dung on his feet wouldn't give him any oil let him sit there stinking unattended unrefreshed unwelcome and all of them look on saying oh look at him oh god have mercy on this sinful world what a horrible curse pride is now look at that jesus was in a rich man's house but brother adam said he was cursed see money is not the answer to being that doesn't mean you're blessed if you have money he was actually rich and had servants none of us here have any servants do we we have helpers our children thank god for them but they could be gone soon and so they're not servants they're helpers but he was so rich he had servants so much money but at the same time he was cursed with a demon of pride all because he wouldn't go over and wash jesus feet and make him feel welcome i want you to feel welcome i want you to uh we're all going to recognize you we're all going to thank you for your healing ministry of your preaching is changing this world and you're just doing such a wonderful we're so thankful god has sent you you know he wouldn't even give him any uh any any compliments they wouldn't give him any respect he said what a curse that was he says you're too good he said they thought they were too good we're sure we go to church and that knows better than that we don't believe in divine healing all we have nothing to do with that pharisee jesus is in your town amen entertain him love him embrace him worship him amen that's why we're here praise god we're here to worship jesus entertain him to love him to tell him how thankful we are for all that he's done for us amen amen that's why we're here praise god we're here to forget about our worldly trials and and all the awful things in the world how it keeps getting worse and worse and worse right the birth things keep coming as we said last week they keep coming it gets worse and worse but here is the place where jesus is welcome amen they will welcome him in the government they will welcome him in the societies and and all the events in the theaters they won't welcome him there but we'll welcome him here hallelujah and we're blessed with humility praise god we're blessed to know that our life is but a vapor we're blessed to know that god can take our life at any time and still be a blessing to be able to say that we knew jesus christ and this side on this life in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of a suffering it was a blessing to give our lives as a sacrifice unto christ amen ram said he said only had one regret in his life he wished he would have given his heart to jesus sooner how many have that regret praise god amen i wish i would have surrendered sooner praise god instead of being prideful and trying to live life my way with with my with my ideas and and my my decision making rather than holding myself and letting jesus guide me hallelujah remember church as i said temporary curses still exist remember in the corinthian church many were sickened weakly among them because they didn't discern the body of the lord they didn't know how to treat one another didn't know how to repent to one another they didn't know how to apologize to one another they didn't know how to speak good about your brother or sister brother says if you want somebody to say something good about you say something good about them first right just think about all the good things that people have done for you and say good things about other people it'll come back to you praise god amen that's exactly right amen but what a horrible curse pride is thinking highly of yourself right thinking you know something thinking that you have some special uh special place that's above everybody else we know that's not the case praise god and because we know the bible says also we're saved by grace he said not by works thus any man can boast so anyone who's saved now or at the white throne judgment you're going to be saved by grace david that answers the question from a few weeks ago right because if you if you can boast about it then you've done it then you didn't need it you could do it yourself you could earn your own salvation so if god saves any man it'll be by the grace of god amen i just i think i told meg about that last week by god's grace if it's my works now the bible says he'll judge by works right he'll judge by works but it's still salvation by grace amen because they did the bible says they did something good hallelujah they were good there's a third one he says the first thing you know that old pharisee said see i told you he wasn't no prophet he would have known see look at that woman will even ruin his reputation oh how blind see that harlot woman washing his feet they said oh she's gonna ruin his reputation he said oh pride is such an evil thing they thought simon thought the woman would ruin his reputation why brother jesus reputation was made in the presence of sinners amen this harlot washing his feet made his reputation amen this made him the king of kings and lord of lords amen i knew that he would forgive a prostitute that he would forgive an adulteress amen that made his reputation that he was the god of grace that he was the god of mercy he was rich and mercy amen amen so church when sinners like us are when humble people like us worship god it doesn't hurt god's reputation it proves his reputation that's where his reputation is made not amongst the starch instead but among sinners who's willing to repent praise god that's where jesus jesus reputation was made when sinners will come to him hallelujah so see that's when you know jesus is working humility in your life when you can look at your sins and say lord forgive me i repent of those right at every stage of our life whether we're just a new christian whether we're in justification sanctification baptism holy ghost no matter where we are when we can look at our lives and say jesus forgive me i should not have did this help me to move past this give me overcoming grace that's when you're in a place of humility and that's where god can use you that reminds me of moses when moses was prideful and he killed one egyptian god couldn't use him yeah but when he humbled himself and said i can't do it god gave him three uh sorry two signs god gave me aaron to talk and in humility he delivered two million people out of egypt but then when he smote the rock and he he hit the rock and his pride god wouldn't let him go into the promised land so in humility he could take two million people out but in pride he wasn't allowed to go in see so which is the right choice the right choice is always pride i'm sorry i'm sorry humility and overcoming pride amen forgive me the right choice is always humanity humbling yourself pride will always lead to a fall amen like i heard a preacher derek prince he's like he was a pentecostal preacher good preacher he did a lot of things right of course he's wrong on the godhead but he had divine healing right and a lot of other things about fasting and praying i love what he said he said when you break the law of pride because remember jesus said pride and humility is a law when you break that law there's consequences if you break that law god will break you right and he gave the example when you break the law of gravity if you go up on top of the uh of a ten-story building and if you break the law of gravity you just say well i'll see if i can step out there where there's where there's no uh there's no there's no place to step let me just see if i can step out of here what's gonna happen if you break the law the law is gonna break you amen you're gonna have some broken bones if you even survive praise god and that's how pride and humility is if you break this this law of god it's like this spiritual eternal law like reaping and sowing right if you exhaust we exalt ourselves god is going to break you he's going to humble you he's going to bring you to the spot where you realize it's not gonna turn out like you thought it was or if we're boasting about something or or if we're thinking something's gonna happen or something like that if we exalt ourselves like that god is gonna humble us and we'll have to look up to him and say god forgive me you were right i was wrong i humbled myself in your presence amen i'm broken how many would rather repent right away rather than be broken by god's uh name god's chastisement amen i'd rather catch you by the holy spirit that still small voice is whispering in my heart you should not have said that yeah should not have did that until i want that to happen quickly before it gets to an awful spot where where i can't even hear the voice of god anymore and i i don't even have to seek god or i i don't feel like i need to seek god anymore now church we left off a couple weeks ago with jesus disciples arguing about who was the greatest right and then we saw message preachers not arguing but actually taking turns exalting them which one's greater yeah and not a sad thing it's still the same spirit in both cases they both want to be the greatest but in the modern case they're just inviting the next one to come to their church just they can tell everybody how great they are that's wrong that's pride now the live streamers can't see that can they i don't think so i'll just string it just in case i've noticed church in most of these cases we went over a lot of these gentlemen were elderly two of them were 67 years old 161 and one in the 60s i just thought that was so interesting now do young people show pride as well yes of course but i thought amongst message believers and people that have faith like us i thought it's so interesting that these orderly these elderly brothers are the ones who are prideful but i've come to learn as i told you even with brother brown's battle with the critical spirit right and his complex at the end of his life i've come to realize it's not if you're going to battle pride it's when you're going to battle pride in other words we can't relax and say well i don't i'm always going to be humble that's prideful i've always hug i'm just the most humble person there ever was like moses was the meekest man it's not well maybe i'll battle pride someday no it's absolutely guaranteed you're going to battle pride it's guaranteed you are going to battle pride and the older you get the more you're going to battle it right so brother jose sister bertha uh sister beatrice no doubt they battled pride it'd be interesting if we could give them some time to think about it they could maybe share some testimonies all right now we battle in our younger days well i'm so strong i can do it or i need to pray about it i can do it you know we have our our battles when we're younger but clearly in the scripture we can see the older ones battle pride as well remember with with white hair comes wisdom the bible says but also if they're not careful they can be deceived into thinking they're more wise or more and they can become more prideful than the younger ones as well praise god now it's also my observation that pride is a great battle all saints fight but undoubtedly towards the end of our lives think about moses when did moses smite the rock right at the end of his life right when he was ready to see the land he'd been he'd been preaching about for 40 years right at the end right around the time he's 120 that's when pride rose up in him he said you bunch of rebels and he'd already how many times did he rebel against the word of god you know if he's honest if we're honest we rebel every single day right we sin every single day but he called these people a bunch of rebels he let the other people's attitude influence them so church let's be uh let's be convicted in our hearts we're not gonna let other people's bad attitudes bring us down amen we're not gonna be influenced by the crowd let the crowd or those people say whatever they want i'm gonna stand with jesus amen amen i'm gonna keep my heart pure i'm gonna have faith like a child amen amen i'm not gonna be influenced by the prideful people when did it happen end of his life david when did he number the people when he when did he do that with bathsheba towards the end of his life i think his 50s when he when he uh had the bathsheba affair and then uh i think 60s or 70s was when he actually did the numbering of the people all that ride the bible said the bible said david's heart smote him as soon as he as soon as he sent the the word to number the people he knew was wrong it was a work of pride i want to see how great my kingdom is now you see it on instagram or facebook all the time hey i got a net worth you ever seen that video i see i've seen all these rich i see some of these guys used to play football with together oh i've got a net worth and they they've got like a ring on and some jewelry on i'm like that's pride yeah i've got to work too it was the blood of jesus christ amen hallelujah that's what bought me with the prize amen that's what paid my price amen that's what i was worth i was worth the blood of jesus christ god said amen but bragging on social media look at my net worth i've got these jobs and they they hold up that's what they do they hold up their money my friends have done that my old friends from college hold up dollars and look at all this money i've got they'll put the hunters all in a row that's probably all the money they got right but david he did this after he'd all had all these victories he always saw god saw god but he didn't see god on bathsheba he despised the command when he could have went and and let his passions go with one of the 500 but he had to have another one he should have the number of the people he should have to see how great have i become how great is my kingdom now he should have known this is not my kingdom it's god's kingdom amen god's the one that called me this i was the least of my brothers i was a shepherder there's no way i should be in there he might have been grateful he had a house to worship amen you're then grateful that god let him have a king's house amen amen but instead of dog look what i've done look at the great work i've done solomon you know when the bible said we got old all this all of his wives turned his heart away see church if we're not careful all of our successes all of our testimonies can turn our hearts away if we don't own ourselves and give the credit where the credit is due [Music] remember john 15 5 my life burst probably over my first team he said without me you can do nothing amen our life amounts to nothing except we yield ourselves we humble ourselves and jesus can work through us praise god amen when it happened at the end of solomon's life in church he just left the stain on his life right it still leaves a state on his life people talk about sovereign they rejoice in what he did in the beginning but at the end god was upset with him yeah he had gained the anger of the lord against him uzziah we'll get to that in a little bit we saw gideon remember getting on wednesday night when that is just beautiful the scripture shows how we can learn from him he was anointed for all these miracles with twelve thousand lords as soon as he got to victory he fell because of pride and flattery he flatters the uh i think it was the tribe of manasseh if i'm not mistaken or ephraim he traveled he says well you're the greater they said why didn't you call us in the battle instead of saying well god didn't want you there he said well you're just so much greater than we are that you're pridefully exalting them see you would think you would think by then the other had a hold of humility but church we all got to be careful we are all suspect of fall because satan's like a roaring lion he's like a lion him whom he may devour yeah praise god you see we're not going to be swallowed up by a satan we won't be slaughtered by satan but the bible says if we go in the rapture we're swallowed up in life amen death is swallowed up in victory hallelujah that's what we're going to be swatted up by i don't know you're the rapture amen a brand new body a theophany a glorified body that's what swallows us up hallelujah remember paul i see i like paul's example better we're not told of him falling in the sin we he just says you know i do some things i hate that i do but to keep him humble god set a buffeting demon on him to give him eye trouble lord take it away lord take it away lord take it away he said my grace is sufficient for you i've given you this to you so you remain humble because of all the revelations you received praise god that's that's our attitude we should have lord whatever it takes to keep me humble keep me humble amen hallelujah whatever it takes keep me humble help me be a humble servant not to be exalted and not to be prideful not to have the curse of pride in my life lord i don't want to be cursed with pride i want to be blessed with humility amen amen hallelujah and you know i noticed how uh pride always battles people towards the end of their life and then i thought about these books that we listen to i don't know most of you like lamplighter i love lamplighter you know i've heard them so many times i kind of uh hopefully put out some new ones you know but my favorite is certainly this by the way that is absolutely my favorite i love that one but two of them came to my mind and in both stories written in the 1800s in both stories there's a knight there's a hero a christian and he's a type of a christian and the last battle they face in both of them was a giant was it the giant pride i thought wow these people had some wisdom it was the mayonnaise that's right okay now i got it amen then the wisdom of god so in this story the giant killer i'd recommend anybody listen to it you can just buy it on their website he fights five giants in his lifetime he battles the giant sloth which is laziness anybody ever be tough to be lazy then he fights the giant of selfishness okay and then he battles the giant of untruth or the giant of like a lie then he battles the giant of hatred and then the last one he battles is the giant pride and as the as the hero is trying to figure out are you are you with me or against me he says i'm going to put you to the test he said i'm going to write something in the sand here and he says i want you to say it i went in this this giant you know he's disguised as a good guy and he said okay read this and he's like i were i think it was like [Music] he said try it again try to try to speak what i wrote on the ground i and so as the story goes on the the hero realizes this is an enemy because he can't say the following words he can't say i repent and i am thankful satan will never repent of his wickedness amen he'll never repent he'll never be thankful to god in church and and then he finally gets the victory i think he gets the victory on his knees if i'm not mistaken the giant can't defeat him while he's on his knees praying and interceding and humbling himself in the sight of god that's exactly a perfect time of our lives amen if we're not careful we'll get to the spot where we won't say sorry to anybody we'll think we're right all the time and these demons won't repent amen you can't convince a demon the person inside has to recognize it repent get the demon off of them and then they can say sorry that's right so now you know anyone in your family if they can't say sorry it's because they got a demon of pride on them it's a cursed thing it's awful it's a wicked it's a horrible thing like i told amen this story yesterday i think about i think it might well bear the bear telling right now about two months ago i had a brother a lovely brother who were great we were great friends but kind of out of nowhere he just said i'm done with our your friendship i don't want to hear from you anymore i was like i was really shocked i didn't know what to do i was so shocked i didn't even know what to do so brother denis mcbride came in here that guy's got a gift that's why i'm telling you guys and he got up here and he started preaching and he said sometimes friends will just leave you behind he said he said don't do nothing about it he said don't contact him he said just let god take care of it and i come up crying to the altar because brother man god was talking to me and i love when god talks to me amen don't you love when god talks to you hallelujah well i just waited on it i'm like okay i'm not going to text the brother back i don't even know what's i didn't know what to say i didn't see it i didn't see this coming at all talk to my wife about it or give me wisdom did you say something to my wife my wife gave me a lot of good wisdom too but finally just this week i got a text back saying brother i'm sorry i said those harsh words that's been a month and a half think about six weeks i went there for six weeks wondering what did i do what in the world is it me i was asking myself lord did i do something wrong lord show me if i sinned against this person i couldn't think of anything i did the holy spirit never brought anything to me but then this week the brother says i'm so sorry i had an evil spirit on me i got delivered will you forgive me amen and i said of course i'll forgive you i said i may be a little nervous around you next time i see you right because of the harsh things that were said but it was a beautiful example of how we wait on the lord and how we must put things in the hand of god seek we must ask god lord have i done wrong we must be humble enough to admit lord did i do something wrong we must seek the face of god this is my love god will always send the word in due season hallelujah hey that proved to me brother amen that proved when i come to church and i want to hear from god i just got to pull on the word and god will talk to me hallelujah now you prove it to me again of course i've heard i've had that lesson many times over the years but austin many times over the years has god spoken something directly through the preaching of the word if i can recognize his presence and humble myself then god will speak so now i haven't lost a friend now i've gained a friend like god's grace now brother amen i was talking about amen i was tempted to type something back like you know what let me tell you something right right we all get in the flesh austin i talk about that you know sometimes we just want to i want the last word but see i was willing to not have the last word yeah i was just trying to be i was trying to say god help me to be humble yes amen it took a lot i mean it takes a lot right but see those the spirit so that that really proved me this brother is a real he's really that of the holy spirit now now what may happen to church we may get an evil spirit on us sometimes and we may say something so harsh like how did that come out of my mouth and we won't even realize it till later when the holy spirit deals with us so that's why the bible says when you repent you must go to the person you offended yes you must go right the wrongs you have done and the church said amen what a great lesson that was for me this week six weeks i weigh down the world what do i do what do i do what do i do and so these writers were so inspired to check out i'm sorry to understand that we have giants that we face in every stage of our life so you know the young people they're going to face vagina am i going to get married right who do i marry is this the right person or not am i going to get married before the rapture that's what i was that's about what i was facing too just giants you know temptation you're tempted because of that fear you're tempted to do something without prayer so in each stage of our life we're going to battle different giants praise god like david at 50 he would he battle that giant of lust lust of the eyes lust of the flesh end of his life when he battled the giant of pride different giants that we face praise god march are glad all giants fall in the name of the lord of hosts the god of israel and we know his name now his name is the lord jesus christ amen david said i come to you in the name of the lord of hosts hallelujah and jesus said i come in my father's name amen jehovah jehovah rapha amen jehovah's canoe hallelujah jehoshaphem i come in my father's name jehovah is salvation hallelujah glory now this is my favorite book of all time of the lamplighters you don't got this one you guys need to listen to this one this is awesome of course you might not agree with me but that's my humble opinion he fights at least one two three four five six seven eight battles the first one is a temptation to turn back before he even starts on his journey but he's already had experience with god so god helps him to leave the chapel and he gets victory over there and says i know what happened to me i know i god delivered me god i saw the light amen and then the second test is the deception to not fight at all to just no oh there's no battle going on instead of and we'll just we'll just frolic we'll just eat drink and be married right like some there are some national believers not many but some message believers believe we're in the millennium if that's the case we're in the 38th year of the millennium right that's the case my brother said when in the millennium there's no sin all i see is sin when i go outside right yeah this can't be the money any person with common sense would know that but that shows how deceived they are yeah but see that's the spirit that's got them there's no reason to battle there's no reason to fight we're in the millennium the third one he fought was jealousy of a brother all the other brothers were propping up that brother what's his name sir felix it's her felix and he kind of got jealous everybody said oh felix he's fought greater barrels than you and he got jealous and he and he went away and he would have died except the holy spirit told felix to go save him he was saved by the man that he was even condemning amen talk about humility and the fourth one was the death of one of his closest loved ones ardent sir ardent he lost one of his companions and that was a great giant a great battle he had to face right when we lose people with some of the hardest battles thank god our church has been very blessed in that in this case very much god's spirit brother jose thank you amen amen hallelujah jesus kept our brother here with us praise god the fifth battle was the uh the veiled sisters which are called sorrow and pain so other deep sorrows and pains you know you'd say like depression or you know again like losing a loved one anything that would be extremely difficult to handle the next one was one of my favorites the praises of men i love that one because the the hero here is he's he's tempted to cause a a pastor who they call sir nameless and that's why that's my name it's her name listen he's been he's been standing at his post for 40 years and the enemy tries to trick him to convince this this uh veteran preacher to leave your post and go down there and have a feast unto you to uh to to celebrate you and of course the the hero uh sir sir sir what is it that fight is it sir uh consonants so constant thank you sir constant gets deceived and he he tries to get this old preacher to leave his post his home church and then the preacher dies and it's his fault and he has a choice you know either am i going to quit or rise again and he chooses to rise even though he he tried to exalt his brother and praise him to get his brother to take the praises of men more than the praise of god he learns his lesson and he goes on and this is the next one is the battle with the questioner is there even an eternal city is there even a rapture are you sure there's a rapture are you sure god said brother randomly yeah i'm sure amen it's gotta save the lord behind it amen amen hallelujah questions are you sure there's a heaven are you sure you're saved are you sure you're filled with the holy ghost but a man said how do you know you're safe he said he said just like a doctor how do you know you're well the doctor looks at his all of his instruments he looks at his book and if all the instruments in the book agree then you're well praise god and that's how it is for us how do we know we're saved the bible says repent and be baptized that's how i know i say i've taken the doctor's opinion i've obeyed the doctor's book and i know i'm saying because the bible says so amen hey yeah i got answers for your questions satan they're right here acts 2 38 amen amen that's the answer to your question hallelujah and the last battle that uh concert concept based was temptation to retire take an easy way to the eternal city and not help another man's burden so there's an old man hearing this huge bird he's sweating and so the enemy is there to tempt him well you can't help this guy because you've got to go you got to quickly go on to your reward and that and satan whispered he said you can't help him save yourself and then he remembers and that's pride i've got to take care of me this is all about me i've got to save myself and he recognized he says i have heard this voice before that's the first thing satan told him at the beginning save yourself that's prideful we're not here to save ourselves jesus already saved us amen because say like this we're here like paul said we're here to spend and be spent for other people amen amen you are like my wife she's here to take care of these eight babies by god's grace she is she spends and is spent for our family and god blesses her because of that amen hallelujahs we see it every day when we go up into our kitchen amen god blesses her for that hallelujah and so are you you and i we're each one here to spend and be spent for one another another way in other words god used me for the purpose that i'm supposed to be here don't let me uh uh don't let me frolick around let me be put in the service let me serve your purpose hallelujah so we learn these great lessons hallelujah now i was just wondering hey brother god bless you sir hallelujah where might these message preachers be getting these greatest thoughts i can think of a couple of quotes now i've always loved the church age but but i realize also brother level added some of his own grammar to it and he added some statements in the church book that we're not in the 1960 series of the seven church ages but i still think the church age book is my second favorite book in the entire world outside of the bible hallelujah now it seems like to me that perhaps brother vale exalted brother branham maybe intentionally or unintentionally he's not here for me to ask him or else i would i would so let me show you what i'm talking about now this we're going to get down to here so brother in the church book is uh placing this in here now paul said the word came in power as well as voice that's true the word preach actually demonstrate itself like a flaming cutting sword and went to the consciences of men and like a surgeon's knife had cut off the disease and set the captives free everywhere those early believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and god confirmed that word that that word was signs following the sick were healed devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouse of believing christians now let's stop right there the word of god cannot fail in a believer's mouth but we've got to balance that statement out because we've all quoted the word and maybe didn't come to pass like remember the example i showed you a few weeks ago with the brother in the message he said god's going to heal the sister from cancer and she died well what about that did the word fail in the mouth of believing christians well that wasn't god's word that was his human opinion he thought he knew god's will for that person's uh healing but he didn't if you speak god's word according to god's will god will back it up amen but if you speak your thoughts and your timing than what you think god does he's not obligated to back that up does everybody understand this is true when you're really speaking thus saith the lord but most times for us we're not prophets most time we won't say thus saith the lord we'll just speak the promise that's burning on our hearts does everybody understand now here's the the here's the statement i think that uh perhaps either brother bale made a mistake on or didn't know what he was saying or maybe just maybe people just misinterpreted this statement and in this last age the word is here stronger and greater than in than ever in the true word bride now think about that statement oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it someday god will give you the key now that's true that's not true but when you say it's greater than ever in the word bride that means it's greater than this day than paul's now that's a statement right there paul labored more than peter james john all those men so are we to believe preachers today labor more than peter james john thomas who went all the way to india to spread the gospel died as a martyr crucified upside down see we got to be very careful with what we say because we're battling a spirit of pride here brother baby said by the way i read some quotes brother brandon said pride is a wicked thing he said pride is a horrible curse to be prideful it's a curse to be prideful now does he mean in brother evans ministry well perhaps but he doesn't say that he says in the true word bride so where do these preachers today get get these statements well we're the greatest christians there ever was and program was the greatest christian of all time and all these things where do they get these statements i don't know but this could be one of them this could be one of them see church we really got to humble ourselves we really have to rightly divide the word of god no i just i just cut out this these last few sentences now here down here i have two points about this quote that in this quote there's no scripture given and there's no thus saith the lord from brother branham so was his brother vail or brother branham i don't know but i know later in this book brother and gives us a thus saith the lord he says the fullness of pentecost will be in the bride but that's the same fullness that was already in the early church right right brother man came to restore jesus and elijah will restore all things he didn't say it would do greater than the beginning it's the restoration of the same power right there but it says over and over again same signs same wonders same manifestation same doctrine i preached what paul preached amen amen where do we get this idea where now we're all greater than all the other christians i don't think it's from the bible i can't find the bible right like that we i showed you when the brother said the young people they are the greatest young people there ever was they're driving around bmws and bentley's and you know they never had to they never missed one meal what about sister beatrice who she's probably missed some meals have you ever missed a meal sister because you were poor never okay but you had to pray for every meal didn't you there were some times you told me you there were some times you didn't know if you'd have a meal and all these young people they have new shoes and new clothes air conditioning they can fly in plains and what about those soldiers like stephen who gave their life as a martyr as a young man hallelujah see i think just sometimes people make statements and they don't take it back to the word what is that that's pride but we have to humble ourselves and take everything we believe back to the bible amen i can't find where the brotherhood said it's greater where he said thus say the lord we're greater than everybody else i just can't find that i think that's a product of pride anointing preachers hallelujah now the second thing is there's less believers today than there ever was because jesus said i have to shorten the days that some might be saved remember that in scripture and brother brother tells us it's a pyramid thing right there's fewer fewer people being saved all the time but then the capstone is going to come down it's going to sit perfectly on the word bride amen hallelujah so it doesn't mean more speaking of the word it can't mean more well then it would have to mean greater that have to mean the the the miracles of today are greater than the miracles of the bible now that's up for debate i don't know about that but just read the book of acts see what you think peter out of prison with an angel escort hallelujah amen paul on the island of melita everybody's healed on the island molina praise god everybody churches start up every city he goes to amen my goodness hallelujah god shakes an entire prison and all the prisoners are free but then the the jailer gets saved and this whole house gets baptized amen most of these message preachers they never even went to a jail not even to visit somebody right let alone be arrested for preaching the gospel i'm talking about american preachers and they're the ones saying they're the greatest ones that doesn't match to me i can't see that in the scripture nor do i see the same character of jesus christ the humility of jesus christ in today's preachers that exalt themselves as the greatest ever and i showed it to you this was this year this year and other years they're saying they're the greatest christians there was the greatest preachers thereof we ought to be saying how little we are brother said the way to be great is to humble yourself amen doesn't the bible say that yeah the greatest among you are not the ones that call themselves the greatest the greatest among you are the servants the ones that won't say they're the greatest ones hallelujah amen see i think they're using human reasoning to say if it's the darkest hour then the light must be the brightest well now that's true light does shine the brightness and darkness but it's the same light from the same candlesticks in revelation chapter one it's not a different light brother man tells us that plainly amen all seven of those wicks go back to one fountain one vessel one reservoir one reservoir of the same oil amen amen hallelujah now we're getting some church aid doctrine here hallelujah it's not a different license of interest it's the same light hallelujah and just to help these people why aren't they saying what the tapes say the tapes say third tier was the darkest not our day all right so i'm just going to put it out there the tapes say third tier was the darkest of any age because it was called the dark age why are we saying what the tapes say oh because we've got our own agenda we want everyone to think we're the greatest of all time see you get god god knows this when god will bless so many people with so many great miracles and signs but if they're not careful pride will jump on them right away if they don't humble themselves we saw that with gideon if people don't humble themselves right after a great miracle they'll get exalted and they'll start exalting themselves and that's when they're on their they're wrote down brother random says to a fall not to being lost i'm not i'm not saying these brothers are lost but i'm saying they're going to fall if you exalt yourself the bible says if you humble yourself you'll be amazed i'm sorry you exalt you i'm sorry if you exalted yourself you'll be obeyed sorry keep switching sometimes now i want to say this to it i think i was talking about ray about this it's possible brother van was the greatest new testament prophet outside of christ since john the baptist was the greatest old testament but again jesus never told us who was the greatest and only jesus will say that when the father tells them so people today are saying brother adam's the greatest well then they're either saying the father told them or they're lying about it if the father told them then they got thus said the lord then they better say they'll say to the lord about it because even jesus wouldn't say who's sitting on his right and left hand is that right and remember church paul's gospel is the judgment standard for all believers including brother brandon including martin luther john wesley peter james john all the saints amen whose standard is it pulse is the standard of judgment remember brother graham's son joseph even said brother graham was the greatest prophet of all time and he never said except for jesus i'll bring it to you right here here's the exact it's a screen shot on august of 21 august 1st of 2020 god has always provided a way for each age this is still on their website you just gotta go type it in you can search their entire website all of his blog posts he never says except for jesus why do you say except for jesus because he's blinded by his spirit he's blinded church when i read this the first time i read it it's like i got cut to the heart like what he didn't say except for jesus he says he never changed his program or his way of doing things for he's the same yesterday today and forever god has always been a prophet lead his people and today he said the greatest prophet of all time william branham to lead his bride the greatest prophet of all time the greatest of all time he didn't say outside of jesus so you got to watch people's words listen to what they really say i i read that whole article he never said except for jesus throughout the whole article it's brother brandon brother branham it's that statue daniel it's a statue of daniel in the days of it shadrach meshach and abednego amen trying to make a holy man god now we love brother brad we believe he was a prophet of god malachi 4 5-6 luke 17 30. but now they're saying what's not on the tape the people that say say what the tax say are not saying what the tapes say hallelujah know what the bible says that's right amen the program said you got the holy ghost it will point you everywhere wherever points you he said every time it will point you to the scripture it won't point you to branham tabernacle no don't we thank god for tabernacle what it meant you know for us don't point you to me it won't point you to anyone except jesus christ hallelujah amen that's right and i'm not a tape person i'm a holy ghost filled christian i listen to the tapes i listened to the pride yesterday i listen tapes but i'm not a tape person i'm a holy ghost-filled saint you can call me a bible person you can call me a holy ghost person but i'm not a gay person i don't i do not worship tapes hallelujah call me a holy ghostbuild saint amen see they're identifying themselves with tapes yes remember that brother even said the tapes are the token he said if you go to the tape church you automatically got the token that's a lie from hell the tapes are not the token the holy spirit is the token it's always been it forever will be the token the seal the sign the mark that you are sealed to the day of your redemption hallelujah show me where that's on the tape it's not on the tape they're pridefully exalting they're on false interpretation of the tapes now church the reason i'm preaching this so hard is because in laodicea it's really easy i can i could show you all through the bible the time when people get prideful is when they're so blessed and they have so many blessings maybe that's why god's letting inflation hit so hard so it keeps us humble and the church said god's not letting us get too comfortable is he but see if we're not careful we'll get so prideful remember like we talked about yesterday obviously you can understand all mysteries and not have charity yeah you can you can intellectually understand okay i see these scriptures point to the godhead as one person i can see these scriptures shot bush trump point to the rapture pre-tribulation rapture you can see these mysteries revealed but if you don't have charity hallelujah the bible says charity rejoices in the truth charity does not rejoice in iniquity praise god what is this that's iniquity amen you know better but you still do it you still exhaust a man above jesus christ because he didn't say yeah except for jesus christ it says every word on the tape is thus said lord i've got emails back i've got letters to prove it i can joke if you want now here's where bob ramos says we are the children of light but the world is in darkness now the church has been through the darkest age it went through the dark ages so according to brother brown the darkest age ever was was already passed why aren't you saying what the tapes say you love the tape so much oh because that doesn't fit my false doctrines of course the same people that say what the tapes say don't say what the tapes say right the same people that say you can't correct the prophet are the ones correcting the prophet hallelujah amen but they can't see it because they're blind and the spirit of pride will not say i repent amen right even the church age book he said now we've already said this is called the dark age because it was indeed the darkest spirit of all not some all history and he gives the reasons the pope the rise of the pope the inquisition uh the poor the pornocracy of the rule of harlots with the papacy they had thousands of harlots following the catholic churches in those days it's a document i've wrote it i've read about it in my book it's documented now what's true is our age is the most deceptive of all time so that means church we need a real holy ghost spirit of discernment in this day to judge right from wrong we need a strong anointing of the holy ghost for discernment and thank god we got it it's the word of god because the word of god is the sword it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart amen god this evil age he said matthew 24 is the most deceiving age of all ages so it's not the darkest now but it is the most deceiving of all ages there's never been an age so deceptive as this age false prophets will rise and show signs and winners if it possible to deceive the very elective or possible now is this scriptural yes the bible does say paul said evil seducers will last worse and worse and worse they only get more deceptive as time goes on and they are deceiving others while they themselves are deceived but as far as i can find by the scripture we are receiving the restoration of the same revelation amen praise god i don't see how it's greater but i see how it's the same restoration amen hallelujah now what about this jesus talk about the enzyme what about this they're saying we're the greatest we got the most word in our mouth we got we got the most power than ever jesus says am i going to find faith over the earth when i return right they're bragging about how great we are how great we are and jesus says when i return he says shall i find faith it'll be such a small number the believers will be so small it'll be so hard to find real faith real revelation of the will of god real assurance in the churches and this is about prayer amen this is about prayer and a church that will keep asking and knocking and won't give up and will have an abrahamic faith and keep praying for year after year after year and will not stagger at the promise of god through unbelief amen let's preach hallelujah the mic falls off now there has to be few because god jesus has to know when there's no more gentiles that will take the baptism the holy ghost then he'll it'll cut off that holy branch rapture him up to heaven and he'll graft back in uh i'm sorry the wild it'll cut off the wild branch and grab back in that jewish branch that holy branch praise god there's gotta be fewer fewer fewer fewer fewer and remember church have you listened have you listened to leo i've been listening to it for a while but i remember i listened to a couple quotes somewhere uh from let the the laodicean church age 1960 brother says jesus did not say one good thing about this church age that's right he didn't say you have the greatest power you'll be the greatest mothers ever you'll be the greatest preachers of all time he didn't say that he said the brother man says the burden of this age is repent repent and get on fire for jesus amen it's true see we started at 10 right now okay i'm doing good by god's grace here's another one on church i feel some of these things are right but i feel like down here i'll show you why i feel like this may have been uh brother vale's conviction now on the he's talking about the seven church age messenger on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that where there are many people there's even divided opinion on lesser points of a major doctrine than that which they all hold together who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride okay so he says there's going to be all these believers or all these doctrines who has the power of infallibility now church jeffersonville used this to say brother graham's every word was infallible did you know that this is the quote brother joseph sent to me he's in he's infallible he has the power of infallibility but this you misunderstood the quote a prophet is only infallible when they say thus save the lord right amen praise god hallelujah so see how maybe brother mayor and i look i looked oh i'll get that eventually now he says he says i'll tell you will have the power of infallibility it'll be a prophet as thoroughly vindicated now listen or even more thoroughly vindicated that was any prophet in all ages from enoch to this day that again includes jesus and the church said i mean can you believe what i mean was brother vale missing something here i don't know all ages i love the church book but this is a quote i think i don't think it was very clear and this is why some people can exalt brother branham so high he's the power of infallibility he's greatest in all ages and all ages includes jesus age i just can't hardly i can already stop this stuff like the way people interpret some of these things true where's jesus in on this where is the the man who paid for all of our sins amen and it gives us any hope for the future amen where where is that holy land amen he's just forgotten about see it's just like the pharisees amen they don't welcome jesus they don't exalt jesus they don't put jesus first they don't wash jesus face but we should worship and love jesus put it first entertainment man hallelujah there's no one there's no one like jesus he should be at the forefront of every one of our thoughts hallelujah hallelujah how can they forget about this because jesus is not on their mind that's right but the rams not on their mind that's right that's true because this man will be of necessity have the capstone i believe that i believe have the ministry uh that's pointing us to jesus brother said i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world i believe that all right it's the revelation amen the revelation but who's going to be preaching the bible ministry right who's going to be limited the saints the bride of jesus christ it just depends how you how you explain that but it has to be explained by the word the bible says the bible ministry brings us to perfection amen it brings us to a unity of the faith hallelujah and what is that you need to face that's the former ladder rain that's the rapture that's the time when we're all unified we're all purchased we're all caught up in the air at the last trump amen oh my god thank god amen he won't need to speak for himself god will speak for him by the voice of the siren i believe that that part now what i don't agree with again brother the brother veil it seems like uses no scripture there's no thus saith the lord there's no matching quote for this in the church age series when brother graham preached in 1960 like i when i preached years ago when i preached on the seven church ages i preached 120 sermons on the book of revelation right i would i would look at the sermon and then the church age book and i could follow okay i can see that thought i can see that thought here well here's a thought we don't see this is a thought that's not in his sermons from 1960. now here's what i think i think brother vale thought the rapture was going to happen because enoch didn't have to die enoch got to be raptured and i think brother bale thought brother branham was going to be raptured you know 7 church age messenger 7 from enoch right elijah right elijah elijah on the rapture brother have the spirit of elijah that's what i think i could be wrong what's he more thoroughly vindicated this i mean who could be more vindicated than enoch you know i said there's going to be a rapture there's going to be rapture and he went up in the rapture that's the best vindication that you were right amen he said you got rashford hallelujah so whether i preached about the rapture preached about the rapture it seems like brother vale thought well he's going to be more vindicated because the rapture is going to happen in his day before 77 right which i just put that video out this week it's actually been a pretty uh pretty welsh worship well-shared videos which is encouraging i got numerous comments back thank you for clearing that up i needed light on this i've been enlightened by the holy spirit so thank god for that brother and said the word infallible one time in the church age series in 1960 and he said the true church never changes attitude not to be ruled by some board of i don't know what you call them either cardinals bishops or popes invalid ones we believe there's only one infallible one he is our king did it say he's our tapes didn't say that he said he's our king he's jesus christ with us now in the form of the tapes in the form of the holy spirit god where's the end god in us amen living among us leading us and guiding us under the waters of life making himself known yes hallelujah showing as he did among those early saints and martyrs that he was the lord god of creation healing is sick raising that showing visions casting out devils it's true the only time you use the word invaluable when you're talking about the infallible one amen jesus christ hallelujah thank you lord glory to god here he plainly says that people were in michigan saying that they were set by brother branham that they should leave their wives and offer their spiritual mate in other words adultery and that brother graham was perfectly infallible he says that's what some of the awfulest things you've ever heard now how come everybody looks up to jeffersonville now and they're saying some of the awfulest things we've ever heard the tapes are infallible yes every word is thus saith the lord how come everybody admires them and adores them it's because they don't have the holy spirit all right because if you have the holy spirit it guides you into all truth and you'll have a little buzzer that will protect your life from that little idolatry buzzes off amen amen i won't worship brother brown i won't worship joseph i won't worship him to have an uncle i will worship my pastor i won't worship anybody i only worship the infallible one the lord jesus christ that's right then he's called it tommy rod you know this church don't stand for tommy rot like that why do they stand for now see and now why do these five-fold churches stand for that i might as well say it tommy rob them call themselves the greatest of all time with no authority from heaven with no thus saith the lord how can they know but yet jesus didn't know that they're the greatest of all time church we got to know where we stand remember i was telling you it's going to be so close it might deceive the very elective or apostle yeah but it won't deceive us by god's grace amen amen because when we when we have when we have an issue when we have a question what do we do we go down to pray say heavenly father i'm not smart enough i don't know anything amen i just feel a check will you please reveal it help me to see the fruits of this man or this person this group help me to see their fruits are they corrupt fruits or good fruits amen and then you wait on the lord like i told you you might wait six weeks buddy you've been waiting on the lord until god answers and when god answers you'll know it'll be vindicated god will speak and you'll know it and the truth will prevail amen glory now what i found is that people eat now now grandchildren won't they won't they won't write me back and these ones that were attacking me on youtube now they uh they delete all their comments and they don't contact me anymore they just leave me alone well that's fine i'd rather be alone with jesus praise god then all these uh all these uh i don't know i don't know what to say i don't know i should say doubters let me just say that doubting the true word of god amen that's fine as long as i got fellowship with jesus just like brother braham as long as the never failing friends of jesus christ is always with me i'll be happy praise god we'll be happy with the presence of jesus christ but we don't want to be deceived thinking we have christ's presence when we when it's a spirit of pride in all reality we don't want to be deceived with a cursed spirit of pride thinking where something went actually were nothing here in the church book brother says it plain he's talking about the last day prophet messenger that's his ministry there's going to be many people mistake him for the lord jesus there'll be a spirit in the world that will seduce some and make them believe this that brother brahma is equal to jesus that's exactly what they're doing every word on the table is thus of the lord but don't you believe it he's not jesus christ he's not the son of god he's one of the brethren a prophet a messenger a servant of god he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which john received when he was the voice that cried i am not he who's coming after me amen so it's clear people exalt brother to infallibility i've got the i got the letters i've got the emails i got the websites i got the screen shots from their website yeah i've got videos copies of it too see jesus honored john the baptist so only jesus must honor the one who is the greatest in the new testament all right not another man who's adding to the word of god taking away from ephesians chapter four that's not who's going to do it it's going to be god amen because if god did it the first time let me tell you guys the second time amen amen it's true hallelujah now let's get back to us here okay praise god now church that's helpful for us though too because that's the spirit sweeping the message like i told you not only is it on jeffersonville it's getting on the five fold preachers because now they're saying they're the greatest of all time and that influences you right sometimes if we listen to them i enjoy some of their ministries too but something's got wrong when they start calling themselves the greatest of all time something's wrong with that i showed you the videos last or two two weeks ago i'll show you the videos i told cam i'll share to his i'll show it to his church if he wants to see it so when we go down there lord willing we may we we may show it there i don't know the lord in this summer i'm going to write letters to each of those preachers and try to humbly ask is this right do you feel this is the holy spirit praise god amen church should we fear any man or should we fear god fear god doesn't the bible say if someone's if you see your brother overtaking a fault you that are what spiritual should go to them with pride no go to them in meekness so that spirit doesn't get on you amen see that galatians chapter six verse one and two yeah now church now here's where it comes down to us pride will happen when we do not see the need to pray and see god anymore that's why church you know you hear me in different preachers we hammer on you gotta have a prayer life you've got to read your bible you've got to keep seeking god because these people have got to the spot they don't see god anymore they don't the bible says the wickedness pride does persecute the poor they don't care about the poor they just want to get more money they want to stay in their little bubble they want their ties that's what they want let them be taking the devices that they have imagined for the wicked boasts of his heart's desire and blesseth the covetous whom the lord abhorred the wicked through the pride of his covenants will not seek after god god is not in all his thoughts that's why i showed those quotes these people will say quotes and god jesus ain't even in there how can jesus not be in there because the bible said god is not in all the thoughts of the prideful amen this should remind us of king uzziah for 62 years he was faithful to god by the end of his life he got so prideful in his great kingdom what did he do he stopped seeking god yeah he stopped asking for god's will see he prospered as long as he sought the lord see church like i said when you feel like i don't need to come to church to pray anymore i don't need to seek god i don't need to study my bible anymore i don't even listen to tapes anymore when you get to that spot that's a sad spot to be in that's a spot of pride thinking you know it all we don't know it all right and gotta let things happen opposite to what we say just to prove we don't know it all like he's doing now yeah like i showed you that brother said in march he said the rapture is just days away and then he said it's just hours away here we are two months later we're more than two months later where's the rapture and that message preacher influences thousands of preachers where is it it's just hours away see at some point they stop seeking the real mind of god and they just i'll say like this they just study to pump the crowd up i listen to some of these guys it's all about miracles it's all about americans because they want to see the power of god it's all about the anointing but we know there's more than anointing praise god we need to well we need anointing for miracles we also need anointing for true doctrine praise god amen there's a real christian that's both you could have the right spirit and the right doctrine that's right amen but see when uzziah was what strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction and he tried to go into the role of a priest when did it happen when he was strong when it happened when i had everything i need yeah yeah can i say this sometimes church is a blessing you don't have enough money right amen sometimes it's a blessing you don't have everything you want that's not because i know it's right to say but it's true it's a blessing amen to have needs in our lives yes true because then we just get oh look what i've done look oh look where i am look look how far i've come it's the only god that brought you this far right that's right that's true god always changes the prideful and i'm just going to use joe biden as an example the bible says oh love the lord all you sayings for the lord preserveth the faithful oh plentiful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer just look at the president he's got a laptop scandal with his son his record low approval even catholics are preaching against him i've got videos of catholics preaching against a catholic president yeah he's got worldwide embarrassment due to dementia obama visited the white house a few weeks ago and everybody was gathering around him or obama and the president is standing there wandering around he just kind of wandered around wanting to be a part of that he's just being he's just being rejected by everybody all these democrats don't want him to come to their campaigns right and this this man even said years ago he was a prostitute for the businesses of america yeah i've got the video i've got it even says that he fought against roe v wade in the 80s and now he's for all the death of these children see anyone that exalts himself god will humble them praise god that's just one example i just gave you some other bible examples too moses go in the promised land he didn't get to go because he exalted himself so what was what must we be i'll try to close to this one okay we must be clothed in humility the lexicon says the word clothed is was a slave garment there was nobody lower than a slave in jesus day no one was low except i say like this except jesus jesus became the lowest of the lord nobody humbled themselves like jesus peter said submit yourselves unto the elder yay all you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resists the proud but gives grace to the humble now church your exaltation i think i said this said this last week it might come in this life or might come in the next yeah but either way it's going to come amen the woman who humbered himself or humbled herself and prepared jesus for burial burial jesus said preachers would always mention her and they do her exaltation came later yeah for two thousand years preachers have preached about this woman that washed jesus fear anointed jesus speaking before it's burial what a testimony what is what an exaltation that she has stephen's exaltation took place right at his death because he saw a vision amen he saw he said lord jesus received my spirit praise god and now of course he has the martyr's crown brother graham tells us the martyrs crowned in heaven forever exalted as a saint of god jesus was not exalted during life he was exalted after death when he was raised from the dead and now he's exhausted so high hallelujah he went to the lower steps of the hell and god he humbled himself and god exalted him to the highest place so brother ed said even heaven's gotta look up to jesus amen praise god amen that great exaltation of the son of god amen what about mordecai he was exalted in this life but also in the next life see church we don't know when our exaltation is going to come but the main thing is do is humble yourself humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god and he'll exalt us in due season amen what does clothe mean it's a white scarf or apron of slaves which was fastened to the belt of the best and distinguished slaves from free men the belt of the vest hence peter says gird yourselves with humility with your servile garb put on your slave clothes in other words also this refers to the overalls which slave war to keep clean while working and exceeding humble reward so church every one of us this morning did you go to your closet i went to my closet like what am i going to wear today like well i'd like to wear that shirt you know church we should have done the same thing spiritually we and church i'll say like this we did it you did you went to your you should went to your prayer closet she went to your spiritual closet and you should have looked uh which one am i gonna put on am i gonna put pride on today am i gonna put uh self-confidence on today now i'm gonna put on humility today and you have to put it on like it's a garment i've got to humble myself i'm nothing i've got to serve god's people today i've got to go to church and see who needs help who can i pray for who can i be an encouragement does anybody need a love offering anybody need any money anybody out out of food i you you and i i do this morning by prayer we have to put on the garments of humility and say i'm a servant i'm coming here to serve god's people amen amen you have to choose every day to put on that garment of humility just like you chose your beautiful dresses today your handsome ties and jean jackets that you put on today each one of you i got impressed or they look real nice why because you care about what you wear it's more important spiritually yeah it's more important that we put on the garments of humility because guess what that's what jesus did on his last night i think my wife shared this mean if you knew this was your last night on earth what would you do somebody would say well i'd go eat all the food i want i go get drunk on the last night of jesus life what did he do he humbled himself yes he took off his garment on the last night he was on earth of the last obviously here if i had one more night i'd go skydiving if i had one more night i want to fly out and see the grand canyon before i die on jesus last night on earth he took he took off his outer garment the bible says he took a towel put it on and he stuck it right there and he come down and he starts washing his disciples feet very good now who's the great one right here amen he says what i'm doing right now you don't understand but you'll understand afterwards peter said you're not going to wash my feet he said if i don't wash you you have no part with me he's going to wash all of me jesus what's going on man because i don't want to part with you even though he's going to deny it if you opted on his last night on earth he humbled himself yeah he said how can i serve those that have followed me how can i inspire them one last time before i'm taken away from them what do you do you put on garments of a circle he became a slave church i love this look at look at this this is what jfb jamison foss and brown three commentary writers put a commentary together he said clothing was the original badge of man's sin and shame think about that what was the first badge that adam had he was a sinner the lambskins clothes represent sin and shame pride caused the need of man's clothes and pride still reigns in dress people care about what they wear but god provides us with the robe of christ righteousness amen in order to receive which man must be stripped of pride all right how many want christ righteousness well first you must be stripped of your pride yes the statement musicians the bible said he rose from supper he laid aside his regular garments he took a towel he girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded what an example brother says i love it he says the god of heaven washing the clay that he created yeah what a picture i'm going to wash my own creation i'm so great because i'm going to humble myself and look at that god's our example for humbling ourselves i'm going to humble myself and i'm going to wash the feet of the of my servants to show them what they must do to other people that's my hands forward church let's pray that god will strip us from all pride how many would like to pray for that i think every hand should be up i'm sure might i'm sure they are mine [Music] may we pray church today that god will strip us of all pride and then that after that we'll put on the garments of humility that we will wear a humble spirit we're not going to argue and fuss we're not going to think we're something great like we're some big shot or some famous person or something we're a better church than other churches we're not better than any other church please catch that today we're no better than any other church we want to be a humble church along with some of the other humble churches there's very few humble churches we want to be one of those few humble churches where the spirit of god can get us to say i'm sorry i repent hallelujah let's pray together father god we thank you for this service today lord god lord i went to great lengths to show lord how people today exalt themselves and exalt your prophet lord it doesn't seem to have any scripture i don't want that to influence our church i want our church to be humble dear god i want to be humble i've got to defend the message as paul said i'm set for the defense of the gospel because the lord we're calling out sin god and we're asking you lord god help us to humble ourselves help us to put on the garments of humility help us to see ourselves as your servants the lowest of the low [Music] we don't want a cursed spirit on us through god we don't want a horrible spirit we don't want an unholy spirit on us we want the real spirit of holiness on us [Music] so i pray today lord jesus that each one of us if we if we need it we can say i repent that's the zeal this hour is repentance and lord i want to thank you for that six weeks weeks of waiting lord god i sure learned a good blessing their god i should have learned a good lesson if i don't understand something i should humble myself wait on you dear god help me to remember that lesson help me not to get prideful tell me not to text or email mean things help me to be kind i'm going to have to say harsh things god [Music] help me to show your love your patience [Music] lord continue to teach us all we all need lessons learned from the holy spirit and we will be grateful for those lessons dear god help us god to be the most humble we can be lord god with no self-confidence but having only confidence in christ in jesus christ's name we pray this said the other song [Music]
