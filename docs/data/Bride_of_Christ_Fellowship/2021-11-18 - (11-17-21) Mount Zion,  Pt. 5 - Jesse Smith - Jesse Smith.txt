TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen let's take our bibles tonight by god's grace i'm looking forward to it praise god what a promise let's go to first samuel 16 i'd like to lord willing tonight kind of get back to the mount zion thought here so this will be part five i kind of look at the ministry of david here or look at the ministry of david as prophet king and priest and that's a little different order than what i'm used to saying i'm used to saying prophet priest king i don't know how i got into that habit but the actual order of his ministry was prophet king priest lastly so just just a beautiful type here by god's grace so let's go to first samuel 16 if we can and just a couple reminders here but as we're turning there in the scripture um last wednesday night service i didn't get it put up yet i just kind of forgot about it but if you want just listen to that let me know i can upload it and then brother brooks is coming december 18th and 19th we're looking forward to our thanksgiving meal next thursday by god's grace so wow eight days away audio books done on the web my website and also i put up a new video this week called eagles our prophets and believers so i put that one up there uh from our little bible study so that was that's going good by god's grace so i thank the lord for that so i think that's it for announcements i feel like i'm missing something i'll probably think of it later first samuel 16 please verse ones first samuel 16 verse 1. you know it was as we look here at david's life i was reminded that i left off i preached a whole series on first samuel numerous years ago and i left off right after bathsheba and i never picked it up so maybe sometime at some point i like to pick that back up just because now i can see such a beautiful type between david and christ it's even more clear of course because we have that priesthood after the order melchizedek but i'm just really enjoying this study of course and david's life is just a tremendous type of jesus christ so we're thankful for that first samuel 16 1. i'll read this one and then let me read this one and then we'll read 12 together so here's david's first anointing and i didn't realize that david had three anointings during his lifetime he was anointed three times as a prophet king and priest verse 1 and the lord said unto samuel how long will thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel isn't that such a sad thing how could god reject a man because the man rejected him right grace will never fail you but people can fail grace they can kick aside and stomp underfoot the bible said try and underfoot the son of man and crucify him afresh hebrews 10 29 what a sad thing that's what saul here seemingly does fill thine horn with oil and go and i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite mariah provided me a king among his sons now go down to verse 12 we'll read 12 together let's read that on three one two three and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he what a what a story what a story david just starts his life out overlooked and then god is able to take this humble servant god is able to raise him up to king praise god prophet first then king and lastly priest what a beautiful story verse 13 says then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him where in the midst of his brethren he's a shepherd right up to this point he's just he's just a shepherd but now he becomes an anointed shepherd hallelujah in the midst of his brethren and the spear lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to rhema let's have a word of prayer if we can let's ask the lord to help us here for a few minutes i'll try to preach about 45 minutes we'll see how that goes by the grace of the lord let's bow our heads heavenly father god we love you tonight lord and we just don't say that we love you so much we want to love you with our hearts soul mind and strength here we are tonight lord our bodies are here and i pray lord help our minds to be here as well help my mind lord help all of our minds lord and just transform them tonight lord just speak to us out of your word lord we know your whole bible's inspired men and women have shed their blood and died for the last 2 000 years to preserve this holy word because it's a holy inspired word so lord may we find the inspiration the revelation within that will give us spiritual food and due season for this evening lord god bless your people that oppress their way out to the house of god they love you lord there's no better place they'd rather be than in the house of god worshiping jesus and we give you the highest praise jesus tonight for you're worthy of all of our worship and praise you are the high priest who sits on the throne tonight after the order of melchizedek after the order of an endless life hallelujah so we thank you jesus that you conquered death and you're alive forevermore and we give you honor and praise tonight just minister now by the holy ghost to us in jesus christ's name and the church said amen you may be seated here by god's grace so look at this here kind of like my subtitle is uh prophet king and priest we'll try to get to this here we'll just rehearse some of these uh thoughts here as we kind of build to that thought i've never really preached on this before so this is the the idea of those three offices is a new office a new sermon to me i've never really preached that of course i preached extensively on david like i said for the whole book of first samuel all the way up to ii samuel 11 i think is where i stopped and i'm sure there's a purpose for that so let's look here to the word of god here tonight for a few minutes so we're starting here with david's first anointing there was three anointings on david's life we'll build up to that and again i'm taking some of these thoughts from uh kevin j connor's book on the ta the temple of david tabernacle rather of david because i found such inspiration in there that's where i found the old testament ages right typing the church ages that's where i found it very closely typed a beautiful type there and that was a great blessing so let's start here now we see you know the we uh we looked at last week how the bible said all the scripture was written for our admonition for our correction and and all the old testament doctrine is is useful for doctrine and uh for reproof and correction and instruction we looked at that last wednesday night so that totally uh reveals that we can use old testament words to teach new testament doctrine that's what paul did paul used the fifth commandment about children honoring your parents he used that in the new testament ephesians chapter six so we can use it as long as we're directed by the holy spirit we know the law is is abolished for us right we don't get rid of the law rather but jesus fulfilled the law praise god and we fulfill the righteousness of the law through the holy spirit through the law of liberty the law of the spirit the law of obedience the rule of obedience praise god because we want to because we want to obey god because we want to love god we want to serve god there's no more curse because jesus took the curse for us amen there's no more curse of the law that if i'm guilty of one i'm guilty of the whole that whole curse has been done away with amen in christ jesus we don't have that attitude towards the law anymore that's why we don't mind using the old testament scriptures that's why denomination or people that leave the message they can't handle it because they they still feel like they must be under that curse but paul could take old testament scripture john could right all these bible writers could peter peter said be holy for i'm holy how can he take that that was a leviticus scripture how could he take a leviticus scripture and apply it to today because he had a spiritual mind amen because he realized i'm not under the curse but there's righteous commands in there that i want to fulfill today praise god in other words the holy ghost is still saying today be holy people of god for i'm holy amen but that takes a revelation it takes as we've been looking at our bible studies at home we've been looking at revelation that takes a revelation from the father you can't get that in the seminary these guys now go off the seminaries and they go to different places after they leave the message and they're going to the wrong place the place to go is on your knees in prayer amen that's the place to go and then listen for the voice of god for your day hallelujah listen for the present truth hallelujah like the ephesians got to hear the apostle paul and they moved on from the baptism of john to the baptism of jesus christ amen hallelujah water and spirit amen hallelujah and so these are all beautiful types we learn from the old testament and so each of these characters in the old testament have a purpose in their life they either foreshadow jesus christ they foreshadow some new testament event or they foreshadow the bride of jesus christ right we preached on that recently it's a chapter four in my book all the types of the old testament women who typed the bride of jesus christ oh there's so many of them you just you just could name them all by god's grace but there are certain people that stand out and this is what the author picks up i really like this stuff he picks up there's certain types of christ and believers that we have to pay attention to right like adam and noah and isaac and joseph and moses and aaron and samuel and isaiah jeremiah ezekiel daniel and so many more how they type uh new testament characters and it's crucial for us to see it he gives us some of these examples like adam adam was a type of the second the second adam praise god he was a type of jesus christ amen a new man a new creature right uh because he's the lord from heaven adam was the man of earth but jesus christ is the man from heaven hallelujah he's he's a new adam praise god and that reminds us that church we don't we're not living off the old man we're living as a new man in christ jesus just like jesus christ was a brand new man the beginning of the creation of god amen aren't you glad you're a new creation in christ tonight we're not what we were praise god that's our own life that life is is dead and it's gone and it's separated from us we're new creatures we talk differently we walk differently we think differently praise god hallelujah we believe differently amen we think differently praise god everything about us is a new creature amen that's because christ was a second adam amen giving us that example of a new creation in christ jesus isaac is a beautiful type i never heard this before but he's a beautiful type as the only begotten son of the old testament isn't that isn't that true because abraham had all these sons right but but god said isaac is my only son that's what god said isaac is your only son he was the only one begotten by faith hallelujah he was the only one begotten by promise and so god used isaac as a foreshadow right that he was the only begotte there's going to be a promised seed that comes by the promise of promised word of god amen he doesn't come by the instrumentality of just a man's a man's timing or a man's desire but he comes by the timing and plan of god almighty amen that's isaac and that pointed us to jesus christ amen who is the only begotten son of god hallelujah he's the only kind like him he's though he's a one of a kind god took that mold and he threw that one away praise god because we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of god but jesus didn't have this in nature amen he was the word made flesh praise god he wasn't under the law of sin and death i mean he was body his body was subject to it but he didn't have this the the law of sin inside of his members that's what we talked about at the bible study one time the brother disagreed with me but i said he didn't sin it was impossible for him to sin because he wasn't the sin made flesh he was the word made flesh you and i the bible says that we're born of a woman in a few days full of trouble praise god david said in sin did my mother conceive me amen but jesus was not conceived in sin amen he was conceived outside of sin he was conceived in divine nature hallelujah the holy spirit so yes he was under the law of death but he wasn't he didn't have the sin nature inside of him praise god and isaac was a prefigure of jesus christ amen joseph can you imagine joseph is such a major type of jesus christ not just jesus's life we know that was jesus life where he's rejected by his brother and thrown in a bit and then exalted but joseph he typed two thousand years of jesus christ how many people can say that praise god right because if we look at the type now joseph ruling over egypt is jesus ruling over this world praise god and the only place you get food is from jesus amen hallelujah the only place we get food and jesus has a wife right now hallelujah azernath amen a gentile wife hallelujah right now praise god and he's about to go back and reveal himself to his jewish brethren amen his life joseph was such a man of god his life type 2 thousand years of the life of jesus christ earthly 30 or 33 years right and then the rest these 1900 and 70-something years amen all typing jesus christ what a testimony joseph is as a man that god could use he was rejected right hated of his brethren but his father loved him amen and he had a covenant with god amen that no man could no matter how hard they tried to speak against him and defame him and keep him down he rose eventually because god was with him he was a spiritual man amen that's how you and i are church they can keep us down they can try to your people can try to offend you or discourage you the devil can try to try to rend your life but he can't touch it until god says so amen and god has the last say amen god has the last say over my life my life is in his nail scarred hands amen hallelujah we ought to be encouraged praise god satan can he can he can battle us he can try to defeat us but he'll never overcome us and joseph is a type of that amen can you imagine for all those years was it 13 years uh yeah 13 years he was in in egypt i think two years in the prison there and he could have been discouraged all that time but he chose to keep believing he chose to keep being his best every day amen he chose to keep honoring god every single day and and despite living under that shadow of a false accusation church had vanished in a matter of moments and that's what your that's what our life our sinful life did our sinful past jesus made it vanish by the blood amen when we became a king when we were born again baptized with the holy ghost the sins were emitted it was all done away with we're a new creature in christ now we're kings and priests unto god amen and the devil can't there's no condemnation amen to them that are in christ jesus amen i had a woman emailed me from south africa last week and she said i'm i'm i'm so discouraged and uh i'm such i'm so backsliding all these things like that i said sister the bible says there's no condemnation in christ jesus see email back right away and say thank you that's just what i needed to hear i said you've got to put your faith in god's word not our feelings not what people tell us the only thing we can put our faith in it right here sister who is bible amen the holy words of god amen we can't trust anything else nothing else is trustworthy the words of god they are life amen hallelujah that's what we read last night god told moses tell the people he said cleave unto the lord for he is your life and i told my children i said your life really isn't uh lydia like your life really isn't high school math or high school science and working at ritman's orchards or whatever you know malachi your life really isn't high school and being in taekwondo and playing piano that's part of it but your life is in obeying the word of god amen because jesus said my words are spirit and they are life amen that's part of it right doing what god's called you to do but let's never see our lives as just something insignificant our lives are obedient to the word of god and that that way we know it pleases god and in everything we do god is going to see it god's going to reward it he's going to bless us and we're going to enjoy his presence amen hallelujah joseph what a type aaron what a type aaron was as a as a high priest and mediator of a covenant what a type that is of jesus christ amen only aaron can enter into there in the holy secure forgiveness for the people aaron only praise god and that's how it is for us jesus only can forgive my sins jesus only can forgive your sins and the bible said once and for all he's already entered in and obtained that forgiveness the bible said eternal inheritance the bible says he's washed us with a regeneration of waters by the word amen i'm regenerated hallelujah i'm a new creature something new is started praise god the oldest passed away all things are become new amen aaron alone jesus alone can secure it praise god and he has and that's why i like that song simon said just have a little talk with jesus i just gotta i must tell jesus praise god all my all my troubles all my sorrows if i just tell jesus it's all going to be all right that's very simple way to say it but that's the true way to say it because it's prayer praise god and prayer is what gives us the victory amen now also now there's so many more types you could use but the other side is true too cain uh would type uh the antichrist right because he was marked he had the mark right the first one to get the mark murdered his brother right cora is the type brother man said brother abraham said cora is a type of the businessman raising up in this age who say the fivefold ministries failed that's what the church age book says and look who's invaded the pulpits a tape a tape players are made of the popes by who businessmen trying to make money and trying to do the a1 products right there and they're saying the fivefold ministries failed so now we just got to get brother branham back in the pulpit and it goes against every command everything in the word of god every command says train other men who be faithful men that will be able to teach other men also amen every other promise of god said get a living man up there praise god but see we're not the core group we want to go back into denominationalism we want to go back and and we don't want to accuse god that that god's system has failed god's system cannot fail amen god's system is filled with conquerors amen more than conquerors amen their brother said there's nothing more powerful than the word of god in the lips of a believer amen hallelujah praise god so who can say god's five-fold ministry failed when jesus never said it would fail amen he said would bring us to the unity of the faith and he said it would keep us in the times when the waves are tossed to and fro those without the fightful ministry would be tossed to and fro but those with it would have an anchor for the soul that's what i know is right amen so i will not be the kind i'll say like this i'll say many people in the five-fold ministry have failed but that proves they're either disobedient or they were never called to it but there is a group of believers amen who in the five-fold ministry that have been faithful praise god and they're baptized with the holy ghost and they speak the word of god with boldness amen there's a small group of those kind of believers amen i'm glad to be one of them i'm glad to be one of the men he praised god maybe around this area and we're thankful for that and we've got to be faithful to that so we don't we don't want to be the core group amen now of course we could go through all the examples moses a lawgiver all these things i mean there's so many beautiful types uh noah with the with the foolish virgin type just a beautiful example there as well but now let's get to david here because i'm just trying to build a foundation there now remember church most shadows are not perfect shadows right like with joseph's uh 20 piece of silver versus jesus 30 piece of silver so we understand that and especially with the mount zion type we looked at recently last month we can see but see we can all see that god in each prophet brother adam says this in each prophet god was showing a little bit of christ's character program said a little light came out you know through through adam a little light through seth and little light you know abel and noah each man shined a little bit of light but when none of them could shine the whole light but he said when jesus christ came he reflected the full character of god amen we saw some good character know of it and we saw some bad character in noah we saw some good mostly good character in joseph but then we saw a little bit of line and joseph you know we we saw all these things but when it came to jesus it was all good character it was all word praise god it was all obedience it was all the father's will all the time amen and he perfectly manifested the love of god so much so you couldn't write enough books about it amen hallelujah you couldn't just you couldn't fill the world amen with all just thinking we filled this this room with books all about jesus you couldn't do it it wouldn't be enough church look how big my book was i can't even do it we can't even do it justice all those copies if you put them in here they still wouldn't tell all the great things jesus did oh my what a savior that we serve amen jesus is so great amen now david he says now i want to look at kevin j connor he and i showed you this picture i don't have it i'm not going to show it today but there was a picture of how david's life can be divided into two parts the part of rejection and the part of exaltation and you can see that clearly through the scripture let's rehearse this a bit if you got your bible let's get your bible there uh we'll look at a few of these scriptures here the period of rejection so we started there in first samuel 16. remember david comes as a humble an eighth son the youngest son right he's nobody special he's the shepherd right amen and uh we know the story i love the story samuel called all the sun or samuel called jesse get all the suns he didn't even think to invite david church people might i thought oh there's no way they'll be in the rapture they might have said there's no way jesus is inviting you to the rapture oh but little do they know praise god little do they know that there's a calling there's an ordained place that only you can fail amen there's an ordained place and others might have thought oh that totally disqualified there's never in a million years he's just a little small little ruddy cute little fella amen they just got a cute little smile they're just you know they're maybe insignificant but what god saw god didn't see that god saw the heart of a lion amen that reminds me of simon amen he's just a little man there but he's got a heart of alive he's witnessed any any person who witnessed any person no matter how big or whatever matter how small that's why i tell him he's the best man i know as far as my generation because you're a good man too but as far as my generation you know i seen them stand up to anybody praise god and witness to them about jesus christ and he's unashamed of the gospel praise god and that's how david was this little ruddy little man little little boy but god saw the heart god wasn't looking at the outward appearance amen god was looking at the heart amen children don't let anybody and even adults don't let anybody look on your outward appearance that's not what god's looking at god is looking at your love god is looking at your sincerity amen god's looking at your devotion god exalts the humble god exalts those that love him just wait upon the lord stay in your position and watch the miraculous amen hallelujah watch the miraculous come to pass hallelujah amen remember there's nothing more miraculous than a soul being saved right that's more like miraculous than anything else because the soul now has eternal life as the eternal promise hallelujah it's on the lamb's book of life in heaven amen we did come to that realization praise god that's right now he's anointed there in the midst of his brethren and then look he's just sent right back out to the field that's his first anointing amongst his brethren that's how jesus was too jesus was anointed among his brethren john was baptizing him and the bible said there's all the disciples were gathered around and the holy ghost ascended like a dove and jesus was anointed among his brethren hallelujah and john heard the voice say this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hallelujah that was his and so what do we see we see david was a type of that in other words god was pleased with david amen god was pleased how he fought for those little lambs amen just a small little flock it wasn't a big flock it was a flock that a teenager could handle amen teenagers just be faithful with the little things god gave you amen and he'll exalt you in due season amen not to the present united states or something like that but to a place of authority amen where your enemies will fall or flee before you where you'll be able to rule and set up the atmosphere of christ in your homes later on praise god in your life praise god you'll be a living testimony a living witness with power and authority and god will exalt you to that amen that's what david had david had that heart that loved god and so god exalted him at the right time because he liked to be out there with the sheep he liked that simple life amen and god saw if he can feed my sheep out there my natural sheep then he can surely feed my human sheep if he can feed my animal sheep surely he can feed my human sheep by god's grace hallelujah at church that's what we gotta do we gotta fight for him hallelujah now so we have a period of rejection now notice though uh david he kept getting because of this great work there he's anointed and then we know the next thing that happened of course is uh well the bible says here i'm sorry yeah the barber says actually after his anointing he came to play harps and he actually cast out spirits from saul for a season he was used by god to cast out devils for a season the bible said he also became an armor bearer and uh refreshed the king yeah so we see that he conquered that's in sam first samuel 16. this is before he defeats goliath so in other words they can see the anointings on him to sing and to worship praise god i always remember when malachi when you first went to sheffield remember when i preached there a few years ago and malachi went up there and plucked around i had a man come up right after service he said he said brother jesse he said he said i know did you notice your son is anointed to play the piano and at that time he was just like plucking along you know and when it was after that time that might have been the time the anointing came on him amen right because i'm just catching it now amen after that time he started improvising and finding how he can uh really play well by god's grace i can't describe it i don't know music but all i just know is the bible that's all i know and very little of that too amen like i'd like to know it but there's a time that comes when people can see you're anointed praise god hallelujah amen we can see you're anointed god everybody can see if you're a real believer they can see your anointed praise god and then god's going to use you at specific times you can't force yourself to be used all you can do is allow yourself to be used amen all you can do is submit yourself to be used you can't force it you can try the best you can you can just be just got to be humble and wait and when it's god's time the devil can't stop it amen hallelujah but i'll never forget that when that man said that in fact it's brother ray so i'll just tell you because i know i'm thinking about it brother ray come after that that's before he started coming here he said that boy's anointed i said yeah i know he is and he was just plucking at that time hallelujah that's a good reminder but then it was after that that his dad sent him and defeated goliath and remember i showed you the quote brother the man said he was a prophet he knew he was going to defeat goliath church when you know you're going to win you act differently right when you know how it's going to go when you know the end from the beginning you act differently praise god right that's how david that's why he can act like that what's the reward going to be he asked yes his brothers remember cam preached out to you young people he went past the discouragement of his brothers then he went past the army then he even went past the king and then he went through goliath as well praise god he went through four layers oh there's those four horse riders brother amen he went through every one of those devils amen and he conquered them how by the word of god the prophetic word of god he knew what the bible said in church we know what the bible says amen we know the bride can't be stopped we know she's promised a rescuing from laodicea amen so let us be strong and of course amen and not fear i've been guilty of that these last two years with covert i've been guilty of wondering you know uh uh what's going to happen i've been too at times i've been too worried about that but god is calling us to live above that fear praise god god is calling us not to fear what man shall do to us praise god fear not what man can do but fear god who made the soul praise god hallelujah yeah we're all fighting we're all battling and i know god is going to help us to overcome praise god he will not leave himself without a witness hallelujah and so david gets the victory right and notice after that church did you know he was set over the men of war imagine a teenager like malachi he's in charge of men like me i'm 41. now i'm 41. uh and can imagine i'm i'm saluting malachi and he's my he's my senior officer yes sir yeah i'll go do that right now sir thank you sir all these older men because of the courage it wasn't because of his physical stature he was a small ready man he's a lot like uh samson amen a paradox but it's because the anointing came upon him and he was a man of faith he was a worker of miracles amen hallelujah and they saw the anointing on him he wasn't afraid of devils in the presence of devils he started worshiping god he started singing to god and the evil spirits believed that's how a man knows how to fight he knows how to fight the devil with praising the lord oh my hallelujah that's how we overcome too by praising the lord thank the lord and the bible said he behaved himself wisely and he was accepted and loved by everyone in the palace this mighty victor right but then saul became jealous in church that's what a lot of happens in message churches or any church anytime there's a schism between people you know they're butting heads it's probably because of jealousy because they're both listen they're both saved and forgiven by the blood right we talked about church problems you know and things like that in different places around the world how come people are butting heads they're supposed to have the love of god in fact that's what the bible said was shed the bible says the love of god was shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost amen and if people can't love each other both say they've got the love of god there's something wrong a other spirit an evil spirit a lying spirit has god in there praise god and that's what happened to saul he was anointed man he did great works david was doing great works they could have been a powerful team think about that what a team that would have been king saul up there real humble obeying the word getting the victory and david as his his general praise god oh what a team they could have been but god was showing this is a denominational man versus a real spiritual man the denominational man was jealous and i don't say it like this i'm not jealous we don't want to be jealous of anybody we're happy for people when we hear testimonies of the message praise the lord amen the bible says when one part of the body rejoices everybody rejoices we ought to give god praise when somebody has a testimony a burning hot fire testimony from another church let's not be jealous let's be thankful but saul couldn't do that saul got bitter jealousy right so much so that he wasted the rest of his life chasing down david remember i showed you that last week last wednesday how when when saul died david wept and cried and he said he's mighty like an eagle he was fierce like a lion they were swift like eagles a man that wanted to kill you think about has anybody ever wanted to kill you ever got a death threat from anybody well i haven't either thank god i know preachers that have but imagine getting a death threat from so and so let's just say let's say ned okay because nobody's named ned but then when ned dies you're like oh what a wonderful man ned was yet he chased me down for 13 years what was that a type of jesus christ ah father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they're my brethren amen this is why david was such a type of jesus christ see even his enemies that of course he knew they weren't enemies at the beginning but because saul became his enemy he even wept over his enemies demise and he twice could have taken it from him twice he could have been the pastor can i say like that i think brother brahma said that it's wise he could have been the leader of the group by his own by his own strength he could have taken it but he knew better now look how later he took bathsheba look how he did that right twice he could have took it and was humble enough to say it's going to be in god's time not my time god never told me to kill somebody to become king god just told me i'd be king right but here he takes another man's wife and then brings all this blood upon his family see got off in the flesh got a little complacent right he was not in the place where he should have been in the springtime the kings went out to battle but he was not where he should have been remember that high lofty temple that and house that he built it became a snare to him the church said sometimes the things we get in this earth sometimes they become a snare to us the very house that took him seven years to build i believe it was or maybe that was solomon however many years it took to build that house in zion the city of god it became a snare to him when he was out of his place because it was from that position he could look down and see bathsheba if he just had a normal regular house like everybody he would not have seen bathsheba right sometimes our position and power and authority can be a hindrance to us if we're not in position amen if we're not in spiritual position praise god that's why there's sin amongst pastors and and politicians anyone with authority if their character is not christ-like character they'll fall into disgrace because power without character is satanic satanic power without character is satanic praise god now we're twice in his life here david knew not to touch god's anointed now after a while after running for his life finally we know saul passed away and he died for his transgression remember the bible said that god took his mercy from saul now how how awful would someone have to live in order for god to say i'm done giving you mercy well saul is the example we'd say what was it 12 or 15 years of chasing down david finally at the end god said and then he saw then he saw the necromancer he went to the uh the witchcraft lady the witch of endor after that god said then i'm just done i i'm taking my mercy from you and i'm giving the kingdom to david see there comes a time when god says i've had enough of this right you've had enough times to repent you had enough opportunities to repent but random said if you have one slight desire to serve jesus christ he said you ought to be the happiest person on the earth hallelujah because saul all those years he must he must have blew past that conscience he must he must have just filled his mind he gave a place to the devil in his mind that he had to take down david he had to kill david or david was against him and the whole time david was four and praise god let me say this church no matter who's against you god is for you god will give you his mercy as long as you keep a pure heart praise god what is the conclusion of the matter simon the conclusion of matter is to fear god and keep his commandments amen david feared god he wouldn't touch his anointed and so god honored him and exalted him into a mighty degree hallelujah he brought him out of the shepherd's field into the core of the king praise god what a trip amen what a change of scenery praise god out in the fields and then now in the presence of the king and then out hiding out in caves with a bunch of distressed people remember the bible said the distressed the poor and all those came to david there and said we're joining your team that was me amen that was me joining jesus amen god's god's rejected king amen that was me joining jesus those gentile warriors praise god hallelujah but finally church david came to exaltation after saul's death david was anointed and he ruled over the kingdom of judah and the bible said he reigned seven and a half years in hebron just over judah and during that time like i said the bible said that he wax stronger and stronger and saul's nation wax weaker and weaker now church that's what we got to watch we got to watch our fight what was our fight like for jesus in 2021 i hope it was stronger than 2020. right we have to honestly look and more people i'll tell you if more people did some new year's resolutions i know we always mock it and make fun of it we blast new year's resolutions right but if more people would just take 10 minutes and reflect did i get stronger in the faith in the previous year or not and then if it's or not what changes am i going to make through prayer that's a good that's a good leap to turn over right there hallelujah we should get stronger and stronger in the faith praise god we should have a purpose in our lives we should we know we should know what we're fighting for praise god we should know who our enemy is amen we should know who our allies are amen pray for me brother pray for me sister i need prayer amen pray for me brother i'm in the valley decision praise god i know who's fighting for me i know who's with me praise god i know who's in the lord's army amen why why should we get weaker when we have every access to every strength god has ever offered us amen hallelujah i know about you i hope you can say the same but i know i'm stronger this year see because the enemy always comes in like a flood but the spirit of god always raises the standard against it praise god right and so i know if i'm standing here like i love that david scripture i know the lord favors me because he has not allowed his my enemies to triumph over me hallelujah i'm going to keep quoting that one in 2022. that's how i know the lord's with me praise god because he doesn't let my enemies defeat me now i could say more but let me skip ahead here let's look at some of the the types here now what's interesting church is that both david i'm sorry i'll start with him moses david and jesus went through this the beginning of their lives was rejection and then at some point they their lives ascended into exaltation by god and ministry right so moses was first a shepherd after his rejection right that was really his rejection 40 years right so he had to be rejected that's when the spiritual thing started happening right when he was rejected and left egypt that was a period of rejection but then he had a burning bush experience amen and that changed the whole course of his life oh church i hope you can recognize where was your burning bush when did you meet the pillar of fire amen where was your burning bush that ought to have been a total change of life amen moses his whole life amen hallelujah 40 years in the kingdom of egypt praise god was all forgotten in five minutes in the prince of the holy ghost amen that's how i know i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man because when i met the pillar of fire everything else passed away and now god has used me in the ministry for his glory amen and everything else i've forgotten there's no emphasis on denomination there's no real emphasis on education the emphasis is on revelation amen hallelujah it's a stage everyone's got to be rejected and they got to come and meet the burning bush before they're exalted into ministry in other words if you're born again you've already gone through that rejection stage and now god's exalting you in your spiritual authority yes hallelujah i could say something i better hold that here my god's grace i'm asked to save it for another time but moses was first a shepherd then a king and then a builder of the tabernacle he was rejected and then exalted praise god remember he was such a king church that remember god said i'm going to destroy all israel i'm going to start a new race with you right he was such a ruler david was the same he's first a shepherd then a king and then a builder of the tabernacle because they would build a tabernacle not a not a temple a tabernacle just like moses we'll get to that lord that's why i know this is inspired because there's things i need to get to and i think i need to get there where david built the tabernacle and then jesus was first a shepherd right in his earthly life wasn't he called the good shepherd didn't he call himself the good shepherd i'm the good shepherd amen and now he's king right and i'm sorry then he's king king of saints because he he's king over death hell in the grave and now he's priests praise god he's high priest over the whole house of god amen so we can see shepherds kings and then priests we can see that order how many can see that order tonight let me try to find a place here where i can get uh to spot to close now notice all these men are called the anointed ones right david is called the lord's anointed when the oil was poured upon him he's called the lord's anointed jesus was called the the christ the anointed praise god they were anointed or empowered by the holy spirit to do their ministry praise god now we saw david's first anointing was in the presence of his brothers praise god his second anointing let's go to second samuel 2 4. let's look at a second anointing second samuel 2 4. here's a second anointing 2nd samuel 2 4. and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over the house of judah and they told david saying that the men of jabash gilead were they that buried saul praise god so here he is anointed a second time so we see the first time anointed as a shepherd second time he's anointed king over one tribe and let's look at his third time anointed go to second samuel five so yeah that's interesting his second anointing is in chapter two third anointings in chapter five verses one to three one two and three second samuel five one two and three then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh also in times past when saul was king over us thou was he that led us out and brought us in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over the people. now i like that church i like that because that encourages you and i the bible said in the book of proverbs that a good name is better than precious riches so david wouldn't have riches at first but he had a good name in other words everybody could trust him he was a man of integrity praise god and so when the time came they needed somebody here's a man who lived the life before them and it was the holy spirit that led them to the obvious choice anoint david king over all israel he's got the backing of the prophet amen the prophet's behind him samuel praise god of course samuel died but but he had the word of the prophet behind him and he had this godly testimony waiting all these years to be king right so if he got the victory i think they say around 15 or 17. so 15 years he waited to be king over judah and now he's 37 or 38. all these years well that would be 22 years he's walk before him and integrity a man after god's own heart he's overcome his rejecters he's overcome all the haters amen he's rude uh judah well all by himself you know this little little tribe and finally everybody can see it's time to anoint this guy in other words live a life of integrity and then when it's god's time god will exalt you praise god to a third anointing i wonder if that's the three polls there i wonder it seems like it because the brotherhood said even jesus had three polls to his ministry that would make sense but man said paul had three polls to his ministry so that must mean everybody has three polls to their ministry or something like that there must be some type of correlation where you have three aspects everything's perfected in threes right so david here a third time is anointed and he takes over now all israel and as we saw he was always a man after the heart of god now let's close with a few thoughts here it's got a few scriptures so the first anointing was the prophet anointing where david could write psalms amen where he could sing and cast out devils where he knew he'd get the victory over goliath he knew god was with him and god was never going to leave him the second anointing was the anointing here of the kings and this is the anointing of ruling and reigning so first he had a prophetic ministry of the word amen hallelujah so his prophet ministry was the word his king ministry was ruling and reigning right the third ministry is the ministry of reconciliation praise god reconciling the people back to god can't you see can we see that church the people were all scattered only one tribe was following david but when he got that third anointing israel was reconciled back to god amen back to the same condition as when joshua almost when joshua was the leader praise god so the ministry of the word and then the ministry of ruling and reigning and then the ministry of reconciliation praise god reconciling the people back to god and i imagine that's the role we see in all of our lives praise god first we're anointed with the word we'll witness to anybody about the word we'll be so anointed sometimes we'll lose our wisdom and we want to argue and debate with people because we got the word everybody should be able to see this brother right that's what we sister everybody should be able to see this truth that's that's what i thought i don't know about you i thought everybody could see it what's wrong with them you can just write write plain right there in the bible says they're about makeup it's about water baptism is right it's one god right there in the bible amen why can't people see that but then after a while you start getting some trials and the holy spirit shows you you need to rule and reign over sin all right pretty soon things cool off right you don't see your mom don't see your dad as much don't see that cousin too much that i used to argue with and then it's now it's just you and the devil right right now you're just battling the enemy in your daily life and you've got to rule over that praise god you've got to stand there and rule over satan and stand the bible said having done all to stand amen to take the promised land to take the possessions that god has given to our young sisters and our young sons amen and daughters amen take possession at school amen our children have the ability to change the atmosphere of the classroom amen that's something nature and virtue you can possess that praise god when maokai's on that when you're on those video calls lydia you can change the atmosphere there that's right you can just walk you can just turn on the click a button and you change the atmosphere you can rule and reign over that praise god i know naomi can change it on the phone right right if you got an upset customer you can with a with a the kind word the bible said takes away wrath you can just change the atmosphere real fast see you're learning how to rule and reign not just fight all the time and i'll fight you with the word and i've got i got the truth but now pretty soon you've got to learn how to rule and reign with wisdom and you have to possess the promises that god has given to you and the last stage is bringing reconciliation to the people and to god hallelujah remember the bible says that paul says we are under the ministry of reconciliation that is our desire to reconcile to bring people back to god that's what this church is for to reconcile all of us to god it's the word of god that brings us reconciliation praise god it's the preaching of the word amen that raises our faith hallelujah it's the goodness of god that leads us to repentance reconciling us back to god that's what reconciled me back to my dad i hated my dad for all those years but what brought me reconciliation the holy ghost and i could walk up to my dad he's 71 now brother william i can pick him up and say i love you dad and he left me but i'll never leave him amen because it's a ministry of reconciliation praise god and that's the stages that we see word reigning reconciliation can everybody see those uh stages there word reigning reconciliation hallelujah i want you to see that here as we get ready to close by god's grace word ministry reconciliation let's read that let's let's go to i think it's second corinthians here i just feel to read that here second corinthians i believe it is i'm going to get it here just a moment yeah sacrament is five that's what i thought was second corinthians five 18-19 that's my church if we get austin back or something like that or benjamin these guys come back that's what we're that's what we're called to do our very purpose in this life our third stage of our anointing right our third anointing is to bring reconciliation between god and men second corinthians 5 18-19 well look at verse 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things that are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us what the ministry of reconciliation to it that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself how do you do it how did he reconcile not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us what the word of reconciliation be reconciled with god that should be our that should be our our plea right think about the ones who have come among us and left us our plea should be come back to church be reconciled so after the service i'm gonna start texting people reconciled because it just came up that way be reconciled to god get right with god this is our ministry the bible said that's what we're called to do let's search down search is that beautiful if you and i wonder what's our ministry there's where it is right there and i feel like if you do that then you'll find out your other nine gifts of the holy spirit don't you think if you're trying to win souls all the time and plead people back to the house of god pray for people to be reconciled to god don't you think god's going to use you some type of gift and you'll kind of see what gift you have if you don't know already right he's given to us the ministry of reconciliation so who can i think about tonight who can i pray for tonight that needs reconcile back to god that's a great question and that's what we should be asking ourselves so moses and david prophet king and then priest prophet king priest so the ministry of the word the ministry of authority reigning and ruling and the ministry of reconciliation also intercession prayer worship and praise unto god that's what the reconciliation is because that's what they did when the ark came into the city of david i didn't hear you praise god because that was after the third anointing amen after that third anointing remember he went right up to zion took zion and then what'd they do immediately they brought the ark into the place why so they could worship god and they could reconcile the people unto god amen let's stand to our feet i better stop right there reconciling the people back to god musicians can come you know there's quotes where brother brahm says what's the evidence of the holy ghost you know there's some quotes he calls it he says soul travail remember those quotes brother he said when i see a soul that's in travail for other souls a soul that just wants to do something for god he said that's a real sign a person's born again isn't that the ministry of reconciliation having a burden for souls and this is what we see with these three anointings on david prophet ruler reconciliation let's get the let's get the ark of god back with the people let's get the people back in the friends of god amen where they can worship god where they can have a tabernacle amen where they can have a access to the ark of god that's our ministry that's my ministry that's your ministry bring people into the presence of god amen hallelujah let's bow our heads here now we've seen it recently right we've seen these little girls come under the anointing of the holy ghost right the ministry of reconciliation isn't that beautiful never know what it's going to be do you church we never know unless god gives us a little prophecy amen praise god hallelujah we never know but that is our purpose as mature christians under a third anointing hallelujah i don't have to study that out pretty soon you have a first anointing second anointing maybe first stage second stage third stage now isn't that something before i pray isn't that something preachers who don't go to the second stage can't do the third stage right preachers that don't rule and reign over sin there's no way they can reconcile the god people to god because they're not reconciled to god beautiful type that is a beautiful type that's our gold church to unite as many people as we can to jesus christ the word [Music] let's pray [Music] let's ask the holy spirit lord is there someone tonight someone this week i can call or text that needs reconciled to god now first you gotta be anointed to do it praise god you're gonna be anointed with the word you've got to be ruling and reigning over christ over sin through christ and then this ministry of reconciliation that's god's order prophet king priest that's jesus's order prophet king priest i never realized church how big this role of this role as kings and priests unto god [Music] urging people to worship god urging people to worship and serve him oh let's pray if we can't hear by god's grace heavenly father lord we just love you when i start my prayers but lord i love you god thank you for reconciling my heart to you lord thank you for giving brother brooks and brother craig the ministry of reconciliation so i could be reconciled to god hallelujah thank you lord that i can have peace i know i can have peace with you lord god for there's no kind of nation to them in christ lord each of us can look at our lives how we were nobodies like david we were forgotten but lord at some point you called us and anointed us hallelujah you gave us the anointing of the word amen hallelujah it was great victories over giants and we learned how to rule and reign by the holy spirit and lord now you're asking us lord to have the ministry the word of reconciliation lord give us the word that would cause someone to repent give us the word that would cause somebody to get back to the house of god give us the word that would cause someone to be born again hallelujah thank you jesus i want to thank you for the word that you've given us lord as you heal people eden's teachers husband we want to thank you for that lord give us the word of healing we thank you god for that wonderful testimony hallelujah we thank you for those three souls that were baptized last month the word of reconciliation remember that anointed night dear god just preaching your simple humble word it's the word that reconciled three souls unto god we thank you for that lord god it's a ministry of ours you've called us to it and we all are going to be faithful with it by your grace tonight lord as we close help us to meditate upon your goodness and remember the three anointings you placed in our lives the three phases of our ministries and we know you've given us the ministry of the word to reconcile others unto you [Music] so lord just give us that word and do season help us be like david not to try to force something but to recognize when the anointing of god is upon us to speak it's upon us to pray it's upon god for us we know we want to be like jesus we want to only do what the father tells us to do we don't want to push our way into something lord god we don't want to get outside of your timing or we just want to be humble but we want to recognize the ministry of reconciliation tonight so we give you thanks and praise god we worship you lord god thank you for this encouraging word tonight lord god hallelujah we might have been rejected but now we're exalted spiritually in heavenly places as kings and priests unto god with the word of reconciliation we thank you for that in jesus christ's name amen thank the lord for the word of [Music] you jesus god god
