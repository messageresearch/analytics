[Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright let's take our human night read our text in our memory verse so for our text is a little different let's go to numbers chapter 11 we're gonna stay on the same thought as Sunday so this would be part 3 of taking sides with Jesus or willing we'll finish it tonight we'll see how tonight goes let's read numbers 11 may seem like a strange Scripture but brother Branham says God system has never changed for spreading the gospel spreading the good news it's always stayed the same he calls it God's system so numbers 11 let's do verse 16 and Laura Marling I'll just read 16 and 17 and then we'll turn to Isaiah 12 to read that great memory verse from sister Karen well I've loved all these memory verses sister Naomi and brother Jose and a bang and sister Wendy just wonderful memory verses here truly the Lord writes it on the fleshly tables of our hearts members 1116 re distances and the Lord said unto Moses gather unto me 70 men of the elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle the congregation that they may stand there with thee and I will come down and talk with Z there and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee thou barren not thyself alone okay let's go to Isaiah chapter 12 verse 2 I appreciate all the good feedback about these sermons on taking sides with Jesus it's really wonderful and supporting in this hour to see brother Ram one of the future to look like for the Apostolic Holy Ghost ministry and it was to continue the same way it was going during his day so we're thankful to be a part of that aren't you I'm very thankful so no I'm sorry Isaiah 12 2 to 5 it'll read that together here I said 12 - let's read it on three one two three behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my son he also has become my salvation therefore with joy chinese draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the Lord for he has done excellent things this is known in all the earth let's have one more word of Prayer having eat on your heart just making the little one here tonight there's someone you're praying for you can raise your hand for them how many father we love you we exalt you we just read this scripture to sing aloud to the Lord and worship him and make him known and all the earth declare his doings Lord do that we've done that lordy we've shared your testimonies with others help us to keep doing it Lord send us people to talk to Lord and share about the power of this Holy Ghost gospel thank you Lord for bringing us into it Lord God you came looking for us or we did not go looking for ourselves so knowing me Lord to preach and teach and anoint your people here to receive Lord God and father will be happy and grateful as we take our side with you and your system in Jesus Christ's name the church said and amen god bless you mancine praise God alright Lord willing we'll try to be timely here tonight by God's grace I just briefly I just wrote briefly review parts one and two I know there's a wonderful Saints from other churches that may watch our service if there's Church doesn't have a Wednesday night or if their church service gets done early so we looked on Sunday twice both services had taken sides with Jesus and in this sermon from June of 62 brother Graham takes the first half and he talks with the ministers it's like a ministers meeting he specifically said the sisters were invited to come and he showed his vision for the future as far as ministry and preaching he spends the last half kind of preaching that thought about taking sides with Jesus Jesus's ministry was supernatural yet evil spoken of and they had to take aside one way or another and we were and we are today doing the same thing we're taking sides with the message of the hour which is the Bible revelations revealed today that God is vindicating today as brother Branham said in the rapture message 1965 so brother Graham said I want to show you the vision I have for the future then brother Graham says before we do anything we should see the Holy Spirit moving leading us and guiding us in all of our efforts and then brother Ram goes into Paul's establishment of new churches he would go into a area like an apostle where there was no Christian churches sometimes he go to the synagogue's with flip-up in he went down to the river to pray right and the first convert was Lydia and then he before he would leave he would stay there while then ordain elders and pastors or come back and then ordain elders and pastors brother have said God promised to restore that apostolic pattern from Paul John Polycarbon rainiest Martin and all the way down God is going to restore that the RAM Allah tells us to live like the coming of the Lord is very soon we're to live like it's now like brother amens dream Jesus saying I'm coming now live like it's now we must leave footprints on the sands of time bran then gave a ellis tration about when he was in Bombay India he said I probably had a hundred or two hundred thousand converts that one altar call after that blind man was gay him in his sight and he said if only he would have had cooperation from the local churches that after the people got saved he could have sent them to the churches he said probably many of them laundered back out into the world but we have that confidence all that the father has given me will come anyone that was really wanted to serve God genuinely with a pure sincere heart no doubt they would have found a church and then or like brother Ram said if there would have been no one preaching it one of the young men or 100 men would have raised up and started preaching it and that's the beauty of the power of the gospel you be when you get the Spirit of Christ you feel like you're responsible for taking care of Christians and if you see a hungry Christian who's not getting the word you want to try to help them out praise God and so if nobody else will do it I'll do it right that's the that's the desire we should have brother Adam talks about it to decide if you're in a family and one of the children doesn't do their chore you do it right especially if it's so important like he said bring in the wood to burn at the burner so you have heat in the wintertime he said if John doesn't pack the wood then you pack the wood right you find a need amongst the the church or the bride and then you fill that ministry and so that's what Bill Graham said you get so burdened what do you brothers would just preach it and then brother branham's talks about his ministry how God called him the pastor told him to build the tabernacle they had went through many pastors after brother Branham went out and the evangelistic and missionary field but then finally raised up brother Neville brother Branham says be ever as loyal as you can don't be discouraged a lot of people are not going to receive the message right the roof I was our he passed for America the other countries got the revival now thank God for that but don't quit because what if Paul would have quit then the chain would have stopped right so we have to keep the chain go have to keep following the footprints and then making our own footprints for the next generation and then Paul left his office to Timothy brother Graham said we need to leave footprints for our family coming after us and then we read acts 15 and we showed how Paul was an apostle and Paul Barnabas actually called the first council right or meeting amongst the the early apostles the early church fathers over circumcision so those two Paul Marvis went up to Jerusalem and they all got they all one Accord that a big meeting right they all prayed and and fellowship and then they all heard testimony when after one after another and then James came out and gave that final word he quoted the scripture I believe it was from Amos and then Isaiah and they all agreed and they listed four things all the Gentiles should do so a missionary does hold meetings and a missionary does ordain and put things in order okay and that's a good example of how we can see brother Branham grew in his progressive revelation because in this message taken sides of Jesus by the RAM says apostles don't do that apostles don't hold meetings right he said they don't that they don't meet with the brothers right they don't have councils but we know Paul did and Paul was an apostle a teacher pastor prophet evangelist he Paul was all five no doubt he had all five so program tells brother Neville carry on just the way we always have and as you know brother Branham I'm sorry brother Neville never play tapes you can so go online and I liked I think I have a DVD of it as well and you can listen to many of brother Neville's sermons I need to find that and share that with the Saints if I forget somebody remind me he didn't play tapes so here you know nine months before the seals brother BAM still tells and carried on the same way and then I read you two quotes from the seals where one quote from the seals where brother BAM said evangelists should continue on the field don't change a thing and then six months after that it's in 1964 they asked brother Branham should you preach only and he said no we need more preachers start preaching we need them and then in part two the RAM says mate today count and then brother the man instead just like the early fathers whenever revival strikes you're really excited right away but then brother Branson starts to cool off he says and that's where you do you gotta it happens everybody no doubt we began with a really on a hot fire right thank God but then it starts to dim down a little bit he said but you gotta hold the fort if Christ doesn't come in your day you gotta hold the fort so the next generation knows how to serve the Lord and so that's what we're doing by the grace of Lord of milligram said that's prophecy as well because I'll restore sayeth the Lord so we know that coming the Lord is close to the hand but we don't know when and so it could be our generation the next or next we don't know so we got to keep planting the seeds keep preaching and all the predestinated souls will receive God's Word praise the Lord thank God for that now we saw this striking quote where brother Ram said he doesn't have he didn't have one speck of the meeting of the Holy Ghost in June of 62 as far as his upcoming meetings he didn't know what to do and it was because he'll read a little bit more of it tonight that he had the vision or the dream rather to store up food sort of tapes in Jeffersonville it was important to see that that you know you can be a Holy Ghost filled prophet with amazing gifts no one had a gift like brother Branham get the discernment a son of man ministry and yet he felt like he had no leading on what to do that's because God orders the footsteps of the righteous praise God God knew what he was doing and that's the beauty church of going back and listen to brother ground sermons and and seeing all that he said about his ministry because then we can see what happened after it and that gives us perfect 20/20 vision right it's 20/20 we're getting good vision about the fivefold ministry praise God and that's what we can do that's the blessing of having all those sermons and testimonies on tape because you can see what happened afterward what did God do after the Prophet said this thisthis had this leading or no leading here you can see what God did remember in the seven seals Bramson those were the greatest meetings he ever had I think about that just nine months earlier he's felt like he had no leading then nine months later he preached the greatest sermons of his life so Church it ought encourages never give up even if you feel far away from God don't feel anointing stay with God stay with God's Word the Holy Ghost will return praise God God remember like Hezekiah the Bible said the Spirit of God left Hezekiah to test him and maybe God's strong anointing over your mind if you're born again your soul that anointing will never leave but maybe that strong anointing he's always on my thoughts he's I'm always singing a voice worship I'm always meditating on God if if God allows that anointing to let up let us ever remain faithful just be just as diligent just go through the motions without feelings up here because you know your soul feels that praise God if you really love God you'll feel in your soul praise God and just stay with God because God will order your footsteps like we read in Philippians 1:6 God is faithful to finish what he started aren't you glad he started something in your life let him finish it then don't walk away don't turn away and go back like a pig to its mud or a dog to its vomit just keep pressing on and you'll receive the end of your faith the salvation of your soul praise God and then on Sunday night we looked at brother Branham saying he didn't call himself a prophet because he didn't operate like a prophet and then we saw his standing in the gap that brother Branham admitted part of the reason he said I want to be a maybe I'm a prophet in the Old Testament was so he could have an excuse to go hunt so part of the reason he wanted to be away from the people and part of the reason that Complex came up along was because of selfishness he wanted to go hunt instead of spending the time traveling and being with the people but I love how the Lord is so faithful right we might get thoughts and our minds and complexes in our minds but God is faithful to correct us God will correct us even work we might be so close to making a decision that would destroy our testimony it might destroy our lives or ministries we might be so close but at that crucial moment the Holy Ghost will come on the scene praise God and know guide us direct us he's faithful praise God we've given God responsibility for our lives praise the Lord that's the key of David Wright we've Christ has the key of David our responsibility is on his shoulder so Jesus is responsible for our testimony he will finish what he started amen and then God told by the brand do the work an evangelist okay and then we show not Paul as a prophet apostle teacher okay now part three everything new here from going forward here now at this point of the taking sides with Jesus brother man goes back to explaining why he cannot be a prophet and an evangelist at the same time now you and I as far as me we know what was preached on Sunday we showed the balance from the scripture a prophet can do that a prophet can be a pastor for a while and then evangelist or teacher he can be all those at the same time like when Paul establish Ephesus he was the pastor he was the missionary that started that he prayed for them he got the Holy Ghost right and then he was no doubt teaching them for three years he was doing all that at the same time and so we know from the Word of God and from standing in the gap that this part brother Branham would have corrected later on so brother man says he said he's always mixed the two offices he says where I've always fussed about so brother Branham always fussed with that because he thought well you can't miss mix offices but then a year later God shows him he can so that's important to see there no he brother man repeats it again and he says a prophet has thus saith the Lord he said you don't hold meetings and discuss things he's got the word Lord for whoever he said - he don't fool around with the group churches now look we just read it on Sunday from acts 15 Paul did meet with churches often Paul did many times he would meet with churches and especially the ministers and train them and teach them we saw that that was indeed scriptural and then brother Graham goes into how he had a restless spirit and I think it's important to say that brother Graham said I've never felt I should live in Indiana isn't that strange see because he had to be a traveling missionary and evangelist around the world seven times right he had to have this feeling in his soul right with the plan of God and he never felt like he should live in Indiana he thought he should and that's why he traveled and then member where he moved out west in 1963 but see many of these great desires in our hearts they're there for a reason remember he died at 56 right so he really didn't even accomplish that desire to not live in Jeffersonville T will use 53 so see many of these many of your leadings children in your hearts and my heart they may lay there for years and decades but if God is behind that just wait on it just wait don't try to force it yourself remember my brother Graham had to wait on it he had that you had to see the man upfront never put a stake in his yard and then he went up and talked to him and then he said Oh Jefferson Mills widening the lane he said okay he said and told his wife he said there was a vision on that and go find the vision he said honey pack the bags we're moving west so see that's that's what you and I need to do don't jump ahead of God's plan stay right in God's plan stay a faithful daughter right until you see God's leadership stay a faithful son right until you see God's perfect will until you see God over the door Amen so your any times you're your character your human character your your nature will match your ministry all right you said you said there's no settling down place for me I just can't do it I'm Restless shifting place the place I can't help it so he had to be that way in order to perform all five folds of the fivefold ministry praise God all right now brother Graham now goes into some repeated thoughts about telling the brothers no matter what happens in your ministries take everything back to the word he didn't say the tape Richie we know the tapes have wonderful things on them but tapes only point to the word the word is the absolute so brother man says this he says we've got fine men just recently there was a revival broke out in the church here amongst the people the spirit come among them begin to give gifts I watched it to see if it go off into fanaticism every time you start moving that way the spirit would check it and bring it back here I thought praise the Lord he said see you just hold your place he'll give some more examples in just a moment but that's a good point to tell those ministers no matter what goes on who gets excited and also the opposite is true too no matter how excited you get or how low you get take everything back to the word we kind of dealt with that when we preached those series it was 20-some sermons on the seasons of life right no matter what season God makes everything beautiful in his own seas and praise God so we just have to be patient perhaps our the biggest thing about patience is being patient with God brother Graham says he has to keep moving like Abraham right Abraham was kinda like a father of that faith brother Graham was like the father of this message and then brother man two local situations here and this is important to show how church leaders should respect the votes of the people and the voices of the people so this was to like this is like me I should hear the voices of the people mother may have said I believe in the present time we need a church and people say well what about putting all that money in the church if the Lord is going to come let me have encounters that thought and says well what good is it going to do to keep the money if the Lord comes so there's a good balance right because something I have some quotes or milligrams says how can they be spend five million dollars on a new building and then missionaries don't have Bibles overseas so you have to be led of the Lord you know if you're gonna build a church or spend millions and millions of dollars because perhaps and if I have a hundred million dollars he said I would start doing missionary campaigns across this nation to get this nation ready for the coming of the Lord for he's God so we know his heart was in missionary I would work ministry that's what his spirit right that was that the spirit God gave him he said if the people designated the money for the church so like a building fund like we started a few years ago I think there's still 600 or 700 dollars laying in that building fund he says it's our duty with a hundred percent vote here that I took that night to build the church so build it I'd say build it okay so we never voted on building a church which is fine you know we'd have to be in a financial position and do that but I'm showing you that's when a preacher and the Deacons and the trustees must go ahead when they've got the money set aside specifically for the building fund and then they can build as long as a church votes for it well Graham said if the Lord is coming next week let's start building the church this week beautifully let's show him let's stand at our posted beauty and then when the church he said then the church is built up he says what if he's coming ten years from now what if he's twenty years has been 55 right this is for the 55th year this December will be the 55th year since brother Branham left the scene what if it's a hundred years whatever it is when he comes it matters not we know they'll be coming for us before that time because we can't live it out 100 years or more he'll be coming for us when we got to leave parties behind us he says why not then let the church board here speak into them now build that church put it up here make it nice a nice place where the people can come see if you want if you built something you want to make it look nice like when we started renting out that building we want to paint it clean it up get a new carpet make it look nice for the people it's God's house right I remember the days of Hagee I had a I had to bawl out Israel because they were spending more time on their houses than God's house that's a good way to start his focus on God's house put God's house first when that's done now you move on to your house then brother Branham suggests that brother Neville be the pastor as long as the people vote him in as long as they have the leading of the Lord all right now now brother Graham moves on now he goes back to addressing all the preachers there so not just brother Neville and Brown Tabernacle now he goes back to all the guest ministers he named some like brother Christ for the junior Jackson brother JT Parnell brother Beeler he says now you be associated here together he talks about in Jeffersonville you can't go down and meet with the mess Methodist you have no fellowship with them the Baptist you go talking about speaking in tongues the baptism in Jesus name they kick you out that quick and he snaps his finger that's right you sit around here you'd be like a dove I'm sorry sitting around there you'd be like a dove amongst a bunch of crows you have no fellowship at all he says you die and I'm not making fun of Methodists and Baptists now I'm talking about fellowship he says he said many of you here men of God calling in your life he said you be doing something just don't set around let's do something you don't get but one soul saved get that one soul saved each of us Church that's what we should do try to get one soul saved remember a couple years ago I think it was two years ago I got that email from that person that repented after watching my baptism video and I never heard back from him they're out in California they said the baptism video brought them to salvation they were gonna be go be baptized and then she said you saved my soul and I said well I hope so by God's grace I hope that that individual stayed true to God and is trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation if that's all we can do let's do that let's save souls I remember church this too even with this recent ministry with the the Jeffersonville tape church movement the Bible says when you turn someone from the heir of his way you hide a multitude of sin I believe that ministry was really important look when it comes out in 2020 you know with the perfect vision of the Word of God now the taking sides with Jesus no doubt many people are in error and those movements and so we trust the Holy Spirit to direct people away from a man-made interpretation backed it with God's Word right here and it will hide a multitude of sin especially idol worship and worshipping brother Branham okay now then he tells the preachers he said after you know jeffersonville builds the church make this like a headquarters and like brother Neville here a senior elder among you seeing sometimes you got a question that you can't discuss out your church bring it here - brother Neville and you discuss it all together if you can't come to any decision I'll be coming by pretty soon then we'll all come together with it and then in there get training in your own groups other ministers cease preaching he's preaching to ministers not take players he says men that you see has a calling of God in their life for the ministry train them young men bring them in here to the elder my brother Neville all of you set together in a minister meeting and there teach the deeper things of God now what kind of person would say we don't need teaching in this day brother Graham says the main place we need teaching is preachers we need a pre-cut preacher an elder senior outer preacher who can really teach God's Word to teach the other preachers decision on a topic he said I'll be coming around soon to help pray pray about it he says but keep someone you can have confidence in to be kind of like a leader for you okay so you know cam and I always look to like brother Brooks as just a leader if we need any help or if we need any special prayer we'll look out to him you know runarounds kind of make it look like mentor you need like a mentor some figure where you look up and you can see how they've served the Lord before and God has spoken to you through that individual and you kind of look to them for guidance and help we all need it praise God we all need it so number have says yes trade up a group of men he says and then if I'm in an evangelistic work somewhere there's places I can place them worldwide see this was brother branham's vision to keep traveling start revivals then call back to Jefferson though and say can you send a young minister to kind of pastor and train this flock for six months or a year now this is now he goes into an example another example of India what if I was in India and go back and maybe you would have thousands of people stay there week or two and see the ministry they love it they believe it's a truth they come out of heathenism and maybe in two or three weeks when I was over there maybe a hundred thousand converted to Christ nowhere to go the next day take a plane and start back to Rome then the United States leave them just like she put out among wolves but what if I had a group of men young men trained the message to say now wait a minute before I leave we're going to set an order these churches I'll have a man I've already telegrammed them see or texted them for us so that my telegram they got the money so see storing up money for mission work there on their road here now to take over this a good man this is two or three young men with them who be helpers and assistants now isn't that a beautiful pattern a beautiful system if God's people can have that I know the brothers that have worked in Japan I've tried to do that Simon's try to do that we prayed for a pastor to raise up in Thailand I know for sure the the Canadian churches have done that in China the win a futile converts let's train up those converts and then move on ordain them as elders this is the Apostolic pattern so brother Graham said Church of this faith see our message faith can be set there which would be an outpost in India he said then get an outpost in Germany outpost in Switzerland why right now we should have them all around the nations where I've been and the message then from there comes another comes another comes another see what I mean so to see churches multiplying out of churches then brother Brown gives the example of Joseph mattes and bows a brother lawyers help me a few years ago I preached on it and you know Joseph met Matson Bose a he believes someone what brother Branham said but he never really could take a stand on it and that's what brother Ivan even says in this sermon take against the Falcons with Jesus so by the Lord I did appreciate that correction if you're listening or watching he didn't really fully believe all the message brother I've said that one man Joseph Matson bows a went into a certain country I can't remember where it was he went to a mission work I done say but his headquarters was Chicago and then on his mission work they'd start churches he would call back to Chicago telegram Chicago they would send money and missionaries to all these churches he said now Joseph Matson boses churches have tens of thousands that came out of one little revival and program says Joseph was not a man with gifts just a man who had enough courage to go there and start and have this ordained apostolic system remember that's what Randy sighs his dad did right wear a nice ice is dead started the church when he saw Randy was old enough he basically surprised Randy and said now you're gonna past her if I'm leaving and then he flew off to India and they started all there's many many churches he was one of the first ministers in India and then he would ordain elders in each of those churches and then more churches would spring out of all those churches well Graham says what could have been done under this message if Matson Bozek could get 10,000 without a gift and discernment what couldn't brother branham have done he said it could be raking in the millions sure we've lost that time that's what my suggestion would be now there is there's some evidence to say that this has sort of happened especially if you look at the United States and Canada right because in Canada brother ed mystical got saved and look what he's done you know many churches sprung out of his Tim protis you know was there a brother Rams ministry even as a young child and a church started there right messenger started there from his family actually and no doubt other ones have spread out from all these different locations brother Tim Humes you know look at him his family was there to go down to North Carolina so program plainly tells us that's the vision now next back to the ministers he said if there's disagreeing amongst the ministers he said stay in fellowship he said if you say because he don't believe like me I ain't going to fellowship then there's something wrong with you he said it's not wrong with the other fellows I'm wrong with you when you brethren who are trying to hold together they talks about how the Branham boys used to fight in the backyard but then they would fight anyone who came against the branham's in the front yard he said see you'd fight you do that you're family but we're still your brothers that's the way it is we might different that's all right well we're still one we're one in Christ we believe this message let's stay with it so as long as people are staying close you know to the message we keep fellowshipping now the bible does say if someone starts a heresy or a blasphemous doctrine and we don't fellowship with them we try to correct them and then the Bible said separate yourself from them mark them that caused a division contrary to the faith that we've received so when someone starts preaching like that we do have a right to separate ourselves now let's get to this where Bodrum tells us just to keep working again no this will just encourage us right let's just be encouraged me he said I think that's a thing to do keep on carried on until Jesus comes see you've got to be enthused with with it if you're not enthused there's something wrong so church you and I we got a look at our our lives and our attitudes if we're not enthused with God something's wrong with us right we're not enthused to get up in the morning and spend time with the Lord and do our ministry something is wrong with us we got to go back to the cross we got to go back to Passover right like Paul says you got to go back to sincerity the unleavened bread the feast of unleavened bread the feast of sincerity and truth we got to go back to those festivals and what was the festivals like a Sabbath see we got to go have that time alone with the Lord I said not say well last month I was pretty enthused but now I don't know see there's something wrong somewhere you got to be enthused all the time just keep punching he says like the devil is trying to get you he said like our last president mr. Eisenhower said he said many times we were fighting we picked up a shell and throwed it in to the gun pulled the hammer let her fall and it snapped it didn't go off well he said we didn't surrender we might have to put another one in and a snap too we didn't give up we kept on snapping till one went off praise God he said that's the way to win the war keep trying all church keep trying keep praying for your family friends keep trying to witness the loved ones keep praying for people to be healed keep trying one of these times it's gonna go off praise God throw the shell and pull it you got a purpose a target to hit and if it don't go off throw it out throw another one and try it again throw it in and try it again it goes off there's one of them in there that's alive and one of them will go off and that's the way we got to do just keep firing away fired away until something happens now here brother heaven goes back and he makes another statement kind of like the statement about not having one speck of leading he says what am i doing I'm firing away now I'm going out out here not even he says not not no even out any leading so brother have said he was just going out evangelizing different churches without a real leading and he says a responsibility he says there's millions of people looking at me what is he gonna do what's his next move some some things I'm gonna die some things this remember when the gun exploded in his face that was shortly before this see everything around the country see but you've got to contend with all that then you then you got the burden to the people so you're contending with everybody's attitude about you everything they say about you now I'm on that brother branham then you have to deal with all the burdens of the people your fam your local church right all your local minister friends so you know you could say it's even expanded in this hour right because now anybody can contact me you know through email or phone call or text which is okay it's not that much but we kind of get an idea how by the round we'll get calls for around the world right because we have whatsapp and you can get a text from Ghana you know brother William and you get a text almost instantly from overseas I got them from India quite often and then Africa as well brother Branham says I know you have burdens brothers but he says I got a great responsibility and brother Ram that makes a statement they must been in some of their hearts the preachers that must have been you know thinking brother Ram had it easy but he says you say well that ought to be easy for you brother branham anything you do to God just tells you no he doesn't he said I sweat it out just like you doing a whole lot harder sure I have to sweat it out much harder than you he said there's going to be more required of me where you have to answer for a church where you have to answer for your family or maybe just yourself see there's millions of souls I got to answer for I got to know my moves you know Satan is knocking you for once old church did you ever sure to never consider that the reason we battle Saint many times he's trying to keep us from winning your friends to Christ that's why Satan tries to discourage you he's just trying to keep you from winning those couple souls for me then same thing for me Satan battles me defeat stir tries to defeat me and discourage me to try to get me away from ministering to the people that are in my ministry in my circle of influence right so the more people you have influence over the MOL Satan's gonna try to attack you so you got to be faithful he said how many blass is satan throwing in here at me he said that's why I get nervous sometimes can say in his battling him so hard and now he finally brings up the dream about storing up tapes he said I'm going to keep throwing in the shells one of them's gonna fire somewhere we're gonna be on target so what it does fire I'll hit the object I'm shooting at all of you would be on target see what I mean I'm leaving for these meetings just plunging out yonder I don't aim to teach these great things I teach you people you remember that dream when I got the interpretation was go back and storm food where was that storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here that will compare with the message that we have amen that's how it is today what church in Akron can compare with the message that we've got praise God Amen it's all back to the Bible like I told you on Sunday same thing for the ramp said if I saw something greater in the word I'd go support it but there's not this is the greatest thing we have the revelation of God's Word so brother Branham says the food is stored up he said he said we got the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and water baptism and we're getting out from denominational Creed's to see that that's what the message was meant to do point us to Jesus Christ and take us away from denomination crease now this other quote just came to me while I was preparing today about headquarters see people look at this dream store up the tapes make that your headquarters and they think every church's headquarters is Jefferson but that's not true form after brother Branham preached this in October of 62 he said that's the reason I have no denomination I have one headquarters that's from heaven wherever he sends there I go whatever he says I say we don't want no denomination this church ever talk about a denomination you've lost your pastor right then isn't that something quite fitting for today situation in the tape church movement so I just want you to show you this yeah brother Brown said my tapes get stored in the headquarters at Jeffersonville but he said really every Christians headquarters is heaven praise God he was not trying to make it and all you have to do church is look in the last paragraph of the church age book brother man closes it in such a beautiful fashion he said I never come to get people to follow me or join my church he said I come to restore a true relationship between Jesus Christ and man hallelujah thank God amen that's what he come to restore that's what we had that's what I have by God's grace if you're a believer that's what you have a real relationship with Jesus Christ how they do you now after this vision or this dream rather of storing up tapes he says it's on tapes it'll go worldwide where people in their houses the tapes will fall right into the hands of the predestinated of God he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to its course that's three and he sent me back to do this store up the food here he forbid me to go overseas so just as Paul was forbidden to go into Asia brother Ram was forbidden to go overseas with brother argabright probably maybe you remember that vision or Argan bright was gonna take him over and one little boat to go to one little meeting and then take his wife and have him tour Africa but just preached one sermon brother Graham said no that doesn't seem like it's fitting to the Word of God and that's after that when he had no vision or the dream of the story of the tapes brother man who said I've pressed right up to the mark now but I don't know which way to go no we know why God was slowing him down in order to preach the seven seals right him to move out west go out west meet the seven angels God was slowing him down stirring up all those sermons and then bringing him back to preach the seven seals and the token and marriage and divorce to finish his ministry Lorenza don't know which way to go but there's ammunition layin all around me turds ah this word is our hand munition it's laid right in front of us keep shooting praise God keep keep pulling the hammer right keep trying to shoot eventually it's going to hit the target praise God program said he called me to evangelism because he called me to foreign missions as he called me to be his prophet might a pastor somewhere whatever I'm gonna do just keep throwing and shell pulling the hammer on it one of them will go off but I'm just not going to stand and say look or Lord you put the shell on the gun right so if you're another hunter but we have a BB gun a BB gun is not gonna fire itself right I've got to put the BB load it and then I'm al-qaida linear' malachi dedication like to shoot more so than I did but I was using that humans have to do something don't sit around and say come on God move look what the Word of God says obey it make sure have a leading to do it right we said the beginning David had a leading the wind in the Marberry bush but you might not see the results that you want to see right away but just whatever God has led you to do do it under the leadership of God be faithful to it and pretty soon God will bless you he says I'm gonna put the shell in the gun do the polling myself let him do the fire and he's the one to take care of that let me just keep moving on hallelujah brother he's gonna go out and preach an evangelistic messages he says so you've got something on your mind the people here once a church build as quick as you can get it up get your teachers and things you brethren how you are with your middle churches and you want to you're doing a work God will reward you for that go out there and preach doing everything you can look what you tell these preachers you don't to tell the play tapes preach the word then all of you get together a bunch of men have meetings talk on the deep things of Scripture now he goes back to giving them another reminder about if something rises up judge it by the word then if you find out look like something's moving up and you're just gonna find out it gets a little bit off the word then be careful no matter how good it looks stop right there a wrong spirit struck you coz the message of this day is back to the word this is this is beautiful you can say back to the tape although we respect the tapes back to the word so the message of the day is go back to the word and the tapes point us back to the word such a balance praise God then he gives an example you say oh brother Graham I'll tell you someone so why so is so stood the other night and us other things taking place he said watch it close don't renounce anything just wait and see how it acts so watch how the people act during their move and then watch how they act afterwards and then bring it up to the word and see how it compares with the word and if it compares with the word and everything is fine thank God and just keep moving on then see just as long as it stays in the word that's my opinion what I think you should do oh boy we're almost done here just a few more quotes and they'll be yeah bout 10 minutes we'll have an hour so it's so clear Church is so beautiful brother and even says a scriptural Isle restore its God's system we have to go back to doing it just how Paul did it brother Graham name's the ministers that were there for the Neville Brothers Ruddle brother Crais brother Beeler for the June Jackson for the Terry Lynn Charlie Cox David there was at least nine men there he says God anoint you my I would like to pick up a handful of you to be an evangelism and set you somewhere see knowing that you've come up you can stand and know the message and study to prove yourself you feel you got a call on your life what do you quote second Timothy 2:15 study ourselves approved unto God as a minister not ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth praise God so seen brother man was just quoting scripture for preachers the whole time oh thank you Jesus he said I'm getting old brother Neville's getting old we're middle-aged men as time rolls on we're gonna be off the scene after a while you got to fill our shoes he says that maybe and that day even will be grow greater if there is a tomorrow some other man I thought the message might even grow greater in the future now we know one thing the latter rain would be the greatest anointing we've seen if we have to see it but it'll be a smaller group of people but greater anointing he said now that's what I think to you brethren you Minister said together discuss the things you gotta have fellowship somewhere you gotta have something to come together kind of talk about you all come together as a group of men but leave one with another like that discuss these problems sent out maybe once a month just ministers alone and then he says when he travels back around he'll visit them and meet with the ministers I don't know if this ever happened but this is on tape this was his vision for the brother and if you can get the preacher straight and him going right look what he's going to do he's gonna influence it would take care of hundreds of these things or problems that's it we're just beating at you see we've got to get it a system God's system so we can clearly see God's system just like Paul is for the the senior elder man to teach the younger man and then these younger men are sent out and they teach others that's thank God we're living in that right now in our church thank God problems all solved my connection is unstable well Lord willing we'll try to finish up here sorry Church if is if you're losing us sorry this computer is as far away from the router as possible I gotta find a maybe I need to find a better place to put it maybe next week and then brother RAM quotes the scripture of Jethro telling Moses you have too much burden on you you need to have other men help you that's what you read out of numbers 11 and that he said that was God's Way back there that was God's Way in the early church age I mean that's God's Way now right for us to do it so just quit talking about it and do it numbers 11 God took the spirit on Moses and put it upon the people the other 70 men that they could judge the easy things and the hard things they couldn't judge they'd bring it to Moses so Moses had a lot less work to do at church that's what I believe happened today if I'm born again of the real baptism of the Holy Ghost the token life of Jesus Christ I've got the same spirit as brother Brendan the Holy Spirit now not the same gifts but the same Holy Spirit that will still rightly divide the word of truth it will continue going on rightly invited rightly to fighting the word of truth if that was God's Way then with Paul Polycarp you know John Paulette carp are anus it has to be God's Way today then brother Ram with his prayer before he gets into the regular sermon part he prays for a sick woman but then he starts praying for the preachers here and we'll close with this right on time 824 man prays Oh Heavenly Father I'm thinking of maybe when I rainiest sat with his group of ministers he said on cold slabs of rock he said they knew they were going to be fed to the Lions and died as martyrs but the faith of our fathers is living still in spite of the dungeon the flame and the sword I thank you Lord for these men I pray that you'll bless them now bless each of them in thy name that you will keep them in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that never will they vary from that see any direction out of this word and out of this group may you send pastors teachers and evangelist oh God granted and may they hold the fort everywhere wherever they are may they continually work until Jesus comes god bless you let's stand praise God that was just perfect timing thank the Lord now we could have read more you know almost the entire chapter of numbers 11 is about Moses he he's dealing with problems he gets so overwhelmed he said God did I did I bear and conceived all the night bring forth all these children these two million people complaining and so God hears Moses's desperate prayer and then divides that spirit multiplies it upon the people and then all the saints they got that spirit start prophesying and somebody says Moses tell him to be quiet and Moses said to to God that all men would prophesy in other words Moses was rejoicing that each person is the ministry had found an anointing that's what I desire for our church everybody can find us on the North thing of the Holy Ghost to do a powerful supernatural ministry whether it's you know praying whether it's fasting feeding the hungry right clothing people that need clothes helping people you know all the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit you know there's the the gifts of the Deacons you know others there's so much that we can do for the kingdom of God to find the leadership Oh dreams and prophecy yes words of knowledge words of wisdom all those gifts to the Holy Spirit that's our prayer that's my prayer let's pray for that tonight I know that's your prayer to that each person could be so anointed they'll have like the same holy spirit of truth that was on brother Branham to preach the truth that should be anointing me this should be anointing all real men of God and their churches let's pray for that by God's grace praising let's just bar heads forward pressures dear Lord in heaven we thank you Mullen for tonight dear God we're grateful to see this apostolic pattern God's system went to God that all men and women would prophesy we know the spirit of Jesus Christ is a spirit of prophecy so father I thank you lord I give you a praise honor and glory thank you for guiding us Lord tonight through these quotes Lord we take each one back to the word we can see Ellie they line up with God's Word Paul's ministry focuses ministry help us Lord to carry on like they did with God's system each person our church will be so anointed that they'll try facade their fall to foretell the future to give a word of wisdom or knowledge they'll pray for the sick and they'll recover or do America read it Jesus went to God each person was so anointed and the Spirit of God would rest upon each one granted Jesus that's my home a prayer prepares for that coming up Muslim work keep putting in shell after shell pulling the hammer until something hits the target a soul gets a you probably knew someone gets healed someone gets born again of the Holy Ghost let us keep pulling the hammer God you're in charge for the firing Lord thank you Jesus we love you tonight no bless your people your divine presence as we prepare for the Sunday service for Father's Day

understanding how he had to wait to the leadership of your spirit moved him from ministry to ministry Lord I believe the same for my life food and trust the people of God and a current believe the same for their life you'll make it so obvious it was so obvious there brother Brenda my visions of those time to move out west you'll make it so obvious to us you came to a divisions and go back and
