[29:08] let's go to Matthew chapter 5 by God's
[29:11] grace I wanted to preach the inspired
[29:20] thoughts out of this book here shaping
[29:22] the history through prayer and fasting
[29:23] so I'm going to start on that tonight by
[29:26] God's grace
[29:27] sorry limit your net makeup and then of
[29:31] course we'll be working on the Ephesians
[29:33] series still by God's grace one reason
[29:38] is because this book focuses on prayer
[29:42] and how it affects the governments and
[29:45] how Christians have a calling to pray
[29:48] for their governments and I think that's
[29:51] very important especially as we know the
[29:55] last showdown is between the nominations
[29:59] and the word right and that but the
[30:03] denominations will be united with the
[30:05] government so there's a great connection
[30:08] here and I want to just start looking at
[30:11] tonight like I'm just taking some of the
[30:13] inspired thoughts out of here I'll be
[30:15] tying it in with what we believe of
[30:17] course I want to start looking at that
[30:19] especially as we go towards the election
[30:20] in November right because remember it's
[30:24] got to be so close it could deceive the
[30:26] very elect if it were possible so
[30:29] whatever whenever the government comes
[30:30] down to getting really close we will get
[30:33] close to the rapture the government and
[30:35] the churches it's got to be so close so
[30:39] it's important that we pray especially
[30:42] for the government and that we have
[30:44] peace and so forth that we can
[30:46] continually spread the gospel
[30:49] so Matthew chapter 5 verse 13 I just
[30:52] want to start here with this salt of the
[30:54] earth tonight I want to start with that
[30:55] salt of the earth what was so inspiring
[31:03] about this book though was not only to
[31:05] see you remember a few months ago I
[31:08] preached on how America was founded
[31:10] through prayer and fasting that's what
[31:14] gave us the victories over the British
[31:17] was prayer and fasting but that also the
[31:21] last chapter is all about the latter
[31:24] rain
[31:24] it was so inspired and this this
[31:26] gentleman I don't know if he knew about
[31:27] brother Branham or not but I'm talking
[31:30] about the latter rain preparing for that
[31:32] so I just see a lot of there was a lot
[31:34] of inspiration and so I'm just going to
[31:36] be preaching a few inspired thoughts out
[31:38] of here because I can see how it
[31:40] connects to our day so let's just read
[31:43] Matthew 5:13 then we'll be will pray and
[31:46] have you be seated here by God's grace
[31:50] now this morning we were looking at how
[31:52] you're the light right we're locked
[31:53] walking the light we're not in the
[31:56] darkness we're in the light
[31:57] that's what verse 14 is all about and
[31:59] verse 15 how we are walking light we are
[32:02] the light and the light has shined in
[32:05] our hearts so it gives two illustrations
[32:07] that the Lord gives two illustrations
[32:09] were salt and we're light so we looked
[32:11] at light this morning we're walking the
[32:12] light we're redeeming the time that's
[32:14] what the light allows us to do redeem
[32:16] the time because we're not walking in
[32:18] darkness we know what we're doing
[32:19] but this thought is about the salt of
[32:21] the earth and how salt has two
[32:23] properties so we'll be looking at that
[32:24] tonight as we begin looking at history
[32:28] through prayer and fasting praise God
[32:32] so verse 13 let's read that together 1 2
[32:34] 3 ye are the salt of the earth but if
[32:39] the salt have lost its savor wherewith
[32:42] shall it be salted it is thenceforth
[32:44] good for nothing but to be cast out and
[32:48] to be trodden under foot of men praise
[32:52] now let's have a word of Prayer if every
[32:54] non you're heartless making owner to God
[32:56] here we're just so thankful to be
[32:57] gathered together thankful for another
[32:59] opportunity to be in his presence Lord
[33:02] Heavenly Father were just so happy to be
[33:04] in your presence as we said in your
[33:06] house Lord God we know judgment begins
[33:08] here so Lord let your wisdom let your
[33:11] judgments let your truth as we saw this
[33:13] morning proving what is acceptable unto
[33:16] you may you prove what is acceptable
[33:18] Lord God and in our lives Lord be the
[33:20] salt of the earth may we not lose our
[33:23] savor Lord as as Jesus talks about here
[33:27] Lord God let us keep our saltiness Lord
[33:29] God and let us be a a preserving agent
[33:33] Lord in this in this world Lord that
[33:36] lacks so much they lack light they law
[33:39] they live like savor Lord and father let
[33:42] us be the salt in light of the earth
[33:44] dear God we love you Lord God prepares
[33:46] for thy coming Lord in Jesus Christ's
[33:49] name
[33:49] the church said amen god Beth should be
[33:52] in season praise go so I want to first
[33:58] look at the history here of a little bit
[34:01] of US history about salt I preached on
[34:04] this years and years and years ago I
[34:06] just thought I'd dig it up here real
[34:08] quick so saw as you know has preserving
[34:14] properties before they had refrigerators
[34:16] you know they would store meat in a cold
[34:18] place with salt but salt used in the
[34:23] Eastern countries was a chemical
[34:25] compound called chloride of sodium and
[34:29] if the saltness were lost or it were to
[34:32] lose it saver there would be nothing
[34:34] remaining it enters into the very nature
[34:37] of the substances says in Eastern
[34:40] countries however the salt used was
[34:42] impure or mingled with vegetable or
[34:45] earthly substances so that it might lose
[34:48] the whole of its saltness and a
[34:51] considerable quantity of earthy matter
[34:54] remain this was good for nothing except
[34:57] that it was used to place in the paths
[35:00] or walks as we use gravel
[35:05] this kind of salt is still common in
[35:07] that country so you know today we get
[35:11] our salt from salt mines right well in
[35:13] those days they didn't get it from salt
[35:15] mines at least in the eastern part of
[35:18] the world it listed in here they got it
[35:20] from some yeah they got it from marshes
[35:24] of Cyprus ok so that's where they would
[35:27] get it they said from the marshes of
[35:29] Cyprus so it had it wasn't just plain
[35:33] salt it was combined with something else
[35:35] and it could lose its savour and so
[35:40] Jesus he just got done preaching about
[35:42] the blessed the Beatitudes right how we
[35:46] must be blessed praise God we must do
[35:49] what God wants us to do and then he
[35:51] tells us you are salt of the earth and
[35:54] we lose our savour we're good for
[35:57] nothing right if the believers lose
[36:01] their saltiness their ability to be salt
[36:04] then what are they good for right I
[36:07] think we're seeing that today right like
[36:09] the Laodicean Church it's good for
[36:11] nothing you know why it's good for
[36:13] nothing because it doesn't feel like it
[36:14] needs anything right like we saw this
[36:17] morning I don't feel like they have to
[36:18] take care of their time they don't feel
[36:20] like they have to be walking the light
[36:24] so see he said they have need of nothing
[36:26] and so here Jesus says when they're like
[36:29] that they're good for nothing so we want
[36:33] to have a salty influence upon the world
[36:36] praise God and we know salt is a
[36:38] preserver I want to start looking at
[36:41] some of my notes here as I made so Jesus
[36:45] speaking to his disciples all of us and
[36:49] first thing is salt gives flavor
[36:53] how many put too much salt on their food
[36:56] now you'd have to raise ham for that see
[37:01] many times we think food is unappetizing
[37:03] because it's must be seasoned right you
[37:08] know it's interesting the Bible even
[37:09] says that you know job's 6:6 says that
[37:11] can that which is unsavory be eaten
[37:13] without salt even joe recognizes how
[37:18] things you can't eat without salt it's
[37:20] it could be important so in other words
[37:23] the presence of salt makes all the
[37:25] difference okay and as Christians we
[37:31] make all the difference in this world
[37:33] right so salt causes us to enjoy food
[37:38] that otherwise probably wouldn't want to
[37:40] eat right and so Christians give flavor
[37:46] to the earth but the one who enjoys the
[37:49] flavor is God right of course God and
[37:53] believers as well because listen any
[37:56] sinner should never meet a more
[37:58] wonderfully tasted person than you and I
[38:02] okay maybe not under saying that exactly
[38:05] right way but they should never find a
[38:07] better flavor of a person than a
[38:09] Christian yes because you got the taste
[38:11] of love right they they can sense love
[38:14] they can sense God's Spirit on you so
[38:17] but God is well uh God is the one who
[38:20] are gets it gets this this taste of our
[38:23] life because our life is a
[38:24] sweet-smelling savour unto the Lord
[38:27] right and I think we read that this
[38:29] morning and I'm going to check that real
[38:31] quick Ephesians 5
[38:32] I believe it's verse 1 and 2 this
[38:34] morning just getting me get that real
[38:36] quick yes verse to walk in love so there
[38:39] is the love love of God as Christ has
[38:42] also loved us and has given himself and
[38:44] offering and a sweet and I'm sorry to
[38:47] sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling
[38:49] savour now you remember in Philippians
[38:51] member Paul was sent a gift by the
[38:54] Philippian church and he said it's a
[38:55] sweet-smelling savour and in them in the
[38:58] nostrils of the Lord so see when we
[39:01] serve other people we serve other
[39:03] Christians we even help the poor however
[39:05] we hover we serve other people when we
[39:08] sacrifice for them it's like a saver
[39:10] that goes up to God and that's what
[39:13] Jesus says here our lives give flavor to
[39:16] this earth in other words our presence
[39:20] makes the word the earth acceptable unto
[39:23] God right praise God
[39:28] I like that from job good scripture
[39:30] there I'm just looking at my notes here
[39:32] so without Christians on the earth what
[39:37] would God think of the earth wouldn't
[39:40] like it very much
[39:41] in fact that's why God destroyed it at
[39:43] the beginning with Noah right because
[39:45] because he said every thought of every
[39:47] man's heart was only evil continually
[39:50] and God said it it broke his heart that
[39:53] he had made man member elected that of
[39:55] grieving the spirit last week every
[39:58] thought of man hurt God it grieved him
[40:02] in his spirit but because the salt of
[40:05] the the believer is here God still has
[40:08] grace and mercy
[40:09] rather than wrath and judgment so see
[40:13] our presence as Christians makes all the
[40:16] difference and this is all through the
[40:18] scripture so this author gives a few
[40:20] highlights and I just want to read them
[40:22] again and reiterate these because this
[40:26] is going to show us how important is
[40:27] that we pray for the next coming
[40:29] election this is showing us we should
[40:32] pray for the Supreme Court right we
[40:36] should we should pray for righteousness
[40:39] to reign because one thing we know God
[40:41] God doesn't rejoice over sinners loss
[40:44] God wants to save the heart of God wants
[40:49] to save the Bible said his heart is like
[40:51] a shepherd who's going after the loss
[40:53] right he's going after the lost sheep
[40:56] he'll leave the 99 to go get the won
[40:59] praise God he has a Shepherd's heart a
[41:01] God's heart that wants to save others
[41:04] amen now this is clearly illustrated how
[41:10] Abraham and lot were the salt of the
[41:13] earth right now we know Abraham was much
[41:16] more salty right much more salty because
[41:20] his life was closer with the word
[41:23] remember God said I will not destroy the
[41:27] righteous with the wicked that's one
[41:31] great principle that God establishes it
[41:34] is never the will of God that the
[41:36] judgment do to the wicked will come upon
[41:39] the righteous
[41:40] right because 1823 says wilt thou also
[41:44] destroy the righteous with the wicked
[41:47] will you give a righteous person the
[41:50] wrath that belongs to the wicked what
[41:52] does God say no won't do that
[41:56] Abraham asks he said that be far from me
[41:59] in this manner to slay the righteous
[42:01] from the wicked and the righteous should
[42:02] be as the wicked that be far from thee
[42:04] shall not the judge of all the earth do
[42:08] right amen what a great consolation
[42:10] church if things happen in our lives if
[42:13] tragic things happen we know God is a
[42:15] righteous judge of all the earth and
[42:18] there was there will be no unjust with
[42:21] God there'll be no there were nothing
[42:24] that was unfair in God's eyes praise God
[42:27] and so if something happens where it
[42:30] looks like a judgment either that person
[42:31] was being judged or it was a test right
[42:35] there's some sort of test that the
[42:39] person had to go through to endure right
[42:41] in order to win a crown because Paul had
[42:44] to be tested right Paul to go to the
[42:46] martyrs Brook block did he get a martyrs
[42:48] crown praise God amen and so see this is
[42:55] a great example of how the believer is
[42:58] the salt of the earth God made it clear
[43:00] he would not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
[43:02] as long as a believer was there as long
[43:05] as there was salt there he wouldn't
[43:06] destroy it and so we must recognize that
[43:10] as well now I believe this church
[43:12] according to Revelation 13 it seems like
[43:15] at the laying down of the mark of the
[43:17] beast all the foolish virgin will be
[43:19] killed right because they either take
[43:23] the mark of the beast if they take of
[43:24] the mark of the beast their name was
[43:26] never on the book of life and this but
[43:30] this makes sense to me brother bang the
[43:32] foolish virgins will have to die right
[43:34] away if not then they'll be suffering
[43:37] the wrath that goes to all those who
[43:39] worship the Beast but God will not
[43:41] destroy the righteous with the wicked so
[43:46] see how I see how close that is the
[43:48] foolish virgin have to die there because
[43:51] that's the hour they're living in they
[43:53] turn down the
[43:54] the token nine they didn't get bored
[43:57] again and so there's a temporary there's
[44:01] a temporary test there but see they get
[44:04] eternal life ahead
[44:06] hallelujah they get eternal life but
[44:08] they won't suffer the same wrath that
[44:10] the world suffers they will suffer the
[44:14] seven trumpets it seems like from the
[44:16] scripture they won't suffer the seven
[44:18] vials the seven last plagues because God
[44:21] will not destroy the righteous with the
[44:23] wicked
[44:25] how many thank God for that I thank God
[44:29] what a consolation praise God see praise
[44:38] the Lord
[44:39] now is there a level persecution yes
[44:43] there's a level of persecution for every
[44:46] Christian right it's in 2nd Timothy 3:12
[44:50] yay all that live godly in Christ Jesus
[44:53] shall suffer persecution now as we said
[44:58] before we have we have suffered very
[45:01] little ours is mostly through family
[45:04] right
[45:04] our persecution or people laughing at us
[45:07] making fun of us but yours we actually
[45:09] don't know what's gonna happen in the
[45:10] future right we know there could be
[45:12] something like a squeeze where there
[45:13] could be some pressure but if we think
[45:16] of like Saints like let's say sister
[45:18] Mary just passed away brother Mike Dirnt
[45:20] Oh passed away last summer
[45:21] what persecution today go through you'd
[45:24] have to go down through their life and
[45:26] see what persecution they suffered what
[45:29] trials what suffering right what tests
[45:33] did they have to go through because the
[45:35] Bible said is you live godly you shall
[45:37] suffer persecution remember we showed
[45:39] you brother Rams persecution was being
[45:42] rejected by all the preachers he said
[45:45] I've never suffered any more than I did
[45:47] in Arizona at night when he moved out
[45:49] there in 1963 to 65 suffered because the
[45:54] men spoke against him the men forsook
[45:56] him and Jesus said you'll be sacred were
[45:59] forsaken for all men for my name's sake
[46:02] praise God I don't know you Amen so see
[46:07] there
[46:07] different idea or different applications
[46:09] of persecution but all that live godly
[46:11] in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[46:14] hallelujah so we must be prepared Church
[46:18] to suffer persecution amen
[46:22] now look at this let's go to first
[46:24] Corinthians 1132 since you got your
[46:26] Bibles there let's read out your like
[46:28] this one this good thought God's
[46:31] judgments never come upon the believer
[46:35] there's only a test it's a trial it's
[46:38] never the judgment or wrath of God
[46:41] because we pass from Wrath right
[46:43] we pass from death unto life first
[46:46] Corinthians 11:30 to the salt of the
[46:54] earth and church the next thought will
[46:56] be kings and priests are we kings and
[46:59] priests are we ministering unto God for
[47:02] our government like a man and I were
[47:05] talking yesterday you know we were we
[47:06] were desiring for more people in the
[47:09] church but that was our question that we
[47:11] talked about who here and our church
[47:13] have been praying and laboring for more
[47:15] souls to be saved because jesus said you
[47:18] have not because you ask not so what
[47:21] does it do what does God always do he
[47:22] puts it back on us how are we
[47:24] ministering in prayer
[47:25] are we interceding to God right because
[47:30] that's our that's our current office our
[47:32] current office is kings and priests unto
[47:34] God Amen so are we are we active in the
[47:40] offices God gave us that's a great
[47:43] question and that's the question we got
[47:45] to answer praise the Lord our lives
[47:46] answer that first Corinthians 11 32 but
[47:52] when we are judged we are chastened of
[47:54] the Lord see our judgment is just a
[47:56] chastening it's a child correction right
[47:59] that we should not be condemned with the
[48:02] world amen thank the Lord amen our
[48:06] training is like you correct your child
[48:08] right it's not judgment and wrath like
[48:12] on the sinner like Sodom and Gomorrah
[48:14] that's not all correction our correction
[48:17] is how you correct your child you rebuke
[48:19] them but it's not in love
[48:20] Scot Masada and Gomorrah was done in
[48:23] Wrath it was the wrath of God being
[48:25] poured out and Paul gives us that great
[48:28] consolation we are not of the world
[48:30] praise God will not be condemned with
[48:32] the world hey man hallelujah amen
[48:36] that's beautiful yet we must suffer some
[48:39] level persecution praise the Lord
[48:45] now so this shows Church is beautiful
[48:48] this shows the difference between hod
[48:50] how God deals with believers and how he
[48:53] deals with the world
[48:54] oh praise the Lord as believers we
[48:59] expect God's chastening if God doesn't
[49:02] chasing you he doesn't love you but the
[49:06] Bible said Jesus Chasen's all those that
[49:08] he loves hallelujah and if we submit to
[49:13] the chastening and set our lives in
[49:16] order then we are not going to
[49:18] experience the judgments that come upon
[49:21] the unbelievers or the world in general
[49:26] the very purpose of our chastening is to
[49:30] preserve us from the judgments that come
[49:32] upon unbelievers hallelujah now watch
[49:38] here let's go to Psalms 91 this is a
[49:39] beautiful scripture here Psalms 91 verse
[49:43] seven and eight Psalms 90
[49:55] seven and eight verse seven
[50:10] a Thousand shall fall at thy side and
[50:12] ten thousand at thy right hand but it
[50:15] shall not come nigh thee only with thine
[50:18] eyes shalt thou behold and see the
[50:20] reward of the wicked so here we see how
[50:27] God is promising the believer to get
[50:30] victory over the enemies and then see
[50:32] all the negative punishments that fall
[50:34] on unbelievers right a clear picture of
[50:38] that God is going to make us victors and
[50:41] how we Victor's by our faith praise God
[50:44] what is our victory faith is our victory
[50:46] praise God what weapon stops all the
[50:48] fiery darts faith stops all the fiery
[50:50] darts amen your faith in God our
[50:53] confidence in God the revelation of
[50:55] God's Word that's right
[50:57] I like that praise God so you see this
[51:02] see judgment comes on the rear award of
[51:05] the wicked because the wicked justly
[51:09] deserve it it doesn't come upon the
[51:11] believer glory oh another beautiful
[51:17] example Exodus chapter 7 through 12
[51:20] the first Exodus amen all the judgments
[51:25] that they funded any judgment fall upon
[51:27] Israel no the judgments all ten were
[51:31] kept off of them praise God see God was
[51:35] and that's what the Bible says let's
[51:37] read Exodus 11 7 he bought up their
[51:39] acacia amen because God God kept the
[51:44] people of God they were salt to him
[51:46] praise God they preserved God's witness
[51:49] on the earth they preserve God's life on
[51:52] the earth the testimony so God preserved
[51:55] that salt praise God amen Exodus 11 7
[52:00] but against any of the children of
[52:02] Israel shall not a dog move his tongue
[52:04] against man or beast that ye may know
[52:07] how the Lord doth put a diff
[52:09] friends between Egyptians and Israel
[52:11] okay man hallelujah
[52:13] see judgment did not come upon Israel
[52:16] because the Lord put a difference
[52:18] between the salt and the salt and that
[52:20] when lost its savor right the unbeliever
[52:22] and he said even the dogs have to
[52:25] acknowledge this my great God makes
[52:29] animals testify to this and the
[52:33] difference is true to this day as well I
[52:39] praise God
[52:41] I want to they give it a little
[52:44] illustration here how a I when Joshua
[52:48] let's move that Joshua now a I there's
[52:51] about 12,000 people there when they
[52:53] conquered AI and so if you take AI and
[52:58] then you take Sodom it seems as if Sodom
[53:01] it was greater even than AI so if you
[53:04] take these numbers into account
[53:06] I like this thought here we could say
[53:09] the population of Sodom and Abraham's
[53:11] day was probably not less than ten
[53:13] thousand ten thousand people in Sodom
[53:17] how many got out of there
[53:18] three three out of 10,000 and God
[53:23] assured him I will not that if 10
[53:26] persons were there God would preserve it
[53:28] my goodness 10 10 out of 10 thousand he
[53:34] said there's 10 there I'll not destroy
[53:36] the city but there wasn't so this gives
[53:40] us kind of like a ratio right now this
[53:41] is the remember this is the foolish
[53:44] virgin right one to a thousand it's like
[53:49] one to a thousand God would say I'd
[53:52] spare it for 1,000 but not what his
[53:55] program teaches with Israel two million
[53:57] came out and how many made the Promised
[53:59] Land one-in-a-million right Joshua and
[54:02] Caleb so that shows us the wise version
[54:05] is even a smaller portion than the
[54:07] foolish virgin because she's the
[54:10] faithful remnant praise God right but
[54:15] look God
[54:15] willing to preserve the city if one out
[54:19] of a thousand were righteous and you
[54:21] know Church that's a that's a Bible
[54:23] number go to Ecclesiastes remember this
[54:25] please a c720 I remember this from the
[54:28] study in the scriptures when I preach on
[54:29] Ecclesiastes please ac7 28 oh I'm so
[54:48] glad I can say I'm one of them praise
[54:50] God ha ha
[54:52] amen God's looking she's looking for a
[54:56] very take any small it's like almost any
[54:58] small group as long as there's a group
[55:00] there he'll preserve that City
[55:03] hallelujah look at verse now this is
[55:05] Solomon remember he says verse 28 which
[55:08] yet my soul seeketh but I find not one
[55:10] man among a thousand have I found but a
[55:13] woman among all those have I not found
[55:16] remember Saul Solomon's riding in a
[55:19] Backson and condition here right I mean
[55:20] remember we preach her this and there
[55:22] was numerous things that he said that
[55:24] you could tell he was in a Backson and
[55:26] condition but the point being made that
[55:28] God was willing to save Sodom if one out
[55:31] of a thousand were saved or what was
[55:34] righteous and here we see this idea God
[55:36] what God was looking for one out of a
[55:38] thousand what have a thousand if one
[55:44] person is is righteous out of a thousand
[55:48] while all the others remain below God's
[55:50] standards God's will have mercy on that
[55:52] place because that that's God's witness
[55:56] in the earth amen all right and God
[55:59] won't put his wrath how merciful is God
[56:01] Amen my goodness now let's take its
[56:07] United States you know how many people
[56:08] the United States today 325 million
[56:12] three now my question is do we have 325
[56:15] Holy Ghost filled Saints in America one
[56:17] out of a million do we we got a lot of
[56:21] churches right do we have one out of a
[56:26] million Holy Ghost filled people in
[56:29] America that's a good question isn't it
[56:32] but we must have some type we have to
[56:35] certainly have some type of
[56:36] righteousness left if not God would
[56:38] destroy it right God would destroy
[56:42] because Sodom got so bad they didn't
[56:45] have one out of a thousand and God said
[56:47] I'll destroy it now we're not trying to
[56:56] look at the numbers but we're just kind
[56:57] of looking at God's pattern right we're
[56:58] not trying to guess how many people will
[57:00] go in the rapture we're not trying to do
[57:01] that we're trying to show how merciful
[57:03] God is and how God makes sure he
[57:07] protects the salt of the earth praise
[57:10] God
[57:12] yeah God the Bible establishes the
[57:16] general principle that the presence of
[57:17] righteous believers is the decisive
[57:20] factor in God's dealings with the
[57:23] community now I've talked to numerous
[57:25] friends lately you know they've been to
[57:27] numerous countries around the world and
[57:30] they've told me they suggest the United
[57:31] States is blessed beyond measure they've
[57:34] been all over - all over different
[57:35] nations they said we don't want
[57:37] socialism because that's the big thing
[57:39] right now in the Democratic Party you
[57:40] know they're having socialism they're
[57:42] trying to inject socialism and they've
[57:44] been to many countries and they know
[57:46] that America has the place with the most
[57:49] freedom right right this is the this is
[57:53] the most prosperous place where's the
[57:56] second most
[57:56] maybe Israel I was reading the articles
[57:59] this week out shared with by the Amen
[58:01] Israel's so small but their innovation
[58:06] is one of the best and then in the whole
[58:07] world I think they're top three in the
[58:10] number of technology technological
[58:12] patents for scientific instruments like
[58:15] medical instruments and inventions per
[58:19] capita or per person I think they have
[58:23] like the third or fourth most companies
[58:25] on the Dow Jones stock market they have
[58:28] so many companies that are up there
[58:29] because they're so prosperous now why
[58:31] are their prosperous because God said
[58:33] I'll bless you when you're in that
[58:34] country praise God see God's covenant
[58:37] even that many thousand years back God's
[58:39] covenant will still hold praise God
[58:42] God's faithful God's faithful to his
[58:45] word amen hallelujah and why is America
[58:48] so blessed because there are some people
[58:50] I know it's a small group but there are
[58:52] some people on their knees praying for
[58:54] the righteousness of this nation amen
[58:56] I don't know if it's 325 or not I don't
[58:59] know the more we talk to people and hear
[59:01] about churches and things like that I
[59:03] don't know but we should be some of them
[59:05] praise God and if not shame on us
[59:08] because we have the access to it we have
[59:10] access by the blood of Jesus Christ to
[59:12] the the presence of God and the Holy
[59:15] Spirit we should be drawn closer to God
[59:17] all the time
[59:17] amen hallelujah
[59:25] now here's another
[59:27] here on the same idea of salt preserving
[59:32] go to sagar thien's 520 we get the same
[59:35] idea with another word it's the word
[59:38] ambassadors saying you're Indians 520
[59:50] sin Corinthians 5:20
[59:55] now here's that's read night - that's a
[59:57] good Godhead scripture to it that God
[1:00:02] was in Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:00:06] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:00:10] unto them and hath committed unto us the
[1:00:14] word of reconciliation who is in Christ
[1:00:17] God was in Christ praise God verse 20
[1:00:21] now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[1:00:24] as though God did beseech you by us we
[1:00:27] pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled
[1:00:31] to God now there's a fine balance here
[1:00:35] Church how we are in God's stead but
[1:00:41] then the Pope says he's in the place of
[1:00:43] the Son of God it's very close right
[1:00:49] that's what the Pope
[1:00:51] the Pope is he says I'm in the stead of
[1:00:53] Christ but he's like he's saying I'm the
[1:00:57] only one that's in Christ dead that's
[1:00:59] the difference right there he's saying
[1:01:01] all of all of its in me right I forget
[1:01:08] I'm trying to think of that word now
[1:01:09] with the Latin the care is filleted a
[1:01:13] yeah Epicurus Felidae the vicar
[1:01:16] yeah vicars in the place of right in the
[1:01:17] stead of yeah so there he's saying I'm
[1:01:21] the one who's in the set but the Bible
[1:01:23] says it's not you Pope it's all the
[1:01:25] Bride of Christ amen that's right praise
[1:01:27] God
[1:01:28] all the bride members are ambassadors
[1:01:30] for Jesus amen and what our ambassadors
[1:01:35] you heard us before their person sent
[1:01:37] forth in official capacity by nations
[1:01:40] government to represent that government
[1:01:42] in the territory of another nation their
[1:01:46] authority is not measured by their own
[1:01:48] personal abilities glory but it's in
[1:01:51] direct proportion to the authority of
[1:01:53] the government they represent praise God
[1:01:56] so they don't have really any power
[1:01:58] themselves but they stand there
[1:02:00] representing the authority of their
[1:02:02] government amen and Paul said that's
[1:02:05] what we are we're standing in Christ
[1:02:08] place I'm standing in Christ place
[1:02:09] tonight amen representing his authority
[1:02:13] pray but I don't have any power of my
[1:02:14] own but we are given Authority that's
[1:02:18] right praise God
[1:02:22] so our position on earth is that of
[1:02:24] ambassadors we represent heavens
[1:02:27] government you know I appreciate mother
[1:02:29] Avon carry-ons uh a few years ago is
[1:02:32] just coming to my mind now I've
[1:02:34] forgotten about this but I was preaching
[1:02:36] on the keys of the kingdom and I read a
[1:02:38] scripture where Jesus was talking about
[1:02:41] ex communing be communicating people out
[1:02:43] of the church and Jesus was talking
[1:02:45] about when you excommunicate him he says
[1:02:49] he says whatever you loose on earth does
[1:02:52] he loses on prayer and how all right
[1:02:56] that's okay no problem it was that early
[1:03:00] today's recording or is it an older one
[1:03:04] yeah that's okay par me
[1:03:11] okay bless your little heart
[1:03:14] we haven't we haven't ordained need to
[1:03:16] be the computer worker huh did you pass
[1:03:19] the test yet but the scripture Jesus was
[1:03:25] saying whenever you loose on earth will
[1:03:27] be loosed in heaven whatever you bind on
[1:03:29] earth will be bound in heaven in other
[1:03:30] words if if you take somebody out front
[1:03:32] of the blood they're out from under the
[1:03:34] blood as long as you did it by God's
[1:03:35] leading and I looked down at brother a
[1:03:39] vine I remember him still right there in
[1:03:40] the congregation and I said woe unto
[1:03:42] anybody here that Yvonne has to
[1:03:46] excommunicate out of the church and the
[1:03:48] church s went silent I was like what
[1:03:51] happened I thought I was preaching I
[1:03:52] thought I was preaching on the anointing
[1:03:53] and he told me afterwards he said
[1:03:55] brother Jesse you totally does the Holy
[1:03:57] Spirit discern a situation there's a
[1:03:59] brother there who's been fighting
[1:04:00] against me and everybody the church knew
[1:04:02] it and I was about to excommunicate him
[1:04:05] because he was being sinning and doing
[1:04:07] some evil things in the church and I
[1:04:10] said woe to that person I don't know
[1:04:12] what happened after that I haven't
[1:04:13] talked to him since we just text he
[1:04:14] bought my book and he bought 10 copies
[1:04:16] of my book for his church and we have
[1:04:17] already talked about that but this is
[1:04:20] the thority like God can you imagine God
[1:04:23] gives me and God gives pastors the
[1:04:25] authority to lock people out of heaven
[1:04:27] if they're disobedient now that's enough
[1:04:30] of nothing I want to do I want I want to
[1:04:31] open the door I want people to come into
[1:04:33] heaven but if they won't come God for a
[1:04:36] ride away then God will use a man to
[1:04:38] lock somebody out of the kingdom of
[1:04:39] heaven because they don't want to come
[1:04:41] in and that's why where he calls us
[1:04:44] ambassadors right now here's a good
[1:04:47] thought and this I never knew this
[1:04:50] before but before one government
[1:04:52] declares war on another its usual
[1:04:55] action or of final warning is to
[1:04:58] withdraw its ambassadors I didn't know
[1:05:02] that before you declare war and you
[1:05:05] fight you take out your ambassadors
[1:05:07] because you don't want your masters
[1:05:09] caught in the crossfire
[1:05:15] that mean God's gonna have ambassadors
[1:05:17] on earth until the time of the rapture
[1:05:18] and then right before the rapture he's
[1:05:21] gonna withdraw his ambassadors they
[1:05:23] ain't meant
[1:05:24] Meli that he's gonna resurrect those
[1:05:25] bodies off the earth this whale a man
[1:05:27] he's gonna take their souls and their
[1:05:29] bodies amen that we're laying in the
[1:05:32] dust he's gonna pull them out and he's
[1:05:34] gonna glorify them he's taking off the
[1:05:36] earth before the atomic destruction see
[1:05:42] he's got it so he has ambassadors he has
[1:05:44] salt
[1:05:45] he has preservers amen he has
[1:05:49] preservation he's preserving his name
[1:05:51] and his glory on the earth until he
[1:05:54] declares war and then he withdraws his
[1:05:56] ambassadors who's the salt of the earth
[1:05:59] who's the ambassadors of the earth you
[1:06:01] and I are that's right so when God takes
[1:06:07] heavens ambassadors and they're
[1:06:09] withdrawn there'll be nothing left to
[1:06:11] hold back the full outpouring of divine
[1:06:13] wrath and judgment upon the earth that's
[1:06:16] why during the sixth seal the moon turns
[1:06:18] the blood right the Sun won't shine the
[1:06:21] stars fall and destruction is all over
[1:06:25] the earth and the two prophets are
[1:06:26] calling turning water to blood because
[1:06:29] there's no more ambassadors there's
[1:06:31] nothing here that got that smells good
[1:06:33] to God anymore all right it's like a
[1:06:35] dump right it's like it's a like a
[1:06:37] trashcan there's nothing worth keeping
[1:06:40] it for there's nothing worth preserving
[1:06:42] it but as long as we're here as long as
[1:06:44] our prayers are going up to God as long
[1:06:46] as I worship is going up to God it's a
[1:06:48] sweet smell to God amen hallelujah and
[1:06:51] he will not suffer the righteous to
[1:06:54] suffer with the wicked because he's holy
[1:06:57] praise God
[1:06:58] now the second function of salt so the
[1:07:01] first salt is for the first function is
[1:07:03] to preserve the second is to restrain
[1:07:07] the process of corruption okay in
[1:07:11] relation to food now in relation to food
[1:07:16] so it keeps it keeps corruption from
[1:07:19] setting in okay now
[1:07:25] not abolish the corruption but it held
[1:07:27] it in check for the duration of a
[1:07:29] sailor's voyage so that the sailors
[1:07:32] could continue to eat the meat long
[1:07:34] after otherwise it would have become
[1:07:36] inedible and so our presence on earth is
[1:07:41] the same way we operate like the salt in
[1:07:43] the meat sin is corrupting and we see it
[1:07:48] at work in fact it's like the works at
[1:07:50] worst it's ever been we know for sure
[1:07:52] the sin is the most deceptive it's ever
[1:07:54] been today it is corrupt it is
[1:07:57] corrupting in the religious realm the
[1:07:59] moral the churches the social political
[1:08:02] we can't get rid of it but one thing's
[1:08:05] for sure we can hold it in check we can
[1:08:08] hold it in check that's why I pray for
[1:08:10] abortion to stop I want to hold it in
[1:08:11] check praise God like I said the Supreme
[1:08:17] Court was meeting about that this week
[1:08:18] so we were praying for that we pray for
[1:08:20] it on Wednesday night I was praying for
[1:08:22] it at home that God would pass or allow
[1:08:25] the Supreme Court to rule on the side of
[1:08:27] Louisiana and they'd shut down almost
[1:08:30] almost every abortion clinic in
[1:08:32] Louisiana because the law is if any
[1:08:37] surgery is happening in a place they
[1:08:39] have to their hallways have to be a
[1:08:40] certain width and then they have to the
[1:08:43] doorways have to be a certain width and
[1:08:45] all the abortion clinics they didn't
[1:08:47] follow that law and so they made
[1:08:49] everything roads small narrow so they
[1:08:52] could save money and make more money and
[1:08:54] so now they're trying to they're trying
[1:08:56] to get all the abortion places to follow
[1:08:58] the regular laws for surgeries because
[1:09:00] it's a absolute surgery abortions are
[1:09:03] absolutely death surgery and that would
[1:09:06] be a great thing at that but if they
[1:09:08] change that or if they'd uphold
[1:09:09] Louisiana's law it would shut down
[1:09:11] almost all of them praise God that's
[1:09:15] what I'm praying for praise the Lord
[1:09:16] Amen I'll keep praying for that see sin
[1:09:19] is already at work but we're holding it
[1:09:22] and check praise God so that God's grace
[1:09:24] and mercy be fully worked out why why is
[1:09:27] it holding in check so this message can
[1:09:29] go to every nation amen that's right
[1:09:32] that's we're waiting for now you know
[1:09:37] the Bible says let's go to second
[1:09:38] Thessalonians 2 the Bible says God is
[1:09:40] holding it God is letting it be held and
[1:09:47] the other illustration you probably call
[1:09:49] is a cup of full of iniquity right
[1:09:52] remember the amorite s-- God told
[1:09:54] Abraham you know your children are gonna
[1:09:56] remain in Egypt until the cup of the am
[1:09:58] rights is full and then it'll be poured
[1:10:01] out then your proceed will come back and
[1:10:02] they'll possess the gates of their
[1:10:03] enemies but here's another view of that
[1:10:07] as well
[1:10:08] 2nd Thessalonians 2 speaking of the
[1:10:10] Antichrist in verse 7 for the mystery of
[1:10:14] iniquity doth already work that's the
[1:10:17] spirit of the Antichrist only he who now
[1:10:20] letteth will let until he be taken out
[1:10:24] of the way
[1:10:26] see human wickedness is going to come to
[1:10:29] its climax it's hard to believe that
[1:10:31] isn't it it's hard to believe that this
[1:10:33] could be any more wicked than siling
[1:10:35] Gomorrah but yet it will be it will be
[1:10:39] human wickedness are going to come to
[1:10:42] its climax and it's gonna head up in
[1:10:44] Satan's Superman the Antichrist himself
[1:10:48] because he's gonna claim that he is God
[1:10:51] he's gonna exalt himself above all
[1:10:53] that's called the word and that's the
[1:10:56] very height of evil is for a man to
[1:10:59] claim he's God when he's not and then
[1:11:02] the Bible said he'll deceive them by
[1:11:04] unrighteousness he'll let them live in a
[1:11:06] lawless state where they can sin and
[1:11:08] enjoy whatever they would and still go
[1:11:10] to church Oh God have mercy
[1:11:13] see but God is now letting until he be
[1:11:17] taken out of the way that's speaking of
[1:11:19] the Holy Spirit God's letting it go
[1:11:22] until the Holy Spirit be taken out of
[1:11:25] the way right because the foolish virgin
[1:11:27] are not born again look they don't have
[1:11:30] they don't possess the Holy Spirit only
[1:11:33] the wise version possesses it and then
[1:11:36] when he's taken out of the way when the
[1:11:37] Holy Spirit stakin out of the way then
[1:11:39] the mystery of iniquity is revealed in
[1:11:42] all of his power that's right that's
[1:11:45] verse 7
[1:11:45] he's the
[1:11:47] of sin the man of lawlessness he's also
[1:11:49] called the son of perdition or the
[1:11:51] Antichrist he's also called the Beast
[1:11:55] the Bible calls him a revealing and
[1:11:59] that's one Revelation church I don't
[1:12:01] want to see praise God the Bible said
[1:12:04] when the wicked is revealed
[1:12:05] that's one revelation I don't want to
[1:12:07] see I don't want to be here
[1:12:08] praise God I want to have the revelation
[1:12:12] of the the mystery of godliness Jesus
[1:12:14] amen
[1:12:15] that's the revelation we have amen and
[1:12:19] we don't want to see the wicked be
[1:12:21] revealed according to verse 8 it says
[1:12:23] yeah when that wicked shall be revealed
[1:12:25] we don't want to be here at that
[1:12:28] revelation we want to be gone but the
[1:12:30] Lord promises I'll consume him with the
[1:12:33] spirit of my mouth and shall destroy
[1:12:35] with the brightness of his coming amen
[1:12:38] praise God so see the church at that
[1:12:43] time is gonna fall into a very passive
[1:12:46] attitude towards God they're not going
[1:12:51] to be on fire right because that's why
[1:12:52] Jesus spews them out of their mouth
[1:12:55] because they're no longer his mouthpiece
[1:12:57] they're not speaking its word see how
[1:13:00] important is that we speak all the Word
[1:13:01] of God
[1:13:03] we're either the mouthpiece of God or
[1:13:05] were not if we're lukewarm we can't be
[1:13:08] the mouthpiece of God but if we're on
[1:13:10] fire we become his mouthpiece we become
[1:13:13] the voice of God because the spirit and
[1:13:15] the bride say come
[1:13:16] amen glory so they're very pious they
[1:13:23] look religious but they don't have the
[1:13:26] life of God remember the remember of
[1:13:29] fusions five said they're alienated from
[1:13:31] the life of God they don't have the life
[1:13:33] of God the baptism of the holy ghost so
[1:13:38] see Church you and I our work is to
[1:13:40] resist and restrain the Antichrist
[1:13:43] spirit that is our whole job on earth
[1:13:46] just like salt does salt keeps away
[1:13:48] corruption our prayers are supposed to
[1:13:51] stop abortion amen
[1:13:53] our prayers are supposed to stop
[1:13:55] homosexuality with me
[1:13:57] we're supposed to stop that just like
[1:14:00] salt
[1:14:01] it's corruption from setting an amen
[1:14:03] we're supposed to stop it thank God
[1:14:05] we're supposed to stop it from coming
[1:14:06] into our church hey man we're so stop it
[1:14:10] from coming into our families and our
[1:14:12] church how do we do it by prayer amen
[1:14:15] asking God to move upon the scene asking
[1:14:18] God to cleanse hearts asking God to save
[1:14:21] souls that's our only way to do it it's
[1:14:23] the preach God's Word and pray and ask
[1:14:26] God to preserve our lives preserve our
[1:14:28] families amen because we're kings and
[1:14:32] priests now unto God right now just as
[1:14:38] salt keeps away corruption we must keep
[1:14:40] out the evil but God is holding him
[1:14:45] Chucky's he says Satan you can do this
[1:14:47] but you can't go much further than that
[1:14:49] aren't you glad okay go aren't you glad
[1:14:54] God will let Satan work on you in
[1:14:57] certain ways but it'll say you can't go
[1:14:58] that far stop you working been working
[1:15:01] on sister Naomi this week but you can't
[1:15:02] go much for it you got to stop right
[1:15:04] there you've been even harassed him
[1:15:07] brother Amen all week but stop right
[1:15:08] there Satan I'm holding you back amen oh
[1:15:11] yeah yeah because they're preserving
[1:15:13] their life they're my salt on this earth
[1:15:16] amen they're living righteously he says
[1:15:19] you can only go so far hallelujah he
[1:15:23] holds Satan in check and member Church
[1:15:26] nothing had happened our lives unless
[1:15:28] God allows it heard about Donnie say
[1:15:30] last night said so my house this in the
[1:15:32] live stream last night
[1:15:33] that's true just like Satan you had to
[1:15:36] get permission from God to go do that to
[1:15:38] job
[1:15:39] nothing will happen our life unless God
[1:15:41] knew we could handle it amen and since
[1:15:44] we are salt we know that it won't
[1:15:46] corrupt us whatever happens to us is not
[1:15:48] going to corrupt us but we are supposed
[1:15:50] to preserve and we're supposed to be the
[1:15:52] preserving life of God we're supposed to
[1:15:54] have a testimony in the midst of
[1:15:56] corruption amen glory so in the midst of
[1:16:00] death in the midst of suffering in the
[1:16:01] midst of tragedy
[1:16:02] our lives are supposed to be the the
[1:16:05] purifying agent of all that corruption
[1:16:07] we're supposed to stand there with the
[1:16:09] testimony that Jesus still saves god is
[1:16:12] good God is merciful he's loved
[1:16:14] he's long-suffering he's faithfully men
[1:16:17] were the witnesses of that because we
[1:16:19] are the salt of the earth praise God
[1:16:21] everyone else's life is corrupting into
[1:16:24] more and more sin and more corruption
[1:16:26] but our lives they met our sweet savour
[1:16:28] unto God hallelujah
[1:16:33] see it's the restraining power we have
[1:16:36] through our prayers through the move of
[1:16:40] the Holy Spirit in our life it holds
[1:16:43] back the effects of the Antichrist
[1:16:45] spirit and there's a lot of examples but
[1:16:48] I want to find a place to close that's
[1:16:49] already 5:15
[1:16:54] praise the Lord now Jesus is with us and
[1:17:03] he promised he said John 14 he said I'll
[1:17:06] pray the Father he should give you
[1:17:08] another comfortable comforter that he
[1:17:10] may abide with you forever even the
[1:17:12] Spirit of Truth for he dwells with you
[1:17:14] and shall be in you O glory I want to
[1:17:20] just say that for a moment some people
[1:17:22] wonder and you know we all battled - but
[1:17:25] some people wonder how do you know the
[1:17:26] Holy Spirit's on you you know the Holy
[1:17:28] Spirit's on you when you're obeying the
[1:17:30] truth because he's the Spirit of Truth
[1:17:33] amen
[1:17:34] he didn't say I'm always the I'm the
[1:17:36] spirit of always feeling excited he
[1:17:39] didn't say that
[1:17:40] jesus said he's the spirit of truth when
[1:17:44] you're speaking the truth when you're
[1:17:45] living the truth when you're living
[1:17:46] honest when you're telling the truth
[1:17:48] praise God you know it's the Holy Spirit
[1:17:50] praise God because he is the Spirit of
[1:17:53] Truth he said I'll be with you even
[1:17:57] that's why I can't be tongues can't be
[1:17:58] the evidence right or it can be oil on
[1:18:01] your palm I can't because that's not the
[1:18:02] Spirit of Truth a tongue can lie right a
[1:18:05] people can impersonate that but you
[1:18:07] can't impersonate the real
[1:18:09] honest-to-goodness truth of God's Word
[1:18:11] you can't impersonate that because
[1:18:13] you're either going to obey the word or
[1:18:14] disobey the word the Spirit of Truth
[1:18:16] will direct you to obey the word that's
[1:18:19] right so that's Jesus's presence in our
[1:18:23] lives as salt it's we who have the
[1:18:26] Spirit of Truth and
[1:18:27] he the truth and obey the truth praise
[1:18:30] God that's right I love that that's
[1:18:36] beautiful
[1:18:37] he promises at numerous times in John 16
[1:18:41] and John 14 how he send the Holy Spirit
[1:18:44] praise God and note you know the Bible
[1:18:51] says this in first Corinthians 3:16 know
[1:18:53] ye not that ye are the temple of God and
[1:18:56] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you
[1:18:59] remember we looked at that earlier today
[1:19:01] this morning in Ephesians 3 he said you
[1:19:05] are part of the building you are a part
[1:19:07] of the temple of God you're a part of
[1:19:10] the worship of God and you are the
[1:19:13] habitation of the holy spirit so I am a
[1:19:16] church I'm a part of the church praise
[1:19:18] God you are a part of the church and the
[1:19:22] Holy Spirit must live in you praise God
[1:19:24] amen and God is going to protect this
[1:19:27] earth as long as he's got little
[1:19:29] churches and running around Akron Ohio
[1:19:31] praise God trying to make a living and
[1:19:33] trying to raise their families trying to
[1:19:34] witness and pray for their loved ones
[1:19:36] God's gonna protect this city as long as
[1:19:38] there's believers here praise God
[1:19:41] because they're his representative
[1:19:43] they're his ambassadors
[1:19:45] it's his salt on the earth that's true
[1:19:53] glory now I want to look at the failure
[1:20:00] because met most of the church members
[1:20:03] are gonna fail right we know most of the
[1:20:05] church members are going to fail because
[1:20:06] he said few there be that find it so in
[1:20:09] other words a lot of churches are gonna
[1:20:11] lose their salt their flavor they're not
[1:20:15] gonna they're not gonna bring they're
[1:20:17] not gonna preserve and keep out
[1:20:18] corruption that's why it's so important
[1:20:20] that we preach the right doctrine
[1:20:21] because the wrong doctrine allows that
[1:20:23] corruption is seep into the church and
[1:20:25] the church is on fire anymore for God's
[1:20:27] Word right because corruption is set in
[1:20:31] and now nothing moves them the word
[1:20:32] doesn't move anymore because they're in
[1:20:33] a state of backslidden lukewarmness
[1:20:36] right no longer hungry and thirsting
[1:20:38] after the word they've lost
[1:20:41] they're saver and member Paul said this
[1:20:43] Antichrist only comes when a great
[1:20:46] falling away has happened first they
[1:20:49] fall away from the standard of being
[1:20:53] real salt of the earth being ambassadors
[1:20:55] they fall away it's called that word
[1:20:58] means the apostasy which is a departure
[1:21:01] from the faith oh god help us so Jesus
[1:21:07] says what happens to salt when it's lost
[1:21:09] its savor it's cast out this is cast out
[1:21:14] what out of the house of God and it's
[1:21:18] trodden under foot the son of I'm sorry
[1:21:21] under foot of men so it is good for
[1:21:25] nothing now look at church we ought to
[1:21:28] look at our lives and saying what good
[1:21:29] am i doing for other people because this
[1:21:31] salt does no good for anybody except to
[1:21:33] walk on our lives should be preserving
[1:21:38] helping other people's lives our lives
[1:21:40] should add flavour to people's lives
[1:21:43] praise God by praying for them by
[1:21:46] meeting with them right by encouraging
[1:21:48] them by giving them sermons or giving
[1:21:51] them books or whatever we should be
[1:21:53] adding flavour to people's lives but
[1:21:56] when a church is lost its flavor its
[1:21:59] thrown out of that Church of God and men
[1:22:01] trampled under it underfoot the Bible
[1:22:04] says my almost done here I want to get a
[1:22:10] few more things hallelujah glory go to
[1:22:14] Romans 12 here I want to go back to this
[1:22:15] here you and I know corruption is all
[1:22:24] around us the only way to overcome
[1:22:26] correct or corruption is with good right
[1:22:31] we have to be salt we have to have the
[1:22:34] opposite effect although the world is
[1:22:36] trying to corrupt us right by the Amen
[1:22:38] is trying to give us the wrong attitudes
[1:22:39] the wrong ideas is trying to take us out
[1:22:42] it's trying to corrupt us but we've got
[1:22:44] to overcome correction I'm sorry
[1:22:46] corruption we've got to overcome
[1:22:48] corruption and the Bible says in Romans
[1:22:51] 12:21 be not overcome of evil
[1:22:54] but overcome evil with good keep doing
[1:23:00] good remember the Bible said be zealous
[1:23:02] for good works if everybody else is
[1:23:05] corrupting around you or theirs we know
[1:23:07] churches are being corrupted and they
[1:23:09] won't serve God and they won't pray and
[1:23:10] they won't give alms and they won't fast
[1:23:12] we just have to let them be corrupted
[1:23:14] try to help them out
[1:23:15] but we ourselves must overcome the evil
[1:23:18] effects of corruption with good works
[1:23:20] amen praise God because James said faith
[1:23:24] without works is useless praise God it's
[1:23:28] lost its savor faith without works is
[1:23:31] dead amen and so we have two choices
[1:23:34] either overcome corruption or we get
[1:23:39] corrupted we only have two choices so
[1:23:45] see there's no middle ground right if we
[1:23:50] don't overcome evil evil will overcome
[1:23:53] us that's why I've said it before when
[1:23:56] people are really addicted to things and
[1:23:58] got bad habits that's really evil
[1:24:00] spirits that person is being overcome by
[1:24:03] evil but we have the power to drive that
[1:24:06] out we shouldn't be under bondage to
[1:24:08] corruption we should be over we should
[1:24:10] be breaking the chains amen
[1:24:12] right how are we getting corrupted if we
[1:24:16] are the ones who keep corruption away
[1:24:18] praise God I understand we have you know
[1:24:22] complexes program teaches on that we
[1:24:24] know that but see the difference is we
[1:24:27] have weapons that are mighty we just got
[1:24:30] to get out the weapons and use them
[1:24:31] praise God that's whatever you that's
[1:24:35] what every evangelist and the message
[1:24:36] majors on speak the word speak to her
[1:24:38] speak to her you ever noticed that
[1:24:39] evangelist coming here
[1:24:41] speak the word speak well they trying to
[1:24:42] do get you to use your weapons praise
[1:24:44] God but I just think many times we're
[1:24:46] not always all balanced because it's
[1:24:48] like just speak the word in any
[1:24:49] situation that's not true
[1:24:51] you got to speak the word as you're led
[1:24:53] of the Lord because the same some of the
[1:24:56] same men that I've heard say that have
[1:24:58] situations in their lives and why aren't
[1:25:00] they speaking to that like they have
[1:25:04] situations that are just look awful you
[1:25:07] know different maybe
[1:25:08] loved ones or different things that
[1:25:10] happened why don't they just speak the
[1:25:11] word and fix it because you and I can't
[1:25:13] fix it when we want to it's got to be
[1:25:15] when God wants us to fix it or when God
[1:25:17] wants to fix it rather not us but when
[1:25:19] God fixes it see so we ought to be very
[1:25:23] careful yes
[1:25:24] yeah we're and I've said this before too
[1:25:26] we have to speak the word in every
[1:25:29] temptation right that's where we can
[1:25:32] speak the word in every temptation we
[1:25:34] get the victory but when we have
[1:25:37] problems like let me just give me
[1:25:39] example like with my mom and dad someone
[1:25:41] might say we'll just speak the word and
[1:25:43] they'll be saved well I what if they're
[1:25:45] not ordained to be saved
[1:25:46] then I can speak the word all I want and
[1:25:49] then gonna do and then go do anything
[1:25:51] but one thing I can do is I can make my
[1:25:54] requests known unto God hey Lori like
[1:25:59] what you know they were having when they
[1:26:00] had problems with Judas in the early
[1:26:02] church why did they just speak the word
[1:26:03] and bring Judas into the flock just
[1:26:05] speak the word well you can do that
[1:26:09] because he was preordained to be the son
[1:26:12] of perdition Oh Judas left he sold he
[1:26:16] betrayed the Lord well or wanted you to
[1:26:18] speak the word and bring him back see we
[1:26:19] can't always do it but I appreciate that
[1:26:23] though we need to use the word the word
[1:26:26] is nigh thee even in our mouths right so
[1:26:30] in every temptation used the word we
[1:26:32] have to wait for the right time to say
[1:26:35] it like program with hatty right
[1:26:37] why did another man he knew had he right
[1:26:38] all her life why didn't he tell her the
[1:26:40] other time just think anything you want
[1:26:42] cuz he had to wait for God to do it
[1:26:43] right he just can say well they don't
[1:26:47] speak what every what we can't say that
[1:26:49] we just can't speak whatever we want we
[1:26:53] have to be led by the Holy Spirit to do
[1:26:55] that did I tell you
[1:27:01] I think I might told you I I saw my
[1:27:03] coworker when we prayed for her and I
[1:27:05] spoke the word that she'd have a baby -
[1:27:06] I tell you I saw her a few weeks ago her
[1:27:09] name is Nikki she couldn't have a baby
[1:27:12] we did Bible studies with her and I just
[1:27:15] spoke the word one day in prayer and I
[1:27:18] think the next couple of days she texted
[1:27:20] me and said we're pregnant and they had
[1:27:21] a baby named it Mary while I was getting
[1:27:23] my copies done for my taxes I think and
[1:27:26] I got out of the car is like 7/3 in the
[1:27:28] morning and where I'm up and faring on
[1:27:29] I'm like hey there's Nikki Nikki how you
[1:27:31] doing and God bless you I saw her and
[1:27:33] she's like we just had twins so now they
[1:27:36] got three and she just texts me that
[1:27:39] year before saying I had a dream about
[1:27:40] you that you prayed for me and we got
[1:27:42] pregnant again so when she sent me that
[1:27:45] text I prayed for her just a real quick
[1:27:47] one like five second or 10 second prayer
[1:27:49] she had a dream I prayed for her and
[1:27:51] when I got that text buddy man I was
[1:27:53] really nervous like who because I know I
[1:27:55] can't speak I can't speak the word it's
[1:27:58] got to be God speaking through me now I
[1:28:01] didn't confirm that with her about the
[1:28:03] text but she said she had a dream of me
[1:28:05] praying for her to have more children I
[1:28:06] said a prayer there and the next time I
[1:28:09] see her she has twins now she's got
[1:28:11] three oh god is so good Church he's
[1:28:15] faithful that's encouraging because you
[1:28:19] know it's nothing we can do it's all
[1:28:21] about falling into God's plans we must
[1:28:25] find our purpose from God and do our
[1:28:27] purpose praise God
[1:28:29] so Church how do we overcome corruption
[1:28:32] do good be the salt be salty amen
[1:28:36] but man said be salty salt that's true
[1:28:39] because there's a kind of salt that's
[1:28:41] lost to saltiness when we've lost the
[1:28:45] ability to bring press to preserve
[1:28:48] righteousness then we know we better run
[1:28:50] to God and say God make me salty again
[1:28:52] if we're seing corruption and bad habits
[1:28:55] and and addictions creeping in our lives
[1:28:57] we better run to God say God make me
[1:28:59] salty again restore my salt right that's
[1:29:05] right restore my salt
[1:29:10] now that's about the end of the chapter
[1:29:12] there with but I got a few more thoughts
[1:29:14] I want to share so yeah good I got about
[1:29:15] couple more minutes here yeah couple
[1:29:17] more minutes let me share a few more
[1:29:20] things I want to share from this morning
[1:29:23] I didn't get to just a couple minutes
[1:29:28] here yeah I'm just gonna close to this
[1:29:34] go to first Chronicles 25 this really
[1:29:38] blessed me I was sharing this with by
[1:29:39] the Amen yesterday I was reading I'm
[1:29:40] reading a book called be fruitful
[1:29:41] multiply and it's all about how we need
[1:29:44] to have we have to multiply our children
[1:29:47] of course that's right up my alley
[1:29:49] praise the Lord
[1:29:51] but I think it should be up every
[1:29:52] Christians alley I really believe that
[1:29:55] it's the scripture but anyways that's
[1:29:57] our voice about that and you know why
[1:30:02] you know why it was quickly me yesterday
[1:30:04] just because because God loves life and
[1:30:08] anyone who has life the life of God will
[1:30:10] love God's creation will love God's life
[1:30:13] that's why people limit their families
[1:30:15] and things because they don't have a
[1:30:16] life of God how can you say how can you
[1:30:19] say you have the spiritual life of God
[1:30:21] and then limit God's natural life how
[1:30:27] can how can you say how can you say you
[1:30:31] wanna you want to see the church grow
[1:30:32] with spiritually with numbers but then
[1:30:34] you don't want your natural family to
[1:30:37] grow do you see what I'm saying
[1:30:39] people say they all we want to see all
[1:30:41] the so saved and we want the Great
[1:30:43] Commission me fulfilled we want to see
[1:30:44] Moore's but you don't want to seem
[1:30:46] natural children of God that doesn't
[1:30:51] make any sense
[1:30:52] oh yeah we have the life we want the
[1:30:55] life of God but you don't want more of
[1:30:57] God's images it's just a shame but you
[1:31:02] know what
[1:31:02] it just started in the last hundred
[1:31:04] years the church has taken a nosedive
[1:31:06] I'm talking about the Protestants now of
[1:31:08] course the Catholics there who knows
[1:31:09] what they're so yeah I know there's all
[1:31:12] the conspiracy theories but they never
[1:31:14] believed that to the last hundred years
[1:31:15] and then they got started in
[1:31:17] contraceptives and everything I've been
[1:31:18] reading about that
[1:31:20] now let's read this and remember that in
[1:31:25] Jeremiah one God told Jeremiah before I
[1:31:28] formed you in the belly I knew you and I
[1:31:33] ordained you to do what be a prophet to
[1:31:37] the nation's
[1:31:38] so that means God knows each one of you
[1:31:41] God knew each one of you before you were
[1:31:44] formed in your mother's womb and he had
[1:31:46] a purpose for you praise God amen
[1:31:50] he called you to be salt on this earth
[1:31:54] you have a purpose and that's why that's
[1:31:56] why mothering and that's why fathering
[1:31:59] is so important because you are salt in
[1:32:02] that home right and you have to preserve
[1:32:05] you have to drive away corruptness with
[1:32:08] the salt of your life I say this you got
[1:32:12] to drive out the corruption of your
[1:32:14] children's corruption until they get
[1:32:16] born again that's right you have to
[1:32:20] preserve their life that's why the Bible
[1:32:22] said unbelieving woman I'm sorry
[1:32:25] believing women should remain with her
[1:32:26] unbelieving husband or vice versa
[1:32:28] because her life sanctifies his life
[1:32:31] they met there it is glory because she
[1:32:35] saw if she's a believer she sought to
[1:32:37] him preserving his life she can pray for
[1:32:40] him she can minister him she can be a
[1:32:42] light to him she can witness and by her
[1:32:43] life by her words and vice versa the man
[1:32:46] also was unbelieving wife he preserves
[1:32:49] that life because he's salt so first
[1:32:55] Chronicles 25 1 moreover David in the
[1:32:58] captains of the hosts separated to the
[1:33:00] service of the sons of Asaph and of him
[1:33:02] on and of Jud Thun who should prophesy
[1:33:05] with harps oh look at that they're gonna
[1:33:07] prophesy with harps so you get him a
[1:33:11] harp now this ain't a heart but you get
[1:33:13] him one of these harps you get the heart
[1:33:16] going and pretty soon they're gonna get
[1:33:18] in the Spirit of God and they're gonna
[1:33:20] go to prophesy and aim at the spirit of
[1:33:23] God's gonna come upon them David
[1:33:25] ordained this he said if you want to see
[1:33:28] the Spirit of God move get somebody
[1:33:30] worshiping God amen
[1:33:34] with psalteries with the symbols my
[1:33:37] you're gonna prophesy with symbols we
[1:33:40] got a yeah we got kind of like drums
[1:33:41] right got like percussion and the number
[1:33:46] of the workmen according their service
[1:33:47] was names all their services they go
[1:33:50] down to verse 4 now I'm seeing my family
[1:33:53] I'm seeing myself in this scripture
[1:33:55] about being salt and your purpose here
[1:33:58] verse 4 of Hama and the sons of Haman
[1:34:01] baqia math Inayat uz ow
[1:34:04] GBL Jeremiah Hananiah hen and I le
[1:34:09] thatthe get get LT and Rome am te sir
[1:34:16] Josh Beca ha I'm asking bed to verse 5
[1:34:20] all these were the sons of Hamas him and
[1:34:23] the King seer in the words of God to
[1:34:26] lift up the horn so God says all these
[1:34:32] were sons and what was their purpose to
[1:34:34] lift up the horn and worship God to blow
[1:34:37] the trumpet and announce times of
[1:34:40] worship God gave him on sons and their
[1:34:45] whole purpose was to raise a horn unto
[1:34:48] God and glorify God with the horn Lori
[1:34:53] look and God gave him on 14 sons and
[1:34:56] three daughters why did God give this
[1:35:00] man 14 sons and three daughters verse 6
[1:35:02] tells us all these were under the hands
[1:35:06] of their father for song in the house of
[1:35:10] the Lord with what symbols psalteries
[1:35:14] harps for what for the service of God
[1:35:19] according to the Kings order to Asaph
[1:35:24] Judaism and himand praise God let's
[1:35:28] stand to our feet did you catch that
[1:35:32] David is trying to restore worship and
[1:35:34] he says I need people that will get on
[1:35:38] the harps and the Psalms and the cymbals
[1:35:40] I need someone to worship God and God
[1:35:44] said I gave him on 14 sons and three
[1:35:47] daughters
[1:35:48] for the service of the congregation the
[1:35:53] whole point he gave him 17 children was
[1:35:56] as they could sing songs and worship God
[1:36:00] because brahim and David was a man after
[1:36:02] God's own heart and he wanted God to be
[1:36:06] worshipped in the house of God so God
[1:36:08] said I'll bless him on and I'll give him
[1:36:11] 17 children and they're the ones that
[1:36:14] are going to get on the sultry and the
[1:36:16] harps and the cymbals and they're gonna
[1:36:18] get under the anointing of the Holy
[1:36:20] Ghost amen and they're gonna worship God
[1:36:22] praise the Lord so just as Jeremiah had
[1:36:27] a purpose to be a prophet and God
[1:36:29] ordained him that so did these children
[1:36:31] have a purpose and their whole purpose
[1:36:33] in life was to praise God in the house
[1:36:37] of the Lord what c'mon is gonna stand
[1:36:44] out the day of judgment and Jesus gonna
[1:36:47] ask him what you do with those sons and
[1:36:49] daughters I gave you he's gonna say I
[1:36:51] train him to play the cymbals he said I
[1:36:54] train them to play the harp I train them
[1:36:58] to sing songs in the house of God and
[1:37:00] Jesus either say well done good and
[1:37:01] faithful servant that's why I sent them
[1:37:04] to do service in my house praise God
[1:37:07] just like Jeremiah's gonna say Jeremiah
[1:37:09] were you faithful with the prophet
[1:37:11] ministry I cause you do yes I was people
[1:37:13] come welcome come into the kingdom of
[1:37:15] God prepared for you from the foundation
[1:37:17] of the world other than the church are
[1:37:19] we being the salt of the earth tonight
[1:37:21] we better be praise God musicians if
[1:37:24] you'll come his children were for song
[1:37:31] in the house of Lord for the service of
[1:37:34] the house of God and that is what they
[1:37:38] will be judged by did they live to God's
[1:37:41] purpose or not did they be salt do they
[1:37:46] choose to be salt or did they lose their
[1:37:47] saber
[1:37:50] what about RAM say one person
[1:37:53] out of their place in this church can
[1:37:54] cause people to get sick right one
[1:37:59] person just like the example was from
[1:38:01] the book of Joshua right akin one person
[1:38:05] not fulfilling their purpose in life can
[1:38:08] cause others to to fall right because
[1:38:14] they're not driving out the corruption
[1:38:16] but if we're salt we're to hold back the
[1:38:20] corruption and say God God's gonna
[1:38:23] protect us and nothing will come nigh
[1:38:25] our dwelling place if we fulfill God's
[1:38:30] call for our life so what am I saying
[1:38:35] I'm saying God give me all these
[1:38:36] children for song in the house of the
[1:38:41] Lord I'm talking about you honey
[1:38:44] somebody occasion talking about you when
[1:38:46] you sing girls talk about you in fact I
[1:38:51] was talking about principal a few weeks

[1:38:55] you're almost like Jesus with the 12
[1:38:56] disciples and I said that's what I need
[1:38:58] 12 disciples because really isn't that
[1:39:02] what they are aren't they my disciples
[1:39:05] aren't I supposed to go into all the
[1:39:07] world and preach well that's apostles
[1:39:08] but whoever whoever's around me aren't I
[1:39:11] supposed to preach to them and make
[1:39:12] disciples absolutely
[1:39:16] why'd God give him 17 under 17 there's a
[1:39:19] bride number right there
[1:39:20] praise God hallelujah for song God needs
[1:39:24] someone to worship him by song in his
[1:39:26] house and then all's we have to do is
[1:39:29] fulfill your purpose be the salt
[1:39:32] overcome evil with good how many want to
[1:39:35] be salt tonight how many want to
