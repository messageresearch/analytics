[40:49] good to be here tonight
[40:52] I think we were supposed to be here a
[40:54] month or two ago schedule wouldn't allow
[40:58] it to happen but you know I am so happy
[41:02] I am really thrilled I couldn't remember
[41:05] the verses to that song so that's why I
[41:07] went for the chorus oh you don't have
[41:10] the verses okay that's okay I don't have
[41:12] neither God is good to us I know the
[41:18] master of the wind as we stand let us
[41:22] turn to two passage of Scripture the
[41:24] first passage will be coming from
[41:26] Jeremiah at the 29th chapter and then
[41:30] will come from Proverbs the first
[41:32] chapter I believe that we're living in
[41:36] the last day living in the last days and
[41:49] we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for
[41:52] His grace and His mercy amen mm-hmm
[41:57] we are such bless we're so blessed
[42:00] tonight and and everybody needs to know
[42:03] you know I am this way I don't I'm so
[42:08] glad I'm living in this day and in this
[42:11] age I sometimes think about what God is
[42:16] doing and has done for us and I'm so
[42:19] glad that it's a fixed situation it's
[42:23] about God and me yeah but God chose me
[42:27] how didn't choose him and one thing I
[42:30] know about God promises is that they
[42:34] never fail it may take a time getting
[42:38] here but when the promise is to be made
[42:41] God will do any and everything to make
[42:45] it happen because his word will not and
[42:48] cannot come back boys proverbs 29 11
[42:53] we're gonna read from the eleventh verse
[42:57] to the thirteenth but I know the
[43:00] thoughts that I think toward you says
[43:01] the Lord thoughts of peace
[43:05] not of evil to give you an expected in
[43:10] and I don't know about y'all but I'm
[43:12] have an expectation of a great end
[43:15] because my end is my beginning right
[43:20] right
[43:20] then she'll you call upon me and she
[43:23] shall go and pray unto me and I will
[43:26] Harkins with me unto you and ye shall
[43:30] seek me and find me and when ye shall
[43:33] search for me excuse me let's meet that
[43:37] again and ye shall seek me and find me
[43:40] when ye shall search for me with all
[43:44] your heart then there's two two groups
[43:48] of people here so we're gonna read
[43:50] proverbs by the grace of God the first
[43:52] chapter we're start at the 25th verse
[43:55] there's another group of people that God
[43:57] will not hearken to proverbs 1 25 30
[44:04] through 30 excuse me but ye shall set at
[44:08] nought all my counsel and would none of
[44:13] my reproof I also will laugh at your
[44:16] calamity
[44:17] I will mock when you'll fear cometh when
[44:21] you'll fear cometh as desolation and
[44:24] your destruction cometh as a whirlwind
[44:27] when distress and anguish come upon you
[44:31] then you shall call upon me but I will
[44:35] not answer they shall seek me early but
[44:39] they should not find me for that they
[44:42] hated knowledge and did not choose the
[44:46] fear of the Lord they would none of my
[44:49] counsel they despised all my reproof
[44:54] let us pray father God we come before
[44:58] you and we thank you for your amazing
[45:00] grace we thank you for being so good to
[45:03] us so kind so gentle so loving so caring
[45:07] Lord there's none like you and we exalt
[45:12] you tonight
[45:13] because you has exalted above all names
[45:16] in every name and
[45:18] you'll name every knee shall bow we love
[45:22] you Lord we pray father God that you
[45:25] continue to do the work that you started
[45:28] in us and we'll be careful to give you
[45:30] the praise in Jesus Christ's name we
[45:32] pray amen
[45:33] you may be seated I have a subject
[45:43] tonight and I trust it somehow the Lord
[45:47] will bless you we're living in the last
[45:51] days and it's so hard for people to
[45:54] fully come to understand that even those
[45:57] who we claim to be in the message this
[46:01] is a time that God has been gracious to
[46:04] us we think about the coronavirus of the
[46:08] cold at 19 and even though it has
[46:11] brought distress to a lot of families I
[46:14] can truly say that Scripture works well
[46:18] with me then all things work together
[46:21] for the good of them that love law
[46:24] because during this time God has given
[46:28] me far more spiritually than I had
[46:32] before this coronavirus truck I believe
[46:36] it is a time that though Satan did it
[46:40] the devil did it God took advantage of
[46:43] it I'm saying all of these things so
[46:46] that you can understand that never in
[46:48] the history of mankind the whole world
[46:51] was locked down at the same time except
[46:54] in the time of Egypt and when everything
[46:57] was locked down in in Egypt because of
[47:00] the plagues it was a thing that God had
[47:02] gone on with his people and that thing
[47:06] was that God was giving them that space
[47:09] to make sure that the blood was on the
[47:11] doorposts and the lintel and I believe
[47:14] that this is a time that God has allowed
[47:16] it to his bride to snap her into a
[47:19] awareness that he regardless to the
[47:22] powers of this earth he still is in
[47:27] charge remember Egypt thought they were
[47:30] the greatest of
[47:32] all nations and God took a simple man
[47:35] with a stick in his hand and conquered
[47:39] Egypt and I want to say that I've been
[47:42] to Egypt and they're still suffering
[47:44] from Moses but you see they want to say
[47:48] that Moses never existed but we know
[47:52] that he existed because the Bible tells
[47:54] us he did and even as they tried to put
[47:57] Moses out of their history so has the
[48:01] world they've tried to put Jesus out of
[48:05] their history I want to see this by the
[48:08] grace of God because I want you to
[48:11] understand that before there were or was
[48:16] a written word there was God
[48:19] we call him Elohim and Elohim had
[48:23] thoughts and before the thoughts were
[48:26] ever on page they were in the mind of
[48:29] God they were with God
[48:31] and and so I won't say this because God
[48:36] designed a way to communicate with his
[48:40] creation and he used that way by way of
[48:44] voice now you've never seen anybody's
[48:48] voice but you know that the voice is is
[48:51] something that is spiritual is unseen
[48:54] but yet we have instruments where we can
[48:58] pick it up whether be by science or
[49:01] whether it be by the design of God's
[49:04] what we call ear we we can't talk
[49:10] describe it but it's something about the
[49:13] voice is that when when first heard you
[49:18] never forget it for an example even in
[49:21] the animal kingdom when mother lamb
[49:26] sheep have had a lamb or a cow or I have
[49:32] a calf they know their mother's voice
[49:36] they know the boy said they don't have
[49:38] to go to school to learn it children
[49:41] know their parents voice they don't go
[49:44] to school
[49:45] it's something that God has placed on
[49:47] the inside of that particular child to
[49:50] know the difference they may not be able
[49:52] to discern how far the person is from
[49:55] them but they know mama and they know
[49:57] Danny dan is a revelation as I've said
[49:59] before from Genesis to Revelation
[50:03] whenever God gets ready to direct us he
[50:08] speaks people call him the silent God
[50:11] only because they don't know that God
[50:13] speaks and there are those who can hear
[50:16] his voice that's what Jesus said
[50:18] he said my sheep hear is my voice and a
[50:21] stranger they will not follow I read
[50:25] those two poor portions of scripture to
[50:27] show you where you are you're not in the
[50:30] proverbs 1 but God has placed you in the
[50:35] Jeremiah 29 because God hasn't expected
[50:41] in for us but what is it that God can
[50:46] expect a great thing for us at the end
[50:48] because he knows us as we sing that song
[50:52] he knows my name he knew your name
[50:55] before you knew your name he called you
[50:58] by your name and even though we may not
[51:02] fully understand what that is but just
[51:05] like the problem that God said that name
[51:06] that God gave you before the foundation
[51:09] of the world it's the name that you have
[51:11] when you get over there so even though
[51:15] I'll be known by character my name has
[51:20] always been eternal because my name is
[51:24] his name now you see brotherhood's where
[51:28] you going with this I want to say that
[51:31] you and I must understand that what
[51:34] makes us different from all of the world
[51:36] is because we have the ability to hear
[51:41] God's voice we've come in a time of what
[51:44] we call Pentecostal era where people
[51:47] used to hear God's voice more often they
[51:50] would say you know the Lord told me this
[51:52] and I heard the Lord say this and I was
[51:56] going this way and God told me to turn
[51:57] this way
[51:58] that way whatever they were so attuned
[52:00] to the voice of God but now because we
[52:03] have been so distracted we have been so
[52:08] busy till it becomes difficult to hear
[52:11] his voice have you ever been in a crowd
[52:14] and you're trying to say something and
[52:16] everybody is saying something and you're
[52:18] trying to say something maybe the Judy
[52:20] but Judy can't hear you because so many
[52:22] voices are being being heard and you
[52:26] have to say quiet Judy right so you got
[52:31] to understand that's how God will do us
[52:33] I believe this is the time if you could
[52:39] ever hear God's voice this is the time
[52:42] to hear it because what has he done for
[52:46] you and what has he done for me he has
[52:49] silenced all of the other voices so that
[52:53] his voice can be heard but there is a
[52:58] time that Adam and Eve did not have to
[53:00] compete with voices because there was
[53:03] only one voice and that was the voice of
[53:05] God but when the serpent began to speak
[53:08] now there became a confusion in voices
[53:12] right Adam never was deceived by the
[53:15] voice he knew that the voice would
[53:18] always bring him back to what the word
[53:21] spoke to him from the beginning you
[53:24] understand me
[53:25] so I'm saying all of these things to say
[53:28] by God's grace that God is trying to get
[53:31] us to see who we are right I was telling
[53:35] our brother Jesse this today I said you
[53:38] know we fail to see how beautiful this
[53:41] earth is we look at the trees and all
[53:44] the trees we hear birds singing oh
[53:47] they're just Birds but don't you
[53:49] understand that all of these things are
[53:51] operating by the God that you and I
[53:53] serve and we see them in the birds we
[53:57] see them in the trees we see them in the
[53:58] skies let me bring it down to you let me
[54:01] say it like this hell is void of birds
[54:08] there no birds there there
[54:11] singing in hell there is no blue sky in
[54:14] hell there is no reason in hell there is
[54:18] no breath in him
[54:20] everything that God is hell is bored of
[54:25] there's no beautiful water well you can
[54:29] drink remember when there when there is
[54:32] no ruler daddy went to hell and he won't
[54:35] just a dip a dip of of Lazarus finger
[54:39] there is no water there
[54:41] there is no fellowship because God is
[54:44] fellowship he understand me God created
[54:48] us for fellowship is that right God
[54:51] created Eve for fellowship for Adams
[54:54] showing that God in his nature loves
[54:57] fellowship and that fellowship was with
[54:59] himself somebody help me here because
[55:02] there was nobody equal to God he had
[55:06] cherubims he had seraphim's he had all
[55:08] of these things but there was nobody
[55:10] equal but in the mind of God in the
[55:13] bosom of God you were there dad may have
[55:18] been just a thought but that thought was
[55:21] a perfect thought understand what was
[55:23] just said hear the voice of the
[55:26] scripture God's thought concerning you
[55:30] was perfection he couldn't think nothing
[55:34] else but you see the devil thought by
[55:37] the way of the fall that he could change
[55:39] God's mind about you he could never he
[55:43] saw a Brotherhood's have been wicked
[55:45] I've done this than that than this no
[55:48] you didn't Satan in his illusion in his
[55:54] way of trickery made us do things that
[55:58] were not in the heart for us to do it
[56:00] yah him II he took advantage of us
[56:04] because the seed of God had not yet been
[56:06] quickened see because the seed of God is
[56:10] you it's God in you you understand me
[56:15] it is where you came from and where
[56:17] you're going it's not an illusion or
[56:20] something a figment of your imagination
[56:22] this thing is real
[56:25] hallelujah and God has always tried to
[56:29] get us to see who we are I would ask you
[56:33] the question who are you at some point
[56:37] in time you got to answer that question
[56:40] who are you
[56:42] and the answer to that question is in
[56:45] the scripture and the answer to the
[56:48] scripture is in the spirit of the
[56:51] scripture it's in the voice it is God
[56:55] who identify us by his word hallelujah
[57:01] this is why even in the evening time the
[57:04] problem of God could come and say God
[57:06] has justified you as though you've never
[57:08] sinned in the first place why because in
[57:12] the mind of God you never sinned
[57:15] that's why God placed you in Adam not
[57:19] the second Adam the first and not the
[57:22] first Adam the second Adam you said well
[57:24] how could I get me into places the first
[57:27] Adam was a natural man and in here the
[57:30] probably God said that all of Adam's
[57:32] seed was in him y'all know that's the
[57:34] truth right you plant one seed it comes
[57:37] up it may be an apple tree and out of
[57:39] that out of that that tree comes the
[57:42] fruit of the tree which are plenty of
[57:43] apples and then at all those apples have
[57:46] no apples and but it came out of that
[57:48] one seed so Christ had us in him before
[57:52] the foundation of the world not in the
[57:55] flesh of Jesus he you and I was in love
[58:00] him the life of the seed we were part of
[58:06] his attributes I'm trying to get you
[58:08] sick this is why the Corolla doesn't
[58:10] feel I don't see a crumb I don't feel
[58:13] Kobe
[58:13] whatever it is but give it give it
[58:16] whatever name right I was telling my
[58:19] Saints there in Iowa good question
[58:23] you say you the bride you say that God
[58:26] is your the attributes of Christ let me
[58:29] ask you a question which one you would
[58:31] be more afraid of the fiery furnace the
[58:36] Lions in the den or
[58:39] Koby but everybody was acting like Kovac
[58:45] was the lion in the band the fiery
[58:51] furnace and here were people who did not
[58:56] have the knowledge of God like we do and
[58:58] they said I stand on the word if I
[59:02] perish you let me perish what is it it's
[59:05] something that genetically coded within
[59:07] the state within the sea that's what
[59:10] Paul said I don't live but it's Christ
[59:12] that lives in me hallelujah and there is
[59:16] no fear who are you I'll tell you who I
[59:20] am the voice has spoken to me hallelujah
[59:26] so when this message comes and
[59:28] identifies you that is the voice of God
[59:31] and because you heard it it shows that
[59:35] you are a sheep a another goat it is the
[59:40] goats who don't want construct
[59:43] instructions it is the goats
[59:45] Amen who do not want a reproof it is the
[59:50] goats a men of this world who hates the
[59:54] voice of God hallelujah but the bride of
[59:58] Jesus Christ like jesus said my sheep
[1:00:01] here is my voice and a stranger they
[1:00:04] will not follow he's not talking about
[1:00:07] the natural men's voice he's talking
[1:00:10] about the voice in the voice hallelujah
[1:00:13] he's talking about the God who said let
[1:00:15] there be and it was so that's boys this
[1:00:19] message carries but the voice of God
[1:00:27] that spoke through the man yes hear what
[1:00:32] I'm saying so we are in the book I was
[1:00:37] telling the church I want you to see
[1:00:38] this is just a book of redemption and
[1:00:41] people won't even make it through this I
[1:00:46] have not seen ears have not heard
[1:00:50] what's in store for us this is just a
[1:00:53] portion of God when redemption is over
[1:00:57] can you imagine people say walking the
[1:01:03] streets o go that doesn't excite me
[1:01:07] hallelujah
[1:01:08] the thing that excites me is that our
[1:01:11] being in this present process eternally
[1:01:15] there will be not one ounce of confusion
[1:01:19] of who I am and what I've come to do a
[1:01:27] church denomination or organization we
[1:01:32] are the word born of God and if you're
[1:01:36] born of God you're born of his power all
[1:01:39] of his strength born whatever he is we
[1:01:43] are is that right and the Bible tells us
[1:01:47] that as he is in the world that's what
[1:01:50] we are we are as he is oh come on it's
[1:01:55] more than a mine a process of a mind it
[1:02:01] is more than that it's life because
[1:02:05] first of all you cannot process God if
[1:02:09] he could be processed he's not God
[1:02:11] hallelujah now look at this if God in
[1:02:17] his his wisdom he outsmarted the devil
[1:02:21] again the devil thought he outsmarted
[1:02:26] God in Genesis when he made man to fall
[1:02:30] he thought he outsmarted God so that's
[1:02:32] why Satan still thinks he can defeat God
[1:02:36] cuz he feel like he defeated God by way
[1:02:39] of Adam and it was a reflection of God
[1:02:42] and Adam fell so he figured if he could
[1:02:46] do smart enough he can actually make
[1:02:48] God's fall he can't see watch how he did
[1:02:54] it he always go after God subjects
[1:02:57] everybody he went after he went after
[1:02:59] Moses Jeremiah all of them and he calls
[1:03:03] all of them to fall but
[1:03:04] one day he met his match Christ himself
[1:03:11] hallelujah and he tried to get safely on
[1:03:14] Christ to sin Jesus was sin and as a man
[1:03:17] he went good why he knew his mission he
[1:03:22] knew that he was a Lamb of God he knew
[1:03:25] he had to sacrifice his life he knew
[1:03:27] that they were coming more of him saving
[1:03:38] in understand
[1:03:39] even his angels and satan had understood
[1:03:42] that this scene had to be buried in
[1:03:44] order to Roger scientists the scientists
[1:03:53] didn't know any preach the gospel okay
[1:04:16] but this time he is preaching to
[1:04:19] proverbs 1 yes I won't hear your cry and
[1:04:26] no doubt they screamed and they cried
[1:04:28] but don't you see what we are now this
[1:04:31] is hell that we're living in oh come oh
[1:04:34] it's blending into her this is why you
[1:04:37] see all the wickedness Satan is not
[1:04:40] bringing hell because he's you shoot him
[1:04:43] saying he's renovating he's making this
[1:04:47] place suitable for his coming
[1:04:50] just like Jesus had to go and shootable
[1:04:55] oh my god we were already in a tool
[1:05:07] called a Rossio
[1:05:11] yes we were dead live in labor SIA but
[1:05:18] we heard a voice you will make one the
[1:05:31] car what makes you do what you do you
[1:05:41] you say oh you can't even give up
[1:05:46] [Music]
[1:05:48] because it's not you keeping yourself
[1:05:50] it's God keeping you and he made the
[1:05:54] promise he's that begun a good work in
[1:05:56] you he's faithful
[1:06:05] he has always been that God even leads
[1:06:13] us into troubles he lets you fall he
[1:06:20] lets you fall yeah I was telling pastor
[1:06:23] today I said God is gonna make sure his
[1:06:26] purpose is fulfilled in your life
[1:06:30] somebody help me here you say how can
[1:06:33] God do that did you know that God said
[1:06:37] Tamar who inspired came out to go find
[1:06:41] Judah but God purpose had me fulfilled
[1:06:48] because he brought judgment on the sons
[1:06:51] because they would not go into Tama and
[1:06:53] the only person left was Judah and Judah
[1:06:57] and his sons had the same seed some you
[1:07:02] understand me yes it was just Judah in
[1:07:05] another covering like a different
[1:07:09] coverage y'all know what I'm saying but
[1:07:11] God used a mob to do a brain fog his
[1:07:15] purpose he couldn't see it being brought
[1:07:17] no other way that was his vision if it
[1:07:22] had there
[1:07:24] oh and just something other than what
[1:07:26] God thought in the beginning it would
[1:07:29] have made God a failure God cannot feel
[1:07:33] you know understand me
[1:07:35] your own brother what are you saying
[1:07:37] look God put on Mary they call her the
[1:07:43] love of Jesus but we know we understand
[1:07:46] that God Jesus's mother was L him and
[1:07:53] father was hello him you understand me
[1:07:55] he made the body in what you think
[1:08:00] because she was chosen God was going to
[1:08:02] have some favoritism no whatever God's
[1:08:06] then got then cut out for you is for you
[1:08:08] and some of these people I wouldn't want
[1:08:10] their battles I keep mine know something
[1:08:14] I couldn't do I couldn't honestly I
[1:08:15] couldn't do some of the things that I
[1:08:17] know some people have to do I can't I'm
[1:08:19] not made that way so God knew how to cut
[1:08:21] my my trials and my pattern he he you
[1:08:24] know mean he personalized it for you and
[1:08:26] that's what God does he personalized all
[1:08:28] your battles she could say wait a minute
[1:08:33] no you mean to tell me in my last stage
[1:08:36] of pregnancy I'm bigger than I ever
[1:08:39] gonna be right and you want me to travel
[1:08:41] them Bethlehem oh I can't imagine what
[1:08:48] that would have been like and all you
[1:08:51] know you think she was riding in the
[1:08:53] Cadillac no you understand me the
[1:08:59] uncaught she was uncomfortable carrying
[1:09:04] the Christ child and all along she's
[1:09:07] finding there's a few pains coming and I
[1:09:10] hope I get where I need to go before it
[1:09:13] finishes it but it couldn't it couldn't
[1:09:16] it could not come early and neither
[1:09:18] could have come late mom
[1:09:20] because God had already designed in
[1:09:22] heaven yes the star that was supposed to
[1:09:26] appear at the time of his birth
[1:09:30] not only that God had already designing
[1:09:34] the shepherds to be in the field God had
[1:09:38] already talked to three wise men who
[1:09:41] knows where they were before they
[1:09:43] started the journey the understand me so
[1:09:46] God had to make sure that the inn was
[1:09:49] full because it was in the scripture
[1:09:53] that they would have no room in the end
[1:09:56] God was operating all of this so let me
[1:10:00] say like this God cares nothing about
[1:10:02] your comfort that's right right huh
[1:10:06] he is your comfort he cares about the
[1:10:12] comforter who he himself is you listen
[1:10:17] even Joseph knew that that the child had
[1:10:20] to be born in Bethlehem to whether they
[1:10:25] picked it up on the way I don't know but
[1:10:28] the point is they were already
[1:10:31] scripturally spoken of and they didn't
[1:10:34] know they were the ones to fulfill the
[1:10:36] scripture the understanding that's the
[1:10:39] way it is when God when he speaks for
[1:10:43] example let's give it another jumpin and
[1:10:45] I continue horn Saul we call him Paul
[1:10:49] he had no idea he was an angel he had no
[1:10:54] idea he was a servant of the Lord that
[1:10:55] was going to bring most of the New
[1:10:57] Testament all his life he never knew who
[1:11:04] he was but one day the voice of the
[1:11:10] scripture spoke to him when he asked the
[1:11:16] question who art thou Lord he said Jesus
[1:11:20] hallelujah from that day on Saul or Paul
[1:11:25] was never the same
[1:11:27] see when God speaks to you Yahoo we
[1:11:31] don't know what I'll say like this here
[1:11:33] was Mary Ann danger comes to Mary
[1:11:36] because she's gonna have a child I'm I'm
[1:11:41] just by inspiration but
[1:11:44] I don't know but you see when that angel
[1:11:47] came to her he had to give her something
[1:11:49] just how can this thing be but she did
[1:11:52] not know it was very important for her
[1:11:55] to say be it unto me according to that
[1:11:59] worry she didn't know that there will be
[1:12:02] millions of people called the bride
[1:12:04] resting on her statement be it unto me
[1:12:08] according to your word see it
[1:12:10] distinguish up it defines her it
[1:12:12] literally separated her from e cuz all
[1:12:16] you had to do says Lucifer devil serpent
[1:12:20] I'm not gonna do what you gonna you want
[1:12:22] me to do I'm gonna do it according to
[1:12:24] his word that's all she had to say in
[1:12:27] the conversation she was that's how you
[1:12:47] be done to me of corn you were I may not
[1:12:50] even know how you're gonna do it we have
[1:12:53] not seen it yet have you have you seen
[1:12:56] anybody translated absolutely not but he
[1:13:01] promised and there's something on the
[1:13:05] inside of the bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:13:08] makes her believe Josh that is a
[1:13:14] blessing to you understand I was telling
[1:13:19] the brother today
[1:13:21] what what why should I fear anything now
[1:13:24] I've seen you know I don't even know why
[1:13:27] Israel did it mm-hmm they saw the pillar
[1:13:30] of fire by night pillar cloud by day and
[1:13:33] they still feared that's right they
[1:13:38] still feared you know why because they
[1:13:41] forget so easily people forget how God
[1:13:44] has brought you where he's brought you
[1:13:46] from
[1:13:48] and we know that only the supernatural
[1:13:51] God can bring you from somewhere and
[1:13:53] take you somewhere positive how do you
[1:13:56] is that right that's why God said to
[1:13:59] Moses what's wrong with you some of us
[1:14:09] would say shut up listen to what I'm
[1:14:11] saying
[1:14:12] you know because here you can saw me
[1:14:15] conquer Egypt you've seen the place fall
[1:14:19] you see all of these people that is a
[1:14:22] fruit of your ministry Millions
[1:14:25] and now you're standing up here scared
[1:14:30] that was the difference between him and
[1:14:32] David David meditated on the Lord day
[1:14:35] and night so when he came up to the
[1:14:38] Goliath he wasn't afraid
[1:14:40] he had already a testimony that was
[1:14:43] burning on his heart where you know what
[1:14:57] God has brought you through and you keep
[1:14:59] it on your heart nothing makes you
[1:15:02] afraid that's what David can say well
[1:15:06] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:15:08] shadow of death I'll fear no evil just
[1:15:13] the other day to do you know because
[1:15:18] different women scare relevance if you
[1:15:21] drive you know you might have you gotta
[1:15:22] go near Chicago and go through there
[1:15:25] near Detroit or well and I said uh-uh I
[1:15:29] don't fear no evil
[1:15:31] don't try to put a fear on me I don't
[1:15:34] fear no evil
[1:15:35] you understand me I'm not talking about
[1:15:38] people I'm talking about spirits I don't
[1:15:40] fear no evil
[1:15:41] what because thou art with me God
[1:15:45] understand me when God is in you you
[1:15:47] don't have to fear nothing
[1:15:51] he's a good chef like you testify he's a
[1:15:54] good shepherd and he's Lord overall oh
[1:15:58] let me hurry up Laura God you God got me
[1:16:01] see you're in the book everything in
[1:16:05] here is about you because we're going
[1:16:07] through redemption take you done been so
[1:16:15] lewd and so bad you've been a bad person
[1:16:18] God put somebody in there like judo God
[1:16:26] put somebody on you oh you said I'd come
[1:16:28] out of this church God put Ruth in there
[1:16:34] because she was the more - she was
[1:16:35] half-and-half oh but see God knows
[1:16:44] hallelujah even though Ruth was and they
[1:16:48] sacrifice children over there when she
[1:16:51] heard her husband speak about the
[1:16:53] Jehovah God she knew within herself
[1:16:55] that's who I should be worshiped she
[1:16:58] never had a time to voice it until after
[1:17:01] her husband was dead but when Naomi was
[1:17:04] like I'm leaving
[1:17:05] she says I'm going with you because I
[1:17:08] know that your God is the real God right
[1:17:11] we don't worry about denomination we
[1:17:12] don't fear them organization
[1:17:14] denominations all that kind of stuff we
[1:17:16] know the mark of the beast is coming
[1:17:18] it's already here right it's in the form
[1:17:21] of organizations denominationalism and
[1:17:23] all of that kind of stuff we know that
[1:17:24] the world comes the churches are coming
[1:17:26] together beyond the truth of the matter
[1:17:29] is why do you think that the whole
[1:17:30] situation collapsed it is and one nation
[1:17:36] will not bring this world back on his
[1:17:39] feet so what they're going to have to do
[1:17:41] God is forcing the issue they will have
[1:17:45] to unite to bring the world back into
[1:17:48] its order but it will come just like
[1:17:51] they coming with a new world order
[1:17:53] God is establishing in the world yeah
[1:17:58] he'll be king it will be
[1:18:10] [Applause]
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:20] what are you saying whether you realize
[1:18:23] it or not you are under doors host when
[1:18:27] God comes when Jesus Christ comes again
[1:18:30] riding on his white horse you and I and
[1:18:33] whoever more will be there through hard
[1:18:51] time with 64 years ruling but in that
[1:18:58] day you won't have to worry because you
[1:19:02] have his name if the name of Jesus I
[1:19:07] don't know what the new name is gonna be
[1:19:10] but it's gonna be so glorious
[1:19:13] it'll keep everything in check
[1:19:16] everything in check you love the Lord
[1:19:20] Moses was in the Bible Mary was in the
[1:19:22] Bible Jesus was in about Jeremiah was in
[1:19:25] the Bible Rebecca never listened and
[1:19:27] Rebecca Rebecca Aziz wife yeah help
[1:19:33] Jacob DC because what God told her
[1:19:40] before the babies were born
[1:19:42] you got to in your womb right and
[1:19:45] Rebecca says and seek her God to use you
[1:19:48] even if sometimes it looks sinful it
[1:19:50] looks like you out of the out of place
[1:19:52] you're doing the wrong thing and the
[1:19:54] whole time is when God speaks you can
[1:19:56] never do the wrong thing when God
[1:19:57] instructs you to do something you're
[1:19:59] doing life true you're doing right you
[1:20:07] so what do you mean God is fired Rebecca
[1:20:10] when the father was coming Amen to find
[1:20:13] his
[1:20:13] idols weird to hide it oh my god huh
[1:20:19] because he could not afford to see her
[1:20:22] be killed or captured by her dad she had
[1:20:26] to go with her husband somebody help me
[1:20:30] because I don't have to worry about
[1:20:34] getting in trouble because God had
[1:20:36] already got you out I was just talking
[1:20:47] with a brother some years ago a night in
[1:20:49] 1990 something when they had that stock
[1:20:51] market crash he was led to pull out of
[1:20:53] his and pull his money out and put it
[1:20:55] somewhere else and the person who helped
[1:20:57] him put the money into him that was the
[1:20:58] most stupidest thing he ever done and
[1:21:00] then the stock market crashed and then
[1:21:03] he comes back to the bride collar dive
[1:21:04] well what made you do that
[1:21:06] what me God told you God told me to do
[1:21:09] it
[1:21:10] and because I was obedient there was no
[1:21:12] signs of the stock market crashing but
[1:21:15] because I was obedient I have this now
[1:21:17] now suitum said sometimes things don't
[1:21:20] necessarily have to make sense when the
[1:21:23] voice of the scripture speaks you have
[1:21:27] to obey do what it says now understand
[1:21:32] you got to know God and you got to know
[1:21:33] his words because whatever you tells you
[1:21:37] will come back hallelujah let me hurry
[1:21:43] up amen
[1:21:43] now let me say it like this it's not
[1:21:46] enough to know this Bible you can notice
[1:21:48] by Bible backwards and forth not about
[1:21:51] Nell adopt my dog but you got to be
[1:21:56] quick yeah it has to be quickly acts
[1:22:00] 2:38 was in the Bible 4000 years or so
[1:22:03] always been there right and it laid
[1:22:07] right there people steal baptized father
[1:22:08] son their own it had to be quickened
[1:22:13] hallelujah the gifts of God was already
[1:22:16] in the word the people don't know Susan
[1:22:20] speak didn't just all of a sudden put it
[1:22:22] in the Bible it was already there
[1:22:24] but segment God spoke to some people and
[1:22:29] told them this was a season that's what
[1:22:31] I'm trying to tell you and God speak
[1:22:34] this is the season listen to him that's
[1:22:40] when you call him God and said lord have
[1:22:43] mercy on me give me the fire because
[1:23:03] when there's a deep call there's a deep
[1:23:05] - response is that right he couldn't
[1:23:09] even deliver the children of Israel
[1:23:10] until they cried out from Egypt oh my
[1:23:19] think about it
[1:23:20] listen with the proper God says in
[1:23:22] Hebrews chapter hoping it's okay he's up
[1:23:25] the scriptures no matter how well you
[1:23:27] know them if the Spirit doesn't quicken
[1:23:30] them then the letter killeth the Spirit
[1:23:33] gives life seat
[1:23:34] it must be quickened or made alive by
[1:23:37] the spirit if the Spirit doesn't doesn't
[1:23:40] live in the word and make it a reality
[1:23:43] to you then the letter is just an
[1:23:46] intellectual C doesn't I'm saying
[1:23:47] you've got so many message people they
[1:23:49] can quote brother branham they can quote
[1:23:51] this Bible and nothing's wrong with that
[1:23:53] but when you don't have a revelation
[1:23:55] when you don't understand what he's
[1:23:57] saying or what the Bible is saying you
[1:24:00] just got an intellectual understanding
[1:24:02] because a true revelation will bring the
[1:24:06] stimulation and the stimulation will
[1:24:09] bring about a translation it transforms
[1:24:21] you it changes you it's not just its
[1:24:25] spirit yeah and once you connect with
[1:24:28] the spirit that word changes you for an
[1:24:31] example people don't think they've got
[1:24:33] to go through the statue of a perfect
[1:24:34] man to make a rapture I look at people
[1:24:36] as are you serious
[1:24:38] do you think God put it there just for
[1:24:40] your intellectual understanding no he's
[1:24:43] trying to tell you that the message of
[1:24:45] the hour would take you from all the way
[1:24:49] up if it's a real birth has been
[1:24:56] ordained to mature be it unto me
[1:25:26] we didn't ask any pregnant woman for
[1:25:31] nine months no it's not easy
[1:25:34] hallelujah sometimes the food you take
[1:25:36] down you bring back up
[1:25:39] hallelujah but at the same time you
[1:25:42] still growing something's happening to
[1:25:44] you
[1:25:44] hallelujah because God is in control oh
[1:25:47] I'm so happy to be in this message I'll
[1:25:50] tell you why somebody was calling and
[1:25:53] they call me from South Africa I ask
[1:25:55] well what's happening to America I said
[1:25:57] well the Scriptures being fulfilled
[1:25:58] [Laughter]
[1:26:01] that's what's happening we're in the
[1:26:04] midst of this is that right prophecy is
[1:26:06] not being made and at the same time I
[1:26:16] want you to understand there was chaos

[1:26:45] that the star had appeared you see them
[1:26:49] second it wasn't by their name
[1:26:51] oh please it was about those seeds those
[1:26:56] germs that God had placed in position to
[1:27:02] make his purpose come to pass that even
[1:27:09] he had evil in this position right the
[1:27:14] fellow said hey I'm kidding all the
[1:27:15] children but what was that all about
[1:27:18] cuz Mary and Joseph would have stayed
[1:27:20] there but God needed Jesus in Egypt so

[1:27:31] happening now in America and all the

[1:28:54] which was delight and they knew the
[1:28:57] direction the light came the boys came
[1:28:59] from so they were able to find the door
[1:29:04] oh come on somebody and win that winning
[1:29:06] foolish the girl was still there but the

[1:30:08] wife no you gotta pull me out of here
[1:30:18] you love the Lord can you can I get a
[1:30:21] little bit more let's go to Luke first
[1:30:24] chapter the voice of the scripture he
[1:30:28] said well brother what do you say the
[1:30:29] voice of the scripture because before
[1:30:32] there was anything written Alan he'd
[1:30:34] never had a book to know what God wanted
[1:30:38] they had a voice and the voice visited
[1:30:42] them in the cool of the evening when the
[1:30:45] divorce come back in the cool of the
[1:30:48] Union somehow to help me here so you say
[1:30:52] what do you say Steve everything that
[1:30:54] Adam lost the second Adam came to give
[1:30:57] it back to us he lost the title deed the
[1:31:01] second Adam came to give us the title
[1:31:03] team and what was the title deed but God
[1:31:05] himself
[1:31:06] he was property
[1:31:11] right and when the shoes were open when
[1:31:14] you said God comes back and he gives
[1:31:18] back to the people and places them in
[1:31:21] the Garden of Eden before the fall now
[1:31:24] you got to hear the voice the voice says
[1:31:27] you are in the Garden of Eden not
[1:31:31] lettuce Here I am there to see anymore I
[1:31:33] mean cause Eden Yagami can cause Eden I
[1:31:39] have the power and the ability to rebuke
[1:31:42] every devil that right teases within
[1:31:46] this world but not of the world you is
[1:31:49] the world but not of the world and
[1:31:51] because you are another world with the
[1:31:54] title deed which is a Holy Ghost you can
[1:31:57] bind sickness creation waits to hear
[1:32:01] from you is that right the bomb says the
[1:32:05] whole creation groans see that's why we
[1:32:09] have earthquakes in diverse places we
[1:32:11] got floods why because the serpent and
[1:32:16] creation don't listen to the serpent
[1:32:21] creation has been designed to listen
[1:32:23] only to the sons and daughters of God
[1:32:26] [Laughter]

[1:33:01] three people they call me it not me it
[1:33:04] ain't me is Christ in me is the Lord

[1:35:04] for him I just he just I takes him how
[1:35:08] you doing brother he said I'm 10 times
[1:35:10] better than I ever been

[1:35:16] I can used to speaking the word God can
[1:35:19] use ribbon remedies but whatever and who
[1:35:21] I am he doesn't is still God hallelujah
[1:35:29] people give me like I'm crazy I said you
[1:35:31] know what I only wear this mask when
[1:35:34] they require in a store you're not gonna
[1:35:38] put no fear on me and not only that I
[1:35:40] know it's more than it's your immune
[1:35:43] system builds up when you have to face
[1:35:45] Devils term you need germs being too
[1:35:49] clean ain't too good if we can join the
[1:35:54] system this is all about that's what the
[1:35:57] cold the cold in the flu is a virus but
[1:36:00] it's a cleansing process and we need
[1:36:03] that every now and again take the toxins
[1:36:06] and all that out of it but none of us
[1:36:08] like it but God is working on your favor
[1:36:17] i'ma tell you God is my witness before
[1:36:20] this thing struck God will be up and he
[1:36:23] said I gave this big to repent and they
[1:36:26] would not the next thing I know they
[1:36:29] were saying people were getting sick and
[1:36:30] when I heard about the coronavirus God
[1:36:33] said this is only the first phase now I
[1:36:37] didn't know not no phases and then all
[1:36:40] of a sudden they started saying saying
[1:36:42] it right and you saw what brother's
[1:36:44] wife's name I don't know but he told me
[1:36:47] that this wasn't the only one the only
[1:36:49] thing coming our way
[1:36:50] maybe it was this rioting thing I don't
[1:36:52] know all I know is is not gonna get it
[1:36:55] better those things are coming and what
[1:36:58] you're going to do about it
[1:37:00] shaking your shoes Oh No
[1:37:03] the Bible said that that God has a fire
[1:37:07] about me a wall of fire not just about
[1:37:10] me but that same fire is on the inside
[1:37:20] and that's the way I see it I'm not on
[1:37:24] earth I'm in heaven Jesus explained to
[1:37:31] me how can the Sun man be here on earth
[1:37:34] and in heaven at the same time ya know
[1:37:37] anything about relativity that's what he
[1:37:40] was speaking up scientists taught me
[1:37:42] that you could be in two places at one
[1:37:43] time dimension that the world can't see
[1:38:01] that's I'm living in that dimension
[1:38:03] right because of that dimension I can
[1:38:07] hear his voice I understand me it is a
[1:38:11] dimensional thing that you should be
[1:38:13] able to hear and see God's voice because
[1:38:16] in Christ Jesus that is discernment
[1:38:19] because he is a discerner even the Tama
[1:38:25] reward to praise God so you look at
[1:38:29] those things and you say oh brother
[1:38:30] books are you up maybe maybe I am but
[1:38:35] I'm enjoying it because it's giving me
[1:38:36] such a freedom I'm not worried you know
[1:38:45] we had we had to distance ourselves
[1:38:48] because if they caught us with more than
[1:38:50] ten people they were gonna charge us
[1:38:52] $500 per head and nobody wanted to pay
[1:38:56] the 500 Sommerfeld we went over a few
[1:39:02] days free time maybe 13 14 but you
[1:39:05] should have seen two people either God
[1:39:17] is in control of God is not don't tell
[1:39:20] me that you trust God and you don't even
[1:39:22] believe he's in control how can you
[1:39:24] trust somebody who ain't in control
[1:39:28] hmm see your head is not your tempo
[1:39:32] I'm so glad today cuz I ain't that smart
[1:39:37] it's in your heart that's where the
[1:39:41] temple of God is is in your heart and
[1:39:43] your soul and the Bible says this is
[1:39:45] what gets me it has always let this mind
[1:39:48] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:39:51] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:39:54] not robbery to be equal with God right
[1:39:57] why would you fear being evil with God
[1:40:00] if the voice of the scripture has spoken
[1:40:03] that to you right the voice of the
[1:40:08] Scriptures spoke to disciple assist if
[1:40:11] you say to this mountain be that move
[1:40:14] that's the voice that's the same voice
[1:40:18] according to John one that created
[1:40:20] everything the same Lord is speaking to
[1:40:24] his disciples and saying listen whether
[1:40:26] so ever you say if you could touch it
[1:40:29] agree two of you touch and agree and it
[1:40:33] shall be given you know what we say well
[1:40:38] the devil said we you ain't even been
[1:40:40] living right or you you're not there yet
[1:40:44] hallelujah let me ask you a question
[1:40:47] whether it be a baby or a grown man and
[1:40:51] you're the father and that baby comes up
[1:40:54] and said daddy can I have some milk well
[1:40:58] you say well you can't have no milk you
[1:41:00] ain't wrong yet it makes no sense you
[1:41:05] understand yes because whatever that was
[1:41:08] you are that's what you will ask for as
[1:41:14] you mature your level of expectation
[1:41:17] your level of need you'll never never
[1:41:20] love what grows with you right but when
[1:41:24] you're done you know you myself I got
[1:41:26] this you know I haven't had a real shout
[1:41:28] in a long time
[1:41:33] the show is okay shouting but after a
[1:41:38] while you have but your knees is still
[1:41:49] your knees and your knees have become
[1:41:51] gods needs is that right he said I have
[1:41:55] need to go by Samaria why because the
[1:41:57] Sumerian woman had a need for Christ and
[1:42:00] whenever you haven't he has a need to
[1:42:06] give it to you oh my god if what money
[1:42:17] the mind the word the money of the word
[1:42:20] let it be in you that's the voice can
[1:42:21] you hear the voice tonight give his head
[1:42:23] a voice I'm not talking about me I'm
[1:42:25] gonna talk about this face I'm coming
[1:42:27] what what's what's repeating and and
[1:42:29] screaming out the words you use that's
[1:42:31] life that's God unique coming out for
[1:42:34] you one of the things they would always
[1:42:49] ask these Superstars or whatever they
[1:42:53] call heroes who are you stuck with me
[1:43:01] because I thought well who are you I am
[1:43:06] supposed to be so different that people
[1:43:09] need to ask the question who are you the
[1:43:13] supernatural supposed to be on display
[1:43:15] so much so that people would ask who are
[1:43:19] you is that right yes John who are you
[1:43:23] are you the Messiah
[1:43:26] who are you right they asked Jesus
[1:43:30] because all of the supernatural things
[1:43:32] he was in who are you who gives you your
[1:43:36] authority hallelujah she dusted that's
[1:43:40] the kind of life that God wants us to
[1:43:43] not sitting here waiting for God to do
[1:43:46] something he's already done it the guard
[1:43:49] Club is already here go the other one is
[1:43:52] already here but he's got somebody
[1:43:56] that's not just gonna believe it that's
[1:43:58] gonna receive him I believe often he'll
[1:44:09] die later the devil believes in the nose
[1:44:11] it you gotta be seen it what like he can
[1:44:15] hear talk my kicking heel is that all
[1:44:18] right
[1:44:18] the Bible says according to proverbs 23
[1:44:20] and 7 so far as he thinking for as he
[1:44:24] thinking it as hard so is he that's what
[1:44:27] I'm saying if you think you're a failure
[1:44:28] you'll be a big hallelujah but if you
[1:44:32] know that you're supernaturally charged
[1:44:34] son and daughter of God I look quick
[1:44:40] because I know we got some other nice
[1:44:41] but my point is people you're blessed I
[1:44:44] think if the Lord tarry I mean I may try
[1:44:48] to finish this message that got
[1:44:49] something in this one that I really just
[1:44:51] a blessing to me because you and I need
[1:44:54] to know the voice hear the voice you
[1:44:56] know why I'm saying this is this
[1:44:58] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they did
[1:45:00] not have a Bible but they had the voice
[1:45:08] but the wings that even when they prayed
[1:45:11] all night
[1:45:12] The Voice didn't show up God didn't tell
[1:45:16] him nothing but you see they knew the
[1:45:19] voice and the voices of them and they
[1:45:22] said no matter what if God doesn't
[1:45:25] deliver me I will not bow to you y'all
[1:45:28] better hear me
[1:45:29] we don't know what the squeeze is gonna
[1:45:32] bring on us we don't know but if you
[1:45:35] don't know the voice because you won't
[1:45:36] have a Bible to read you won't have a
[1:45:38] take to listen to is that Ronnie you're
[1:45:42] not gonna have that but if you have not
[1:45:44] exercised your spiritual ears to hearing
[1:45:47] his voice mama knows about it
[1:45:52] mama has that six that's that extra
[1:45:54] sense she can tell she could be laying
[1:45:56] in the bed
[1:45:57] and she have that feeling let me go
[1:45:59] check on the baby y'all know what I'm
[1:46:01] saying
[1:46:02] and just as soon as you go check yes
[1:46:05] something's going on in the baby can
[1:46:06] speak for itself
[1:46:08] you know something about parenting that
[1:46:12] once you know children something happens
[1:46:14] you know you know something's wrong
[1:46:17] I could feel it there are times I have
[1:46:19] to call my children what's going on
[1:46:20] what's up right because something inside
[1:46:23] it is really deep it's really because
[1:46:28] sometimes I can tell when they're doing
[1:46:29] things wrong to his TV is deeper than I
[1:46:36] can explain it right
[1:46:38] therefore I'm closing with the scripture
[1:46:39] 2nd Timothy 2 beginning at the 3rd and
[1:46:43] 70s through the seventh verse thou
[1:46:46] therefore endure hardness as a good
[1:46:49] soldier of Jesus Christ no man that was
[1:46:54] entangled himself with affairs of this
[1:46:57] life that's what I was trying to tell
[1:46:58] people with all these marches and all
[1:47:01] this crazy let me say like this like I
[1:47:05] told her brother in in Africa I said you
[1:47:07] know what I'm like Noah you know I know
[1:47:11] Noah types out the Fuli but I'm saying
[1:47:13] I'm in the ark I'm in Christ nor I'm
[1:47:17] sealed away and what was happening out
[1:47:20] there in those day that was the world
[1:47:22] you understand me
[1:47:24] that's Genesis 6 violence cover the face
[1:47:28] of the word you know everywhere
[1:47:31] imaginations of me everything
[1:47:33] why should I get involved this is not my
[1:47:38] room jesus said it gives us my world as
[1:47:42] my kingdom of my people will fight for
[1:47:44] now you talk about heaven we we bout
[1:47:46] ready to go at it right but you would
[1:47:50] come up this world you say doesn't hurt
[1:47:52] yes it hurt but how many people out here
[1:47:55] have rejected the gospel have blaspheme
[1:47:58] the holy spirit cursed God and His
[1:48:01] Church
[1:48:01] well we're taught my judgment here you
[1:48:05] gonna get in the midst of God's judgment
[1:48:06] and that right oh I remember many times
[1:48:11] you know mama whippin brother you tryin
[1:48:13] to get anyway guess what happens you get
[1:48:15] a leak or two and you jump jump out the
[1:48:17] window you're on your own you know is
[1:48:22] what we do sometimes when we bring
[1:48:23] businesses to church the pastor stopped
[1:48:25] preaching hard and we put our protective
[1:48:27] shield over it on her Lord you don't see
[1:48:31] it but you know it's going on windy when
[1:48:46] she came with brother Simon oh my I
[1:48:50] didn't see windy so I was preaching a
[1:48:52] church message I mean I was rebuking
[1:48:55] left and right I mean the soil was Cutta
[1:48:58] Cutta going in for eight and you know I
[1:49:00] was talking about the worldly thing this
[1:49:02] is bad this and that never saw her
[1:49:05] sitting there I know she was so sharp
[1:49:18] that's what I knew something she has
[1:49:20] something
[1:49:21] yeah the devil might fight your sister
[1:49:23] but there is some because there ain't no
[1:49:25] way a worldly girl would have come back
[1:49:27] under those conditions we she stood up
[1:49:36] like Oh Holy Spirit so when it comes to
[1:49:42] the to see to God they don't care how
[1:49:44] hard it comes
[1:49:45] they might get mad at you but at the end
[1:49:48] of the day they gonna say amen amen
[1:49:52] all right no man that wasn't to him
[1:49:55] she's been a testimony because I testify
[1:49:58] like now I have no idea what that did
[1:50:01] for me that day right no man that was
[1:50:04] entangled himself with the affairs of
[1:50:06] this life that he may please him who
[1:50:11] have chosen him to be a soldier we don't
[1:50:15] we don't entangle ourselves with
[1:50:17] politics and all of the stuff that's
[1:50:18] going on that's not our fair our fair is
[1:50:22] the kingdom of God and
[1:50:24] as righteousness amen and if a man also
[1:50:28] strived for mastery yet it he not
[1:50:32] crowned except he strives or lawfully
[1:50:36] the husbandmen that labor earth must be
[1:50:38] first partakers of the fruit and this is
[1:50:41] what I've been telling my church I said
[1:50:44] I'm crying out for something I want more
[1:50:46] of it you know I don't have a slice or
[1:50:48] two of the pie I want more of it or the
[1:50:51] watermelon I want more of it why because
[1:50:54] these things must begin with me first
[1:50:57] customers must first be partakers of the
[1:50:59] food people must see Christ in me which
[1:51:03] they see it don't get me wrong but I
[1:51:05] mean a grain of Christ if that makes
[1:51:07] sense
[1:51:07] a greater Christ you love the Lord
[1:51:10] hallelujah I I so long in closing that's
[1:51:16] why we needed a prophet because proverbs
[1:51:19] 29:18 says where there is no vision the
[1:51:22] people perish but he that keepeth the
[1:51:26] law happy is he so you got to understand
[1:51:30] that's the way God did it and he
[1:51:33] preached a message there's a man who
[1:51:35] could turn on the light yeah right and
[1:51:37] that's what the message came to do was
[1:51:40] to reveal to us the very thought of God
[1:51:43] for us in an hour day that's the turning
[1:51:47] on the light that is what quickens you
[1:51:49] to know who you are
[1:51:50] because the the serpent cannot receive
[1:51:53] this message now you mean yeah they
[1:51:55] don't have nothing to do with it but a
[1:51:57] true believer though they may be weakest
[1:52:00] water like Ruben they still part of the
[1:52:04] family you love the Lord see if I could
[1:52:08] if I could sin in a nutshell on
[1:52:11] everything that I wanted you to see to
[1:52:13] give you grace and conference it would
[1:52:15] be he became my sin that I might become
[1:52:19] the righteousness it ain't your laws and
[1:52:24] ain't your rules an angel dialogues it
[1:52:27] ain't none of that there are many people
[1:52:29] like the rich young ruler head doc got
[1:52:32] to cross the t's and dot the i's and put
[1:52:35] a period at the end however he did all
[1:52:37] right
[1:52:38] but was lost right he was a man who's a
[1:52:41] tax collector he approached God back
[1:52:45] grace hey God said hey I'm coming to
[1:52:47] your house Zacchaeus see I'd rather be
[1:52:52] like Zacchaeus than the rich young ruler
[1:52:55] say well okay all right you know I got
[1:52:58] my religion mmm
[1:52:59] I ain't never done this I ain't never
[1:53:01] done that I ain't never done this that
[1:53:03] or the other and I'm all right boom you
[1:53:07] must be born again and I say that you
[1:53:11] know a lot of kids come up in the
[1:53:12] message want you to understand it may be
[1:53:14] difficult for you to see yourself as a
[1:53:16] wretch but you are rich you are you were
[1:53:20] born a wretch give time give you more
[1:53:23] time that might become manifested but
[1:53:26] you don't know time to catch up the
[1:53:28] Bible said the day that you hear my
[1:53:30] voice harden not your heart and I want
[1:53:33] to encourage all the young people those
[1:53:34] of you who are pressing into the Holy
[1:53:36] Ghost don't give up don't get slack you
[1:53:40] know what I'm saying this is not an hour
[1:53:41] to lay low this is a time to raise up
[1:53:44] and say God you said and I've been
[1:53:48] baptized in your name and you promised
[1:53:50] me and I'm holding to your promise
[1:53:52] that's how you approach God as God I
[1:53:55] know I can't my righteousness is like
[1:53:57] filthy rags how am I gonna make heaven
[1:53:58] if you don't give me the Holy Ghost and
[1:54:00] how am I going to live right if you
[1:54:03] don't give me the Holy Ghost
[1:54:04] I can't transform myself but I'm told by
[1:54:08] your spirit your spirit your Holy Ghost
[1:54:11] is to transform way you have to approach
[1:54:14] God with his word that's right and you
[1:54:17] go with bonus the Bible says you don't
[1:54:18] go where Lord if you want to no not if
[1:54:21] you want to cuz you told me according to
[1:54:24] your property you said God want to give
[1:54:25] me the Holy Ghost more than I wanted now
[1:54:28] I want you to give me your inspiration
[1:54:30] Lord give me the give you you want to
[1:54:35] give it give it to me so I can want to
[1:54:37] have it just like you want to give it to
[1:54:39] me and I'll make you said yeah that's
[1:54:42] what you do that's what you do you love
[1:54:45] the Lord I hope this has been a blessing
[1:54:47] to you yes sir yes
[1:54:49] I appreciate your pool you know
[1:54:52] I could feel it hey you know it I love
[1:54:55] screams and hollers and all but I can
[1:54:57] feel the pool because sometimes you can
[1:54:58] get the screams in Holland you just got
[1:55:00] religion going on but when you get a
[1:55:02] person who people that somehow they know
[1:55:04] how to do it they just ain't opening up
[1:55:07] their mouth right is that right it's
[1:55:09] coming like a baby nursing they know how

[1:55:45] to love me
