[4:07] all these blessings in Jesus Christ's
[4:08] name Saints said amen amen God bless you
[4:11] as you're being seated praise
[4:23] God so we look at uh chapter 15 here I
[4:26] plan to get through all of chapter 15
[4:28] tonight uh possible by God's grace um
[4:31] remember on Scofield's outline we are on
[4:34] the sixth part which is the Christian
[4:36] Life and service we've gone through part
[4:39] one the whole uh world is guilty before
[4:42] God uh the second part is we're
[4:44] justified by faith as the solution for
[4:47] our
[4:48] guilt uh and the third part was the
[4:51] Believers walk in the Holy
[4:53] Spirit uh the fourth part was the final
[4:55] result of the Gospel blessing in Romans
[4:57] 8 then we looked at Christian promises
[5:00] to Israel chapters 9- 11 and now we've
[5:03] been looking at Christian Life and
[5:04] Service uh chapters 12-1 15 chapter 16
[5:08] is the outflow of Christian love and
[5:10] Paul's goodbyes uh that he writes it's
[5:13] it's amazing all these names that he
[5:15] names you know uh certain people that he
[5:18] would name think about that you know
[5:20] you're uh you if you were privileged to
[5:22] know Paul your name might get in that
[5:23] letter your name was in the Bible for
[5:25] all time what a what a blessing but even
[5:28] greater than that our names the Lamb's
[5:30] Book of Life Hallelujah written before
[5:32] the foundation of the world the Bible
[5:33] said chosen in Christ Hallelujah so
[5:36] verse uh yeah now chapter five I'm sorry
[5:39] chapter 15 covers two or three I'm sorry
[5:41] three topics Christ's example of
[5:44] service so we're looking at Christ's
[5:46] example hope for Jews and Gentiles
[5:49] because remember Paul was speaking to a
[5:51] church that was both Jew and Gentile
[5:53] they started out Jewish but then the
[5:55] Jews got kicked out they had some
[5:57] Gentiles but then the Gentiles
[5:58] multiplied while the Jews were gone cuz
[6:00] the Jews were kicked out of Rome but
[6:02] then the Jews came back yeah now you had
[6:04] like a clash between two different
[6:07] cultures right uh a gentile culture and
[6:10] a Jewish culture Paul had to bring the
[6:12] balance to everything aren't you glad he
[6:14] did amen it's such a blessing it helps
[6:17] us so much I was reading you know uh
[6:19] this is I'm sorry in my morning
[6:22] devotions and reading the Bible I've
[6:24] been copying my notes from Romans from
[6:26] my old Bible to my new Bible and I was
[6:28] just again blessed by all these
[6:30] beautiful uh scriptures in Romans
[6:33] remember brother said every time I go to
[6:35] F on the little blue I turn to Romans
[6:37] chapter 4 so if anybody gets depressed
[6:40] or defeated this week go to Romans 4
[6:42] Hallelujah it'll bless you
[6:44] Hallelujah remember uh chapter 3 though
[6:47] the remember the blessedness that David
[6:49] describes blessed is the man to whom the
[6:52] Lord will not impute
[6:54] sin you know we we think oh maybe I'm
[6:56] not blessed or things haven't I I
[6:58] haven't been getting many bless lately
[7:00] well think about your Eternal blessings
[7:01] for a little bit Hallelujah that'll make
[7:03] you feel so happy it'll make you lay
[7:06] those burdens down
[7:07] hallelujah amen I was just blessed this
[7:09] week I'm like wow I have so much to be
[7:10] thankful for and when this happens this
[7:12] don't bother me at all you know like
[7:13] like I said we have these are these are
[7:15] minor things uh compared to things
[7:17] people go through these are very small
[7:19] in
[7:20] comparison I do wonder why happened six
[7:23] years later I do wonder that brother
[7:24] amen I do Wonder uh what I mean is maybe
[7:28] the plumber didn't do a good job the
[7:30] last time if he's a good plumber like
[7:32] Simon is a good plumber yeah that
[7:34] plumbing should last a long time but
[7:35] anyway Hallelujah God bless him
[7:38] amen so uh we look at those three
[7:41] Christ's example hope for Jew and
[7:42] Gentiles and the third part is Paul's
[7:45] Ministry and remember this is a quote I
[7:47] I uh I wanted to put up here I mean I
[7:49] had all these plans for that I was going
[7:50] to show all the slides and all the
[7:52] quotes because I had all this time to
[7:53] study and now I don't get to do it
[7:54] tonight so but I was going to show that
[7:56] quote brother said nothing else will pep
[7:58] up the church except the preaching of
[8:00] the word okay and he was talking about
[8:03] how uh he was talking about how he would
[8:05] see calves in the springtime they would
[8:08] go out and run into the fields and eat
[8:10] all the fresh plants and they and I've
[8:12] seen them too a few weeks ago I was
[8:13] seing them they they would run and they
[8:15] would like kick their heels you know
[8:17] they would jump up and kick their heels
[8:18] and uh they got all that energy brother
[8:21] said because they got all those vitamins
[8:22] that they
[8:23] eat and brother said that puts me that
[8:26] picture of calves jumping and eating he
[8:29] said that puts me in mind of some of
[8:30] these little old
[8:31] churches they got these big tall
[8:33] aspiring places you know with a $1,000
[8:36] pipe organs on today be million dooll
[8:38] pip or
[8:40] yeah and plush seats and everything he
[8:43] said but they don't have nothing to eat
[8:46] right he said but you getting some old
[8:48] missions somewhere you know you might
[8:50] find a whole lot in there you know some
[8:52] spiritual
[8:53] vitamins he says God has got them there
[8:56] for you to help your spirit up to pep
[8:58] you up a little
[9:00] that's the preaching of the Gospel all
[9:02] those plants that calf would eat and
[9:04] make him jump that's what the preaching
[9:05] does to us
[9:07] amen he said if that won't pep up the
[9:09] church there's nothing that will because
[9:11] faith comes by hearing hearing by the
[9:14] word of God course that's Romans 10
[9:16] other words I like wow that's Romans 10
[9:18] like Romans right we keep getting Romans
[9:19] Romans all the time Hallelujah so we're
[9:22] thankful by God's grace now now chapter
[9:25] 15 verse1 now we'll get into the the
[9:27] teaching on these uh on these vers vers
[9:29] verse one we then that are strong ought
[9:31] to Bear the infirmity that means to lift
[9:34] to Bear to Bear means to
[9:36] lift so usually younger Christians or so
[9:39] forth uh they're not as strong to be
[9:42] able to Bear different subjects right or
[9:45] different doctrines and so forth but
[9:47] Paul says we ought to bear or lift the
[9:49] infirmities of the weak and not to
[9:51] please ourselves remember in context
[9:53] this is not talking about physical bit
[9:55] uh physical bearing right this is
[9:58] talking about spiritual bury yes
[10:01] spiritual Doctrine so remember in the
[10:03] previous chapter remember chapter 14 we
[10:05] listed these uh four things meat eating
[10:08] versus vegetarians right that's a burden
[10:11] you might have to carry right now not
[10:14] really in America right because most of
[10:15] us eat meat and and and vegetables right
[10:19] that doesn't really offend us but it
[10:21] offended the Roman Church right you had
[10:23] Jews probably that ate Less meat right
[10:25] Gentiles they probably ate anything
[10:28] that's just how they were raised the
[10:29] second church was holy days now that
[10:31] does impact us a little bit especially
[10:32] with Christmas and Easter right and
[10:35] Thanksgiving and some of these other
[10:36] other days that uh do impact us a little
[10:39] bit so if someone's weaker and they
[10:42] can't handle the fact that you maybe
[10:43] observe this day or don't OB observe
[10:45] this day that we ought to Bear the load
[10:48] that they
[10:49] carry and that means not please
[10:53] ourselves okay so if someone came up
[10:57] like let's say and said brother Jesse
[10:58] you know uh it offends me that you give
[11:01] your children presents on Christmas well
[11:03] then I guess what I would do I would
[11:06] just not mention it over the pulpit I
[11:09] would try and I try not to mention I I
[11:11] probably wouldn't sing any Christmas
[11:12] songs I'd say Amen don't sing Oh come
[11:14] let us adore
[11:15] here right that that's what it would
[11:18] look like for us if a person's so weak
[11:22] that they can't handle you know
[11:24] somebody's Liberty then Paul says be
[11:26] like Christ amen right bear their burden
[11:30] don't please yourself please the other
[11:32] person amen remember Church don't forget
[11:35] now this is important this is a book of
[11:36] Acts
[11:38] Church Hallelujah this is a book of Acts
[11:40] church this is Things book of Acts
[11:43] churches deal with
[11:44] Hallelujah like I told that to cam
[11:46] recently when I was when I preached out
[11:48] there in April I was telling him you
[11:50] know the book of Acts Church in in
[11:52] Corinth they struggle with suing each
[11:53] other right they struggle with uh uh
[11:57] fornication they struggle with false
[11:59] teachers they brought a lot of false
[12:01] teachers and Paul had to say listen I've
[12:03] got the resume I'm a real I'm a real
[12:05] Apostle he says you brought in the wrong
[12:07] preachers it's hurt you you know that's
[12:09] what the book of Acts Church struggles
[12:11] with right yeah third wine now I heard A
[12:14] good sermon on wine recently by brother
[12:16] Donnie Reagan and he I don't know if
[12:17] this is true but if it is it's it's
[12:19] really something it would change
[12:20] everything but he said there wine
[12:22] there's two kinds of wine in the Bible
[12:23] of course there's the grape juice and
[12:25] then there's the uh fermented wine right
[12:27] which would has content so brother
[12:30] Donnie I don't know if you ever heard
[12:31] this brother uh William he said brother
[12:33] Donnie said uh when Jesus multiplied the
[12:36] wine at Kana it was the grape
[12:38] juice now that would make more
[12:41] sense right because you have a wedding
[12:43] for seven days imagine feeding anyone
[12:46] for seven like a your whole guests for
[12:48] seven days right and we know God would
[12:51] never purposely get somebody drunk right
[12:54] that's an Abomination we preach through
[12:56] that drunkenness an Abomination so
[12:59] that's that would really change things
[13:00] right but then if you know if the Bible
[13:03] Paul told Timothy drink a little wine
[13:04] for your stomach sake no he notice he
[13:06] said a
[13:07] little just a little bit not a
[13:10] lot so uh now for us as I as I've always
[13:14] taught it you know I I just always
[13:16] thought you know the wine in the Bible
[13:18] had a little fermentation I didn't think
[13:20] it was grape juice and so what what I've
[13:22] said is that's why I'll never drink wine
[13:25] or alcohol out in public because I don't
[13:27] want to cause anybody to stumble
[13:29] I've never or I'm sorry I met a few
[13:31] people yes I met a few people in cows
[13:32] before I came to
[13:33] message and these we were all 21 we're
[13:36] all 22 you know we're all 20 years old
[13:39] and the preachers in our mega church
[13:41] down the road in aaran I've named it
[13:43] many times the preachers would drink
[13:45] alcohol and it caused some of these guys
[13:48] that were my age to get drunk and say
[13:51] well he did it so I can
[13:53] too brother even I wasn't the message
[13:55] brother William but I knew something was
[13:56] wrong with that in here cuz I had a
[13:58] preing predestinated spiritual seed
[14:00] inside of me Hallelujah I just knew that
[14:02] was wrong nobody could tell me any
[14:04] different so I never did what they did
[14:06] you know like
[14:08] that but uh you know that's uh that
[14:12] that's part of a Christian you never you
[14:14] give up your rights in order to please
[14:17] other people so you don't cause them to
[14:18] be weak or
[14:20] stumble it just shows Church you know
[14:22] there's always going to be stronger ones
[14:23] and weaker ones and we that are strong
[14:26] the Bible says we ought to which means
[14:28] we will we should
[14:29] yes it's your
[14:31] duty to lift somebody else's burden and
[14:34] strengthen them rather than discourage
[14:37] them or cause them to doubt your your
[14:39] your
[14:41] Christianity Hallelujah the next one the
[14:43] last one was eating meat sacrifice to
[14:45] Idols now that like I said that impacted
[14:47] Wendy one time uh it's never impacted us
[14:50] right we never uh I'm not sure how it
[14:54] impact us CU when Wendy talked about in
[14:56] Hong Kong they would actually have Idol
[14:58] set up like
[14:59] like demonic idols and they would U they
[15:02] would buy meat and then they would cook
[15:04] the meat and then they lay the meat
[15:05] before the idol and then they would pass
[15:07] it out the party so they would dedicate
[15:09] that meat and so I don't I don't think
[15:11] she was ever part of it but she saw it
[15:13] well in that's the case right then a
[15:15] Christian wouldn't eat that meat right
[15:18] because a younger Christian might look
[15:19] and say oh that was dedicated to Idols
[15:22] why are you eating that you're partaking
[15:23] with Devils what a real Christian knows
[15:25] is just meat that's
[15:27] right now a real Christian might rebuke
[15:30] that that Idol right there I rebuke you
[15:32] Satan you know you wouldn't have to
[15:34] really cuz you're you're on a higher
[15:36] plane than that as a Christian you're
[15:38] not afraid of demons you've got God on
[15:41] the inside greater is he that's in me
[15:43] than he that's in the world hallelujah
[15:46] amen right nobody can curse you I'm
[15:48] we're blessed amen you can't curse what
[15:51] God is blessed Hallelujah so we're not
[15:53] afraid of those things but you wouldn't
[15:55] want to just take it halfhazard and call
[15:58] somebody to stumble right and so
[16:01] remember the way you the way you uh bear
[16:04] the infirmities of the week is uh
[16:07] chapter 14:22 it says keep it between
[16:10] you and God alone so the lesson is if
[16:13] someone's going to stumble over
[16:14] something you do it by yourself with
[16:16] your family at home if there's any
[16:18] question just do it at home between you
[16:20] and God that's the way to be like Christ
[16:23] Hallelujah now verse two let every one
[16:25] of us please his neighbor for his good
[16:28] to edification edification means
[16:30] building up promote somebody's growth
[16:32] how can I help this person grow as a
[16:34] Christian amen the way you do that is
[16:37] you don't offend them yes right by the
[16:40] things that you allow
[16:43] right and then verse three for even
[16:45] Christ pleases not himself so all this
[16:47] goes back to Christ all of our
[16:49] interactions with the church members
[16:51] everybody in the church all of our
[16:53] interactions should be based upon
[16:55] Christ I should act like Christ around
[16:58] you you should act like Christ around me
[17:00] amen but Christ didn't please
[17:03] himself as it is written because Christ
[17:05] fulfilled the scripture it's from Psalm
[17:07] 69:9 the reproaches of them that
[17:10] reproach thee fell on
[17:12] me right so we're Christlike when we
[17:15] please others instead of ourselves and
[17:18] this means we should take reproach or
[17:20] criticism on us right can someone might
[17:23] criticize me for doing Christmas I don't
[17:25] do Santa Claus just the live streamers I
[17:27] don't do Santa Claus
[17:29] I don't do a Christmas tree but I don't
[17:30] think there's anything wrong with a tree
[17:31] as long as you don't worship the
[17:33] tree um but if someone got offended that
[17:36] I gave my kids presence then I uh in one
[17:40] way they'd be criticizing me right and
[17:42] hopefully they do it with a good
[17:44] spirit right hopefully they do it with
[17:46] kindness
[17:48] amen but even if not my Christian duty
[17:52] is to help them grow amen and if it's
[17:55] area if there's an area of question it's
[17:57] a area of Liberty or area question then
[17:59] I just give up my rights and I'll make
[18:01] them stronger right
[18:04] right now uh John Gil says what what how
[18:08] did Jesus fulfill Psalm 699 it says the
[18:11] Zeal of thine house that eat me up
[18:13] remember when he clean out the temple
[18:14] Jesus likes a clean church amen and the
[18:17] reproaches of them that reproach thee
[18:19] are Fallen upon me I like what John Gil
[18:21] says they they criticized Jesus they
[18:23] called him a glutton and a wine Biber
[18:25] but he wasn't right they called him a
[18:27] friend of publicans and siners he was
[18:30] Hallelujah they said he was a Samaritan
[18:33] and he had a devil he
[18:35] didn't they charged him with blasphemy
[18:37] and Sedition he didn't right when he was
[18:40] on the cross they mocked him reviled him
[18:42] they wagged their heads at him they
[18:43] ripped out his beard they spit in his
[18:45] face but he bore all of it patiently and
[18:48] look he reviled not again
[18:51] amen so let's applied to us if someone
[18:54] doesn't like how we do Christmas or if
[18:55] someone doesn't like then the thing to
[18:57] do is make sure we don't say anything
[18:59] negative to
[19:00] them Hallelujah that's a strong
[19:02] Christian how many can say Amen to that
[19:05] you don't say anything you just say Okay
[19:07] praise the Lord I'll bear your infirmity
[19:10] I'll bear your weakness and I'll help
[19:12] you be stronger hallelujah
[19:15] amen Jesus took all this reproach all
[19:18] this criticism on himself amen
[19:20] hallelujah he took the criticism of God
[19:22] on him Hallelujah because really they
[19:23] were criticizing God CU Jesus said I
[19:26] come from God and I go back to God
[19:28] hallelujah amen I my father are one he
[19:30] said my Doctrine is not mine I do what I
[19:32] hear from the father
[19:34] Hallelujah right cuz the reproaches that
[19:36] they put on God really fell on him true
[19:39] and so that's what happens sometimes you
[19:41] know God will allow us to be criticized
[19:43] and so what we do is we just put up with
[19:46] it and we we live a stronger Christian
[19:49] Life hallelujah amen we ought to Bear
[19:52] the infirmities of the weak or the
[19:53] younger in the faith Hallelujah now
[19:56] let's watch in the next few months if we
[19:57] got to do that Hallelujah you know
[19:58] there's a probably there's a reason
[20:00] we're preaching this right God has a
[20:01] time and season for everything
[20:05] hallelu but remember now here's what I
[20:07] share with somebody online a critical
[20:09] spirit finds nothing good about a person
[20:12] right there's a difference between a
[20:13] weak Christian and somebody criticizing
[20:15] you I get these all the time online
[20:18] Proverbs 17:20 he that hath a frower
[20:21] heart findeth no good yeah so somebody
[20:25] would look at you know Christmas and
[20:26] they wouldn't find any good in it like
[20:28] they they would say well do you pray
[20:29] more during Christmas which we do do we
[20:33] read the Bible more during Christmas yes
[20:35] we
[20:36] do Hallelujah do we go to church on
[20:39] Christmas or do script church we go to
[20:41] church on Christmas amen right we're
[20:43] we're not worshiping less we're
[20:45] worshiping more
[20:48] Hallelujah right but if somebody's
[20:50] critical they won't ask about any good
[20:52] that comes out of it yeah they'll just
[20:55] criticize because they got an evil
[20:57] spirit so that case is different than
[20:59] somebody that's just weak yeah they're
[21:01] just weak they're just young I don't
[21:02] understand I thought it was wrong right
[21:06] it's different right and so that's a
[21:10] good scripture just reminded me a few
[21:12] months ago I just want to share that
[21:13] with you again you know listen to how
[21:15] people talk to you listen to how the
[21:17] people uh you know what they say when
[21:19] they criticize you because it shows
[21:22] where they're at it shows if it's a
[21:23] critical spirit or just
[21:25] immaturity then you know how to deal
[21:27] with it
[21:30] right Romans 15:4 for whatsoever things
[21:33] were written a four time I love this
[21:34] were're written for our learning
[21:36] remember when I preached that little
[21:37] series there was a two-part series
[21:38] called learning from Jesus Remember that
[21:41] right last year I was so blessed by
[21:44] that so Paul says all these things you
[21:47] know about Jesus being reproached you
[21:48] know and bearing the affirm of the week
[21:51] all that was written for our learning
[21:53] that we through patience and comfort of
[21:54] the scriptures might have hope amen look
[21:57] look how look how simple this
[22:00] is now remember learning is not an evil
[22:03] word Jesus said learn of me in Matthew
[22:05] 11 come unto me and we're going to read
[22:07] we're going to look at the Greek
[22:08] meanings of that in just a moment but
[22:10] this is speaking of spiritual learning
[22:12] not not Educational sful Learning right
[22:16] but actual learning from the holy spirit
[22:18] amen this is spiritual learning and it's
[22:21] so important if you don't get this
[22:23] learning you lose out on patience you
[22:26] miss the comfort of God we pray for
[22:28] people to be comforted like we're
[22:30] praying tonight but if we don't read the
[22:32] scripture we're going to miss out on
[22:33] that amen yes it's so important to learn
[22:37] and how do you learn it by reading the
[22:38] Old
[22:39] Testament right all the all the stories
[22:42] it teaches us patience amen it gives us
[22:44] Comfort praise God so that's why we must
[22:47] emphasize reading the scriptures
[22:50] preaching the scriptures if we want to
[22:52] get patient and if we want to be
[22:53] comforted in our trials amen hallelujah
[22:57] amen so important this is a book of Acts
[23:00] Church hallelujah
[23:02] amen Matthew 11:28 come unto me all you
[23:05] that labor that means tired or exhausted
[23:07] anybody tired or
[23:09] exhausted and or heavy laden which means
[23:11] loaded with a burden and I will give you
[23:14] rest so anyone that's tired and
[23:16] exhausted of trying to live right or you
[23:18] know just trying to live life Jesus said
[23:20] come to me amen now of course ultimately
[23:23] he's talking about the baptism of the
[23:24] Holy Ghost but as mature Christians we
[23:26] know we get tired in our daily life and
[23:28] that's where we need to renew our minds
[23:29] hallelujah
[23:32] amen so that's that's why we many times
[23:34] on a Wednesday night we say Lord I'm
[23:35] coming to you renew my strength
[23:37] Hallelujah renew my heart renew my
[23:38] vision renew my mind
[23:40] amen he said take my yoke upon you
[23:43] remember yoke was was something that
[23:44] held two Ox together for
[23:47] work so Jesus said if you want to if you
[23:50] want to get rest come work with
[23:52] me amen and learn of me take my yoke and
[23:55] learn from me for I'm Meek which means
[23:58] gentle so I'm a gentle
[24:00] worker and I'm lowly I'm humble in my
[24:03] heart oh yes Lord and you shall find
[24:05] rest for your soul that's speaking of
[24:08] the baptism of the Holy ghosten for my
[24:10] yoke is easy which means virtuous virtue
[24:14] it's manageable my my my burden my work
[24:17] is manageable amen see look that is that
[24:20] awesome you can manage what God wants
[24:22] you to do every single day Hallelujah
[24:25] you know we think I don't have enough
[24:26] time I don't have strength no you can
[24:28] manage
[24:28] Hallelujah there your yoke to Christ
[24:31] Hallelujah my yoke is easy it's
[24:33] manageable I can manage this day it
[24:36] means
[24:37] Pleasant and my burden is light amen see
[24:41] God won't put too much on you that you
[24:42] can't handle that's 1 Corinthians 10:13
[24:45] of course we're not going to read it but
[24:46] remember that so see Paul said learn
[24:48] from the scripture if you want to be
[24:50] patient and comforted Jesus said learn
[24:52] for me that's what that's Jesus is the
[24:54] word right in the beginning was the word
[24:56] the word was with God the Word was God
[24:58] Hallelujah and this is another form of
[25:00] the word of God hallelujah I keep in
[25:02] these alerts that the sound is so loud
[25:04] in here so turn that notification off I
[25:07] try to turn it up back to Romans 15:5
[25:10] now the god of patience and consolation
[25:12] Grant you to be likeminded one toward
[25:14] another according to Christ Jesus
[25:16] Remember Two Worlds are colliding the
[25:18] Jewish world and the Gentile world and
[25:20] Paul said grant that you'll be on minded
[25:25] that you can all think the same thing
[25:28] Hallelujah that's right the stronger
[25:30] ones will sacrifice things for the
[25:32] weaker ones and you'll be Christlike you
[25:36] learn how to be patient with each other
[25:39] you learn how to be comforted when you
[25:41] when you feel discomforted when life
[25:43] throws you a curveball a mountain come
[25:45] that's why I told Brother ni I said
[25:46] speak to that mountain brother yes I
[25:49] don't care if the Rocky Mountains move
[25:50] or not but I need the mountains of my
[25:53] life to move hallah right I don't care
[25:55] if the Appalachian Mountains or whatever
[25:57] mountains I want the mountains I want
[25:59] the trials in my life to move by the
[26:01] word of God
[26:03] hallelujah God verse six that ye may
[26:06] with one mind and one mouth glorify God
[26:09] even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[26:11] so Paul's saying You must be
[26:13] unified we want I want your worship to
[26:15] be unified that Jews and Gentiles no
[26:17] matter which background you come from
[26:19] holy days not holy days eating your
[26:21] diets like this my di like that I want
[26:23] you to all glorify Jesus Hallelujah with
[26:26] one voice amen amen so in other words
[26:28] Paul wanted strong Believers to please
[26:32] others rather than themselves and this
[26:35] mindset glorifies God right so the unity
[26:39] of the church glorifies God Amen and
[26:42] it's even like this you know kind of
[26:44] like uh I was mentioning with the prayer
[26:45] meetings it even like uh it's even
[26:48] submitting to what what I feel led to do
[26:50] right or like let's that's one example
[26:53] but let's look at another example we got
[26:54] three trustees what if what if our two
[26:56] trustees did something I didn't like
[26:58] what would I say I have to say Okay I'm
[27:00] going along with it now thankfully we
[27:02] had had to do that lately but it's a
[27:05] possibility like let's say at some point
[27:07] you know uh two trustees want to move
[27:09] and and I don't want to like move from
[27:11] this location well guess what I got to I
[27:14] got to I got to be
[27:16] unified right right or any like I can't
[27:18] hold a grudge against the two brothers
[27:20] right you know that's just two simple
[27:23] examples right amen of Christians
[27:26] bearing one another Hallelujah amen amen
[27:29] now thank God we've had very small
[27:31] decisions in our church but some
[27:32] Churches have big decisions it's like
[27:35] they got to vote a new pastor can you
[27:37] imagine that right I've seen I've seen
[27:39] that split churches I've seen
[27:41] it that's a big thing yeah what if
[27:44] you're the pastor you voted didn't get
[27:46] in or you when the new pastor comes up
[27:48] where you going to
[27:49] be think about that church this is
[27:53] Christianity we got to be like Christ
[27:56] Christ sacrifices his will for other
[27:59] people right brother man said he could
[28:02] have been married he could have he could
[28:05] have lived a longer life only live 33
[28:07] years he could have he could have
[28:09] skipped the cross he could have now we
[28:12] know he wouldn't have cuz he was the
[28:13] word but see he sacrificed his desires
[28:16] he didn't want to drink of the cup
[28:18] that's why he said take this cup away
[28:19] from me if it's possible Hallelujah the
[28:22] flesh didn't want to go to the Cross but
[28:24] he didn't please himself he pleased us
[28:27] hallelujah example the
[28:30] Savior so this mindset this Unity
[28:33] glorifies God verse 7 wherefore receive
[28:37] ye one another as Christ also received
[28:39] us from the glory of God receive means
[28:41] to take as your
[28:43] companion how did Jesus take you like
[28:46] like as His companion Jesus saved you I
[28:50] this he pulled you up out of the world
[28:52] and then he says he walks along with
[28:54] you and then remember like Footprints in
[28:56] the Sand of time sometimes on the
[28:58] there's only one footprint there's not
[29:00] two that's because Jesus is carrying you
[29:02] through your hard
[29:03] trials that's a that's a real companion
[29:05] right there yes he carries you when you
[29:08] feel like you can't walk you feel like
[29:11] you can't go any further with God and
[29:13] Jesus picks you up that's a real savior
[29:16] amen that's a real God who cares amen a
[29:19] real companion so Paul said receive the
[29:22] church receive everybody as Christ
[29:24] received
[29:25] you he didn't say well no you got to do
[29:27] everything I want you got to do you got
[29:30] to do this right now you got to give
[29:31] this up right now that's not the Christ
[29:32] I serve Christ accepted me even when I
[29:34] was just Justified I wasn't even
[29:35] Sanctified he still loved
[29:37] me he still received me when I wasn't
[29:40] even Sanctified Hallelujah that's why we
[29:43] got to serve others Hallelujah accept
[29:45] others Christ easily forgave us saved us
[29:49] accepted us we ought to easily accept
[29:51] others convictions in these areas of
[29:52] Liberty meat eating holy days wine uh
[29:55] eating meat sacrific Idols holy holy
[29:57] days like like I said some of these
[29:58] other
[30:00] things we ought to easily receive one
[30:04] another now in the next verse notice
[30:07] Paul Paul now goes into this Jew and
[30:09] Gentile section and he quotes four
[30:11] scriptures from the Old
[30:14] Testament it's just beautiful I love
[30:16] that I love I love what Paul did Paul
[30:18] met with Jesus Remember Galatians 1 said
[30:19] Paul met with Jesus in Arabia and then
[30:22] he learned the gospel from Jesus Christ
[30:25] and he comes back and writes it
[30:27] Hallelujah so we have a written copy of
[30:29] the scripture and I love it Paul
[30:32] interprets the Old Testament and he
[30:35] interprets it for us for the New
[30:36] Testament so now we know what these Old
[30:39] Testament verses mean without Paul we
[30:42] wouldn't know hallelujah amen and
[30:45] without brother Brandon they wouldn't be
[30:46] restored
[30:47] hallelujah hallelujah they wouldn't be
[30:49] restored to us
[30:51] hallelujah Romans 158 now I say that
[30:53] Jesus Christ was the minister of
[30:55] circumcision that refers to Jews right
[30:57] circumcised Jews
[30:58] yeah Israel for the truth of God so
[31:01] Jesus remember remember he told them he
[31:03] said I don't go to the Gentiles I go to
[31:04] the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[31:06] remember that of course not a couple
[31:08] times he didn't minister to the Gentiles
[31:09] he said you got great faith Hallelujah I
[31:11] haven't seen such Faith like this even
[31:13] in all of
[31:14] Israel to confirm the promises made un
[31:17] the fathers verse 9 and that the
[31:18] Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy
[31:22] so see we got a reason to glorify God
[31:24] today God's been merciful to us we
[31:27] didn't deserve his Mercy remember the
[31:29] Bible said in Ephesians we were far from
[31:31] the blood we are far from the covenants
[31:34] but by the blood of Christ we've come
[31:35] nigh to the Covenant
[31:38] oh and brother Paul texted me today he
[31:40] said I'm reading your book I thought
[31:43] Glory he took my book the thick one I'm
[31:45] talking I'm not talking about the little
[31:47] one I'm talking about the thick one he
[31:48] said oh he said I'm sorry if I preached
[31:50] the eight covenants different than you I
[31:52] said brother it's okay I said I was
[31:54] blessed I was just happy you got eight
[31:55] cuz I thought I was out of line
[31:58] and he and he I said you didn't do
[31:59] anything wrong brother just preach your
[32:01] conviction I said God will straighten
[32:03] everything out if I'm wrong God will
[32:04] straighten everything out he said that
[32:06] he said that sounds so beautiful he said
[32:07] just like brother R said we have no
[32:09] Creed but Christ no law but love no book
[32:11] but the Bible
[32:13] Hallelujah even though we might see
[32:14] things different we have the love of
[32:16] Jesus
[32:19] Christ so Paul says as it's written
[32:22] verse 9 for this cause I'll confess to
[32:24] thee among the Gentiles and sing of thy
[32:26] name he's actually citing psalm 1849 I
[32:28] had it all up here I had all ready to
[32:31] go it says therefore will I sing thanks
[32:34] unto thee Oh Lord among the Heathen so
[32:36] guess what we were in in the Old
[32:38] Testament we're called
[32:40] Heathen but now we're called beloved
[32:43] Hallelujah I used to be a heathen but
[32:46] now I'm beloved of Jesus Christ
[32:49] Hallelujah and sing praises unto thy
[32:52] name next one verse 10 and again so the
[32:55] second verse and again Rejoice ye
[32:57] Gentiles with with his people that's s
[32:59] Paul picking up Deuteronomy 32:43
[33:02] Rejoice oh ye nations with his people
[33:06] hallelujah that's right so now we're
[33:08] supposed to
[33:09] Rejoice if we're going to Rejoice we
[33:11] better dance sometimes we better shout
[33:14] sometimes you better clap sometimes the
[33:16] Bible says Rejoice
[33:19] hallelujah
[33:21] hallelujah verse 11 and again third time
[33:23] he said praise the Lord all you Gentiles
[33:25] and L him all you people reciting Psalms
[33:29] 117 verse1 it says oh praise the Lord
[33:32] Jehovah capital l r d Jehovah the
[33:35] personal name of God oh praise the Lord
[33:38] all ye nations praise him all ye people
[33:42] hallelujah oh I love it and the fourth
[33:45] one and again Isaiah sayith verse 12
[33:47] Romans 15:12 there should be a root of
[33:49] Jesse I love how my B my name's All
[33:51] Through the Bible I love that love how
[33:52] my name's connected to Jesus thank you
[33:55] Mom thanks Dad and he he that shall rise
[33:59] to reain over the Gentiles in him shall
[34:02] the Gentiles trust Paul's quoting Isaiah
[34:06] 11:10 and in that day there shall be a
[34:08] root of Jessie which shall stand for an
[34:11] inside of the people it's like a
[34:13] flag to it shall the Gentiles seek
[34:16] remember that's what the Bible says uh
[34:18] when the enemy comes in like a flood we
[34:19] just had another flood the spirit of God
[34:21] will raise up a standard a standard is a
[34:23] ring Play
[34:25] Hallelujah and the Bible said there'll
[34:27] be a root of Jesse and there'll be a
[34:29] ring place for the Gentiles hallelujah
[34:31] amen to it shall the Gentiles seek and a
[34:35] ring place is a place where we can fight
[34:37] the enemy together Hallelujah so as an
[34:40] army we're not spread out we're not
[34:41] divided but we've got a place where we
[34:43] gather we rally and say we're fighting
[34:46] from here we got to the full armor of
[34:48] God
[34:50] hallelujah and the Bible said to it
[34:52] shall the Gentiles seek that flag that
[34:54] rallying
[34:55] place and his rest shall be glorious
[34:59] that's the same rest we just read about
[35:01] Jesus said come unto me all you that are
[35:03] weary heavy laden I'll give you rest
[35:05] hallelujah amen I'll give you rest at
[35:08] the rallying place at the location of
[35:10] the flag the banner oh His Banner Over
[35:13] Us is love amen you beloving bride
[35:16] hallelujah it's Banner is love amen
[35:20] we're fighting a battle that's already
[35:21] been one hallelujah our Banner is the
[35:24] love of Jesus Christ and we rally there
[35:27] and that's what the Gentiles did by the
[35:28] grace of God we trust in Jesus
[35:32] Hallelujah his rest shall be
[35:35] glorious amen we'll trust in Jesus
[35:38] Christ amen I hope you're not trusting
[35:40] in your Merit tonight I hope you're
[35:42] trusting in the blood of Jesus
[35:44] Christ that's what the Bible said you
[35:46] got to trust in Jesus Hallelujah in him
[35:48] not in me not in your brother or your
[35:50] sister trust in Christ hallelujah amen
[35:53] verse 13 Romans 15:13 now the god of
[35:56] Hope fill you with all joy Joy that's
[35:57] why I was glad we saying about Joy
[35:59] before him cuz I was like oh yeah that's
[36:00] right that's in my notes hallelujah amen
[36:02] so Paul says God fill these juice and
[36:05] Gentiles that sometimes Clash some are
[36:07] weaker than others and they sometimes
[36:09] they're critical of others and sometimes
[36:11] they got differences in their daily life
[36:13] he said God fill them with all joy and
[36:16] peace in believing that ye may abound
[36:19] that word means overflow living in the
[36:21] Overflow Hallelujah that song I'm living
[36:24] in the
[36:26] Overflow that's what Paul wants us to do
[36:29] have joy and peace that overflows after
[36:31] other people oh my through the power of
[36:35] the Holy Ghost amen amen so see that is
[36:38] another form of power no doubt the nine
[36:40] gifts of the holy spirit are power the
[36:42] five preaching gifts are power but when
[36:44] you get an anointing of spirit of the
[36:46] Holy Spirit on you and you have joy and
[36:48] peace that overflows that's the power of
[36:51] God amen amen when you go out public and
[36:54] people notice you're joyful or happy I
[36:56] think it was nature we all week Go
[36:58] nature said you're the only one happy in
[36:59] here I think you said it or virtue
[37:02] said we are an AI everybody looked mean
[37:04] this on a Saturday like I was
[37:08] like well you know I trained myself to
[37:11] do that because I know it's a
[37:12] battlefield these are mean people in
[37:13] there I appreciate it I think it was
[37:15] nature or virtue they said brother Jesse
[37:17] you're the only one happy in here I said
[37:20] I ought to be I'm a Christian hallelujah
[37:22] amen and cuz I know people are watching
[37:24] me I always try to remember people are
[37:25] watching me I got my Jesus hat on you
[37:27] know people they're watching is what's
[37:30] he like what kind of church member what
[37:33] kind of church does he belong to I don't
[37:35] belong to a church necessarily I I
[37:37] belong to a body of Believers amen I
[37:40] belong to a body the body of Jesus
[37:42] Christ Hallelujah I don't belong to a
[37:44] church I belong to Christ
[37:47] Hallelujah so see the power of God comes
[37:50] on you as we sing worship as you repent
[37:52] as you pray power comes on you and then
[37:55] it overflows
[37:57] into the church amen and you're filled
[38:00] with all the joy and peace that you need
[38:03] amen see church we should desire to be
[38:05] full of joy and peace does that sound
[38:07] familiar didn't brother Jesse didn't you
[38:08] preach on that last chapter yes I did
[38:10] Romans
[38:12] 14:17 says the kingdom of God is Not
[38:14] meat and drink but righteousness peace
[38:17] and
[38:18] joy I love it praise God so Paul uses
[38:21] two out of those same three attributes
[38:24] joy and peace well no one you got joy
[38:25] and peace the kingdom of God's inside
[38:27] you hallelujah amen a part of God a part
[38:31] of God is inside of us hallelujah God
[38:34] Amen the same one who sits on the throne
[38:37] right that that's a that's a spiritual
[38:38] body that's a the Bible calls it a
[38:40] Celestial body I'm kind of getting into
[38:41] my sermon on the seven dimensions that
[38:43] that's a Celestial body remember those
[38:46] bodies can wrestle the Angels wrestle in
[38:47] those celestial bodies those spiritual
[38:50] bodies kind of like this in one way they
[38:53] wrestle and God is you know in Christ in
[38:56] that body but his Spirit can be
[38:58] everywhere and he divides himself and
[39:01] the Eternal one puts a portion of
[39:03] Eternity in each one of us praise God
[39:05] hallelujah am amen and the god of Heaven
[39:08] is in us hallelujah so that's why we
[39:10] have joy and peace hallelujah amen and
[39:12] righteousness amen and don't forget that
[39:16] church the Bible said should overflow in
[39:19] Hope remember Romans chapter 4 the four
[39:22] steps to Hope tribulation Works what
[39:26] patience yes you got to have trials if
[39:29] you want to be
[39:30] patient patience which is steadfast
[39:33] waiting accomplishes or Works what
[39:35] experience which is character yes so
[39:39] trials bring you patience patience gives
[39:41] you character and character gives you
[39:43] hope amen which is a confident
[39:46] expectation chch that that's that's a
[39:49] that's a mature Christian a mature
[39:51] Christian is confident about their
[39:53] expectation that I'm going to heaven
[39:55] I've got the Holy Ghost Jesus is coming
[39:57] back from me I'm going in the Rapture
[39:59] praise God that's the hope of the church
[40:02] Hallelujah that's the the the the the
[40:05] four step of this maturity process I'm
[40:08] confident I'll be there
[40:10] Hallelujah because I've gone through
[40:12] trials and I've got patience and I've
[40:14] got experiences and now I got hope I've
[40:16] got an expectation that when the RS
[40:19] caught up yonder I'll be there
[40:22] amen gone through enough trials to know
[40:25] Hallelujah that he's with me he's giving
[40:27] me Grace Hallelujah he's loved me
[40:30] Hallelujah he's poured out his grace
[40:32] upon me Hallelujah am that's one thing
[40:34] I'll never doubt that God loves me
[40:36] Hallelujah well you know by his grace by
[40:38] his grace I could go through a joke
[40:40] trial I could go through other
[40:41] trials I hope by the grace of God I
[40:43] never would doubt his love for
[40:46] me now Paul switches gears now we gone
[40:49] through these two two topics right we
[40:51] just left Jew and Gentile now we go Paul
[40:53] the minister to the Gentiles Paul's
[40:55] Ministry Romans 15:14 and I myself also
[40:58] am persuaded of you my brethren that ye
[41:00] also are full of goodness filled with
[41:04] knowledge able also to admonish one
[41:07] another so Paul says you're full of all
[41:10] these good
[41:11] things this is quite a
[41:15] compliment Paul Paul's never even been
[41:17] there brother he hadn't even been there
[41:20] but from what he heard from the Saints
[41:22] he said you are full of goodness filled
[41:25] with knowledge you know things about the
[41:27] word word knowledge means understand you
[41:29] understand the gospel amen
[41:32] hallelujah and you're able to admonish
[41:34] which means warn or exort or encourage
[41:37] or urge one another when you urge people
[41:39] to do things and you you encourage them
[41:41] to do things that's admonish amen right
[41:45] so that's how we should be as Christians
[41:47] we're full of goodness we we understand
[41:49] things and we're urging other people to
[41:51] do things amen of course obey the word
[41:53] of God Amen right obey the word of God
[41:55] it's quite a compliment remember Romans
[41:57] 1:8 Paul says your faith is spoken of
[42:00] throughout the whole world what a
[42:03] testimony Hallelujah so somehow the the
[42:07] faith there was such goodness in that
[42:08] Roman Church there was such knowledge
[42:10] such admonishment going on that the
[42:12] whole Christian World heard about it and
[42:15] Paul heard about it too that's quite a
[42:18] testimony Hallelujah so here we see
[42:21] which attributes are highly commendable
[42:23] in the Christian book of Acts Church
[42:25] being good having knowledge encouraging
[42:30] others Paul's persuaded that they're
[42:33] full of these things verse 15
[42:35] nevertheless Brethren I've written the
[42:37] more boldly unto you in some
[42:39] sort as putting you in mind because of
[42:42] the grace of God that's given to me of
[42:45] God verse 16 that I should be the
[42:47] minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles
[42:50] ministering the gospel of God remember
[42:52] gospel means what good
[42:54] news that the offering up of the
[42:56] Gentiles might be accepted
[42:57] being Sanctified by the Holy Ghost so
[43:01] Paul wrote boldly because he knew God
[43:03] chose him to go to the Gentiles remember
[43:06] that in the book of Acts when he got
[43:07] converted the Holy Ghost said uh Paul
[43:10] you're going to suffer many things for
[43:11] my name's sake but you're going to go to
[43:13] the Gentiles and turn them from Darkness
[43:16] to light amen you're going to take them
[43:18] from the power of Darkness to the power
[43:20] of God hallelujah this is why he could
[43:23] be bold with the church CU he said I
[43:25] know Jesus called me to do this and as
[43:27] your pastor sometimes I can be bold cuz
[43:29] I know God sent me to a
[43:31] Hallelujah I know I didn't ask to preach
[43:33] I didn't ask for all these things God
[43:35] called me to these things Hallelujah God
[43:37] ordained these things in my life like I
[43:38] told you two at least two people have
[43:40] said I knew you're going to preacher
[43:41] even you're going to be a preacher even
[43:43] before I preach one sermon they already
[43:45] saw the gift of God like I told that uh
[43:48] friend even when I went to my first
[43:52] uh uh my first uh interview to get my
[43:56] job there in
[43:58] a Christian woman was sitting there that
[43:59] goes to the chapel and she said as soon
[44:00] as you walked in we knew you're
[44:01] Christian you had a light over you
[44:03] praise
[44:05] God all I know is I just showered and
[44:07] shaved and got on my suit and tie and
[44:09] was being happy as
[44:12] possible
[44:14] hallelujah it's just the grace of God on
[44:16] your life it's just the Holy Ghost right
[44:19] it's just the Overflow amen we must had
[44:22] a good service that that day before
[44:23] Hallelujah it was already overflowing
[44:25] amen I I kept the we was keeping the
[44:27] victory by God's
[44:29] grace see we can be bold when we know
[44:32] what God's called us to do true if Jesus
[44:35] called me to it I'll be able to get
[44:37] through it Hallelujah I'll be able to do
[44:39] it if Jesus called me to do it
[44:41] Hallelujah that's a nice little
[44:43] r remember Paul knew I was called to
[44:47] make the church a chased virgin to
[44:49] Christ 2 Corinthians 11:2 that was not
[44:51] just for Corinth that was for the entire
[44:54] church remember as soon as you get saved
[44:56] all all your sins are forgiven you're a
[44:58] virgin to Christ amen hallelujah that
[45:01] old husband is dead now you can be
[45:03] married to Jesus
[45:05] Hallelujah no stains there's no mem to
[45:09] those former things the old things have
[45:11] passed away behold All Things become new
[45:13] hallelujah amen All Things become new
[45:16] you make all things new
[45:19] Hallelujah verse 16 that I should be the
[45:21] minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles
[45:24] ministering the gospel of God that the
[45:26] offering of of the Gentiles might be
[45:28] acceptable being Sanctified by the Holy
[45:32] Ghost Hallelujah now I want to look at
[45:35] that word sanctification how many heard
[45:36] brother R Define it brother R always
[45:38] says it's a what a compound word right
[45:42] brother always says the word sanctify is
[45:43] a compound compound word mean to to
[45:46] clean out and set aside for service that
[45:48] sound familiar
[45:50] right now I don't know which uh lexicon
[45:53] he used mine doesn't say that but I'll
[45:55] take brother's word for it cuz it fits
[45:57] this the word Sanctified is hagazo I
[46:01] don't probably not saying that right it
[46:04] means to separate from profane things
[46:07] and dedicate to God to
[46:10] consecrate or to purify amen
[46:14] hallelujah right we all got things in
[46:16] our life we got to we got to separate it
[46:18] from other things so it doesn't get
[46:19] contaminated right especially in the
[46:21] fridge you know or other places you got
[46:25] to set that aside even a gun
[46:27] right you got to set that aside the kids
[46:30] don't get into those things that's just
[46:32] a small example you got to set I got to
[46:34] set the gasoline way up there so the
[46:36] kids don't get into the gasoline they
[46:37] got to set up on the Shelf got to
[46:38] sanctify that got to set that aside
[46:42] that's what Paul said I'm a minister to
[46:43] the Gentiles to make you an acceptable
[46:47] offering to God Amen and you're
[46:49] Sanctified by the Holy Ghost amen so the
[46:52] preaching of the word reading the
[46:53] scripture amen being patient getting
[46:56] comfort all that will continually and it
[46:59] will constantly separate you from the
[47:01] things of the world to a holy life
[47:03] Hallelujah that's what I've seen that's
[47:05] why I love coming to church that's why
[47:07] Church never gets old God is sanctifying
[47:09] me he's making me different from my
[47:10] former life he's making me different
[47:12] from the world and I'm a I'm an offering
[47:15] that's Sanctified by the Holy Ghost
[47:17] hallelujah our lives are an offering
[47:19] under the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen
[47:21] that's what the Bible says I'm
[47:24] continually being separated more and
[47:26] more unto the service of God amen amen
[47:30] amen you know I can't do some of those
[47:32] things I used to do I can't go to some
[47:35] of those places I used to go Hallelujah
[47:37] right there just certain things I can't
[47:39] do because God has shown me he separated
[47:41] me to serve him
[47:43] amen things that are profane I separate
[47:46] myself from that right we all do that
[47:48] that's what Paul says Paul said I I
[47:50] ministered to you so you be Sanctified
[47:53] by the Holy Ghost away from the things
[47:54] of the
[47:55] world verse 17 I have Therefore whereof
[47:59] I may Glory through Jesus Christ in
[48:02] those things which pertain to God now I
[48:05] didn't know how to quite uh understand
[48:08] that so I looked it up and Albert Barnes
[48:10] preacher from the 1800s he said Paul
[48:13] says I have a cause of rejoicing that
[48:16] God has made me a minister to the
[48:17] Gentiles that's what that means when it
[48:18] says I may Glory Paul is saying I can
[48:22] Rejoice because Jesus has done things
[48:24] that pertain to God in my life amen
[48:26] other words I can Rejoice because God's
[48:28] used
[48:29] me right that's what we can do as well
[48:32] that's what you and I we can rejoice
[48:33] when God uses us hallelujah cuz we're
[48:35] not worthy to be
[48:38] used we never lived a perfect holy life
[48:41] right you know we're not holy like the
[48:43] Angels who never sinned we fall short of
[48:45] God's Glory Hallelujah but he still
[48:47] sanctifies us he cleans us up and he
[48:49] uses us amen and then we can Glory I
[48:52] just read through this week remember
[48:53] brother amen when we preached on it over
[48:55] there all the things Paul did Paul would
[48:58] consent unto Christians dying he said I
[49:02] took many people to prison two
[49:06] prisons he he tried to get people to
[49:08] blast you in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:11] and yet Paul says I can Rejoice cuz God
[49:12] is using me oh if God used Paul Church
[49:15] God will use you Hallelujah forget about
[49:17] your past confess your sins amen move on
[49:20] with God let the Holy Ghost sanctify you
[49:22] and then you can glory and what God does
[49:24] in our lives Hallelujah
[49:27] he just did some of the most awful
[49:28] things right he tried to blashe he tried
[49:31] to get people to blashe the name of
[49:32] Jesus the unforgivable sin and yet God
[49:35] could still use him amen oh don't you
[49:38] love
[49:39] Grace unmerited favor amen I didn't
[49:42] deserve this he just poured out his
[49:45] favor on me amen
[49:51] glory Verse 18 for I will not dare to
[49:54] speak of any of those things which
[49:55] Christ has not wrought by me to make the
[49:58] Gentiles obedient by word or deed now
[50:01] here we get into an interesting
[50:03] statement remember Paul's trying to
[50:05] share with them that Jesus called him to
[50:08] the to his ministry it wasn't somebody
[50:11] else Jesus called him so he said I won't
[50:14] talk about things other Preachers did
[50:17] I'm only talking about what I
[50:19] did he said I'm going to basically
[50:21] confine myself strictly to what I've
[50:22] done I do not uh lift up myself or
[50:27] connect myself to what Christ has done
[50:28] by other people now this is a good
[50:31] lesson for us we thank God for brother
[50:33] brandham but brother bram's off the
[50:34] scene now we got to have
[50:36] testimonies I like reading brother's
[50:38] testimonies I like uh hearing them but
[50:41] we got to have testimonies I think
[50:43] that's how this applies to us we we
[50:45] shouldn't Glory so much in what God did
[50:47] through brother brand we should thank
[50:48] God for that we should say God use me
[50:51] Hallelujah use my life help me to uh be
[50:54] a servant to you amen uh you me her
[50:57] testimonies as well praise God Paul said
[51:00] I'm not going to speak about what Christ
[51:01] did through other people to make the
[51:04] Gentiles obedient by word or deed I'm
[51:06] going to speak of what God did in my
[51:08] life and remember Church you're rewarded
[51:10] for your
[51:11] labor you get a reward now remember the
[51:13] foolish version the only reward they get
[51:15] is eternal life brother R tells us in
[51:16] the church age book right they have no
[51:18] other inheritance other than eternal
[51:20] life right but if we're filled with the
[51:22] Holy Ghost now we can earn rewards amen
[51:26] right because we're pressing on toward
[51:27] the High Calling amen amen hallelujah
[51:30] we're not settling just for
[51:31] justification we're pressing on to the
[51:33] deeper things of God Paul said all those
[51:36] who labor are rewarded for their labors
[51:39] if their labors stand the test of the
[51:41] fires of God that's in 1 Corinthians
[51:44] chapter 3 we're not going to read it
[51:46] because of time already been preaching
[51:48] 45 minutes I hard believe
[51:50] that verse 19 Paul said through Mighty
[51:53] signs and wonders by the power of the
[51:55] spirit of God so that from Jerusalem and
[51:57] round about
[51:58] unto I a lum I have fully preached the
[52:02] gospel of Christ amen so Paul said see
[52:05] I'm not going to talk about what others
[52:07] or what God did through other people
[52:09] because you know what God did through me
[52:11] that's right you've seen God use me
[52:13] Hallelujah he says I was called by God
[52:16] to make you obedient to make you
[52:17] Sanctified to make you an offering
[52:20] that's acceptable to God and God has
[52:22] done many signs and wonders Paul says in
[52:24] my life by the spirit of God and I fully
[52:27] preach the gospel of Christ amen so what
[52:29] is he telling them I'm God's Prophet
[52:31] amen right that's what he's saying it's
[52:33] undeniable Paul was God's Prophet
[52:35] Hallelujah verse 20 yay so have I
[52:38] strived to preach the gospel not where
[52:40] Christ was named lest I should build
[52:43] upon another man's
[52:44] Foundation Hallelujah now Paul says in
[52:47] in the in Corinthians everybody else
[52:50] Builds on his foundation yes see Paul
[52:53] knew he was called he was the minister
[52:55] to the Gentiles the church yes Jesus was
[52:58] Min I'm sorry Peter was Peter and Jesus
[52:59] ministered to the circumcision we saw
[53:01] that today but Paul said I I didn't when
[53:04] I minister to Gentiles I didn't build on
[53:05] anybody else's preaching I started my
[53:07] own
[53:08] Ministry that everybody else Gentiles
[53:11] would build it on mine I I love church I
[53:13] love when I preach something I love
[53:15] brother William I can look down and if
[53:16] I'm preaching something real high up
[53:18] here I'm real glad I can look down and
[53:19] say I got a nice Foundation my
[53:21] Foundation St Paul
[53:23] Hallelujah I got a pretty strong
[53:25] Foundation my foundation's not got any
[53:27] cracks in it hallelujah it's sealed to
[53:30] the day of redemption hallelujah amen
[53:32] hallelujah I got a firm foundation when
[53:34] I'm preaching out of Paul's gospel I got
[53:36] a firm place to stand
[53:39] Hallelujah cuz I am building on top of
[53:41] his foundation that's right he laid he's
[53:44] the wise master builder
[53:46] Hallelujah now we're right at the top of
[53:48] that pyramid We
[53:49] Believe now if not there could be
[53:51] another generation after us well then
[53:53] I'm we're close to the top we're really
[53:55] close to the top
[53:57] Hallelujah if we get changed the moment
[53:59] ween alive then we were the top but if
[54:01] not we'll be right towards the top
[54:03] somewhere at the top by God's grace
[54:05] that's where God ordained
[54:07] us verse 20 so or yay so have I strived
[54:11] to preach to gospel not where Christ is
[54:13] nam th I'm sorry I read that verse 21
[54:15] but as it is written to whom he was not
[54:17] spoken of they shall see speaking of the
[54:18] Gentiles and they that have not heard
[54:20] shall understand so Paul knew I'm called
[54:22] to the Gentiles I'm going to preach
[54:24] where nobody else preached before I'll
[54:26] say like this church I'm thankful we're
[54:28] the first message Church in
[54:31] Aron so I'm not building on another
[54:33] person's foundation
[54:35] in we laid the
[54:37] foundation brother bang and I we can say
[54:40] we laid the foundation now you're laying
[54:41] it with me yes amen I'm thankful for
[54:44] that because there's there you know
[54:46] everybody has a a purpose right
[54:48] everybody has a time and season and
[54:49] purpose but I'm thankful and I said like
[54:51] this I'm thankful I don't got to correct
[54:53] somebody before me I don't have to
[54:54] correct their false doctrines I'm glad I
[54:56] can just lay in the pure word of God

[55:39] none of us are standing on seeking SS
[55:41] this
[55:42] evening if you are that's not cuz we
[55:44] preach false Doctrine it's because you
[55:45] left the word of God now none of you are
[55:48] I'm just saying you know for the live
[55:49] streamers if people are on sinking sand
[55:52] it's not because of what we're preaching
[55:54] we're preaching the word of God h
[55:57] and if the Holy Ghost wants to correct
[55:58] me I want to be correct
[56:00] hallelujah amen I'm not going to dodge
[56:03] questions like on the internet I'm not
[56:04] going to dodge those questions now
[56:06] they're wasting my time that's different
[56:08] but I believe what I preach I can back
[56:10] it up by the word of God hallelujah amen
[56:14] amen thankful that we preach where not
[56:17] another man was building but we come
[56:18] here and build a fresh Church
[56:21] hallelujah
[56:23] amen verse 22 Paul's plan to is it Rome
[56:27] for which cause also I've been much
[56:29] hindered from coming to you now look at
[56:32] that he tried to get them so see Church
[56:36] um there's going to be times we really
[56:38] want to do something and I want you to
[56:39] notice this by history Paul never made
[56:42] it to Rome as far as the historians
[56:44] know see Church there's going to be
[56:46] things in life you want to accomplish
[56:49] and you know you're getting hindered but
[56:51] God hasn't called you to
[56:53] it but you you have the confidence all
[56:56] things work together for good to them
[56:57] that love the Lord yes amen Paul had
[57:00] this desire I want to be with you I keep
[57:02] getting
[57:03] hindered all right you might have the
[57:05] desires I feel like doing this I really
[57:07] do that I got a desire but things just
[57:08] keep hindering you yeah and that happens
[57:10] to me all the time
[57:12] financially I like to do something I
[57:14] like to get a new table or something and
[57:16] a new couch those couches are 14 years
[57:18] old you know but soon as something soon
[57:20] as something you know soon as I feel
[57:22] like I can get it something comes up
[57:24] that's just a small example
[57:26] I'm talking about like you know you want
[57:29] to travel somewhere you want to visit a
[57:30] church or you want to visit your father
[57:31] mother overseas or something you know
[57:33] something big you know and something
[57:35] keeps hindering you something that means
[57:36] a lot it would have meant a lot for Paul
[57:38] to go to that
[57:39] church CU he'd heard about him all
[57:41] around the
[57:43] world but something kept hindering
[57:46] him verse 23 but now having no more
[57:50] place in these parts and having a great
[57:52] desire these how many years years to
[57:56] come unto you so this was something
[57:58] years I haven't waited just a few weeks
[58:00] this wasn't waiting a week this was
[58:02] waiting years I'm waiting years on this
[58:08] desire there's a lot of times church God
[58:10] makes us wait years for our
[58:12] desires
[58:15] right so Paul repeats his desire church
[58:18] this is a repeat remember in chapter one
[58:20] he said I long to be with you that I
[58:21] could impart some spiritual gift to you
[58:24] that's why I want to go down to Junction
[58:25] City that's why I want to keep pastoring
[58:27] here so I can impart some spiritual gift
[58:30] to you I can see God used any gift in my
[58:33] life that would be a help to you it
[58:35] would strengthen you right I want to see
[58:37] you strong I want to see you overcoming
[58:40] I I do too but that's the real desire of
[58:42] preacher they want to be used by God so
[58:44] the gift of God can go to work and it
[58:46] can be a benefit and people can be
[58:48] encouraged they can be admonished
[58:50] Hallelujah by the word of God
[58:53] hallelujah and he had this desire for
[58:55] many years I'd like to be there in
[58:58] person I've been asked since I started
[59:00] pastoring back in 2006 I've been asked
[59:02] we come to this country in Africa we
[59:04] come to this country and they asked me
[59:06] in uh Zimbabwe they asked me uh Zambia
[59:10] they've asked me to come to Australia
[59:12] I'm like I can't come to these places I
[59:14] don't have enough money first of
[59:16] all second of all I got these eight kids
[59:19] and I'm going to leave my wife alone
[59:20] with these eight
[59:21] kids but I have that desire and you know
[59:25] maybe someday I'll get this I don't know
[59:27] I told the brothers I told Brother a few
[59:28] weeks ago I said brother I'll come to
[59:30] Nigeria or whatever or whatever it was I
[59:32] said come there you only got to wait 20
[59:34] more years Till I Retire that's all you
[59:35] got to wait I said but it'll go like
[59:38] that go like
[59:41] that now I'm not saying I'll go there
[59:44] but it's that idea where you desire
[59:46] something you long to do something you
[59:49] have to wait many years but eventually
[59:51] God will give you the answer in Paul's
[59:53] case it was no Paul you're not going
[59:54] there but you get to meet him and Glory
[59:56] Hallelujah all those Romans get to run
[59:58] you my precious brother my precious
[1:00:00] brother just like they random brother
[1:00:02] random Hallelujah if you would not have
[1:00:04] gone I wouldn't be here hallelujah if
[1:00:07] you would not have preached I would not
[1:00:08] have received it if you would not have
[1:00:10] sacrificed I wouldn't be here I'm here
[1:00:12] because God used you to make me an
[1:00:14] offering to Jesus Christ
[1:00:17] hallelujah amen verse 24 whensoever I
[1:00:21] take my journey to Spain I will come for
[1:00:23] you look he's already got his plans
[1:00:26] for I trust to see you my journey and to
[1:00:28] be brought on my way thitherward by you
[1:00:31] if first I be somewhat filled with your
[1:00:33] test your company
[1:00:34] sorry but now I go into Jerusalem to
[1:00:36] minister under the Saints see his life
[1:00:38] was all about ministering I want to do
[1:00:40] this but I got to minister I got to
[1:00:42] serve other people
[1:00:43] first and his historians say it's
[1:00:46] uncertain whether he ever visited Rome
[1:00:47] or not there's no record of it that I
[1:00:50] found but it's clear Paul was led by the
[1:00:53] spirit of God to minister to people amen
[1:00:56] serve others verse 26 I'll just say it's
[1:00:59] a real it's a it's a joy to serve you
[1:01:02] just by preaching the word it's a joy to
[1:01:03] serve this church I'm so blessed to have
[1:01:06] a church like this I've heard other
[1:01:08] pastors talk about their churches we're
[1:01:10] I'm blessed to be the pastor of this
[1:01:12] church Hallelujah I'm blessed amen it's
[1:01:15] a joy to serve you by preaching the
[1:01:17] word verse
[1:01:20] 26 for it have pleased them of Macedonia
[1:01:23] and AI to make a certain in contribution
[1:01:26] for the poor Saints which are at
[1:01:28] Jerusalem now we're not going to turn
[1:01:29] there but if you haven't read this
[1:01:30] lately read it it's 2 Corinthians 8
[1:01:33] and9 Paul talks about all the uh all the
[1:01:36] liberality or the excess money and food
[1:01:39] that these Corinthians had and they said
[1:01:42] you God loves a cheerful Giver Paul said
[1:01:44] I'm going around I'm collecting food and
[1:01:46] money for these now probably would have
[1:01:47] been money at this point right CU he had
[1:01:49] to do these big travels he said now the
[1:01:52] reason you guys got extra money is so
[1:01:54] you can give it to help these Saints out
[1:01:55] in Rome
[1:01:57] right right and Philippi and other
[1:01:59] places you know he would take these uh
[1:02:01] he would take these
[1:02:03] offerings he said it pleased them to
[1:02:06] make these contributions for the poor
[1:02:07] Saints and that's what that's what when
[1:02:09] Paul and Peter left and they shook hands
[1:02:11] they met think about those two prophets
[1:02:12] shaking hand God bless you serving the
[1:02:14] lord and prob saw Visions while they're
[1:02:16] shaking hands you know but their last
[1:02:18] word was remember the poor right that's
[1:02:21] the last thing you're going to tell me
[1:02:22] don't don't forget the poor people
[1:02:24] begging out there on the street
[1:02:27] right he didn't say remember Jesus
[1:02:28] Remember these Visions he said Remember
[1:02:30] the poor because when you do it to the
[1:02:32] least of these my brothers amen done it
[1:02:35] unto me
[1:02:37] Hallelujah that's why it's good to send
[1:02:40] contributions to the poor Saints
[1:02:43] Hallelujah remember God loves a cheerful
[1:02:46] giver and voluntar voluntarily
[1:02:53] giving remember he told them to bring
[1:02:55] this on the first first day of the week
[1:02:56] that's 1 Corinthians 16:1 so that's the
[1:02:58] day you bring your tithes and offerings
[1:02:59] and donations to the poor so that's how
[1:03:02] Paul set it up that's why we do it on
[1:03:03] Sunday right it could be Wednesday night
[1:03:05] I never passed a plate on Wednesday
[1:03:06] night our church is so SM um but that's
[1:03:10] where Paul set it up there verse 27 it
[1:03:13] hath pleased them verily and their
[1:03:16] debtors they
[1:03:19] are think about that
[1:03:22] debtors now this isn't of course a
[1:03:25] workspace ation but Paul's going to
[1:03:27] explain it here when somebody does
[1:03:30] something nice to you it it you should
[1:03:32] feel like I want to do something nice to
[1:03:36] them okay and we're we're going to
[1:03:38] explain that here for if the Gentiles
[1:03:40] have been made partakers of their
[1:03:42] spiritual things they talking about the
[1:03:44] Jews the poor Jews their duty is also to
[1:03:48] minister unto them in carnal
[1:03:51] things so Paul said the Jews got all
[1:03:54] this extra money and things I'm sorry
[1:03:55] the Gentiles got all this extra money
[1:03:57] but the the Jews are poor so he said
[1:03:59] because the Gentiles got the spiritual
[1:04:02] things from the Jews the Gentiles should
[1:04:05] give back the natural things to the
[1:04:07] Jews you gave me something I'm going to
[1:04:10] give you something back that's how we do
[1:04:13] in our church right you do something
[1:04:14] nice for me I do something nice for
[1:04:16] you
[1:04:18] Hallelujah that's what this is set up in
[1:04:20] the Bible it's a body it's a body
[1:04:24] ministry right
[1:04:27] amen so see there's nothing wrong with
[1:04:29] feel like oh I can't wait till their
[1:04:30] birthday I'm going to give them
[1:04:31] something back or I can't wait till
[1:04:33] Christmas or something you know I can't
[1:04:35] wait till they're need I like to help
[1:04:36] them out they're that's okay that's a
[1:04:38] Christian
[1:04:40] Spirit right there's nothing wrong with
[1:04:42] that because that's what happened here
[1:04:44] Paul was saying you guys got this extra
[1:04:46] you should help out those who were poor
[1:04:48] cuz really they blessed you right so you
[1:04:50] should be able to bless them back
[1:04:55] and this is the same way preachers Paul
[1:04:57] says this for uh tithes and offerings
[1:04:59] for for preachers in 1 Corinthians 9:11
[1:05:02] if they Minister spiritual things to you
[1:05:04] he said then what is it that you
[1:05:06] Minister the natural things to the
[1:05:07] preacher you know that's just it's the
[1:05:10] same idea if somebody's blessing you you
[1:05:13] should bless them and I'm not asking for
[1:05:14] money tonight I'm just saying it's it's
[1:05:17] a principle in in the in the family of
[1:05:19] God that's what Mary Magdalene did Lord
[1:05:22] Jesus cast seven demons out and so Mary
[1:05:25] Magdalene said I'm going to give money
[1:05:26] into your ministry I'm going to file you
[1:05:27] around and give money in your ministry
[1:05:29] Hallelujah I'm going to minister to you
[1:05:31] because you ministered to
[1:05:34] me the Bible says the body of Christ
[1:05:36] edifies itself in love Ephesians
[1:05:40] 4:16 other words you love people because
[1:05:43] they've been good to you and you want to

[1:06:00] them that money they actually have that
[1:06:01] money I will come to you into Spain now
[1:06:04] of course he never did as far as what we
[1:06:06] understand and I am sure that when I
[1:06:08] come unto you I shall come in the
[1:06:09] fullness of the blessing of the gospel
[1:06:13] of Christ amen I know if I ever get
[1:06:15] there I've been longing all these years

[1:06:20] Ministry but as far as we know it didn't
[1:06:23] happen verse 30 now I beseech you that
[1:06:28] means to beg or call upon brethren for
[1:06:31] the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and For the
[1:06:35] Love of the spirit I read this a few
[1:06:37] weeks ago and you did pray for me and I
