[53:07] repetitions
[53:09] as the heathen do it says for they think
[53:11] that they shall be heard for their much

[53:35] but it's just it's something when you're
[53:37] reading the word there's certain things
[53:39] kind of highlight

[53:43] stand in need of before we even ask
[53:46] because he's god right
[53:49] amen but then he still wants us to pray
[53:52] yes amen
[53:56] that's always got you know like lord i
[53:58] don't even need to break it you
[54:00] already know that he said pray
[54:04] be obedient amen
[54:08] and it does does it does good for our
[54:11] hearts for us to pray
[54:13] and and to see him move amen
[54:17] amen all right
[54:20] he comes down he says in verse 9
[54:23] after this manner therefore pray so now
[54:25] he's given instructions
[54:27] to his disciples on how to pray our
[54:30] father which art in heaven hallowed be
[54:32] thy name
[54:33] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[54:36] earth as it is in heaven
[54:38] give us this day our daily bread and
[54:41] forgive us
[54:41] our debts as we forgive our debtors and
[54:44] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[54:46] us from evil
[54:48] for thine is the kingdom and the power
[54:50] and the glory forever
[54:52] amen from here let's go to james chapter
[54:56] four
[55:00] and we're going to read a few places
[55:04] here
[55:08] james four i want to start at verse one
[55:12] it says from whence come wars and
[55:14] fightings among you
[55:16] he says come they not hence even of your
[55:19] lust that
[55:20] war in your members he says ye lust and
[55:23] ye
[55:24] have not ye kill and desire to have and
[55:27] cannot obtain
[55:28] ye fight in the war yet ye have not
[55:31] because ye ask not
[55:33] he says and ye ask watch this saints
[55:36] he says ye ask and receive not because
[55:39] ye
[55:39] ask amiss that ye may consume it upon
[55:43] your lust
[55:47] i want to come down to verse 13 it says
[55:49] go to now ye that say
[55:51] today or tomorrow we we will go into
[55:54] such a city and continue there a year
[55:56] and buy and sell and get gain whereas
[55:59] you know not what
[56:00] what shall be on the model it says for
[56:03] what is your life
[56:04] he says it is even a vapor that
[56:06] appeareth for a little time
[56:08] and then vanisheth away it says for ye
[56:11] for that ye ought to say if the lord
[56:15] will
[56:16] we shall live and do this and that
[56:19] amen let's pray once more father we've
[56:22] read your word
[56:23] now god please help us in jesus christ's
[56:26] name we ask
[56:27] amen amen god bless you saying she may
[56:30] be seated
[56:50] let me read one more place of scripture
[56:52] here
[56:55] first john chapter five
[57:00] and i want to start at verse 14.
[57:04] it says and this is the confidence that
[57:06] we have in him
[57:09] notice this now this is the confidence
[57:12] that we have
[57:13] in him that if we ask anything according
[57:16] to what
[57:18] his will he heareth us
[57:24] so he doesn't hear everything
[57:27] that's right am i correct amen
[57:30] amen but if we ask anything according to
[57:33] his will it says he heareth us
[57:35] it says and if we know that he hear her
[57:37] hear us
[57:38] it says whatsoever we ask we know that
[57:41] we have the petitions that we desired of
[57:43] him
[57:44] amen amen
[57:47] now that's all of our desires right
[57:49] that's right when we pray
[57:51] we desire to see god answer amen
[57:55] but there's something that god desires
[57:56] to see as well
[58:00] amen so by the grace of god i want to
[58:04] touch upon the subject of the lord's
[58:06] will amen
[58:08] the lord's will um this is very
[58:12] important to each one of us
[58:16] for each of our days that we live upon
[58:19] the earth
[58:20] every day of the week every hour of the
[58:24] day
[58:25] every minute of the day
[58:29] it's very important for us to be in the
[58:32] will of god
[58:34] because if we're not in the will of god
[58:37] what do we have
[58:40] if we're not in the will of god then
[58:42] whatever we are doing
[58:44] is completely in vain yes
[58:48] you know the bible actually says that
[58:50] there are many that worship him in vain
[58:52] that's right that's right isn't that
[58:54] something
[58:55] putting forth effort
[58:59] in many different ways financials you
[59:02] know just
[59:02] worship just whatever all the effort
[59:05] that people are putting forth in many
[59:07] places
[59:09] is actually in vain in the sight of god
[59:12] yet to them they're offering it to god
[59:17] and god is actually turning away from it
[59:19] worship
[59:21] yes gatherings to church services
[59:26] mega churches thousands of people
[59:30] and god is not in none of it
[59:34] think about that
[59:37] what kind of a deception is that yes sir
[59:41] we don't want to be deceived and by the
[59:44] grace of god i don't believe
[59:46] because of who we are to him we're his
[59:47] bride i don't believe we can be deceived
[59:50] amen i believe because of who we are to
[59:53] him
[59:53] by his grace he comes to us and he helps
[59:56] us
[59:58] he knows that we don't have it all
[59:59] together saints
[1:00:01] we go about life the best way we can
[1:00:05] isn't that right so the lord and and
[1:00:15] i'll pause for a moment because i don't
[1:00:16] know what i'm going to minister on
[1:00:17] tomorrow i got a little idea
[1:00:21] and i ain't want to tap into that too
[1:00:22] much of that happens to be what
[1:00:25] causes me to minister on tomorrow
[1:00:28] but you understand what i'm saying is
[1:00:30] like we don't know
[1:00:32] like what are we gonna do
[1:00:35] what are we gonna be doing at seven
[1:00:36] o'clock tonight
[1:00:38] who can tell me
[1:00:43] we don't know right we know when that
[1:00:47] time comes
[1:00:48] we can make plans right
[1:00:51] but who's to say those plans have to be
[1:00:53] carried out according to our fault
[1:00:57] that's why i believe it was here in in
[1:00:59] first
[1:01:00] no it's not first john it was in james
[1:01:02] yeah it was in james
[1:01:04] he actually says in verse 13 he says go
[1:01:07] to now ye that say
[1:01:08] and i wanna i wanna i wanna emphasize
[1:01:10] this one point
[1:01:12] this is the way of the world
[1:01:16] because i you know the brother asked me
[1:01:19] about my testimony and what have you i'm
[1:01:20] not gonna try to so much so deal with
[1:01:22] that tonight
[1:01:23] but the way of the world is do whatever
[1:01:26] you feel like
[1:01:30] god is not hell within within thought he
[1:01:32] he's not given a
[1:01:34] he's not giving the consideration
[1:01:38] right that i mean that's how right right
[1:01:41] now since
[1:01:42] majority of the world i mean we're in
[1:01:44] akron right now
[1:01:45] i guess this this is akron here right
[1:01:48] you know so we're in akron right now you
[1:01:49] know how many people are in akron
[1:01:53] and how many people right now how many
[1:01:55] people that's in acting right now
[1:01:57] how many of their minds are really on
[1:01:59] god
[1:02:01] how many are considering him
[1:02:06] asking of him you know lord what would
[1:02:09] you have me to do where would you have
[1:02:10] me to go
[1:02:11] right this is very precious in the sight
[1:02:14] of god
[1:02:15] for his creation to actually consider
[1:02:18] him
[1:02:21] because really since we don't know our
[1:02:23] own way
[1:02:24] it's impossible for us to i don't know
[1:02:26] what we'll be doing at seven o'clock
[1:02:29] i might still be preaching
[1:02:36] we'll save that for africa
[1:02:40] but i'm just saying you know i don't
[1:02:41] know i don't know what happened on
[1:02:43] tomorrow right
[1:02:44] we don't know it's by the grace of god
[1:02:46] we were able to make it here
[1:02:48] and being that we are here i believe
[1:02:50] brother charles it was the will of god
[1:02:51] for us to be here
[1:02:52] i believe it was the will of god for you
[1:02:54] to be here tonight with me
[1:02:56] god for he he saw these things before
[1:02:59] time but the key of it is is our motive
[1:03:01] and our objective
[1:03:04] you understand what i'm saying see the
[1:03:06] world they just want whatever they want
[1:03:10] life is all about them whatever i feel
[1:03:13] like whatever i want to have in life
[1:03:15] they feel like that life is here to
[1:03:17] cater to me
[1:03:19] right right to give me my desire what i
[1:03:22] want what i feel like
[1:03:23] at any given moment right
[1:03:27] and people go out to try to achieve what
[1:03:29] they want
[1:03:31] and as the bible says here in james and
[1:03:33] this is the mindset
[1:03:34] saints it says go to now ye
[1:03:38] that say he's addressing a group
[1:03:43] amen he's not just speaking out in the
[1:03:46] air
[1:03:46] amen there's something in the spirit
[1:03:48] he's seen
[1:03:50] and he's addressing it by the spirit of
[1:03:52] god ye that
[1:03:53] say today or tomorrow we will go into
[1:03:56] such a city and continue there a year
[1:03:59] how do you know you're going to be there
[1:04:00] a year
[1:04:03] something might happen in a month you
[1:04:05] might break down on a way there and
[1:04:07] can't even get the way you thought you
[1:04:08] were going
[1:04:12] but he's addressing something here
[1:04:14] saints he says we're going to continue
[1:04:16] there a year
[1:04:17] about and buy and sell and get game how
[1:04:20] you know you're going to get gang you
[1:04:21] might not say on nothing
[1:04:23] that's right right yes just because you
[1:04:26] go to
[1:04:26] set up a table somewhere to try to sell
[1:04:29] a product who's to say somebody even
[1:04:31] gonna come to your table
[1:04:33] you don't know that right isn't that
[1:04:36] right
[1:04:36] yes but how many realize that by the
[1:04:38] grace of god if our motive and our
[1:04:40] objective is right
[1:04:43] we can tap into the channel of god
[1:04:46] you see through prayer we can actually
[1:04:50] tap into the very channel and the
[1:04:51] inspiration of god listen now
[1:04:54] to where we can hear his thoughts
[1:05:00] how precious is that yes
[1:05:04] young and old how precious is that
[1:05:07] for us to be in a place where we can
[1:05:09] actually hear the thoughts of god
[1:05:12] because the bible says if we ask
[1:05:13] anything according to his will
[1:05:17] how are we going to know his will we
[1:05:18] don't know but we can be in a place of
[1:05:21] consecration
[1:05:22] amen and consideration of god to where
[1:05:25] he's pleased to come down
[1:05:27] and make known his will to you and i
[1:05:32] amen now we're not so that we can now
[1:05:34] give him his will
[1:05:36] he ain't interested in getting nothing
[1:05:38] else
[1:05:42] that's why he was so pleased with abel
[1:05:45] abel gave god his will
[1:05:48] and god received it amen
[1:05:53] but on the other hand his brother
[1:06:00] he gave something else that's right now
[1:06:03] this is a very
[1:06:05] key point right here now what his
[1:06:08] brother gave
[1:06:09] was the will of satan that's right right
[1:06:14] that's right like i said many churches
[1:06:17] out
[1:06:18] there many people gathering
[1:06:21] but whose will are they fulfilling
[1:06:27] that seems something
[1:06:30] you got a church building that has a
[1:06:32] cross on the top
[1:06:34] you have people coming dressed right
[1:06:37] right they're greeting one another in
[1:06:40] the name of the lord
[1:06:43] they're coming in together right they
[1:06:46] have a unity among them
[1:06:48] they're having church service right
[1:06:53] and god is not even there
[1:06:59] he rejects it
[1:07:02] just like he did cain he rejected king's
[1:07:07] worship why
[1:07:09] that don't seem right but look at the
[1:07:11] effort he put forth
[1:07:13] look at the care the real care that he
[1:07:16] that he poured into what his offering
[1:07:19] was
[1:07:19] to god and god didn't know that you
[1:07:24] would think many people think of god in
[1:07:25] this way
[1:07:27] see god he's so loving and so kind man
[1:07:30] he
[1:07:30] he he looks upon your efforts and
[1:07:32] whatever you do he just
[1:07:34] receives it he's just there to accept it
[1:07:37] and and just be all right and just just
[1:07:40] you know no he's not like that
[1:07:42] he told cain look i can't accept that
[1:07:46] right he saw how it made kane feel
[1:07:53] listen now
[1:07:56] and he didn't feel the comfort king
[1:08:04] oh it's all right you know you try
[1:08:07] you'll do better next time now
[1:08:10] he rejected it then he came right back
[1:08:12] and said now if you do like your brother
[1:08:17] then it'll be accepted yes sir
[1:08:22] now i'm talking about the lord's will
[1:08:25] cain didn't care about the lord's will
[1:08:27] that's right right
[1:08:30] right all he cared about is what he had
[1:08:33] in his mind
[1:08:34] of what he thought god wanted and here
[1:08:37] it is god telling him i don't want that
[1:08:41] but in his mind you should have accepted
[1:08:43] what i gave you
[1:08:46] and his countenance failed and he became
[1:08:49] wrong
[1:08:50] to the point to where his father led him
[1:08:54] to kill abel
[1:08:57] why over jealousy yes
[1:09:02] so as we can see here that's a
[1:09:05] characteristic
[1:09:06] one of the characteristics
[1:09:10] i hate to say it in that way lord have
[1:09:12] mercy
[1:09:15] he was the seed of the serpent right
[1:09:20] and it wasn't within him even after
[1:09:23] god's will was made
[1:09:24] plain he still couldn't accept it
[1:09:28] that's right he held to his own way
[1:09:33] right that's
[1:09:36] tough but it happens all the time
[1:09:41] people come to church they hear the word
[1:09:43] of god
[1:09:44] they hear god's will being communicated
[1:09:47] yes
[1:09:48] you can't get no more pure than that god
[1:09:51] himself stood there and told cain what
[1:09:54] like we was talking that was god
[1:09:58] i mean you were thinking of god talk to
[1:10:00] somebody
[1:10:01] they may not bring about some kind of a
[1:10:03] change and it would be an
[1:10:04] immediate agreement but he was able to
[1:10:06] stand in the face of god
[1:10:08] and in his in his heart disagree
[1:10:12] and walk away
[1:10:16] i don't want your will you should have
[1:10:19] took what i wanted to give you
[1:10:24] so here james is addressing that spirit
[1:10:29] the kind of a spirit that just want to
[1:10:32] go and just do whatever it feels to do
[1:10:35] all right all right good and not
[1:10:38] consider his maker
[1:10:40] and he addresses it and corrects it he
[1:10:42] says now what you should say
[1:10:44] is if the lord's will
[1:10:47] then we'll do this or that you don't
[1:10:50] dictate to god
[1:10:51] how to let your day or your year or
[1:10:53] whatever to go back
[1:10:55] you ain't in control like that we're not
[1:10:57] in control like that
[1:11:03] you know what it's been time saints
[1:11:06] where
[1:11:10] my wife my wife we needed a car
[1:11:15] and man she had a certain car in mind
[1:11:17] back then she was into many things
[1:11:20] and oh man she wanted a honda odyssey oh
[1:11:23] uh huh yeah i wasn't looking at hondas
[1:11:26] and whatever you know
[1:11:27] and i'm i'm just in neutral because i'm
[1:11:30] like we need a car
[1:11:33] and i'm praying i'm like lord help us
[1:11:36] i'm like lord
[1:11:37] not to say she wasn't praying but this
[1:11:38] was this is where i was
[1:11:40] like lord just lead us to the vehicle
[1:11:42] that you would have us to have
[1:11:44] because i know that if this if this the
[1:11:46] vehicle that you choose for us
[1:11:48] it'll be the best vehicle for us it'll
[1:11:50] serve us well
[1:11:52] that was my mind it would be nice to
[1:11:55] have an odyssey lord
[1:11:58] but whatever vehicle you choose
[1:12:01] so low and behold the lord allowed us to
[1:12:04] receive a vehicle through a brother
[1:12:07] who had a dealership at that time he
[1:12:10] went to the auction and he found us a
[1:12:12] vehicle
[1:12:14] it was a nice little clean vehicle but
[1:12:17] it wasn't a honda odyssey
[1:12:20] and the brother he brought it to us and
[1:12:22] whatever and it was something that we
[1:12:24] never would have thought of
[1:12:26] but it was it was well kept it was owned
[1:12:29] by a marketing company
[1:12:31] so the maintenance and everything was up
[1:12:33] on it or whatever man it was running
[1:12:35] like a like a sewing machine
[1:12:37] everything was clean and in shape you
[1:12:39] know and i'm looking i'm like well at
[1:12:41] least it's clean
[1:12:43] and it ain't run down it was well kept
[1:12:46] so then it was time for my wife to come
[1:12:48] and see it
[1:12:49] and i could tell about how she
[1:12:51] approached it
[1:12:53] she wasn't feeling that man it was a
[1:12:56] plymouth voyager
[1:12:58] she and she was she got in and i'm
[1:13:00] looking at her
[1:13:01] and she got out and she looked at me she
[1:13:03] said you like this
[1:13:07] i said well sweetie for the money that
[1:13:08] we had
[1:13:10] you know i'm just i don't
[1:13:13] seem like we need to go with it you know
[1:13:15] and that van
[1:13:16] served us well it took us places
[1:13:20] i drove to go preach and all i mean
[1:13:24] it served us well yeah yeah you know
[1:13:27] so obviously that was god's will it
[1:13:30] didn't come in a form
[1:13:32] shape or name brand that that may have
[1:13:34] been desired
[1:13:36] but he gave us what he wanted us to have
[1:13:39] you understand what i'm saying so
[1:13:41] meaning when we
[1:13:42] when we pray we have to be able to be
[1:13:45] satisfied
[1:13:47] with whatever god brings to us
[1:13:50] we need listen it's okay to have a
[1:13:53] desire to have a certain thing or
[1:13:54] whatever
[1:13:55] a certain career or whatever the case
[1:13:57] might be but we need to be able to be
[1:13:59] neutral enough
[1:14:01] and tender enough to say well lord
[1:14:03] however you choose to come
[1:14:07] let your will be done and not mine
[1:14:10] hallelujah now i've seen god give me my
[1:14:13] desire over the years on many occasions
[1:14:16] i didn't i was surprised i was like lord
[1:14:20] you you were okay with let me have this
[1:14:24] that's how i felt i'm like man god you
[1:14:26] you really thought about me
[1:14:28] and you you gave me the desire of my
[1:14:30] heart
[1:14:32] but see it's growth
[1:14:35] there are certain times and stages and
[1:14:37] phases in our life
[1:14:38] where god has to teach us things
[1:14:42] he has to help us to devalue sir he has
[1:14:44] to help certain things to become
[1:14:46] devalued in our minds
[1:14:48] he had to bring me to a place from from
[1:14:51] living a lifestyle
[1:14:52] of of just going after what i wanted to
[1:14:55] be humbled
[1:14:58] and being able to be content yeah
[1:15:02] now that's a chord right there guarding
[1:15:04] this with contentment is great game
[1:15:12] that's the that's the grooming of a
[1:15:14] child of god that's growing up to be
[1:15:16] placed
[1:15:18] that goes in many different directions
[1:15:20] there
[1:15:22] yes
[1:15:28] so now
[1:15:39] matthew 26
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:43] all right we all know that jesus christ
[1:15:47] amen was god and flesh right
[1:15:50] yeah it was the fullness of the godhead
[1:15:52] body
[1:15:53] according to the scriptures right
[1:15:56] yeah but even though he was who he was
[1:15:59] he was 100
[1:16:00] god but how many realized he also was
[1:16:02] 100
[1:16:03] man yes sir minus the fallen
[1:16:08] parts of a man right
[1:16:11] yet he was a man so watch this matthew
[1:16:14] 26
[1:16:15] and verse 35 says peter said unto him
[1:16:17] though i should die
[1:16:18] with though i should die with thee yet
[1:16:20] will i not deny thee likewise also said
[1:16:23] all the disciples
[1:16:25] then come of jesus with them unto a
[1:16:27] place called gethsemane
[1:16:29] and saith unto the disciples set ye here
[1:16:31] while i go yonder and pray
[1:16:33] and he took with him peter and the two
[1:16:35] sons of zebedee and began to be
[1:16:37] sorrowful and very heavy
[1:16:39] then saith he unto them my soul is
[1:16:41] exceeding sorrowful
[1:16:43] even unto death tarry ye hear and watch
[1:16:45] with me
[1:16:46] and he went a little further and fell on
[1:16:48] his face and prayed saying wash their
[1:16:50] saints
[1:16:53] oh my father if it be possible
[1:16:57] let this cup pass from
[1:17:04] what was he talking about there was
[1:17:06] something he was getting ready to face
[1:17:09] right that cup is a divine lot
[1:17:12] whether favorable or unfavorable
[1:17:16] right we got to take whatever god
[1:17:18] ordained for us
[1:17:22] if you left it up to me i wouldn't have
[1:17:24] experienced no hardships
[1:17:26] no strains no frustrations it would have
[1:17:29] been on the fly bed of ease
[1:17:32] yes sir i wouldn't no trouble
[1:17:38] if it was up to me but had i had my way
[1:17:42] i wouldn't out there would be no growth
[1:17:46] there will be no maturity amen
[1:17:53] so god don't let us have our way like
[1:17:55] that he he sets things within our course
[1:17:57] and our
[1:17:58] path that's specifically designed for
[1:18:00] you and i
[1:18:02] things that you you you you would if you
[1:18:04] could go around
[1:18:06] right
[1:18:09] but he don't give you a choice
[1:18:12] but yet there are choices
[1:18:18] as in this case he could have walked
[1:18:20] clean away from gethsemane
[1:18:22] he could have walked clean away from
[1:18:24] calvary but
[1:18:26] because he was who he was he subjected
[1:18:29] himself to his own word
[1:18:32] praise the lord amen and even though now
[1:18:35] he
[1:18:36] he's actually crying in this now he's
[1:18:38] saying if it'd be possible let this cup
[1:18:40] pass
[1:18:41] his own words
[1:18:45] now he did that
[1:18:48] what about you and i yeah
[1:18:51] we go through things i'm sure
[1:18:54] even as young people it's thoughts and
[1:18:57] things you're growing up
[1:18:59] there's thoughts that you you consider
[1:19:01] in your life
[1:19:02] which way your life is gonna go you know
[1:19:05] and you don't know
[1:19:07] you have desires though you see but a
[1:19:10] characteristic to me of a son or
[1:19:12] daughter of god
[1:19:13] that they can have desires there's
[1:19:14] nothing wrong with that
[1:19:16] but over the top of that what caps that
[1:19:18] off is what he said here
[1:19:22] he says let this cup pass from me
[1:19:24] nevertheless
[1:19:27] not as i will but as thou wilt
[1:19:33] hey man that's the that's the best thing
[1:19:35] we can do because now lord i'm letting
[1:19:37] you know what my desire is
[1:19:39] but at the same time you have a will
[1:19:41] that i'm not aware of
[1:19:44] in this case christ knew what the will
[1:19:46] of the father was
[1:19:48] because he told the disciples ahead of
[1:19:50] time
[1:19:51] isn't that right he was the word he knew
[1:19:55] right isn't that something even annoying
[1:19:58] yeah yeah realizing what it is he was
[1:20:00] going to have to go through
[1:20:02] it still caused him the strain
[1:20:06] and the pressure it caused him to ask
[1:20:09] just if it be possible
[1:20:12] but he knew it wasn't possible right
[1:20:16] so he humbled himself yes sir let thy
[1:20:18] will be done
[1:20:20] and not mine amen amen
[1:20:24] in the sight of god saints that's so
[1:20:26] precious
[1:20:29] because like again if you're not in the
[1:20:30] will of god what do you have
[1:20:32] where are you going you spinning your
[1:20:35] wheels
[1:20:36] your life is nothing right
[1:20:43] amen yes lord i like that
[1:20:46] praise the lord amen
[1:20:52] proverbs 3 and verse 5 says trust in the
[1:20:55] lord
[1:20:56] with all thine heart he says and lean
[1:20:59] not unto thine
[1:21:00] own understanding yeah yeah
[1:21:03] in james they were leaning upon their
[1:21:06] own understanding
[1:21:09] you understand how they felt things
[1:21:12] should go
[1:21:13] how many realize that don't matter i
[1:21:16] mean
[1:21:16] it's okay i mean you you're human we're
[1:21:18] half phil i think this should go this
[1:21:20] way
[1:21:20] okay that's right but just know that god
[1:21:22] has a will
[1:21:24] and if it don't go that way just just be
[1:21:26] ready to be all right with that
[1:21:29] i thought my life was going to go a
[1:21:30] certain way
[1:21:32] right i wouldn't have been here had it
[1:21:34] going the way that i thought
[1:21:36] yes when i got out of the military
[1:21:38] saying i'll be i was being offered 100
[1:21:41] 000 a year jobs
[1:21:47] but you know what kept me from going out
[1:21:48] this is at a time where
[1:21:50] the lord had caught my attention but i
[1:21:52] hadn't really
[1:21:53] to me come so far yet with him i was
[1:21:56] still like a toddler
[1:21:58] yeah no not even a toddler probably
[1:22:01] about spiritually speaking by the age of
[1:22:03] your son
[1:22:04] i was a baby you understand what i'm
[1:22:06] saying but yet it was something that was
[1:22:08] in my heart
[1:22:09] and then the only thing that kept me
[1:22:11] from taking a job
[1:22:13] is i considered my family and the fact
[1:22:15] that the job was going to keep me away
[1:22:17] from everything
[1:22:18] for at least three weeks out of every
[1:22:20] month
[1:22:22] i thought about church because the lord
[1:22:24] had just started dealing with my heart i
[1:22:26] thought about my family
[1:22:27] and there was a decision that was made
[1:22:29] that i didn't even i didn't even know
[1:22:31] but because of where my heart was
[1:22:35] because i was considering god
[1:22:38] he led me into his will
[1:22:43] listen now his will at that time
[1:22:46] led me to less money
[1:22:53] his will at that time kept me from
[1:22:55] getting
[1:22:57] the most up-to-date car brand new off
[1:23:00] the line
[1:23:03] the 200 000 house his will kept me from
[1:23:07] that but guess what
[1:23:08] for some reason somehow i was all right
[1:23:12] when i finally got the next job that i
[1:23:14] was going to get and i got my first
[1:23:16] check
[1:23:16] i'm beyond i said man i made a mistake
[1:23:20] it's a little bit of money
[1:23:24] but yet i stayed and i worked
[1:23:28] not knowing he had a ministry
[1:23:31] i had to say that i had to go to brother
[1:23:33] anderson's
[1:23:35] amen why he saw something ahead ahead of
[1:23:38] me
[1:23:39] that i didn't see my i couldn't see
[1:23:41] myself
[1:23:43] but by his grace and i'ma say it in that
[1:23:45] way because it was only by his grace
[1:23:47] that he helped me
[1:23:48] to humble myself to the inspiration of
[1:23:51] his spirit
[1:23:53] to make the right decision to stay there
[1:23:57] because from that decision now i was
[1:23:59] able to move into the furthering of what
[1:24:01] he had for me
[1:24:03] hallelujah and i can honestly say where
[1:24:06] i am right now
[1:24:08] is worth more than any any amount of
[1:24:10] money
[1:24:12] i could have ever made
[1:24:17] glory trust in the lord with all thine
[1:24:21] heart and lean not unto thine own
[1:24:23] understanding but he says in all thy
[1:24:26] ways acknowledge him
[1:24:27] there is power in prayer
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:33] the lord was emphasizing that to me
[1:24:35] while i was in that room back there
[1:24:37] tonight
[1:24:39] some things that were upon my heart and
[1:24:41] i was just praying
[1:24:42] i was praying before we left the room i
[1:24:44] got here i continued to pray
[1:24:46] and just praying i didn't even know what
[1:24:47] to preach tonight
[1:24:50] but before i left the will of the lord
[1:24:53] came across my heart
[1:24:55] but i just wasn't sure so i continued to
[1:24:58] pray
[1:24:59] and even even i thought about brother
[1:25:00] branham brother branham said if he
[1:25:02] wanted to find the will of god he said
[1:25:03] this is what he did
[1:25:04] he said he prayed about it and then he
[1:25:08] said he would get up and he would see
[1:25:09] which way his heart was leaning
[1:25:12] he said then he'll wait and go and pray
[1:25:14] some more
[1:25:17] and then he'll come up he'll come up
[1:25:18] again and he'll see which way his heart
[1:25:20] is leaning and then he'll begin to take
[1:25:22] steps in that way
[1:25:24] that's how i felt tonight concerning
[1:25:25] this message
[1:25:28] and as i got up from prayer brother
[1:25:30] jesse was up here
[1:25:31] and he began to speak about the will of
[1:25:38] god
[1:25:40] so many different directions sayings i
[1:25:43] know you're following me we're not going
[1:25:45] to be much longer
[1:25:52] okay
[1:25:57] there are situations where
[1:26:01] um and this is this is kind of
[1:26:07] uh tough here
[1:26:13] there are places that the bible talks
[1:26:15] about a certain
[1:26:18] uh group
[1:26:21] a certain group of people they're people
[1:26:24] of the world
[1:26:25] right they they live by the spirit of
[1:26:27] the world
[1:26:28] right and the spirit of the world is the
[1:26:30] spirit of satan
[1:26:32] right these people can care less
[1:26:36] about anything concerning god's will all
[1:26:39] they know
[1:26:40] is just their world and and them
[1:26:44] you know everybody calling themselves a
[1:26:45] god now
[1:26:48] you know people of the world they don't
[1:26:49] adopted that you know
[1:26:51] you know i'm a god i'm a king i'm a
[1:26:54] queen
[1:26:56] who called you that it's
[1:26:59] self-proclamation
[1:27:01] it's what it is amen god has real kings
[1:27:04] and queens
[1:27:05] amen kings and priests the bible calls
[1:27:07] us right right
[1:27:08] amen but yet the world that's just how
[1:27:11] they are by the nature that's inside of
[1:27:13] them
[1:27:14] you know they're doing the lust of their
[1:27:16] father right
[1:27:18] but notice how the bible talks about
[1:27:20] this group right
[1:27:22] you know i'm an end on this because
[1:27:25] i i don't believe this is among us
[1:27:29] but yet this is a part of god's word
[1:27:30] pertaining to this subject here
[1:27:33] it says in in in romans chapter 16 and
[1:27:36] verse 17
[1:27:38] it says now beseech you brother and mark
[1:27:41] them which cause divisions and offenses
[1:27:43] contrary to the doctrine
[1:27:45] which ye have learned and avoid them it
[1:27:48] says for they
[1:27:49] that are such notice how he says this
[1:27:52] for they that are such
[1:27:53] serve not our lord jesus christ
[1:27:58] they're religious right right
[1:28:01] they actually think they're serving god
[1:28:04] how many really that's how demons work
[1:28:06] demons had demons have people worshiping
[1:28:09] them
[1:28:10] but the demon deceives the person into
[1:28:12] thinking they're worshiping god
[1:28:16] the demon don't say you know i'm a demon
[1:28:18] deceiving you right
[1:28:20] think how i talk it comes across as
[1:28:23] though it's god
[1:28:31] now that's very heavy right there
[1:28:34] yeah that's very that's real it's a sad
[1:28:38] truth
[1:28:40] yes how it says this now
[1:28:44] for such he says he says they he says
[1:28:47] they that are such
[1:28:48] serve not our lord jesus christ notice
[1:28:51] what it says
[1:28:52] but their own belly
[1:28:57] now that's not talking about them going
[1:28:59] to eat a bunch of food
[1:29:02] amen that's actually talking about
[1:29:06] the seed of their desire
[1:29:09] know what's in their soul what they lust
[1:29:12] after
[1:29:13] yeah yeah you see they're anointed with
[1:29:16] evil spirits right
[1:29:18] and those evil spirits give them
[1:29:19] cravings
[1:29:23] so when it says here notice this it says
[1:29:26] they serve
[1:29:27] not our lord jesus christ but their own
[1:29:30] belly
[1:29:31] it says and by good words and fair
[1:29:35] speeches deceive
[1:29:37] the hearts of the simple so you can take
[1:29:40] this setting saints and you can place it
[1:29:42] within
[1:29:43] false religions yes right
[1:29:47] jesus said himself he said you are of
[1:29:50] your father the devil and his lusts
[1:29:54] right yes
[1:29:58] they were serving their own deadlies an
[1:30:01] evil spirit anointing them
[1:30:03] taking them off course all focus all
[1:30:05] focus of the real and the right thing
[1:30:08] to now worship satan and become
[1:30:11] yous and representatives used by him and
[1:30:14] representatives for him
[1:30:17] praise the lord sir here's another
[1:30:20] scripture that captures this
[1:30:22] it's in philippians chapter three
[1:30:27] starting at verse 17. it says brethren
[1:30:31] be followers together of me
[1:30:33] and mark them which walk as walk so as
[1:30:37] ye have us for us and on a sample or an
[1:30:40] example
[1:30:41] in verse 18 watch how it says this it
[1:30:44] says for many walk
[1:30:46] of whom i have told you often and now
[1:30:48] tell you even weeping
[1:30:50] that they are the enemies of the cross
[1:30:52] of christ
[1:30:54] he says whose end is destruction notice
[1:30:57] how it says this now
[1:30:58] it says whose god is their
[1:31:01] belly
[1:31:06] and whose glory is in their shame who do
[1:31:09] mind earthly things
[1:31:13] they become accustomed to and their
[1:31:15] lives are constantly
[1:31:17] being the course of their lives are
[1:31:19] being dictated by a wrong spirit
[1:31:23] causing them to be self-focused
[1:31:27] seemingly but they don't realize they're
[1:31:29] actually
[1:31:30] worshiping a devil about they're serving
[1:31:32] an evil spirit
[1:31:35] what does that evil spirit make them do
[1:31:37] go after everything
[1:31:38] but the will of god
[1:31:42] king was serving his own belly right
[1:31:45] yes how many understand
[1:31:49] yeah what was that it was the desire
[1:31:52] of the spirit that was dominating him
[1:31:55] yes sir yes sir amen
[1:31:58] but the grace of god came
[1:32:01] in and set me on course amen
[1:32:04] the bible says be transformed by the
[1:32:06] renewing of your mind
[1:32:08] as i said as a child receptive
[1:32:12] to the word of god that i didn't
[1:32:13] understand but yet something on the
[1:32:15] inside of me helped me to embrace it
[1:32:18] amen i was being transformed i began to
[1:32:21] be changed
[1:32:22] by the renewing of my mind
[1:32:27] to now come and be introduced to the
[1:32:29] things of god amen and
[1:32:31] and by the grace of god be able to begin
[1:32:33] to understand the things of god
[1:32:36] and as i humble myself through his
[1:32:38] spirit
[1:32:39] he continued to feed me and feed me and
[1:32:42] give me strength and give me strength
[1:32:44] and help me to grow up
[1:32:47] and i still got more growing
[1:32:51] i ain't there yet now but i'm i'm on my
[1:32:54] way i i'm not that man no more
[1:32:57] that man is i don't left him behind
[1:33:00] amen i'm a new man we are we are new we
[1:33:04] are new creatures in christ isn't that
[1:33:06] right
[1:33:07] we can feel it we know it yes
[1:33:10] we ain't the same ones the devil tried
[1:33:12] to pull us back he tried to toy with our
[1:33:14] thoughts
[1:33:14] try to make us seem like there's not
[1:33:16] much progress that's been made that's a
[1:33:18] lie
[1:33:19] right god has done a great work amen and
[1:33:22] he's continue he's here right now
[1:33:24] in this service he's doing a great work
[1:33:26] right now
[1:33:29] for for the children when you eat good
[1:33:32] things
[1:33:34] do you feel it going through your body
[1:33:37] no you taste it with your mouth as you
[1:33:39] eat it
[1:33:40] but then once it goes in you don't feel
[1:33:42] it going through your body and
[1:33:44] giving you the things you stand in need
[1:33:46] of or whatever that's how it is when it
[1:33:48] comes to the word of god
[1:33:50] we receive it we take it in and you may
[1:33:52] not feel anything going on at that time
[1:33:54] but believe me
[1:33:55] something is happening amen hey man
[1:33:58] whether you can feel it or not that
[1:34:00] don't mean it ain't moving
[1:34:02] that don't mean it's not supplying amen
[1:34:04] that don't mean it's not
[1:34:05] causing things to take place listen even
[1:34:08] as we sit here now all types of things
[1:34:10] are happening in the spiritual realm
[1:34:15] there's a place i see it i'm looking
[1:34:18] right at it
[1:34:20] there's a place that god is calling us
[1:34:22] to
[1:34:23] amen we're just now scratching the
[1:34:26] surface
[1:34:27] amen amen there are
[1:34:30] there are things among us right now
[1:34:32] among us right here in this church
[1:34:34] that have yet to surface yes sir yes sir
[1:34:37] but god is positioning us he's dealing
[1:34:40] with us he's helping us to surrender
[1:34:44] how many can feel that i know i'm not
[1:34:47] i ain't the only one i know what i i can
[1:34:50] when i
[1:34:51] was fellowshipping today brother i felt
[1:34:53] god
[1:34:56] i felt the presence of god he was
[1:34:58] pleased
[1:35:00] he's moving he's doing things now the
[1:35:03] devil to come to us and say you know
[1:35:04] ain't nothing much happening you know
[1:35:06] ain't nothing going on in the church all
[1:35:08] that's lies
[1:35:10] amen he want us to believe that so that
[1:35:13] we can now
[1:35:14] listen to him and become depressed
[1:35:18] amen and distracted
[1:35:21] and listen miss the simplicity of god
[1:35:26] there's things i prayed about saints and
[1:35:28] god has to stop me
[1:35:31] and help me to begin to see amen listen
[1:35:34] the glimpse of his movie
[1:35:37] in my children it's things that i've
[1:35:40] been praying about it and there's things
[1:35:41] happening right there
[1:35:43] and god got to stop me and show me you
[1:35:45] see that right there
[1:35:48] that's what you pray for right it's not
[1:35:51] the fullness of it
[1:35:52] but he's showing me his movement he's
[1:35:54] moving
[1:35:56] he's moving upon our prayer saints
[1:35:59] because the bible actually lets us know
[1:36:04] i'm gonna look this scripture up and i'm
[1:36:05] gonna let you all go for tonight
[1:36:07] amen i want to read this scripture to
[1:36:10] you
[1:36:14] and it goes right along with the message
[1:36:18] by the grace of god
[1:36:25] philippians chapter 2
[1:36:37] where are we at i just had it yeah here
[1:36:39] we go
[1:36:40] all right it says in verse 13.
[1:36:49] it says for it is god
[1:36:52] right it says for it is god which
[1:36:55] worketh in you
[1:36:56] notice this now the bible says if
[1:37:00] we ask anything according to his will
[1:37:04] it says he heareth us yeah isn't that
[1:37:06] right
[1:37:08] now you want to see how perfect this
[1:37:10] thing is i mean it's like
[1:37:12] god has made this thing in such a way
[1:37:14] right
[1:37:15] notice how he no no doesn't notice how
[1:37:17] the script the scripture says for it is
[1:37:19] god which
[1:37:19] worketh in you both to will
[1:37:26] so god actually puts his will in our
[1:37:28] hearts
[1:37:30] how did they know what to offer
[1:37:34] what did he do to find that out
[1:37:37] go back and read and tell me tell me
[1:37:39] what did abel do to find out
[1:37:41] what to offer to god
[1:37:56] what did he do it was put into his heart
[1:38:02] amen god injected his will into abel's
[1:38:05] heart
[1:38:08] so how are we going to know the will of
[1:38:09] god
[1:38:12] in the same exact way you ain't got
[1:38:14] gonna work nothing up
[1:38:16] you ain't got to go overboard with
[1:38:18] anything just be yourself
[1:38:21] be sincere make sure your motive and
[1:38:24] your objectives are right
[1:38:26] meaning is not selfishness tied into it
[1:38:29] amen you can have a desire pray about a
[1:38:31] desire but yet be satisfied and say lord
[1:38:34] let your will be done and not mine and
[1:38:37] if it's your will lord i'll rejoice in
[1:38:39] you giving me that my desire
[1:38:40] but if it's not your will but even in
[1:38:44] that
[1:38:44] it's still his desire hallelujah
[1:38:47] he just chose to give you something that
[1:38:52] you happen to like praise the lord
[1:38:56] but notice this now it says for it is
[1:38:58] god which worketh in you both to will
[1:39:01] and to do with his good pleasure
[1:39:05] isn't that wonderful
[1:39:08] you ain't got to work for it he just got
[1:39:11] to wait in patience and serve god
[1:39:14] and then consecrate ourselves to god and
[1:39:16] like i said
[1:39:17] god will by his grace allow us to catch
[1:39:19] his mind
[1:39:21] and then ask for his will that he gives
[1:39:24] to us
[1:39:25] he gives us what his will is and then
[1:39:27] haves us
[1:39:28] to actually what his will is
[1:39:32] you can't get no better than that
[1:39:34] hallelujah isn't that right
[1:39:36] yes sir you can't get no better than
[1:39:38] that that whole plan that god got is
[1:39:40] is is top-notch
[1:39:43] hey man it's top-notch saints
[1:39:49] i read there's one quotation here to you
[1:39:52] i got more his saints but i'm trying to
[1:39:54] taper it down
[1:40:03] he says he will give you the desire of
[1:40:06] his heart
[1:40:07] of your heart he says he says he
[1:40:09] promised that
[1:40:10] he says you know that he promised to
[1:40:13] give you the desire of your heart
[1:40:15] he says and let your desire be the word
[1:40:18] of god
[1:40:19] let your desire be his will never your
[1:40:22] own will
[1:40:23] his will he says you ask for him for
[1:40:26] something
[1:40:26] you ask him for something he don't give
[1:40:29] it to you say thank you lord you know
[1:40:31] what's good
[1:40:36] now that's real maturity yes sir amen
[1:40:39] yeah to come to a place to where it's
[1:40:41] not all about you
[1:40:43] but it's all about him that's the only
[1:40:46] thing that matters
[1:40:48] lord let your will be done that's the
[1:40:50] only thing that has life in it that's
[1:40:51] the only thing that counts
[1:40:54] for every one of the days that we live
[1:40:56] upon the earth every hour of the day
[1:40:58] every minute of the day
[1:41:00] and you don't have to constantly go
[1:41:01] around and saying every minute every
[1:41:03] hour lord what's your will what's your
[1:41:04] will what's your will
[1:41:05] you just pray and you just allow
[1:41:08] yourself to be neutral
[1:41:10] like i said don't be selfish but just
[1:41:12] say lord however you want things to be
[1:41:14] just let your will be done
[1:41:17] and that invites his spirit i believe to
[1:41:19] just come down in that sweet anointing
[1:41:22] and just begin to lead you
[1:41:25] i don't always hear a voice you don't
[1:41:28] always know that you're being led
[1:41:30] isn't that right you can be laid and not
[1:41:33] even be aware of it
[1:41:36] isn't that right yes sir
[1:41:39] i was talking to simon about this and i
[1:41:41] got excited
[1:41:43] i'm gonna share this with y'all and i'ma
[1:41:45] stop i promise
[1:41:48] when brother brown
[1:41:52] had that bible that had that
[1:41:57] that page in it that wasn't printed
[1:41:59] exactly right
[1:42:01] i'm gonna walk down this timeline with
[1:42:03] you just for a moment y'all y'all
[1:42:05] with me yeah all right
[1:42:08] so first the lord
[1:42:12] at the printing company the lord caused
[1:42:16] the machine
[1:42:17] to act up while it was printing that
[1:42:21] particular page
[1:42:24] in order for the page not to be right it
[1:42:26] had to happen at the printing company
[1:42:27] right
[1:42:28] listen now he allowed the quality
[1:42:32] inspection department to overlook that
[1:42:35] page
[1:42:37] i work in quality i know how i was
[1:42:38] supposed to go
[1:42:40] huh listen now this is they're just just
[1:42:43] following me because this thing
[1:42:44] i was like lord look at you he allowed
[1:42:47] the quality inspection company
[1:42:49] to miss that page and not even pick it
[1:42:51] up pick up on it
[1:42:52] right so then he allowed that particular
[1:42:56] page to get put into a particular bible
[1:42:58] that was
[1:42:59] going to go into a particular box he
[1:43:02] allowed that box to get shipped to a
[1:43:04] particular store
[1:43:08] did the driver feel led or the packing
[1:43:11] person did they feel led to put it did
[1:43:13] they know they were being led by god
[1:43:16] but listen that particular bible had to
[1:43:18] make it to a certain store
[1:43:20] so god was in control of the whole
[1:43:22] routing of that book
[1:43:24] and then when sister branham had the
[1:43:26] thought to get her husband a new bible
[1:43:28] who gave her that thought
[1:43:33] huh and then when the thought came and
[1:43:36] she left to go look for a bible
[1:43:38] i'm sure there were many other
[1:43:39] bookstores around
[1:43:42] but she was led to go to the store that
[1:43:44] that bible was sent to
[1:43:47] and i'm sure it wasn't just one copy
[1:43:50] there were multiple copies of that same
[1:43:52] bible but when she went into that store
[1:43:55] she was led to go to a certain section
[1:43:57] of the store and go
[1:43:58] to a certain shelf and her eyes went to
[1:44:01] a certain book
[1:44:02] did she feel led not at all
[1:44:07] and she purchased that book and that was
[1:44:10] the very bible that was used
[1:44:12] for christ to be able to come in this
[1:44:14] hour
[1:44:17] and identify himself in a very
[1:44:20] similar way as he did in the scriptures
[1:44:24] when the priest handed him the scroll
[1:44:27] that bible had to be like that because
[1:44:30] when brother branham couldn't find the
[1:44:31] place
[1:44:32] the catholic priest came up and gave him
[1:44:34] his bible
[1:44:38] and even the prophet said in a later
[1:44:41] sermon
[1:44:43] he said that only had he been on his
[1:44:45] toes
[1:44:46] christ was there inside of him
[1:44:48] identifying what
[1:44:50] he was doing right at that moment and
[1:44:52] brother branham wasn't even aware
[1:44:54] of it and he was the one that was being
[1:44:57] used
[1:45:00] right
[1:45:02] boy that make me fool there yeah
[1:45:06] but that's how god is we don't have to
[1:45:09] always be conscious and aware of what
[1:45:10] he's doing
[1:45:11] we're just being led by his grace
[1:45:16] the lord's will the most important thing
[1:45:19] in our lives
[1:45:20] yes sir is this right here yes sir
[1:45:23] you tell me what's more important that's
[1:45:25] right right
[1:45:27] nothing hallelujah nothing
[1:45:30] god bless you saints appreciate your
[1:45:33] patience your time
[1:45:35] and in my heart i feel like the lord's
[1:45:37] will was done tonight
[1:45:40] let's give him a handclap of prayer
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:56] um
[1:45:58] let us stand together if we will
[1:46:03] let us buy our hearts
[1:46:08] and as we're bowing if there's anybody
[1:46:10] that desires prayer
[1:46:12] you're more than welcome to come up
[1:46:17] but understand also that even if you
[1:46:20] come up for a prayer
[1:46:22] you're going to have to believe god for
[1:46:24] whatever it is you're standing in need
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:30] heavenly father
[1:46:34] lord we thank you for bringing us by
[1:46:36] your grace into this place
[1:46:40] this place of understanding the
[1:46:41] importance of knowing

[1:46:46] lord to where we even desire your will
[1:46:50] understanding now father that is that
[1:46:53] put your will into our hearts
[1:46:56] because it's you is that's working
[1:46:58] within us
[1:47:03] such simple things are such powerful
[1:47:06] things
[1:47:08] these are the things lord god that make
[1:47:10] the way for greater things to take place
[1:47:14] these simple things sometimes that we
[1:47:15] overlook father god
[1:47:17] are the very things you you you have
[1:47:19] your eye right on

[1:47:59] efforts are put
[1:48:00] forth to have it hidden the bullseye
[1:48:04] hitting the target lord what greater
[1:48:06] thing it is
[1:48:07] than that to us there's nothing greater

[1:48:50] of the many presumptions maybe that
