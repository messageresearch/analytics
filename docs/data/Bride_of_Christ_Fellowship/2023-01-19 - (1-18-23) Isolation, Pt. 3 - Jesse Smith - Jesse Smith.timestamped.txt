[0:00] verse Luke 22 28.
[0:07] 22-28
[0:13] I like to look at isolation again
[0:16] tonight also with this with thought of
[0:18] Temptations
[0:19] and trials you know as I said earlier
[0:27] and even last Wednesday you know we said
[0:29] God
[0:30] will give us
[0:32] inspiration before we come up to a
[0:34] Temptation right before we come into a
[0:36] trial give us inspiration to pray
[0:38] seek my face don't let up on your
[0:40] Devotion to God how many believe that
[0:43] Hallelujah
[0:44] Luke 22.
[0:46] 28.
[0:49] if we can let's read that on three
[0:50] whenever you're there by God's grace
[0:54] Hallelujah
[0:56] of course this is the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:58] speaking and what a beautiful
[1:00] expression here right before he's
[1:02] arrested and before he's crucified
[1:05] let's read this on three one two three
[1:07] ye are they which have continued with me
[1:11] in my Temptations amen my God has his
[1:14] Blessing to read his word you may be
[1:15] seated praise God
[1:23] Hallelujah so I want to take a few
[1:25] moments here and preach this thought
[1:28] this is a thought I really didn't get to
[1:29] last week I won the I thought maybe I
[1:32] get here but I will pick up right here
[1:33] by God's grace and
[1:35] I truly believe you know the holy
[1:36] spirit's been speaking to us here and
[1:39] you know we were prepared last week for
[1:41] these last few months rather probably
[1:43] for this season of Our Lives you know
[1:46] and we're trusting in God you know he's
[1:48] faithful
[1:49] like he's faithful in summer he's also
[1:51] faithful winter
[1:52] you know we go through trials he's
[1:54] faithful in the midst of these storms
[1:56] and we just got to have confidence we
[1:57] just got to praise him in the storm
[1:59] there's a song the kids like to sing at
[2:01] Arrowhead and it's a song like that I
[2:03] will Praise You In This Storm I think
[2:05] who sings that
[2:07] Casting Crowns I Praise You In This
[2:08] Storm there's another song they like to
[2:10] sing in the eye of the storm
[2:12] you remain in control
[2:14] you guide my soul in the midst of the
[2:16] storm it's just a beautiful song so we
[2:18] know God is faithful he's worthy of all
[2:20] praise Hallelujah so let's look at a few
[2:22] thoughts here I just want to review that
[2:24] you know that definition of isolation it
[2:27] means set apart from others quarantined
[2:30] um and I think this one here applies to
[2:32] every believer
[2:34] you know to select from among others to
[2:38] separate from another substance so as to
[2:40] obtain pure
[2:41] or you know I'm sorry to obtain pure
[2:45] or in a free state
[2:47] Church Jesus wants to make us pure
[2:49] praise God as we saw last week you know
[2:51] there was three simple illustrations of
[2:54] how God will isolate himself he'll pull
[2:56] back his presence in order to test us
[2:59] and each time it shows that we need him
[3:01] more
[3:03] with Hezekiah job and David each time
[3:06] God left them
[3:08] for a small season and each time it
[3:10] exposed what was in their heart
[3:12] right
[3:13] and so we saw that how God does that and
[3:16] what does he do it makes us you know see
[3:18] our our sinful side even more but that
[3:22] brings us to what it brought job to
[3:24] repentance
[3:25] and a hating of our flesh right the as
[3:27] far as the nature of our flesh
[3:30] the sinful nature inside of our our
[3:32] members the Bible says
[3:33] so each time you know God pulls himself
[3:35] back you know we're exposed to our own
[3:37] Humanity uh we're left to our our we'd
[3:40] say our
[3:42] we're left to our fleshly desires and
[3:45] the desires of our mind and and we we
[3:46] get a glimpse of what we are without
[3:48] Christ
[3:49] and we find it's not a pretty thing
[3:52] but I love how God is always merciful to
[3:54] come right back and invite us back in
[3:55] the presence of the Lord just like he
[3:57] did with Joe we come down here and then
[3:59] he said you he said you three friends
[4:01] need to pray for him he's my prophet
[4:03] and how God brought David back and he
[4:05] could go into the house of God and
[4:06] repent and sing songs and write a new
[4:08] song that we still sing today praise God
[4:11] restore the joy of my salvation praise
[4:14] God what a beautiful what a beautiful
[4:15] song that come out of such difficult
[4:17] trial
[4:18] such a difficult such an awful the very
[4:21] depths of sin and wickedness and yet a
[4:23] beauty can come out of Ashes amen
[4:25] hallelujah praise God just a beautiful
[4:27] picture God's story of redemption God's
[4:30] story of Grace
[4:31] Hallelujah these times of isolation they
[4:33] are necessary for all of us
[4:36] if they're necessary for job and
[4:38] Hezekiah and David they're certainly
[4:40] necessary for us
[4:42] that we can see our Humanity we can see
[4:44] what what really what we're made of in
[4:47] the in the in the mind and the flesh but
[4:48] then also cry out to God and say God
[4:50] make me more like you praise God created
[4:53] me a clean heart Hallelujah try me again
[4:55] transform my mind again Hallelujah
[4:57] make me more pure hallelujah amen
[4:59] hallelujah isolate me unto yourself
[5:01] praise God let me have isolation with
[5:03] you praise God
[5:05] Hallelujah the Bible says
[5:07] the Bible says he's knocking and said
[5:09] let uh let him that open that Hearth
[5:11] open the door and I'll come in and sup
[5:13] with him and he he will step with me
[5:15] what a joy it is to stop with Christ
[5:17] Hallelujah
[5:18] where did Joy to have Christ feed us the
[5:20] Living Word of God
[5:22] when we really need it praise God it's a
[5:25] real blessing and that's the isolation
[5:26] that we love praise God that's a
[5:28] isolation that we need that time alone
[5:30] with the Lord
[5:31] and then you know that first part we
[5:33] looked at how there's three types of
[5:35] isolation maybe more
[5:38] you know and then getting back to
[5:39] Hezekiah you know God left him for a
[5:41] season and and showed his pride you know
[5:43] showed his pride David showed his
[5:45] passions right uh
[5:47] uh and who's the other one David oh Joe
[5:49] Joe has showed his pride as well
[5:52] job thought he was more righteous than
[5:54] God
[5:55] and so with each one you know each time
[5:57] each believer is tested but the Bible
[6:00] calls that a fiery trial of our faith
[6:02] and that's more precious to us than gold
[6:04] or silver
[6:05] what a wonderful thing God does allow us
[6:08] to go through trials brother said that's
[6:09] the greatest thing that ever happened to
[6:11] you was the test
[6:12] the test of your faith is the greatest
[6:14] thing that ever happened to you because
[6:16] you'll come forth as gold Hallelujah
[6:19] and so God isolates or I'm sorry
[6:21] sometimes we isolate ourselves by our
[6:22] sins we isolate uh God isolates himself
[6:26] to a degree to test us
[6:28] or we're in constant or deep Fellowship
[6:31] isolated with God in that secret place
[6:35] right and then last week we looked at
[6:36] you know one of these uh and I added you
[6:39] know some personal names up here of
[6:40] course just to remind us here what I was
[6:42] saying here
[6:43] you know last week's message was two
[6:44] days before Lee passed away two days
[6:48] and then you know uh
[6:50] a couple days you know before brother
[6:52] amen got sick you know I was he was over
[6:54] at my house and he was just he's saying
[6:56] this is the year of Miracles this is the
[6:57] year of Miracles I believe God's gonna
[6:59] do great things
[7:00] and I believe that too how many believe
[7:01] that by God's grace
[7:03] but we find ourselves where do we find
[7:05] ourselves in the midst of a trial now
[7:07] let's have the right kind of faith in
[7:09] the midst of a trial praise God God's
[7:11] allowed it God's not surprised by these
[7:13] things no
[7:14] no God brought to us and he even
[7:16] prepared us with a message for praise
[7:17] God last week
[7:19] in the midst of this trial we got to
[7:21] call out to him praise God we've got to
[7:22] reach out to him in the midst of our
[7:23] trials because he's faithful praise God
[7:25] God is faithful Hallelujah so we're
[7:28] either approaching one
[7:30] we're in the midst of it the fiery trial
[7:33] of our faith or we're hedged from the
[7:35] trial or Temptation and some you know
[7:38] and some you know each one you can find
[7:40] where you are praise God if I believe as
[7:42] a church I believe we're probably right
[7:44] in here because the Bible commands us
[7:46] not just to to pray for others but to
[7:49] Bear one another's burdens
[7:52] to Bear them so think how can we bear
[7:54] our brothers burdens how can we bear our
[7:57] our sisters burdens praise God that's
[7:59] what we are called to do in this hour
[8:04] now I just want to spend most of my time
[8:05] I don't know how long I'm going to
[8:06] preach tonight it might be rather short
[8:08] and that that might all surprise us but
[8:10] we'll kind of see how it goes uh
[8:13] you know I'm just kind of stuck all day
[8:14] on this you know and not quite sure
[8:16] which way to go till the last few
[8:18] moments but
[8:19] um I just love how Jesus says this he he
[8:21] tells the disciples here in Luke Chapter
[8:23] 22. he says you continued with me in my
[8:26] Temptations I'm going to turn there
[8:27] briefly and read that again
[8:29] 22.
[8:34] now just this is such a beautiful
[8:35] picture here
[8:37] this is at the Last Supper the last time
[8:40] Jesus is with his disciples
[8:42] this is the same night he'd be betrayed
[8:45] in fact Judas had already left
[8:49] right but he takes this moment here
[8:51] after the Passover here he institutes
[8:54] the Lord's Supper he announces his
[8:56] betrayal Judas goes out
[8:59] and then he tells them in verse 25 26
[9:01] and 27 you're not to Lord over one
[9:04] another but you're to be servants one to
[9:07] another
[9:09] he said the Gentiles exercise
[9:11] lordship over one another but it won't
[9:13] be so with real Christians
[9:15] Hallelujah
[9:17] then in verse 28 he says ye are they
[9:20] which have continued with me in my
[9:22] Temptation now look at church
[9:24] look at God orchestrated all the events
[9:26] of Jesus life
[9:29] and think Church Judas went through all
[9:31] those
[9:32] Judas went with through three and a half
[9:34] years with Jesus through his trials but
[9:36] the very last moment he left at the end
[9:39] may God help us to be faithful all the
[9:41] way to the end
[9:43] once Judas leaves that's the moment that
[9:46] Jesus Jesus could say you are the ones
[9:48] that have stayed with me in my
[9:49] Temptations yeah
[9:51] yeah I think it's important to notice
[9:53] that he points out who stayed with him
[9:55] praise God Amen amen thank God
[9:58] hallelujah amen and we want to be those
[10:01] who stay with Christ throughout all of
[10:03] our Temptations praise God
[10:06] I just noticed it's his last time eating
[10:08] with them while they're alive
[10:10] the last meal the last time they have a
[10:12] chance to Fellowship he says I just want
[10:14] to point out you're the ones that have
[10:16] stayed with me this whole time yeah
[10:18] yeah so I want to thank all of our
[10:19] faithful Saints thank you for staying
[10:20] with me all these years
[10:22] and I've stayed with you too amen
[10:24] I haven't left you you haven't left me
[10:25] praise God
[10:27] that's what I like to look at Value
[10:28] sometimes cry I said buddy you stay with
[10:29] me and look at my wife I don't leave out
[10:31] here
[10:33] you stay with me this whole time praise
[10:34] God yeah in the midst of my trials you
[10:37] were with me Lord You prayed for me
[10:40] Hallelujah you're a listening ear
[10:42] you cared Hallelujah aren't you glad
[10:44] Jesus cares about us amen
[10:46] if he cares about us then we definitely
[10:48] care for one another praise God
[10:52] it's just a beautiful portion of
[10:53] scripture here uh
[10:55] he points out some of the last few words
[10:58] now of course this is before he goes
[11:00] over right he crosses over in the Mount
[11:01] of owls and goes to pray before that he
[11:03] makes sure he tells him you're the ones
[11:05] who stayed with me
[11:07] hey George just just look at that Jesus
[11:09] had Temptations as well
[11:13] he was tempted and overcame so that we
[11:16] can be tempted and still overcome
[11:19] the Bible said he no doubt he had to
[11:21] taste death for every one of us aren't
[11:22] you glad he tasted death for you
[11:25] he died the most awful death so you
[11:27] never have to die that death
[11:29] but he also tested every trial and and
[11:32] every every difficulty we could ever
[11:35] have he tasted it right through the lust
[11:37] of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the
[11:39] pride of life
[11:40] he dealt with he he dealt with not just
[11:42] uh we'd say a Temptation he dealt with
[11:45] Satan himself think of that Satan
[11:48] himself
[11:51] like I told you before people that have
[11:52] said dumb devil the people that I've
[11:54] seen say dumb devil have had some awful
[11:56] things happen to them
[11:58] You Don't See Jesus doing that no no
[12:00] Jesus would say it's written
[12:03] Hallelujah
[12:04] I've seen somebody get cancer that said
[12:06] that I'm not connecting all the dots but
[12:08] I'm just saying they got cancer
[12:10] I saw someone there their spouse left
[12:12] him that said that
[12:14] because I I just think it's strange that
[12:17] that would happen like that because you
[12:19] don't want to mock Satan
[12:23] you want to speak the word to Satan
[12:25] praise God
[12:28] but Jesus endured all these Temptations
[12:30] so you and I can overcome all the
[12:32] Temptations
[12:34] he knows what it's like to be tempted
[12:36] with the lust of the flesh he knows what
[12:37] the flesh he knows the feeling of the
[12:39] the flesh craving things it shouldn't
[12:41] have
[12:43] he knows what it's like to overcome the
[12:45] lust of the eyes you know wanting
[12:46] wanting things that he sees but he's got
[12:48] to say no I'm not going to go after that
[12:50] I'm going to go after God's word
[12:53] he knows about the pride of life
[12:56] wanting to make things happen wanting to
[12:59] we want to feel like we're in control
[13:00] but Jesus overcame that Temptation and
[13:03] said God's in control I only do what the
[13:05] father wants me to do
[13:07] Hallelujah
[13:08] and he said you are the ones that come
[13:09] through all my Temptations you're the
[13:11] ones that made it through praise God oh
[13:13] may God help us to make it through the
[13:14] filter praise God the filter the fire
[13:16] the fiery trials amen may God help us to
[13:19] make it through Judas could not make it
[13:21] through
[13:21] money pulled him away let's not let
[13:24] money or lessen the fly uh flesh lust of
[13:26] the eyes of pride of life let us uh lay
[13:29] aside every weight that so easily besend
[13:31] us and let us run the race with
[13:32] perseverance praise God
[13:34] Hallelujah you know John Gill brought
[13:36] got this thought and I just was
[13:38] meditating on it uh he's a preacher from
[13:41] the 1800s well the man said the greatest
[13:43] works of preaching and writing came from
[13:45] that age
[13:47] he said ye are they which have continued
[13:49] with me from the beginning of his
[13:50] ministry to that very time they Abode by
[13:52] him they never departed from him when
[13:54] others withdrew and walk with him no
[13:56] more think about that
[13:57] remember all the multitudes found
[13:59] brother man went through the three
[14:00] stages of Jesus ministry right the
[14:02] healing stage of three poles right right
[14:04] which that just means three phases
[14:07] one of these days I'm going to preach on
[14:08] the three third pole or the three poles
[14:09] and just give you some Bible words for
[14:11] that because you don't you don't see
[14:12] third poll in the Bible it's just a
[14:14] third phase right yeah
[14:15] or a third Ministry a furtherance of the
[14:18] ministry yeah
[14:19] yeah but Jesus was popular at first
[14:21] healing everybody right that's the first
[14:22] pope Hallelujah uh the second Paul
[14:26] uh he started Discerning the thoughts
[14:28] and Tents of their heart right
[14:30] and the last one he started laying down
[14:32] the truth praise God the word of God
[14:33] hallelujah right and so he goes to these
[14:36] three poles and and with each poll less
[14:39] and less people came
[14:41] and brother Ram preaches that he says
[14:42] look at Paul the same thing with Paul
[14:44] big crowds and each time each stage of
[14:46] Paul's Ministry less and less people
[14:53] sure and then he says in my Temptations
[14:56] and I like this thought Gil picked up he
[14:58] said not in the wilderness by Satan see
[15:01] the disciples weren't out there with
[15:02] Satan that was just God that was just
[15:04] God helping the Lord Jesus overcome
[15:06] praise God
[15:08] for they were not within them not being
[15:10] as yet called to be his disciples and
[15:12] followers
[15:13] but in his afflictions by the reproaches
[15:15] the cavils
[15:17] probably not saying that right and
[15:18] ensnaring questions of the scribes and
[15:20] the Pharisees and their attempts upon
[15:21] him to take away his life by stoning Etc
[15:24] which were trials and temptations to him
[15:28] so when Jesus was out in the wilderness
[15:30] that was just him relying on God but
[15:33] then through the three and a half years
[15:34] or the rest of the time of the Ministry
[15:36] Jesus was not alone during that time
[15:38] Jesus had disciples with him Jesus had
[15:41] Fellowship Jesus had his disciples that
[15:44] were there he could talk to he could
[15:46] feel their hugs he could feel their
[15:48] handshakes praise God
[15:50] and Jesus was going to recognize that at
[15:53] the end of his ministry
[15:55] now really really did he have to have
[15:57] them no he didn't have to have him
[16:00] right but it was an example
[16:02] it was an example for us to know that
[16:04] that God doesn't call us to walk alone
[16:06] God gives us a church family praise God
[16:10] God gives us the body of Christ because
[16:12] where would the eye be without the
[16:14] hearing
[16:15] right where would the leg be without the
[16:17] arm
[16:18] we need one another praise God
[16:21] we've got to have each other's support
[16:22] we've got to have each other's prayers
[16:24] Hallelujah
[16:26] we got to have one another praise God
[16:28] and so Jesus gives us this example he
[16:31] had to have those
[16:33] 11 other friends right you know he had
[16:35] to have Judas too but Judas left he had
[16:37] to have those 11 other faithful ones
[16:39] right next to him
[16:40] Hallelujah
[16:43] now here uh Gill gives three
[16:46] uh three kind of descriptions there and
[16:48] let's get your Bible here I'd like to
[16:49] read some of these here
[16:51] I want you to uh just take a maybe a
[16:53] fresh look at this and see
[16:55] you know the actual Temptations where
[16:58] the disciples were right there
[17:01] but yet they stayed by Jesus the whole
[17:03] time
[17:08] Matthew 9 I'll just we'll just go
[17:10] Matthew right in the order Matthew Mark
[17:11] Luke and John here so if you've got your
[17:13] Bible Matthew 9 1-8
[17:25] and he entered into a ship and passed
[17:27] over and came into his own City and
[17:29] behold they brought to him a man sick of
[17:31] the palsy lying on a bed and Jesus
[17:33] seeing their faith I like that Christ
[17:34] sees our faith
[17:36] he sees all of our efforts to get to him
[17:39] praise God
[17:40] and said unto the sick of the palsy son
[17:42] be a good cheer thy sins be forgiven
[17:44] thee and behold certain of the scribes
[17:46] say within themselves this man
[17:47] blasphemeth
[17:49] and Jesus knoweth their thoughts
[17:51] said wherefore think ye evil in your
[17:53] hearts for whether it's easier to say
[17:54] thy sins be forgiven the order to say
[17:56] arise and walk but that ye may know that
[17:58] the son of man hath power on Earth to
[18:00] forgive sins then saith he to the sick
[18:03] of the palsy arise take up thy bed and
[18:05] go into that house
[18:07] and he arose in the party to his house
[18:08] but the multitude saw they marveled and
[18:11] glorified God which had such power uh
[18:15] unto I'm sorry which gave
[18:16] such power unto men
[18:19] praise God now the Bible said Jesus knew
[18:21] their thoughts but no doubt the
[18:22] disciples would have noticed these
[18:24] Pharisees were upset with him
[18:26] and no doubt afterwards they would have
[18:27] said he blasphemed he said he can
[18:30] forgive sins and we know eventually they
[18:31] call him a blasphemer
[18:33] so think about that
[18:35] you're following Christ but everybody
[18:37] else you're in the minority everybody
[18:39] else in the majority is calling your
[18:42] Christ your leader
[18:44] a blasphemer
[18:46] but yet they stayed right with Jesus
[18:48] praise God
[18:50] and what was it was Satan twisting the
[18:52] twisting the thought right Satan just
[18:54] twists this
[18:56] oh he can oh see uh Jesus can't forgive
[18:59] sins he's just a man but they didn't
[19:01] realize he was more than a man
[19:03] Hallelujah
[19:05] right it seemed like they had a
[19:06] scriptural foundation for
[19:08] but they misunderstood Jesus was more
[19:10] than a man he was Emmanuel God With Us
[19:13] hallelujah amen and if he's Emmanuel
[19:15] then he can forgive sins amen
[19:19] but see they stayed there well everybody
[19:21] else calling the blasphemer while he was
[19:23] in the while they were in the minority
[19:24] and the majority spoke against him the
[19:26] majority said evil things the faithful
[19:28] one stood right there in the midst of
[19:29] his Temptations
[19:31] Hallelujah
[19:32] verse 9.
[19:34] and as Jesus passed forth from hence he
[19:36] saw a man named Matthew sitting at the
[19:38] receipt of custom and he said unto him
[19:39] follow me and he rose and followed him
[19:43] and it came to pass it Jesus sat at me
[19:45] in the house behold many Republicans and
[19:46] sinners came and sat down with him and
[19:48] his disciples and when the Pharisees saw
[19:50] it they sent him his unto his disciples
[19:52] why eateth your master Republicans and
[19:54] sinners but when Jesus heard that he
[19:55] said unto them they that be whole need
[19:58] not a physician but they that are sick
[20:00] but go ye and learn what that meaneth I
[20:02] will have mercy and not sacrifice for I
[20:05] am come not to call the righteous but
[20:07] Sinners to repentance praise God
[20:11] so here all the people or all the
[20:14] religious people are saying your your
[20:16] leaders Unholy Your Leader is hanging
[20:19] out with the scum of the earth right
[20:21] right and Jesus says you don't
[20:22] understand what Mercy is Right Mercy
[20:25] goes out to the hurting Mercy goes out
[20:28] to those that are in trouble
[20:31] Mercy he said you haven't learned what
[20:33] Mercy is
[20:35] to see now here's another here's another
[20:37] trial everybody said Jesus is hanging
[20:39] around with sinners he's a blasphemer
[20:42] he's an Unholy man he's a lover of
[20:44] Sinners he's unclean
[20:47] he doesn't respect God's holiness
[20:49] and yet they stayed with him
[20:54] he the other religious people make
[20:56] themselves look more holy
[20:58] but they had a choice to make which side
[21:00] am I going to go
[21:01] you got a choice here tonight too praise
[21:03] God
[21:05] verse 14.
[21:08] then came to him the Disciples of John
[21:10] saying why do we and the Pharisees fast
[21:12] off but thy disciples fast not and Jesus
[21:15] said to them can the children of the
[21:16] Bride
[21:17] chamber more as long as the bridegroom
[21:19] is with them but the days will come when
[21:21] the bridegroom shall be taken from them
[21:22] then shall they fasten now he's accused
[21:25] of he's not as separated as other people
[21:29] right we all know churches that promote
[21:31] 40 days of fasting right
[21:34] and people could look down on us well
[21:35] why haven't you done that
[21:37] well the Bible doesn't necessarily call
[21:39] every person to do that
[21:41] right but see look at Satan just
[21:43] bringing accusation blasphemer Unholy
[21:46] not as devoted not as holy and sacred as
[21:49] other people
[21:50] but the the whole point had to be made
[21:52] who was the word of God who had the
[21:54] revelation of God it was Jesus amen
[21:57] Jesus had the ministry of the hour
[21:59] praise God and that's what we find here
[22:01] that we have the ministry of the hour of
[22:03] Hallelujah
[22:05] let's go to uh or Mark chapter 3.
[22:11] I believe in discipline I believe in
[22:12] these things I believe in dedication
[22:14] Hallelujah
[22:16] I believe in bringing your body into
[22:18] subjection of the word of God
[22:20] but see Satan can try to pervert that
[22:22] Satan can try to make it a pride thing
[22:26] see so each time you have to see what's
[22:28] the word who's got the word where's the
[22:31] true where's the true word of God
[22:32] where's the move of the Holy Spirit
[22:33] praise God
[22:35] remember Jesus said their wash on the
[22:37] outside but inward uh they're dead men's
[22:39] bones
[22:41] they look clean on the outside but
[22:42] inward they're dead men's bones why
[22:44] because they speak against the word of
[22:46] God
[22:47] Mark 3 21.
[22:51] and when his friends heard of it they
[22:52] went out to lay hold on him for they
[22:54] said he is beside himself and the
[22:56] scribes which came down from Jerusalem
[22:58] said he hath to be else above and by the
[23:00] prince of devils cast as he out devils
[23:03] so Jesus had just healed a withered
[23:05] man's hand
[23:08] and you have two more groups come to him
[23:10] now the disciples are standing there
[23:11] watching these groups come Jesus own
[23:13] friends his friends from Nazareth his
[23:15] hometown friends his high school friends
[23:16] maybe we'll say or whatever
[23:18] his hometown friends yeah they come up
[23:20] and say Jesus you've lost your mind
[23:23] something is wrong with you
[23:25] you're speaking against the Pharisees
[23:27] and you're doing healings and and it's
[23:29] questionable and then the Pharisees say
[23:31] he's an absolute devil
[23:33] now where would Juiced it
[23:36] right we would have stood with God's
[23:38] word
[23:39] we said we would have stood with the
[23:41] Holy Ghost praise God just like we're
[23:42] doing today praise God
[23:44] but these are trials these are
[23:46] Temptations
[23:47] people would call you a devil right like
[23:48] I shared a few weeks ago I get called
[23:50] devil from time to time oh yeah
[23:52] but again I know my life I know what the
[23:54] word says about me Hallelujah I know
[23:56] what the blood of Jesus Christ does Amen
[23:58] it washes away all my sins praise God
[24:01] and usually the person pointing the
[24:03] accuser that's the one who really needs
[24:05] to be accused
[24:06] right that's what we found
[24:10] but see they had to live live above all
[24:13] that well you're beside you guys lost
[24:15] your minds
[24:16] you guys are the fanatic crowd
[24:19] you're following all these all these
[24:21] false things and and you're the ones
[24:23] that are wrong and the devil's deceived
[24:24] you but you we have to stay with God's
[24:27] word hallelujah
[24:28] this is a beautiful one here Mark I'm
[24:30] sorry Luke 4 16.
[24:32] these are all good but I just want you
[24:34] to see what all these disciples had to
[24:36] endure
[24:38] Luke 4 16.
[24:41] now you remember Jesus goes into the
[24:42] synagogue he reads from Isaiah
[24:45] 61 he sits down in verse 20 and he
[24:48] closed the book and gave it again to the
[24:49] minister and sat down in the eyes of all
[24:51] them that were in the synagogue were
[24:52] fasted on him
[24:54] remember he preached about his Healing
[24:56] Ministry he read the scriptures about
[24:57] his Healing Ministry
[25:00] in verse 21 he began to say to them this
[25:02] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[25:04] ears and all bear and witness and
[25:06] wondered at the gracious Words which
[25:08] proceeded out of his mouth and they said
[25:09] is not this Joseph's son unbelief
[25:13] right so they failed to see the
[25:15] supernatural they looked only at the
[25:17] natural
[25:19] right
[25:20] and then he rebukes them in verse 23 he
[25:22] said to them ye will surely say unto me
[25:24] this proverb or physician heal thyself
[25:26] whatsoever We Have Heard done in
[25:27] Capernaum do also here in thy country
[25:30] and he said very last saying to you no
[25:31] Prophet is accepted his own country now
[25:33] look at that they were going to say do
[25:34] Miracles if you have all those
[25:36] testimonies out there why don't you have
[25:37] them here
[25:39] let's see Church what does it prove God
[25:41] only does Miracles when he wants to do
[25:43] Miracles praise God
[25:45] right he could not do many miracles
[25:47] because they're unbelief
[25:48] praise God I just love this it just
[25:50] shows how God moves when he wants to
[25:52] move he's got a Time see a season four
[25:54] he's got a time for it'll always be at
[25:57] the right time Hallelujah but Satan
[25:59] wants to say do it now do it come on do
[26:01] it now physician
[26:02] come on Big Shot
[26:04] yeah come on uh big come on big guy with
[26:06] the testimony yeah come on sister you
[26:08] have all these testimonies come on do it
[26:09] now where are you at now
[26:11] that's the devil
[26:13] right
[26:14] but it was a test well yeah yeah we you
[26:17] know the disciples what were they
[26:18] thinking yeah well we did see G's do
[26:20] that it's not happening here
[26:23] did he lose his ministry no no no their
[26:25] unbelief was hindering the ministry
[26:27] right
[26:28] it could have been that and also could
[26:30] have been maybe God didn't want to heal
[26:31] anybody there just like at the pool
[26:33] Bethesda how many did he heal there's
[26:35] multitudes laying there how many did he
[26:36] heal Church
[26:38] one person at the pool of Bethesda
[26:43] and he really and Jesus really kind of
[26:45] just healed him without him really
[26:46] asking for it
[26:48] God just did a great work in his life
[26:50] just to show him favor praise God
[26:54] but the disciples could have been saying
[26:56] there of course no doubt they were
[26:58] and they had to they had to go through
[26:59] they had to go through all these trials
[27:01] with Jesus
[27:06] now verse 25 but I tell you of a truth
[27:08] many widows were in the Israel in the
[27:10] days of Elias when the heat heaven was
[27:12] shut up three years and six months when
[27:13] the great family was throughout all the
[27:15] land but unto none of them was Eliza
[27:17] same unto serapta a city of sidon unto a
[27:20] woman that was a widow and many lepers
[27:22] were in Israel in the time of Elisha the
[27:25] prophet and none of them was cleansed
[27:27] saving Naaman the serum so look there's
[27:29] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[27:31] and forever
[27:32] there's many leopards got lepers God
[27:34] heals one
[27:36] there's many starving widows God Saves
[27:38] one
[27:40] is he the same
[27:42] absolutely
[27:44] he's the same now when they heard that
[27:46] how they respond
[27:50] remember before they were gracious words
[27:52] but when Jesus rebukes them and tells
[27:53] them within their heart verse 28 and all
[27:56] day in the synagogue when they heard
[27:57] these things were filled with Wrath
[28:01] so imagine if his disciples are there
[28:03] they see everybody mad at Jesus right
[28:05] right right and they rose up and thrust
[28:07] him out of the city can you imagine them
[28:08] pushing Jesus out of the city we don't
[28:10] want you right just like with the pigs
[28:12] in the swine we don't want you get out
[28:13] of our city
[28:15] see they push away the word but we
[28:17] invite the word of God hallelujah we
[28:19] want the Holy Spirit here hallelujah
[28:22] we want the scripture to be fulfilled in
[28:24] our midst amen hallelujah
[28:26] thank God
[28:28] and they led him to the Bro the brow of
[28:30] the Hill whereupon their city was built
[28:32] that they might cast him down headlong
[28:35] but he passing through the midst of them
[28:37] went his way so it proves Satan can't do
[28:40] anything to you unless God allows it
[28:42] amen
[28:43] they push him all the way to the edge
[28:45] and somehow he just walks in right
[28:47] through them they're blinded to him just
[28:49] like the Prophet Elijah amen
[28:51] they get blinded to him
[28:53] see God won't allow anything unless it's
[28:55] his will to happen
[28:57] so if he allows it we ought to say thank
[28:59] God thank God for bringing me this test
[29:01] and help me to overcome this test praise
[29:03] God
[29:04] the disciples saw that they saw him
[29:06] being pushed they saw this violence
[29:08] against him they saw the anger that he
[29:10] stirred up
[29:11] but they stayed with him
[29:15] in Luke 6 1-11
[29:17] the scriptures say that the Pharisees
[29:20] accused him of blaspheming the Sabbath
[29:22] well now you don't even keep the holy
[29:24] day
[29:25] right he says he forgives sins and now
[29:29] he heals and works he works on the
[29:31] Sabbath day
[29:33] I mean how much how many more
[29:34] accusations can he have he's a devil
[29:36] he's a blasphemer
[29:38] he says he can forgive He makes himself
[29:40] equal with God he said before Abraham
[29:42] was I am amen
[29:45] Hallelujah
[29:47] yet his disciples stood with him right
[29:49] there
[29:51] in Luke 8 I believe it's jairus's
[29:53] daughter
[29:54] Jesus comes in the house everybody's
[29:56] weeping and crying and Jesus Jesus says
[29:59] she's not dead she sleeps
[30:01] and everybody starts laughing at him
[30:06] right right but we know three of them
[30:07] three is three closest three disciples
[30:09] with the gifts rather the three
[30:11] disciples with the gifts that worked
[30:12] really well together they went in
[30:13] together
[30:14] and Jesus showed him this is how you
[30:15] raise the dead Hallelujah praise God
[30:19] but they had to stay with him despite
[30:21] all the laughing
[30:22] church have you been laughed at or if
[30:24] you've been made fun of just know Jesus
[30:26] will stand with you if you stand with
[30:28] him praise God
[30:30] whether your name called
[30:33] whether they people are trying to ruin
[30:35] your reputation
[30:38] they say you're too holy or not holy
[30:40] enough we stay with the word of God
[30:42] hallelujah Satan throws every attack
[30:44] every accusation right at us we've got
[30:47] to stand there in the midst of the
[30:48] Temptation and we've got to speak God's
[30:50] word we've got to hang with God's word
[30:51] we must continue with the word of God
[30:53] hallelujah
[30:55] man John 6 let's go there John 6 66 for
[30:58] mayor of scripture
[31:16] actually let's go up to verse 63 which
[31:18] is a beautiful portion here it is the
[31:20] spirit that quickeneth the flesh profit
[31:22] of nothing the words that I speak unto
[31:23] you they are spirit and they are life
[31:25] there's life in the word of God
[31:28] but there are some of you that believe
[31:30] not for Jesus knew from the beginning
[31:31] who they were that believed not and who
[31:34] should betray him
[31:36] so Jesus knew these seventy and Judas
[31:39] right they're at least 71.
[31:41] Jesus knew they would believe for a
[31:43] while like that seed fall on the ground
[31:44] on the Stony ground and believed for a
[31:46] while it rejoiced with joy they had joy
[31:49] in the house of the Lord for a little
[31:51] while
[31:52] but Jesus knew they didn't have the
[31:53] right foundation their Foundation was
[31:55] stoned what they needed was a real good
[31:58] honest Heart Foundation praise God
[32:03] and as the scripture says
[32:05] Jesus knew
[32:06] when he started preaching the words that
[32:08] I in the bread of the I'm the bread of
[32:10] life praise God I'm the bread that came
[32:12] down from heaven Hallelujah
[32:13] as he said in John chapter 6.
[32:18] he says uh verse let's read uh verse 65.
[32:22] and he said therefore said I unto you
[32:24] that no man can come unto me except that
[32:26] we're given unto him of the father
[32:30] and from that time many of his disciples
[32:32] went back and walked no more with him
[32:36] he didn't lose a few it's like getting
[32:38] he lost almost all of them
[32:41] is that right Church
[32:43] like brother man said he's thinning out
[32:44] the crowd why to get down to the real
[32:46] cream of the crop
[32:48] Hallelujah I'm glad to be a part of the
[32:49] cream of the crop hallelujah thank God
[32:51] all these things about brother random
[32:53] they can run people up that's because
[32:54] they never believed in the first place
[32:57] right or maybe they believe for a little
[32:58] while but they didn't they never had the
[33:00] real ground of God in the first place
[33:01] that's what I want to say Amen the seed
[33:03] may have fallen on the heart but the
[33:05] heart was never the right kind of ground
[33:06] Hallelujah
[33:08] that's right
[33:10] you mean to tell me these people can be
[33:12] talked out of brother Brown's message
[33:14] and go back to the trinity
[33:16] and go back to the pope some of them say
[33:19] now the Catholic church is not the
[33:21] mother Harlan well who else killed
[33:23] millions of Protestants during the the
[33:25] Crusades who else was it
[33:29] how could they how could they be
[33:31] persuaded is because they didn't have a
[33:33] good and honest heart to begin with
[33:36] the churches I've been showing some of
[33:39] my YouTube videos lately they'll let a
[33:41] one minute and 40 second video convince
[33:43] them that brother Brandon plagiarized
[33:46] yeah brother random preached two hours
[33:48] two and a half hours on a seal
[33:51] and they'll and they'll they'll take
[33:53] three or four words of brother random
[33:54] and try to prove he was a plagiarist
[33:56] with three or four words out of a two
[33:58] and a half hour sermon
[34:00] if you can be deceived by that you you
[34:02] didn't have the right heart in the first
[34:04] place praise God
[34:06] and the people in the comments say
[34:07] that's amazing research they actually
[34:09] say that it's amazing research it's
[34:11] amazingly simple way that Satan deceives
[34:14] people that don't have an oddest heart
[34:15] praise God
[34:17] it's just like in the Bible when they uh
[34:21] it's just like in the Bible when the
[34:22] Pharisees said oh we never saw a prophet
[34:25] born out of Bethlehem
[34:28] or whatever one uh but they I'm sorry
[34:31] Nazareth yeah they said we never heard
[34:33] of a prophet born in Nazareth but he
[34:35] wasn't born in Nazareth he was born in
[34:37] Bethlehem they never searched it out to
[34:40] see where was he really born they were
[34:42] having false accusations against him but
[34:45] the Bible says the righteous study it to
[34:47] answer praise God that's what I was
[34:49] telling brother Simon I said some of
[34:50] these people that leave the message I
[34:51] wonder if they're even righteous how can
[34:53] you be righteous when you won't study a
[34:55] sermon and then the sermon proves
[34:58] brother and wasn't a plagiarist but yet
[34:59] you'll call Brother random Pleasures
[35:01] when you won't even study to have the
[35:03] right answer yourself
[35:07] that shows a very disrighteous heart or
[35:09] I don't even not surprised probably not
[35:11] even a word an unrighteous heart
[35:13] because a righteous heart studies to
[35:16] give the right answer
[35:17] yes is that right
[35:19] we want to know what we're talking about
[35:24] it's so thin
[35:27] it's thinner than the broth of a chicken
[35:29] the shadow of a chicken that's starved
[35:31] to death
[35:32] right they're one minute one and a half
[35:34] minute videos falsely accusing brother
[35:36] Bram it's a shame they never understood
[35:39] the seals to begin with Brother Ray for
[35:41] 30 40 20 years they said amen to the
[35:43] seals and they never understood the
[35:44] seals in the first place
[35:46] with shows they had intellectualism not
[35:48] revelation
[35:49] because when you got Revelation the
[35:51] Gates of Hell won't Prevail against you
[35:52] here we stand today on the revelation of
[35:54] God's word hallelujah we're standing on
[35:56] it praise God and God backs up his word
[35:58] hallelujah
[36:00] the righteous studies the answer
[36:03] so people that want to go they're going
[36:05] to go no matter what you show
[36:07] if they really want to go they're going
[36:09] to go
[36:11] see Jesus preached the word in John
[36:13] chapter 6 and many of the disciples went
[36:15] away they just walked away
[36:17] despite all the scriptures despite all
[36:19] these things
[36:20] despite all the Miracles they still walk
[36:22] away
[36:24] verse 67 then said Jesus unto the twelve
[36:27] will ye go away
[36:29] will you also go away
[36:32] so then he brings it down and tests them
[36:34] to their faces
[36:36] do you want to go to
[36:39] go too
[36:40] so it would not be unlike Jesus to come
[36:43] to our church or any message church and
[36:45] say do you want to leave the message too
[36:48] do you want to go out and have some fun
[36:50] and sin it's just fun for a season
[36:54] and then it's death and destruction and
[36:56] sorrow
[36:59] it's abuse is from the devil it's just
[37:01] it's the very depths of sin
[37:03] so it'd be like the Holy Spirit today to
[37:05] say the same thing do we want to go as
[37:07] well no sir let's be like Peter praise
[37:09] God
[37:10] Hallelujah verse 68 then Peter answered
[37:13] and said Lord to whom shall we go thou
[37:16] Hast the words of eternal life praise
[37:18] God
[37:19] Hallelujah
[37:21] thank God
[37:24] these people question about around his
[37:25] ministry I said and I told one of them I
[37:27] said brother I said there I have 30 thus
[37:30] saith the Lords from Brother Branham in
[37:31] that book I wrote
[37:33] will you go search it out and to this
[37:34] point he hasn't
[37:36] and when I offer these critics go read
[37:38] my book they won't even read it they'll
[37:40] look into all these lies and fake
[37:42] research but they won't even look into
[37:44] the word of God but thank God we've got
[37:46] the word of God hallelujah
[37:49] with thus saith the Lord where else we
[37:50] we go we've got words of eternal life
[37:53] praise God we've got words that just
[37:55] being baptized ain't enough you got to
[37:57] be filled with the Holy Ghost praise God
[37:59] hallelujah we've got thus saith the Lord
[38:01] God is not three persons having a
[38:03] relationship with himself God is one
[38:05] person Hallelujah
[38:07] we have all these we have thou saith the
[38:09] Lord God gives three works of Grace
[38:10] God's got to call you forgive you he's
[38:13] got to clean you out that he's got to
[38:14] fill you where other churches say he
[38:16] does all three at the same time we know
[38:18] it's a lie but we've got thus saith the
[38:19] Lord that's the bible message that we
[38:22] must receive amen amen Hallelujah we've
[38:25] got thus saith the Lord the Roman
[38:26] Catholic Church is the mother harlot
[38:28] Hallelujah where other people won't go
[38:30] there with a 10-foot pole that's okay
[38:31] we'll point right to it and say it's
[38:33] thus saith the Lord
[38:35] Hallelujah
[38:38] where else are we going to go
[38:41] last year or two years ago brother
[38:42] William and I visited 12 churches
[38:45] and let me be honest with you tell you I
[38:47] could not go in any of those churches
[38:48] it's my home Church
[38:51] because of all the immodesty
[38:53] the weak preaching the weak pulpits
[38:55] there's no Freedom there's no Liberty
[38:57] right there's no joy there's no Victory
[39:00] there's no revelation
[39:02] but we've got all that here praise God
[39:06] we've got all that here hallelujah where
[39:09] else could we go I have nowhere else to
[39:10] go except to God's people hallelujah
[39:12] thank you
[39:13] to the word of God hallelujah
[39:16] like brother man said and take it sides
[39:17] with Jesus he said there was anything
[39:19] better I take you there I take my little
[39:21] church and I go support it Hallelujah
[39:24] same thing here
[39:26] if there's anything greater we go
[39:27] support it but this is the word of God
[39:29] this is thus saith the Lord where else
[39:31] will we go we're staying with God's word
[39:33] hallelujah
[39:34] amen thank God
[39:36] and yet Jesus his disciple stood right
[39:38] there
[39:39] when Jesus said do you want to go to
[39:42] do you want to leave as well
[39:44] they had to stand there and they had to
[39:45] stand the test
[39:47] but Jesus would thank them later thank
[39:49] you for standing with me in my
[39:50] Temptations
[39:53] in other words Church Jesus is watching
[39:56] how you stand
[39:58] Jesus notices your stand for the truth
[40:02] sometimes where we let's we ended last
[40:04] week's message with the feeling of not
[40:06] being seen by God it's such a lie from
[40:09] Satan to say God doesn't see you God
[40:10] sees everything you do oh yes
[40:13] God sees every detail of our lives and
[40:16] God sees that we're standing on the
[40:19] truth
[40:20] God sees that we're continuing to hear
[40:22] the word of God we're continuing to seek
[40:24] his Fellowship we're continuing to press
[40:26] on toward the mark of the High Calling
[40:28] of God in Christ Jesus amen
[40:31] Hallelujah
[40:33] because we're laboring for a better
[40:35] Resurrection
[40:37] we don't want to be at the second
[40:38] Resurrection as far as raised up there
[40:40] we want to be raised up at the first
[40:41] resurrection yeah
[40:45] The church here we see in Luke Luke let
[40:47] me just go back to Luke 22 I'll try to
[40:48] bring this down to close here
[40:51] Luke 22 28.
[41:01] it's a simple thought but I just want to
[41:02] bring this out here
[41:04] just meant a lot to me when I was
[41:05] studying here with 22 28.
[41:09] Jesus rewards those who are faithful to
[41:12] her endure Temptations
[41:15] I thought was very fitting you know we
[41:16] ended last Wednesday night's service
[41:17] with we're not saved by our feelings
[41:21] our feelings are some of the biggest
[41:22] Liars
[41:24] that we hear at any day
[41:26] our feelings
[41:29] right because it can feel good to have
[41:32] another or to have some extra chocolate
[41:34] but it's going to be good for you
[41:36] it can feel good to open up a Cold
[41:39] Mountain Dew but is it good for you
[41:42] it can feel good to go to handles and
[41:44] get the extra scoop of ice cream
[41:47] but it could be good for you
[41:49] right feelings are the last thing
[41:52] right that's the last thing you want to
[41:54] trust is feelings
[41:56] we want to base our faith upon God's
[41:59] promises praise God
[42:00] because this whole world is based upon
[42:02] natural laws and if the whole world is
[42:04] based on natural laws then the whole
[42:05] universe is based on God's spiritual
[42:07] laws
[42:08] right we see the natural laws of work if
[42:11] if that's the case how much more are the
[42:13] spiritual laws at work Hallelujah
[42:17] and I love the part that Jesus said
[42:20] I saw you as you stayed with me in my
[42:22] Temptations
[42:24] you weren't unseen it didn't go Heaven's
[42:28] radar didn't miss the fact right that
[42:30] you stayed with Christ Hallelujah
[42:33] might have felt like that
[42:36] there was definitely some tests and
[42:37] trials right right your Leader's a
[42:38] blasphemer he's a BL he's a uh he's a
[42:41] devil
[42:43] he makes people mad people want to throw
[42:45] him they people want to kill him they
[42:46] want to throw him off cliffs
[42:47] he's a rebel whatever they'd say
[42:51] oh the whole group group of preachers is
[42:53] leaving because of his Doctrine
[42:56] but really it was the right Doctrine
[42:57] they had the wrong Doctrine
[43:00] but Jesus saw the whole time who was
[43:02] faithful and who was not
[43:04] so it is today
[43:06] I want to read now we read 28 year they
[43:08] which have continued with me in my
[43:10] Temptations and what does he say and I
[43:12] appoint unto you a kingdom
[43:14] as my father
[43:16] had the point unto me well so now we get
[43:19] this concept about Rewards
[43:23] if you can stay with Christ in the midst
[43:26] of Temptations
[43:28] Christ will appoint you a level of
[43:30] reward
[43:32] if you can endure the Temptations If you
[43:36] can go through the fires and not and not
[43:38] recant and leave the test of life and
[43:40] and speak against the truth if you can
[43:43] go through the fires
[43:45] then you'll be appointed a great reward
[43:47] on the other side praise God
[43:50] that's good you can just endure
[43:51] it's never going to be easy it's going
[43:53] to be hard
[43:55] no right everybody thought the disciples
[43:56] were crazy everybody thought everybody
[43:58] spoke against them they weren't not a
[44:00] popular group no they feared for their
[44:02] lives so much so on the day of Pentecost
[44:04] they were hiding away for 10 days that's
[44:06] good hiding from the cops for 10 days
[44:08] until the Holy Ghost came amen
[44:11] goodness
[44:13] we're not the popular people no
[44:15] no but they stayed with the word and
[44:18] Jesus said because you endured these
[44:21] Temptations these trials I because you
[44:23] endure what was appointed for you I'll
[44:25] appoint the rewards for you as well
[44:27] Hallelujah
[44:28] Hallelujah
[44:31] what is this Kingdom Jesus you're going
[44:34] to eat and drink at my table
[44:37] In My Kingdom
[44:38] in that beautiful Church we're not going
[44:40] to eat at Joe Biden's table
[44:44] I could put anybody in there you want I
[44:45] could put Ronald Reagan in there if you
[44:46] like
[44:47] I can put George Washington in there
[44:49] we're not going to eat at his table the
[44:50] table is not his the table is the
[44:52] savior's table right
[44:54] Hallelujah
[44:56] it ain't going to be let me say this and
[44:57] they're going to be brother Ram's table
[44:58] it's gonna be Jesus Christ
[45:01] Hallelujah
[45:03] right it ain't going to be my table it's
[45:05] going to be Christ's table Hallelujah
[45:08] see if we're faithful to Christ if we
[45:10] can stand with Christ in the midst of
[45:12] our Temptations we're standing for him
[45:14] praise God when we do it to the least of
[45:16] these is Brethren we're doing it unto
[45:17] him it says he says when you do it to me
[45:19] you sit at my table praise God
[45:22] amen
[45:23] because you endure these trials and
[45:25] these tests
[45:27] then you sit at my table
[45:29] because this was my plan I allowed I
[45:33] ordained this was this was these were my
[45:35] tests that I allowed in your life
[45:36] because it would produce the character
[45:38] of Christ in your life
[45:41] you went through the fires I appointed
[45:43] for you and now I point for you the
[45:45] rewards
[45:48] you get to eat and drink at my table
[45:50] so because they because they dealt with
[45:53] being called a blasphemer
[45:55] because they dealt with uh Jesus being
[45:58] called a devil
[45:59] Jesus says because you went through that
[46:01] and suffered through that I'll eat with
[46:03] you
[46:04] you'll have a place with me at my table
[46:09] see we've got to withstand all the words
[46:11] and all the accusations all the attacks
[46:14] all the lies against us we've got to
[46:15] withstand all that and then Christ says
[46:18] I'll eat with you in the New Kingdom
[46:21] I'll eat and drink
[46:23] Hallelujah
[46:24] and then these 11 with the 12th either
[46:27] Matthias or Paul probably Paul
[46:29] but these 12 would judge the 12 tribes
[46:32] of Israel
[46:33] they would be judges
[46:35] over Israel
[46:37] God's people
[46:39] Jesus's apostles would judge the nation
[46:42] of Israel
[46:44] now Church you know this
[46:46] they were far from perfect I hope this
[46:48] thing blesses somebody's heart tonight
[46:49] amen because this blessed my heart
[46:51] these disciples were not perfect people
[46:55] they were arguing
[46:56] I'm greater than you right
[46:59] my Ministry is way greater than your
[47:02] S no it's not mine's Mine mine's greater
[47:05] no don't let the kids keep the kids away
[47:07] keep them from Jesus don't don't Jesus
[47:09] don't want to hold the babies you just
[47:10] don't want to anoint your your babies he
[47:12] doesn't want to do that
[47:15] all their all their trials
[47:18] they were not perfect
[47:21] they said Jesus you want to call down
[47:22] fire from heaven and destroy all these
[47:24] Sinners let's burn them up and send them
[47:25] to early hell well well Jesus said you
[47:28] don't even know what Spirit you're of
[47:31] right and then they didn't have faith
[47:33] sometimes to pray for the sick
[47:35] or they couldn't cast out some devils
[47:39] they they wouldn't speak to the storm
[47:40] Jesus said oh faith is Generation he's
[47:42] talking to his disciples
[47:44] to church let's be encouraged we may not
[47:46] have the faith we may get caught up in
[47:48] Pride
[47:49] we may have struggles God doesn't ask us
[47:52] to be perfect in ourselves God asks us
[47:54] to Faithfully follow him and stay with
[47:56] him throughout our trials and
[47:58] temptations amen
[48:00] he asked us to trust in the process amen
[48:04] he asked us to have joy in the journey
[48:06] can I say it like that
[48:08] Hallelujah
[48:09] he just asked us to endure to get
[48:12] through it praise God he doesn't ask us
[48:14] for Perfection Nobody's Perfect all have
[48:16] sinned and fallen short of the glory of
[48:18] God but all can be forgiven by the Holy
[48:21] Spirit Hallelujah
[48:22] by the blood of Christ amen
[48:25] all can be forgiven
[48:27] Hallelujah
[48:29] God knows God does not require
[48:31] Perfection he requires you to stay with
[48:33] him
[48:35] how many staying with him Hallelujah
[48:38] I'm not leaving Jesus
[48:39] I don't know where else would I go you
[48:42] think I'd fit in as a Catholic priest
[48:44] too late I got eight kids already
[48:46] Hallelujah
[48:50] you think I've been in as a Pentecostal
[48:53] I don't think so
[48:55] they say speak in tongues brother Jesse
[48:57] I only if God sends it I do it if God
[48:59] does it but I'm going to pretend that's
[49:01] what that's what they did to my friends
[49:03] in college they would stick the preacher
[49:05] would stick it right there and say speak
[49:06] in tongues show us you've got the
[49:08] tongues
[49:09] like I can carry God in my pocket and
[49:11] say yeah yeah I'll just bring out God's
[49:13] Gift whenever I want we just read Jesus
[49:15] couldn't even do it
[49:17] Jesus couldn't do all the things in
[49:18] Nazareth he couldn't heal all the lepers
[49:20] he couldn't heal all the he couldn't
[49:22] feed all the uh all the beggars
[49:24] he could only do what the father showed
[49:27] him how many know God has a higher plan
[49:29] than what we said that what we see many
[49:31] times
[49:33] he's always working
[49:35] he doesn't ask us to understand it he
[49:37] asked us to trust him
[49:40] Hallelujah
[49:42] and Jesus said they that endure to the
[49:45] end they shall be saved
[49:49] hallelujah what a reminder for us
[49:52] and of course we know Jesus said I went
[49:53] over these scriptures with brother Chris
[49:54] in the Bible Study last week
[49:57] Jesus said to he the overcometh he said
[49:59] I'll Grant him a rod of iron
[50:01] that they'll rule over Nations
[50:04] right
[50:05] he said if you're faithful with 10
[50:07] talents you'll rule over 10 cities
[50:11] if you're faithful with five talents
[50:13] you'll rule over five cities
[50:16] the church really as men brother Austin
[50:18] Broadway we just got to rule over our
[50:20] homes
[50:22] if we can rule over our homes praise God
[50:24] hallelujah then we can rule over the
[50:26] gifts in our lives then think about that
[50:28] we'll double our gifts we'll double our
[50:30] Tales
[50:31] right now me I've got to rule my home
[50:33] church and the gifts and talents in my
[50:36] life
[50:37] Hallelujah
[50:38] so I got at least three I think I
[50:40] imagine I don't know I don't know how
[50:41] that works
[50:43] but I got to be faithful
[50:45] I'm not going to be perfect I just got
[50:47] to stay with it amen it's just like the
[50:49] stock market brother I was just
[50:50] listening to some stock market things
[50:51] this week the overall trend of the stock
[50:54] market is up it's going to have some
[50:56] dips but if you just stay with it you're
[50:57] going to get rewarded
[50:59] is that right
[51:01] anyone that stayed with it over the last
[51:03] hundred years they've made great great
[51:04] dividends well that's how it is our
[51:06] lives are like the stock market right
[51:08] sometimes they go up sometimes they go
[51:10] down but overall we're constantly Rising
[51:12] amen going higher raising in faith
[51:15] overcoming more more than conquerors in
[51:17] Christ Jesus amen
[51:19] we're not falling away we're not losing
[51:21] our faith we're not losing our
[51:23] confidence we're trusting God Amen
[51:26] we're trusting God hallelujah I'm not
[51:28] selling out my stock in Jesus amen
[51:30] hallelujah I'm buying more stock in
[51:32] Christ Hallelujah amen
[51:37] Hallelujah
[51:40] it was great rewards Church to those who
[51:42] endure
[51:43] to those who are faithful to those who
[51:45] continue with Christ in the midst of
[51:48] your Temptations
[51:51] how many are more determined than ever
[51:53] to stay with Christ Hallelujah
[51:55] amen
[51:57] again he said ye are they which have
[51:59] continue with me in my Temptations
[52:01] Jesus was all alone on the cross even
[52:03] forsaken by God
[52:06] but he'll reward all those who stuck by
[52:08] him during all his other trials
[52:11] all his other Temptations
[52:15] so we what do we learn from this that
[52:17] we've got to stay with one another in
[52:18] the midst of our trials
[52:20] like I said church if you need help you
[52:22] need to reach out to somebody for prayer
[52:24] the Bible said confess your faults one
[52:26] to another
[52:27] right
[52:29] and the Bible also says if you want a
[52:31] friend you've got to show yourself
[52:32] friendly
[52:35] that's right
[52:37] friendship is a two-way street
[52:41] well brother Jess you haven't uh reached
[52:44] out to me in a while when was the last
[52:45] time you reached out to me
[52:48] well just you really need to encourage
[52:49] me when was the last time you encouraged
[52:51] me
[52:51] you know what I mean it works both ways
[52:53] right
[52:55] and I want to encourage you I want you
[52:56] to encourage me
[52:58] but see how the enemy will try to attack
[52:59] us
[53:03] but see if
[53:04] if we all love the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:06] we'll look at all the trials of our life
[53:08] and we'll see oh my brother's trying my
[53:10] sister's trying we'll see I'm trying I'm
[53:13] not perfect my brother's not perfect my
[53:15] sister's not perfect but we're all
[53:17] trying we're enduring and we will help
[53:19] each other through these Temptations
[53:21] Hallelujah
[53:23] and then church there's a great reward
[53:24] at the end
[53:25] there's a great reward at the end
[53:30] look at this Paul said I commend unto
[53:32] you Phoebe our sister which is a servant
[53:34] of the church which is that
[53:36] centria
[53:39] so Paul knew this this is the church
[53:41] she's a servant to everybody else
[53:45] that's the reputation she gained over
[53:47] the time when she was at this church in
[53:48] Rome
[53:49] she was a servant to the church
[53:52] we should all strive to be servants
[53:55] that you receive her in the Lord as we
[53:57] come as Saints and that you assist her
[53:59] in whatsoever business she hath need of
[54:01] you now here's her business she was
[54:03] trying to secure others which means help
[54:06] them heal them provide for their needs
[54:10] so Paul says here's a sister she's
[54:12] leading this ministry of helping all the
[54:14] people meet their needs he said assist
[54:16] her because she's the leader in it
[54:20] the same preaching the same Bible
[54:22] studies the same song service
[54:24] this is helping people with food shelter
[54:26] clothing
[54:28] and Paul said all you other Saints you
[54:30] need to go help that sister
[54:32] because notice yeah right
[54:35] whatever whatever is business the
[54:37] business food shelter clothing for she
[54:39] has been a Sakura many end of who of
[54:41] myself
[54:44] look at that she helped out the preacher
[54:46] when he needed help
[54:48] this is her testimony
[54:50] right in other words Glory in other
[54:53] words she was there when people were
[54:54] going through trials sure she was
[54:57] she was there to secure she was there to
[55:00] help people right when they were
[55:02] struggling oh yeah
[55:03] yeah and not just the sisters Paul too
[55:06] right
[55:07] Paul too yeah
[55:10] how many believe there's a great reward
[55:11] for sister Phoebe in heaven
[55:14] oh yeah I imagine she's got a great
[55:15] reward up there
[55:17] if she was faithful with all the talents
[55:18] now look it looks like looks looks like
[55:20] shirt she's pretty it looks like she's
[55:22] pretty faithful
[55:23] how many people did she help out a few
[55:25] in the church
[55:28] and Paul makes a note to say she was a
[55:31] helper of many
[55:34] she was constantly helping people so
[55:37] help assist her she's the leader in that
[55:39] Ministry of the food and shelter and
[55:41] clothing she's the leader in that you
[55:43] just help her out and you'll have a
[55:45] great reward too
[55:49] how many believe that by God's grace
[55:53] now here I love this for in that he
[55:55] himself has suffered being tempted he is
[55:57] able to secure them that are tempted
[56:00] so Jesus can secure us as well
[56:04] he can meet our needs he can help us in
[56:06] the midst of our trials because he went
[56:08] through trials
[56:10] so see church now we get now we have a
[56:12] we have a good point either God will use
[56:15] somebody to help you in your trial or
[56:17] the Lord Jesus will come and help you in
[56:18] your trial but either way it's Jesus
[56:20] amen it was Jesus and Phoebe amen and it
[56:23] was Jesus helped Paul and other times
[56:24] too it was Jesus the help Paul right
[56:27] here
[56:27] at first no man stood with me but all
[56:29] men forsook me I pray God that it may be
[56:31] not laid to their charge notwithstanding
[56:34] the Lord stood with me and strengthened
[56:35] me praise God no man so Phoebe wasn't
[56:38] there in this trial
[56:40] thank God she helped many people but see
[56:42] the church there's going to be times
[56:43] when you're isolated man there's gonna
[56:45] be times you're isolated there ain't
[56:46] going to be some other somebody there to
[56:47] help you but you got to trust that
[56:49] Christ will be there to help you praise
[56:50] God
[56:52] we have to trust it Christ will be there
[56:54] because he's still with Paul he'll stand
[56:57] with you praise God
[56:58] and the myth in the midst of your trials
[57:02] all right isn't that beautiful
[57:04] so the Lord Jesus Will secure
[57:07] you in the midst of your trials
[57:10] he'll either do it by the Holy Spirit or
[57:12] he'll do it through some other brother
[57:14] or sister and the sister said
[57:17] you don't have to just be a brother
[57:18] every time
[57:20] to be a sister
[57:24] now I'm bringing this I'm going to close
[57:26] to this I'm just bringing this out I
[57:28] preach this in the pride series
[57:29] overcoming Pride
[57:30] it's not if you'll battle Pride it's
[57:32] when you'll battle Pride
[57:36] so it's not if you're going to go
[57:37] through a Temptation it's when are you
[57:39] going to go through it
[57:40] and church like I said our church is
[57:42] kind of in the midst of that right now
[57:44] we're in the midst of the trial and we
[57:46] got overcome by the blood of the Lamb
[57:49] in the word of Our Testimony
[57:53] now you might remember this
[57:55] I'm going to skip past that but there's
[57:57] these two books that we've read at our
[57:59] home actually we're listening to the
[58:00] audiobook I don't know have we read them
[58:01] all at home too
[58:04] these two books are beautiful books from
[58:06] the 1800s
[58:08] but in each book these two books there's
[58:10] a giant killer and there's sir Knight
[58:11] The Splendid way in each book it's an
[58:13] allegory of a knight who's got to
[58:16] overcome all these Giants
[58:18] in other words all these trials all
[58:20] these Temptations
[58:22] it's a beautiful allegory that in our
[58:24] lives we have Giants that we have to
[58:27] defeat
[58:29] it's not all flowery bed of these
[58:33] life isn't always a picnic
[58:36] now thank God there's times we're hedged
[58:37] about and we rejoice in those seasons
[58:41] but in each time I think it's
[58:43] interesting and each time the night here
[58:46] what was his name again
[58:48] fight us
[58:49] the night here had to face sloth
[58:51] laziness one on one
[58:55] then he had to face the giant of
[58:56] selfishness one on one
[58:59] isolated
[59:01] but church he wasn't really alone
[59:03] because he had the armor of God on
[59:06] Amen Hallelujah
[59:08] he had the armor of God
[59:10] that the king gave to him Hallelujah in
[59:13] other words we've got the sword of the
[59:14] spirit which is the Holy Spirit and the
[59:16] holy spirit's God how many can say Amen
[59:18] to that
[59:19] the holy spirit is God
[59:22] and how do you defeat the giant of
[59:24] untruth By The Sword of the spirit
[59:27] how did he defeat the giant hate through
[59:29] the sword of the spirit
[59:31] and the last one how did he defeat the
[59:33] giant Pride through the sword of the
[59:35] spirit of course through humility
[59:38] now this one's fresh on my mind because
[59:39] I listened to it this week I took the
[59:41] kids out on a few errands this week
[59:43] this is my favorite
[59:45] Lamplighter book of all time
[59:48] constant is the name of this Knight
[59:53] and the first Temptation after he gets
[59:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:57] in the chapel which is a type of the
[59:59] church
[1:00:01] he's tempted to turn back before he even
[1:00:03] starts out on the journey
[1:00:07] and then his his next battle is he's got
[1:00:10] to overcome the deception to not fight
[1:00:12] at all that there's no need to fight and
[1:00:14] you can live a life of frolic
[1:00:18] right like there's no more battles
[1:00:20] anymore
[1:00:21] right that's that's the people in the
[1:00:23] message that say we're in the Millennium
[1:00:24] that's basically what that is
[1:00:26] and they're deceived right we're in the
[1:00:28] midst of a battle we're in the mid we're
[1:00:30] still overcoming later to see you praise
[1:00:31] God
[1:00:32] there's only peace in our souls
[1:00:34] everywhere else we look is battles and
[1:00:36] tests and trials Temptations
[1:00:39] the third battle was isolation jealousy
[1:00:42] of a brother
[1:00:45] and when he got jealous of the brother
[1:00:46] uh the devil tricked him to isolate
[1:00:48] himself he left the fellowship now
[1:00:50] that's like people leaving church
[1:00:52] right they'll isolate themselves away
[1:00:54] from the body and then you got he got
[1:00:57] teamed up by all these demon powers but
[1:00:59] then the Holy Spirit led the brothers to
[1:01:00] come rescue him amen
[1:01:03] the love of the love of God
[1:01:05] brought rescue from the Saints so see
[1:01:06] it's a it's a body Ministry praise God
[1:01:10] we help one another we encourage one
[1:01:11] another praise God like brother Adam
[1:01:13] said we're only as strong as our weakest
[1:01:14] Christian God make us strong Hallelujah
[1:01:18] help me not to be the weak link help me
[1:01:20] to be the strong link praise God
[1:01:22] Hallelujah
[1:01:25] and then I thought it was fitting too he
[1:01:28] lost he lost a loved one sir ardent he
[1:01:31] had to deal with the death of a loved
[1:01:32] one
[1:01:33] like our sisters are
[1:01:36] he had to go through that and this is a
[1:01:37] beautiful allegory all Christians go
[1:01:39] through these things right we all battle
[1:01:40] jealousy we all battle laziness
[1:01:43] we all better we all battle given up
[1:01:47] we all battle the death of loved one at
[1:01:49] some point
[1:01:51] and then we battled the sorrow and pain
[1:01:55] we go through sorrows and pains that
[1:01:57] sometimes we we don't even know how
[1:01:59] we'll get through it but in each case he
[1:02:01] gets through it by saying the name of
[1:02:03] the king amen
[1:02:04] Hallelujah just like us we overcome
[1:02:06] every trial through the name of Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ
[1:02:09] Hallelujah
[1:02:12] that's what I love what Peter said after
[1:02:13] that man got healed he said do you think
[1:02:15] we by our power or are by name has made
[1:02:18] this man whole he said by the name of
[1:02:20] Jesus Christ of Nazareth this man stands
[1:02:22] before you whole and there's no other
[1:02:25] name given under Heaven whereby men must
[1:02:27] be saved amen
[1:02:30] then he had to overcome he was actually
[1:02:32] the one who caused he was trying to get
[1:02:34] an older Knight to accept the Praises of
[1:02:38] men and actually led to his death
[1:02:41] so that's a a test of pride
[1:02:45] he had he was testing him to leave his
[1:02:47] position right
[1:02:51] the praise of men the Bible said they're
[1:02:52] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[1:02:54] God
[1:02:56] and then the second to last test was the
[1:02:57] question that's where we're at today
[1:02:58] with the message all these questions
[1:03:00] about the message are you sure brother
[1:03:02] man was a prophet are you sure the
[1:03:04] message is right are you sure there's
[1:03:06] going to be a Rapture are you sure all
[1:03:07] these questions well let me tell you I
[1:03:09] got every answer right here in the Bible
[1:03:11] for you
[1:03:12] come look at if you want to but I find
[1:03:14] out they just want to ask questions they
[1:03:15] don't actually want to know the answers
[1:03:17] that's what I found they ask a lot of
[1:03:19] questions but they shut up and leave me
[1:03:21] alone when I tell them the answers
[1:03:23] yeah that's exactly right
[1:03:27] and the last battle this uh this night
[1:03:29] constant battle
[1:03:32] was the temptation to retire in ease
[1:03:35] rather than ending his life laboring for
[1:03:38] other people
[1:03:40] so again bearing one another's burdens
[1:03:44] and of course he overcame that
[1:03:45] Temptation and he took up the burden and
[1:03:48] he won the Victory and then he wakes up
[1:03:50] into King City praise God he he makes it
[1:03:52] to Heaven by God's grace but church he
[1:03:54] had to endure every one of these uh
[1:03:56] Giants
[1:03:57] he had to endure every one of these
[1:03:59] tests now there were great seasons in
[1:04:02] between there there's great seasons of
[1:04:03] going into the gardens and enjoying the
[1:04:05] fragrances there was great scenes of
[1:04:07] Fellowship
[1:04:08] where there was an awful lot of Trials
[1:04:11] like I told brother amen when I was
[1:04:12] praying for him yesterday I said many
[1:04:13] are the afflictions of the righteous the
[1:04:15] Bible didn't say for you the Bible said
[1:04:16] many are the afflictions of the
[1:04:18] righteous but the Lord delivers them out
[1:04:20] of all of them praise God
[1:04:22] how many believe that by God's grace
[1:04:24] many are the afflictions
[1:04:26] many are The Temptations the trials that
[1:04:29] we go through but the Lord will deliver
[1:04:31] us out of everyone
[1:04:34] Hallelujah
[1:04:36] so there's my last one
[1:04:38] the Victorious Knight's name was
[1:04:40] constant in other words you must just
[1:04:42] constantly keep the faith
[1:04:44] just endure
[1:04:46] just overcome don't turn your back on
[1:04:48] Christ
[1:04:50] what's Revelation 17 14 say these shall
[1:04:53] make war with the lamb and the lamb
[1:04:54] shall overcome them for he is Lord of
[1:04:56] lords and king of kings and they that
[1:04:58] are with Jesus Christ are called to be
[1:05:01] of Jesus Christ they're chosen to be
[1:05:03] with Jesus Christ and they're faithful
[1:05:05] to Jesus Christ how many are faithful to
[1:05:07] Jesus Christ tonight amen let's stand
