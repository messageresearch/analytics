you [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] i'm [Music] oh [Music] i have to read a couple portions of scripture here while we start with our memory verse we'll start with ecclesiastes 12. ecclesiastes 12 verse 1 and i'll just read a couple scriptures on prayer [Music] ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. let's read this together let's begin on three one two 3 remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them amen let's go to first timothy 2. let's read a little portion on prayer here first timothy 2 verse 1. just a beautiful portion of scripture here we preach a couple times over the last few years but just some good scriptures on prayer let's read verses uh one and two together okay now after that i'll read a little bit beyond that first timothy two verses one and two let's begin on three one two three i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty and i'll read a little bit myself here for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior notice he said first of all prayers first of all so when a church comes together the first thing paul says is pray make these prayers verse 4 who will have all men to be saved we know all men will not be saved but it's those it's god's desire for all men to be saved so it takes prayer to work together with that and to come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time let's remember that as we pray that those of us that have loved ones or friends that are not saved jesus died as a ransom for them he died to pay for their sins and let's pray that they'll recognize jesus's great sacrifice ephesians 6 here we'll just read one more portion of the scripture here ephesians 6 12 and 13. this is where sometimes we realize how prayer can be very challenging because it's a wrestling match it's a wrestling match verse 12 remember jesus says he tells us not to faint he said shall i find faith on earth shall i find prayers of faith on earth when i return why will so many uh not have faith because they don't have strength to keep praying so we gotta have strength to keep wrestling against spiritual wickedness in high places ephesians 6 12 and 13 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand amen tonight lord willing i'd like to just uh you know just do prayer a little differently i got a few i basically got seven things to pray about uh we'll just pray for them in groups so we'll start with uh ministers uh both the net the spiritual ministers and then the natural ministers like the government leaders so we'll take a few minutes we'll pray for the ministers that's the first group we'll pray for and then we'll pray for uh the troubles like the sick and the afflicted and the tested and the tried amongst the saints then we'll pray for the way words after that and i kind of got this outline from brother amen and i were talking about prayer one time and we kind of just made a prayer list here pray for the waywards that have been with us and have moved on and fallen into sin and shame and then we'll pray for uh our thirst for growing and knowledge and judgment and kind of like thirst for revelation so we'll pray for that by god's grace because brother adam says pray for that more than anything else he said pray for revelation more than anything else revelation is the will of god right so if we know the will of god that's the shield of faith that's the shield of revelation so when a temptation comes if we've got well we already know god's will for that we know that's wrong we can extinguish that dark instantly by revelation and then we'll pray for uh our fellowship kind of the unity of our local church here by god's grace and we'll pray for supernatural things after that by god's grace and before we get into these does anybody have any special requests tonight any uh important prayer requests nature okay yes wonderful so pray for uh this arrival of the baby so imagine that kind of falls under uh well i wouldn't call it trouble so i guess i'll have to make another section there so maybe uh just basic needs i imagine just basic needs that's a basic uh event of life so we'll just pray for that uh so the student's mother yep we'll pray for that i sure appreciated when everybody prayed for the rival of zion i really appreciated that virtue carmia mikey maggie okay we talked about maggie uh okay maggie's the one battling cancer okay so that would be a trouble right and our god is strong and he's a very present help in time of trouble so let's pray for maggie as well that would be under the troubles there and every couple groups we'll just invite the musicians up to kind of freshen us up a little bit i think i got that from your dad one time but william sent me some videos of how they pray in ghana and people walk around and shout and praise the lord and kind of mixes it up i know sometimes i'm so tired i fall asleep when i'm praying like real quiet i feel pretty good tonight but uh that's a good thing to do build up your most holy faith praying in the holy spirit i think that's a beautiful thing to do and a brother from minnesota showed me that he's a brother from the congo but he lives in minnesota he showed me a little video how their church does it they'll pray and then like individually and then every couple songs every couple of prayer requests will come up and get the musicians back up and kind of freshen everybody's perspective so yeah i like that let's pray for maggie for sure i'll also pray for that co-worker of brother stephen the dad of the co-worker with brain cancer anyone else have a need tonight haven okay so we'll put that under the waywards perhaps lydia okay unspoken okay we'll just put that under this the needs there may be supernatural unspoken okay so we'll start with uh let's pray for ministers first and troubles so we'll let everybody uh if you can just turn on the instrumental for a little bit we'll just maybe pray for 10 minutes or so for these needs um so let's remember the fivefold ministry you know think of the saints there in ghana you know the ministers there let's remember we can also include brother simon coming on sunday our service on friday night lord willing i'll be preaching that i think i'm going to preach on god's receipt brother branham said jesus when he raised from the dead that was god's receipt for us so i'm gonna think i'm gonna preach on that i've been sitting on that the last few days here um so i'll preach my easter message to you on good friday i'll probably appreciate in iowa too guys just been enjoying that thought um and then you know just our our loved ones you know we think of brother uh brooks brother dennis mcbride he's going to come in may so he's coming up in may i got to get brother diggs back up here too i told him amen that um so brother keith randolph i get him up here too let's pray that god will guide our ministry here and then government leaders you know we can pray for the president vice president i'm mainly praying for them for repentance but also any way that they can help keep the scriptural commands that we can live a life quiet peaceable life in all godliness i heard they're trying to do like a [Music] mandated vaccine passport so they're trying to get that through so let's pray against that that doesn't help us with a quiet or peaceable life right that doesn't help us but we know somehow the mark of the beast has got to come in so you know god may have raised up this administration for that purpose you know because i never prayed any more than i did for the last election and it didn't go the way i wanted so you know god raises people up god takes people exactly what to pray for but uh i don't like that idea so let's pray that that gets stopped and then the sick and afflicted so we can pray for maggie coworker of brother stephen and hudson's skin condition right can pray for that okay well praise the lord anything else you think of lydia or malcolm okay all right we're going to play the i'm just going to set a timer just kind of as a reminder i don't want to be bound by time but i just kind of want to have a balance and pray for things as we feel lighter the lord me turn [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Applause] so [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause]

thank you all the sisters you know who really prayed that was such a beautiful thing by god's grace god is so good to us so really see you know we can really see why god places certain people in certain places you know you can really see god called you know naomi beatrice here and everybody's gotta everybody's got his important position uh through the grace of god to really see how we need one another don't we we need everybody's experiences and their their leadings of the lord we just need it all uh it's so important so we're thankful for that let's take a few minutes and let's pray for the way words you know i'm not gonna name them but i could but we've you know i just listed uh one two three four five six seven seven people that have left uh recently you know wayward uh left the message or left our church you know and uh so let's just remember them in prayer you know we'll just pray that the lord we know the lord will go and try to bring them back but let's remember them in prayer if the lord will lead us to do anything to try to get people back oh and there's also if you pray for me to uh remember that brother named stanley who got baptized after watching my video i text him this week and he actually texted back and i'm trying to meet up with him on my spring break so i want to drive down there and see if i can meet up with him and just try to encourage him so if you remember him his name is stanley uh he's not wayward anything but he just kind of came up in my thoughts there i just heard back from yesterday i think it was so let's pray for waywards anyone you
