[27:14] revelation 8 verse 1 let's read verse 1
[27:18] together on three one two three and when
[27:22] he had opened the Seventh Seal There was
[27:24] silence in heaven about the space of
[27:27] half an hour
[27:28] amen let's have a word of Prayer let's
[27:30] bow our heads as we go before the Lord
[27:32] here tonight Heavenly Father were
[27:34] grateful for your mercy we grant

[27:37] that there's going to be a meeting in

[28:04] just be changed the moment wink of an
[28:06] eye let us have clean garments Lord
[28:08] spotless a white washed in the blood of
[28:12] I am Lord God that's what we desire
[28:13] tonight and God just speak to us through
[28:15] thy word Lord God give us grace to
[28:17] present it Lord God and father just add
[28:20] the blessings of the word to our hearts
[28:22] we know the book of Revelation says
[28:24] you're blessed to hear it and keep it oh
[28:27] god help us to eat here tonight and key
[28:30] to Jesus Christ's name and the church
[28:32] said Amen god bless should be in Cena
[28:34] praise God so I do have some quotes here
[28:40] I like to show tonight now we're getting
[28:45] into the spot of the book of Revelation
[28:47] where this is the Tribulation Period
[28:50] we're getting very close and we'll look
[28:52] at that here tonight and and brother
[28:54] Branham as you know he talks about a lot
[28:57] in the Feast of Trumpets and also
[28:58] recognizing it's a day in it's message
[29:00] your Danis message from 1964 if you
[29:03] listen to those quotes are those sermons
[29:05] I listened in the last few weeks brother
[29:07] Branham says he was trying to get up
[29:09] meetings set up for the trumpets and the
[29:13] vowels and everything like that and he
[29:15] said he just couldn't figure it out you
[29:16] know everything was falling apart he
[29:18] tried to rent the gymnasium the High
[29:19] School gymnasium it fell through tried
[29:21] to put up a tent that fell through and
[29:23] he said he got real sincere he went into
[29:25] prayer he said well he told his wife I'm
[29:27] going in to pray and he said the Holy
[29:29] Spirit revealed it to him that these
[29:30] things don't pertain to the bride and
[29:33] he'd already supernaturally preached
[29:35] them when he preached the sixth seal so
[29:38] we're getting to the spot now in the
[29:40] book of Revelation from the eighth
[29:42] chapter to basically the nineteenth
[29:44] chapter where a lot of this deals with
[29:47] the Tribulation Period
[29:49] so tonight especially as we look at
[29:51] verse eight and nine I'm sorry chapters
[29:53] 8 & 9 rather a lot of this begins
[29:55] dealing with that and so brother brand
[29:58] didn't preach a whole lot on this but
[29:59] I've tried to pull out everything I
[30:00] could find out about it and place them
[30:03] together so we'll start looking at that
[30:06] by the grace of the Lord so this is part
[30:08] 1 of chapter 8 and maybe just a chapter
[30:11] 8 and 9 and may just be you all one part
[30:13] together because like I said the brother
[30:15] man never preached extensive services on
[30:17] these and so we have more or we have a
[30:20] lot less to go on but by God's grace we
[30:23] still want to preach it my desire
[30:25] churches to preach
[30:26] all the way from revelation 1:1 to
[30:27] Revelation 22:20 1 that's my desire and
[30:31] so then you've heard the whole Council
[30:32] of God a member there's blessings to
[30:34] here and blessings to keep it and we
[30:36] need to hear and we need to keep it
[30:38] tonight as well by God's grace so let's
[30:40] look at this here now revelation 8 1 of
[30:42] course is the seventh and final seal now
[30:45] remember the order of the seals is
[30:47] different the first four are going on
[30:50] are the first three are pass we're under
[30:51] the fourth right now I believe and as
[30:53] soon as the rapture goes the rapture is
[30:55] the seven so it kind of gets out of
[30:57] order as far as chronic chronic chronic
[31:00] Redonda chronologic Ronna logically
[31:03] there we go chronologically forgive me
[31:07] chronologically so you have four then it
[31:09] skips to seven seven the seventh seal is
[31:12] the rapture and then it goes to number
[31:15] five because during the rapture
[31:17] I'm sorry during the great marriage
[31:18] supper before Jesus comes down the
[31:21] soulsand the altar cry out how long Lord
[31:23] brother branham said that that's during
[31:25] the Tribulation Period because the the
[31:27] Lord will tell the Jews wait a little
[31:29] while your brethren have to be martyrs
[31:32] have to give their lives for a little
[31:34] season which that season is a three and
[31:36] a half year Tribulation Period and then
[31:38] so it goes for seven five and then the
[31:42] final one is six we'd say but remember
[31:44] the whole time after the rapture after
[31:47] the rapture goes the seventh seal the
[31:49] whole time from the rapture unto the
[31:52] Millennium is considered the seventh
[31:54] seal
[31:54] because remember brother Branham tells
[31:56] us the seven seals the end of all time
[31:57] he says the end of history
[31:59] he says the end of struggling nature so
[32:01] the seven seals is this little time
[32:03] period from the time of the rapture all
[32:05] the way through the Tribulation Period
[32:07] until the millennium breaks amen so it's
[32:12] quite a it's quite a thought so the
[32:14] first three are gone or I've already
[32:15] passed we're under the fourth seal once
[32:17] the seventh seal breaks is this big long
[32:19] time period and in that you have the
[32:21] fifth and sixth but if this whole time
[32:23] period is the seven seal so that's what
[32:26] brother Branham teaches now if you would
[32:28] like I have I have all these on youtube
[32:32] so if you haven't watched these they
[32:34] don't these revelation ones don't have
[32:35] many views compared to like the high
[32:37] heels that's got almost 4,000 over
[32:39] 4,000 views I think people aren't really
[32:42] looking for revelation anymore you know
[32:44] they're not really searching for the
[32:45] book of Revelation a lot people are
[32:47] searching for more like sanctification
[32:49] issues which is okay you know but I want
[32:53] to have videos out there to teach
[32:54] everybody the revelation God gave
[32:56] brother Branham to us so if you want to
[32:59] see these next these next two chapters
[33:01] they're already on there if you like to
[33:03] watch him and you haven't watched them
[33:05] you go back over in fact I had a brother
[33:07] call me this week and he thanked me for
[33:08] making these videos he said my my
[33:10] children had questions on on the seven
[33:14] seals and and so I took them to the
[33:16] videos and it really helped them and and
[33:18] questions on the Godhead and they really
[33:20] helped them so I said praise the Lord
[33:22] they've been doing they're their family
[33:24] Bible time and they've been looking at
[33:25] some of the video so I thought well
[33:27] thank the Lord it's helping people grow
[33:29] and Grayson and knowledge of the Lord
[33:30] one other family the mother said we
[33:32] watch your videos all the time while
[33:34] we're doing laundry I said that's a good
[33:36] thing to do is here just just always
[33:39] meditate upon the things of God always
[33:42] have the word of God or worship always
[33:44] have God on our hearts and minds now I
[33:47] want to just say this here now I teach
[33:52] that the first verse and some people
[33:54] don't some people don't teach this but I
[33:56] do teach that the first verse is the
[33:59] moment of the rapture because what
[34:00] brother Branham says here he said
[34:02] because the Seventh Seal There was
[34:03] silence and he says no one knew that was
[34:06] the minute or hour that Christ would
[34:08] come as he revealed it to us so program
[34:12] said it was already past tense that God
[34:16] revealed that the seventh seal was the
[34:19] day in the hour the very minute that
[34:21] Jesus Christ would come back for the
[34:23] bride so that's why I believe a
[34:25] revelation
[34:26] 8:1 is the rapture it is the moment
[34:30] where our bodies are changed in a moment
[34:32] and a twinkling of an eye I believe that
[34:34] but of course you know I'm not going to
[34:36] get an argument with people if they want
[34:38] to believe something else this just when
[34:41] I understand about it and now cook
[34:44] because earlier 1960 but Ram said and
[34:47] Jesus comes from heaven with ten
[34:49] thousand times ten thousand of saints
[34:50] and the Bible says the heaven was empty
[34:53] for a space of
[34:54] half hours there's that half hour
[34:55] silence again where's this big fellow
[34:58] God Anna hunt he said he's in Christ so
[35:01] when heavens empty and their silence in
[35:04] heaven in Revelation 8 1 I believe its
[35:06] Jesus's body his corporal body coming
[35:09] down to the skies to meet his wife in
[35:12] the air that's what I believe about
[35:13] Revelation 8 1 like I said I could be
[35:15] wrong but that's my thought on it
[35:17] because those quotes now let's look at
[35:20] verses 2 to 5 2 to 5 is the preparation
[35:24] for the seven trumpets to blow it's the
[35:28] preparation for them
[35:29] look at verse 2 so after the seventh
[35:32] seal opens then I saw the seven angels
[35:34] which stood before God and to them were
[35:37] given seven trumpets
[35:39] and another angel came and stood at the
[35:42] altar having a golden censer which of
[35:46] course we know is that the container
[35:47] that carried the incense right for the
[35:49] prayers or for the incense that would
[35:51] burn when the high priest would take
[35:53] that sensor you had to have that sensor
[35:55] and it had to be smoking before I could
[35:57] go into the Holies of Holies and there
[36:00] was given a name much incense that he
[36:02] should offer upon offer it with the
[36:05] prayers of all the saints upon the
[36:07] golden altar which was before the throne
[36:10] so there is a golden altar of incense
[36:12] before the throne of God in heaven amen
[36:16] remember there's a there's a rainbow
[36:17] round about that throne and there's four
[36:20] beasts there on that throne and there's
[36:22] four and twenty elders around that
[36:23] throne that's a pretty that's a pretty
[36:25] full throne don't you say hey there's a
[36:27] lot of the things there now seven angels
[36:30] come and stand before that throne and
[36:31] they get their trumpets ready to sound
[36:33] alright verse four and the smoke of the
[36:38] incense which came with the prayers of
[36:40] the Saints ascended up before God out of
[36:44] the Angels hand so now this incense is
[36:46] coming up out of the Angels hand so we
[36:49] know something's moving here something's
[36:51] happening here verse five and the angel
[36:55] took the censer and filled it with fire
[36:57] of the altar and cast it to the earth
[37:00] really strange here
[37:02] so heavenly fire now gets cast to the
[37:07] earth fire is gonna fall upon the earth
[37:11] interesting and this is before even the
[37:16] the trumpets have even blown yet which
[37:20] is pretty striking and I can't explain
[37:21] that I'm not even sure what that fire is
[37:23] right there but fire holy fire from
[37:26] heaven is sent down to earth after the
[37:29] Saints are raptured and there were
[37:32] voices and thunderings and lightnings
[37:34] and an earthquake now brother man told
[37:36] us what those I'll represent lightnings
[37:38] thunderings earthquake he said that
[37:40] represents judgment so this is a time of
[37:43] judgment right verse 6 I'm sorry let me
[37:46] stop it fine yeah let me 7/5 now I put
[37:50] some notes up here after a silence
[37:51] begins all the prayers of the Saints are
[37:54] being made ready to be answered so God
[37:57] is going to all these prayers are going
[37:59] to be poured out in heaven so all the
[38:01] things that people have been praying
[38:03] about all the things people are
[38:04] wondering about all the requests that
[38:07] have made known to God are now gonna be
[38:09] answered amen
[38:11] they're all gonna be answered praise God
[38:13] revelation bourree is the last time and
[38:17] I'm sorry 8:4 forgive me it's 8 for ya
[38:22] it's not for 8 it's 8 for revelation 8
[38:25] for is the last time the word prayers
[38:27] mentioned the Bible amen hallelujah and
[38:29] that great alright it's the last time
[38:32] this last time prayers mentioned is when
[38:34] all the prayers are going to be poured
[38:35] out before God in other words Jesus has
[38:38] stepped off the mercy seat he's coming
[38:41] got his wife and all those prayers are
[38:43] in heaven are now being poured out
[38:45] there's no more time for prayer right
[38:47] the Gentiles are cut off there's no more
[38:49] more mercy for them the foolish version
[38:51] they got to give their lives during the
[38:53] tribulation right but Jesus has left and
[38:56] now judgment is going to get poured out
[38:58] Jesus is meeting his wife in the air and
[39:01] heavens getting ready for the judgments
[39:03] there's lightnings thundering
[39:04] voices all the prayers are going to be
[39:06] answered think about it all those
[39:08] prayers from Abraham mine the job and
[39:11] and Moses all these prayers of the
[39:13] saints now after six thousand years
[39:15] they're all going to be answered God
[39:17] heard every one of them and he kept all
[39:19] of them
[39:20] and they're now gonna be answered amen
[39:21] what encouragement God here's all of our
[39:24] prayers amen
[39:25] God keeps him in these golden vials in
[39:28] heaven see are your prayers precious
[39:31] Church you bet he's putting them in
[39:33] golden containers but see you got to be
[39:36] what you got to be a saint because it's
[39:37] the prayers of the saints we don't want
[39:40] to be aints we want to be saved is that
[39:43] right but man said that woman that that
[39:45] you know married she'd been married to
[39:47] you four times she married a brother and
[39:48] brother and the brother said brother
[39:50] Branham you know God told me I could
[39:51] marry her brother man said no he said
[39:53] the devil gave you that dream he said
[39:54] that sure sounds sweet but God didn't
[39:56] tell you to marry her she's already
[39:57] married three or four times and programs
[39:59] tried to tell the man he said because
[40:01] the man said oh she's a saint
[40:02] and brother branham said not if she's
[40:04] been married three or four times she's
[40:06] not a saint
[40:06] she's a hain't or she's a ain't she's
[40:09] not a saint because anyone who lives in
[40:12] pleasure while they're alive are dead
[40:14] while they live amen and the only hope
[40:17] they have is that the white throne
[40:19] judgment that Jesus would pull up and
[40:22] say oh you did something good enter into
[40:24] the joys of the Lord because you treated
[40:25] a Christian good oh I'm the one that
[40:28] he's surprised at the day of judgment I
[40:30] want to know what's gonna happen to me
[40:31] praise God
[40:32] I won't let my slate clean I want all my
[40:34] sins forgiven because there's gonna come
[40:36] a time when the Lightning of thundering
[40:38] is gonna be ushering in heaven and all I
[40:41] want to be with Jesus during that time
[40:43] amen I don't want to be left behind
[40:45] I want garments that are white praise
[40:47] God amen oh my oh and as I was saying on
[40:54] Sunday this my wife and I were just
[40:55] talking did you catch it on Sunday I
[40:57] don't know if you got a chance to
[40:58] livestream our service or not but sexual
[41:00] sin and marriage was so important to God
[41:03] that in the Old Testament
[41:05] remember God wouldn't let these bastards
[41:08] into the church for 10 10 10 generations
[41:13] that's how important it is to live pure
[41:16] sexually before God and before you make
[41:19] a decision on marriage as I tell the
[41:21] young people cuz it'll just be a blink
[41:22] of an eye and they'll be getting ready
[41:23] to get married here as sad as that is as
[41:27] hard as that is to believe but keep
[41:30] yourself pure make sure it's the will of
[41:33] God
[41:34] when you get married amen because God is
[41:36] gonna hold us accountable for these
[41:38] decisions and it's so important praise
[41:40] God that we make sure we do what God has
[41:43] called us to do amen but the last time
[41:46] prayers' mentioned is here when the
[41:47] prayers are being poured out did you
[41:50] know we're gonna get to this did you
[41:51] know that heaven is rejoicing while the
[41:54] Vatican's being destroyed did you know
[41:56] that church it makes me want to cry
[41:58] that's it reread that revelation or you
[42:00] can get ahead of me a little bit but the
[42:02] Bible said the Saints and the angels are
[42:04] rejoicing in heaven while the Vatican's
[42:07] being destroyed because of all the
[42:09] idolatry the wickedness did I tell you I
[42:12] found an article two weeks ago remember
[42:15] in Pennsylvania when they had that
[42:17] investigation last year and a thousand
[42:20] people were reported as being abused by
[42:22] the priests in Pennsylvania shortly
[42:24] after that I found another article now
[42:25] people are coming forward that the nuns
[42:27] abused them sexually girls and boys and
[42:32] so what they find is that the deeper
[42:34] they dig the more they get in there the
[42:36] more evils in there and churches so
[42:39] incredibly sad but what does that
[42:41] produce what the the DNA of the church
[42:44] is is is corrupted right they're not
[42:47] believing on the promises of God and
[42:50] because of that any little sin any
[42:52] unbelief like the Trinity or any trend
[42:55] transubstantiation any of those little
[42:57] beliefs in eventually when they accept
[42:59] that lie they accept other lies and the
[43:02] end of sin is death amen that's right
[43:06] the church as time goes on we see more
[43:09] and more and more
[43:09] all these seekers Jesus and every seeker
[43:11] will be shot it from the housetop and
[43:13] it's no wonder that the saints in heaven
[43:15] will be rejoicing when destruction is
[43:18] going on it's hard for us to understand
[43:20] because church we don't really have
[43:22] divine love fully all the time do we
[43:24] like brother and said we have human
[43:26] compassion but we don't have divine
[43:28] compassion all the time I know that's
[43:31] hard it's hard for me to understand I I
[43:32] have trouble with that too
[43:34] so the last time prayers mentioned is
[43:37] right here 8 verse 4 the smoke of the
[43:41] incense which came up with the prayers
[43:43] of the Saints that sent up before God
[43:44] out of the angel
[43:46] and mercy look at revelation 85 and the
[43:50] angel took the censer filled with fire
[43:52] of the altar and cast into the earth and
[43:55] there were voices thunderings and
[43:57] lightnings an earthquake now I want to
[43:58] look up some more verses about voices
[44:00] and thunders so as I said heavenly fire
[44:05] is cast to the earth after the rapture
[44:08] I'm not sure what that is because it's
[44:11] before the trumpets there's fire
[44:13] involved with the trumpets but I'm not
[44:14] sure what this fire is but the Bible
[44:16] said they took the fire from the altar
[44:17] and it was cast to the earth so they're
[44:20] gonna be some type of burning even
[44:22] before the trumpets now we see these
[44:27] same words in Revelation 11 9 this is
[44:29] under the seventh and final trumpet
[44:32] which remember there's even worse things
[44:34] after that with the seven vials the
[44:36] trumpets are before the vials right so
[44:40] under the seventh and final trumpet
[44:41] there's both voices and thunderings just
[44:43] like a revelation eight five and the
[44:45] Temple of God was opened in heaven there
[44:47] was seen this temple the Ark of his
[44:48] Testament and there were lightnings
[44:50] voices and thunderings in the earthquake
[44:52] and great hail remember revelation 11 19
[44:57] is right after the three I'm sorry the
[44:59] two witnesses are raptured up to heaven
[45:01] we'll get to a little bit more on that
[45:03] so we see all these times where there's
[45:05] lightnings thunderings and voices it's
[45:07] always judgment it's always God pouring
[45:10] out his wrath upon unbelievers we see
[45:13] the same thing in revelation 16 verses
[45:15] 17 and 18 when the seventh angel poured
[45:18] out his vial here's the seventh vial
[45:19] into the air and there came a great
[45:22] voice out of the Temple of Heaven from
[45:23] the throne saying it is done and there
[45:25] were voices and thunderings and
[45:27] lightnings and there was a great
[45:28] earthquake such as not since men were
[45:30] upon the earth so mighty an earthquake
[45:31] and so great that might be the Los
[45:33] Angeles one we're not I'm not sure now
[45:36] under the seventh this has the same with
[45:39] both voices and thunderings as
[45:40] revelation 85 so again we see this on we
[45:44] see under the seventh trumpet and we see
[45:46] it under the seventh vial which is just
[45:49] afterwards one after right after the
[45:50] other
[45:52] and we see it won't
[45:54] our time now look at this this is this
[45:56] applies to us now revelation 19 and the
[45:59] voice came out of the throne saying
[46:00] praise our God all ye servants didn't
[46:02] either fear Him both small and great and
[46:04] I heard as it were the voice of a great
[46:06] multitude and the voice of many waters
[46:08] and the voice of many thunderings saying
[46:09] Alleluia
[46:10] for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let
[46:13] us be glad and rejoice and give honour
[46:15] to him for the marriage the lamb has
[46:17] come and his wife has made herself ready
[46:19] I so heaven is rejoicing because his
[46:24] wife has made herself ready ha ha
[46:26] Alleluia remember that in Hebrews 11
[46:29] church that the Saints cannot be
[46:32] perfected or completed until we're
[46:35] completed
[46:35] that's three - you got your Bibles go to
[46:37] Hebrews 11 in other words they're
[46:39] waiting on us of course there have
[46:43] entered into eternity a little bit but
[46:46] still they're waiting upon us they the
[46:49] body of Christ cannot be complete until
[46:51] every member is there even had their way
[46:55] to go on us Alleluia
[46:56] that's right the end of Hebrews 11 here
[47:03] yeah now now let's go to verse 38 1138
[47:09] of whom the world was not worthy of all
[47:11] these persecuted Saints we looked at
[47:13] persecution last week they wandered in
[47:15] deserts and in mountains and in dens in
[47:17] the caves of the earth and these all
[47:19] having obtained a good report through
[47:21] faith received not the promise God
[47:24] having provided some better thing for us
[47:26] that they which without us should not be
[47:29] made perfect so all these Old Testament
[47:34] heroes they never receive the fullness
[47:37] of the promise so what's he saying the
[47:39] promise of course is the baptism of the
[47:41] Holy Ghost
[47:42] Colossians 1 said that's the promise
[47:44] that's been hidden for ages
[47:46] it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[47:48] amen so we have something so great
[47:51] we're not greater than David but we
[47:53] should have greater power than David
[47:55] amen that we can slay the temptation of
[47:58] adultery or fornication
[48:00] he couldn't slay that but we should have
[48:02] the power to slay it amen who would you
[48:05] rather slay a giant this song Goliath
[48:08] all
[48:08] way up here or would you rather slay the
[48:11] demon of adultery hallelujah or the
[48:14] demon of murder the demon of lust which
[48:16] one would you rather slay
[48:17] I'd rather slay that spiritual enemy
[48:19] hallelujah because my bat is not with
[48:22] flesh and blood it's against spiritual
[48:25] wickedness in high places and God makes
[48:27] us put on the full armor of God that we
[48:30] can be overcomers amen
[48:32] but see they can't be made perfect
[48:35] without us the body of Christ cannot be
[48:38] complete until that we are there as well
[48:41] amen see that they kept me made perfect
[48:45] without us we can't be a complete body
[48:47] until we're all together praise the Lord
[48:50] hallelujah now I looked up lightening an
[48:53] earthquake as well the second woe the
[48:58] Bible says in Revelation 11:14 is past
[49:02] and behold the third woe cometh quickly
[49:04] and the seventh angel sounded this is
[49:07] the seventh trumpet and there are voices
[49:08] in heaven saying the kingdoms of this
[49:10] world to become the kingdom of our Lord
[49:11] and of his Christ and he shall reign
[49:13] forever alright now the next one yeah
[49:16] the next versus okay already read this
[49:18] one right
[49:19] yeah the temple of God was open there
[49:21] was lightnings in the earthquake after
[49:22] the seventh trumpet so the seventh
[49:25] trumpet is connected to the third woe
[49:26] and also to the seventh vial they're all
[49:29] connected because they have these
[49:31] lightnings thunderings
[49:32] earthquakes it's it's in other words its
[49:35] judgment at the throne of God that's
[49:38] right now let's get your let's go back
[49:41] to Revelation 86 here
[49:42] revelation 86 I was in Hebrews 11 let's
[49:44] go back to Revelation 86
[49:51] oh don't you want to be on Jesus's side
[49:54] Church during this yeah when I we're not
[49:56] read this brothers and sisters it just
[49:58] shakes me when I read this to see this
[49:59] is what God is gonna do to those people
[50:01] who won't they just won't repent the
[50:04] Bible said still while the while they're
[50:06] hiding in caves they still repent of
[50:08] worshiping idols and statues and you
[50:11] name it money and all these things and
[50:12] sex and all these things that they're
[50:14] worshiping they still won't repent how
[50:16] blessed you are if you can just say
[50:18] Jesus forgive me change my life help me
[50:22] to never do that sin again amen
[50:24] how blessed you are because these people
[50:26] will not do it
[50:28] they won't even apologize even the myths
[50:31] of sing all the plagues follow the hail
[50:33] fall the earthquakes the lightning they
[50:35] go hide and run in their in their
[50:37] endtime caves or whatever they have
[50:39] right our last days where they got food
[50:42] stored up in water what good is that
[50:43] gonna do that when the Bible said the
[50:46] face of the Lamb is gonna be staring
[50:47] right at them amen
[50:48] what good is that it won't do any good
[50:51] the thing to do is look in his face
[50:53] right now I say Jesus I love you forgive
[50:55] me hey that's the thing to do is being
[50:58] peace with Christ right now 8 6 and the
[51:02] 7 angels which had the seven trumpets
[51:04] prepared themselves to sound now from 6
[51:08] down to 13 is the first four trumpets so
[51:13] let's look at these here for just a
[51:14] moment now I just want to make sure I
[51:16] put this I tried to change the colors a
[51:18] little bit because remember brother
[51:19] Branham when he preached the Feast of
[51:21] the trumpets he said they that he was
[51:23] not preaching the seven trumpets the
[51:26] Feast of Trumpets are not the seven
[51:28] trumpets tonight I'm preaching the seven
[51:31] trumpets tonight okay so he says the
[51:35] Feast of Trumpets are two prophets
[51:37] calling Israel to the feast that's what
[51:39] brother Graham said and this is
[51:41] different than the seven trumpets it's
[51:45] different so here's what I mean this
[51:48] right here is the Feast of Trumpets and
[51:51] on the spiritual timeline this was
[51:53] Pentecost the day of Pentecost here we
[51:55] are we're right here right before this
[51:57] arrow we are right at the coming of the
[51:58] Lord and the Feast of Trumpets begins
[52:02] the three feast the Day of Atonement and
[52:04] the Tabernacles
[52:05] now program said this is the two
[52:06] prophets calling Israel to love Christ
[52:09] the Day of Atonement is where Jesus
[52:11] Christ Himself reveals himself to the
[52:14] 144,000 right and they're forgiven and
[52:17] they get the baptism Holy Ghost and the
[52:19] Feast of Tabernacles that's all of us in
[52:21] the Millennium amen hallelujah Israel
[52:24] gets a build houses I believe we'll be
[52:26] with our husband Christ amen amen
[52:29] so now you know prophetically so the
[52:32] rapture is right here the Feast of
[52:34] Trumpets is the the three-and-a-half
[52:36] year Ministry of the two prophets
[52:38] calling them the Day of Atonement is
[52:40] 144,000 being born again and Tabernacles
[52:43] is the last one that's the millennium
[52:45] amen because buh-bam says now in the
[52:49] homeland waiting for the Feast of
[52:52] Trumpets or the recognizing the
[52:55] atonement and to wait for the for the
[52:57] coming to mourn for their rejection of
[53:00] the first time that they rejected it
[53:02] they're in the homeland for that waiting
[53:05] what are they all everything is
[53:08] positionally placed now look what
[53:09] brother who says now I hope this doesn't
[53:11] confuse you but there's quotes her
[53:12] brother Ram says on both sides in some
[53:15] quotes he says that the feast some of
[53:16] the trumpets have already blown and then
[53:18] quotes like this he says they're still
[53:20] waiting on the Feast of Trumpets so just
[53:23] so you know I'm not saying I've got all
[53:25] the answers
[53:26] I'm not patting myself on the back and
[53:27] say if I've gotten greater revelation
[53:28] and all these preachers out here I'm not
[53:30] saying that what I'm saying is that to
[53:32] us these chapters here are actually
[53:35] minors that's why I thought I'd get
[53:36] through two chapters tonight because
[53:37] they're not the major ones the major
[53:39] ones are the first six chapters of
[53:43] Revelation those are the major ones
[53:44] because if we miss that we're going to
[53:46] miss all the other ones program says you
[53:49] got to know the church ages first then
[53:51] you know the seals then the trumpets and
[53:53] the vials and everything like that
[53:54] thereafter so see this is not our major
[53:56] but we got to preach it so we can be
[53:59] prepared amen so here bear says they're
[54:03] waiting for the Feast of Trumpets that
[54:05] that to me means the first one hasn't
[54:07] even blown yet now here's three reasons
[54:11] while I don't even think the trumpets
[54:13] have not yet sounded and now here's the
[54:16] ears here's the funny thing
[54:18] I have quotes on this side that let's
[54:20] say the trumpets have it sounded well
[54:22] you had you can find quotes that say the
[54:24] trumpets have sounded but I believe
[54:28] personally that they've not sounded okay
[54:31] if you listen to a feast of the trumpets
[54:33] though you're in here brother branham
[54:34] say that some of them have sounded now
[54:36] they may have but I just believe from
[54:39] some of the other quotes he has that
[54:43] they have it sounded okay so there's
[54:44] every understand I'm not saying I'm
[54:46] smarter I know anything about it this is
[54:48] just the only way I can see that it
[54:49] actually meant to me it makes sense okay
[54:51] but I could be wrong but either way
[54:53] Church if you're in the if you're born
[54:54] again the Holy Ghost you're not going to
[54:55] see any of those trumpets amen how do
[54:58] you know yeah that's the main thing the
[55:00] main thing is have the token and then
[55:02] you've got the ticket to know
[55:03] everything's going to be all right amen
[55:05] Gloria now the first reason is program
[55:09] said over and over again the two
[55:11] prophets call Israel to the feast of the
[55:13] trumpets and the two prophets haven't
[55:15] even arrived yet
[55:16] so how can all the other trumpets sound
[55:18] if they haven't even started calling the
[55:21] trumpets yet because they have to call
[55:23] Israel to the feast of the trumpets and
[55:28] here's her brother ham said it I'm not
[55:29] I'm not gonna inject any of my thoughts
[55:31] I'm just showing that there's honestly
[55:33] quotes on both sides and that's why I
[55:36] just I go on this side where I don't
[55:38] think the trumpets have sounded yet as
[55:40] administer the gospel I can't see one
[55:42] thing left but the going of the bride
[55:44] and the bride has to be taken away
[55:45] before they can recognize what's
[55:47] happened they were bound scattered I
[55:48] mean they were scatter blinded and now
[55:50] gathered speaking of the Jews what's
[55:52] left the bride to be taken another way
[55:54] waiting for the going of the brides of
[55:56] their prophets of revelation 11 can call
[55:58] them to the feast of the trumpet to make
[56:00] them recognize what they haven't I'm
[56:03] sure what they have done everybody who
[56:06] says Israel or the bride won't be here
[56:08] during the sixth seal so these two
[56:11] prophets call the trumpets or gather
[56:14] them for the trumpets right and then the
[56:18] bride won't be here during that sixth
[56:20] seal then we have then I don't believe
[56:21] the trumpets have sounded yet because
[56:23] they can't even sound until after the
[56:25] bride's gone and then the two prophets
[56:26] arrive you see these things that were
[56:30] now in that we're studying right
[56:32] now the sixth seal is after the church
[56:34] is gone see these things are the
[56:36] Tribulation Period I think that ought to
[56:38] be selling to every believers heart that
[56:40] this church never takes a tribulation
[56:41] period you cannot put the church in
[56:43] tribulation or the bride now you see
[56:47] we're close to that hour now it could be
[56:48] any time because the church is just
[56:50] about ready to take its flight amen but
[56:52] remember when these things happen the
[56:54] sixth seal the bride won't be here
[56:57] just remember the bride's gone she'll
[56:59] have to go through any of at the time
[57:00] this is a time of tribulation of
[57:02] purification of the church it's put upon
[57:04] her to go through it but not the bride
[57:06] he takes his sweetheart
[57:07] out of the way he's done redeemed her
[57:10] thank of the Lord amen that's the first
[57:13] reason mother man says let me go back
[57:16] there the first reason I want to mix it
[57:18] up the two prophets call them to the
[57:20] trumpets and the two prophets haven't
[57:22] even arrived yet so how can the trumpet
[57:24] sound when they haven't been called to
[57:26] the Feast of the trumpets all right
[57:29] number two every trumpet sounds under
[57:32] the sixth seal my brother Adam says it's
[57:34] over and over again and then in the same
[57:37] sermon he says some of the trumpets have
[57:39] sounded so I'm just doing the best I can
[57:42] and remember that 60 we're all seven
[57:46] trumpet sounds under that sixth seal
[57:48] when we get to that then you'll see
[57:51] every seven trumpet took place in that
[57:54] sixth seal ok says it pretty plainly now
[57:58] let me say right here that every Trumper
[58:00] that blow blowed under the sixth seal
[58:04] we'll get to that in a few minutes where
[58:06] we caught it on the tape all the
[58:07] trumpets sounded under the sixth seal he
[58:11] said but every trumpet sounded under the
[58:12] sixth seal under the persecution of the
[58:14] Jews all right so can everybody see that
[58:17] it looks like all the trumpets are under
[58:20] that sixth seal
[58:21] well the sixth seal doesn't happen until
[58:22] the two prophets come on the scene and
[58:24] interrupts nature so how can the the
[58:28] trumpets have sounded yet when the
[58:29] tribulation hasn't happened yet and he
[58:32] says they all blow or they all sound
[58:34] under that sixth seal so that's my
[58:38] second reason I don't think any of the
[58:39] trumpets have blown yet woes and
[58:42] trumpets take place during the last
[58:43] three and a half years so
[58:45] says it's repeatedly that the woes and
[58:48] trumpets take place in the last half of
[58:50] Daniels 70th week remember a week is
[58:53] seven years Jesus Christ started
[58:56] preaching he preached three and a half
[58:57] years and that was the first half of the
[59:00] 70th week there was 69 weeks and then
[59:02] Jesus Christ started preaching he
[59:04] preached three and a half years that was
[59:06] the first half of the love the last 70th
[59:09] week so this is in 1961 I'm gonna skip
[59:13] down here see he says we must stop and
[59:18] explain why these 70 weeks because if
[59:20] you don't you'll miss those seals you'll
[59:22] miss the trumpets you'll miss the vows
[59:23] those plagues those three unclean
[59:25] spirits like frogs those three woes the
[59:28] casting out of the red dragon the woman
[59:29] the son you'll miss it off you don't
[59:31] call if you don't cause it takes place
[59:33] right here in this 70th week and
[59:36] remember right now we're in the time of
[59:38] the church ages so the 70 weeks of
[59:40] Daniel our pause there on pause God put
[59:43] it hit the pause button praise God God
[59:45] pause that he's pulling out a Gentile
[59:47] bride to himself once he takes her in
[59:49] the air that he's gonna hit unpause now
[59:54] in closing the seven seals the seven
[59:56] trumpets seven by oh three woes woman
[59:58] the sun casting on the devil the red
[1:00:00] dragon comes between these times during
[1:00:03] the Great Tribulation Period don't
[1:00:05] forget it he says so to me the trumpets
[1:00:10] can't even blow until it's the
[1:00:12] Tribulation Period that's what I
[1:00:14] understand but you have quotes and
[1:00:16] mother RAM says both and in Revelation
[1:00:19] 11th chapter these two prophets they
[1:00:21] prophesy 1203 and threescore days 3 and
[1:00:25] 1/2 years still promised to Israel when
[1:00:27] the Gentile bride is gone so as long as
[1:00:30] the bride is here they're still three
[1:00:31] and a half years left to the the Jew and
[1:00:34] it's not gonna start until the bride is
[1:00:36] gone now this is what I believe is a
[1:00:42] misapplication
[1:00:43] I believe the
[1:00:47] trumpet takes place after the sealing of
[1:00:50] the 144,000 okay
[1:00:53] so let's read the fifth trumpet you got
[1:00:55] your Bibles let's go to Revelation nine
[1:01:14] all right
[1:01:17] so let's go to Revelation 9 now I want
[1:01:19] to look at let's look at verse 2 and he
[1:01:21] opened the bottomless pit and there
[1:01:22] arose a smoke out of the pit as the
[1:01:24] smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and
[1:01:26] the air were darkened by reason of the
[1:01:27] smoke of the pit and there came out of
[1:01:30] the smoke locusts upon the earth and
[1:01:32] unto them was given power as Scorpions
[1:01:35] of the earth have power it was commanded
[1:01:37] them that they should not hurt the grass
[1:01:38] to the earth neither any green thing
[1:01:40] neither any tree but only those men
[1:01:43] which have not the seal of God in their
[1:01:45] foreheads and to them it was given that
[1:01:48] they should not kill them but that they
[1:01:50] should be tormented 5 months and their
[1:01:52] torment was as the torment of a scorpion
[1:01:53] when he striketh a man all right so this
[1:02:01] is the night I'm sorry this is the fifth
[1:02:03] trumpet and these demons come out like
[1:02:05] scorpions and they torment people for
[1:02:08] five months now let's look at this here
[1:02:11] since the fifth trumpet hasn't sounded
[1:02:14] yet although many think it has because
[1:02:17] one quote us where brother Branham said
[1:02:20] the woes are World War one in World War
[1:02:22] two all right so there's one quote where
[1:02:28] brother Branham said the first woe is
[1:02:30] World War one the second woe is World
[1:02:32] War two and then he makes a like a
[1:02:33] statement that the third woe is World
[1:02:36] War three that's kind of what he makes
[1:02:37] it sound like now go to Revelation 9
[1:02:46] 12:1 woe is past and behold there come
[1:02:49] two woes more Hereafter
[1:02:51] ok so this is what we're saying here so
[1:02:58] do you catch it the first woe is after
[1:03:01] the fifth trumpet is everybody catch
[1:03:02] that and what do they do they torment
[1:03:05] everybody who doesn't have the baptism
[1:03:07] of the Holy Ghost so this is why I don't
[1:03:11] believe the first woe is World War 1
[1:03:13] because if the First World War was World
[1:03:16] War 1 then that means this would already
[1:03:17] be in the past the Scorpions already
[1:03:19] came out for five months and they stung
[1:03:21] everybody who didn't have the baptism of
[1:03:23] Holy Ghost at church I just don't I
[1:03:25] don't I don't see that I can't see any
[1:03:27] time where you know they had cameras
[1:03:29] during World War one
[1:03:30] yeah world war 1 right so I can't think
[1:03:35] of any history that proves that
[1:03:37] scorpions came out during World War 1 ok
[1:03:41] for 5 months I just don't see that but
[1:03:44] that's just my opinion that's just my
[1:03:46] thought I could be wrong so see I don't
[1:03:48] believe the 5th trumpet is sounded yet
[1:03:50] because I just don't believe it because
[1:03:53] the prophets haven't come yet and
[1:03:55] because we there's no record of anybody
[1:03:57] being stung for five months I just when
[1:04:00] I believe Church brother branham said
[1:04:02] the lows were World War one too in 1954
[1:04:05] and he never said it after the seals or
[1:04:07] anything it was just a one time
[1:04:08] statement but P there's certain people
[1:04:11] I've heard them preaching the message
[1:04:12] which that's fine they're allowed to
[1:04:14] their entire their own interpretation
[1:04:15] I'm not exalting myself above them but I
[1:04:18] don't see how it makes sense because the
[1:04:20] FIR if the first woe was World War 1
[1:04:22] then where were the scorpions where
[1:04:25] where's the history proving that that
[1:04:26] for five months everybody without the
[1:04:28] back Holy Ghost was scorpion it was ever
[1:04:32] I understand that so I don't see how the
[1:04:34] fish C or fifth trumpet could already
[1:04:35] blow and if if World War if it took
[1:04:39] place during World War one and there's
[1:04:40] no record of scorpions stinking
[1:04:42] everybody without the Holy Ghost
[1:04:44] all right so hope that's clear I know
[1:04:47] we're getting little we're getting down
[1:04:48] pretty deep aren't we
[1:04:49] you're pretty deep in these but advanced
[1:04:53] again you get up to your elbows and
[1:04:55] honey I've never really got up to my
[1:04:59] ankles and honey ever before but I got
[1:05:01] up to my ankles and snow this week but
[1:05:04] but not honey but when your the things
[1:05:06] of God is like honey you're after
[1:05:07] yellows and honey I know we're pretty
[1:05:09] deep but I'm just trying to rightly
[1:05:11] divide it to you now see Bob Arum says
[1:05:13] here's the quote here now look church is
[1:05:14] 19 and 50 for the RAM says the first one
[1:05:18] see there's three woes the first one
[1:05:20] happened in World War one the second one
[1:05:22] happened in World War two so you see
[1:05:24] what we're going in now we're at the end
[1:05:25] time
[1:05:26] now remember Rome and ER
[1:05:29] that this after this said it again but
[1:05:31] people will hang on this quote they'll
[1:05:32] make everywhere does say the Lord I
[1:05:33] believe that's wrong Church I've said
[1:05:35] preach out before I'll be let's make it
[1:05:37] I do out of brother branham I believe
[1:05:38] that's fear and I believe that's a sin
[1:05:40] that if that sin lays in someone's life
[1:05:42] that that false interpretation it will
[1:05:44] produce other sins in their life that's
[1:05:46] what I believe because any unconfessed
[1:05:49] sin will ultimately lead to death if
[1:05:50] it's unconfessed that's what I believe I
[1:05:53] could be wrong but that's what I believe
[1:05:55] so if you think this quote is true that
[1:05:58] you're welcome to believe that I'm not
[1:05:59] trying to discourage your faith but that
[1:06:02] means because the first woe is
[1:06:05] revelation 912 then you have to show
[1:06:08] somehow through history that verses 1 to
[1:06:11] 11 happen during a five-month period
[1:06:13] during the world war 1 you have to prove
[1:06:15] that ok and I just can't
[1:06:19] I've looked I've tried I've looked into
[1:06:21] history I can't prove that that God
[1:06:25] protected only the Holy Ghost filled
[1:06:27] what year did that end wasn't a 1918
[1:06:29] mauka I didn't World War 1 ok so you
[1:06:32] have like a lot of history you could go
[1:06:33] when it start in 1915 14 ok so you have
[1:06:37] of 1914-1918 have four years there and a
[1:06:42] five-month period from 1914 to 1918 this
[1:06:46] would have to be fulfilled
[1:06:47] scorpions had to come out of the earth
[1:06:49] and sting everybody without the baptism
[1:06:51] the Holy Ghost okay so I hope everybody
[1:06:55] just trying to understand I'm just
[1:06:56] trying to make it as plain as possible
[1:06:58] tonight this makes sense Church okay all
[1:07:03] right now recall the first trumpet let
[1:07:06] alone the fifth
[1:07:07] cannot sound until after the 144,000 are
[1:07:11] sealed by the Holy Ghost so this is
[1:07:13] another proof not only do I see how the
[1:07:16] fifth seal could not have sounded or the
[1:07:18] fifth trumpet rather the first trumpet
[1:07:21] can't even sound until the 144,000 are
[1:07:23] born again and that's in Revelation 7 we
[1:07:28] preached this a few weeks ago remember
[1:07:31] he said hurt not the earth and then
[1:07:33] they're gonna seal 144,000 with the seal
[1:07:36] of the Living God
[1:07:36] hurt not the earth the trees till we
[1:07:38] have sealed 104 sealed the servants of
[1:07:41] God in their foreheads
[1:07:42] the first trumpet can't even blow until
[1:07:44] the 144,000 are born again so how can
[1:07:48] the fifth trumpet have already blown
[1:07:50] when the first one hasn't blown yet
[1:07:52] because there they go in order and the
[1:07:57] hundred 44,000 aren't even on the scene
[1:07:58] yet because the two prophets aren't on
[1:08:00] the scene yet because the bride's still
[1:08:01] here amen
[1:08:03] so see I just I just disagree humbly I
[1:08:06] just try to be humble and remember a
[1:08:09] revelation 8:7
[1:08:10] it's under the grass trees are hurt
[1:08:14] during the first trumpet which would be
[1:08:16] after the 144,000 are sealed the first
[1:08:19] trumpet can't even blow until the
[1:08:21] 144,000 are sealed then the earth a
[1:08:24] third part of the trees are burned up
[1:08:26] and then all the green grass is burnt up
[1:08:29] can you imagine that nothing about that
[1:08:30] church what was the last time you looked
[1:08:32] at Google Maps did you look at Google
[1:08:33] Earth lately and see all the green all
[1:08:35] over the world all the green grass is
[1:08:38] burnt up under the first trumpet all of
[1:08:40] it can you imagine that all the green
[1:08:45] grass so the whole world is going to
[1:08:48] look like this a hare desert from Google
[1:08:50] Earth and that's just the first trumpet
[1:08:53] and some people are saying well the
[1:08:55] fifth trumpet already sounded you know
[1:08:57] the locusts are out the world is World
[1:08:58] War one not all the green grass was
[1:09:02] burnt up in World War one Church there's
[1:09:05] pictures to prove it so see it just to
[1:09:08] me I just I can't make eye
[1:09:10] I just think brother Branham was just he
[1:09:11] was just doing his best and then of
[1:09:13] course he never said later cuz it wasn't
[1:09:15] I don't leave it was God's revelation
[1:09:18] revelation 9:1 and the fifth angel
[1:09:20] sounded I saw a star fall from heaven
[1:09:22] unto the earth and to him was given the
[1:09:24] key the bottomless pit and it was
[1:09:26] commanded then that they should not hurt
[1:09:28] the grass of the earth neither any green
[1:09:30] thing neither any tree but all only
[1:09:33] those men which have not the seal of God
[1:09:35] in their foreheads that's under the
[1:09:37] fifth trumpet so it looks like if
[1:09:39] there's all the grasses burned under the
[1:09:41] first and then here it says hurtin off
[1:09:44] the grass of the earth or there must be
[1:09:45] some green things left because the Bible
[1:09:49] said don't hurt the grass nor any green
[1:09:50] thing there still must be some green
[1:09:52] thing left even on the fifth trumpet
[1:09:56] but all the grass was burnt under the
[1:09:57] first trumpet interesting all right now
[1:10:01] the second implication is the sixth
[1:10:04] trumpet containing the woes has not
[1:10:08] sounded yet okay so the sixth trumpet
[1:10:11] let's go to revelation 9 is a 6th
[1:10:12] trumpet
[1:10:13] now here's what I found by reading the
[1:10:16] Word of God the first woe is under the
[1:10:18] fifth trumpet the second was under the
[1:10:19] sixth trumpet and the third woe is under
[1:10:22] the seventh trumpet that's what I can
[1:10:23] find in Scripture
[1:10:26] alright now let's look at the sixth
[1:10:29] trumpet here now go to verse 13 and the
[1:10:37] sixth angel sounded I heard a voice from
[1:10:38] the four horns of the golden altar which
[1:10:40] is before God saying to the six angels
[1:10:43] have the choice the four angels which
[1:10:44] are bound in the great river Euphrates
[1:10:46] on that ought to make a little bell go
[1:10:48] off you've heard that before the angels
[1:10:52] in the river Euphrates right the demons
[1:10:54] in the river Euphrates right what
[1:10:57] message was that from Feast of the
[1:10:58] trumpets now and the four angels were
[1:11:02] loosed which were prepared for an hour
[1:11:04] and for a day and for a month and four
[1:11:05] year for to slay the third part of men
[1:11:08] so when these demons get loose of third
[1:11:11] of the men now the population is 7.2
[1:11:15] billion right now so what's the third of
[1:11:17] that right it's over two billion people
[1:11:20] so when these demons are loosed on the
[1:11:23] river Euphrates - over two million
[1:11:25] people die now look at verse 16 and the
[1:11:32] number of the army the horsemen were two
[1:11:34] hundred thousand thousand and I heard
[1:11:36] the number of them now Church I'm not
[1:11:41] being critical a brother branham please
[1:11:44] understand me I'm not but I just if you
[1:11:47] listen to the Feast of Trumpets brother
[1:11:49] Branham said that these demons have
[1:11:50] already been loosed and they were loosed
[1:11:52] upon the Jews now that may be I'm not
[1:11:56] I'm not saying for sure but remember
[1:11:58] this is under the sixth trumpet and if
[1:12:03] we just
[1:12:03] how v hasn't been opened yet nor the
[1:12:05] first the first can't even blow into her
[1:12:07] the 144,000 get the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:09] Ghost so I'm just saying many think the
[1:12:14] second woe which was the Second World
[1:12:15] War
[1:12:16] and the 200 million demons have been
[1:12:18] loosed but it just doesn't seem possible
[1:12:20] to me because the first one hasn't even
[1:12:23] happened yet the first trumpet can't
[1:12:25] even blow yet until the bride goes a to
[1:12:28] trip retreat or trooper two prophets
[1:12:30] arrived then 144,000 get the Holy Ghost
[1:12:32] now the first trumpet came blow that's
[1:12:35] just me
[1:12:35] I could be wrong so revelation 8 6 to 13
[1:12:41] was the first four trumpets now let's
[1:12:43] read that let's go back and read that
[1:12:44] let's go to verse revelation eight six
[1:12:50] okay and the seven angels which had the
[1:12:53] seven trumpets prepared themselves to
[1:12:54] sound the first angel sounded and there
[1:12:56] followed hail and fire mingled with
[1:12:58] blood and they were cast upon the earth
[1:13:00] and the third part of the trees was
[1:13:01] burnt up and all the green grass was
[1:13:03] burnt up that's the first trumpet all
[1:13:05] green grass has to be burnt up verse a
[1:13:11] and the second angel sounded and as it
[1:13:12] were a great mountain burning with fire
[1:13:14] was cast in the sea and the third part
[1:13:16] of the sea became blood so a third part
[1:13:18] of the oceans right became blood under
[1:13:23] the second trumpet now some people like
[1:13:26] I said I already said the fifth sounded
[1:13:27] and then the six so that this has
[1:13:31] already happened to them a third a third
[1:13:35] of the ocean has been blood and it's
[1:13:37] never been taking a picture of I I just
[1:13:41] can't I I can't understand that verse
[1:13:44] verse nine and the third part of the
[1:13:47] creatures which were in the sea and had
[1:13:48] life died and the third part of the
[1:13:49] ships were destroyed some people say
[1:13:52] this already happened I just don't I
[1:13:54] can't see it I don't think it has yet
[1:13:55] because I don't think the hundred
[1:13:57] forty-four thousand Jews have been
[1:13:58] sealed by the Holy Ghost yet that's just
[1:13:59] my opinion alright verse 10 and the
[1:14:02] third angel sounded and there fell a
[1:14:03] great star from heaven burning as it
[1:14:05] were a lamp and it fell upon the third
[1:14:06] part of the waters and upon the
[1:14:08] Fountains of waters and the name of the
[1:14:10] star is called wormwood and the third
[1:14:11] part of the waters became wormwood and
[1:14:13] many men died of the waters because they
[1:14:15] were made bitter
[1:14:17] that was the third trumpet and the
[1:14:21] fourth trumpet sound in the third part
[1:14:22] of the Sun was smitten and the third
[1:14:24] part of the moon and third part of the
[1:14:26] stars so as the third part of them was
[1:14:28] darkened and the day shone not a third
[1:14:30] part of it and the night likewise that's
[1:14:32] the fourth trumpet so some people leave
[1:14:35] this already happened well when was the
[1:14:36] time where a third of the sunlight was
[1:14:38] missing I don't know and I beheld and
[1:14:43] heard an angel flying through the midst
[1:14:44] of heaven saying with a loud voice woe
[1:14:46] woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth
[1:14:48] by reason of the other voices of the
[1:14:50] trumpet of these three angels which are
[1:14:52] yet to sound all right now Church what's
[1:14:57] the order of the Tribulation Period now
[1:14:59] to me this is just my thought and of
[1:15:02] course you're free to disagree but from
[1:15:05] what I've just read you know from these
[1:15:07] quotes it seems like first is the
[1:15:08] rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:10] then after the rapture now one thing I
[1:15:13] forgot to put on here is the building of
[1:15:14] the temple I believe they're gonna have
[1:15:15] to build the temple before the rapture
[1:15:16] that's just my personal opinion because
[1:15:19] a temple is gonna take a quite a while
[1:15:20] to build I believe we will see the
[1:15:23] building of the temple and I believe
[1:15:24] that will raise our rapturing faith
[1:15:26] that's what I believe because as soon as
[1:15:30] the bride goes then God's back to the
[1:15:32] Jews and that clock starts ticking he
[1:15:35] presses unpause and now they've got
[1:15:38] three and a half years the two prophets
[1:15:40] rise on the scene so the bride goes up
[1:15:42] and the anointing two prophets come down
[1:15:44] amen the Poynting comes down a part well
[1:15:46] I believe they come from heaven I
[1:15:47] believe it's Moses Elijah I leave when
[1:15:49] the bride goes up will be waving and
[1:15:51] they're going Moses and Elijah coming
[1:15:52] down I don't know if we'll see him or
[1:15:54] not but it's going to happen because
[1:15:56] right now they're in heaven amen is that
[1:15:59] right they met Jesus on Mount
[1:16:00] Transfiguration when the bride goes up I
[1:16:02] imagine will just breeze right past them
[1:16:04] go right past the Milky Way say see you
[1:16:06] guys may the Lord bless your ministry I
[1:16:08] know you will in the head but I believe
[1:16:12] when the bride goes up they'll sign that
[1:16:14] seven-year peace treaty but there's only
[1:16:18] three and a half years left because the
[1:16:20] Bible said he breaks the covenant in the
[1:16:22] myths of the week the Bible says that in
[1:16:24] Daniel 9 so I believe it's going to be a
[1:16:26] 7-year covenant but it's not going to
[1:16:28] make it all the way so then the two
[1:16:31] outfits will minister for three and a
[1:16:32] half years the Bible said they'll close
[1:16:34] the heavens and it won't even rain for
[1:16:36] three and a half years can you imagine
[1:16:37] that not going to rain for three and a
[1:16:40] half years and then you have them
[1:16:45] calling Israel to the feast of the
[1:16:47] trumpets to get ready for the Day of
[1:16:49] Atonement amen hallelujah for the
[1:16:52] forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ
[1:16:54] the day there was free and now they have
[1:16:56] an atonement between them in God amen
[1:17:00] then I believe that 7-year covenant is
[1:17:03] broken at the halfway point when they
[1:17:06] kill the two prophets and then at that
[1:17:09] point I believe the two prophets rapture
[1:17:12] three and a half days later three days
[1:17:13] later rather they go up to heaven the
[1:17:18] two prophets go up and then Jesus Christ
[1:17:21] comes back and he reveals himself to the
[1:17:23] hundred 44,000 they'll mourn the Bible
[1:17:25] said they'll mourn and cry I go from
[1:17:27] house to house but then the Bibles to
[1:17:29] the next day a nation will be born in
[1:17:31] one day praise God oh they're gonna feel
[1:17:34] so bad how can we crucify our Messiah
[1:17:36] but now there is say o Moses and Elijah
[1:17:38] preach about him there he is it's got to
[1:17:40] be right the lawgiver is pointing to the
[1:17:43] the fulfillment of the law Elijah the
[1:17:45] prophet of the Gentile or the prophets
[1:17:47] of Israel is providing to Christ that's
[1:17:50] got to be him and we live and forgive us
[1:17:52] fill us with your Holy Spirit amen
[1:17:54] we've kept all your word we've we've got
[1:17:57] the tempo even making sacrifices we've
[1:17:59] kept all the word oh we we need to be
[1:18:02] born again and God fills them with the
[1:18:04] Holy Ghost they get the seal of God in
[1:18:07] their foreheads the Bible says then
[1:18:11] church after that once they get the
[1:18:14] 144,000 get the Holy Ghost now now how
[1:18:17] the trumpets can sound because the
[1:18:20] servants of God have been sealed in
[1:18:22] their foreheads now I could be wrong on
[1:18:25] that that's just my thought I cannot
[1:18:29] understand how the trumpets have already
[1:18:31] started blowing when Israel hasn't even
[1:18:33] gathered by the Feast of the trumpets to
[1:18:36] Christ yet how can the seven trumpets
[1:18:39] blow when the Feast of Trumpets hasn't
[1:18:40] even started because the two prophets
[1:18:43] haven't started
[1:18:44] calling Israel together yet to hear the
[1:18:46] preaching on the the Messiah now I could
[1:18:49] be wrong but that's just my thought all
[1:18:52] right no revelation 9 will go a little
[1:18:56] bit further maybe give me about 15 more
[1:18:58] minutes here we'll finish up by God's
[1:18:59] grace now Church this is what I was
[1:19:03] telling you remember a few year or maybe
[1:19:05] last year remember how I was telling you
[1:19:06] I had put feast of the trumpets up on a
[1:19:08] shelf you remember I said that and I
[1:19:09] told you I was gonna have to go back to
[1:19:11] it well I went back to it I listened to
[1:19:13] it over and over and over again I've
[1:19:15] taken these notes and this tonight is
[1:19:17] what I've come up with this is what I
[1:19:20] believe I believe according to author C
[1:19:22] brothers program s quotes on both sides
[1:19:24] then it just shows maybe God wasn't
[1:19:26] dealing with him so I just got to choose
[1:19:28] the sign I think is right I can't see
[1:19:31] how all these trumpets have already
[1:19:33] blown when the 144,000 don't even have
[1:19:35] profits yet and they're not even warned
[1:19:37] again yet I just can't see that so
[1:19:40] that's why I take this this stance at it
[1:19:42] by God's grace
[1:19:44] okay revelation 9 now the themes of this
[1:19:48] chapter are the sounding of the fifth
[1:19:50] and sixth trumpets and the passing of
[1:19:52] the first row and we've read a lot of
[1:19:54] this already the fifth trumpet brings
[1:19:57] torment only not death and it's on the
[1:20:02] earth for five months upon any person
[1:20:04] who does not have the seal of God or the
[1:20:06] baptism the Holy Ghost in their
[1:20:08] foreheads which means every one that is
[1:20:10] not one of the 144,000 Israeli believers
[1:20:12] will be torment and that includes
[1:20:14] foolish virgin as far as I understand
[1:20:16] unless they're already hunted down by
[1:20:18] this time I'm not sure all right
[1:20:30] get through here all these okay so we
[1:20:33] read than the chapter nine I'm sorry we
[1:20:39] read started we started chapter nine
[1:20:41] let's just go through a little slowly
[1:20:42] here verse one and the fifth angel
[1:20:45] sounded I saw a star fall from heaven
[1:20:47] upon the earth and to him was given the
[1:20:49] key of the bottomless pit and he opened
[1:20:52] the bottomless pit and there arose a
[1:20:53] smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a
[1:20:55] great furnace and the Sun the air were
[1:20:57] darkened by reason of the smoke of the
[1:20:59] pit and there came out of the smoke
[1:21:01] locusts upon the earth and unto them was
[1:21:04] given power as the Scorpions of the
[1:21:06] earth have power so locusts come out of
[1:21:09] Hell right in the bottomless pit and the
[1:21:13] their power verse four and it should be
[1:21:16] commanded that they should not hurt the
[1:21:17] grass of the earth neither any green
[1:21:19] thing neither any tree but only those
[1:21:22] men which have not the seal of God in
[1:21:25] their foreheads so see they they ran
[1:21:29] from God for so long they spit in God's
[1:21:32] face so long what is God gonna do God is
[1:21:34] gonna send bounty hunters on these
[1:21:36] people cuz I just say it like that God
[1:21:39] is gonna have these locusts hunt them
[1:21:41] out see because God was trying to push
[1:21:43] them into his presence and they kept
[1:21:45] pushing God out so now God's like well
[1:21:47] well they have judge of the day of
[1:21:49] mercies past because you pushed me out
[1:21:51] I'm gonna chase you down do God doesn't
[1:21:55] play around and children God's not
[1:21:57] playing around with you God's not
[1:21:58] playing around with me God is trying to
[1:22:00] drive us we've got to let God's angels
[1:22:02] drive us in the presence of God I know
[1:22:05] yeah something is driving you you're
[1:22:08] being driven by something today brother
[1:22:09] Ram said right
[1:22:10] remember garnet peak polio drove drove
[1:22:14] him to Christ amen let's let God take
[1:22:16] the events in our lives and let's let
[1:22:18] them drive us closer to Christ if not
[1:22:22] God is going to chase us down and make
[1:22:25] us pay for it because all those times
[1:22:28] can you imagine every morning by there
[1:22:30] God lovingly whispers in there there
[1:22:33] there there it won't you just go to
[1:22:35] church today won't you just read your
[1:22:38] Bible don't you just surrender won't you
[1:22:40] just accept love in your heart and so
[1:22:42] you don't hate so at
[1:22:44] the Holy Spirit is constantly working
[1:22:46] and it's just like the days of Noah the
[1:22:48] Bible said every thought of every man's
[1:22:51] heart was only evil continually and
[1:22:53] finally got to the point in the tenth
[1:22:55] generation number 10 10 is the number of
[1:22:57] worldliness finally got the tenth
[1:22:58] generation God said fine
[1:23:00] I'm taking my hands off this I'm not
[1:23:03] even gonna strive with man anymore
[1:23:05] I have tried for these ten long
[1:23:07] generations if they won't receive it
[1:23:09] then fine I'm sending to the flood and
[1:23:11] look Church he was even merciful so
[1:23:14] merciful he had Noah preached for 120
[1:23:15] more years after he said that the sons
[1:23:19] of God saw the daughters of men and God
[1:23:21] said this agrees in my heart I've tried
[1:23:22] 400 all these six or 600 years whatever
[1:23:25] I've done there I'm sorry
[1:23:26] 2,000 years and God said fine see he has
[1:23:31] so much mercy doesn't God but but
[1:23:33] there's a limit to God's mercy there's a
[1:23:36] limit and if we don't accept it if we
[1:23:39] don't let God chase us in his presence
[1:23:40] he's gonna chase down all the
[1:23:42] disobedient I know about you but I want
[1:23:45] the Holy Spirit to kind of push me Jesse
[1:23:48] come on go to church Jesse come on read
[1:23:51] your Bible I'm tired Jesse come on I say
[1:23:56] thank you lord
[1:23:57] later on it might be hard at first I'll
[1:24:00] say thank you Lord for or give me that
[1:24:01] little nudge thank you for driving me
[1:24:05] thank you for allowing these trials and
[1:24:07] pressures to drive me in your presence
[1:24:09] because once I get in your presence
[1:24:11] there's fullness of joy amen
[1:24:13] it might have been a rough day but once
[1:24:15] I get in God's presence
[1:24:16] there's fullness of joy fullness of love
[1:24:19] fondness of a hope there's everything we
[1:24:21] all need up in God's presence that's
[1:24:24] right thank you Lord for driving me in
[1:24:26] your presence yes praise God hallelujah
[1:24:35] okay verse 5 and it
[1:24:38] them it was given that they should not
[1:24:40] kill them but that they should be
[1:24:41] tormented five months now look at that
[1:24:43] five months of torment now I've been
[1:24:46] reading job I'm in job chapter 19 I'm in
[1:24:49] reading - every day chapter a day job
[1:24:52] suffered for months he had suffered
[1:24:55] months so here's five months I don't
[1:24:57] know how many job job just said months
[1:24:58] at the end of these months his three
[1:25:01] friends came and when they looked at him
[1:25:03] they fell down and for seven days
[1:25:04] straight they just cried looked at this
[1:25:05] man and then they start condemning him
[1:25:08] I've been reading that too and jobs like
[1:25:11] don't condemn me I haven't done anything
[1:25:13] wrong and I surely you're a wick you've
[1:25:16] got a wicked heart and all these things
[1:25:18] that job's like I don't have a wicked
[1:25:19] heart I'm pure before God months months
[1:25:25] of torment five months and were
[1:25:32] finishing verse five and their torment
[1:25:34] was as the torment of a scorpion when he
[1:25:35] striketh the men I've never been stung
[1:25:37] by a scorpion I've been bit by a snake
[1:25:40] though one time it was through a glove
[1:25:42] and it didn't hurt too bad he can't
[1:25:45] latched on to the glove and I had a
[1:25:46] little bleeding under that but I never
[1:25:48] been stung by is anyone ever been stung
[1:25:50] by a scorpion how did it feel anybody
[1:25:51] okay no all right so no witnesses of
[1:25:55] scorpions here we don't want to be stung
[1:25:58] by a scorpion we want to be sealed by
[1:26:00] the Holy Ghost and those days shall men
[1:26:03] seek death now look at this God will not
[1:26:06] let suicide be an option there's no
[1:26:10] there's no suicide available because my
[1:26:12] RAM said they're gonna be insane they're
[1:26:15] gonna be so insane they can't even take
[1:26:17] their own lives for five months I see
[1:26:20] some people believe this already
[1:26:21] happened I don't think so I mean people
[1:26:23] are still committing suicide I don't
[1:26:25] know in those days shall men seek death
[1:26:28] and shall not find it and shall desire
[1:26:29] to die and death shall flee from them
[1:26:33] because of these locusts these scorpions
[1:26:36] tormenting them and the
[1:26:41] the locusts were like unto horses
[1:26:42] prepared in the battle and on their
[1:26:45] heads were as it were crowns like gold
[1:26:47] and their faces were as the faces of men
[1:26:49] he met picture that a man's face on a
[1:26:51] horse and a tail sting you like a
[1:26:54] scorpion now look at verse eight now
[1:26:58] this is crucial for our sisters and they
[1:27:01] had hair as the hair of women and their
[1:27:03] teeth as were the teeth of lions now
[1:27:06] this is what I even shared this I share
[1:27:08] my book I'm almost ready it'll be out in
[1:27:10] about a month I shared this book with a
[1:27:13] minister the minister said Wow brother
[1:27:15] Jesse I never saw verse 8 verse 8
[1:27:17] defines hair length for women it says
[1:27:19] hair of a woman well if you go out to
[1:27:21] the Walmart tonight what's the hair of
[1:27:23] women most women have hair right here
[1:27:24] and you know they're older they you know
[1:27:27] they get their perms
[1:27:30] what's the hair of women well according
[1:27:32] the Bible the hair of women is long
[1:27:34] uncut hair if you read first Corinthians
[1:27:35] chapter 11 so to torment them for five
[1:27:40] months God sends the horses that have
[1:27:42] faces of men and their hair is long like
[1:27:45] a woman's and brother Bram said that's a
[1:27:48] torment then because they let their
[1:27:50] women cut their hair it's they're gonna
[1:27:53] be tormented for five months you should
[1:27:55] have obeyed the Bible why don't you men
[1:27:58] cut your hair why did you let you I'd
[1:27:59] you let your sons have long hair like a
[1:28:01] women and for the women why didn't you
[1:28:03] cut your hair or why don't you let your
[1:28:05] hair grow long the Bible says God never
[1:28:07] asked a godly woman to cut her hair
[1:28:09] and now we think oh it doesn't matter
[1:28:11] what's your hair yes it does because God
[1:28:14] is going to allow this fifth trumpet to
[1:28:16] show all the sinners that long hair was
[1:28:20] the hair of women amen
[1:28:25] people say oh it doesn't really make a
[1:28:26] difference it doesn't make a difference
[1:28:27] the Bible said it's a shame to your head
[1:28:30] right it dis honors your head and mother
[1:28:32] BAM said I just listened to it on the
[1:28:34] recognizer natives a message whatever
[1:28:37] have said if you're dishonorable he said
[1:28:38] then you're filthy right so a woman
[1:28:41] that'll cut her hair must have some
[1:28:42] filthy type of spirit order because she
[1:28:45] the ones that dishonor her husband right
[1:28:47] and that dishonours Christ and that
[1:28:50] dishonor is the invisible spirit God so
[1:28:53] it's a chain
[1:28:54] events like it's a domino effect you
[1:28:56] dishonor your husband at dishonours
[1:28:57] Christ that dishonours invisible spirit
[1:28:59] God and their teeth Reza's teeth of
[1:29:04] lions said the lion teeth right nose
[1:29:07] real sharp teeth hair face like a man
[1:29:10] and long hair like a woman to torment
[1:29:12] these unbelievers for five months and
[1:29:17] they and they had breastplates as it
[1:29:20] were breastplates of iron and the sound
[1:29:21] of their wings was as the sound of
[1:29:23] chariots of many horses running to
[1:29:25] battle
[1:29:26] alright so they have wings as well verse
[1:29:30] 10 and they had tails like unto
[1:29:31] scorpions and their strings in their
[1:29:34] tails and their power was to hurt men
[1:29:36] five months and they had a king over
[1:29:40] them now who's this King Church brother
[1:29:41] man tells us and beats the trumpets who
[1:29:43] is the king out of the bottomless pit
[1:29:45] Satan which is the Angel of the
[1:29:50] bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew
[1:29:52] tongue is Abaddon when the Greek tongue
[1:29:54] hath his name apollyon
[1:29:56] that's bromances that's the devil he's
[1:29:59] the king of all these demons the angel
[1:30:03] the bottomless pit and then look at
[1:30:07] verse 12 one woe is past and behold
[1:30:09] there come two woes more Hereafter
[1:30:12] five months of torment the
[1:30:18] they wouldn't take the baptism of the
[1:30:19] Holy Ghost my all were such a privilege
[1:30:22] people praise God amen thank the Lord
[1:30:26] hallelujah so God gives
[1:30:35] to all these men that grew their hair
[1:30:37] long or didn't preach the gospel and um
[1:30:39] preach this that God gave a natural
[1:30:42] godly hair covering for our sisters
[1:30:45] right every long uncut hair represents
[1:30:48] every every word of God in here
[1:30:51] all right so girls you understand that
[1:30:53] when a girl cuts her hair it's like
[1:30:56] taking this Bible and cutting out the
[1:30:57] Bible can you imagine doing that that's
[1:31:00] what it represents when a woman cuts her
[1:31:02] hair it's like ripping this out you
[1:31:04] imagine somebody ripping this out yeah
[1:31:05] that's what it represents when a woman
[1:31:08] cuts her hair she doesn't need that she
[1:31:11] doesn't need to obey every word of God
[1:31:12] she can just cut this Bible and rip it
[1:31:14] up and throw it around
[1:31:15] that's God's holy word right the Bible
[1:31:19] said add not don't take it away or else
[1:31:22] should be called a liar the Bible says
[1:31:25] all right praise God let's finish up
[1:31:27] here now verse 13 that was the fifth
[1:31:33] trumpet sixth trumpet I read some of
[1:31:35] this earlier and six angels sound and I
[1:31:37] heard a voice from the four horns of the
[1:31:39] golden altar which is before God saying
[1:31:41] to the sixth angel which had the trumpet
[1:31:42] loose the four angels which are bound
[1:31:44] yeah we read this now skip down to verse
[1:31:46] 16 and the number of the army was the
[1:31:49] horsemen was two hundred thousand
[1:31:51] thousand that's two hundred million and
[1:31:52] you'll hear brother man I mentioned that
[1:31:54] on the Feast of the trumpets and I heard
[1:31:56] the number of them and I vest saw the
[1:31:58] horses in the vision and then that sat
[1:32:00] on them having breastplates of fire and
[1:32:03] of Jacob and brimstone in the heads of
[1:32:05] the horses were as the head of lions and
[1:32:07] out of their mouths issued fire and
[1:32:09] smoke and brimstone and these three I'm
[1:32:12] sorry by these three was the third part
[1:32:14] of men killed again two billion people
[1:32:18] two billion people are going to be
[1:32:20] killed under the sixth well round two
[1:32:23] million under the sixth trumpet by fire
[1:32:27] by smoke and out of the brimstone which
[1:32:28] issued out of their mouth Wow by the
[1:32:31] fire so they're the the the these two
[1:32:36] hundred men
[1:32:37] demon powers gonna breathe fire and burn
[1:32:40] up two billion people my goodness for
[1:32:45] their powers in their mouth and in their
[1:32:47] tails for their tails were like on the
[1:32:48] serpents and had heads and with them
[1:32:52] they do hurt verse 20 and the rest of
[1:32:55] these men which were not killed by the
[1:32:57] plagues yet repented not so they see
[1:32:59] this going on and they still won't
[1:33:01] repent they still won't say god I'm

[1:33:14] save people why aren't more people
[1:33:15] getting saved but the same time we this
[1:33:18] cup of wrath has to fill up fewer and
[1:33:21] fewer people are gonna find this and we
[1:33:24] should just be thankful we should keep
[1:33:25] throwing out the net but we should just
[1:33:27] be thankful when we can repent because
[1:33:29] even the midst of the destruction and
[1:33:32] persecution and judgment they won't
[1:33:34] repent thank God that we can repent
[1:33:36] tonight amen because they won't even
[1:33:39] repent after seeing demons burn up with
[1:33:44] fire their friends and their family burn
[1:33:47] up right from they still won't repent

[1:34:51] wonder they won't repent when they see
[1:34:52] all this happening they'll see this
[1:34:54] burning up of two billion people they
[1:34:55] still only repent because their hearts
[1:34:57] are so hard they're so far from Christ

[1:35:02] Jesus Christ amen thank God for a heart
[1:35:05] that loves life and the creation of
[1:35:08] Almighty God it repented not of the
[1:35:16] works of their hands that they should

[1:35:33] children have enough money

[1:35:50] of golden of silver and brass and stone
[1:35:52] and of would neither which neither can
[1:35:54] see nor hear nor walk neither repented

[1:36:15] wonder God is just gonna let these
[1:36:17] beasts run out there and kill a third of
[1:36:19] all men because almost a third of them
[1:36:22] are guilty of killing babies murderers
[1:36:27] and heaven is saying thank God when this
[1:36:32] is going on heaven saying hallelujah
[1:36:34] God's holiness and righteousness was
[1:36:37] right God's ways were right the Great
[1:36:39] God and judge of the earth he
[1:36:42] getting vengeance because all these
[1:36:44] years or other the Saint said I'm not
[1:36:45] gonna take vengeance I'm not going to go
[1:36:46] burn down an abortion clinic vengeance
[1:36:49] is mine saith the Lord and we had to
[1:36:52] control ourselves right we have to
[1:36:53] control ourselves and not go crazy see
[1:36:55] that happen to almost made me angry when
[1:36:57] I read that today about the New York
[1:36:58] legislature just makes me want to like
[1:37:00] grab somebody other air air to just just
[1:37:03] want to go meet that mayor and but I've
[1:37:05] got it I've got to crucify that and say
[1:37:07] vengeance is mine saith the Lord
[1:37:09] amen and then God will take vengeance
[1:37:12] upon these people we just got to pray
[1:37:16] God help some of them to repent and come
[1:37:17] to God save what you can because this is
[1:37:20] just like Sodom and Gomorrah if you can
[1:37:22] save dad in New York I know more than 10
[1:37:24] in New York that got it so whatever you
[1:37:27] can save in New York saving because
[1:37:28] there's a good Church in New York
[1:37:29] there's a ruger Church in New York but
[1:37:32] don't you see Church don't you see this
[1:37:33] neither repented they of their murders
[1:37:35] nor their sorceries nor of their
[1:37:37] fornication nor of their thefts let's
[1:37:41] say into our feet by God's grace now I
[1:37:46] know I preach
[1:37:47] tonight but that's the Bible Church
[1:37:49] remember what brother may have said he
[1:37:52] said the church ages are necessary to
[1:37:54] understand the revelation for other ages
[1:37:56] come the seals and other seals come the
[1:37:58] trumpets and now the trumpets come the
[1:38:01] vows now church this is what it this is
[1:38:03] what I believe I could be wrong but I
[1:38:05] believe since God has shown me the right
[1:38:07] interpretation of the ages and seals now
[1:38:09] we can understand the trumpets that the
[1:38:10] trumpets haven't sounded yet because we
[1:38:14] rightly understood the church ages we've
[1:38:16] rightly understood the seals and now we
[1:38:18] can rightly understand the trumpets that
[1:38:20] they haven't blown yet the first one
[1:38:22] can't even blow until 144,000 are sealed
[1:38:24] by the Holy Spirit in their foreheads I
[1:38:29] believe God has given us that
[1:38:31] understanding he said like the first
[1:38:35] burst of a roman candle the church ages
[1:38:37] come forth with a mighty initial
[1:38:38] lumination without which there could be
[1:38:40] no further light thank God for the light
[1:38:42] amen we'll walk in the light such a
[1:38:45] beautiful ride amen but the brands of
[1:38:49] the seven church age is given by divine
[1:38:51] revelation light upon light follows
[1:38:53] until the whole the revelation opens
[1:38:55] wide before wandering eyes and we
[1:38:57] edified and purified by its fear are
[1:38:59] made ready for his glorious appearing
[1:39:00] even our Lord and Savior the one true
[1:39:03] God Jesus Christ amen thank God for the
[1:39:07] light hallelujah thank God for the light
[1:39:09] of the church Ages praise God thank you
[1:39:11] lord praise God now here's here's why
[1:39:18] it's important that we understand the
[1:39:19] trumpets brother Branham said the
[1:39:21] businessmen which is a bunch of
[1:39:22] Pentecostal people they say glory to God
[1:39:26] then preachers go and just sit stir the
[1:39:28] crowd and say there's coming a great
[1:39:29] revival the hand Lord is going to be
[1:39:30] upon the earth and how the people are
[1:39:32] going to be going forward like that and
[1:39:34] don't realize that's under the trumpets
[1:39:36] of Israel so do you see what he's saying
[1:39:38] here preachers are going around
[1:39:40] denominations saying there's gonna come
[1:39:41] a revival you can't tell me it's not
[1:39:43] I've heard so many say it I hear
[1:39:45] preachers all the time you know
[1:39:46] sometimes I'll watch him I like a lot I
[1:39:48] watched our videos about teaching I'm
[1:39:50] trying to learn about numbers and
[1:39:51] they'll say there's coming to revive
[1:39:53] when the people get so stirred up and
[1:39:56] brother Graham said it's because they
[1:39:58] got the revivals mixed up
[1:40:01] 144,000 Jews they're gonna have revival
[1:40:03] amen
[1:40:04] they're gonna get the Holy Ghost amen
[1:40:07] and then their trumpets are going to
[1:40:08] sound but see programs and their
[1:40:11] preaching that there's coming a revival
[1:40:13] but they're preaching that it gets
[1:40:15] because they don't understand the
[1:40:15] trumpets they don't understand that
[1:40:17] there's got to be the 144,000 that's the
[1:40:20] revival then the trumpets come so what
[1:40:23] are they doing they're giving people
[1:40:24] false hope I've seen services like that
[1:40:27] where the preacher the Pentecostal
[1:40:29] preacher will say there's kind of
[1:40:30] revival everybody says yeah ain't it huh
[1:40:32] and they go out and they let them keep
[1:40:34] sinning and see this is why it's so
[1:40:37] important to understand the trumpets and
[1:40:39] the seals and the church ages because
[1:40:43] the preachers are preaching promises
[1:40:45] that don't pertain to them they actually
[1:40:47] pertain to Israel that's why the
[1:40:50] trumpets are so important well brother
[1:40:52] just why would you preach it so you
[1:40:54] don't so you and I don't believe the
[1:40:56] wrong the wrong scriptures we have to
[1:40:59] believe the scriptures that pertain to
[1:41:00] us does every understand that's why it's
[1:41:03] so important that's a brother and says
[1:41:04] they don't realize that some of the
[1:41:06] trumpets for Israel why do they do it is
[1:41:08] because they are Christian professors
[1:41:09] and don't realize neither did Caiaphas's
[1:41:12] realize what he's doing and they don't
[1:41:16] realize that they're rejecting the very
[1:41:17] message that God sent to them what is
[1:41:20] the message Jesus Christ is the same
[1:41:22] yesterday today and forever amen
[1:41:25] and everything in the Apostles faith is
[1:41:28] for going on that's the message
[1:41:30] but the preachers are preaching that
[1:41:32] they're you know the the denominational
[1:41:34] preachers the message preached preachers
[1:41:36] are thank God but the denominations that
[1:41:38] are preaching about this revival to come
[1:41:40] and the signs and wonders and miracles
[1:41:41] that's for the Jews not for them their
[1:41:46] revival is with us they should be with
[1:41:48] us right over there
[1:41:49] those those Pentecostals should be right
[1:41:52] here we we are the revival amen and if
[1:41:58] you listen to this message I just
[1:41:59] listened to yesterday and today I
[1:42:00] listened to it while shoveling snow last
[1:42:02] week for four hours the first time was
[1:42:05] two hours a second time was two hours I
[1:42:07] listened that whole message twice
[1:42:11] brother Branham says it in there that
[1:42:13] this is art brother man said the bride
[1:42:15] he said why do they why these preachers
[1:42:17] say revivals coming fast and pray fast
[1:42:19] and prayed he says because they haven't
[1:42:21] recognized the awakening of the bride
[1:42:23] amen
[1:42:24] the bride is awake in church remember we
[1:42:26] breached it we're not sleeping we're
[1:42:28] awake we're trimming our lamps and we'll
[1:42:30] get ready to go meet Christ amen
[1:42:33] the bride is awake but the
[1:42:35] denomination's can't recognize the
[1:42:37] message so they're preaching revival
[1:42:40] services for the trumpet scriptures for
[1:42:42] the Jews and it's all because they
[1:42:45] Rebecca rejecting the very message God
[1:42:47] send them they'll say and I've been
[1:42:49] getting emails people say well brother
[1:42:50] Branham he was a prophet but he got off
[1:42:52] on the the serpents eating all these
[1:42:54] things like that and brother Branham
[1:42:55] said what a what a disgrace to a prophet
[1:42:57] how can you call him an a prophet and
[1:42:59] then say he got off the Word of God if
[1:43:01] he was a true prophet and a genuine
[1:43:03] prophet then he stayed with the word
[1:43:06] amen he said what a disgrace what a slap
[1:43:10] in the face
[1:43:11] oh he calls me a prophet he believes in
[1:43:13] my healing gift we don't believe in my
[1:43:14] teaching and he said let anyone hear you
[1:43:17] brother innocent let anyone and you get
[1:43:18] your Bible come stand before me and show
[1:43:20] me where I'm wrong on the serpent seed
[1:43:22] show me where I'm wrong on the Godhead
[1:43:28] cistern and we might have seen I've been
[1:43:29] posting on the Godhead brother Aaron for
[1:43:32] 26 days in a row and I had a brother two
[1:43:34] years ago a Pentecostal brother two days
[1:43:35] ago rather he said well Jesse he said
[1:43:38] you sure defend your views pretty well
[1:43:39] he said in 30 years I believe in the
[1:43:42] Trinitarian stuff I've never heard what
[1:43:44] you preached and he said I'm no longer
[1:43:48] calling myself a Trinitarian and I'm
[1:43:52] just pulling out the things roadman said
[1:43:54] and I knew I had felt the Lord to start
[1:43:56] doing that I knew I felt I just you know
[1:43:58] I just took a little while to he did
[1:44:00] that call 30 years he never even knew
[1:44:04] the lies and now he has enough sense to
[1:44:07] know I'm not a Trinitarian he said I
[1:44:10] believe in the father's only ghost but
[1:44:11] I'm not insurance here and I said well
[1:44:12] thank the Lord for that not banal Rob
[1:44:14] and said see brother man said Satan will
[1:44:17] slip that Trinity line there to make you
[1:44:19] and I dollar because you believe in
[1:44:21] three gods so thank God
[1:44:24] just got delivered from idolatry whether
[1:44:27] he knows or not tape it and let's say
[1:44:31] the tribulation happens in his life
[1:44:32] he'll know not to go with those
[1:44:33] Trinitarians hopefully by God's grace
[1:44:36] think of that 30 years being a
[1:44:38] denomination and never knew until some
[1:44:40] small little idiot humble little
[1:44:42] preacher puts it on Facebook and shows
[1:44:45] I'm showing eight reasons why the
[1:44:47] Trinity is wrong and he got it on the
