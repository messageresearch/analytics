[0:00] let's go to Romans chapter 1 verse one
[0:02] I'd like to can actually start this
[0:04] series here on the book of Romans
[0:06] by the grace of God tonight
[0:08] I want to thank everybody for the
[0:10] support on Sunday
[0:12] it seemed like the live stream worked
[0:13] out okay
[0:14] by God's grace so thank you for
[0:15] everybody who played a part there I sent
[0:18] a text to brother amen thanking him for
[0:19] his music Ministry
[0:21] I sure appreciate all the efforts that
[0:23] everybody did
[0:24] we had a wonderful time there as you saw
[0:30] chapter 1 verse 1.
[0:33] we just had a good good time the Lord
[0:36] I asked you know before there's a number
[0:38] of people that come up for prayer at the
[0:40] end and I said we're any testimonies
[0:41] from the first time we had a real long
[0:42] prayer line the first time and
[0:45] one of the brothers said
[0:47] he said I think the greatest blessing he
[0:49] said was that we were all got delivered
[0:51] from the spirit of fear
[0:53] because they were a fearful of their
[0:55] previous Pastor was a legalistic guy now
[0:58] that guy goes to a
[1:00] we say a worldly Church
[1:03] and they were so happy and they were
[1:04] just saying we Yeah we actually were
[1:06] delivered from the spirit of fear we no
[1:08] longer live under fear of man
[1:11] Hallelujah in the Bible said cursed is
[1:12] the man that trusts thin man right so it
[1:15] was a great Victory and then a young
[1:17] sister come up and she said that's right
[1:18] brother Jesse I had a back I really some
[1:21] back pain and then God healed me slowly
[1:23] but surely a few days afterwards each
[1:25] day got a little better she said now I'm
[1:27] completely well by God's grace so thank
[1:29] the Lord for touching him back
[1:30] Hallelujah and then she's the one to
[1:32] come up for prayer and she said I want
[1:33] to be the first one to dance for Jesus
[1:36] she said in other words she said I want
[1:38] to be the Miriam in the church and I
[1:39] said well obviously bless you somebody's
[1:41] got to be the Mary and praise God
[1:43] but it's the first time you know after
[1:45] we close the service I don't know if you
[1:46] saw I don't know if you saw that part or
[1:47] not but I said let's all stomp our feet
[1:49] and clap it's the first time they've
[1:51] ever stomped and clapped
[1:52] in his service their whole lives
[1:54] some of them are 50 and 60 years old
[1:56] they've never stoned like you get to do

[4:11] I'd like to show and we'll
[4:13] to be right with the word of God here
[4:16] tonight Romans chapter one we'll go
[4:17] there
[4:22] Church we're starting a letter tonight
[4:24] that some people believe is the greatest
[4:28] letter or epistle ever written in the
[4:30] Bible some people believe that
[4:33] The Book of Romans it is one of Paul's
[4:35] longest letters if not the longest he
[4:37] ever wrote
[4:39] and you'll see why this is such an
[4:41] important letter here as we get going on
[4:43] and uh you know I love I love teaching
[4:46] and preaching through books of the Bible
[4:48] we've now made it I think through five
[4:49] if I'm not mistaken
[4:51] you'll see I'll show some quotes from
[4:52] Brother Brown brother Branham did that
[4:54] too he would just preach straight
[4:55] through a book of the Bible praise God
[4:58] and so we're very grateful for that and
[5:00] and hopefully by God's grace we'll have
[5:02] a fresh understanding here of the
[5:04] importance of this book here the book to
[5:06] the Romans
[5:07] and remember our whole purpose behind
[5:09] this is you know it struck me back in
[5:11] 2016. brother Branham was in his vision
[5:14] he was in his body was there on the bed
[5:16] but he went up beyond the curtain of
[5:17] time he went up we'd say to the probably
[5:19] the sixth dimension
[5:21] and he was told by a voice he said Jesus
[5:24] will come someday and he'll come to you
[5:25] first and then you'll be judged
[5:28] and then he uh the voice said these
[5:30] people are your converts that you've LED
[5:31] and I said you mean by being a leader
[5:33] that he'll judge me yes
[5:35] I said does every leader have to be
[5:37] judged like that yes I said what about
[5:39] Paul he'll have to be judged with his
[5:41] well I said if this group goes in so
[5:44] will mine because I preach exactly the
[5:46] same word amen that is I said where he
[5:49] baptized in Jesus name I did too I
[5:52] preached and the millions screamed out
[5:54] all at once were resting on that let's
[5:55] shout that out time ready we're resting
[5:57] on that let's try it again ready we're
[5:59] resting on that praise God what are we
[6:01] resting on the fact that brother random
[6:03] preached Paul's gospel that's what we're
[6:05] resting on and I thought my if I don't
[6:08] only know this before I come here I
[6:10] would make people come here they can't
[6:12] afford to miss this why looky here
[6:15] that's from the fifth seal
[6:16] praise God so I thought you know I'd
[6:18] refresh that each time I start a new
[6:19] book I try to just read that quote as a
[6:22] help there remember and now we're in
[6:24] this book and God will judge every
[6:26] person's heart
[6:27] by Paul's gospel that Jesus Christ gave
[6:30] him it's the Judgment standard
[6:33] so brother random even says in the
[6:34] church age book he said you know what he
[6:35] said you want to know where you stand
[6:36] with God he said look at the word of God
[6:38] and see if you're obeying it that's how
[6:40] you know where you stand
[6:42] the thing about a church you know many
[6:43] of us God's helped us to overcome you
[6:44] know
[6:45] eyes and and anger and greed and
[6:48] frustration and addictions and uh lust
[6:50] of the eyes lust of the fresh pride of
[6:52] life
[6:52] don't look at just don't don't look at
[6:54] the things you're struggling look at all
[6:56] the victories God's given you as well
[6:57] praise God because we could all look at
[6:59] well this area of my life right the
[7:01] enemy gets one one punch on us all the
[7:03] time right
[7:04] but we can't just look at that area
[7:05] we've got to look at all the areas God
[7:07] helped us to overcome how many grateful
[7:09] for all the victories he's brought to
[7:11] you praise God oh there's so many
[7:13] churches there's so many victories God
[7:14] gives us amen so we want to rejoice in
[7:17] that here tonight
[7:18] so for resting on Paul's gospel we need
[7:21] to know what he said for he he wrote and
[7:23] preached the whole Council of God and I
[7:26] remember this quote brother man tells us
[7:27] he said there's there there must be
[7:29] someone rise up that's got to come for
[7:31] it's thus said the Lord Malachi the
[7:32] fourth chapter that's exactly what he
[7:34] said would be the sign just before the
[7:35] coming of the great and terrible day of
[7:37] the Lord I'll send you Elijah and what'd
[7:39] he do he turned the hearts of the
[7:40] children back to the doctrine of the
[7:42] fathers back to the Bible out of these
[7:44] denominational difference and come back
[7:45] to the Bible back to God that's what he
[7:48] do
[7:48] notice what a great time we're living in
[7:51] now Church let's look at the Simplicity
[7:52] of that every time you come back to your
[7:54] Bible to really understand the Bible
[7:55] you're returning to God
[7:57] right whether it's in the morning or the
[7:58] afternoon or mid morning whenever you
[8:00] really come back to the Bible for a
[8:02] fresh Revelation or a a time to spend
[8:05] with God you're coming back to God
[8:07] you're saying God I need more of you God
[8:10] I want more of you now we know Brothers
[8:12] you know all the doctrines he's pointing
[8:13] us back here but I just want to bring it
[8:14] on a personal level every time you open
[8:17] your Bible every time you get on your
[8:18] knees and pray every time you're seeking
[8:20] God you're coming back to your heavenly
[8:22] father praise God and he's going to give
[8:24] you he's going to give you what you have
[8:25] need of for that hour praise God
[8:27] so uh here's the quotes I want to share
[8:29] brother Ram taught series on numerous
[8:31] books of the Bible I'm not I'm not
[8:34] certain how familiar you are with these
[8:35] you know some of them I had to refresh
[8:36] myself on
[8:39] brother Ram said he taught numerous
[8:40] books of the Bible but here's some
[8:42] quotes where he talked about the Book of
[8:43] Job the book of Hebrews and the Book of
[8:45] Revelation
[8:46] and then of course there's others
[8:49] this is in 1955 this was the year Joseph
[8:51] his son was born Joseph one year I was
[8:53] staying out I preached The Book of Job
[8:55] taking me about a year and a half to get
[8:58] through it
[8:59] year and a half
[9:01] that's a long time on one book
[9:04] right after a few weeks you think
[9:05] brother Jesse are we still in Colossians
[9:08] what do you mean we're going to open up
[9:09] to Philippians again
[9:11] imagine doing a year and a half on Joe
[9:16] when I got him over on the ashy
[9:18] I kept him there for about six or eight
[9:20] weeks preaching on the ash heat now
[9:22] brother man I'm always exaggerated right
[9:24] or often exaggerated so we don't know
[9:25] how long it was but
[9:27] he said one of the members of my
[9:28] congregation she didn't want to hurt my
[9:30] feelings but she wrote me a letter now
[9:31] for today a person would send me a text
[9:33] right and say brother Brandon when are
[9:36] you ever going to get job off to ashy in
[9:38] other words brother Jess when are you
[9:39] ever going to preach on something else
[9:40] right now hopefully I have a variety of
[9:43] sermons that you enjoy
[9:45] especially says I'm the pastor if not
[9:46] that's why I said that's why I asked for
[9:48] uh you know topics for the Sunday School
[9:51] right I remember last year a couple
[9:52] Sundays ago and anytime you want me to
[9:54] preach on something you just let me know
[9:55] I try to follow the Holy Spirit the best
[9:57] I can
[9:59] uh by the grace of the Lord and I you
[10:00] know like I said we've had different
[10:01] people you know Sister Naomi a few
[10:03] months ago said some of the sermons that
[10:05] she that the God had me preach in this
[10:07] last year were some of the most
[10:08] important sermons she's ever heard in
[10:10] her life
[10:11] so it's awesome to get testimonies like
[10:13] that wow just this last year were the
[10:15] most important sermons in someone's life
[10:17] that I preach I said well thank God for
[10:19] that thank God for that that Lord just
[10:21] helped me to be a servant help me just
[10:23] preach what you want me to preach praise
[10:24] God
[10:28] so I hope I don't get any texts anytime
[10:30] soon are you still going to preach on
[10:32] Romans because I'm just starting here by
[10:33] God's grace
[10:35] but also brother I preached on uh 10
[10:37] sermons on Hebrews chapters one through
[10:39] seven now he never went past chapter
[10:41] seven
[10:42] for whatever reason he stopped in
[10:43] September of 57. but if you go count
[10:47] them there's 10 sermons he preached from
[10:48] chapter one all the way to chapter seven
[10:50] so he didn't cover 8 9 10 11 12 13. so
[10:54] you got about I didn't get halfway done
[10:56] with the book and then he moved on made
[10:57] the Holy Spirit moved him on
[10:59] uh but just interesting to know that and
[11:01] then in 1954 uh
[11:04] he said this is a brand new thing for me
[11:05] to start teaching the word that's
[11:06] because he was on all he was doing uh
[11:08] Evangelistic work from 1946 remember uh
[11:12] and here it comes back 54.
[11:14] it's a of course this was New York
[11:16] though
[11:17] he said now years ago as the pastor up
[11:19] at the Tabernacle as a Baptist Minister
[11:21] we used to have great classes and we
[11:22] would run them maybe a series of
[11:24] subjects for a complete year start in
[11:26] the book of Genesis and just tie the
[11:28] Bible together start in the book of
[11:29] Exodus and run it the Book of Daniel
[11:31] whatever and maybe the Book of
[11:33] Revelations and just take the entire
[11:34] book wear it from place to place all of
[11:37] God's word is written by inspiration
[11:40] that's what I've Loved about preaching I
[11:41] started there in Galatians and Ephesians
[11:43] Philippians and just finished Colossians
[11:45] that's what I love all those sermons
[11:47] apply to all of our lives
[11:51] like remember a couple weeks ago I
[11:52] preached on you know how we have to do
[11:54] our best at work and then people come up
[11:55] for prayer and said that's just what I
[11:57] needed for that time
[11:58] I needed encouragement that I got to be
[12:00] the best worker I can be now who knew
[12:02] that only God knew that
[12:04] you and I don't know these things it
[12:06] just shows every word is always
[12:08] applicable to our lives and God will
[12:10] give us the meet and due season praise
[12:12] God
[12:13] so brothers would preach on Genesis and
[12:15] The Exodus and then Daniel in Revelation
[12:17] because it's all inspired amen
[12:19] I love this one he says and now as you
[12:21] read this marvelous Book of Revelation
[12:23] in my home church I take it once almost
[12:25] a year and a half to go through it
[12:26] slowly each night teaching on just the
[12:29] Book of Revelation and comparing it with
[12:31] the rest of the Bible and the ages and
[12:33] so forth that have passed on
[12:35] oh I love that praise God imagine not
[12:39] just taking a whole year on The Book of
[12:41] Revelations or a whole year on The Book
[12:43] of Job praise God what a what a lesson
[12:45] praise God what a time to be now here's
[12:48] the progress I've made so in yellow are
[12:49] the ones I preached through to our
[12:51] church here starting back in 2016 I
[12:54] started in Galatians
[12:56] and then Ephesians and of course they've
[12:58] been spread out you know I'll I'll stop
[13:00] preaching on them for a while then I
[13:01] always come back to them so now I want
[13:03] to jump up there to Romans and we'll
[13:05] kind of see maybe I'll do Corinthians
[13:06] after that and Thessalonians and so
[13:08] forth all the way down
[13:09] uh finishing Paul's books if I'm not
[13:12] mistaken then Philemon would be the
[13:13] final book and I read a lot of that last
[13:15] week
[13:16] maybe the final one from Paul if I'm not
[13:18] mistaken
[13:23] so those are the dates you know I
[13:24] preached five sermons only five on
[13:25] Galatians 24 on Ephesians 17 on
[13:28] Philippians and just 10 on on Colossians
[13:30] there and I'm not going to go through
[13:32] these I you know I went through these
[13:33] last time I kind of want to get to the
[13:34] Book of Revelations I didn't have I
[13:36] didn't have it all done but here let's
[13:37] look at the impact Romans had on two
[13:40] Church age Messengers
[13:43] I'm not certain how familiar you are
[13:44] with the history but the book of Romans
[13:46] was Major
[13:48] it was Major in the life of Martin
[13:50] Luther
[13:52] right because what was his whole message
[13:54] the just shall live by faith what book
[13:57] is that in Romans
[13:59] Romans
[14:01] Romans God used Romans to bring the the
[14:04] the the the fifth Church age messenger
[14:07] out of the denomination
[14:09] it's beautiful praise God and that was
[14:12] quoting habakkuk praise God so God used
[14:14] the prophet
[14:15] Paul from another prophet's message
[14:17] praise God
[14:18] Hallelujah
[14:20] now this is from this website Ligonier
[14:22] out there they're Reformed Presbyterian
[14:25] I think I don't even know what that
[14:27] means we remember John Wesley giving his
[14:29] testimony I'm sorry this is Wesley let
[14:31] me go yeah let me go to uh Martin Luther
[14:33] when we think of the agonizing struggle
[14:36] of an augustinian monk in Germany who
[14:39] sought desperately in every corner of
[14:40] the church to find peace and Assurance
[14:42] of Salvation and something that would
[14:43] soothe this conscience from The Assault
[14:45] of the law of God that left him as it
[14:47] were hanging suspended by his own
[14:49] testimony over the pit of Hell so that
[14:51] that's what a denomination will do to
[14:53] you it'll feel like you're hanging over
[14:55] hell but church we don't want to feel
[14:56] like that we want to feel like we're
[14:58] seated in Heavenly places amen
[14:59] hallelujah thank God Amen Lord don't let
[15:02] me feel like I'm hanging over hell make
[15:04] me feel like I got Assurance like I'm
[15:06] seated in heaven hallelujah oh I love
[15:09] that don't you amen hallelujah I don't
[15:12] want to feel like you know I'm just
[15:13] barely hanging over hell and and the the
[15:15] Flames of hell are so close to me I'm so
[15:18] close to hell I want to be so far in
[15:20] heaven that I know I'm sealed into
[15:21] heaven praise God I'm sealed in the
[15:24] kingdom of God hallelujah amen until the
[15:26] day of my Redemption praise God but
[15:29] that's what a denomination will get you
[15:30] well that's what guilt will get you
[15:32] That's what Satan wants you to feel like
[15:33] you're just hanging over hell barely
[15:35] even saved and almost ready to be lost
[15:38] we've already shown it to you you can't
[15:39] be lost you've already passed from Death
[15:41] unto life amen it's impossible because
[15:44] Jesus went to hell for us praise God
[15:46] Amen thank God Amen
[15:49] that's what the domination will do it'll
[15:51] make you feel like you're almost in hell
[15:54] this scholar one evening in the tower
[15:56] Was preparing lectures and he was doing
[15:58] research into the lectures that he would
[16:00] give on tomorrow he came to an
[16:01] illuminated understanding of the word of
[16:03] God that would change the course of his
[16:05] life and think of it all of church
[16:08] history think about that in other words
[16:10] brother random wouldn't be where he was
[16:12] unless Martin Luther got this revelation
[16:16] right neither would John Wesley and you
[16:18] can go through all the William Seymour
[16:20] we preached on that right earlier in the
[16:22] last year he wouldn't have got where he
[16:24] was except Martin Luther had the
[16:27] Revelation that came out of the book of
[16:29] Romans Hallelujah
[16:32] thank God
[16:33] change though course of history praise

[17:11] with God Amen that's what I want you to
[17:12] find Hallelujah that's right where I

[17:33] oh thank God Amen
[17:35] thank God
[17:37] when Martin Luther came to a fresh
[17:38] understanding of the book of Romans he
[17:40] said when I understood this text the
[17:43] doors of paradise swung open
[17:47] is that how you feel when you read the
[17:50] Bible
[17:51] come on Church come on somebody say Amen
[17:53] is that how you feel you feel like the
[17:55] doors of Heaven are swinging open that's
[17:58] what I felt like when I come to the
[17:59] Bible
[18:01] wow I'm no longer a fear of slade I'm
[18:04] not a slave to fear anymore I'm not a
[18:06] slave to my sins anymore I feel like
[18:07] heaven has accepted me I'm a brand new
[18:10] person I'm a new creation I'm a brand
[18:12] new man praise God
[18:13] old things have passed away I've been
[18:16] born again amen I love that song more
[18:18] than a conqueror that's what I am I'm a
[18:21] new creation I'm a brand new man
[18:23] Hallelujah oh thank God when I read the
[18:27] Bible when I read the book of Romans
[18:29] it's as if
[18:30] the paradise Gates swung open and I
[18:33] walked inside
[18:35] and I walk through oh my
[18:39] I walked into Paradise
[18:41] after reading the book of Romans oh
[18:43] praise God
[18:45] sure sometimes I just realize you know
[18:47] we just need a reminder of what God's
[18:48] done for us
[18:50] right we've been saved we've been
[18:52] Sanctified we've been filled with the
[18:53] Holy Ghost but sometimes we just need to
[18:54] remind her what did God actually do for
[18:56] us praise God
[18:58] because we're so busy which we ought to
[19:00] be you know we're working and family and
[19:01] all these things but thank God for these
[19:03] times where we can look back and say
[19:05] look what God actually did for us Lord I
[19:08] I thank you
[19:09] that when I got saved as if as Heaven
[19:12] Heaven's Gates opened wide for me and
[19:15] not just the gates open wide actually
[19:17] the windows open wide too amen I tell
[19:20] you when you pay your times and
[19:21] offerings he said I open up the windows
[19:23] and I pour out a blessing you can't even
[19:25] receive Hallelujah
[19:27] oh that's the truth of the word of God
[19:29] Amen not only are the gates open the
[19:31] windows are open praise God
[19:34] I just struck me here amen Glory
[19:41] he said it was the book of Romans that
[19:43] awakened Luther to the doctrine of
[19:45] justification remember declare righteous
[19:47] as you wish to be
[19:49] by faith alone
[19:53] and persuaded him that this was the
[19:55] article on which the church stands or
[19:58] Falls
[19:59] amen
[20:01] let me know today you're standing
[20:02] because of you're Justified
[20:04] by faith that's what you stand on
[20:08] right you're not justified by works
[20:10] right the church said
[20:12] now we know Paul talks about that but
[20:13] it's faith it just means faith faith
[20:16] does work right because you believe
[20:17] because you're saved you show
[20:18] appreciation and you do works but you're
[20:20] not justified by works you're justified
[20:23] by faith Hallelujah and then if you're
[20:25] really justified by faith then you go to
[20:27] working for Jesus amen oh that's right
[20:29] that's right amen all these great
[20:31] Mysteries he lays out in this book oh
[20:33] it's beautiful
[20:36] thank God I'm standing on the
[20:37] justification of Jesus blood
[20:40] I'm not standing on brother branham's
[20:42] testimony I'm not standing on Martin
[20:44] Luther's testimony or anyone else I'm
[20:46] standing on Jesus Christ's blood amen
[20:48] that's the foundation that's my rock
[20:50] that my life has built on praise God
[20:52] that's my cornerstone amen
[20:55] oh thank God
[20:57] as a result of this experience the book
[20:59] of Romans became the central point of
[21:00] theological controversy in the 16th
[21:02] century and became known as the book of
[21:05] the Reformation
[21:07] well I guess maybe then the Book of
[21:08] Revelation will be the book of The
[21:09] Rapture
[21:10] for us
[21:12] thank God Amen Hallelujah how do we love
[21:15] the Book of Revelation praise God that's
[21:17] what these Amish people are telling me
[21:18] they're like brother Jesse the way I
[21:20] know brother man was a prophet is
[21:21] because all these Amish preachers they
[21:24] they told us not to read the book of
[21:26] Revelation too often they said you'll go
[21:28] crazy
[21:29] imagine if a preacher stood from this
[21:31] pulp and said now you don't you don't
[21:33] read that too much you're going to go
[21:34] crazy if you read the Bible too much
[21:36] that's what they told them their whole
[21:38] life
[21:38] and they always knew something's not
[21:40] right with that
[21:41] he said I know the Bible says blessed
[21:43] are those who keep these words and hear
[21:45] these words why are we going a little
[21:46] blessing instead of a lot of blessing
[21:48] and then he said as soon as he heard
[21:50] brother Brown preach on the book of
[21:52] Revenue Revelation he said it all made
[21:54] sense
[21:55] the Bible became a new Bible praise God
[21:58] oh thank God and it's like the Gates of
[22:00] Heaven the gates of paradise were open
[22:02] to the Amish community praise God oh
[22:05] that's right church amen
[22:08] God give us the book of The Rapture
[22:09] praise God the Book of Revelation oh
[22:12] thank God
[22:14] we remember John Wesley giving his
[22:16] testimony to his powerful conversion
[22:18] experience as he listened to a sermon at
[22:21] alder's gate
[22:22] where during the sermon he said he felt
[22:24] his heart strangely warmed
[22:26] and that sermon that night was from
[22:29] The Book of Romans
[22:32] praise God
[22:34] so Martin Luther the Sardis Church age
[22:37] messenger the Philadelphian Church age
[22:39] messenger
[22:40] were both enlightened and inspired by
[22:43] The Book of Romans praise God
[22:46] isn't that beautiful
[22:48] Hallelujah beautiful now there's so many
[22:51] beautiful subjects in here I'm going to
[22:52] get to this later but chapter one has
[22:54] the power of the Gospel chapters one two
[22:56] and three the Jews and Gentiles and the
[22:58] entire world are guilty having fallen
[23:00] short of God's glory justification by
[23:02] faith the meaning of baptism in four
[23:03] five and six marriage and divorce
[23:05] remember we preached on invisible Union
[23:07] and it's as if you never did in this
[23:09] first place where'd brother bam get that
[23:11] out of Romans 7.
[23:13] Roman seven right
[23:17] the battle with sin remember Paul said I
[23:19] hate what I do but then or he said I
[23:21] serve god with the with the law of my
[23:23] mind I love the law of God but then I do
[23:25] things that I hate
[23:26] that's right here that's right here
[23:28] Romans 7.
[23:30] the Assurance of God love God's love
[23:32] nothing can separate you 16 things Paul
[23:35] says nothing these 16 things cannot
[23:37] separate you from the love of God
[23:39] death sorrow sword famine nothing shall
[23:43] separate us from God's love amen amen
[23:45] hallelujah he tells us to walk in the
[23:48] spirit praise God there's no
[23:50] condemnation to them that walk in the
[23:51] spirit
[23:52] and then we see the sovereignty of God
[23:54] right Jacob have I loved Esau have I
[23:56] hate it I raise up Pharaoh for this
[23:57] person he's a vessel of Destruction unto
[24:00] me right we see the sovereignty of God
[24:02] God chooses whoever he chooses
[24:04] for whatever purpose because of
[24:06] predestination he knows what they're
[24:08] going to choose as we looked at a few
[24:09] Sundays ago and we in this book we have
[24:12] the mystery we have one of the 12
[24:13] mysteries in this book The Mystery of
[24:15] Israel's blindness
[24:18] and then we have Liberties as Christians
[24:20] and we have Kingdom truths like the
[24:22] kingdom of God is Not meat and drink
[24:25] but it's righteousness peace and joy in
[24:29] the Holy Ghost
[24:31] I forgot to say let's have a communion
[24:32] this Sunday night by God's grace I
[24:34] forgot I was going to announce that I
[24:35] forgot to say that let's let's take the
[24:36] Lord's Supper on Sunday night by God's
[24:38] grace
[24:39] sometimes I give announcements right
[24:40] during the middle of serving so
[24:41] it's a little out of order brother Jesse
[24:43] I know I forgot so forgive me forgive me
[24:44] sometimes I forget let's take I want to
[24:47] take the Lord's Supper here let me write
[24:48] that down here by God's grace
[24:51] it had come up there and I listened to
[24:52] the sermon I was trying to find a sermon
[24:54] in case there was no preacher for Sunday
[24:56] so I was listening to communion 1957
[24:58] brother Graham had some really beautiful
[24:59] quotes in there
[25:00] now here's some important quotes just
[25:02] from Brother random just just random
[25:04] quotes about the book about Romans in
[25:06] general
[25:07] remember when brother random would get
[25:09] blue and discouraged which book would he
[25:11] go to
[25:12] Romans
[25:14] he'd go to the scripture that says and
[25:16] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[25:19] God
[25:21] Hallelujah where do you go when you get
[25:22] discouraged
[25:24] well the ram goes to Roman he went to
[25:25] Romans 4.
[25:27] Romans 4.
[25:30] beautiful
[25:31] every time he got a little blue a little
[25:33] sad little depressed a little Melancholy
[25:35] what would cheer him up
[25:37] Abraham's testimony would cheer him up
[25:40] Abraham was not weak in faith and he
[25:43] considered not his own body now dead
[25:46] but he staggered not at the promise of
[25:48] God he was strong given God glory church
[25:50] if you're if you're discouraged tonight
[25:52] just give God glory
[25:54] because that's what heaven is going to
[25:56] remember praise God Heaven can't
[25:58] remember your sins because Jesus blood
[25:59] already done away with him praise God
[26:02] but let Heaven remember let there be
[26:04] memorials in heaven that you and I
[26:06] praise God in the hard times we were
[26:08] strong in faith praise God we staggered
[26:10] nods at troubles we overcame struggles
[26:12] and heaven will say we never staggered
[26:15] amen
[26:17] we were over covers we never turned back
[26:19] and so I'm turning my back on God no
[26:21] even though we fail even though we
[26:23] struggled we still got up we still kept
[26:25] moving forward we never turned our back
[26:27] on God heaven where we heaven will
[26:29] record our divine commentary brother
[26:32] Adam says our divine commentary is that
[26:34] we were strong in faith we never gave up
[26:37] we never staggered we were Overcomers
[26:39] amen
[26:41] thank God Amen
[26:43] thank you Jesus
[26:47] if you notice Paul couldn't teach the
[26:49] Corinthians deep things
[26:50] they were they were a baby Church
[26:54] they were a baby they couldn't go in
[26:56] them deep great deep messages that he
[26:59] did to the Ephesians and into the Romans
[27:01] to teach them the Deep things of God
[27:03] because they wasn't able to take it
[27:05] they just depended too much on little
[27:06] Sensations and little things like that
[27:10] just well praise the Lord I got it I
[27:11] have a revelation come to me I have a
[27:12] Psalm I have a prophecy
[27:14] now I don't know how much of that you
[27:15] know I don't know how far to go on that
[27:17] because remember he told the Corinthians
[27:19] he said you're a chaste version of
[27:21] Christ I've espoused you they were
[27:23] engaged to Christ
[27:25] now there's a brother in there that was
[27:27] having the sexual relations with his
[27:28] stepmom he had to be removed from the
[27:30] church
[27:31] right
[27:32] so there was definitely some immaturity
[27:34] there and the church had not yet mourned
[27:37] over it so that was we'd say a backflip
[27:38] in church
[27:39] right they didn't mourn over sexual sin
[27:42] but by the second book they all repented
[27:44] praise God
[27:47] so here we just see this this this
[27:49] thought that the book of Romans is a
[27:52] deep book it's full of great truths
[27:55] and great Revelations praise God
[27:58] so I preach a year and a half on this
[27:59] book
[28:01] I don't want to get any text messages
[28:02] saying brother Jesse when are you gonna
[28:03] got a book of Rome no I'm just kidding
[28:05] I'm just kidding I'm just joking Like
[28:07] the quote from Brother Branham
[28:10] it's a deep book church and we need to
[28:12] understand these truths praise God
[28:13] church that's my prayer if somebody can
[28:15] just come in here and feel like Heaven's
[28:17] been open for him then I've done my job
[28:20] and I just surrender to God if I can
[28:22] just come in here and somebody leaves
[28:23] out here a better Christian they got
[28:25] more praise for God they got a hope for
[28:27] the future they got some great blessing
[28:29] then I can say hallelujah it was worth
[28:31] it all praise God
[28:33] amen praise God
[28:36] that's what Martin Luther got out of the
[28:38] book of Romans
[28:39] he got out
[28:41] and experience where it felt like he'd
[28:43] entered into Paradise through the word
[28:44] of God
[28:46] Hallelujah
[28:48] door is your husband how many see your
[28:50] life as you living in a paradise right
[28:52] now because of God's blessings
[28:55] think about that who's living who feels
[28:57] like I'm in a paradise of God's
[28:59] blessings
[29:00] if we don't it's time to rub our eyes
[29:02] with some eye salve
[29:04] so we stopped looking at the natural
[29:06] things and look at some spiritual things
[29:09] but Amanda said you need some Joy he
[29:11] said go get the ladder in in this arcade
[29:13] room he said go get the ladder and start
[29:15] climbing up and grab you some Joy up
[29:17] there
[29:18] and the church said
[29:20] Hallelujah anybody need any faith
[29:22] tonight he said go get the ladder he
[29:24] said go climb the ladder and go up there
[29:26] and get a hold of some faith and say
[29:28] this was bought for me this is my
[29:30] possession this is my inheritance Jesus
[29:32] died so I can have faith amen
[29:35] Hallelujah
[29:38] and I know you wanna I'm just trying to
[29:39] encourage you by God's grace I'm just
[29:41] trying to
[29:42] just trying to give you some courage
[29:43] right by God's grace
[29:45] we've been together a long time and I
[29:47] plan to be together a long time as well
[29:48] by God's grace
[29:52] I was reading the book uh oh yeah this
[29:54] is
[29:55] oh yeah this is beautiful yeah I
[29:57] mentioned this earlier I just kind of
[29:58] jumped ahead I was reading over there in
[30:00] the book of Romans the fourth chapter
[30:01] where Paul wrote The Divine commentary
[30:03] on the life of Abraham now we know
[30:05] Abraham many times got kind of
[30:06] frustrated like we do
[30:09] don't raise your hands with who's been
[30:10] frustrated this week
[30:13] but when the commentary was written
[30:17] there wasn't any of his flusterations
[30:20] mentioned
[30:21] you see never mention them at all
[30:25] Oh you mean that uh that Pride you
[30:27] struggle with that's not going to be
[30:29] mentioned in heaven not a word about it
[30:33] that sexual Temptation you struggle with
[30:36] you mean that's not going to be
[30:37] mentioned in heaven not a word of it
[30:40] that lying problem you have when you lie
[30:42] like Abraham lied and Isaac lied that
[30:44] line problem I got you mean that's not
[30:46] going to be mentioned in heaven not a
[30:48] word of it
[30:50] why God's only going to let his Divine
[30:53] commentary be rich and praise God he
[30:55] forgives amen he ever lives to forgive
[30:58] praise God he'll only let the good be
[31:00] recorded that's a blessing that's the
[31:03] heritage of God's people praise God
[31:05] amen
[31:07] think about that how would you worship
[31:09] tonight how would you act tonight if you
[31:11] knew heaven was not going to record any
[31:13] of your doubts fears flustrations how
[31:17] about complaining anybody could say Amen
[31:19] to that
[31:21] amen
[31:23] God is not there's not going to be any
[31:25] record of our complaining up there in
[31:27] heaven
[31:28] there's just going to be record of all
[31:30] the times you exercise faith
[31:33] you praise God in the midst of the
[31:35] trials you were strong in faith giving
[31:38] God glory
[31:39] Heaven's going to record that uh we have
[31:42] somebody ought to say Amen to that
[31:43] praise God Amen see that's the way I
[31:45] hope mine will be wrote up there
[31:49] Oh you mean you're going to have it
[31:50] you're gonna have a testimony in heaven
[31:51] yes it's called the Lamb's Book of Life
[31:53] praise God
[31:54] hallelujah and there perhaps there's a
[31:57] book of life like uh
[31:59] like sir night and The Splendid way
[32:00] perhaps there's a special book of life
[32:02] amen and it's got your name on it praise
[32:04] God
[32:05] and it tells the story of your testimony
[32:09] amen I Hope Church how many hope they
[32:12] got a good book like that
[32:14] there is not my mistakes but just what I
[32:19] tried to do for God oh
[32:21] granted Lord that in heaven only the
[32:24] things that are recorded are all that I
[32:26] tried to do for you praise God not the
[32:28] things I did selfishly for me but only
[32:31] the things I try to do for you let that
[32:33] be recorded in heaven sister who I hope
[32:35] that's how it is Amen brother Austin I
[32:38] hope that having only records what we
[32:40] tried to do for Jesus amen we tried to
[32:42] sing some songs and record some songs
[32:44] for Jesus amen hallelujah we tried to
[32:47] give God praise we tried to give God
[32:49] glory we tried to win souls we tried to

[33:22] intentions praise God oh thank God

[33:30] night generation he's speaking of the
[33:32] Jews and they still got blinded their
[33:34] eyes said God did that's what he said
[33:36] God knows what he wants so here brother
[33:38] I'm saying in Romans we learn God does
[33:40] whatever he wants
[33:42] we don't tell God what to do God tells
[33:45] us what to do
[33:47] we cannot tell them what to do did not
[33:49] Paul in the Book of Romans 8 chapter say
[33:50] God raise up pharaoh and hard in his
[33:52] heart blind his eyes for the same
[33:53] purpose that he might
[33:55] that I'm sorry that his will might be
[33:57] worked was not Esau and Jacob Esau
[33:59] refused before the boy was ever born God
[34:02] despised him you see it's all working
[34:04] according to God's Great predestination
[34:06] he's not one that's asleep he knows
[34:10] exactly Church let's have him let's have
[34:13] courage for our lost loved ones tonight
[34:15] that God has orchestrated everything by
[34:19] predestination first be thankful that
[34:21] you're in the faith
[34:22] but now have some courage that God's Got
[34:25] A Plan amen
[34:27] God still has a plan it might not look
[34:29] like it might not feel like it not might
[34:31] not sound like it but God's got a
[34:33] predestinated plan and God knows what
[34:36] he's doing and God's plan is perfect our
[34:38] plans would be awful but God has the
[34:40] best plan Hallelujah
[34:42] amen
[34:44] he's not the one that's asleep Church
[34:47] we're the ones that go to sleep
[34:49] we're the ones who get tired of praying
[34:51] we're the ones who give up we're the
[34:53] ones who get discouraged sometimes but
[34:55] God is faithful praise God
[34:59] thank you Lord
[35:03] I'm going to skip this one this one this
[35:04] just shows how Paul got the inspiration
[35:07] uh
[35:08] that's from the fifth seal this just
[35:10] shows brother random proves Jews can be
[35:12] saved in the fist seal through the book
[35:14] of Romans so think about that again
[35:18] to prove a mystery of God brother Ram to
[35:22] prove a mystery in Revelation brother
[35:23] went to the Book of Romans to prove it
[35:27] praise God
[35:28] it's not only does it open up the gates
[35:30] of paradise it also opens up the seals
[35:33] and the church said right
[35:36] how did Brother Bear improve the seals
[35:38] are right from other scriptures
[35:40] in the Bible
[35:41] right because not one word can
[35:43] contradict another
[35:46] Hallelujah we ought to be the most
[35:47] confident people when we do uh debating
[35:49] with people Austin and I would do it on
[35:51] text you know we debate with people or I
[35:52] debate online or whatever we ought to be
[35:54] the most confident people because we
[35:55] know God's word cannot fail and if God
[35:58] has given us or thus saith the Lord that
[36:00] we know it's true from Genesis to
[36:01] Revelation praise God
[36:03] Hallelujah
[36:07] now before we get into chapter one here
[36:10] I didn't set a timer
[36:14] schofield's outline I think Scofield was
[36:16] inspired on many things
[36:19] not all he was a trinitarian but many
[36:20] things
[36:21] so here it says yes seven steps plus the
[36:25] introduction it doesn't come the
[36:26] introduction so we get the introduction
[36:27] The Book of Romans the first section is
[36:30] the whole world I will whole hole that's
[36:32] wrong I meant to say whole world the
[36:34] whole whole of the world
[36:35] the whole whole people are guilty before
[36:37] God
[36:40] from chapter 1 18 to chapter 3 20.
[36:44] the second section is we're justified by
[36:46] faith and that's the solution for all of
[36:49] our guilt
[36:50] if anybody feels guilty tonight let's
[36:52] take your attention to the blood of
[36:54] Jesus Christ
[36:55] because that's where you can lose your
[36:57] guilt
[36:59] right that's where you can lose your
[37:01] depression that's where you can lose
[37:02] your bad attitude you can find all
[37:04] Deliverance in the cross praise God
[37:07] it all flows out because love thrown out
[37:10] of the Cross Hallelujah
[37:12] God's mercy God's grace it all flows out
[37:16] of the Cross praise God if you need hope
[37:18] look to the Cross if you need
[37:20] forgiveness look to the Cross if you
[37:21] need courage look to the Cross amen if
[37:24] you need Victory look to the Cross if
[37:25] you need anything look that Jesus's
[37:27] cross amen
[37:28] oh Hallelujah
[37:30] praise God
[37:36] Church be encouraged keep seeking God
[37:38] you know there's a saint one of the
[37:39] Saints there I forget her name but she's
[37:41] seen a vision of the Lord she saw a
[37:43] vision of the Lord recently
[37:45] I know a young girl who saw a vision of
[37:48] the Lord too of course this was an adult
[37:51] lady
[37:52] but she drew a picture of it do I have
[37:54] it yeah I think I got it she drew a
[37:56] picture of her she was so shocked she
[37:57] woke up just uh in in shock yeah here it
[38:00] is
[38:02] maybe I can airdrop this here
[38:05] to show it to you just be encouraged God
[38:07] is speaking to people
[38:09] and that's what I love here's a here's a
[38:11] person fresh in the out of the
[38:12] domination and she's hungering after God
[38:14] and God shows her vision
[38:17] beautiful okay I think it's coming
[38:19] through right now there it is
[38:24] all right
[38:26] I'm gonna make this larger here we go
[38:29] so she had this vision
[38:31] and she drew it out she said now it's
[38:33] hard to see in here but this is a throne
[38:34] she said I think this was the throne
[38:36] and you have this blue glory and this
[38:39] yellow anointing and then all this she
[38:41] saw this in a vision
[38:43] and she sent a copy of this to all of
[38:45] her Amish family even the ones that
[38:47] won't come out
[38:48] and she said Jesus is Alive
[38:51] amen praise God
[38:54] that look familiar cares I don't know
[38:59] hopefully it does
[39:01] but see when people are hungering for
[39:03] God gods are showing up in their dreams
[39:05] amen hallelujah praise God you're hungry
[39:08] for God God's gonna show up on the job
[39:10] Hallelujah God's going to show up in the
[39:11] school praise God he's going to show up
[39:14] when you're doing chores amen washing
[39:16] dishes or whatever you're doing there by
[39:17] the by the bathroom by the sink window
[39:20] praise God he's going to show up in your
[39:22] car sister that's right amen hallelujah
[39:26] let's keep our hearts and Minds on God
[39:28] he's real he's here to bless us he's
[39:30] here to encourage us he's here to show
[39:32] us how real he is praise God
[39:36] that's one benefit technology right
[39:38] there
[39:39] pretty nice
[39:44] just so you know I put out videos about
[39:46] all these lies coming out of random
[39:48] Tabernacle put on a new one today if
[39:49] you're interested in those kind of
[39:50] things brother Jose gave me a comment he
[39:52] said I love this brother Jesse God bless
[39:54] you I said God bless you buddy I miss
[39:56] you
[39:57] praise God somebody's got to do it
[40:00] those preachers told Brother Brown said
[40:02] brother Branham it's not your job to
[40:03] ball out the women with uh Bob's hair
[40:05] and wear her makeup he said it's the
[40:07] past program it's the pastor's job to do
[40:09] it remember Ram said well if the pastors
[40:12] don't do it somebody's got a ball out
[40:13] against it
[40:14] so I put that quote on the first video I
[40:16] said if they ain't gonna do it I'm gonna
[40:17] do it praise God
[40:19] I'm gonna let my voice speak against the
[40:21] lies because I got a revelation amen the
[40:24] Gates of Heaven have opened unto me
[40:25] praise God I've got a revelation of
[40:28] Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[40:31] and if we've got discernment if
[40:33] anybody's gotten discernment in this
[40:34] church we ought to know the right Spirit
[40:36] from the wrong spirit
[40:38] and the church said I'm glad I got the
[40:41] Holy Ghost I'm glad I got the sermon
[40:43] amen I can judge that's not from God
[40:46] that is from God
[40:48] you see the people that won't say
[40:50] something that shows they don't have the
[40:51] gift of discernment or that it's just so
[40:52] weak and frail they can't even use it
[40:55] because it's so it's so lazy that so how
[40:58] do you say unexercise it's not even a
[40:59] word it's so uh it's so neglected
[41:01] there's the word all right
[41:04] try to get better at English here
[41:05] because
[41:07] that's the solution church for all of
[41:09] our guilt is the cross
[41:12] and then we see the Believers walk in in
[41:13] the Holy Spirit from chapter 5 12 on to
[41:16] six I'm sorry 813 and then the final
[41:19] result the blessing of God that's that
[41:21] that section on the love of God nothing
[41:23] can separate us from God's love
[41:25] what is the whole conclusion of this
[41:28] nothing can separate us from God's love
[41:31] nothing nothing can separate you from
[41:33] the love of God in Christ Jesus
[41:36] do you feel loved tonight by Jesus you
[41:38] want to
[41:39] even if other people don't feel you
[41:40] don't feel people loving you you ought
[41:42] to feel that Jesus loves you
[41:44] because he does
[41:46] he's faithful
[41:48] and then God's promises to Israel
[41:50] chapters 9 through 11.
[41:53] and then the Christian Life and service
[41:55] now remember that Asbury Revival was
[41:57] started by preaching Romans in that
[41:59] interesting Romans 12 that
[42:01] denominational Revival of justification
[42:02] it was started by preaching Romans 12.
[42:07] I'm glad we had a Revival out of Psalms
[42:09] 49.
[42:11] hey that's what we had amen that's what
[42:14] I got praise God Amen
[42:17] where's the Acura Revival right here
[42:18] right here
[42:19] here I am here you are you're the actor
[42:23] Revival praise God when you're revived
[42:25] you feel alive in Christ you're the
[42:27] Revival praise God
[42:29] I'm not waiting for it to come it's in
[42:31] me praise God hallelujah I'm revered I'm
[42:34] not feeling dead to Christ I'm feeling
[42:36] alive hallelujah thank God I feel alive
[42:38] amen
[42:40] thank God
[42:47] Glory
[42:50] I'm so revived I got to make sure I
[42:51] don't hit my head when I'm jumping
[42:52] around in their garages over there so
[42:54] they got the garage door things hanging
[42:56] I gotta make sure okay make sure I don't
[42:57] hit that praise God
[42:58] jump like David jumps amen
[43:01] Lori
[43:04] now here's a brief description of Rome
[43:06] and I got the websites you know if
[43:07] you're interested in reading more but I
[43:09] wrote more on my book there about the
[43:12] um
[43:13] the city of Rome in the first century
[43:16] but I didn't have a chance to review it
[43:18] so maybe Lord willing we'll look at that
[43:20] next week by God's grace now I don't
[43:22] know if you knew this church but the
[43:23] Roman Emperor Claudius banished all the
[43:25] Jews from Rome
[43:27] around 49 A.D now they already had they
[43:30] already had Christian churches in Rome
[43:32] they were Jew and Gentile churches
[43:34] but then he Claudius banned all the Jews
[43:37] I forget why but then he only lived five
[43:40] more years and after he died all the
[43:42] Jewish Christians came back
[43:44] but they found it in different
[43:45] conditions
[43:47] so when they were there they would they
[43:49] would all they would preach Jesus but
[43:50] they'd also preach Moses they could see
[43:51] the connections
[43:53] well five years later if all the Jews
[43:55] are gone and nobody knows the Torah
[43:58] what are you going to preach well you're
[43:59] going to preach Christ and Kim crucified
[44:01] right
[44:03] well now that makes sense why did Paul
[44:04] have to write the things he did in the
[44:06] Book of Romans
[44:08] because he's dealing with churches that
[44:11] had a little bit of Jewish Foundation
[44:12] they forgot it all
[44:14] and now the Jews come back and there's
[44:17] problems in the church
[44:20] now there'd never be any problems in our
[44:21] church
[44:23] there would never be a problem in the
[44:25] bride of Christ Fellowship
[44:27] of course there are right we all we at
[44:30] one time uh all of us are problems at
[44:32] one time or another right we all we all
[44:34] we all get in the flesh sometimes
[44:38] but you you know with with Gentiles they
[44:40] wouldn't know the Old Testament the Jews
[44:43] would be more prone to be what more
[44:45] legal right or more
[44:49] more disciplined
[44:51] things like that and so created some
[44:54] problems
[44:55] so Paul had to write a letter that would
[44:57] clear up ever all the arguments in the
[44:59] church
[45:01] and he ends up writing the most
[45:03] beautiful piece of literature some
[45:04] preachers say in the entire Bible
[45:09] now of course that's Up For Debate
[45:13] yeah well I think the Book of Revelation
[45:14] is more beautiful no brothers brother
[45:15] it's Romans brother let's not argue
[45:17] about that let's keep the peace of the
[45:18] church
[45:20] now Paul writes this letter you know
[45:22] three to six years
[45:24] after the Jews came back and they've
[45:26] been having some trouble
[45:27] understanding and loving one another
[45:29] think about and think about Romans 12
[45:31] think about the things Paul addressed to
[45:32] these people
[45:34] just
[45:35] do not be overcome with evil but
[45:37] overcome in the church brother Paul yes
[45:40] in the church
[45:42] in the church
[45:44] overcoming evil with good
[45:48] oh my
[45:50] God that's right church sometimes
[45:51] churches have evil in them don't they
[45:55] it's called leaven right it's called sin
[45:57] unconfessed sin or it's called complexes
[46:02] that doesn't mean we deserve every time
[46:03] we get a complex I'm leaving the church
[46:04] well pretty soon you're gonna have no
[46:05] churches to go to whatever Church you go
[46:07] to You're gonna take your complex there
[46:09] the thing to do is clean out your heart
[46:12] and talk to the person or people about
[46:14] it so there's no more complex
[46:17] and then you can keep moving on with God
[46:20] right I'm thankful there's not a lot of
[46:22] churches around here because in the
[46:23] other part of Ohio there's lots of
[46:25] churches close together and people just
[46:26] church out from one Church to the other
[46:29] well I don't like how it's going here
[46:31] I'll go to this one then pretty soon I
[46:32] don't like this one I'll go to the other
[46:34] one when you're going to get a
[46:35] revelation of of your flock you little
[46:38] sheep
[46:39] you sweet little humble sheep when are
[46:40] you going to get a revelation of where
[46:41] your flock is
[46:44] when when in the natural do you see
[46:46] sheep changing flocks oh my that's a
[46:47] good thought
[46:48] well Shepherd I'd like to take my
[46:51] fellowship card and go somewhere else is
[46:53] that okay sir
[46:55] no they want to stay with their family
[46:56] Glory
[46:57] so should you amen you should want to
[46:59] stay with your spiritual family praise
[47:01] God
[47:04] well you're my third Shepherd and in as
[47:06] many years can I go see my four Shepherd
[47:08] now
[47:09] how many Shepherds do you need
[47:11] can't you find which one did God which
[47:14] one did God I thought I'd pray they
[47:16] ought to pray which one did God ordain
[47:18] to feed my soul
[47:20] now people have a choice you can drive
[47:22] an hour 15 away or I guess you could
[47:24] drive 30 minutes south right if you go
[47:26] to Dalton
[47:28] but the main thing is we don't care
[47:29] where you go the main thing is have a
[47:31] revelation that you're in the right spot
[47:33] praise God
[47:35] because if you keep running from
[47:36] problems if you keep leaving problems
[47:39] you're going to be the problem
[47:40] eventually more problems are going to
[47:41] come up
[47:46] so Paul wrote this letter how can I
[47:48] bring peace to a lot of these situations
[47:50] in the church
[47:51] praise God
[47:53] I got this from a different website the
[47:54] ESV now I don't believe in the ESV but I
[47:56] had a pretty good write-up and I had
[47:57] some good scripts so go to I go to
[47:59] Romans 15 22. you got your Bibles there
[48:01] I mean by Malachi Lydia Emma Reed up
[48:03] here maybe
[48:04] Romans 15 22. it's just a good thought I
[48:07] never had seen it like this before
[48:11] Romans 15 22. um so here this website
[48:15] said the theme of Romans is the Cross of
[48:18] Christ
[48:19] God judges sin and at the same time he
[48:21] shows saving Mercy that's a pretty good
[48:23] summary you know and if you summoned up
[48:25] in one sentence that's a pretty good
[48:26] summary
[48:28] now the purpose Paul wrote Romans to
[48:30] unite the Jewish and Gentile Christians
[48:32] in Rome in the gospel I don't that sound
[48:34] familiar we just got through Colossians
[48:36] what happened in chapter two he had to
[48:38] he had to tell the Jews not to make
[48:40] Revelation I'm sorry regulations about
[48:42] New Moon days
[48:43] or keeping this sabbath day or that
[48:45] Sabbath day
[48:46] so in any church you have people that
[48:48] are more legalistic and then you have
[48:49] more people that are less
[48:51] more Carefree because they like that
[48:53] care remember he's a better word
[48:56] and they get too Carefree so think about
[48:58] which one are you well bro Jess I'm
[49:00] always right down the middle of the road
[49:01] I hope that's true
[49:03] something tells me that's probably not
[49:04] right
[49:07] see all of us are either you know a
[49:09] little more legalistic and rules
[49:11] regulations
[49:12] or just Carefree I'm just
[49:15] I'm just God's blessing to the world you
[49:17] know
[49:17] it don't matter if I pray or not don't
[49:19] matter if I read my Bible God is
[49:20] Anointed me
[49:22] come on somebody
[49:24] my goodness
[49:26] we all need a good balance right down
[49:29] the middle praise God
[49:30] the Bible says search out your own
[49:32] salvation with fear and trembling and
[49:34] then the Bible says Rejoice always and
[49:36] again I say rejoice amen
[49:38] Hallelujah
[49:41] that's what we need
[49:43] we people who are balanced praise God
[49:45] they got some regulations in their life
[49:47] they know they got to keep this thing up
[49:49] they got to keep good habits or else
[49:50] they're going to get in bad habits
[49:52] but they also know there's freedom and
[49:53] liberty if I make a mistake
[49:55] or if I get tired if I get frustrated if
[49:57] I get flusterations my Divine commentary
[50:00] will still say no charges
[50:03] Jesus dropped the charges amen
[50:06] hallelujah
[50:08] but still say no charges Satan can can
[50:12] lay no charges to God's elect Hallelujah
[50:15] ah I feel like preaching tonight praise
[50:16] God hey man thank God Amen
[50:21] thank you Jesus
[50:25] now this was new to me I never realized
[50:27] this
[50:28] part of the reason he wrote was because
[50:30] he was going to make Rome a pit stop on
[50:33] his way because he wanted to go to Spain
[50:35] think about that from Jerusalem to Spain
[50:38] by boat and foot the church said
[50:43] I need to calculate how many miles that
[50:45] is
[50:46] now which one of you are willing to do
[50:47] that
[50:48] what am I am I willing to do that
[50:51] now like I said I want to do Outreach
[50:53] work like I told the Amish down there in
[50:55] the sermon I think you heard it
[50:56] unless that was the moment when the live
[50:58] stream went out so sorry about that
[51:00] but I said you know you got to give
[51:01] tithes and offerings and you do
[51:03] something with that let the pastor live
[51:05] off it you can just study preach and
[51:06] pray or I said put it to missionaries
[51:10] I said you could buy a van
[51:13] and preachers can go preach to the Amish

[52:33] Jesus amen ah Hallelujah I'm also
[52:36] preaching First Corinthians 1 now my God
[52:39] all right Malachi read uh verse 22 15
[52:42] 22. so now this was a new goal he had he
[52:45] said if I can straighten out the
[52:47] problems there in Rome I can make it
[52:49] like a center stop I'll stop there on my
[52:52] way
[52:52] to go to Spain so Malachi 22.
[53:00] all right now read 23 there Emma thank
[53:02] you
[53:09] amen and 24 Lydia
[53:21] amen that was brand new to me
[53:24] she had a purpose I've got a I've got to
[53:26] clear up all the
[53:27] all the divisions among Jews and
[53:29] gentiles
[53:31] in other words all the legalists in the
[53:33] church and all the Carefree people in
[53:34] the church
[53:36] I gotta find a way to unite people that
[53:39] have two different World Views
[53:42] but they both say they believe in Christ
[53:44] how can I unite them I know how by the
[53:46] word of God
[53:48] because faith comes by hearing hearing
[53:50] by the word of God
[53:52] the word of God will always unite True
[53:54] Believers
[53:56] that's exactly right
[54:00] Hallelujah
[54:02] all right now get your Bibles here I'm
[54:04] gonna that was my last slide because I
[54:06] took my other notes Here
[54:08] on the uh
[54:10] phone here didn't have a chance to put
[54:12] them on the slides but I know you don't
[54:13] care praise God I don't care either
[54:15] it's just nice it just kind of slows me
[54:17] down that's why I do the slides it slows
[54:18] me down sister Emma
[54:19] slows me down
[54:21] and also it you know when I use without
[54:23] I used to preach without the Powerpoints
[54:25] I used to have to scroll like where's
[54:26] that part at where's that part at
[54:27] where's that it was a really really
[54:29] frustrating for me but
[54:30] now sometimes I still do that but not as
[54:32] much
[54:33] okay Romans 1 verse one
[54:39] all right now we'll try to get down to
[54:41] verse 12 okay we'll try to finish up
[54:43] here I'll make it hang on for a few more
[54:44] minutes praise God
[54:45] if you're sleepy like brother Cam said
[54:47] or like uh brother uh what's the other
[54:49] brother said that just rebuke that
[54:50] sleepy Spirit praise God
[54:52] I'm gonna stay awake I'm gonna hear the
[54:54] word of God
[54:55] this is the open Gates of paradise for
[54:57] me
[54:59] amen praise God if it was open gates for
[55:01] Martin Luther it let it be the open
[55:02] gates for me praise God
[55:05] that I can rejoice in the Book of Romans
[55:09] first one
[55:11] Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to
[55:13] be an apostle separated unto the gospel
[55:16] of God in our church we've got to see
[55:17] this too God has called you and God has
[55:20] separated you to be a Christian
[55:22] there's there's a reason you're here in
[55:25] Akron you are separated unto God's work
[55:28] in other words God knew you couldn't do
[55:30] the work anywhere else you had to do it
[55:32] here
[55:33] praise God you're called and separated
[55:35] remember in Acts 17 God knows the
[55:38] boundaries of your habitation
[55:40] he determined where you would live on
[55:43] purpose
[55:44] because that's where he called you to
[55:47] Hallelujah
[55:53] that's right
[55:55] verse 2. I mean you can ask my wife how
[55:58] many times have family and friends told
[55:59] me boy brother Jesse I wish you lived
[56:01] close to us we go to your church
[56:05] well they have a choice they could leave
[56:06] and they could come to Akron
[56:09] they really if they really like my
[56:10] Precision that much they really feel the
[56:12] spirit of God they'd come here
[56:15] and God would bless them praise God
[56:17] but instead they choose to live a
[56:18] foolish virgin life or something like
[56:20] that
[56:21] that's their choice
[56:23] but they don't have to live like that
[56:25] I'll tell you you take a stand for God
[56:26] God will stand for you
[56:29] praise God
[56:31] amen
[56:32] I have an Uber family family members
[56:34] Emma some of our family members said
[56:35] well brother Jesse if you were here uh
[56:37] you we go to your church no you wouldn't
[56:42] because if you love me that much you
[56:43] come here
[56:45] praise God
[56:47] now verse two which he promised a four
[56:50] what he promised a separated gospel he
[56:54] promised the gospel of four by His
[56:56] prophets in the Holy scriptures
[57:00] now later you'll see that in Romans 9 10
[57:03] 11. remember it talks about Hosea and
[57:05] Isaiah all their prophecy Jeremiah they
[57:08] all prophesied that the Gentiles would
[57:10] receive salvation thank God we got it
[57:12] amen ah thank God we can be saved
[57:15] Hallelujah
[57:17] right verse 3 concerning his son Jesus
[57:19] Christ Our Lord which was made of the
[57:21] seed of David according to the flesh of
[57:24] course that traces him that satisfies
[57:25] the Jews right there they care about
[57:27] that Gentiles not really a big deal
[57:29] satisfies the Jews
[57:30] verse four now look at this and declare
[57:32] to be the Son of God with power now
[57:34] don't the Bible say when you get the
[57:36] Holy Ghost it's power
[57:38] you're not the Son of God but you're a
[57:40] child of God and you've got power too
[57:43] praise God
[57:44] amen Jesus Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[57:47] right in Acts 10 48 I believe
[57:50] how God anointed Jesus Christ with the
[57:52] Holy Ghost and he went around doing
[57:53] signs Miracles and wonders because of
[57:55] the anointing that was on him amen may
[57:58] God anoint us with his power to do the
[58:01] works that he wants us to do in this
[58:03] place praise God
[58:04] I'm talking about Akron that's what I'm
[58:06] talking about or Doylestown
[58:08] right is that where we all live in
[58:09] actually I could endorse town
[58:12] Barberton yeah that's right Barbara
[58:13] there we go Barbara thank you any other
[58:15] place uh
[58:17] Coventry
[58:20] I'm not sure your address
[58:23] but in this location here this General
[58:25] location
[58:26] and he's got power according to the
[58:28] spirit of Holiness now see what gives
[58:30] you power living a holy life
[58:33] remember brother can't preach on
[58:34] consecration brother Brooks preach on it
[58:35] too
[58:38] consecration brings power
[58:41] when you're consecrated to God's word
[58:43] you'll see power in your life more power
[58:45] how many can say Amen to that
[58:48] when you're really doing when you're
[58:49] really trying to follow God the best of
[58:51] your ability you find more power in
[58:53] those moments
[58:54] Spirit of holiness
[58:57] praise God because God is God has a law
[59:00] right the law of the Holy Spirit
[59:02] what a man uh what a man sows that's
[59:06] what he reaps
[59:07] praise God
[59:10] now
[59:12] by the resurrection from the dead for
[59:13] finishing verse 4. I want to stop just I
[59:16] want to make a few comments on verse
[59:18] five by whom we have received Grace and
[59:20] apostleship so Jesus Christ gave you
[59:22] Grace how many could say thank you for
[59:23] that gift he gave the Bible said he gave
[59:26] you Grace
[59:27] how many received it now
[59:29] see Jesus tried to give Judas the grace
[59:31] but he turned it down
[59:33] right but you and I have not just just
[59:35] been given it we've kept it we've
[59:38] received it church we live by it praise
[59:40] God and if you read Paul's writings he
[59:42] said I labor by the grace of God
[59:45] ah I work by God's grace oh God help me
[59:49] always to work by your grace
[59:51] your favor your unmarried favor in my
[59:53] life
[59:55] an apostleship so Paul I'm sorry Paul
[59:58] received an apostle from Jesus Christ
[1:00:00] for what why do you get Grace and
[1:00:01] apostleship for what for obedience to
[1:00:04] the faith among all nations for his name
[1:00:08] so God called you God Gave You spiritual
[1:00:11] power over Satan so you would obey the
[1:00:14] faith and glorify his name
[1:00:18] so it's power to obey it's power to keep
[1:00:21] the word of God tonight
[1:00:23] it's power to keep the word of God
[1:00:25] tomorrow praise God
[1:00:28] for this nation for those of us in this
[1:00:31] nation it's power for us to obey the
[1:00:33] word of God while we're living in the
[1:00:35] United States of America praise God let
[1:00:37] the whole nation do whatever they want
[1:00:38] but we are called to obedience in this
[1:00:41] nation
[1:00:42] Hallelujah
[1:00:44] verse 6 among whom here also called of
[1:00:48] Jesus Christ thank God
[1:00:51] to all that be in Rome now here he gets
[1:00:53] to the Romans beloved of God
[1:00:56] called to be Saints grace to you and
[1:00:59] peace from God our Father and our Lord

[1:01:18] Solomon and this unified you're the
[1:01:21] apple of his eye
[1:01:22] in other words when he looks at you he

[1:02:31] praise God Amen you caught me I'll do
[1:02:34] what you called me to do praise God
[1:02:37] that's what we need today we need people
[1:02:38] to do what God's called us to do
[1:02:41] verse eight first I thank my God through
[1:02:43] Jesus Christ for you all
[1:02:46] I can say the same I thank God for
[1:02:47] everybody in our church
[1:02:49] I thank God for every saint in Akron
[1:02:52] don't you
[1:02:53] aren't you grateful don't you miss the
[1:02:55] Saints when they don't come to church
[1:02:57] I'm like oh Lord help him Jesus
[1:03:00] where are they help them Lord have mercy
[1:03:04] so first of all I thank God for all you
[1:03:07] all through Christ that your faith is
[1:03:09] spoken of throughout the world now this
[1:03:11] is something I want to stop on for a
[1:03:12] moment
[1:03:13] this church must have had testimonies
[1:03:15] that were so powerful they were spread
[1:03:19] all around the world
[1:03:23] all around the world
[1:03:25] now
[1:03:27] we're not in a competition right
[1:03:30] but there's some testimonies that travel
[1:03:31] further than others
[1:03:34] so like my wife and I we're part of the
[1:03:36] Lima Revival it's traveled around the
[1:03:38] nation I don't know if it's probably not
[1:03:39] the world
[1:03:42] but it has traveled around the nation
[1:03:46] and people say oh you're in that group
[1:03:47] with brother Brooks and okay that was
[1:03:49] you you were in there yeah that's
[1:03:51] that was by God's grace I didn't know
[1:03:52] what was going on I was just I just felt
[1:03:54] like the gates of paradise were open to
[1:03:56] me I just walked in the gates amen I was
[1:03:59] baptized and started serving the lord
[1:04:01] and loving God
[1:04:03] but that people hear about your faith
[1:04:07] and it spreads that's why I love the
[1:04:09] podcast that we got to do
[1:04:10] and the testimonies in the videos
[1:04:12] so now people all around the world can
[1:04:14] know
[1:04:15] what God's done in our lives
[1:04:18] that's the nice thing about technology
[1:04:20] people can hear about the faith of
[1:04:22] sister Hua
[1:04:23] people can hear about the faith of
[1:04:24] brother amen
[1:04:26] and brother Austin's face
[1:04:28] which his testimony is the highest
[1:04:30] downloaded testimony out of all of ours
[1:04:32] part one brother they really like part
[1:04:34] one
[1:04:35] part two and three are a little bit far
[1:04:37] behind but part one is the that's higher
[1:04:39] than my testimony and the amen testimony
[1:04:41] everybody's testimony
[1:04:43] Austin testimony shook somebody up I
[1:04:45] think it's around 200 downloads or
[1:04:46] something like that oh we just passed 2
[1:04:48] 000 downloads on all of our podcasts so
[1:04:50] that was pretty neat to see that we just
[1:04:51] been doing it for a year you know it's
[1:04:52] nice to see wow 2 000 people wanted to
[1:04:54] download our our testimonies
[1:04:58] but there's some testimonies like the
[1:05:00] the sister healed there in Tim Pruitt's
[1:05:02] church that one's gone around the world
[1:05:04] she's healed of cancer
[1:05:06] and she was she was going to the doctor
[1:05:07] on Monday it's a beautiful story if you
[1:05:09] haven't watched it I'd encourage you to
[1:05:10] watch it I think her last name is Sister
[1:05:12] butts I think is his last name if I'm
[1:05:13] not mistaken
[1:05:15] was it olena
[1:05:17] Alina right and you've been to their
[1:05:19] church that's right there you can
[1:05:21] well she was diagnosed with cancer and a
[1:05:23] terminal cancer
[1:05:25] and she went to church you know as usual
[1:05:27] on a Sunday she was going the next day
[1:05:29] for a scan the next scans and brother
[1:05:31] Tim started singing uh leaning on the
[1:05:33] Everlasting Arms
[1:05:34] and I think the holy spirit said you are
[1:05:37] completely cancer free
[1:05:39] and she started dancing they got the
[1:05:40] video she started dancing around the
[1:05:42] church like this ah hallelujah thank you
[1:05:45] Jesus she went around the church around
[1:05:47] the church and sure enough Church they
[1:05:48] went she went to the doctor the next day
[1:05:50] they did the scans she put her hands up
[1:05:51] like this no cancer
[1:05:55] the previous one because you can see it
[1:05:56] it's on Facebook and everything big old
[1:05:58] cancer right there
[1:06:00] next scan no cancer who did that Jesus
[1:06:03] ah I've heard of your faith
[1:06:06] evening light Tabernacle
[1:06:09] it's going around the world praise God
[1:06:12] now we thank God for that that's
[1:06:14] wonderful
[1:06:16] but now who wants to get cancer for that
[1:06:18] kind of a testimony
[1:06:20] let's see let's think about these things
[1:06:23] no I think it's just God's grace God's
[1:06:25] mercy
[1:06:27] and so the Point Church I want to bring
[1:06:29] out is that some testimonies go around
[1:06:31] the world others are less known but
[1:06:34] they're all known to Jesus
[1:06:39] absolutely this and you can make them
[1:06:40] known to your family and friends
[1:06:44] not all of them are going to go around
[1:06:46] the world
[1:06:47] but they can go around your family
[1:06:51] like that dream that sister had there
[1:06:52] yeah that's good that's good time I
[1:06:54] didn't think about that she sent a copy
[1:06:56] to everybody in her family
[1:06:58] look God show me a vision look at that
[1:06:59] she got a glimpse of the Throne of that
[1:07:03] I've never had that I've been serving
[1:07:04] God for 23 years I've never had that
[1:07:07] thank God Amen thank God I'm happy for a
[1:07:10] praise God
[1:07:12] I got some Godly jealousy sure yeah
[1:07:14] of course
[1:07:16] but in a good way Lord speak to me give
[1:07:19] me dreams missions okay I'll come back
[1:07:21] on Sunday with a dream revision
[1:07:23] if not I'm still serving Jesus
[1:07:26] remember Church
[1:07:27] the world may not know but God knows
[1:07:30] amen
[1:07:31] this is what Jesus told the Saints in
[1:07:34] the church ages in Revelation 2 2
[1:07:36] Revelation 2 9 Revelation 2 13
[1:07:38] Revelation 2 19 Revelation 3 1
[1:07:40] Revelation 3 8 and Revelation 3 15 Jesus
[1:07:44] said I know your Works let's say it
[1:07:47] again Jesus said I know your work he's
[1:07:50] watching you praise God he's seeing all
[1:07:52] of us you're trying to do amen and he
[1:07:55] writes it down he's keeping track even
[1:07:57] if the world doesn't know it Jesus knows
[1:07:59] that praise God
[1:08:01] he's going to bless you for that
[1:08:03] Hallelujah
[1:08:09] remember church he can be touched by the
[1:08:11] feeling of your infirmities
[1:08:13] so in the midst of your hardest trial
[1:08:15] when you feel pain or you feel
[1:08:17] discouragement or you feel rejected or
[1:08:20] you feel guilt that's the time to reach
[1:08:22] out to somebody who understands how you
[1:08:24] feel praise God
[1:08:25] that's the time to reach out to Christ
[1:08:28] because he knows your Works he knows the
[1:08:30] testimonies he knows what you're going
[1:08:32] through
[1:08:33] Hallelujah Hebrews 7 25 says he ever
[1:08:36] lives to make intercession for you
[1:08:42] in church the world like I've said
[1:08:44] before I don't care if my little humble
[1:08:46] insignificant life I don't care
[1:08:48] if anybody knows about me like that song
[1:08:49] says I only want them know about Jesus I
[1:08:51] don't care if they know my name I just
[1:08:53] want them to know Jesus's name
[1:08:55] because I can't do nothing for them but
[1:08:57] Jesus can change their life Jesus can
[1:08:59] give them eternal life amen
[1:09:02] oh thank God
[1:09:05] thank you Jesus
[1:09:08] but they had a faith that was worldwide
[1:09:11] known
[1:09:12] like brother Branson
[1:09:14] known around the world
[1:09:17] all right here we go verse 9 for God is
[1:09:20] my witness whom I serve with my spirit
[1:09:22] how do you serve God church with your
[1:09:23] mind
[1:09:24] remember your soul is always your soul
[1:09:26] is never going to sin and the church
[1:09:27] said
[1:09:29] but you've got to bring your mind into a
[1:09:31] servant to the word of God
[1:09:35] that means you've got to choose not to
[1:09:37] think about the lies you've got to
[1:09:39] choose and serve god with your mind
[1:09:42] you got to bring your mind and your
[1:09:44] thoughts into subjection he didn't say I
[1:09:46] serve God with my soul now of course if
[1:09:47] the Holy Spirit float out of his soul
[1:09:49] but he said I serve God with my thought
[1:09:51] life
[1:09:53] I have to surrender my thoughts to God
[1:09:58] Hallelujah
[1:10:02] I serve with my spirit in the gospel of
[1:10:04] his son that without ceasing I make
[1:10:06] mention of you always in my prayers and
[1:10:08] that's something didn't we read that in
[1:10:09] the other in the other book
[1:10:11] he's always praying for the Philippians
[1:10:12] he's always praying for the Colossians
[1:10:14] and he's always praying for the Romans
[1:10:16] God help us to always pray for somebody
[1:10:18] that's why I put that on there I'm gonna
[1:10:19] pray for brother Jim's church I'm
[1:10:20] praying for the brother canisters if I
[1:10:22] can't pray for anybody else I ought to
[1:10:23] pray for them praise God as good as
[1:10:24] they've been to me
[1:10:26] it's wonderful we've had services with
[1:10:28] all their preachers you know
[1:10:30] I ought to remember somebody praise God
[1:10:33] he said just praying for myself all the
[1:10:35] time I want to pray for somebody else
[1:10:36] right Church
[1:10:39] verse 10 I'm almost done making a
[1:10:41] requests if by any means now at length I
[1:10:44] might have a prosperous journey by the
[1:10:45] will of God to come unto you see he was
[1:10:48] just praying I just wanted to come see
[1:10:49] you and eventually he did go to Rome
[1:10:50] church he ended up dying in Rome
[1:10:53] he died in Rome
[1:10:56] he just wanted to see the Saints
[1:10:58] but is it interesting he longed to see
[1:11:00] them but he actually
[1:11:02] went there to give his life as a
[1:11:04] sacrifice for Christ and the spirit kept
[1:11:05] telling him right like agabus the spirit
[1:11:07] kept telling you got to go to Rome give
[1:11:08] your life as a testimony give her life
[1:11:10] give her life he really just longed to
[1:11:11] see the Saints but he was actually
[1:11:13] achieving his Destiny to die as a martyr
[1:11:17] he was actually led to Rome he wrote to
[1:11:19] them this beautiful letter but he was
[1:11:21] actually LED there to give himself as a
[1:11:23] sacrifice
[1:11:24] as a lamb going to the slaughter
[1:11:28] so no doubt he wanted to see them so bad
[1:11:31] because he was also being drawn there to
[1:11:33] fulfill his destiny
[1:11:35] to give his life as a martyr for Jesus
[1:11:37] Christ
[1:11:38] bye
[1:11:40] by the will of God he did that remember
[1:11:42] Jesus said I must show him which which
[1:11:44] things he must suffer from my name's
[1:11:46] sake
[1:11:48] suffering was part of this
[1:11:50] right you can't know Jesus if you just
[1:11:52] know power and Glory Miracles you can't
[1:11:54] know him unless you also know his
[1:11:55] suffering as well we've got to have both
[1:11:57] churches
[1:11:59] Gotta Have what we've got to have power
[1:12:00] Supernatural experience got our visions
[1:12:03] but we also got to have the suffering of
[1:12:05] Christ as well
[1:12:08] all right
[1:12:10] I'm going to close with 11 and 12.
[1:12:14] for I long to see you why Paul that I
[1:12:18] may impart unto you some spiritual gift
[1:12:22] to the end you may be established you
[1:12:24] know what established means confirmed
[1:12:26] steadfast or strengthened
[1:12:28] the reason I want to see the Saints is
[1:12:31] so they can be stronger when I leave
[1:12:34] in other words I know God's called me to
[1:12:35] preach like Paul said
[1:12:37] and so I just want the Lord to use me so
[1:12:39] the people walk out of here stronger
[1:12:42] they're more steadfast
[1:12:45] rather than getting quickly uh
[1:12:46] distracted by the enemy as soon as they
[1:12:48] leave church or tomorrow rather than
[1:12:49] that they'll be steadfast and they'll
[1:12:51] keep their Focus On Christ
[1:12:53] that's a beautiful request by the
[1:12:55] prophet of God
[1:12:58] I long to see the you that you can be
[1:13:00] stronger in faith when you leave
[1:13:03] verse 12 that is that I may be comforted
[1:13:05] together with you by the mutual faith
[1:13:08] both of you and me
[1:13:13] so I'm closing with this
[1:13:16] Paul long to see them so the Holy Spirit
[1:13:19] could move and give them some spiritual
[1:13:21] gift
[1:13:24] and church that's my honest desire to
[1:13:27] I just want to see Lydia get a gift
[1:13:30] some some special gift
[1:13:32] maybe it was like the right what she
[1:13:34] needed to hear at that right time
[1:13:36] before sister Beatrice leaves us now I
[1:13:39] want her to receive a gift of the Holy
[1:13:42] Spirit praise God some spiritual
[1:13:43] blessing amen
[1:13:45] amen that's right Glory
[1:13:49] when Jose comes in here banging see all
[1:13:51] the saints I want them to receive some
[1:13:53] spiritual gift where they're stronger
[1:13:54] when they leave out here they're not
[1:13:55] discouraged or beaten down or depressed
[1:13:58] but they actually leave out of here
[1:13:59] stronger in their faith
[1:14:01] why so that they're comforted and Paul
[1:14:04] said I'm comforted
[1:14:07] Hallelujah
[1:14:09] that's why sometimes when people come up
[1:14:10] for prayer it's such an encouragement to
[1:14:12] me it doesn't have to happen every time
[1:14:14] but like on Sunday when they come up
[1:14:15] from prayer they say uh bro Jesse pray
[1:14:17] for me that I can have enough freedom to
[1:14:19] dance
[1:14:20] or I see that they have they have
[1:14:22] freedom over the spirit of fear and they
[1:14:25] did receive a spiritual gift last time I
[1:14:27] was there amen hallelujah praise God
[1:14:29] that's what a real preacher desires God
[1:14:32] to move God to bless his people and now
[1:14:35] they're not weaker they're not easily
[1:14:36] defeated by Satan but they're more
[1:14:38] steadfast against the enemy and they
[1:14:40] keep Satan under their feet by the grace
[1:14:42] of God
[1:14:44] that's the end of our feet musicians can
[1:14:45] come here praise God let's stand
[1:14:49] Church you know I long to see you
[1:14:50] tonight so God could impart someone
[1:14:52] spiritual gift to you
[1:14:57] my desire is that everyone walks out of
[1:14:58] here with a closer walk to the Lord
[1:15:01] my desire is not to bore anybody
[1:15:05] my desire is not to do do a comedy show
[1:15:09] my desire so people can receive some
[1:15:11] spiritual blessing and take that with
[1:15:13] them heading in tomorrow
[1:15:16] and that when a trial comes they'll be
[1:15:18] able to stand there with the word of God
[1:15:19] see I've heard the word of God I believe
[1:15:22] the word of God and this is the power of
[1:15:24] God to me praise God oh hallelujah thank
[1:15:27] God thank you Jesus
[1:15:29] let's bow our heads here
[1:15:33] the gates of paradise
[1:15:36] we're open to Martin Luther through the
[1:15:39] book of Romans Church what could be open
[1:15:42] to you through the book alone
[1:15:45] what is the church in need of tonight
[1:15:47] what are the people in need of tonight
[1:15:51] what a beautiful scripture to end with
[1:15:53] here tonight
[1:15:56] that's my prayer
[1:15:58] that some spiritual gift will be
[1:16:00] established and strengthened in your
[1:16:02] life here tonight
[1:16:04] maybe it's sighing and crying for the
[1:16:06] Abominations done in the city done the
[1:16:08] thing
[1:16:12] maybe it's a a desire like sister Emma
[1:16:14] told me last week the desire to keep
[1:16:16] somebody in prayer right to have a
[1:16:18] burden for this person to pray for this
[1:16:19] person and you can pray for this person
[1:16:21] with more fervency
[1:16:33] may God grant you comfort
[1:16:36] through this place
[1:16:38] you got it now
[1:16:40] may God grant me Comfort through the
[1:16:42] blessings the word of God has brought
[1:16:46] aren't you glad Church God's only going
[1:16:48] to record what you've tried to do for
[1:16:50] him wasn't that a beautiful quote from
[1:16:51] other brand

[1:16:56] he's only going to record
[1:16:57] what you try to do
[1:17:01] it
[1:17:03] that challenge

[1:17:10] brother Austin staggered not at the at
[1:17:13] the peace of God
[1:17:14] but was strong in the faith giving God
[1:17:21] Mr Beatrice was strong in the thing
[1:17:25] stagger not at
[1:17:28] the foot instead give God more
[1:17:31] she called things
[1:17:33] as though they were even when they were
[1:17:35] not

[1:17:40] you Jesus

[1:17:46] ever Revelation he said just speak in
[1:17:48] Hope speaking hope and see if God will
[1:17:50] give you a revelation
