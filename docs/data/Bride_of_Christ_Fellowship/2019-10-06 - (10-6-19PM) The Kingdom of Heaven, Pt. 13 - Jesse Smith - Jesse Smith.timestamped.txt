[28:53] that's all Stan I believe he'll come by
[28:56] here don't you
[28:57] I believe that he promised to praise God
[29:00] mm-hmm
[29:02] let's go to Matthew 13 here as we open
[29:05] our Bibles tonight by God's grace
[29:10] Matthew 13 I like to continue on the
[29:13] kingdom of heaven as I mentioned this
[29:14] morning Matthew 13:44 look at the
[29:22] treasure hid in the field tonight by
[29:23] God's grace and I'll be honest you know
[29:26] I got a lot of good revelations out of
[29:28] this this study I seen it in a brand new
[29:30] way and I never preached on it before
[29:32] and as I was studying and reading and
[29:35] praying you know I just felt like a new
[29:38] revelations came out of here so I trust
[29:40] to be a blessing to you Loran
[29:46] when the seals were opened the Bible
[29:47] became a brand-new Bible I can say that
[29:51] amen to that because I knew the Bible
[29:53] for a couple years in denominational
[29:56] systems and then when message came it
[29:59] became a brand-new Bible
[30:00] I know Amen could save him into that too
[30:02] you know van could they all went to
[30:04] church and Jose went to church but now
[30:07] it's a new Bible so it's still opening
[30:10] up the Bible is still unfolding so we're
[30:12] very thankful Matthew 13:44 just one
[30:18] verse but there's a lot in this verse
[30:19] right here because we have to look at
[30:21] the symbols of it so this is the parable
[30:26] the treasure hid in the field
[30:29] let's just all read that verse 44 let's
[30:32] all read that on three one two three
[30:35] again the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[30:38] treasure hid in a field the which when a
[30:41] man hath found he hideth and for joy
[30:45] thereof goeth and selleth all that he
[30:48] hath and buyeth that field amen let's
[30:51] have a word of Prayer everything on your
[30:53] heart just making known unto God
[30:54] Heavenly Father were happy to be in your
[30:56] house Lord and we've sang that song come
[30:58] by here Lord God and that's what we want
[31:00] just come by here we felt your presence
[31:02] so strongly this morning we thank you
[31:04] for that Lord God and thank you for
[31:06] keeping this church pure and clean dear
[31:08] God and driving all the trash Lord to
[31:10] the shores Lord God and just doing a
[31:13] great move by the wind of the Holy
[31:14] Spirit the Lord just come tonight Lord
[31:17] and minister to every heart Lord God may
[31:20] each one Lord receive their heavenly
[31:22] portion Lord God I'm in need of it Lord
[31:25] we're all in need of it and we're happy
[31:26] to be in your house thank you for the
[31:27] songs that we've saying Lord there
[31:29] calmly Lord God they're pleasant they're
[31:31] beautiful Lord God it's a joy to worship
[31:33] and sing to you and I'll bless us with
[31:35] thy word may we receive it and get our
[31:37] spiritual vitamins in Jesus Christ's
[31:39] name
[31:40] the church said amen god bless you
[31:55] I like to just share a few things here
[32:00] from Wednesday night Wednesday night I
[32:02] kind of went longer than I thought I
[32:04] would I didn't get quite to finish what
[32:08] I wanted to share Wednesday night so let
[32:09] me just finish a little bit about the
[32:11] seed into the ground did you enjoy that
[32:13] hope that was a blessing to me it is the
[32:17] revelation of the three works of grace
[32:22] and so I believe that to be fully taught
[32:25] there in the Word of God I'm gonna turn
[32:29] there here in my notes excited I think I
[32:31] recycled the other ones because I've
[32:34] used him up and wrote all over him but
[32:36] let me go to the end of my notes there I
[32:39] want to bring out this one thought yeah
[32:44] so with the seed cast in the ground
[32:47] there was three stages and a Wednesday I
[32:49] actually had not studied out those words
[32:51] blade ear and corn so I went and I
[32:54] shared that with you on Wednesday night
[32:55] and then I went home and studied what
[32:57] brother BAM said and the only thing
[32:58] brother Branham said about it was he
[33:00] typed the blade ear and corn to the last
[33:03] three Church ages which is an
[33:05] interesting type you know Luther Wesley
[33:07] and then Branham we believe it's Branham
[33:10] some people don't but we believe it's
[33:13] Branham so that's an interesting thought
[33:15] there as well for the kingdom of God and
[33:17] you could take it no doubt you could
[33:19] take it that way and God rest restoring
[33:22] and getting the bride ready for the
[33:24] actual entrance into the kingdom of
[33:26] heaven because that's the end of time
[33:29] after the Laodicean Church age
[33:30] tribulation and then the Millennium and
[33:32] that's the ushering in of the kingdom
[33:35] praise God
[33:36] so you could take it that way too but I
[33:40] think it really works out great for the
[33:42] three works of grace now I want to read
[33:46] that quote I didn't get to it on
[33:48] Wednesday night but I think I've
[33:49] reviewed it a couple times in the last
[33:51] few weeks so he says the rams talk
[33:56] telling a story and it is the rising of
[33:58] the Sun his mother had a dream before
[34:00] she passed and she saw a woman on high
[34:02] heels trying to walk the highway there
[34:04] was three steps member to walk the
[34:06] highway and brother Ram said you can't
[34:07] walk this road
[34:09] in those heels and brotherman warned her
[34:13] and she kind of threw him off you know
[34:15] and just disregarded the warning he said
[34:17] she started walk a little bit but then
[34:19] fell off brother branham said he tells a
[34:25] story and he said right on the highways
[34:27] a little pearly white lying right the
[34:30] doors of heaven to the pearly gate and
[34:32] that pearl had been stretched out to the
[34:34] top of the three steps oh there it is
[34:37] pearly gate if that ain't my message
[34:40] exactly today justification
[34:41] sanctification and the baptism of the
[34:44] Holy Ghost
[34:45] so Bo BAM said those three steps leading
[34:48] to the highway were the three works of
[34:50] grace justification sanctification back
[34:53] to the Holy Ghost and he called it my
[34:54] message amen so that was my man's
[34:57] message so this parable of the three
[35:01] stages of wheat has to be connected to
[35:04] the baptism the Holy Ghost because the
[35:06] batson Holy Ghost is the Kingdom of
[35:08] Heaven and so it has to fit there
[35:10] somewhere in the scripture and God did
[35:12] that for us so we're thankful for that
[35:15] now I got four more pair or more
[35:19] parables to do of the Kingdom of Heaven
[35:21] then we'll be finished with this little
[35:23] series Lord willing and once we have the
[35:27] treasure hid in the field we'll look at
[35:28] that tonight the pearl of great price
[35:30] the laborers in the vineyard and the
[35:32] unmerciful servant so have those four
[35:34] left and these all deal with salvation
[35:36] he's all deal with salvation someone
[35:40] look at those here all right so yeah
[35:44] that oh yeah one more thought here to
[35:46] finish this off one more thought now
[35:47] what was interesting in this parable is
[35:50] that once the grain came to full fruit
[35:55] the Bible the Bible calls the fruit of
[35:57] the corn once it came that third stage
[35:59] he said immediately the man went and
[36:03] harvested the wheat now so see this
[36:06] speaks of immediately when the last
[36:09] grain of wheat is mature the rapture is
[36:12] gonna happen
[36:13] amen when that last person gets the bat
[36:16] to the Holy Ghost and they recognize
[36:17] their names on the Lamb's Book of Life
[36:19] Jesus is gonna come back amen wouldn't
[36:22] you be why don't you
[36:23] you privileged to me what the one to
[36:24] witness to and win that person to the
[36:26] Lord and the last person is maybe out of
[36:29] Akron or last persons maybe out of Ohio
[36:31] or something like that would that be
[36:33] glorious to us it doesn't matter though
[36:35] where it happens as long as it happens
[36:37] amen we may not have in our life but
[36:39] it'd be nice if it did happen in our
[36:41] life but we know Christ is coming back
[36:43] for his bride and his wheat children
[36:46] right his wheat seed children he's not
[36:48] coming back for the tares they're
[36:49] getting bound and burnt he's coming back
[36:52] for his wheat praise God now we still
[36:57] pray for the Lord of the harvest to send
[36:59] laborers into his vineyard
[37:02] so still pray for brother Simon pray for
[37:05] the brothers had go over to Japan pray
[37:07] for the brothers to go to China you know
[37:08] pray for them because the jesus said it
[37:12] we need it praise God we got the the
[37:14] harvest is ripe for them in other
[37:16] countries not for us but the harvest is
[37:18] ripe for them I said another big check
[37:22] over to support Simon's ministry so I'm
[37:23] not sent to the last two months like I
[37:26] said I just I had it on my heart I told
[37:28] the Lord I said Lord I'm gonna give you
[37:29] 1/4 of all the tithing I'm gonna give
[37:31] that to missionaries I just had that all
[37:33] my heart so I've been doing that the
[37:36] last two months and so I'm gonna keep
[37:38] doing that and I may send it you know
[37:39] some months to brother Jason to Mars but
[37:41] right now since Simon's got the need
[37:42] right there and I don't think any church
[37:46] supports him
[37:46] I believe there's even if there's no see
[37:50] there in Thailand I believe they deserve
[37:51] a chance to hear the message and if he's
[37:55] got nobody supporting him it must be our
[37:57] duty to support him right you know
[37:59] because we got to do something so I've
[38:02] just felt led to do that now some some
[38:04] months I may send it to do some more
[38:05] postcards for our church but I just want
[38:08] to do that I want to invest in I want to
[38:10] make sure I'm putting at least a quarter
[38:11] of our income into the ministry and now
[38:14] it takes about a quarter to keep this
[38:15] building going which is alright I'm
[38:17] thankful for it you know I appreciate
[38:19] this but I just wanna let you know I
[38:21] still believe in that the harvest is
[38:23] ripe and we must pray for the heart
[38:25] Labor's to go into the harvest praise
[38:27] God because it takes a real or it takes
[38:30] a real sacrifice to go out and do
[38:32] missionary work
[38:33] missionary work like I said it's not
[38:34] evangelism evangelism where there's
[38:36] already churches that that's easy that's
[38:39] not missionary work because you got air
[38:41] conditioning you got you just easy life
[38:44] it's easy living I know cuz I've done it
[38:47] before it's it's not really hard so we
[38:50] got to pray for the laborers now also I
[38:54] want to just close with this there's two
[38:56] more scriptures James 5:7 says be
[38:59] patient therefore brethren unto the
[39:01] coming of the Lord behold the husbandman
[39:04] waiteth for the precious fruit of the
[39:06] earth and have long patience for it
[39:09] until he received the early and latter
[39:12] rain now know did you notice what he
[39:14] said there but they men did you notice
[39:16] he called all those wheat seeds precious
[39:19] amen
[39:20] there's some precious wheat seeds in
[39:22] hongkong they still need to hear the
[39:25] message right there's some precious
[39:27] wheat seeds in Thailand that need to
[39:28] hear the message I believe do we believe
[39:31] the gospel we got to go to every nation
[39:33] till the rapture comes so we got to be
[39:35] patient and let the word go to every
[39:38] nation and then Jesus will make sure
[39:40] every precious soul that once the truth
[39:43] will receive it praise God we just got
[39:46] to be patient therefore to the coming of
[39:48] Lord now and the parable looks like
[39:49] immediately but that's really what
[39:51] happens in jesus's mind once that last
[39:54] one's mature he comes and snatches them
[39:55] away harvest ism' harvest them up see
[40:00] each mature wheat plant is precious in
[40:03] his holy site like that song red and
[40:05] yellow black and white they're all
[40:07] precious in the sight it's so true the
[40:10] Lord of the harvest will not lose or
[40:12] leave behind one single kernel of a
[40:14] single wheat head remember there's
[40:17] between 30 to 50 little wheat seeds on
[40:21] each head praise God and he's not gonna
[40:25] lose one of them because he says and
[40:28] this is the Father's will which has sent
[40:30] me that of all which he hath given me I
[40:32] should lose nothing but should raise it
[40:34] up again at the last day he's not gonna
[40:37] as we end it on Wednesday night member
[40:39] with the miracle of the fish in the
[40:40] loaves
[40:40] he didn't leave one fish behind he
[40:43] gathered every one of them up because it
[40:46] was part of his
[40:46] supernatural work and his work is not in
[40:49] vain amen
[40:50] his work is not wasted the work of a
[40:53] Christian is your Labor's never in vain
[40:55] in the Lord amen
[40:56] and there's nothing lost and and God
[40:59] will never own a man anything praise God
[41:01] he will reward you or all your labor of
[41:04] love God is faithful amen so I want to
[41:07] finish with those few thoughts there
[41:08] hope that was a blessing now let's go to
[41:10] the next then the one we read for our
[41:13] text here well let me uh let's go to
[41:19] Matthew 25 let me lay this thought in
[41:20] here real quick by God's grace I know we
[41:33] all like seeing quotes I love seeing
[41:34] them too so later you can switch over
[41:43] later you can switch over when you want
[41:44] here now I don't smile I know this this
[41:46] app I don't know how to raise the iTap
[41:48] this thing but it don't give me an
[41:49] option well maybe it's that one full
[41:55] screen mode maybe I'll try to let's try
[41:59] that well now then I lost my spot okay
[42:08] it didn't do it it's no it's no
[42:10] different okay I I just don't know the
[42:11] app really good Matthew 25 I want to
[42:14] share this again I've been preaching on
[42:17] it I mentioned it a few times but I just
[42:18] think tonight I'll just nail it down
[42:21] here Matthew 25 so this is the parable
[42:24] of the the sheep and goats being divided
[42:28] Matthew 25
[42:32] am I in the right chapter oh no I'm in
[42:36] 2026
[42:37] okay now hear him all right now verse 31
[42:40] when the Son of man shall come in his
[42:42] glory and all the holy angels with him
[42:43] then shall he sit on the throne of his
[42:45] glory and before him shall be gathered
[42:48] all nations and he shall separate them
[42:50] one from another as a shepherd divideth
[42:53] his sheep from the goats my brother have
[42:55] said see it's as a shepherd so brother
[42:58] man says they're these truly weren't the
[43:00] real
[43:00] sheep of God because the sheep of God
[43:02] already heard his voice they were the
[43:04] bride the ones that lived on the earth
[43:06] and had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:08] but he has to give some symbol to the
[43:10] people being saved and the people being
[43:12] lost so he used his sheep and goats it's
[43:14] as a shepherd verse 33 and he set the
[43:18] sheep on the left right hand but the
[43:20] goats on the left and here it is right
[43:21] here then shall the King say unto them
[43:23] on the right hand come you blessed of my
[43:25] father inherit the kingdom prepared for
[43:28] you from the foundation of the world so
[43:32] with that in mind let's read this many
[43:35] you might might remember this is from
[43:36] the same message that we referenced this
[43:38] morning questions answer 64 I'll tell
[43:42] you I'm so glad I listened those when I
[43:43] first came in the message both samuel
[43:45] was preaching on him I just listened to
[43:47] him over and over again they answer so
[43:49] many questions so if you really want to
[43:51] listen to a good set of sermons listen
[43:53] those four if you haven't listened those
[43:55] really amen there'll be a real blessing
[43:56] to you brother Branham who will populate
[43:59] the earth outside the heavenly City now
[44:02] notice in our text Jesus just says come
[44:05] he blessed you were for know know my
[44:06] father inherit the kingdom
[44:09] well the bride's already sitting with
[44:11] Jesus up on the throne so who are these
[44:13] that are gonna in have a part of the
[44:15] kingdom the foolish virgin because he
[44:20] loves a foolish version they're a part
[44:22] of the they're part of the cloth they're
[44:25] they're not the that they're not the
[44:26] chosen piece you know the pattern
[44:28] they're the remnant but he still loves
[44:30] the Redmund the remnant still kept him
[44:33] at it they still live version now verse
[44:40] 4 chapter 4 I'm sorry paragraph 48 who
[44:42] will populate the earth outside the city
[44:44] outside it will be the redeemed that
[44:46] will populate the earth outside the city
[44:48] but they will not be the elected and
[44:51] called bride the bride will live inside
[44:55] the kingdom with the King on the outside
[44:59] will be the kings of the earth that
[45:01] Labour and bring their toils not toil
[45:04] but bring their fruits into the city the
[45:07] and the doors will not be closed by
[45:10] night now on this light on top of the
[45:13] mountain will not light
[45:14] the whole world and only light in the
[45:15] city but it can be seen the distance of
[45:17] thousands of miles maybe but it won't
[45:19] lighten the earth because the Bible said
[45:21] the new world from that from one Sabbath
[45:22] to the other and from one of the new
[45:24] moon to the other you see where the
[45:26] people come up before the Lord and a
[45:28] Zion up to the city to worship
[45:30] can you imagine every Sabbath
[45:34] everybody's gonna gather around but
[45:36] we're not we don't have to travel to
[45:37] church because we're already at church
[45:41] amen
[45:42] you'll be a pillar in the temple of God
[45:44] amen see they gotta travel to church but
[45:47] we already at church oh thank you Lord
[45:51] is my heart that was David's desire and
[45:53] that's our desire to you amen Oh glory
[45:58] and now they will be outside the city
[46:00] not the bride but the people that come
[46:02] up in the second resurrection right why
[46:04] throne judgment and that will be the
[46:06] tillers of the soil just like animals
[46:08] and so forth the cares of the garden but
[46:10] the king and queen will remain in this
[46:12] city and then he stops right there talks
[46:14] about each person's angel how the angel
[46:17] Lord and camp with them that fear the
[46:18] Lord now you might think well there's
[46:21] not enough room in that City but yes
[46:23] there is remember the size 144 thousand
[46:26] cubits it's the size from Maine all the
[46:29] way down to Florida that's just that's
[46:32] just the ED that's one side of it that's
[46:35] how big it is and it's going up you know
[46:38] its upward mountain you know it's a
[46:40] mountain that comes up I'm sorry yeah
[46:41] the Bible said the earth raised up like
[46:43] a mountain and then the the capstone
[46:45] comes down from heaven and so the bride
[46:48] all the bride down through the ages
[46:50] lives in that city now what's
[46:52] interesting church is that court I read
[46:54] where the RAM said that the Millennium
[46:56] was more important than we thought
[46:57] before so in the Millennium the bride
[47:01] the Bible said we plant and build houses
[47:04] and all these things the jesus said will
[47:07] rule nations with a rod of iron
[47:10] so it's interesting it seems like in the
[47:12] Millennium we get to go out and maybe
[47:15] have our own little kingdoms and nations
[47:17] and things like that and the Bible said
[47:21] rule over ten cities right rule over
[47:24] five cities but then it seems like it
[47:26] switches
[47:28] and then in the and then in the future
[47:30] home the bride just stays with her groom
[47:33] all the time amen so it's kinda like we
[47:37] get a little recreation during the
[47:38] honeymoon there's time for recreation
[47:41] and go build and everything like that
[47:42] but then Jesus says I want my bride with
[47:45] me for all eternity that's what it seems
[47:48] like so it's so important for Christ to
[47:50] have his 1,000 year millenium one day is
[47:53] 1000 year millennium with his bride he
[47:56] lets them rule right you know they rule
[47:58] and reign with Christ for a thousand
[48:00] years the Bible said but here in the
[48:04] future home the bride stays in the city
[48:06] and then the foolish virgin have a
[48:08] portion of the kingdom isn't that
[48:09] gracious of God to give them up easy
[48:12] give us and give them of course we
[48:14] believe will be the bride because of the
[48:16] word but even the foolish version get a
[48:19] portion a part of the kingdom of heaven
[48:22] he says blessed are you coming to Haran
[48:25] a part of the kingdom of heaven amen but
[48:29] then every Sabbath they got to come in
[48:30] and they got to come into the temple
[48:32] then they'd have to leave the temple I'm
[48:34] so glad it off to leave it praise God
[48:36] I'm so glad we get to stay with Jesus
[48:38] amen if we're faithful we'll get this
[48:40] day with Jesus praise God now hope that
[48:44] was a blessing there by God's grace yeah
[48:48] so the treasure hid in a field and I did
[48:51] look for quotes on this one I never
[48:52] found anything specific on a quote about
[48:55] treasure in the field some so what I
[48:57] have to do is rightly divide the word of
[48:59] God so the treasure hid in the field I
[49:02] think you'll like some of these
[49:04] scriptures here now here's the if I
[49:06] remember I tried to sum up every mystery
[49:09] or every parable with a one sentence
[49:11] revelation so here's what the sentence I
[49:14] came up with from my heart a true
[49:16] believer joyfully trades all his
[49:19] possessions at the surprising
[49:21] opportunity to gain Christ and this is
[49:25] the treasure in the field because if you
[49:28] read the parable if we read through it
[49:29] again we'll see it's a surprising thing
[49:31] he's he's not expecting to find this
[49:34] treasure amen neither was I expecting to
[49:38] find the message amen
[49:40] and now each parable is a little
[49:42] different because now this this might be
[49:44] some of us we might have been totally
[49:45] surprised now in this one they're
[49:47] actually searching for that they're
[49:49] actually searching for the pearl they're
[49:51] actually searching for pearls here so
[49:54] and I'll explain that you know Jesus
[49:56] gives multiple parables to kind of fit
[49:59] our different experiences that we have
[50:01] as everybody has it a little different
[50:02] experience right like Paul Wendon I've
[50:05] talked about this before how she kind of
[50:07] fought the message for a little while
[50:08] and you know and cam did too and and if
[50:10] anybody fought the message it was st.
[50:11] Paul he heard about Jesus Christ and he
[50:14] bought it bought it bought it other
[50:16] people like Peter
[50:17] they said he said come follow me he's
[50:19] like okay but see it's the same grace
[50:22] for all of us we all love Jesus Christ
[50:24] and some have different experiences but
[50:28] Jesus gives us these different parables
[50:30] to match our experiences so Matthew 13
[50:36] I'm gonna read that again there 44 again
[50:40] that the kingdom of heaven
[50:41] so the batsu the Holy Ghost is like unto
[50:43] treasure hid in a field the which when a
[50:48] man has found he found it he hide a--the
[50:53] and for joy therefore goeth and selleth
[50:56] all that he hath that might by the field
[51:02] so see a true believer joyfully trades
[51:06] all of his possessions at the surprising
[51:09] opportunity to gain Christ he just found
[51:11] this treasure hid in a field you
[51:13] wouldn't think your treasure would be in
[51:14] the field right so let's look at some of
[51:16] the symbols here let me set my timer
[51:19] here
[51:27] the first symbolist treasure now this
[51:31] may strike you I don't know
[51:33] but listen the first simple treasure
[51:35] stands for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:38] I believe that because Paul teaches that
[51:42] gospel light that is shine in our hearts
[51:45] is treasure in earthen vessels that's in
[51:49] that's in second Corinthians four six
[51:53] and seven so that's what I believe I
[51:58] believe it's the baptism Holy Ghost for
[52:00] Christ dwells in our hearts by faith the
[52:04] Bible says in that scripture Jesus
[52:06] spirit is treasure it abides in the
[52:09] heart or the inner man according to
[52:12] Ephesians 3:16 it is the treasure in the
[52:15] inner man this Holy Ghost treasure fell
[52:19] into the hearts of believers on the day
[52:21] of Pentecost for Peter said the promise
[52:23] of the Holy Ghost is what God shed forth
[52:26] see he shed it forth right and Paul we
[52:29] see the same experience later saying the
[52:31] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[52:34] by the Holy Ghost which is given to us
[52:37] in Romans 5:5 amen yes so you just see
[52:42] what it does these parables tie all the
[52:43] scriptures together and you can see it
[52:46] if you look at all the scriptures to
[52:48] gain Christ is to be filled with his
[52:51] spirit and Jesus said the kingdom of God
[52:55] is within you and Paul says that the
[52:57] kingdom is the hope of glory
[52:59] it's Christ in you praise God so Jesus
[53:01] says the kingdoms in you Paul says
[53:04] Christ is in you amen
[53:05] oh it's so clear and after his
[53:08] resurrection Jesus breathed on his
[53:09] disciples urging them to receive the
[53:11] Holy Ghost treasure saying receive you
[53:13] the Holy Ghost Christians will always
[53:15] love and consider God's Spirit a
[53:17] treasure above the things of the world
[53:19] whereas the tears will love worldly
[53:21] pleasures and riches more than God amen
[53:25] so hope you can see that treasure stands
[53:28] for the baptism Holy Ghost because it's
[53:30] in earthen vessels praise God
[53:33] now where's the treasure found this
[53:34] might surprise you too it's hidden in
[53:38] the field but the field is the
[53:41] the Old Testament because Jesus is
[53:44] teaching from the scriptures says how
[53:49] God hid hides himself from the wise and
[53:52] prudent the prideful right and reveals
[53:54] themselves to babes such as would learn
[53:57] let me show you how he did it
[53:59] eight hundred years before the Messiah
[54:01] Joel prophesied of the baptism of Holy
[54:04] Ghost treasure in Joel chapter 2 28 to
[54:08] 32 it was laying there it was hidden
[54:11] there right in the scrolls the whole
[54:12] time just in some field right anybody
[54:15] could have read that just out in any
[54:17] field right eight hundred years
[54:20] Jeremiah 600 years before Christ he
[54:23] prophesied and said this is the Covenant
[54:26] I'll make with Israel after those days
[54:27] I'll put my law in their inward parts
[54:30] and write it in their hearts and will be
[54:31] their God and they shall be my people
[54:33] praise God jeremiah 31:33 it's laying
[54:37] there it's hidden there 800 years 600
[54:40] years the next is Ezekiel praise God 500
[54:48] 80 years before the Messiah
[54:49] Ezekiel found the baptism or foretold
[54:52] the batson Holy Ghost and he said a new
[54:54] heart would I give you a new spirit when
[54:56] I put within you and I will take away
[54:58] the stony heart of your flesh and will
[55:00] give you a heart of flesh and I'll put
[55:02] my spirit within you and cause you to
[55:03] walk in my statutes and you shall keep
[55:05] my judgments and do them so see the
[55:08] treasure is in the field and that means
[55:11] the bats of the Holy Ghost is foretold
[55:13] in Scripture praise God hallelujah
[55:16] that's right
[55:18] thank the Lord so he just found it
[55:21] laying there in the scripture praise God
[55:24] now the parable says the man found the
[55:27] treasure and this is the human
[55:29] perspective not God's okay because in
[55:33] our perspective it seems like when we
[55:35] come to Christ we just found him but did
[55:39] God did God just find us
[55:41] did God just haphazardly I hope somebody
[55:43] hope when he gives her heart to the Lord
[55:45] some their whole van gets saved someday
[55:47] no God didn't just stumble upon us and
[55:51] find us God had it all he all he
[55:53] foreknew at all amen
[55:55] so see this parable is from man's
[55:57] perspective it's just like it's just
[56:00] like works and faith right
[56:01] but the RAM said faith is what God sees
[56:04] works is what man sees amen so it's the
[56:07] same idea it's different perspectives
[56:09] people have different perspectives right
[56:11] we have God's perspective and we have
[56:13] man's perspective same thing here this
[56:15] is man's perspective praise God the
[56:21] Bible says no one can come to the Father
[56:23] Jesus except the father draws him and
[56:26] Jesus is the one seeking the lost not
[56:29] vice-versa
[56:32] so see Jesus is out there actively
[56:35] seeking us out right but we don't know
[56:37] it he lets us many times he lets us
[56:39] experience it when people get saved it's
[56:41] a surprise to them they just stumbled
[56:42] upon it people say I found Jesus but
[56:45] really Jesus found you but see for those
[56:48] people who experience it like that
[56:50] that's that's that's the parable they
[56:52] can relate to that's well that's how it
[56:53] was for me I just stumbled upon it amen
[56:58] see God's gracious heart though let's
[57:01] man experience the joy of finding
[57:04] unexpected treasure from his own human
[57:06] perspective this is what Philips heart
[57:09] burned with excitement when he
[57:11] experienced the joy of finding Christ he
[57:13] told Nathanael we found him of whom
[57:15] Moses in the law and the prophets did
[57:17] right Gee's of Nazareth the son of
[57:19] Joseph Amen see that was Philips
[57:23] experience Philip is like the one who
[57:25] found this treasure praise God this is
[57:28] what they all wrote about and I just
[57:30] found it but it was laying there the
[57:31] whole time
[57:32] amen see God knew he's gonna come upon
[57:35] it but from God's perspective
[57:37] Jesus was finding Philip and Nathanael
[57:40] but for Philip it's like look who we
[57:42] found Oh amen hallelujah you see that he
[57:47] used those actual words look what we
[57:49] found and this was treasure that they
[57:51] found in the field amen
[57:53] but Jesus knew the whole time they'd
[57:55] believe see while men are surprised at
[57:58] finding Christ God's not but I'll say
[58:01] like this there is rejoicing both on
[58:03] earth and in heaven the angels of God
[58:06] rejoice over ones
[58:08] sinner who repents praise God that's
[58:11] right
[58:11] heaven rejoices when you repent
[58:14] hallelujah
[58:15] and of course earth does to the
[58:18] believers rejoice thank you lord
[58:21] see so this parable emphasizes how God
[58:24] uses the element of surprise in
[58:27] believers lives awakening them from
[58:29] their complete ignorance just as finding
[58:33] unexpected treasure in a simple common
[58:35] feel with the light of man how many ever
[58:37] found 50 bucks laying around I don't
[58:40] think I've ever found 50 Oh Stephen has
[58:42] praised alone Steve has how many 200 my
[58:45] god is good sir god is good I think I
[58:48] found 20 before I think I've found 20
[58:51] pretty good fine oh I found $5 at the
[58:54] cash register we went through a car wash
[58:58] I was like oh there's $5 but the workers
[59:01] like oh I'll take that and he took it
[59:02] right from me I'm like well okay buddy
[59:05] if you wanted that bad you're gonna have
[59:06] it because somebody you know it got
[59:08] dispensed out and the person didn't take
[59:10] it they must have not seen it I'm like
[59:11] okay you can have it see surprised to
[59:14] find it
[59:17] see unexpected treasure it delights man
[59:21] see God's surprising instant
[59:24] introduction of himself into a man's
[59:27] life brings joy unspeakable and here's
[59:29] another example the Samaritan woman at
[59:31] Jacob's Well went to find water but
[59:34] instead she found living water amen
[59:37] surprise surprise surprise this ain't
[59:40] gonna be the regular day not for her it
[59:42] was just gonna be a regular day I'm
[59:44] gonna have to go out there with the
[59:45] prostitutes I can't go out with the pure
[59:46] women oh but she found something
[59:48] different that day praise God hey man
[59:51] she found the living water surprised her
[59:53] so much so she ran into the field I'm
[59:57] sorry she ran out and she made sure she
[59:59] bought it she made sure that she could
[1:00:01] keep this treasure amen hallelujah the
[1:00:04] Bible said many of the Samaritans of the
[1:00:07] city believed on Christ for the saying
[1:00:09] of the woman which testified he told me
[1:00:11] all that I ever did so she's one this is
[1:00:15] just like the parable that Samaritan
[1:00:17] woman finds a treasure and she makes
[1:00:19] sure she goes and sells outright so she
[1:00:22] have that treasure here's another one so
[1:00:24] we went Philip and Nathaniel as one
[1:00:27] example the second example the Samaritan
[1:00:29] woman the third one is Philip the eunuch
[1:00:32] Philip and the eunuch in Acts chapter 8
[1:00:35] he's just reading Isaiah 53 and all of a
[1:00:38] sudden he gets some spontaneous joy when
[1:00:41] Philip starts preaching to him and he's
[1:00:43] so surprised what does he do he said
[1:00:45] stop the chariots can I be baptized
[1:00:47] right now
[1:00:48] he found that I found the treasure can I
[1:00:51] go make sure I sell out can I sell out
[1:00:53] to the world and make sure I'm baptized
[1:00:55] and Philip said of course if you believe
[1:00:57] that's what we need around here we need
[1:00:59] everybody to believe with all of our
[1:01:00] hearts amen that's what I need we got to
[1:01:02] believe with all of our hearts and that
[1:01:05] shows the joy of finding treasure
[1:01:08] unexpectedly see he didn't expect that
[1:01:12] God had to translate Philip right God
[1:01:14] had to translate him out of a revival in
[1:01:16] Samaria and bring him out here out in
[1:01:20] the wilderness to surprise this man and
[1:01:22] so the man the unit could see the
[1:01:24] treasure of God and then sell out and
[1:01:26] believe it praise God hallelujah
[1:01:30] now this parable says the man hid the
[1:01:32] treasure before making the purchase of
[1:01:34] the field this hiding God's treasure is
[1:01:38] like meditating and memorizing Scripture
[1:01:41] so you hide that word in your heart
[1:01:44] because Psalms 119 11 says thy word have
[1:01:46] I hid in my heart that I might not sin
[1:01:50] against thee I memory Church when I
[1:01:52] first heard this message guess what I
[1:01:54] did I went out and bought a voice
[1:01:56] recorder remember the ones that those
[1:01:58] handheld voice recorders this is before
[1:02:00] iPhones so I had a I had a flip phone I
[1:02:05] could call on then I had a little voice
[1:02:09] recorder with those plastic little
[1:02:10] cassette tapes and it was so dear to me
[1:02:13] brother bang the first thing I did I
[1:02:15] started reading acts 2:38 in there and I
[1:02:17] just read it and I listened to it I
[1:02:19] Drive I just press the play button and
[1:02:22] just listen to it
[1:02:23] repent and be baptized everyone you the
[1:02:25] name Lord and then I started memorizing
[1:02:26] scripture that way see because that's
[1:02:30] what it is in the scripture when you go
[1:02:33] and hide the treasure before
[1:02:36] making the purchase you're hiding God's
[1:02:38] Word in your heart that's right
[1:02:41] see meditating on Scripture ensures that
[1:02:44] the word is stored in your heart because
[1:02:46] David said let the words of my mouth and
[1:02:49] the meditation of my heart be acceptable
[1:02:51] in thy sight O Lord my strength and my
[1:02:54] Redeemer amen
[1:02:55] Psalms 1914 Psalms 1 verse 2 declares
[1:03:00] the Blessed man who delights in God's
[1:03:02] Word and his law doth he meditate day
[1:03:05] and night that's how you're gonna grow
[1:03:08] is memorize any more scripture may God's
[1:03:11] Word be hidden in our hearts amen right
[1:03:14] like Jeremiah said here's a good one
[1:03:17] from Jeremiah maybe haven't read this in
[1:03:18] a while this bless me Jeremiah 15:16 thy
[1:03:21] words were found and I did eat them and
[1:03:24] thy word was unto me as the joy and
[1:03:27] rejoicing of mine heart a man he said he
[1:03:31] found God's Word and they were a joy and
[1:03:34] rejoicing that's a demanded he found the
[1:03:36] treasure and it was for the joy he went
[1:03:39] and sold everything he had praise God so
[1:03:42] we can see all the beautiful types here
[1:03:45] that go along together hope you can see
[1:03:47] that now the next symbol is buying and
[1:03:51] selling buying and selling have both a
[1:03:54] natural and spiritual meaning in this
[1:03:56] parable and the natural believers gladly
[1:03:58] sell out any financial gains that might
[1:04:00] hinder their relationship with Christ in
[1:04:01] order to receive him and there's many
[1:04:06] examples what in Moses do instead of the
[1:04:08] financial blessings of Egypt the Bible
[1:04:11] said he chose to suffer affliction with
[1:04:13] the people of God in order to gain
[1:04:15] heavenly riches hallelujah he sold it
[1:04:18] out he sold out Egypt he saw the
[1:04:21] financial worldly pleasures that would
[1:04:23] accompany being the son of Pharaoh that
[1:04:26] was Hebrews 11 24 through 26 Elisha sold
[1:04:30] out his farming aspirations order follow
[1:04:32] Elisha he slayed his yoke of oxen and
[1:04:35] fed the people so he could minister to
[1:04:38] Elisha ah he really sold out lock stock
[1:04:40] and barrel huh
[1:04:41] he'll assorted out so much that death
[1:04:45] was there right he fully died out
[1:04:47] he died out to everything so they could
[1:04:49] follow the spear
[1:04:50] Alijah a lot like us praise God the
[1:04:55] brothers Peter and Andrew and James and
[1:04:58] John had two sets of brothers their left
[1:05:02] their fishing nets in order to follow
[1:05:03] Christ as fishers of men
[1:05:05] and then Jesus promised Peter and all
[1:05:08] the believers that the rewards for sake
[1:05:10] in the world would be a hundredfold now
[1:05:12] in this time and eternal life I'm sorry
[1:05:15] and eternal life in the world to come
[1:05:17] praise God what a what great rewards he
[1:05:20] promises to all those who forsake
[1:05:22] everything for him hallelujah
[1:05:25] now the spiritual selling out means
[1:05:30] forsaking Satan's lies and buying
[1:05:34] represents repenting from those lies and
[1:05:36] believing God's Word that's scriptural
[1:05:38] Jesus says selling is losing your life
[1:05:41] that you might find your spiritual life
[1:05:43] which includes loving Christ more than
[1:05:45] your family praise God that's Matthew
[1:05:47] 10:37 239 he said you sell your life
[1:05:51] that you might find it praise God and I
[1:05:53] love this from proverbs 23:23 says buy
[1:05:56] the truth and sell it not also wisdom
[1:06:00] and instruction and understanding praise
[1:06:02] God you we see we bought this truth
[1:06:06] praise God we sold out all Satan's lies
[1:06:09] and we purchased this with our faith
[1:06:11] amen we bought this truth it's ours
[1:06:14] ain't man it's our possession we just
[1:06:16] got to hang on to it praise God buy the
[1:06:19] truth and sell it not when you buy the
[1:06:21] field of biblical truth you experience
[1:06:23] the treasure of the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:25] Ghost
[1:06:25] that's right not only can you buy the
[1:06:28] truth but Jesus tells the Llano see in
[1:06:30] church age which is our age to buy
[1:06:32] spiritual gold and white raiment from
[1:06:34] him Gold is time-tested unwavering faith
[1:06:38] and white raiment represents a righteous
[1:06:40] spiritual life of integrity in obedience
[1:06:43] to the Word of God
[1:06:45] Oh church don't you want to buy that
[1:06:48] praise God aren't you glad if you have
[1:06:50] bought it praise the Lord
[1:06:51] gold time-tested unwavering faith white
[1:06:55] raiment the righteous the righteousness
[1:06:58] of spiritual integrity I was praying
[1:07:00] that the other morning in my claws I'm
[1:07:01] saying Lord you know my heart I don't
[1:07:03] want to sin against
[1:07:04] you give me a spirit of integrity godly
[1:07:07] and integrity you know I never want to
[1:07:09] sin against you help me Lord and if you
[1:07:11] helped Abimelech to do it how much more
[1:07:13] will he help us a heathen King right he
[1:07:16] only knows about the Living God but see
[1:07:18] we have the revelation of the Living God
[1:07:20] and that God supposed to be living in
[1:07:22] our souls amen how much more should we
[1:07:24] live lives of integrity than a man in
[1:07:26] the Old Testament that's right
[1:07:31] so every symbol works out scripturally
[1:07:35] by the grace of God alright do you like
[1:07:38] that one a true believer joyfully trades
[1:07:42] all of his possessions at the surprising
[1:07:44] opportunity to gain Christ let me go a
[1:07:47] few murmurs let me do one more here I
[1:07:48] got to be out about 15 minutes here good
[1:07:50] all right let's do the one pearl of
[1:07:52] great price then we'll be done here now
[1:07:55] here is the other side for those that
[1:07:58] were searching so the other one is
[1:08:00] surprising right you surprisingly find
[1:08:03] this parables about you're actually
[1:08:05] searching for it now this this kind of
[1:08:08] feels like me too like this feels like
[1:08:10] me like when I stumbled upon the message
[1:08:14] but this feels like me when I was in
[1:08:16] denominations I had some pretty good
[1:08:18] pearls but there's one pearl that was
[1:08:20] better than oh praise God there's one
[1:08:23] that I I want that one more than
[1:08:25] anything else so that's the revelation
[1:08:29] if my one sentence sentence summary
[1:08:31] summary hears a true believer abandons
[1:08:33] his search for many spiritual truths in
[1:08:37] order to gain the one the most valuable
[1:08:40] truth Christ so that's in Matthew 13 45
[1:08:45] and 46 so let's go there
[1:08:54] and I do have a new member I had a few
[1:08:56] quotes on this from brother branham yeah
[1:09:01] so read those in just a minute here but
[1:09:03] let's read the scripture again the
[1:09:05] kingdom of heaven is like unto a
[1:09:07] merchant man seeking goodly pearls I
[1:09:09] notice that he's already seeking them
[1:09:11] that was silent that was probably some
[1:09:14] of you right right you were seeking
[1:09:15] after truth and then you found the
[1:09:17] message some of you weren't some of you
[1:09:20] more like Oh someone upon it what a
[1:09:21] surprise totally changed my life just
[1:09:23] shocked me but this man wasn't he was
[1:09:27] seeking for it praise God who when he
[1:09:31] had found one pearl of great price went
[1:09:33] and sold all that he had and bought it
[1:09:35] so no matter which experience looks like
[1:09:37] yours
[1:09:38] they both have something in common that
[1:09:40] everybody's got to sell out your
[1:09:42] previous life in order to gain Christ
[1:09:44] hey man hallelujah there's a quote we're
[1:09:48] programmed says listen I know my
[1:09:49] redeemer lives I want to have an
[1:09:52] experience now in this Easter morning I
[1:09:53] can say anytime through life yes I was
[1:09:55] seeing a little old block Tabernacle one
[1:09:57] beautiful Easter morning God raise up
[1:09:59] the curtain I looked at pass I seen my
[1:10:01] church didn't mean very much I seen
[1:10:02] there was nothing on earth that very
[1:10:04] much meant to me any more there I sold
[1:10:07] out everything I had I bought the pearl
[1:10:09] of great price I accepted Jesus Christ
[1:10:11] as my savior I now raised my hand Lord
[1:10:14] God be merciful to me God I want to look
[1:10:16] past the curtain of time would there be
[1:10:17] another before just closing now amen
[1:10:20] here's another he says he's talking
[1:10:22] about receiving the Holy Ghost I know
[1:10:24] many don't think I lost my mind even my
[1:10:26] good old righteous mother that died a
[1:10:27] few years ago when I first received the
[1:10:29] Holy Ghost there was no one in our
[1:10:30] country knowing anything about it I was
[1:10:32] just a little local young Baptist
[1:10:35] preacher about 20 years old but when I
[1:10:37] received the Holy Ghost my mother said
[1:10:38] that boy has lost his mind see but no
[1:10:42] matter what mother thought I had found
[1:10:45] the pearl of great price
[1:10:46] amen it might have seen like that to her
[1:10:49] but to me it was real see it was it was
[1:10:53] the genuine something that I had found
[1:10:55] in God oh thank you Lord amen see people
[1:11:01] think you're crazy but you found the
[1:11:02] pearl of great price
[1:11:04] I found it thank you Jesus a
[1:11:08] oh I know I found it hallelujah I said I
[1:11:13] said like this I've been in the
[1:11:14] denominations I've been out there in the
[1:11:16] mega churches they don't have it they
[1:11:19] don't have it we got it by God's grace
[1:11:22] we got the life of Christ it's exactly
[1:11:25] right and I'm not saying anything
[1:11:26] negative I'm just saying we got it it's
[1:11:28] different it's a different life I'll
[1:11:31] leave that one up there hear this one
[1:11:32] few more minutes here let us call it let
[1:11:34] me go on some of the symbols here okay
[1:11:41] so this one is not about suddenness in
[1:11:43] this parable Jesus illustrates how God
[1:11:49] satisfies those who are actively seeking
[1:11:52] many pearls by letting them discover the
[1:11:55] ultimate puerperal and there's Bible
[1:11:58] examples of this so just wait you hold
[1:12:00] your horses here I'm gonna get it the
[1:12:02] first symbol show a merchant man seeking
[1:12:03] many pearls meaning someone who's
[1:12:05] actively searching for religious or
[1:12:07] spiritual truths the man is not a
[1:12:10] careless or wicked man see but one who
[1:12:13] has been awakened and is sincerely
[1:12:15] looking for truth pearls always
[1:12:18] represent valuable beautiful and rare
[1:12:20] treasures in Scripture always as Matthew
[1:12:24] 7:6 says 1st Timothy 2:9 revelation
[1:12:27] 17:14 revelation 18 12 in revelation 21
[1:12:30] 21 in Matthew 7:6 Jesus said pearls are
[1:12:35] life-changing truce because he said give
[1:12:38] not that which is holy unto the dogs
[1:12:40] neither cast your pearls before swine
[1:12:42] lest they trample them under your feet
[1:12:44] and turn again and rend you see there
[1:12:48] came a time church when the disciples
[1:12:50] would share things with the Pharisees
[1:12:52] but after a while he got tired of it and
[1:12:54] said don't you share it let the blind
[1:12:55] lead the blind and don't cast your
[1:12:57] pearls your life-giving truce underdogs
[1:13:01] so it's ok like I think we've talked
[1:13:03] about this really a man I think we text
[1:13:05] about this so a year ago or something
[1:13:06] like that there it's okay for a while to
[1:13:09] share them the truce with people but
[1:13:10] when they start trampling under it and
[1:13:12] blasphemy it's time to let it go
[1:13:15] remember I think man was here I said
[1:13:17] that I was working member I was work
[1:13:19] with Benjamin for three years but on the
[1:13:21] fourth I stopped
[1:13:22] because that parabola the other that's
[1:13:24] the tree parable right give it three
[1:13:25] years I'm sorry two years right there
[1:13:29] was a parable of the the tree that
[1:13:31] wouldn't bring forth fruit he did it two
[1:13:33] years he said do it one more if it
[1:13:35] doesn't bring forth fruit in the third
[1:13:37] year and the fourth year cut it down and
[1:13:40] so that spoke to me on that night it was
[1:13:42] the Holy Spirit show me that I cut off
[1:13:44] brother Benjamin in the fourth year now
[1:13:46] but he's on his way back it looks like
[1:13:48] it's gonna work by Lord willing so you
[1:13:51] give an opportunity after - you give it
[1:13:53] chances right but you got to see some
[1:13:57] fruit at some point but then the Bible
[1:14:00] said cast not your pearls before the
[1:14:02] swine so pearls represent the
[1:14:03] life-changing truths of the Bible the
[1:14:05] revelations of the Bible okay so don't
[1:14:08] cast your pearls
[1:14:09] now what pearls that the disciples had
[1:14:11] they had the pearls that he was the
[1:14:12] Messiah they had pearls that they have
[1:14:15] authority to cast out demons right and
[1:14:18] all the revelations of Jesus that they
[1:14:21] had all the revelations they had he said
[1:14:24] don't give him any more and so see you
[1:14:27] got to see God when is that when is that
[1:14:29] when is that time come for you right
[1:14:30] when is that time come for you and your
[1:14:32] friendships and your family members when
[1:14:33] it's a time to cut it off so you got to
[1:14:36] lead you when it's that time now see now
[1:14:42] you can find valuable or moral teachings
[1:14:45] or pearls in any religion but especially
[1:14:48] Judaism right
[1:14:49] speaking of Moses law Paul says the law
[1:14:52] is holy the commandments holy and just
[1:14:54] and good you're gonna find some great
[1:14:57] pearls in the Old Testament right
[1:14:58] there's tremendous wisdom in the moral
[1:15:01] law of Moses yet there's one religion
[1:15:04] that's far above all others that's
[1:15:07] Christianity right because its founders
[1:15:11] if its founder offers complete
[1:15:13] forgiveness by grace power for living
[1:15:16] golly on this earth and unending eternal
[1:15:19] life amen
[1:15:20] see the pearl of great price typifies
[1:15:23] receiving Jesus Christ's spirit or the
[1:15:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost because it was
[1:15:28] the baptism was the mystery hid from
[1:15:30] generations and ages in memory
[1:15:32] Colossians 1 God's love will reward
[1:15:35] diligence he
[1:15:36] researchers because god only rewards
[1:15:38] those who search after him because he
[1:15:41] lets them discover the ultimate pearl
[1:15:43] the baptism Holy Ghost when a man finds
[1:15:46] this great pearl by hearing preaching
[1:15:47] about Jesus Christ he'll sell everything
[1:15:49] in order to possess it as seen in to
[1:15:51] clear New Testament passages so let's
[1:15:54] look at one well just for times sake
[1:15:56] we'll just I'll just read them over acts
[1:16:00] 19 is the first example these twelve
[1:16:03] Ephesian believers sold out their goodly
[1:16:05] pearls or their previous teachings the
[1:16:08] holy teachings they learn from John the
[1:16:10] Baptist a man that loved how the word
[1:16:13] interprets itself don't you acts 19 as
[1:16:17] believers they already believed John the
[1:16:18] Baptist message they got great pearls
[1:16:20] but they have to sell that out in order
[1:16:22] to gain Paul's message of the baptism of
[1:16:24] Holy Ghost hey man oh the word always
[1:16:27] interprets itself amen
[1:16:29] see that to sell it out Paul revealed to
[1:16:33] them there's one great pearl that's
[1:16:35] greater than John's baptism that was the
[1:16:37] baptism the Holy Ghost and the twelve
[1:16:39] quickly weary baptized the name of Lord
[1:16:42] Jesus Christ and received the Holy Ghost
[1:16:44] treasure because the Holy Ghost came on
[1:16:46] them and they spoke with tongues and
[1:16:48] prophesied hey man glory the Ephesians
[1:16:54] sold out John's baptism or moved on to
[1:16:57] the fresh revelation of the Spirit for
[1:16:59] their time period in order to possess
[1:17:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the one
[1:17:03] pearl of great price oh that's beautiful
[1:17:06] so they're the first example the second
[1:17:09] example is Paul Paul being converted
[1:17:13] from Judaism to Christianity
[1:17:15] Paul was a man who had to sell out all
[1:17:17] of his goodly pearls his moral teachings
[1:17:19] in order to gain the baptism of the holy
[1:17:21] ghost remember by Paul's own words he
[1:17:24] was blameless a hebrew of hebrews a
[1:17:27] dedicated devoted learned man with
[1:17:29] tremendous zeal for moses law but after
[1:17:33] once being in the supernatural presence
[1:17:34] of jesus christ his desires were
[1:17:37] transformed and he eagerly forsook his
[1:17:40] precious self-righteousness denouncing
[1:17:42] them as dung in order that he might win
[1:17:45] Christ amen and then after his
[1:17:48] conversion
[1:17:49] he received the pearl of great price the
[1:17:52] baptism of the holy ghost amen now
[1:17:56] listen how Paul describes the Pearl
[1:17:58] great price
[1:17:59] he says the pro great price he said I
[1:18:01] want to be found in him Christ not
[1:18:03] having my own righteousness which is of
[1:18:05] the law but that's which is through the
[1:18:08] faith of Christ the righteousness which
[1:18:10] is of God by faith that I may know him
[1:18:13] and the powers resurrection and the
[1:18:15] Fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:18:17] conformable unto his death see he was
[1:18:21] actively searching out truth in Judaism
[1:18:24] he was Pharisee of Pharisees praise God
[1:18:26] but then when he found the pearl of
[1:18:28] great price or the profound him he went
[1:18:33] sold out everything it's all done that I
[1:18:35] might have that one pearl praise God hey
[1:18:38] man here's the final thought I preached
[1:18:40] this before but I'm gonna preach it
[1:18:41] again so just me just bear with me give
[1:18:43] me five more minutes thank you lord
[1:18:47] thank you lord raise God
[1:18:48] so my final thought is this for me or
[1:18:50] thought you might remember me saying him
[1:18:51] it's revelation 21 21 and the twelve
[1:18:54] gates were twelve pearls every several
[1:18:59] gate was one pearl with of one pearl so
[1:19:03] they were huge massive pearls and the
[1:19:06] street of the city was pure gold as it
[1:19:08] was transparent glass here we see Christ
[1:19:12] future home the holy city the New
[1:19:15] Jerusalem the tabernacle of God which
[1:19:17] comes down from God out of heaven as the
[1:19:18] eternal abode after all sin death and
[1:19:22] hell are annihilated and forgotten this
[1:19:26] is the eternal city described
[1:19:28] beautifully and here's my brother BAM
[1:19:31] said he says every facet of her beauty
[1:19:33] tells a story of Amazing Grace in Jesus
[1:19:36] love Oh
[1:19:38] so everything you look at everything we
[1:19:40] look at Church in that new city is gonna
[1:19:42] tell of his Amazing Grace and his love
[1:19:49] there's 12 gates three gates on each
[1:19:50] side of the four sides each made from a
[1:19:53] massive pearl so entering the holy city
[1:19:58] you must pass through a massive pearl of
[1:20:01] great price as a reminder of God's
[1:20:04] saving grace to you
[1:20:07] no wonder Christ will wipe all the tears
[1:20:10] from our eyes as we enter the city and
[1:20:11] then we rejoice in his mattress love
[1:20:14] story of redemption because passing
[1:20:16] through there will remember our life
[1:20:18] story we'll remember our deep desire and
[1:20:22] passionate longing to possess the
[1:20:25] ultimate treasure
[1:20:26] God's Spirit will remember his amazing
[1:20:29] grace to let us find that pearl of great
[1:20:31] price
[1:20:33] see our hearts will fear eternally
[1:20:35] grateful that we sold out the many
[1:20:37] goodly pearls of religious truth in
[1:20:40] order to possess the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:42] Ghost and the best word to describe this
[1:20:46] word I'm sorry the best word to describe
[1:20:48] this happy group is the word blessed
[1:20:52] because in Revelation 22 14 and 15
[1:20:55] blessed are they that do His
[1:20:57] commandments that they might have right
[1:21:00] to the Tree of Life and may enter in
[1:21:02] through the gates in this city for
[1:21:04] without our dogs sorcerers and
[1:21:07] whoremongers and murderers and idolaters
[1:21:08] and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
[1:21:11] let's say in our feet praise God I'm
[1:21:15] closing with that by God's grace in that
[1:21:17] beautiful thought my ma'am as we walk in
[1:21:23] there we'll have to pass through the
[1:21:24] Pearl and that will make us remember
[1:21:26] when we found the pearl of great price
[1:21:29] Jesus Christ and that's exactly what the
[1:21:33] Bible says Jesus is the door praise God
[1:21:36] amen that's the door to the Eternal City
[1:21:40] and that's of course we know Christ is
[1:21:42] the door to eternal life
[1:21:43] praise got a musician's if you'll come
[1:21:45] here amen what a blessing praise God so
[1:21:49] I hope there's something in there you
[1:21:50] never saw before because I know there
[1:21:52] was a lot in there I'd never seen before
[1:21:53] - I sat down and meditated on it and
[1:21:55] look to the scripture to help define
[1:21:57] those things
[1:22:03] so let's as we bow our heads here let's
[1:22:05] bow our heads and let's think about this
[1:22:07] the treasure in the field the Pearl
[1:22:11] great price
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:17] what a blessing praise God one the man
[1:22:21] is surprised he goes out and sells
[1:22:24] everything he has so you can have this
[1:22:25] great treasure another one the man's
[1:22:28] actively seized already searching for it
[1:22:30] but then he discovers the great price
[1:22:33] the pro great price in both parables
[1:22:36] they sell out they might have Christ
[1:22:40] hallelujah
[1:22:41] I said a prayer here Heavenly Father we
[1:22:48] love you tonight dear God we thank you
[1:22:50] for these words or help us to see this
[1:22:55] order to just make it fresh here tonight
[1:22:57] that what we have in us is an absolute
[1:23:00] treasure treasure in the field who's
[1:23:06] just hid there in the Old Testament
[1:23:07] layin there all those years we just
[1:23:10] happen to find it nor God like Phillip
[1:23:12] said we've found the Messiah comin see
[1:23:14] and we found boma but really it was God
[1:23:17] finding them
[1:23:22] Thank You Lord God like Simon when he
[1:23:26] first came and told me about the message
[1:23:27] but I found this message really it was
[1:23:31] you finding us preaching like John Piper
[1:23:44] I was seeking I was seeking good
[1:23:46] thoughts
[1:23:47] I wondered for this great privilege
[1:23:58] father Lord if there's anyone here Lord
[1:24:03] that needs to sell out anything what
[1:24:11] beautiful pictures you give us may we
[1:24:15] see the value of the treasure tonight
[1:24:17] may we see the value of just having one
[1:24:19] thing in our life that's really really
[1:24:20] important the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:23] may we see that Lord we we not seek
[1:24:26] little treasures Lord or little pearls
[1:24:28] of relationships or money or pride or
