we heard last week O God and may Lord your spirit have free course amongst us have first place preeminence fill our thoughts help us to meditate upon your word today and father will give you all the glory at the conclusion of this service in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you just being seated praise God so I do have a some slides there by God's grace to misquotes I'd like to share I don't have this thought done what I'd like to do is I'd like to go through all 14 pairs and show Bible examples but I just have a few to show this morning because I spending other time as you'll see how spending majority of time on other scriptures so would like to look at this thought I haven't had many subtitles for the this series but this is part nine times and seasons that just one look at times and seasons I'm a feeling letter Lord to look at these thoughts I want to start it today and then hopefully or willing be able to preach it on Wednesday as well by God's grace also if I remember at the conclusion of this service I'd like to just give everybody an update on you know some of the saints that aren't here anymore like brother Jason and Benjamin Austin and Tanya and Connie so I'd like to give her an update and you know of course well we'll turn off the livestream and so for like that just want to give an update on things by the grace of the Lord and I appreciate your prayers I appreciate everybody's concern for the Saints amen and we're just thankful for God's mercy and let's just keep praying for each and every person praise God let's never give up let's never give up praying Jesus said he's looking for a woman that will knock at the end time and still have faith to believe so we must not faint we must keep praying by the grace of the Lord so let's look at this thought here we did our text this morning I want to start off with this thought from Wednesday as preached on Revelation 12 the Bible defines is the seams to find time as a year and times as more than one year but in this scripture it means two years because half a time was six months so this was the amount of time that the woman Israel brother Ram said revelation 12 deals only with Israel not the bride so she would be fed in the wilderness after Christ ascended to heaven God would cut off the Jew the Jew would be taken off in the wilderness where she'd be fed for three and a half years and then the Bible says you know 1260 days she'll be fed and then the Bible says she's nourished for a time times and half a time so just giving us a few definitions now I haven't studied the word time all the way through the Bible I imagine that's a pretty big study so it'd take me like a day or two to get through that but it's apparent though in this scripture that time represents a year and then times represents two years and a half a time represent six months now as I'm just thinking about this the Holy Spirit you know ministering in my thoughts here I'm turning to Genesis 18 because the scripture just kind of came to my mind and I like to just reference that Genesis 18 where God was visiting Abraham and Sarah in the tent yeah Genesis 18 14 so I don't have this on the slide of just kind of coming to me here is there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I'll return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son when did God visit her the next year in the 25th year because Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac was born so there was the time of life praise the Lord so the next year in other words I'll visit you the next year according to time of life and if you know Genesis 21 the Bible said verse 1 the Lord visited Sara as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken oh God always does that he always does as he says and he always does what he spoken amen the thing to do is be able to hear what he's saying but the sphere of the church can because the church can hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches glory so I just that just kind of came to me there that God visited in the time of life the time appointed the right year praise the Lord so I would look at now months now from what I understand through Scripture seasons seem to be like months so a time is bigger time is like a year times maybe more than one year but then a season of course is a small amount of time in a person's life now that's what just from what I've seen I have searched season all the way through the Bible so that seems to fit through the Bible and we'll be showing some examples here but I want to start with months this thought on months how even months can be a season because there was a purpose in job's months it seemed like job was just struggling for months when he was going through his great tests according to the book of Job so let's read a few scriptures remember job his purpose not at least in part because you know a life can have many purposes right but job is remembered according to James job is remembered for one thing that's patience because the Bible said we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job and I've seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy so Joe one of his great purposes of existence was to manifest God's patience praise God and so when God had Jobe in his mind he like oh I could I'm gonna use job as a testimony he's gonna manifest my patience praise God brother Branham said that Joseph of the Old Testament was gonna manifest perfection because he was a perfect except for the lie that he told about the shepherds amen if you listen to the mighty conquer David 455 that's the brother Branham says Abraham represented justification right each one represented something I like to have a I'm gonna use an attribute of mine as faith I'm a news Abraham for faith and brother Adam said that each person represented a portion of God until Christ came and he represented all of it amen amen he was the fullness of the word the fullness of the attributes of God but Jove in God's mind I'm gonna use this man for patience and the Bible says this after this we read to verse 8 and please ask these three but 17s that I had said in my heart God shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and every work so in Joseph's life there was a certain time of his life for the purpose of patience now from what I've read it seems like job went through this struggle in the 70th year of his life because the Bible said after he came out of this trial God doubled everything and then he lived to be a hundred and forty God doubled his cattle got double his money gotten two doubled everything so it seems like he was 70 years old so in that middle point in his life God lets them go through these months of trial and tests and persecution that's unheard of that you and I don't even want to go through that do we right we know that's why Jesus pray lead us not into temptation right that's that's why that's in the Lord's Prayer because God allowed Satan to test him in this major manner this this extreme manner of losing family and finances and and then health he lost everything except God's grace amen that's all yeah he's lost everything except the integrity of his heart amen not to sin and not to say anything evil against God so see there was a time for job's life to produce patience have you come to that place yet have you come to the place yet where you feel like I can't wait any longer but God saying okay wait another month god I can't wait another week God said wait another year right think about that there's tie a purpose for everything under our lives and there's a purpose and a time for it and when we get to art when we think this is the end of our our strength God said wait a little longer you know you can't get bigger muscles unless you stretch and rip those muscles right that's the only way you're going to get bigger muscles if we want faith muscles we got to go through bigger tests right because God knows we can handle it God knows we can get through it God knows you can handle a couple more reps to get a little stronger in faith right God knows God will allow you to be pushed God allow you to go through the fires God allow you to be tested in order to produce the purpose of character in your life there's a time for every work under heaven job says this so I am made to possess months of a Nina so at the beginning of this this discussion he causes this vanity was that vanity Church let me ask was a vanity was this useless for job to go through this no because four thousand years later James says remember the patience of Job amen how many people brother bang do you think will walk up to job on that day and say thank you Joe for your testimony amen all right but see when he's going through it it seems like life is in vain this is just useless this is just awful what is my life why am I being tested like this why does it seem like everything's falling apart Jobe said that he said these are months of vanity this just like doesn't make any sense but yet it made all the sense in the mind of God oh god help us say amen don't be too scared Church in the midst of trials that's the time to shout the praise of God Amen that I'm going through this too shall pass I'll go through this season I'll come out better on the other side amen Jobe said which we all would say right we'd all say if you couldn't sleep at night you'd probably say that just like Joe I've only had a couple sleepless nights they've been pretty awful nights but Joe many nights couldn't sleep scratching the boils all the pain he's going through he says these are months of vanity later chapter 14 he said seeing his days there determines the number of his months are with thee so he knows so Joe was trying to work through this battle of months I'm Billy these are money's are awful months but I know God has a number determined praise God I heard a good I just heard something encouraging this week I liked it if you knew like if you knew your your answer to your prayer was in one more week because you hold on another week if you knew it was next month that someone in your family was going to get saved or cover the message would you be able to hold on faith for them of course if you knew but the point is we don't know and so since we don't know we've got to just stand on faith with faith means assurance or a revelation of God's will we've just got to stand on the faith that God's given us because we don't know when it's come to pass we've got to keep believing that it will come to pass so Joe's working through his mind it's in his heart you know my god I know you've determined a certain number of months for me to go through this amen we can say the same thing today praise God this trial is only going to us a certain number of months and God will be pitiful at the end gotta be merciful and God will bring me out of this trial see he's dealing with months we don't know how many months but he's using months he's not using years he's using months now he said the variant cuz memory Allah who comes pretty soon straightens him out he's getting toward the ends of his of his talk and he said he continued as parable o that I whereas in the months past as in the days when God preserved me he didn't realize it but God was preserving him there - right when his candles shined upon my head and when his by his lie I walked through the darkness see he was longing although just a few months ago life was so great I was on the mountaintop a few months ago why am I in the valley or if life could just be easier don't we all say that church we have so many similarities the joke all right as far as approaching trials now thankfully we haven't had to go to the extreme tests that he's gone through although we know some people have who've lost loved ones and in dramatic ways or disastrous ways we know that but still the point I'm trying to make is that it was months that he had to endure months and these months of testing producing his testimony where we could say look at the patience of Job now look I love this now it's God's turn to talk to Joe about months so don't keep saying all these hard months I wish it was like the old months and God says let me tell you about months Joe he said do you know at the time when the wild goats on the rock bring forth or can you mark when the kinds new calves see all those mountain goats and all these animals at jobs open up jobs living in nice little city down there and earn right God's like what do you know about the what what do you know about the months of the animals up there do you know when the when the right months are when they when they bring forth when they have babies can you tell me those months can you number the months that they fulfill how many months does a goat live up in the mountains job got the idea on that about the hinds the gazelle and the deer ha how many months do they live see God's not just like this pattycake kind of baby baby cake kind of person is he he's merciful but he's also he also knows what he's doing praise God and he knows speaking a job like this will produce what God wanted which was him to rent his clothes and repent in dust and ashes and say God you know more than I do I said things I should not have said praise God all these hardwoods all these hard months and god said tell me the number of months job oh god is so great they men church we gotta be careful what comes out of our mouths god help us amen God help all of us we start complaining about months God's gonna ask us what do you know about months right so I think it's beautiful how God knows how to Humble us remember this whole time I forget how many questions I think it was 61 God asked Joe God didn't tell Joe one answer to his question God asks him questions and God said where were you when I formed the where were you and I laid the foundations earth and all the sons of God the Angels shouted for joy where were you at ceases sometimes godness that when they give us the answers he just wants to bring us to a place of humility because memmer through suffering produces what suffering produces what church pride or obedience he is suffering always produces obedience that's what God wanted look with job so I look at David said I love this my times are in thy hand the years right time is a year times or more than one David said my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from them that persecute me so he's running from Saul and he says my times my years I've been running for years but my years are in your hands can you imagine running from your own father law in the hand of God right it's in God's it's in God's here it's not outside God hasn't forgotten you you're in the very hand of God you're not cast out God by God rejected by God you are in the hand of God we all need that perspective don't we I'm in the hand of God when I'm running from trial to trying to escape the floods that come in the enemy that comes in like a flood the Giants in our lives right the enemies that come up about us we're still in the hand of God to make your faces shine upon that servant save me for thy Mercy's sake Church I'm thankful to know my years are in God's hands God's the one that's allowed me to live this long if he gives me some more years thank the Lord all my years are in God's hands I love this now we must understand what the years are calling us to do now it's easy to see in a few examples but let me read this first like speaking of like fathers and mothers like you're the years that you're raising children right so I don't forget that that's why I said I don't wanna forget that but let's read us and of the half a tribe of manasseh 18,000 which were expressed by name to come and make David King imagine having 18,000 people behind you they have all these political rallies you know make this person president make this was just one tribe right this is I'm sorry this is just a half tribe all these people trying to make David King and have a children of Issachar which were men I like this that had understanding of the times of the years to know what Israel out to do that's what we need today we need men and women who know what God wants them to do right now in these times these years of their life don't waste these years these are precious years amen we should say God gave me understanding for these years to know what we ought to do the heads of them were 200 and other brethren were at their commandment they knew what to do the Bible said that David was King and had run over the house of Judah 7 years and 6 months so in these last few years remember David ruled over Hebron first for 7 years not all Israel had run so those last few years the men of Issachar started saying he's going to be king over all of Israel that's what Samuel Samuel anointed him and he's going to be king over at all so these men knew the word of the hour going they knew the message they knew the leader for the hour praise God and they said we're making ready we're going to get everybody gathered around ready we know what God wants to be done right now God wants to make David king over all of Israel and so they gathered support and they support it with all they could they did everything in their power to bring to pass God's leadership for that hour amen because David's purpose of his life the Bible said was to be ruler over my people Israel not just have rod but all Israel Amen I like that and may God help us to apply that to our lives a little bit that all of us can see what is what's happening today the move is on who the bride the moves out on the Prophet program said that move is on the bride and she only moves when she's got thus saith the Lord like Amen read in the church age book this week because we were talking about that and the bride early moves with thus saith the Lord to see the move is on us and we are supposed to make Christ king we're supposed to make the Christ King the king of our lives amen because we know Jesus Christ is coming into power amen so anything we can do to put Christ more at the forefront of our lives is what we should be doing like we said some of these some of these are more obvious than others so yeah later on in the same chapter about the meta mystic are these men of war that could keep rank see they could keep their place they could they just sit together in heavenly places and not get out of rank and came with a perfect heart to have run to make David king over Israel and all the rest of Israel were one heart to make David King now Church you and I can see that there's times of our lives where God's called us and we know what mean we must do if we have young children like I do and vagin we've got young children youngsters Naomi then we should know what we ought to do we ought to train up our children in the fear of God we ought to live such a godly life in front of them we ought to just fill them with love and fill them with teaching and model what it means to be a Christian praise God now that's an easy time and season for us to see that we should not put that off that should be at the very forefront of our duties as families they men now if you're single than or you're married without children then you have to seek God - what to do in that air that season of your life what is God what ought you do in that time praise God so see that's just one example that could easily think of what's your younger or middle-aged or getting older there's different seasons of life and you must do what God has called you to do what you ought to do in that stage of life amen now there's just a few general scriptures on time I'd like to look at the Bible said wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead in Christ shall give thee light how many awake in Christ how many got the light of Christ I'm not sleeping I'm awake in Christ I've got his light see them that ye walk circumspectly so if you are awake and the light of Christ has waken you up you're supposed to walk circumspectly which is accurately diligently or exactly so it's kind like a example of target practice right you're supposed to your life should be accurately aims in some direction we should know our purpose and this one I believe that God is going to bring us too we should know our gifts as I said the beginning of this series we should know our gifts so we know or what God has called us to do what's the purpose of my life what do I need to invest in so that God can manifest his Spirit in my life if my life is living for others and I've got gifts that are for others how can I accurately align my life so God can get the most out of the gifts he's placed in my life I just wander from pillar to post and wonder from service the service week to week month to month year to year season the season not just wandering around but but be very accurate I know what God wants me to do right now praise the Lord see we need to walk accurately not missing the mark sinner is the word that means missing the mark right in the Latin if I'm not mistaken means to miss the mark is that right Latin oh great go thank you I knew it was a foreign language seaso fools now see this is where foolish virgin and wise virgin teaching comes in really simply wise Christians will walk very accurately and diligently in their direction God's called them to go in though no they'll be very accurate God wants me to do this right now God wants me to do that now I'm going to be able to touch myself pretty soon the book the book goes on presale on Friday then it gets the next Friday goes on sale so I'm gonna be able to see the effects now from though that book if this was the accurate time in season four that and I hope I could go back here and say it was I believe it was is this something I've never done before so strange and so seems out so outside of my natural thinking it seemed to be led by the Holy Spirit but see accurately doing exactly what God would have me to do redeeming the time now redeem means to make wise for a sacred use because days are evil how many can say amen to that these days that we live amongst our evil their evil days Evil's all around us but Paul said redeem that time buy it back make a sacred use of it make sure you use those days wisely so there's another word there's another way time is used is just all your time not just a year but all your time now you know look he just kind of goes on I want to just read this because this kind of ties with the men of Issachar wherefore you be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is so the men of Issachar had understanding to know what to do Paul says the same thing wise Christians have understanding they know what to do they know God's will God's will was to make David King and that after that seventh year in had brought God's will was to make him King they caught the inspiration we're gonna make him King right they understood this is what we're supposed to do god help us to see what God is doing right now amen verse 18 a be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to Lord so if you and I do these things we'll definitely be able to say that we understand God's will if we're filled with the spirit constantly speaking in worship and Thanksgiving so always having a song on your heart always singing the songs of God and always giving thanks the Bible said give thanks always for all things you mean even this even these months of patience give thanks yes even these months and years of patience you've got to give God thanks in the midst of those months for all things under God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah now collage is like a mini letter of Ephesians how many knew that it's almost like Paul Paul wrote both from prison and it's almost like he wrote the Ephesian one and it's almost like before he sent it out he just wrote a shorter version of it and sent it out to the city of chaos it's almost has so many similarities walking wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man so your whole walk is in wisdom and wisdom the beginning of it is fearing God so churches just that simple more today I'm going to walk in your will and know what I'm walking in the fear of God I don't want to do my will today my brother cam said that we should pray and say God put me in your path I've been praying that this week put me in your path amen so that's how wisdom begins fearing God and say God put me in your path today put me in your path for this year or this month put me in your path help me to catch the time and season and understand what I'm supposed to do for God hallelujah let's move now to some seasoned scriptures here this was pretty good thought from the scripture and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them and they continued a season in ward so these Butler and Baker the two men they continued a season in the war now Joseph was in jail two years right we went through that a couple weeks ago but now they just continue a season that's why it seems like it was months and they dream to dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to interpretation of the dream the butler and the Baker the King which were bound in prison now that's interesting this season was within the two-year period but Joseph was set there at the season of life and death so Joseph played a crucial part in the season of someone else's life amen glory you know I think about when my coach just died a few or last month I had people text me and say God had you there at the right time in season to let everybody know that he actually believed in Jesus cuz he never let anybody know and the people could have hope and instead of bitterness and mourning in their heart that they don't know if he served God but I got it on tape I got to ask him I said are you trusting in Jesus Christ for your salvation and he said yes I am I had to be there at the season of his life the very end of his life to be there to give people assurance that he tried to serve God and read the Bible 25 times that's that's pretty faithful as far as I'm concerned that looks like the fear of God to me but it's so Joseph was there at a season of his life you know over the course of this church we've had different brothers move in like young brothers that aren't married and then God you know they were going to college like one of the brothers name was Peter he's out in Arizona now but but he was just here for a year maybe a couple of months year and months and then it's like God after college God gave him a job and sent out to Arizona and now he's got a wife and children well when he left he said he said brother Jesse thank you that you were there this season of my life this church was such a blessing at this season of my life a church that's how it is with people who come and go it's already half our mercy we we don't know what God's doing and even like this list Simon in order then the service we don't know what God's doing God may be using us to be a light for people for a very small season of their life but we've got to be the ones who stand on God's Word amen Joseph just fed them the word he just fed them the revelation of their dream for that little season and then they were good they both forgot about him but God didn't forget about it amen hallelujah people will use you like jesus said people will use you for your spiritual gifts or for what you can do for their life but don't mind if they forget you because you know God will never forget his children your engrave in the palm of his hands amen hallelujah amen just for a few seasons a few season your important somebody and all of a sudden see you later I'd say as hard as a pastor I've been through I've been through a machine I've got many a tear many seasons you try to get everything you can to people see you later you know how it is with friends - yeah but our responsibility is not to get disheartened Joseph's got this heart right but God was still with him amen we may guess get disheartened but joy comes in the morning a new season comes amen we just got to continue faithful stay faithful think about the my battles he had Wow God you know I've been in here almost two years I - people come in I felt the Friends of God God moves supernaturally and yet they forget about me I'm still here hunk is God even with me anymore think about the battle Church supernaturally visions in jail Supernatural revelations and then they forget about you thank God he never forgets about his children huh striking isn't it you're just striking these are really striking things remember I've been saying this repeatedly about I just want to show it to you David would not remove the are Coloradan unto him in the City of David but David carried it aside in the house of obed-edom heed I'm sorry obed-edom the get tight and the article or continue the house of obed-edom the get tight three months and the Lord bless obed-edom and all of his house now I need to study out I did study out seasons I need to study all the quotes on times and seasons and this one I was sharing earlier David felt led of the Lord but BAM said you have to have the time seasoned person the word and there's one more I can't marry always oh the prophet yeah so David only missed on one of those the word he only missed on the word everything else was right there's a prophet there it was who is everything else he forgot to put the ark upon the shoulders and said he put it on a new car and it caused death right a man that were just trying to be kind so I like to protect God's our key reaches out and death strikes and programs said death will strike when we try to do things without consulting God's Word oh god help us to consult your Lord today men before we do anything consult the Word of God amen but as I said I don't I'm not down on David he only missed it by three months right that's pretty good that's pretty close he was in other words he was in the channel the Holy Spirit and that's what we want to be we want to be in the channel of the Holy Spirit to bring the word the ark back to God's God's Jerusalem amen you back to the capital city amen bring God's Ark back to where it should be in Jerusalem so three months month see it's again it's months a season of his life and in that season whoever had that Ark you were blessed if you stayed true that word if word was in your house you'll be blessed amen that's so true now this is just interesting one and let the children Israel also be or keep the Passover at his appointed season so that we're coming up on that right we're coming up on Passover it was in a appointed season there's a time so it was like a like this one little month of the year right where that Passover and unleavened bread and then firstfruits in the 14th day of this month so here we have season here we have a season but in the season we have a month that's even he shot out keep it in his appointed season according to all the rights of according to all the ceremonies there ye shall keep it the Passover was kept in a month in a season all right now let's look at a few scriptures about all seasons so see Church there's some things that will not be seasonal there's some things that you and I we we can say okay this is just a season but there's some things that aren't some things we don't we can't say all that I'm not ready this isn't the season there's some things we can't how many can say amen to that there's some things in the scripture you and I can't say well I can't do it's not the right season is there some things we've got to be instant in season and out of the season and that's judging evil and doing good look with God remember Jethro Tull Moses and Moses chose able men of all Israel made them heads are the people rulers of thousands rulers of 100 0:52 rows of tens and they judge the people at all seasons because you have all these problems you have all these troubles and struggles in the church you can't say well I'm just going to judge in the in the spring that's the only time I'm gonna make these things run right well I'll just take summer when I have free time and that's what I'll deal with all these problems no God was moving Moses to see that all problems must be del immediately not time and season we must try to deal with them immediately like the Bible said don't let the Sun the Sun things took place at all seasons and that's dealing with sin like if I hurt vang or if I heard you know Aaron or somebody I shouldn't say well I know I hurt them but I'll wait a few months and we'll see how how it feels then maybe they'll forget about it maybe we'll just kind of brush it under the rug we can't do that with sin because sin is a seed as well a seed of discrepancy right and that sin if it's not rooted up if you don't say sorry if I don't repent say sorry it's only going to grow it'll become a root of bitterness Paul said don't let Paul so don't take any root of bitters he said uproot the root of bitterness and he said be rooted and grounded in amen oh yeah that's the kind of roots we need a brighter Christ Fellowship which I believe are here I really do believe they're here I really do and if some don't see it well I wish they look a little harder right because if I've done any wrong please let me know right so that's you that's how you feel - Paul said I charge thee Timothy before God and the Lord Jesus Christ think about that he's just a lowly preacher he's not a prophet to the aged but a prophet charges the low preacher I'm charging you I'm giving you a commission in the prends of Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead is appearing in his kingdom preach the word amen don't just read mine just don't read my eyes right just don't play tapes you preach the word that's God's bad or not that's something we've been talking about it's just the struggle the hour you know it's the wave of it's the wind of doctrine going through right now preach the word be instant that means ready in season out of season and it's true brother amen there's times there season I feel like I feel like preaching and then there's other seasons I don't really feel like preaching maybe I'm sick maybe I'm exhausted maybe I have in mind battles maybe I'm hurt maybe somebody broke my heart and I don't really feel like preaching praise God so there sighs we don't feel like it there's times if you have a gift which you all do there's times you won't feel like using your gift there's times you won't feel like investing in your gift hey it's true it's like that for everybody but with these with with gifts and with the word and knowing that God is going to judge us by what we do with our gifts Paul said don't don't stop just keep preaching be ready in your season and odyssey's and just be ready all the time because you know Jesus Christ could come back any time reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering so people don't listen right away just keep being long-suffering with them right if people would obey and they still want to come to church just let them keep coming to church now unless there's you know fornicating and then they won't confess it then get that 11 out of the church but they're just learning how to obey the Lord and are living as clean as they can they just can't get victory whatever reason be long-suffering with them and doctrine that's what we're doing today for time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine and isn't that what we got today I can put the scripture like I did on Facebook I can put that scripture that thighs our nakedness and the scripture literally says I'm gonna uncover your thighs your nakedness and some of those people that see that post today are still gonna wear shorts tomorrow or whatever it heats up like we're living in a time they won't even endure something so solid something so clear right jesus said father only goes ten days later Peter says Lord Jesus Christ and all five examples in the book of Acts our Lord Jesus Christ it's so clear but they can't endure sound doctrine thank God that Jesus said blessed are your eyes where they see rested on your ears for they hear be so be ready be solid constantly be ready with the Word of God so you cos there's gonna come a time all they want as preachers that will give them their lusts the Bible said we don't with these cases with sin it's not a choice well I can kind of let down my guard a little bit you know I'm not really in the season of temptation no sir you know ma'am we are always in the season of temptation we must always be ready to fight off Satan now let's get times and seasons here I'm gonna set my timer for 15 minutes okay that'll give me that be good okay now we read this in our text and I'm just gonna skip through this cuz we already read this but did you notice Church now this is something I stuff to study but this is so striking to me there what I'm saying is that this is I feel like I've hit a a vein in the earth of gold and I just found out just the first gold nugget but if there's gold here and there's got to be gold under there that's what I felt like today so I'm not going to get as deep today because I'm not ready to go deep but I still felt led to preach this now these are both opposite and I'm going to explain this in a minute born and die or both opposites but they can also be complementary which means they can happen at different times or they can happen at the same time now but I'll lose you on this they're both opposites you know you like program born 1909 died 1965 right we can all see that opposites but spiritually many times they happen right at the same time so here's a man as an example brother Graham died in 1909 these are now these are opposites planting and pluck up here's opposites you and I we plant in the spring if we do any vegetables or fruits whatever do but in the fall you got to pluck it up and take all those dead ones and burn them or whatever you do use them for compost they're not at the same time there are opposite times ones when it's getting warmer you plant and the other when it's getting colder you pluck up those are opposites right so what I need it I need more time to go through all these you know kind of show more examples I just need more time now here let's look at that spiritual you say born and die can happen at the same time yes brother Ram said once you die out fully he'll come in fully amen I know yeah they're so close together if you want to be bored you got to die amen so see now we can start seeing some spiritual meaning here is this a season of my life physically to die it's a season for geneviève to be born right and this baby the new baby bang bang Junior not speak anything about it but there's a time to be born and a time to die well spiritually there's a season where your your longing to die and be born again amen die out because Jesus said the scene must rot and die and then it brings much for a man so this is where you and I can look at these fourteen seasons and start thinking mind where are we at right now where are we right now if if that's your desire to know where you are I for one I have for one would like to know her him now where he get to this one this is so striking that I just I was I was just really struck by that yesterday so spiritually there's a time to be born and die it isn't it interesting you get fill with the Holy Ghost that's the first thing and now you're ready to live through the seasons of life isn't that striking isn't that striking and then peace like dying you die in peace right and you go off to meet Jesus amen glory and all the brothers run up and say my precious brother and they hug you now not maybe not millions for me but maybe there'll be like 50 run up and say my precious brother couple people that knew me in heaven because they're so few today interesting now spiritually think about that there's time to plant and pluck up spiritually let me go to I got another slide on that one yeah let's go this one so spiritually there's a time to get and lose this happens at the same time when you lose your life jesus said you find it amen oh I love that you see these have great spiritual applications to a stake this is a season of our life jesus said let a man go to the plow and look back and they go out maybe I should not have done this right there's a certain season where you've got to just say I've sold out I'm not looking back I'm pressing on I work that 11th hour I'll finish this 11th hour and I'll get my penny and I work till Jesus comes I'm not looking back I've lost my life that I might gain my life thank you Lord amen that we can find our true life on this earth and then when you are real Holy Ghost real Christian you won't live your own life you'll live the life that Christ has chosen for you and then I love this one 13 love and hate Jesus had you got to hate your family in order to love him see now that you say they love righteousness at the same time at the same time I just as men take I hate the sin and then I love Jesus so much my glory times and seasons there's a purpose for all these seasons under heaven there's a purpose for all these in our spiritual life now I'd like to know that one refrain from embracing I liked it kind of now I can see in the natural a little bit but I'd kind of like to know on that one too by God's grace so like I said I'm study on that more let me here's the one that was so striking to me the last one is a time of war and a time of peace it's the last number fourteen of the the pairs and Psalm 37 this is beautiful says mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace isn't that amazing I just about blew me off my chair and I was studying yesterday peace is the last season is the last time and the Bible's at the end of that righteous man is peace praise God that's beautiful the beginning is being born by the Holy Ghost dying itself and the end of that Holy Ghost filled believer is peace in Christ glory your warring against Satan all the way up to death amen jesus said be faithful not until unto death amen right so it's time for you to die you say okay God take me now I'm ready to die because I fought a good fight I finished the core saying that I'm ready for eternal peace I don't know amen the end of that man will be peace so the last season of a Christians life will be such peace in God they won't feel any any hard feelings it won't feel any farness from God or I just feel closer to the Lord I just he may come any moment I may take my last breath any moment I feel the peace of God in my heart I'm singing I worship it I'm just thankful for everything the peace of God what a season to be in praise God what a season god help us now remember also I want to bring out here the fruit of the Spirit is these nine fruits we know that remember number nine is the number of finality or maturity and so fruit is the final purpose of a plant right through is the final purpose and one of those fruits is peace I forgot to highlight it I want to highlight that give me a moment let me highlight that so then I got it for next time all right peace so the end of that man is peace and that fits perfectly with the fruit of the Spirit the purpose the the maturity of a Christian will be peace at the end that's what he'll mature too she'll mature to be a very peaceful person enjoy a season of peace with God amen now look at this but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night now let's look at meditate real quick it means to muse or to devise it means to imagine the law of God look at that and if a man of God or a woman of God meditates and delights in the Word of God they'll be like a tree planted by rivers of water that brings forth his fruit in his season so people wonder oh I don't have that why don't I feel the fruits of God in my life well there's a prerequisite to fruit you got to meditate in the Word of God in other words you got to let yourself be planted and you really got to take time meditating praying reading the Word of God you just have to give quiet yourself down make time people say there's not time you've got to make time for God amen that's where and after that after meditating and remaining in it being planted in the word then you bring forth the fruit in the season then you manifest love for these last few months I've never felt such love in my life these last few months I've never had such joy in my life these last few months this last season of my life I've never felt such peace or long-suffering or gentleness I've never felt such goodness or I've never seen such faith in my life these last few months I felt such meekness in my heart I've been so God has given me such temperate self-control I used to struggle with this other thing these last few months I've had victory over brother that's the kind of testimonies that really bless your heart because those are more than just a short little anointing that lasted a while and then you know you're discouraged you're upset but these are fruits that took time and seasons and the rest the Word of God being planted being faithful amen day in day out that produces this fruit of the Spirit this daily meditation this this month long this season long meditation how many want to meditate on God's Word oh it's the sweetest times in my life is when you meditate on God's Word and the Bible said be still know that I'm God like that's God commands us to do that sit still get planted and just soak it in soak it in and after that will come some fruit out of that so see it's prerequisite now here's another interesting scripture but the wisdom about law and wisdom at the beginning is first pure then peaceable then gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy since what God's wisdom is like I think there's 7 fold description there 1 2 3 4 5 yep 6 7 no 8 8 okay so a wisdom has an Eightfold manifestation I already preached on that I just could remember which number was and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of then that make peace amen so this is sown in peace so it's planted in peace so you've got to take see you got to take God's Word in your heart when you're meditating when you're calm right when you're just you're just gonna be I'm just gonna be here for a while Lord just plant something in my heart amen it's planted in peace of them that make peace now let me see how much I mean I gotta stop here in just a moment but let me see where a good place to stop would be yeah let me I'll go a few more I'll just go a couple more here okay Daniel now you who members this then Daniel went in and desire to the king that they would give him the time and that he would show the king the interpretation now that time was just a few days in that case Daniel hazard and said blessed be the name of God for ever and ever for wisdom and my are his and he changes the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding I think we can all see with the last election that things were changing a little bit like we all saw in 2004 and 2008 with Barack Obama we all saw things changing and enough for the worse right because George W Bush and Bill Clinton all were on record saying marriage is between one man one woman and then the seasons changed and here comes Obama in the second term and now he says marriage can be between a man and a man a woman a woman they took a change of season because they're both on record they even had a special it's like a marriage Act I forget what it is but George W Bush signed it I remember it because that's what I was he was the first person I voted for so see it's but God is behind all of that God is changing that as well God's allowing it right in order to produce and fulfill prophecy amen because Jesus said as it was in the days of lot so shall be in the coming of the Son of Man so God's allowing that God's allowing these seasons and times to change he removes bush brings up Obama removes Obama sets up Trump who's next Sanders Trump again who knows oh I just pray for the best most godly person that's what I'm praying for get rid of abortion my goodness it's God changes these he gives wisdom the wise and knowledge him their understanding that's that's what Daniel says God is the one who changes these things and he changes the times and seasons yeah I think I read that one already yeah oh yeah had that twice that's strange okay now let's stay on our feet I'm gonna close with this did you know right after Jesus raised from the dead he was seen forty days one of the last questions his disciples asked us was about times and seasons so see Church of you if you're gonna be a Holy Ghost field saint or if you are one you're always interested in the times and seasons praise the Lord so I asked earlier who wants to know what times and seasons I hope your hands if your hands gonna be up I hope your heart was saying me me I want to know because the very imagine having just a few minutes with Christ what would he ask him here's what they asked him Lord wilt thou at this time restore the Kingdom of Israel is the time is this the time of the millennium in other words that they were and that's what they were asking because the millennium Jerusalem's the center again right but man said they'll build a temple in Jerusalem before the heavenly one comes a thousand years later right so see this is what they're wondering this is what the soon-to-be they weren't Holy Ghost feel yet but these soon-to-be Holy Ghost filled believers were wondering when is this millennium gonna set in when will the kingdom of Christ come and Israel be restored to her glory that's what you and I asked Lord when is the rapture coming when is this when is this millennium gonna send it Lord I'm so tired I just want I love the earth but I want to live on this earth when there's no more world systems when it's Christ's system amen when it's the day of the Lord not the day a man the day of the Lord or when is it your coming that's what we ask - so one of the last questions is this is this the time when is the time and think about it often do you pray that Lord is this the time to do healing is this the time to save a soul is this a time for revival don't we pray that all the time see Christians are concerned with the time because we want to make the right use of God's time and we don't want to miss God's timing and he said to them it's not for you it's not for you to know the times and seasons which the father has put in his own power is that just like God sometimes I'll answer give you the answer other times no how many times have you prayed something with with all sincerity you might have fast and you might have prayed you might have not ate in that day or a day days on end but the answer still comes back not right now not now so did they get up upset with Jesus and leave the church no did they kick dust autumn and see why can't you tell me of course not well can you do when you love Jesus what can you do just say okay all right just say Amen so beat Jesus said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power he said but let me tell you about power not for you to know the times and see the millennium we're just getting into the feast of weeks we're just getting the Pentecost I don't know yeah you're a little ahead of the seasons amen let me tell you what season you're in god help us to see that season be a season of power Holy Ghost power amen glory and you'll be a witness then you'll be a witness in Akron glory you'll be witnessing copley you'll be witness in Akron unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen so Jesus knew it wouldn't be best for them to know it's better that you don't know when the millennium is gonna happen I'm gonna save that to where my prophet preaches the future home thank you lord I'm gonna save that for about 2,000 years later when that seventh angel he finishes the mystery of God not for use for them down the road and Laodicea praise the Lord thank you Lord amen he said I believe with all of my heart were living in the last days I there's not too much would break this now look how humble program is and my reputation may be wrong of the scripture that Jesus could not come tonight I believe that that little I believe that what little is left to be fulfilled could be fulfilled before daylight in the morning and I'd see and I may be wrong there the time without fulfilling but it's at hand I believe that and or Paul believed that John believed that Pollock are believed that Iranians believe that Martin believed that all the rest of them believe it so in other words every Holy Ghost filled Christian thought that Jesus was going to come in their lifetime every one of them oh it's got to be today it's got to be not the days of lot you know remember Martin Luther spoke out against homosexuality in his day it was it was going on in that day he could have said my it's just like lot Lots day all this homosexuality see but everyone believed it was their day program tells us why God does that what if God were two children told John the Revelator now it's going to be two thousand years before my coming John would have come back told the church now he would have left so happy to talk to Jesus that he would have come back like this brother man said well guess we might as well eat and drink and be merry because there ain't gonna be because there's gonna be lots of generations Jesus isn't coming back for 2,000 years see so see the church would be loose not walking circumspectly not accurately walking according to the commands of God there would have been no on the mark make sure my life is right with God I've got all this sin out of my life that's what Jesus wants us to do and after all it's your anticipations if you fall asleep in the watch that you wake up with some God want you to wake up with the same anticipation so see whatever your character is whatever your character is that's what you're taking with you well part of your character is your anticipation for Christ's coming because mother ham says if you die with that anticipation you'll raise with it yes because it ain't gonna hinder one thing you're gonna be right there and time anyhow see what I mean when Saint Maarten awakes in the resurrection st. Paul all the rest of them it'll be just as fresh as if they were right in the back that's right Church battling right away because they went down under those same anticipations I've fought a good fight I'm fighting against Rome Paul could say I'm fighting against all this evil and the mystery of iniquity I'm fighting against all this he went down that way and so he'll raise up that same way amen hallelujah he said they went now with their same anticipations looking for his coming they'll come a scream come up higher a bride and up will come the whole church you see so see it doesn't matter let's get the Lord Rama vows amen it doesn't matter the time in season Laurey it doesn't matter Malik I'm a man once you come and you have a song but let me know if not I could think of one here I had one on my heart but how many appreciate God's Word today the very last thing they asked Jesus in flesh one of the times and seasons what is this millennium gonna roll in and you said I'm not going to tell you because I don't want you to get loose on me I want you to be ready I want you to be instant in season out of season I want you to fight that devil with everything you've got brother sister hold that sword of the Spirit or know the hold that sort of or shield of faith rather and just chop out everything you can cover yourself protect yourself but chop against any enemy you can have faith in God and if you go down dying like when many of them do no they didn't brother branham go down with the shield and sword in hand he was going back to preach the trade of the serpent he was going down he went down with the sword in the shield right there he wasn't done preaching I'm walking away from preaching I'm retired though he was right in the battle that's how we've got to go to if God takes us that way we've got to go down with a shield of faith I'll defeat everyone to Satan's lies up I was extinguished every one of those fiery darts and I'll be able to attack him and overcome him and I'll Drive back the enemy in Jesus Christ name I'm fighting the good fight how many good fighters we have today fighting for Jesus Christ or praise God glory let's just bow our heads for word of Prayer if you'd like prayer to know times and seasons of your life just raise your hand and acknowledge it unto God my hands are up to have any father we just pray this simple little prayer Lord thank you for the word that we've heard today thank you for the Holy Spirit Lord that we feel amongst us dear God Oh God we want to do what's right we want to be like those sons of Issachar to know what we ought to do we want to understand what season we're in the times were in these years one of these years right here for Lord we seek your face today O God we pray O God show us your will Lord show us the purposes of our lives in individual manner and also as a church Lord God as your prophet said churches go through ups and downs highs and lows hot and colds revivals and they're not revivals help us to understand the season that were in dear God and Lord let us see the fruit that comes out of each season dear Lord maybe it's the fruit of such patience that we've never seen ourselves be this patient before where I've never looked at my brother or my sister and seen such long-suffering they can put up with this mean purse in their life even more or they have such love for their enemies that we just never seen on that matter before granite have any father that's your people Lord Jesus ministered to them now as we sing and pray lord thank you for your word today thank you for the songs it's so good to be in your house today Lord God we asked Jesus to minister not through these songs as we worship you in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen praise God [Music] [Music] Lord you a song that I see love in your [Music] in your in your time he makes off take beautiful [Music] guard me you are to eat Lord my life is what I bring Lord is what I bring hey nice eat you anyone desires prayer you're welcome to come up let's see this one more time in God's time oh god my life is what I breathe [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
