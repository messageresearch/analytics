[28:19] God thank your father God now pray Lord

[28:26] you Lord and we ask how did you grant it
[28:28] to us here tonight it will give you all
[28:30] the glory in Jesus Christ name terrset
[28:34] amen let's take our Bibles here tonight
[28:36] let's go to revelation 17 I think I want
[28:39] to move on from chapter 16 I covered
[28:40] most of what I wanted to cover there and
[28:45] the revelation 17 of course is a very
[28:48] familiar to us but I still like to go
[28:52] through and just do a few thoughts on
[28:53] that tonight we'll see maybe we one or
[28:55] two services we'll see what the Lord has
[28:57] in revelation 17 I like to just start at
[29:00] verse one revelation 17 verse 1 I don't
[29:09] know how much my children know about
[29:11] this so with a small group like this I
[29:13] think it's okay if they hear it you know
[29:15] maybe their first time here in it but I
[29:18] have three videos on Mystery Babylon on
[29:22] the website and there they got a pretty
[29:24] good amount of views so it's a good
[29:28] topic it's one of the twelve mysteries
[29:30] of the New Testament so it's really
[29:32] critical that it's preached and
[29:34] hopefully their children get a lot out
[29:35] of it and not brother Aaron I hope you
[29:36] get some out of there too by God's grace
[29:39] so but parmi if there's a little bit of
[29:42] overlap but I just feel led to go right
[29:44] through and like I said maybe one or two
[29:46] services on this
[29:47] let's look to the Lord here as we looked
[29:51] at the scripture
[29:52] revelation 17 1 and there came one of
[29:56] the seven angels which had the seven
[29:58] vials and talked with me saying unto me
[30:01] come hither I will show unto thee the
[30:04] judgment of the great and sitteth
[30:06] upon many waters with whom the kings of
[30:11] the earth have committed fornication and
[30:13] the inhabitants of the earth have been
[30:17] made drunk with the wine of her
[30:19] fornication so he carried me away in the
[30:22] spirit into the wilderness and I saw a
[30:23] woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast
[30:26] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[30:29] heads and ten horns and the woman was
[30:32] arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and
[30:34] decked with gold and precious stones and
[30:37] pearls having a golden cup in her hand
[30:39] full of abominations and filthiness of
[30:41] her fornication let's read verse five
[30:44] together rather on three one two three
[30:48] and upon her forehead was a name written
[30:50] Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of
[30:54] harlots and abominations of the earth
[30:57] let's just bar heads for one more word
[30:59] of Prayer let's ask God to help us here
[31:02] tonight teach us through his word and
[31:03] ultimately like verse 8 says give us
[31:05] wisdom amen I'm sorry verse 9 gives us
[31:09] wisdom to understand this woman and then
[31:12] also stay away from all that she does
[31:14] heavenly father Lord we bow our heads
[31:16] Lord oh I lift my head to heaven I lift
[31:18] my eyes Lord my hands to heaven Lord as
[31:22] Solomon did so many years ago when he
[31:23] dedicated the temple the Bible said he
[31:25] lifted his hands to heaven Oh God and he
[31:28] called upon the Living God and so I do
[31:30] the same I'm not dedicating a church
[31:32] today but I'm dedicating my life afresh
[31:35] Oh God every day I want to lift my hands
[31:37] lift up holy a of the Saint Paul said
[31:39] and dedicate myself to you for this
[31:42] service Lord every service is crucial
[31:44] every meal we eat is crucial Lord God as
[31:47] as we take care of our temples dear God
[31:49] so Lord speak to us today and father
[31:51] help us to understand Lord and have
[31:53] wisdom as the scripture says that we
[31:56] might fully be a part of the true church
[31:58] the true Bride of Christ not
[32:01] false bride or this false church that we
[32:03] read about here the Lord it's in Holy
[32:05] Writ for a reason and the Lord it was so
[32:07] deceptive that John didn't know what he
[32:10] was surprised by it because the church
[32:12] looks so holy looks so beautiful but
[32:14] Lord inwardly full Lord of wicked things
[32:17] Lord God a cage of unclean and hateful
[32:19] bird
[32:20] so father I pray administer here now to
[32:22] us today bless our brother for pressing
[32:25] out Lord be with those livestreaming
[32:28] dear Jesus may your Holy Spirit minister
[32:30] to each person in Jesus Christ's name
[32:32] and the church said Amen god bless yous
[32:35] bein seated here praise the Lord
[32:37] so like to look to a few thoughts here
[32:41] some of them I mentioned briefly but I
[32:45] like to spend a little more time on them
[32:46] tonight I don't have any slides I'm
[32:49] sorry to have time this week on a real
[32:50] busy week so I'm in the chapter that I
[32:55] wrote on this and I think I'll just hit
[32:57] the highlights because it's really long
[32:58] but I think I always wanted the
[33:00] highlights now there's a lot of reasons
[33:04] to read this of course to know who the
[33:06] false woman is the false church to stay
[33:09] away from her
[33:10] but as you study the false one you also
[33:13] get a better idea the true one now
[33:15] thankfully since the reason we're here
[33:17] that shows we already know a lot about
[33:19] the true church thank God for that we
[33:21] believe we're a part of it praise God
[33:23] Christ called us out of the world out of
[33:27] Egypt as we saw on Sunday out of Egypt
[33:29] by the prophet of God which we believed
[33:31] to be brother Branham for this day it
[33:33] brought his messages brought us through
[33:35] sanctification and and into the matches
[33:38] of the Holy Ghost into the promised land
[33:40] and now we're fighting off those seven
[33:41] demons a menace of seven countries that
[33:45] had to be driven out by God's grace
[33:47] we're driving them out yeah that's what
[33:52] I think will be a great help in this
[33:55] upcoming book because will cover the
[33:57] will cover the Bride of Christ before we
[33:59] cover this false one and so brother and
[34:01] says if you want to know a false dollar
[34:03] study the real dollar
[34:04] so in the book we'll be able to study
[34:06] the true dollar first and then the the
[34:11] the the false church should be so
[34:13] obvious I think
[34:14] is for us that's why we're here but
[34:15] hopefully would be so obvious to those
[34:17] who've never thought about it before
[34:18] that they'll be able to quickly see I
[34:20] can't be a part of false I got to be a
[34:22] part of the true that's what we like to
[34:24] experience now I want to just review a
[34:29] few scriptures here so we take heed
[34:33] because our danger our danger for us as
[34:37] we said probably isn't rule we'll go
[34:39] back and join a denomination
[34:40] that's not our danger the danger for us
[34:43] is that if if we stay at church and we
[34:45] don't continue on with God as we saw on
[34:47] Sunday with the sights riverman that
[34:49] we'd either camp out at the we camp out
[34:53] at I'm sorry the Jordan River and not go
[34:57] in the promised land or fall back away
[34:59] like Judas that's the danger for us if
[35:01] we started on the road we got to make
[35:03] sure we continue into the Promised Land
[35:06] now if we get in the promised land we'll
[35:08] never leave the Promised Land in it but
[35:10] I'm talking about overall as a church we
[35:12] don't want to leave anybody behind right
[35:14] in the military they don't leave anybody
[35:16] behind the Marines leave nobody behind I
[35:18] believe it's the Marines if I'm not
[35:19] mistaken leave no man behind is that
[35:22] right merica he reads a lot on the world
[35:24] war two he would know better and I would
[35:25] so we leave no man behind and as a
[35:28] pastor that's my burden I want to see
[35:29] everybody that's probably your burden
[35:31] too with the church the local church to
[35:33] see everybody fully into the promised
[35:36] land into the things of God you see
[35:38] fruits of God pouring out of their lives
[35:40] you see gifts of God work in their lives
[35:42] that's what we want to see we don't
[35:43] leave anybody behind
[35:44] so that scripture as I was prepared and
[35:47] came to my heart take heed so that the
[35:50] words there so let's go to Hebrews 3:12
[35:52] I just want to take a few scriptures
[35:54] here and look at taking heed to our
[35:59] lives so
[36:04] Hebrews 3:12 yeah that's right I'd like
[36:12] to read that here the Bible said take
[36:15] heed brethren lest there be in any of
[36:17] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[36:19] departing from the Living God that's a
[36:21] beautiful picture there a true picture
[36:23] rather of Judas of course which is that
[36:26] beautiful but maybe sad
[36:27] yeah the evil heart of unbelief and he
[36:29] departed from the Living God Judas is
[36:32] the one that left the Last Supper the
[36:35] Lord's Supper he's the one that left
[36:38] Jesus invited there Jesus we don't want
[36:41] him to stay there but Jesus knew he had
[36:43] to go do what he had to do he was free
[36:45] destined to do that but take heed we
[36:48] want to take heed go to Luke 21 please
[36:52] verse 34 Jesus foretells Jerusalem's
[36:55] destruction and some of his last words
[36:58] here were take heed to yourselves so
[37:00] Luke 21
[37:07] now this take heat is an interesting
[37:09] definition it means to hold the mind
[37:13] towards pay attention be cautious about
[37:16] apply yourself so be very cautious so
[37:21] when Jesus says is he's saying look at
[37:23] yourselves right so Luke 21 34 take heed
[37:27] to yourself that's why I church is such
[37:30] a wonderful thing right we come here now
[37:32] we said on Sunday you know we come here
[37:34] to consider one another but part of the
[37:36] time too so as we're considering others
[37:38] we also would look real close at our
[37:40] lives I need to see well how did I act
[37:42] this morning you know how did I how did
[37:44] I act this week did I treat everybody at
[37:46] work the right way did I say anything
[37:47] wrong about anybody I say anything wrong
[37:49] about any of the children you know too
[37:50] we need to look at our lives real
[37:53] closely because Jesus said take heed to
[37:55] yourselves lest at any time your hearts
[37:57] be overcharged with surfeiting or
[38:00] surfeiting now in the Greek that means
[38:04] like a headache from drunkenness so be
[38:08] careful your heart doesn't get a
[38:10] hangover I'll say like that like you're
[38:13] so people get so drunk Adan the things
[38:15] of the world they get a hangover
[38:17] right towards this things of God is what
[38:19] I'm talking about right
[38:21] like like tomorrow night they'll get so
[38:23] drunk on the NBA Finals or is it the
[38:26] Stanley Cup tomorrow which one is it
[38:28] though they'll get so drunk on that that
[38:30] when it comes to God it's like they got
[38:32] a headache towards the things of God I
[38:33] can't even think about that who could
[38:35] think about that we're so interest about
[38:37] who's gonna win the big Stanley Cup you
[38:39] know like and they're gonna they're all
[38:41] gonna kiss that with their dirty lips
[38:42] and you know are gonna take it you know
[38:44] to all around the world where they go
[38:45] and it's all got the fingerprints on it
[38:47] and it's jus German fest but to them
[38:51] they think that big Cup is is something
[38:53] so valuable but in God's eyes it's only
[38:55] gonna burn Paul says don't labor for the
[38:59] things that are corruptible he said run
[39:01] for the things that are incorruptible
[39:02] amen and the world loves to give out
[39:05] they love to have their own award
[39:06] ceremonies and that so ridiculous those
[39:08] movie stars they have well we'll just
[39:10] put on our own award ceremony we'll
[39:12] honor each other you know oh it's so
[39:14] prideful it's so ridiculous I've even
[39:17] seen churches in the last few years that
[39:19] have started their own award ceremonies
[39:21] not message but I've seen Church of
[39:23] Christ Church some of my former friends
[39:25] that they have now award ceremonies
[39:27] every year of who's doing the most for
[39:30] the kingdom of God a church can you
[39:32] could you even imagine that you know
[39:34] like who's really progressing in the
[39:36] city or or who's really doing a great
[39:38] job on social media for Jesus you know
[39:39] Awards like that the Bible you know the
[39:42] Bible said we ought not to exalt one
[39:44] another we are not to flatter one
[39:45] another but the Bible said we ought to
[39:48] live for the honor of God not the honor
[39:51] of men right oh it's so sad isn't that
[39:55] crazy
[39:56] that's what that's what people see see
[39:59] but what those denominations are doing
[40:01] they're looking at the award shows of
[40:02] the world because they love their movies
[40:04] and music and they want to try to copy
[40:06] it so they get all dressed up and and
[40:08] the women you know half-naked still even
[40:10] in the church ceremonies you know
[40:12] showing off their clothes and their body
[40:14] parts and things like that and trying to
[40:16] claim that's the true church well I Got
[40:17] News for you that's the false church
[40:19] amen
[40:19] that ain't the true church but see there
[40:24] hi there heart scan over charged with
[40:26] drunk with drunkenness they have a
[40:28] hangover in their heart because they're
[40:30] so drunken on the things of the world
[40:32] when they comes as the real reality of
[40:34] God's Word
[40:34] oh how could you that's what they told
[40:36] me those same brothers that did that the
[40:37] Church of Christ the same once told me
[40:39] all he's brother Ram is a false prophet
[40:41] the same ones and now look where we are
[40:43] all these years later you know we're how
[40:45] many years since I graduated 15 years
[40:49] and one of us as one side well they got
[40:53] their denomination there they got their
[40:55] hipster movement there they still speak
[40:57] in tongues but they got their award
[40:59] ceremonies and they got women to preach
[41:01] and Here I am I'm over here in a small
[41:04] little church like this but I'm
[41:06] preaching God's Word amen amen
[41:09] those small and despised and rejected
[41:11] not despised from heaven amen hallelujah
[41:14] I think sometimes I think that brother
[41:16] and I think all right let's just take a
[41:18] look back and see 15 years later where
[41:20] we at and some of my friends that were a
[41:22] part of those churches or have divorces
[41:24] now because of adulteries yet they could
[41:27] speak in tongues a mile a minute I never
[41:30] could speak in tongues so sometimes I
[41:32] look back and say well God which side
[41:34] are you on
[41:34] and we know God's on our side because we
[41:37] got the word amen
[41:38] and they said brother Branham was an
[41:40] antichrist sir all these things that
[41:41] look where they are now look where we
[41:44] are more in love with Jesus amen we're
[41:46] thankful for the prophet we've got him
[41:48] in his position
[41:50] we're not exalted in him we thank God
[41:52] he's a higher position than all of us
[41:53] because he's one of the seven stars of
[41:54] God but we don't worship Him we worship
[41:57] the one whose hand he's in amen glory so
[42:02] see that's just giving you a simple
[42:05] example and yet they speak in tongues
[42:08] and miracles and that's wonderful thank
[42:10] God for that if it's of God many times
[42:13] we don't know cuz Satan could
[42:14] impersonate a lot of that but you look
[42:17] at their lives you look at their stand
[42:19] on the Word of God and we're standing
[42:21] with a true Church by the Word of God
[42:23] hey hey man and see the cares of this
[42:27] life and so that day come upon you
[42:30] unawares so see me Jesus saying take
[42:33] heed so that the rapture the tribulation
[42:36] doesn't come upon you and your
[42:38] unaware of it oh we're in a wonderful
[42:40] spot tonight church aren't we
[42:41] we're in a great spot tonight because
[42:43] we're fulfilling what Hebrews 3:12 and
[42:46] Luke 21 34 we're taking heed to
[42:49] ourselves amen
[42:53] and say we say Lord let my heart not be
[42:56] evil let me have a good heart
[42:59] the Bible says that I don't that I
[43:01] depart from the world and that I unite
[43:03] with Christ we don't when depart from
[43:06] God with the evil heart we want to draw
[43:09] near unite to God with a good heart
[43:11] that's why we're here tonight praise God
[43:14] the matter the number no matter the
[43:15] Searchers circumstances situation you
[43:18] know our financial situation even our
[43:20] physical health situation no matter what
[43:23] those things say we come here to take
[43:25] heed to ourselves to exalt Jesus Christ
[43:27] in our lives
[43:28] amen now this is echoed I meant man
[43:31] there's so many scriptures it's kind of
[43:32] hard to - I just I guess I'll just read
[43:36] some before Paul left Ephesus in acts 20
[43:40] verse 28 he said take heed therefore
[43:42] unto yourselves what is he doing he's
[43:44] repeating the same thing jesus said and
[43:46] to all the flock over which the Holy
[43:48] Ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[43:50] the Church of God which is purchased
[43:53] with his own blood
[43:53] amen I had to run off we had Bible Club
[43:56] tonight at school and I had to run off
[43:57] and I said where are you going I said
[43:59] I'm going to preach God's food to God's
[44:01] sheep amen
[44:03] I'm going to God's eternal food to God's
[44:06] sheep hallelujah see that's so that's
[44:09] what that's what Paul said to do take
[44:11] heed to yourselves make sure you feed
[44:13] God's people the Word of God now go to
[44:19] Roman's 11 this is a good one that
[44:20] really struck me as powerful Romans 11
[44:25] 21 so this is in the chapter of Israel
[44:28] being blinded or another word is called
[44:31] grafted I'm sorry cut off from being
[44:34] we're grafted but Israel is cut off from
[44:36] the holy tree so imagine God is like a
[44:39] tree well Israel was one of those
[44:40] branches God cut it off and he grafted
[44:43] us in but look what he says here verse
[44:47] 20 I show start verse 20 well because of
[44:49] unbelief they were broken up and
[44:51] Stannis my faith be not high-minded but
[44:54] fear so see we never we never turn up
[44:56] our nose at Jews and run they rejected
[44:59] Jesus
[44:59] well we sorted all the Gentiles right
[45:01] are you with mixtures all the Gentiles
[45:04] never you know they all stood by Pilate
[45:07] and all the Roman centurions and they
[45:08] they helped Jesus right so which means
[45:11] everybody would have crucified Jesus
[45:13] I remember Isaiah 53 said all we like
[45:16] sheep have scattered right all of us
[45:19] would have did that but is right all
[45:22] that time and so God said fine I'm
[45:24] giving enough time I'm going to the
[45:26] Gentiles there'll be a Gentile people
[45:28] that we receive me in other words I
[45:29] don't have mercy on the Gentiles that
[45:31] some Gentiles be saved amen I've saved
[45:34] all these Jews before the Messiah but
[45:37] now says they rejected I'll turn to the
[45:39] Gentiles
[45:39] I'll give them a chance to be grafted
[45:41] into the life of God so don't be
[45:45] high-minded I call or so much better
[45:47] than those people in Jerusalem you know
[45:49] no no he said fear for if God spared not
[45:53] the natural branches take heed lest he
[45:55] also spare not thee you have to remember
[45:59] that we have to take heed to ourselves
[46:01] that God doesn't get fed up with us
[46:03] right we've got to make sure we live a
[46:04] godly life so God as they find I'm
[46:07] cutting you off we'll go back to the
[46:08] Jews I thought that was pretty powerful
[46:11] there yeah that's just a beautiful
[46:16] chapter I remember I preached on that
[46:17] one time when we preached on that entire
[46:19] chapter now this is for preachers but
[46:22] 1st Corinthians 3:11 said I'm sorry 3:10
[46:26] says but let every man take heed how he
[46:29] buildeth thereupon that's that's my
[46:31] desire I'm you something you know I try
[46:33] to be very careful what I build upon
[46:34] Paul's foundation so I'm worth the very
[46:37] top like I'm if I'm a real preacher at
[46:39] the end time that I'm like finishing the
[46:41] very top of this building now I want to
[46:44] make sure I build it upon paul's
[46:45] foundation Jesus Christ the chief
[46:47] Cornerstone right but I want to build on
[46:50] and Paul said take heed how you build
[46:51] upon it that's why even like Sunday was
[46:54] such a revelation Judas was genuinely
[46:56] justified he was genuinely sanctified
[46:58] and that's something that God had to
[47:00] correct in my ministry I never really
[47:01] believed that I always thought it was
[47:03] just pretend and you know cuz there's
[47:04] one
[47:05] we're brother and says that but the Word
[47:07] of God said they were sanctified and
[47:09] then they turned it and tried it out
[47:11] underfoot they stomped upon it now 1st
[47:15] Corinthians 8:9 is important for all of
[47:17] us but take heed lest by any means this
[47:20] Liberty of yours become a
[47:21] stumbling-block to them that are weak so
[47:22] we got to be careful what we eat careful
[47:24] what we consider holy days can careful
[47:28] about what we drink right because those
[47:30] are the the main things Paul lists here
[47:33] be careful that our Liberty don't become
[47:35] a stumbling block now I'll be honest I
[47:41] can't really think of any times where
[47:43] any liberties of mine have some of
[47:45] people because I don't drink wine at
[47:48] home I'm gonna drink wine at church I
[47:51] can't think of you know any holy days I
[47:53] can't think of any time where I've
[47:54] stumbled somebody if I have Lord to
[47:57] please show me you remind me so I can
[47:59] get that right I can't think of any time
[48:02] like a Liberty like that I think oh yeah
[48:05] I think the main Liberty brother Aaron I
[48:07] think I'm you we were here when I
[48:08] preached it was some of the things we do
[48:10] for Christmas how we worship at
[48:11] Christmas time I think that's the only
[48:13] real Liberty that might cause somebody
[48:14] you know cuz we just do gifts but I
[48:17] don't think there's anything wrong with
[48:19] what we do but it's the only thing
[48:22] that's may come in question as a
[48:24] stumbling block to people but no one's
[48:26] ever came to tell me that it stumbled
[48:28] them and caused them to sin right
[48:31] because I thought the only way that I
[48:32] could cause somebody's sin is if they
[48:34] saw a well the pastor buys gifts and
[48:36] then so foolishly they would go out and
[48:38] spend like ten thousand dollars on gifts
[48:40] and then blame it on me you know that
[48:41] mean the only way I think that they
[48:43] could blame me for something like that
[48:45] but that's just my experience with
[48:47] taking heed to myself that it don't
[48:50] cause somebody to stumble alright I'll
[48:54] go to first Corinthians 10 this is a
[48:55] good scripture here a lot of these
[48:58] things are gonna with the Catholic
[49:00] Church and Babylon are gonna be familiar
[49:02] these are more kind like refreshers so
[49:05] let's point them out so we can see them
[49:09] now this is a beaut
[49:11] chapter my first Corinthians 10 how I'd
[49:12] like to preach is the series on this
[49:14] book so verse 7 he tells us not to be
[49:20] idolaters because that's what Israel was
[49:23] verse 8 tells not to commit fornication
[49:26] 23,000 died there after Balaam and Balak
[49:28] invited them which brother ram typed to
[49:32] Constantine and the the councils where
[49:36] they adopted the Trinity verse 9 let us
[49:39] not tempt Christ verse 10 let us not
[49:45] murmur that's when we got to be real
[49:46] careful right make sure we don't
[49:48] complain
[49:48] we don't wanna complain against other
[49:50] people don't we definitely want to
[49:52] complain against God or God's servants
[49:55] or anyone laity anyone we don't want
[49:57] because we're all God's servants amen we
[49:59] all do something for the kingdom of God
[50:01] but we don't want to complain now verse
[50:05] 11 now all these things happen to them
[50:06] for and samples and they're written for
[50:09] our admonition upon whom the ends of the
[50:11] world are come so see even 2,000 years
[50:13] ago Paul's like this to the end of the
[50:14] world see there's just two days right in
[50:16] God's mind a thousand years in two
[50:19] thousand years it's the last the last
[50:21] days the last two days and so it is the
[50:24] ends of the world
[50:25] verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh
[50:27] he standeth take heed lest he fall there
[50:31] hath no temptation taken you such as is
[50:33] common to man but God is faithful who
[50:36] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[50:38] that you're able but will with the
[50:40] temptation also make a way of escape or
[50:42] to escape that you may be able to bear
[50:45] it
[50:46] wherefore my dearly beloved flee from
[50:48] idolatry I speak as to why and judge ye
[50:53] what I say Amen one thing I love about
[50:57] verse 13 it doesn't say I'm faithful it
[51:00] says God is faithful amen God is the
[51:03] faithful one and in every trial God's
[51:06] faithfulness won't be won't reject me
[51:09] and allowed to be such a hard trial that
[51:11] I can't overcome whether it's our
[51:13] financial temptation or a lust
[51:15] temptation or an anger temptation or a
[51:18] depression temptation he'll never let it
[51:21] be so hard that I can't get the victory
[51:23] because he's faithful amen
[51:25] now let's go - let's start with now back
[51:29] to revelation 17 verse 9 there's quite a
[51:32] few more take heeds there's about four
[51:35] or five I couldn't get to but let's just
[51:36] let's just get here now - this thought
[51:39] on wisdom now preaches a few months ago
[51:42] I think how wisdom is the only
[51:44] requirement to recognize this woman
[51:47] now can I just say like this well then
[51:49] how important is wisdom
[51:51] if wisdom is the only thing that's
[51:53] required how important is that I mean
[51:55] it's huge right it's huge
[51:57] so first crime sorry so revelation 17 9
[52:01] and here's the mind which hath wisdom
[52:04] the seven heads are seven mountains on
[52:06] which the woman sitteth now if you got
[52:11] your Bible go to Revelation 13 let's
[52:13] just read that one reminder revelation
[52:15] 13:8 so to recognize her physical
[52:19] headquarters and then her number it
[52:22] takes one thing wisdom so let's read 18
[52:27] here's wisdom but him that hath
[52:29] understanding count the number of the
[52:30] beast for it is the number of a man and
[52:32] his number is six hundred threescore and
[52:34] six all right now let's go to proverbs
[52:38] here I want to just recall this
[52:41] scripture proverbs 4 proverbs 4
[53:01] now I want to get to verse 7 that's
[53:04] where I want to emphasize now we preach
[53:08] on the book of Proverbs all about I
[53:10] think what two summers it was a last
[53:12] summer yeah there's been last summer
[53:15] that's right yeah all the tremendous
[53:20] nuggets here in the air is such a
[53:22] blessing let's go to verse 5 yeah let's
[53:25] go to verse 5 get wisdom get
[53:28] understanding forget it not neither
[53:30] decline from the words of my mouth
[53:34] forsake her not and she shall preserve
[53:36] thee love her and she shall keep thee
[53:39] wisdom is the principal thing therefore
[53:44] get wisdom and with all thy getting get
[53:48] understanding
[53:49] praise God now we know there's a
[53:52] different kind of there's a little bit
[53:54] different anointings of wisdom right
[53:56] because we know the foolish version will
[53:58] have at least an anointing of
[54:00] sanctification and wisdom where they'll
[54:03] recognize the mother harlot and they'll
[54:07] have to be martyrs in the tribulation
[54:08] right
[54:09] they'll have such level of that but
[54:12] remember the Holy Ghost field Christian
[54:13] has wisdom as well a greater portion of
[54:16] wisdom amen much greater portion and so
[54:21] wisdom is the principal thing so wisdom
[54:24] is actually a person right the Bible
[54:28] said Christ is the wisdom of God how we
[54:30] know that so let's go there
[54:32] 1st Corinthians 3 I believe I'm going
[54:35] off a memory because I was studying on
[54:36] this Saturday yeah 1st Corinthians 3
[54:54] let me I need to find the verse real
[55:02] quick I'm sorry first Corinthians 1 I'm
[55:05] sorry Church sorry I thought was 3 1
[55:08] verse 24 so the beautiful thing is we
[55:13] never have to wonder like his wisdom
[55:15] something separate outside that outside
[55:19] of the Spirit of God that have to define
[55:21] or or seek after and we should seek
[55:24] after it but all wisdom is is an
[55:26] attribute of the Holy Spirit a man just
[55:29] like faith and virtue knowledge that's
[55:31] always the mizzen here's the scripture
[55:33] to prove it to you right here verse
[55:35] verse 23 first Corinthians 1:23 for we
[55:39] preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a
[55:42] stumbling-block and unto the Greeks
[55:43] foolishness but unto them which are
[55:45] called both Jews and Greeks Christ the
[55:48] power of God and what is he the wisdom
[55:51] of God amen
[55:52] so see some people say well if you're
[55:54] preaching wisdom if you're preaching
[55:55] about wisdom that's not really preaching
[55:57] the Holy Ghost well yeah you are because
[55:59] Christ is both the power of God and the
[56:01] wisdom of God amen
[56:03] praise God so some services will preach
[56:06] against sin and will preach against
[56:07] demons and we had a number two people
[56:09] that got delivered from demons couple
[56:11] weeks ago preach the power of God to
[56:15] rebuke those spirits and drive those
[56:17] demons back in the name of Jesus and
[56:18] they they do go back amen thank God for
[56:22] that power but also that spirit is to
[56:26] give us wisdom and wisdom is skillful
[56:28] living so this the wisdom of God will
[56:32] recognize that woman sits on seven hills
[56:35] the false church and her Pope's got a
[56:38] number of 666 right bakari's fill a day
[56:42] so the wisdom of God will direct us to
[56:46] that skillful decision-making so I make
[56:49] the decision of mine that I see that
[56:51] decision the woman sits on seven hills
[56:53] Rome sits on seven hills I can see that
[56:56] I can put those together and so because
[56:59] of that I'll get as far away from
[57:01] Catholicism and an organization as
[57:04] possible even
[57:07] even if it I'll sit like this which a
[57:10] lot of people have been willing to do
[57:11] but even if it divides my house or
[57:13] divides my marriage I'll take the wisdom
[57:16] of God will tell me to stand with a true
[57:17] Church of God amen
[57:20] we've seen some people come out and get
[57:21] a victory we said other people's fall
[57:23] away because they're scared to lose a
[57:25] relationship or that I know it's hard or
[57:28] scared to lose a friendship or something
[57:29] like that but the real wisdom of God
[57:31] will guide you to choose Christ and
[57:34] forsake everything else that's wisdom
[57:36] amen wears them to know well I've got
[57:40] this trouble my house am I gonna
[57:41] compromise or not in fact I was talking
[57:44] to one of my high school friends on
[57:45] texting a few months ago and I said sir
[57:50] why don't you go to this there's a
[57:51] message church in his hometown and we
[57:52] were good friends you know growing up I
[57:53] said why don't you go to this message
[57:55] Church in your hometown
[57:56] he said well which is my wife and my
[57:59] wife gets so mad when we talk about it
[58:01] my children get so mad you know because
[58:03] they visited the message church but they
[58:04] can't fight live it and I said sir I
[58:07] said my friend his name is Chris I said
[58:10] Chris if your wife gets mad the wisdom
[58:16] of God says a soft answer turns away
[58:18] wrath is that right so see that's wisdom
[58:22] when you get in those situations where
[58:24] someone's really really mad you've got
[58:26] to come across gentle loving sincere and
[58:31] when the children get mad I don't want
[58:33] to go there there but they are they are
[58:35] holy rock the music's too loud you got
[58:37] to come across humble well don't you
[58:40] like you like loud music when you go to
[58:42] the school band concert don't you I mean
[58:45] don't they
[58:45] of course we like loud music on your
[58:48] video game which he probably lets young
[58:49] products and play video game you see so
[58:52] you need the wisdom of God to bring a
[58:55] different angle to bring a thought to
[58:58] try to discern that spirit praise God
[59:01] that's the wisdom of God and wisdom
[59:05] isn't like a secondary thing the Bible
[59:08] said wisdom is the principal thing amen
[59:12] see our daily lives we must choose to
[59:15] walk and wisdom and not as fool's
[59:17] we must redeem the time
[59:20] Church its redeeming the time listen to
[59:22] a sermon redeeming the time thank God
[59:24] amen
[59:25] and I thought about that whole listen to
[59:27] sermon in the home
[59:29] that's I've thought about in the end
[59:30] here too that's the wisdom of God and
[59:32] the wise virgins God so I hope that's
[59:38] proven to you that wisdom is not a
[59:41] secondary thing it's not any less than
[59:43] preaching in the power of God and
[59:45] healing the sick and and praying for
[59:47] americo's is not a secondary thing it's
[59:49] an equal thing because Christ is both
[59:52] the power of God and the wisdom of God
[59:53] he also says in verse 30 30 yep 30 so I
[1:00:01] was gonna say 31 was 30 but of him are
[1:00:04] ye in Christ Jesus who of God has made
[1:00:06] unto us what does he made unto us wisdom
[1:00:08] Wow and that beautiful so children when
[1:00:11] you use the wisdom of God and you're
[1:00:13] like let's say you're at a fellowship
[1:00:14] and someone's joking around or saying
[1:00:16] dirty things or saying things are
[1:00:18] teasing other people when you change the
[1:00:20] subject that's the wisdom of God you
[1:00:24] could say wow that's Christ in me right
[1:00:26] cuz Christ is the wisdom of God he's
[1:00:30] made unto us wisdom so when you make the
[1:00:33] right decision and instead of speaking
[1:00:36] mad about somebody you speak something
[1:00:37] good about somebody or you change the
[1:00:39] subject
[1:00:39] right there Christ has been made unto
[1:00:42] you wisdom you can say wow this wisdom
[1:00:47] just manifested in my life in other
[1:00:49] words I see the anointing of Jesus
[1:00:50] Christ in my life amen oh that's
[1:00:54] beautiful
[1:00:55] glory and he's made what he's made your
[1:00:59] righteousness and sanctification and
[1:01:01] read so the wisdom of God is just it's a
[1:01:05] pump the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:08] remember you could always pray for more
[1:01:10] because the Bible said add the Bible
[1:01:12] said grow so you know we have a
[1:01:14] scripture we're survivors and growing
[1:01:15] Grace and the knowledge and the wisdom
[1:01:17] of Revelation
[1:01:18] oh god give me more wisdom to walk the
[1:01:20] right way praise God
[1:01:28] okay now if you got your Bible there
[1:01:30] let's go to James 1 now this is a
[1:01:35] thought I kind of mentioned in passing
[1:01:37] but I I think I'll just take a few
[1:01:38] minutes here I'm gonna set my timer here
[1:01:42] and just go a little slower over this
[1:01:46] Jesus makes it so plain to recognize
[1:01:51] Mystery Babylon that only a fool would
[1:01:55] err in salvation and be lost only a fool
[1:01:57] would be lost it's it's so it's so easy
[1:01:59] to see he makes it so easy the only
[1:02:03] requirement is wisdom you have to ask
[1:02:05] for his wisdom James 1:5 now God you got
[1:02:08] that buddy can you read it for me hey
[1:02:20] man thank you
[1:02:21] now we're liberally in the Greek it
[1:02:23] means simply openly frankly sincerely
[1:02:28] like if you ask God say God what do I do
[1:02:31] I need the wisdom of God he's gonna tell
[1:02:33] you openly but many times we missed it
[1:02:35] because it's behind somebody's bad your
[1:02:38] skin that we don't want to maybe talk to
[1:02:39] her listen to or maybe it's just playing
[1:02:42] the word and we don't catch it or we're
[1:02:44] not prayed up like we ought to but the
[1:02:46] Bible said God gives it liberally Frank
[1:02:50] I'll be really frank really sincere this
[1:02:53] is what you need to do so all that God
[1:02:56] requires in exchange for his wisdom is a
[1:03:00] selfless prayer someone who just one has
[1:03:04] the right motive god I want to please
[1:03:05] you but how many people do we know that
[1:03:08] have Catholic friends and they know the
[1:03:10] truth or we share the truth with them
[1:03:12] but they don't want to hurt somebody's
[1:03:14] feelings and so they they won't even ask
[1:03:16] God you know I'm not even gonna touch
[1:03:18] the Catholic stuff because I don't want
[1:03:20] to hurt people's feelings but that's the
[1:03:22] wrong attitude the wrong the right
[1:03:25] attitude to say God just tell me
[1:03:27] sincerely so I can find the right path
[1:03:29] in life and not be so afraid of hurting
[1:03:33] people's feelings but be more afraid of
[1:03:35] the Living God amen yes amen yeah
[1:03:41] that's right and that's the wisdom of
[1:03:45] God from Proverbs it's uh-oh
[1:03:50] especially you know us since we know so
[1:03:53] much we need to pray for more of that
[1:03:54] God give me more open doors and you know
[1:03:56] what the same thing Paul needed boldness
[1:03:58] bonus same thing Paul needed he said
[1:04:01] pray for me that I can be both in acts 4
[1:04:04] they said God send us the Holy Ghost a
[1:04:06] refilling so we can be more bold again
[1:04:08] let me just stop and say this to when we
[1:04:12] pray for a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:13] we're not praying to be sealed again
[1:04:15] because the Bible never says you can be
[1:04:17] reseal with the Holy Ghost we are
[1:04:19] praying for our minds to be transformed
[1:04:22] our minds to be totally washed out our
[1:04:24] minds to be totally surrendered and our
[1:04:26] minds to be fully committed to the Word
[1:04:28] of God amen
[1:04:29] I've heard people preach it lately or
[1:04:31] maybe seems like you can be sealed again
[1:04:33] you can't be sealed again you're sealed
[1:04:36] one time to the day of your Redemption
[1:04:38] amen but the refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:41] is God cleaning out your mind getting
[1:04:43] all your desires cleaned out so that you
[1:04:45] all you want to do is what God wants you
[1:04:47] to do and you do the works of your first
[1:04:49] love hey man
[1:04:51] Gouri hallelujah whoo wasn't somebody
[1:04:56] somebody came up for prayer I don't
[1:04:58] remember where it was maybe I was over
[1:05:00] in Toledo or Michigan where somebody
[1:05:03] came up and and oh yeah I was at
[1:05:05] Michigan and I said they asked the to
[1:05:08] get right with that for refilling of the
[1:05:09] Holy Ghost and that's what I told him I
[1:05:10] said your soul is already sealed the
[1:05:13] trouble is you have worldly desires that
[1:05:16] are clogging up your mind your spirit
[1:05:18] and when I said this she bowed her head
[1:05:22] and started crying I said think about I
[1:05:24] said you're a mother you can have your
[1:05:27] first love back I said but what were the
[1:05:30] works you first did when you first got
[1:05:33] the Holy Ghost and she put her head down
[1:05:34] and started crying kind of like the
[1:05:35] tears of joy
[1:05:37] because it set her free she realized you
[1:05:41] don't need another seal the Holy Ghost
[1:05:42] all's you gotta do is do what you first
[1:05:45] did when you said you got the Holy Ghost
[1:05:47] amen
[1:05:47] that's all you got to do is go back and
[1:05:50] act like that do those things and you
[1:05:53] will find your first love see because
[1:05:55] when you do
[1:05:55] that you don't do the sin or you don't
[1:05:58] do the laziness right you're taking heed
[1:06:01] to your life you're looking at your
[1:06:02] spiritual life and you're doing exactly
[1:06:04] what you did at the beginning you got
[1:06:06] your first love back and your refill
[1:06:08] with the Holy Ghost amen but it's not
[1:06:11] it's not another seal me again Lord seal
[1:06:13] me again
[1:06:14] well then how long does the seal last
[1:06:15] then I mean it lasts into the day of
[1:06:18] your Redemption I beg glory forgive me
[1:06:21] I'm going to spit in preachers tonight
[1:06:23] you see but the Bible never said in your
[1:06:26] seal to the next revival to the day you
[1:06:28] get a new body amen
[1:06:30] bori I think there's a great confusion
[1:06:33] about that in the message because
[1:06:35] brother Branham says you know brother
[1:06:37] branham's not confused but people are
[1:06:38] confused but the RAM says the rapture
[1:06:41] will take a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:43] well that doesn't mean we're going to be
[1:06:44] sealed again it just means we got to get
[1:06:46] our minds clear of all the nonsense all
[1:06:48] the doubts all the fear anything that's
[1:06:51] kind of any cobwebs that have kind of
[1:06:53] grown in our minds you know we're
[1:06:55] spiritual cobwebs wherever you have it
[1:06:57] little doubts or little frustrations or
[1:06:59] guilts all that just needs to be washed
[1:07:01] away all cleaned out you know all the
[1:07:03] desires cleaned up and do the first
[1:07:05] works and act like a real Holy Ghost
[1:07:07] filled sate thank the Lord amen so how
[1:07:14] do you get wisdom just ask God with the
[1:07:17] right motive and God will frankly say
[1:07:20] yes it's the Roman Catholic Church have
[1:07:24] nothing to do with denominations God
[1:07:26] will just frankly say that you need to
[1:07:28] find a new church oh how could I find a
[1:07:30] new church is there any churches how can
[1:07:32] I leave my church well you just say
[1:07:34] goodbye you're not your you're not
[1:07:35] standing with the word I'm gonna go find
[1:07:37] somebody that can stand with the word
[1:07:38] with that's how you do it
[1:07:41] now you use respect right you use
[1:07:43] respect when you look when we leave that
[1:07:45] other churches you know we try to leave
[1:07:47] with respect then ama national churches
[1:07:50] you know but God will frankly openly
[1:07:55] tell us what we need to do if we ask for
[1:07:57] is Anna isn't that a great blessing like
[1:08:00] you know some of the brothers will be
[1:08:01] praying for their job situation or you
[1:08:03] know marriage situations or you know big
[1:08:06] major decisions Church situations
[1:08:09] and the Bible said if we just ask God
[1:08:12] will give it to us liberally all right
[1:08:15] what a blessing so if God so easily
[1:08:18] gives this wisdom then that means people
[1:08:22] are praying with lustful desire so go to
[1:08:25] James 4:3 and I did mention this but I
[1:08:29] want to go slope through it so you can
[1:08:30] catch it and I think it'll be helpful
[1:08:33] why no would be helpful because it's
[1:08:35] God's working James for three
[1:08:39] now these are fighting churches Peter
[1:08:41] James is riding the Fighting Christian
[1:08:44] churches and the message of their day
[1:08:45] and they're having fights and wars among
[1:08:47] them because they're praying the wrong
[1:08:49] prayers verse 1 says from whence come
[1:08:55] Wars and Fighting's among you come not
[1:08:57] they not hence even of your lusts that
[1:08:59] war in your members you lust and have
[1:09:01] not you kill and desire to have and
[1:09:03] cannot obtain you fight in war yet you
[1:09:06] have not because you ask not you ask
[1:09:08] every see not because you ask amiss that
[1:09:10] you may consume it upon your lusts so
[1:09:13] this proves right here most people that
[1:09:15] won't recognize that I'm talking about
[1:09:16] not us people that won't recognize the
[1:09:19] Roman Catholic Church as mother harlot
[1:09:20] most of their prayers are selfish
[1:09:23] prayers that they're at they're just
[1:09:26] asking for their lusts Oh God give us a
[1:09:29] financial blessing so we can have a big
[1:09:30] Christmas with big kind of gifts
[1:09:32] Oh God you know help me to be help me to
[1:09:36] get some more raises so I can have a
[1:09:38] bigger house and bigger bigger
[1:09:40] everything like that they're just asking
[1:09:42] for the wrong thing help our church to
[1:09:45] get bigger so you know we can build a
[1:09:47] bigger building you know they just want
[1:09:50] it's just all selfish and they never
[1:09:54] take time just say a simple prayer God
[1:09:56] can you tell me what real the real
[1:09:58] church is they'd rather not know so then
[1:10:02] they don't hurt anybody's feelings
[1:10:04] they'd rather not know but see most
[1:10:08] church members cuz most you'll be saved
[1:10:11] right most church members pray selfish
[1:10:13] prayers they only asked for their lusts
[1:10:17] God give me more food God give me better
[1:10:20] job God give me more money God give me a
[1:10:22] beautiful
[1:10:23] husband getting beautiful or handsome
[1:10:25] husband beautiful wife
[1:10:26] give me beautiful children they're just
[1:10:29] asking for selfish things rather than
[1:10:31] saying God let your will be done not by
[1:10:34] well amen how many people do you hear
[1:10:36] pray that Amen Mary for you they just
[1:10:39] want the biggest church and the most
[1:10:40] amount of money and all they're less and
[1:10:42] they just want an easy life let me find
[1:10:45] that quote brother BAM said our biggest
[1:10:49] battle are a soft living I believe he
[1:10:52] called it let me look it up real quick
[1:10:54] and over the wrong I mean it's hard
[1:10:56] sometimes when you go through tough
[1:10:57] times but brother have said the great
[1:10:59] burden of our last age is the pressure
[1:11:03] of riches I'll need to make more money
[1:11:05] oh you need to be a rich man
[1:11:07] oh that's a pressure right we face right
[1:11:09] why aren't you making more money it's
[1:11:11] your fault brother Jesse you should be
[1:11:14] making more money that's one of the
[1:11:16] pressures but man so the second one is
[1:11:19] soft living oh you're working too hard
[1:11:22] for Christ you need to slow down you
[1:11:25] seem to take care of your future save
[1:11:28] thyself listen to those those the
[1:11:32] Lamplighter books are really good the
[1:11:34] Satan's always like save yourself don't
[1:11:36] worry about other people's saviors and
[1:11:37] you can always tell that's the devil I
[1:11:40] like that well that's that's that's hey
[1:11:45] say get out here get thee behind me soft
[1:11:48] living you need an easier life you're
[1:11:52] trying to do too much for god oh god
[1:11:55] help me to do more for you her today not
[1:11:58] not not that I you know get sicker now
[1:12:00] that I hurt myself but it helped me Lord
[1:12:03] to do more help me to be a light to more
[1:12:06] people praise God
[1:12:07] and the third one bromance ed is nervous
[1:12:10] tensions scenes trying to get you
[1:12:12] nervous oh you better not do that oh you
[1:12:15] better not be too bold better not preach
[1:12:19] too hard about that so this all goes
[1:12:23] together pressure of riches soft living
[1:12:25] and nervous tensions and those are the
[1:12:30] three hardest battles program says that
[1:12:32] we battle in Laodicea how many kids Amen
[1:12:37] see that's why we need the fire of God
[1:12:39] right we can't be lukewarm can't be cold
[1:12:41] we got out of the fire of God so the
[1:12:43] fire of God will help us to reject the
[1:12:45] pressure I'm not living under the
[1:12:46] pressure I don't have any pressure my
[1:12:48] riches are in heaven amen
[1:12:50] yes I need to pay the bills but I'm not
[1:12:53] pressured about that because my riches
[1:12:55] are in heaven my paydays in heaven and
[1:12:59] soft living lot I can be a rugged
[1:13:01] Christian nobody's got to Pat me on the
[1:13:03] back er nobody's got to beg me to come
[1:13:05] to church or anything like that I'm not
[1:13:07] a soft pushover or hotbed plant I'm a
[1:13:10] rugged believer amen
[1:13:11] a nervous tension I'm not gonna let
[1:13:14] these cares of the world I could care
[1:13:16] less about these things what I'll care
[1:13:18] about is the kingdom of God
[1:13:20] I've set my affection on things above
[1:13:21] amen see that's that's that's what the
[1:13:24] fire of God does takes away the pressure
[1:13:27] takes away makes us be rugged living
[1:13:30] Christians a nervous tension I always
[1:13:33] thinking brother Simon when I think of
[1:13:34] soft living Simon works hard Simon works
[1:13:38] hard and then he studies on top of that
[1:13:39] and then he'll drive here one time for
[1:13:42] the air I got sick like with the
[1:13:44] Wednesday and I called him up Wednesday
[1:13:46] afternoon I said I'm sick at work can
[1:13:48] you come preach and he came right he he
[1:13:51] got off at four o'clock he drove home
[1:13:53] and got his suit and tie and rose right
[1:13:55] over here to preach the gospel I thought
[1:13:57] that I'm trying to get him to come out
[1:13:58] again he hasn't gotten back to me I gave
[1:14:00] him some dates so just thought you know
[1:14:02] I'm trying to have him come out for us
[1:14:03] but he just and then he'll stay up on
[1:14:06] the hill preach and then drive home two
[1:14:08] and a half hours get home like 12:00
[1:14:10] 1:00 2:00 and get up at you know seven
[1:14:12] or six or seven to go work and you know
[1:14:15] now he's got to sleep a lot on Saturday
[1:14:16] to make up for that like he's not
[1:14:18] superhuman but I'm talking about we got
[1:14:21] to be willing to make sacrifices and if
[1:14:23] life is very soft well then so be it
[1:14:25] we'll catch up later
[1:14:26] let's do something for the kingdom of
[1:14:27] God amen like tonight hey man just like
[1:14:30] tonight driving an hour and a half or me
[1:14:33] I woke up at you know 5:00 a.m. and
[1:14:35] worked all day and preached even preach
[1:14:38] today and Bible clubs this is my second
[1:14:39] sermon today but it's I really live soft
[1:14:42] we want to live the way God wants us to
[1:14:45] live and God will give us seasons to
[1:14:47] relax and rest later
[1:14:48] Jesus had seasons he went
[1:14:50] to pray we know that so God would give
[1:14:52] us our seasons too now so all that's
[1:15:02] required as an honest prayer and say God
[1:15:04] show me the true church
[1:15:06] give me your wisdom to see which church
[1:15:09] this on seven hills which Church has 666
[1:15:12] in it can you imagine it that's all they
[1:15:16] have to do to ask for their and that's
[1:15:18] all jay-z has to do that's all Tom
[1:15:22] Cruise has to do it goes the Church of
[1:15:24] Scientology where they believe in all
[1:15:26] kinds of nonsense
[1:15:27] mind over matter and all kinds of things
[1:15:29] like that that's all
[1:15:34] Mormons have to do they just say God
[1:15:36] give me wisdom to see these things and
[1:15:39] God would turn him away from the false
[1:15:41] prophet Joseph Smith to the real prophet
[1:15:43] William Branham right and I gave a
[1:15:47] Mormon friend of mine my book and
[1:15:48] brother branham's in the back hopefully
[1:15:50] he said he started reading it he goes to
[1:15:52] Taekwondo hopefully he'll read it and
[1:15:54] see that in the back we don't have much
[1:15:55] time to talk you know but Lord willing
[1:15:57] God will open up some doors I hope so
[1:16:02] all right now can everybody see that the
[1:16:06] wizard require all that's required
[1:16:07] Church is a prayer just a simple prayer
[1:16:15] he says wisdom is the principle
[1:16:17] thing therefore get wisdom so another in
[1:16:20] other words to get wisdom you gotta get
[1:16:21] praying right get wisdom well how do you
[1:16:26] get wisdom ask that's my brother Graham
[1:16:28] said the foolish version will be left
[1:16:30] behind and the wise will say go pray up
[1:16:34] see they were just praying for their
[1:16:35] needs God give me this God give me this
[1:16:37] I need this said I don't need to pay the
[1:16:38] bills I need a new car I need new tires
[1:16:40] you know I did that's good you know you
[1:16:43] got to have that but they didn't pray
[1:16:45] the right thing the right thing is God
[1:16:47] give me with them to know the false
[1:16:50] Church the true church give me wisdom to
[1:16:52] get born again amen show me the areas I
[1:16:55] need to die out so I couldn't be born
[1:16:57] again and be a true believer army now
[1:17:04] let me close with this thought I'll just
[1:17:05] close to this up this is a new thought I
[1:17:08] never preached this before about Babylon
[1:17:14] so the confusion around Babylon who this
[1:17:20] woman is it centers around her identity
[1:17:25] let me look I'm sorry let me look so no
[1:17:27] Brooklyn Jenna thought here yeah okay
[1:17:36] here's all right yeah so who is
[1:17:46] identity here not goodness I just I died
[1:17:52] i typed in seven hills oh my goodness
[1:17:55] there's uh many many cities that are
[1:17:57] built on seven hills in Africa there's
[1:18:00] four in the Americas al new New York out
[1:18:06] Albany New York Athens Texas there's one
[1:18:09] three four
[1:18:10] Cincinnati's built on seven hills did
[1:18:12] you know that uh I forgot I forgot about
[1:18:15] this new in Massachusetts there's
[1:18:17] probably there's probably 20 cities in
[1:18:20] America built on seven hills Yonkers New
[1:18:23] York New York Asia has three four five
[1:18:28] Mecca six seven eight nine ten Asia has
[1:18:31] ten cities built on seven hills Europe
[1:18:34] Oh Grafton's Greece's bill I didn't know
[1:18:37] that could be on seven hills these four
[1:18:39] five six okay that's what I got thirty
[1:18:41] or forty mercy okay so the last point I
[1:18:44] want to close with is that thought the
[1:18:48] confusion who is this woman now that
[1:18:51] might be shocking to you but there's
[1:18:53] probably a list of about fifty to
[1:18:54] seventy five cities that are built on
[1:18:56] seven hills so the wisdom of God would
[1:19:01] say okay this woman is built on seven
[1:19:04] hills now once you find out why there's
[1:19:07] about 50 to 75 cities on seven hills
[1:19:09] then what would the next step of wisdom
[1:19:11] be would it be to just give up or with
[1:19:13] the net with the wisdom of God tell you
[1:19:15] you got to dig a little hard dig a
[1:19:17] little deeper see what's the wisdom of
[1:19:20] God gonna tell you children dig a little
[1:19:22] deeper so if you type in so anybody
[1:19:24] today that didn't didn't know who's a
[1:19:25] mystery babylon city on seven hills look
[1:19:29] at Wikipedia would tell them fifty
[1:19:31] different cities so you got to go one by
[1:19:33] one and see which one it is
[1:19:35] oh my thank god yeah
[1:19:39] keep reading and church there's along
[1:19:42] with that one there's eleven so there's
[1:19:44] there's there's eleven proofs that this
[1:19:48] woman is the Roman Catholic Church now
[1:19:52] brothers and sisters this second
[1:19:55] runner-up the closest one your some of
[1:19:58] the similar ones that might be kind of
[1:20:00] close
[1:20:01] you'd say maybe New York cuz New York
[1:20:02] seems like it has a great financial
[1:20:05] headquarters right I mean huge millions
[1:20:09] of people live there a lot of rats there
[1:20:11] though a lot of not of cockroaches from
[1:20:14] what I've heard I know it's a dirty city
[1:20:17] I've been there a couple of times I
[1:20:18] never really stayed long though just
[1:20:19] preached there twice so some some not
[1:20:23] the runner up but some honorable mention
[1:20:26] or maybe New York Mecca Saudi Arabia
[1:20:29] right because that's where a lot of
[1:20:31] Muslims go so some people that think
[1:20:34] Mystery Babylon is you know the the
[1:20:36] Church of Islam that might be a runner
[1:20:39] up and Saudi Arabians are very rich
[1:20:41] because of oil all these cities that
[1:20:47] could fit it now to me those are the
[1:20:49] only two that could even get close maybe
[1:20:51] Athens Greece but that's so it's such a
[1:20:54] minor city anymore now so those are the
[1:21:00] honorable mention but the runner up who
[1:21:02] knows who the runner up is Jerusalem
[1:21:05] Jerusalem is built on seven hills how
[1:21:09] many knew that it's Mount Scopus Mount
[1:21:13] Olivet Mount of corruption nah-ah fell
[1:21:18] Mount Zion old Zion new Mount Zion and
[1:21:22] the hill on which the Antonia fortress
[1:21:25] was built Jerusalem was built on seven
[1:21:28] hills now this is pretty striking this
[1:21:31] is pretty good because I didn't know
[1:21:33] that till I started writing this book
[1:21:34] I'm like well I wonder what the other
[1:21:35] ones are and I saw a video of a man that
[1:21:37] says I think it might be how in the
[1:21:40] world is gruesome sit on seven hills and
[1:21:42] it does and it makes sense you know with
[1:21:45] Zion and different Olivet you know
[1:21:46] different we've all heard of these hills
[1:21:50] so let's take the last few minutes let's
[1:21:53] take about 10 minutes and go over this
[1:21:54] and show how Jerusalem is a pretty good
[1:21:57] runner up but Mystery Babylon is not
[1:21:59] Jerusalem the Roman Catholic Church is
[1:22:02] Jerusalem and again this is not an
[1:22:05] attack on Roman Catholics I'm many
[1:22:07] friends that are Roman Catholics good
[1:22:09] people but it's not an attack
[1:22:13] it's a call for God's people to come out
[1:22:15] of her my people that they be not
[1:22:17] partakers of her sins and her plagues
[1:22:21] the Catholic Church upholds the
[1:22:24] doctrines of devils the Bible says which
[1:22:27] are don't eat meats and don't marry
[1:22:28] right don't let the priest marry and
[1:22:31] look at all the sexual corruption that's
[1:22:32] caused and what I think the saddest part
[1:22:38] church is that the Bible said she makes
[1:22:42] merchandise of the souls of men did you
[1:22:44] know that you remember that from
[1:22:45] Scripture let's go to Revelation 18 13
[1:22:50] so literally literally numbers to
[1:22:54] Catholic churches are only money its
[1:22:57] merchandise to them now there may be a
[1:23:00] good hearted priests the kind old
[1:23:02] priests can I say like there may be a
[1:23:04] good kind of are two priests um
[1:23:05] somewhere around you know maybe a few
[1:23:07] left but to most of them Church now this
[1:23:10] is striking
[1:23:11] most of them those numbers they're those
[1:23:13] souls are just merchandise all the money
[1:23:17] the money's gonna pour in and they give
[1:23:20] them the wafer open your mouth you know
[1:23:23] I'll put the wafer on your tongue Oh
[1:23:26] drink of this wine most of them it's
[1:23:29] just numbers they're not even sheep it's
[1:23:31] just like machines or numbers to them
[1:23:32] because that's what the Bible says look
[1:23:34] at this and cinnamon odors pointment
[1:23:37] frankincense oil wine oil fine flour
[1:23:39] wheat B sheep horses chariots slaves and
[1:23:43] souls of men Liddy go to the previous
[1:23:46] verse I think it's 12 yeah
[1:23:50] the merchandise so the mert lists all
[1:23:52] these type of merchandise and the last
[1:23:54] one it lists are souls of men to them
[1:23:57] people are just exchangeable right just
[1:24:01] like merchandise come and go that's why
[1:24:03] those priests abused those boys because
[1:24:05] those boys don't mean nothing them and
[1:24:06] they never apologize they never repent
[1:24:09] why because it's just numbers there's
[1:24:10] just money to them
[1:24:11] they don't see him as God's sheep
[1:24:14] they've been see him as gods those
[1:24:16] belong to God doesn't belong to them
[1:24:18] they're God's and if anybody was that
[1:24:21] ever special to you and you recognize
[1:24:23] that a child was of God who treated with
[1:24:25] godly respected
[1:24:27] and you'd honor that child whether it's
[1:24:29] a boy or girl you'd honor every child of
[1:24:31] God because they're God's sheep they're
[1:24:33] God's children and you know they don't
[1:24:34] belong to you they belong to God amen
[1:24:37] but to this church the souls of men are
[1:24:41] merchandise well if this person leaves
[1:24:45] my church fine go ahead they can go to
[1:24:47] another church we'll just get more
[1:24:48] people to come in we'll just have a
[1:24:50] which I have a bake sale we'll get more
[1:24:52] people to come in we just have a big
[1:24:54] Vacation Bible School will get a lot of
[1:24:55] people to come in here we'll build a gym
[1:24:57] so then their kids will want to come to
[1:24:59] our gym and then we'll then we'll have
[1:25:01] more people come to our church always
[1:25:02] which a lot of Catholics do they just
[1:25:04] build schools right private schools see
[1:25:08] how the money making thing and they got
[1:25:10] to pay that money for the private school
[1:25:13] its merchandise souls have become
[1:25:17] merchandise so Jerusalem is the closest
[1:25:22] Jerusalem is the runner-up now here's
[1:25:28] why because now we don't have time to
[1:25:31] get there but I'm just gonna read them
[1:25:32] so if you want to read them later
[1:25:33] write down or go back to listen this
[1:25:35] sermon on YouTube because Jerusalem is
[1:25:38] on seven hills also she's called a
[1:25:41] harlot in Isaiah 121 do you know that
[1:25:45] that's really yeah cuz I put these up
[1:25:49] well I sure hope I looked them up
[1:25:50] because I'm gonna put them in print hope
[1:25:52] I don't make a mistake there Isaiah 121
[1:26:00] and I got one two three four five six
[1:26:04] seven others where she's called a harlot
[1:26:08] Isaiah 1:21 you right there can you read
[1:26:11] it right now see see why the wisdom of
[1:26:25] God is so important a lot of people
[1:26:27] believe it in fact that's what the
[1:26:28] brothers were saying on the video
[1:26:30] there's a big move to make Mystery
[1:26:32] Babylon Jerusalem now it used to be Rome
[1:26:35] everybody used to know was wrong
[1:26:36] but see they don't wanna hurt feelings
[1:26:38] there's our to move away but
[1:26:40] see how there could be kind of a little
[1:26:42] bit well I could see that two of them
[1:26:45] are clearer by history and by scripture
[1:26:49] she's called a harlot I got eight times
[1:26:51] Israel's a harlot the faithful City
[1:26:54] right she's a city who sits on seven
[1:26:56] hills a harlot City and see what's
[1:27:00] another one Jesus isn't been the Messiah
[1:27:03] in that another one makes it look like
[1:27:06] she's not the right Church right oh my
[1:27:11] goodness
[1:27:12] striking see how it could stumble people
[1:27:18] Jerusalem's also called the holy city my
[1:27:21] in Nehemiah 11:1 she's called a harlot a
[1:27:26] holy city because revelation 7 I'm sorry
[1:27:32] yeah okay so you see how they have a few
[1:27:38] similarities right oh here's another one
[1:27:41] who crucified all the prophets Jerusalem
[1:27:45] right Jesus said you're the ones who
[1:27:48] stone the prophets you've done it and
[1:27:50] then you bury up their bones and you
[1:27:52] know brother Graham said they did you
[1:27:53] repents later on so jesus said that no
[1:27:58] prophet can I think Jesus said no
[1:28:00] prophet could die outside of Jerusalem
[1:28:01] if I'm not mistaken I thought he said
[1:28:03] that there's that connection there to
[1:28:04] Jerusalem so it looks like Jerusalem is
[1:28:07] drunken with the blood of the Saints and
[1:28:09] not only the Saints the Son of God so
[1:28:13] see it can be quite a little bit
[1:28:14] confusing there but what were the Holy
[1:28:16] Spirit's how you do would it tell you
[1:28:18] just to cruise on that or tell you to
[1:28:20] dig deeper it keeps crying out God give
[1:28:24] me more wisdom over my eyes see because
[1:28:27] you got a hunger and thirst for
[1:28:28] righteousness and the Bible said you got
[1:28:32] to search the Scriptures every day
[1:28:34] whether these things be so a mess
[1:28:36] because the spirit searches the shallow
[1:28:39] things no the spirit searches the deep
[1:28:43] things yea the deep things of God so you
[1:28:47] know take you deeper than just one or
[1:28:49] two or three before right now we have
[1:28:50] four proofs but this mother harlot the
[1:28:53] real one Roman Catholic Church we gotta
[1:28:54] proofs for that I'm still searching for
[1:28:57] the fourth one by there and so you can
[1:28:58] help me without the one I want to know
[1:29:00] is how is how officially is Rome
[1:29:05] connected to all the businesses of the
[1:29:07] world like the finances now bang and I
[1:29:09] were talking about this and we were
[1:29:10] talking about how they might be
[1:29:12] connected to IMF which is an internet
[1:29:14] International Monetary Fund so the
[1:29:17] people that control the value of money
[1:29:20] they're all Catholics now they might be
[1:29:22] but I have to find proof of that so if
[1:29:24] you can find proof of that let me know I
[1:29:25] just haven't had a lot of time to dig
[1:29:27] into that one because member in
[1:29:29] Revelation 18 the cities being destroyed
[1:29:31] and all the rich people are saying
[1:29:33] they're you know they're ripping their
[1:29:34] garments like how is this happening how
[1:29:36] is this happening this is where we get
[1:29:37] all of our goods and our money go to the
[1:29:39] here now that that's the one thing I
[1:29:42] need to find more evidence on if you can
[1:29:44] help me out with that or anybody
[1:29:45] listening you know help me out with that
[1:29:48] because we know the Vatican has lots of
[1:29:51] gold we know that but how are they
[1:29:54] connected to cinnamon and wool and
[1:29:58] cotton and all those things I'd like to
[1:30:01] find some good proof on that so if you
[1:30:05] guys can find that if the brothers or
[1:30:07] sisters let me know that'd be a great
[1:30:08] help to me that would give me a 12th one
[1:30:10] but right now I can't really prove that
[1:30:13] by what I found in either dictionaries
[1:30:16] encyclopedias or books I need some more
[1:30:18] meat on that I need some I need some
[1:30:20] solid evidence all right so may God
[1:30:24] grant it because we won't we like to do
[1:30:26] that so let me finish up now here's the
[1:30:31] reasons why Israel cannot be wrong I'm
[1:30:36] sorry Israel cannot be the mother harlot
[1:30:38] first Israel does not sit upon many
[1:30:42] waters because met what are many waters
[1:30:46] they're people's multitudes nations and
[1:30:49] tongues listen this church I did
[1:30:51] research here there's only 11 million
[1:30:55] Jews in the world 11 million and 82
[1:30:59] percent of them live in Israel United
[1:31:01] States
[1:31:03] 80% of them live in Israel United States
[1:31:06] compare that to 1.3 billion Catholics
[1:31:13] billion right
[1:31:16] 11 million you need you need a how many
[1:31:22] millions do you need to get a billion
[1:31:25] 100 is it 100 or is it a thousand
[1:31:29] hundred okay so that's not even a it's a
[1:31:32] little over tenth
[1:31:34] there's no way most of them live in
[1:31:37] Israel and the United States
[1:31:40] not even close all around the world but
[1:31:42] the Roman Catholic Church is in nearly
[1:31:44] every nation on earth with over 1.3
[1:31:47] billion people that's the first thing
[1:31:52] where Israel Jerusalem cannot be the
[1:31:54] mother harlot because she doesn't sit on
[1:31:55] many Hills I'm sorry she doesn't hit on
[1:31:58] many waters she does sit on Seven Hills
[1:32:00] not so many waters second Jerusalem has
[1:32:02] never called Babylon of Scripture
[1:32:04] whereas Peter refers to Rome as Babylon
[1:32:08] in first Peter 5:13 did you know that
[1:32:12] first peter 5:13 let's read it
[1:32:14] we got a few minutes sir and all the sky
[1:32:22] I believe this I looked in the
[1:32:23] commentaries well at least all the godly
[1:32:25] scholars first Peter 5:13 oh you already
[1:32:32] got up there good you're fast the church
[1:32:33] that is at Babylon I'd like to get
[1:32:35] together with you salute you and so
[1:32:37] death Marcus much so now all the
[1:32:40] commentaries say he's writing to the
[1:32:42] church at Rome there this letter was
[1:32:44] going to go to Rome and so Peter caught
[1:32:46] a Babylon and that's something that the
[1:32:49] Catholic Church calls Peter than their
[1:32:50] first Pope and there he is calling Rome
[1:32:53] Babylon there supposedly their first
[1:32:55] Pope cause names them Babylon so their
[1:33:00] first Pope rats on them as Babylon
[1:33:02] that's basically what they're saying but
[1:33:04] we know Peter was no Pope Peter was a
[1:33:06] Holy Ghost filled apostle of Jesus
[1:33:09] Christ amen
[1:33:11] he wasn't some nonsense Pope all right
[1:33:15] now also Rome is the legs of iron or
[1:33:19] mattered modern Babylon like kingdom
[1:33:21] described in Daniel chapter 2 not
[1:33:24] Jerusalem because Jerusalem never ruled
[1:33:26] over the world okay Victoria honey
[1:33:29] Victoria you keep sit down darling
[1:33:33] please
[1:33:38] okay quitar to sit down Victoria sit
[1:33:41] down then thank you sweetie
[1:33:43] thank you
[1:33:49] God showed that to Daniel and God told
[1:33:53] Daniel that image is gonna come against
[1:33:55] the holy people amen glory so the legs
[1:33:59] of iron Babylon or battle on the head
[1:34:01] I'm sorry Babylon the head it was
[1:34:04] against Israel it wasn't Israel it
[1:34:06] wasn't Jerusalem it was against God
[1:34:08] Daniel's people praise God so see that's
[1:34:13] another proof third revelation 18 3
[1:34:17] requires Babylon have strong
[1:34:18] relationship to the kings of the earth
[1:34:20] and eyes with all nations but you and I
[1:34:23] know Israel is despite despised by
[1:34:26] almost every nation under heaven and
[1:34:28] this is what the internet says Israel
[1:34:32] suffers from bias and discrimination as
[1:34:34] United Nations you ever seen those
[1:34:35] videos and the world hates Israel
[1:34:40] everybody wants to give Palestine the
[1:34:42] Palestinians the holy man give it the
[1:34:44] pal give it to those murderers you know
[1:34:46] the jihad people give it to them don't
[1:34:48] give it to Israel so that's another
[1:34:51] proof that it can't be
[1:34:53] Israel mother Mystery Babylon can't be
[1:34:56] Israel because this Babylon church is
[1:34:59] tied to all the nations and you've seen
[1:35:04] it have you seen that picture where the
[1:35:05] benedict was kissing the cora remember
[1:35:07] that
[1:35:08] or was it John Pope John Paul the second
[1:35:10] one of them there's a picture where
[1:35:12] they're kissing or on now no true man of
[1:35:15] God would kiss that they'd burn that
[1:35:16] book hate to say that but that's the
[1:35:19] truth they wouldn't kiss that there you
[1:35:21] want you wouldn't bless that you would
[1:35:23] that that's a curse book they say Jesus
[1:35:26] Christ was not the Son of God he was
[1:35:28] only a prophet a curse it is any man
[1:35:31] that doesn't believe Jesus Christ is the
[1:35:33] son of God the Bible says that let that
[1:35:36] man me Ana Thema right
[1:35:38] let him be curse anybody who changes one
[1:35:41] word of Paul's gospel let him be cursed
[1:35:43] amen
[1:35:45] oh my so sad so every
[1:35:51] hates Israel United Nations but every
[1:35:53] nation there loves the Vatican and they
[1:35:55] have diplomats almost every nation under
[1:35:57] heaven we just saw it was so shocking
[1:36:00] last year it was so shocking China now
[1:36:03] recognizes Vatican diplomats as long as
[1:36:06] the diplomats can be Chinese see that I
[1:36:12] used to think how is it China ever gonna
[1:36:14] have
[1:36:15] Vatican diplomats they hate they hate
[1:36:17] Catholicism but now it's okay
[1:36:19] as long as they're Chinese see because
[1:36:23] they'll know they'll be ever change
[1:36:24] train them up in their china ways right
[1:36:25] there Chinese culture and so they'll
[1:36:30] adopt the China the Catholic things but
[1:36:32] they'll still keep their Chinese
[1:36:34] Allegiance
[1:36:35] in other words in other words they won't
[1:36:37] be real Catholics right they'll be fake
[1:36:40] Catholics ok next last one Mystery
[1:36:48] Babylon is I love this one this a good
[1:36:49] one
[1:36:50] Mystery Babylon is condemned in
[1:36:52] Revelation 1821 let's read that let me
[1:36:54] pull that up thank you sweetie
[1:36:56] revelation 18 21 with prophecy that
[1:37:00] shall never be found or rebuilt after
[1:37:02] God's wrath destroys look at this the
[1:37:04] bombs of the mighty angel the Gaston and
[1:37:06] like a great millstone in Kassadin see
[1:37:07] say thus with violence shall that great
[1:37:09] city Babylon be thrown down and shall be
[1:37:12] no more at all so once once Russia drops
[1:37:20] that bomb on her and then all these all
[1:37:24] these vials and plagues destroy the
[1:37:26] Vatican the Bible said shall be no more
[1:37:29] fountain at all but you know the
[1:37:33] scripture about Jerusalem amen
[1:37:36] Lori brother Erin she's fallen so many
[1:37:40] times her her stones have not been left
[1:37:43] one upon another but what does she do
[1:37:44] she keeps rising amen hallelujah
[1:37:47] and the Bible says that Jerusalem is
[1:37:52] going to be rebuilt will be a peaceful
[1:37:54] habitation and will be a future Kingdom
[1:37:57] in Isaiah 2 Jeremiah three and Isaiah 65
[1:38:01] amen
[1:38:01] how do you know you that
[1:38:04] mother hearted Roman Catholic Church
[1:38:05] Vatican will be destroyed and burped and
[1:38:08] will never be found again
[1:38:10] but God's holy city the City of God amen
[1:38:13] will rise again hallelujah and be built
[1:38:16] again hallelujah it will be the
[1:38:18] habitation of holiness and only those
[1:38:21] who are holy will ascend that holy
[1:38:23] mountain amen thank God in fact Jesus
[1:38:27] Christ will set up his Millennial throne
[1:38:30] in Jerusalem see this is before this is
[1:38:33] before the new city come I'm sorry the
[1:38:35] new heavens for the future home comes
[1:38:37] down in the Millennium for a thousand
[1:38:39] years Jesus Christ is going to set up a
[1:38:41] new Millennial temple in Jerusalem oh
[1:38:45] thank God
[1:38:47] and brother have said the last thing the
[1:38:49] sixth all purpose of Gabriel's purpose
[1:38:51] the last thing will be to anoint the
[1:38:54] most holy
[1:38:55] that holiest of Holies and what is that
[1:38:57] going to be it's going to be Jesus
[1:38:59] Christ sitting down on the throne Haven
[1:39:02] because he's the most holy and he's the
[1:39:04] anointing now we don't really need like
[1:39:08] a Shekinah the glory because we've got
[1:39:09] Jesus and he's the fullness of the
[1:39:12] Godhead bodily amen thank you Lord but

[1:39:26] no matter what happens in Armageddon
[1:39:28] when the fires burned and all these
[1:39:30] things no matter what happens
[1:39:32] God will rise Jerusalem back up and
[1:39:35] he'll set up a temple remember the Bible

[1:43:51] eyes they're still sinners because
[1:43:52] they're gonna betray Christ I like this
