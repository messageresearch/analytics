========================================

this damn we'll take our bibles here this morning by the grace of the lord hallelujah about to look at the names of god this morning i think i would kind of feel led to preach on that since it's father's day and we'll continue i've been studying on those so let me get my text i'd like to go to genesis 17 1 let's go there we'll start with el shaddai or else shady eyes brother ram says genesis 17 1. genesis 17 1. you're turning there again happy father's day uh after service make sure you see me all the dads i got some beef jerky for you so we got our sisters uh chocolates and flowers but you know some of those chocolates weren't so good so i got some extra beef jerky for the sisters too so it just worked out we didn't have as many dads come so we got some extra so mothers if you don't like that chocolate i got some good beef jerky for you today genesis 17 1. next year i got to remember the milk chocolate milk chocolate aren't you glad to serve the lord today we're just so happy to be a christian and be a representative of jesus christ on this earth what an absolute privilege so thankful for all god has done for us genesis 17 verse 1. let's read that together and then we'll read our memory verse from brother amen let's read this on three one two three and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect so the lord there is jehovah jehovah the self-existent one says i am el shaddai or i am el shaddai walk before me and be thou perfect so this is god revealing more of himself to abraham notice how a lot of these names were given to abraham as the father of the faith praise god god's starting a new thing a new covenant with abraham isaiah 41 verse 10. isaiah 41 10. we have nothing to fear because the father's here praise god let's read verse 10 1 2 3 fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart make a known unto the lord let's also pray for our fathers that aren't serving god that need to get right with god because we want to see them in heaven as well heavenly father we just come before you we thank you for this thy word lord you looked at abram and you told him who you were you were el shaddai hallelujah so lord your el shaddai to us today all that we have need of lord is we'll look to the scripture uh lord today your jehovah the self-existent one who keeps revealing himself you're the father that keeps showing us more about yourself dear god so lord as we come here this morning i want to say thank you for providing all you've given to us all you've revealed to us about your character we're so thankful but god we want to know you more yet we want more dear god more of your love more of your mercy more of your understanding more of your wisdom and your knowledge lord god more of your truth oh god the granite lord by the holy spirit today more of your power in our lives and father we ask a special prayer for our fathers that are in the house of god or aren't serving you lord i just pray you'd minister to them god bring them to repentance where they will hate their sin lord god they'll change their minds as well lord and they'll make amends for their sins bring them i pray o god to this place we ask for it lord god you told us this would be a house of prayer you said you'd hear any time someone called lord to your tabernacle which is now the name of the lord jesus christ where you place your name hallelujah you place it in christ hallelujah so in the name of jesus we just pray you save our fathers that are are not saved oh god the need to know you in the power of your resurrection the fellowship of your sufferings i pray you grant that and again bless our fathers here this morning in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so again we're grateful for our fathers and we're so thankful i guess today is actually mother's day too right every day is mother's day every day is christmas right every day you remember the birth of our lord so we're thankful for all god has done for us so let's uh look at it for a few minutes here i'll set my timer just to go about an hour we're a little long on the song service there so and then we have a baptism so i want to i want to be kind of cautious on the time there so you have enough time with your family for lunch and dinner and everything you got going on there uh tomorrow my wife and i celebrate 18 years of anniversary so we're so thankful for that uh 2003 2003 so 18 years so we're just grateful we'll probably just go out for a little lunch or something like that and just thank the lord for all those great memories so we just love the lord and god has done a great thing you know of course we dated or you know dated recorded for about uh five years before that so we've known each other quite a while here so and she's put up with me all these years can you believe that all these years that's a real saint right there no we thank the lord uh she has put up with me and thankful for all god's grace and mercy and brother jose do you have a anniversary this month as well it was may 3rd okay it was last month so i'm sorry but happy anniversary to you god bless you sir that's right we won't forget that [Laughter] brother yes sir i won't forget that by god's grace so we love you buddy love all the saints here god bless our fathers and so thankful for all they do so let's take a few scriptures here i'd like to you know just i'll just start with a little bit on father's day i do have some slides here so you can pull it up but before we get to the names of god let's just look at a few scriptures let's go let's start with proverbs 17 verse 6 i kind of do like a short little bible study on just some father scriptures that came to my heart as i was preparing you yesterday i was preparing i wasn't thinking anything about father's day i was really not on my radar it's not my that that holiday is not my responsibility so i don't have to worry about that one too much um anyways i just had a few thoughts about father's day this scripture has been uh really astounding to me proverbs 17 verse 6 and i don't have a slide for it that's okay so i'll just read it one time i had some gift cards to a christian bookstore you know sometimes the parents of my students give me gift cards i was looking for a new king james bible and i walked in there at a 50 gift card and i come across the bible and on the front it had this scripture proverbs 17 verse 6 and it's like the father's bible so i really like it it's still one of my favorite bibles i have at home it says children's children are the crown of old men right so the grandchildren are a crown for the fathers god bless our grandfathers amen there's your crown brother look at that beautiful crown there three jewels on that crowd and that beautiful jose how many grandchildren you got brother [Laughter] my mom and dad got 24 grandchildren so so that that's their crown but have you counted brother lately all you your parents grandchildren okay so you can do that while i'm preaching here then then you can tell me no i'm just kidding but you can if you want so it's a great crown you know our grandchildren and the glory of children are their fathers now that means ornament or honor so children have a extra dose of honor on them from their fathers and of course that's conditional right so however much they they dedicate to the lord their lives that much honor will be on their children praise god and so i just thought i'd share that you know that's what the bible had on the front as soon as i saw that i'm like oh it's like a leather black bible but it's got this brown strip down the middle like a ribbon and it said the glory of children are their fathers and i'm like as soon as i saw that i said that one's mine i knew it was in the king james section i just read it and it's been a great help to me that's where i got that picture of you know jordan a picture of jordan for joshua you know of the big river there that's kind of where i got that picture from uh so i just want to just express that to you that you know some of our fathers have been attacked by the enemy and may not have served god as well as we'd like them to be i mean i would i managed to imagine we'd have many hands go up if we asked this morning if we said how many wish their fathers would have served the lord you know we my hand would have went up first you know but uh but you know god is the great redeemer and ultimately it's the heavenly father who puts his glory on us because the bible said the mystery was hid from ages christ in you the hope of glory so even if our fathers maybe didn't have a heart to serve the lord or or you know were given over to the snares of the devil if we respond to the heavenly father's call then he puts a measure of glory on us praise god and then we as fathers right bang and jose and william and i we can pass on that blessing that god has given us we can pass on the blessing and wisdom the anointing on to them as well praise god because remember the fathers and brother bang we have to preach on this pretty soon the fathers can bless their children remember that right jacob did it you know abraham isaac fathers have such a power to bless their children so i want to preach on that sometime i did a little bit one time but i want to get under the anointing and pray for my children sometime and bless them with the blessings of god because they have such an ability of course mothers can do we know that right with rebecca really helping jacob a lot right remember because isaac liked esau more so god really anointed right uh a rebecca there to really bless jacob and favor him right and and point him in the right direction so we know mothers have a special place as well but we want to uh just remember that the glory of children are their fathers so you know when people we had somebody yesterday at the uh gas stations commented on my children and i said well all the credit goes to mother you know for that but you know like brother adam said you know give all the credit to my wife nida that's true but part you know but also there's a part the father plays no doubt as well right so fathers humbly say that but uh there's a special blessing that goes upon the children and they wear that so when someone compliments your children i'm speaking to the parents you can thank the lord for that that god has used you you've surrendered to god and god has allowed you to surrender and the blessings that are on your life have transferred actually over onto your children praise god the bible actually calls it translated when you're in christ you're translated into the kingdom of his dear son amen hallelujah the the kingdom is the rulership or the dominion so when you have dominion over satan and you have the power of the holy spirit and you teach your children the same that same power of dominion over satan goes on your children amen hallelujah i think about it even today think about you know i think about my life and if if we get to baptize victoria today think i think i have my children have been what age do you get baptized at malachi and lydia you remember okay should you remember the age you got baptized seven my point is that it's really a lot younger than me i i felt the pull at 16 i got baptized but felt it right away because i wasn't strong enough i wasn't as sincere as i should have been i think my if they're coming to the lord at five at seven i think karis was five if i'm not mistaken amen i think you were five or six or something like that and i think mine my prayers let the glory of god rest on them praise god my humble little devotion to the lord my my sincerity to try to serve him and and be his humble servant i just pray that this scripture that god fulfills the scripture because it's god's promise not mine right we can't give anybody anything but if we keep god's laws he keeps his promises and he blesses our children and the glory of god rests upon our children when we honor god amen that's the promise right uh we see the blessing of of of the father as he's serving god it goes to the children praise god now here's one i just want to say i this is the real uh reality of christianity so second corinthians 6 18. this is the real reality of how god is our father in christianity and i kind of labor on this in chapter six of the book and by the way is your turn there second corinthians 6 18. i read through the book one more time this week and there are there are 212 corrections i had to make it was quite a week uh but i submitted those yesterday and so the gentleman said i'll work on it this week hopefully i get the final version i'll read through it one more time to just check all those 212 corrections then hopefully it'll go to publishing after that so i'm looking forward to that by the grace of the lord uh but the point of chapter six was to share in the old testament god could walk with them right god could walk with adam in the garden god could walk you know with abram right he could visit abram but in the new testament because of the blood of jesus christ now god could walk in their very souls see with david he could walk in his mind for a while but then david would would uh cast so he'd offend the holy spirit and cast aside the anointing right but if we are born again then god the father is constantly walking in his children amen and what greater desire could a father have than to know that he's living inside of his children praise god his character his his legacy right his uh is very personality or say like that is life is inside the children amen 2 corinthians 6 18. now you know this is about not mixing unequally with sinners because christ has no fellowship with belial the devils verse 16 actually let's go to 6 16 and what agreement had the temple of god with idols for year the temple the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people so god living in your soul by the baptism of the holy ghost makes you a constant house of god it makes you a constant church amen i like coming to church but i also like knowing that i am the church amen so that means we can have church anywhere we are right wherever two or three are gathered there i am in the midst praise god verse 17 wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you this is new testament right that this is why so many so few people get born again because you've got to come out if you want the father live inside of you he said i've got to clean that out you have to separate yourself from all unbelief and then i'll dwell among you then i'll receive you right the prodigal had to leave the pig pen amen you had to leave your sins behind amen you had to leave that behind and you had to come back to the father's house right you had to come back to the father and the father will run to you receive you but he said separate yourself you know better than that you know the father loves you so return to the father amen verse 18 and i will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty see the father is so gracious god is so merciful he tells us we must separate ourselves from the things of the world then i'll receive you as a father so the prodigal is the perfect illustration right for becoming a christian the bible said you got to come to your he had to come to himself so that means he had to he had to have a transformed mind and realize i don't have to live like this i can be an overcomer and i can at least be a servant in my father's house in other words if i say like this i can at least be a foolish virgin right but the father said no you're coming back you're going to be the wise you're going to have the blessings you're going to have the oil you're going to have the ring a plate at the table you're going to have full sonship restored amen hallelujah thank god this is what god god almighty does now i want to look at paul's instruction to fathers just briefly and then i'll kind of move on to this thought about i just want to lay these thoughts in here so ephesians 6 4 if you could ephesians 6 4. you know i don't think uh brother brian hawkins would mind if i shared this but i'm just going to share it you know we were talking about father's the last time he was here preaching and i was saying you know i really admire your son david he's in the marines now right isn't the marines okay and uh you know and brother brian started crying he's like brother jesse said i appreciate that he said i just felt like i was too harsh on him like a drill sergeant i said well look at him he's in the military he must have needed a drill sergeant right and i said brother i said i said i'm the opposite of that maybe i'm a little too loose right and i want to be and what are we all trying to do we're all trying to find the balance right in the middle right we all want to find the middle of the road right like one time i talked to some brothers from africa i don't remember which brothers they were somebody who visited brother brooks's church but i said brother tell me about your family how do you run your family he said i get all my children up at 6 00 am and we pray and read the bible first and like i'm a drill sergeant i thought my and i started talking to my wife honey could we do that and she didn't you know i didn't think that was the right idea for our family and uh and so we've never gone that route i've never tried to wake them up too early uh but then you know but but uh we haven't taken that route but we've gone a little more slower you know get up you do your hair you know make the bed have breakfast then bible time so we do that you know uh yeah i was a brother that visited brother brooks church i can't remember his name he had a teenage son i can't remember his name either but anyways but you know either way you have to look at what the children become right because not all people are drill sergeants right not our people are relaxed and laid back brother bram calls him kind he said there's some that are dogmatic and nice and kind and he names all these different kinds of personalities he said but the main thing is to get christ in their souls the main thing is to point them to jesus christ i do want to say this we do want to seek the lord first and the children do get up and read their bibles first right that's we train the older ones to do that right there in their bed they just read their bible right there that's better than me because i gotta get out of the bed if i stay in the bed i'm gonna keep sleeping so i gotta get out of that bed i gotta go wake up wake up spray some water on there wake this guy up come on wake up fella wake up you'll get there you know then i gotta read my bible eventually but they could they can somehow do it right in their own bed so i thank the lord for that uh but i want to just lay this in here so ephesians 6 4 ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath so so there are going to be some fathers that are a little more strict like that and the bible says enrage enrage them not or bring them not to being enraged right uh but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord now that's discipline nurtures discipline so we have to discipline them but not to the point of their raging against us right i've had friends from high school that they just hated their dads because of their dads that would tease them or pull pranks on them make fun of them embarrass them publicly that's really how you enrage somebody right is embarrass them the bible said we're supposed to honor especially the weaker vessels right doesn't the bible say that not speaking of the wife but what about the children they're weaker vessels too so fathers especially i've never i've never tried to tease my children if i did god forgive me i've never tried to tease them i never want to embarrass them i want to bring them up in the discipline of the lord but not make them enraged right i don't know have i ever yelled at the home children yet have i ever raised my voice yet lydia's shaking no she wouldn't know she's been around the longest i try not to you know but i could i could and still be loving because it's still a form of nurturing right and admonition is uh instruction and correction so fathers have to tell the children when they're wrong of course mothers do a great job of that too but this is what paul specifically tells them the main thing is don't enrage them you've got to discipline them uh but not enrage them in other words don't purposely hurt them okay so go to colossians now very similar cautions 321 i read that this morning i've been reading through colossians now yeah i finished my old bible that father's bible i finished it's all highlighted all the way through and i bought a new scofield bible and i just thought i'd start on colossians because i want to preach on that eventually we read we preached the galatians the ephesians philippians i want to preach colossians caution's 321 nope it's not 321 it's no it is 321 yeah it is i'm sorry i was looking at 221 sorry now don't forget 20 now children well i might as well 19 fathers husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them so somehow satan knew i'm sorry somehow satan was trying to make the fathers bitter against their wives in colosse so god had to anoint paul with the holy spirit love your wives don't be bitter against them right children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord let's not leave out the children right father's got to correct but children have to obey verse 21 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged that means disheartened spiritless in other words after you correct them show them love show them that you love them right that will raise their spirits or like me the next week take them out take them out to eat or something like that i like to take them out to eat that's kind of how i like to show love you know they all made me uh father's day cards this morning and almost everyone i love you they can thanks for giving me ice cream and all these things maybe i'll give them too much sugar i don't think my wife would say that i hope not that's just funny what they remember you know about daddy but but see we don't want to discourage them we want them to have courage right to have heart and hope and have a spirit but we got to correct them at the same time in other words i got gotta correct your son or daughter but you gotta try again you can do it try again obey next time don't disobey obey okay so i just wanna start with those and let me just say this before i move over to my names of god i just want to say this to all of our our our children fathers want to be strong fathers want to love any honest father would want to but that's the battle they're fighting fathers want to be heroic leaders right they want to provide everything they want to do the best they can they can't always do that because sometimes they fall short of god's glory but fathers want to do it like last week i was going through my uh my file cabinet i've been trying to declutter i'll never get to a minimalistic lifestyle i watch all those videos on youtube i'll never get to that i'm just i'm just not built that way like they have nothing on their desk and i'm like how do you do that but i was going through my papers and i found a letter my dad wrote to me when he moved to tennessee like right when i started college he went down there for a couple years and built a little house and but he sent me a letter and it just oh always kept it all these years it's probably been oh 20 years now maybe 21 years and he said he said and he ended the letter by saying i love you i just wish i could have been a better dad to you and so i know although my father hasn't been there and he's left us and i know he would like to be a better father there's something in every father that wants to be a good father but sometimes we fall short of god's glory but we have to remember that god allows these things to happen so that we if we've been hurt we can manifest love and we can manifest forgiveness praise god because that's the greatest expression of god's love for his great love wherewith he loved us he hath quickened us who were dead in sins praise god and raised us up together to sit with christ in heavenly places amen the greatest expression of god's love is his salvation which is why his name above all names is jehovah the self-existent one is salvation so just know that if your father has been absent or if he's been disobedient to god know that he wants to do right he just has not received the power to do it so it's our job my job your job to pray for them until they can amen and if it comes on their deathbed we'll rejoice in that let's pray for that let's pray for that that if it comes to that we'll have that opportunity to say that to them praise god brother bram said he had many death bed confessions many people he led to the lord at their death beds so if we don't see it right soon away we've been praying all these years let's keep praying perhaps it'll have to be at the death bed but even then the precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints amen he told that thief on the cross today you'll be with me in paradise he didn't deserve it but he brought him anyway because of repentance the great expression of god's love and the church said all right so let's look at the names of god here our father now i bolded these as we preached on them okay i'm bolding them so we can see where we're going today uh we looked at the primary names and we looked at jehovah names i got a few more jehovah names because i told you the reason i never preached it was because one time i started studying and i saw all these jehovah names in scripture and so what i meant not scripture actually what i meant was in the hebrew lexicon so i'm going to talk about that today as well well we know schofield taught seven compound names i was listening to brother ramsey's sermon on that from 1955 he just takes it right out of scope field uh and he gave a lot of testimonies how god was provider healer all these beautiful testimonies savior now there could be more names uh since schofield gave an eighth so because remember go back on that scofield gave us an eighth one didn't i have another slide up there or not yeah so see scofield says there's seven but it's interesting he gives us an eighth why would he give us an eight i don't know because he taught so that's why i don't know he taught seven but then he gave us an eighth just interesting it's not really a doctrinal thing let's just review these again briefly to abraham god was jehovah jireh the lord will provide has he been yours to moses he was jehovah rapha he told israel i am the lord thy god that healeth thee is he your healer today to moses he was jehovah nesi the lord is my banner the lord is my flag the lord is being waved over me praise god right hallelujah he's jehovah shalom to get in the lord is my peace remember he's the he's the piece of a fearful man remember that this is this is still before he defeated the many united he was peace when you don't see the the works of god amen remember he said if god be for us where be all the miracles and then the angel showed up and said god is our peace amen i'm a valiant man although i don't see it right i'm a mighty conqueror i'm a mighty warrior although i don't see it but god is my peace amen i'm going to choose to live in peace before i see all the promises of god come to pass jehovah shalom the lord is peace jehovah rai to david the lord is my shepherd has he guided you all your life church jehovah tiscanu to jeremiah the lord our righteousness praise god and then jehovah shama to ezekiel the lord is present and the church said amen now jehovah sabayoth of course means the lord of hosts the lord of angel armies amen hallelujah he's our banner and also he's the army praise god amen the banner is what all the enemy would see right the enemy would see that banner waving praise god and so he's our banner and he's the army praise god now more i put a question mark uh what did i do this is the same one okay so let's look at the compound names of l here now the first one is el shaddai now if you look just in the hebrew it means almighty that's why when he revealed he revealed himself to abraham he said i am the almighty god right god was l right which stands for the strong one and then shaddai was almighty almighty god praise god the strong almighty sounds like a little repetitious right the strong one who's almighty right and most powerful that's the first appearance now remember genesis 17 was a critical spot let me go back there that's a critical spot in moses's walk with the lord brother branham brings it out uh as the breasted one which we'll look at in just a moment here remember this is after in genesis 17 this is after abram had fallen uh with hagar right he let sarah talk him into it and then he gets an ishmael the wild man which they're still battling today right they're still battling them today shooting uh missiles at them and i know there's a little cease-fire oh i heard a little article there's a cease-fire but that's so hamas can can buy up more missiles they use up all their missiles that's the only reason they want to have a ceasefire i tell you what the prayers of the righteous are very powerful and effective praise god the lord makes their their ammunition run out praise god amen and now abrahams 99. and there's no sign he's going to have an ish or an isaac yet there's no sign so god said i am el shaddai you're 99 abraham ebc he said don't forget i am the strong almighty he said walk before me perfect church don't be discouraged just walk before the lord perfect all the days of your life amen if god promised you anything he's going to keep his word praise god when it doesn't seem like it when it seems impossible don't forget he's el shaddai he's the strong almighty one he knows how to bring his word to pass his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than ours amen much higher praise god he has a better plan for our lives amen see i would have chosen my mom and dad to get reunited many years ago and i would have chosen all these different things but god has a time and season for everything praise god and as i said before i don't even know i don't even have enough said the lord god's going to bring my parents back together i'm just hoping but my hope is in the lord amen my hope is in the el shaddai the strong one praise god someone who believed that god will give me the desire of my heart praise god you don't have to but i'm going to believe it and confess it i'm going to call those things not as though they are now that's the difference with abraham church abraham could do that because he had thus saith the lord we don't always have thus saith the lord but i still like to call things that are not as though they are because i believe there's life in the power of the tongue praise god i say like this it just encourages me to say it praise god because satan has every every attack every device to try to discourage us to make us doubt god's word and i want to have faith i want to be strong in the lord and the power of his might praise god and church there's nothing more powerful than the word of god upon your lips amen jesus said the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life we have life on our tongues when we say thank you god you're el shaddai you're the almighty strong one you'll provide amen you will do what you promised although i'm 99 although the years passed by swiftly and it doesn't seem like it's going to happen i know it will happen amen because you promise it and you're an all time god i love this god reveals himself i'm el shaddai i'm revealing this remember it was abraham after isaac they said oh you're jehovah jireh that was from kind of like his revelation but here god said you need to remember i'm el shaddai i'm revealing myself amen the self-existent one who reveals himself i'm revealing myself as a strong almighty one even at 99 i can change your body although it's dead i can make it alive amen hallelujah i seen an article a few weeks ago there was a woman i think in her 80s who gave birth to a baby was it 80 she's got like white hair all these wrinkles and she's holding a baby i thought my isn't that a i should have saved it i didn't think about it i could probably look for and find it you saw it yeah she's got a she's holding this little baby she's all hunched over and your wrinkles and gray hair i'm like look at this modern day sarah our god can do anything praise god i mean it still happens now i just want to share this because i'm a little uncertain uh scofield says shady i comes from or the word shad means breast now it does the word shad means breast in the hebrew but when you click on shady i or should i it doesn't link to that word okay so when i search the hebrew lexicon i can't find the breasted one just letting you know but scofield was a hebrew he knew hebrew so i just i'll just trust him i could be wrong but either way it doesn't matter church i couldn't find the breasted one but either way abraham needed the strong one to be most powerful to give him 99 years old to give a baby give life so he could bring forth isaac praise god and whether he's whether that's el shaddai the blessed one or not god's word he still lived from the word of god and god bless his efforts amen now should i so shady i or should i means most powerful when you click on it in the hebrew lexicon so that's what i'm saying there's a little bit of uncertainty but either one works out right because he had he had to believe god's word we understand that now second he's called el eleon this means highest or most high in hebrew so he genesis 14 18 melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of la el eleon melchizedek was the priest of al-eleon who is melchizedek it was god in a flesh body but because it was a flesh body that flesh wasn't god right because god's not a god's not flesh god can't be limited right he just borrowed or created that flesh so melchizedek was god in a form but that man was a priest to el elyon the most high god praise god melchizedek was the priest of the most high god now i want to show you what scofield says it also means highest the most high or highest in the first occurrence melchizedek was the priest of the most high god to abram after his victory of the confederated kings abram instantly offered tithes of all and told the king of sodom he wouldn't take even a thread from him because he only wanted el elyon the highest or most high god credited for making him rich so this was a revelation this was a revelation to abraham priest of el eleon this is melchizedek is the priest of the highest strong one and if the highest strong one can help me and my 300 servants defeat five kings i'm not taking anything from any man i'm only taking blessings from el elyon amen he's like you're not giving me anything i'm not taking a thread imagine a thread our daughters are sowing things for 4-h and there's thread all over i they usually have a a pile that they throw away i usually pick it up and dump it down there and abraham dump it in the trash and abraham said i'm not taking one thread from you like that's trash to us but abraham abraham was so sincere he said god amen god has fought for me he's helped me to restore all of lot's family amen all of lot's possessions he helped me a humble little servant what was he 90 was he 85 or 90 i have to look at the the the uh the chronology there 70 or 80 or 75 80 90 year old man defeats five kings that made him stand in awe and then he met god in a form and he said i won't take anything from anybody anything good that comes out of my life was from god and i'm giving tithes of everything amen i will not let a man make me rich praise god i will only take the blessings of god so that made abraham no he's el eleon he's the highest right he's the strong one highest oh these names are some they're so similar right strong one highest almighty the third one is el olam now hola means everlasting or ancient so the first occurrence is abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god let's turn there genesis 21 33. i kind of forgot the context on this one okay this is after isaac after then they cast out hagar and ishmael oh and they had a little trouble with the flocks there beersheba okay and they made a covenant verse 33 and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there the name of the lord the everlasting god and abraham sojourned in philistines land many days now this is right before the temptation so god reveals himself as an everlasting god uh in the midst of this trouble with the wells right he had trouble with the wells god shows him that he's the everlasting god the ancient one he knows all things he made a covenant god brought peace between two brothers having a battle right and that caused abraham to know god as you are the everlasting god you keep your covenants you're faithful to your promises and i'm going to be and here he made a covenant he said i'm going to be faithful to my covenant as well church when we make a promise let's make sure we keep it praise god right everlasting gods that one don't really have much on that one okay and i forgot to change this so this is i switched that over uh yeah i must have stopped that's what i must have got interrupted this morning when i was studying so sorry about that my fault that's right yeah i must have left off right there with that one okay so now here we are uh we've covered all that now i just want to give you the meanings i can see i added a column here so god lowercase is strong one el allah elohim lord capital of the self-existent one who reveals himself the lord lowercase is master adonai almighty god is el shaddai everlasting lord god is jehovah elohim the self-existing strong one the lord god is adonai jehovah master self-existent one who reveals himself and the lord of hosts is the self-existent one who reveals himself of the host of heaven a church in that i try to make it as simple as possible does that help by god's grace the main point is that we see god reveals himself and his characteristics in the moment when his people need it praise god so however the people had a need whatever the need was god showed up and either god or his people recognized this is his name this is his power this is his character this is what he does this is who he is and i want to serve this god amen i don't want to serve the gods of the world and i don't want to serve these uh these heathen lying people and priests of baal i don't want to serve them i want to serve the self-existent one praise god i want to serve the almighty god hallelujah i know he's faithful so here we see the meanings there now you've got the meanings i hope that's a blessing there by god's grace now i went through this morning i had time i went through the entire hebrew lexicon i just typed in jehovah so that searches all all the hebrew words and there was 253 occurrences so let me just give you a few examples of what i mean by jehovah is used in many names okay it's using many names so uriah remember uriah the husband of bathsheba his name means jehovah is my light this must have been a hebrew name because we know he was a hittite he would not have had a hebrew name he was a proselyte and they became a mighty man a mighty mighty man of valor hallelujah and so they named him as they bro maybe he chose his name i'm not sure his name is jehovah is my light elijah right we got a couple elijah friends that means my god is jehovah zechariah means jehovah remembers hezekiah jehovah is my strength that's so suitable because his father was an idolater and he's the one that he established a new uh temple right as far as he he took off the old door put on a new door took down the old goat or gates sorry kicked out the goats established a new gate right and he he smashed and stomped all the idols took their dust and threw them down in the river praise god so jehovah was his strength in other words they had revival in the days of hezekiah because god was strong in hezekiah praise god now you might see this there was a uh christian rock band when i was come just got saved they were called ja or something like that well josh just jehovah's a shortened form of jah just so you know it's just a shorter form just like jehovah it's kind of like a a nickname for yahweh right the most sacred of all god's names yahweh so it's kind of like well they did another step to shorten jehovah jah okay now joseph interesting joseph means jehovah has added right he's the first son of rachel right see her womb was closed so the lord added seed and he was the most like christ praise god hallelujah first samuel 82 says joel means jehovah is god and jochebed i wanted to put some sisters names in here so the sisters could appreciate that jochebed moses's mom means jehovah is glory moses is mom right out of the water moses means out of the water well he come from god's glory jehovah's glory government jacobin and uh like i said there were so many i didn't know there was probably out of those 250 there was probably most of them were names of people i didn't know from the old testament you know and all those genealogies and lineages jeremiah it means whom jehovah has appointed okay and then i put a little emoji there i finished that study this morning all right now i got this from a website uh this morning god is real dot today just i just want to just encourage you a little bit that they give all the names of god in alphabetical order so god is abba right that means father in hebrew let's

motivation in jude he is the foundation of your faith and in revelation he's your coming king amen let's give the lord a round of applause amen all we can say is thank you lord jesus christ for being all these things in the old testament and in the new he's everything to us praise god all that we have need of that's just a fraction of the names you can go down through you had enough time you could go down through and name every single title that he was in the whole bible it would take hours and hours and days and days you'd probably run out of time hallelujah now let's go to the book of acts here i want to close with this thought here i'm almost at my hour good let's go to acts i believe it's chapter four if i'm not mistaken acts chapter four this scripture just kind of come on my heart here before the sermon yes verse seven now remember the story they just raised a paralyzed man up uh he went we were leaping and dancing and praising god the lame man healed now look at verse seven and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this right because peter and uh peter and and john said it wasn't them verse let's go down to verse 10 now be it known unto you all unto the all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom he crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand before you whole this is the stone which was his builder i'm sorry which was set at naw of you builders which has become the head of the corner so there's some more names stone head of the corner neither is that their salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved see every time there was something that happened they said what name what power did you do this so power and name are synonymous praise god power and name are one in the same praise god hallelujah then peter says there's no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved i want to look at another one too this also works in in church correction first corinthians 5. this just come on my mind right now now remember in chapter five of first corinthians there was a man sleeping with his stepmom and paul said they didn't mourn verse three for verily i for i verily as abs in the body but present in the spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that had so done this deed now that's interesting i just read that in colossians paul said i'm not there but i am present in the spirit now that's really something right there let's just stop for a moment i don't know if dead people's spirits can be back i doubt it it doesn't seem like it but paul says my spirit is there with you in the church now how could that be it could only be through the holy spirit because the holy spirit is omnipresent in other words and what i think i believe it means paul's spirit was there because paul told them the truth and paul told them how to solve the problem so in other words if they didn't obey they'd be responsible and that would be recorded as a witness in heaven against them because the prophet told them what to do and so it's as if his spirit was there because he spoke it by the holy spirit amen hallelujah so i wonder so i just wonder it makes me wonder about branham tabernacle when brother brandon was alive makes me wonder and some other churches that may have rejected him and didn't do what he said just makes me wonder he said i am their present already i'm there by the spirit by the holy spirit now look he says in verse 4 in the name of our lord jesus christ when you're gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ so see how paul says it's the same thing in the name of jesus and by the power of the name of jesus verse 5 to deliver such as one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus so he said when someone's this when they won't repent in the name of jesus and by the power of jesus deliver them uh to destruction that their soul might be saved praise god there's great power in this name is there not there's great power there's power to save as we saw in acts chapter four there's no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but there's also power in the name to cast out the leaven that we might become a new lump praise god there's power in the name of jesus to deliver a disobedient one to satan can you imagine delivering a disobedient person just here's satan go ahead i'm handing him over to you can you imagine and that's god's love right that's god's mercy god loves that disobedient person so much he won't let their soul be lost so he delivers them over to satan so satan will destroy their flesh that their soul might be saved that's love like brother says it's the love of god if you find yourself on your back in a hospital looking up to god for healing and you've been a backslider that's god's love right that's god's love because he's brought you to a spot to try to make your heart right right to repent receive salvation ask for forgiveness that's his love to deliver by the power in the name of jesus imagine saying that i deliver you in the name of jesus to the devil that your soul might be saved this is the power in the name of jesus christ so we have power in the name of jesus christ to do miracles because he said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i you in the name of jesus christ rise and walk praise god then there's uh then all the baptisms should be down done in the name of the lord jesus christ repent every one of you and be baptized like like sweet little victoria in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen because it's the authority in that name praise god if god was if if god was jehovah jair to abraham and provided all of his needs then god's going to provide the holy ghost to those who are baptized in the name of jesus christ praise god he's going to provide that because he's jehovah jireh amen oh my and devils were cast on his name remember paul he was grieved many days but they turned to that woman with the spirit he said to come out of her in the name of jesus christ great power in this name this name is mighty to say praise god mighty to save so all we can say is thank you lord jesus christ for that powerful name that gives us everything that we have need of now just remember lord means it's basically curios in the greek which means master some say it's adonai so master jehovah our salvation anointed or messiah so jehovah master messiah that's what we're saying when we say lord jesus christ all the power behind all these names are coming in one name the lord jesus christ praise god he's the all of it it's the name and the bible said it's the name above every name on earth but also in heaven amen in this world and in the world to come praise god how do you do what a name praise god the master jehovah the christos the christ amen the anointed one and he's here today to meet our needs amen amen his name is above every name name not only this world but also that which is to come praise god i don't do everything we do everything we say we want to do it in the name of the lord jesus christ because the power and authority of heaven backs us up praise god it backs us up now the confusing part is when we feel like we're getting rebuked right or we don't see the power of god like paul paul was able to cast the devil out of that woman but then the coppersmith kicked him out of the city right remember that but still he did everything in the name of jesus praise god god was going to be with him uh during the victories and god was going to be a witness against that man demetrius right was alexander the coppersmith i think was alexander the congressman god's being going to be a witness against him and he had to let him in other words god had to show his humility through paul in that case right yet this is the name of the lord name but this name is so humble praise god and allow itself to be humiliated in fact i heard by the rabbi say that when i was listening to tape yesterday uh barbara said god wants to humiliate you in other words he wants you to be humble and he gave an example of speaking in tongues at work but for us we may not if you don't have the gift of tongues you're not going to speak in tongues at work but you can't give a testimony praise god can't give a testimony at work i remember the first time i met my uh current principal he said oh nice to meet you mr smith i've heard about you i said i said i just want to tell you god gave my mom a cancer and i went on and it was when i was second grade and i said i've seen god do all these things and i could tell just a little bit too much for him but but i just wanted to know the first time i met him i want to know that i believe in the name of jesus and he's asked me numerous times to pray for him and pray for people i want him to know that that's the name i stand for praise god i don't stand for the cleveland browns i don't stand for the cleveland cavs that's not my name my name is the lord jesus christ that's that's the name i'm supporting amen that's not my name it's just the name of the bride praise god i'm not saying it's my name i'm a part of that body praise god that's the name we stand for and that's the name that rules this earth and this world and the worlds to come praise god and yet he gets a new name brother william this is my guess i think he'll just pack on another few names behind lord jesus christ because he's got adonai jehovah messiah he's got all those there i imagine he'll just pack a few more on the on the back of that one and we'll have this long name kind of like zephaniah is that how do you say that zephyr pinaya how do you say that zap path i can never say that name that shows my ignorance zap path joseph's name in egypt right just as long i imagine just be lord jesus christ and ruler and some other you know some other great names that will just pack on because this is the name above all names this is the name that sets you free this is the name that healed you this is the name that saved you this is the name that keeps you this is the name that heals you praise god this is the name that has sealed you into the kingdom of god forever amen hallelujah it's the name above every name in church every knee will bow to this name the lord jesus christ i don't care how arrogant they are now or what they got now they won't bow now they'll bow sometime it's our joy to bow right now to the name of the lord jesus christ this jehovah adonai messiah it's our absolute joy to bow to this name because this god is in control he's got a story i just want to do my little part in his story i heard brother say he said i can't do billy grant's part but he can't do mine either right i thank god for my little part i just want to be faithful on my part do my part and he'll say well done you ran your race you kept the faith in your life enter into the joys of the lord prepared for you from the foundation of the world if we can just honor amen if we can just bow to this name today praise god amen submit to this name what eternal rewards and blessings await us hallelujah as we bow to this holy name and i'm going to stop right there but there seemed like there was something else let's stand to our feet musicians can come it seemed like there was one more scripture i had on my heart here i didn't didn't write down by what power or what authority do we do these things do it in the power and authority of the lord jesus christ praise god church i know here's brother william this is my testimony i was a a really bad cusser i cussed and swore all the time chew tobacco cigarettes i mean all kinds of evil things i could listen but brother as soon as i heard about the lord jesus christ baptism i got me one of those recorders those tape recorders the handheld ones it's got the little cassettes you can take out and i started memorizing acts 2 38 i would drive down the hall i would drive down the hall highway going to football practice and i'd be listening to myself saying acts 2 38 and peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the lord jesus christ and one day shortly after that brother william right after recording that one day i realized and said oh my goodness i have not cussed in so many days since i've started listening to this scripture as soon as the name of the lord jesus christ was upon my lips and i was baptized in water my mouth was completely cleansed i've not said a cuss word since that's back in 2002 praise god 19 years just putting that amen just putting that holy name upon your lips amen if you respect and honor that name it's like a coal of fire amen that'll touch our lips it'll cleanse our lips and then after cleanse our lips who shall go for me i will go who who can i send i'll go for you praise god amen ever since he cleansed my lips brother bang i've been going for him i've been preaching for him praise god i've been living for him witnessing to him we had a guy visit our house this week he was pumping our septic system and i took out my books and i said my modesty book i said sir do you know anybody that loves jesus christ and like to learn about him he said no i'm a jehovah's witness i said oh i said well if you change your mind let me know i said i'll see you next year i said i thought i said that's all i want to do i just want to witness the people tell them about jesus praise god i might jesus had on all weekend two or three people say i said i said i said thank you i said he healed my mama cancer ever since that call of fire touched my lips all i want to do is say that holy name praise god i want to go for him i want to speak for him i want to be his representative you and i should be the mouthpiece of god for the spirit and the bride say come amen come to the waters of life come to the fountains of life in the name of the lord jesus christ amen in the name of the master jehovah's our salvation the messiah christos in the name of jesus christ praise god let's bow our heads for a moment i went a little over an hour what a beautiful name let's see not play that song what a beautiful
