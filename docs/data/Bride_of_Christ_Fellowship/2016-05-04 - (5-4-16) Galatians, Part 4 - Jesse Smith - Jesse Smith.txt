glory looking forward to that hallelujah thank you Jesus I'll get right into the word this evening by God's grace let's take our Bibles let's go to Galatians chapter 5 appreciate all the saints pressing around to the house of the Lord tonight praise the Lord like to look at Galatians part 4 tonight by God's grace hard to believe we already got four parts on this but trust it's a blessing to you by the grace of the Lord how many love the word of God everybody love the word of God Amen praise God Galatians chapter 5 verse one like to start there we left off at the end of chapter 4 I've got a little bit of feedback that these uh Galatians messages are really helping understanding of the word so I'm thankful for that got a lot of feedback on Sunday morning service thank God for that and some feedback on the evening so really appreciate all the feedback about the grace of the Lord helps us know we're in the right channel praise the Lord so we just want to stay in the right channel by the grace of the Lord Galatians chapter five and my hope tonight I said that's my hope is to get done with chapter five tonight and then we have one more to go so I thought there's probably two more messages maybe three depending on some of these texts I've been reading into Ephesians I'm aring to Ephesians 4 and taking notes and quotes and history uh to try to teach in Ephesians brother Braham preached quite a bit on Ephesians as a parallel to Christian maturity and the adoption and the uh Israel taking the Promise Land he typed that quite often so uh trying to pull out the the quotations that are blessing there by the grace of the Lord so Galatians chapter 5 verse one we'll just read uh one through uh let's one through five by God's grace Galatians 5 1-5 there say amen amen Thank You Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ hath made us free be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a deor to do the whole law Christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law you are fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith amen father let's bow our heads if you have a word on or need on your heart just make it know to God as we pray Heavenly Father Lord we're humbled again Lord God to be here speak to through this Thy word dear Lord you allow this word Lord to exist Lord and continue to Lord be a a standard and a rule and a witness to us Lord for all these years 2,000 years Lord since they're written so we thank you Lord help us to apply them to our lives and being understanding Lord God I'm I'm very thankful Lord I feel like these scriptures Lord these services are such a help and a strength God so I pray you speak again to us tonight for your glory in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen amen God bless you being and SE there praise praise the lord we would like to uh go through this here tonight by the grace of the Lord and uh ask the Lord to help us here as we have and I trust he will uh before we uh jump into chapter 5 I just want to share a few things here U you know brother bradam said brother Bram used two significant portions of Galatians to preach some important messages in 1965 I just was looking and found some of these and uh brother RAM used Galatians 1 to preach the God of this evil age in 1965 so that's a great quote there and uh also you use Galatians 4 uh the text about ishmail and Isaac to preach the message the seed shall not be air with the shook that's an important message because the seed people are the promised people not the not the bondage people not the law people not the Ishmael people of you know Sarah trying to bring it the promise to pass through her own thinking but it's those who waited upon the promise of God that's who God blesses amen that's the perfect will of God so we thank the Lord for that so I just thought I'd share those those are important texts right out of Galatians uh there's other numerous sermons where brother brand would hit many scriptures in here um the one I found often was Galatians 1 where Paul said you preach any other gospel than what I preach he's cursed brother BR would bring that to the godhead he'd bring that to the water baptism amen and just use that that's a great course for us that uh for us that's studied it it's very familiar but it's important part now we've been looking at this more on a on a not not not a broad level but a very specific level we've been looking at the book of Galatians and I believe if we look at it the right way it'll continue to bless us here uh as we saw the major problem with the galatian church was legal ISM okay they they were taking Commandments that God wasn't requiring anymore that they they came in we'll say like this they came in the message and it wasn't part of the the the Commandments of God and then some false preachers brought in some legalism and said well you got to do this to be saved and they're like what do you mean the spirit just fell you know but then they started believing it and Paul said you're foolish right you called him foolish and he said I doubt he said I doubt where you stand with God need need to travail in birth again until your uh really born again so we know that legalism doesn't produce a baptism of the Holy Ghost experience so we know that and so we've just got to understand that the difference between legalism and obedience obedience is just love uh love keep love keeping the Commandments of God whereas legalism is excessive strictness uh an obedience that is based upon fear and not by love it's a obedience based upon even things that are not commanded of the people it's something excessive so if Jesus said I always do that which please the father so we so we can and we can do it with the right attitude not legalism but based upon love and that's where we always get confused well you're a bunch of legalists with your women with long skirts and men with short hair and all these things and they make us legalist but we're not legalists we're just simply obeying we're doing what pleases our Lord amen so we have to make that important uh distinction and listen Church uh if the Bible talks about legalism then we need to use examples from the Bible right so if the Bible gives these examples observing days and times and years and uh circumcision as legalism well then we got to we got to believe that and we got to apply that to our church and make sure we're not injecting anything that would be legalism uh that's not required in this hour all right now I want to read this let's go to Second Peter 3 this is kind of a little off the off the uh maybe the thought but I just want to remind you this this came to my memory uh as I Was preparing last time so let's go to Second Peter 3 and verse 14 and I just want to before I I read this here I just want to tell you that as I read the letters of Paul I'm doing my best to rightly divide it because every preacher has to rightly divide it and every preacher will answer how they build upon the foundation of the Apostles everyone Paul said every preacher will answer for that and so uh based upon that you know sometimes you might said well brother Jess why don't you stop and preach this verse well that's probably because I didn't understand it and I wasn't the only one right because we're going to read right here where Peter didn't always even understand Paul's writings praise the Lord Paul's writings were so deep sometimes Peter said even I don't understand them sometimes so what do we need to do if we don't understand on something wait upon the Lord on it amen all right this verse 14 second Peter 3:14 wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation so see as time goes on we don't get upset and say where's the Rapture where come on Lord we don't get discouraged come on church it's your fault no Peter said count it as a fact that God is having more longsuffering and saving more Souls praise God don't get discouraged if it's not on your timetable let's try to get our thoughts on God's timetable yes Glory even as our brother beloved now beloved brother Paul here's a man that rebuked him into his face and he still says you're my beloved brother look at that love in the early church by our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given him given unto him hath written unto you verse 16 as also in all his Epistles all his letters look at this all his letters speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood praise God so he said some these letters you write Paul they're really hard to understand and he is a man that had the keys to the kingdom praise the Lord so as we go through this you know as we go through you know Ephesians well Galatians Ephesians Colossians Philippians and Lord willing if we go to Corinthians things like that keep this in mind there's some things that are real deep here that even Apostle Paul could or even Apostle Peter could understand and that's okay um so here he goes he keeps going here hard to be understood let's finish verse 16 right in the middle which they that are unlearned and unstable rest now that means to twist so if someone's unstable they'll twist what Paul said but yet really they don't understand it and they twist it to make it say something that it doesn't say as they also do the other scriptures so see these false preachers they just don't twist one scripture they twist a lot of scriptures so as you see as I told you I want to preach a message on uh when Mo when many of the preachers left the message I've been wanting to preach that I didn't have time to do it lately but I want to preach that and show you some of our Believers and friends that have left the message if you look back on what they taught you can see TW rest after rest after rest after twist after twist after breaking of the word time and time again and I I wonder who caught up on it right right so what do we need to do we need to rightly divide the word and ask the Lord to help discern the truth to us can say can you say Amen to that am that's what we're going to that's why I preach out before I want to bring out I want to show I know at least four or five preachers left the message but as you go through and as I I went back and listened to some of their messages and thought about what they preached there was many times they Twisted the scripture and made it say something that it didn't say all right so we want to get to that but look they they did this to other scriptures finishing verse 16 unto their own destruction I don't know if that's physical destruction like in 1 Corinthians 5 remember where Paul said I turn them over to the uh to the devil that their flesh might be destroyed that their soul might be saved I don't know if it's that destruction or if it's Soul destruction only God knows ye therefore beloved seeing you know that these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the heir of the wicked well if it's wicked then it's lost soul in context fall from your own steadfastness okay so erors help make you fall from your own steadfastness but I like Verse 18 here's what we need to do we need to what grow in the grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both down forever amen all right so let's go back to Galatians 5 so you see Paul wrote a lot of hard things and maybe some things were hard to understand but instead of trying to interpret them let's leave them alone until we understand and not try to twist them uh to get off into any air of any wickedness or lust but help us God to stay with the word grow in Grace and a knowledge of the Lord and Savior praise God so I just want to bring that to your mind that as we study Paul Paul's not an easy one to study if if a if a prophet of God who had the Keys of the Kingdom admitted some of these things are hard to understand uh then I hope youall have grace and mercy on me okay but the fact is we need to read them and we need to apply them to our lives that's the fact we need to read through the Bible praise the Lord so how many of us are reading our Bibles like we ought to I'm not asking you raise your hands right but we should be amen and these scriptures uh are very helpful to us of course okay now let's start at verse one Galatians 5 verse1 stand Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage that song comes to my mind to rise uh possess your inheritance amen okay now how many you know what the word Liberty means it means to Omit things that have no relation to Salvation that's really a striking definition so if you're standing in the liberty of Christ then you omit or get rid of anything that's outside of Salvation in other words you have so much Liberty that you get rid of everything I'm so free I'm free from all sin and all I do is stand in the salvation of Jesus Christ that's Liberty it's not enjoy sin it's actually avoid all sin and I'm free in Christ because I'm only dwelling in the word that's what Liberty means okay it also means true Liberty is living as we ought to and not as we please other words true Liberty is living the word loving the word and not living to the flesh Okay so somebody can't say well we're so Liberty we have so much freedom in Christ that we can do whatever we want no a real Christian does whatever they want but uh whatever they do is the word of God whatever they want is the word of God they only want the word in other words all right good now so in other words Church it will be a battle to remain free in Christ so he said Stand Fast uh that we be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage so we don't want to be tempted or Tangled into legalism or living by works or living by fear we want to live by love okay that's very important for us verse two and here's what he's talking about so here's the context behold I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing now think about this he didn't say circumcision will profit you a little bit he said nothing praise the Lord now remember remember Timothy was circumcised so that didn't profit him nothing as far as with Christ but it did profit him fellowship with the Christian Jews is everybody with me so that act of itself did nothing for Paul in Jesus's eyes as far as you know anything for salvation but it did give him a little more Fellowship amen glory and that they might receive him so see this this lawke keeping doesn't profit anything nothing at all now verse four three for I testify again to every man that is circumcised he's a deader to do the whole law and that's something he said my if you're going to bring this legalism back in then you better keep all of it praise God that's what we don't want to do we don't want to inject anything back in that's already been fulfilled and done away with that's right now look at verse four Christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are Fallen I'm sorry are justified by the law you're fallen from Grace now Paul's getting real serious now because the fall means to lose it if you look in the Greek to lose Grace so as soon as someone starts really hammered on this and as we see these are false preachers right this not somebody who made a mistake and repented these false preachers were were uh evil okay and so when they started getting people to believe that and when they themselves were uh believing in legalism they lost the effects of Grace the blessings of Grace okay now remember the scripture says that about Grace uh Grace will never let anyone down but the Bible said a person can fail Grace Esau failed the grace of God he casts it away so instead of saying well I'll take the grace he cast it away and we rather have a life of fornication and a profane life okay so see grace is free like that seed of the four grounds remember the seed is free for anybody it depends what kind of ground you have it depends what you do with that seed okay so they fall from grace or lose Grace when they take law they lose it so they're not under grace okay now that's pretty rough he Paul just he just Paul don't he he just tears it up he just takes the ax to the root of the tree right like a real Prophet amen verse five for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by Jesus Christ so Paul's saying by the Holy Ghost we're waiting for his righteousness we're not trying to establish it by lawke keeping but we're trusting that right his righteousness will come okay so we're waiting by faith but they're trying to physically produce righteousness themselves by their lawke keeping but he said we're not that we're trusting in the righteousness that is to Come Oh Glory all right verse six for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love amen so what what avails now Avail means to have power so what has power in Christ Jesus the Bible said it's faith that operates by love what's faith a substance of a promise of God received right so that's what avails that's what has power with God when your love moves you to believe the promise you receive the promise and now you've got power with God youve got power of God's promises to come to pass in your life that's what avails that's what has power with God when you love God so much you just believe his word oh Hallelujah church amen I just love God so much I believe he's going to do it because he loves me and I love him amen all right that's what that's the kind of faith we need faith that works by love not faith that works by scaredness okay or fear being lost but Faith which works by love I know he loves me I know he'll keep his word to me amen all right verse seven now look they started well you did run well he said who did hinder you that you should not obey the the truth now the Run means to exert all your efforts so they were exerting all the effort in Grace see grace makes you work right Grace makes you want to do something for Jesus yeah so see they were running well but something hindered them which means persuaded them or to beat them back so they're running well they're running for the gospel and something gets in their way and starts beat them back no don't go forward with the gospel don't go forward with the gospel and it starts hindering their run or their walk with the Lord and what did it legalism well I'm holier than this brother or sister because I do this and and they inject it into the gospel that's right oh my so he says you did you ran where you started off good see it's not how you start is the fact that you got to finish praise the Lord remember the Bible said you must receive the end of your faith so anybody can have a beginning of Faith but it's those who have the end of their faith it's those who never quit it's those who never Cast Away the faith it's those who continue in the promises of God they are the ones blessed of the Lord how many going to continue in Christ all the days of your life amen Lord I'll never turn away there's no turning back I have decide to follow Jesus amen the cross before me the World Behind Me amen oh yes Glory I started with Jesus and I'm going through praise God verse eight this persuasion cometh not of him that calls you so God didn't persuade them to do legalism and God won't persuade us to do legalism God did not do that Paul did not persuade them for legalism this is someone outside of the original Bringers of the message here the word of God someone outside injected this thought in there that's right God don't persuade us to be legalists to try to earn our own righteousness all right now verse nine a little leav loving the whole love that ought to be familiar to us remember 1 Corinthians 5 remember that man was sleeping with his stepmom and Paul said you haven't mourned about it he said a little leevan makes the whole CH Church sinful okay same thing here so now now you start to see how each church is different you see that they the Corinthians church and the galatian church both had leaven one was a sexual sin one was a legalistic and one couldn't say well you're I'm more holier than you they couldn't because Paul said they're it's both sin so whether it's a sexual sin the church or a legalistic type of a self-righteousness in the church it's still leav it's still sin God help us to keep the leaven out of our churches amen see that that's why these letters are important it don't matter what sin it is any sin unbelief or lust or Pride or anything like that anything will keep the move of God hindered but we must remember God didn't persuade us to do those things praise God God persuaded us to love him so much that our faith casts down all temptation amen glory oh I love the word verse 10 I have confidence in you through the Lord that you will not be none otherwise mine now this is a statement too look at this statement before he said I stand in doubt of you right before he sent you foolish Galatians and now he tries he rebukes him now he tries to encourage him I have confidence in you through the Lord so see our confidence if you trust in the Lord that you will be none you'll be the same mind as me that you will understand a little leav makes your whole church uh stop moving in the Lord makes you sinful look at this but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever be now look at that Paul says whoever troubled whoever preaches false Doctrine they're the ones that can to be judged that right remember that says in James chapter 3 the Bible said be not Desiring many preachers or many Masters because they'll receive the greater condemnation there's levels of Jud judgment right just like there's levels of blessings there's also levels of condemnation so Paul says it's going to come down to this whoever was the false preachers they're the ones are going to pay the most that's right whoever he be you don't name them uh I would say like this they're pretty fortunate he didn't call their names because Paul lik to call names right oh yeah he would call names right there right in his letters and these are your Eternal letters right Eternal Word of God verse 11 this will help us out here as we move on and I Brethren if I yet preach circumcision why do I yet suffer persecution that is the offense of the Cross ceased okay so the cross offends the Jews because it takes away the necessity of circumcision and that was why Paul was being persecuted okay here's what the ESV says but if I Brothers still preach circumcision why am I still being persecuted in that case the offense of the Cross has been removed so Paul said the cross is offensive because Jesus paid for all the sins and fulfilled all these things because he did that it's an offense to those legalists okay that's what he says it's an offense he said so that's why I don't preach it because but that's why you're offended is because the cross did away with this and you're offended because you still want to keep it you still want to have your own righteousness instead of the word of God all right right verse 12 now here's a statement too look at this guy look at this man of God look at this prophet of God he don't pull any punches verse 12 I would that they were even cut off which trouble you you know what cut off means amputated you ever seen anybody with amputation yeah I've seen them missing legs and missing fingers and whatever more it's just like it's like something should be there but it's not and they have to relearn how to live their lives because they're missing this part and Paul said I wish I wish the Holy Ghost would come in and amputate these false preachers out of the church praise God why because false preaching brings in canorous disease right that's what he said in first Timothy so see I wish these preachers were were uh amputated see doesn't play around verse 13 for Brethren ye have been called unto Liberty remember just stand in Salvation stand in Christ stand in just holy things just live how the Bible said you should live not how man's false interpretation tell you live he said use only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another okay that's quite a scripture here so you've been called to Liberty so serve others so you're called to live in just salvation doctrines just the Bible doctrines here and so now that you're called to the Bible truth God truth th serve others not the flesh the law is fulfilled in one word love remember Jesus said that what's the law fulfilled in one word love not works but love not legalism love okay so if we're really in Christ Jesus we should desire to serve others to love others praise God okay so don't lose use your Liberty for an occasion for the flesh now occasion means to make a plan don't saywell because I'm a Christian I can still sin and God will forgive me he said don't do that don't make plans to sin try to make plans to avoid sin yes amen so use your Liberty to love and serve one another praise God verse 14 I love this amen for all the laws fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed of one another now bite means to bite with the teeth to cut or lacerate to Ren with reproaches so this could be done people can bite each other by just saying evil words to one another by wounding their here it says to wound their soul which is probably their Spirit Christians should not bite or devour devour means to consume to squander or waste someone to strip somebody of their goods to utterly destroy them okay so we see that the law is fulfilled in love and we should not destroy one another and then take heed if you're going to fight take heed that you don't consume one another don't destroy each other okay verse 16 this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so the only way to walk in the spirit is deny the Flesh and its lust so these are contrary to one another the lust of the flesh is contrary totally opposite to the moving of the Holy Spirit the spirit is opposite of the flesh this is the battle uh this battle is the reason why we cannot do the things that we would do if we wanted if we're led by the spirit we're not under the law okay that's verse 17 let's read that for the flesh lust is against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other that you cannot do the things that you would all right but if you be led of the spirit you're not under the law praise the Lord now the works of the flesh are manifest now remember when brother digs was here that Friday night I read through this list you remember that I'm going to read it again tonight to remind you okay these are the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness so adultery is sexual acts of married people with someone they're not married to fornication or sexual acts before two people are married uncleanness is luxurious living or living based upon your lusts lasciviousness is lawlessness having no sense of Shame all right now verse 20 idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions and heresies idolatry is giving anything worship or reverence other than the Lord witchcraft is sorcery magical satanic Arts administering of drugs hatred is is intense ill will or dislike variance is Con heated arguments so we got to make sure we don't argue right Church make sure we don't argue that's probably one that would uh apply most to our lives most of by God's grace we're I don't know anyone in witchcraft thank God for that I don't know anyone that's tempted by witchcraft I know brothers that have been pulled out of it thank God for that like brother uh uh brother Brian Hawkins is preacher before he was into witchcraft before coming to the message and and God delivered him from all that got of all his books reminds me of Acts 19 remember in Acts 19 they went into Ephesus and and preached and the Holy Ghost was healing and saving people so much that all these magicians threw all their books together and burned them Remember That Glory I like that real book burning amen that's the kind of books that need to be burned amen glory is books of sin and Witchcraft and nonsense now here's another one that's in the message ulation is jealousy or rivalry rivalry between this preacher that one rival between that sister and this sister and all things rivalries I'm goingon to do better I'm gonna I'm going to get more than you and all these things like that wrath is boiling anger boing up passionate anger Strife is a desire to put oneself forward electioneering for some position just trying to get a position that's a Strife I deserve to be this I need to be the next officer in this area I'm gonna try to push my way into that or some other position now seditions are divisions we see a lot of that around our ranks don't we Satan will get into a group and divide them and you have a church split right anybody ever seen that sure seen that that's a division I'm sorry that's a sedition but it's also a division heresy is teaching your own tenants or opinions for followers so instead of teaching what the Bible says you teach your own opinions praise the Lord that's right that's why here like I said we try to give it two or three scriptures for everything we believe because Jesus said that's how you build a Doctrine two or three scriptures like I said if I'm not doing that and somebody help me out by God's grace help me out because I want to be right I don't want to be a her or heretic right I don't I don't want to be Jesse the heretic I want to be Jesse the faithful witness to Christ amen all right now envying is the same as covetousness just so you know at least in these Greek definitions that's greedy of game eager to have more what belongs to others why just got to have the house like that or the car like that or the wife like that or the husband like that it's coveting something that person has murderers is ending someone's life or just hating them because of something they did Without a Cause Jesus said drunkards becoming intoxicated any form of alcohol and revelings is late night parting so party okay now let's finish verse 21 of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in times past they which do these things shall what not inherit the kingdom of God all right is everybody clear on that now I love the Bible because look how specific pause he he dealing with legalists and he said well let me show you if you're legalist let me show you exactly what sin is and he listed out for them to see it amen I'm glad he did it praise the Lord I'm glad he did it now what would their battles be with Heretics because they're bringing their own circumcision doctrines in their observations of days and years and months right they're bringing their own tenants in and they're guilty of a heresy and he said I he said they're going to be destroyed and God will judge them if they don't make it right this is serious church it's serious because these things affect Modern Day message churches that's the message Church of their day they receive the word of the hour We're a message Church of our day we receive the word of the hour yes but the fruit of the spirit verse 22 is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith I'll go through these briefly just like I did the others because I just preached on the fruit of the spirit a few weeks ago meekness Temperance against such there's no law I love that there's no law against living like this amen so this is the Liberty Church this is the Liberty where Christ makes us free when we do these things right here amen this is the Liberty the other one is sin and W inherit the kingdom of God but this is Liberty in Christ Jesus that's why it's better to avoid arguments it's better to avoid heresies it's better to avoid any parties better to avoid all that because uh the real fruit of the spirit will be n will be nothing with that it'll be totally contrary to it and and you can't you can't walk both at the same time here walking in the spirit in obedience or you're walking in legalism or sin that's right okay so there's no law against love which is good will or Brotherly Love or Gabe love you want good for your brother or sister you don't want evil for them you want good no matter if they've done evil to you right that's love joy is gladness I'm just glad all the time I just love all the time God help us to have that fruit now this is something I me didn't mention when I preached on fruit of the spirit but remember Jesus said you either have genuine fruit or crup fruit okay so everybody understand that so everybody's producing some fruit let me say like that that's what I didn't preach I didn't get to that that fruit is a deep fruit is a deep message as well there's a lot of scriptures on it but everybody's producing fruit and that's what the story brother Brandon gave he said if you have an orange tree and you cut off the branch and engraft a peach it'll produce peaches because it's living off the life but it's not the original life of the original tree and so he said a real Christian will produce oranges because that's the original life of the tree praise God but see the peach still produces fruit it's just not the right fruit praise God and let me say like this foolish virgin produces fruit but it's not fruit from the soul it's fruit from the human spirit and it'll corrupt it'll end but real Holy Ghost fruit from the soul will be good fruit and it will be fruit unto eternal life amen because it's from the soul it's Eternal and that's where fruits come from the soul the seed because the soul is the seed so the foolish version has fruits from the spirit and they corrupt after a while just do something contrary to them one time you're going to see some corrupt fruit right that's exactly right but do something wrong to a real Holy Ghost feel believer they might have to pray and struggle but pretty soon they'll be praying for you on their knees yes amen with long suffering amen with patience even if it's totally contrary to what you think or or say that's right that's real fruit how many want real Fruit of the Spirit Well I do church I really God help me no I got a email today or email yesterday from somebody who left the message and you know trying to convince me uh to reexamine Malachi 45 and6 and uh they were kind in it and so forth uh but it's really you know it's really good because this is really bringing out a lot of good fruits in my life am in other words brother Enoch I've seen what I'm made of when people say you're wrong and you're off the word and all these things like that and you're know you're you're preaching Paul's doctor you're following a man all these things like that it's wonderful to see the Holy Ghost take over when your flesh once in fight I got it yesterday and uh you know the flesh wants to go fight the Mind wants to fight right back but just pray and God's my witness God's God's helped me instead of being upset when I read it the flesh rise up but I just close my eyes I'll just pray or laugh or or you know with joy and it all that will just leave me and I don't feel anything toward that person amen glory amen because no matter what happens you're going to have a fruit you're going to produce a fruit based upon that action that happened to you so what are you going to give him corrupt fruit we don't want to do that we're going to give him genuine Holy Ghost fruit fruit you know saying we're preaching heresy and things like that not like I said when we preach that message everything we believe is right out of here that's right everything I believe I point you right out of here I spend many minutes and maybe hours on the YouTube and every everybody that emails me saying this is just what we believe just the word of God Amen that's right now the next fruit is peace tranquility safety security Prosperity Harmony that's what peace is longsuffering is patience endurance steadfast slowness to avenge when you've been wronged gentleness is moral goodness Integrity I like that Integrity gentleness is being having integrity and kindness goodness is upright of hearten life it's upright it's not walking low in deception it's upright it's truthful faith is of course the substance of Faith meekness is the mildness you're mild instead of instead of uh hot you're mild hot with the temper you're mild with the sweetness of the Holy Spirit and temperate means you have self-control the virtue of one who Masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetites is't that beautiful ah my that's beautiful praise the Lord so now you know what legalists will struggle with legalists will struggle with those real fruits right there right they because they're Heretics and if they're if they're off the word they can't produce if you're walking the flesh you cannot walk in the spirit praise the Lord so you see that I hope that's understandable now there's no law against those fruits now verse 24 and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts remember we preached that right before on Good Friday Christ's crucifixion and our crucifixion amen and we must daily crucify the lust of the flesh since I preached that church I've had many times I've been praying recently on my knees and that's been my prayer Lord this morning I Crucify My will anybody else praying that I hope you are it's good to crucify it right away in the morning so he's dead when you go to work or when you go see your friends or whatever you're doing when you you go to work or school or whatever more it's good to be already dead right amen amen crucify with the affection and lust thereof verse 25 if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain Glory okay uh Pro provoking one another envying one another okay so let's look at these words what's vain glory mean eager for Glory or to be conceited so we don't want to be conceited the legalists will be conceited always talking about themselves always uh bragging on themselves and eager somebody to give them Glory provoking others is to challenge or irritate or contest or combat with somebody so we don't want to be glory looking for Glory be conceited we don't don't want to be provoke others to want to combat them I'll I'll argue to the death about this with you we don't want to do that church but that's what legalists do and we don't want to uh Envy one another right which is we don't want to uh try to compare ourselves to be like others okay all right let's go to chapter six look like we're doing pretty good on time here by the grace of the Lord praise God yeah maybe we'll finish tonight by the grace the Lord we'll see chapter 6 now I hope this is starting to come together for you like it's coming together for me to really understand why was this letter written who's it for what's it really mean for the local church everybody see how it means something to us now as a local church we got to keep all the all the fleshly things out all the divisions all the lust all the fornication adultery everything it must be kept out out we must not inject anything to the word just say what the word says all right okay verse one chapter 6 verse one all right Brethren now look this is quite a statement to tell a bunch of people that were struggling with legalism Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such and one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou be tempted all right so he just told this this church you know that was caught in legalism he just told the fruits of the spirit The Works of the Flesh and now he says if you see someone overtaken try to restore them in the spirit of meekness now one who is spiritual look at verse one ye which are spiritual now spiritual means one who's filled or governed by the spirit of God Amen so don't send somebody who don't have the Holy Ghost send somebody who's got the Holy Ghost amen we're going to try to wi somebody back to the Lord send somebody who's born again yes somebody who's spiritual they're filled with the Holy Spirit and what are they doing then then they're Meek then they're gentle then they're longsuffering right like all those fruits said if they're filled and they're producing those fruits so you can't send a carnal person you got to send a spiritual person now restore means to repair or put in order how many you ever seen somebody's life out of order if you see their life is out of order it's not found the order of the word someone spiritual is supposed to go correct them notice he didn't say the pastor every time praise the Lord Brother that's why brother brother says that that's why I said it say said don't make your pastor do it every time you go to that person if they're out of order now don't get me wrong everybody expects the pastor to do it and I do do it sometimes when I need to but it's for everybody anyone who's spiritual can go to try to help somebody get back in order with the word I still email people that left the the message in our church I just added some names to that list because if I love them I'm GNA email every month I do I do it every month I ask them to come back to the church and come back to the word if I did anything wrong come ask me or come let me know about it I'll repent because the real Shepherd goes after the Sheep amen praise God I keep begging if I had their numbers I might call them I don't have their numbers now I might get to the spot where annoying and I told him I said if you don't want these anymore let me know they never email me back saying no if they would I would stop but if they don't stop I'm gonna keep going because who knows because remember remember I told you that testimony we had a preacher who left the message a few years ago and I called them I kept trying to call them my brother kept trying to call remember that I sorry anyways wouldn't hear wouldn't return the call wouldn't return the call all of a sudden Simon put something on Facebook about a revival going on in Napoleon where cam brother Cam's churches and the brother got so convicted by the Holy Spirit he repented of his backsliding after three years of not contacting anybody came back and the first thing he told me he said I want to thank you for leaving voicemails on my phone and ever since I heard that brother Enoch I'm always going to email call people religiously until they come back if they can come back amen because all the fathers give me will come to me praise God Amen and now he's back in the face faith walking in the faith living a Pure Life sometimes people just struggle church and we got to be patient so you who are spiritual any spiritual people out there we only got a few tonight I trust you are I trust you're filled with the Holy Ghost sisters you can go after people right just you're not preaching but you're going back persuading and testifying amen so you want somebody to take the word you got to get a preacher preachers handle the word but sisters can go back and pray pray and and testify and try to be alive right sisters that's right that's amen so send someone who's spiritual restore put one back in order with the spirit of meekness now meekness remember we just read over that meekness is gentleness or mildness you got to be mild with people that leave the message have you ever seen anybody walk up to somebody and ball them out and say how could you leave the message how could you leave Christ you ought to come back and then they come back you ever seen that I've never seen that it might happen but the Bible says use what mildness meekness now if people want to ball them out that's up to them but for me if I'm not a prophet I'm GNA stay with this right here right and I've seen this I've seen people restored by meekness like I just told you I've seen people fall away and just meekly tell them you pray for them tell you love them contact them every now and then and they'll come back if it's God's will for them to come back either way guess what you're your brother's keeper aren't you amen praise God now he said be be meek because of this consider yourself lest you be tempted so see if you don't go mildly and you go hot or you go whatever you might get tempted right you might go too much into the flesh so you got to have what self-control amen amen all right that's verse one praise the Lord so Paul says to this church of legalist he said there's some of you that have fallen away so those of you who are filled with the spirit go try to draw back with meekness use meekness use mildness here all right now ver pardon me verse Two Bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ now look at that when someone's backsliding it's a burden that's on them and we've got to go bear it they got some burden they just can't handle so it's keep keeping them it's so heavy it's keeping them from church right it's keeping them from fellowship it's keeping them from the word they have such a heavy burden a spiritual burden probably just carrying this burden around it's probably maybe it's depression maybe it's lust who knows what the burden is but it's a burden and you've got to be able to bear that burden and help them get over that burden and when you do that you fulfill the law of who Christ so obviously Christ must have come and bore someone's burdens I think he did it on Calvary glory amen I think he carried up calvary's hill amen are you with me Church carried all of our burdens he carried our sins right he carried them up the hill carried them for our burdens and then took our burdens amen hallelujah and that's your way your way to Bear someone's burden is to come by and try to talk them back into the faith praise the Lord raise your hand if you could who knows somebody who's Fallen away from the message is anybody can anybody raise your hand all right good hands up now ask yourself I'm not going to ask you raise your hands down but ask yourself if you ever thought you might be led to go after them think about that because that's what the law of Christ is praise the Lord not the law of Bri of Christ Fellowship or Bible Believers the law of Christ it's the see someone who's got a burden they just can't handle it and go to them and try to put them back in order let's think long and hard on that because eternal life is living for others Paul tells the legalistic church get your now look think about this get your mind off your fleshly circumstan get your mind off your calendar I got to keep this day I got to keep that day and get your mind on restoring people back to the faith what a what a statement to tell a bunch of legalists get your mind off your your calar and get your mind off your flesh get your mind on bringing people back to the faith God help me God help all of us praise the Lord that's the word of God Church word of God verse three for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he deceives himself see if we think we're something we think we're we're too good for them they fell away we're too good for them we're not going to go after them right I think I'm something and really we're nothing if we're not interested in helping other people who Fall Away praise God remember when the Sheep go after the one that left or the shepherd went after the one sheep that left sorry the 99 who thought they're righteous he left there he went to go after the one that was lost and that was you amen Jesus went after you Jesus came after me praise the Lord amen I hope you're thinking about people that you can talk to but you better be spiritual better know where you stand you better pray you better be mild I've experienced that the last six months pretty good and I imagine it's going to keep going as time goes on we be real spiritual brother amen but you not a real spiritual belt Titan belt of Truth and hel of Salvation oh my sword of the spirit I'd be real mild to restore people back to the faith you know I saw somebody recently that left the message and they come right out of their car and hug me I about fell over I was so shocked I thought hey thank you sir so I went hugg them real hard too you know and uh I like that praise the Lord I like that I'm hoping they're missing me I believe it because if we're salty they got to be thirsty yeah if we got real Salt unless they you know unless they're unless someone goes past the line of Mercy judgment they got to be thirsty for some God help us be thirsty all right verse four now look at this so he tells them you got to go after the the Fallen go after those who are Fallen away don't worry about your flesh don't worry about all these right self-righteousness don't worry about calendar dates and all these things worry about people that have fallen away but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another okay so now Paul's looking into their works okay you must have the right works in your life you must be doing what you're supposed to be doing so faith and love will cause you to go after others restore others legalism will cause you just to set up camp and just make your own religious uh righteousness that's where we got to be careful in the message that's where every denomination failed they got comfortable with what they believed and didn't move on and didn't follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit we've got to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit be interested in others but let every man prove his work then you have rejoicing in yourself alone and not in another okay for every man shall bear his own burden okay now here it gives a two burdens you must see others who are burdened and Fallen away and then you must go minister to them but then everybody has their own work Paul says so you get there's two burdens in your life there's burdens you seeing Oh Brother so and so Amen brother amen we know this brother he fell away we got a burden we got to go bring him back but then there's also the burden of am I doing what I'm supposed to do so Paul not me Paul laid it out there's two burdens Glory the burden you have for people that fall away and the burden that you have to do the will of God for your life is that is that okay with everybody every man bear your own burden okay so we are Brother's Keeper can you say Amen to that so when we don't see people after a while we should say where's brother so and so where's sister so and so how is he doing how's she doing some of you if you haven't contacted some of the people that left or uh if you don't want someone else who left a long time ago you might want to pray about that because being your brother Sister's Keeper means reaching out to them at least I'm not saying L sit and listen to them destroy brother brandom or trying to do something like that okay or trying to talk you out of that I'm just saying say hi tell them you love them you're praying for them that's all I'm saying because I've I've heard that I've read that too people say well it shows they don't have any love in the message when people leave the message they never go after them so that that could be true it could be wrong it kind of depends you know it can go either way if God's leading us to go after we should go after but if God's tell us keep away because whatever Spirits are strong that could be it too yeah but I'm just saying if you've got a leading of the Lord that's the law of Christ to try to win somebody back and be your brother's keep where's Brother s he's usually here he hasn't been in the church there's some people that recently started coming I've been texting them almost every day where you at how you doing praying for you and they still don't come back they don't reply to me but guess what I'm GNA Be My Brother's Keeper yeah because on that day we're going to see who our Brother's Keeper was and I want to make sure my works are the right works all right so this is what a prophet would tell a church drenched in legalism be concerned about other people stop trying to make your own self-righteous be concerned about other people all quite a statement is it quite a statement okay we'll try to go on here praise the Lord verse uh verse six actually you know let's go to Romans 15 just a moment can we just this is a parallel passage it's the same Prophet writing the same thing here in Romans 15:1 maybe one of our brothers can read this for us here or sister if you like or maybe one of my children Romans 15:1 there's the same man under the same anointing of the Holy Ghost writing almost exactly the same thing but amen could you read that can you read uh 1512 and three brother we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification for even Christ pleases not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach he fell on me amen so Paul gives a scripture here of the Old Testament when you reach out to the lost here your the the reproaches are falling on you it's like you're going to somebody who's in in sin you're trying to help them out and that reproach kind of falls on you you gota in other words you got to deal with their sin and you're around that sin and it kind of you're kind of connected to it it makes you feel awful doesn't it but and look is it how many believe the Bible everybody believe the Bible I'm about to say something here if you're not pleasing or if you're pleasing yourself you won't go after people many times because you're protect you're fine you're just you're thinking you're somebody you're not worried about other people but what does the Bible say not to please yourself when you bear someone's bird and go after them and pray for them you're not pleasing yourself you're not interested in me me me or I I I it's them everybody see that in verse one that's verse one that's plain that's straight out of the Bible I don't need interpretation that's that's what the word says when you go after others you're not pleasing yourself you're not selfish so see selfishness only focuses on me me and my this is mine but the spirit of Christ focuses on helping others it reaches out to others okay thank you sir okay let's go back to Galatians or yeah five Galatians 6 I'm sorry Gans this is good tonight I hope you're being blessed praise God hope hope God's speaking to your heart about maybe somebody you can go after but you got to be spiritual gota be filled with the spirit and Mild you got to be mild and meek okay now verse six yeah that's where actually no I'm sorry let's go to verse U I'll go back to verse four because I got some quotes from Brother Bram said here and I want to bring a few scriptures in this is quite a statement verse four but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in any and not in another now look at that look at that statement rejoicing in himself I thought we're only supposed to rejoice in Christ brother Jess there's a balance to this when you're rejoicing in yourself listen you're rejoicing in the Christ you see flowing through you amen you're not saying oh my flesh is so wonderful I'm such a fantastic person no it's rejoicing in the Christ that you see in you look at brother Revelation 4 1961 oh praise be to God I guess it's appropriate for a minister to worship God from the pulpit with Thanksgiving and praise and honor my oh how real how it just Thrills my soul till I feel like I could scream and Run and Jump as high as I could because there's something in me that's changed me from what I was amen amen that's rejoicing in yourself amen thank God I'm not what I used to be praise God I'm not what I want to be but I'm not what I used to be that's rejoicing and thanking God in yourself you never see that I'm not what I ought to be not what I want to be but I know I've been changed from what I used used to be something has happened something has taken place Hallelujah so we we we can Rejoice here the Bible said after you prove your work now prove means to examine your work listen every one of you are doing a work for the Lord you're doing a work for the Lord in your family witnessing to them you're do to work for the Lord in your job you're do to work for the Lord here at the church you must examine what works am I doing examine your work Paul said prove your own work prove and work means business prove your business so your conscience is clear and you're do doing the work that God gave us to do well brother Jess I just sit in the chair no you don't you do more than that you're receiving the Eternal words of life amen you're helping the Holy Spirit to operate in the local church by pulling on the gift and other people get blessed because you're pulling on the spirit amen you everybody plays a part in here praise the Lord everybody that's a work amen it's a lot easier can disagree with me if you want but I believe you agree it's a lot easier to sit there and just say okay come on get through this sermon it's a lot easier to sit back and relax and and be uh and not have an active part in the service but it takes a pressing through it takes a sacrifice it takes a left for God to get into the spirit of the service and get something out of it can anybody agree with me on that it's easy to sit back and say uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhuh but it takes the real spirit of God the love of God to pull something out of God Amen and that way people get blessed and when they leave here they're closer to God Amen that's a work that's not easy that's a work amen that's a work that you and I have that we all should do Glory we've had such polers in here lately and it don't matter how loud you are we've had such polers in here lately I've had people tell me the all we talking about on the way to church you preached on I got an email the other day I said uh on Saturday last Saturday certain people were talking about certain things and I come and preach it on Sunday morning exactly what they were talking about so see I can't base it upon how loud it is or if people are shouting or crying or smiling or whatever more I got to just preach what the word says and be led by the spirit but if you're pulling you're G to get something from God God you think God's Gonna invite somebody to eat at his table and not bring them good food it's our attitude to the food if we have the right attitude God will serve us some great things praise the Lord but it's got to be our attit itude amen it's your approach to God brother says the Bible says that it's your approach to Christ amen that brings the results hallelujah it's important you have a work it's not just sitting in a chair it's communicating with God while they're preaching going yes Lord help the church bless those help me speak to me guide me I want to hear more of your word I want to receive your promises that's a work of God Amen to that see brother's rejoicing in I'm see I'm changed I'm not what I used to be I'm not what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be okay now every man's work will be manifested one day the Bible said that every man should bear his own burden and uh let's go to that let's go to 1 Corinthians 3 you you and I will receive a reward according to our labor that's what I'm saying if you labor hard sisters or brothers in church and you're not a preacher but you labor hard to pull on the word word God will reward you for that because that's what you're called to do and I'm called to preach if I Faithfully preach and labor and preach and try to pray study the Bible but R said a pastor's not supposed to tell you what's not in the Bible he's supposed to tell you what's in the Bible I thought what a good job because I don't have anything outside the Bible that's the perfect job for me amen it's the speakers in tongues and the prophesy and the word of wisdom and knowledge they're the ones that're supposed to get anointed to tell you things outside the word I'm supposed to tell you what's in the word thank you Jesus amen 1 Corinthians 3 Oh Glory well we're finally feeling good tonight amen thank you Jesus First Corinthians 3 got to press through and labor tonight amen all right verse five 35 who then is Paul and who is Apollos but but ministers by whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man I have planted poish water but God gave the increase can any man give any increase in your life no so don't give any glory to any man they can just plant in water but they can't make it grow who makes it grow God that's the next verse so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that WTH but God that gives the increase amen praise God we got to be careful not to exalt certain preachers right or certain people in our lives if they got gifts whatever not to exalt them they're just instruments God's the one who give us an area of growth God's the one that will make our spirit spiritual life grow again if it's dead he gives the increase now look at verse eight now he that planted and he that WTH are one so see all those preatures we're all one we're not divided we're all one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor so however much you work however much you labor that's how much reward you get for we are laborers together with God see we work with God we work with the Holy Spirit you're are God's husbandry we you are God's Building according to the grace of God which is given to me as a wise master builder look he's a wise master builder he's so wise Peter said I don't understand him all the time I've laid the foundation another man build it there on that every man take heed how he build it there upon that's why I try to build everything upon the word of God this is the word this the word this the word that's right verse 11 for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ is the Cornerstone the very Cornerstone of the foundation now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay double every man's work shall be made manifest look God's going to show all these preachers God's going to show all of us what we're made of God's going to reveal what everybody what everybody's work really is and I want my work to be find be found in humility and Holiness and godliness and sincerity that's why the numbers don't move me on Wednesday night I can preach to one two three four five adults and I don't care because I preached less than that before because you know what I know you might be watching me but I know somebody else is watching me he's watching me yes he'll judge every one of my Works he'll judge all my labors he's watching I'm not that picture but you know what I'm talking about the holy spirit's watching me and at the end of the day I got to go home I got say Lord was I faithful I believe I was faithful my heart's right before you I tried to stay with the word and I'll be rewarded or judged based upon how I did I want to build the right things okay every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is every man is Tried by fire so the trials you go through is the fire that you got to go through and it will try the ministry it'll try uh the gift in your life trials try you they're fire that's right so we know we've had we've had pretty good honeymoon time here at the church you know right every church has it but guess what there's fire coming yeah you've had a good honey anyone have a good honeymoon or Mountain toop experience lately guess what you've been all been on the mountain top for a few years guess what here comes a fiery trial coming pretty soon it's going to try and see what you're made out of yes if any man's work abide which Heath built upon he shall receive a reward see if your Works hold up to that fire and they remain your faith remains strong you'll get a reward if any man's work should be burned he shall suffer were lost but he himself should be saved yet so as by fire all right a statement there know ye not that ye are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are okay pause right there by God's grace how many like that by the grace of the Lord Every Man's work that means every man here not just preachers but every man every woman everybody has the work to do and we have to answer for our works what we did yes all right I want to let's go to 1 Timothy 1 this is another scripture here we're good on time 1 Timothy 1 verse2 I want to show you a time where Paul rejoices in himself I know it sounds really hard to say that but um if you understand it you're really thanking God for what you see God doing in your life and I'm going to show you the opposite of it and then we'll probably stop in just a little bit here okay 1 Timothy 1:12 to16 Mal are you there buddy are you there 1 Timothy 1:12 can you read that 12- 16 and that than Jesus Christ Our Lord who has enabled me but that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before blasphemer and a persecutor and urious but I obtained Mercy because I did in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceed abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all on suffering for pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him to life everas amen thank you buddy appreciate that here is Paul thanking God for what that God has strengthened me and put me in the ministry so see don't don't get it confused if I if somebody comes up here and says I want to thank the Lord for helping me be a preacher let me sing a song special or playing the piano or let me we got to make sure it's the right kind of Glory because Paul said I thank God that he strengthened me and put me in the ministry because before I was injured I was a blasphemer and God had mercy upon my life so when you say oh I want to thank the Lord he's made me what I am today because God had mercy on me that's the right kind of Thanksgiving that's the right kind of rejoicing in in yourself because it's really not yourself it's the victory God gave you over your flesh that's what we're talking about and notice he's I'm thankful for the grace of the exceeding Abundant Faith and love in Christ Jesus now notice in verse 16 Paul is a pattern how it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first look at this in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him to life Everlasting Glory that's awesome Amen Paul said I'm the first example and God's going to show a pattern what's a pattern it repeats you ever see AB pattern ab ab ab ab that's AB pattern ever seen a ABC pattern ABC ABC you ever seen the AABB pattern yeah that's first grade that okay but Paul said I'm the pattern so see Paul's pattern was this I was lost I was a blasphemer I hated Jesus but now I love him that's the pattern of all those who come after amen so if you hated the word or hated that before you're not alone that's the right pattern because now you love him amen the pattern is you despise it you don't love the word and now you love it that's the right AB pattern amen are you with me church he said I am the first of a pattern I fought the message I hated the message I hated the word and now I love it and now I labor for it and now God's G me strength to obey it that's glory in yourself amen thank you Jesus so it's it's wonderful to thank God for your overcoming your past life now let's look at the prideful part go to Luke 18 we're going to close this with my last scripture we're going to stop right there I'm even going to put stoping place right there in my notes so we'll just stop right there give you my word by the grace of the Lord trust you've enjoyed the word here tonight amen came out different than I thought you know as I study and pray I just put it down there and then holy Springs Holy Spirit brings it out a different way and I thought it would come amen Luke 18 verse 9 so we want to be thankful in ourselves in a humble way seeing the strength of God change our lives not in a prideful way so this is a beautiful example of someone who's humble and then someone who is thanking God in themselves in a prideful way there is a difference there is a great difference okay let's read this here by God's grace okay I'll read it Luke 889 and he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others let's just stop right there we know what's going to happen here right a Pharisee so a Pharisee is trusting in own righteousness and he's despising other we'll say it like this message Believers right because he's going to walk into the church he's going to go into the court of the men in the temple of Herod it's past the court of Gentiles past the court of women actually the court of women was the second level in the court of Herod they couldn't go down to the floor because this was for the court of men we're going to show that when we get to Ephesians but here's these men here in the they're in the the court of the men the Jewish men there's a Pharisee and there's a sinner but listen they're both Sinners right our flesh is all Sinners and he felt he was righteous and he despised other people in the church be careful God help us to love everybody in the church verse eight verse 10 two men went up into the temple to pray the one a Pharisee and the other a Publican Publican was in the I'm sorry Pharisees was in the religious realm Publican was in the Public Service realm a public service job something like a tax collector something along those type of jobs thater public serving the public verse 8 verse 11 chapter 18 verse 11 now the Pharisees stood and prayed within himself God I thank thee we just stop right there well so far he's got a good prayer God I thank you sounds pretty good so far but the rest of his words show what's really in his heart I thank you Jesus in other words we say today I thank you Lord that I am not as other men are thank you Lord I'm not like brother so and so thank you Lord I'm not like sister so and so extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Publican over here look at this man he's so critical he knows this Publican struggling he can see he's struggling he knows adulterers are struggling and he says oh I thank you Lord that I'm not like these vile people that's different than what Paul said what did Paul say I thank you Lord that I'm not like Paul amen you be church amen the Pharisees saying I'm thankful I'm not like them Paul said I'm thankful I'm not like I used to be yeah see that where's the righteous see he the Pharisees getting righteous by comparing himself to somebody else Paul's getting his righteous by comparing himself to Christ amen Christ took away my blasphemy Christ took away my sins injures Oh by Blas and he took away all that see how the see how they're both thankful but they're thankful for different things and they're thankful about and they're comparing themselves to different things they're both thankful they both come to church and say I thank the Lord tonight sister H amen I thank the Lord tonight sister Priscilla I surely thank the Lord tonight but what' you thank him for you thank him for not being like other people or did you thank him for saving you from yourself that's the right kind of thankfulness that's how a person glories in themselves the right way Lord I thank you I'm not like I used to be thank you for giving me the strength to overcome my errors now look at verse 12 he starts listing off his legalistic righteous duties I don't commit adultery I fast twice a week I give tith of everything I possess it's good to pay ties but it's bad to be prideful about it well I pay more ties than brother so and so I pay more ties than sister so and so that's sin that's pride and the Publican standing a far off look this Pharisee when he go over he's such a sinner he's such a evil man he's so holy I'm so much better than all these people at the church and the Publican standing a far off would not so much as as it lift up his eyes unto heaven so now we can see how this Pharisees praying he's like he's like oh thank you Lord thank you Lord I'm not like these oh thank you Lord I'm better than all these people but the humble the real humble person the one who's really in touch with God has got his face hidden from everybody praying in silence praying in in humility bowing Before the Throne of God standing AAR would not so much as lift his eyes into heaven was smoted upon his breast the pain was look look Church the pain was so sharp about his sins that he had to hit himself why do you keep doing this why do you keep falling short of the glory of God look how much uh pain sin caused him he would hit himself and say how can I do this again he smokes his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner so one thanking God thank God I've got all these holy things have done my life and I'm not like everybody else in the church so much better another one saying God just be merciful to me I failed you this week and what does Jesus say I tell you this man went down to his house Justified Justified means what declared righteous so the one who said I am a sinner be merciful god will make that person righteous but the person that says well look at All I Do Lord I'm I'm so glad I'm not like brother so and so or sister so and so that person leaves still in unrighteousness they're not justified for everyone that exalts himself shall be abased and he that humble himself shall be exalted let's stand to our feet praise God thank the Lord for the word of God Amen Lord willing we'll pick up at verse six next Wednesday or we'll see maybe Sunday night by God's grace praise God hallelujah how me love the Lord tonight praise God I certainly do I hope this was helpful this is what a prophet has to bring to people that struggle with legalism a church is taken you know just as a pastor from my view I haven't read through all these books but if if if and think about it you what would you say our church struggle just you know don't say it out loud but what would our church struggle with sexual lust passionate things smoking drinking legalism what would what would we think well I don't know everybody's life but listen the every Church battles something if Satan's not battling you then you're not the real church right brother M said that is that right you're not battling Satan then you're not the real Church everybody's going to battle so think about which which sins we're most susceptible to I'll be honest I think in the message I think most of us are susceptible to legalism trying to earn our way trying to feel like we're good enough comparing ourself well thank God I'm not like that prer thank God I'm better than that Pastor I got we I got a batt everybody's got a ballot right of course there are churches that struggle with these you know sexual passions and things like that but let's bow our heads tonight by God's grace I want to try to talk to the Lord a little bit here sister you just PR that song Thank you Lord for saving my soul with the right kind of gratitude tonight Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight Lord it is so refreshing to me to read over these words slowly normally Lord I preach from Genesis to Revelation and back to Psalms and back to the gospels and over to Isaiah lot of preachers do that Lord that's fine Lord I've felt led to go this way Lord it is so wonderful to see these things you've spoken tonight Lord through your word you promis to speak through teachers and pastors and evangelists and apostles and Prophets you promised to do it we believe you did it [Music] tonight Lord I think about many of the major points Lord we must fulfill the law of Christ and bear someone's burden bear the infirmities of of the weak see someone who's weak see someone who's struggling and go with meekness and a holy ghost filled life try to put that back in order Lord that's a hard thing to do it's easy to say Lord I'll be the first ad minute it's easy to preach it's easy to say but it's a hard thing to do because we got our schedules we got our fears Lord many times the fears of our flesh come in fears in our minds well what do they think of me well they think of being judgmental but Lord if we go in the spirit of mildness or [Music] meekness the Bible said we can be receive that way we won't be tempted to partake in the person's sin perhaps Lord [Music] uh Lord you're helping us Lord to learn how to say thank you the right way you shouldn't say thank you that I'm not like this person to church but thank you that I'm not like I used to be and Lord These Are Holy Bible words these words are thus sayeth the Lord to the Christian Lord God they mean something to us Lord help us to not take it lightly Lord I'm going to pray for the people Lord as I pray may you Minister Lord God if anyone needs repentance Lord if anyone needs restoration may you lead us to repent lead us to go find someone who can be restored Dear God [Music] Father in heaven we again Ask Lord God you take these words may they be planted in our hearts and Lord I'll just say like this I receive them tonight and I believe people in the church receive some seeds some promises tonight dear God may we water it Lord with Prayer by saying Lord you're going to help me fulfill the law of Christ you're going to help me bring forth the fruit of the spirit and I thank you for enabling me to do the the work you've called me to do church can we just thank the Lord for that a moment and say thank you Jesus can we just thank you Lord I Thank You Jesus I thank you Lord you'll do these things you promise to do it we water with praise we water with Thanksgiving Lord and help us Lord to live for others Jesus help us not to think more of ourselves like well we don't have time for people that fall we don't have time for the week Lord we should make time for the weak because that's what you did we were so weak Lord we couldn't carry our own burdens to the Cross so your son came down and took Jesse Smith sins upon him and then all all the saints here and each one down Through the Ages and he bore the burden all the way to Calvary he bore the burdens and the infirmities of the weak because he loved us and Lord we must go after others because we love them and fulfill the law of Christ Lord you knew these individuals would be here tonight you knew I'd be here you knew you'd bring out these

close your eyes for a minute what were you before you received the word what were you Paul was a blasphemer now think about what you were I'm going to say what I was Lord I was a fleshly passionate lustful man going from lust of the flesh lust of the eyes Pride thought I could do it on my own I was rejecting your word I was pushing off the holy spirit's conviction I was living how I thought I thought I was something and I was nothing thank you for your mercy Lord like Paul could say I was a leas of the Saints Church think about what you were maybe you just disinterested in God maybe you were just selfish and just interested in your own agenda not wanting to read the Bible not caring about correction not caring about the right Holiness life but something happened to you one day oh and church we can rejoice in that day how many remember that day church amen oh my Lord we rejoice in what you've done in us dear God just like Paul said of whom I'm chief of Sinners Lord I feel like I
