[29:14] their mind sorry about that
[29:16] I'll read verse 18 having the
[29:19] understanding darkened being alienated
[29:21] from the life of God through the
[29:24] ignorance that is in them because of the
[29:27] blindness of their heart now if you

[30:17] of Prayer
[30:17] just briefly here let's remember this
[30:19] young man in prayer here by God's grace
[30:21] he's battling a suicidal thoughts and
[30:25] has already attempted it a few times but
[30:28] God's mercy is more let's pray that
[30:31] he'll open his heart to God's mercy
[30:33] let's pray Heavenly Father we love you
[30:35] tonight father we read your word we were
[30:38] thankful Lord that our minds have been
[30:39] enlightened dear God by the Holy Spirit
[30:42] Lord to understand the things of God nor
[30:46] that's the parable you told about the
[30:48] good ground how they would understand
[30:50] hear the word and be converted dear God
[30:52] thank you for your amazing grace that we
[30:55] can hear it and not just hear it but
[30:56] understand that Lord God and apply it to
[30:59] our lives by humbling ourselves Lord and
[31:02] yoking ourselves with you lord god
[31:04] working with you lord as the scripture
[31:07] says in mark 16 you worked with the
[31:09] early apostles work with us here tonight
[31:12] Lord God work through me work through
[31:14] each and every person Lord God let your
[31:17] Holy Spirit's presence minister and help
[31:20] us Lord and we pray for this young man
[31:22] we don't know his name it's not
[31:23] important the Lord he's battling
[31:25] suicidal thoughts so father we ask in
[31:28] Jesus Christ's name that the Holy Spirit
[31:29] will make intercession for him Lord God
[31:32] send out your angels and Lord God to
[31:34] protect him Lord God we just pray Lord
[31:37] that his heart and he and his wife their
[31:39] hearts will softened to this glorious
[31:41] gospel show them your kindness
[31:43] show them your goodness Lord if he's got
[31:45] something against someone let him
[31:46] forgive him Lord God Lord for bitterness
[31:49] is a root Lord it's so hard to uproot
[31:51] god I just pray Lord if there's any
[31:53] bitterness in his heart he uproot it by
[31:56] the Holy Spirit he take your promises
[31:58] and received the free gift of salvation
[32:00] softened his heart and his wife's heart
[32:02] and what I just pray
[32:04] to be a great testimony of salvation
[32:07] Lord but of all above all let thy will
[32:10] be done we ask everything according to
[32:12] your will and we know you hear our
[32:13] prayers we're grateful for it your God
[32:15] we pray your minister here tonight in
[32:17] Jesus Christ II and the church said Amen
[32:21] god bless you be in see the praise God I
[32:22] do have some slides here so in case you
[32:25] pull it up here by God's grace and I'd
[32:32] like to get back to this series here on
[32:35] Ephesians it's gonna be hard to remember
[32:38] but back in 2015 I started the series on
[32:41] Galatians I think I preached about
[32:43] twenty or thirty sermons on that whole
[32:45] book we took it all the way through and
[32:48] I guess let me jump right to the reason
[32:53] here's the reason I preached it brother
[32:56] Graham had the vision and the physi told
[32:57] about the vision of going beyond the
[32:59] curtain of time and they asked him about
[33:01] when he'll be asked about when he would
[33:03] be judged and he said Jesus will first
[33:05] come to you and then you'll be judged
[33:08] and then these people are your converts
[33:09] that you've led and he said you mean by
[33:11] being a leader that will judge me yes is
[33:13] every leader have to be judged like that
[33:15] yes what about Paul he'll have to be
[33:17] judged by his and then he said well if
[33:20] his group goes in so will mine because I
[33:22] preach exactly the same word that's it I
[33:25] said where he baptized in Jesus name I
[33:28] did too I preached and millions screamed
[33:30] out all at once were resting on that and
[33:33] I thought my if I only had only knew
[33:35] this before I could come here I would
[33:37] make people come here they can't afford
[33:39] to miss this why looky here so my
[33:43] thought behind that was if we're resting
[33:45] on Paul's gospel we need to know what he
[33:48] said in all of his letters because Paul
[33:50] called this the whole Council of God so
[33:53] that's my inspiration kind of behind
[33:55] this series like I said it's been since
[33:59] September of 2018 when I last preached
[34:01] on this series but I felt led to kind of
[34:03] pick it up and if you remember the last
[34:06] ones I the last messages I'm preaching
[34:10] on was in chapter 4 with the fivefold
[34:12] ministry now remember the scripture
[34:16] gives seven Ben
[34:18] it's of the fivefold ministry and then
[34:20] we looked at the attacks on the five
[34:22] fold five hold ministry and the reality
[34:26] of the home church and of course that
[34:29] led into all the Jeffersonville things
[34:30] that we just got done preaching the
[34:31] series I'll improve all things so it all
[34:33] kind of just flowed together and just so
[34:36] you know I work it on my next video it
[34:38] should be out Saturday about the seven
[34:40] mistakes of the Jeffersonville movement
[34:43] I'm not going to name the brother's
[34:44] names but I'm gonna put those false
[34:46] doctrines those seven false doctrines
[34:48] I'm gonna put them in there because the
[34:49] people need it I er texted a couple
[34:52] pastors and they need it because they
[34:54] just battle it you know there's this
[34:57] this Jeffersonville movement has
[34:58] millions of influencers right they
[35:00] influence millions and so people need
[35:03] the truth and Jesus said the truth will
[35:05] set you free praise God
[35:06] now here's the member here's the seven
[35:09] benefits of the fivefold ministry the
[35:12] fivefold ministry equips the Saints with
[35:15] the tools they need to be the bride it
[35:18] works the ministry it builds up the body
[35:22] or helps them to grow up a church keep
[35:25] in mind if people don't have the true
[35:27] fivefold ministry they can't benefit
[35:29] from these things this means those who
[35:32] attack the real fivefold ministry
[35:34] they're lacking some if not all of these
[35:37] the Saints aren't equipped they're not
[35:41] working in the ministry and they're not
[35:43] being but they're not growing in Christ
[35:44] they're actually becoming more immature
[35:48] he imagined people with sent message
[35:50] message pews for 10 20 years and they
[35:53] become spiritual babies they're just as
[35:56] arrogant prideful angry bitter sensual
[36:00] addicted to porn and evil things sports
[36:04] like we said they love those things more
[36:06] they love the things of God but see the
[36:10] fivefold ministry brings agreement see
[36:13] believers as Christians and pastors and
[36:15] saints we can agree on the truths of
[36:18] God's Word and provide and Paul said
[36:22] it's the knowledge which means the
[36:24] precise truth unto the portion of the
[36:28] maturity of Jesus Christ
[36:30] so whatever Porsche
[36:32] and each Holy Ghost field person can
[36:33] achieve the fivefold ministry helps them
[36:36] reach that portion
[36:38] whether it's remember Jesus said it's
[36:40] either a 30-fold fruitfulness sixty fold
[36:44] or a hundredfold so the true fivefold
[36:47] ministry helps you reach your god-given
[36:49] potential amen hallelujah
[36:52] the sixth thing it learns to speak the
[36:55] truth in love yeah that's why I like how
[36:58] Billy Paul wrote me that letters that I
[36:59] can feel your love did I share that with
[37:01] you brother Billy Paul wrote me back I
[37:02] wrote him a letter he wrote me back and
[37:04] he said I can feel your love even though
[37:06] you're trying to bring correction he
[37:07] said most people don't do it would love
[37:08] but you do it with love amen I like that
[37:12] we can say the truth but we say it in
[37:15] love and then seventh and Paul said it's
[37:18] like a body the fivefold ministry
[37:21] fitly joins the body together right it
[37:24] places the body parts and but Christ is
[37:27] the head praise God
[37:28] I might be the I might be the toe but at
[37:31] least I'm on that body praise God I
[37:33] might be the skin on the bottom of that
[37:35] foot but at least I'm part of that body
[37:37] amen you got a and that's what the
[37:40] fivefold ministry does helps you find
[37:42] your position in the body of Christ so
[37:45] see those and I'll say I just those in
[37:47] the false movements and these rumors
[37:49] we've been preaching on we looked at
[37:50] believe the sign and jeffersonville
[37:52] false teaching those if they're if
[37:54] they're if they're against the fivefold
[37:56] ministry then by the word they have to
[37:59] be lacking some of these truths there's
[38:02] no way they can reach the full maturity
[38:05] of a Christian without the real truth of
[38:08] God's Word amen and that's why it's so
[38:11] important that we don't add one word or
[38:13] take one word away praise God and never
[38:16] the millions were shouted out we're
[38:18] resting on their same n the fivefold
[38:21] ministry the Prophet the pastor the
[38:23] teacher the evangelists amen we're
[38:26] resting on there say men
[38:28] I'll tell ya but without this they must
[38:31] be lacking something because remember
[38:33] the Bible said add to your faith and add
[38:36] well without the fivefold ministry
[38:38] how can it be added it's very difficult
[38:40] praise God I imagine they have very few
[38:43] now that Paul told us in this chapter
[38:45] wrote ephesians 4 that without it
[38:49] they're no longer they're no longer
[38:51] mature so they become immature right
[38:54] they become tossed from one idea to
[38:58] another from one tragedy to another from
[39:01] one pleasure to another less they're
[39:03] just tossed or agitated all over the
[39:05] place they're carried which means driven
[39:08] in doubt hesitation different opinions
[39:11] from one opinion to another opinion
[39:13] and they're deceived this is what we see
[39:15] a lot they're letters stray they just go
[39:18] deeper into false doctrines deeper in
[39:20] their false doctrines all over all over
[39:22] the world right but the fivefold
[39:25] ministry protects you from this Paul
[39:28] says you're no longer this we're
[39:30] supposed to be real mature Christians
[39:32] amen now then we looked at the attacks
[39:35] on the fivefold ministry and the reality
[39:37] of the home church praise God now I want
[39:40] to review here
[39:42] I think Scofield said there's four but I
[39:46] kind of put these lasts he separated the
[39:49] walk from the warfare but I just kind of
[39:51] put those together but you could you
[39:53] know you could put them at you could
[39:54] make it four themes you know four themes
[39:56] but we've preached on the first theme
[39:58] the believers exalted position in Christ
[40:00] I'm getting this from Scofield the one
[40:02] body of Christ both Jew and Gentile now
[40:04] that's one of the mysteries of the
[40:06] gospel Paul mentions 12 mysteries that's
[40:09] one of them how the Jew and Gentile they
[40:11] used to be separated by a wall but that
[40:14] middle wall partitions been broken down
[40:16] and now we're one body in Christ Jesus
[40:18] amen and the Jew now is called the
[40:21] remnant there's going to be a small
[40:22] remnant of Jews because the bride must
[40:25] be made out of every nation from every
[40:28] every nation and tongue from around the
[40:30] world amen she's got to be a fully a
[40:33] full Gentile bride right a full bouquet
[40:35] bride we'd a amen
[40:38] glory and she the Jew is just one of
[40:41] those
[40:42] Nations and now we've been looking at
[40:45] the walk and the warfare so see chapter
[40:47] four we looked at the fivefold ministry
[40:49] is just getting into the walk of the
[40:52] believer
[40:53] so the believer can't even walk straight
[40:55] without the fine gifts of preaching
[40:57] praise God because if not they're
[40:59] immature right they're tossed they're
[41:01] agitated of all these problems without
[41:04] the real receiving of the Word of God
[41:06] amen
[41:07] now let's get a little more background
[41:09] on Ephesus just briefly here I like to
[41:11] just background Ephesus you know there's
[41:14] a nice there's a nice project online
[41:16] called the Bible project and these
[41:18] people do a lot of research and they do
[41:19] a video on every book and so I pulled
[41:22] some thoughts from there I thought that
[41:23] would really help you and their
[41:25] historical as well so acts 19 has the
[41:30] story of how Paul came to Ephesus you
[41:32] probably remember you know Apollo's was
[41:35] there teaching them he was mining the
[41:37] scriptures but they weren't born again
[41:39] they only knew the gospel or the baptism
[41:41] of John the Baptist
[41:42] well Apollo sleeves for a while Paul
[41:45] comes in he says have you received the
[41:47] Holy Ghost since you believe they're
[41:49] like we did we know there was the Holy
[41:50] Ghost that's how I was brother right I
[41:52] was in the assembly of God and I didn't
[41:53] even know there was the Holy Ghost amen
[41:56] I was baptized I was in the Presbyterian
[41:58] then for a while but I didn't even know
[42:00] there's a real Holy Ghost baptism amen
[42:03] where the life of Jesus stayed with you
[42:06] permanently praise God not temporarily
[42:09] like we looked at last Wednesday night
[42:10] with the soul but it stays permanently
[42:13] and they said we didn't even know that
[42:14] he says what were you baptized Oh John's
[42:17] baptism of repentance so he preached to
[42:19] them the word they got baptized he laid
[42:21] hands on them and they received the Holy
[42:23] Ghost and they spake in tongues and
[42:25] prophesied as the Spirit gave them
[42:27] utterance amen
[42:29] how many were there twelve was that a
[42:31] megachurch no but in God's eyes we might
[42:34] say it was a mega church full of power
[42:36] praise God it was a mega power church
[42:38] amen because my dad says five people
[42:41] with the Holy Ghost it's more than five
[42:43] hundred without it high praise God just
[42:47] getting by people born again will do
[42:49] more for our city and do more for a
[42:52] church than five hundred that aren't
[42:53] born again
[42:54] that's right now this is true I got I'll
[42:58] have some history later from Wikipedia
[43:00] and it agrees with what brother Branham
[43:02] said in the church age book but emphasis
[43:05] was a huge city it was I think the
[43:07] second most important city outside of
[43:09] Rome in that day in Paul's day and it
[43:12] was the epicenter of worship for all the
[43:14] Greek and Roman gods he's remember when
[43:16] Paul went in their church remember he
[43:18] started preaching in healing and then
[43:20] the people got so fired up they brought
[43:22] all their books of enchantment remember
[43:24] that and they threw all their books
[43:26] together in a big old fire and burned it
[43:28] and then later the next chapter they're
[43:29] arguing and they almost killed Paul
[43:31] because he's preaching against Diana
[43:33] this place was it was full of the
[43:36] worship of women that's about where
[43:37] we're at today right the worship of
[43:40] women today they were so full of their
[43:43] gods and it was it was such a place of
[43:45] prosperity my it's a lot like later
[43:48] Tasya praise God
[43:49] and Paul Minister Minister therefore at
[43:52] least that's wrong at least three years
[43:54] I put the wrong number there because in
[43:56] acts 20 it says he was there for three
[44:00] years
[44:01] yeah he warned them with tears so I do I
[44:04] do
[44:05] actually apologize I just you forgive me
[44:07] he warned them for three years with
[44:10] tears about wolves that would enter in
[44:12] yeah that's ex 2031 he said now
[44:16] therefore watch therefore watch and
[44:19] remember that by the space of three
[44:20] years I ceased not to warn every one
[44:23] night and day with tears not now Paul
[44:29] writes this letter not quit according to
[44:31] Scofield Paul writes this letter after
[44:36] he leaves Ephesus remember he cried and
[44:38] he said that I've taught you the whole
[44:40] Council of God they all cry he goes off
[44:43] he know he's got to go to Rome to die
[44:44] Jesus has showed him where he's gonna
[44:46] die
[44:47] what a privilege who Jesus said I've got
[44:50] to show many things that he must suffer
[44:52] for my sake look at that the suffering
[44:55] was great but so were the revelations
[44:57] great amen
[44:59] we always say we want greater
[45:00] revelations but you know what comes with
[45:01] that suffering praise God
[45:04] Paul's a great example he's third heaven
[45:07] he went to the third
[45:08] my vision and he couldn't speak about
[45:10] some of the things he said but he also
[45:12] had some of the greatest buffeting some
[45:14] of the greatest suffering so many times
[45:16] Hertz with great revelation comes great
[45:19] humility and great suffering so years
[45:23] later in fact four years later after he
[45:27] wrote the letter to the Galatians he
[45:29] writes this letter to the Ephesians and
[45:32] he writes it from Rome from prison so
[45:35] this is a prison epistle we might call
[45:37] it nine now what's interesting - I just
[45:41] wonder this is another one from the
[45:43] Bible project I like they just divide it
[45:45] in two I showed you a Scofield themes
[45:48] right he had different themes but he the
[45:51] Bible project divides it in half the
[45:53] first three chapters are the gospel
[45:55] story which is really beautiful right
[45:57] you're chosen in Christ before the
[45:58] foundation world Jew and Gentile the
[46:00] walls been broken down now were one body
[46:02] in Christ we're building up in the
[46:04] building of God but then in chapter four
[46:06] or five and six
[46:07] he starts dealing with the church so the
[46:09] first half is the Gospel story the Jesus
[46:12] story and now the second half is our
[46:14] story the bride story I like I like that
[46:18] amen Christ story and now the bride
[46:22] story Christ in the bride amen and once
[46:25] they start with the preaching the
[46:27] fivefold ministry praise God that's what
[46:29] we see now I want to pull now some
[46:35] quotes from the church age book by man
[46:38] taught about Ephesus he he quotes Jesus
[46:41] where he says you must repent and come
[46:43] back to God and do your first works and
[46:45] what is the way back the way is the way
[46:47] of repentance if a sinner has to come to
[46:50] God by way of repentance then the
[46:52] lukewarm or backslider
[46:54] will have to repent that much more
[46:59] repent
[47:00] bring forth fruits meet for repentance
[47:03] prove it by your life if you do not
[47:06] repent to God I will remove your
[47:08] lampstand now how many have seen in your
[47:12] church or other churches people that are
[47:14] definitely lukewarm or backslidden
[47:17] and they're there there's no magic pill
[47:20] or there's no magic
[47:22] Minister can I say like that there's no
[47:24] magic easy fix for someone to get out of
[47:29] a lukewarm back sitting condition the
[47:31] only way to get out is to repent and
[47:34] change your life amen
[47:37] it's good to come to church it's
[47:39] necessary to come to church we just saw
[47:41] the benefits of the fivefold ministry
[47:43] but if we don't bring Church to our
[47:45] house on Sunday night or Monday morning
[47:48] it did it's not going to do us any good
[47:50] praise God we're going to remain in a
[47:53] lukewarm Backson and condition praise
[47:55] God
[47:56] but the reality of it is if we want to
[47:58] get back with God we've got to repent we
[48:01] have to do the same thing we did at the
[48:02] beginning
[48:03] praise God but we find very few people I
[48:06] say like this very few churches that are
[48:08] able to keep that fire but there will be
[48:10] some praise God amen and I want to be
[48:13] one of those some praise the Lord amen
[48:16] that little remnant that little bride a
[48:18] man that little flock who God has given
[48:20] the kingdom to and the only way to do it
[48:23] is by your life the daily life he said
[48:32] certainly a church and that can
[48:33] she can't give light to the world it's
[48:35] light it's turn to darkness God will
[48:37] take them away
[48:37] it's I'm sorry God will then take away
[48:40] its faithful messenger and its faithful
[48:41] shepherds and leave them to themselves
[48:43] they will go on talking about
[48:45] Christianity but be reffed
[48:47] of it repent quickly don't hesitate now
[48:50] here's the history we'll get to this a
[48:52] moment evidently Ephesus did hesitate
[48:55] for her lifespan was not very long the
[48:58] glory of God decreased ever so rapidly
[49:01] it was not long into the city was in
[49:03] ruins
[49:04] its glorious temple became a shapeless
[49:07] mass the land became a marsh inhabited
[49:10] by waterfowl the population was gone
[49:12] except for a few unbelievers in a
[49:14] squalid village and if you know the
[49:16] history they kept rebuilding it and what
[49:18] kept happening destruction they rebuild
[49:20] it destruction rebuild it destruction
[49:22] they kept being destroyed and that's
[49:25] because they never repented they never
[49:27] got back with God there was not even one
[49:33] Christian left the lamp was rent from
[49:37] its place now imagine that church twelve
[49:39] Holy Ghost field Saints brother.a
[49:40] they're jumping out of the water they're
[49:42] praising God maybe they're falling on
[49:44] their knees the church starts out with
[49:46] so much power but then Jesus gives a
[49:50] message now that was had to bend around
[49:52] the 50s right 80 54 will say now John
[49:56] gives the message forty years later on
[49:59] 80 90 so 40 years later he says turn
[50:02] back repair get right with God and with
[50:06] church we got a look at our lives we got
[50:08] if we've been in the message decades
[50:10] that this I'm coming up on my second
[50:11] decade here next year will be my second
[50:13] decade in the message if we're not
[50:16] careful we begin to backside and get
[50:18] lukewarm but we've got to renew our love
[50:21] for Christ by doing the same things we
[50:24] did when we first got saved hey man
[50:27] it's beautiful not even one Christian
[50:31] left at one time Malachi emphasis was
[50:34] sprawling with great with Christians
[50:35] amen
[50:36] Paul was there the prophet of God was
[50:38] there people were burning up there
[50:40] things that burning up all their evil
[50:42] dirty magazines right burning up all
[50:44] their getting rid of all their cellphone
[50:47] the Jesus and all kinds of things throw
[50:49] it away all their their evil things get
[50:51] rid of everything but pretty soon they
[50:53] let some of it back in and Jesus said
[50:57] repent or I'm taking the preachers out
[50:59] or I'm taking the whole church out no to
[51:03] us and Mike's now you're gonna see it to
[51:06] us it might seem like a slow process but
[51:08] with God time is very time goes very
[51:10] fast right with God to us it may seem
[51:13] like it's shorter now here's the
[51:15] Wikipedia history when Augustus became
[51:17] Emperor in 27 BC that's 27 years before
[51:20] Christ the most important change was
[51:22] when he made Ephesus the capital of
[51:25] proconsular Asia which covered Western
[51:27] Asia Minor instead of Pergamum Ephesus
[51:30] then entered into an era of what
[51:32] prosperity becoming both the seat of the
[51:35] governor and of the major centre of
[51:37] Commerce according to Strabo is the
[51:39] second importance and size only to Rome
[51:41] this was a massive City this was a huge
[51:45] city that had potential to serve God
[51:48] many people needed to hear the gospel so
[51:51] what God sent them a hook-nosed you with
[51:54] a message of Jesus Christ how did a man
[51:57] that used to persecute Christians God
[52:00] changed his heart and sends a prophet
[52:02] who's on fire in the city to create more
[52:05] people on fire amen and they just got a
[52:08] few little churches started right start
[52:10] with 12 and the little churches spring
[52:12] out up over the city
[52:14] now notice Church this was established
[52:18] around 80 I could actually look it up
[52:20] real quick
[52:20] acts 19 Scofield is nice as a year for
[52:25] every chapter it was 80 54 oh my memory
[52:28] serves me correct my and eighty fifty
[52:30] six so those were the years Paul was
[52:32] there 1854 86 56 now so that's when the
[52:36] church started so at 210 years later 210
[52:41] years later the entire city was
[52:43] destroyed now look that might seem like
[52:47] a long time nuts but with God one days
[52:49] with God has what thousand years very
[52:52] short time and the warning came from
[52:56] John's letter revelation chapter 2 the
[52:59] warning came in 89
[53:00] about 40 years after the church started
[53:03] because 40 years is like what a
[53:05] generation right but look how merciful
[53:09] God was that's why brother ray I believe
[53:11] the rapture could be anytime but I also
[53:12] could believe it could be longer ways
[53:14] away because if God's mercy is this if
[53:18] God was this merciful to the Ephesians
[53:20] he may be that merciful to the later see
[53:23] in church age no man no man knows the
[53:26] day or the hour right we have dreams
[53:28] about it like brother any man has dreams
[53:29] about it that's wonderful we're all
[53:31] looking for the coming of the Lord we
[53:33] watch we watch Russia we watch a Israel
[53:36] we watch all these things but no man
[53:38] really knows the day so this city from
[53:44] that warning a Tosa 8090 so take about a
[53:49] hundred years away from about a hundred
[53:51] sixty years after that letter from John
[53:53] the city was completely destroyed this
[53:57] marked the decline of the city's
[53:59] splendor however Emperor Constantine the
[54:01] Great rebuilt much of the city and
[54:02] erected new public baths let's remember
[54:06] that Church God is not mocked whatever a
[54:10] man sews that Willie reap this church
[54:13] failed to repair at some point probably
[54:16] not though let me say this the Holy
[54:18] Ghost filled Saints there they were
[54:21] always on fire for God because the Holy
[54:23] Ghost filled say is sealed unto the day
[54:26] of his Redemption praise God
[54:28] hey you think Church you think Paul ever
[54:32] back slid and got so lukewarm that
[54:34] people wondered if he was saved do you
[54:35] think Paul overdid that you think a real
[54:38] Holy Ghost filled Saint would ever get
[54:40] so far back slidden and so lukewarm that
[54:42] you wonder I wonder if this guy's even
[54:44] got the Holy Ghost no way no way because
[54:48] the Holy Ghost inside of you it hungers
[54:51] for the Word of God it lives by the Word
[54:53] of God well Graham said if a man whose
[54:56] Holy Ghost filled or woman can't get to
[54:58] church and hear the word he said they
[55:00] feel like they're perishing amen praise
[55:03] God see if they can't get to that
[55:04] fivefold ministry to hear the word of
[55:07] God that Jesus said Jesus sent that
[55:09] fivefold ministry amen
[55:11] that was his plan not all plan that was
[55:14] his plan praise
[55:16] but this church those 12 and all the
[55:19] Holy Ghost hood Saints no doubt they
[55:21] serve God but church it was the next
[55:23] generation and the next generation some
[55:26] people started rising up leading the
[55:27] church that weren't born again right and
[55:31] pretty soon they didn't repent they
[55:33] didn't repent pretty soon you've got
[55:34] just sanctified people and pretty soon
[55:36] they start leaving pretty soon just got
[55:38] just the five people and pretty soon
[55:40] after 116 more years God said I'm done
[55:42] with it
[55:43] he sends the Gauss in there destroys the
[55:45] whole city not now it does not mean that
[55:53] she could not have repented it does not
[55:55] mean that we cannot repent we can but it
[55:58] must be quickly it must be a true heart
[56:03] cried to God in sorrow and then God will
[56:05] restore the glory shall come again ha ha
[56:08] ha hey thank the Lord amen Sosa's about
[56:12] 160 years after that letter John wrote
[56:16] the letter
[56:17] Jesus had sent it to this churches he
[56:19] sent it and they had to repair and
[56:21] program says in the church age book
[56:22] apparently they didn't repent because
[56:25] God destroyed the whole city he took out
[56:29] the preachers he took out all his
[56:30] faithful men of God's women of God took
[56:32] them all out he destroyed the city now
[56:39] this is what we
[56:40] we need this we need someone we need
[56:42] church members we need believers that
[56:44] will quickly repent but they won't they
[56:47] won't drag it on for week after week
[56:50] well I need to do this but uh I know I
[56:52] should do this we don't need that we
[56:57] need people that are desperate to get
[56:59] right with God amen we need people that
[57:02] want to quickly feel God's presence
[57:05] again praise God that's what Jesus said
[57:09] new the first works through it quickly
[57:11] or else I'll come and take that
[57:13] lampstand that's right that's the kind
[57:18] that's the kind of believers that we
[57:20] need to be today praise God now let's go
[57:24] to verse 17 our text here now I'm kind
[57:26] of just warming up here now I'm free to
[57:29] about half of half an hour more okay I
[57:31] want to really I want to preach the hour
[57:33] we got kids I got to go to school and I
[57:35] got to go to school in the morning so
[57:37] I'm trying to watch it by God's grace I
[57:39] am trying now verse 17 this I say
[57:42] therefore and testify in the Lord that
[57:44] ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[57:47] walk in the vanity of their mind amen
[57:50] Paul's talking to the churches that had
[57:53] that were Holy Ghost filled he said
[57:56] don't walk with the vanity of a Gentile
[57:59] mind now let's look at some of these
[58:02] Greek words I don't do Greek very much
[58:03] for the Ray but I and when I did this
[58:06] study I just started pulling Greek word
[58:07] after Greek word I think it would be
[58:09] helpful for us to understand praise God
[58:11] so it's not to be intellectual it's just
[58:13] to kind of give us a different look at
[58:15] it because that's insurance we read over
[58:17] that we're like mom yeah but when you
[58:19] see a Greek definition it can give you a
[58:21] synonym right or another word it might
[58:24] trigger something in your mind like
[58:27] maybe you've heard it on a sermon this
[58:28] week or maybe something maybe somehow
[58:30] the Holy Spirit can bring out a
[58:31] different meaning to minister to your
[58:33] heart now now I want to bring this out
[58:39] because last we've been preaching on
[58:41] five sermons on the Soul recently he
[58:44] says don't walk as other Gentiles walk
[58:47] in the vanity of their mind now what did
[58:49] I tell you last week Church we looked at
[58:51] this a few weeks ago you and I
[58:54] in the mine mostly right we live up here
[58:56] are conscious our mind right and brother
[58:59] and says you get calls from your body
[59:02] feed me feed me and he says you get
[59:04] calls from your soul give me fellowship
[59:05] with God give me fellowship with God but
[59:07] we're living right here many times right
[59:09] but then David said when I laid on my
[59:12] bed I commune with my soul I knew yeah
[59:18] now you brother says your soul is your
[59:20] nature right so it's what you are it's
[59:24] what's gonna drive you either faith or
[59:26] unbelief right or we know either the
[59:27] baptism Holy Ghost or not born again so
[59:31] he says don't walk in a vain mind don't
[59:34] walk don't make decisions from this so
[59:37] what he's saying is we got to walk from
[59:39] our soul praise God we got to live from
[59:42] the nature of God that God has placed in
[59:45] our soul praise God that's why we got to
[59:48] get up and pray or if you for you maybe
[59:50] say up late night and pray and get your
[59:52] direction for the next day if you're not
[59:54] going to get into direction for the next
[59:56] day in the morning you better get it at
[59:57] night amen you it because that you're to
[1:00:00] walk in some way and you want to walk
[1:00:03] from your soul not in the vanity of your
[1:00:06] mind and church he's not telling this to
[1:00:10] sinner's he's talking to Ephesian
[1:00:11] Christians amen
[1:00:12] this is Christians because we know we
[1:00:15] like Paul knows there's wise and foolish
[1:00:17] he writes about it in the next chapter
[1:00:19] the wise redeemed the time the foolish
[1:00:22] squander the time so that's what he's
[1:00:25] saying here do not walk in the vanity of
[1:00:28] your mind on what's been and he mean it
[1:00:29] means perverseness so don't walk in a
[1:00:33] perverted mind see it's perverted to
[1:00:35] hold grudges that's a perverted thing
[1:00:38] it's perverted to be selfish right I
[1:00:41] gotta have my way in I disagree with
[1:00:44] them and it's perverted to live in lust
[1:00:46] that's perverted it's perverted to run
[1:00:50] after money right and let greed rule
[1:00:53] your life that's perversion it's lacking
[1:00:57] spiritual vigor praise God amen see
[1:01:02] Church because whatever you meditate on
[1:01:04] that's what you become Solomon said as I
[1:01:07] thought of my heart
[1:01:07] so I was Paul says do not walk with the
[1:01:13] perverted mindset
[1:01:14] make sure your thought life is holy now
[1:01:19] we're getting into the walk of a
[1:01:20] believer oh we love chapter one
[1:01:23] oh you're sitting in heavenly places huh
[1:01:24] we love that you're chosen in Christ
[1:01:27] before the nation where all glory we
[1:01:29] love that but now he's starting to get
[1:01:31] down to your daily life now he's saying
[1:01:35] don't be like the other James house
[1:01:37] because remember they're walking around
[1:01:39] they're statues to Diana there's no
[1:01:40] doubt meet here sacrifice to idols
[1:01:42] there's prostitutes here their sports
[1:01:44] games there there's an Olympics there
[1:01:46] Paul saw the Olympics there those
[1:01:47] stations in Ephesus and all these places
[1:01:49] all over let all these attractions just
[1:01:52] like today is a prosperous economy and
[1:01:55] he's saying do not walk with the
[1:01:57] perverted mind do not be perverted have
[1:02:01] a thought life that's focused on God so
[1:02:05] you cannot walk with a perverted mind
[1:02:09] now look what he says next in verse 18
[1:02:12] now look he says having the
[1:02:18] understanding darkened so these people
[1:02:21] didn't understand the Word of God oh
[1:02:24] that's beautiful because I chapter 5 he
[1:02:29] says we understand the will of the good
[1:02:31] that's right so in 5:17 you don't have
[1:02:33] to turn there but wherefore be ye not
[1:02:35] unwise but understanding what the will
[1:02:38] of the Lord is amen glory so he says the
[1:02:42] other Gentiles will understand God's
[1:02:44] will but he says you know I Christians
[1:02:48] we need to understand God's will now I'm
[1:02:52] going to preach a whole I'm gonna write
[1:02:54] a whole Lord willing a whole chapter on
[1:02:56] that mystery of the will of God and so
[1:03:00] I've been studying on that let me just
[1:03:01] give you a little bit of a foretaste
[1:03:02] here of glory divine here let me excuse
[1:03:04] because it's the Word of God Paul says
[1:03:07] in 2nd Timothy 1 you were called with
[1:03:09] the holy calling it is God's will that
[1:03:13] we walk holy so the way Paul says God
[1:03:18] has made known to us the mystery of his
[1:03:21] will
[1:03:22] God's will is for us to live a holy life
[1:03:25] and as we walk that holy life God
[1:03:29] progressively reveals the next part of
[1:03:32] his will for our lives do you think
[1:03:34] Joseph in the Old Testament knew after
[1:03:37] those dreams for the Ray he was going to
[1:03:39] be sold as a slave to Egypt do you think
[1:03:41] he did no church some of sometimes the
[1:03:44] will of God
[1:03:45] contains tragedies in it but as long as
[1:03:50] he lived a holy life amen
[1:03:51] haha as long as he could turn down
[1:03:53] Potiphar's wife amen glory as long as he
[1:03:58] can walk in the holiness of God then God
[1:04:00] would keep opening up doors that he
[1:04:02] could keep walking in the will of God
[1:04:04] for his life amen
[1:04:07] think about it remember Abraham Lincoln
[1:04:10] he was supposed to be a woodsman and
[1:04:12] people got upset at Abraham Lincoln
[1:04:13] brother ray because he was reading books
[1:04:15] he tried to chop and read books like
[1:04:17] this and people said what what are you
[1:04:19] doing you educated man or whatever you
[1:04:22] higher what do you think you are a
[1:04:23] scholar you're supposed to be a woodsman
[1:04:25] and you just sit there but he was drawn
[1:04:27] to it it was part of his calling amen
[1:04:30] as long as he lived a separated life and
[1:04:32] as long as he loved the Word of God God
[1:04:35] was going to just open then became a
[1:04:36] mayor and then become a governor and
[1:04:39] then become president to help set the
[1:04:41] Negroes free praise God that was part of
[1:04:44] the will of God for his life yeah so the
[1:04:49] thing to do is stay holy walk in
[1:04:51] holiness in fear of God and God will
[1:04:54] open up every door for your life amen
[1:04:57] hallelujah that's been fresh to me thank
[1:05:01] the Lord
[1:05:03] see but Jen's house with perverted minds
[1:05:06] they don't understand the word their
[1:05:09] understanding is darkened being
[1:05:11] alienated from the life of God through
[1:05:16] the ignorance that is in them so I don't
[1:05:18] they know God's life because they're
[1:05:19] ignorant of it I remember Romans 1 the
[1:05:23] Romans 1 says the law of God is in every
[1:05:25] heart so see they're willingly ignorant
[1:05:27] of it willingly on purpose they just
[1:05:31] don't want to talk about it you ever
[1:05:33] meet anybody like that
[1:05:35] they don't want to talk about don't want
[1:05:36] to hear about it don't know nothing
[1:05:37] about it they're willingly ignorant of
[1:05:40] the life of God which has to be the
[1:05:43] baptism Holy Ghost what is the life of
[1:05:45] God except the Holy Ghost baptism what
[1:05:47] is it it has to be they they alienate
[1:05:51] they separate themselves from the
[1:05:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't go
[1:05:55] to churches that preach the Holy Ghost
[1:05:56] they don't pray like they want to only
[1:05:58] ghosts they just alienate themselves
[1:06:00] away from the real life of God but you
[1:06:03] and I should have a lien it ourselves we
[1:06:05] should alienate ourselves from the world
[1:06:06] and put ourselves in the holiest of
[1:06:08] Holies praise God that's where we should
[1:06:10] be alienated praise God in God's
[1:06:13] presence
[1:06:14] yeah alienate means to shut out from
[1:06:16] one's fellowship in intimacy see they
[1:06:20] shut themselves out from God's life the
[1:06:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they're
[1:06:25] ignorant because of their own hard
[1:06:26] hearts ignorance means a lack of
[1:06:28] knowledge they don't even want to know
[1:06:31] right because of the blindness of their
[1:06:34] heart somebody's he's covering with a
[1:06:36] cast how many got calluses on their
[1:06:38] hands from work see they don't feel it
[1:06:41] as much anymore they can't feel it
[1:06:43] let's church that's right we got to
[1:06:44] watch with our lives when we can't feel
[1:06:46] the preaching we kind of we got to rub
[1:06:48] that Callos off for some isn't there a
[1:06:49] stone that takes off a callus pumice
[1:06:52] that's right I was gonna say that I was
[1:06:53] actually gonna say that way wow I must
[1:06:55] be grown wisdom or something no no no
[1:06:58] way but see they gotta break out that
[1:07:01] stone praise God
[1:07:02] Jesus Christ is the cornerstone oh yeah
[1:07:06] break on that stone and rub away that
[1:07:08] callus so people can feel the preaching
[1:07:11] again how many times are we singing
[1:07:14] songs and people just sit there like
[1:07:15] they came and raised their hand in our
[1:07:17] church other churches they can't even
[1:07:19] feel it what has happened there so
[1:07:21] callous right they can't even like
[1:07:25] somebody singing the songs better
[1:07:26] they're like what is this gonna get over
[1:07:27] doctor waiting
[1:07:28] oh we just want the word well the songs
[1:07:30] are there to help you get in the spirit
[1:07:32] to receive the word Christians see
[1:07:36] that's where I just see we see a lot of
[1:07:37] lukewarmness and back citing in message
[1:07:40] churches and it should not be it's
[1:07:44] because people will repent they won't go
[1:07:47] and ask for the glory again
[1:07:49] amen we say God let your glory fall on
[1:07:52] me again amen let me be his own fires I
[1:07:55] was at the beginning praise God because
[1:07:58] he says repent to praise God he calls us
[1:08:00] to repent me some pomace God sends some
[1:08:03] pumice stones in the church praise God
[1:08:05] to break down the calluses of our hearts
[1:08:09] when the preaching doesn't do anything
[1:08:11] the songs not if the songs won't movie
[1:08:13] the preaching what is going to move you
[1:08:15] nothing's going to move you except sin
[1:08:18] the rest is the reason they're not
[1:08:20] hungry and thirsting here is because
[1:08:22] they're flirting with the world out
[1:08:23] there
[1:08:24] Ava and praise God hallelujah see their
[1:08:32] alienate themselves from the life of God
[1:08:34] they separate themselves they don't want
[1:08:36] to hear it they don't want to place for
[1:08:38] it they separate themselves from it
[1:08:40] they're careless the blindness of their
[1:08:43] hearts they can't see it they don't want
[1:08:45] to see it paul saying don't let this be
[1:08:49] amongst you now he goes again in the
[1:08:52] next verse in verse 19 who being past
[1:08:55] feeling have given themselves over unto
[1:08:58] lasciviousness oh so now we know what
[1:09:01] they're doing now we know the reason
[1:09:02] they're alienated from the life of God
[1:09:04] they have given themselves over to
[1:09:06] lawlessness sin all here's here's the
[1:09:10] answer how come they don't have the life
[1:09:12] of God how come people in the message
[1:09:14] aren't born again because they're
[1:09:16] enjoying sin too much they've given
[1:09:21] themselves their past feeling they can't
[1:09:23] feel the preaching anymore they can't
[1:09:25] feel the songs they can't feel prayer
[1:09:27] anymore they don't even feel it because
[1:09:29] they're enjoying sin too much they're
[1:09:31] making love to Delilah right they're
[1:09:35] flirting with Delilah instead of obeying
[1:09:38] the Word of God instead of finding a
[1:09:40] real godly mate they're finding a simple
[1:09:42] mate they are past feeling the Bible
[1:09:47] says now look what past feeling means
[1:09:51] they give themselves over to the
[1:09:53] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[1:09:54] with greediness or with greediness past
[1:09:57] feeling means you don't feel any pain
[1:09:58] anymore they see the word doesn't cut
[1:10:01] people anymore
[1:10:02] oh I've heard that before I've heard
[1:10:04] brother Jesse preach it and don't even
[1:10:06] don't even cut you anymore it doesn't it
[1:10:10] should always cuz the word if we're
[1:10:12] wrong we should be able to feel the word
[1:10:14] correcting us but people have so hushed
[1:10:17] the holy voice of God in their souls
[1:10:19] they don't they don't want to hear
[1:10:21] anymore they don't want to live right
[1:10:23] like they should Paul says this should
[1:10:26] not be so they cease to feel pain
[1:10:31] anymore they become cows insensible
[1:10:34] apathetic I don't if I get right with
[1:10:36] God it's okay if I don't if the Holy
[1:10:40] Spirit comes in church today that's
[1:10:42] great if not that's okay if I feel God
[1:10:47] today at church great if not that's okay
[1:10:49] I got things I got to do sure this is
[1:10:54] Paul saying this is what the problem is
[1:10:56] this is the walk it's the walk of the
[1:10:58] people the daily walk that gets us
[1:11:02] closer to God or jaw's us further away
[1:11:06] we either give ourselves over to God or
[1:11:09] we give ourselves over to the vanity of
[1:11:11] our minds that's true how many believe
[1:11:16] that see lascivious this is unbridled
[1:11:19] see when they're out of church they'll
[1:11:20] do anything once they're out of church
[1:11:22] because it's unbridled when they're
[1:11:24] alone they'll do anything cuz they're
[1:11:25] all alone it's unbridled I don't care
[1:11:28] what anybody says I know God's not
[1:11:30] watching mirror I know guys watch me but
[1:11:32] he'll forgive me unbridled excess the
[1:11:35] shimmies this outrage is this
[1:11:37] shamelessness and they're unclean
[1:11:40] they're physically morally impure
[1:11:43] lustful luxurious profligate living and
[1:11:49] they're greedy greedy desire to have
[1:11:51] more covetousness that's what the script
[1:11:56] says that's what Paul's talking about
[1:11:58] but Paul says now verse 20 but ye have
[1:12:02] not learned so with Christ amen
[1:12:05] other than Jesus doesn't teach
[1:12:07] greediness Jesus doesn't teach live
[1:12:10] however you want and just enjoy whatever
[1:12:12] you want I'll forgive everything he
[1:12:14] don't teach that he doesn't teach you
[1:12:18] won't find that from a real Christian
[1:12:19] Church amen
[1:12:20] you'll find it from a lot of false
[1:12:22] churches but you won't find that in the
[1:12:23] real Christ Church amen the real Church
[1:12:26] of the Saints of the first born
[1:12:28] hallelujah but you have not learned so
[1:12:31] in Christ so this idea of well Jesus
[1:12:37] it's okay if I don't feel the Holy
[1:12:38] Spirit it's okay if I God does annoy me
[1:12:41] too it's okay
[1:12:42] that a pathetic feeling Christ doesn't
[1:12:44] teach that Christ doesn't teach it's
[1:12:47] okay to be backslidden you don't teach
[1:12:49] that you don't learn that from Christ
[1:12:51] what do you learn stay on fire stay true
[1:12:54] stay holy stay pure stay full of power
[1:12:57] amen hallelujah that's right see you've
[1:13:02] not learned you don't learn uncleanness
[1:13:04] or greediness or callousness from Christ
[1:13:07] Jesus and teachers okay to come to
[1:13:09] church and be bored bored yourself to
[1:13:11] death and not enjoy the music and not
[1:13:13] enjoy the preach Jesus don't teach that
[1:13:16] he teaches you should feel in fact my
[1:13:18] dad says you should not be like a
[1:13:20] Wallflower he said you should be like
[1:13:22] people at a football stadium and get
[1:13:24] into the get to the mood of it if you're
[1:13:26] not into it get into it if you don't
[1:13:29] feel it just do something until you do
[1:13:31] feeling amen
[1:13:32] bring your body in the subjection the
[1:13:35] Word of God and then make that mind and
[1:13:39] that body obey what your soul is asking
[1:13:43] for praise God Jesus don't teach sit
[1:13:46] down and just it's okay to be cows it's
[1:13:48] okay to be back soon it's okay to fall
[1:13:50] asleep on the preacher it's okay to do
[1:13:52] that now if you're really tired that is
[1:13:54] okay if you worked really hard I
[1:13:56] understand
[1:13:57] I was almost falling asleep on Sunday
[1:13:59] night because I was just tired
[1:14:00] I woke myself up and received the word
[1:14:02] and church I felt a difference in my
[1:14:04] life this week on Monday Tuesday
[1:14:05] Wednesday because the word that I heard
[1:14:08] on Sunday
[1:14:10] I'm away telling the honest God truth
[1:14:12] before the Lord I felt a great
[1:14:14] difference in my walk on Monday Tuesday
[1:14:16] and today by God's grace hallelujah it
[1:14:20] should be like that all the time right
[1:14:23] because Jesus doesn't teach cows
[1:14:25] lessness
[1:14:25] he don't teach that's okay just coax for
[1:14:28] a while you don't need to get closer
[1:14:29] Jimmy see now he says but you've not
[1:14:33] learned so you haven't been informed you
[1:14:35] don't practice this with Christ you
[1:14:37] don't get in these habits with Christ
[1:14:40] the bad habits because remember jesus
[1:14:42] said come unto me all that labor and are
[1:14:45] heavy-laden I'll give you rest take my
[1:14:46] yoke upon you and learn of me the only
[1:14:50] way to learn is to come alongside and
[1:14:52] get hooked up to Jesus you got to get
[1:14:55] hooked in right with Christ so you and
[1:14:58] Christ are laboring together praise God
[1:15:00] so see when we go to prayer in our
[1:15:03] closets it's not you praying alone
[1:15:04] you're praying with Jesus amen you're
[1:15:08] laboring with him when you bring your
[1:15:09] family to church it's not just you
[1:15:11] bringing them to church it's you in
[1:15:13] Jesus bringing them to church amen
[1:15:15] it's you're never alone praise God
[1:15:17] that's how I know my mouth how could my
[1:15:19] mom bring six children to church three
[1:15:21] times a week all by herself it's cuz she
[1:15:23] was an ood alone she was yoked to Christ
[1:15:25] amen to what she knew to what she knew
[1:15:29] because she knew the word she knew the
[1:15:32] word that you got to gather mores to see
[1:15:33] the Day approaching
[1:15:34] why did I bring these seven children
[1:15:35] eight children why did I bring all in
[1:15:37] the church because I know crisis with me
[1:15:39] praise God
[1:15:39] how does my wife to it she's joke to
[1:15:41] Christ praise God we can't do it on our
[1:15:44] own but we lead upon the power of the
[1:15:47] Holy Spirit in our souls amen glory how
[1:15:51] do you learn if Christ is meek then you
[1:15:54] got to be meek I've got to be meek the
[1:15:56] only way to learn is to be yoked to
[1:15:58] Christ and be meek because though
[1:16:01] teacher is meek right and lowly in heart
[1:16:06] and you shall find rest for your souls
[1:16:10] my yoke is easy my burden is light
[1:16:13] let's look at some of these definitions
[1:16:15] labor grow weary exhausted ever feel
[1:16:19] exhausted
[1:16:21] Jesus had come to me if you feel
[1:16:23] exhausted hey man
[1:16:25] most people say stay out of church of
[1:16:26] you're exhausted Jesus said come to me
[1:16:28] if you're exhausted amen I know he's
[1:16:31] talking about the soul here I know that
[1:16:32] understand let's see the house the
[1:16:34] Church of God is a hospital - for your
[1:16:36] body
[1:16:37] that's right so you gotta be led by the
[1:16:39] Holy Spirit heavy laden a heavy burden
[1:16:42] placed upon you to load one with the
[1:16:44] burden and like this rest
[1:16:46] this is rest for the Soul he said I'm
[1:16:48] giving you rest for your nature that
[1:16:50] life in you
[1:16:51] he's someone give you rest for that
[1:16:53] hunger in you to cause you to permit one
[1:16:56] to cease from any movement or labor in
[1:16:58] order to recover collective strength to
[1:17:00] give rest to refresh to give oneself
[1:17:03] rest to keep quiet or calm patient
[1:17:06] expectation he said come to me and I'll
[1:17:09] give you rest for your soul beautiful he
[1:17:14] said come and take a yoke a yoke is a
[1:17:17] something you put on a draught cattle
[1:17:19] right a laboring cattle in the field
[1:17:21] he said put my yoke upon you like you're
[1:17:25] you're a laborer you're a cat alright
[1:17:26] you're working for Jesus
[1:17:28] he said I'm meek and gentle I'm lonely
[1:17:32] I'm a low degree I'm humble in other
[1:17:35] words I'm humble memories have this
[1:17:40] things these things have I spoken unto
[1:17:42] you that's right before his crucifixion
[1:17:44] that in me he have might have peace in
[1:17:47] the world ye shall have tribulation but
[1:17:49] be of good courage I've overcome the
[1:17:52] world amen where we find peace at in
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ that's right
[1:17:57] another Guinness this is beautiful crew
[1:17:59] scripture Paul writes recipe that God
[1:18:01] even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:02] the father of mercies and the God of all
[1:18:05] comfort who comforts us in all of our
[1:18:08] tribulation that we may be able to
[1:18:11] comfort them which are in any trouble
[1:18:13] the reason we suffer is to help other
[1:18:16] people when you hear somebody has a
[1:18:19] truck straw like you had that should
[1:18:21] ring a bell in your soul I'm to
[1:18:24] encourage them I've been through the
[1:18:26] same thing and you should share with
[1:18:28] them how did you overcome that
[1:18:32] like I've been I've seen recent college
[1:18:34] students lately and high school and I'm
[1:18:36] telling them this is how I overcome in
[1:18:37] college like even preaches those middle
[1:18:40] schoolers last week I said here's how I
[1:18:41] did it I just I had to separate myself
[1:18:44] when all the college guys watching TV
[1:18:46] I usually ghost out and sat down I just
[1:18:48] had to give him a wave and run upstairs
[1:18:49] so I didn't get addicted to the TV I had
[1:18:52] to separate myself from them I just had
[1:18:54] to live a different life I had to go up
[1:18:55] and read my Bible praise God I'd have
[1:18:58] spent all Sunday at church so I didn't
[1:18:59] go watch the TV right he said by the
[1:19:05] comfort wherewith we ourselves are
[1:19:07] comforted of God so when you receive
[1:19:09] God's comfort you're able to comfort
[1:19:11] other people for as the sufferings of
[1:19:14] Christ offended us so our consolation
[1:19:16] also aboundeth by Christ amen see now
[1:19:22] sin is a weight Church how do you know
[1:19:24] that sin is a heavy burden and Paul said
[1:19:28] sometimes we run and we have weights of
[1:19:30] sin in our lives he said let us lay
[1:19:34] aside every weight and the sin that does
[1:19:36] so easily beset us and let us run the
[1:19:39] with patience the race that set before
[1:19:42] us David knew how heavy that was look at
[1:19:44] David my iniquities are gone over my
[1:19:46] head as a heavy bird and they're too
[1:19:49] heavy for me can you imagine David
[1:19:50] trying to hold this burden of late
[1:19:53] that's why people come to church and
[1:19:55] they're like this the whole church
[1:19:56] service because that heavy weight and
[1:19:59] burden it's just it's just burning them
[1:20:02] why don't you lay it down why don't you
[1:20:05] give it to Jesus praise God
[1:20:06] why don't you repent and get back to
[1:20:09] glory of God and get back into his
[1:20:11] presence praise God throw off the heavy
[1:20:14] weight and be free the burden is light
[1:20:16] amen
[1:20:19] my wounds stink and our corrupt because
[1:20:23] of my foolishness is not usually why we
[1:20:24] fall short of God's glory our own
[1:20:26] foolishness
[1:20:27] I should resolve this video of this
[1:20:31] movie called the pilgrims progress right
[1:20:33] it's a it's an animation of the actual
[1:20:36] story by Paul Bunyan right or John
[1:20:39] Bunyan sorry but
[1:20:41] beautiful story he leaves the society
[1:20:45] and as he goes his burden gets heavier
[1:20:47] and heavier as he's seeking that
[1:20:49] celestial city right and when he finally
[1:20:52] seen it finally gets their clothes he
[1:20:56] the burden falls off and it rolls down a
[1:20:59] hill or something and then there's the
[1:21:01] cross you know I can't explain I can't
[1:21:03] remember I think I was hoping Genevieve
[1:21:04] while we were watching the movies I
[1:21:05] can't remember all the details but
[1:21:06] somehow when he saw the cross the burden
[1:21:10] fell off amen and it falls off and then
[1:21:15] he's eight and now he's free he's strong
[1:21:16] again that's all we need to do when we
[1:21:18] come to church praise God we should do
[1:21:21] it actually every day lay down the heavy
[1:21:24] burdens because the heavy burdens are
[1:21:26] like weights upon our head now at the
[1:21:32] end of this chapter Paul breaks into
[1:21:35] this illustration of the old man against
[1:21:38] the new man and he's saying we need to
[1:21:41] walk as new men our lives should be so
[1:21:46] different our Christian life should be
[1:21:49] so different from our old life we're not
[1:21:54] walking the vanity of our minds from the
[1:21:56] past we're not walking according to
[1:21:58] perverseness we're walking according to
[1:22:01] holiness and fear of the Lord we're
[1:22:03] learning of Christ our burden his light
[1:22:07] now Ephesians 4:22 now I'd actually read
[1:22:13] verse 21 if so be that you have heard of
[1:22:15] him and have been taught by him as the
[1:22:16] truth is in Jesus that you put off
[1:22:19] concerning the former conversation the
[1:22:21] old man which is corrupt according to
[1:22:24] the deceitful lusts
[1:22:25] now this put off means put off like a
[1:22:28] garment right it's like you got dirty
[1:22:31] clothes on right you got you got stained
[1:22:34] clothes on you got old clothes on and
[1:22:36] he's saying take off the dirty clothes
[1:22:38] and put on clean clothes amen that's
[1:22:44] right so see lust church are always
[1:22:48] deceptive Satan's always gonna make our
[1:22:51] sin it's kind of okay he's going to make
[1:22:54] us seem like it's all
[1:22:55] kind of okay if you do this it might be
[1:22:58] okay other people are doing it this
[1:23:01] brother sisters doing it it's kind of
[1:23:04] deceptive well you got to have this you
[1:23:06] really have to do this you need this
[1:23:09] it's so deceptive but that's what Paul
[1:23:13] says Paul said the old man is full of
[1:23:18] deceitful lusts so see it's all about
[1:23:28] recognizing the truth can we recognise
[1:23:30] the truth or we walk into deception
[1:23:32] you've seen it you talk to people they
[1:23:34] think they're right with God and you
[1:23:36] know they're not right with God but yet
[1:23:38] they're just they deceive themselves
[1:23:40] they they have somehow convinced
[1:23:43] themselves that that's okay that the way
[1:23:45] they're living when it's not they
[1:23:48] deceive themselves because lust is
[1:23:51] always deceptive right now here Paul now
[1:23:55] starts dealing with their individual
[1:23:58] lives with their walk now let's look
[1:24:03] first at corrupt though corrupt for us
[1:24:05] is to lead away a Christian Church from
[1:24:08] that state of knowledge and holiness in
[1:24:10] which it ought to abide so a deceitful
[1:24:13] corrupted activity will lead us away
[1:24:17] from the life that we should be living
[1:24:20] the Church of week if we come to church
[1:24:22] or we know we're not living right then
[1:24:24] let's let's be honest with ourselves
[1:24:26] let's not be deceived
[1:24:28] let's not deceive ourselves Paul said
[1:24:30] you can deceive yourself right God will
[1:24:33] give you over to a lie right if you want
[1:24:35] to believe a lie I don't believe I'm
[1:24:36] good to give you over to that let's not
[1:24:38] be deceived if we know we're not living
[1:24:42] the way we should live we've got to do
[1:24:43] it quickly Jesus says Jesus said do it
[1:24:46] quickly or else I'll take the lampstand
[1:24:48] out a way out of your life
[1:24:52] and now be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:24:58] mind a man raised God verse 23 and be
[1:25:01] renewed in the spirit of your mind
[1:25:03] listen we're all gonna feel all the
[1:25:05] times we got to recognize I feel old so
[1:25:08] we can feel new again praise God our
[1:25:10] clothes are gonna constantly feel like
[1:25:12] they're getting old
[1:25:14] and when we feel that in the natural
[1:25:15] it's time to get a new shirt right
[1:25:19] especially my pants wear my pants oh man
[1:25:22] when my pants get holes on it I don't
[1:25:25] waste any time I go right to coals and I
[1:25:27] buy a new one I don't want to walk
[1:25:29] around with holes in my pants right I
[1:25:31] used to get them right in here sometimes
[1:25:33] they rip right here usually here though
[1:25:36] I don't waste any time I don't want to
[1:25:40] walk around with old clothes on I don't
[1:25:42] want to look like a vagabond I want to
[1:25:44] look respectful praise God that's a
[1:25:47] Christian we don't want to look like
[1:25:48] we're old and sin we want to be renewed
[1:25:51] in the spirit of our mind praise God why
[1:25:54] waste time just go get it sometimes it
[1:25:57] gets me and some financial pinnacles
[1:25:59] like pickles I'll say like that I'll
[1:26:02] just go get it but it's it's a spiritual
[1:26:06] principle I'll take off the old and put
[1:26:09] it on the noon praise God
[1:26:10] get you something new praise God get you
[1:26:12] a new I'll get you a new walk a new
[1:26:14] experience with God get something near
[1:26:17] praise God it's true holiness the Bible
[1:26:22] said let me read that now I'm almost
[1:26:25] done
[1:26:26] yeah I'm really trying honey I'm really
[1:26:30] trying tonight here and she's not
[1:26:33] pressuring me but she told me to my word
[1:26:35] cuz each week I'm like maybe I preach 45
[1:26:38] minutes tonight you know me maybe I
[1:26:39] operate she's like well you said 45 you
[1:26:42] said and you always say give me 15 more
[1:26:43] minutes I'm not gonna say that tonight
[1:26:46] okay but I do want to finish this
[1:26:49] thought ah be renewing the spirit of
[1:26:52] your mind he said and put on the new man
[1:26:54] verse 24 which after God is created in
[1:26:57] righteousness and true holiness now I
[1:27:01] don't have time so I'm just going to
[1:27:02] skip right to it
[1:27:03] then let's close
[1:27:05] this is just an image this bible project
[1:27:08] makes nice drawings and I thought I
[1:27:11] would just show this to the church and
[1:27:12] it's nice I think that I love these I'm
[1:27:14] a visual learner I love I love when
[1:27:17] people draw pictures that's why they I
[1:27:19] love how my wife trains our children to
[1:27:21] be artists there I love just it's a
[1:27:23] vision giving a visual of it
[1:27:24] give me the Statue River it man I want
[1:27:26] to see it in a visual praise God I just
[1:27:29] it makes it real to me so Paul says
[1:27:31] you've got to put off the old man and
[1:27:33] you got to put on the new man and he
[1:27:38] says you must do it he said if you're
[1:27:40] gonna if not you're gonna walk in the
[1:27:42] vanity of a calloused past feeling a
[1:27:45] Christian that can't feel the gospel
[1:27:47] effect anymore so here's a good example
[1:27:50] Paul says take off the old man put on
[1:27:53] the new he's this is the order he gives
[1:27:55] it at the end of the chapter and we'll
[1:27:57] go over this maybe on Sunday we have two
[1:27:58] services Sunday I forgot to announce
[1:28:00] that he says it said align a real
[1:28:04] Christian a new a renewed Christian
[1:28:06] doesn't lie a new Christian tells the
[1:28:08] truth Paul give me some neat mystery
[1:28:11] brother man give me some deep mystery
[1:28:13] how can I go closer to God read your
[1:28:15] Bible and pray read your Bible and pray
[1:28:22] amen and that's the hardest thing for
[1:28:25] people to do that's why program said it
[1:28:29] is there's so many things pulling Anna's
[1:28:32] so many desires but see we we have to
[1:28:35] find this way just recognize the others
[1:28:37] a lot of things pulled on me but look at
[1:28:38] my clothes they're filthy look at my
[1:28:41] spiritual life it's old it feels old and
[1:28:43] stale we'll just take it off and put on
[1:28:45] some new ones praise God just get some
[1:28:48] new ones because jesus said these kind
[1:28:50] of clothes are without money or cost
[1:28:52] amen
[1:28:53] it's not natural cost it's just as cost
[1:28:56] of sacrifice of time let's say an or fee
[1:28:59] he said if you're angry he said then
[1:29:02] make peace
[1:29:03] the old man steals he said if you steal
[1:29:06] make sure you give a lot and that's
[1:29:09] where I was guilty I stole a lot of
[1:29:10] money from my mom God forgive me
[1:29:12] I've tried to be generous since then
[1:29:14] praise the Lord he said he I'm troubled
[1:29:17] with gossip he said make sure you incur
[1:29:19] urge people the new man the new man
[1:29:24] doesn't ask for revenge the new man
[1:29:26] forgives and jerks you and I have to put
[1:29:29] this on it's not easy it's not easy
[1:29:33] sometimes you feel like taking something
[1:29:35] sometimes you feel like getting upset
[1:29:37] with somebody but the new man you take
[1:29:40] off the old and you put on the new you
[1:29:43] don't ask for revenge as forgiveness
[1:29:45] Paul says the old man is promiscuous
[1:29:47] which means fornication or adultery he
[1:29:50] said but we gotta have self-control
[1:29:51] praise God he said the old man got drunk
[1:29:55] he said but we get drunk on God's beer
[1:29:57] okay
[1:29:58] I don't have a guy and this goes into
[1:30:01] chapter five and so forth some but
[1:30:02] chapter four ends with I think these
[1:30:05] right here yeah I think think nice
[1:30:08] that's this is a beautiful picture isn't
[1:30:10] it Church such a beautiful picture of
[1:30:12] the gospel that's when it does church if
[1:30:16] we're a real Holy Ghost filled Christian
[1:30:19] we can recognize I'm getting some
[1:30:21] calluses Lord I need some pumice I want
[1:30:24] to feel this again I want to I want to
[1:30:26] take off this old experience I want to
[1:30:29] take off this old habits and I want to
[1:30:30] put on the new man praise God I don't
[1:30:34] want to live in the vanity of my mind I
[1:30:37] want to live I want to be a I want to
[1:30:39] have a transform mind I want a renewed
