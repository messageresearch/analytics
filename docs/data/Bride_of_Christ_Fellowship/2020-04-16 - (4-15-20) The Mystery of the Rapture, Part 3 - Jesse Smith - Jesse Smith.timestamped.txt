[14:30] Lord here's my take thank you Jesus what
[14:39] a blessing to have the seal of the
[14:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:42] let's Dan we get to the scripture here
[14:45] tonight let's go to first Corinthians
[14:50] chapter 4 like to preach on the mystery
[14:55] of the rapture part 3 read our text and
[15:03] then we'll do our memory verse by the
[15:05] grace of the Lord first thessalonians
[15:13] 4:16 Lord willing tonight we'll be
[15:19] looking at how the rapture will 16 what
[15:22] a promise here
[15:23] let's read up on three one two three for
[15:27] the Lord himself shall descend from
[15:30] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[15:33] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[15:37] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[15:41] praise God let's go to Philippians for
[15:45] seven and eight and the peace of God
[16:00] which passeth all understanding shall
[16:03] keep your hearts and minds through
[16:05] Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever
[16:10] things are true whatsoever things are
[16:14] honest whatsoever things are if there be
[16:17] any virtue and if there be any praise
[16:20] think on these things let's have a word
[16:23] of Prayer you like the Lord like beer
[16:26] shouldn't we have one desire that's your
[16:28] presence your spirit your will for our
[16:31] lives speak to us now tonight Lord let
[16:34] your Holy Spirit give us our daily
[16:36] portion for today in Christ's name we
[16:39] pray the church said Amen god bless yous
[16:42] be seated praise God so Lord willing
[16:51] tonight we'll do another installment
[16:55] here in the rapture series it's been a
[16:58] blessing to me I hope it's been a great
[17:00] blessing to you remember part two we
[17:03] looked at the times and seasons of the
[17:04] rapture then we looked at where the
[17:07] rapture takes place of course in Christ
[17:10] it's universal worldwide raptures some
[17:12] people will be working some in the field
[17:14] some in the bed but Christ will take all
[17:17] those who he is one with praise God why
[17:21] will takeplace Christ has to rescue his
[17:23] bride he wants fellowship with his bride
[17:26] he's given the Gentiles two thousand
[17:28] years to repent okay so let's start here
[17:36] tonight by God's grace just want to make
[17:38] sure I didn't miss any of your prayer
[17:39] requests or any text or any updates or
[17:41] anything like that so Lord willing we'll
[17:44] be doing another Bible study so I've got
[17:45] my readers ready
[17:46] liddie and Malachi by God's grace so
[17:53] let's look at how will the rapture
[17:57] now this is a beautiful revelation as
[17:59] far as I know brother Branham was really
[18:02] the first one to teach this three-step
[18:05] process of the rapture
[18:10] now it occurs how does it take place it
[18:13] is by the power and authority of Jesus
[18:17] Christ's spirit and it's done through a
[18:20] three-step process
[18:21] shout voice and Trump we now let's look
[18:27] at the Greek meaning for the word shout
[18:29] it means an order or command or stick
[18:34] out something that stimulates you
[18:36] something that moves you to action so
[18:39] Jesus descends first with a shout and it
[18:44] stimulates the bride it stimulates his
[18:49] people to get ready for the wedding the
[18:52] departing of the rapture praise God
[18:55] now this show or cry it must be the same
[19:00] midnight cry through 25-6 God so they've
[19:11] got to go out to meet the bridegroom
[19:14] which we know represents Jesus Christ in
[19:17] John chapter 1 John the Baptist season
[19:20] but he wasn't the great eternal light
[19:23] Jesus Christ is the eternal light any
[19:25] man or woman of God would say the same
[19:28] praise God I'm just I'm just reflecting
[19:30] his light but Jesus Christ is the
[19:33] eternal light praise God now that cry
[19:37] woke up two kinds of virgins wise and
[19:40] foolish and it gave them the opportunity
[19:44] to trim their lamps which means their
[19:48] wicks but we know the parable only one
[19:52] of them had extra oil to pour into their
[19:55] lamps and that to the our get ready he's
[19:58] coming he's coming
[20:00] and so the preaching today the preaching
[20:03] in the last 50 to 60 years has been
[20:06] telling the people get ready get ready
[20:08] the shout is going out it's still going
[20:10] out right
[20:11] around the world to every nation under
[20:14] heaven and it's her lamp of course the
[20:17] bride does to the wise does too but she
[20:19] has made preparations she's taken extra
[20:22] time to make sure she has oil that will
[20:25] take her and I think her I think it was
[20:30] in the parable I think it was some type
[20:32] of lamp they would take out a torch
[20:35] rather let's take out some type of torch
[20:37] they'd have to have that they can carry
[20:38] out a torch light their torches as well
[20:41] from their lamps and go out to the
[20:43] wedding procession so that's what having
[20:47] the Holy Ghost does it gives you a light
[20:49] it gives you a position in the wedding
[20:52] in the rapture praise God now now we
[20:57] teach and believe that God's ministry
[21:01] through brother Branham the late
[21:03] Reverend Branham was the shout or cry
[21:07] that awakened the Christian Church
[21:09] worldwide and brother Adams daughter
[21:13] Rebecca found a great resource in a it
[21:19] was a bhisma rock ulis healing campaigns
[21:21] in 1946 set off a spiritual explosion in
[21:25] the Pentecostal movement which was to
[21:28] move to Main Street USA by the 1950s and
[21:32] give birth to the broader charismatic
[21:34] movement in the 1960s which currently
[21:38] affects almost every denomination in the
[21:40] country praise God so even dictionaries
[21:43] encyclopedias recognize that the
[21:45] Ministry of brother Branham started a
[21:47] worldwide revival and if you look at the
[21:49] dates his ministry to started a few
[21:51] months before Billy Graham praise God
[21:53] and then you know shortly after the way
[21:56] back to Abraham and Sarah and the
[21:58] promised son Isaac we'll get to that in
[22:01] just a moment
[22:04] build and we're still believing God to
[22:07] do that as well in our own lives but
[22:10] even there's a there's a very beautiful
[22:12] testimony a sister from no way and they
[22:15] scanned her anyway and the cancer was
[22:18] gone
[22:18] praise God and so it's just a beautiful
[22:21] testimony on Facebook that are diffused
[22:23] from tuberculosis
[22:24] is the same power healing today in our
[22:28] church in other churches because it's
[22:30] the same revelation that Jesus Christ is
[22:33] the same yesterday today and forever
[22:34] his healing power remains the same we
[22:37] must only believe we must get into God's
[22:40] will for healing God's anointing for
[22:43] healing praise God this ministry they
[22:46] say can a rally to obey it praise God
[22:49] [Music]
[22:50] now we'll get to that a little bit by
[22:53] God's grace we see that because in math
[22:56] Matthew 20 10 11 so there's two
[23:00] particular scriptures where Jesus says
[23:03] the whole world must hear hear the
[23:05] message the whole world must hear the
[23:07] gospel then comes the end and we know
[23:09] there's places there's many languages
[23:11] that still don't have the message the
[23:14] Bible based teachings of brother Branham
[23:16] in their language nor have they heard it
[23:18] preached so that's it's God's
[23:20] long-suffering it's God's mercy that's
[23:23] allowing time to continue on so
[23:25] preachers will will soon get anointed to
[23:27] take the message and preach it to them
[23:30] so they have a chance to hear God's Word
[23:32] okay so Malachi can you read that for us
[23:41] praise God so the end doesn't come until
[23:44] every nation Gentile nation right
[23:46] because this is the gen the time of the
[23:48] Gentiles every Gentile nation was happy
[23:51] because the dead in Christ rise first
[23:54] according to 1st Thessalonians 4:16 this
[23:58] is the same voice that raised Lazarus
[24:00] from the dead and John 11 43 and then
[24:07] one day before the living Saints bodies
[24:11] are changed and swelled up in life the
[24:14] dead in Christ who faithfully served
[24:16] Jesus Christ for the last 2,000 years
[24:18] they will rise first and we believe we
[24:22] can't necessarily say it's thus saith
[24:24] the Lord but we believe we'll see them
[24:26] alive for a month or 40 days or 50 days
[24:30] some type of time period that will cause
[24:33] our faith to be so raised that we'll be
[24:36] ready for
[24:38] God's holy spirit to change our bodies
[24:40] because we know we can't do it ourselves
[24:41] it has to be God's anointing that will
[24:44] swallow up death alpha nice if the Alpha
[24:48] knees are going to come down here to
[24:49] pick up their natural bodies which we
[24:50] swelled up in glorified bodies and then
[24:55] after so again we look at Matthew 27 52
[24:59] and 53 we're not going to read it but in
[25:02] it we find how the Old Testament Saints
[25:05] many of the Old Testament Saints were
[25:08] raptured and resurrected when Jesus
[25:10] resurrected and that's why we believe
[25:12] that many of the wise virgins will raise
[25:17] from the past now those that have passed
[25:19] on that are dead beyond the curtain of
[25:21] time will come back and raise and we'll
[25:24] see them because it's a scriptural
[25:26] precedent according to Matthew 27 52 and
[25:30] 53 that first Corinthians 15 15 52
[25:50] praise God so see this is the third part
[25:54] of the three step rapture process
[25:57] according to the scripture and that
[26:00] changes our bodies and gathers all the
[26:04] saints the first and dead in Christ and
[26:06] then the living Saints gathers to the
[26:09] sky to meet Jesus Christ in the air oh
[26:12] that's one time we're gonna finally know
[26:14] what it feels like to fly praise the
[26:15] Lord
[26:16] it'll be a trend or some describes
[26:18] coming back aren't you glad he cleanses
[26:20] your life now he purges you now he
[26:23] washes you free from all your sin now
[26:24] that you'll be happy to see him you
[26:27] won't be sad to leave this world you'll
[26:28] be happy you'll be elated praise God
[26:30] you'll be full of the joy of the Lord
[26:32] praise God hallelujah bodas the last
[26:37] trump signal the union for the bride of
[26:41] Jesus Christ with her bridegroom in the
[26:44] sky
[26:45] praise God so the last Trump is like the
[26:47] music you hear at a wedding ceremony
[26:49] here comes the bride
[26:51] she hears that shout she hears that last
[26:54] Trump it's a spiritual sound praise God
[26:56] it's well it causes life to swallow up
[26:59] death and causes us to rise to meet the
[27:02] Lord in the air oh we won't be the first
[27:04] ones that didn't praise God
[27:06] Enoch minute I lied you did it praise
[27:08] God the chariot swung low and we won't
[27:11] need the chair because our bodies will
[27:12] be swallowed up in life and our bodies
[27:15] will be the chariot praise God amen
[27:17] someone's going to do it whether it's
[27:18] our generation or the next generation or
[27:20] the following someone's going to
[27:22] experience it who's born again may it be
[27:24] us by God's grace if not let's live like
[27:27] it praise God so we'll be the dead in
[27:29] Christ that rise first amen hallelujah
[27:32] now the shop voice Trump is all formed
[27:35] by the Holy Ghost case should you want
[27:38] to get a scripture it's gotta be my
[27:41] faith we have to understand all faith is
[27:44] is just anointing of the Holy Spirit
[27:46] right we look at that on Sunday with
[27:48] Abraham when he when he was justified by
[27:51] faith that was a portion of the Holy
[27:53] Spirit a small anointing of the Holy
[27:55] Spirit wasn't the fullness that comes in
[27:58] the baptism Hey praise God what caused
[28:15] Jesus's dead body to rise the Holy
[28:17] Spirit praise God amen and all promises
[28:20] if you've got the Holy Spirit it'll do
[28:23] the same thing for your body praise God
[28:25] in a quickened walk with God everyday
[28:28] walk with Him talk with him pray to him
[28:31] love and sing to him worship Him read
[28:34] his word
[28:35] Enoch he just had to take the next step
[28:37] so will be for you and I will just have
[28:39] the anointing on us just to take the
[28:41] next step into the body change not by
[28:44] our power not by our might but by the
[28:47] Holy Spirit say at the Lord amen
[28:50] thank the Lord now you know there's six
[28:53] father and then three new Testament
[28:57] after Jesus tension four days later
[28:59] Jesus and the Old Testament Saints took
[29:02] a rapture for the time of the jet
[29:04] for Christ's bride to take her away from
[29:07] the Great Tribulation to snatch her away
[29:09] catch her up in the sky defeated by the
[29:12] Satan himself they lay in the streets
[29:15] for three and a half days and then in
[29:17] the presence of other enemies the Holy
[29:18] Spirit comes upon them quickens their
[29:20] mortal bodies and they raised to heaven
[29:23] in the sight of other enemies and an
[29:25] earthquake hits the city of Jerusalem
[29:27] and a tenth part of the city falls and
[29:29] yet there's the 144,000 shouting and
[29:32] praising God for his great power the
[29:35] Bible says the remnant rejoices amen how
[29:37] do they all by their gonna see great
[29:39] things but by God's grace we'll see it
[29:42] from Heaven's corridor because we won't
[29:43] be here we'll be enjoying the marriage
[29:45] supper of the Lamb
[29:46] praise God hallelujah the seven seal are
[29:51] the seven thunders and life and death in
[29:55] the power of the tongue
[29:56] I couldn't go back to beds last Trump is
[29:59] the last seal and that yeah it is the
[30:03] last seal so the last trump is the
[30:06] seventh seal via one through three and
[30:08] now four five six so let's read that
[30:10] again now it's a little mysterious but
[30:13] member God hides these things from the
[30:15] eyes and the wise and prudent Church
[30:17] maybe you haven't studied it in which
[30:18] you don't have to but I've studied so
[30:20] many different teachers and they teach
[30:22] that the seven seals are chronological
[30:24] and order the Gentiles according to
[30:26] Roman's 11 so that's why this revelation
[30:29] this message is so important God will
[30:31] hide it from the eyes of wise and
[30:33] prudent but he'll reveal that the deal
[30:34] because the seals deal with the New
[30:39] Testament church and of course they also
[30:42] review all the mysteries for Israel as
[30:45] well so Lydia revelation eight one two
[30:50] three and I saw the seven angels which
[30:58] stood before God and to them were given
[31:00] seven trumpets and another angel came in
[31:02] to look at the altar having a golden
[31:05] censer and there was given unto Him much
[31:07] incense that he should offer it with the
[31:09] prayers of All Saints now that is so
[31:12] important because revelation 4:8 says
[31:14] that the beasts around the throne see
[31:18] not to cry holy holy send it down to the
[31:21] sky to rapture and snatch away his bride
[31:24] it has to be that's the only thing that
[31:27] makes sense in the scripture now let's
[31:31] and then they begin then heaven all the
[31:34] angels that are still up there not Jesus
[31:35] Jesus is down there to snatch his bride
[31:37] away then all the Angels start getting
[31:39] ready to pour out all the wrath of God
[31:42] to all those who rejected the gospel of
[31:44] Jesus Christ
[31:45] so Malachi 4:5 6 in the center that's
[31:57] what the Seventh Seal does it sends
[31:59] Christ down to earth and then it
[32:01] prepares heaven for all the judgments to
[32:04] be poured out upon the unbelievers on
[32:07] the earth that's quite plain I hope
[32:11] everybody can see that by the grace of
[32:13] God so see it's a little bit out of
[32:16] order the Seventh Seal opens up the
[32:20] Seventh Seal just finishes the book
[32:21] right just finishes everything all the
[32:24] rebel are spoken of in Revelation 4 5 &
[32:28] 6 the lamb comes forth no ones worthy to
[32:31] loose the revelation 6 and then all the
[32:34] images and though all the symbols go
[32:36] forth writing and then we see that all
[32:41] the seals are revealed the seventh seal
[32:43] is opened as well and then in Revelation
[32:49] 10 a mighty angel comes down and he
[32:53] brings the open book down to earth to a
[32:56] seventh angel who's on the earth and he
[33:00] finishes the mystery of God so this open
[33:03] book which means the open revelations of
[33:05] God's Word are given to a seven church
[33:08] age messenger and they never did that
[33:10] during his life so that's prophetic John
[33:13] representing the believer is to go and
[33:16] take the gospel as Jesus said in Matthew
[33:19] 24:14 it has to go around the world now
[33:24] occasional let's go to Roman's 11 19 the
[33:29] tilde he's done with all the Gentiles
[33:31] so this proves that revelation 10 is
[33:34] going on right now we're living and
[33:36] fulfilling through 24 14 so okay so can
[33:41] you read rut romans 11 19 20 and 21 this
[33:58] by faith be not high-minded but here for
[34:04] if God spared not the natural branches
[34:08] take heed lest he also spare not see
[34:11] good know that he are you there
[34:13] understand that they think God just
[34:15] blinded them just so he could save and
[34:17] you know and it wasn't the Jews fault
[34:19] no it was the Jews choice God foresaw
[34:22] that they were going to reject Christ
[34:24] because they didn't want to leave their
[34:26] Pharisee sad you see denomination
[34:28] Herodian denomination they want to leave
[34:31] that they're going to reject it so
[34:32] that's why it all worked into God's plan
[34:35] to put a spirit of blindness and slumber
[34:37] on them because they already disbelieved
[34:40] that's what the Bible says so God cut
[34:42] off the Israel branch or the Jewish
[34:46] branch from the holy tree right so they
[34:49] stopped living Isles 25 and 26 Romans 11
[35:16] [Music]
[35:19] praise God
[35:21] just makes cash out thank you Jesus
[35:23] praise God
[35:24] blindness has happened until Haitian
[35:27] amen thank God
[35:29] oh it's so true the last Trump is the
[35:32] last seal trust everybody can see that
[35:35] by the girl all Israel shall be saved
[35:38] whose Israel the ones that are the Bible
[35:41] said wise and they're virgins as well
[35:43] praise God
[35:44] those 104
[35:45] four thousand who get the baptism of the
[35:47] Holy Ghost amen
[35:48] praise God so that thought just kind of
[35:54] came to me thus more starts dealing with
[35:55] the Jews and that's right according to
[35:58] scripture that doesn't disagree with
[35:59] anything in the scripture
[36:02] okay now let's go so I want to go over
[36:11] the last sign before the rapture very
[36:16] strange scripture to use for the last
[36:19] sign before the rapture but the reason
[36:21] we use your Paul used to say the body
[36:25] changes will be changed at the last
[36:26] Trump and death will be swallowed up in
[36:28] life the scripture he used for that
[36:30] remember was from Isaiah 25 a scripture
[36:34] that was dealing with Jews Paul pulls
[36:36] out that one scripture in Isaiah 25 and
[36:39] brings it to the New Testament to be a
[36:42] thus saith the Lord prophecy for the
[36:44] rapture
[36:45] so brother am in a prophet form a
[36:48] prophet characteristic just like Paul
[36:51] goes to the old tent he just said it
[36:53] consistently he said it frequently and
[36:57] he said it with the authority and with
[36:59] the vindication and break that up are
[37:03] you there
[37:03] okay so let me just background in verses
[37:06] 1 to 8 God visits Abraham and Sarah
[37:10] history that Jesus Christ exercised to
[37:15] the Jew and the Samaritan now gets
[37:17] brought to the Gentile and that of
[37:20] course is fulfilled in Luke 1730 we'll
[37:23] get there in a moment but that's the
[37:25] revelation we mentioned earlier so they
[37:27] have three messengers come down to
[37:28] Abraham and Sarah God represents the son
[37:31] of man ministry gift through brother
[37:34] Branham to the bride and the two
[37:37] messengers represent Billy Graham
[37:39] supernatural vindicated around the world
[37:42] over and over even those even the
[37:44] retractors even the doubters who have
[37:48] left brother Graham's ministry cannot
[37:50] deny the supernatural sign that God gave
[37:54] through that ministry praise God that's
[37:57] because it's thus saith the Lord
[37:58] aim
[37:59] so let's read verses 9 now can you read
[38:05] 9 10 11 and 12 and they said to him
[38:11] where Sarah thy wife and he said Behold
[38:13] in the tent and he said I will certainly
[38:15] return an age it seems to me therapy the
[38:18] manner of women therefore Sarah laughing
[38:20] finish so saying after I am waxed old
[38:23] shall I have pleasure my lord being old
[38:25] awesome Keysha can you read 13 14 15
[38:30] I'm Abraham why would she marry China if
[38:39] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[38:43] time appointed I will return unto thee
[38:45] according to the time of life Sarah
[38:47] shall have a son then Sarah's and I'm
[38:50] saying I left not then God instantly
[38:55] discerns her doubt in questions Abraham
[38:58] about Sarah's laughter and says is
[39:00] anything - to lie to God saying she
[39:04] didn't laugh but God says nay you did
[39:05] laughs no look at that that's chapter 18
[39:09] chapter 19 Lots escape from Sodom and
[39:15] Gomorrah and the destruction of Sodom
[39:17] and Gomorrah chapter 20 Abraham has a
[39:20] second lapse he lies about Sarah being
[39:23] his wife to Abimelech and also shows the
[39:26] restoration of Sarah back to Abraham
[39:28] but then in chapter 21 of Genesis God
[39:31] keeps his word church God will always
[39:34] keep his word amen visit Sarah in
[39:37] Genesis 21 and Isaac is born so this is
[39:41] this so this event foreshadows the
[39:46] arrival of Jesus Christ
[39:48] Isaac represents Christ the promised son
[39:50] arriving for the rapture
[39:55] so before Isaac can arrive what it needs
[39:58] to happen a body change has to happen
[40:00] praise God because Abraham was dead and
[40:04] the Bible said Sarah's womb in a sea
[40:07] so a body change from infertility to
[40:10] fertility had the
[40:12] happen and that foreshadowed the body
[40:14] change that will experience so because
[40:17] we shall all be changed just as they had
[40:19] a body change we have a body change
[40:22] praise God but ours is in a moment so
[40:26] what was God's last sign to Abraham and
[40:28] Abraham and Sarah before the embody
[40:30] change it was the man God discerning
[40:36] Sarah's doubting heart through a
[40:38] supernatural gift of discernment you can
[40:40] say discernment the last sign was God's
[40:43] discernment to Abraham and Sarah because
[40:48] God is the word in John 1:1 in the
[40:51] beginning was the word the Word was with
[40:52] God the Word was God and the word is a
[40:55] discerner of the thoughts and the
[40:57] intents of the heart
[40:59] according to ice that proves it had to
[41:03] be God amen so this is a repeating
[41:10] biblical pattern of God in a flesh body
[41:14] discerning the thoughts intent when
[41:17] Philip called him in John 149 and we
[41:22] call this the son of man ministry
[41:24] because son of man just means a prophet
[41:26] but Jesus gets a capital S because he's
[41:30] divine son of man praise God every other
[41:33] son of man deserves a lowercase now
[41:39] Philip
[41:40] I'm sorry Nathanael is a spiritual
[41:42] person he instantly realizes that Christ
[41:48] knows about his previous conversation
[41:51] with Philip and he instantly cries out
[41:54] and said you're the Son of God the king
[41:57] of Israel praise God Amen man a true
[42:01] believer the one who's in the Word of
[42:02] God and knows the Word of God will be
[42:05] able to recognize God's Son of man
[42:08] ministry right when they see it praise
[42:10] God amen the Stern's of thoughts and
[42:12] tents of a Samaritan woman the woman who
[42:15] had five husbands and was living with us
[42:17] six
[42:18] she told Jesus she had no husband but
[42:21] Jesus agreed and said she's had five and
[42:24] the current one is
[42:25] not her husband so notice she's
[42:29] convinced that because of this special
[42:32] discernment knowledge that Jesus Christ
[42:35] is a prophet sir I perceive that thou
[42:39] art a prophet amen
[42:41] we only must listen to the testimonies
[42:43] of those people who knew brother Branham
[42:46] - to know this same true is putting out
[42:49] videos about the testimonies of Ed
[42:51] Bissell so timely for this message even
[42:53] tonight - but it goes into the story of
[42:56] when brother Bisco had brother Branham
[42:59] come and hold meetings with his Indian
[43:03] Church the Native Americans that he was
[43:05] ministering to think Nathaniel just like
[43:08] the woman at the well at Bisco say
[43:11] Florence Hughes Tom Brown all these
[43:13] individuals as soon as they saw the gift
[43:15] operate they said this is the different
[43:17] this is a special ministry I perceive
[43:20] that this is a prophet praise God
[43:22] because they know the thoughts and
[43:24] intents of the heart
[43:26] so Jesus used it with the Jews in John
[43:28] one with the Samaritans in John 4 but he
[43:32] never uses it with a jet so liddy
[43:39] whenever you're ready luke's 1730
[43:45] unraised god now going back up we should
[43:48] buy read 26 27 28 and 29 a man or the
[43:53] final coming of the Son of Man before
[43:55] destruction so he says that societal
[43:58] conditions when the neck when he comes
[44:01] as second time as a son of man they must
[44:03] match the conditions of Noah and lot and
[44:06] we looked at that last time with the
[44:08] times and seasons of the rapture they
[44:10] bought they sold we also know the times
[44:13] of Noah was a time where sons of God
[44:14] were compromising they were marrying
[44:16] women outside the faith just because of
[44:19] their attractiveness we see that
[44:20] happening today as well of course lots
[44:23] time was homosexuality and we can all
[44:26] see the rise of that since the Supreme
[44:29] Court legalized it in 2015 so rather
[44:32] have supernatural son of man ministry is
[44:35] the fulfillment of Jesus's the words in
[44:39] Luke 7
[44:39] 19:30 have a video on my youtube channel
[44:44] you can watch it it's from 1954 brother
[44:48] Bram tells a patient 15 secrets imagine
[44:51] that 15 secrets about her life that
[44:55] brother Ram can't know and then tells
[44:58] her she's going home to be well pray
[45:00] Scott and the congregation erupts
[45:02] because no one had at no one had ever
[45:05] seen this live they've read about in the
[45:07] Bible but the Bible was becoming
[45:09] fulfilled prophecy was being fulfilled
[45:11] right before their eyes in the 40s 50s
[45:14] and 60 he's were commonplace like the
[45:19] Bible says
[45:19] just like Jesus's ministry in Paul's
[45:21] ministry this was not done in a corner
[45:24] this gift of discernment was the last
[45:27] sign to the Gentiles before the rapture
[45:29] based upon Genesis chapter 18 in
[45:34] bloomington illinois said remember let
[45:36] me tell you the say that the Spirit of
[45:38] God that's on me this is the last sign
[45:41] to the Gentile church before the rapture
[45:43] three days later he said remember thus
[45:46] saith the Holy Spirit this is your last
[45:48] sign write it in your Bible if something
[45:51] rises beside this and greater than this
[45:53] call me a false prophet and we'll keep
[45:55] standing on that praise God I heard
[45:57] about programs ministry in 2001 so for
[46:00] 19 years I've stood on that patient that
[46:03] no one else knew Paul says when that
[46:05] happens in a church people should fall
[46:07] down and say truly God is among you
[46:09] praise God next May 19 1961 in British
[46:14] Columbia brother Branham said just
[46:15] remember thus saith the Lord you will
[46:17] never in any no more gentle 62 in Grass
[46:21] Valley California brother Branham said
[46:22] you'll never receive another son this is
[46:25] it thus saith the Lord would a prophet
[46:27] of God make a statement like that if it
[46:29] wasn't true you're receiving your
[46:31] greatest sign and your last sign before
[46:33] the appearing of Christ I encourage
[46:37] anybody if you're listening it was so
[46:38] different from others it had to be it
[46:40] was the son of man ministry before the
[46:43] rapture on April 11 64 in my heart that
[46:48] speaks that this is the truth
[46:51] I believe it praise God and
[46:53] you've seen it now we watched it in our
[46:54] lives for almost 20 years no sign has
[46:57] ever gone greater to the Gentiles than
[47:00] the sermon God gave to William Branham
[47:03] praise God
[47:04] I meant two people that had this
[47:06] discernment Tom Brown and Tom Browns
[47:11] testimony he had an interview with
[47:12] brother Branham and brother Graham slid
[47:14] the paper and then sister Florence
[47:16] Hughes I met her I believe in 2010 God
[47:20] brother man told her go away yourself
[47:22] the next two Monday's you'll see you'll
[47:24] gain weight that's assigned to you that
[47:26] I told you the truth
[47:27] so her tuberculosis was discerned and
[47:31] then the prophetic power the Holy Spirit
[47:34] foretold her healing and she lived many
[47:36] many years afterwards so this
[47:41] discernment gift of brother Branham was
[47:42] at the correct time just as God in flesh
[47:46] appeared to Abraham and Sarah at the
[47:48] right time it appeared before the
[47:51] destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and
[47:53] Isaac's birth the son of man ministry of
[47:57] brother Branham appeared before the
[47:59] rapture and the Great Tribulation
[48:02] let me try to find a place to close here
[48:11] yes many of us obviously most of us
[48:14] alive today we did not experience
[48:16] brother branham's son a man ministry
[48:19] firsthand but we need not be discouraged
[48:23] praise God as we said earlier most
[48:26] prophetic gifts are rejected and then
[48:29] God after a prophetic gift leaves then
[48:32] God gives the people still time to
[48:34] repent afterwards
[48:38] remember John the Baptist was sent to
[48:41] the Jews but rejected by the majority
[48:44] right and then Jesus came the greatest
[48:47] prophet that ever lived
[48:48] Jesus Christ came and then after he died
[48:51] in AD 30 they still had 40 years
[48:53] afterwards in which to repent before
[48:56] Titus brought destruction and destroyed
[48:59] Jerusalem and the temple and so God
[49:02] always gives time afterwards
[49:05] for people to receive that last sign so
[49:09] we don't have to be discouraged thank
[49:10] God there was tapes to record brother
[49:14] branham's of Abraham and Sarah today
[49:17] praise God more here so in the book the
[49:27] that chapter is basically finished and
[49:29] then I end each chapter with the rewards
[49:32] for Rossio and then just a short
[49:34] conclusion and then action steps you
[49:36] know some people like lists of things to
[49:38] do so just give a quick action steps on
[49:40] how they can receive the revenue and I
[49:43] have to use our imagination the channel
[49:46] this is where God wants to use your
[49:47] imagination not to daydream about evil
[49:49] things or plan and imagine plans to to
[49:54] feed the flesh but this is where God
[49:55] once used the channel of imagination to
[49:59] try to fathom
[50:00] the immensity of Christ rewards for his
[50:05] bride now we already talked about a few
[50:08] rewards at least four more rewards
[50:12] patient can you go to scripture for me
[50:15] first Thessalonians 1 verse 2 yeah let's
[50:26] just do the first reward and then we'll
[50:27] be done tonight by God's grace what a
[50:29] blessing my love going over these things
[50:31] don't you it solidifies us in the
[50:33] fundamental truths and revelations that
[50:36] we have to know but I am said if there's
[50:39] a mystery of God we have to know it
[50:41] praise God because the mystery of God is
[50:43] finished according to revelation 10 7
[50:45] and Deuteronomy 29:29 says the mysteries
[50:49] of God belong to his children that they
[50:52] may obey them and keep the ways of the
[50:54] Lord praise God were the only ones that
[50:56] are going to keep the ways of the Lord
[50:58] because we've got the revelation of the
[51:01] mystery everybody else don't want all of
[51:02] it but we want all of it so we can live
[51:04] you are part of Christ's bride now this
[51:08] is a great reward but honestly something
[51:10] we wrestle with so much because of the
[51:12] battlefield of the mind remember you're
[51:15] three parts your body
[51:18] spirit and soul so in case you can you
[51:22] read that
[51:22] first Thessalonians 1 verse 5 raised God
[51:34] so the Thessalonians were Gentile
[51:37] heathens some of them didn't want to
[51:39] work some of them said the rapture is
[51:41] our Holy Ghost because it's the power in
[51:43] the Holy Ghost and much assurance
[51:46] because what is a seal in the Greek a
[51:48] seals security from Satan
[51:51] so remember of fusions 1:13 Ephesians
[51:53] 4:30 you're sealed by the Holy Spirit to
[51:57] the day of your Redemption so where is
[51:59] that security things are secure we
[52:01] wonder about things the security the
[52:03] assurance the safety the much assurance
[52:06] is in your soul your nature so when you
[52:09] when you shut out the battlefield of the
[52:12] mind and just meditate and let the
[52:15] nature of God be your meditation that's
[52:18] when you feel God's blessed assurance
[52:19] Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of
[52:22] glory divine amen
[52:24] it is a seal it's a mark upon by the
[52:29] impress of a seal or stamp God has
[52:33] impressed your soul right are you
[52:35] impressed upon yourself or he's God amen
[52:38] your soul is impressed with God's nature
[52:41] with God's power God's assurance amen
[52:45] that's what it means not so much your
[52:47] mind your mind is needs transformed
[52:49] every day but the soul was impressed by
[52:52] the power of God amen
[52:54] the boat was called a token to Noah
[52:56] which we still see today we benefit from
[52:59] that covenant right we preach on that
[53:00] lately the circumcision to Abraham's
[53:04] males and his sea was called a token and
[53:07] leave it's Genesis 17 the Passover lambs
[53:11] blood upon the doorpost was a token in
[53:15] exodus 12 Aaron's rod that budded in
[53:18] numbers was called a token and the
[53:21] scarlet cord in John lamb and Rahab
[53:24] scarlet cord the public display of the
[53:28] Passover lambs blood was required
[53:32] for Israel's exodus out of Egypt in fact
[53:35] without the blood publicly displayed the
[53:38] death angel destroyed the firstborn of
[53:40] every house whether Jew or Egyptian in
[53:45] the same way the life of Jesus Christ
[53:48] must be publicly displayed in the lives
[53:51] of Christians in order for them to make
[53:54] an exodus or be snatched away by Christ
[53:57] from the great tribulation in the
[53:59] rapture praise God
[54:01] amen it's another Exodus praise God we
[54:02] know there's three Exodus a--'s right
[54:04] the first one was Israel out of Egypt
[54:07] the second one was Israel out of the law
[54:09] into the baptism the Holy Ghost in Acts
[54:12] chapter 2 and the third Exodus is the
[54:15] eternal the seal believer exit made it
[54:19] making an exodus out of this natural
[54:21] world into the heavenly realms praise
[54:24] God amen wrath so the Scarlet Court
[54:28] represents a public testimony of the red
[54:32] blood of Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit
[54:35] because the Bible said the life is in
[54:38] the blood
[54:38] in Leviticus 17:11 see these Old
[54:43] Testament symbols represent the life of
[54:45] Jesus Christ which is the Holy Spirit
[54:48] baptism and it must be publicly
[54:50] displayed by Christians because the
[54:53] Spirit is life Romans 8 10 praise God
[54:57] Romans 8 10 and let's stand to our feet
[55:01] here just as the boarding pass on a
[55:04] plane is the assurance you'll have a
[55:07] seat on the flight the baptism of the
[55:09] Holy Ghost is the seal or token part in
[55:13] that a beautiful reward the first reward
[55:15] we want to mention there is the blessed
[55:18] assurance let's sing that blessed
[55:19] assurance Jesus is mine we kind of
[55:22] already sealed my soul so that I have a
