[31:46] name of Jesus the name above all names
[31:49] Lord as acts 4:12 says neither is there
[31:52] salvation in any other there's no other
[31:55] name you look under heaven whereby men
[31:57] must be saying we're great or thankful
[32:00] Hollett so happy to be saved by the

[32:07] words of this morning or God not to be
[32:09] we rejoice in your name we thank you for
[32:12] your million we have power your name
[32:15] salvation they drain your name he says
[32:19] oh Jesus my little speak it Oh God
[32:22] we since your lips we meditate upon that
[32:25] name Lord God that's justice now as we
[32:27] get deeper more cut he medicine every
[32:30] heart result father were so grateful for
[32:33] all you've done
[32:34] less your people now Jesus Christ
[32:37] every set the family makes Dan I already
[32:41] make stand at home by magic you have
[32:48] your Bibles like to go to numbers
[32:49] chapter 14 I like to preach on part 11
[32:52] of the biblical numerology series by the
[32:55] grace of all now I'm sorry with this
[33:01] scripture is kind of a negative
[33:02] scripture on Israel but remember Paul
[33:07] told us in 1st Corinthians 10 use
[33:09] everything about Israel for our example
[33:12] for our admonition so we got to look at
[33:14] negative examples and even gain wisdom
[33:18] from it just like jesus said remember
[33:20] Lot's wife so as we look at numbers 14
[33:23] 22 and 23
[33:25] we'll be looking at the numbers 8 9 and
[33:28] 10 today by the grace of the Lord and of
[33:31] course this deals with number 10 now
[33:33] before today I didn't know brother
[33:34] Branham said this brother Graham said
[33:36] number 10 is a number of worldliness and
[33:39] I found it to be true as I studied the
[33:41] scriptures now of course 10 has a couple
[33:43] of different meanings so we'll look at
[33:46] that one
[33:46] of course we'll look at that one first
[33:47] then we'll look at the other meanings as
[33:49] well numbers 14 22 I like verse 20 they
[33:56] look at that like it but as truly as I
[33:58] live all the earth should be filled with
[34:01] the glory of the Lord amen we're just
[34:02] about there we're just about there the
[34:05] Millennium all the earth to be filled
[34:07] with the glory of the Lord verse 22 as
[34:11] all the men would have seen my glory and
[34:13] my vehicles which I did in Egypt and the
[34:16] witnessed and end to me now these ten
[34:18] times and have not hearkened my voice
[34:21] bless you surely they shall not see the
[34:25] land which I swear unto their father
[34:27] neither shall any of them that provoked
[34:30] me see it Allegra verse 24 but my
[34:33] servant Caleb because he had another
[34:35] spirit in him have followed me fully him
[34:40] will I bring into the land where into he
[34:42] went and his seed shall possess it now
[34:47] the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt
[34:49] the valley tomorrow
[34:50] turn you that you endured this there
[34:53] will be other Red Sea in Anna's less
[34:55] Iranian Board may be tête-à-tête bless
[34:57] you that's quite an encouraging
[35:09] Scripture we know it's a maybe a little
[35:11] bit sad for those multitude of
[35:15] Israelites that didn't did not possess
[35:18] the promised land but it's encouraging
[35:21] to see that Caleb and Joshua were the
[35:23] faithful and there was of course two of
[35:26] them out of the twelve so with that
[35:27] number 10 I think 10 has another meaning
[35:29] as well I'll be sharing that and they're
[35:31] just a little bit by the grace of the
[35:32] Lord but before we get that number 8
[35:36] would 8 9 and 10 buy the piece of Lord
[35:39] would have much fun apron I will be
[35:42] quickly moving to number 10 now this is
[35:49] interesting I just
[35:50] brings out because I preach it yet but I
[35:52] just found it in the book that I've been
[35:54] reading by mr. Bellinger about numbers
[35:57] in Scripture he's looking at the number
[36:00] eight and he says eight can also mean
[36:03] abundance or super abundance to super
[36:07] abound as a part of a part of simple it
[36:10] means one who abounds in strength so it
[36:14] can mean super abundance or fertility
[36:18] and then the writer goes on to say as
[36:22] seven was so called because the seventh
[36:24] day was the day of completion and rest
[36:26] so eight as the eighth day was over and
[36:29] above the perfect completion as indeed
[36:32] the first of a new species well as being
[36:36] the eighth so we about the eight of
[36:38] course representing the New Jerusalem
[36:40] and so this gives the eighth gift the
[36:44] idea of a super abundance a new group
[36:47] and of course that's what the Nuge
[36:49] person is it's a new beginning by the
[36:51] grace of the Lord because we finished
[36:52] the first seven prophetic thousand-year
[36:55] days six thousand human history and then
[36:58] one thousand goddesses one thousand a
[37:00] honeymoon millennium period with his
[37:03] wife Christ in the in the church and
[37:05] then eight is this overabundance eight
[37:09] is the new day first day all over again
[37:12] praise God also it's interesting too I
[37:15] want to bring this just to our attention
[37:17] it may come up later that's why I'm
[37:19] preaching it now it just seems to be
[37:22] like this will have some impact later
[37:24] but eight is the first cubic number
[37:27] it's the cube of two so two times two
[37:30] times two is eight we've seen that three
[37:35] is the symbol of the first plane figure
[37:38] and then four is the first square number
[37:42] so in eight is the first cubic number
[37:45] and we see what the author calls
[37:48] transcendent perfection indicated
[37:50] something the length and the breadth and
[37:53] the height of which are equal so you see
[37:57] a cube and now the writer gives numerous
[37:59] examples of the cube for example
[38:04] the Ark was a cube of one cubit the
[38:07] window the ark rather was one by one by
[38:09] one the tabernacle was 10 cubits by 10
[38:14] cubits by 10 cubits rather the holiest
[38:17] of holies was 10 by 10 by 10 so we see
[38:21] these cubes so it's just interesting 8
[38:23] is the the first cube we would say and
[38:27] then also the temple let me see where
[38:33] this temple is here
[38:34] oh the temple Solomon's Temple was 20 by
[38:38] 20 by 20 the Holy of Holies there
[38:41] so Moses tabernacle was 10 by 10 by 10
[38:43] and then which was a thousand cubic feet
[38:47] and then solomon's tabernacle was 20 by
[38:51] 20 by 20 which is 8,000 interesting now
[38:55] the New Jerusalem the dimension of the
[38:59] New Jerusalem on the pyramid are twelve
[39:00] thousand by twelve thousand by twelve
[39:02] the Houston that's the holy city so
[39:05] we're starting to see some cubic numbers
[39:08] and I just want to bring that out
[39:09] because like I said it may play a part
[39:11] later especially as we get to close to
[39:13] 20 s and then 12s and so forth so I hope
[39:17] that was a blessing there now I just
[39:19] have a few different thoughts on the
[39:20] number 8 so bear with me here jehovah
[39:25] talked to Abraham eight times and I
[39:28] could find in Scripture and I found this
[39:30] for through Ballinger and I went back
[39:31] and read all of them yesterday the first
[39:33] time was in Genesis 12 1 through 3 where
[39:36] God told Abraham to separate himself he
[39:39] was going to give him a nation of his
[39:40] seed and bless the world through Abraham
[39:44] that was the first time the second time
[39:46] Genesis 12:7 Abraham's seed has promised
[39:50] the land in Genesis 13 14 to 17 Abraham
[39:56] was given divine assurance of the land
[39:58] and the seed and God told him to rise
[40:01] and walk in the land and everything you
[40:03] see every place where your foot steps
[40:07] will be yours and now we all know how
[40:09] that applies to us right any promise of
[40:12] God in the Bible whether it's healing
[40:13] whether it's salvation whether it's your
[40:16] gift your minister
[40:17] any promise in the Bible that is given
[40:20] to us as a believer we have to take it
[40:23] foot step by foot step little by little
[40:26] and we've got to overcome everyday a
[40:28] little bit in order to possess those
[40:30] things I'm sure many of us have walked
[40:32] into healing it didn't maybe healing
[40:34] didn't happen the first day but after a
[40:35] couple days or three or four days
[40:38] eventually you walked into that healing
[40:40] or maybe your understanding of the
[40:41] person you should marry you didn't know
[40:43] right away but after prayer and
[40:45] meditation and day after day it you kind
[40:47] of walk into that promise you possess
[40:49] that promise like our sister gave that
[40:51] testimony of without praying for seven
[40:53] years for her husband I thought that was
[40:55] a wonderful thing that was a promise out
[40:57] there but she had to walk in it and just
[41:00] trust the Lord and and and not not
[41:02] straight to the left or right but just
[41:04] walk straight in the path of God's
[41:06] promise the fourth time God talked to
[41:10] Abram was Genesis 15 verses 13 to 21 and
[41:14] God gave Abram the divine boundaries of
[41:17] the land the physical boundaries of the
[41:19] land he also told him that his seed
[41:22] would be in Asia for 400 years and they
[41:25] would leave in the fourth generation
[41:27] theirs or theirs for deliverance I
[41:29] didn't even catch that yesterday amen
[41:31] so the fourth generation God would bring
[41:34] Israel out of Egypt so foreign there's a
[41:36] number for deliverance again and you
[41:40] write that down Lydia text that to me
[41:41] give your phone okay just text it to me
[41:46] just say Israel came out of Egypt on the
[41:48] fourth generation thank you I don't want
[41:50] to lose that you know in case I like I
[41:52] said I may write a book on that
[41:53] eventually one day we'll see number five
[41:59] Genesis 17 is the whole chapter 1 to 22
[42:02] God promises Abraham divine essence--
[42:06] again of the promise and he calls him to
[42:09] walk perfectly on the fifth call my
[42:12] grace gives him a name change on the
[42:16] fifth time tells him about circumcision
[42:21] and promise
[42:23] he gives promises for Sarah and Ishmael
[42:25] so finally on the fifth time he gets a
[42:28] name change and then serán Ishmael our
[42:31] our giver he's gonna yell their position
[42:33] in the process of God this visitation
[42:39] was in Genesis 18 9 233 it was the
[42:43] promise of the return presentation for
[42:46] Sarah's conceptions God visited and said
[42:48] I'm gonna return in the year according
[42:50] to the time of life and I'm gonna visit
[42:52] Sarah and she's going to have a son
[42:54] he also during this visit this of course
[42:57] the visit with the two other angels
[42:58] there was three messengers God and two
[43:00] angels this is the the visit the six
[43:04] visit God also revealed Sodom's
[43:09] destruction this was the visit where God
[43:11] said shall I hide anything from my my
[43:13] sermon Abraham who keeps all the
[43:15] commandments of God and this is of
[43:18] course when lots of the promised
[43:20] deliverance came when when the two
[43:22] messengers went down to Sodom and God
[43:24] stayed with Abraham and Abraham
[43:27] interceded for a lot this was also that
[43:29] time course which we believe was a horse
[43:31] shadow and God came in the prophetic son
[43:34] of man ministry of brother Branham it
[43:36] was the last sign the last visitation
[43:39] before the child arrived all right now
[43:46] the seventh one was genesis 21:2 12 and
[43:56] this is where God told Abram
[43:59] specifically to cast out the bondwoman
[44:02] and the son because Sarah had said that
[44:06] and Abram did Abraham didn't know what
[44:07] to do and the spiritual blessing would
[44:10] be headed up in the seed Isaac so that
[44:14] was the seventh visitation their eighth
[44:18] Genesis 22 15 to 18 Abraham's so the
[44:23] eighth and final visit was after Isaac
[44:25] would come on the scene and God told
[44:29] Abraham that his obedience this is after
[44:31] the test right after the test God said
[44:33] your obedience would produce blessings
[44:36] and the seed would possess the gates of
[44:40] their enemies praise God
[44:41] so those are the eight
[44:46] all right now I have one more 8 I want
[44:49] to show and I remember this from years
[44:52] ago preaching this probably about 5
[44:53] years ago the life of Joseph in the Old
[44:57] Testament contained the stature of a
[45:01] perfect man because remember there were
[45:02] seven virtues in the statute for a man
[45:04] and the eighth was charity or love very
[45:07] good share your love so there are seven
[45:09] virtues God wanted to give each person
[45:11] before they got the baptism of the Holy
[45:13] Ghost and I remember this was also
[45:17] foreshadowed in the life of Joseph so
[45:19] let's go through each one
[45:21] first Joseph had faith or the revelation
[45:24] to speak his dreams God gave him that
[45:26] revelation to speak what he believed in
[45:29] what he saw that supernatural revelation
[45:32] second he had virtue he was morally
[45:35] sound he obeyed Jacob to seek his
[45:38] brothers a return with rapport but
[45:40] during that trip he sold into Egypt yet
[45:43] he chooses morality even the myths of
[45:46] the prison he chose morality which
[45:49] that's what virtue is its strength to
[45:51] live God's Word publicly in front of
[45:54] people
[45:55] that's what Joe did but did yeah it hurt
[45:57] you to live it in the prison so much so
[46:00] that he favored hard the third one was
[46:06] thought and so Joseph had knowledge or
[46:09] understanding to oversee all of out of
[46:11] her house and field and had prospered
[46:14] him greatly okay number four Joseph had
[46:22] temperance which is self-control we saw
[46:24] that when he was tempted by Potiphar's
[46:26] wife that evil woman tried to seduce him
[46:29] but he had temperance he had real holy
[46:32] spirit temperance he was able to turn
[46:34] down Potiphar his life patience number
[46:38] five is patience Joseph waited in prison
[46:41] for two years after being forgotten by
[46:44] the butler Baker that shows a lot of
[46:46] patience he didn't give up on God may
[46:49] have gotten discouraged but he overcame
[46:50] all that through the patience of God six
[46:54] he had godliness because the Bible said
[46:57] the Spirit of God is
[46:58] and Joseph who was Pharaoh that saw the
[47:03] Spirit of God in him so in order for him
[47:05] to be godly but God a spirit in him
[47:08] which even Pharaoh testified
[47:10] that's how we live is the children we
[47:13] should put such fate so people can see
[47:14] God in us we should be so gaudy with
[47:17] such godliness people know that we're
[47:19] true Christians and God is living in us
[47:21] even number seven this was the beautiful
[47:26] I mean these are all beautiful but this
[47:27] one especially beautiful seventh brother
[47:29] kindness
[47:31] Joseph forgives his brothers had sold
[47:33] them into Egypt and that's in Genesis 45
[47:36] one is 16
[47:37] what a beautiful type of the seventh
[47:40] virtue the virtue of brotherly kindness
[47:43] and number eights beautiful as well
[47:46] eight is charity and charity of course
[47:49] is love and that was when father Jacob
[47:53] and son Joseph embraced and had a holy
[47:58] kiss that's the type of Jesus receiving
[48:01] the baptism of Holy Ghost because
[48:02] brother Graham said heaven an earth
[48:04] kissed when the Holy See's it father and
[48:10] son you Nate
[48:11] while we are to turn unite with a
[48:13] Heavenly Father so you have the son
[48:15] uniting with the father and that's what
[48:17] happens at the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:19] the spirit of the father comes down and
[48:21] it joins or meets or kisses mr. piller
[48:25] that's us praise God
[48:27] amen beautiful all right all right let's
[48:33] look back to number nine a little bit
[48:35] further we've shown how 9 is fruit 9 is
[48:38] conservation
[48:39] it could mean finality or closure like
[48:43] we saw with doubting Thomas after night
[48:46] on the ninth day rather his doubts were
[48:48] all taken away because Jesus came and
[48:50] showed him as his nails and the nail
[48:52] scars on his hands feet and his side and
[48:55] I also represents judgment even as we
[48:57] saw as the gifts judge the church they
[49:00] keep the church clean now its interest
[49:04] 9 deals with judgments here's something
[49:07] new 9 is a factor of 666 so now I'm
[49:12] stopping for 666 I mean of course the
[49:17] mark of the beast the number of the
[49:19] Antichrist of course would be judgment
[49:22] on the world so that's interesting
[49:24] tonight as a factor of 666 this was new
[49:29] to me as well
[49:29] the first battle listed in the Bible
[49:33] between armies was in Genesis 14 and
[49:37] it's a battle between four kings and
[49:40] five kings which is 9 4 and 5 make 9
[49:43] this is when the four kings defeated the
[49:47] five kings one of which was one of the
[49:50] ones that was victorious was China
[49:52] Chedorlaomer I always say that word and
[49:54] Iran check the layover so the four kings
[49:58] defeat of the five and then Abram
[50:00] brought 300 some servants and defeated
[50:04] those four kings 4 he's God so 9 was
[50:09] like a judgment 9 armies all were judged
[50:13] were all defeated by Abraham ultimately
[50:16] right because before defeated the five
[50:18] and then Abraham defeated the four so
[50:21] the war there represents judgment all
[50:27] right I've never seen this one before
[50:28] this was new to me
[50:29] in Haggai chapter 1 verse 11
[50:33] there's the night watchman intrude on
[50:36] Israel because of her disobedience let's
[50:40] read that and I called for a drought
[50:42] upon the land so a drought first and
[50:46] then the drought was on the land the
[50:49] mountains the corn the new wine the oil
[50:54] upon that which the ground bringeth
[50:57] forth 6 upon the men's seventh upon the
[51:00] cattle 8 and upon all the labor of the
[51:03] hands 9 represent judgment I never seen
[51:08] that that was beautiful to see in the
[51:10] scripture this was new as well
[51:15] there's nine people recorded as being
[51:17] stoned in the Bible now some of them
[51:20] were justly some of them were unjustly
[51:22] and so we know sometimes men human men
[51:27] are sinners are allowed to to make wrong
[51:29] judgments of course most of their
[51:30] judgments are wrong so we'll look at
[51:33] that so there was a blasphemer who was
[51:35] stoned in Leviticus 24 14 the Sabbath
[51:39] breaker was stoned in numbers 1536 akin
[51:43] was stone and Joshua 7:25 or as that was
[51:46] just a bit Mallika was stoned and judges
[51:49] 953 I don't remember that once I can I
[51:52] can't make her comment on that one a
[51:54] Duran was stoned in first Kings twelve
[51:56] eighteen I don't remember that one
[51:58] maybethe was stoned in first Kings 21
[52:01] ten that was wrong that was unjust
[52:07] Zechariah was stoned in second
[52:09] chronicles 24 21 I believe that was
[52:11] unjust Stephen was stoned in Acts
[52:15] chapter 7 that was of course unjust and
[52:18] then Paul was stoned in acts 14 19 but
[52:23] God gave him the overcoming grace to be
[52:26] raised from the dead amen
[52:27] because he fell down as one day so nine
[52:29] stonings in the Bible so we can see how
[52:32] 9 represents judgment and one more point
[52:37] on number 9 before we get to number 10 9
[52:40] of course representing the fruit of the
[52:42] Spirit I thought it was very fitting
[52:45] that 9 is made by two factors three
[52:47] times three three represents divine
[52:50] things right perfection divine
[52:52] perfection and then and so 9 represents
[52:58] like a finality so 3 times 3 is 9 which
[53:02] makes fruit 9 is fruit the fruit or the
[53:05] finality of divine things I thought that
[53:07] was very fitting for gifts or sorry
[53:11] fruits of the Holy Spirit
[53:12] it's what divine things ultimately
[53:15] produce and of course that's what we
[53:17] know that's more important than anything
[53:19] else is having the fruit of the Spirit
[53:20] love is more important than all the
[53:22] other gifts course love is a fruit of
[53:23] the Holy Spirit because you can have all
[53:27] the gifts but without love
[53:29] doesn't profit as anything all right
[53:35] let me look at the battery real quick I
[53:37] forgot to plug it in okay good we're so
[53:38] 54% all right so we should be able to
[53:41] make it to the end of the service here
[53:43] and hopefully these things aren't
[53:45] blessing I I do appreciate the nice
[53:47] feedback from Wednesday night service
[53:48] the I got a couple texts said that they
[53:51] were really blessed by the Word of God
[53:52] so appreciate that and let's look at
[53:55] number 10 here by God's grace down
[54:00] brother Branham says number 10 is
[54:02] worldliness belanger says 10 is also
[54:06] divine order and I think there maybe
[54:09] this is my thought I think there could
[54:11] be number 10 as a faithful remnant as
[54:14] well I could be wrong on that but 10
[54:17] looks like a could be a faithful remnant
[54:19] so we'll look at that but let's first
[54:22] look at worldliness brother Ram says 10
[54:24] is worldliness now he's preaching and
[54:28] countdown 1962 and he says now I haven't
[54:31] tried to break this message down and
[54:32] give it a spiritual application as it
[54:34] would take too much time this morning
[54:36] but I want to try to explain this to you
[54:39] that 10 is the number of worldliness man
[54:43] and if you remember he said 10 is a
[54:47] number of worldliness man but 7 is a
[54:50] number of God's perfection 6 days he
[54:53] made the heavens and earth and the
[54:54] seventh arrested at six thousand years
[54:57] the world is the labor against sin or
[54:59] the church labor against sin and the
[55:00] seventh is the millennium or Sabbath so
[55:04] he just says it really really briefly
[55:06] that 10 is a number of worldliness and I
[55:09] thought well maybe it is so I went get
[55:12] up turn up it will s so the first one is
[55:16] in Genesis it was at 10 generations that
[55:22] God had got fed up in the world
[55:24] worldliness and destroyed the earth
[55:27] Adam Seth Enosh Cayden mahalia Jared
[55:32] Enoch Methuselah Lamech and Noah so on
[55:37] the 10th generation guy got fed up with
[55:40] the worldliness and destroyed the whole
[55:42] world
[55:43] interesting in Genesis 24 55 Rebecca's
[55:51] brother begged her stay with us about 10
[55:54] days just stay with us 10 days her
[55:59] family stay with the things of the world
[56:00] rather than separate yourself and go out
[56:02] to meet your bridegroom right amen so he
[56:05] see a beautiful type in that that she's
[56:08] offered 10 days just wait 10 days but
[56:12] she said no I'm gonna go immediately I'm
[56:14] I'm excited I'm so joyful I'm so
[56:17] thankful I can go meet my bridegroom
[56:19] amen and that's what we've done we've
[56:22] left the things of the world as well
[56:23] praise God to meet Jesus Christ some
[56:27] more examples here 10 is worldliness
[56:29] in this fact that Laban changed to 8 is
[56:34] 10 times in Genesis 30:1 144 if it was
[56:39] thing it on BET here this time and he's
[56:41] - he's changed my wages ten times
[56:44] of course meaning part of this is Jacob
[56:48] reaping what he sowed right because he
[56:50] deceived his father he deceived his
[56:53] brother and now he's reaping what he
[56:56] sowed so the world is paying him back
[56:58] right his father-in-law is paying him
[57:00] back and his wages are changed ten times
[57:06] here's a really good one we already kind
[57:08] of mentioned earlier but 12 spies were
[57:12] sent to the promised land how many of
[57:14] them doubted how many had worldly doubt
[57:16] 10 of them Lord amen and that's numbers
[57:21] chapter 13 so it's very interesting that
[57:25] 10 keeps showing up and as our text was
[57:29] there were 10 times Israel tempted God
[57:31] in the wilderness and so because of
[57:34] those 10 times God swore they would not
[57:36] see the promised land
[57:39] so God didn't let me go 11 God didn't
[57:42] let it go 9 God said I'll let you intend
[57:45] if you knew then you won't take promise
[57:48] then so it's 10 robbers Ben moral eNOS
[57:55] this was bright as well this is a
[57:57] beautiful type how many toes
[57:59] Nebuchadnezzar's great image half that
[58:03] great image of the times of Jen's house
[58:04] the Bible said ad ten toes that's right
[58:08] and then that was in daniel 241 and then
[58:13] later in Daniel 7 Daniel sees the four
[58:18] beasts that represent those four
[58:19] divisions on the great image and then he
[58:24] sees the fourth beasts have ten horns
[58:27] then if you read your Bible in
[58:29] revelation 12:3 revelation 13:1
[58:32] revelation 17:3
[58:34] 17 7 to 17 12 this beast has seven heads
[58:39] and ten horns and the Bible tells us the
[58:43] ten horns equal ten Kings which give
[58:47] their power to the Beast
[58:48] but then hates the great shortly
[58:51] after that so the ten represents
[58:55] worldliness ten worldly kings or
[58:57] kingdoms that are going to first unite
[59:00] with the Roman Catholic Church but then
[59:03] you come against her so hopefully
[59:07] everybody can see the tens there I got a
[59:08] couple more for worldliness in
[59:14] Deuteronomy 23 three and amirite I'm
[59:19] sorry an ammonite and Moabite would not
[59:21] enter into the congregation Lord even to
[59:24] the tenth generation they shall not
[59:29] enter into the congregation of the Lord
[59:30] forever now you know the reason they
[59:38] wouldn't be allowed in the the
[59:40] tabernacle is because all because of
[59:43] this that look how simple this is Israel
[59:46] was traveling through to the promised
[59:49] land and the ammonites and the Moabites
[59:51] would not give them bread or water so
[59:56] God said you can't come in the
[59:58] congregation your sins can be forgiven
[1:00:00] for ten generations which would be four
[1:00:02] hundred years no if you do 40 years for
[1:00:04] generation and also on top of that
[1:00:07] because they didn't get bread
[1:00:09] water and because they hired hello
[1:00:12] against Israel so there's three things
[1:00:15] God's because you've done that you won't
[1:00:17] go in the arch but you can your sins
[1:00:19] forgiven for ten generations
[1:00:21] I'll think about the other side of that
[1:00:23] Jesus you get a reward if you a cup of
[1:00:26] water in the name of the cycle hey see
[1:00:30] how much God cares enough just to be
[1:00:33] nice natural things for people feeding
[1:00:36] them giving them water giving them post
[1:00:38] they know sick as Hospital God cares so
[1:00:41] much about the small things
[1:00:43] well we think they're small but to God
[1:00:44] they're really great things but because
[1:00:47] the Moabites and the ammonites would not
[1:00:49] do the very little release things unto
[1:00:52] the least of god's children right God
[1:00:55] said I'm keeping you out for ten
[1:00:57] generations
[1:01:00] so that's Deuteronomy 23 - now I want
[1:01:05] you to see how brother branham grew in
[1:01:07] his understanding and maybe this will
[1:01:09] help some of us with our understanding
[1:01:13] in Deuteronomy 23 to relevance and a
[1:01:17] bastard child should not enter into the
[1:01:20] congregation of the Lord even to his
[1:01:23] tenth generation shall he not enter into
[1:01:25] the congregation the more so any child
[1:01:28] that was born outside of marriage
[1:01:30] marriage or holy wedlock we'd say if
[1:01:35] they're born illegitimately before a vow
[1:01:38] and before a marriage ceremony God would
[1:01:41] not let them in for 10 generations
[1:01:43] that's how awful God thought about
[1:01:46] having sperm before marriage I think
[1:01:48] about people we know or friends you know
[1:01:53] our friends get older when that window
[1:01:57] with a little woman or man choose to
[1:01:59] have a child before they're married it
[1:02:01] is such a disgrace it was such a
[1:02:03] disgrace in the eyes of God to see how
[1:02:07] much God loves marriage see how much God
[1:02:10] loves waiting until you find the right
[1:02:12] person to marry 400 years God said that
[1:02:18] bastard child is not coming in the
[1:02:20] congregation that means cambrian
[1:02:21] offering
[1:02:22] bring a lamb Camrys sacrifice or hundred
[1:02:26] years course he would die well before
[1:02:28] that so they've lost they wouldn't have
[1:02:32] a bit of worship I wouldn't let them in
[1:02:34] their church
[1:02:35] now with interesting Church the children
[1:02:37] and church interesting is that brother
[1:02:41] Brandon literally preached for numerous
[1:02:43] years until 1861 I'll give you one
[1:02:46] example and he preaches so hard a couple
[1:02:49] of times that there's a letter brother
[1:02:51] Jose JB Henry my brother Graham where
[1:02:54] brother Brandon has to write a letter to
[1:02:55] a woman and assure her that God now does
[1:02:59] forgive mothers and fathers that have
[1:03:02] illegitimate children and and God still
[1:03:04] or God can save bastard children because
[1:03:09] brother Branham preaches so hard let me
[1:03:11] give you one example this was in
[1:03:13] Jeffersonville LeBron says statistics
[1:03:15] show in the United States that there is
[1:03:17] more illegitimate children born then
[1:03:19] there is holy wedlock children did you
[1:03:22] know the Bible said in Deuteronomy that
[1:03:24] illegitimate child it takes four hundred
[1:03:26] years for that to run out their
[1:03:29] children's children's children's
[1:03:30] children children cannot stand
[1:03:32] grandfather was the element child and
[1:03:34] now he's out of the picture now what he
[1:03:38] says
[1:03:38] show me where it was changed so brother
[1:03:42] rather this is to show that brother man
[1:03:44] was a man and he had to grow in
[1:03:46] understanding as well or the RAM said
[1:03:50] show me where it's changed show me where
[1:03:52] God now can let bastard children in the
[1:03:55] church this is a 1959 almost three years
[1:04:01] later at the end of 1960 brother brandon
[1:04:07] has the revelation that the blood of
[1:04:10] Jesus Christ now can forgive and save
[1:04:14] and also baptize a bastard child into
[1:04:17] the kingdom of God amen
[1:04:20] so that's why it's so important to take
[1:04:22] everything we say everything everything
[1:04:25] we hear brother Graham say back to the
[1:04:26] Bible so important this is in Shreveport
[1:04:30] Louisiana
[1:04:30] well the Graham said a high breeding was
[1:04:32] such a horrible thing in the Old
[1:04:34] Testament God said
[1:04:36] our child should not enter the
[1:04:37] congregation Lord for 10 generations
[1:04:39] there's nothing to breed him out only
[1:04:41] that sin think ten generations four
[1:04:44] hundred years before an illegitimate
[1:04:46] child can ever come in the kingdom of
[1:04:48] God there was no serum to take it out of
[1:04:50] him
[1:04:50] he just had to breed it out through the
[1:04:52] family four hundred years before
[1:04:54] legitimate child could come in the
[1:04:56] congregation the Wow that's
[1:04:59] striking that met the reproach of that
[1:05:04] sin was so awful that God said you can't
[1:05:06] come to church for four hundred years
[1:05:08] that's how awful that sin is and
[1:05:10] children that's how important the
[1:05:13] marriage decision is so important now
[1:05:16] here's where here's a ring he corrects
[1:05:19] right here but today since the blood of
[1:05:22] Jesus Christ has been shed and you've
[1:05:25] been interbred by all different kinds of
[1:05:27] ideas the Holy Spirit is here this
[1:05:29] morning to breed you back to the
[1:05:31] original bring you back to Pentecost to
[1:05:34] breed you back amen
[1:05:35] other than that yeah so the Holy Ghost
[1:05:38] breed breeds you spiritually back into
[1:05:41] God's family
[1:05:42] amen he said that we sit together this
[1:05:45] morning in heavenly places in Christ
[1:05:47] Jesus letting the Holy Spirit work
[1:05:51] what is circumcising cutting off all the
[1:05:53] hybrid all the surplus the things of the
[1:05:56] world the things of the church age
[1:05:57] bringing us back to Pentecost like it
[1:06:00] was at the beginning amen
[1:06:02] there's that promise for the latter rain
[1:06:03] hallelujah we're the true Bride of
[1:06:05] Christ will be restored back to the
[1:06:07] original faith the full promise
[1:06:09] rapturing faith to bring us back to the
[1:06:12] blood of Jesus Christ breaks that curse
[1:06:15] of ten generations amen now here's one I
[1:06:19] had not seen before I preached it in a
[1:06:21] different angle but in 1st Corinthians 6
[1:06:24] 9 and 10 there are 10 evils listed that
[1:06:28] will not inherit the kingdom of God now
[1:06:30] when I did if you remember this a couple
[1:06:32] years ago I took these ten I added them
[1:06:36] to the seven things in Matthew or
[1:06:38] Matthew 15 where Jesus said these seven
[1:06:40] things to file man and then I added them
[1:06:43] with the nine or ten sins that Paul
[1:06:45] wrote to the Galatians in Galatians
[1:06:47] chapter five and I came up with 23
[1:06:50] three different sins that's what I came
[1:06:51] up with but if you just look at this one
[1:06:54] letter
[1:06:55] first Corinthians and the chapter six
[1:06:57] verse nine and ten Paul lists ten
[1:07:00] worldly sins that will not inherit the
[1:07:04] kingdom of God if not repent enough so
[1:07:07] the Bible says this know ye not that the
[1:07:09] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:07:10] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[1:07:12] fornicators idolaters adulterers
[1:07:15] effeminate which means a man who had a
[1:07:18] boy for child molestation purposes nor
[1:07:24] abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:07:27] that's homosexual nor thieves nor
[1:07:31] covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[1:07:33] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:07:36] of God I like verse 11 but such were
[1:07:39] some of you but you're wash you're
[1:07:41] justified you're sanctified by the
[1:07:44] spirit of our God
[1:07:45] amen thank God above Jesus Christ so
[1:07:48] that blood washes away those ten oh how
[1:07:51] are you those ten sins
[1:07:52] just like the blood washes away those
[1:07:54] ten generations of the bastard child
[1:07:56] hey I know yeah thank you lord none of
[1:08:00] Jesus Christ washes away all worldliness
[1:08:02] amen we're still going here a little bit
[1:08:09] longer to go a little bit more in
[1:08:14] Revelation 2 verse 10 under the
[1:08:17] submerging church age there was a
[1:08:20] prophecy in verse 10 revelation 2:10
[1:08:23] Jesus had feared none of those things
[1:08:26] which thou shalt suffer behold the devil
[1:08:29] shall cast some of you into prison that
[1:08:31] he may be tried and he shall have
[1:08:33] tribulation how many day is ten days be
[1:08:37] thou faithful unto death and I will give
[1:08:39] thee a crown of life now the church age
[1:08:45] book look Brandon
[1:08:49] said this he says it like this he says
[1:08:51] here's a prophecy of ten days with it is
[1:08:56] a means of determining the lifespan of
[1:08:58] the Samarin age
[1:08:59] Diocletian the cruelest of all Emperor's
[1:09:03] launched a terror campaign against the
[1:09:05] saints of God that except for the mercy
[1:09:08] of God would have wiped out all
[1:09:10] Christians it was the bloodiest in
[1:09:13] history and lasted 10 years or 10 days
[1:09:18] from 302 ad to 312 ad so that gives me a
[1:09:23] new thought I hadn't thought of that
[1:09:25] then a day can also equal one year a day
[1:09:29] can also equal a thousand years because
[1:09:32] the Bible says that one day with man is
[1:09:33] a thousand years with the Lord but also
[1:09:36] one day can make ten years I'm sorry no
[1:09:39] one day can make one year sorry of
[1:09:45] course that was seen with Jacob working
[1:09:49] fulfilling the week right fulfilling the
[1:09:52] seven days yeah putting the seven days
[1:09:54] for Rachel which was seven years that's
[1:09:57] right so each day represented a year all
[1:10:03] right so see that
[1:10:04] worldliness in ten days why ten his 10
[1:10:07] is a number of worldliness okay now this
[1:10:13] is interesting I just copy to paint the
[1:10:15] space of this straight from Bollinger
[1:10:17] there's ten persons who utter the
[1:10:22] confession I have sinned and acknowledge
[1:10:25] their and acknowledge their sin of these
[1:10:31] ten six were individual the number of a
[1:10:33] man and four were on behalf of the
[1:10:36] nation we so Pharaoh said I've sinned in
[1:10:39] Exodus 9:27 Balaam said I've sinned in
[1:10:43] numbers twenty to thirty four akin said
[1:10:45] I've sinned in Joshua seven twenty Saul
[1:10:47] said I've sinned it's for Samuel 15 20
[1:10:50] for David said he had sinned with
[1:10:52] Bathsheba of course in second Samuel
[1:10:55] twelve thirteen Jimmy I said he had
[1:10:58] sinned in second Samuel 19 20 I believe
[1:11:01] that was the man who was mocking
[1:11:02] David as he left Jerusalem I'm not
[1:11:05] mistaken but then God brought him back
[1:11:08] to repentance amen Hezekiah said he had
[1:11:12] sinned in second Kings eighteen fourteen
[1:11:14] which also said I've offended God at the
[1:11:16] word might be offended in the King James
[1:11:19] job said he had sinned in job 720 Mike I
[1:11:27] said he had sinned and I'm sorry no
[1:11:28] Micah speaks of a said we have sinned in
[1:11:31] Micah seven nine and in Nehemiah
[1:11:35] Nehemiah praying said we have sinned and
[1:11:37] Nehemiah 1 verse 6 so seaworthiness I
[1:11:41] sin I've committed worldly crime I'm
[1:11:43] living according to the will of the
[1:11:45] world right so we see worldliness as
[1:11:47] number 10 10 I have sins or we have sin
[1:11:54] all right
[1:11:56] now let's switch over we were at tennis
[1:11:59] worldliness let's switch over to divine
[1:12:00] order so it's C times where God ordered
[1:12:04] with the number and events that was
[1:12:05] going to happen so the first one the
[1:12:08] most obvious is the divine order of the
[1:12:10] Ten Commandments there are 613 laws in
[1:12:14] the Old Testament but God said you can
[1:12:16] remember them just by Ten Commandments
[1:12:19] if you keep these ten no fulfill all the
[1:12:22] other ones so God gives the order that
[1:12:25] great bacon number God gives the order
[1:12:27] of ten so he wrote these ten with the
[1:12:29] finger of God no other gods before me
[1:12:32] make no graven image do not take the
[1:12:36] name of the LORD thy God in vain
[1:12:37] remember the Sabbath keep it holy which
[1:12:40] for us is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:41] but of course also a day like today
[1:12:43] where we can just rest give the whole
[1:12:46] day to the Lord
[1:12:47] 5 honor your father and mother 6 do not
[1:12:52] kill 7 to the mountain do not commit
[1:12:54] adultery 8 do not steal 9 not bear false
[1:12:58] witness and then 10 do not covet and
[1:13:02] these 10 were all written by the finger
[1:13:04] of God
[1:13:04] God gave divine order to his people and
[1:13:08] to all the laws by giving a summary of
[1:13:11] 10 now it's interesting there's brother
[1:13:17] Branham said in the hidden life with
[1:13:18] Christ he said he said but inside the
[1:13:22] veil available for the hoist of voice
[1:13:24] there was an ark and in the ark was the
[1:13:27] tables the Ten Commandments as we call
[1:13:29] them and that represented the human
[1:13:31] heart
[1:13:33] so even God wrote one that those ten to
[1:13:36] represent or to be represented on the
[1:13:40] human heart which you know which makes
[1:13:42] sense you know God wouldn't expect us to
[1:13:45] memorize you know 613 laws but if we
[1:13:49] could memorize 10 that'd be a real
[1:13:51] blessing but 10 of those in our heart
[1:13:53] and if we do those 10 if we keep those
[1:13:56] 10 we would keep all the others so God
[1:13:59] one of those Ten Commandments in the Ark
[1:14:01] just like God wants just a simple
[1:14:03] summary in our hearts now we know the
[1:14:06] Bible also says Jesus says that all the
[1:14:09] laws fulfilling this
[1:14:10] one thing what is that no love is the
[1:14:15] fulfillment of the whole mall that's
[1:14:17] what paul says as well so when you love
[1:14:19] when you really just love people you'll
[1:14:22] never want to do anything wrong against
[1:14:23] them boys street than the way you want
[1:14:25] to be treated when you've got the love
[1:14:26] of God in your heart
[1:14:30] okay let's look at more of divine order
[1:14:35] now this is interesting
[1:14:38] God sent ten plagues against Egypt and
[1:14:41] in Exodus 914 God said all my plagues so
[1:14:46] there was no other plagues there was
[1:14:48] just ten plagues which shows God had a
[1:14:50] divine order a series of steps in order
[1:14:53] to break this this King right Pharaoh
[1:14:55] godless you use this divine order first
[1:14:58] was water to blood then frogs then lice
[1:15:02] then fleas then disease cattle and then
[1:15:07] boils on their human on their bodies and
[1:15:09] then hail and then locusts then darkness
[1:15:13] and lastly the death of the firstborn
[1:15:17] interesting in the the firstborn is like
[1:15:19] a tithe to the Lord as well there's
[1:15:21] another tenth so God gave that order ten
[1:15:26] steps it had to be in that order and the
[1:15:28] tenth one finally broke Pharaoh after he
[1:15:31] saw his firstborn died he said finally
[1:15:33] get out of here and that's where mother
[1:15:35] Graham said you can live so close to God
[1:15:37] that Satan won't know what to do with
[1:15:39] you amen
[1:15:40] Moses lives so close to God and the
[1:15:43] Pharaoh didn't the devil and Pharaoh
[1:15:45] didn't want anything to do with him and
[1:15:46] so he kicked him out that's how we want
[1:15:48] to live we live so close to God they
[1:15:50] won't know what to do with us no matter
[1:15:51] what temptation comes we cast it down we
[1:15:54] just say so in love with Jesus sort of
[1:15:56] order to Jesus that saint won't know
[1:15:58] what to do amen praise God now
[1:16:09] this is interesting divine order
[1:16:13] la easer travel with ten camels to bring
[1:16:18] back Rebecca and her maidens so Rebecca
[1:16:23] could be a bride for Isaac
[1:16:25] remember camels represent beasts or
[1:16:28] power that's interesting
[1:16:31] ten camels had to pack all all over
[1:16:35] Becca's items and all the items of the
[1:16:37] maidens God used ten so that's
[1:16:40] interesting ten here's a one about
[1:16:47] tithing ten represents a tithe so
[1:16:55] Abraham as he received the whole victory
[1:16:59] I'm sorry
[1:17:01] Abraham freely gave milk as like a tenth
[1:17:04] as he realized the whole victory came
[1:17:07] from the God's divine order so God had
[1:17:10] ordered all the steps of this battle
[1:17:11] eating up with the four kings and when
[1:17:15] Abraham recognized that he recognized
[1:17:19] that God ordered everything God ordered
[1:17:21] a hundred percent of the victory and I
[1:17:24] don't ask pen back in return so there
[1:17:28] ten represents a time so the tenth is
[1:17:31] something odd God wants us to offer to
[1:17:34] recognize God pan was in it Olivia
[1:17:38] oh now let me another one are the ten
[1:17:41] lepers only one came back I forgot about
[1:17:43] that that's I forgot about all that so
[1:17:46] that tenth belongs to God that tenth is
[1:17:48] what man God wants man to do God wants
[1:17:52] man to give a tenth in return to
[1:17:54] recognize that this was divinely ordered
[1:17:57] of God God ordered all the steps God led
[1:18:00] me this Scott God taught me to do this
[1:18:02] guys show me how to do this and I'm
[1:18:04] gonna bring this tenth back so I thought
[1:18:08] that was really beautiful hope you're
[1:18:11] enjoying this this is I love this I love
[1:18:13] seeing these uh principles in the Word
[1:18:15] of God next
[1:18:22] Hotel written it's real and God brought
[1:18:26] out is feel out of Egypt all the males
[1:18:29] 20 years and upward had to pay a half
[1:18:34] shekel of redemption money okay
[1:18:38] the firstborn had to pay ten times that
[1:18:40] was the tenth again for the firstborn
[1:18:43] but every male 20 years and upward had
[1:18:46] to pay a hash beca which was ten gayest
[1:18:49] i think that's the little garrus garrus
[1:18:52] and if you remember list money paid for
[1:18:55] the service of the tabernacle to
[1:18:58] atonement for their souls so again just
[1:19:01] like the tithing God was showing that he
[1:19:05] redeemed Israel by paying the full price
[1:19:07] for their Redemption
[1:19:09] just like with no Kasdan God Abraham
[1:19:12] knew God it was God it was no Kazakh who
[1:19:14] gave him that full victory it was God's
[1:19:16] divine order and then God was only
[1:19:20] asking those males now after they
[1:19:22] brought out of Egypt to give and
[1:19:25] acknowledge that with a ten Gera
[1:19:27] offering so 10 is man acknowledging
[1:19:31] God's hundred-percent provision with
[1:19:34] just his own tent its man recognizing
[1:19:37] God's divine order I think about people
[1:19:39] that don't pay ties they're failing to
[1:19:43] recognize that God gave me a hundred
[1:19:44] percent and they can't even give back
[1:19:46] this tenth to recognize God God's divine
[1:19:50] order in their life not on the day of
[1:19:58] Pentecost that was the tenth day they've
[1:20:01] been waiting so they had to fulfill the
[1:20:04] divine order of the fifty day they are
[1:20:09] feast of Pentecost requirement so
[1:20:11] there's a divine order they had the way
[1:20:13] there could not have came on the ninth
[1:20:15] day the eleventh could have came on the
[1:20:17] seventh day they had to fall in line
[1:20:19] with God's divine order for number ten
[1:20:24] and I just preached
[1:20:26] Wednesday I didn't catch it but there
[1:20:31] were 10 trials listed in Romans 8 38 and
[1:20:37] 39 and the Bible says that the love of
[1:20:41] Jesus Christ is greater than all 10 of
[1:20:44] these so the words God may allow all
[1:20:47] these all these trials to order in our
[1:20:49] lives with the love of Jesus Christ can
[1:20:52] can where we can't be separated from the
[1:20:55] love of Jesus Christ this might be a
[1:20:57] worldliness to I maybe I put this in the
[1:20:59] wrong one well let's read it Paul said
[1:21:02] bribes persuade and neither death nor
[1:21:04] life nor Angels nor principalities nor
[1:21:07] powers there's five numbers 39 nor
[1:21:11] things present nor things to come nor
[1:21:13] height nor depth nor any other creature
[1:21:16] can separate us from the love of Christ
[1:21:18] amen
[1:21:19] I might even move that to worldliness
[1:21:21] after the service there all those
[1:21:24] worldly things all the worldly powers
[1:21:26] all the principalities and powers
[1:21:29] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:21:32] Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:36] praise the Lord just a few more minutes
[1:21:38] I'm going to close in 15 minutes is that
[1:21:40] okay with everybody
[1:21:42] at the little joke here's another one on
[1:21:47] divine order this was interesting I
[1:21:49] never seen this before there are ten
[1:21:52] parables Jesus preaches on the kingdom
[1:21:56] of heaven he literally says that's 10
[1:21:59] times which looks like divine order
[1:22:02] looks like showing God's divine order on
[1:22:04] how to enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:22:05] that's what it looks like to me because
[1:22:08] there's seven in Matthew 13 there's one
[1:22:12] in Matthew 22 and there's one in Matthew
[1:22:15] 25
[1:22:17] so let's rehearse those real quick the
[1:22:20] first parable was the seeds on the four
[1:22:22] kinds of grounds so if you want to be
[1:22:24] more proof of the kingdom of God what do
[1:22:26] you need an honest and sincere heart and
[1:22:28] you'll bring forth much fruit that means
[1:22:34] a lot of liars in the you know in the
[1:22:36] other three groups people that I have
[1:22:38] cares of the world they must be either
[1:22:40] lying to themselves or lying to God or
[1:22:42] line to other people because it's a good
[1:22:44] honest heart that brings forth fruit
[1:22:46] some thirty sixty and a hundredfold the
[1:22:50] second parable the wheat and the tares
[1:22:52] or they both look the same Jesus had let
[1:22:55] them grow together until the harvest we
[1:22:58] must bow to the Word of God now try to
[1:23:00] impersonate the Word of God but bow to
[1:23:02] it and obey it
[1:23:03] third is the grain of mustard seed which
[1:23:07] possibly could be faith it could be but
[1:23:10] most accordingly it looks like it is the
[1:23:13] mustard seed of sin that started the the
[1:23:17] foss church the Roman Catholic Church
[1:23:19] and now all the all the all the evil
[1:23:23] files are perched upon that tree because
[1:23:26] the Bible says of Revelation 18 that
[1:23:29] she's a cage of unclean and hateful bird
[1:23:32] number four the leaven hid in three
[1:23:34] measures of meal that's the ugly that's
[1:23:38] the Trinitarian doctrine I believe that
[1:23:40] that was hid and God's threefold
[1:23:42] manifestation they hid a lie in there
[1:23:45] and then it grew and grew into it
[1:23:47] eleven all the doctrine of the Roman
[1:23:50] Catholic Church and course many
[1:23:51] Protestants as well fifth the treasure
[1:23:55] hid in a field this is the one the
[1:23:58] parable where you're surprised this is a
[1:24:01] parable where he's not really looking
[1:24:02] for it where God surprises you and six
[1:24:08] is the Pearl great price this is one
[1:24:09] where they're actually looking for
[1:24:10] wisdom they're actually looking for the
[1:24:12] something supernatural and they have to
[1:24:15] forsake their all the other pearls in
[1:24:17] order to gain the one pearl we show to
[1:24:20] different approaches to God you get to
[1:24:21] the kingdom of heaven either way whether
[1:24:23] God surprises you or whether you're
[1:24:24] already looking for and praise the Lord
[1:24:27] number seven the net cast in the sea
[1:24:30] which shows the anointed ones at the end
[1:24:32] times that's the mystery behind that
[1:24:34] where the gospel attracts many people
[1:24:37] but only those that have the true
[1:24:39] character the true seed of the true
[1:24:41] nature of God those are the only ones
[1:24:43] that will not be cast away at the end
[1:24:44] ones that God really wants to use and
[1:24:47] keep
[1:24:48] okay so that's the first seven now I
[1:24:54] must have missed one I must have missed
[1:24:56] one yeah I think I miss one I only have
[1:25:00] nine on my note so sorry about that have
[1:25:01] to go look I think there was two maybe
[1:25:02] in Matthew chapter 22
[1:25:05] but there's Matthew 22 there's the
[1:25:08] parable that Cain who bit his servants
[1:25:10] to invite people to the marriage of his
[1:25:12] son there must be another one in there
[1:25:15] and then in Matthew 25 of course we know
[1:25:17] that parable the wise and foolish
[1:25:19] virgins and all these deal with the
[1:25:22] kingdom of heaven with the New Testament
[1:25:23] covenant the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:26] they all deal with that okay this is
[1:25:31] interesting there's 10 I am in the book
[1:25:33] of John I am the bread of life I'm The
[1:25:37] Living bread I am the light of the world
[1:25:38] before Abraham was I am I am the one
[1:25:42] that bear witness to myself he says
[1:25:44] Jesus says Jesus says I am the door to
[1:25:47] the Sheep I'm the Good Shepherd I am the
[1:25:49] resurrection of life I am the way the
[1:25:51] truth and the life
[1:25:52] lastly I am The True Vine there's 10 I
[1:25:55] am that can be showing God's divine
[1:25:58] order ordering Jesus as the I am fire
[1:26:05] came down from heaven 10 times in the
[1:26:07] Bible on Sodom on the first offerings in
[1:26:11] the tabernacle the biggest 9:24 on
[1:26:14] native and by who in numbers 11 one of
[1:26:18] the murmurs of tabara
[1:26:20] number 1635 encore and his company on
[1:26:24] Elijah's offering at Carmel the first
[1:26:31] time
[1:26:31] Elijah's enemies in first Kings 110 and
[1:26:34] the second time on more of his enemies
[1:26:37] in second Kings 112 and then in first
[1:26:42] chronicles 21 26 fire fell and David
[1:26:44] sacrifice in Jerusalem and then when
[1:26:47] Solomon Solomon dedicated the temple it
[1:26:49] fell for the tenth time in second
[1:26:52] chronicles 7 one so interesting God's
[1:26:55] divine order so there's that as well
[1:26:58] worldliness perhaps maybe a couple
[1:27:02] meetings there there's 10 times the
[1:27:04] people shouted for joy in the Bible so
[1:27:06] I'm not sure how that works but I'll
[1:27:10] just read it real quick fire from heaven
[1:27:12] consume the first sacrifices they
[1:27:14] shouted in limiting his 9:24 they
[1:27:17] shouted at the taking of Jericho and
[1:27:18] Joshua 6:20 when the ark was brought
[1:27:22] into the camp they shouted first samuel
[1:27:24] 45 when saul was chosen as king the
[1:27:26] people shouted first samuel 1024 when
[1:27:31] his were went to fight the philistines
[1:27:33] they shouted first say no 17 20 when
[1:27:36] they tell us that the philistines were
[1:27:38] pursuing them they shouted first name of
[1:27:41] 1752 then second samuel 6:15 when the
[1:27:45] ark was brought back from the house of
[1:27:46] obed-edom the people shouted for joy
[1:27:50] when god smoked Jeroboam before abaya
[1:27:53] the people shouted when a mate I'm sorry
[1:27:56] when a son and the people heard of omens
[1:27:59] prophecy they shouted and in Ezra 3:11
[1:28:04] when the foundation of the second temple
[1:28:06] was laid by saruba both the people
[1:28:09] shouted 10 shouting interesting almost
[1:28:13] done there are 10
[1:28:19] just curses in the Bible that God gave
[1:28:22] first on the serpent then on the ground
[1:28:25] then on Cain and on Canaan then on
[1:28:28] Jericho and then on aiken then on the
[1:28:32] Gibeonites then on the sheeter mites
[1:28:34] then on high l the bethe light and the
[1:28:38] last time was when Jesus cursed the fig
[1:28:40] tree ten curses by God in the Bible
[1:28:44] interesting here's another one but this
[1:28:51] kind of goes into 10000 the Bible said
[1:28:54] when when Jesus after he came and took
[1:28:57] the book before he opened the seals the
[1:29:00] Bible said I heard a voice of many
[1:29:02] angels round about the throne and the
[1:29:03] beasts of the owners and the number of
[1:29:05] them was ten thousand times ten thousand
[1:29:08] and thousand thousands so ten thousand
[1:29:11] times ten thousand is a hundred million
[1:29:12] I looked it up today so I didn't get
[1:29:14] that wrong so it looks like more divine
[1:29:17] order so you have ten thousand times ten
[1:29:18] thousand your God ordering things and
[1:29:23] the last thing is so I'm almost done
[1:29:25] blessing I think ten might also be a
[1:29:30] faithful remnant number as well so I
[1:29:35] could be wrong
[1:29:36] but this is my thought because there's
[1:29:38] there's three witnesses where it looks
[1:29:39] like ten is a number of faithful
[1:29:42] remnants there were twelve tribes of
[1:29:46] Israel and how many were blotted out for
[1:29:50] idolatry two so that left ten that were
[1:29:52] faithful that never had to have their
[1:29:55] names removed or changed through the
[1:30:00] progress of the tribes of Israel
[1:30:02] like we mean the progress from from a
[1:30:05] promised land to Egypt and then back to
[1:30:08] the promised land and then to the to the
[1:30:11] Millennium yah I'm so I'm sorry no to
[1:30:15] the 144,000 and then to the money and
[1:30:17] there's the four steps of the twelve
[1:30:20] tribes of Israel all right so see 10 out
[1:30:24] of the 12 were faithful only two of them
[1:30:27] went into idolatry also when Abraham
[1:30:34] prayed to God to spare sign of God's and
[1:30:37] I will spare that if there's ten there's
[1:30:40] ten but their work there weren't only
[1:30:43] eight so it looks like dog with his
[1:30:48] spirit if there was at least a group of
[1:30:51] ten of course we know that so it seemed
[1:30:55] like God saw 10 as a faithful remnant
[1:31:00] and then lastly our last one is Jesus
[1:31:05] described how many virgins who were
[1:31:07] looking for the coming of the bridegroom
[1:31:08] 10 10 of course we know five we'll
[1:31:12] actually made it to see it but all 10
[1:31:15] were looking and remember the the
[1:31:17] foolish they were faithful to what they
[1:31:19] knew they were a virgin to the word they
[1:31:22] were just foolish in the aspect of
[1:31:23] taking more oil they didn't really
[1:31:25] prepare I didn't pray up like we heard
[1:31:29] so 10 seems to be faithful remnant as
[1:31:33] well as I told you I think I'm
[1:31:37] stop right there by the grace of Lord
[1:31:38] hope that was a blessing I'm al Qaeda
[1:31:41] coming to the piano here why don't we
[1:31:47] stand your family we'll just in I ask
[1:31:49] everybody to stand there at their house
[1:31:50] if they can let's just look to the Lord
[1:31:58] here you know as I'm looking at these
[1:32:03] numbers it just seems like you know 9
[1:32:05] was judgment and hate was ones we'd
[1:32:07] already heard before and then 10 had
[1:32:10] divine order worldliness and also a
[1:32:13] faithful part let's just pray that God
[1:32:16] would keep all the worldliness out of
[1:32:17] our hearts praise God there's in fact
[1:32:25] the majority of the 10 scriptures were
[1:32:28] about worldliness so that's God to help
[1:32:31] us to not be a part of worldliness but
[1:32:33] to do the good side which was a faithful
[1:32:36] remnant let's be that one of the 10
[1:32:39] right let's be that tithe let's be that
[1:32:41] 1 out of 10 that recognizing what God
[1:32:45] has done for us we come back and we
[1:32:46] recognize God's hand in our life to give
[1:32:49] us the full victory we come back and we
[1:32:51] want to give God thanks let's do that
[1:32:52] today as we bow our head sir let's pray
[1:32:57] Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[1:32:59] word of God today Lord your prophets

[1:34:08] part of the kingdom of God as we saw the
