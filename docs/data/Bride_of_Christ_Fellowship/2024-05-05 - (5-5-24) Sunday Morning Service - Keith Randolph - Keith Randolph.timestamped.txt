[0:00] we're not going to do that we're going
[0:01] to read from the scripture we're going
[0:02] to preach this morning I got quite a
[0:04] lengthy portion of scripture to read and
[0:07] I was reading it again this morning
[0:09] should I read the whole thing but it's
[0:11] an
[0:12] interesting story so to speak if you'll
[0:16] listen to it you'll be blessed because
[0:19] we're going to talk about maybe the
[0:21] greatest King even greater David was a
[0:24] great king but this
[0:27] King was a great king king jiah we're
[0:31] going to we're going to read about that
[0:32] in the scripture almost probably read
[0:34] the whole chapter and first we would
[0:38] just uh like to pray and then we'll open
[0:42] our Bibles to 2 Kings the 23rd chapter
[0:46] after we pray heavenly father as we
[0:50] approach you this morning with
[0:53] reverence Lord we ask your blessings
[0:56] upon this portion of the service
[1:00] Lord that our hearts would be prepared
[1:03] to
[1:05] receive the engrafted word which is able
[1:08] to give us exactly what we need at this
[1:12] very moment we are going to look into
[1:15] the scripture and I pray God that you
[1:17] would help me to deliver what is on my
[1:20] heart hide me behind the cross of
[1:23] Calvary give me the right words to speak
[1:26] this morning that my words would will
[1:29] bless me and not condemn me but my words
[1:32] will bless also the ones that are
[1:34] listening for we ask it in Jesus name
[1:37] amen I've been having a little bit
[1:39] trouble ears been plugged up and the
[1:42] doctor trying to get those unplugged
[1:43] they're not unplugged yet I've had a lot
[1:46] of physical problems but I'm here and
[1:49] you probably know that my wife passed
[1:51] away March 2nd so I'm still in
[1:55] overcoming that but uh I'll tell you
[1:58] what she told me before we read the
[2:01] scripture I preached the the funeral she
[2:04] died March 2nd the funeral wasn't until
[2:06] March 12th I I forget March I forget
[2:09] when and I made a schedule to preach
[2:12] just a couple days later and I wondered
[2:15] I said am I preaching too
[2:17] soon but I remember what she said she
[2:21] always said there was nothing going to
[2:24] stop Keith from preaching it's what my
[2:26] wife said sickness he'd go preach if he
[2:29] was sick and that's what I'm doing I'm
[2:31] doing exactly what she would want me to
[2:33] do in 2 Kings uh chapter
[2:37] 23 22 because we're going to look at 23
[2:41] maybe too uh chapter 22 Josiah listen
[2:47] that was eight years old when he began
[2:49] to Reign and he reigned 31 years in
[2:53] Jerusalem and is I heard you're still
[2:55] turning your pages for you find your
[2:58] place he was 8 years old when he began
[3:01] to Reign and he reigned 31 years in
[3:04] Jerusalem and his mother's name was Jedi
[3:07] the daughter of adah ab boscus now I
[3:10] might pronounce a lot of these words
[3:12] wrong and he did that which was right in
[3:15] the sight of the Lord now remember
[3:18] that first of all I want you know what
[3:20] the word Josiah
[3:24] means whom Jehovah
[3:27] heals listen you're going to find out as
[3:29] we go on what happened to
[3:33] Josiah he did that which was right in
[3:37] the sight of the Lord and walked in all
[3:39] the way of David his father and turned
[3:42] not aside to the right hand to the left
[3:44] brother BL said it's the middle of the
[3:46] road gospel he didn't turn to the left
[3:48] or the right but there was things going
[3:50] on when he was ruling you'll find
[3:54] out and it came to pass in the 18th year
[3:57] of King Josiah that the king sent sh the
[4:00] son of aelia the Son Of mashalam The
[4:03] Scribe to the house of the Lord saying
[4:06] go to
[4:07] H Kaa now hilaya means Jehovah is my
[4:12] portion now I want while you're standing
[4:16] you know brother Brandon went to or
[4:18] Roberts uh his great big uh office and
[4:22] how beautiful it was and this other one
[4:25] how beautiful it was and brother Brandon
[4:27] went home and says man who am I you know
[4:31] and you know and everything and God
[4:33] spoke to him and said I am your portion
[4:37] he had a little office with a
[4:39] typewriter yeah
[4:42] okay
[4:43] and it came to pass in the 18th year of
[4:47] Josiah that the king okay we we'll kep
[4:50] down go to up to haaiah the high priest
[4:54] that he may th the silver which is
[4:56] brought into the house of the Lord which
[4:58] the keepers of the door have given
[4:59] gathered into the people and let them
[5:02] deliver into the hand of the doers of
[5:03] the work that have oversight over the
[5:07] house of the Lord and let them give it
[5:09] to the doers of the work which is in the
[5:11] house of the Lord to repair the breaches
[5:14] of the house unto the Carpenters and
[5:17] Builders and that's common we all do
[5:19] that and Masons and to buy Timber and
[5:21] heun stone to repair the
[5:23] house howbeit there was no Reckoning
[5:27] made with them of the money that was
[5:28] delivered into the hand because they
[5:30] dealt
[5:31] Faithfully they were trying to do what
[5:34] was right remember trying to do what was
[5:37] right but all around them you'll find
[5:40] out there was something not right in
[5:42] hilah the high priest said into father
[5:46] The Scribe I have found the book of the
[5:50] law in the house of the
[5:56] Lord and elak gave the book to shaan
[6:00] and he read it something's
[6:03] happening and shaon the Scribe came to
[6:06] the king and brought the king word again
[6:08] and said thy servants have gathered the
[6:10] money that was found in the house and
[6:12] delivered into the hand of them that do
[6:14] the work and have oversight over the
[6:16] house of the Lord and shaon the Scribe
[6:19] showed the king saying heah the priest
[6:21] ha delivered me a book and shaon read it
[6:25] before some people believe that's the
[6:27] original five books of Moses
[6:29] you know and it came to pass but it was
[6:32] hid hid
[6:35] away when the king had heard the words
[6:38] of the book of the law that he rent his
[6:42] clothes something be to happen that's
[6:46] what happened in this day the revelation
[6:48] of the seven seal the opening of the
[6:50] full word something begin to
[6:56] happen brother Brandon said it became a
[6:58] new book I want you to stand too long I
[7:00] can let you sit in a
[7:06] minute and the King commanded heah the
[7:09] priest and ham the son of shafan theore
[7:12] the son of Micaiah the shaon The Scribe
[7:15] and asahiah the servant of the king
[7:17] saying go you inquire of the Lord for me
[7:20] and for the people and for all Judah
[7:22] concerning the works of this the words
[7:25] of this book that is found great is the
[7:28] Wrath of the Lord that is kindled
[7:31] against us because our fathers have not
[7:34] hearkened into the words of this book to
[7:36] do according to all that is written
[7:40] concerning us you may be seated we'll
[7:43] stop right there but we're going to go
[7:44] on in a
[7:48] minute I wonder if I could title this
[7:53] message the new
[7:56] book I wasn't looking for it
[8:00] but it found
[8:02] me I wasn't looking for it but he found
[8:05] me
[8:06] now this book it's a document they found
[8:12] and see at that
[8:14] time I was reading in a
[8:18] commentary Matthew Henry's commentary I
[8:20] love this commentary he tells exactly
[8:23] what was going on during this period of
[8:26] time he said at that period of time they
[8:29] had a what they call a a verbal reading
[8:34] of the law every seven years can you m
[8:37] only every seven years but even that was
[8:40] not practiced and let me just tell
[8:44] you this this is what was going
[8:48] on can you imagine Josiah did what was
[8:52] right according to what he
[8:54] thought we all do that we do what is
[8:57] right according to to what we think is
[9:04] right at that time I going to read this
[9:07] people generally took up
[9:11] abstracts like our
[9:13] abridgments to save the themselves the
[9:16] trouble of writing the people reading
[9:18] the book at large sort of a
[9:21] ritual directing them in the observance
[9:24] of religion but leaving out the main
[9:26] thought particularly the promises and
[9:29] the
[9:31] threatenings That's What affected Josiah
[9:34] so when he begin to see what was in the
[9:37] book see brother brand said when those
[9:39] seals was opened it became a new book
[9:43] still the Bible see the message came
[9:46] from the
[9:49] Bible the Bible didn't come from the
[9:51] message the message came from the Bible
[10:00] see they even it was a command for the
[10:05] king
[10:06] to every once a while to write this law
[10:09] a pin over again they were not doing
[10:13] that it was not exerted I forgot to
[10:16] bring a handkerchief with me so the
[10:19] motel I got me a bunch of
[10:21] kleenexes I did everything I did
[10:25] everything but what my wife as she was
[10:27] living told me to do she said I always
[10:30] carry your hanky with you you can wipe
[10:32] your nose not with your fingers but I
[10:35] forget I'm a preacher so I don't have
[10:39] her you know you know what it's like
[10:42] when you you lose part of
[10:44] yourself you
[10:46] know I better not talk about that I'll
[10:49] start crying but see I want you to see
[10:53] what was going on in that time and
[10:55] that's the same thing down through the
[10:56] church ages The Messengers kept bringing
[10:59] forth the
[11:01] word through justification
[11:03] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[11:06] Ghost and to the full
[11:07] word when it came to pass in our day in
[11:13] my day now I'm a old man now I used to
[11:17] say the only person that called me an
[11:18] old man was my
[11:20] wife uh you know brother B said don't
[11:24] call your father old man or your wife or
[11:27] your mother old man you don't do that
[11:29] you know so uh I could tell a lot of
[11:33] stories I usually try to do that but I
[11:36] won't you know first of all another
[11:38] thing did you know there was a prophecy
[11:40] given for Josiah even named his name
[11:42] before he became king here it is first
[11:44] king 132 and he cried against the altar
[11:48] in the word of the Lord and said oh
[11:51] altar altar thus say the Lord Behold a
[11:53] child shall be born in the House of
[11:55] David Josiah by name and upon thee shall
[11:59] shall he offer the priests of the high
[12:01] places that burn incense and the and
[12:04] men's bones shall be burnt upon them see
[12:07] what happened in this day when the
[12:08] message came forth
[12:12] judgment judgment did you know that I
[12:16] experienced this I I've
[12:19] been I got saved in
[12:22] 1968 I came in the message receive the
[12:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost In
[12:26] 1980 but I've seen it come to pass how
[12:29] what is going on and and so some Realms
[12:33] if you mentioned brother Bard's name
[12:35] it's almost like a curse
[12:37] word you know why because it brings
[12:40] condemnation
[12:41] on brings
[12:44] condemnation
[12:48] see but that's the way that's the
[12:56] thing my nose have disappeared
[13:03] there they
[13:05] are I always found out don't get nervous
[13:08] when something goes wrong because it's
[13:11] once you don't know what goes on when
[13:12] you go overseas what goes wrong I got up
[13:15] to preach sometimes from the public The
[13:17] public's way down
[13:19] here I preach with no lights I preach
[13:22] from candle light uh lamp light uh all
[13:27] kinds of Lights a lot of places they
[13:29] have brown outs I preached many
[13:32] different places oh I can't tell
[13:36] stories I don't have
[13:38] time
[13:41] huh I was up in the mountains
[13:44] preaching you probably heard I probably
[13:46] told this story before when you talk
[13:48] about brown outs and they had a brown
[13:50] out up there and up in the mountains and
[13:52] uh I was having a crusade meeting
[13:54] outside and and all of a sudden the
[13:57] Lights Went Out we had cell phone light
[14:00] flashlight or something all the lights
[14:02] went out and the people up there the
[14:04] people dressed different than in the
[14:06] Lans they're more primitive up in the
[14:08] mountains of the igaro tribes and they
[14:11] begin to
[14:13] leave I I'll just make a short a story
[14:16] short and brother Dan and my traveling
[14:19] companion
[14:20] for 1993 I guess and he was I glad he
[14:26] was speaking in English he kept saying
[14:27] oh my God oh my God oh my God I stood up
[14:32] behind the pulpit and said there's a man
[14:34] I no no no no microphone there was dead
[14:38] there's a man here that can turn on the
[14:40] lights and all of a sudden they came on
[14:43] my did we have a Revival service that
[14:46] day oh my but
[14:50] see you look at it in this
[14:57] time it's brother BR said it's scien
[15:00] proof that it is the truth we don't
[15:03] worry about whether it's the truth
[15:06] scientifically spiritually and what was
[15:08] said to come to pass of the message of
[15:10] the Seven Seals in their closing that's
[15:13] the message of the entire
[15:15] Bible Seven Seals closes the New
[15:18] Testament sealed it up that is true and
[15:21] we know that is the prophetic utterance
[15:24] by scientific and by the word there
[15:28] three was given the witness to it that
[15:30] it's the truth everything we have need
[15:33] of is in the
[15:35] book everything we have need brother
[15:37] brother's Revelation was
[15:40] Progressive even after the seals open it
[15:43] was Progressive when he uh uh who is
[15:46] this MDC you want to understand about
[15:48] your theology who is this MDC and you go
[15:51] on and read and read and read and read
[15:53] and read but I always like this
[15:56] quote uh uh in the visible Union of the
[16:00] Bride you see the new book I wasn't
[16:02] looking for it but he found me I wasn't
[16:05] looking for it I was running from the
[16:08] presence of God I I it
[16:13] uh I'll just say this I got to throw
[16:15] this in once in a while and my wife's
[16:19] funeral in the
[16:22] funeral after we got home a brother it
[16:25] was live stream he turned on to the
[16:28] video
[16:29] and he watched the video and he
[16:32] contacted me right away did you know as
[16:36] I walked away from the casket there was
[16:38] doves flying from the
[16:40] casket literal doves my son went to the
[16:44] funeral home and said we do not do
[16:47] anything that it was
[16:49] real so I thought
[16:52] i'
[16:55] see brother B said this same word sucked
[16:57] up through the at through these and come
[17:00] out and come to a head and all that life
[17:03] that come through there picked up its
[17:07] people now it's forming up into a head
[17:10] for the
[17:13] Rapture when you are separated from your
[17:16] first Union by spiritual death now you
[17:19] are born again or remarried again to
[17:22] your new spiritual union not your
[17:25] natural life of the things of the world
[17:27] but of eternal life that germ that was
[17:29] in you at the beginning found
[17:33] you I wasn't looking for it but he found
[17:37] me I wasn't looking for
[17:40] it see that German that was in me found
[17:44] me
[17:46] now we're going to go on
[17:51] now things begin to change around
[17:54] Josiah you know can you imagine he ran
[17:58] rained the best of his AB that's what we
[18:00] all did that's the way I
[18:02] did I was Baptist by
[18:07] birth I I I went to church every Sunday
[18:12] I we we never missed the service and my
[18:15] dad would throw cold water in my face
[18:17] even when I got older and made me go to
[18:19] church we was always
[18:23] there always there I was always there
[18:26] Sunday school class always there always
[18:29] there training Union and even I was
[18:32] always there I was trained I knew the
[18:35] scripture
[18:37] but but just
[18:41] Parts
[18:43] abstracts not the whole thing you ought
[18:45] to be thankful that you got the whole
[18:49] book not the Bible but the revelation of
[18:52] the word of
[18:54] God lot of people read from this Bible
[18:59] do you know the reason you got this
[19:02] Bible do you know the reason you got the
[19:04] King James version of the Bible let me
[19:07] give you the reason King Elizabeth back
[19:09] around the 1600 she was the Virgin Queen
[19:13] she had no heir to the
[19:20] throne so who became king King James
[19:24] from
[19:26] Scott he became king
[19:29] and the first thing that he wanted was a
[19:32] new Bible because even though the other
[19:35] Bibles was good some of still had the
[19:37] ltin Vulgate in it he wanted a new Bible
[19:41] he got all the scholars together that's
[19:43] the reason you got the King James
[19:45] version of the Bible because Queen
[19:48] Elizabeth was a Virgin Queen and had to
[19:51] bring King James to become king ain't
[19:54] that
[19:55] beautiful nothing happens by accident
[20:00] amen
[20:02] see they were begin to
[20:06] change he did the
[20:10] best but he had not kept up what he was
[20:15] supposed to do he didn't even
[20:17] necessarily know what he was supposed to
[20:20] do you will find the history maybe the
[20:24] his father the one at you know they
[20:26] always had a lot of kings that just
[20:27] didn't do what they was supposed to
[20:33] do even King David committed
[20:38] adultery you won't find out about
[20:45] Josiah but it was just
[20:49] ignorant just like I read I read read
[20:52] from the scripture they had no reading
[20:58] only abridgments what the priest the
[21:01] high priest and the you know all in
[21:04] control well we'll give them this we'll
[21:06] give them a little here why because
[21:08] probably just like today the nicadan say
[21:10] conquer the lady keep under
[21:12] bondage even back then to keep them
[21:15] under
[21:20] bondage see it was a prophecy given to J
[21:24] Josiah he would be obligated by his word
[21:28] word to open the king's
[21:33] ey for whom he
[21:35] fornew he also did
[21:38] predestinate to be conformed into the
[21:42] image of God what is his image it's in
[21:45] this
[21:46] book it's in this
[21:48] book thank God we had a prophet coming
[21:51] this hour
[21:53] Elijah turn us back to the word it was
[21:56] always back to the Bible back to the
[21:59] word back to the word the word of God is
[22:02] the absolute back to the
[22:09] Bible
[22:12] see and you as we read on in our
[22:15] scripture this probably throws a lot of
[22:18] people for a loop let's just read some
[22:21] more now in 2 Kings chapter 22
[22:32] and
[22:35] see
[22:37] now go ye and verse
[22:41] 13 go ye inquire the Lord for me and for
[22:44] the people and for Judah concerning the
[22:46] words of this book that is found for
[22:49] great is the Wrath of the Lord has
[22:50] candled against us because our fathers
[22:52] have hearken honor word of this book do
[22:55] according to that which is written
[22:56] concerning us so I the priest and abah
[23:02] and abdor and Shon and all these went
[23:05] into holdo the
[23:08] prophetess see
[23:11] that the wife of Shalom the son of tiot
[23:14] the son of The Keeper of the war Rob now
[23:17] she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college
[23:21] and they communed with
[23:23] her and she said un them thus sayeth the
[23:26] Lord God of Israel tell the man
[23:29] that sent you to me thus sayth the
[23:34] Lord behold I will bring evil Upon This
[23:38] Place upon the inhabitants thereof even
[23:42] all the words of the book which the king
[23:44] of Judah hath
[23:45] read because they have forsaken me and
[23:49] it burned incense to other gods that
[23:52] they might provoke me to anger with all
[23:55] the works of their hands therefore my
[23:57] wrath shall shall be kindled against
[23:59] this place and shall not be quenched but
[24:04] to the king of Judah was sent you to
[24:07] inquire of the Lord thus say thou shalt
[24:09] say to him thus sayth the Lord God of
[24:12] Israel a Touching The Words which thou
[24:14] Was Heard because our heart was tender
[24:17] and thou as humbled thyself before the
[24:19] Lord when thou heardest what I spake
[24:22] against this place against the habits
[24:25] thereof that they should become
[24:27] desolation and a curse and is rent thy
[24:30] clothes and went before me also have
[24:32] heard thee sayith Lord behold therefore

[29:32] and I've been rebuked by
[29:39] preachers not that I was
[29:43] wrong and I'd go home and she wouldn't
[29:46] be with me and she'd always be there and
[29:50] I could cry on her show one
[29:53] time I got rebuked so bad
[29:58] I preached in the
[30:00] morning and I I after I preached I knew
[30:04] something was wrong and I tried to give
[30:06] an altar
[30:09] service it was
[30:12] dead and I went back
[30:15] to uh my room it was a Saturday night I
[30:19] was going to have a Sunday morning I

[30:21] room I just prayed Lord I need you more
[30:24] than I ever needed
[30:26] you so I went
[30:29] back I preached with more freedom than I
[30:32] ever had and I began to have an alter
[30:36] service and I halfway through my service
[30:39] the preacher turned like this and
[30:41] wouldn't look at me and I knew when I
[30:44] was getting ready to give an altar
[30:45] service he was getting ready to stand up
[30:47] to stop me so I just prayed for the
[30:50] whole
[30:53] congregation you know that brother
[30:56] left and when I got home I told my wife
[31:01] and she had been reading a chapter in
[31:03] Ezekiel and it gave me a message from
[31:06] that she was there she's not there now
[31:09] but uh that's if you got to help me I
[31:14] say this go home and kiss your wife a
[31:16] hundred
[31:19] times

[31:27] see a believer the Old Testament or of
[31:29] the New
[31:31] Testament do I see a make believer an
[31:34] unbeliever or or a
[31:40] believer that wouldn't stand and listen
[31:43] to the word of God that's the way I
[31:46] was
[31:48] oh I'm plugging myself it's on YouTube
[31:52] at brother Jesse but brother cam Smith

[31:59] that I preached in the afternoon it's
[32:01] called I'm not ashamed of my Heritage it
[32:05] was my life story in honor of my wife
[32:09] and I told about all these things you
[32:12] need to tune in and listen to that one
[32:16] you'll understand where I came from and
[32:19] where I'm going
[32:22] amen
[32:24] see now
[32:31] it's been 2,000 years brother man send a
[32:34] message Masterpiece God has been again
[32:36] making him a
[32:39] masterpiece because he struck at him to
[32:41] get a piece off of his part of him a rib
[32:46] to make a wife for him now that perfect
[32:49] Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he
[32:51] got a peace over him it's just the New
[32:54] Testament that's all he fulfilled the
[32:56] Old Testament Jesus Christ CHR fulfilled
[32:58] the Old Testament now it's the New
[33:01] Testament another piece to be fulfilled
[33:03] the old the new and the old is husband
[33:06] and wife and it's taken the new the old
[33:09] to foreshadow the new Christ come the
[33:14] Masterpiece now his bride will fulfill
[33:18] everything that's in the New Testament
[33:21] another Masterpiece in the make in the
[33:24] Bible
[33:32] now you
[33:33] know just to say this it's always the
[33:38] Bible we cannot deny his word some
[33:40] people I believe the message of the hour
[33:42] I believe it's a perfect interpretation
[33:44] of the Bible brother brandom said that
[33:47] now but here he said it's God's power to
[33:50] transform now listen to
[33:52] this some people say well there's
[33:54] something it's not in the Bible it's not
[33:56] written in the Bible it's not this not
[33:58] this that the people in the message say
[33:59] now it's hard to say this God's power to
[34:02] transform 91165 now it's hard to say
[34:04] that it's very hard because I'm speaking
[34:07] to people who feel the same way I do and
[34:09] the way I have been for many years but
[34:12] since the opening of those Seven Seals
[34:14] of the
[34:14] Angels just Behind the B there this has
[34:17] become a new book things that's been hid
[34:20] it's been revealed as God has
[34:25] promised a new book
[34:28] it's become a new book that's not the
[34:30] one I was looking for oh this is the
[34:33] one
[34:35] see brother B said spiritual food and
[34:38] due season now back there at the
[34:40] beginning of the Seven
[34:45] Seals no people don't realize the house
[34:48] of faith in Dayton Ohio the one that
[34:50] ordained me brother Frank Ramy years ago
[34:53] my wife was raised in that
[34:56] Villa he was going to brother bram's
[34:59] meetings this is
[35:02] back way
[35:05] back when the seals was
[35:08] preached and he came
[35:10] back to the church he came back then to
[35:15] the church he came back and said to
[35:16] himself either brother benam is a true
[35:19] Prophet or a false
[35:22] prophet he got him a room in a motel and
[35:26] he testifies how the angel Lord came in
[35:29] that room and he went
[35:31] back changing the order of the
[35:36] church and when he did that who wants to
[35:40] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[35:41] Jesus Christ you come forward the first
[35:44] one that come forward was my
[35:46] mother-in-law sister Lena Todd and
[35:49] that's the beginning is what caus me to
[35:52] be who I
[35:54] am and my daughter who she is not my
[35:58] daughter but my wife who she
[36:01] is they come down in a pyramid form
[36:05] stood there and told me to return back
[36:06] there and speak on those Seven Seals
[36:08] he'd be with me and he showed me what
[36:11] they were the lost
[36:12] things he showed me what they were the
[36:14] lost things he showed me things that it
[36:18] became a new book things he thought was
[36:22] right he found out what things knew came
[36:27] o it became open to
[36:31] him I always thought it was sealed on
[36:33] the back of the book it had to be
[36:36] something wasn't wrote In the book but
[36:39] it turned out that it was made known
[36:42] that he cannot do that it isn't
[36:46] something that's written in the book
[36:48] it's something that's been hid in the
[36:51] book for whosoever shall take one word
[36:55] or add one for word so it's a mystery
[36:58] that's been in the book in the seven
[37:00] Church ages each one are produced a
[37:03] mystery water baptism and all these
[37:06] other things always hid in
[37:12] the he said brother R said he said and
[37:16] and the lat see in church age he said a
[37:18] messenger Malachi 4 Revelation is going
[37:21] to do two things according to Malachi he
[37:23] will turn the hearts of the children to
[37:25] the fathers two he will reveal the my
[37:27] Mysteries of the seven Thunders
[37:28] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[37:31] contained in the Seven Seals it will be

[51:47] down now he's making a proclamation
[51:51] here and the King sent and they gathered
[51:54] to him all the Elders of Judah Judah and
[51:57] Jerusalem now this is his eyes was open
[52:01] this is before he's going to ring
[52:03] judgment and the King went up to the
[52:06] house of the Lord and all the men of
[52:08] Judah and all the inhabitants of
[52:10] Jerusalem with him and the priest and
[52:13] the prophets and all the people both
[52:14] small and great and he read in their
[52:17] ears all the words of the book of the
[52:18] Covenant which was found in the house of
[52:22] the Lord if I like could read you the
[52:25] revelation of the Seven Seals
[52:28] and the King stood by the pillar and
[52:30] made a covenant before the Lord to walk
[52:33] after the Lord and to keep his
[52:36] Commandments and his testimonies and his
[52:38] statutes with all their heart and all
[52:41] their soul to form the words of this
[52:43] Covenant that were written in the book
[52:46] and all the people stood
[52:49] to the
[52:53] Covenant and then he begin to clean
[52:57] house sometimes we need to clean house
[52:59] at our own
[53:01] life clean house I have to clean
[53:07] house you don't know what's going on in
[53:09] my mind since you
[53:11] pass I just want to quit give
[53:15] up but I
[53:18] can't I can't do
[53:21] that she's the reason I'm standing here
[53:25] if you go there and on on on cam on
[53:30] their site look under Keith Randolph
[53:32] preaching and you'll see it about I'm
[53:36] not ashamed of my Heritage you'll see
[53:38] why you'll see why I can't give up it's
[53:41] because of her it was her testimony what
[53:44] she did that Drew me to the message
[53:48] because neither one of us was Christians
[53:49] the
[53:50] beginning amen I'm going to
[53:54] close now
[53:56] all the
[53:58] Redemption blessings of the blood was
[54:02] shed for it speaks for us certainly it
[54:08] speaks it's
[54:11] time for the power of
[54:15] God will
[54:18] work the power of God should be
[54:23] working I got I would come home from the
[54:25] Philippines
[54:28] I get
[54:29] depressed because I visit churches and I
[54:33] think man they are dead than a
[54:38] DA I would be so
[54:43] sad some places I go to now I don't
[54:46] think you're dead in da I'm not saying
[54:47] you're dead but I go some places they
[54:49] are dead or da absolutely
[54:53] dead no life
[55:00] sometimes I
[55:01] think a lot of preachers that preach the
[55:04] message are you what they need they need
[55:05] the baptism of the Holy
[55:09] Ghost that's what they
[55:13] need you could have a gift to preach
[55:16] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:17] gift of callings of God without
[55:22] repentance but that gift is not really
[55:25] truly put into operation in the right
[55:28] way until the man
[55:30] meets God in that Pillar of Fire and
[55:33] reach the on the back side of the desert
[55:35] I got my education on the back side of
[55:37] the desert for 12
[55:41] years until you meet God face to
[55:46] face and here I heard the voice of
[55:50] God and I'll never forget the voice that
[55:52] I
[55:54] heard but the voice did not help me it
[55:58] helped me it it did I'm not saying it
[56:01] didn't but it wasn't the voice that
[56:02] saved me it was obedience to the voice
[56:06] when I obeyed what he
[56:09] said if God's dealing with
[56:13] you to a closer
[56:17] walk it's an
[56:19] obedience to him as he deals with you in
[56:23] your life
[56:29] see it's the fullness of
[56:34] God in the godhead B now is in his
[56:39] entire church manifesting himself
[56:43] fulfilling
[56:45] his yeah
[56:47] am you you know if you can step to the
[56:52] pulpit have freedom to preach that
[56:56] atmosphere of
[56:58] life I have had to fight
[57:01] through
[57:02] walls to be able to preach from
[57:06] Pauls but when I get through the wall
