let's go to Revelation chapter 10 verse 9 Revelation 10 verse 9 Revelation 10:9 we're going to read three small verses today uh by God's grace I normally don't read three portions of script sure but I thought it' be fitting today how we doing on the live stream are we doing on the live stream we hooked up okay thank you appreciate that just didn't know if I need to record we had a wonderful service up there on Thursday in Junction City I'll be sharing a little bit about that but I just preached on the future home so uh I'm going to post that on YouTube if you haven't listened to that for a while it's a real blessing three and a half hour sermon from brother Brandon it's a tremendous message uh he said he lived off of it for two weeks so I can see why it's it's a tremendous uh sermon with so many types you know the Old Testament New Testament and so many beautiful promises that await us hallelujah Bible said Eye Has Not Seen Ear Has Not Heard what's entered oh I'm sorry what God has in store for us hallelujah God has such wonderful precious promises in store for us we are so thankful to be uh Christians today by the grace of God Revelation 10:9 we'll read that first I'd like to preach this morning on eat the book Hallelujah eat the book just a simple thought as we see uh in these three portions of scripture eat the book Hallelujah let's read this verse together ready 1 two 3 and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey amen uh go to Jeremiah 15:16 if you have your bible Jeremiah 15:16 as I studied this I realized there's at least three portions of scripture where God literally says eat the book Jeremiah 1516 I'd like you to read this one with me too if you could let's read this on three one two three thy words were found and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of of Mine Heart for I'm called by thy name oh Lord God of hosts and one more Ezekiel 3:3 thank you for all your turning and all your reading Ezekiel 3 verse3 Ezekiel 3 verse three let's read that ready one two three and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy boughs with this roll that I give thee then did I eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness may God add his Blessing to ring of his word you can be seated praise God brother you sang Honey in the Rock and then you sing that that eating song The Bread song I'm like you're in the right channel I'm in the right channel it's great to be in the right channel amen but it's comforting to know if I'm in the wrong Channel he can straighten me out praise God Hallelujah so I want to preach this morning on eat the book uh just simple thought I've you know I think I've had this thought waiting on the wings for months and just kind of waiting for the right time but as I listen to sermons you know these last few days I listened to a message of Grace again and uh I just thought well I think I'll go to this thought here uh it's good thought and just a just to tie numerous prophets together here uh by God's grace so again we're coming off a wonderful weekend last weekend uh keeping our first love and just want to tell you how much I appreciate everybody's support for those services and let's keep our first love by God's grace Hallelujah let's remember those prayers last week let's remember your time seeking God and let's seek more of God today by the grace of God hallelujah and then Wednesday we looked at the message of Grace just an encouraging message there about God's grace to Noah and us and Abraham and uh how God God Is With Us despite our mistakes praise God God's not going to give up on us uh there's nothing special about us what's special is God gave us Grace that we found Grace Hallelujah like just like Jeremiah said we found the role Hallelujah God helped us find the scriptures Hallelujah and that's God's Amazing Grace to us I want to say this too you know yesterday you know we we were close to my wife's grandmother and just the reminder about how death is so real and I just want to give a reminder and I was uh as I woke up this morning I just as I was brushing my teeth and whatever you know going to I just listened to a uh I listened to a funeral from a message Church down in Louisiana brother the Tim fruits church and a 55y old man man died this week unexpected expected me um and I just like what brother Tim was saying at the end of the sermon you I had it on two speed you know just I could get through it um he said just slow down and enjoy every moment you have with your loved ones so I just thought you know that was kind of two witnesses you know just let's remember just enjoy every moment he said you know many times we just rush through life and everything's a rush we got to rush to get back we got to rush to do this let's just today let's just enjoy the time that we have with one another by God's grace let's uh be thankful with the time that we have I thought it was such a good reminder um I'm so glad we got to go see you know we went we made time to go see a lane you know back in December uh we just made time to do it because I realized and we're not perfect I'm not perfect but you know uh we have to remember that let's make time to spend time with the people that really matter to us by God's grace so just keep that in mind I just thought that was a good reminder let's let's enjoy this service let's not be in a rush to get out of this service that doesn't mean I need to preach two hours right um but just let's just enjoy the moment here by God's grace I'm going to set a timer here I'm starting my hour now okay uh usually go an hour and a half on Sunday but we'll see how it goes here today so let's enjoy this time that we have together um oh yeaha was up here and she said I I forget how long she might have been like up here in an hour she said it felt like 20 minutes and don't you think so you know I think it was like a four four hour service last Sunday morning it felt like 15 minutes it didn't feel long you know when you're in the spirit those things don't feel long uh it's such a joy to be in the presence of the Lord amen so we're thankful so I want to just start off just let's look at the symbolism of eating here uh Webster defines eating you know we're very familiar with it right we eat all the time and uh to take in through the mouth to ingest to swallow in turn or to consume uh so we know what eating is you know we know it's it's a slowly breaking up of something in our mouth and then uh it becomes a part of us and uh you know eating symbolizes the most intimate act right because you have to do this in order to live it's the most intimate thing that you do is eat uh uh because you're you're taking in something something died so you could live brother Ram tells us hallelujah something must die so you can live and you're becoming one with something right I told you my testimony I I became one with too much sugar so it looked like I had polka dots all over my feet all right I was becoming one with the wrong thing physically but thank God I become one with the right thing spiritually by God's grace and so that was a good lesson to me you know I really got to be careful what I take in you know in the natural because you're going to become one with it right uh and what what a more important thing it is spiritually praise God to take in the right thing and that's what we do as Christians we take in the right thing Hallelujah we take in the word of God on at least three times a week in Services praise God but we should be taking it in every single day Hallelujah you should be eating the word of God drinking the Holy Spirit each and every day by the grace of God find a song that's a new song a fresh song and that's why the Bible said sing to him a new song Make It new and it's like a it's like a new food or it's like a new taste it's like a new experience by God's grace amen you know you you ever find a new restaurant oh I love that or when we found BB Bop it's a new feeling you know we found uh I heard they got soy so maybe we're not going to be going there so much but uh you know you find a new something new and oh it just excites you you know you're excited to put this new thing into you right and that's how the word of God should be it should be something new that we want to put into ourselves amen hallelujah and because it is new every day remember God's bread and the shoe bread it was replaced every week so it was new all the time it was always fresh God's word is always fresh Hallelujah we must keep it that way we must remember that because enemy tries to make us forget God's word is always fresh and new Hallelujah when I listen uh it was Thursday with Casa uh when I listen to the Future home I'm like my it feels like I have never listened this sermon before that's how fresh God keeps his word hallelujah I've heard it before I preached it before but just hearing it again it's like oh I feel like I'm right there amen hallelujah I feel like I'm right there saying Amen brother Bram Hallelujah we are going to a future home amen there is a New Jerusalem Hallelujah that we're going to Hallelujah brother manam said we'll walk up and down those streets he said there's Avenues in heaven uh he he said uh he said there's a River of Life and we'll walk walk up and and he said and Jesus will walk up with us and give us a drink of the Waters of life because the Bible said we'll walk with him in white Hallelujah so you'll get to stroll that future home with your lord and savior I don't know how he's going to do that with all these billions of Christians amen but he can do it hallelujah amen if anybody can do it it's Jesus Hallelujah so we uh I just want to basically lay this a simple Foundation uh you know Matthew 26:26 said as they were eating this is the last supper Jesus Took bread and blessed think of it his last moments on Earth before he dies what did he do he had communion we had it on uh in July 14th was it not if I'm not mistaken so if if if if he could have done one last thing before he left this Earth what would he do he would sit down and have a meal with you and he would eat with you think think how important is when we get to Fellowship together and just eat together right or just have communion the Lord's Supper it is one of the most sacred and special things that we can possibly do Jesus didn't say hey let let's go for a vacation let's go hike up a Mount of Olives or something like that let's let's go for a quick uh getaway now we we appreciate vacations they can be refreshing but he said let's just have an intimate meal together and then the Bible said Jesus broke the bread and blessed it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks uh and gave it to them and said drink ye all of it praise God hallelujah so we we see eating and drinking together giving thanks is something we should do he said this is the blood of my uh new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins Hallelujah but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of this Vine until the day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom and when they had sung and hymn they went out into the Mount of Olives so eating drinking giving thanks singing Hallelujah that's what Jesus wants to do with us hallelujah now he said I'm not going to do it in the natural but he told us do it in the spiritual praise God and do that until I come back Hallelujah and by doing that you'll remember what I've done amen you'll remember me Jesus if you do what I did with my disciples Hallelujah so here we see the symbolism of eating and Paul calls it the the communion of the body of Christ Hallelujah he says it in 1 Corinthians 10:16 the cup of blessings you've been blessed right since July 14th when you had communion you've been blessed because it's the cup of blessing hallelujah it's the plate it's the food of a blessing the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break isn't not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread sometimes I think we forget how powerful communion is the Catholics have a high thought of it and they 've got the wrong thought their thought is as long as that's in me I'm I'm you know think about this it's almost like a a a it's almost like a cartoon they think as soon as they drink it like they get some power it changes them you know like a cartoon character or something like that that's what they actually think and they have that in their mind but it's it's true in one way in a spiritual sense when we believe the word of God when we obey the word of God it gives us Supernatural strength praise God it gives us a spiritual Focus Hallelujah where we're now we have spiritual power amen we don't have to be spiritually weak because we're eating on the spiritual life of God hallelujah we don't have to be discouraged we don't have to be distressed we don't have to be depressed we don't have to be worried because we're taking life into us it's the communion of blessing hallelujah amen that's what it does to us and thank God for the reminders that we need Hallelujah the word communion to uh uh in the Greek means a partnership it's the cup of partn parip when we partake of that communion it's saying Lord I'm partnering with you Hallelujah like we heard last week I'm letting you drive my my vehicle right I'm letting you direct my life Hallelujah I I don't have the ability to direct my life I would surely steer the wrong way like Cas and I saw that car on the side of the road they steered the wrong way last last night that that's how we would do it if we take control of Our Lives we're going to go into the ditch we're going to make a mess of it but we give it over to God we let God have the the the the the leadership in our lives and we have partnership with him thank God he lets us sit in the front seat with him amen hallelujah can I say like that or you'll take the back seat whatever you want just sit in the car with Christ Hallelujah whatever spiritual type you want to use amen hallelujah it's the communion it's the partnership of blessing it also means a fellowship hallelujah it's remember we do these things to remember we eat to remember you know because so often in this life we forget forget how God how close God is we forget how good God's been to us so this is a cup of memory this is a eating and drinking so we remember Hallelujah because we don't want to forget all the blessings God has given to us amen and we don't want to forget the future blessings Hallelujah I just loved Austin's testimony you know how the Lord last week at the altar showed him you know he went back to that moment you know when when when the parents are arguing and in that moment of pain God helps brother Austin see I was right there with you the whole time Hallelujah that that Fellowship God was trying to Fellowship God was being a comfort God was there Hallelujah and we remember we always remember God's with us hallelujah no matter what we go through God is with us hallelujah remember there's that part we we want to know him in the power of his resurrection we want to see resurrection power but we also remember we must be partakers of his sufferings as well that's part of the cup hallelujah hallelujah wine uh as we as we saw a few months ago wine can be pretty bitter the church said Hallelujah not all wine is sweet but wine can be bitter amen it could be a bitter cup Hallelujah at times but we do all this we eat to remember that's why we come to church to remember God's promises and also to hear new ones right the Scribe brings new and old we'll hear a new scripture we never heard before Oh that's that's fresh but also the old ones both the new and old help us remember the promises of God it REM helps us remember that we are in partnership with God God want God is working with me and he's going to work through me praise God hallelujah you are having an impact on people praise God whether you know it or not whether you see it or not you are hallelujah amen I was reminded that yesterday people I saw some of my high school friends and and they they said they learned things about me and I learned things about them Hallelujah and they they can see God working with me they can see God uh working in me and and I can see God working in them hallelujah how do you see by their fruits by their their decisions uh by their choices praise God but that's why we eat to remember the Lord Jesus Christ and remember you know eating is also symbolic of marriage relations uh in the Song of Solomon 4:16 it says awake Oh north wind and Come Thou South blow upon my garden that the spices thereof May flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits so we this is that's why I said earlier eating is such an intimate thing uh you know God has no other way to describe you know relationship between a husband and wife than eating he can't describe it any other way right it's such an intimate personal thing and uh you know the adulterer uh the adulterers also said to do this in Proverbs 30:20 this is a Ser good serpent SE in scripture such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickedness so we see there's two types of uh I mean there's two types of eating you know one is sincere one is real genuine love right but the perverted eating is a denial it's a uh the they partake of of sins they partake of lust of the Flesh and lust of the eyes and pride of life and then they say I I haven't done anything evil they're so deceived right so see church members can go through all the acts it looks like they're having intimacy with God but if you look at their actual life then you can see they're actually having intimacy with Devils Hallelujah so all you know that's why we got to be careful that's why I love amen and Malachi they can take a song they can take a song like we heard uh uh from our friends that visited they love how we we were able to change songs that and really in some of those songs that that we've been able to change to make holy I think they said we cleaned out the songs but they said we like how brother amen and Malachi can clean out the songs but you know in some of those videos they might those people in their rock and roll and rap they might be partaking with the devil but the lyrics are good the lyrics are inspired they speak of God it just shows they're partaking right with evil spirits because they got the wrong Style music but we can take the right words and we can give it the right uh the right uh tone and the right beat and the right Melody and all the right chords I don't know nothing about music so I'm just pulling these things out you know but you can give it the right thing and then those songs allow us to have intimacy with Christ hallelujah amen same words just like the Bible right they could the devil will preach that verse you know a John 17 what's that Devil's verse uh not the devil's verse but the devil's perversion of the verse Jesus said I would that they be one even as as we are one remember that and the Antichrist will take that and said see we should all be one with the Roman Catholic Church see it's it's it's intimacy with Devils because they're twisting uh they're they're taking the word and and making it mean something that it doesn't mean but you and I can experience that real Oneness with Christ Hallelujah because we confessed our sin we are seeking to please God we are obeying the word of God we're doing the best we can to be zealous over good works hallelujah amen and let the Lord work through us hallelujah amen not in control of our own lives but letting Christ live through us the hope of glory and brothers you can show Christ on the soccer team can't you yeah I did on the football field like I told you that one guy cussed me up and down all game I just looked over and said Jesus loves you boy he turned away right quick right away he didn't talk to me the rest of the game amen you can talk to Jesus on the field amen someone calls you a name you sayi praying for you then just bow your head and pray no of course after the game you know don't pray during the game you pray before and pray after that's right now so see this eating is liken unto marriage relations and brother B tells us that in the church age book Revelation 2:14 thou Hast them that hold the doctrine of baam who taught BAC to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and commit fornication and brother bam says you know in the early church they weren't actually eating uh things sacrificed to Idol he talking about the Roman Church in the early church when they started the early Roman Catholic Church he said so when these people were bowing to images lighting candles and using Pagan hes confessing their sins to men all which belongs to the devil's religion they were partaking with the devil and not the Lord they were in idolatry whether they admitted or not he says so you can see eating is actually partaking in a spiritual sense right so we can see all those acts of you know they think lighting a candle is going to get them closer to God they think praying to Mary or Joseph when they're actually doing that they're actually partaking with demons they're making love to they're giving their love they're giving their intimacy to Demons aren't you glad that your love goes straight to God Almighty hallelujah what a privilege that and that's why Jesus wants worshippers who Worship in spirit and in truth hallelujah amen that we we don't we don't have vain worship Jesus said they worship me in vain teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men aren't you glad you get to come to church and you know God has received your worship because you felt him giv Amen to your worship Hallelujah I love that when God comes down and gives an amen to a sermon I studied for amen because it was God leading me to that it wasn't me there's nothing good in me but I like when God comes down and gives a a Heavenly amen so be it to that service amen Malachi saw it over there in Iowa we sure got some good amens over there God God amens his word hallelujah but see it shows we're communing with the Holy Spirit and we're not giving you know our intimacy to devils and false doctrines we're not eating things sacrificed to Idols we're eating on the word of God we're eating the book Hallelujah that's right so just with that Foundation now let's look at our scriptures here I'm already 15 minutes in Ezekiel chapter uh Ezekiel 2 if you have your Bible go to Ezekiel 2 go to verse eight Ezekiel 2:8 now as you're turning there remember Ezekiel I'm just going to read this from scoffield like Daniel and John he prophesied out of Jerusalem he wasn't in the land of Jerusalem when he was prophesying or Israel and his prophecy like theirs follows the method of symbol and vision Hallelujah unlike the threee exilic prophets whose Ministry was primary to either Judah or the 10 tribe Kingdom Ezekiel is the voice of Jehovah to the whole house of Israel Hallelujah so remember he was out of the land and yet his letters and prophecy would go to all Israel all all all the people of God whether they were scattered or whether they were they stayed there in the land Hallelujah Ezekiel 2:8 now actually I'm going to go a little little bit here let's go up to uh boy this is quite a this is quite a chapter God basic in verses 1 to S God basically says these are a stiff hearted group of people that you're going to preach to I'm glad I got uh soft soft-hearted people to preach to praise God I'm sorry you I'm very thankful you all don't stand there with stiff necks and just stare at me and give me your stiffest neck and you won't say Amen you won't enjoy you know you won't Feast on the things of God I'm glad I got a church that loves the word of God hallelujah but God told Ezekiel this is what this kind of the church you're going to have this is the kind of uh people you're going to have to preach to Hallelujah and now let's go to Just verse 7 for time sake and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forebear for they are most rebellious you got a really rebellious Church Ezekiel of course we know he wasn't a pastor but he was a prophet verse eight but thou son of man hear what I say unto thee be thou not rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat what I will give thee amen so that's how you know you're eating the word of God you're receiving what God says hallelujah you're not rebelling against it you're actually uh doing it Hallelujah and in in the simplest sense as I said on the testimonies as we were preaching over there in Kentucky and Iowa even on the issue of the lust of the eyes right and how men battle pornography and all these things if a man is fighting against that and resisting that he's eating the word of God hallelujah right that's the simplest sense amen that he's not rebellious but he's fighting against it he's getting Victory Hallelujah that's just a simple sense I can or simple example I can share with you hallelujah or another one uh bitterness you know I've been dealing with bitterness you know with those same Services too brother Brooks tell me about some situations like M no wonder the Holy Spirit had me preach these things but if someone's willing to go after churches and say I'm sorry forgive me now they can say I'm having intimacy I'm eating the role amen I'm not a rebellious church member I'm obedient child of God hallelujah and don't get me wrong I know there's times and Seasons but I'm just saying as soon as possible make haste Hallelujah today Harden not your hearts as the day in provocation Amen Let It Be Today amen we shout the him of Heaven let it be today we repent and overcome the cares of this life and the sins of this world let it be today that we eat the book of God hallelujah amen don't wait for another day amen don't be rebellious Hallelujah now we all got streaks of rebellion I I understand that I'm not and we're not you know in God's eyes in heaven we're not rebellious but our flesh Rebels on this Earth I didn't expect many amens on that when that's came but it's true anyhow verse nine and when I looked behold and hand was sent unto me and low a role of a book was therein if God could give you anything you know you you you think Ezekiel might look up and see a stack of gold coins no he better than that God gave him eternal life in the book Hallelujah if God could give you any brother God could have gave the humanity anything else he would have gave it to him but what he gave him was the word of God hallelujah glory amen he says there verse nine oh that's right a book verse 10 and he spread it before me it was written within and without and there was written there in Lamentations mourning and woe so it wasn't going to be an easy sermon to preach this wasn't you know God's going to bless you and you're going to have prosperity and everything's going to go good that wasn't the word for that day now we thank God for Prosperity we thank God for his blessings but that's not why we serve him amen that's why most churches serve God just for the blessings we don't serve God for the blessings we serve God because of his character yes Hallelujah because of who he is amen and church we'll be tested on that like the trials of life when we lose loved ones and diff difficult happens difficult things happen sicknesses uh losses Financial losses all these things we'll be tested and the longer we live the more we ought to be convinced we serve God because of his love because of his character because of who he is and not just what he gives us naturally Hallelujah what's most important is what he gives us spiritually Hallelujah sometimes it's just the joy of knowing you're saved it's just the assurance that you're a child of God hallelujah that's more valuable than other any other physical blessings those things things can be come and go they can be taken away in a moment praise God and all you've got left is the word of God that you've eaten Hallelujah right that's all you've got left when everything falls apart and brother said like my head swiming all these things all you have left is what the word of God that you've eaten that you become one with praise God that you have intimacy with that's all you've got left is intimacy with God hallelujah chapter 3 verse one moover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest I'm glad God lets us find his word just like that Mana right go out and get the Mana I promise it'll be there you go looking for God's word you're gonna find it I keep looking I keep finding amen good song brother that was right on time Hallelujah I'm just thankful we're under the same anointing amen eat this roll and go speak now look there's see there's a reason Church why you eat the word of God so you can go tell somebody about Jesus remember you overcome by the word of your testimony amen just have a testimony your heart be ready to share just have something ready to share because that's the purpose of eating you become one with it and then you can talk about it because you're one with it amen right I could I could take any of you side and say uh and you could tell me all the details of your favorite fast food right you could tell me oh man there was this type of uh spice on it or there was this type of wrapping or whatever you know this this type of vegetable this type of you tell me oh this is my favorite my favorite steak or my my my favorite carnas or whatever it is I'm thinking of CH you know you you you you could tell me all the details that's what it's like when you eat the word of God hallelujah amen I can tell you what God did I can tell you he was good taste and see that the Lord is good amen hallelujah so go said go speak verse two so I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll see God will cause you God will allow you he'll help you eat the word of God he said un me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with the roll that I give thee then did I eat and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness now just just a simple thing make sure you get full on God's word right most churches have a 15 minute sermon now or 20 minute sermon I don't get full on a 20- minute sermon I need I need to get full by God's grace amen when I eat I just don't eat like a I just don't eat one spoonful of a brisket or something like that I just don't one forkful I eat till I'm full thank God we can in this nation thank God we got the blessings Hallelujah but that's just should be a symbol fill up on the word of God so you know you're not running on empty praise God you're not going to run out but you're full amen you're ready to give something out because you're filled up Hallelujah when we when I was in college and I was 190 pounds 30 more pounds or 25 more pounds than I am right now we would eat you know I would eat a meal beforeand I'd come to the place and then before I work out I had to drink like a this big huge Shake thing they had creatin in it and you know kinds of proteins and I had to chug that down then in the middle of the workout after you lift then you got to go run and then and then after that you got to drink one in the middle so beginning middle and then after we went Ran So we lift hard lift hard take a break and then we go run around the track all these 20 times or whatever and then they' have one for you after that so you're eating before during and after you're all filled up praise God you got all the fuel you need praise God we need to be filled up on the word of God that's why Daniel Prayed morning evening and noon Hallelujah you know just the Simplicity of whispering prayers to God throughout the day Hallelujah if you want to be strong you got to get filled up praise God Amen that's just a natural type verse four and he said to me son of man go get thee unto the house of Israel and speak my words unto them so they're going to be rebellious but I'm going to give you the best thing you can have the word of God and if you eat it and if you get full on it you can handle any opposition oh there it is you can can handle any Rebellion you can handle any demon power you can handle any Temptation why CU you're filled with the word of God you're full of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah can handle anything that comes your way because you're filled with God's spirit Hallelujah am amen you know when I I told you this over the years I've had different phone calls or face Toof face meetings and they were very stressful for me but each time before I made sure I prayed and I got into the presence of God and I got filled up on God's spirit yes I was still nervous but in every case I saw how God helped me and it was a great lesson to me I got to get filled up with when I know I got a meeting when I'm know I'm going out to Goliath I'm gonna get it filled up I'm gonna get those five Stones Hallelujah I'm not going to get one stone that's probably I need but I'm going to get filled up hallelujah amen when you approach something get filled up on prayer just you know a sincere prayer it don't have to be an hour don't have to be half an hour but get your heart filled with the comfort that God is with you Hallelujah remember it's got to be a fiery prayer uh the the altar the the incense had to be on fire before it could go in the presence of God in other words be sincere make sure it's your most sincere prayer humble yourself in the sight of God and he will exalt you in new season Hallelujah all right now Jeremiah go to Jeremiah 15:16 again as you're turning there Zephaniah and habach uh were cont Temporaries of Jeremiah's earlier Ministries okay and then those passed away and then Daniel was alive towards the end of Jeremiah's Ministry isn't that that's what I love about that Sight and Sound they bring Ezekiel Daniel and Jeremiah all into the same time period because they were all in the same time period I see some some people be upset and say uh they'll quote brother brandom and they'll say uh brother said that God never has two uh prophets at the same time well it depends the context you're talking about I've heard quotes from Brother R talking about that and he says look Moses was leader than Joshua so in the context brother's talking about that's true but it was a different time during the days of of Jeremiah Ezekiel and Daniel right God's people are scattered all over so God had to have multiple prophets amen see people argue and say this and this and that that nonsense just be humble praise God just look at the word of God Amen see it's that critical spirit remember avoid vain babblings amen that stay with me amen Allelujah remember Jeremiah remained in the land ministering to the poor Remnant until they went to Egypt with he followed them this is from scoffield and where he died think of that he died in Egypt early in the 70 years captivity so Jeremiah prophesied before and during the Exile of Judah and connects the pre-ex prophets and with Ezekiel and Daniel prophets of the Exile so see God had multiple prophets in different areas praise God but if God's people are in one place and they're not scattered yes God has one Prophet to lead them by yes one everybody understand that by God's grace but if they're all scattered about God has to have different prophets to minister to the people in the land outside the land Hallelujah all right Jeremiah 15:16 thy words were found and I did eat them just like Glory just like Ezekiel found the words amen just like Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord remember he attained it ah Hallelujah he attained it and also you could go to the pearl of great price he found he already had pearls but then he found the Pearl he already had good religious things these are good ideas but there's one truth that's greater than all of them that's Jesus Christ Hallelujah he found it but see God ordered a steps God knew he'd find it amen because of predestination I did eat them so I found them I ate them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I called by thy name oh Lord God of hosts now we get another idea after eating you remember you testify and you get some Joy I hope somebody leaves this service with some Joy you came to service with joy buddy I know he that's the happiest I've seen him Hallelujah well maybe not the happiest but it's good to see him happy there's times I'm not happy there's times we're not happy but God has made us glad amen restore the joy of my salvation Hallelujah you won't be joyful all the time but it sure it's good to feel the joy it comes after eating the word of God it comes after intimacy with the Holy Spirit praise God Amen Hallelujah that's how it comes he found joy that's why I was so glad you know uh La last week after somebody at the altar I shook some of your hands and I was I saw all this Joy on your face I thought praise the Lord they must have ate God's book amen right that's what the Bible says you eat his word makes you joyful gives you strength Hallelujah Glory now why was he happy why why could his heart Rejoice because I'm called by his name aren't you glad you're not called by Methodist Lutheran Pentecostal Catholic aren't you glad you're called by Jesus Christ our church is bride of Jesus Christ we're called to be the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's why I'm glad we got that name amen see that that's what's the name we're called by we're recognized as Christians Holy Ghost filled Christians Hallelujah now I want to read what John Gil said thy words were found I ate them the messages he was called to deliver unto the others appeared to him to be of God as they were as welcome to him as food is to a Hungry Man Allelujah he's cheerfully receive them treasure them up in his memory digested them in his mind and carefully retain them so are the doctrines of the Gospel which are the words of God and not of men when by searching in close application they're found the scriptures and are under the Ministry of the word they are food to souls sweet Savory wholesome nourishing and strengthening is that what you thought about last Sunday Services they were Savory words yeah they were good I took well I took quite a few notes on that sermon let me just show you here this is kind of like an ingredients list or something like that from cooking I took all these notes from Brother Paul I got all these Nice Notes here all these notes then all the songs I want to sing up see all this eating of the word makes you want to rejoice and sing all these songs amen hallelujah see we we find if the natural is true about eating what about the spiritual amen must be so much greater Hallelujah he says the word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart that's why the Bible calls it honey Allelujah anybody had any honey lately praise God honey it makes you happy it's it it gives you strength I remember when brother Kevin was here and I showed there's like 20 benefits to honey there's probably a 100 benefits to honey you know my wife was telling me even you can put honey on your skin you know and help with your skin complexion go at your own risk I should probably had some honey to my face am but you know there there's so much truth in this the word should bring us joy the word should make us rejoice Hallelujah because you're one with it it's not something out Glory it's not something outside of you it's inside of you amen it's not just out there but it's actually in here hallelujah because we're called by God's name amen go to Revelation 10 now we're familiar with this brother brandom says Revelation 10 1-7 is history pardon me I dropped my pen there brother says Revelation 101:7 is already history that means the seven Thunders have already sounded and the church say I just like to say that that's my belief that's my conviction I like I just like all those I think I had 14 proofs that the Thunders have already sounded if I went back and listen that a few months ago but brother says Revelation 10 1-7 but now it's history it's past quote that's a quote Hallelujah but then in Revelation 10:7 we know the mystery is given to an angel he can't be a Heavenly Angel right he's got to be an Earthly Angel because he has to sound out his message to the Earth and God didn't call angels to finish the of God because Amos 3:7 says God always he'll do nothing but he Reveals His secret to his servant the prophet amen so if this Angel is going to finish a mystery and it's a Seeker we didn't know it's got to come through a prophet Hallelujah right and we know David's called a prophet Paul I'm sorry David's called an Angel David is a prophet and Paul's called an angel Paul's called a prophet as well okay now and look and look verse eight again he says and go and take the little book so see there's something that that is you and I that's instruction you and I have to draw nigh to God go you go and take it praise God John had to go and get it so we've got to go and get the Bible off our Shelf and open it you got to go you got to go down to the altar like you did last week I love that Amen in 18 years I never had a church uh I never had our church ever come down to the altar like that I said well that that shows you just got to wait wait and wait and be patient and God will God will give you desires of your heart am amen it just does my heart a lot to see the church down at the altar you know we don't do it every service but it's just a blessing to see that but God gives us the desire of our hearts he said you go and take it and then uh ask right and that's why the brother man said pray for Revelation more than anything else ask for Revelation you know like one of the sisters there on Thursday night she said uh she said I need wisdom Casa saw and all the sisters GA around and prayed for her for wisdom afterwards I told her I said you're going to get a a whole lot of wisdom because God said in James 1 if you ask ask and believe you'll get it liberally God's going to just like pour out the blessings on you of wisdom she had to know this how do you handle this uh family situation about depression and not working how do you handle this God will give her wisdom Hallelujah and it don't it don't matter if God gives it to her or somebody gives it to her as long as God as long as God brings the wisdom it could come through a preacher it come through a brother come through a sister but God is going to give that woman wisdom because God's word cannot lie okay so go take it and then he says in verse nine give me so he said' give it to me he said ' take it and eat it so he said go get it then he says give it to me then he said take it so see as humans we just got to make effort Hallelujah we got to get into the presence of God we got to draw n to God and we got to partake of the things of God that's why I told some of those young believers I I said uh find something you really want to study you know whether it's the Book of James or find a book of Revelation find something and go take that and just make that your own you know I told Mali you know write in your Bible I told these brothers I said if you need any markers or anything you let me know you know see that's how I brought my Bible for the first time after eight months I finally got it all highlighted with all my previous highlights and this just shows to me like this just shows all my notes it just shows I want intimacy with the Bible with God's Bible that's my way of saying I don't want to forget this I want this not just to be on those pages I want God to write it on my heart Hallelujah and I'll remember it more if I write it on the page amen but I spend that time eating Hallelujah I know some of us like to eat as fast as we can but with God you don't want to do that I remember there's a Time John Graham and I we would race and see how fast we get with our meals so then we can go be more productive you know we're all about efficiency that was way back in the day and he's like well if I do this and that and I I can be done in like two minutes man that's a good job maybe I can get done in one minute can I eat that burrito in one minute how you're going to suffer for that later on with indigestion or something like that but with God is exactly the opposite God wants you to take your time now if all you got there's cares of the world and there's things we with children or a business or whatever emergency then yeah just enjoy whatever you got but God wants us to do the opposite let's sit down and enjoy the meal praise God let's sit down and enjoy the presence of God hallelujah I started that in January I just got through with it last week I got all my notes from the previous and I added a bunch of notes and now I'm going to add like an index where all all all the major message doctrines and I'm going to have the starting spot for it like hell's not Eternal that's going to start at Luke 16 I'm going have all the main verses for that so I can I can if any anytime I can use this at the pulpit and I can teach somebody the truth and really I really I'm depending on the Holy Spirit but I got to give the Holy Spirit something to work with that's say you can't just expect the Holy Spirit to give you something if you're not constantly feeding on the Holy Spirit Hallelujah all right good I'm sure you know that by go just thought I'd remind you there so Revelation 10 he's got to eat the book and then what does he do just like Ezekiel just like Jeremiah after he eats he can prophesy after you eat you can prophesy Hallelujah right you got to eat first and then prophesy I love it now it goes on to say though that it was sweet in his mouth Hallelujah we see that uh in verse nine but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey now there's 1 2 3 four five there's there's five verses that say the word of God is sweet as honey we already read one of them Ezekiel 3:3 but let's read some other ones here by God's grace uh Psalm 19:10 our brother saying hunting the Rocks I knew this is we need a reminder if you don't think the word of God is sweet uh you need a reminder you need to remember Hallelujah you sit down and remember the body of the Lord the broken body of the Lord and the Holy Spirit Hallelujah Psalm 1910 I got to get there okay faster than me good job I like to read it Psalm 1910 more to be desired are they speaking of The Commandments and righteous judgments of the Lord then gold yay much than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb think about that all the Commandments of God are sweeter than honey and let me bring it back to the brothers Brothers when the Bible said don't look at a woman in lust if you obey that that'll make you that that tastes as sweet as honey or sisters uh don't wear makeup don't cut your hair that should be as sweet as Honey Hallelujah and church it is when you're walking in obedience other words you're never going to be as happy as you can unless you're obeying the word of God to the best of your ability amen you'll never be happier or rejoicing of my heart like Jeremiah said you'll never have more rejoicing than when you're walking in full obedience to the word of God hallelujah how many believe that because it's like honey it could not be any sweeter right nothing could be sweeter than than knowing uh I'm partaking of my Creator's words I'm living off of him and he's my delight he's my life he's I'm one with him he's inside of me and I know I came from him Hallelujah Glory Psalm 10434 I'm going to try to erace you 10434 see if I can get I'm there my meditation of him shall be sweet good good job I'll be glad in the Lord so see okay she's not back there okay L's back there sorry so see even this now my wife and I talked about this our children when we have a free moment we're just quick to pick up our phone but church we got to ask God to help us to not do that so much and just have some sweet meditation moments now it's okay if you pick up your phone and you're actually going to read the Bible but we know if we're reading the Bible or not on the phone see and this is something that's been a good reminder to me just take some time like my wife and I we like to go on our weekly date and I just like it we just get to walk we're not looking at our phones and uh uh we just get to look at the sky look at the clouds and talk about God and that's that's a fulfillment of that that's one way to fulfill that just meditate on the things of God and your life just gets sweeter your outlook your perspective everything gets sweeter if you just meditate on God hallelujah think about that scripture think about that sermon think about that Doctrine think about that Judgment of God think about the word of God if you meditate on that it just makes your life so much sweeter Hallelujah that's right Church uh Psalm 11913 119 103 how sweet are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth word is supposed to be sweeter than honey right let that sink in a little bit God's word when you're hearing it right now and if it's blessing you it should be sweeter than honey to your mouth when I when I eat honey I used to I bought separate honey just for myself for the pancakes I was always where's the honey where's the honey I'm going to buy my own honey if I can't find it who knows where it is I don't want to go looking for it I just want my own honey but that's I just poured on there real liberally not not not baptize it in honey but just although I believe in baptism I sprinking it on there right and it's just such a sweet taste it's it's such a fulfillment it's such satisfaction that's how it is when you Feast on the word of God hallelujah right it takes something that's Bland it takes a day or a life or a a season that's Bland and just going through life and it makes it sweet it's a joy to serve God hallelujah I'm glad I'm a Christian amen this is a wonderful season of my life amen this is a sweet time of my life because I'm eating on the word of God hallelujah I'm obeying the commands of God like already Zion tell me I can't wait to grow up Daddy I'm like buddy just stay a little guy man enjoy the sweetness of that season then I'm like I don't want to grow old I see what happens when you get old but in each case we need to see the blessings of the Lord in whatever season we're in remember there's no Greater Joy than to see your children walk in the truth hallelujah so even in the heart lateness of life there's no greater blessing than to see children that want to sing kids that want to glorify God PE children that want to read the Bible go to church sing the songs of God there's no sweeter blessing than that it's sweeter than honey in the honeycomb amen hallelujah that's why my mom even text me this morning I see my mom yesterday she helped out with our little supper that we did our reunion she text me this morning she said I know you're going to have a wonderful time in the presence of God I'm so thankful for children that want to love and serve God see nothing could be sweeter for her she went through divorce she went through hard times Financial lows all these things but it's sweeter now because her children are in the house of God serving God Amen and some of the other nieces and nephews are not right they're suffering because of that spiritually suffering maybe not physically but spiritually suffering because their decisions that's all we want children we want you to grow up and be a real child of God Amen we want you to serve God there'll be no greater Sweetness in our lives than that Hallelujah you can love and serve God hallelujah that's what the Bible says it's got to be right Hallelujah uh Psalm no Proverbs 16:24 pleasant words are as in honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones you ever had that when you're really down somebody come and give you a word and it just makes you feel healthy again gives you strength again hallelujah oh it's so wonderful to have that those moments where the words are just what you need to hear you're so down you're so discouraged but this person would say oh thank you for doing this this was such a blessing or this really blessed my heart amen like our coach my coach yesterday told me last night there's a testimony so he printed off as as a coach he printed off a onepage devotional for his players and brother Austin every Thursday night before the game we had games on Friday football games every Thursday night he passed out just one page it's just it's like a it's a verse and then comments on the verse and one day he's this this is how he says he does it he lays out like nine or t of these and he just prays and he ask God to kind of guide his hand you know and the one day he picked it up and this is a pretty serious story but anyway he says what does this have to do with football or anything I don't know he says Lord you got it my hand I prayed I'm going to give it out a week later so the week after he passed it out one of the moms comes up and said who passed out this paper who passed this out he's like well we kind of like to keep that inh house right we don't want to throw ourselves under the bus you know and she looked like she was really fired up he said we just like keep that in house he says if you don't mind me asking tell me why and it she wasn't upset but she was just like shocked and and so uh elated she said my son brought this home last week I took it to work on Monday so she he he brought it home on Thursday night Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday she took it to work and she shared it with one of her co-workers and her coworker came to her crying a few days later and said I was just about ready to go commit suicide because I was going to commit suicide on the 17th year anniversary of the day I had an abortion my coaches crying telling me this like church we don't know how important our actions are just giving out a piece of paper with a Bible scripture on it and she said I just want to she said I just want to tell you tell the coach and she's like no I need to I need to know I need to tell this to the coach who did it he's like you you told him and she said thank you you save someone from committing suicide and uh and then you know she went on to say how that mother now has a a new outlook on life and all these things all because of one piece of paper and it was I don't know what scripture was about maybe about uh God's mercy or God's forgiveness it had nothing to do with football but just in a and and this man has done this brother Austin he's been a coach for over 30 some years every Thursday night for 30 years print off all these papers you think oh he's wasting ink and these guys don't want to hear it Church you never know where your influence is going to go you never know but see church it's the Purity Glory it's the purity of just eating the word well I know the Bible says I'm supposed to share the gospel and I'm just going to share in my humble little way he's not a preacher but he can share the word in some type of way and it can cause somebody save them from Death save them from Hell perhaps if maybe they got saved I don't know so I I think I texted him this morning I said thank you I love all those God moments you know oh and he said when he was in a when he met his wife he was just like in a teacher he's a teacher like me he's a math teacher he said when he met his wife he said he said the Holy Ghost came over him now this is a man who don't know the message the Holy Ghost came on and he said this is a real warm feeling he said I like this whatever this is I like this he said was the Holy Spirit he said I I got you know goosebumps God is here and he said within a few minutes this woman walked in the door and sat down like kind of in front of him and he went up and eventually they got married you know it was just a neat testimony like God comes and confirms ter this is the one he' been looking for a wife you know didn't want to be alone all these things like that I love that God will show up when you need it praise God Amen I love God hallelujah now so we see how many believe God's word is sweet see if people leave services and they're not they're not thankful with the word of God well then they're either going through a rough service or they're rebellious I'm sorry a rough SE rough season right they're either going a rough season the word ought to be sweeter than anything else it ought to be such a blessing to be in the house of God and you know it is if you've been if you missed a service lately you know it is the blessing to be here and hear the children sing and and hear the adults sing amen and and hear the prayers go up it such a blessing to be in the presence of God nothing could be sweeter Hallelujah because it's intimacy it's Oneness with God God told John you eat the book Hallelujah that was us right because it must be prophesied to every people's Nation tongues Kindred tribes Hallelujah the Gentiles Hallelujah so we see the sweetness of God I'm trying to bring this down I'm almost at I'm at 51 minutes here all right so it's in our mouth sweet as honey but in our belly it's bitter let's see what brother Ram said about this I want to read this to you he said and this Sevenfold book of seven Redemption plans talking about the Seven Seals has been brought to us and that's what this book holds this is from 1961 actually uh Revelation chapter 5 part two now we're going to get over to the 10th chapter where this Mighty Angel proclaimed something that he had a little book that John had to eat and when he did he got it into his belly and it was bitter but in his lips it was sweet and here's how brother Ram explains it when you have to digest it then it gets bitter because everybody's against you everybody telling you're a Holy Roller you're this you're that or the other see you're off of your head no my head just got on placed the right way actually my head my head finally got screwed in the right way my head was off before now it's on my man said so it's hard to digest it he says but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweet in your lips amen hallelujah I love that amen so the bitterness is when people say hard things about you right and you're living the Christian life and it's a part of you and everybody's against you that's the bitterness but the honey is all the testifying the worship the singing the praising of God the glory of God hallelujah when it's in your lips when you get a chance to share your testimony hallelujah hallelujah now on the bitter aspect I said I dealt with the sweetness right on the bitter element brother Ram tells us this he's quoting Revelation and Jesus said they they shall walk with me I mentioned this earlier because it was on my mind this is what God says he will bestow upon them for their upright walk now remember upright walk is just walking right walking in obedience to the word of God this is part of their inheritance that he has reserved for them if they were willing to walk with him through the toyss and snares of life and be honored to him he was going to reward them he is not forgetful of our labor of love God will always recompense us for our efforts to please himen so God's reward for you if you can walk through this life through the toils and the snares if you can walk through this life with the bitterness of the word of God the bitter impact it has on people's reaction to you his reward is if you can walk through this filthy world world if you can walk with the bitterness in your stomach week after week month after month year after year decade after decade if you can do that I you inherit the fact that I will walk with you in the Millennium and the future home Hallelujah that's your reward Hallelujah if you can walk with the the honey in your mouth praising God but also the bitterness sometimes that comes along with this the rejection he said I'll walk with you in white for you are worthy I read this quote case she was there read this on Thursday night we closed down service two people came up for prayer and I said okay we'll close the service but a brother comes up remember brother Howard he comes up and he tells his testimony he's crying he said these last few weeks he said I'm one of 10 children and all nine children have rejected me and my parents he said I've shared the message with all uh TW all other 11 family members and everyone has turned me down he said I talked to my brother on the phone today he said it seemed like he was interested he said but by the end he didn't want to talk about it anymore he said I came to church he said I felt so empty today I felt like I had no hope I I felt like uh what's the purpose of this what's what's the struggle like why is this all four he said I came to church I felt empty he said and then you brought it all the way down to this and showed this is the reward the future home walking with Jesus is the reward if you can just walk through this life the toil and snares of this life there is a reward for it God sees you Hallelujah and I'll say like this he's already walking with you amen hallelujah he's already walking with you but you actually get the the the spiritual reality of it in the natural with the glorified body you actually get the glorified walk with him in that Heavenly City in that future home you actually get that extra reward and he said that's just what I needed and he cried tears of joy Hallelujah because Jesus Promised as if you can walk through this life you'll walk with me in white hallelujah amen church that's what I call an ontime God I didn't know what to preach I I didn't even know how to end that I think I I was like Lord help me how do I end this sermon you know I just I feel led to go to those scriptures and the last scriptures were the ones that quote was the one he needed the most amen I said now the brother use that KN to cause you to pray more I said remember I had six siblings right first it was uh Simon came in then me and then Betsy then cam Paul's received it and he you know he's he loves the Lord and we're talking about it so look we just got one Hallelujah five out of six that's pretty good I like 100% amen we just got to keep praying Amen to be buried in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he's got 10 so we got to have hope and we got to realize just keep eating the word of God just keep the sweetness on your lips amen keep the sweetness of the testimony on your lips and pretty soon people will see you really love Jesus amen it's not about some man it's not about some tapes not about some headquarters it's about Jesus Christ Hallelujah getting back to the word of God hallelujah yes they' walked through the world and had not partaken of it what's partaken mean that means communion he says they had not let the World Systems overcome them when the illustrious names of that age had yielded to the blandishment of the state and the The Chosen political mindedness rather than the spiritual mindness and were on their way back into the world these few stood for the word of God and thereby honored the Lord now he would honor them in return Hallelujah so it's just like that story brother R said he was in Israel and he watched a Shepherd lead his flock right through the market where there's food and dat and Kiwis and all this he said they walked right through and not one of them jumped up and started eating because they were trained to the voice of their Shepherd Church don't you know that's how we are today the great Shepherd Jesus Christ leads us right through Leo DEA there's this and that all these Temptations but we're sheep of God Amen we're obedient to the word of God we forfeit our rights amen we do not partake of these things but we've decided to follow Jesus I have decided no turning back back amen amen hallelujah and if we can partake of him while we walk in this life and not partake of the things of the world then Jesus rewards us I'll also walk you up to the tree of life amen to the rivers of life and I'll give you a drink at the rivers of the Throne of God hallelujah amen amen what a blessing they shall walk with me in white he says for they are worthy you have partaken Glory you partaken of the things of God and not partaken of the things of the world for they were death unto you they identified themselves with him on Earth and now he would identify himself with them in the New Jerusalem Hallelujah brother says it makes me rejoice and makes me want to weep to think that of his condescension for you and I will note that Jesus is not dressed in another color different from the Saints as Earthly leaders would do right all the big leaders of the word they all got their their their their beautiful clothes and all these things but said that's not a real leader a real leader wants to be like his people hallelujah he says no they are like him he is like them they are like him even as John said they see him as he is they have a body likened under his glorious body with a robe that is white Hallelujah I'm trying to close here I'm really trying there there's my hour right there there's my last seconds of my hour Hallelujah let me just read I'm just going to go over this briefly and maybe I could do a part two I don't know we'll see but John chapter 6 is a beautiful chapter in this chapter in verse 35 he said I am the bread of life I am Jehovah I am I am who I am he said I am the bread of life in other words I'm your bread I'm your food in verse 40 he says everyone that believes has eternal life and I will raise him up oh church if we make Jesus our bread if we make Jesus our bread he will raise us up hallelujah what a promise it's so simple right just keep feeding on the word of God and God will resurrect your body Hallelujah verse 48 he says again I am that bread of life in verse 57 51 he says I am the living bread oh it's not a stale bread it's not a rotten bread it's not a dead bread it's not Stony bread it's living bread Hallelujah God's word is life to us verse 54 can you put that up there John 654 thank you hun who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up in the last day everybody say haath ready you already got it brother said you already got it let's thank God cuz we already got it it's not something I'm going to have I've already got it amen I believe I've eaten the flesh I've drinken the blood amen I partake of the word I worship in the Holy Spirit I let I take the holy spirit in I've already got eternal life Hallelujah because I'm eating on him now Hallelujah verse 57 eat and live eat means to live as a living father sent me and I believe I'm sorry and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me so eating is believing in other words Church what we preach what what you read in your Bible you've got to believe it and act upon it that's when you know you're eating so John would know he's eating once he starts prophesying to somebody else Glory that's why it's so important when you testify to somebody else it just gives you a reminder yes I'm eating on the things of God hallelujah I'm living on the word of God because I'm eating and I'm testifying I'm talking about this sweetness that I taste in my mouth all the time amen talking about this delicious honey that I'm eating all the time it's the word of God hallelujah you've been a good audience here thank you and this is the verse I one of the verses I used yesterday John 663 he said Jesus sayith unto them he said uh the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life see the word is the Holy Spirit and the holy spirit is life so we got to keep eating the word keep believing the word of God Hallelujah and of course you know the end of the chapter um the disciples this is a hard saying Jesus eat your flesh drink your blood who can hear it then he says then then the Bible said 70 of them left and Jesus asks his other 12 do you want to go too and Peter says where are we going to go you've got the words of eternal life where am I going to go I can't go anywhere else I got to go to where the word of of God is being preached where it's lived I got to go where it's sweet as honey praise God I want to see a preacher preach it like it's life and death amen hallelujah that's what I preciate about brother Paul and Aaron just their sincerity you can tell they live it they love it amen they want it they want they want to uh obey every word of God hallelujah remember I'm going to do a few more first John 511 this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son okay so when you have this Spirit of the sun you have life you've already got eternal life Hallelujah let's say it together let's say I've already got eternal life ready I've already got eternal life he's G he's already given it to you just like the book he said give the book but you got to take it amen right he says give it to you here come get it okay now take it now eat it so you got to take it and you got to eat it praise God Amen there's two steps in there right take it eat it Hallelujah you you you did the right part coming to church you're taking it now let's eat it let's believe it praise God see that you got to take it and you got to eat it by God's grace uh verse 13 513 these things have a written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that ye may know that you have eternal life see John wrote these things so you know it right the word of God is written so you know it and that you may believe on the name of the son of God so see knowing believing having eternal life it's all tied together Hallelujah the more you believe the more God is real to you the more you know you've got eternal life Glory I know everybody's getting tired here I'm trying to finish it I really don't want to do a part two on this I kind like to get some other things here by God's grace but it's a beautiful thought Hallelujah 1 Peter 5'8 says be sober be vilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour okay so Satan's trying to consume us Satan's trying to devour our lives and make our lives go astray right ruin our testimony verse 9 whom resists steadfast in the faith that means stand your ground don't let him get more ground in your life say this is as far as you're going devil you're not going any further than this and then you start rebuking him remember resist him he'll flee flee means to run Satan will run from you if you got the word of God in your mouth Hallelujah think of that he just doesn't go away like okay fine whatever you know he doesn't walk away like we walk away I'll see you later actually runs away because he he can't handle the presence the Holiness of Jesus Christ amen he's such a a low Wicked Spirit a unclean Spirit he he wants to be far away from the Holy Spirit oh let's keep the holy spirit in our mouth let's keep the holy spirit in our stomachs Hallelujah and we'll walk with Jesus in white Hallelujah but look he's trying to devour you but we must resist him knowing that the same afflictions are accomplish in your brethren that in the world so see sometimes we're going to go through the fires of Affliction like our brother preached last week sometimes we'll go through very hard afflictions but the Bible says always in those moments resist Satan he'll flee from you draw nigh to God God will draw nigh to you and then finally 1 Corinthians this is my last verse 1 Corinthians 15:54 so in this corruptible shall put on incorruption So speaking of the body change and this more shall put on mortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is your sting oh grave where is thy Victory Hallelujah the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which give us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ notice that the grave doesn't have the victory death doesn't have the victory amen you've got the victory amen CU you've got Jesus Christ you've got eternal life hallelujah amen there is no victory in death there is no victory in the grave Hallelujah there's only Victory in Jesus my Savior forever Hallelujah and I love this thought the Bible said eat the book right if we eat the word and we me if we constantly Feast on the word of God then the Bible says the Holy Ghost will swallow us up if we swallow down the word of God's service week after week we are promised God will come and swallow us up amen oh it's like Paul said I'm trying to attain to what's already attained me oh Hallelujah I'm eating on this eternal life that's going to eat me up Hallelujah in other words I want to consume as much of God as I possibly can because I know one day God will consume my life Hallelujah he'll consume and eat up all the sin nature and I'll be given a brand new body a body like under his glorious body if I can only feed on the word of God if I can only eat the book there's victory in the book today amen let's stand and sing Oh Victory in Jesus my Savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming love he L me [Music] iory S that first verse
