[42:49] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[42:52] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[42:55] let's read 14 together on three one two
[42:59] three that we henceforth be no more
[43:02] children tossed to and fro and carried
[43:05] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[43:09] sleight of men and cunning craftiness
[43:11] whereby they lie in wait to deceive now
[43:15] I read 15 and 60 but speaking the truth
[43:18] in love may grow up into him in all
[43:20] things which is the head even Christ
[43:24] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[43:26] together and compacted by that which
[43:28] every joint supplieth according to the
[43:32] effectual working in the measure of
[43:34] every part maketh increase of the body
[43:38] unto the edifying itself of itself in
[43:41] love
[43:42] amen let's just have our word of Prayer
[43:45] let's just bow our heads one more time
[43:46] Heavenly Father we reading these words

[43:52] behind them the spear behind them has no
[43:55] age is eternal we're thankful for
[43:59] eternal life Lord let eternal life speak
[44:01] to us help me to humble myself and yield
[44:03] to you and Lord may each one of us he
[44:05] owed to You Lord God that the life of
[44:07] this were be broken unto us O God help
[44:09] us and strengthen us today too
[44:11] the hour we're living in Oh God and may
[44:13] it strengthen this part of the body Lord
[44:15] as it edifies itself in love in Jesus
[44:18] Christ's name from the church said Amen
[44:21] god bless you being seen to praise the
[44:22] Lord so by God's grace I think I've said
[44:39] all the thank-yous and done all the
[44:41] announcements I think I'm ready to
[44:42] preach now so praise the Lord I don't
[44:44] forget anything but doesn't it feel good
[44:46] to be back in here by God's grace and
[44:47] not to worry about people shooting hoops
[44:50] over there and walking around with half
[44:52] naked you know and all that kind of
[44:53] stuff just thankful for we can all be
[44:56] shut in here in the cleft of the rock
[44:58] all's you gotta worry about is cars
[45:00] driving by or you know a landscape
[45:02] blower you know blowing mulch out of the
[45:04] way or whatever that's all we gotta
[45:06] worry about here by God's grace so we're
[45:08] thankful you know that very thankful for
[45:10] God's love and His mercy so that's I got
[45:12] part 15 here and then like I said
[45:14] tonight we could look at more of number
[45:16] six and number seven tonight or there's
[45:18] there's Ecclesiastes sermons there's
[45:20] proverbs sermons I got revelation six
[45:23] sermons kind of ready to go I just kind
[45:25] of got to see which one liked to preach
[45:27] and if not we'll just pray tonight
[45:28] because one thing we need more of is
[45:30] prayer amen and and if you're concerned
[45:33] you'll fall asleep or if I feel like I'm
[45:35] gonna fall asleep I'll say Haven
[45:36] somebody just come slap me on the back a
[45:37] little bit there keep me awake but I
[45:42] know we all get tired after eatin but
[45:43] you know we do want to just draw closer
[45:45] to the Lord amen so pardon me so we read
[45:48] our text here and I just want to briefly
[45:50] review part 14 real quick as I preach it
[45:53] to Wednesday's ago remember the Scofield
[45:56] Bible there's three themes we're on the
[45:58] third theme we preached every verse up
[46:01] to this point up to chapter four and the
[46:04] reason behind this was because I knew
[46:06] you know and I know the Holy Spirit's
[46:08] revealed it to you too that if we're
[46:11] supposed to have the faith of the
[46:12] Apostolic fathers we better know what
[46:14] the Apostolic fathers said we better
[46:16] know what they wrote so we started in
[46:18] Galatians in 20 15 and 16 and then
[46:21] Ephesians I took a little time off and
[46:24] now I just
[46:25] feeling led to get back into it remember
[46:27] back in January I said I want to preach
[46:28] on these winds that are rising up around
[46:31] Jeffersonville so this is the morning
[46:33] I'm going to do that so I'm gonna do it
[46:36] in love you know the Bible said when
[46:37] you're really a true Christian you speak
[46:38] the truth in love and you're not
[46:40] attacking individuals you know you're
[46:42] just watching out for spirits because
[46:44] like when you're in the midst of the
[46:45] trial you know many times you're not
[46:47] sure well is this a spirit on somebody
[46:48] or not you know or is a spirit on me you
[46:50] know you're not quite sure so in the
[46:53] midst of it you want to be kind and
[46:55] gracious you want to search your heart
[46:57] and then so that's what we'll do you
[46:59] know by the grace of the Lord so we
[47:02] looked at we saw our exalted position in
[47:04] Christ were seated in heavenly places in
[47:05] Christ we were chosen in him before the
[47:08] foundation of the world all those
[47:10] beautiful scriptures and there's one
[47:12] body of Christ both Jew and Gentile and
[47:14] now we're in the walk and warfare of the
[47:16] believer now two Wednesdays ago we
[47:18] basically taught three things the seven
[47:21] fold benefits of the fivefold ministry
[47:23] and then the attacks on the fivefold
[47:25] ministry and the reality of the home
[47:27] church so I just want to revisit those
[47:29] briefly the word perfect means equipped
[47:33] so the the fivefold ministry being
[47:35] brings the perfection of the Saints or
[47:37] it equips you it if you really catch
[47:40] what's being preached it will give you
[47:42] the tools you need to overcome it
[47:44] perfects you it equips you it gives you
[47:46] what you need to overcome second it
[47:49] gives the work of the ministry it will
[47:51] help you work the ministry third it will
[47:53] build up the body help them to grow up
[47:55] spiritually fourth it will bring
[47:57] agreement among the body and I see that
[48:01] amongst the preachers I fellowship with
[48:03] and all the ones I've gone to preach for
[48:05] I see more unity than division amongst
[48:07] all of us I see plenty of unity if we
[48:10] have though disagreements we just don't
[48:11] talk right about them because it's
[48:13] really not on a major doctrine it's
[48:14] always on a minor so so I see more
[48:18] agreement all the time and I hope you do
[48:21] too by God's grace well and then the
[48:23] Bible said it brings knowledge and that
[48:24] word knowledge means precise truth it
[48:27] will bring the actual deep truth of God
[48:30] unto the portion or the measure of the
[48:33] maturity of Christ so whatever measure
[48:35] we are we're supposed to have the the
[48:38] fivefold ministry bring us to the exact
[48:40] knowledge we need in order to mature
[48:42] into the the measure of a Christian
[48:45] we're supposed to be praise God amen and
[48:47] then if we do that then we'll learn to
[48:50] speak the truth and love if we receive
[48:53] the preaching from the fivefold ministry
[48:54] and we'll be fitly joined together and
[48:57] then we will and when we're joined
[48:59] together in a body like this we will
[49:00] edify one another will strengthen each
[49:03] other right
[49:04] as I've told you before just you come
[49:05] into church I don't care how bad
[49:06] spiritually you are but just you come
[49:08] into Church edifies me then if I get to
[49:11] shake your hand and fellowship you
[49:12] that's even more edification but just
[49:14] seeing you here well praise the Lord
[49:16] they're not sick or they're you know
[49:17] they're not battling things or they're
[49:19] not backslidden or something like that
[49:20] just seeing the Saints in the house of
[49:22] God is enough to edify the body it's a
[49:25] chance remember this is a hospital so if
[49:27] we all were all sick throughout the week
[49:29] we all go through little spiritual
[49:30] battles we ought to come here to get
[49:32] well praise God and then we but and how
[49:34] do we do that we fitly joined together
[49:36] the the body Ana Phi's itself it heals
[49:39] itself in love right here that's why the
[49:41] first thing when people backside they
[49:43] generally leave church generally not
[49:45] always but they they leave that ability
[49:48] to be healed or strengthened or that
[49:50] spirit has such a control over them that
[49:52] they they now stay away from the love
[49:54] they now stay away from the nutrients or
[49:56] the spiritual vitamins we're supposed to
[49:58] run to those vitamins amen and we're
[50:00] supposed to be pepped up right here by
[50:02] the preaching of the word amen
[50:03] and this message will go a little deeper
[50:05] so you have to bear with me I hope you
[50:07] can catch it if not just you know listen
[50:09] to it again now well if we are truly
[50:12] receiving from the fivefold ministry we
[50:14] will not be immature will not be tossed
[50:18] or agitated like waves well what do I
[50:20] believe here what's about this what
[50:22] about that we won't be carried on
[50:24] people's opinions or or driven in doubt
[50:26] I don't know and I'm not sure what to do
[50:29] and we won't be deceived or led astray
[50:32] if we're truly feeding on the fivefold
[50:35] ministry right and church you've seen it
[50:38] every false doctrine and I'm going to
[50:40] name something a little bit like
[50:41] polygamy seven thunders they all get off
[50:43] and they all get led astray in some sin
[50:46] whether it's money or power or sex or
[50:48] whatever it is they all get led astray
[50:50] in something but when we can live a holy
[50:52] life
[50:53] that we can see that the holy spirits
[50:55] inside of us amen that's one thing they
[50:57] can't do they cannot live the holy life
[51:00] of a spirit-filled Christian hallelujah
[51:03] but that's what we're supposed to live
[51:04] by the grace of God and that's what we
[51:06] do when we feed on the fivefold ministry
[51:07] the right way cuz it's Jesus's gifts
[51:10] jesus said it's more beneficial than I
[51:12] leave so I can send down these gifts and
[51:14] that will perfect it by that will equip
[51:16] the body and it'll help us to all grow
[51:18] in unity and every all the Christians
[51:20] will come into the full measure the full
[51:22] maturity of Christ that I would like to
[51:24] them to come into amen through the
[51:26] preaching of the fivefold ministry
[51:27] that's the Word of God and that my
[51:29] friends will never change
[51:31] how many be this word will never change
[51:33] it will never change its never been
[51:35] God's pattern to change this pattern
[51:37] this is God's eternal padua to the
[51:40] eternal but everlasting pattern until
[51:42] the millennium amen
[51:44] now and we looked at the attacks on the
[51:46] fivefold ministry and I do apologize for
[51:48] the next slides are gonna be real small
[51:50] but the attacks I've seen is they want
[51:53] less live preaching but God's pattern
[51:55] can't change God always use a living man
[51:57] to keep the gardens they say the
[51:59] fivefold is failing but the real bride
[52:01] has no condemnation they say brother
[52:03] Branham is your pastor but if you do
[52:05] that you have no living accountability
[52:07] there's no one that's alive to you to be
[52:08] accountable for because Paul told
[52:10] Timothy to warn them that are unruly and
[52:12] administer church order like jesus said
[52:14] in matthew 18 a tape can't go to you and
[52:16] correct you if you're wrong right Paul
[52:21] told Timothy to rebuke them that sin
[52:22] before all and then also when an attack
[52:25] is worshiping brother Branham saying
[52:27] every word is thus saith the Lord and
[52:28] but brother Branham said that's tommyrot
[52:30] and then that really puts all the
[52:32] anointing on brother Branham and it
[52:34] actually it's Nicollet ISM it puts all
[52:36] the anointing on him and none on anybody
[52:37] else
[52:38] but if you've got the Holy Ghost you got
[52:39] the same anointing that was on him not
[52:41] the same gifts but the same anointing
[52:44] and then you know the attack is they you
[52:48] know with phones and internet and
[52:49] everything they try to see her so many
[52:51] voices they can't even hear what the
[52:52] Shepards been feeding them right now but
[52:56] we saw the power of the home church as
[52:57] well the home church is the most
[52:59] powerful weapon for cleansing and that's
[53:01] tight by the waters of separation they
[53:03] be sprinkled on the third day Wednesday
[53:05] and sprinkled on the seven
[53:06] as well amen Sunday and what's more
[53:10] powerful is it more powerful to be
[53:11] excited to revived every two months six
[53:14] months a year or every single time you
[53:16] gather in the house of the Lord
[53:18] what's a true test of your maturity it's
[53:21] how you behave day in and day out in
[53:24] your walk with Jesus Christ right and
[53:27] now brother man taught the same love I'm
[53:29] gonna go through these real quickly bro
[53:31] BAM said you don't have to you to love
[53:33] the Lord you ought to go to church you
[53:34] have to tell people that they'll walk
[53:36] through rain they'll go they'll walk
[53:38] through death to go to church they love
[53:41] it they just got to get there it's their
[53:42] life if they don't they just feel like
[53:44] they're perishing he said they go there
[53:46] to worship and they go home refreshed he
[53:50] said oh he's talking about how you know
[53:53] a mother may complain I got to get I got
[53:55] to get the kids up and ready and go to
[53:57] church he said you've never touched the
[53:58] resurrection brother when the
[54:00] resurrection come into your heart you
[54:02] longed to go to church there's something
[54:04] you just can't keep away from it on the
[54:05] inside now this one's really small so
[54:09] don't strain your eyes well Bram said
[54:10] for if you love God you can't they
[54:13] couldn't wire you away from church they
[54:15] couldn't chain you away they couldn't
[54:17] hide a believer from God he said just
[54:20] stop and watch your life if you love the
[54:22] world better than you love
[54:23] prayer-meeting if you'd rather watch a
[54:24] television program than to pray there's
[54:27] something wrong with you if you'd rather
[54:30] take a sunday afternoon ride instead of
[54:32] going to church well I just need to
[54:33] relax I can't gum the second service
[54:36] well you understand right he said
[54:39] there's something wrong with you
[54:40] somewhere because where your heart is
[54:42] there your treasures will be also see
[54:46] your heart is built into it he says well
[54:51] Ram says talks about spiritual
[54:52] discernment he said we ought to be going
[54:54] from one revival to another the bonfires
[54:56] of God's glory built in every Church in
[54:58] every place we ought to feel a bonfire
[55:00] here this morning every Church should
[55:02] have a bonfire where we all gather
[55:05] around the hot hotness of God's love and
[55:07] the warmth of his love and his spirit we
[55:10] ought to gather round and get refreshed
[55:11] in God's presence and he says cry out
[55:15] this is what we can do cry out to God
[55:17] for spiritual power and spiritual
[55:18] discernment that's why we come
[55:20] together they've cry out for those
[55:21] things he says he said we must love in
[55:25] our hearts to come to church if we don't
[55:26] love to love to come to church and love
[55:28] God
[55:29] he says you imagine a man saying he
[55:31] loved his wife and he hadn't seen her
[55:32] for a long time pass right by and say
[55:34] well I'll see her some other time or a
[55:38] wife saying she loves her husband or a
[55:39] parent saying they love her child why it
[55:41] shows I think our expressions we should
[55:43] be constantly longing to be in worship
[55:45] anywhere to worship the Lord I don't
[55:47] care if it's out at the dirty old YMCA I
[55:49] don't care who air it is we should long
[55:52] to be in worship amen if we got the
[55:55] Spirit of God don't say home if God's in
[55:57] your heart you can't hardly wait for
[55:58] them doors to open out yonder to get in
[56:00] there to fellowship with your brothers
[56:01] if you don't feel that way out then I
[56:03] tell you it's time you got to pray
[56:04] because we're in the last days I'm gonna
[56:06] skip past that here's one I love this
[56:08] one
[56:09] he said the Holy Spirit is letting we
[56:11] must let the Holy Spirit do the work of
[56:13] his office within you and creating in
[56:16] you a new life and making you so hungry
[56:18] to go to church that you can't stay away
[56:21] from church that's what the Holy Spirit
[56:23] will create in us and see we all when we
[56:26] all come to God we also hungry to come
[56:28] to church but Satan battles us and we
[56:30] lose it a little bit that hunger well
[56:31] we've got to battle back we've got to
[56:34] put on the full armor of God and battle
[56:35] back and be a so hungry to go to hear
[56:38] the preaching at the house of God into
[56:40] worship God with the songs and the glory
[56:42] amen
[56:43] that's exactly right he says if the life
[56:47] of Christ is in you you just long to go
[56:50] praise God
[56:51] so it's a very very simple question if
[56:53] the life who is the life of Christ in
[56:55] you if it is you longed to go to church
[56:57] I just want to go over these the Spirit
[57:01] of God will run you right straight to
[57:03] the church every time the door opens for
[57:06] fellowship the Spirit of God I guess
[57:11] that's why the Spirit of God is trying
[57:12] to get me to drive everyone to do the
[57:13] same thing here or whatever church
[57:16] people are streaming in I'm trying to
[57:17] get them to do the same thing drive them
[57:19] to the church that they should be
[57:21] attending right because live-streaming
[57:23] is not the end-all answer that's not the
[57:25] final answer it's just a temporary
[57:26] service when people can't make it but
[57:28] the ultimate goal is to get them in a
[57:30] home church praise God find their place
[57:34] he says you come to hear the message and
[57:35] the message is the Holy Spirit taking
[57:37] the Word of God and giving it to you
[57:39] praise the Lord if you love God you'd be
[57:42] at church you've got to get back to the
[57:45] church back to the Bible back to Christ
[57:47] how many love God that's why you're here
[57:49] amen
[57:50] but the man said have a church home or
[57:52] your die so I'm using some different
[57:53] other slides here just want to review
[57:54] maybe of 10-15 minutes
[57:56] he says you die without the fivefold
[57:58] ministry brother BAM says he says now
[58:02] remember this after this services
[58:03] afternoon you probably go back to your
[58:04] churches for tonight service I'll try
[58:06] early so you can do so sir brother ma'am
[58:08] didn't want the people missing their
[58:10] evening service at their home Church if
[58:12] I was in the city around I'd attend to
[58:14] these these churches here I really would
[58:16] I'm not saying that they never told me
[58:17] to say this there's some fine men real
[58:19] brothers and then each of you that
[58:21] accepted Christ if they didn't get your
[58:23] name why don't you look them up for
[58:25] Christian baptism and let them lead you
[58:27] on to the baptism of the holy ghost now
[58:29] how many people want to be led to the
[58:30] Holy Ghost now that's a that's a whole
[58:33] different story it's great if you
[58:34] already got it but if you don't have it
[58:36] it's great to recognize and say Lord
[58:38] lead me to the Holy Ghost praise God
[58:40] this is how a prophet would work in a
[58:43] local church find a pastor and then let
[58:45] him lead you to the Holy Ghost praise
[58:48] the God he says if you don't have a
[58:49] church see you'll die spiritually you'll
[58:52] just wind it away you'll be one of those
[58:55] what do we call let's go back there just
[58:56] a moment at slide twenty four you'll be
[58:58] one of these you'll be immature you're
[59:00] dwindle away you'll be tossed you'll be
[59:02] carried hesitant opinions deceive led
[59:04] astray if you don't have a home church
[59:07] praise God I'm glad to have a home
[59:09] church now I just want to do tithes and
[59:11] offerings again just briefly because
[59:13] I've had some questions about this here
[59:14] but Ram said I absolutely believe every
[59:17] person should stand their post of duty
[59:18] when their pastors their preaching or
[59:20] evangelist or something I think they
[59:22] ought to standard their posts of duty
[59:23] they also support that church with
[59:25] everything they got in them with their
[59:26] ties with their offerings with anything
[59:28] they're called to do be willing and
[59:30] happy if your pastor asks you to do
[59:32] something in your church you should do
[59:34] it that's good but don't let that just
[59:36] be the only thing get inoculated first
[59:39] that's what I'm trying to tell you you
[59:41] get the Holy Spirit first then the rest
[59:42] of it comes on alright and there's a
[59:45] reason church there's sometimes trouble
[59:47] with people many times
[59:48] because they're not born again right
[59:50] because if you get the Holy Ghost first
[59:53] it'll take care of everything else
[59:56] romance that eyes go to your own church
[59:58] not the Branham campaign ties are your
[1:00:01] first obligation to God in your church
[1:00:03] this is the 90s is in California 1959 I
[1:00:07] feel like this that a member of a church
[1:00:08] their first obligation is with their
[1:00:10] tithes and offerings is to support their
[1:00:12] church if your members of these fine
[1:00:14] churches that's represented here you
[1:00:16] support your church that's your first
[1:00:18] duty to God bring your tithes and
[1:00:20] offerings in the storehouse that's
[1:00:21] Malachi - that's your first duty to God
[1:00:24] and the storehouse you surely know what
[1:00:26] that is it's where you get your food so
[1:00:28] there's where you get your spiritual
[1:00:30] food and your obligation is to your
[1:00:32] church and not let's say not ready not
[1:00:34] to an evangelist like me Ray's God it's
[1:00:41] not to an evangelist it's to the local
[1:00:43] church every man ought to have a church
[1:00:45] home you ought to have a place not just
[1:00:46] to float about from pillar to post but
[1:00:49] to have some place where you go to
[1:00:50] church and you call it your church I'm
[1:00:52] so glad I can say this is my church I go
[1:00:56] to church here somewhere where you pay
[1:00:58] your tithe and somewhere that you help
[1:01:01] support the cause I love this take your
[1:01:03] choice so take a choice but here's what
[1:01:05] you have to do you have to discern the
[1:01:06] pastor spirit and guess what I'm trying
[1:01:09] to discern your spirit - I don't want
[1:01:11] rebel spirits in this church so we're
[1:01:14] all saying holy spirit help me to
[1:01:15] discern everybody's spirit here he said
[1:01:18] that then don't never dis fellowship
[1:01:20] with the other man because he don't
[1:01:21] belong with your group discern his
[1:01:23] spirit and see if he's got the same
[1:01:26] purpose in heart then you got fellowship
[1:01:28] one with another you're working for one
[1:01:30] great cause that's the cause of Christ I
[1:01:33] think that's absolutely true in other
[1:01:36] words lord help me to judge that pastor
[1:01:38] help me to judge that brother and sister
[1:01:40] the church let me see if their cause is
[1:01:42] truly Christ the word I'm open anytime
[1:01:46] you discern my spirit anytime you what
[1:01:48] my cause is Jesus Christ I hope you can
[1:01:51] see that by the grace of the Lord I hope
[1:01:54] no one that goes these fine churches
[1:01:56] around here will miss their services
[1:01:58] tomorrow night I hope they don't do it
[1:02:01] if they gotta post a duty stand at that
[1:02:04] that you stand at your post of duty at
[1:02:06] your church wherever you go to pay your
[1:02:08] tithing into it and you love your pastor
[1:02:11] and pray for him if you need to be
[1:02:12] prayed for ask him he's a man of God
[1:02:14] he'll pray for you and he and God will
[1:02:16] answer his prayer just as God will
[1:02:18] answer mine or anyone elses because
[1:02:20] after all it's your own faith in God
[1:02:22] that does the work but I've never
[1:02:24] exalted himself above the local pastor
[1:02:26] they're all in one Accord and he
[1:02:28] realized sheep had a certain Shepherd or
[1:02:30] a certain flock where they needed to
[1:02:32] stay with their pastor amen he says I
[1:02:37] want you to find these churches your
[1:02:38] church of your own denomination go there
[1:02:40] Church of your choice and of course if
[1:02:42] you have no church we'd be glad to have
[1:02:45] you tomorrow night but if your church is
[1:02:46] having service tomorrow night that's
[1:02:48] your duty that's your post of duty in
[1:02:49] your church we never want to shirk their
[1:02:52] own church never but I never wanted to
[1:02:57] take people either local church to come
[1:02:59] to his special meetings we never want
[1:03:02] any we would never want anybody to take
[1:03:04] money if they would put it in their own
[1:03:07] church and sponsor these meetings you
[1:03:10] put your own money in your own church if
[1:03:12] you have extra offering that month and
[1:03:14] you like to give it to the special
[1:03:15] meetings or a poor Widow woman that's
[1:03:18] what you give the poor with a woman but
[1:03:19] you support this church so we can help
[1:03:21] others amen glory your time and offering
[1:03:25] goes into your own church oh my if you
[1:03:31] feel to help in one of these meetings or
[1:03:33] something after your own church is taken
[1:03:36] care of that's fine but we never want to
[1:03:38] take one cent from any Church we're
[1:03:43] trying to help that church we're trying
[1:03:45] to do all we can that you'll be a better
[1:03:47] member of that church no matter what
[1:03:48] Church it is we want you to be a real
[1:03:50] loyal member and serve the Lord Jesus
[1:03:52] with all your heart I know a lot already
[1:03:57] radio a lot of radio talk with the
[1:03:59] brothers has radio programs they want to
[1:04:01] ride to them so they can get your
[1:04:02] address and send you offerings and
[1:04:04] things you won't get a letter like that
[1:04:05] friend and I believe that your money
[1:04:07] belongs in your church not to brother
[1:04:09] branham your money belongs in your
[1:04:11] church just exactly where it belongs and
[1:04:14] you put in your church your
[1:04:15] sightings in the sabor your church I'm
[1:04:17] just trying to help you don't have to
[1:04:19] send one thing just send it everything's
[1:04:20] free now let's look at the winds of
[1:04:23] doctrine is that okay for a little
[1:04:24] review I preached out like three years
[1:04:26] ago so I just thought I'd review it if
[1:04:28] you hadn't heard that but I just love it
[1:04:30] because I'm a pastor so God's called me
[1:04:32] at at a local church and so when this
[1:04:35] this topic is just dear to my heart
[1:04:36] because that's where God's called me you
[1:04:39] know mothers I mean I'm sure the
[1:04:40] scriptures on proverbs 31 are so dear to
[1:04:42] you right dad's you know your scriptures
[1:04:46] or whatever whatever may be the
[1:04:47] musicians you know those scriptures are
[1:04:49] so dear to you well that those are
[1:04:51] really dear to me because that's where
[1:04:52] God's called me and placed me but I also
[1:04:54] recognize that the strength of every
[1:04:56] Christian is how they worship God
[1:04:58] service in and service out in their
[1:05:00] local home Church now let's look at the
[1:05:03] winds of doctrine around the Branham
[1:05:04] Tabernacle it's been moving since 2015
[1:05:07] when they got when they when the former
[1:05:10] pastor resigned and they elected a new
[1:05:12] pastor but I just want to look at this
[1:05:14] briefly and I love all those pastors I
[1:05:16] love all them just let me say that but
[1:05:19] remember Abraham said this in 1963 don't
[1:05:21] forget this Tabernacle will lose its
[1:05:23] strength remember that this is the
[1:05:26] target where Satan has got every gun in
[1:05:28] Hell trained on it he'll cause one
[1:05:30] person who's something that's contrary
[1:05:31] to what the other one thinks he's doing
[1:05:33] that he is up to it that's his business
[1:05:35] if you can get somebody to say something
[1:05:37] somebody to talk about another and say
[1:05:38] well listen did you know so-and-so did
[1:05:40] don't you listen to it don't you listen
[1:05:42] to it that's all that's the devil that's
[1:05:44] see it's saying don't you believe it so
[1:05:46] it seems like the prophets saying
[1:05:48] Satan is gonna try to get in the
[1:05:50] tabernacle and try to get people pitted
[1:05:51] against each other
[1:05:52] gossiping about each other he goes on to
[1:05:55] say if there's anything that somebody's
[1:05:56] done wrong pray for them and don't pray
[1:06:00] in a selfish way and say I know it's my
[1:06:02] duty I've got to pray for that brother
[1:06:04] you ever said a selfish prayer I'm sure
[1:06:07] we all have he said you take it to your
[1:06:10] heart really down for that sister and
[1:06:12] just talk and be real sweet and the
[1:06:14] first thing you know you'll find them
[1:06:16] right back in the service again see
[1:06:17] because after all we're headed towards
[1:06:19] the setting of the Sun so this is not a
[1:06:21] prophecy by just I don't know why
[1:06:22] brother Aaron would say that that the
[1:06:24] tabernacle is going to lose its strength
[1:06:26] and then he talks about how spirits come
[1:06:28] in the church
[1:06:29] and he goes on to talk about the rapture
[1:06:31] he said they'll be so or the rapture
[1:06:33] it'll just be so quietly that nobody
[1:06:34] would know nothing about it
[1:06:35] well they say that little Tabernacle in
[1:06:37] a place called Jeffersonville there were
[1:06:39] so many of the members that went missing
[1:06:40] so in the same breath he says he's gonna
[1:06:42] lose his strength he he also believes
[1:06:44] some would be raptured from that church
[1:06:45] so it's just interesting it's not a
[1:06:47] prophecy but I just want to share that
[1:06:49] with you I don't know why you know God
[1:06:50] allowed brother BAM to say that but the
[1:06:53] but here's the four reasons I want to
[1:06:55] look at here
[1:06:56] four give me about 45 more minutes here
[1:07:01] these are the four I've seen rise up
[1:07:04] since I've been in the message and most
[1:07:07] most most obviously the last three years
[1:07:11] since the leadership changed at Branham
[1:07:13] Tabernacle for the first thing is wrong
[1:07:17] that I believe that I think they've
[1:07:19] gotten off the word is they used a
[1:07:21] certain type of Joseph of the Old
[1:07:22] Testament I'm gonna go through each one
[1:07:24] the second is many of them believe that
[1:07:26] every word brother Branham said was thus
[1:07:28] saith the Lord
[1:07:28] the third thing is a misinterpretation I
[1:07:31] heard of what house will you build me
[1:07:33] where they say that brother Branham
[1:07:35] needs to get back in every pulpit that
[1:07:38] he's not in every pulpit but I'd say his
[1:07:42] message is in this pulpit even though a
[1:07:45] tape recorders not in this pulpit his
[1:07:47] message is in this pulpit because it's
[1:07:49] not my message it's the Bible message
[1:07:51] but they're saying put the tape back in
[1:07:53] the pulpit and I said God never heard
[1:07:55] ain't it that way so we'll go get to
[1:07:56] that and the fourth thing is they say
[1:07:58] the tape boys so the men who just go and
[1:08:01] take tapes overseas and don't preach is
[1:08:03] the true fivefold ministry and replacing
[1:08:07] the false five in full ministry of live
[1:08:09] preachers so I think you can see why I
[1:08:12] had to preach this because it's off the
[1:08:15] word and church I you know it's either
[1:08:18] one of two things it's either sweet
[1:08:19] people dear precious Souls and I believe
[1:08:22] we're gonna be saved that have got a
[1:08:23] wrong spirit or it's the or it's the
[1:08:27] Antichrist spirit and they're really
[1:08:30] attacking and and they're attacking true
[1:08:32] true sons and daughters of God it's one
[1:08:34] of the other so I believe it's this
[1:08:36] they're all sweet they're just a little
[1:08:38] off the word a little bit okay that's
[1:08:40] what I believe now there may be some
[1:08:41] like in every Church there could be
[1:08:43] there could be serpent seed in every
[1:08:44] Church but don't ever let the devil tell
[1:08:46] you that praise God say devil I'm here
[1:08:48] I'm just here to serve Jesus Christ I
[1:08:50] didn't go looking for this message this
[1:08:51] message found me even if I was born
[1:08:53] under it this message found me praise
[1:08:55] God
[1:08:55] Amen I'm just blessed to be born under
[1:08:58] think about all the people that were
[1:08:59] born under Timothy was born into to
[1:09:01] think of all these people all of all of
[1:09:03] John and Polycarp and all these
[1:09:05] different ones they were just born into
[1:09:07] it praise God see so it's a blessing
[1:09:10] it's a blessing be born into it
[1:09:11] hallelujah let's look at the type of
[1:09:13] Joseph now I'm going to be quoting
[1:09:16] literal quote so I and I listen I spent
[1:09:19] six hours at the library studying
[1:09:20] yesterday because my car was getting
[1:09:22] fixed and it's still not fixed
[1:09:23] anyways I sat there for six hours I
[1:09:25] listened to all these things to confirm
[1:09:27] these are actual statements that people
[1:09:28] are making from the Branham tabernacle
[1:09:31] but this one goes back before this move
[1:09:33] in 2001 an article written from voice of
[1:09:37] God called here I stand it contains a
[1:09:39] type that brother Branham never used so
[1:09:42] they say that that bro Graham's son
[1:09:44] Joseph is a type of Joseph of the Old
[1:09:46] Testament but this is wrong because it
[1:09:49] types the bride as either Egypt or
[1:09:51] Joseph's brother rather than typing the
[1:09:54] bride as Joseph's Gentile life as an F
[1:09:58] okay so the air behind this is they've
[1:10:02] added to the word or message or they're
[1:10:04] misinterpreting the message and let me
[1:10:07] prove it to you here brother man oh now
[1:10:10] remember brother ham says you must not
[1:10:11] do three things with the scripture you
[1:10:12] must not misinterpret the word you must
[1:10:14] not miss misplace it and you must not
[1:10:16] dislocate it or else what does it do it
[1:10:20] throws you into a full confusion and a
[1:10:22] chaos agitated on the waters every wind
[1:10:27] of doctrine blowing you from this
[1:10:28] opinion blow into that opinion don't get
[1:10:30] me wrong you know a lot of these people
[1:10:31] that that have now gone to
[1:10:34] Jeffersonville
[1:10:35] they've gone there because they've been
[1:10:36] hurt by preachers who weren't burned
[1:10:38] again and shame on those preachers who
[1:10:40] were burned again because they got them
[1:10:42] off into false doctrine the mysteries of
[1:10:44] the people a true man of God won't do
[1:10:46] that a true man of God will stay with
[1:10:48] the word amen but see many of them are
[1:10:51] so hurt because that's you can hear
[1:10:52] their you can hear their screams and
[1:10:54] cries you can just sense it like they're
[1:10:56] saying we don't need
[1:10:57] we just need brother branham we just
[1:10:58] need the message he won't give us false
[1:11:00] doctrine well that's true he won't but
[1:11:02] that's not God's pattern God's pattern
[1:11:04] is to anoint brother branham prepared
[1:11:06] people that would walk in his footsteps
[1:11:07] after he left the scene praise God
[1:11:10] amen but I think you understand so
[1:11:14] here's the literal quote it says you
[1:11:16] might be eating stolen bread my friend
[1:11:18] so if you're what they were saying is if
[1:11:20] you listen to a tape that wasn't
[1:11:21] produced by voice of God it's soul and
[1:11:23] bread but it's not because there's a
[1:11:25] famine among the bride or because I've
[1:11:27] schemed to keep it through from your
[1:11:29] table as someone have you to believe the
[1:11:30] food has been stored up why should the
[1:11:33] bride be starving the greeneries are
[1:11:35] stocked food is available in 45
[1:11:37] languages so see there this is a this is
[1:11:41] a scripture they're pulling from Genesis
[1:11:43] 41 where there was famine all over the
[1:11:45] face of the earth and Joseph opened all
[1:11:46] the storehouses so see they're placing
[1:11:50] the bride as Egypt starving but see
[1:11:53] Joseph's wife was never serving glory
[1:11:57] she was she was always in the temple
[1:12:00] with Joseph amen it's just the wrong
[1:12:04] type you know just misinterpreting the
[1:12:06] word and the that might prove they're
[1:12:08] not preachers because they're handling
[1:12:10] the word and misinterpreting the word
[1:12:12] because it's a gift of God that rightly
[1:12:14] divides the word not a man it's the gift
[1:12:16] of God hallelujah so see Joseph's wife
[1:12:21] Joseph's wife a Senath was always in the
[1:12:24] palace type in the Gentile bride she
[1:12:26] wasn't starving show me a scripture
[1:12:28] where she started she's not Egypt has
[1:12:32] correctly typed so the correct type is
[1:12:33] Egypt is typed to the world running to
[1:12:36] and fro around the world searching for
[1:12:38] food which fulfills the prophecy of Amos
[1:12:40] 8:11 and 12 and Joseph's brethren are
[1:12:43] correctly tight as the 144,000 that's
[1:12:46] the correct type because brother Ham
[1:12:48] tells us well here's there's the verse
[1:12:50] behold the days come saith the Lord God
[1:12:52] I will send a famine in the land not a
[1:12:54] famine of bread nor a thirst for water
[1:12:57] but of hearing the words of the Lord and
[1:12:59] they shall wander from sea to sea and
[1:13:01] from the North even in the east they
[1:13:03] shall run to and fro to seek the world
[1:13:04] Lord and shall not find it the world is
[1:13:06] the one that starving we're not starving
[1:13:08] we've got fresh bread
[1:13:10] men hallelujah the bride is not starving
[1:13:14] she's feasting on the Word of God she is
[1:13:16] at the run around the world she can get
[1:13:17] fresh bread right from her local church
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:20] that's the way God designed it praise
[1:13:21] God now you can be blessed in a special
[1:13:24] services of course but the point is you
[1:13:27] don't have to wander all around you have
[1:13:28] to go somewhere else to get a revival
[1:13:30] you can get a revival right now praise
[1:13:31] God that's how God ordained it so see
[1:13:36] brother Branham repeatedly said Joseph
[1:13:37] the Old Testament types Jesus Christ for
[1:13:41] Messiah or Christ will reveal himself to
[1:13:43] his brother in the 144,000 so that it's
[1:13:46] the heir of either adding to the word or
[1:13:47] misinterpreting the word and the program
[1:13:50] says in the church age but plainly let's
[1:13:52] examine the life of Joseph while he was
[1:13:53] in Egypt for it is here where we see him
[1:13:55] as the perfect type of Christ not my son
[1:13:59] which we respect his son godly man a
[1:14:01] wonderful businessman wonderful does a
[1:14:04] tremendous job I love all those tracts I
[1:14:06] love the books it's it's true it's
[1:14:08] tremendous he does a fantastic job but
[1:14:10] brother I've never said that Joseph
[1:14:12] typed his son he never said that if you
[1:14:15] don't like the church age book here's
[1:14:17] another quote where it says the same
[1:14:18] thing in a regular sermon I see one
[1:14:20] before me now his name's Joseph he was
[1:14:21] an elected son he was a perfect type of
[1:14:23] Jesus Christ he's born a prophet he was
[1:14:27] a prophet okay so see we you and I
[1:14:30] understand brother Brandon was a man and
[1:14:33] that had he had his own hopes I'm gonna
[1:14:36] show you some quotes this might shock
[1:14:37] you to put on your shock proof vest for
[1:14:39] a minute brother Branham wanted Billy
[1:14:42] Paul to be a preacher and a full prophet
[1:14:44] just like him he so badly wanted Billy
[1:14:47] Paul to see visions and even pray that
[1:14:49] God let Billy Paul see visions like me
[1:14:51] he also said his Joseph from the
[1:14:53] Minneapolis prayer experience was with
[1:14:56] him the whole time Billy Paul so you
[1:14:58] remember in Minnesota in Minneapolis no
[1:15:00] man was praying in the closet he just
[1:15:02] read about Joseph as the Lord what thank
[1:15:03] you for a man like Joseph and the Holy
[1:15:05] Spirit told him you're gonna have a
[1:15:06] Joseph that was around 1950 or 49 I
[1:15:10] can't member which one it was well in
[1:15:11] 1951 brother Branham thought that it was
[1:15:14] Billy Paul but at later God sent him an
[1:15:17] actual Joseph and I'm going to show you
[1:15:20] the quotes so see even prophets even God
[1:15:22] though God gives ambitions and things
[1:15:24] he doesn't always explain it he lets
[1:15:26] them wrestle it out see he puts us on
[1:15:29] the same basis right brother Ram didn't
[1:15:31] have it any easier than we have in fact
[1:15:34] he had it harder than we had because
[1:15:36] there's with more gifts come more
[1:15:37] responsibility look what he says my
[1:15:40] background being so sinful as I
[1:15:42] explained my people I'm gonna skip down
[1:15:44] and maybe my little boy would be a fully
[1:15:45] a prophet sent from God I pray to that
[1:15:47] so brother man would pray and this is a
[1:15:49] 1951 Joseph wasn't born till 55 so 1951
[1:15:53] he's a his boy Billy Paul he's praying
[1:15:57] God make Milli Paul prophet then I went
[1:16:01] when I meet went to meet the little baby
[1:16:03] speaking of Sarah cuz say this Sarah was
[1:16:05] born in 51 a nurse from the Mayo I've
[1:16:08] been healed of cancer when the baby was
[1:16:10] brought come to meet it instead of the
[1:16:11] Spirit falling to the baby it fell back
[1:16:14] this way again and I believe it's just
[1:16:17] ahead of me what I've asked for I
[1:16:19] believe God has it just ahead I believe
[1:16:21] I'll see it and that's what I pray for
[1:16:23] so brother I was praying for the
[1:16:24] anointing of a prophet to fall on his
[1:16:26] son but then brother Ham had a daughter
[1:16:28] and so he said it didn't go on Sarah I
[1:16:30] went back to Billy Paul now you've all
[1:16:33] heard brother brother brother Billy
[1:16:35] Paul's testimony he's not a preacher and
[1:16:36] he's not a prophet and the church said
[1:16:40] but brother and prayed make him a full
[1:16:42] prophet just like you would pray right
[1:16:45] make my son or daughter or make them a
[1:16:47] real child of God give them all the
[1:16:48] spiritual gifts and blessings oh that's
[1:16:51] not he's not done my little boy with
[1:16:53] this now soon to be 16 years old this is
[1:16:55] Billy Paul he seemed to be a good boy he
[1:16:57] minded me was very lovely little fella I
[1:16:59] talked him about being baptized and
[1:17:01] making his public confession of Christ
[1:17:02] he live good at everything little fella
[1:17:04] but about a week after that I talked or
[1:17:06] walked into the house and he come
[1:17:08] without me asking him saying daddy I
[1:17:09] want to be a Christian I want to serve
[1:17:11] the Lord my Joseph was right with me
[1:17:13] when I didn't know it this little baby
[1:17:17] that I thought would be Joseph is a
[1:17:19] little girl and I called her Sarah so
[1:17:25] see brother man thought well this next
[1:17:26] baby's gonna be Joseph but it wasn't
[1:17:28] just a boy so he name is Sarah so in his
[1:17:30] mind he thought well maybe that
[1:17:31] experience I had maybe God was already
[1:17:33] telling me already had my Joseph with me
[1:17:35] he's wrestling with the will of God are
[1:17:38] glad to know that brother branham had to
[1:17:39] wrestle to understand God's will just
[1:17:41] like you do amen glory he's I've had my
[1:17:46] Joseph with me this whole time Billy
[1:17:48] Paul and it wasn't it wasn't he said I'm
[1:17:54] a boy and a girl either which way it
[1:17:56] went would be all right so I wanted a
[1:17:57] boy as far as he could be a minister of
[1:17:59] the gospel and I'll be that god is
[1:18:01] calling my little boy back there gonna
[1:18:03] be a minister of the gospel see bro
[1:18:04] Graham believed it but he wasn't called
[1:18:06] to be a minister thank you thank you
[1:18:09] seeing the wisdom of God now I
[1:18:11] understand if you ask God God will give
[1:18:13] you this out of your heart I don't
[1:18:15] believe it the little baby Sarah would
[1:18:16] have been born to have come up to the
[1:18:18] age of a minister Jesus will be here
[1:18:20] before that time I believe so brother
[1:18:21] BAM so he's so trying to make this make
[1:18:23] sense in his mind he's saying well yeah
[1:18:25] this this baby Sarah could not have been
[1:18:28] a boy because G is gonna be here before
[1:18:29] he's old enough to preach see how he's
[1:18:34] just try he's just trying to understand
[1:18:36] God's will for his life is there any sin
[1:18:39] in this no he never said thus saith the
[1:18:41] Lord this next baby is gonna be joseffer
[1:18:43] he never said the say Lord Billy Paul is
[1:18:45] gonna be a prophecy we've gotta let
[1:18:47] brother branham be brother branham be a
[1:18:48] man now look I've asked two of Joseph's
[1:18:53] close friends which they've told me I
[1:18:55] didn't ask them if they they told me
[1:18:56] they were Joseph's close friends as a
[1:18:58] child if he ever spoke thus say the Lord
[1:19:00] and both said no so it's just
[1:19:03] interesting just you know because
[1:19:05] brother Bram believed and prayed he
[1:19:06] would be a prophet now look what he
[1:19:08] prayed in 56 this is after Joseph is
[1:19:10] born and I trust that the prophetic or
[1:19:12] whatever may be the gift of God that has
[1:19:14] been so solemnly given will rest upon
[1:19:16] either Billy or Joseph or one what when
[1:19:19] I leave that God will continue the
[1:19:20] ministry after I pass beyond the scene
[1:19:22] has Joseph or Billy done the same
[1:19:25] ministry as brother Branham no they
[1:19:28] don't call up in a prayer line and
[1:19:29] discern and everybody rejoices and they
[1:19:31] get weak and the but he prayed it would
[1:19:34] happen and that's okay he who wouldn't
[1:19:37] want to see that gift continued now we
[1:19:38] all want to but God knew it wasn't God
[1:19:41] knew that son of man already been given
[1:19:42] to the Jews Samaritans and Gentiles and
[1:19:45] after that that was the last sign of the
[1:19:46] Gentiles and that was thus saith the
[1:19:48] Lord to see he prayed God just
[1:19:51] let this a ministry fall on Billy Paul
[1:19:53] or let it fall on Joseph and it hasn't
[1:19:58] look what he says here
[1:20:00] this isn't 57 all night long I couldn't
[1:20:03] get that opossum off my mind the next
[1:20:04] morning early I went out and I started
[1:20:06] out little Rebecca who I believe is
[1:20:08] going to maybe take my place someday
[1:20:14] little Rebecca was gonna take brother
[1:20:16] branham's place seeing visions she's
[1:20:23] seen her first vision just recently
[1:20:24] because she dreamed about the opossum
[1:20:27] all night and then God healed the
[1:20:28] opossum so brother man thought well
[1:20:29] perhaps she'll take my place someday she
[1:20:32] envisions I don't know if she did does
[1:20:33] anybody know do you know sister Karen
[1:20:35] okay I don't know I never heard of
[1:20:37] sister Rebeka having all kinds of dreams
[1:20:39] of vision I'm just saying I'm just
[1:20:40] trying to show you how brother Branham
[1:20:42] was a man and he wanted all of his
[1:20:43] children to take his place someday even
[1:20:45] his daughter Rebecca could come back
[1:20:50] this way now look he's got Rebecca up in
[1:20:51] the prayer line a little girl
[1:20:54] he said come back this way honey stop
[1:20:56] right here there's my little girl so who
[1:20:58] someday will be a prophetess also he
[1:21:02] just believed it he just hoped she'd be
[1:21:04] a prophetess but I you know I've never
[1:21:06] heard her say thus saith Lord has
[1:21:07] anybody ever heard Rebecca I know she's
[1:21:09] passed now but see this was just brother
[1:21:11] branham's desire I hope she's a
[1:21:13] prophetess someday he she saw a dream it
[1:21:16] happened she must be a prophet there's
[1:21:18] nothing wrong with that that was just
[1:21:19] his desire he didn't say they'll say the
[1:21:21] Lord she's gonna be he just said he
[1:21:23] hoped she would be so he had Rebekah
[1:21:27] come up and lay hands let my little girl
[1:21:29] lay hands on you there remember when she
[1:21:31] was a teenager she had the devil on her
[1:21:33] she slammed the door mother and said
[1:21:34] that was the devil slamming the door in
[1:21:37] her mom's face but here before the devil
[1:21:40] gets on her he has her praying in the
[1:21:43] prayer lines for sick people because
[1:21:46] he's a man let's let let's let brother
[1:21:49] man be a man so can everybody see that
[1:21:51] that the type of Joseph's camera I see
[1:21:53] that that doesn't fit the Bible that
[1:21:54] doesn't fit any quotes doesn't the Bible
[1:21:56] but that's something they believe in
[1:21:58] jeffersonville but that's fine they're
[1:21:59] allowed to believe whatever they want
[1:22:00] but I believe it gets dangerous because
[1:22:02] you start misusing types
[1:22:05] and shadows inhuman now you now you have
[1:22:07] beliefs that aren't exactly from the
[1:22:09] scripture and I say that with all the
[1:22:13] love in my heart I should you guys were
[1:22:14] there William and brother Aaron and
[1:22:17] brother Jose we were there we all talked
[1:22:18] about it you know
[1:22:19] a lot of these things when didn't come
[1:22:20] to my mind when they were the minutes of
[1:22:22] talking about it or else I would have
[1:22:24] brought him up but I did tell them I
[1:22:25] said well I said every word I don't
[1:22:28] leave everywhere as I said the Lord I
[1:22:29] said I said it takes the gift to rightly
[1:22:31] divide the word of truth that's what I
[1:22:33] told them because that was my that was
[1:22:35] my only question I had he said you have
[1:22:37] any questions I said yes I do is
[1:22:39] everywhere brother branham say thus
[1:22:40] saith the Lord and I was I was they were
[1:22:42] very nice they were some of the sweetest
[1:22:43] people you'd ever want to meet but see
[1:22:45] this is just where we're different and
[1:22:46] these are wins Church this is a win
[1:22:48] going around if you make Joseph a type
[1:22:50] of of Joseph of the Old Testament you've
[1:22:53] got all kits God got some chaos yeah
[1:22:56] some now you're starving and you you
[1:22:58] have to live off of them but that's the
[1:22:59] way nothing god never had it's not on
[1:23:01] earthly headquarters it's the heavenly
[1:23:03] headquarters amen we appreciate that the
[1:23:05] printing and the DVDs in the micro SD
[1:23:08] card we appreciate all that but we do
[1:23:10] not lean on them our headquarters is in
[1:23:12] heaven or our leader sits on the throne
[1:23:14] in heaven amen
[1:23:16] see but that type can exalt Joseph to
[1:23:20] take in the place of Christ in people's
[1:23:21] lives and we all we've all heard of
[1:23:23] people that knew that there's a brother
[1:23:24] in Guyana
[1:23:25] who was at the meetings we preached back
[1:23:27] in 2000 was a 2008 the first time I went
[1:23:30] and he's now left preaching and not only
[1:23:31] plays tapes and he basically takes every
[1:23:33] word Joseph says is thus saith the Lord
[1:23:34] and he won't forbid people to be in
[1:23:38] baptize you know by any other anyone
[1:23:39] else except him they got to come through
[1:23:41] the Joseph Church now most people are
[1:23:43] not like that I'm just giving you
[1:23:45] example if you don't take these things
[1:23:46] these wins of doctrine are gonna carry
[1:23:48] people farther and further away from the
[1:23:50] Word of God is that okay it's with love
[1:23:54] and you brothers know that we love
[1:23:56] though those are some of the sweetest
[1:23:57] people you want to meet so the second
[1:23:59] thing is it's recently come about every
[1:24:02] word they say is thus saith the Lord and
[1:24:03] when we were there the three brothers
[1:24:05] are witnesses they believed that their
[1:24:06] they believed every word is they'll say
[1:24:08] the Lord because they're fearful they
[1:24:10] don't want to take away anything they're
[1:24:13] not sure what is the sale order what
[1:24:15] isn't so they just make it all the saith
[1:24:17] the Lord but see we
[1:24:19] by fear we live by faith God is not
[1:24:22] giving us a spirit of fear and I think
[1:24:24] that was the exact word he used I think
[1:24:25] he said I'm scared we're scared that we
[1:24:28] don't want to make something not thus
[1:24:30] saith Lord if it is so see we don't want
[1:24:33] to live by fear now I understand they
[1:24:34] might be saying godly fear but still you
[1:24:37] can't make every word a man says born in
[1:24:39] sin you can't make a man infallible
[1:24:41] who's born in sin Jesus Christ was born
[1:24:43] by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:24:45] he wasn't born in sin it's a whole
[1:24:46] different story to see but I appreciate
[1:24:49] that respect I do I do
[1:24:51] so Salman brother Anna's family are on
[1:24:53] record and bold about saying every word
[1:24:55] he said was thus saith the Lord I have
[1:24:57] the links if you want to view them
[1:24:58] there's there's two links online so this
[1:25:00] is an air it's either a serious air due
[1:25:02] to immaturity of precious persons or see
[1:25:06] Antichrist spirit deifying William
[1:25:08] Branham stealing the worship from Jesus
[1:25:10] Christ so all that's needed is just the
[1:25:11] repentance I'm sorry I just got off the
[1:25:14] word the same thing happened when
[1:25:15] brother Branham was on the earth they
[1:25:16] they believed he was the Messiah you
[1:25:18] know so they asked now we've gone
[1:25:20] through this many times they asked
[1:25:22] brother Branham did you announce that a
[1:25:24] million African Americans would be
[1:25:26] killed because brother man had mentioned
[1:25:28] that earlier that Martin Luther King jr.
[1:25:29] would lead them to a deathtrap and he
[1:25:31] said I always told you be careful see
[1:25:33] that's just the human side he says
[1:25:35] always if there's anything that goes
[1:25:36] forth it will speak it's thus saith the
[1:25:38] Lord
[1:25:38] brother Mannis said no I was just
[1:25:40] talking about Martin Luther King jr. and
[1:25:42] then he says I have no prophecy on this
[1:25:44] I have nothing on it from the Lord he
[1:25:47] but when he speaks it I say it's not me
[1:25:49] it's thus saith the Lord he said I don't
[1:25:51] know about Martin Luther King I don't
[1:25:52] know I can't say that's just my opinion
[1:25:54] just like Rebecca she's gonna be a
[1:25:57] prophetess and she'll take my place
[1:25:59] someday that's just his opinion Billy
[1:26:03] Paul is my Joseph that was just his
[1:26:06] opinion does every understand
[1:26:11] in 1962 people were saying brother
[1:26:13] Branham they were saying brother Branham
[1:26:14] says you can men can leave your wives
[1:26:16] and hunt for a spiritual mate and then
[1:26:18] I'm perfectly infallible there's he said
[1:26:20] Oh some of the awfulest things you ever
[1:26:22] heard he said then they were prophesying
[1:26:26] saying one man should leave his wife and
[1:26:27] go marry another and now this church
[1:26:29] knows that we don't stand for tommyrot
[1:26:30] as that
[1:26:32] it's tommyrot when you say every word he
[1:26:34] says is thus saith the Lord and I'm not
[1:26:36] being critical this didn't come to me I
[1:26:38] wish it would came to me when we were
[1:26:39] sitting there I would have shared that
[1:26:40] with this I wish it just innit
[1:26:42] it didn't I was nervous and I just I
[1:26:43] want to be respectful and I really
[1:26:45] wanted to CERN his spear like rubberband
[1:26:46] said discern his spirit got a good
[1:26:49] spirit but just off the word scared
[1:26:51] fearful that's what that's what
[1:26:52] discerned to me that's what the Holy
[1:26:54] Spirit in me discerned
[1:26:55] they're just fearful they just maybe
[1:26:57] they don't well they obviously they
[1:26:59] don't have the gift to rightly divide
[1:27:00] the word so it's awful it's tommyrot
[1:27:05] when you make but everything brother
[1:27:06] branham says thus saith the lord because
[1:27:08] he's the only one that says everything
[1:27:11] he says is infallible praise God he's
[1:27:13] the only one the Lord Jesus I remember
[1:27:17] brother man mix things up on tapes one
[1:27:18] time he said there were seven weeks
[1:27:20] between the feast of weeks and the
[1:27:21] trumpets he said how he said I'll
[1:27:22] probably hear from it he knew he made
[1:27:25] mistakes often on tape so he says I
[1:27:27] always hear from it when I make a
[1:27:28] mistake on the tape he said but if you
[1:27:30] happen to catch it on your tape remember
[1:27:32] look in the Bible if there's a mistake
[1:27:34] Church just look in the Bible see it
[1:27:37] doesn't we don't to be scared we should
[1:27:39] just make sure remember the Bible says
[1:27:41] what must have preacher do he must study
[1:27:43] and make himself approved unto who God
[1:27:46] Jesus so a minister does not come preach
[1:27:49] until he's been in the prayer closet
[1:27:51] with Christ and Christ has approved this
[1:27:53] message
[1:27:54] he just doesn't guess and hope this is
[1:27:56] the right thing he gets in there the
[1:27:57] spirit anointing he comes out here
[1:27:59] preaches it to the people and the sheep
[1:28:00] rejoice the Sheep er fed they're edified
[1:28:03] they're strengthened that's God's Way
[1:28:04] praise God but it takes a gift to do
[1:28:06] that takes a gift of God now God knows I
[1:28:11] never thought I was gonna be a pastor
[1:28:13] you can ask my wife she knew me in high
[1:28:15] school
[1:28:15] did you ever think I was gonna be a
[1:28:16] pastor honey no nope so it's just a gift
[1:28:22] of God it was laying in there the whole
[1:28:23] time and just had to wait on the Lord
[1:28:25] and he brought it out it's God's Way
[1:28:30] buh-bam says
[1:28:32] the absolute is the holy spirit he'll
[1:28:34] not share his glory with anyone it's our
[1:28:38] ability only belongs to its Christ who
[1:28:40] not share that with anyone else so Cobra
[1:28:44] ham says the evil spirits will not
[1:28:46] reason when someone is and we've seen
[1:28:48] this you know recently in our church and
[1:28:49] other times you know in the past as well
[1:28:51] when someone has the evil spirit they
[1:28:53] will not move from their position
[1:28:54] they're so convinced they're right they
[1:28:56] won't repent now somebody repents that
[1:28:58] means they just got off of the line a
[1:28:59] little bit and God's delivered to them
[1:29:01] of that evil spirit but if they will not
[1:29:03] repent of it it's because an evil
[1:29:05] spirits on them and anyone that says you
[1:29:09] know they believe every word brother
[1:29:10] Branham said they don't believe every
[1:29:12] word man said if they got an evil spirit
[1:29:14] on them
[1:29:14] bro BAM said there was people
[1:29:16] worshipping him and they said the men
[1:29:18] believe me they said they believed every
[1:29:19] word I said how do you believe me then
[1:29:21] if I tell you then we got the word then
[1:29:23] we got to the word then they begin to
[1:29:24] see well sure we didn't believe you or
[1:29:27] we'd have listened to what you said so
[1:29:29] we could only say we believe brother
[1:29:31] Branham when we do what he tells us to
[1:29:32] do program says see they actually
[1:29:37] thought they were right sincerely and
[1:29:38] one of them spirits gets on you that's
[1:29:40] got it see you'll absolutely believe it
[1:29:43] I don't care you nobody can tell you any
[1:29:45] different that's when you know someone
[1:29:48] has a real demon on them you can't you
[1:29:50] can't reason with them you can't talk
[1:29:51] about it
[1:29:52] they're just fully off the word because
[1:29:54] they worship that thing they worship
[1:29:57] that demon no matter how much the word
[1:30:00] says so you just won't believe it anyhow
[1:30:02] if you want to be that way go ahead I'm
[1:30:04] having my own way see it shows you're
[1:30:05] anointed with the wrong spirit that's
[1:30:08] why we always got to be humble Church no
[1:30:10] matter what we believe Lord make me
[1:30:12] humble that I can be corrected if I'm
[1:30:14] wrong but prove it by the mouth of two
[1:30:17] or three witnesses so how do you know
[1:30:21] what's thus saith the Lord well brother
[1:30:22] Branham will say thus saith the Lord or
[1:30:24] like they did before they had prophets
[1:30:26] how did that how did John Wesley know he
[1:30:28] had thus saith the Lord
[1:30:29] how did Martin Luther know he had the
[1:30:31] state the Lord because he had in the
[1:30:34] mouth of two or three witnesses in the
[1:30:36] Bible and his preaching if rightly
[1:30:38] divided that that was the word of truth
[1:30:40] he was not a prophet so how did he know
[1:30:43] he had to take it back to this
[1:30:45] scripture by the Word of God the Holy
[1:30:47] Spirit did it by the word the two or
[1:30:48] three witnesses God anointed it that's
[1:30:51] how he knew it was thus saith the Lord
[1:30:52] praise God there's no fear because God
[1:30:56] has given us the spirit of power love
[1:30:57] and a sound mind I hope you don't come
[1:31:00] to church fearful you come to church
[1:31:02] fearful you you and I better sit down we
[1:31:03] better open our Bibles and have a good
[1:31:05] Bible buy a good Bible study I'm not
[1:31:07] about a big long Bible study because as
[1:31:09] far as I know I haven't preciate
[1:31:10] anything wrong and if I have and
[1:31:12] somebody come show me about it I don't
[1:31:14] come to church scared other than just
[1:31:15] let you know fear in God's presence you
[1:31:17] know wanting to please God when I don't
[1:31:19] come but you're scared I come to church
[1:31:21] under the anointing I've I've got my
[1:31:23] message approved of God as I was just
[1:31:25] studying I prayed I fasted I've skipped
[1:31:27] meals I know where I'm at I know what
[1:31:28] God showed me and I'd only bring what
[1:31:30] God has shown me amen and if I if it's
[1:31:33] something I don't know I'd say yeah this
[1:31:34] is my opinion this is my thought on I
[1:31:38] could be wrong this is my thought
[1:31:40] thoroughly it misinterpreting the
[1:31:44] message brother man preach called what
[1:31:45] house will you build me
[1:31:47] I forgot me yeah build me sorry so in
[1:31:52] this message one of my Rams children
[1:31:54] claimed that brother Branham doesn't
[1:31:56] have a place in the pulpit say and I
[1:31:57] disagree
[1:31:58] brother Branham has his message has a
[1:32:00] place in this pulpit I only preach his
[1:32:03] message praise God
[1:32:04] but here's I want you to hear the
[1:32:06] literal quote from November 2015 he said
[1:32:08] let's read between the lines and I have
[1:32:10] the link here if you want listen to it
[1:32:12] it is not so today that in this message
[1:32:14] it's the same thing if you try to
[1:32:16] encourage a minister to play the tapes
[1:32:18] in their church you are so misunderstood
[1:32:20] brother Branham doesn't have a pulpit he
[1:32:22] doesn't have a place he's not welcome no
[1:32:24] more we need a they say we need a live
[1:32:26] ministry and this brother says the tapes
[1:32:29] is the lightest ministry there is so
[1:32:33] their claim is that playing a tape is
[1:32:35] more of a live ministry than live
[1:32:36] preachers and I disagree I just humbly
[1:32:39] disagree with that brother Branham never
[1:32:41] taught that brother BAM said when I'm he
[1:32:43] never said when I'm gone you just play
[1:32:44] all the tapes because my ministry is
[1:32:46] more alive than yours
[1:32:47] he never said that so see again it's
[1:32:50] misinterpreting the word or miss
[1:32:53] misunderstanding brother Branham and the
[1:32:57] Word of God
[1:32:59] because remember now my wife was reading
[1:33:01] and shared us with me and about blew me
[1:33:03] out of my seat here look at when Moses
[1:33:05] is dying look what look what God said
[1:33:07] get the up in this mountain of Abram and
[1:33:09] see the land which I've given unto the
[1:33:11] children of Israel and when that was
[1:33:13] seen it that also shall be gathered with
[1:33:15] our people as Aaron thy brother was
[1:33:16] gathered for he rebelled against my
[1:33:18] commandment the deserts of Zin in the
[1:33:20] strife of the congregation to sanctify
[1:33:22] me at the water before their eyes that
[1:33:24] is the water of Mara ba and kadish in
[1:33:26] the wilderness of zin
[1:33:27] so remember Moses couldn't go over
[1:33:28] because he lifted up himself and Moses
[1:33:32] spake and Lord saying let the Lord the
[1:33:34] God of the spirits of all flesh what's
[1:33:36] his last prayer said a man over the
[1:33:39] congregation not that was a stone right
[1:33:44] which may go out before them which may
[1:33:46] go in before them and may lead them out
[1:33:49] and which may also bring them in that
[1:33:51] the congregation Lord be not as sheep
[1:33:53] which have no Shepherd so the tables
[1:33:56] have stone themselves the ark themselves
[1:33:58] alone was not enough they had the ark
[1:34:00] the ark was God's presence but that
[1:34:02] wasn't enough Moses said give them a man
[1:34:06] to lead them give them a living man I'm
[1:34:08] gonna die give them a living man and how
[1:34:10] we know Jesus Christ is the same
[1:34:12] yesterday today and forever we've got
[1:34:16] the Ark you know we got the word we got
[1:34:18] the Holy Ghost we've got that but God
[1:34:20] says set a man to lead them the living
[1:34:23] people need to see a living testimony
[1:34:25] hallelujah Amen exactly right
[1:34:29] God doesn't want sheep having no
[1:34:31] Shepherd you and I were sheep we've got
[1:34:33] to have a shepherd we've gotta have
[1:34:35] somebody to lead us some voice some
[1:34:36] single voice to lead the Sheep of God
[1:34:39] amongst all these wolves and he sent
[1:34:43] before him Aliza the priest and before
[1:34:44] all the congregation and give him charge
[1:34:46] of the sight of God in their sight and
[1:34:48] thou shalt put some of I honor amen
[1:34:51] but some of Moses is anointing on the
[1:34:54] next man hallelujah and that all the
[1:34:58] congregation of children Israel may be
[1:35:00] obedient so put some holy anointing on
[1:35:03] Joshua like it was on Moses so that the
[1:35:06] people will obey God's man amen
[1:35:10] that's our desire is just for God for
[1:35:12] the people
[1:35:13] to see me just I'm just God's man I just
[1:35:15] want to be God's man I just want all the
[1:35:16] people to obey or be into one thing and
[1:35:19] that's the message of the hour amen
[1:35:22] and I've seen I've seen enough
[1:35:24] supernatural to know enough that God's
[1:35:26] anointed me and give me a little bit of
[1:35:27] honor I got about this much on her
[1:35:29] brother branham he's got about I got
[1:35:32] about this much but I'll take whatever
[1:35:34] God gives now I'm happy about it like I
[1:35:36] said last week I'll just double that
[1:35:37] honor honest invest in that honor so
[1:35:39] much
[1:35:40] maybe I'll double that praise God then
[1:35:42] he can let me rule over two cities or
[1:35:44] whatever you know whatever God would
[1:35:45] have we just want to be faithful with
[1:35:47] what God's given us so that's the
[1:35:50] scripture you know you know that they
[1:35:51] did it in front of all the congregation
[1:35:52] that's why brother Brooks ordained me to
[1:35:54] be the pastor here somebody a before me
[1:35:56] who ordained me here that's that's why
[1:35:58] this is the type this is what you do and
[1:36:00] then one man moves on and he places and
[1:36:03] he places his hands on him and ordains
[1:36:06] it for the people praise God
[1:36:08] Deborah understand all right now this is
[1:36:11] of course he took okay he took Joshua
[1:36:13] ordained him I'm gonna skip past that so
[1:36:15] here's the exact quote when you shut
[1:36:16] that prophet out of the pulpit and say
[1:36:18] that's not a live ministry I've got
[1:36:19] something to tell you
[1:36:20] Dimas I mean this person name calls
[1:36:22] anyone who doesn't play tapes cause them
[1:36:25] Dimas now I'm her Dimas left Paul
[1:36:27] because he loved the present world more
[1:36:29] they loved the message of the hour see
[1:36:32] now we're getting serious here we're
[1:36:34] getting name called D misses because we
[1:36:37] don't play tapes and we have live
[1:36:39] preachers now to be fair later on the
[1:36:42] same message the the preacher says which
[1:36:47] he calls himself a preacher the preacher
[1:36:50] says you know we're not to condemn
[1:36:51] people we need to pray for people that
[1:36:52] are different than us which is good but
[1:36:55] I just I want to let you know there's
[1:36:57] name-calling going on but I'm I know I'm
[1:37:00] going to get it for that but I'm not
[1:37:01] against nothing but I'm for this word
[1:37:04] I'm poor this message I'm for this
[1:37:05] prophet in this is his pulpit his pulpit
[1:37:08] I'm glad I got a revelation that that's
[1:37:09] my revelation that's his message amen
[1:37:13] we're not a demas Church I've left all
[1:37:17] the things in the world to follow Paul's
[1:37:19] message I'm not following the things of
[1:37:22] the world I've left everything I used to
[1:37:24] be in the world I've left the world
[1:37:26] I know that I left the world I know the
[1:37:29] kind of like the devil knows the life I
[1:37:30] live amen
[1:37:32] he knows what kind of life I live all
[1:37:34] that I give to this how I love the word
[1:37:36] how I love Jesus Christ and just want to
[1:37:38] do what's right for Jesus Christ I
[1:37:39] haven't left the things of God I'm right
[1:37:42] with the things of God hey man and
[1:37:46] that's okay you know maybe I made a
[1:37:47] mistake sometime and you know maybe I
[1:37:49] named called somebody Lord forgive me I
[1:37:51] never want to couldn't I don't name call
[1:37:53] anybody so III I could offer forgiveness
[1:37:56] I can I can be kind and sweet to brother
[1:38:01] branham never said every pulpit was his
[1:38:03] if you take it the right way I'll
[1:38:05] balance it out so my dad said I'm I like
[1:38:07] this our brother Smith here I thought
[1:38:09] maybe he was speaking to me maybe he
[1:38:10] said I met him your pastor a lovely
[1:38:12] brother I don't say that because I'm
[1:38:14] standing in his pulpit but he is I hope
[1:38:18] I'm a lovely brother so maybe in here
[1:38:20] now the next one he said usually I have
[1:38:22] the courtesy not to mention doctrine in
[1:38:23] a man's pulpit see but you see brother I
[1:38:26] never said every pulpits mine I've never
[1:38:29] said when I'm gone you make every pulpit
[1:38:31] my pulpit and play tapes and nobody
[1:38:33] preaches he never said that now brother
[1:38:36] Brad let me balance it out cuz bro Ram
[1:38:37] did say every pulpit is the Evangelist
[1:38:40] but he said the world is their pulpit
[1:38:42] too so if evangelist just want to preach
[1:38:45] from here there's more to the world than
[1:38:46] just this pulpit right here how about go
[1:38:49] down in the corner and preach a little
[1:38:50] bit how about go to the park and preach
[1:38:51] a little bit how about preached by the
[1:38:53] business center down there how about
[1:38:55] preach outside of Giant Eagle so see the
[1:38:58] ax man just goes to all the world so
[1:39:00] your Pope it's the whole world yes sir
[1:39:05] 31 years I've stood behind the desk here
[1:39:07] and around the world as I have claimed
[1:39:08] the world to be my pulpit so see we
[1:39:11] gotta balance it brother man says you
[1:39:12] know I'm evangelist so the whole world
[1:39:13] is my pulpit but he was never saying
[1:39:15] well I every Pope it's mine and I'm the
[1:39:18] only one who needs to preach he never
[1:39:20] said that now look what he says in 57 he
[1:39:25] tells the church he says the foam
[1:39:27] complete authority the church is the
[1:39:28] pastor read that in the Bible see that's
[1:39:30] not the Bible order there's no one above
[1:39:32] the outer I have nothing to do with what
[1:39:35] brother Neville does here that's up to
[1:39:36] you and brother Neville
[1:39:40] so he would seal he wasn't really the
[1:39:41] pastor there because he says it's
[1:39:44] between you and the pastor even in the
[1:39:46] Branham Tabernacle because he was not
[1:39:49] the pastor he was out being evangelist
[1:39:51] so see he never exalted himself into a
[1:39:53] position that wasn't according to the
[1:39:55] word okay I hope that's I hope that's
[1:40:00] okay I hope you understand that he said
[1:40:02] now to carry on we've got to put
[1:40:04] footprints here on the sands of time
[1:40:05] that others can see if Paul had it had
[1:40:07] went on the way he did then John would
[1:40:09] have known how to follow if John hadn't
[1:40:12] followed or went on the on Polycarp when
[1:40:14] I have known out of foul
[1:40:15] if Polycarp when that went on Iranian
[1:40:17] would have known how to follow if I
[1:40:18] rainiest wouldn't have went on Martin
[1:40:20] wouldn't have known how to follow see
[1:40:21] what I mean each one has to put
[1:40:23] footprints on the sands of time so the
[1:40:26] idea that only tapes should be played
[1:40:28] from every pulpit was not what brother
[1:40:30] Branham was teaching in the sermon what
[1:40:31] house will you build me in 1965 brother
[1:40:34] Branham was not saying every pulpit was
[1:40:35] his this is out of context it's not
[1:40:37] rightly divided it's possible this
[1:40:39] family member maybe is not a faith for
[1:40:41] gifted preacher as he's name calling I
[1:40:43] don't know
[1:40:44] you know perhaps he just made a mistake
[1:40:45] but at the end of this sermon what house
[1:40:48] will you build me brother branham
[1:40:49] ordained Perry green as the pastor and
[1:40:52] then sat down and let the pastor preach
[1:40:54] and you can read it in that book I gave
[1:40:57] you actually the Prophet read it it's in
[1:40:58] there
[1:40:59] brother brother Peregrine explains the
[1:41:01] whole thing so see the current the
[1:41:04] current Brandon family is trying to say
[1:41:05] well see he know Perry green was trying
[1:41:08] to let brother ran him up there so so
[1:41:10] that that all the churches today know
[1:41:12] we're supposed to let brother Ram have
[1:41:13] this pulpit but in reality brother
[1:41:15] Branham was just here's what he was
[1:41:17] saying he said I just want to make a few
[1:41:18] announcements when brother Ham stepped
[1:41:19] up there it was just for announcements
[1:41:21] it wasn't even to preach but see they
[1:41:25] they they so misinterpret the quotes to
[1:41:27] fit their own agenda you see France I'm
[1:41:31] just gonna make a few announcements I
[1:41:32] don't want to take brother Green's time
[1:41:34] here what I thought every pulpit was his
[1:41:35] pulpit I don't want to take the pastor's
[1:41:39] time is what he's saying you see and you
[1:41:43] see how slick it is you see I I'm sorry
[1:41:45] I should say slick I want to make it
[1:41:46] sound like they're doing on purpose the
[1:41:47] pore pressures people probably are not
[1:41:49] doing on purpose they're probably just
[1:41:50] deceived
[1:41:53] yeah yeah that's right there you go it's
[1:41:55] like the sick of the devil is but I just
[1:41:59] want you to see that there it's it's
[1:42:00] it's it if you really study these things
[1:42:03] ya be real careful we got to take
[1:42:04] everything we hear back to the word now
[1:42:08] at the end of the sermon I'm not gonna
[1:42:09] I'm gonna skip that one
[1:42:10] but the end of sermon brother Peregrine
[1:42:12] says brother Ram can you ordain me and
[1:42:14] then he prays he says god bless you
[1:42:16] brother Perry carry the Word of God and
[1:42:17] brother Perry preach the message after
[1:42:19] that so see there's no hidden message in
[1:42:23] what house will you build me where
[1:42:24] brother I'm saying see I need to be back
[1:42:25] in every pulpit and every public that
[1:42:27] doesn't have in me he's not a true
[1:42:28] church he's not saying that he's
[1:42:31] actually establishing biblical apostolic
[1:42:33] authority that we already have that's
[1:42:35] what he's actually doing let me try to
[1:42:37] finish your mom I'm just going for him
[1:42:39] brother I'm never ordained brother Nevel
[1:42:41] or Peregrine to play tapes in his
[1:42:43] absence that never happened at the brown
[1:42:44] tabernacle they always had a live
[1:42:47] preacher preaching in fact brother
[1:42:49] Neville did live preaching fulfilling
[1:42:51] the dream of sister Collins who saw
[1:42:53] brother Neville serving the most
[1:42:55] delicious food that had been serving all
[1:42:56] long live preaching of the Bible
[1:42:59] revelation of the message and this is on
[1:43:01] the tape you can hear this on the tape
[1:43:04] where brother man says sister Collins
[1:43:06] dreamed a dream here at the church and
[1:43:08] there's a feeding a wedding fixing to
[1:43:10] take place aren't you glad you're a part
[1:43:11] of that wedding amen hallelujah and when
[1:43:14] she did she saw the bridegroom coming
[1:43:16] perfect but the bride wasn't very
[1:43:18] perfect yet it was the bride so now
[1:43:20] that's the church and there was like a
[1:43:21] communion a service going on like a
[1:43:23] dinner being set and it kind of got next
[1:43:25] her because that brother Neville was
[1:43:26] serving a dinner in the church but she
[1:43:29] said it was the best food she'd ever
[1:43:31] seen she was so hungry but she thought
[1:43:34] maybe that in the dream that she
[1:43:35] shouldn't he shouldn't serve it and she
[1:43:38] and brother Willer was going to go to
[1:43:39] the ranch house and eat and when they
[1:43:41] did the light on the right side went out
[1:43:43] now you know what that is my man tells
[1:43:45] us what that is now the food the bride
[1:43:47] isn't perfect but the bridegroom is
[1:43:49] perfect the bride is not perfect yet but
[1:43:52] the food that was being given was not
[1:43:54] literal food it's the spiritual food
[1:43:57] that you've been having all along amen
[1:43:59] glory so that's what's actually
[1:44:02] happening when program was out preaching
[1:44:04] brother Neville was preaching the
[1:44:05] message and
[1:44:06] God liken it unto brother Neville
[1:44:08] feeding the most delicious Starbucks and
[1:44:11] giant eagle you could ever eat that's my
[1:44:14] favorite you might be McDonald's or
[1:44:16] Wendy's but the most delicious food you
[1:44:19] could think of was the preaching of the
[1:44:21] message of brother brand and this is in
[1:44:23] 62 the seals aren't even open yet
[1:44:26] that means the glory of the Godhead and
[1:44:28] water baptism and serpent seed church
[1:44:30] ages all these revelations are delicious
[1:44:32] spiritual food amen
[1:44:34] and it's the most delicious food on the
[1:44:36] earth hallelujah and it wasn't playing a
[1:44:38] tape it was the preaching another man
[1:44:40] anointed with the same anointing as that
[1:44:43] man the same honor was upon this man and
[1:44:45] it's the greatest food they could ever
[1:44:47] eat amen but look see there's that
[1:44:50] spirit the tabernacle she was going to
[1:44:52] leave and I better go up to the ranch
[1:44:53] house to eat because as preachers
[1:44:55] serving me live preaching see on that
[1:44:58] spear hangs around you see that the
[1:45:01] spirit hangs around I'm scared of a
[1:45:03] preacher preaching me a live preacher
[1:45:05] preaching the message I better leave
[1:45:07] this church and go eat somewhere else
[1:45:08] brother Branham says no this is the food
[1:45:11] you've been receiving all along well
[1:45:15] glory to God thank you Jesus don't you
[1:45:17] love the Lord I love this message it
[1:45:21] doesn't get off the Word of God it stays
[1:45:22] in the Word of God now look how brother
[1:45:26] man so in 1965 this is August 28th
[1:45:31] brother Neville preached the morning
[1:45:32] message and brother BAM listing that
[1:45:34] mighty message this morning brother
[1:45:36] Neville brought us so brother ant would
[1:45:38] sit there and listen to brother Neville
[1:45:40] the pastor and they'd get up and say
[1:45:42] that was a mighty message he preached
[1:45:43] why'd he say sit down brother Neville
[1:45:45] play my tapes why did he say that
[1:45:47] because that's not apostolic pattern
[1:45:50] look what he said did you know brother
[1:45:52] did you know a brother Neville had a
[1:45:54] radio broadcast where he preached every
[1:45:55] Sunday did you know that
[1:45:56] I'm sorry Saturday from 9 a.m. to 9:30
[1:45:59] he preached for 30 minutes every
[1:46:01] Saturday on the radio well brother Jesse
[1:46:04] you should stay off YouTube and you
[1:46:05] should stop trying to reach in those
[1:46:06] people by preaching should I or should I
[1:46:10] keep trying to reach people look what he
[1:46:13] says
[1:46:13] thank you brother Neville is understood
[1:46:15] that the Neville trio is one of the best
[1:46:16] true is the nation's sure that's right
[1:46:18] I doubt that
[1:46:19] brother never says I doubt that brother
[1:46:21] brand the congregation laughs now how
[1:46:23] many heard the broadcast yesterday I'm
[1:46:25] an old veteran preachers over 20 years
[1:46:27] old and I've heard lots of sermons Bible
[1:46:29] I heard one of the most appropriate
[1:46:30] sermons for the day that we're living I
[1:46:33] heard it yesterday by our pastor brother
[1:46:35] Neville you who missed that you missed a
[1:46:38] great treasure that was dearly in my
[1:46:41] heart now he only had 30 minutes to
[1:46:43] preach it so he had to sing in there the
[1:46:45] trio had to sing they had to do
[1:46:46] announcements and he had to preach so it
[1:46:48] wasn't even a full thirty thirty minute
[1:46:49] sermon and he said that was a treasure
[1:46:52] for this day
[1:46:53] in 1957 now brother Neville's announced
[1:46:58] with this program on his program rather
[1:46:59] I wish that every listener would listen
[1:47:01] to that program
[1:47:03] why do you say listen just to my tapes
[1:47:05] don't listen to a live preacher don't
[1:47:06] listen to radio preaching he said no now
[1:47:09] he doesn't tell me this but I never was
[1:47:11] so blessed in listening to a program as
[1:47:13] I was last Saturday how many heard that
[1:47:14] message that was a masterpiece WL RP 9
[1:47:18] o'clock until 9:30 each Saturday morning
[1:47:20] the Neville Trio and I was speaking to
[1:47:23] the brother who takes the recordings
[1:47:25] brother Leo which is in the room and he
[1:47:26] says so carried away with it that he
[1:47:28] didn't he said say who is this preacher
[1:47:30] he was he said he has the radio hun and
[1:47:33] brother gene or some of them said his
[1:47:35] brother Neville this is his time and it
[1:47:37] really was wonderful not only that but
[1:47:39] everyone he so supported the local pass
[1:47:43] from the ministry every sermon he
[1:47:45] preached is wonderful this one in
[1:47:47] particular was a masterpiece
[1:47:49] it's delicious food isn't a church isn't
[1:47:52] the message delicious food to you don't
[1:47:55] you enjoy the food of God that he's
[1:47:56] feeding you the message the hour oh I
[1:47:59] tell you the reason I love to hear
[1:48:02] brother Neville preach not mainly
[1:48:03] because he's a good preacher but because
[1:48:05] I know that he lives what he preaches
[1:48:09] now rather you would live me a sermon
[1:48:11] than preach me one it'll be more
[1:48:13] effective brother Branham is it true
[1:48:15] that no one should preach but you mercy
[1:48:17] no every man that feels a call of God on
[1:48:20] his life getting the ministry start
[1:48:21] preaching we need them why didn't he say
[1:48:23] no you should just play tapes we need
[1:48:25] live preachers who are preaching the
[1:48:28] Word of God he says any man that's
[1:48:31] anointed all the world should preach the
[1:48:32] gospel I'm just one
[1:48:33] bable any man that Scott called of God
[1:48:36] needs to preach the gospel last one I'm
[1:48:41] trying to close your eye really I'm
[1:48:42] trying to push my 45 minutes up oh I got
[1:48:44] three more minutes okay
[1:48:45] I like wow that's I've been trying to go
[1:48:48] fast on purpose I don't hear you guys I
[1:48:50] wear myself out is this helping my God's
[1:48:53] grace you see I hear these things Church
[1:48:55] and I mean I'm in here in these the last
[1:48:56] three years I'm just kind of storing
[1:48:58] them up josè knows we've talked about it
[1:49:00] over and over again I've been storing
[1:49:01] them up on waiting for the right time to
[1:49:02] preach it but I felt like this would be
[1:49:04] a good time you know when we're all back
[1:49:05] in and we're all church family again and
[1:49:07] there's no more or just right back to
[1:49:08] our regular selves it kind of all came
[1:49:10] together so I hope this is helpful
[1:49:12] because we remember Jesus said it's
[1:49:14] gonna be so close it would deceive the
[1:49:15] very elect Evora possible now that's
[1:49:17] between that's between wise virgin and
[1:49:19] foolish virgin because the why the
[1:49:22] foolish version are gonna do try to get
[1:49:23] the oil oh we're gonna get the Holy
[1:49:26] Ghost we're here the Holy Ghost but the
[1:49:27] wise already got it
[1:49:28] amen she's already got it praising if
[1:49:31] you know got it get it now
[1:49:32] praise the Lord because they're gonna
[1:49:35] start getting in Simon sent me a video
[1:49:37] of a woman preacher in Dallas and she's
[1:49:39] she's holding up brother branham's
[1:49:42] supernatural books and telling the tent
[1:49:45] I can share the video if you want with
[1:49:46] with you and she take a whole hour to
[1:49:49] preach about the ministry brother
[1:49:50] Branham and she was saying that this
[1:49:52] ministry she said she had a dream and
[1:49:53] the Lord told her this ministry is gonna
[1:49:55] repeat itself with a double anointing
[1:49:57] and so she's praying for a church
[1:49:58] well let's receive that anointing from
[1:50:00] brother branham's ministry that foolish
[1:50:03] version is trying to get the oil so
[1:50:06] where should we be at now maybe 10 more
[1:50:09] years maybe 2030 it could be a hundred
[1:50:12] years it don't matter but the fact is
[1:50:14] they're looking at the message saying my
[1:50:15] that's a mighty move of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:16] we want that we want that we should be
[1:50:19] saying we've got it give us more of it
[1:50:20] praise God I don't have enough I wasn't
[1:50:23] Laura praise God it's the most delicious
[1:50:26] food Lord I'm not gonna complain about
[1:50:27] your table
[1:50:29] he's even brother Neville in 57 without
[1:50:31] all the seals revelations were still
[1:50:34] feeding the most delicious food could
[1:50:36] possibly eat thus water baptism and
[1:50:39] Godhead in Church ages it's so delicious
[1:50:42] hallelujah oh I think I know where I'm
[1:50:45] standing Church
[1:50:46] so this last one is again I believe Rome
[1:50:50] tape boys or the fivefold ministry head
[1:50:52] here's the quote this is from September
[1:50:54] about a year ago yeah you're going
[1:50:55] they say the message to the hour is the
[1:50:58] spirit and I agree the Holy Spirit will
[1:51:01] show us what the message is from the
[1:51:03] Bible but in the the message of the
[1:51:05] rapture BAM said the the message is the
[1:51:07] scripture that's God fulfilling right
[1:51:08] now that's the message the scripture God
[1:51:12] is fulfilling right now by the Holy
[1:51:13] Spirit is the message of the hour that's
[1:51:15] the message
[1:51:16] it is the token Rahab as a type of the
[1:51:19] bride's day in the well some tape boy
[1:51:20] slipped in there which is speaking of
[1:51:22] Jericho the two spies that went to
[1:51:24] Jericho that's what those two messengers
[1:51:26] did that's for the bride she had to show
[1:51:29] her token she said I'm a tape Church
[1:51:31] that's the token well I thought the
[1:51:36] message I thought the spear was a token
[1:51:38] but now you're making a fake Church the
[1:51:40] the token which one is it is it your
[1:51:43] tape Church or is it the Holy Spirit
[1:51:45] which one is it
[1:51:46] so now they got two tokens see but they
[1:51:48] wouldn't say that but that's what
[1:51:49] they've created I'd say it's really
[1:51:55] important to say we're a taped Church
[1:51:58] see this pressure they're putting on the
[1:52:00] people where we preach the token is the
[1:52:02] baptismal he goes you must be sealed
[1:52:04] unto the day of your Redemption not just
[1:52:06] to the next revival the day of your
[1:52:07] Redemption amen
[1:52:09] you know seal Satan out we put so much
[1:52:11] pressure on that but now they're putting
[1:52:13] pressure the token is the tape Church
[1:52:16] and I can let you listen to it I'd
[1:52:17] listen to it myself yesterday
[1:52:18] I listened to it I typed out I stopped
[1:52:20] it every ten seconds to talk about all
[1:52:21] these words for you that's how much I
[1:52:23] want you to know what they're saying
[1:52:26] this is not it's not this is not the
[1:52:28] truth of God this is their opinion but
[1:52:30] they're okay it's allowed to have your
[1:52:31] own opinion we just want to show respect
[1:52:34] and love let me say though something
[1:52:37] every church in this message wanted or
[1:52:39] not you're a tape Church if you believe
[1:52:41] this message you're a tape Church that's
[1:52:42] just the way it is we are a real Chait
[1:52:44] tape Church he also told us the way of
[1:52:48] the fivefold ministry I believe in a
[1:52:50] true fivefold ministry men he said men
[1:52:52] preach this message but they got to
[1:52:54] catch the vision that you've got to play
[1:52:56] the tapes
[1:52:58] or this this brother saying every
[1:53:00] message preacher that's still preaching
[1:53:01] hasn't caught the vision of the Holy
[1:53:03] Spirit yet that playing the tapes is the
[1:53:06] token hmm he says you've got to when you
[1:53:15] say that that's going to bring a lot of
[1:53:17] controversy and the devil's been beating
[1:53:19] me up on this
[1:53:20] he said all week why would the devil
[1:53:23] beat him up about saying that I think it
[1:53:27] was to me and just I think that was just
[1:53:28] his conscience his own conscience was
[1:53:30] beating him up because it was wrong a
[1:53:32] tape Church is not the token the baptism
[1:53:35] of the Holy Ghost is the token there's a
[1:53:40] true five in a false five fold and then
[1:53:43] this is this parts good you know this
[1:53:45] preacher went through all the false
[1:53:46] doctrine so this is why people are
[1:53:47] clinging to tape churches now because
[1:53:49] they've seen so much trash with
[1:53:51] millenniums on now polygamy Purusha
[1:53:53] seven thunders all the mistakes in the
[1:53:55] message all these things are saying now
[1:53:59] look now this is dangerous and look what
[1:54:00] it says what was the commission of the
[1:54:01] angel - brother Graham to get the people
[1:54:03] to believe you they say I believe it I
[1:54:05] don't care what's on them tapes I
[1:54:07] believe it now that is dangerous
[1:54:09] that's blind faith like that that means
[1:54:13] I'm not even gonna take it back to the
[1:54:14] Bible we've had a family leave this
[1:54:16] church because I said that I said my
[1:54:18] absolute is the Bible cuz that's her
[1:54:19] brother Bramson
[1:54:20] well the man said God's ultimate is the
[1:54:22] Bible amen
[1:54:24] God's ultimate is the Bible other words
[1:54:26] God won't do anything outside this word
[1:54:30] God what's your absolute the tapes no
[1:54:32] God would say my absolute is my word the
[1:54:35] tapes contain a lot of the words
[1:54:37] absolutes but not everything on the tape
[1:54:40] is the absolute but see this is and the
[1:54:43] people go to rejoicing shouting I
[1:54:44] deposit and just listen to clapping for
[1:54:46] a minute that time then they'll say okay
[1:54:48] sit down sit down sit down Center that's
[1:54:51] that's not my brother Anton's brother
[1:54:52] man said to take everything he said take
[1:54:54] it back to the word he said if I've got
[1:54:56] it wrong he said show me in the
[1:54:57] scripture I'm wrong you see that and
[1:54:59] this is a big movement this is huge he
[1:55:03] said I don't
[1:55:04] I understand I know now this is this
[1:55:06] part is true if God gives you a
[1:55:07] revelation if God gives you revelation
[1:55:09] you don't have to explain it understand
[1:55:10] it just believe it but that's not true
[1:55:12] for every word on programs tapes you
[1:55:15] can't say that because he was not
[1:55:16] infallible
[1:55:18] so see they encouraged blind faith
[1:55:20] because they're so scared of getting
[1:55:22] into seven thunders or so scared of
[1:55:24] getting in this or that they just
[1:55:26] encouraged blind faith then see and
[1:55:33] here's what I think they exalt brother
[1:55:34] brand they say there's no greater
[1:55:35] anointing than when it's coming from the
[1:55:36] voice of God in other words preacher sit
[1:55:39] down my brother Brandon preach there's
[1:55:41] no greater anointing than that now I'll
[1:55:42] say this brother Rams anointing was way
[1:55:45] way more than any preacher I've ever
[1:55:46] known and that's why it should be he's
[1:55:47] one of the stars in the he's one of
[1:55:49] seven stars in the hand of Jesus
[1:55:50] nobody's gonna top that anointing but
[1:55:54] just playing a tape is not guarantee the
[1:55:55] anointing even if you play a tape you've
[1:55:57] got to believe what the tape is saying
[1:55:59] praise God but God's way to raise faith
[1:56:02] is not by just a tape of playing of a
[1:56:04] dead person it's by a live preacher
[1:56:06] who's under the anointing of the Holy
[1:56:08] Spirit as a leader to the people raising
[1:56:10] their faith that's God's pattern a noise
[1:56:12] has been that pattern it'll always be
[1:56:14] God's pattern amen that's the way to do
[1:56:16] it but of course tapes can raise your
[1:56:18] faith but see how they exalt he's the
[1:56:21] only voice he's greatest anointing no
[1:56:23] greater voice yet brother Branham says
[1:56:24] the voice will be in the bride at the
[1:56:26] end time brother Brad said and look away
[1:56:29] to Jesus I may not do it but this
[1:56:31] message will introduce Jesus Christ of
[1:56:33] the world he knew he knew he's going off
[1:56:36] the scene he said I may not do it so he
[1:56:39] didn't the message are two separate
[1:56:40] things he's a man
[1:56:42] the message is God's revelation of this
[1:56:43] hour amen
[1:56:50] I'm almost done let me see just to make
[1:56:52] you see give you a comfort and let me
[1:56:53] let me put a smile on your face I only
[1:56:54] got a few more slides ago yeah maybe ten
[1:56:57] for the smile of my face - they say
[1:57:00] Joshua's fivefold ministry was his
[1:57:02] messengers the tape boys that fivefold
[1:57:04] ministry went and a woman found they
[1:57:06] found the woman that believed brother
[1:57:07] Branham never said the tape boys were
[1:57:09] the fivefold ministry in the sermon the
[1:57:10] token he did say the tape boys went out
[1:57:13] to find Rahab in the token but he never
[1:57:15] said they were the fivefold ministry
[1:57:17] I looked it up so in Joshua's day the
[1:57:21] two messengers did not replace Aaron's
[1:57:24] priesthood they wouldn't only pointed to
[1:57:27] it there was only forgiveness through
[1:57:29] the blood that that ministry offered the
[1:57:31] same today so they're they're exalting
[1:57:33] you know they're assaulting the two
[1:57:34] messengers for Rahab they're exalting
[1:57:36] them greater than the priesthood of
[1:57:38] Aaron but you can't do that
[1:57:39] the waters of separation in order for
[1:57:42] Ray had to get in the church he had to
[1:57:43] come to the waters of separation and go
[1:57:45] see the priest just like everybody else
[1:57:47] amen to see they add to the word and
[1:57:51] then see that starts breaking all the
[1:57:52] other word because they're adding their
[1:57:55] own interpretation to it well you can
[1:57:57] get Holy Ghost sealed and sanctified
[1:57:59] without a preacher just play a tape no
[1:58:01] you can't it's always through the body
[1:58:04] how did the Holy Ghost move did the Holy
[1:58:07] Ghost move by just reading the letters
[1:58:09] of Paul no Paul went and preached right
[1:58:12] Peter went and preached and the Holy
[1:58:14] Ghost fell a live preacher that's how
[1:58:17] the but that's how life moves from one
[1:58:20] living vessel to another praise God
[1:58:23] right
[1:58:24] the exact quote then they played her
[1:58:27] Rahab a tape and that's what the
[1:58:29] fivefold ministry is supposed to do
[1:58:30] don't condemn them pray for them so I
[1:58:32] like this you know he's saying don't
[1:58:33] condemn those that preaches pray for
[1:58:34] them but but then again we're called you
[1:58:37] know demons and things like that so our
[1:58:40] thing is not to call names back just to
[1:58:42] love and pray just keep loving your
[1:58:44] heart so there seems to be a great
[1:58:47] confusion about what the message is
[1:58:48] there group sees it as every word on
[1:58:50] every tape but they also claim it's the
[1:58:52] Holy Spirit it can't be both for their
[1:58:54] mistakes on the tapes as brother man
[1:58:55] often admitted and then there's only
[1:58:58] three quotes on tape services and two of
[1:59:01] them brother Ram says go to a church the
[1:59:03] third the the people had no church by
[1:59:05] them so he said okay go ahead and play a
[1:59:07] tape if you have no church around you
[1:59:10] yeah go ahead and play a tape but if you
[1:59:12] have a church around you remember
[1:59:14] brother Branham said if they only
[1:59:15] believe one thing that Jesus was divine
[1:59:17] all the rest of us wrong I'd go to that
[1:59:19] church brother and would not sit home
[1:59:21] and play tapes if they just took if the
[1:59:23] Catholic Church's believe one thing that
[1:59:26] Jesus was God I'll go to that church
[1:59:28] amen
[1:59:28] that was brother branham's example
[1:59:31] you never encouraged Oh get away from
[1:59:33] all the preachers just go to the tape
[1:59:34] service he never encouraged that he said
[1:59:38] if I can't get a hold off I'll take a
[1:59:40] slice I hope you got a whole loaf this
[1:59:42] morning I was studying like I was gonna
[1:59:45] preach a whole loaf this morning is
[1:59:48] that's what I felt and show him that I'm
[1:59:50] doing my part I'm gonna go listen
[1:59:51] worship and show him I'm doing my part I
[1:59:53] want him to know I'm alive I want
[1:59:55] everybody to know what side I'm on now
[2:00:00] this is a quote where brother I was
[2:00:01] talking about Gina Leo they moved out to
[2:00:03] Arizona and started the church and they
[2:00:05] used to make tapes program said what a
[2:00:06] greater thing God has did for them than
[2:00:08] to make tape see it takes guidance of
[2:00:10] the Holy Spirit to guide a little group
[2:00:12] to go like this this morning and keep
[2:00:13] them together in harmony unity and still
[2:00:15] clean to the message now we know they
[2:00:16] later got off the word tremendously but
[2:00:18] program was making the point it's a
[2:00:20] greater thing to Pastor a flock and
[2:00:23] guide people than it is just to make
[2:00:24] tapes it's a greater thing because
[2:00:28] barbra have said the minister has the
[2:00:30] highest office in the world there's no
[2:00:32] higher office one time I text that to
[2:00:35] somebody who's a tape person he said no
[2:00:37] you're wrong show me that quote I send
[2:00:39] the quote he said I stand corrected I
[2:00:40] said well I appreciate your humility
[2:00:43] we're not just shooting off the hip and
[2:00:45] I wonder if rogram said this this is
[2:00:47] this is what he preached and then most
[2:00:49] importantly this is what he lived this
[2:00:51] is what brother Branham lived this is
[2:00:53] the apostolic order I think this might
[2:00:56] be my last one so many people writes me
[2:00:59] questions about divorce marriage and
[2:01:00] divorce and the tangle the church I
[2:01:02] always refer them back and say ask your
[2:01:04] pastor people wrote me letters what
[2:01:07] about this what about that I refer the
[2:01:08] letter back you'll get it your see your
[2:01:11] pastor on those things because after all
[2:01:12] he's your shepherd he's the one that God
[2:01:14] sent to watch over you and we might
[2:01:17] disagree about it and then that will
[2:01:18] cause a confusion the last thing Moran
[2:01:20] wanted was confusion in the local
[2:01:22] churches so he didn't want to put his
[2:01:25] voice in there if a pastors preaching
[2:01:27] something different he wanted to all the
[2:01:29] sheep to be in one Accord he didn't want
[2:01:32] confusion amongst the people of God now
[2:01:35] I like it - I like it I'll say this I
[2:01:38] like what other preachers come in and
[2:01:40] I'm not here and then they'll preach
[2:01:41] something I like when the brothers
[2:01:42] whoever asked me about it when I'm back
[2:01:44] I like that
[2:01:45] cuz I because that means you you you
[2:01:48] really are being very respectful and you
[2:01:50] want to know what I think about that I
[2:01:51] like that because you know we might
[2:01:53] differ on little things but I like how
[2:01:55] you asked me that because we don't want
[2:01:57] any confusion we all want to be in one
[2:01:58] Accord all right so I'd rather tell your
[2:02:03] pastor to tell rather your pastor tell
[2:02:05] you about marriage and divorce he's
[2:02:07] God's servant to and he's equipped to do
[2:02:09] that I think I got a couple more
[2:02:12] now remember Brown did not consider
[2:02:14] himself the past of every believer I
[2:02:16] know it's been long hot no member cuz he
[2:02:18] says this he says I won't always be your
[2:02:20] pastor in future home of the heavenly
[2:02:22] bridegroom and earthly bride allow those
[2:02:25] you know all these people in
[2:02:26] Jeffersonville they say brother Branham
[2:02:27] is their pastor he can't be because he's
[2:02:30] not living you have to be living to be a
[2:02:33] pastor now you'll keep that if your
[2:02:35] that's your office yeah you'll keep that
[2:02:36] forever you know Samuel say to prophet
[2:02:38] but a dead man can't be your pastor so
[2:02:40] have you a living pastor someone who can
[2:02:42] watch over your soul
[2:02:46] remember the Good Samaritan that found
[2:02:48] the man wounded he brought him into the
[2:02:49] end that's the church so this is the
[2:02:52] hospital of sin or Fe and gave the man
[2:02:54] their two pence and told him if he
[2:02:56] needed any more he'd pay him when he
[2:02:58] come so the pastors got two pence he's
[2:03:01] able to doctor up if he's a man of God
[2:03:04] if he's a man of God that stands on the
[2:03:07] Word of God he's got what God give him
[2:03:09] the spirit and the word hallelujah is
[2:03:12] that right how is it were to worship in
[2:03:15] spirit and in truth and the word is the
[2:03:17] truth is that right
[2:03:18] so do we come to church to be doctored
[2:03:20] that's how we should come so Malachi
[2:03:22] when you're ready just come to the piano
[2:03:23] here I believe that is alasc
[2:03:24] yep that's the last one I just had to
[2:03:27] get this off my heart was it a blessing
[2:03:29] Church are you understand and this as I
[2:03:31] said this is not to attack anybody I'm
[2:03:33] not gonna miss I'm not gonna name call
[2:03:34] anybody
[2:03:35] but I am gonna call out the effects of
[2:03:37] what these false doctrines do they're
[2:03:40] gonna cause confusion chaos eventually
[2:03:43] something's gonna come up because
[2:03:45] they're breaking the Word of God either
[2:03:46] exalting brother Branham too high like I
[2:03:48] said breaking the word something has to
[2:03:51] happen there has to be a there's a
[2:03:53] sowing of a bad seed there has to be a
[2:03:55] reaping somewhere and we've seen it with
[2:03:57] all the other moves
[2:03:59] something's gonna happen I don't know
[2:04:01] but you just gotta give it time
[2:04:03] he's got to pray with love in our hearts
[2:04:05] so I hope this was a blessing by the
[2:04:07] grace of God this is why I so have a
[2:04:09] burden for the local church his brother
[2:04:11] Brandon had such a burden for the local
[2:04:13] church hey man
[2:04:14] because he was a true prophet he was a
[2:04:16] Bible prophet
[2:04:18] praise the Lord well I hope this takes
[2:04:20] away any confusion ready any anything
[2:04:22] any misunderstandings about anything I
[2:04:25] just want to be clear with what brother
[2:04:26] BAM taught here let's just bow our heads
[2:04:28] here Heavenly Father thank you for your
[2:04:34] grace oh I've gone a little over it's
[2:04:35] already one o'clock for each hour and a
[2:04:37] half thank you Lord for your mercy Lord
[2:04:42] God
[2:04:43] your word promises and if the true
[2:04:47] fivefold ministry preaches they will not
[2:04:49] fail they'll be overcomers and all seven
[2:04:54] of those blessings will occur Lord
[2:04:57] that's my prayer for this church I just
[2:04:58] wanted them to see we have nothing to
[2:05:01] worry about we should be swayed by other
[2:05:02] voices and other movements we should
[2:05:06] look for a bonfire movement of the Holy
[2:05:09] Ghost in our home church hey Laurie a
[2:05:13] revival after revival going on in our
[2:05:16] church how do I know you Jesus father
