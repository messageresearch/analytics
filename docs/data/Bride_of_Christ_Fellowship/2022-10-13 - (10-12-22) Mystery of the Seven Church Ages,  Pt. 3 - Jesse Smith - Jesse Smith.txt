========================================

I think I'll just continue on the series then and you know Lord willing uh Sunday out I've been doing a little bit of teaching here I'll try to maybe get back to some preaching and I've got some different thoughts and you know kind of raised our faith I'd like to get back to like I said miracles and you know just go through those and they always seem to raise my faith and we'll just kind of see how the Lord directs by the grace of the Lord Revelation 1 verse 20. it's our continue on part three on the mystery of the seven Church ages by God's grace it's a great lesson especially for our young ones you know I think you know one of the greatest studies I ever did was on the seven Church ages and then on the Seven Seals and it has it has formed and shaped my Christian Life because when all these false teachers come around and say oh the church age is wrong the Seven Seals that's actually what I go back to as just a confirmation I was right brother Rand was right because his teaching was straight from the scripture agree with history so this is the foundation so I'm so thankful our young ones also Austin Alina you know can hear these messages and I just I'm very thankful for them and I'm sure they're good Refreshments for our Saints who've been on the uh the battlefield for many years by God's grace I know it's a blessing to me as well so praise God of course you know the message is under attack but we're defending it by God's grace amen so Revelation 1 verse 20. Revelation 1 verse 20. it's been a wonderful week as well you know the Lord has poured out a couple blessings you know I was I was praying for a little bit of um you know help you know and two individuals in particular from different states you know sent some help for our church so it was a real blessing you know so we can help out you know our Saints and then uh just you know small little love offerings but it's a great blessing and so uh I almost started crying when I opened those kind of letters I'm like I just prayed for this you know like it's just God's grace to me so just reminds me how much he loves me praise God and how much he loves you too because I'm no bit I'm no different than you that's not what I mean I just meant I know I had individual prayers in God uh you know answered so if those two are listening you know God bless those two sisters um just for their kindness and generosity to help out the Saints by God's grace so let's read this here tonight uh on three if we can one two three The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou saws in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou saws are the seven churches let's have one more word of prayer we're just so happy to be here tonight father God thank you for being Our Shepherd Lord God and truly Lord that song it catches something that we all desire we desire to be after your heart we know though or that means your perfect will for Lord we know our will Lord our human will it might have something mixed up Lord and it might have some some human will in it but Lord if we accept your perfect will then we know lord it's not a mixture of our desires but Lord It's a Divine surrender Lord to your will so father that's our desire let us be after your heart tonight here Lord God and Lord I know Lord I preach long enough to know Lord I'm not in control of this service Lord and I need you to come Lord God and just guide us as the people pull Lord just guide this service Lord Jesus and and just or speak to each and every heart may be in a a good refresher for some maybe a brand new topic for definitely The Young Ones Lord God and Father I just pray God take control of this service Lord we're after your heart we're after your leadership in our lives Lord God your anointing father God hallelujah hallelujah anoint us God For Your Glory here tonight I want to thank you God that you hear our prayers Lord thank you for the two reminders to me that you hear my prayers Lord even when I lay here and or I feel like I'm defeated or I'm struggling or I feel like sometimes you're not you don't hear me Lord and then these things happen so I thank you God that you care Lord God and Lord help me to always remember to cast my cares upon you first because you care for me Lord God Like a Shepherd cares for a sheep Lord God so feed us here tonight almighty God in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God yeah like I said I was hoping we'd had you know a visitor or something like that but uh you know a returning visitor rather and that's okay so we'll look at this thought here uh tonight how's the audio seem honey so far seem okay all right praise God we had better audio on Sunday someone thank brother bang for that he'd come in and he changed some things there so thanks to brother bang if he's listening hopefully hopefully it keeps going good by God's grace so last week we looked at uh the seven Church ages and we kind of saw let's say our Focus was the biblical evidence for the Seven Stars and the Seven golden candlesticks um especially looked at how the Angels were human preachers and how the Bible backs that up so tonight we're here by God's grace we'll look at let's look at the three applications for the seven letters so if you have your Bibles handy I might call and somebody to read if you look ready or look like you're turning your Bible I might call you to read it no pressure I don't want to pressure anybody to read except my own children I am going to pressure them praise God because they need some pressure in their lives I'm sure uh but anyways let's look at three applications you know um one of the great mysteries about this topic the seven uh letters is does it apply prophetically or is it was were these letters just to seven Gentile churches around 80 95 or 80 100 we know the Revelation uh was that there's three applications they apply uh to that those individual seven churches literally and then they apply prophetically to the seven Church ages and they also apply individually to your life okay so we'll look we'll look at these hopefully here tonight uh and hope it'll be a blessing you know I was kind of preparing just you know trying to prepare my heart and I was just listening to this chapter while I was driving to work and driving home and I was just like wow God really uh anointed me to write a book because I don't feel like I could do that right now you know and so whenever God calls you to do something you look back later and said it was God's spirit that led me to do that to think that I would uh if I right now would say okay I'm going to write a 832 page book right now I don't think I could do that right now and whatever God has called you to do you know um it takes the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God so I thank the Lord you know that he anoints us and it's his strength praise God not my strength and not your strength it's his strength praise God Amen that gets us to do God's will praise God is God it is Christ in us hallelujah always causing us to Triumph amen now let's look here these seven letters literally apply to the Christians around 80 95. okay and there are uh scripture confirms this because both the Ephesus the cities of Ephesus and laodicea had established churches okay so um Ephesians 1 verse one I'll probably be flipping through here and then Colossians 2 verse 1. and then Colossians 4 13-16 it's clear from the Bible that these churches were established right so Ephesians 1 verse 1 says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus of course Paul wrote this around 64 A.D Paul wrote this letter so this church was still there about 35 years later it was still there and so the Holy Spirit bless you brother uh told told John right or Jesus told John write a letter and send it to the church at Ephesus so it's still there praise God Colossians 2 verse 1. you can see how there was uh scriptural support that these churches were still in existence Colossians 2 verse 1. for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh so here's a scripture again where Paul says there is a church in laodicea praise God and he has great Conflict for them so he has a great burden for them that's how we should feel about the Saints in our church that's how we should feel about the churches around us we should have a great conflict we should have a great love for them praise God we should love all the churches around us praise God in Colossians 4 13. through 16. this is a for I bear him record that he hath a great Zeal for you and them that are in laodice there's another record there's a church in laodicea and then in hieropolis Luke the Beloved Physician and Demus greach you salute the brother and which are in laodicea and nymphis and the church which is in his house isn't that something Church as long as people are gathering in a house the Holy Spirit recognized there's a church in that City isn't that beautiful Church never have a complex we have to have some big building or some big denomination or some big structure God is not looking at that God's looking at the quality of the worship praise God he's not looking at the quantity Hallelujah that's why you know really our church probably started around uh 2003 when Tim Meyer started these uh College meetings on Saturday nights that's really when there was a church in Akron praise God and so here we are you know all these years later and now we got actually you're renting a little space but God recognizes wherever two or three are gathered and where there's a people that are called out for Jesus Christ there's a church right there praise God beautiful beautiful thought there from Paul a small Humble Church in a house so think about that the churches you know the churches in China that are getting persecuted the churches in Saudi Arabia that are being persecuted or Kenya wherever they are those small little churches wherever they are the holy spirit's right there and dealing with them praise God and he's he's guiding their Pastor every Wednesday and every Sunday to preach the word of God Amen just like here praise God no different The Same Spirit giving them the same Revelation through the word of God hallelujah Faithfully uh feeding the sheep and we encountered a privilege tonight that we can come feed on the word of God tonight hallelujah it's a real privilege that we can gather around because those were individual cities with individual churches and Jesus Through Paul recognized them that they were genuine churches even as small as house churches praise God also the Church of laodicea was still there in the 4th Century which was over 200 years after the Book of Revelation was finished there was still a church in laodicea so all the history Bears record that these letters did apply to those local churches right and of course Jesus letters he he complimented some of the churches and then some of them he he rebuked praise God the seven churches says we'll get to those here down through history by God's grace now what's what's what's what struck me as amazing was when I was writing this book uh John's letters actually seemed to be the final call to some of these churches because remember all the Asian churches which were turkey churches uh churches churches in turkey at that time have rejected Paul by the end of his ministry which was 8067. so uh if you can pull that up second Timothy 1 verse 15 occasion and thanks for doing that with uh uh Jen on your lap there I appreciate that that can't be easy second Timothy uh one verse 15. this thou knowest that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me of whom are Phi jealous and homogeneous now of course this is hyperbole not every single person in Asia had turned for Paul because Paul still had friends in Asia like onesimus right and some of these saints that we've heard about you know through the book of Colossians but he he gives this idea the churches are quickly falling away from me and so Jesus had John write this letter 35 years later kind of like a final call send this letter out to the the Ephesus Church the Samaritan Church the pergamos the fire tier in church send these out as kind of like a final call uh to see if they'll repent because remember Jesus tells every Church age you've got to repent he tells everyone you've got to be an overcomer praise God I'm looking for Overcomers amen he's still looking for Overcomers today praise God that's the main call if you could summarize it what does Jesus want you to do overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony praise God so this is like Jesus's final call to many of these and notice that was 35 years that's almost a generation almost a generation so from the time Paul goes off the scene one more generation passes and Jesus sends a final letter right through John he sends a final letter to each of the seven churches and they have one more chance to repent isn't God gracious Church that even after 40 years or 50 years God will still cause a man to repent and get his heart right with God Amen kind of like God sent us to Kathy subic's mom there we got the baptizer she was 89 years old carried down to the water just months before she would die God Richard Mercy imagine decade after decade you know the thing about that the teens the 20s the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s but then the 80s she gets a chance to hear the message and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ months before she dies amen that's Mercy hallelujah amen thank God Amen Jesus is full of Second Chances amen hallelujah for many many chances so Jesus gives these churches these seven churches one more chance to repent after they'd already heard Paul's gospel amen beautiful thought there so see they literally applied because they were literal churches there and they got literal letters from Paul they got literal letters from John and of course the later see in church lasted a lot longer of course they probably back said uh now let's see how they're prophetic so if you got your Bible uh Revelation 1 verse 3. I guess these were just kind of foundational here Revelation 1 verse 3 blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy so we know this is a book of Prophecy it's foretelling events are going to happen over the next 2000 years so we see that in verse 3 verse 19 repeats it says write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter it is undeniable this is a prophetic book Hallelujah so John was addressing the current spiritual conditions of those seven churches in his lifetime yet he was foretelling future conditions Hallelujah now let me give you three examples one of them this uh you may not be familiar with but I'm going to give there's three clear-cut examples it's undeniable that these seven letters in Revelation uh prophesied of future events okay the first was Jesus warned the church in Smyrna that have tribulation 10 days but must be faithful unto death and that was in Revelation 2 verse 10. so you pull that up there hon so Jesus tells the Church of Smyrna you be faithful to death in other words you're going to die you are going to die for your faith but be faithful and and know that you're going to give your life as a testimony for Christ amen fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer now look he's telling them you are going to suffer but don't fear the suffering praise God don't fear I'm letting you know and this was what this was 200 years in advance I'm letting the future Generations know you're going to suffer some of you are going to get cast into prison you're going to be tried and you should have tribulation 10 days be faithful unto death not until right but unto death praise God in other words accept that God wants you to die as a martyr except that this is your testimony you get the martyrs Crown amen brother said you get a crown for a martyr or crown for daily striving either one you get a crown eternal life there's a Martyrs crowd and there's a crown for daily striving in other words daily overcoming amen like like what you've got to do praise God daily getting the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ now give thee a Crown of Life brother Adam says that's a martyr's crown praise God now I don't uh I'm not sure how familiar we are with this one but uh go to numbers 14 34. honey if you would one day can symbolize a year in the scripture now okay why don't you read that one can you read that before go ahead amen so Israel got 40 years for each of those 40 days okay so the the punishment was for each day one year so a day can represent a year Ezekiel 4 verse 5 and 6. Lydia why don't you read that when you get a chance Ezekiel 4 5 and 6. so we have numerous Witnesses one day can symbolize a year where I've laid upon you the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days 390 days so shut up bear the iniquity of the House of Israel a one that has to accomplish them lie again on my right side and thou shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah 40 days I've pointed thee each day for a year all right great job thank you each day for year so I'm also remembering uh yeah okay no that's that was times that's a different one I was thinking of Revelation 12 but it said time times and half a time that was time not the word day but thank you I appreciate that now Jesus said I'm giving you a warning of 10 days now there's one of two applications for this literally by History either it was the ten persecutions on the on the anti-nician church that means the church before the Nicene Council which was around 325 A.D with Constantine or it was diocletian's 10-year persecution okay so beginning with Nero the Roman Emperor and ending with Diocletian there were 10 major persecutions from 64 A.D to 303 A.D okay so that's what that was it was either that one the 10 major persecutions from 64 to 303 or uh Jesus was warning them of a decade-long or 10-day decade-long Christian persecution by the Roman emperor Diocletian from 303 to 313. and then Constantine actually was credited with bringing an end to this madness which that's why there's some confusion was he good or bad well he was likely bad but are we glad the persecution ended yes now let me read a little bit about this about how he brought this uh on Diocletian here this 10-year period was Rome's longest and bloodiest persecution of Christians Christians were hunted strips of their rights brutalized and killed uh it was believed uh he uh Diocletian was upset because Christianity was monotheism and not polytheism so that went against all the Christian all the Roman uh religions and holidays right Christianity was considered to be a strange foreign cop that destabilized the Empire so for the sake of unity he tried to get all the Romans sharing a common face so he thought death was the best way to do that kill off anyone who descends and then he and he thought also if Christianity was officially tolerated the Wrath of the Roman gods would be stirred up okay so here's how he did it um beginning February 23rd 303 the first order he gave was destroying the newly built church and its library of sacred writings in one of the cities in Asia Minor after that attack he issued the first of four edicts denying Christian Believers their rights including their right to assemble for worship so first he attacks churches by destroying them and then he says you can't gather anymore sound familiar like the squeeze right we've heard brother Adam say brother said the the uh this one world government is going to shut down your churches so we can't worship anymore he said one day they'll shut them down they'll boycott real churches now unless you take the unless you agree to to to be a part of that right now the mark won't come down but they'll they'll agree to become a part of it before the Mark is laid down the churches will so he destroys churches and then he uh takes the next step my you cannot worship and then after that you can't worship now you're ordered you must participate in sacrificial rights to Rome's pagan gods he's going to make sure you go to their religious festivals if you aren't there uh you can expect torture or death can you imagine that torture death so there were gonna there was going to be a head count at their Pagan Festival so they had some really awful Wicked festivals with all kinds of wicked acts and if you don't show up to that they're going to hunt you down and kill you you got no church to go to they're burnt down in their clothes are locked up and now you've got to physically go out and worship with them at these uh Wicked uh festivals now two years later it says uh I'm sorry here now let me get back to this here yeah I'm not going to read that part but anyways the next 10 years are filled with all the worst forms of death I think I'll just stop it right there but you can see how the government issued it out first right they they destroy the writings they destroy the Bibles right they destroy the worship you can't worship anymore and then they start physically hunting them down all right and Jesus though by his grace warned them and said don't fear that now my if you think uh if you if we think we got something coming we can trust the Lord that the Lord will give us courage and help us to overcome fear if any of that would ever happen in our time praise God we can have courage because if they did at church and some of them didn't even have the full revelation we have in the Samaritan Church age right and if they could stand Hallelujah if they could take the anointing of God and stand and give their be faithful unto death that we can do the same praise God because we can see how the American government now of course is against conservative Christians I mean it's so obvious it's painfully obvious uh no but we know prophecy says it's going that way we don't know when but prophecy says brother Adam said thus saith the Lord he said this nation will exercise the same power that the Roman uh ancient Rome exercised with their persecutions so this diode equation type of spirit is coming back to America but we're going to be we're going to be on the other side we will not join with them we'll be on the other side many Holy Martyrs died but thanks to Jesus's warning 200 years in advance they had the attitude and they knew they must be faithful unto death and so the Bible said and the Bible records it even more the more people that died the more Christianity spread praise God Amen the more you tried to put out the fire you just fan the flames and the Flames grew hotter praise God because people would see those those uh those Martyrs they would see that and then they would they would they would Escape their homes and they would spread the faith they would they would secretly gather or they would move away and they would have this Freedom they would spread the gospel it's always Fanning the Flames Hallelujah this church cannot be stopped Hallelujah Hallelujah they've never been able to kill the Christian church and stop it it's impossible to stop and praise God the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen Hallelujah that's the first reason undeniable history that these seven letters are historic the second one Jesus foretold the open door age the uh to the Church of Philadelphia in Revelation 3 we're not going to read it but this was from 1750 to 1906. they the world saw the greatest missionary efforts through men like William Carey in India and David Livingstone in Africa Hallelujah these men Hazard their whole lives some of them learn multiple languages some of them I think if I'm not mistaken William Carey lost his wife and became a widow because of the diseases in India yet they uh he built all these schools maybe scores of schools and churches his influence is still going on today Christianity is there and the real Christians are there because of William Carey's efforts to be a missionary praise God oh think of that think of the rewards these people are going to get sacrificing their lives leaving their homes you know going off with no money just trusting God learning languages my forsaking everything and going for Christ Jesus said you'll receive a hundred fold in this world and in the world to come praise God undeniable that there was an open door and we'll get to this eventually but the open door means that no man could shut it in other words this was the age when the Pope's power was waning his power was weakening no longer were the world leaders you know obeying everything he said his power is weakening uh Napoleon Bonaparte was the uh I'm not saying I'm not sure if I'm saying that right but he was a famous one who defied the Pope and then it was just a sign it was a signal he's no longer in control but but Jesus was doing that Jesus was shutting their door Hallelujah and he was opening the door missionary work praise God hallelujah thank God Amen undeniable those are two historical events the third one the final one is the lukewarm condition of the final Church of laodicea which represents today's churches falling away from the faith putting Jesus's Spirit outside their churches praise God remember brother Simon was here and he was showing he was showing some history about how this has to be the laodicean church age because of all the advances in science right all these advances all these blessings and yet people do not grow closer to God you would think with all these blessings like a washing machine with fast food places right you don't you don't have to be a farmer not everybody has to be a farmer with all these benefits of living in this age running water you don't have to have to go out to the outhouse Hallelujah in the middle of winter can you imagine that guy's walking out there to use the restroom in the middle of the night in the wintertime snowstorm with all these blessings all the rich and increases good you would think people want more of God but it's actually produced the opposite effect in most people now in us it's produced a Hunger for More Of God Amen because we see it's it's blessings but it just doesn't bring fulfillment it doesn't bring life it just brings uh more longer natural life but we still see the Holy Spirit uh moving amongst us and we desire more spiritual life praise God we realize there's more to life than clothes there's more to life than natural blessings the real life is Faith in Jesus Christ Our Lord amen but Simon proved I can't remember the actual fact but he listed a beautiful fact about the Industrial Revolution and how it it totally changed life for everyone oh yeah it was the uh it was the uh age span I think before that it was like 30 or 40 years your lifespan was estimated think about that I'd already be dead if it wasn't the Industrial Revolution I'd already probably have uh you know diseases and die but once Industrial Revolution it turned the age to 75 or was it 80. I mean you would think with all these outstanding blessings Richard increased with Goods that more people would be interested in serving God but it has the opposite effect when people love the God of this world more than the god of Heaven ah but thank God the god of Heaven he didn't stay in heaven his spirit is there yes but he come to live in your soul praise God the god of Heaven come down to earth amen to live in a tabernacle of Flesh hallelujah oh my thank you Jesus Hallelujah so it's clear we're in the laodicean church age Jesus spirit is outside the majority of churches they no longer speak for him because they're speaking for lgbqt rights and all these things they're speaking for rights of Sinners rather than the the truth of the word of God they're not speaking for Jesus Anymore for if you speak for Jesus you'll say what the holy spirit says amen now again remember this laodicean condition prompted Jesus to say in Luke 18 verse 8 can you pull it up there look at the words of Jesus we ought to be encouraged that we find Faith among each other because Jesus says when I return will I even find faith on the Earth that's what I like hearing your testimonies you keep sharing your testimonies Church you keep sharing them by God's grace I don't know if we'll have time for sister who is on Sunday or not you know but that's uh I just got more emails about that this week thank you for Austin and Naomi's testimonies I got those emails this week people just thanking me for those uh it's such an encouragement they needed to hear that praise God Jesus says when I come will I find faith on the earth or will it be a lukewarm condition where I spew the churches out of my mouth and they're not even talking for me they're not even speaking Faith oh my but if the word of God is in you it will speak Faith praise God because when you hear the word it puts faith in your heart praise God and the word of God is not you even in your mouth Hallelujah amen so there's three clear-cut undeniable examples now are there more yes there are more that's what the rest of the chapter is about because I go through each Church age and I show all the historical events but not all of them but as many as I could find that validate Jesus was Pro Prof I'm sorry prophesying to the next two thousand years all right now now this one's good for us here let's see how the seven letters speak prophetically to us today they speak prophetically to us okay so the first example is a Revelation 2 4. I mentioned this briefly on Sunday but I didn't get to it every honest Christian knows and if you're honest tonight you might whisper an amen or you just might say ouch or you might shout amen but every honest Christian knows you know what it's like to lose to leave your first love that first feeling that first I can still remember wow I feel like my eyes were like this big when I heard serpent seed you know wow we stayed up till 12. listen to a two-hour long sermon you know about Serpentine I didn't have any trouble with that it was just I wasn't going to sleep I was Wide Awake My Soul my heart my eye my mind was just blown away and all I want to do after that is listen to sermons praise God different than denominational thinking right Jesus said as many as I I'm sorry nevertheless I have this against thee you've left your first love so see these letters also speak to every individual so not just those churches you know 2000 years ago and not just prophetically but they also speak to you and I oh I love it a threefold three three is perfection Hallelujah there it is amen I was waiting for that one I just seen it right now Perfection God is always perfected in threes amen so you can see how this this these letters are perfect amen they speak to the individual they speak prophetically to the age and they spoke to those individual churches in other words you can't limit God God's word is eternal amen his ways are past finding out Hallelujah amen and the Beautiful part is the next verse Jesus tells you how to return to your first love do your first works so in other words you change some habits you're no longer doing the same things you used to do when you first started serving God and that applies to brother Jesse as well applies to all of us and it shows Church Jesus can have something against us right when we leave our first love when we don't make the word of God or worship or the house of God when we don't make it the best part of our day or the best part of our life we actually leave behind and we actually leave that love behind and we're actually loving something else and now Jesus has has something against us can I say like this the Bible calls it a grievance because you've grieved the Holy Spirit or I've grieved the Holy Spirit now we don't want to let's make this grieving as short as possible praise God Hallelujah but the Bible said grieve not offend not so Jesus gets offended at times when we backslide in our minds I'll say like that and this is a help this is prophetic this lets us know that Jesus knows wherever we are in our journey with him he knows right where we are and he wants us to return and he wants us to get back and he wants us to get our first love back he wants us to love him praise God and your life will never be what it should be until you do love him with all you have I got a text from South Africa yesterday and I couldn't reply but the brother watched my report uh overcoming porn video he's like this was a blessing I've struggled this for years I'm not married and that's the trouble I can't afford a wife and all these things he said well God forgive me he says and can you explain this through the Bible how can God forgive somebody who constantly follows in something like this I said well I don't know I can't say for sure but the Bible said lot vexed his soul by the things he saw and heard yet he was a righteous man now I'm not I'm not saying it's okay to do this I don't even know what he's doing but he just use that word pornography I don't know I'm just saying there can be a real Christian who can have a real problem and if he or she doesn't watch their eyes the gates to their soul think about that the gates of the Soul and they don't stop Evil coming in there the only effect is that they live in torment I said you become uh you become a slave to it you become it's a stronghold as the Bible says it's a complex I said it's just like the house Jesus said if you let that porn in and those devils are going to come in they're going to tie up all your faith all your joy all your love all your victory now you're still you still want to serve God but you can't until you let Jesus in and he kicks all those Devils out praise God Hallelujah is that right amen and I said yes God can forgive you and I said the real thing is to pray until you hate that sin because once you hate it brother you ain't going back to it praise God Hallelujah that's the reality of it that's 30 minutes okay so in every in every complex I've had that's what I've had to pray I'm sure you as well you know it's wrong I know it's wrong but we still do it sometimes so our prayer if we can't get Victory our prayer has to be Lord help me to hate this sin because when you hate something you will not let it hang around I hate the smell of skunks right I ain't gonna let that hang around I hate when uh what's that one book I hate when stink bugs get in the house I can let them hang around you think I'm gonna let something uh that I hate hang around or how about dirty diapers you know Zion was having diapers you know you think we're gonna let something we hate if we hate that church we're going to do something about it praise God oh it's a it's a righteous Indian Nation it's a holy hatred praise God and it's a love for Holiness praise God so that's been that's what I found in my life when I've had complexes or battles or strongholds I've had to pray even through you know days and weeks Lord help me to hate this and once I hate this I know I'll get the victory praise God and that's what I found praise God that's what I'm trusting this brother will find as well again I'm not I'm not saying it's ever right to sin it's never right to sin and I don't know if the brother saved or not but I'm just saying he has a desire to still serve God so there must be something real there says when you no longer have a desire he said then then you won't but as long as there's a desire to do what's right God's still working on you praise God see everybody knows what it's like to leave their first love think about how much you love your car when you first got it or your first cell phone right or your husband or wife right let's be honest right your first love right but then things come in Trials come in the tests of Life come in and what do you do you gotta labor to bring that first love back and I'm not talking about loving your phone anymore I'm talking about your spouse now because we don't want to love our phones and things like that but I'm just saying it's easy example see you think you think such good of something and then it loses its value okay now that's the one example now second one is Smyrna the one we just read Jesus says uh well I'm sorry let me pull it up it's Revelation 2 9 and 10. yeah I guess we did read this already yeah Jesus said I know your Works uh fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer and I'll give you the Crown of Life okay yeah so this one plainly tells us do not fear suffering Hallelujah so whatever God would allow you to suffer now this is a some this can be a tough one to swallow right especially if God would allow us let's say to lose a loved one thank God he spared us from that I mean real close loved ones but or how about lose ability to walk like brother Mike McCloskey think about that if you lost ability to walk would you still serve God would you suffer with all that pain would you still serve God or would you drown it away in alcohol right so see how I see on this letter it just literally can apply to the individual no matter what you'll suffer don't fear because God is greater than it praise God Jesus is greater than the suffering praise God and there's no way anybody here could suffer any more than Jesus Christ did praise God because he didn't even look like a man he called himself a worm not even not even a man and so that scripture you can see now first love and fear not suffering those can literally apply apply to you and I when we leave our first love and when we suffer it literally applies to your life the individual and we can draw strength I don't have to fear I can cast down fear I can have the spirit of power love and a sound mind praise God that's right third Holy Ghost filled Saints from all ages have benefited from laodicean's warning about lukewarmness and the church said and this warning goes to the it helps us individually because it's a warning to not let ourselves get lukewarm this kind of goes with the first loved one right kind of goes with that and to constantly strive to be on fire for Jesus's sake praise God so this scripture goes right to the heart of the believer like brother Williams talking about those prayer lines where preachers would come up and and talk to the people oh you're lukewarm and oh you know it's your fault you're lukewarming and you know whether those are right or wrong you know that's it's it's it's each situation you gotta look at it individually right if the person was really filled with the Holy Ghost or not you have to look at that individually but all of us can relate to that we feel our desire to serve God cooling down and we just got to add a nice dry log got to put a dry log in that fire and stir that fire up praise God all of us can relate to that that's why Peter and Paul both say You must stir up your minds see you've got to literally challenge your mind get your mind off the things of whatever like technology or world events I guess they could help you some spiritually but whatever is taking your mind away from God you got to uh you got to force your mind to think on the things of God and Stir It Up and mix it up praise God get it moving get your thoughts churning on the word of God you've got to do that nobody else can do that you've got to Stir It Up praise God or else you're going to become lukewarm Stir It Up syrup means to Kindle up inflame one's mind in the Greek okay so pull up second Timothy 1 6. and then we'll go to Second Peter 1 13. the both both these men of God both these prophets now Paul was the major one both these prophets say stir up your minds by way of remembrance wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands praise God now this is a good example leave that out there this is a good example I think one time sister Naomi asked about that about having certain services for certain gifts like how brother bran would have services for healing what was he doing he was preaching on an hour or two on the same topic just a new angle he was trying to stir them up God Is A Healer God can do anything this is what a lot of preachers do today which is it's encouraging this is like preaching not really teaching it's trying to stir them up don't you know God helped Israel cross the Red Sea don't you remember how God did that right all these don't you know God was the fourth man in the fire and God will stand with you in your fire you know I mean just these these type of these type of sermons stir you up help you remember that God is faithful God is good and just you've got to stir up there's a gift of God in you there's something in you that believes for Divine Healing amen there's something in you that believes in prophecies like your dream you had this week brother that was prophetic maybe you can share a testimony sometime with the Saints he had a dream and then it actually literally come to pass exactly the way it was Hallelujah Glory and so you got to stir that up in other words God just move me give me a prophecy or give me a dream or or or give me a word of wisdom give me you know God wants you to do that God wants you to draw close the member of the Bible said covet the best gifts amen amen hallelujah God that's the way to get back on fire say God I need a miracle amen hallelujah I need something I need a touch I need something special I need you to move I don't want to be lukewarm I want to be on fire amen moving some new logs praise God move them back get the fire burning get it hot praise God stir your mind up don't remain feeling this way get on fire for God oh hallelujah praise God and for me that's usually the morning that's when I can get stir up my fire praise God I get that time with the Lord the prayer the Bible study the scriptures the meditation that's a great time to stir up your mind for the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah uh II Peter 1 13. honey would you get that second Peter 1 13. yeah I think it me as long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance what Jesus say to get your first love remember repent return right very it just goes right along with it second Peter 3 verse one honey chapter 3 verse one see how these can apply literally to our lives it's so beautiful this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of uh by way of remembrance now we get a little clue in here if our minds got are going to be stirred up they got to be pure first God can't stir up an impure mind is that right the mind of thinking has to be pure and how does it happen by the transformation of the renewing of your mind amen Hallelujah so there's three ways I just gave you three ways these and of course there's many more these letters apply literally to the individual how many appreciate that by God's grace you can just see it plainly anyone with any Christian honesty or sincerity well yeah sometimes I lead my first love I need I need to overcome fear of the sufferings I go through and I need God to help me be stirred up all the time Hallelujah thank the Lord now also I put this little uh paragraph in here churches today and all throughout the last 2000 years have gone through this Ephesus to kind of lay out to see a cycle because it's kind of like a cycle you leave your first love remember the church ages you leave your first love right uh they lose some the middle of the churches they lose some Revelation and then God brings restoring it back it's kind of like the seasons right it's like the seasons uh maybe fall uh winter and then spring and summer praise God it blossoms out so we can see some Cycles in here and Ephesus really represents the best condition of a church right it has to because that's how the church started the first love praise God so in other words that's why I think brother can preached a series on that you know going back to Ephesus I thought that was a good that was years ago now I could probably find it on YouTube but maybe not but uh that's a desire we always want to go back to absence in other words we always want to go back to our first love that first love that we had that feeling we had to serve God at the beginning praise God oh yeah that's right then and laodicea would be one of the worst right uh just because of the warnings remember Jesus doesn't compliment anything in this church age he just says the ones that really love me will be zealous to repent and they can be hot there's clues in there and they will overcome but he doesn't compliment the whole age because it's just a very cold age there's very few people that really want to love Jesus Christ repent of their sins have Zeal to repent there's very few thank God I'm one of them praise God but now I got to live it I got to repent every day too amen I got to be zealous to repent if not I'm not living the uh the requirement for my church age praise God that's why I Repent every day praise God that's what I've seen created me a clean heart Hallelujah oh God and he does church he does how many can say Amen to that every day God creates in you a clean heart so this is you know the Ephesus to laodicea is a cycle of from from best to probably the worst where Jesus can't even give a compliment remember the Philadelphia Church ate Jesus it was almost all compliments you remember that there was really no rebuke in the Philadelphia Church hey John Wesley do you know he was five foot one who's five foot one in here Lydia what are you stand up 054 okay so John Wesley was the church age messenger and he was probably this tall I read that five foot one and he was stoned on numerous occasions and God would raise him up just like Saint Paul and he preached them to some days he would preach eight times in one day eight sermons you could take a seat but just okay so imagine Little John Wesley in your church Little John Wesley preaching the word of God that's God's star for this age a man full of fire he finished this sermon praise God I'm gonna go preach another down on West Market Street is that right yeah he write it get on his horse hop down there preach sermon number two for the day I think there's a court brother said he was up by six or five a.m every morning preaching because you have to preach six or seven or eight he just spent his all his time riding around preaching now there were some problems in his life he wasn't perfect there were some relationships that he had that were kind of questionable he had a wife but he was never around her then he got kind of close with some Christian sisters and so there were some questions about but as far as we know he he must live holy but there was just some questions about it so I'm just I'm just letting you know because there's you know questions about brother Graham's life he wasn't human well no kidding I'm sorry no he was human I'm sorry no kidding sorry he was human sorry no kidding which one of us aren't human and if I went through all these people's lives that are uh uh if I went through their life like they go through brother random's life what do you think I'd find in their life if I had recordings of all their thoughts and all their words in their home what do you think I'd find oh I think I'd find some Dracula I think I'd find some AC DC like they they already made it on I think I'd find a lot more than that praise God you know this week they put out uh that that attacking side put out a podcast brother William and they said there's more hope for Judas Iscariot than brother Branham can you imagine what what condition would you have to be in to say that and I'm like these guys I almost stopped it but I'm like well I'll finish listening to it what condition are these people in I'm like have you even listened to brother Graham's sermon lately and then I turned brother random on and he's pleading with the people repent like like we heard on Sunday he pleased with them for 34 minutes repent stand up get the Holy Ghost he said oh if you didn't get that time let's try it again is that a man who's trying to sell out the gospel that's a man who's trying to get the gospel into Souls hallelujah amen delusion the Bible's going to be a strong delusion and they'll call God three persons and they'll sprinkle and baptize babies that's what they talked about on the podcast it's okay to do that we shouldn't argue about that we shouldn't let that divide the Church of God I'm I'm just about going crazy you know I just like to listen to it because it makes me aware what they're saying but it also makes me more confident that what we believe is the Bible truth somebody has to receive the finished mystery of God and somebody has to finish uh the Great Commission praise God somebody's got to take it around the world and we're doing our part praise God and I got emails and text approvement amen we're changing the world one believer at a time in our humble little way just like other churches are it's not just us any real church is doing that they're they're preaching and their prayers are going out and it's impacting praise God it's changing lives it's spreading the truth the mystery of God is finished the Revelation is here what you need to defeat Satan is here praise God hallelujah we've been doing it now for all these years amen Hallelujah I'm a witness praise God there can be Overcomers in laodicea praise God Jesus will find faith in me all when he comes to this earth praise God he'll find it in you as well praise God a tree like I told that brother I said a tree is always known by its fruit see but if you to know the fruit you got to go hang around the tree a little bit right that's why I listen to him too brother William I like to hear the fruits I like to I like to know what fruits they're giving out saying Judas Iscariot has more chance than brother Branham these people they you know as all I can say is may God have mercy on them for they don't know what they're doing they don't know what they're saying what about all the people that got healed what about me it transformed my life I know it's right because it's the Bible you 'd be different if I preach it and it didn't happen but I appreciate and it works Hallelujah I preach it and then people get saved they get saved they get filled with the Holy Ghost praise God it has a real impact if you love Jesus and really love Jesus this word has to work praise God it has to take an effect praise God nobody can convince me otherwise I know it's right I know it's real I've seen it living I see it living today I'll continue seeing the gospel continue to live in real Believers because the Angels said go tell in this Temple all the words of this life praise God it is alive Hallelujah we used to sing that song in Sheffield it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble it was God who divides the plan that in all things like a man he will live so he could give to us the life behind the name hallelujah praise God Amen it's the life of Jesus Christ that makes a fear Devils Tremble When you pray in the name of the Lord amen Hallelujah they leave because it's the life behind the name of Jesus Christ makes the demons move it's exactly right praise God Hallelujah thank the Lord well I just thought I'd lay that in there and I like when I get a little inspiration there like that I like to like a little fire like that you know by God's grace Hallelujah Let's uh I guess we'll go a little bit further here I got a couple more minutes let me go to I'll go to eight how about I go to eight and then everybody got enough time to pray and they want to pray or need prayer afterwards we can pray and sing we're gonna get chances to sing and Worship the Lord all right now brother random told us and let's get your Bibles here and go to Hebrews 13 7-8 brother amen maybe you can read that Hebrews 13 7-8 the next section is how did Brother Ram choose the star Messengers how did he choose him he told us and I love this brother Ram didn't choose him by his desire he first found the pattern in the word of God he calls this the Keystone in the Bible I mentioned that a few weeks ago the Cornerstone of the Bible is Hebrews 13 7-8 Lord Brother can you read that for us Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever say praise the Lord Kelly praise now we always just hear verse 8. but if we we can't ignore verse seven because if you look at it in context we know Jesus is the same but what he's what is he the same about healing yes but in context context is actually about God will send a man of God to preach the word of God to help you live the Christian Life they'll speak to you the word of God follow their faith consider the end of their conduct what is the fruit of their life and I hope by God's grace you can see good fruit in my life praise God I trust you do or else you would have left already Hallelujah and this is what is the same about Jesus forever I'm always going to send one man to preach the word of God hallelujah so like he does it one man to a church right of course one man to the age and then out of that messenger comes all these other men to their individual churches praise God but this is how brother Branham chose the Seven Stars as he would read through history remember they were way different Larkin didn't even choose Messengers but brother braham's choices were way different than Charles Taze Russell if I'm not mistaken Uriah Smith I don't think he chose Messengers either no he didn't he didn't because I studied him recently I still want to make some videos on on him but I've kind of been slow on videos it's been a kind of a difficult first or last few weeks of work here we're getting some sad things happening on the in the classroom but we'll make it by God's grace thank you brother amen so brother says God and his ways are unchanging so if you know God is the same and he never changes then you you'll always be able to find all the reading history or even today you'll always be able to find who's the man of God because he'll be most like Jesus Christ he'll be most like Saint Paul praise God if you follow their faith then you'll see God work very similar in your life too praise God thank God Amen it's also Ecclesiastes 3 14 and 15. uh I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which hath Ben is now and that which is to be hath already been which is to be hath already been and God required that which is past so God requires this church to be just like the book of Acts Church right Malachi 3 Verse 6 says for I am the Lord and I change not so program chose the Stars by looking at all the history and which seeing which preacher was most like Jesus Christ which preacher was most like Saint Paul Hallelujah so God always has and always will choose one man to lead and influence the rest of the church age after God has revealed his word there's one major leader who teaches all the other local leaders uh read second okay put up second Timothy one I'm sorry II Timothy two one and two second Timothy two one and two thou thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to who Faithful Men Who Shall be able to what teach others also Paul said whatever you've seen in my life whatever you've seen that's holy or the word I taught you teach it to other men that they might be faithful with it because God's going to use them when I'm gone God's going to use them to go minister to other people praise God Hallelujah I think how many people have we ministered to through YouTube how many people have we ministered just in the local Akron Ministry member Church there was no church here before brother Tim and I got here there's no church here right the word of God wasn't here the message wasn't here but thank God Hallelujah God sent us over here and now the message has come to the city of Akron praise God the truth has come there is a lighthouse praise God there are witnesses uh real Witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the restoration of the Bride tree praise God Hallelujah in other words the the bride that she was at the beginning is the bride she'll be at the end praise God oh Hallelujah and how does he do it by one man one man to the age whether it's a hundred years 220 150 200 300 you choose one man to sound to give the main Revelation and then he teaches others and gives it out to the rest of the people and that man is the star in Jesus's nail scarred hand as I told you tonight they're not always big men brother man was a small man what was he 5'4 I think it was five five program was a short man John Wesley 5-1 these weren't like Great Men by Society they were they were they were not uh oh handsome or they're the wealthiest or anything like that they were men that had a burden for the word of God there are men that were on fire for the preaching and the healing power and the resurrection power of Jesus Christ praise God and you look at their life and line it up next to Paul line up to Jesus who is closest that has to be the messenger to the age God has always done one in the Old Testament you had Seth leading the way Cain killed Abel so God raised up a man Seth he come along he he was laboring there until Enoch came and then when Enoch left the scene God raised up and Noah praise God hallelujah God raised up but Noah a preacher of righteousness Hallelujah now though they'll call us legalists but really we're righteousness right we're not adding to the word of God we are I'm a preacher of righteousness we're Believers in righteousness Hallelujah and then Noah influenced his age right after him came Abraham Moses Joshua so many others you got David Solomon I'm sorry I'm sorry before that you had Anthony all these judges praise God uh jeffna down to Samson and then God raised up a Samuel A David a Solomon praise God all the kings praise God and the Bible said while that godly man was there they'd experienced Revival all the idols will be driven up church I believe today by God's grace we don't have to have any Idols in our life we can be free from Idols we can have one objects in Worship the Lord Jesus Christ praise God and if we got that then we've got Revival I don't care what anybody says hallelujah because there's many times to Revival praise God I've got the church age Revival the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God still going on after all these years amen still going on when the items are torn down you've got Revival sister praise God Hallelujah what'd John say dearly beloved keep yourself from idols don't let anything become more important than loving the Lord Jesus Christ don't Place anything is that deserving more of your time more of your affection more of your attention don't let anything have the place that Jesus has in your life God always has one man think of all the kings down there oh my Josiah these Kings of great revivals Uzziah at least at the beginning Hezekiah we looked at that on Sunday wasn't that beautiful on Sunday praise God not because I said it because the Bible says it he laid his request before God same thing happened in the New Testament each messenger came on the scene at the beginning of the church age with the purpose of bringing Revival to the people and then in the later Church ages Philadelphia I'm sorry Sardis Philadelphia God brings restoration to the church praise God I think I better stop right there how many love the Lord tonight praise God let's send to our feet by God's grace musicians can come I better stop right there it's almost eight o'clock here by the grace of the Lord so what does that mean Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise God Church let's make sure tonight there's no Idols in our heart let's make sure if our minds are not on fire let's stir them up tonight praise God I found just takes a little a little prayer meeting a little talk with Jesus makes everything all right that song is it's so primitive but it's so true a little talk with Jesus say Lord help me to hate this or help me to despise this like I told you one brother in the Lord told me he was about a certain sin and he said he said Lord I I feel like help us against this sin he said Lord make me so busy so I forget about it and he said his work picked up he was working so much people volunteered him for jobs he couldn't turn down and he said Thank You Lord I'm so busy now I don't have time to fall to this certain sin I thought what a beautiful prayer it's kind of like Lord test me if there's anything wrong in my life test me now you're asking for trials right he's asking for hardships he's asking for a harder life and church I think that's very commendable Lord do whatever you need to do to take sin out of my heart any Idol that I've allowed in my life break it down please don't let me bow to the idol of fame or the idol of greed or the idol of lust right all these things I I I know I know I say those every week right every week I say those fear and anger and wrath and bitterness I see him every week but it's true if we're not careful we'll bow down to bitterness we'll worship that that will become the prime motivation of our life but may the motivation of our life be the grace of Jesus Christ God's grace in our lives aren't you glad you're being a church tonight by God's grace Hallelujah you know I thought like I said I thought we'd have some visitors and maybe go over some of the foundational things but this is very important as well how many can say Amen to that these letters speak directly to our lives today we speak directly to our church the church we don't have to stay the same like I love that song he's saying brother I went down the Crimson River praise God let my burdens on the shore we can leave all our burdens here tonight by God's grace we'll have to take any burdens don't have to feel like oh I'm struggling with this we have to leave here thinking oh Jesus are you offended with me we don't have to do that we can leave here knowing Jesus and sin I'm pleased with you you stirred up your mind

gonna need a pure mind tonight church after art my struggles I need one too who doesn't you're fighting battles you're in the midst of a busy week probably or maybe you're having a peaceful week I hope you're having a peaceful week for that for that City let's have a talk with Jesus here tonight heavenly father thank you for the faithful Saints in your house tonight I thank you most though for the holy spirit that we feel here tonight Lord please don't let us remain in a condition where we're not in our first home please God let us stir up our minds by way of remembrance please Lord if there's any Idol may be torn down dear God hallelujah thank you Jesus you gave us these beautiful instructions this beautiful road map of a Christian Life verse seven letters do God can you give us
