TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this manner therefore pray ye did you notice after this manner now watch carefully and this is a good thing to write down so you can remember this Jesus did not say say these words right right he said after this manner so the Lord's Prayer what we're going to read is a model it's a uh it's a a a um almost a skeleton if you will yes for how we are to pray amen you'll notice the first thing that identifies in prayer is is the who Our Father which are in heaven not just God that's important to understand he's not just addressing God but he's saying our father amen now what this tells us is that in prayer and I'm going to say something really striking now and I want you to really think about this and and if there's a thought on it we'll we'll get into it just a little bit but you've got to understand that a person that is praying that when we talk about the Lord's Prayer not just anybody can pray it right in other words you could say the words but prayer is more than just saying the words prayer is actually entering into an atmosphere where you're talking to God God talking to you the Lord's hearing and you're listening and waiting and so forth so it's more than just uh the Catholic version of Let's just recite the Lord's Prayer if you'll notice this word father the word Father Here excuse me as he's expressed it pardon me you'll notice that it shows a relationship ship between a father and a son all right now write this down there's only one chosen place of worship in the very same token there's only one chosen place of prayer amen and God of course the Lord Jesus will respect Faith he'll respect somebody with faith in their heart but really prayer for prayer to take place it must be accomplished by those that are in this chosen place of worship amen and you look at it in the Old Testament you notice how that when the disciples were speaking about the Tabernacle and they were looking back to them days when the priests would go back into the temple he would enter and God would hear them as long as they were looking from that Temple and at that Temple it was because there was one chosen place that God would hear the worshipper and that was in this chosen Place amen the only other time that God will hear a prayer outside of being born again is if it's in Repentance and cry for mercy and that's God allowing the person to come in now God respects faith God respects prayers he hears all of that but we're talking about something deeper than oh Lord I need a new car and I need a new job and so forth like that people can pray them prayers day and night and there's tens of thousands of them daily that go up before the Lord but what we're talking about is Our Father which art in Heaven the relationship part where God reveals himself in this way of prayer because this is important for you to understand prayer is how God reveals himself to the believer this is how he shows them the secret things of the word the secret things of the Bible this is how he lets them know what he thinks about things is by the way of prayer so in other words people can pray and many people do but for example the Bible said that when a woman with with cut hair or a man with long hair in other words down past his shoulders like a woman the Bible said that it's uncom is unfit for him or her to pray in such a way in other words their prayers don't get through the roof God ain't listening to it he may hear it but he's not going to pay no attention to it or honor it because it's not coming through the chosen place of worship there's many of these prayers that will be ignored because they're not coming in the right uh Avenue of of prayer and the Avenue of worship yes now if you'll notice here Our Father which art in Heaven Our Father showing a relationship between father father and son or God and his and his creation now that's not to say that people I don't want you misunderstand it's not to say that God can't honor Faith he can but only to a point yes only to a place even Jesus said after people were healed and so forth uh be careful and serve the Lord and so because a worst thing will come on you later if you don't continue on so there might be a season in which God may hear this and hear that and honor this and honor that but in order for it to be Matthew 6 that's what I want to drive home as we get started in order for it to be Matthew 6 in this it's got to be our father a relationship between Father and Son now that's a sister too because most time Bible speaks of men not barely talks about the woman but she's included in there too sis don't feel bad about that amen now watch watch when he starts this it's a worship right off the bat the very first thing is Hallowed be thy name so once you identify the who then you can begin worshiping that who all right now l'sen close here's where it gets a little sticky for some people there are there you understand worship and prayer is something that comes together because prayer is your way of being able to show worship to God it's an Avenue of worship toward God not always with our hands raised and uh speaking in unknown languages and shouting and crying but even when we are praying according to the will of God that's a form of worship it's a form of showing God the Gratitude and showing him the honor and showing him the consideration that you respect what he thinks you respect what he feels about certain matters that's the type of worship and you'll notice when we come to him we don't come with the laundry list right hello somebody it's okay to say Amen in Bible study you won't scare me n right it's it's okay and and it's no problem at all to come to the Lord with your issues and troubles and so forth but first it must be a little worship God I thank you I love you I praise you and it's hard for people to do do such a thing number one if you don't know who you're talking about and who you're talking to and second if you don't understand you're a Christian yourself and he is your father well it's going to be hard to go on to these next parts right here you going be awfully confused so it takes an experience with God to bring them in we're going to come in just a moment back to this in Revelation 5 I'm going to tie them together for you by the help of the Lord amen you'll find that many times when I'm dealing with things that I I got one string and one string and one string there'll be 50 of them laying out yonder you'll think where in the world's he going but when we start tying them together you'll see the picture to fall together like a puzzle but we we we'll skip around just a little bit to get it all out now watch first in thy kingdom come in verse 10 thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven now I want you to think who is the chief focus of this prayer father it's the father almighty God is the focus of this prayer how opposite that is from how we do sometimes right w and Lord I and I think and I need and I feel and this happened but you understand what Jesus is doing here he's teaching us how to focus ourself so that we can get a prayer through this is one reason I'm convinced brother Jesse why a lot of people cannot hear from God when they pray because the focus was wrong when they started beauti and they can't really get their s in the right channel to be able to hear from the Lord because the focus is on them not on the word not on Christ remember this is the who first we're talking about and look it's thy kingdom thy will he said all of these things in two verses and never even mention you you're not even included in the thing in the first place right amen amen that's exactly right now if you'll notice now each prayer and I'm just touching back on Revelation 5 now you'll notice that each prayer that a person prays is actually stored up in a golden vial of odors you'll notice this we'll touch that odors in just a little bit but he said these prayers of these Saints if you look there again Revelation 5'8 the golden vials full of odors now you'll notice that is a is storing up these prayers up in heaven so it's something that if you start praying today and maybe God don't answer right at that moment well it's all right because it's being stored up waiting for the time and the season now why this is important to understand is because if you know that thy will and thy kingdom then when you pray a prayer you're not demanding God to answer it then right yes yes amen did you hear that you're waiting on God to do what needs to be done when he wants to do it so you're not demanding okay God I need a million dollars and I want it in five minutes from now you got five minutes or I'm going to go hit the lottery right that's the attitude of a lot of people when it comes to these spiritual things that's why they don't get nothing from God because they don't know how to approach the who well if he's storing it up then it's up to God then who is the storing and taking the vial and putting it up it's up to him when certain things are going to be fulfilled he told Abraham you're going to have a son 25 years later he fulfilled it well that viol laid out there for about 25 years of prayers and things they prayed oh God fulfill God fulfill God fulfill but 25 years later God pulled it off the rack poured it out on Abraham and there come is amen beautiful beautiful maybe it took him that long to get body change power I don't know maybe you had to store it up and get charged up real good like a battery being charged now let's look now Psalm 34: 15 16 and 17 now let's look and see about this who and if the god that we're praying to is really hearing what we're saying that happens to be one of the I don't want to call them complaints but anyhow they're the things that people talk about the most there's a couple things actually one of them being folks just always telling me I just don't know if God loves me the second thing is I don't know if God hears me when I pray well let's just find out what the Bible said about it and let's see exactly who he hears Remember The Who and if he's listening all right now watch now this is going to really open some things up to you the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry now watch the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth here he comes back again the righteous cry and the Lord Hearth you know he keeps saying righteous righteous righteous you understand that being in the chosen place of worship the ones God is is paying attention to is the righteous the rest of them he'll hear them if they repent he'll hear them if they ask for forgiveness he'll hear them if they ask for Mercy he might Grant little minor things that Faith May accomplish for a season but God is only listening to those that are of the righteous those that are in the chosen place of worship you couldn't have been an Israelite and say all right now I'm going to go talk to the Lord and walk over and build up a Grove in the corner and your own t and so I'm going to pray over here hears me just as good here no no no one chosen place that God heard him in that's the only place God heard him in matter of fact when Jonah is in the belly of the whale he said I'll turn myself toward the Holy Temple why because that's where God heard the prayers of the righteous folks you watch this is the reason why people saying oh you know I prayed for this and I prayed for that and it didn't happen well my question is the who are you the righteous amen cuz if you're not the righteous God has no obligation to your prayers amen yes that's a stiff one you got to absolutely swallow it down now that's a chunk of Eagle meat right there exactly right the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous his ears are open to their cries not everybody's cries God will hear anybody but you've got to come God's way remember friends I've said this over and over again right here at this little church in different parts of the country God is not at letting us pick our own way and we'll f figure it out ourselves we've got to come God's way amen that's on everything that's on salvation that's on raising our families that's on uh money that's on anything that God lays before us and that's on prayer prayer is exact we got to come God's way yes we can't pray any way we want to well Lord you said uh you know ask for others then ask for myself but I'm more important I'll ask for me first and then worry about the others well you you ain't going to get nowhere you've got to go God's way in order to get it right remember there is a law that is associated with everything in this life there's a law with it okay I'll give you an example this is matter there's a law associated with this matter it's a solid it's hard it cannot be liquid it cannot be gas because the law that's associated with this wood makes it solid matter like that the atoms and everything in it makes it like that the law associated with that light I can scream at it all I want to but unless I go flip the switch on it ain't going to come on I can step and say well I'm going to do it my way light bul you light up I'm the boss around here that light will laugh right back at you if it could talk and say no my boss is back here on the wall and that's the one that flips the switch on prayer is the exact same way a bird has a law it's the law of flight a fish has a law to swim underneath the ocean but prayer comes by a law as well David's telling us what that law is you must be of the righteous you got to be a righteous person see and his ears are open to their cry look at verse 16 but the face of the Lord is against them to do evil so is he listening if they refuse Grace and righteousness and mercy and love and Holiness and all that and they reject all of that then when they get in trouble oh God help me well it depends on whether or not they really mean business with God or not that's right amen if they just want him to get him out of trouble like an Aaron boy running an Aaron or something like that they ain't never going to get nowhere God may help him along trying to get them somewhere but we're talking about prayer y' want to Le about prayer right you want to this what it's about now Psalm 55:17 all right now watch he's talking again about a righteous person all right get ready to turn fast cuz I'm going to teach it fast all right Psalm 55:17 evening morning and at noon he shall hear my voice I think this is a good pattern for how that David would pray he prayed of an evening he prayed of a morning he prayed at noon so morning noon and night he had at least two or three spots in the day the where that he set aside to talk to the Lord now what this tells us is not that when we pray that we need to have you know a certain block of time and a certain block of time and a certain block of time for example brother Jesse being a school teacher it'd be hard for him in the afternoon uh trying to eat lunch and deal with kitties and so forth like that and then run over and have two-hour prayer meet it's almost impossible but what David is showing here is the importance of letting everything be secondary to your prayer life he's showing us how that we need to set aside time to talk to the Lord to make it an important part of our day because without prayer in our lives we'll never understand the true mysteries of God we won to understand the mysteries of oursel we won't understand the mysteries of the world of the word and all these other great things we'll never understand anything spiritual without this Avenue of prayer so David Shawn set aside some time his time was evening morning and noon now that that brings up something I'm want to hit right quickly cuz I uh the faster I teach looks like the faster the clock preaches H but when you get into the thing and you start looking at what people talk about prayer a lot of times folks get in their mind well to be really spiritual praying you've got to spend three hours laying out before the Lord well but there's nothing in the Bible that says yes the length of time whether it's long whether it's short whether it's medium every what it is there's nothing that designates even the direction of how a person supposed to I'm talking about physically the way they're supposed to pray Jesus did say I would that men would stand everywhere with their holy hands other places they knelt other places they prostrated thems on the ground but I I like what one of the commentary said here and I'll read this to you uh just just how he says it I think it's wonderful it's not he says the position of the body in prayer as much as it is the attitude of the one praying amen I think that's I think is a good way to say it so in this who of what we're talking about this who being you and this who being me then we must understand that it is the attitude of that person when they're praying brother RM said five minutes in the presence of God Moses knew more about God than all of the 40 years his mom tried to teach you so 5 minutes in the presence of the Lord could do a better thing sometimes than 40 hours of praying maybe we'd say it that way but not to say that a person shouldn't pray 40 hours but to be spiritual don't mean you have to pray 4 hours a day and 6 hours a day and things like that you take working men on their job and they 6070 hours a week they want to spend time with their families they want to come to church they got so many they got a cut the lawn they got all these other responsibilities well the Lord may show a season of Grace to men like that and they may have 20 minutes that they stand before the Lord in the morning they may have 30 minutes at night before they go to bed and let me tell you something little as much when God's in it amen amen little as much when God's in it God can take that 40 45 minutes in the day and he can make it more powerful than somebody laying on their face for 3 hours because a lot of times it's more ritual that people practice than it is the attitude of why they're doing it and let's look at it this way if a man prays 40 minutes today 40 minutes tomorrow 40 minutes the next day 40 minutes in a week's time just take 40 times seven how many minutes has he prayed look how many hours he's got in in the week's time not to mention the time in church not to mention all that so in the week he's got a couple hours or so with the Lord that he's put in and that's wonderful that's what a man wants and God can deal with him just in the right way all right Psalm 56:9 all right now watch what David said when I cry unto thee then shall my enemies turn back he said this I know for God is for me amen this is something that the Lord revealed to David in prayer I'm going to say the 21st century version God if you're righteous has got your back amen yes yes huh God has got your back the bottom line is he said when I cry or when I would pray when I would pray or cry unto the Lord hallelujah my enemies were turned back God is for me or he's got my back how did he know he've been talking to him and he knows what the Lord felt about him Psalm 57 verse two I will cry unto God most high now watch he's praying now unto God that per forth all things for me so who who is it he's talking to I will pray I will cry I will talk to the Lord God most high Psalm 86 verse3 chapter 86:3 be merciful unto me oh Lord here we go for I cry unto thee daily yes amen you understand it's important to have this daily walk with God you must have this daily walk with God you say why you're storing prayers that's right yes you're storing up prayers you're storing up blessings you're storing up great things of God for your life all right Psalm 88: 2 let my prayer come before thee and incline thine ear unto my cry now this is a wonderful thing if you'll study this for just a moment look at what he said he said let my prayer come before thee so it's almost as if the words of the man's prayer is coming before the Lord Jesus like we would take our cell phone and see a text message come before us our prayer is coming before the Lord right and let me tell you something God the Lord Jesus checks his text messages right right you never see him missing one of them amen amen that's exactly right he checks it cuz he says let my prayer come before thee just like a prophet would see a vision out in front of him it would come before his eyes very same thing here let my prayer come before thee all right what's your name buddy I'm Austin Austin nice to meet you read for me Matthew 13 verse 15-16 I'm not going to ask you all if you want to read I'm just going to make you do it about that all right Matthew 13 15 and 16 all right and sir what's your name again buddy Benjamin Ben you're a Benjamin hey good good people are Benjamin I know that I'm a Benjamin all right you get me 2 Timothy 4 3 and 4 then brother uh Jess Jesse get me James 5 and four let's catch these three verses right together all right you ready you said uh Matthew 13:15 that's exact 15 16 right for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear all right now this is an important thing because if you'll notice one of them is blind and deaf and can't hear see wow and the other one can hear and see well this is important in prayer because if God's going to talk to a man he's got to be able to hear him and he's got to be able to see him amen so part of this who is those that have the ability to hear and see beautiful they're blinding they can't see nothing God could talk to them all day long and they wouldn't get nothing if I had a somebody sitting here on the altar blind and deaf well I could stand back here and make faces out of and be silly and so they never even know what I was doing I could uh I could ring out and say all right I'm going to give you a million dollars well they wouldn't even know that I had the check in my hand because they're blind and deaf that's the way it is in prayer many of these people that are saying oh I pray Beyonce bless her heart and these people that their Grammy Awards and Country Awards and you know I want to thank the Lord Jesus my personal savior standing in a pair of booty shorts and all such nonsense that they can say that all they want to but the Bible said they're blind and deaf amen amen they can't hear the word word they can't hear what's true but he said blessed are your eyes and your ears for they hear they hear and they see well what are you listening for and when does God talk he talks when you're praying when you're studying the word in the things of God all right pick that up second Timothy did you have Benjamin had that yes yes sir all right 2 Timothy 4 3 and four if you would all right now watch this brings us in about these ears again for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust they after their own lust shall they heat to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fa now did you notice this they turn their own ears away yes wow it's not that God turns them they turn their own ears away beautiful you're right right so how can they hear if they're not willing to listen amen amen this is prayer we're talking about the who all right are these who's going to be able to hear hear anything from God absolutely not the rain can fall on them and listen to me they can shout perform miracles do all kinds of things but to be the righteous you got to be able to hear what the spirit is saying under the churches these people turn their ears from the truth well what do they do they turn their ears toward itching things smooth things tell us nice stuff and don't preach on us and don't make us feel bad and convicted and feel like we're Sinners oh you know it be a shame if we had to repent and get the Holy Ghost you know that just be terrible in a church imagine that but you understand they have itching ears they turn their own ears away from the truth so when they're praying they might be doing all the talking but they can't hear what God's saying amen right amen yes that this explains some things to you because you think to yourself well what about Mother Teresa and the pope and these guys spend these nuns spend 14 hours praying well who's doing all the talking that's exactly because according to the Bible right here if they've turned their ears away from truth God could speak right to them and they're doing all the Talking they ain't hearing nothing that's right right they're not hearing not one thing just because uh for example many years ago I was in um Oklahoma and one of the brothers there took us to u to The Prayer Tower and brother Jesse when them doors opened up you could feel the atmosphere of prayer and that stumbled me a little bit I thought well I don't understand that how could you feel such a Godly atmosphere like that and then the Lord spoke to my heart who's doing all the Talking wow I thought who's listening who's the one really hearing but ain't it ain't some of them folks sitting there disobeying the word that's right brother right and get caught up and do a lot of praying but the who said you've got to be in the chosen place of worship in order to have ears to hear that's right you got to have the Holy Ghost amen again unless they're repenting unless they're making their heart right and being obedient to the word in some way repent be baptized Jesus name or something on that order it doesn't matter if they got an ear to hear or not the Bible said they turn their ear away right they might at one time have an ear to hear here remember Cain had a full length conversation with god that's right brother right remember Genesis 4 God came down and talked to him and he talk right back to God you'll never find another scripture after that where Cain ever had another conversation that's right why he turned his ears away from God he wasn't willing to hear what was being said all right but Jesse get us James 5:4 now and let's pull out that fourth verse behold the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crith and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath okay now you'll notice now this is a different side of this coin so to speak of what we just read now those that have been wrong those have been despitefully used those have been persecuted what more now notice he said the Cry came into the ears of him who is the lord of the sa now you understand God can hear you yes and he always hears us yes but it depends whether he's going to listen or not amen yeah right right there a big difference amen you can hear something but not listen to it amen right and my daddy used to tell me all the time don't you don't you don't you don't you don't you I'd hear him but I never listen right brother right tell by some of y'all y'all know what I'm talking about back through here that's exactly right so his ears were listening and and heard all right Sam why don't you pull up First Peter chapter 3 verse 12 all right let's pull in another little thing uh we're going to go back to the Old Testament just a moment and uh our little birthday buddy back here you get judges chap 2: 18 if you will you mind reading out loud you can hand against oh yeah you tough all right 1 Peter 3 verse 12 Samantha you got it almost almost there all right now all right there we go first Peter 312 go ahead kid for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers the Lord is against them that do evil are there ears on your face your ears are part of your face your face part of your ears I've never seen a face without ears next to it right right his face is against them beautiful he's turned his ear away he's not listening unless they're willing to be what look at what he said his eyes are over the righteous you got to be in a chosen place that's right excuse the sisters I don't mean this against you Godly women but some woman stand there would cut off hair oh I talk to the Lord every day you might do it but he ain't listening that's right amen amen that's Bible absolutely not unless she's willing to come down here and say God I'm sorry that I've cut my glory off like this all these years and then Jesus will listen right amen amen amen on the other side of it you take a man long hair hanging down his back when I I think I told y all this before when I was in Jamaica the rust aarian you know the men all them dreadlocks hanging way on down the back of their head I said it's just as perverted as a woman with short hair that's right just as sinful just is wrong that's right God ain't hearing them neither oh but I talk to God you may talk to him but according to this Bible right here he listens when the righteous cry not when everybody else do amen amen oh that's a serious thing people don't look at it in this way because they think God just listens and accepts any old thing that's the reason the church accepts any old thing CU they think God does that's right right brother right are but leave different go God don't want you to come in his yard and leave the same way he want you to come in and leave different am praise the lord we got plenty of time huh in good shape all right 5 minutes raise your hand 5 minutes 5 10 15 20 25 well I got at least 45 minutes here don't I all right Judges chapter 2 now Verse 18 all right little buddy when you get ready there my friend you read it out for us lordes and out of enemies it reped Lord because of their by reason of that boy is a good reader he may have a school teacher for a daddy I think maybe all right now you watch now and look that repented the Lord because of their grow now here's what we've been talking about the last 20 minutes now if you'll notice the Lord raised them up judges watch he repented it repented the Lord because of their groanings God saw the desire of the people to be right and so God said all right in other words when he's saying it rep repented the Lord God took a step back and said all right I see the sincerity of your heart I'm going to listen to you now right right that's what it means and that that shows it can change people can change this thing all right feeling that little zing zing let's ask him to help us heavenly father as we're looking at the word of God now Lord Jesus and we've been standing here for a few minutes now reading over some of these scriptures I'm asking you great heavenly father to come down in this place now and take your word settle our minds settle our hearts Lord and let these things start taking real deep beding ground in us now father as we commit the rest of the service and out of your hands and we just thank you for it Lord Jesus SN on the atmosphere has been set now we ask it in Jesus name amen amen amen praise the Lord all right because of their groanings watch when the Lord raised them up judges see the Lord was with that judge it repented the Lord watch this hit it again because of their groanings God saw these people was in a miserable condition and had no way out right and because they could not helps they groaned unto the Lord Cried Out unto the Lord and God said all right I'll have pity on you right right that you this right here proves to you God ain't coming our way he comes his own way MH right amen amen that's exactly right yes I know it stings a little bit but it's got to the B don't make you a little sick it ain't going to do you no good that's right see watch now let's go go Matthew 6:6 you want to read do you mind reading no you you pass all right well I I got I got some of my study home do that that's all right Matthew 6 I've got a sister that she loves Three Musketeers and and if I'd give her Three Musketeers she might read but I'm fresh out tonight and then see Matthew 6 and 6 all right just catch it again uh Austin if you will read this for us but thou when thou pray us now watch what Jesus said about this we're still looking at the who for just a little bit we're going to catch at what in just a little bit amen Matthew 6 yes sir oh Matthew 6 yeah they've got it up there too I was looking to see them catch it that's you can read from your Bible up there whichever one you want but thou when thou thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father seeth in secret shall reward thee openly now that's the who yes you go into the closet you're talking to him he talks to you you shut thy door and pray to thy father and that which is done in secret that which is done in secret is then rewarded open now this tells us that prayer is not really designed to be something that takes place in a large crowd of people now we can do that that's fine but this type of prayer this type of secret prayer shows a private relationship between you and Almighty God our Father which are in heaven father and son and let us know uh that God wants it to be a private thing all right I'm going to read you a little quotation out of the message called what is a vision all right I just want to read this to you because I think it fits with what he said he sees this little room in a in a in a tent and this tent sitting up here in a little room off to the side he said the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire whiping blazing went over the audience and stood over top that little building he settled down on it and when I was standing there the same voice that Angel's voice said I'll meet you there that's the third pool nobody will know nothing about it I said I don't understand why there will it not be a public show I don't understand going into the closet like that he said is it not written by our Lord when thou prayest be not like the Hypocrites heard before men but enter to the secret closet and pray and then it's perfectly scripture every time he said he said then he understood it so then it is this private meeting place now uh another spot here at my house the prayer room is the bedroom secret place meeting place alone isolated with God so a man could go right into his bedroom shut the door behind him walk into a closet everywhere every what the secret part is he can get along with God and then the Lord will meet him in that quietness and that that Solitude which means that you can't say now Heavenly Father Hallowed be thy name hold on a second let me answer this text message right brother right right Hallowed be thy name but let me answer this Facebook post first thing get done with this Twitter then we'll start talking well that's not the idea the idea is you've got to be focused on The Who that you're talking to so the reason it is secret the reason it is private is because God oh I just love to say this he wants your full undivided attention amen amen you say why cuz he wants to talk to you that's why amen he wants to share things with you he wants to hear from you what's in your heart and he wants to tell you what's in his for the day too amen amen a wonderful thing if you look at it right that's the reason it's secret brother sister because he wants us to be able to go into it that way all right now we're not going to turn but you write it down Mark 12 38 3940 Mark 12 38 3940 38 3940 of the 12th chapter of The Book of Mark all right Jesus said Beware of the scribes who go in Long clothing they love salutations in the marketplace well hello Dr so and so and Reverend so and so they love those things and then he said they make pretense long prayers yes long prayers now this is an interesting thing I want to read you out of a place called Johnson's notes this is Johnson's notes of the New Testament it's a little commentary and I I like how he uses this he picks up Mark 12 and pulls out Beware of the scribes and he tells us like this now just listen to this way he puts this I thought this was interesting he said long flowing robes reaching to the feet similar to those worn by the romanish priest were warn by the scribes as professional attire in order to attract attention when Christ said his Apostles out to preach he told them in Mark 6:9 and Matthew 10:10 is this being recorded yes is it that well that's wonderful I I'm going to put them scriptures in I I just most time I would take maybe keep repeating there's a lot of I got to say so if it's recorded you can go back and catch it all right the scribes ancient Modern Love display they loved showing themselves off in places of concourse they loved honor and respect father Master Rabbi teacher and so forth they often possess a desire to magnify their office and the truth they want to magnify themselves they love robes that ever adverti to everyone they were separate from the rest of the people right right now you notice Jesus said don't go out there making a public show like that in other words when a man or woman is truly living where they should before the Lord they don't try to attract attention upon themselves right now you say well what does this have to do with prayer everything remember the focus of your prayer the who thy kingdom come thy will be done so if the prayer is focusing upon God and that prayer is a part of your life then your life will reflect your focus in prayer amen if your prayer is about you when you go out from prayer you'll be about you right absolutely right brother you understand it yes sir if the prayer is about God when you go out it'll be about God GL the Lord somebody whatever you are in that prayer closet is what you're going to be out before men yes sir CU that's the way they prayed long prayers well their long prayer match their long robe you understand their attitude was we're something we're better than everybody else glory to God and this and that so they prayed in a way that reflect what they thought about thems this is why when we go to the presence of the Lord we make the focus about God because the prayer is not about us it's about him right oh I just I wish we had 50 of them Manchester people sitting here right now we' done been crying and squalling about this time I know they would have oh I just miss him so bad when I get in these things like this yes sir boy we had some wonderful times I was thinking on this very study right here I I think that very night if you remember Samantha that's the Lord Jesus came in the building night at the end of the thing Lord we cried and squalled and worship for 40 minutes after the thing was over oh just wonderful I just love his word I just pray he does that right here tonight just moves right in this place and gives us such a powerful visitation of his presence that it does something that leaves something with us that just oh my just change our hearts Hallelujah watch now in St John 11: 17 the words are then Jesus came all right now that might be a short text but it's the value of the text that a person would preach and the prophet said like this sometimes we place value on Long prayers much draw out time and sometimes that's not right he said I had a friend of mine not long ago was searching upstairs in his uh in his attic and he had a trunk a little posted stamp about 1/2 in square this old posted stamp he thought well that's an old stamp he gave it to a kid and the boy went out there and got an ice cream in his mind so or had had an ice cream in his mind so he run down to the stamp collector and sold it to the stamp collector and he got enough money to get an ice cream the stamp collector saw the value out of it he made a million dollars not not the size of the thing but is the value now I want you to pay attention yes don't don't miss this there are postage stamp prayers and sometimes postage stamp prayers are necessary needful and beneficial and then there are long prayers that are even greater than that even greater than that sometimes you have posted stamp prayers little quick things in the morning some emergency come up and you say oh Jesus I'm asking you to help me this morning be with me that's a posted stamp prayer right if the value is in it and you got the value of what you're trying to accomplish meaning that you're being sincere before God Lord this is all the time I can give you I'm giving you this much time that postage St prayer well it don't mail the letter that's right yeah it'll me the letter sure will but sometimes we can't let make everything a post to S prayer now it's got to be sometimes in emergency situations you look at the value of what you're trying to accomplish more than the minutes the quantity of what you're trying to accomplish okay now in in church order we're taught this that when we're in public like this praying you ask a GU to offer a word of prayer and he say he'll pray for the mayor of the city the governor of the state the president of the Union the pastors and everybody around each one by number sister Jones in the hospital and like that walking up down the streets he said they'll start that he said and if they're dragging it out he said it's too much time see it causes people to lose interest in what's being said and what's being accomplished so this is where for example a posted stamp prayer would be beneficial so when you got the people gathered together in a church service like that and you say brother Austin come up here and lead us in a word of prayer well then you get up here heavenly father in the name of Jesus Christ and a few minutes it's over with the people are shouting and crying and moving on into the service but then if you break the flow of it and enter into a long prayer and everybody and their brothers prayed for Humpty Dumpty All the King's Men And even the king's horses and they still ain't got him put back together 40 minutes later everybody's sitting there as they say with their arms folded and they're ready to go home it's then killed the service posted stamp prayer it's the value of what's trying to be accomplished you understand amen all right now let's look now again at Revelation 58 the Saints and these prayers in these vials all right Psalm 56:8 now let's pull this one up and I I want to show you something here that the Bible said about God storing up these prayers and I want to just show you that this is scripture what we're talking about yes I'm just going to give you just one verse here and you just going to have to be satisfied with that there's a whole lot more but we ain't got enough time to get it all right Psalm 56:8 now watch here all right brother Benjamin if you will read this for us Psalm 568 if you got it in your Bible or up here whichever one you want thou tellest my wonderings put thou my tears into thy bottle and they are they not in thy book all right now watch his tears are part of his praying where did his tears come from talking to the Lord where' God put him he put him in a bottle what's he doing with them storing them up beautiful beautiful every prayer every tear every whatever it may be God storing them up do you understand there's not a tear you've ever cried that God don't already have it stored up amen amen glory he already got it stored up and it's even got it wrote in a book Glory Glory people say well I didn't hear God say nothing well maybe because he was busy writing right Hallelujah somebody maybe he was busy right maybe he couldn't answer right at that moment cuz he was busy doing all this hey you telling me all your problems I'm going to be storing them up in a bottle I'm going to be writing them down in a book I can't do two things at once amen amen all my that ought to straighten a few things out anyhow yes yes see now watch Hebrews 4 verse1 15 let's go to a New Testament example on this and pull it in all right if you will brother Jesse you read this whenever we get it up here uh Hebrews 4:15 or if you get it in your book there that'd be fine too all right for we have not in the high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin amen is't that wonderful yes he can be touched with the feeling of our infirmity so to show you that this wasn't just Old Testament what David was saying this is New Testament as well amen cuz he can feel it he can feel the infirmity so what's he doing storing it up yes storing up this is the reason why the songwriter I thought had one of the greatest inspiration out one of the songs I heard tears are a language that God can understand that's right he interprets unknown languages and tears can become an unknown language and this is what we have to understand the who the who of what we're talking about a lot of times when God don't answer us right away we get discouraged through our hand well he didn't hear me no that don't always mean he didn't hear you that just means he didn't answer right then right you ever talk to somebody and you've been talking to them for six months and they ain't never said a word back about it and then a year down the road you find out everything you've been saying to them was hitting home and they're changing their life and everything's different you thought well I didn't think that guy was even listening well he was he just didn't do much answering right praise the Lord right brother I want that to drive home because if you can understand the who God don't always answer the moment you speak but that don't mean he ain't listening amen that don't mean he ain't hearing he hears it and he listens maybe he just chose not to answer back right amen you say well that's mean well when you're God you can make the rules amen uhhuh right brother right Hallelujah thatly right Hallelujah all right and Adam Clark's commentary on this in Hebrews I like what Adam Clark says here and I I bring some of these things into these studies because I like to give you different ways of yes sir hearing it said I think it makes it plainer I really like it brother Jesse myself the way some of these men put these things they really under that man anointing boy they really had a real understanding didn't they he said to the objection of your high priest entered into the heavens that he can have no participation with you no sympathy for you because you are Out Of Reach from the feelings and the infirmities Paul then answers back to such questions we have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weakness though he be the Son of God as to his human nature and so forth he said and to his equal with his divine nature of God or with God rather he said having submitted himself to all the trials and distresses being a partaker of the human nature was in all points tempted and so forth as we were he is able to secure them so the people saying Christ Our Lord Jesus has no participation with us no sympathy for us we're out of reach of human feeling and infirmity God Is Out Of Reach from us then Paul in this verse here he challenges that idea for saying but our high priest can be touched yes for the feeling first now the King James says it we have not a high priest that stumbles some people because it sound like no high priest he's not there but what he's saying is that we do have a high priest yes yes Absolut we don't have just a high priest that you can walk over and touch on the shoulder and He Walks Behind the temple but we've got a high priest that can feel our actually infirmity now here's the beautiful part that word secure that he uses there in the Bible it means to feel the same feeling so God ain't guessing God ain't supposing God ain't surmising it seems like they're having a bad day God feels the bad day amen God experiences the bad day God feels it the same way you and I feel it all right can you pray now can you pray now yes amen if he's feeling that does that change the way you pray you better believe it does it changes everything cuz when you're looking at The Who and you understand that God feels exactly what you're going through well then you don't just walk up there and say Lord I need a new car I need a new job I need a girlfriend I need a million dollars I need some new tennis you well if you know he's feeling everything you're feeling in your heart when you pray and you're praying to him it changes everything in the way that you approach him knowing hey this guy guys is actually listening to me yes amen that's what I've said about a lot of people when it comes to God they talk about God God God God God Jesus Jesus Jes they don't even know the man right right they've never even met him never had a relationship well when you know him by relationship then when you pray brother benjam you can walk right in there God I know you hear me I know you're listening to me I know you feel my burden I don't have to say a word you already know what I'm going through and I am just going to pour my heart out to you I know you're listening you may not answer answer but I know you hear me amen hallelujah do we got to who you better believe we got to who we got it now all right now and let's pick up the what just a little bit here and go on into that all right now in Luke chapter 18 10-4 now let's pick up this what and this we're going to get into this what a little bit more about the what the who the what the where the when the why and how and we won't catch all of them we won't have time but we just just a few little things here and right this down now you don't have turn there exactly and I think maybe brother will get another scripture up here in just a moment but WR write it down Luke 18 10-4 all right now this is what Jesus said there's two men praying they go up to the temple to pray one's a Pharisee one's a Publican the Pharisee prays thus with himself I thank thee Lord I'm not as other men I fast twice I give tithe then the Publican standing a far off would not so much as even lift up his eyes to heaven but smote himself upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner he said I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other and then he makes the statement he that humbles himself he shall be exalted he that uh abases he that exalts himself shall be abased now notice where these two men are standing in the temple in the courts of the temple where prayer is common offered all right some when he renders this stood by himself and prayed in this way it is the characteristic of this sect of Pharisees who would dread the contact of Sinners wow so they would stand by thems away from all the rest of the Sinners publicans extortioners because they believed that even if the shadow of a gentile fell on them they go bathe themselves in water cuz they've been dirtied up defiled this is the kind of thinking these people had when they went to prayer watch their prayer life was a direct reflection of their real life yes yes their inside life show what's the outside life I'd like to stop right here and start explaining what's the matter with preachers in this message now and not to mention the congregations and followup yes sir yes sir everything I'm preacher does of who he really is 10% of it's right here 90% of it's where away where nobody body can see what's going on a real man of God a real servant of the Lord his real walk with God is 90% out there in that prayer life talking of the Lord being dealt with by God and 10% standing here in the pull pit I can always tell whether that man's ever even had a relationship with the Lord at all CU I can tell by the way he preaches whether or not he's even got a prayer life or not right amen amen I can tell you that right away you hear people get up and preach uh Lord a father uh Lord uh uh and I think you know they really ought to spend some more time talking to him right exactly right and then when they preach they've got the same type of expression now here here's what I'm trying to get at how am I going to lead anybody into a relationship with Christ when I don't have one myself how do I get it I've got to pray amen amen I've got to talk to the Lord I got to spend some time with God if I don't know anything about the man how am I going to tell you how wonderful he is I've got to know something myself so they would stand by themsel all right Hypocrites are often the most Orthodox in the opinion of any class of men you better believe they are they know the truth they admit it and use it frequently in their prayers and conversation they'll even persecute those who may really be wrong and they are but of course you understand they they will they will P even in his prayer look at how he's praying God thank you didn't make me like this sinner down here right right he's persecuting the man yes no wonder he walked out of the prayer closet and done the very same thing yeah yes cuz in prayer he was persecuting amen this is why Jesus said pray for those that despitefully use you didn't say persecute him yes said pray for him God help me have a sweet attitude toward that brother help me have a nice attitude toward that sister if you pray for him in the outside will reflect what you prayed for on the end that's right if you prayed on the end God rained fire down on them you'll probably act like that on the outside that's right brother right yes sir amen see it's not wrong to thank God that he's kept us from the gross sins which other men and so forth commit but it should not be done in an ostentatious manner boy that's a big word in he said nor should it be done forgetting that we are great sinners in need of Pardon ourselves so the Pharisees were speaking in the way of I I have never been like these guys I'm a Pharisee I'm clean from the time I was born I am not like that bunch of people right right you understand why Jesus couldn't do nothing with them right yeah absolutely so how could they hear him when he talked to them yes sir yes how could these Pharisees of God came right down in the building and said hey you're a sinner well they're not going to listen to that right they turned their ears from it yes but this is the reason why a prostitute could bow at his feet and get more out of Jesus in five minutes than their 40 Years of Pharisees amen yes sir yes sir this is a reason why why their attitude toward the who the what they the what that they're standing by see yes watch here I love he says standing a far off in the temple where the where the where the Publican was at now the place where this was at was actually offered in the temple was the court of the women so in other words the Pharisee would Advance themsel as near to the main part of the temple as they could but the Publican would stand as far back as possible even to the court of the Gentiles almost as if he was a pagan himself being conscious of his unworthiness he stood far back as far back as he could saying God be merciful to me as sinner but the Pharisee went all the way up just as close to the throne as he could get as we would say yes because he believed himself to have a right there the other didn't believe he had a right there so he's back there praying God have mercy on me and the other one's up there saying thank God you didn't make me like this guy right but Jesus said that's the one that's going to be abased that's the one that's going to be exalted amen amen why the attitude of the prayer they were looking at the what and The Who and said God you're a God of Holiness and righteousness and I'm looking at the what I'm looking at who I am I am a sinner in need of your grace so when they prayed they didn't walk up like a lot of people do nowadays I'm the bride I'm elected I'm predestinated right glory to God hallelujah God you owe it to me cuz I'm bride right brother oh man no wonder people don't get nowhere right right they don't understand the what yes the what is I'm talking to the one that can take it from me or give it to me yes yes I have no control over so I got to come to him with the right kind of attitude Lord Jesus I thank you for making me bride I thank you for making me elect but is it your will that certain things would happen you see that's the different attitude of it amen but a lot of them I'm the bride Lord Jesus you owe it to me God don't owe us nothing brother amen amen don't owe us nothing not one thing yes now let's look at another Avenue of prayer all right Exodus 2 23-25 all right you can put this one on the board if you want so Matthew you read this for us if you would Exodus 2 23-25 all right this is another way of prayer now watch what happens when these children of Israel pray all right go ahead kid and it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them now this is a wonderful thing when you study now when they Cried unto God when they Cried unto God now watch this very powerful remark God when he heard their groanings their groanings then caused God to remember his word amen yes this is why we pray this is the what yes we pray so God can remember his word not that God forgot it now not that God forgot it but that you're reminding God Lord I'm still here I'm still believing your word not that God forgot about you but God likes to be reminded of things he likes you to call it to his attention amen father I'm still believing you I still got confidence in you I'm still trusting you praise God when they groaned God remembered his Covenant and look at this verse 25 God looked upon the children of Israel so he didn't just hear him but then he turns to look at him yes and then God had respect unto him yes amen God respected him this the whole reason why God sent a Moses cuz God respected him yes hang on everybody some people God don't respect that's right amen amen yes has no respect for them they ignore the word they don't live right yes tell them whatever to do they ignore it right they pretty much by their attitude tell God to jump in a river how could God respect some somebody that don't respect him that's right right amen right yes see God heard God remembered God looked God respected that's the way it works for us amen amen God heard God remembered God looked God respected all right Exodus chapter 3 now 7-9 all right little brother you read for us it's your turn 7-9 now watch this is exactly God once again talking to the children of Israel and the Lord said I the affli of my people which are in Egypt and I've heard their Cry by reason of their did you catch that I heard their cry what was their cry their prayers yes praise God for I know their sorrow M and I come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bre them up out of that land a good land andarge a FL with milk and honey the place of the Canaan can Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parites Andes and the jeites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel come up unto me have also seen the oppression where the Egyptian oppress so when when they hears their cry watch The Cry or this prayer causes God to change his Direction in other words there was prophecy that held these people in this land of bondage God heard him God heard him and God heard him how long did God hear them about 400 years yes sir yes sir amen my goodness how many vials were stored up yeah right of Israelite vials vials of prayer just setting up there in heaven stored up bottled up tears amen Storehouse in heaven full of them yes sir no wonder when Moses stepped out that he just about turned Egypt upside down the first day much left the other day amen amen yes he call he calls for fly you understand why he could create yes all them prayers sitting up there uhhuh my goodness okay why plagues and Locust could fall all them prayers sitting up there yes sir I tell you brother when God goes to answer in a lot of prayer he answers in a big way amen that's the reason why God could respond if you'll notice he hears their cry verse eight he comes down to deliver them so the Deliverance was a direct result of the cry yes yes I hope you understand that that's why if you just invest a little bit of time oh God I need some help well your help may come little then yes you understand this just like in the Bible when the man uh Elisha told him said Smite the ground with your with your bow and he just smoted it a couple times he had a whole lot more bow arrows in his quiver he said why didn't you smite him more than that he said now God's only going to Smite Syria that many times you see little bottles of Tears produce little results that's right lots of bottles of Tears produce big results that's why we should never stop asking God for what we want amen amen cuz the more we ask when God goes to answer he answers and reciprocates and gives back to us the way that we give into it so if you're going to put a little time in you're going to give one minute a year Lord I'd like to get saved no wonder people don't get saved that's why they say saved about a minute because that's all they put into it right right brother B amen I can take off we' have evangelism meeting right now on that thought right there that's the reason why that they hang out about 6 months and they're gone you know why they've only put about 6 months into the thing amen amen if you're going to serve the Lord you got to put a lot into this thing yes sir yes sir every day of your life you got to put it over time sometime I like being an overtime Christian yes am when it comes to serving the lord I'm I'm going work a hard yes amen put more into it you get more out of it look at how God responded the way he responded was a result to the way he they pray beautiful beautiful exactly that's the what we're talking about oh my well so many more of those W's in there we going to get to them all but I'm I'm just going to catch the main points go beautiful beautiful so you basically saying the the the more prayers like say you praying for the same thing because the Bible I know somewhere it says don't be repetitious yeah that's true too so you saying the more that you pray for a certain thing the more time effort you put in and the more sincere you is when God comes to answer it at that time the same amount that's what you're getting that's right that's exactly right and it's a good point on that about the vain repetition and I I'm going to come to that in just a little bit we'll just hit it now in other words when Jesus say don't pray vain repetition what he's talking about is don't pray without a purpose yes amen amen you understand if if a person's just praying for the sake of praying they have no purpose behind it but what's the use of praying all you doing is saying a bunch of words yeah 400 years they had a purpose they prayed we w't have this mess they had a purpose every time they prayed right amen it's not pain that way yes see uh let's say God reveals something to you Lord you're going to do a certain thing well then maybe you wouldn't have to pray about it no more but leading up to that one moment that God confirms to you it's going to be all right you might pray 400 prayers getting up to that one moment when you're satisfied it's going to be all right well then you might just step away and say all right lord it's in your hands I don't have to touch it no more right but until then you're you're satisfied you see what I'm saying vain repetition without a purpose that's the main part of it Samy I worked with a Buddhist girl and she told me that to be more holy they walk around saying budha Buddha Buddha Buddha and they like make a chant over and over and that makes them more holy and that's their prayer just to repeat one work what kind of people we be walk around and said Jesus Jesus Jesus all the time be a lot better for us wouldn't it because we got the right name they don't right yeah but that's that's true there's no purpose in it it's for the purpose of ritualistic just fallowing a bunch of ritual ritual doesn't make us holy right right ritual makes us punctual it makes us whatever but doesn't make us holy yes all right teaching on Moses little boys and girls does God hear prayer yes he hears it does he answer quick not all the time sometimes he makes us wait amen sometimes he makes us wait praise God I'm kind of gigging a little bit because that's the hard part ain't it yes amen and sitting around waiting for it yes right Lord I've said I've said I've said well hold on maybe it ain't stored up yet right need to be stored a little bit more maybe when God goes to pouring the thing out it needs to be a bigger blessing than what you expect it to be yes maybe there needs to be more work put into it let me explain to you this way let's say after church here we get out here and get stuck in a ditch the snow are falling down and somebody runs into a ditch well big old truck what two three four tons ever how big the thing if it's a big old douy it might be three or four tons fall into the ditch while you walk over there and you grab one of the little hooks on the front and you just make a little a pool like this well I don't reckon we're going to get it out tonight well of course you ain't going to get it out tonight because your effort wasn't strong enough to get it pulled out but you get a chain you get you another car three or four brothers one on either side of it and pull it you see the effort is how you get the result of what you got maybe the problem is is that sometimes when prayers ain't answered is because we ain't put the right effort into it right amen something to think about ain't it y all right in judges 16 verse 26-28 you just write it down judges 16 26-28 Samson called unto the Lord when he called on the Lord he asked God to remember him this is when he's blind and got the pillars in his hand and asked God to avenge him his eyes he said ask God to remember and God remembered it God gave him strength and the Bible said he killed more Philistines at the end than he did at the beginning but here's the point I want you to get in your mind Samson gave his heart to Delilah but gave his strength to the Lord exactly exactly so the results of his ministry was what he gave his strength to that was the successes but look at the failure at the end yes right this is why you see a lot of churches and things have a good pastor good preacher the people are singers and musicians and great technologists and all kinds of things boy they're just clicking right along all of a sudden they disappear somebody's committed adultery somebody's lied somebody's split somebody's done this thing that thing why is that oh listen they give their strength unto the church wow wow but they never give their heart unto God Amen how do you do that prayer yes you got to you got to commit these things to prayer God I give you my heart and prayer if more preachers would do that if more lay people would do that Deacon trust these what more Housewives we'd be in better shap amen see brother says like this no wonder the secret has been discovered you take the baptism the holy ghost out of the people and they go for the things of the world instead of going for god wow wow see what good does an intellectual talk do if it ain't got the holy spirit in it amen amen and there's Samson standing there he's divided he's split so part of himself is for this part of himself is for that and it I want you to catch this it wasn't until he became perfectly uni and surrendered to God that he had the great success of his ministry that he done what God called him to do amen amen this is what prayer real prayer puts us together yes we're not split we're not this way and that way and the other we're one we're one before the Lord remember Jesus said serve god with your heart soul body mind Spirit everything see so all of it becomes Focus every part of you comes focused when you're in prayer thy will be done thy kingdom come all right just a little a little bit further we going have to quit Ain got no idea how long we've been up here but I don't want to hold it too long all right I've been known to go two three four hours on meetings like this so I'll be careful all right now picking up another little spot here and uh uh we just want to pick up in Romans uh 12 and 12 if you want to well let's let's just read that we got a minute let's just pick that one up yes sir Romans 1212 brother atin want you to read this one for us Romans 12 and 12 all right this is a this is a good scripture to read out I started just to quote it go on but I think it'd be a good one just to stop on it a moment yes right Romans 12 and 12 rejoicing in Hope patient in Tribulation continuing instant in pray beautiful beautiful okay the word here inston is the Greek word that means attend continually give oneself to continually to give unremittingly to a thing to continue all the time in a place but here's the real real part of this be in constant Readiness constant Readiness so Paul is telling us to be instant in prayer or be in a constant Readiness to continually give ourself to prayer so so that means that we're not just ready by okay Lord I made my appointment with you it's 1:30 we're going to pray now till 2: and now I'm going to pray and prayer is over but when you walk out of the prayer closet you step outside and there's an emergency come up you're on a Readiness you're right back to prayer oh God you see what's happening right now Lord Jesus we need your help amen you see it's a constant Readiness constant ready to come in we're in the where and the how and the what we're getting all of them at the same time you're standing right there and ready Beau it's in your heart now you want to be ready before the Lord anything God ever said to you I mean look for example uh in meh was tendency brother BR coming off that plane keep walking yes yes how how could a man be ready to do the things he was doing if he wasn't in that constant state of looking to the Lord for whatever God would want him to do this is what Paul said we have to be in prayer have a constant ready attitude yes at any moment to pull away and say okay Lord what did you want amen calling on my heart I'm answering the phone what what what's going on show me yes let me know see constant Readiness constant Readiness continually giving yourself to unremitting which means you do not let anything get in the way of that attitude amen by I'm going to say something I want you to really take this down write it down if you need to remember it yes you may not miss days there may be times where you miss seasons of prayer spots of prayer time of prayer because of circumstances and God will excuse that from time to time yes yes but God's not going to excuse us if we miss this ready attitude right right I may miss that 130 time limit that I put on my prayer life I may miss that 30 minute block but if I miss this ready attitude I've missed it all amen amen because if I missed this way some people do well I didn't catch that 30 minutes well God I'll have to see you tomorrow right brother right but you got to be able to adapt amen sometimes when life comes in and things are happening you got to be able to change and shift as you go yes if you miss morning prayer don't sit and beat yourself up the rest of the day have a ready attitude Lord the first chance I get we're going to talk a little while amen amen beautiful I'm going to say this beautiful hang on everybody I'd rather have that right there than a two-hour prayer life yes yes cuz I can have two hours of prayer every single day five times a day I missed that attitude right there I've missed every bit of it amen absolutely you understand yes sir it's got to be it's got to be that way yes that was that was that was the real home run tonight I hope you got a hold of that scripture yes sir beautiful and the Lord hit that one farther than the Cubs did the other night yes sir amen they told me they turned Chicago upside down I just pray God turn my heart upside down that's all I yes sir yes amen if you're bald people I don't know if you even notice it watch here 1 Corinthians 75 all right not have turn there just write it down the Bible even said for for married men and women that in order for them to give thems to fasting and prayer you'll notice it's consent for a time so we're talking about the difference in Long prayers and and posted stamp prayers so if a man will say feeling led the Lord to try to draw close to the Lord in a certain area maybe the Lord's dealing with him on something according to the laws of the Bible husband and wife are supposed to have a private relation ship life together behind the bedroom door and they're not allowed to enter into long fasting and prayer except they seek for permission from their spouse honey I'm going into this I need consent for a time and then as soon as the thing's over with they come together again now this is referring sexually they come together again quickly that Satan not tempt them for their incontinency or inconsistency is what that word is see in other words to give yourself in into this for a consent of time so you'll watch it shows us that even in this little example that God is mindful of the responsibilities that we have as human beings and how that it interacts with our prayer life amen uhuh C can you see that clearly amen it inter our life interacts with all these other things so if we're going to enter into a deeper something with God and I'm a married man I've got to go back and ask that woman right there may I have your permission to fast and pray for a little while why I've got to ask her well she's my responsibility and I according to the Bible I owe her love debts right right oh that's that's a whole another study in itself we'll come back after while and get that one down the road somewhere another right right I don't know good as I'm feeling we may just hit it all tonight who knows huh I've got to ask her I absolutely got to ask permission why because there's a responsibility even in that now the word that Paul uses here for prayer I like this it the original word the original Greek word the definition of it is like this prayer or a place in open air where the Jews would pray outside the cities when they had no synagogue they would sometimes situate thems on a bank or a stream or the shore of a sea where there was a supply of water for washing their hands before prayer so before they would pray they would wash their hands and then they would go into to pray now now that that gives you a little type of something because because the hands represented the doings the doings your daily activities so it shows that your daily life and your prayer life they interact one with another yes and God's not going to straighten that out for us amen amen it's our responsibility to make them interact right right amen amen amen beautiful some of y'all folks that a't blinking at me no more Hallelujah now that's right that's exactly right exactly right all right Ephesians 6:18 write this down praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit showing that you must pray in the spirit watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints so you're not just praying for yourself you're praying for Saints as well yes all right in the U Bible dictionary I like it says here prayers different kinds all right now watch I'm going to show you this interaction part of this and then we're GNA try to quit all right Matthew 66 as we read there he talked about the secret part of prayer but now there's a secret part of prayer there's a social part of prayer there's a family part of prayer there's worship part of prayer or even social worship for that matter there is a public part of prayer and service in the sanctuary part of prayer so somebody for example that would say well what is my prayer life it's all of that yes yes it's not just praying at home home but it's family prayers it's social prayers and worship like this it's public prayers you ever had anybody at your job to say man I'm in bad shape Pray For Me Right amen that's a public prayer yes instant in prayer instant in season out of season service of the sanctuary as I said a minute ago brother Austin come up here and lead us in prayer see that service in the sanctuary so somebody says well I got a prayer life if they only pray thems and God they've only got one part of a prayer life right right right yeah amen beautiful beautiful H and that's about where the Manchester folks got quiet but this is true see there's more to it beautiful than just the personal private prayer that you have remember the doings of the Washings of the hand the prophet told us that the family altar was the kitchen table that's the craziest thing anybody 21st century people thinks that's a ridiculous remark but more things in society uh politicians for example did you know when they're going to try to work out a deal and they're going to try to fix the world you know first thing they do feed them right the first thing they do they set them down at dinner and they let everybody sit down and start eating you know why they start relaxing they let their guard down a little while and then they can really you ever notice that you get a bunch of saints together like that and people don't know one another have a special meeting and people come every which way and you go out to eat and ain't nobody talking to one another they're standing in the line Ryan or Ruby Tuesday or some buffet or golden crowd or something everybody stand there how you doing good how are you doing fine how's the wife she's good how's your wife fine but all of a sudden they get about half a plate into them and everybody starts smiling and talking and conversing and you think he best friends you thought they lost at sea together and they had dependent on each other for their life and so something about it the family altar or being there at the table is where brother R said we pray together as a family God we need more of it we need more of it at the noron household jumping up and down running every which way these evangelism trips and your family alers a Big Mac through the through through the through the drive-thru on your way to next 400 miles you know we need a lot more of it I guarantee God help me in it yes sir see all of these aspects of prayer all right now let me let me talk to you now about conversing before the Lord all right get your get your pencils ready or if you're going catch the recording later Exodus 32:11 tells us beseeching the Lord okay 1 Samuel 1:15 tells us pouring out our soul before the Lord 2 Chronicles 32 and2 praying and crying to Heaven watch all these different me modes and means of prayer seeking unto God and making supplication that's job 8 and5 Drawing Near to God that's Psalm 73 and 28 bowing the knees that's Ephesians 3:14 prayer presupposes a belief in the personality of God his ability and willingness to communicate with us his personal control of all things so acceptable and and acceptable prayer must be sincere that's Hebrews 10:22 it must be offered with reverence and godly fear all right ask and you shall receive that's Matthew 77 and 8 Matthew 21 and 22 that's Mark 11 and 24 it's St John 14 13 and 14 in the Name of Christ that's how we pray is in his name those scriptures are St John 16232 24 St John 15:16 and Ephesians 2 and8 Ephesians 5 and 20 Colossians 3:1 17 1 Peter 2 and 5 all them places tell us how to approach God prayer in different kinds secret social Family Worship Public Service of the sanctuary see brother man said if you want to be an edent to a meeting just don't pray wow that's you want to be the greatest help the meeting can have is not financially set aside an hour or two a day to pray for the meeting that's how you can help a meeting more than anything else right there are no rules in the scripture that says that we must kneel but there is kneeling in the scripture it's the attitude nothing in there says we have to kneel down okay I'm going to give you an example of that the places made mention of kneeling in prayer all right if if you if you're catching this on the recording I'll try to go slower here to catch it but not not too slow First Kings 8:54 2 Chronicles 6:13 Psalm 956 Isaiah 45:23 Luke 22:41 acts 7 and 60 acts 9 and 40 Ephesians 3 and14 all right now bowing and falling prostrate all right falling prostrate before the Lord that's Genesis 24:26 and verse 52 as well of the 24th chapter of Genesis so Genesis 24:26 and 52 Exodus 4 and 31 Exodus 12 and 27 Matthew 2639 Mark 1435 all right of spreading out the hands in prayer that's First Kings 8:22 also verse 38:54 Psalm 282 Psalm 634 Psalm 889 and 1 Timothy 2:8 that's the spreading out of the hands of standing that's 1st Samuel 1:26 1 Kings 8:14 and also verse 55 2 Chronicles 29 Mark 11:25 Luke 181 and13 and if we accept the Lord's Prayer that's Matthew 69-13 the model or the pattern of prayer offer offers to us no special form of prayer but just to pray after this manner pray amen amen so you can see all of these different things in the way that we pray yes so you pick which one works for you and then that's the one you use amen amen everybody does it different yes sir all right oh there's you realize I got 57 more pages after all this still got it coming right right oh let me just let me just skip down just a little bit so much about prayer when it comes to people and prayer we could just go down through so many different things but I like this uh one man said Robinson's job prayer is like the dove that Noah sent forth which blessed him not only when it returned with the olive leaf but when it never returned at all amen that's a blessed right right right I like that amen all right now getting down to the what when and how and where and all these other guys we'll we'll catch just a couple little things in Ephesians 6:8 after taking the helmet of salvation sword of the spirit Shield of faith and so forth he says praying always with prayer and supplication so what good does it do you to dress up to fight if you ain't talking to the commander amen amen have supplication for the Saints but you got to talk to the commander as well in the expectation message brother Brandon said prayer will even change the mind of God and it did one time it changed his mind not so much that God wanted to change his mind in some way but that God heard a man's prayer even allowed him to go on the permissive will right yes of that very thing that's it right there and talking about that was 2 Kings 20 go 1 through 20 and you'll find out about Hezekiah turning his face to the wall the prophet walked in thus sayi the Lord you're going to die got to almost to the chambers of the door and got to the gates of the city and the Holy Spirit said thus say Lord go back and tell him he's going to live right right I said if you're a skeptic and a doubter you to put a website up just after you got done doing the second one exactly right exactly right exactly right see brother M said like this he said remember you've got to give God a cause or a reason you've got to give God a cause or a reason it all comes down to your motive and your objective now I'm not going to quit just yet because I feel led to get this next part amen Matthew 11:2 24:25 Mark 11: 24:25 said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them but you cannot ask God for anything except you've got the right motive and the right objective yes if you don't have the right motive and objective forget it it ain't going to work you just saying pay repetitions that's all it is you got to have a purpose behind what you're asking for yes all right God reconsidered hezekiah's case because Hezekiah wanted to do more work for the Lord yeah right it wasn't God's will for him to do it but he was a righteous man he pulled on the heart of God he wanted to do more work for the Lord it ended up being an absolute devastating thing you should never for in the first place right amen you should left alone said God you got the greater wisdom of it but it proves to us what this what this story and this example shows this end sample of the scripture shows us is it tells us that when somebody has got the right motive and objective it will so pull on the heart of god Till God's willing to do what you're wanting to what you're asking for amen he's willing to do it that's where we have to be smarter than Hezekiah and say God I really want this but is it what you you really want right right you got to be that much wiser than Hezekiah was see prayer oh I love this is the most powerful weapon ever put in the hands of a man amen there's no scud missile right there's no atomic bomb amen that can work like prayer can because you can push the button and the bomb can go boom but prayer stopped the guy pushing the button that's right that's right Hallelujah absolutely yes sir the Lord Jesus yes sir amen oh my Hallelujah beautiful beautiful yes it's our attitude towards god brother Bram says in desperation he changed the program of God in desperation in other words God haded running out a certain direction and all of a sudden here he Chang now it's not that God deviated from what he really wanted he just permitted hezekiah's way God wanted him to go yes but he permitted Hezekiah to have his way power of Prayer shows us how powerful prayer is that also instructs us and gives us pause for a moment to think if prayer is that powerful of a weapon how much more powerful is it in than than in the hands of a man or a woman that will stop and as we said right from the very beginning of the study tonight and seek thy will be done thy kingdom thy will be done if a man seeks that then prayer can be so much more powerful than what he'd ever imagine because not only does he have the powerful weapon of prayer to pull on the heart of God just like the children of Israel they wept bitterly and so for pulled on the heart of God but now they got the will of God to go along with the feeling of God amen amen praise God whether that makes it I'll tell you yes brother M said stuff that the devil can't BL that's what it is hallelujah beautiful that's what we got to be that's exactly what we've got to be see the man finally backslid on God he'd been better off he took God's first word but it proves to us how powerful prayer is let me give you another example Psalm 1061 12-15 the Bible talking about the children of Israel the Bible said he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul right why because they wanted it so bad God permitted their way but God didn't want them to have it remember when the quail came blowing through there right right terrible they they loved it they thought it was the greatest thing in the world but it was leanness to their soul right right so why we have to ask God thy will be done amen you understand that even a preacher with the authority of the Holy Ghost on him somebody come up with a sickness and I let my hands or Jesse or somebody lay their hand on and I believe him be a holy ghost filled Son of God servant of God preacher of the Gospel I believe God's with him and I believe if he asked God to move that cancer God would do it but if he's not careful and he' done it out of the will of God God could make him pay for that cancer that wasn't supposed to be moved like that that's right brother that's right it's a dangerous thing yes sir God will sometimes permit things to happen he'll allow it because we take a gift or something and influence it that's where we got to come back and find out about this who what where when and why yes yes thy kingdom thy will be done it's an important thing amen all right uh just to pinch further now uh let's see I'm just going to skip down this a whole lot here all right in Romans 10:1 Paul's desire was for Israel to be saved did you understand that God was actually trying to answer Paul's prayer in World War II in World War II when all of that was happening with the Jews during the Holocaust period God was actually answering the Apostle Paul's prayer wow wow wow he wanted Israel to be saved they cannot be saved unless the in their Homeland wow wow so God was actually answering Paul's prayer my desire My harsh desire and prayer to God for Israel they' be saved God was answering Paul's Prayer by pushing them back into the Homeland so Israel could be saved as a nation 144,000 took him 2,000 years to get there but that prayer is finally answered amen amen Paul must have done a lot of praying for to last there 2,000 years like that all right let's turn now Romans 8:26 2 7 all right brother Benjamin you're you're up next to read let's let's pull this one in here Romans 8 2627 are you a Jesse a Benjamin Jessie yeah huh what are you a Benjamin Jesse or a Benjamin Keith or a Benjamin John or what what are you Benjamin Gandy a what Gandy no middle name oh ly oh ly oh oh okay okay all right I wonder Romans 8:26 27 likewise the spirit also help our affirm for we know not what we should pray for as we are all right hold it I me has ever prayed and not know what to pray for yeah right right God didn't leave us alone or we have no answer or have no help look what he said but the spirit is s maketh intercession for us with Gress which cannot be uttered now see this makes me want to get out of this teaching mode and get in this shouting mode over here hallelujah amen he says you can't do it yourself you can't figure out what to pray that's all right son I'll do the praying for you amen amen amen amen hallelujah he's I'll handle it don't worry about it praise God I'll take care of it it goes to prove how important it is to God for you to pray amen amen and when it comes to something that's a real need he'll pray for you if you can't do it yourself right right amen my goodness do you realize the reason you're sitting here tonight is because Jesus prayed for you that's right right he said I pray for them not these that are in the world but for these father that in your hand amen sanctifying through thy truth Thy word is truth keep them that's the reason I'm here tonight yes yes that's the reason I'm saved there reason you're saved amen yes we got the Holy Ghost as Jesus prayed for us yes amen glory beautiful oh my praise the Lord he that search the hearts go ahead and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit oh don't fail this this is important catch it and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what in the mind of the spirit uh-huh because he make him intercession for the Saints to the will of God according to the will of God that's so vital the spirit knows the mind of the spirit you know yourself because your spirit is you and you are your spirit you know your own mind yes yes just like the spirit of God knows his own mind but when he prays look how he makes intercession look how it makes intercession according to the will of God according to the will of God Amen if we fail that part right there we could bombard heaven with every prayer and take Faith and say God do this and God may do it but was it his will that's right beautiful this the thing I want to know is it was was it God's will amen beautiful you understand some of these charismatic he healing revivals and people come walking up there Benny hen waves his hand at them and they fall down not everybody that does that stuff is a bunch of fakers right some of them people that come up are like it they're sincere and they mean business with God even Bennie hen himself made the statement a long time ago horse he's a hen we're Eagles right he said himself he said the catchers are not for the ones that are sincere he says for the ones that ain't he said because the ones that get the Holy Ghost and really get it right when they fall it don't bother them he said the ones that are faking we catch keep them from killing theirself oh my good they're sincere as they could be some of them they walk up there and he waves his hand at him cancer come away from but that's not really the mark of a servant of God a servant of God don't just wave his hand at everything and say God heal it he stops for a moment and he says now father real humbly with his head bowed is it your will to heal this person right amen how do I know that this sickness ain't a whip to get them right exactly I want to know Lord Jesus if I touch this am I going to get in trouble with you MH wow that's a servant of God yes sir why he wants to pray this way amen amen amen according to the will of God see it comes right back to thy kingdom thy will all right Matthew 69-13 The Lord's Prayer Deliver Us from Evil he finishes the prayer verse 13 for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever he says amen or so be it so he starts it off with God he goes into deals with other people and then he finishes it off with God so his first first and his last his a and his Z his beginning and his ending was the Lord Jesus amen amen amen that goes to prove to you why he got what he wanted praise God because he had the right Focus he had the right approach praise God all right Second Kings 4: 32-35 Elisha shuts the door this when he lays himself over the baby and sneezes seven Church ages now this is the prayer of Jaz very very famous let's let's read this last part we're going to quit right here 1 Chronicles 49 and10 when they get it up on the board I want brother Jesse to read it for US 1 Chronicles 49 and 10 right I just want to take this little prayer and I want to break it down for just a little bit before we quit all right if you want to write this down to Luke 22 31 and 32 the Lord said to Simon Satan desired to sift you of wheat but I prayed for you that your faith fail you not right right right that's the reason why Peter was able to hang on yes even after all the cussing and everything else and carrying on like he did over at the fire that day oh I'm not one of them he said you talk dis like them oh shut your mouth I'm not one of them Bible said he cursed and went out weeping bitterly you know what held him when he pulled his coats off said what we going to do he jerked his clothes off jumped in the water said I'm going fishing I don't know about to rest of y'all what he didn't realize glory amen the prayers of Jesus was following that little disciple around Hallelujah yes amen glory oh is that way what could it do for our loved ones yes yes what could it do for our family could be people in the church folks we got burdens for it'll follow them around all the days of their life amen hey and it may not make them bright but it may meet him at judgment and that's what I'm hoping for one of these days hallelujah amen may get them out of a real mess amen first first Corinthians that's new test old T Chronicles 49 and 10 all right go ahead buddy okay verse n and Jaz was more honorable than his Brethren and his mother called his name jabz saying because I bear him with sorrow and Jaz called on the god of Israel saying oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed and enlarge my coast and that thine hand might be with me and that thou would us keep me from Evil that it may not grieve me and God granted him that which he requested let me hit something real quick before we go there could have been 10,000 J bezas in the country right we don't even know this guy's last name right but the one thing we know about this man God heard him yes yes God granted what he requested look at his prayer look how unselfish it was he's doing the right thing God bless me we don't want to walk around God curs me God make my life miserable that's foolish right brother right that's foolishness we want the lord to bless us and help us well I don't deserve it it's not up to us us to determine what we deserve and not deserve that's up to the one that made us yes sir yes sir absolutely if I deserved everything I got I'd always get to bad but my Daddy has a little say in that he doesn't always want me to get the bad he wants me to get the good too amen amen so I'm going to pray this way watch he said enlarge my Coast watch all these THS and thines that thine hand might be with me that thou would keep me from Evil and they said now God you bless me as much as you can bless me but don't let it grieve me whatever you want to give to me let me have that what I can handle right God granted that which he requested this is the attitude of a right man look if you'll notice jz's prayer wasn't God do it or else right right it was God if it won't grieve me and it's okay with you look at his attitude do this for me amen amen amen praise the Lord praise God all right coming to the end now James 5 prayer of faith shall save the sick effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much Elisha or Elias is the Greek rendering in the New Testament Elijah prayed and God shut the heavens it wouldn't have mattered who prayed one prayer after that God didn't hear not one prayer amen not one prayer in Israel he might have heard him but he didn't listen to him that's right right cuz the only man he was going to hear about whether those Heavens come open or not was Elijah that's right when Elijah prayed again the Bible said and said God open him up down come the rain they could have prayed 24 hours a day seven days a week they could have had a prayer vigil every night they could have joined hands around the nation got all the religious and holy men together and prayed until their eyeballs fell out and their teeth followed them that's right brother right God listened God heard him but he didn't listen that's exactly right yes sir just like right now God shut the door on the United States of America there's not enough churches in the world to pray it out of it no sir no sir she's in judgment she'll never come out of it again she's gone brother said she's over amen it don't matter whether it's the last Trump or a woman president it going matter amen you know right Trump trump Pence Trump Pence Trump Pence thought it was interesting that that Hillary's running made is a cane right right so we got Kane in the trumpet all prophetic stuff coming in but she's gone yes sir make America great again and their eyes may be great right make a bunch of money and do this that well that's great to them but she'll never be what she was spiritually never she's dead right brother right John nine Jesus passes by sees a man blind from birth the disciples asked who sinned was said this man or his parents is born blind Jesus answered said neither sin but that the works of God should be manifested in manifested in him now the the the uh the idea behind that the thing I want to try to just share with you on that is sometimes things happen so God can manifest his glory yes yes not not for any other reason but that God can manifest his glory so when circumstances come along it's sometimes so God can manifest his glory it's not always because of sin right right problems come and we pray oh God forgive me forgive me help me help me sometimes it's just a matter of God wanting to manifest his glory so our prayer should be in them situations God are you trying to get Glory out of this yes and if we ask him he'd probably tell us way it would work all right that's the secret to all the mysteries of God is prayer in Exodus 3 God talked to Moses Moses talked to God Moses found out the direct will of God the time the Revelation and everything of what he was supposed to do brother BR said we failed to find the direct revelation of our life of how to fit into the program of God that's why we got to pray we got to find that direct Revelation for our life St John 16 9-2 Jesus prays for all of us all of us that are his amen you pick it up you go on down into oh just many many more places here I'm just going to have to quit I got a got time to finish it out yes sir but yes sir got all this here 2 Timothy 3 1-5 the last days parous times would come people would be unthankful and one of the first things you're supposed to do when you pray is be thankful to the Lord that's right so it goes to show that your prayer has to be something of a Thanksgiving to God and it has to also be according to the will of God amen amen not a hay on the fort but 1 hour and 48 minutes later here we are we're done amen praise God praise God usually by about this time most everybody that hears these Bible studies like this usually by about this time they take a great big old sigh and go wow man we really got loaded down but you know I'm going to tell you something sometimes and I say it like this sometimes you got to get good and fattened up for what's getting ready to come down the road sometimes sometimes you need a lot of information packed in there like that to help you down the line absolutely so I took extra time tonight I hope it's all wonderful wonderful we love you all very much prise God let's stand to our we're just going to PR over the word that we've spoken here just ask the Lord to bless it and
