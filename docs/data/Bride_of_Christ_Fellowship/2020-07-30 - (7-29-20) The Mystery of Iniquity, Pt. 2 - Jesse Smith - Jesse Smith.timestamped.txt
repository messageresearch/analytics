[27:46] church thank you for all you do all your
[27:49] support you know giving tithes and
[27:51] offerings it's a great blessing it
[27:52] supports the ministry
[27:53] uh we're going to keep it going by the
[27:55] grace of the lord so the second
[27:56] thessalonians chapter 2.
[28:00] i like could just read one verse let's
[28:02] conserve our time and um
[28:05] let's look at verse seven second
[28:07] thessalonians two verse seven
[28:17] all right let's just read verse seven
[28:19] together on three one
[28:20] two three for the mystery of iniquity
[28:23] doth already work only he who now
[28:27] letteth
[28:27] will let until he be taken out of the
[28:31] way
[28:31] that god has blessings reading his word
[28:33] you may be seated
[28:36] just a real interesting scripture church
[28:38] and even in verse seven
[28:40] i've had a couple emails this year
[28:42] already
[28:43] god hides can you pull that up verse 7
[28:46] god hides
[28:48] the end of the gentile dispensation in
[28:50] this scripture and people just
[28:51] miss it they can't see it because it's
[28:54] hidden from the eyes of the wise and
[28:55] prudent
[28:57] people see he and then he and they think
[28:59] it's two people
[29:01] but it's not it's one
[29:04] see iniquity is already working paul
[29:07] says
[29:07] only he the holy spirit will now let it
[29:12] until he the holy spirit and the church
[29:14] be taken out of the way
[29:16] yes so they miss it there so people
[29:19] think
[29:19] it's it's two people or they think it's
[29:21] you know one's the antichrist and one is
[29:24] one is the holy spirit and they totally
[29:26] mix it up but brother and clears it up
[29:28] for us in the first seal
[29:29] and he tells us this is the one and same
[29:32] self-same person the he
[29:34] the holy spirit the holy in other words
[29:36] the holy spirit is letting satan have
[29:38] his way
[29:40] right the holy spirit's letting satan
[29:42] run around the earth and
[29:43] and accuse the brethren day and night in
[29:45] heaven
[29:46] the holy spirit is letting him be god of
[29:48] this world
[29:50] until the holy spirit's ministry
[29:53] is taken out of the way right and then
[29:55] he has free course and then he has
[29:57] then his fullness will be headed up in
[30:00] the antichrist because verse 8
[30:02] says and then shall that wicked be
[30:04] revealed
[30:05] whom the lord shall consume with the
[30:07] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[30:08] with the brightness
[30:10] of his coming so see the holy spirit is
[30:14] letting satan do little things little
[30:15] things
[30:16] but once the holy spirit goes up and
[30:19] then satan can come down
[30:20] in his fullness in the person of the
[30:23] pope
[30:24] antichrist oh my but thank god
[30:28] church we know of course before when
[30:29] when the holy spirit goes up we go up
[30:32] praise god amen thank god for that he's
[30:35] going to let it go until
[30:36] he be taken out of the way the holy
[30:38] spirit christ and his bride
[30:40] be taken out of the way of destruction
[30:43] praise god because god will not suffer
[30:45] the righteous
[30:46] to be destroyed and tormented with the
[30:49] wicked we know that
[30:50] and we thank god for his mercy now just
[30:52] real brief a brief
[30:53] uh review what is the revelation of the
[30:56] mystery of iniquity
[30:58] it's the antichrist fills and deceives
[31:01] the hellbound majority into blaspheming
[31:04] god's truth
[31:06] under their mask of sin loving religious
[31:08] experience
[31:10] so it's a it's a mystery that most
[31:12] people don't know right most people
[31:13] don't
[31:14] most people don't think the antichrist
[31:16] is in the churches
[31:17] but he is that's the mystery of it
[31:20] it unmasks a religious front right
[31:24] it unmask and exposes it for what is it
[31:26] what it is
[31:27] it's a mother harlot it's a mother
[31:30] catholic church and her daughters
[31:32] who are uh purposely infiltrating the
[31:35] world with their wickedness and their
[31:36] abomination
[31:37] oh but god has unmasked that today and
[31:40] the revolution revelation is known to us
[31:42] praise god on sunday night we saw how
[31:45] this iniquity started it started in
[31:47] heaven
[31:48] but then it came down to earth praise
[31:49] god and it came down in the form of the
[31:52] serpent praise god or satan
[31:54] possessing the serpent and he questions
[31:57] god's word
[31:58] and he deceives eve and that's where we
[32:01] get the original sin
[32:02] so it's beautiful uh as far as the
[32:05] revelation
[32:05] to see how it started in heaven it got
[32:08] kicked out of heaven by a stronger angel
[32:10] michael praised god
[32:12] it got kicked out and then it come down
[32:14] to earth
[32:15] and the only one satan could deceive was
[32:18] a woman
[32:19] and it was because god was allowing it
[32:21] as a type
[32:22] so don't just see you know eve as a
[32:24] woman and all the women
[32:25] see all the church in there as well
[32:28] right see
[32:29] yourself you you us as a church we would
[32:31] have failed
[32:32] had it not been for our husband praise
[32:34] god we would be dead
[32:36] except christ overcome for us praise god
[32:39] amen because we have all fallen short of
[32:41] the glory of god
[32:42] we all had a chance to stand up we all
[32:44] had a chance to overcome but all of us
[32:46] fail
[32:47] in ourselves but we all conquer through
[32:49] jesus christ
[32:51] because the church is eve types the
[32:53] church
[32:54] the entire church praise god amen and
[32:57] christ
[32:57] adam types christ amen hallelujah who
[33:00] died
[33:01] and taking on her sin he purposely died
[33:04] taking the curse upon him
[33:06] that he might have continued fellowship
[33:08] with her amen amen and redeemer praise
[33:10] god that's the beauty
[33:12] of that story now so we see how iniquity
[33:16] came to earth
[33:17] and it was first satan's nature was
[33:20] introduced into the human race it wasn't
[33:23] originally the human race
[33:24] but it was introduced in the human race
[33:27] through the mystery of this
[33:28] serpent seed and there's uh nine
[33:30] evidences i'm just going through them
[33:32] quickly
[33:33] the the first evidence is that serpent
[33:35] seed is supported from genesis to
[33:37] revelation
[33:38] moses taught it and it goes to jesus to
[33:41] paul to john to revelation all the way
[33:43] it's all through the scripture second
[33:46] the two
[33:47] trees were not literal trees
[33:50] because uh they were not good for food
[33:53] the bible said there was trees that were
[33:55] good for food but then it said there was
[33:57] two trees
[33:58] and the bible said uh they were
[34:00] different trees praise god
[34:02] because any tree that will kill you is
[34:04] not good for food
[34:06] praise god so there are there was trees
[34:09] but then there was
[34:10] two spiritual trees christ and satan in
[34:13] the garden of eden
[34:14] so it's truly it's truly proven by the
[34:16] word of god
[34:17] the third proof is that the tree of life
[34:20] was jesus's spirit
[34:21] because there's only one way to eternal
[34:23] life if you make the tree of life a
[34:25] natural tree
[34:26] now you've got two ways to eternal life
[34:29] but there's only one way and that's
[34:30] through substitutionary sacrifice
[34:33] praise god a natural tree does not give
[34:35] you eternal life
[34:36] it was a spiritual tree it was god's
[34:39] spirit that gives us eternal life
[34:41] amen the fourth evidence is the serpent
[34:44] seed explains the purpose
[34:46] of the virgin birth praise god amen it
[34:49] had to be
[34:49] a sin sexual sin the beginning uh uh
[34:52] because the first sin came by sexual sin
[34:56] it was a sexual sin and it perverted the
[34:58] human race
[34:59] so god had to bypass sexual uh activity
[35:03] and bring forth his his new seed
[35:06] uh the seed of god without sexual sin
[35:10] through a virgin birth amen and that
[35:12] proves the mystery
[35:13] of god's seed amen the serpent seed came
[35:16] through sex
[35:17] but the seed of god came without it
[35:19] praise god through a virgin birth amen
[35:22] and then the fifth one is adam and eve
[35:24] covered their loins
[35:25] after eating the forbidden fruit that's
[35:27] all they covered was their loins
[35:29] so they went around covering their
[35:30] private parts because that's what they
[35:32] sin with their private parts
[35:34] praise god they didn't they didn't put
[35:36] masks on
[35:38] like we got today they didn't put hoods
[35:41] on like
[35:41] people wear today they put on loins
[35:45] because they were ashamed and it proves
[35:48] sexual sin always causes shame
[35:51] praise god that's right
[35:54] number six god's punishments for eve
[35:58] centered on her sexual reproduction and
[36:01] longing for adam
[36:03] remember she was punished in
[36:05] childbearing and bringing forth
[36:07] children she'd have pain in children and
[36:09] not only that so so there's pain
[36:11] as she brings for seed she has pain
[36:14] every time she brings forth seed as a
[36:16] universal sign
[36:17] that that's where her first sin took
[36:20] place with
[36:22] her reproductive parts praise god so
[36:25] she'll always have pain
[36:26] bringing forth natural seed because she
[36:28] received
[36:29] the wrong natural seed in the beginning
[36:32] and then
[36:33] god had to punish her because her
[36:35] longing was for the serpent
[36:37] instead of her husband and so afterwards
[36:40] god said so see now
[36:41] you're going to have to long for your
[36:43] husband because beforehand
[36:44] you long for the wrong man and that was
[36:47] the serpent
[36:49] seven the serpent was
[36:52] human-like before the fall he wasn't on
[36:55] his belly
[36:56] he was upright he had the ability to
[36:58] talk and he was a very beautiful
[37:00] creature because the bible said
[37:01] eve looked at him and thought he was
[37:04] beautiful
[37:05] and lusted after him with her eyes
[37:08] remember all three channels lust of the
[37:09] eyes lust of the flesh pride of life
[37:12] eve was seduced in all three areas but
[37:14] christ
[37:15] overcame in all three areas praise god
[37:17] amen
[37:18] where the woman fell the man overcame
[37:21] praise god amen and that's us
[37:23] we would fall except christ makes a way
[37:25] we can overcome amen
[37:27] so see he was human-like before the fall
[37:31] so much so
[37:32] that his seed could mingle with human
[37:34] seed and number eight
[37:36] cain was the serpent's son and not adams
[37:39] the scripture's clear on that praise god
[37:41] that cain
[37:42] was the son of the wicked one and adam
[37:45] is never called
[37:46] wicked adam is always called the son of
[37:48] god just like you are called a child of
[37:50] god amen
[37:52] thank god and lastly the seed of the
[37:55] woman
[37:56] was a literal man jesus christ just like
[37:59] the seed of the serpent was a literal
[38:01] man
[38:02] came praise god so if we know the seed
[38:05] of the woman had to come
[38:06] a natural man apart from human male
[38:10] instrumentality apart from human seed
[38:13] so did the serpent seed have to be a
[38:15] literal man apart from human seed
[38:18] it was serpent seed see that
[38:22] everybody see that by god's grace the
[38:23] serpent his seed was not literal human
[38:25] seed
[38:26] he came apart from human seed so did
[38:29] christ
[38:30] amen hallelujah now church if that don't
[38:32] prove it then people are just bombastic
[38:34] they're just blind
[38:35] they just don't want to see it right
[38:38] and i showed you a few weeks ago or
[38:40] months ago rather genesis 4
[38:42] 1 is the literal interpretation of
[38:44] genesis
[38:45] 3 6's symbolism genesis 3 6
[38:49] partaking of the fruit is symbolic right
[38:52] of a physical sex act that genesis 4
[38:56] 1 records amen now let's get to some new
[38:59] material here tonight
[39:01] now i found church there could be more
[39:03] but i found that iniquity has
[39:05] six attributes which
[39:09] six is the number of man it's the number
[39:10] of anointed man but it's also the number
[39:12] of
[39:13] fallen man okay so if you got your
[39:15] bibles here let's go through this
[39:17] by god's grace now we've seen satan's
[39:21] uh we've seen iniquity starting place in
[39:23] lucifer's heart
[39:25] and then he injected that nature into
[39:28] the heart of cain
[39:29] and then it passed down through six
[39:32] simple examples
[39:33] of iniquity now church take this
[39:37] attitude tonight as we go through these
[39:39] six
[39:40] you need to acknowledge them but you
[39:42] also need to overcome them
[39:44] so in other words learn from satan's six
[39:47] uh
[39:48] attributes and do the opposite praise
[39:50] god because
[39:51] what about ram say when the church gets
[39:53] a revelation of the antichrist
[39:56] spirit and withstands it shall be
[39:58] invincible praise god
[40:00] amen i believe it like this i believe
[40:02] there's a greater invincibility for the
[40:03] rapture
[40:04] no doubt about that but i believe the
[40:06] blood bought the blood
[40:08] purchased the overcoming bride has been
[40:11] invincible
[40:12] since the day of pentecost amen i
[40:14] believe that with all my heart in other
[40:16] words what i'm saying to you
[40:17] is that you and i are invincible by the
[40:20] blood of jesus christ
[40:21] and obeying the holy spirit right now
[40:23] praise god
[40:24] amen right because no man
[40:28] can pluck us out of the father's hand
[40:30] praise god
[40:32] doesn't mean we won't fall short doesn't
[40:34] mean we won't make mistakes but what it
[40:36] means
[40:36] is over the long-term battle you and i
[40:39] are invincible
[40:40] because we're sealed in to being victors
[40:42] in christ jesus
[40:44] amen thank the lord amen i believe that
[40:47] with all my heart praise god
[40:49] just like god said about job god said
[40:51] he's perfect he was invincible
[40:53] right he made a few mistakes on earth he
[40:55] was fearful
[40:56] you know he hated the day he was born he
[40:58] said some things maybe he shouldn't have
[41:00] said
[41:00] but overall he was invincible because
[41:02] god saw the
[41:03] end from the beginning god saw he was
[41:06] going to overcome
[41:08] now the first attribute of the uh
[41:12] the iniquity heart of satan and cain
[41:16] because now now this iniquity has gone
[41:18] from satan's heart
[41:19] to cain's heart the first one
[41:23] is they go through vain beautiful acts
[41:25] of worship
[41:26] religious acts of worship and they
[41:28] create their own traditions
[41:31] that's the first attribute
[41:34] church i don't know how long but there
[41:36] was a long time satan joined i don't
[41:38] know how it looked but he was playing as
[41:39] he had remember he had pipes in heaven
[41:41] he had pipes
[41:41] built in he must had wings and all kinds
[41:44] of things he
[41:45] he was for a long time maybe millions of
[41:47] years
[41:48] he enjoyed singing to god but at some
[41:50] point he was
[41:51] only going through the motions
[41:54] right he was only playing the
[41:57] instruments he was only preaching just
[41:58] for
[41:59] just going through the motion just
[42:01] because i have to be here
[42:02] my livelihood is here i was called here
[42:06] in other words he let he let his
[42:08] religious acts just become
[42:09] common oh god help us not to let him
[42:12] become common
[42:13] help us to enjoy every worship activity
[42:15] praise god
[42:16] help us enjoy cracking open that bible
[42:18] amen
[42:19] reading that bible say it in prayer
[42:21] coming to church
[42:22] worshiping glorifying god god help us to
[42:25] enjoy it praise god
[42:26] and not just go through the motions now
[42:29] at times
[42:30] are you have to yes you're going to
[42:31] bring your body into subjection
[42:33] but just keep pressing through just keep
[42:35] pressing through pretty soon you're
[42:37] going to enjoy it
[42:38] pretty soon you're going to shout and
[42:40] actually mean it praise god
[42:42] amen but see
[42:45] just like lucifer at some point he
[42:48] stopped enjoying it
[42:49] and he thought i need this i deserve
[42:52] this
[42:54] and then we know what happened he did
[42:55] the church split and then he started
[42:58] singing for more for his glory and to
[43:00] try to
[43:01] see everybody how beautiful he was was
[43:03] it was he not
[43:05] he convinced a third of them how great a
[43:07] singer he was
[43:08] and how a great musician he was singing
[43:11] all for his glory
[43:17] so see now he wanted to be the object of
[43:19] their worship instead of god
[43:23] cain did the same thing he brought a
[43:26] beautiful colorful offering
[43:28] fully aware that's not what god wanted
[43:31] he knew it abel had brought it before
[43:35] abel's was accepted he knew it was wrong
[43:38] he purposely
[43:39] went through vain acts fully aware
[43:43] he was wrong
[43:47] so church what was he he was stubborn
[43:50] i don't care what other people do the
[43:52] church i'm doing it this way
[43:54] i don't care what other people amen i'm
[43:56] not going to amend that
[43:58] because i don't believe that i think
[43:59] that's off the word
[44:01] because i've got my own revelation
[44:04] you see how he got he he was purposely
[44:07] willingly
[44:08] stubborn to worship like everybody else
[44:11] i think we shall worship like brother
[44:12] amen don't you with all of his heart
[44:15] right
[44:16] or who if i'm needing so and we don't
[44:17] have amen here you should worship like
[44:19] me
[44:19] right if i'm if i'm worshiping god and
[44:22] i'm surrendered and
[44:23] our brothers surrender to god that's
[44:25] what he's the song
[44:27] leader praise god he's trying to lead us
[44:30] into the presence of god amen you trust
[44:34] right you're trusting god's system
[44:35] that your leader will lead you into
[44:37] worship
[44:39] look at his smile when he sings look at
[44:40] his tears when he cries amen
[44:43] what is he trying to do lead us in the
[44:45] presence of god
[44:46] because he's already in god's presence
[44:51] hallelujah praise god that's what
[44:53] they're supposed to do
[44:55] lead us just like with joshua right they
[44:56] led they led before the ark came
[44:59] those leaders and singers and the our
[45:01] men they led the way
[45:02] they were already ahead praise god
[45:06] oh my
[45:09] you see that but see we shouldn't be
[45:11] stubborn and come here and not want to
[45:13] praise god or not want to amend the word
[45:15] we shouldn't be stubborn like that we
[45:16] should be obedient and willing
[45:18] amen submissive but see
[45:21] going through the motions is just a mask
[45:24] like the serpent hid behind uh his lie
[45:28] with eve
[45:29] oh you can be like god you can be just
[45:31] like god
[45:33] he's hiding right the religious act
[45:35] quoting
[45:36] the serpent talking about god was a mask
[45:40] he was but hiding behind that was a lie
[45:42] he wanted to slip in
[45:45] same thing it is with uh any
[45:48] false doctrine right they they say good
[45:50] things but then they slip in a little
[45:52] lie
[45:52] right just like a little yeast to make
[45:55] the whole
[45:56] uh dough leaven the scripture says as
[45:59] jesus talked
[46:00] and taught us about paul says the same
[46:03] thing
[46:03] the workers iniquity have a form of
[46:05] godliness an
[46:07] outward resemblance of godliness but
[46:10] inward the bible says they're dead men's
[46:13] bones right
[46:14] they're slowly corrupting themselves now
[46:16] see church that's why we got to be
[46:17] careful
[46:18] our our lives are our worship uh
[46:21] shouldn't be slowly going worse it
[46:23] should be steadily getting better
[46:26] and church you are the only one you're a
[46:28] creator praise god
[46:30] i'm a creator we create an atmosphere
[46:32] it's up to you
[46:33] praise god it's up to me it's up to each
[46:36] one of us
[46:36] to slowly create an atmosphere to slowly
[46:40] fall more in love with jesus to make
[46:42] sure our lives are pure
[46:44] and our worship is sincere because it's
[46:47] either going to slowly get better
[46:48] or slowly get worse until you despise
[46:51] coming to church
[46:52] writer despise the message or despise
[46:55] brother random sermons or despise the
[46:57] gospel
[46:59] so with the workers of iniquity they
[47:01] despise the truth
[47:04] slowly i was watching sermons of a
[47:07] brother
[47:08] in the message just from six years ago
[47:10] who used to be in the message now he's
[47:11] way out
[47:12] he was speaking so highly of brother
[47:14] branham and then i fast forwarded just
[47:16] four years
[47:17] he's left the message now he calls
[47:18] brother man i'm a liar he's a charlatan
[47:20] and all these things
[47:21] it didn't happen overnight church it was
[47:24] slow
[47:25] one week at a time even when he first
[47:28] left the church that's a preacher from
[47:30] lima you probably know what i'm talking
[47:31] about
[47:32] even when he first left the church he
[47:33] still said good things
[47:35] how faithful he was about brother man's
[47:37] fast forward three more years now he's a
[47:39] liar to charlatan
[47:41] oh my if people can't see that they're
[47:42] blind
[47:44] you're either slowly growing in grace
[47:46] more gracious more loving more forgiving
[47:48] or you're slowly corrupting into sin and
[47:51] anger and
[47:52] democracy let's let's slowly grow up
[47:55] into holiness praise god
[47:58] righteousness godliness
[48:04] and yet they go to church they're
[48:06] pastors you know they
[48:07] but it's either slow growth or it's slow
[48:10] corruption
[48:14] now you know what the scripture says
[48:15] paul says how to do it they creep
[48:18] into your house imagine that remember
[48:20] jesus or god told
[48:21] cain sin lies right at the door if you
[48:25] don't obey and worship like your brother
[48:27] sin is lying right here that church when
[48:29] they open that door
[48:30] it's canaan to confess that demon spirit
[48:32] is going to creep in
[48:35] it's going to slowly creep into the
[48:36] house and it's going to corrupt the
[48:38] house like death like the waters of
[48:40] separation right
[48:41] once one thing dies in there it corrupts
[48:44] the whole atmosphere
[48:47] paul said they'd creep into houses lead
[48:50] silly women let us stray i'll say other
[48:52] silly men too
[48:53] right let's not put it all on women it's
[48:55] there's a lot of men that are pretty
[48:56] corrupt as well
[48:57] just as many right
[49:01] but i like it you know i like i like
[49:04] jesus on the road to emmaus
[49:06] he walked with a guy the new gentleman
[49:08] cleopas and his friend for six miles
[49:10] and then jesus makes he pretends like
[49:13] well i gotta go
[49:14] guys and what do they do they beg him
[49:16] they say
[49:17] come in the house come in and eat with
[49:20] us please come in
[49:21] that's what jesus wants us to do tonight
[49:23] praise god god
[49:24] go home with me amen let me take that
[49:27] word let me take that song i heard at
[49:29] church let me take it into my house
[49:31] praise god
[49:32] let the holy spirit come in here and not
[49:34] just creep in here
[49:36] but flood in here praise god amen praise
[49:39] god
[49:41] but satan likes to slowly creep in and
[49:44] get through the door right and just come
[49:46] in and
[49:46] just change a couple little things here
[49:49] and slowly pervert until the house is
[49:51] just
[49:52] void of the holy spirit void of
[49:55] repentance
[49:56] void of humility right void of holiness
[49:59] void of worship
[50:00] he likes to slowly creep in and do that
[50:03] but thank god we're creators thank god
[50:05] that he made us
[50:06] with the ability to cast down anything
[50:08] that's exalts itself against the
[50:09] knowledge of god
[50:15] jesus wants you to invite him in i
[50:18] remember i preached
[50:18] at albion for the first time i had
[50:20] people people were screaming women were
[50:22] screaming in that service
[50:24] and one of the sisters came up and said
[50:26] that's exactly what she needed she
[50:28] i said i said you stay right here she
[50:29] said i want revival i said you stay
[50:31] right here
[50:32] and beg him to come in and he'll come in
[50:34] she just prayed for two minutes but amen
[50:36] pretty soon she's screaming and crying
[50:38] and she thanked me after the service for
[50:39] it praise god
[50:41] i remember her name too i'm not going to
[50:42] say it right now but
[50:44] but see that's how that's how it was in
[50:45] other words god wants us desperate for
[50:47] change amen
[50:49] he wants us that he wants to know that
[50:51] he's loved he wants to feel our love and
[50:54] our desperation and our worship
[50:55] he wants to feel love because he's a man
[50:58] he's a husband
[50:58] and we're the wife the bride praise god
[51:02] it's a romance right it's a divine
[51:04] romance
[51:06] and he wants to feel love he wants to
[51:08] feel like you want to love him praise
[51:10] god
[51:12] i love you jesus amen hallelujah come
[51:15] into my bed on the way home come into my
[51:18] my office when i get home just come into
[51:20] my mouth come into my vocal cord
[51:22] come into my mind anoint me that lord
[51:25] that you're always welcome in my life
[51:27] amen
[51:30] you see iniquity slowly creeps in
[51:36] it's not quite noticed right away slowly
[51:39] changes things creeping into houses and
[51:42] the bible said they lead families
[51:44] into lustful indulgences
[51:47] that's in second timothy 3 1-7
[51:53] in church you know this they create
[51:54] their own traditions that they live by
[51:56] instead of
[51:56] living by the word they know what
[51:58] brother branham said now this is the sad
[51:59] part
[51:59] they know what brother abraham said they
[52:01] know what the bible said but they still
[52:02] do whatever they want
[52:04] oh okay well that's what brother jesse
[52:06] preaches or that's just what the brother
[52:07] preaches
[52:08] no if the bible preaches it then you
[52:10] need to do it
[52:11] praise god if the bible says it i need
[52:14] to do it and that settles it praise god
[52:18] in matthew 15 jesus rebuked the scribes
[52:21] and the pharisees
[52:22] he says you transgress god's commands
[52:26] by your traditions remember
[52:29] they were letting church they were
[52:31] letting the the jews
[52:32] instead of supporting their retired and
[52:35] old parents
[52:35] they were letting them give that money
[52:37] to the temple instead of their parents
[52:39] and they made it a tradition
[52:42] it was called a corbin now where did
[52:44] they get that tradition
[52:46] it was actually written in the book
[52:48] called the mishnah
[52:49] the the mishnah was the oral law
[52:53] that was passed down from rabbis uh
[52:56] about a hundred years or a thousand
[52:57] years after moses
[52:59] so about a thousand years after moses
[53:01] israel went to exile
[53:03] right they came out of babylon with
[53:05] their own
[53:06] oral law this is what we remember about
[53:08] what moses said
[53:10] now they had the law but they had their
[53:12] own book trying to understand the law
[53:15] that was the problem their their book
[53:18] their book their bylaws their
[53:20] denominations
[53:22] their creeds their traditions that was
[53:25] wrong
[53:25] they should not have taken the misha and
[53:27] in that mission it said well you can do
[53:29] this
[53:29] you don't really have to obey the word
[53:31] of god and jesus said when you do that
[53:34] your worship's invade oh god help us to
[53:36] live by the pure
[53:38] words of god not to add our ideas or our
[53:41] interpretation
[53:42] let's just obey the simple humble
[53:44] complete word of god for today
[53:47] oh god and i was thinking about that
[53:50] this week amen in the eighth chapter of
[53:53] that book i challenge everybody i go
[53:55] through every doctor and i preach in
[53:56] that book
[53:57] and i said i challenge anybody to show
[53:59] me where it's outside the word and in a
[54:01] year and a half i haven't got one person
[54:02] challenging me
[54:03] whether that's the perfect will of god
[54:05] or not because it wasn't me
[54:07] it was god's word it's not a traditional
[54:10] man
[54:10] dressing modestly isn't a tradition of
[54:12] man it's a tradition of christ
[54:14] amen amen i put that challenge in there
[54:18] and all i hear back is crickets you know
[54:21] why because nobody can stand against
[54:22] god's word
[54:24] praise god and in church when you stand
[54:25] with god's word you're standing on the
[54:27] winning side
[54:28] i'm glad to be standing on the winning
[54:30] side praise god
[54:32] and i've had different i've had my own
[54:34] uh
[54:35] gym teacher from elementary read my book
[54:37] brother amen she's probably 70 now
[54:41] and she had nothing to say about it she
[54:42] just said well i don't i don't want to
[54:44] live that that's what she told me on the
[54:45] text
[54:46] she read the whole thing the day it came
[54:48] out
[54:49] talk about sincere and thank god she had
[54:52] an open heart to read it
[54:53] and i've had my own family members that
[54:55] read it and say nothing about it
[54:56] so see the challenge has been issued out
[54:58] the word has gone forth
[55:00] and the word fights for itself praise
[55:02] god amen
[55:03] we're to defend it but really the word
[55:05] defends itself hallelujah
[55:09] nobody says it's not it's sad but it's
[55:11] just like that person who didn't have
[55:12] the wedding garment on
[55:14] i offered the challenge i said anybody i
[55:16] said proof convince me of sin
[55:19] show me where i've gone wrong in this
[55:21] book show me where god's word about
[55:23] modesty is wrong
[55:24] and nobody can convince it of sin
[55:26] because it's right hallelujah
[55:29] right now i'm in exchange with a brother
[55:30] from the uk actually a 16 year old
[55:33] brother
[55:34] he sent me about 40 emails i can show
[55:36] them to you
[55:38] and every time the word is right all
[55:41] these questions all these things about
[55:42] this
[55:43] and you know thighs and and shoulders
[55:46] and breasts and
[55:47] tattoos and jewelry every time the word
[55:50] is right
[55:51] and i said sir why you emailing me so
[55:53] much he said because you're a real
[55:54] pastor
[55:55] he said joe ossi won't email me back
[55:57] benny hinn won't email me back none of
[55:59] these guys
[55:59] email me back but you'll email me back
[56:01] and he says you got a gift to teach
[56:02] god's word
[56:03] i said well praise god that wasn't me
[56:05] that was you saying that
[56:07] but let me say it like this god's word
[56:09] will always overcome
[56:11] amen and god's word understand amen and
[56:13] church that encourages me
[56:15] because i know we're standing not on the
[56:17] the shifting sands of man-made creeds
[56:20] we're standing on a rock amen a silent
[56:23] rock of god's word
[56:25] that cannot change has never changed and
[56:28] will forever stand
[56:30] amen that's right
[56:33] and i forgot about that challenge i
[56:34] placed in there but it was the holy
[56:36] spirit that wrote that book not me
[56:38] i got proof of it too they tell me that
[56:40] you see
[56:42] but see it's not a man-made creed like
[56:44] the mishnah
[56:46] every modern church creates their own
[56:48] mishna they just call it
[56:50] the assemblies of god doctrine or the
[56:53] cma
[56:54] by-laws like i was talking to some
[56:56] people years ago
[56:59] so sea turtles now we know the first
[57:02] attribute of
[57:03] iniquity is vain beautiful religious
[57:06] acts
[57:06] created by your own tradition now we
[57:08] know our denomination started
[57:10] in genesis actually in satan's heart but
[57:13] right then it got down to earth
[57:15] and then it went cain's heart that's how
[57:17] you guys came in the message right there
[57:19] that's what it was about why we're
[57:20] against denomination
[57:22] why i think i preached why i'm against
[57:24] organized religion
[57:27] because it started there in genesis amen
[57:30] and god condemned it there but there
[57:33] thank god there was a true worshiper
[57:34] there
[57:35] there was an abel there there's someone
[57:37] who believed in the blood they have very
[57:39] the blood to cause you to come to the
[57:42] altar and weep for your sins
[57:43] and ask god to forgive you just like i
[57:46] did praise god
[57:47] amen that's a real revival that's real
[57:50] holy ghost religion praise god
[57:52] i think about that today we have had a
[57:54] revival anytime you get anybody to
[57:56] to have a new life and throw it on the
[57:58] trash that's revival
[58:00] thank god for the revival this bride's
[58:02] revival is still going on
[58:04] amen and if you haven't pushed the trash
[58:07] out of your life by crying well then
[58:09] you're just missing out on the revival
[58:11] but i love it praise god and it's still
[58:13] going on hallelujah
[58:15] amen that's right amen the brother
[58:18] said the denominations have not
[58:21] recognized
[58:22] the awakening of the bride the bride was
[58:26] sleeping but the shout went out behold
[58:29] the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet
[58:32] him
[58:32] trim your lambs amen the bride is awake
[58:35] she's trimming her lips
[58:37] she's having revival she's not sleeping
[58:40] she's awake
[58:40] trimming sanctifying getting ready for
[58:43] the procession
[58:44] of the rapture praise god amen
[58:49] i don't know about you but i'm having a
[58:50] revival all the time praise god
[58:52] pushing out the sin growing closer to
[58:54] god being more dedicated learning more
[58:56] about god growing in grace
[58:58] experiencing god's love and mercy in my
[59:00] daily life
[59:04] if you're not experiencing that please
[59:05] do please come to the altar
[59:07] like these two have shown us right like
[59:10] other ones have shown us
[59:11] please come to the altar and let the
[59:14] holy spirit
[59:15] wash all this trash out of your life
[59:17] praise god
[59:18] yo you'll be revived then you'll enjoy
[59:21] coming to church then
[59:22] hallelujah you'll enjoy worship you'll
[59:25] enjoy time with jesus amen
[59:28] because he done washed you made you
[59:29] clean
[59:31] that's right that's the first attribute
[59:33] they create their own
[59:35] vain religious creeds and go through the
[59:38] motions
[59:39] seconds oh i never set my timer brother
[59:42] okay 15 more minutes yeah
[59:46] i got to respect that because remember i
[59:48] pushed myself so hard i didn't have a
[59:50] voice really to preach
[59:52] i could barely squeak my way through
[59:53] that and i wouldn't i wouldn't do that
[59:55] again to anybody i don't want to put
[59:56] anybody through that
[59:57] awful uh experience
[1:00:00] now second what do they do the workers
[1:00:01] of iniquity what does it make what do
[1:00:02] you do like it did in cain and satan
[1:00:05] they would not abide in the truth and
[1:00:08] they despised it
[1:00:11] so they despised the truth and they ran
[1:00:13] from it
[1:00:16] satan did not abide in heaven right he
[1:00:19] didn't abide there
[1:00:20] he left his original heavenly position
[1:00:23] and cain left the presence of
[1:00:27] now god encourage you church that if
[1:00:28] you're still here you're in the presence
[1:00:30] of god
[1:00:32] hallelujah we know we're the prince of
[1:00:35] god amen
[1:00:36] why because it's a holy presence
[1:00:38] hallelujah it's making us live holy
[1:00:40] that's how we know amen
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:46] his holy presence promotes holiness
[1:00:51] and holiness is consecration or
[1:00:53] dedication
[1:00:54] or full devotion to one thing god
[1:00:57] almighty
[1:00:58] and his word
[1:01:02] so praying for my children i'm still
[1:01:04] praying for all the children
[1:01:05] i think i've cried out all the names of
[1:01:07] the church this week i think i did by
[1:01:08] god's grace but
[1:01:09] i didn't forgive me but i thought i did
[1:01:11] just praying that god will give each
[1:01:12] person a revival in their life
[1:01:14] a revival for the children salvation for
[1:01:17] the children
[1:01:18] sanctification for the children the
[1:01:20] baptism of the holy ghost for the
[1:01:22] children praise god
[1:01:26] remember cain left he went out from the
[1:01:28] prince of the lord
[1:01:30] and then we know john 2 says they went
[1:01:32] out from us because they were not of us
[1:01:34] if they were of us they would have no
[1:01:35] doubt continue with us
[1:01:37] but they had to be made manifest that
[1:01:40] they were not
[1:01:40] all of us
[1:01:45] now see church remember this the mark of
[1:01:47] the beast is already here
[1:01:49] that's what i'm trying to get austin to
[1:01:51] see the mark of the beast has it's been
[1:01:53] here the whole time
[1:01:55] right if if god's mark is here thank god
[1:01:58] it's here amen
[1:01:59] amen thank god the holy ghost is here
[1:02:01] amen amen
[1:02:02] but if god's mark is here satan's mark
[1:02:04] has to be here as well
[1:02:07] true
[1:02:11] now so see the mark of the beast comes
[1:02:12] on a person when they blaspheme the holy
[1:02:15] ghost
[1:02:15] or they they deny christ for the final
[1:02:17] time
[1:02:19] and god knows when only god knows when
[1:02:20] that is right
[1:02:22] only god knows now let's look at this i
[1:02:24] want to read it in three places
[1:02:26] it's called a reprobate mind in the
[1:02:28] scripture
[1:02:29] so romans 1 28 2 timothy 3 8
[1:02:33] and titus 1 16. three times
[1:02:37] paul calls this a reprobate mind it
[1:02:39] means a rejected mind
[1:02:42] my church did you catch that that means
[1:02:44] god is no longer going to accept
[1:02:46] anything from that person's mind
[1:02:49] he's rejected their human spirit god's
[1:02:51] not going to accept
[1:02:52] anything from that spirit or soul
[1:02:54] anymore it's fully sold out to satan
[1:02:57] he's rejected it there's no more desire
[1:02:59] in that person
[1:03:00] there's no remember the holy thirst
[1:03:02] they've they've killed that holy thirst
[1:03:04] and god's rejected it and instead
[1:03:06] they're just thirsting for the love of
[1:03:08] the world
[1:03:09] and god just with the reprobate mind he
[1:03:11] says i've rejected it
[1:03:12] i'm done with it so they won't stand the
[1:03:16] truth
[1:03:17] and they despise what is truth romans 1
[1:03:20] 28 please thank you sweetheart
[1:03:26] and even as they this is speaking of
[1:03:27] homosexuals and even if they did not
[1:03:29] like to retain god in their knowledge
[1:03:31] god gave them over to a reprobate mind
[1:03:33] to do those things which are not
[1:03:35] convenient
[1:03:35] now this scripture shows someone has to
[1:03:38] blaspheme the holy spirit before they go
[1:03:40] into homosexuality
[1:03:42] because god gave them over to a
[1:03:44] reprobate mind
[1:03:45] now there's some people that may do it
[1:03:47] we know have been rescued right
[1:03:48] different churches have people that
[1:03:49] testified they were homosexual but god
[1:03:51] brought them out
[1:03:52] thank god but in the majority of cases
[1:03:56] just like sodom and gomorrah
[1:03:57] the majority of cases they blaspheme the
[1:03:59] holy spirit because god
[1:04:01] god tells them over and over male and
[1:04:02] female male and female
[1:04:04] and they finally blaspheme that and god
[1:04:06] gives them over said fine do what's
[1:04:08] inconvenient do what's disgusting
[1:04:10] do what's hateful i'm giving you over to
[1:04:12] reprobate mind
[1:04:14] and church don't you know this i've
[1:04:15] heard a preacher preach it the black
[1:04:17] lives movement
[1:04:19] is really a homosexual trans movement
[1:04:23] are black lives important yes every life
[1:04:26] is important
[1:04:27] chinese lives matter right white lives
[1:04:30] matter
[1:04:31] right spanish life you name it
[1:04:34] every life matters but just go on i've
[1:04:37] gone on their website i saw it this week
[1:04:38] or last week
[1:04:39] black lives matter says they want they
[1:04:41] came to destroy the nuclear family
[1:04:44] so part of their agenda is to destroy
[1:04:46] man and woman
[1:04:48] and say a family can be anything a man
[1:04:50] and a man a man and a woman
[1:04:54] that's why they're rioting because
[1:04:55] they've got the spirit of sodom on them
[1:04:58] and that's what the men of sodom did
[1:05:00] they rioted is that right
[1:05:04] it's completely true you know somebody
[1:05:07] asked me for my school asked me to go
[1:05:08] march in the black lives matter and i
[1:05:10] emailed back i said no sir i said i'm
[1:05:12] not going to support that organization
[1:05:14] that organization wants to destroy
[1:05:15] nuclear family
[1:05:17] in other words they are out to destroy
[1:05:20] the family that god ordained
[1:05:24] and there's so much for it they're
[1:05:25] willing to destroy things
[1:05:27] because they they hate they don't like
[1:05:28] to retain they don't want the knowledge
[1:05:30] of god
[1:05:31] and they they despise it so much they'll
[1:05:33] fight against it they'll ride against it
[1:05:36] oh but they don't really realize the
[1:05:37] real weapons are not those bombs and
[1:05:40] those
[1:05:40] those gasoline bombs the real weapon is
[1:05:43] the word of god hallelujah
[1:05:45] this is the real weapon amen and we can
[1:05:47] pray and cry we can speak the word of
[1:05:49] god
[1:05:50] and this will fight more than all their
[1:05:52] bombs and their lasers and their guns
[1:05:55] this is a greater weapon because it's
[1:05:57] eternal
[1:05:58] amen so god help us to pray i pray for
[1:06:01] those people more than i ever have that
[1:06:04] organization started a long time ago
[1:06:06] but we pray for them now that god will
[1:06:07] save those who have not blasphemed the
[1:06:10] holy spirit
[1:06:12] if if black lives matter to them so much
[1:06:14] why don't they go to their local
[1:06:16] abortion clinic
[1:06:17] and why don't they tear that down
[1:06:19] because those black lives are being
[1:06:20] killed
[1:06:21] by the hundreds of thousands right
[1:06:24] why don't they go to the white
[1:06:25] neighborhoods or any neighborhood where
[1:06:27] there's an abortion clinic
[1:06:28] why don't they go there and destroy that
[1:06:30] because that's destroying lives
[1:06:32] satan comes to steal kill and destroy
[1:06:36] but god came that we might have life and
[1:06:38] have it more abundantly
[1:06:40] amen praise god it's hypocrisy sin is
[1:06:43] always hypocrisy
[1:06:45] satan is the the lord of this the god of
[1:06:47] this evil age
[1:06:49] destroying lives and destroying souls
[1:06:55] praise god
[1:07:01] the third attribute they deny the full
[1:07:05] power of the holy spirit
[1:07:07] iniquity workers are all about temporary
[1:07:10] feelings that's what they're all about
[1:07:12] they just want to go get a temporary fix
[1:07:14] now the sad part is
[1:07:16] uh what was that brother man said
[1:07:18] they're like a crow
[1:07:19] they can eat the good things and the bad
[1:07:22] things i'm glad i can only eat good
[1:07:23] things praise god
[1:07:25] right they can they can go they can go
[1:07:27] hang out with the church people and
[1:07:28] enjoy a little bit of preaching a little
[1:07:29] bit anointing a little bit of
[1:07:31] singing and praying but then they go out
[1:07:32] and they enjoy the things of the world
[1:07:34] as well
[1:07:36] they can enjoy both they're all about
[1:07:38] just a quick fix
[1:07:40] but see a christian's not about that a
[1:07:42] christian is about a permanent
[1:07:44] staying in the presence of god living in
[1:07:46] the holiness of holies
[1:07:48] living by every word that proceeds not
[1:07:50] the mouth of god
[1:07:51] not just a temporary uh not just a
[1:07:54] temporary state but with a permanent
[1:07:56] residence in the presence of god amen
[1:08:02] but not the workers of iniquity they're
[1:08:04] all about just a quick fix
[1:08:06] and you can ask that's what my cousin
[1:08:08] did who god delivered him but
[1:08:10] that's what he would do you saw him he
[1:08:11] would come to church and praise god
[1:08:13] he'd play the music but then after that
[1:08:15] quick fix of god then he'd go over there
[1:08:17] and he wouldn't be ashamed if i said
[1:08:18] that
[1:08:19] because that's what he was doing he told
[1:08:20] me and then he go right out and do the
[1:08:22] drugs again
[1:08:23] just see from back and forth see god
[1:08:25] doesn't want like a back and forth
[1:08:27] god doesn't want you tossed like waves
[1:08:30] god wants you anchored praise god
[1:08:32] amen god wants us anchored into his
[1:08:34] presence hallelujah
[1:08:36] amen stable but see the iniquity workers
[1:08:40] they deny the full power of the holy
[1:08:42] spirit
[1:08:45] you see they can do great miracles
[1:08:46] sometimes
[1:08:48] but they don't have the miracle of
[1:08:50] living a righteous life
[1:08:56] i love how stephen said it stephen said
[1:08:58] in acts 7 51
[1:09:00] stephen rebuked the high priest and the
[1:09:03] jewish council
[1:09:04] because they resisted the holy spirit
[1:09:08] he said because you stiff-necked and
[1:09:10] uncircumcised in hearts
[1:09:12] so you always do resist the holy ghost
[1:09:15] ah that church now look at that the holy
[1:09:19] spirit was
[1:09:20] constantly trying to get them to repent
[1:09:22] constantly doing miracles around them
[1:09:24] to try to get them to repent and yet
[1:09:26] they wouldn't yet they
[1:09:27] they despise the truth they despise even
[1:09:30] they despise the preaching of christ
[1:09:32] oh my god and they had the wrong
[1:09:35] attitude they wouldn't let the
[1:09:36] they would they would kick against it
[1:09:38] they would they would reject it they
[1:09:39] would turn away from it
[1:09:41] oh but stephen's an example of somebody
[1:09:43] fully
[1:09:44] submitted fully yielded fully
[1:09:47] surrendered to the holy spirit
[1:09:48] amen so much so we know he wasn't even a
[1:09:51] preacher yet he preached a powerful
[1:09:52] message before he died
[1:09:54] he wasn't even a preacher amen he was a
[1:09:57] deacon
[1:09:58] and he preached maybe a 30-minute long
[1:09:59] sermon there in the book of acts
[1:10:01] chapter 7 went through the whole history
[1:10:03] of god saved abraham and
[1:10:06] and then dave moses and david and
[1:10:08] solomon and he said but god
[1:10:10] has wants another house god doesn't live
[1:10:12] in man's houses
[1:10:14] god lives in the soul of man hallelujah
[1:10:17] he brings it down to that yet they
[1:10:18] resist it and he said you always resist
[1:10:21] the holy spirit
[1:10:24] so you see
[1:10:27] church if there's if we feel like the
[1:10:30] there's not enough power of the holy
[1:10:31] spirit that we need to get sincere with
[1:10:32] god
[1:10:34] right if we feel like there's there
[1:10:36] should be another channel i can go up
[1:10:38] let's get sincere with god let's say god
[1:10:41] show me
[1:10:41] where we're uh where i'm falling short
[1:10:45] i want the full power of god working
[1:10:47] through my life
[1:10:50] like i was happy to see it today
[1:10:51] somebody gave us a real
[1:10:53] or a nice real kind of new refrigerator
[1:10:56] and the guy that dropped it off i was
[1:10:57] looking through that i was like my this
[1:10:58] is brand new this is free
[1:11:00] i said praise the lord and looked at me
[1:11:03] and said oh this is going to be a good
[1:11:04] wine fridge
[1:11:05] and i said sir i'm a i'm saying i'm a
[1:11:07] christian i'm a preacher of the gospel
[1:11:09] i don't put wine in here i said i'm
[1:11:12] going to put kombucha in here
[1:11:14] and he started laughing he's like ah
[1:11:17] but you should have saw his face changed
[1:11:19] he went from wine to awesome
[1:11:22] see that's the power of christ amen to
[1:11:26] cast down anything that exalts itself
[1:11:29] against the word of god amen praise god
[1:11:33] just seeing the power of christ how many
[1:11:35] times did we wish we would have said
[1:11:36] something and we did it can we get any
[1:11:38] can i get an amen on that
[1:11:39] there's many times i wish i would have
[1:11:41] said something but i felt the holy
[1:11:42] spirit rise up with me and say he's not
[1:11:44] gonna say that in my house
[1:11:45] are you not gonna say that in my garage
[1:11:48] no sir i'm a man of god i'm a child of
[1:11:51] god amen
[1:11:52] yes i am praise god
[1:11:56] i want the full power of the holy spirit
[1:11:58] operating through my life
[1:11:59] not just a little bit i don't want to
[1:12:01] deny his power i want to let his power
[1:12:03] flow through me
[1:12:06] praise god
[1:12:10] how do we do that we obey the holy
[1:12:11] spirit we obey the holy spirit and the
[1:12:14] power of god flows through us
[1:12:16] fourth satan's children lie
[1:12:20] we might lie from time to time brother
[1:12:22] graham lied to our us but he said he's
[1:12:23] sorry
[1:12:25] but satan's children love to lie
[1:12:30] satan is the liar and the father of lies
[1:12:32] that's the fourth attribute
[1:12:34] of cain and satan so the fourth
[1:12:36] attribute of iniquity
[1:12:37] they lie all the time
[1:12:41] john 8 44 says that cain lied to the
[1:12:44] holy spirit
[1:12:45] in genesis 4 9. he said i don't know
[1:12:48] where abel is yet he knew the whole time
[1:12:51] people said i don't know where the holy
[1:12:52] ghost is i don't know where the truth is
[1:12:54] and they're lying they know exactly
[1:12:56] where it is it's in god's word
[1:12:58] amen it's preaching this church amen i
[1:13:01] don't know how to get closer to god
[1:13:03] i don't know how to make a rapture you
[1:13:05] liar it's god's word it's god's people
[1:13:07] it's in god's church
[1:13:09] judgment begins with the house of god
[1:13:11] amen amen
[1:13:13] liars like a man was
[1:13:18] emailing me this week and said uh
[1:13:21] i never felt god and there is no god
[1:13:25] i said sir i said when was the last time
[1:13:29] you were convicted of sin because that
[1:13:32] was god
[1:13:33] the bible said the holy spirit will
[1:13:34] convict you of sin
[1:13:36] any person that ever lied any person
[1:13:40] ever stole any person ever gossiped
[1:13:43] any person that ever cussed any person
[1:13:46] ever lost in their heart
[1:13:47] there was some conviction at some point
[1:13:50] because the law of god
[1:13:52] is written their minds and i
[1:13:55] said sir that was when you felt god
[1:13:59] and then when he emailed back he totally
[1:14:00] didn't even said oh he didn't even
[1:14:02] address it so i emailed him again i said
[1:14:04] answer that question because the bible
[1:14:07] said jesus said when the holy ghost has
[1:14:08] come he'll convict you of your sins
[1:14:10] oh thank god that we can feel the holy
[1:14:13] spirit
[1:14:14] when we fall short of god's glory but
[1:14:16] that we can leave our sin
[1:14:18] and we can be washed and walk with jesus
[1:14:20] and wash our garbage and make them
[1:14:22] spotless
[1:14:23] in the blood of the lamb praise god so i
[1:14:26] never felt the holy spirit yes you do
[1:14:28] all the time praise god
[1:14:30] they feel the holy spirit all the time
[1:14:32] anytime they're convicted they do it
[1:14:34] the only reason they don't is if they're
[1:14:36] blasphemed the holy spirit they took a
[1:14:37] reprobate mind
[1:14:44] he said how do you know god's alive how
[1:14:45] do you know the bible's right
[1:14:47] i gave him all the answers he avoided
[1:14:50] all those and went off on something else
[1:14:53] i said the bible's right how do you know
[1:14:55] you're right i said we got thus saith
[1:14:56] the lord that's how i know
[1:14:59] we've got the original faith of paul and
[1:15:01] peter and james and john we got the
[1:15:02] original gospel praise god
[1:15:04] and we see god do some of the original
[1:15:06] things amen
[1:15:08] that's right
[1:15:11] like god talking in your ears saying
[1:15:13] don't wear those earrings
[1:15:16] right like god's saying throw out that
[1:15:19] can of tobacco
[1:15:20] get rid of that yeah that wasn't me that
[1:15:24] was god amen
[1:15:27] it's god speaking to us it's god's
[1:15:29] presence there is a living god that will
[1:15:31] just listen to a still small voice
[1:15:35] satan's children lie
[1:15:39] most notably peter says in second time
[1:15:41] or second peter 2
[1:15:42] 9 most most often
[1:15:46] preachers lie they promise people things
[1:15:49] that they themselves
[1:15:51] never attained pull that application
[1:15:54] would you
[1:15:54] uh second peter 2 19.
[1:15:59] now by god's grace i've tried not to
[1:16:00] promise anybody anything unless it's
[1:16:02] something i've received myself
[1:16:04] i've tried to if i have if i promise you
[1:16:06] something and you haven't received it
[1:16:08] god forgive me i don't want to promise
[1:16:10] anybody anything

[1:16:14] to god's promise

[1:16:18] going to happen
[1:16:20] and i'll i i can't promise you'll be
[1:16:22] there but i can tell you
[1:16:23] if you obey god's word you'll be there
[1:16:26] because he said let whosoever will let
[1:16:28] him come praise god
[1:16:29] amen he promised that
[1:16:32] if we just meet his conditions he'll
[1:16:35] answer our prayers and he'll back up his
[1:16:37] promise
[1:16:40] if i can promise you you'll be delivered
[1:16:43] i can promise you you'll be filled with
[1:16:44] the holy ghost because it's happened to
[1:16:46] me
[1:16:48] god thank god amen
[1:16:51] thank god for the word of god look they
[1:16:54] promised them liberty preachers
[1:16:56] oh you'll be so free yet they themselves
[1:16:59] are the servants of corruption
[1:17:02] the whole time they're they're slaves to
[1:17:04] sin they're addicted
[1:17:06] to corrupt lives and yet they're
[1:17:08] promising everybody all these blessings
[1:17:12] from whom a man is overcome of the same
[1:17:15] as he brought into bondage i'm glad i'm
[1:17:17] not addicted to pornography by the amen
[1:17:19] because i can promise people you'll be
[1:17:20] delivered
[1:17:22] oh god i'm not addicted to video games
[1:17:24] anymore
[1:17:25] or movies because or sports because i
[1:17:27] can promise them
[1:17:28] god will deliver you amen i promised
[1:17:31] sister barb
[1:17:32] i said god will deliver you of
[1:17:34] cigarettes because he delivered me of
[1:17:36] cigarettes
[1:17:36] and she got delivered praise god amen
[1:17:41] i'm not promising people things that i
[1:17:43] don't know i haven't received
[1:17:45] the bible says be followers of them
[1:17:47] who've obtained the promises amen amen
[1:17:50] hallelujah
[1:17:54] thank god i'm going to close with the
[1:17:57] fifth one so just give me two minutes
[1:17:58] here
[1:17:59] a few minutes by god's grace there's a
[1:18:02] real good atmosphere in here tonight
[1:18:03] praise i feel really free in the holy
[1:18:05] spirit
[1:18:05] amen thank god i love that i love to
[1:18:07] feel free church that and that's the
[1:18:09] time when you feel free that's the time
[1:18:10] to receive god's blessing
[1:18:12] that's the time to speak god's word let
[1:18:14] the holy spirit flow through you praise
[1:18:16] god
[1:18:16] amen and get the victory by the grace of
[1:18:19] god
[1:18:21] the fifth one because the sixth one
[1:18:22] we've already gone over the sixth one
[1:18:24] was
[1:18:25] they have worldly sorrow instead of god
[1:18:27] they saw i preached out of
[1:18:28] a month or two ago i probably won't
[1:18:30] spend much time on that one on sunday
[1:18:32] what that's right we own well yeah we'll
[1:18:34] only have one service on sunday
[1:18:36] i gotta go to that graduation party lord
[1:18:39] willing
[1:18:40] so the fifth one what is another
[1:18:44] characteristic of the workers of
[1:18:45] iniquity they persecute
[1:18:48] and kill the righteous let's be careful
[1:18:51] who we're
[1:18:52] criticizing i've always tried to
[1:18:55] remember this
[1:18:56] speak about people as if they were right
[1:18:58] there standing right there
[1:19:01] god help us to do that because that
[1:19:04] would mean we wouldn't
[1:19:05] we wouldn't persecute someone or gossip
[1:19:07] about someone right to their face
[1:19:09] right but the wicked will persecute
[1:19:14] and kill the righteous lucifer accused
[1:19:18] heaven's leadership before fighting the
[1:19:20] war right
[1:19:23] cain committed the first murder rose up
[1:19:26] against abel's brother and slayed him in
[1:19:27] the field
[1:19:32] jesus christ said murderers will surely
[1:19:36] perish but he also said you're in danger
[1:19:38] of hell fire
[1:19:39] for harboring unjust anger against
[1:19:42] others
[1:19:43] if they never hurt anyone
[1:19:46] this shows us we can murder someone in
[1:19:48] our hearts even without committing
[1:19:50] the violent act let's stand to our feet
[1:19:54] musicians if you'll come you have a
[1:19:55] psalm in here
[1:19:59] you know i was telling malachi i said
[1:20:01] we're going to sing i'm a child of god
[1:20:02] yes i am at the end of service
[1:20:04] remember the amen saying it on the
[1:20:05] second psalm that's a beautiful song by
[1:20:08] the praise god
[1:20:09] i just felt like to sing that song i'm
[1:20:10] going to sing that song today
[1:20:12] i feel like to sing that it's nice to
[1:20:14] see the holy spirit give us a witness
[1:20:15] there praise god
[1:20:17] you enjoy the word tonight church amen
[1:20:20] that's why this
[1:20:21] this mystery is so important so you can
[1:20:23] see how does the antichrist spirit work
[1:20:25] it works like this so we do the opposite
[1:20:29] we value religious acts right
[1:20:32] we we always tell the truth don't we by
[1:20:35] god's grace
[1:20:38] we're not gonna lie
[1:20:41] we're not gonna leave the truth we're
[1:20:43] gonna permanently reside in the truth
[1:20:46] i'm going to stake my claim in the truth
[1:20:49] i'm not going to despise it i'm going to
[1:20:50] enjoy it
[1:20:51] i'm going to be thankful for it you know
[1:20:53] i had that the same guy that delivered
[1:20:54] that
[1:20:56] refrigerator today i'd apologize to him
[1:20:58] because when he was there the first time
[1:21:00] i got critical of the first workers that
[1:21:02] worked at our house
[1:21:04] i said my they left dents in the walls i
[1:21:07] said they left
[1:21:08] awful paint jobs and i was so critical
[1:21:09] and i was so condemned as soon as he
[1:21:11] left i thought oh
[1:21:12] god thank god that the holy spirit was
[1:21:14] there to convict you
[1:21:16] and so when he came we got you know just
[1:21:18] a little uh
[1:21:19] small talk and pretty soon i said sir i
[1:21:21] said please forgive me
[1:21:23] i acted like a christian shouldn't act i
[1:21:26] said forgive me
[1:21:27] i was critical of our first workers and
[1:21:29] he said oh no no it's a
[1:21:31] i said no sir i said please forgive me i
[1:21:34] should be thankful and i quote the
[1:21:35] scripture i said
[1:21:36] in everything give thanks for this is
[1:21:39] the will of god in christ jesus
[1:21:44] see church that's the power of the holy
[1:21:46] spirit just being able to recognize your
[1:21:48] sins and then make it right
[1:21:51] how many believe that yes
[1:21:54] i i lied right i was critic i was
[1:21:56] critical
[1:21:57] i should not have been i mean they might
[1:21:58] have made some mistakes but i should not
[1:21:59] have been so
[1:22:00] critical about it in other words i
[1:22:02] didn't tell the truth
[1:22:03] i was critical i made the reputation
[1:22:05] look bad
[1:22:06] but but today by god's grace christ was
[1:22:09] able
[1:22:10] to wash me clean i was able to do what
[1:22:13] was right
[1:22:14] instead of what was wrong
[1:22:18] how many would raise your hand say
[1:22:20] brother just pray for me
[1:22:22] that i will do the attributes of
[1:22:24] godliness

[1:22:29] us these revelations
[1:22:32] my he sent a prophet to give all these
[1:22:35] revelations
[1:22:36] and now the mystery of iniquity is laid
[1:22:38] bare before us
