all right brother praise the Lord wonderful brother yes sir God makes themself so simple so ordinary plain outstandingly ridiculous too full man's built brilliant brain Tyson salt and flowers or any drop of rain maeín scientific knowledge just missed the mark again the gospel seems so foolish it's preaching so insane to modern man's intelligence just goes against the grain God tests his man by his word the gospel to proclaim greatness and simplicity God's wisdom it contains so if you look for wisdom fair words to entertain overdone whistle philosophy means wisdom to obtain a living blade of grass man's wisdom can't explain God's height and simplicity reason fills himself the same and he put by inspiration of my Lord Jesus Christ amen franksen all our beautiful beautiful [Laughter] rays God amen praise the Lord amen appreciate that sir I was gonna save you didn't remember you can always tell us after service I know you that's how I am if I forget I'm remember right for service praise God we appreciate that brother God is in simplicity amen let's say on our feet here we'll get right in the word of God's here let's go to Revelation chapter 13 like to look at back of this revelation series tonight I was kind of seeking the Lord this morning and thought I should go this direction here tonight by God's grace Revelation chapter 13 I think we're just lord willing just read verses 1 and 2 I think that's about as far as I'd like to get yeah I think I'd like to just get there because that deals with Imperial Rome if you know brother Rams message or studied it real thoroughly you'll find verses 1 and 2 is Imperial Rome and then 3 down to 10 is pagan papal Rome so I wanted to look at Imperial pagan Rome tonight by God's grace let me love the Lord tonight you know it'll be connected to our live search I promise you know by God's grace it always is you know we if we look hard enough it always is like our brother just read God's always in simplicity praise God revelations after 13 verse 1 & 2 which one's shorter all right i'll read verse 1 that we'll all read verse 2 together and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy what an ugly creature verse two let's Rita on three ready one two three and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority amen let's have one more word of Prayer if you just bow your heads and word of Prayer if everything on your heart just making known unto God surely the God of all creation the God of the universe is here tonight by his Spirit and he like to meet the needs of his children father we just bow our heads we come reverently Lord God and we asked Lord that your Holy Spirit would speak to us thank you for the songs thank you for this poem Lord God reminding us of how simple Lord you are and how how close you are to each one of us as the book of Acts says as well Lord God that we might feel after you and look for your Lord God we ask that your Holy Spirit will speak to us through the Word of God take my thoughts Lord God and get rid of those and let let your thoughts be placed in my thoughts Lord God and I just asked that Lord Lord we'd all get in your spirit Lord God and we'd all be drawn into a lord God that our lives might be changed improve Lord God cleaned out father whatever is we have need of tonight Lord God give us what we have need of for your glory in Jesus Christ name the church said amen god bless you being seated praise the Lord well we're happy to have our visitor here brother Aaron's dad what's your name sir let's give Dave round Fog god bless you sir are a lot of good things about you sir that's what I'd say too if people say that about me god bless you nice to have you here tonight by the grace of the Lord so let's look at our Revelation chapter 13 you can switch over lady I do have some quotes on kind of paired you know as I was you know studying him praying this morning you know early think I was up about 450 this morning preparing I just had these different thoughts coming to me that I hadn't come to me for a little bit so I like to look at some quotes and some thoughts here about verses 1 & 2 so I believe this is part 1 yeah this part I'm sorry part 91 in the series here on book of Revelation and I did find a quote recently where brother Branham said he just he said he took a year and a half one time and preached every verse to his church in the book of Revelation maybe I can pull it up real quick if I could find it a year he said and a half I thought I'd saved it don't you just give me a moment me I thought I'd saved it on my document here but maybe not all right well I'll have to look it up later but I know he said he preached a year and a half straight just on the book of Revelation praise God and so we're getting there by the grace of God so let's look here now I'm gonna be preaching a little bit off the notes of the script that I wrote for the YouTube videos here that are been on YouTube and I wish I could do it but I got a message from a sister from a oneness Church and she was crying on the voicemail thanking me for all my YouTube video she said they came to her at such a difficult time her life she was single didn't know leaving three God's you know three persons then she said she lived off my youtube channel for a few years until she found her husband as now she said she's so happy she leave God's one she's baptized the name of Jesus Christ and that was just such an encouragement to me that God had placed those there for such a time as that and so we're thankful to that by God's grace but these notes like I said I'll be coming off this script that I wrote feeling led of the Holy Spirit I'd like to look at these symbols now in verses 1 & 2 let's look at the symbols and see how they're defined by the Holy Spirit now brother Branham tells us plainly that revelation 13:1 and 2 was Imperial in Rome so the tie I'll read that again and I sit upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and his great Authority so the timing of this is Imperial Rome now the Empire really started to flourish about 27 BC if you study history which was not long after the fall the Grecian Empire which was around 323 BC and of course I got those dates from Botanica but you can find them in any history book if you read history at all now remember this Roman Empire so these legs of iron which we'll get to in a moment stood for quite a few years you know all the way up to the fifth century AD so almost 500 years these iron legs well stood there so here's the picture again I don't mean to scare the children hopefully it's not too scary so children if it's scary quickly close your eyes but there's a beast that comes out and I like I just like how the the artists placed this because it's pretty close to Scripture the Bible describes all these animal different animal parts all gathered into one and this is the beast out of the sea now let's look first at a beast what a beast represents according to the Bible so a beast in the Bible is a kingdom we know that because of what Daniel 7:23 says the Bible said thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth Kingdom so beasts our kingdom of men upon the earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces now we know this is the fourth Kingdom or the fourth beast we'd say and it's Rome and the church said program said thus saith the Lord he said it will not be Russia that rules the world it'll be Rome thus saith the Lord so we don't have to wonder who this fourth beast is we know it's Rome now the sea so the Beast is a kingdom that's what these symbols represent the sea represents multitudes of people so a beast is going to rise above the sea which means a kingdom is going to rise up out of a large group of people and so this is found in Revelation 1715 and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the sitteth are people's multitudes nations and tongues praise God now I was looking this week at some of my notes and I remember that I found that there are over 22,000 Catholic parishes in the world and there's 1.3 billion Catholics in the world at least they can be counted which is 22 percent of the world's population so over a fifth of the people on this world are claiming to be Catholic right and then about another fifth of those are claiming to be Muslim so we can clearly see that Rome sits upon many waters and almost every nation receives diplomats from the Vatican almost every nation and so the only Kingdom that fits all the qualifications of Revelation 13 17 and 18 is the kingdom of Rome and so the beasts or man kingdom rises up out of many waters here in Revelation 13 1 and 2 so a beast out of the sea then represents that this beast was pagan Roman kingdom with the combined demon powers of the first three Gentile kingdoms all right so we looked at this not long ago but I get to guess we get to it soon here now the seven heads representing the seven mountains of ancient Rome the Bible said the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth the ten horns represent ten earthly kings now these kings are future kings the Bible tells us that revelation 17 the ten horns which thou sawest are ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as of yet so see the Bible proclaim plainly teaches that they have not received a kingdom but receive King power as kings one hour with the Beast so it's very striking that God gives this symbol of the beasts having ten heads that haven't even happened yet their future kings that will rule with the beasts for an hour my one hour right verse thirteen these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the Beast these shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire my boy this is some rough preaching here tonight not against the rod but against that false church shame in his the brides he's washed she's washed in the blood of God's own son amen that's right verse 17 of chapter 17 for God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will and to agree and give their Kingdom unto the Beast so they have their own human kingdoms and they're gonna give that power unto the Beast the Antichrist until the words of God shall be fulfilled praise God now I want to show you here the prophets revelation of this so you have a good understanding that this is all scriptural here look brother says in 1954 he says we've got two things under consideration now watch this beast it had four different characters in it if you'll take Daniel seven you who are marking it down Daniel 7 Daniel saw the same vision eight hundred years before this saw the vision he saw those beasts separate from one another in the beginning of the Gentile ruling so Daniel saw the separate bear the separate leopard a separate lion and then he said then they were all separate Daniel but here revelation 13 we we see them all united he said here they are John sing it at the end of the Gentile ruling all four of those beasts represented in one what does it mean by the Branum he said there's the same old Devils amen so what does the bear represent what does the leopard represent what is the line represent those represent Devils in human kingdoms race God demons that possess each Kingdom of the Romans down through Greeks and so forth on down through the Gentile dispensation has come right down and all met up in one beast and the church said Omaha Church dang the Book of Daniel used to be a great mystery to me the book of Revelation used to be a total mystery but once God opened up this message showed me the message showed us the message and gave us all these understanding Church we can look at the Bible and we can completely understand the Bible it's not it's not a mysterious book in that aspect anymore all these symbols have been interpreted and given to us that we might know the day an hour that we're living amen hallelujah and once we know the day in our living that we can live our Christian ought to live hallelujah amen and that you and I might go fight against that beast praise God not be conquered by the beasts but fight against the beasts amen hallelujah and how does it happen Church one soul at a time praise God one sword how we overcome amen now I jumped Boyd got real fast through my notes here I didn't think I was gonna get that through that vas so just a minute yeah let me go back to this and then we'll head back to the quotes now here's the picture I was speaking out I think I showed it last week to the line represented Babylonian época desert the bear represent the Medes of Persians now this was like the shortest kingdom that Medes a Persians took over Belshazzar we know that Daniel chapter 5 the sixth verse well which gets you a little bit the leopard represents the ancient Greeks and Alexander the Great and then the last one we don't know exactly what the beast looked like we just know he's got these iron he's got the horns and he's got the heads and all these things so but we know it's an iron tooth beast which is the Romans now bodiham said those same demons that were Nebuchadnezzar's crew they left that and they went and dwell on the Medes and Persians and the church said praise God those men died Nebuchadnezzar died Belshazzar not they all died but those demons just left those bodies and went and jumped in the Medes of perkins not and then there's Medes and Persians they were a route for a little while and then when they died then they all went on Alexander the Great and all of his men and they conquered the world like that they had such a Swift conquering that's why they're like it unto a leopard they just swept over the known world and he conquered the world in a matter of hardly any time at all right and then he got so drunk he died remember being alcoholic at 33 years old man said what a contrast one man had conquered the world at 33 and killed himself by alcohol he said what a difference Jesus Christ had conquer the world at 33 but he did it by love amen thank you Lord amen and that shows you and I if we were to conquer Satan we're not going to do it by mite or human power it ends in death but we're going to conquer by the love of God the baptism of the Holy hey man that's how you and I are gonna conquer not by might not by power like Alexander the Great oh c'mon but behind but by my spirit saith the Lord amen Oh hallelujah now church you know after that all those demons went on Julius Caesar right those other Roman famous Roman guys you know but that out for that we know we'll get to later next week that all those demons went upon the Roman Catholic Church is that right what a great revelation this was I wondered for years what does this mean what are these lines what's the leopard mean what's a bear represent what does the line represent all these things then the takes a prophet of God to come on the scene and show us exactly what's happened so let me say like this today I'm sorry Rome is the modern day Babylon if you understand that is that right right because there's original Babylon and this is just Babylon in another form right it's the same demon powers in another form and then the Alexander the Great the Grecians they're just the same demon powers in a different form now we have the same team askew imagine we're battling the same demons that Daniel battled amen hallelujah not therefore demons the same demons right let's see we've thank God we've got a little more power than Daniel because we've got the Holy Spirit praise God in the soul as a seal unto the day of our Redemption Amen Alleluia now god help us to pray three times a day like Daniel Haman god help us the crowd to God like Daniel credit to God for the sins of his country right where the sins of his father for the sins of his family god help us a crowd like that and we'll get the same results Daniel got Amen it's exactly right and that's what we've got by the grace of the Lord now I want to go back here just a moment before I get to that a lot faster thought it would go okay now I want to take a look and at this ironing clay here for a few moments by God's grace I mentioned this I think I mentioned it last was it Sunday no that's Wednesday I believe it was I was mentioning a little bit on the ironing place I wanted to take a little bit deeper look at that here tonight by God's grace so if you have your Bibles go to Daniel 2 33 35 because brother Branham says when you read revelation 13 you've got to understand where it fits in with Daniel chapter 2 because they go together those beasts you saw here they are the from Daniel are here they are in Revelation 13 so Daniel 233 by God's grace having trouble getting to Daniel they're earnest alright Daniel 2 33 35 well I think I've even have it up here alright now verse 33 his legs of iron and his feet part of iron and part of clay now it's strange I didn't know I was gonna go this direction so early this morning I thought I was gonna go some other direction so it's interesting so this beast saw this image a head of gold silver legs of sorry abdomen a brass their thighs of brass and it gets down to the legs and the legs are iron but the feet are iron and clay verse 34 now sauce till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces verse 35 then was the lion I'm sorry then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broke into pieces & became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor ah how powerful is our God you know to get rid of iron today you really got it it takes a lot to grind that up doesn't it to make it look like chaff when take a lot of power but God so great it just takes one stone amen amen one sounds like a shredder and it comes down it shreds everything up and it blows away like chaff by one stone amen what is it Jesus Christ the sword of his word comes out of his mouth hallelujah and rakes it up into a million tiny little pieces and it all blows away at Armageddon glory and the wind carried them away and that no place was found for them so the coming of Jesus Christ is so great that the king is a man the ways of man the day of man gets divided and broken up like the chaff that gets blown away from her from the wheat day ahead by the wind the harvest wind he's so great that he blows away all man's kingdoms and there's no place found for them a man I'm glad about that praise God I'm glad that when Jesus comes back there'll be no place for these crooked politicians that we got today thank God for a few of the good ones if they still can be good like brother man said every friend he had that went into politics got corrupted but thank God for the ones that can say uncorrupted if there are such a thing I don't know if there is but if there is may God help them but see Christ when he comes back he's saying this place deserves it doesn't just is that it's going to be and deserves to be ruled by someone who knows how to rule praise God amen and there's only word worthy to rule and that's Jesus amen there'll be no place found for these homosexual kings and governors right these baby murdering politicians there'll be no place found for them all amen but thank God there'll be a place found for those blood war Saints amen kings and priests upon the earth they meant there would be a playstyle for them in the kingdom of Christ amen and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth look at the power of this stone the stone comes down smashes the image of the image blows away like chaff and this stone starts morphing and growing and changing in this mighty mountain Oh transformers and all these shape shifter movies they all stole God's idea right from the Bible because one stone turned into this mighty mountain amen the morphing the changing what is it Church it's God is it's God changing his form amen gotta morph a hallelujah changing his form the great God changing his mask unlimited God hallelujah hey man he goes from a state he becomes this great mountain oh thank the Lord amen what a blessing Church what a blessing she we don't got to worry all these all these false churches we like we have to get mad they got their day coming you and I don't have to necessarily tear it down we're trying to tear it down in people's individual lives now we're trying to tear that iron.i their lives praise God but you and I don't the way about we have to be the one to do it God's gonna do it in God's time he's going to do it all these kingdoms are going to fall God is going to get a fresh start with this thing amen that millenniums coming hallelujah now let's go down to verse 41 now you're going to here by a couple scriptures that this stone was not Jesus's first coming it had to be a second coming right because this was Daniel was what five hundred years six hundred years before Christ some people say oh this already came and went we'd have to worry about this no this was speaking of the second coming of Christ because we saw in verse 35 remember in verse 35 there's no more place found for them right and then this mountain this this kingdom of Jesus Christ filled the whole earth and we do not have that right now there's actually no Nate hardly any nations if any that actually say they're a Christian nation our nation certainly is not Obama declared that himself right remember that was big news a few years ago they no it's not now verse 41 and whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as I sauce the iron mixed with miry clay alright so see here we see in that going back to the image here we see that he has strong strong he's ayran strong my and he has par aaron and part clay and notice it's miry clay okay because we know who the clay is who knows who the clay is protestants right the clay is protestants milligram says so the clay the Protestants have some pretty miry doctrine how many would say amen to that I go into quite a few Protestant churches their doctrines appear pretty miry right right Church it's not clear and clean it's not clear water like we get poured on us every service right Church it's not stagnated water right it's not dirty filthy water but all water is pure it's the unadulterated Word of God amen nein Tyree it's clear thank God for that but see the iron of miry clay are together the givers 42 and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken to see that's what it represents this Roman spirit is so strong but this Protestant spirit is kind of weak right kind of weak you don't see too many Protestant churches bawling out the Catholic Church do you what they want to talk about how wonderful their Pope is ma he's such a good man oh no not if he believes those things right so see it's partly strong but partly broken now the reason I say that church I'm not bashing Pope but listen he came to I was reading over his speech that he gave to Congress in 2015 hum remember when he visited September 2015 here's a man that's supposed to be God's voice and he comes and give this 45 minute lecture it wasn't a preaching it was lecture his main points were on cooperation unity and patience and all all these things that don't have really anything to do with anybody now if he was a real man of God I think we know what he would have said when he got to that pulpit he said let me take a text and he would have taken a text Oh Jerusalem Oh Jerusalem how often I would have hovered you but you would not and then he would have started there and like the Bible said he would if he'd have been a real man of God a real prophet the Bible was sent prophets are hewers he went start to cut in and he would have started at though at the root he would have laid the axe to the root of the tree they were to point his finger there at Obama for legalizing gay marriage and all those are those Supreme Court justice he would have stuck their finger in their face and say that's abomination that's from hell right is that our church PETA made a real man of God he would have done that but it shows he wasn't instead they afterwards they take pictures and they smile they step out and the First Lady and the president stand there with the Pope and they all look happy and everything like that you see because that woman that Roman Catholic Church she commits adultery with every nation under heaven she's not there rebuking them she's there praising them because she comes in by flatteries is that right church and she didn't mention that was 2015 I looked it up there were 700,000 abortions in 2015 and he didn't make mention one thing about abortion do you know there's been over 56 million abortions since 1973 when they did the rover straight row versus Wade and Church a man of God would his stuck in feet is fingering their faces and said you're guilty of the blood of all these children at least the 700,000 that year right what does he do he goes there Pat's him on the back how much you love you try to try to get along better try to try to be more unified try to try to cross break more any man of God would have said you bunch of generation of vipers is that right church huge snakes in the grass he said he would have said you're of your father the devil the evils that you did your father's did he would have ball them out that's why I say these things because it's the same demon powers just with a different manifestation with a white collar and a white jacket and kind of a half-smile like they care about you when you know they don't they're right not to see it partly strong and partly broken and it's verse 43 whereas thou sawest iron mixed with the miry clay they shed they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay ok so this is what brother have talked about here we'll get to some quotes in just a minute but see the Protestant and Catholic will always keep their kind of separate groups but the Bible tells us how those two are going to weaken the religious stability of the world they're gonna they're gonna weaken it by mingling themselves with the seed of men praise God isn't that what Rome does divide and conquer Romans got to get into the place first and then it divides and conquers right that's right look at verse 44 it doesn't want to bring that out here in order to do that one where's my verse 44 okay let me go back I forgot to do 44 Daniel 2:44 I thought I had a slide for that sorry about that and in the days of these Kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed amen so the stone could not have been the first coming because we don't see Christ's Kingdom great getting greater and getting bigger and Christ ruling over everything right we still see kingdoms of man which shall never be destroyed and to the key and the Kingdom shall not be left to the other people but shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever hey then I'll praise God so we know when that stone comes it's breaking up every Kingdom it's breaking up every man government it's breaking up every foul spirit praise God it's destroying every man-made speck of any type of rulership and it's setting up a holy theocracy can I say like that Hey sorry a god government amen yes a government where God is king amen oh yeah hey thank God that's our longing for church longing for God's kingdom to be here where God's the king amen over all the earth now he's over he's king over our lives right now right but we want to be king over everything thank the Lord amen what I'm looking for that brother there and I really am i oh ma a day when there's a real leadership all over the world oh my no matter which country you go to they all got the same rule this sweet Holy Bible right here amen this eternal Bible ruling the entire world amen now I tried to zoom in here and take out that horrible looking green iron creature there and I just trying to look at the feet for the kids sake you know they don't just see those in their dreams Hopi they don't agree I'll pray for them if they do now remember the beasts of Revelation 13 is just this statue but it's just all those demons all into one right so this is what we see here in the end time is iron and clay so the same demon powers never died they just move dwell and possess other men now I want to take a few moments unless there gets these quotes from brother branham here now bear with me this is serpent seed 1958 and she had in her hand a cup of the wine of her fornication and speaking of the Roman Catholic Church and she was giving it to the kings of the earth and she was the ruler over all the earth spiritually speaking that's exactly right there's not another look at we could go back to Dan you'll get the image look at the image the head of gold the Babylonian Kingdom brass or silver Medes a Persians brass Alexander the Great and so forth the Grecian kingdom then the Roman empires Eastern Western Rome the two feet and notice in these 10 kingdoms which exactly comes with those ten horns that was speaking of this morning in each one of those ten kingdoms that was suraíhs there was iron and clay mixed together and that iron come from the legs which was Rome and there's that streak of Romanism he says mix in every nation there is under heaven through the Catholic Church that's exactly right and they would not mix anywhere and they'd intermarry among one another the Bible said they would look at them today so God showed through the vision of Daniel that a streak of Romanism would go into every nation because it's iron and clay mixed together so roll that streak or can I say like this slither can I just say like that the Roman Catholic Church has to slather its way into every nation and every group it's almost there it's almost there they're slithering and getting into every group a nation like last year I had a little article from China and the church in China is now recognizing I think I told you was now recognizing the Roman Catholic Church and accepting them so you know you think oh they're so strong they're they're such a communist country well recently they just started agreeing with the Pope right what is he doing he thought they're fulfilling Scripture that streak of Romanism is getting into the country and it's can deceive every country you know what's happening we see it now look he said they'd intermarry among one another so the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant Church is interested in marriages right they're interested in marriages program said when the scripture says they're going to mingle they're seen among men he said the way they do it is through marriages and here's how brother Branham describes it your boy goes with the Catholic girl when they go to get married they have to promise to raise their children Catholic see vice versa see it's the break the power of the other but what is it the Bible claims the whole thing is a prostitute now what are you going to do that's right and how the sins of the people would be visited on the next generation now note Church Satan is trying to break the power of sanctification in the home your daily life this just jumped out me like a like just flashed out at me this morning as I was preparing I was like that's right that preaches about ten years ago this is how Satan breaks people's spiritual power he gets them to marry the wrong person right and then he goes in their home and with this dead religion he breaks and crushes their desire to serve God through a broken home I think sometimes we forget how powerful our homes can be don't you what's the power of this church how its how its how close you live to God in your house the success of this ministry the success of any ministry depends on how close we live to God in our homes because this this tells it to be plain the way this let me just say like the way this beast out of the sea is going to conquer people today is by marrying into their house can you imagine that beast picture back there can you imagine saying hey little guy come on in here would you like to live with me can you imagine that hey little guy come on in here I got some food for you can you imagine but that's what people are doing when they marry the wrong person and the church said when they marry a Roman Catholic or they marry an unconverted person right right Church yeah I'm not laughing making fun woman I'm just laughing imagine that guy coming in their house right that's what they're letting in and once that beast gets in it starts crushing your sanctified life right and program calls that a streak of rheumatism see a boy goes with a girl they get married they promise to raise them Catholic and listen we're not promising to raise people message we're promising to raise them to Jesus Christ if you understand what I mean because not everything that's message is really the Bible message okay right there's a lot of people that say their message but they're not Bible message now if we say we're gonna break so we're gonna raise them according to the power of the Bible message I'll say amen to that but not every church that says their message church is really a message church we know that so hope you understand what I'm saying it's a balance see Satan is trying to break the power of your dedication at home and I just want to linger on that as we close I'll give out give me about 15 minutes I don't want to leave this I felt let the Holy Spirit on this one I felt I felt LED of the Holy Spirit I wasn't looking for this this morning when I got up to pray read my Bible this kind of came right as I was in the process I'm like and I kind of know that's kind of how the Holy Spirit operates what kind of unexpectedly let me say like this you have a spiritual pop or in your house right now and Church only you know how strong it is is that right Satan knows people that are claiming to say well I'm a Christian of course as soon as you say those words your name goes on the book in heaven is that right as long as you believe that your name stays on the book brother Ram says as soon as you say I'm not a Christian I'm a filthy Christian he said then you'll start sinning after that right it's the power of your confession Satan knows when you say I'm a Holy Ghost old saying a Christian I'm a believer I believe in time message I believe all the Bible he knows you're starting to get power in your house and so he wants to break your power and the way to break your power Samson is to get you to go to sleep with Delilah in your house amen and the church said where did Samson lose his power in a house his power was broken as he spiritually slept and gave away his dedication in his house where's your power get broken in your house where does road RAM say the power gets broken in the house and their marriages praise God now that's for someone who's the backsliders sinning or somebody but a Christian who has a Christian Holy Ghost real home you've got a home like a beehive or a power house you've got a power house and you're the power in your wits all the chains and all the temptations and all the fiery darts that come against your home or all the box of snakes that come to your home you refuse it you cast it out and your house is a house of worship amen it's a house of power because you keep the same commands that are kept at the but at the house of God the same holy spirit we feel here and sincere and moves here is the same spirit that lives in your home amen and if not the power of your home is broken because that's all he wants to do is just break the power in your house how many parents can say amen to that amen I'm a parent too what's what's the whole strategy break the power of every home pretty striking isn't it pretty strike if this beast if this little cute little guy over here if he's gonna conquer the world and church he is going to conquer the world he almost has already conquer the world they've let Heisey conquer he conquers by conquering the homes and then they take that to the schools then they take it to the government building they take it to their false churches but he conquers the whole force Gordon brother branham he breaks the power in the in the unity of the family first all right is that clear look what he says next this is now earlier handwriting on the wall and how that the Roman they have their two different churches against the Gentile what would be Catholic and one Protestant iron and clay the iron of the Roman Catholic Church and the clay of the process how they wouldn't mix together but would mingle them seeds one marrying into the other and trying to break the power of the other one look how I keep saying it braking power braking power where our houses are supposed to be power house is a very not broken power in a house but power houses again Alleluia power houses our homes we live in the spiritual power house with Satan wants to break the power of the house just perfectly exactly how God said he would take place I love this one and that has come to pass just as perfect as could come to pass he says and every other promise of God will come to pass just as perfectly as that was some day we're going home to glory someday Jesus is coming amen so just as the iron and clay is mixed and given an iron streak into every home so is that stone going to come out of the mountain and so before that sort of the same thing before that Jesus is going to resurrect this bride to meet him in the air amen just as that one's gonna be fulfilled so as the good promise is going to be fulfilled as well oh thank you lord breaking the power breaking the power and how that last days when they broke up in these many different kingdoms and so forth to the toes there was iron and clay and it means the prophets head as much as thou did see iron and clay won't mix together neither will these cleave one to another but mingle them seeds in other words they'll marry into them trying to raise their children and break for the powers like that do you realize church that you and your children are supposed to be powerhouses for the kingdom of God we're supposed to have power we're supposed to have zeal we're supposed to have light people should be able to walk in your house and say my this place is spiritually on fire for the Lord shouldn't walk in and say well spiritually is did you not pay the light bill or you forget to pay the electric bill spiritually speaking right well it's knocking cold in here it shouldn't be knocking go h me warm and bright with God's Word but st. wants to break the power of the home according to the prophet of God and the way you have powers how you raise your children is that right either you raise children and it breaks the power of God or you raise them and it increases the power of God it depends how you raise them right that's that's what it says trying to raise their children to break the powers we're trying to raise them to strengthen the powers and you know how the the church does it they this is how their their false teachers did it I even have it on our video at school I let the kids see it every year there with all the Halloween and Easter all they've done is taken pagan pagan ceremonies and mix them with Roman Catholic ceremonies it's just a mixture just like this iron clay they just mix in together and that's the way the Roman and Catholicism does it today they go to church but then they mix and they let sin seep into their homes till it's a cesspool of corruption amen that's right to go to church on Sunday they'll take the mass or they go to Protestant church they'll take the grape juice or communion or whatever but then they'll watch dirty movies in the house right then they'll lie to each other amongst family members then they'll let sexual abuse happened amongst family members because they're not taking good care of their children like they ought to and pretty soon its corrupted pretty soon the power of God is broken in the house trying to raise their children and break for the powers and you know that's the truth I do I say a member of the band but ahold it's got and you people knocking down say oh it's wonderful it's not wonderful it's not how you raise the children how I raise my children is either allowing God's power to grow in their eyes or it's breaking the power of God in their lives and this is how the Beast dominates the entire world by breaking the home breaking the power of Christ in the home right because I preached here Fermi breaching here right with the this the sin from numbers nineteen waters the separation you've heard me preach it right if they if Israel touch anything dead in their tents they were cut off from public worship they're dead spiritually the only way they can get back into church is by going to get sprinkled and wash on the first day and on the fourth day and then the seventh right now I'm sorry third day then seven third day and that's how it is when people that a little lie or little evil things go on their home and they come to church and if they don't confess of that they get nothing out of church the next time and brother and preach that waters of separation praise God someone during one of the dad does a dirty job and steal some money from somebody if he don't confess that the whole family will come to church and they're spiritually dead they no longer hear the word of God praise God mom does some gossiping on the phone or mom does some gospel on Facebook or something like that and doesn't confess it it promotes the whole family and if they don't confess that it's gonna make everything in the home defiled and the church said that's right trying to break the powers 19:54 and today you see the Catholic and Protestants marry among one other trying to break the power down at every step and every Corey says this breaking the power in the home raise your children have to promise them to raise them this way or that being Catholic or Protestant we'll get to that after a few nights notice how that is how the other the strong of the iron dominated the other broken to pieces and shattered away but the lamb came asserted and the holy people in that day amen praise God the holy people will stand for a holiness in this day that's right and how that Roman power went through every nation there's not another power in the world and only one way can go through is through Catholicism the Catholic Church into all the world breaking out in there it's a marvelous great picture here and you Protestants just keep your shoes on just keep your shoes on because brother you're right with it he says so you sound like you take your shoes off and put up your shoes so see it's all Catholic there's no problem with me I'm process it but have to keep your shoes on he says you're right into it just as big as the rest of them let me say let me say like this message Church keep your shoes on because their churches like us that are just as guilty as the Protestants that their women cut their hair wear makeup let the men cuss and smoke and do dirty things like they ought to do let them lust the new evil things like they ought not to do let them give more to their jobs more they give to the house of God they let jobs and cars and homes become idols instead of putting God first place oh you see it all the time just go to big message church where they got a lot of rich people just go there you'll see it little family driving there they got two three kids they got a $60,000 you name it I forget the name of those one fancy Escalades all right now you tell me a family of three needs a $60,000 Escalade and they just run and so they just start to feel a little bit better than other people we're just a little bit better than other people then pretty soon they're their wives so I went a little you know the shorter skirts with you know the slits in the side because they're just a little more fashionable and notice that the the the women shoots can little bit tighter that family and you can start seeing you know forms of the body we shouldn't see in their bodies and the church said I've seen it I've seen it don't tell me I have it the priests turn I've talked to some of these families and they say well we can handle cable TV or we can handle Netflix or we can handle watching the Superbowl and and the NBA games we can handle watching these because we know we're spiritually strong enough I'm sorry Satan's done broke your power you're blind you're in need of some ice out of church is that right I've seen it you don't to tell me people have stood right there in the office and told me we can handle cable no you can't there's a reason they angel Lord told brother Graham don't you ever allow that in your house that right there's a reason because a little leaven leavens the whole lump just keep your shoes on brother you sisters just keep your shoes on don't ever think all we can send back it oh we got everything we're perfect we just do everything right that's your first sign you're falling back from God because the Holy Ghost filled Saints even when they got beat up in Acts chapter 4 they got beat up the Bible said they got it a little bit discouraged they went back and said oh God give us more boldness that we won't be scared to preach and teach in the name of Jesus Christ amen so that's the sign that somebody's really got the Holy Ghost when they get discouraged they don't get worldly they don't get complacent they cross to God and say give me more bonus for Jesus guys when they morning brother and I prayed to inside God annoy me with boldness to go pass on my book in school they went right into this room of a person I respect and I said I write and dig through the book and the person's got paint all over her face short hair pants and I said I said I said now we you may not agree with this but this is what I believe my wife doesn't wear makeup my wife doesn't cut her hair my wife doesn't wear pants and I said it right in front of somebody who had pants on makeup and short hair that's that we made a four I said if you're a Christian I love you with the love of Christ but I just felt led to share this with you and that was the most honest and humble I've ever seen that person look in my life I've been working there with them for over ten years and I felt such a Friends of the Lord I felt such boldness for the Holy Spirit hey amen now let another one I went another room I just walked right in there so I like they give you this and this person got really really shy and I said well let me explain now we get all of our vertebra or scripture from the Bible my wife and daughters just like this he said oh you oh gotta explain yourself to me you can live however you want I said yes sir I said I hope you'll read it and consider these things I said I believe the Holy Spirit will take you deeper if you search the things of God amen I felt such a boldness a church that's what we should do when we going to get struggles or trials the grill Christian doesn't fall away into a Backson condition they get more bone for Jesus Christ they say God restored my first love restore boldness help me to keep sharing and witnessing and teaching in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah that's right Lord hey man thank you lord now here's where I wanna kind of kind of come glows down with this look what the Bible says Church look at the Bible says now this is the marriage chapter if you know 1st Corinthians 7 it's the marriage chapter the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy and that beautiful church this is the total opposite of what we just read we read how the Beast mingles its seed in the homes and breaks the power and the children power broken the whole home becomes broken but Paul says if you've got one real Holy Ghost filled say in that home amen if you got one saint of God so devoted to God so since there before us so in love with God if you've got one Saint praying believe in God it will not get overcome by Satan but it will break Satan's powers and even sanctify the unbelieving one amen hyah that's right church what a difference isn't that does everybody see what go from what a difference religious Protestants which message believers are Protestants right if they're not born again if they don't have the Holy Ghost they may they can get broken and they can get discouraged by anything and they get weak and the power of the home is broken but if somebody's really got the Holy Ghost and I'll say like this really believes the message somebody that really believes the message which is the Word of God the power of their life will be so great for the air that will start impacting other people that don't believe in the house amen hallelujah you have to word and say I'm outnumbered how can I live a Christian life I'll tell you how hit the Cris bit the Christ in you then you can live the Christian life is that right there's one thing you really need it's important for a Christian life and I don't want to go too deep but it's Christ right it's Christ there's one thing we need for homes to be spiritual powerhouses its Christ amen hallelujah snot religion it's not just true traditions it's not routines it is Jesus Christ himself when he's in one person that house but one person's life will influence everyone else and that person's life will sanctify the other ones hey man how different from those denominational people brother hams talking about that their powers get broken and they can't save God they're so weak it's because they're not born again hallelujah is that right Church now it's so powerful brother sister it's so powerful whether it's a woman or man so see even a woman can't say well I'm a woman I'm supposed to be meek and quiet humble in my life I can't overcome my husband's unbelief you can't even say that because Paul said that a woman can do it too the husband can be sanctified by the wife yet she's making quiet yes she's sweet and kind but her her power so great it's so like as is she so she's so quiet but her life is so loud hey she's quiet but her holy life speaks so loud that it starts sanctifying her sending a disbelieving husband she's so quiet I love that sock Seymour right she's so quiet but she's so loud it's so out instead of getting angry at the husband she prays for the husband it's so loud it speaks volumes instead of cussing and stomping off and get mad all these things instead of that she gets more humble and goes about serving God in such a sweet manner it's so loud not only that now it doesn't sanctify the husband but now the Bible said else were your children unclean but now they're holy my goodness look at the power of a praying husband look at the power of a praying wife church even if the other one doesn't believe the believer can walk over there and pray for the children say in the name of Jesus Christ I clean these children for the kingdom of God God let them not be unclean and let them not be dirty even though they are on my dirty disbelieve in the husband or wife or another let them be holy and God in time will honor that prayer amen hallelujah I believe that with all my heart the iron and clay streaking into every home pushing into every home breaking their spiritual powers can't keep the word can't believe the word oh but the Holy Ghost is opposite hey men only ghost flows like water into the home washes it all out gives them power to live a godly life oh thank the Lord here's what sanctified means a believing husband can sanctify or separate they're fully unbelieving wife from profane things and dedicate to God can purify see living such a Christian life purifies people around you if you really stand if you stand on the gospel if you stand for what's right it will purify and clean out other people in your home that's what the scripture says it will purify what powerful effects of Christ in the home you need one thing to keep your house powerful that's Christ Christ it makes your children holy which is a most holy thing your children are not unclean and dirty when you got a real believer in the house your children are holy set aside you've got to believe church if you've got a spouse doesn't believe all the way or something like that you've got to believe that God has separated your children God has a plan for your children's life amen and homes on homes as Christians should not be broken down into chaos right broken down into compromise and not obeying the Word of God they should be strong in obedience Shrunk and faith strong and faithfulness to God's holy word amen I want to read this for our sisters here so now we got numerous mothers here tonight for four month for moms and maybe some future ones too we'll see how the Lord tarries father's 3110 who can find a virtuous woman for a price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life so look at look at her home she does good in the home her husband trusts in her she does good everything she does good for the kingdom of God for the glory of God it does good to her husband in the home he's not breaking the powers of the home is that dividing the home it's strengthening the home strengthening because the Bible says strength and honour are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come now sisters they're mostly over there here in the nursery but all the sisters right mothers she opened with her mouth with wisdom and their tongue is a law of kindness right so mothers let's be kind in the home I'm sure the moms were saying Amen over there you must have the law your law is this I'm always kind with my words the law of kindness when I speak I speak God's wisdom look at verse 27 proverbs 31 27 she looketh well to the ways of her household and she eateth not the bread of idleness he's that beautiful she Satan wants to break these powers right Satan wants women or mothers or even dads have the law of anger in the home right the love condemnation the law being critical in the home that's the law Satan wants to have that's how he breaks the powers he ever got over to a friend's house and they're married and they just bicker back and forth all the time you ever seen that I've seen different homes like at first exciting kind of seems like they're joking but after you stay a little while you find out that their peace these people are not joking they've got some serious problems there's something wrong and find out lay there was an adultery there was some evil sin that was done there was some Lying some just some evil things have happened in the homes or why would they joke like that why would they sub say something like that the powers of hold have been broken by the spirit by that iron crunching beasts right he is crushed and eat in their spiritual lives so they can't even love the very person they promised the love for the rest of their life right they took him out and said I love you from this day forth they put their hands in the Bible I love you no matter what rich or poor all these things made all these promises but Satan breaks the power of that promise Oh God help us to be Promise Keepers amen hallelujah Christians must keep their word so our sisters they open her mouth with wisdom their tongue is the law of kindness and they look well to the ways of her household she knows everything that's going on the house she's aware of that she's kind she speaks wise words to the children not foolish words wise words let's say into our feet I want to close with this I just want to remind our sisters of some of these scriptures I read now look what the Bible xico 19 now just take this thought a little bit with mothers my mother is like a vine in thy blood look at that planted by the waters she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters praise God the Bible said your mother is like a vine in your blood what the Bible said what's in your blood the life is in your blood is that right mother's role is so crucial that's why one encourage our mothers here now that's why I felt let the Holy Spirit that this must this wasn't my thought I didn't think so I thought was a Holy Spirit bring it to me to try to encourage our mothers that you have a great opportunity to strengthen the home and then when you're godly teaching and a mother's godly words and godly life are live before the children with such sweetness and kindness the law of kindness the law wisdom that wisdom is so ingrained in them it's like vines in their blood notice it didn't say like little birdies in their brains are you with the church when a mother lives a godly life she sanctifies the husband now that this believing husband and her children are holy because she has such a powerful holy anointing honor Amen hallelujah amen and her impact is so powerful that it's like her life is growing inside their blood amen but if not say we'll do everything he can to try to break that power in the home I showed you five quotes tonight Satan's trying to break the power through mothers and fathers we have to make sure Church we keep all sin out of our homes and in our lips even dads should be the law of kindness and wisdom is that right church if not Satan gets in the home he breaks down the home and pretty soon it doesn't even feel like God dwells there anymore pretty soon everybody's got their own tablet what you looking at yeah there's no more time for prayer or singing or worshipping God it's just wasted time instead of redeeming the time the time is wasted but a Holy Ghost filled Saint life is so powerful it sanctifies it impacts that say all the people they live with and the Bible said even a woman all by herself can sanctify an unbelieving husband and make the children holy one woman amen hallelujah how did a woman was thought to be so little value in the Old Testament right remember those women came up to Moses and said can we have our father's inheritance and most like sure you can have it but like they weren't even in the original inheritance they were thought so little up oh but God sees women as such a great tool for his glory amen hallelujah you young little girls God give us a church of small little girls right you little girls never underestimate how powerful your spiritual love is for God because the Bible says it's so powerful now of course you want to marry the right person but if it ever happen where you were didn't your life is so powerful could impact them now think how great if you have a husband and wife in one Accord think what great powers of God can be manifested in that house praise God and church and sisters don't ever forget this they prayed over Ruth and said the Lord make the woman that's come in that house like Rachel Leah

about 6 6 a.m. there's this new different thought started coming I'm like well this must be the Holy Spirit and then I thought ma this is so Kruk this is so critical this is and then I figured out there that's how they do it they mingle them seeds together in marriages and they break the power in the home Satan works by displaying spiritual power in the home so God works the opposite by strengthening the home with holiness oh I'm so thankful to be following Christ today so thankful for that ego anointing church aren't you helps you fly way above all that beast power that lion bear
