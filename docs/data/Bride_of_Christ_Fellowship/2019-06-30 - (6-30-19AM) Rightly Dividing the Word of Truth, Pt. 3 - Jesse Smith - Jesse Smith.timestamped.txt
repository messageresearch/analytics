[17:33] I never said that I would give you
[17:37] silver or gold or that you would never
[17:41] feel the fire with the stripper in the
[17:45] cold but I did say you ever walk through

[18:56] every time Annie my love will be an acre
[19:02] that you can hold on to this is the
[19:07] promise this is the promise that I made

[19:51] [Music]

[20:00] bitter kiss of death or have to walk to
[20:04] the Jordan to enter into rest but I did
[20:09] sit right on the other side then I did
[20:21] say I'll try every to cry but you know I

[29:27] basket around and you just bring it back
[29:29] up thank you sir let's go to 2nd Timothy
[29:31] here in our Bibles it's good to be with
[29:40] everybody in the house of Lord today 2nd
[29:42] Timothy chapter 2 we'll start at verse
[29:44] 11 of course it's special to have our
[29:47] visitors here Mike and Shirley let's
[29:49] give them around father he's God good to
[29:51] see them
[29:53] been too long brother sister it's been
[29:57] too long
[29:57] god bless you good to see you thank you
[30:00] buddy love you sir thank you second
[30:02] Timothy chapter 2 verse 11 I like to go
[30:06] back to this thought you know this week
[30:07] the Holy Spirit's been dealing with me
[30:10] about the word rightly dividing the word
[30:13] as I've been listening in different
[30:14] sermons and so I like to go to look at
[30:18] this scripture about rightly dividing
[30:19] the word and this is going to be part
[30:22] three in a series I started three years
[30:25] ago so I only preached two parts on it
[30:29] well I'll leave it there for a while
[30:30] and then as I noticed the scripture is
[30:33] coming to me this week I just seemed oh
[30:34] that's exactly the same thought so I
[30:37] didn't intend to make the wait between
[30:39] the parts this long but that's just
[30:42] sometimes how it happens so we like to
[30:46] look at verse 11 for there say Amen
[30:50] so I'll read verse 11 to 14 and then
[30:53] we'll will read 15 together it is a
[30:55] faithful saying for if we be dead with
[30:58] him we shall also live with him since
[31:01] important to die everyday right
[31:03] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[31:07] him if we deny him
[31:09] he also will deny us my if we believe
[31:13] not yet he abideth faithful he cannot
[31:15] deny himself of these things put them in
[31:20] remembrance charging them before the
[31:22] Lord that they strive not about words to
[31:26] no profit but to the subverting of the
[31:29] years now let's read verse fifteen
[31:31] together ready one two three study to
[31:34] show thyself approved unto God a workman
[31:38] that needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[31:41] dividing the word of truth now I'm going
[31:43] to keep reading myself or 16 but shun
[31:46] profane and vain babblings for they will
[31:49] increase unto more ungodliness
[31:51] so with false doctrine you're always
[31:53] gonna see people falling away from
[31:55] holiness and they'll go towards more
[31:58] ungodliness verse 17 and their word will
[32:03] eat as death a canker of whom is
[32:06] hymenaeus and philetus now what were
[32:08] these two brothers famous for they're
[32:10] famous for preaching verse eighteen who
[32:13] concerning the truth have erred saying
[32:15] that the resurrection has already passed
[32:16] the rapture already happened
[32:18] what do you mean the rapture the second
[32:20] coming Christ has already come back a
[32:21] second time that's what they were guilty
[32:23] of and overthrow the faith of some now
[32:28] like a verse so verse 19 now connects us
[32:30] to 16 with the ungodliness because
[32:34] nevertheless the foundation of God
[32:35] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[32:38] note them that are his and let everyone
[32:40] that nameth the name of Christ depart
[32:43] from iniquity so false teachers will
[32:46] always lead people into iniquity and
[32:48] ungodliness but the word of truth will
[32:50] lead us in the holiness and
[32:51] righteousness to live a life that
[32:54] matches Christ amen my god is busting
[32:57] the rimas word you may be seated here
[32:59] praise the Lord so I just got a text
[33:06] from brother Aaron he's at he's watching
[33:08] online today so bless you brother Aaron
[33:09] I got your text sir may God be with you
[33:12] as you're live streaming so we like to
[33:16] look at this thought now I'm just going
[33:18] to hold these up so you're going to see
[33:19] them later I'm gonna look at the duygu
[33:21] lot a little bit today
[33:22] we're gonna preach on that a little bit
[33:24] on Bible versions and the book that I've
[33:28] flipped through up now I'm not read the
[33:29] whole book but I've flipped through this
[33:31] book it's called which version is the
[33:33] Bible and this is a man who supports the
[33:36] King James only and I mean this is such
[33:39] a deep study I only got through like
[33:41] maybe 15 pages you know but because it
[33:44] says so deep so I'm gonna be referencing
[33:47] these off and on throughout the message
[33:50] but I want to look at these thoughts
[33:53] here and bring it down to you as the
[33:57] Lord's been dealing with me on some of
[33:59] these things but let's let's I got some
[34:03] quotes here let's start with some
[34:05] scriptures or some some quotes about
[34:07] rightly dividing the word so we can see
[34:09] how brother Branham kind of mentioned
[34:12] rightly dividing now these first few
[34:14] quotes are going to be review and then
[34:16] I'll get into the the new and fresh ones
[34:18] from today but you probably don't
[34:20] remember that sermon three out or three
[34:22] years ago anyway do you I don't remember
[34:24] maybe when you see some of the pictures
[34:25] you might remember but I was I was
[34:30] blessed as I was going over the the
[34:32] scriptures in quotes to kind of review
[34:33] this as we build up to you know the
[34:36] concordance the duygu lot and Bible
[34:38] versions I just want to spend a little
[34:41] time on this and let me tell you church
[34:44] this is so important and let me tell you
[34:47] why I'm going to show you the quote
[34:49] later where brother Branham says the
[34:51] greatest services he ever had in his
[34:53] life were the seven seals he said
[34:56] they're greater than any other services
[34:58] he said because it wasn't healing of the
[35:01] body he said but was it was revelation
[35:04] of truth and so this idea of rightly
[35:10] dividing the word is that same idea you
[35:14] are revealing the truth to God's people
[35:16] and that's why whether someone gets
[35:19] healed physically or not here this
[35:21] morning we can have just as a sincere
[35:24] and holy we say experience with God
[35:29] because the same God that heals the body
[35:31] is the same one who wants to reveal
[35:33] truth to your spirit
[35:35] and if we're not born again once you
[35:37] give you eternal life and your soul day
[35:40] that a portion of his own life amen
[35:43] and that's why we never get discouraged
[35:46] you know denominations may have bigger
[35:48] revivals no doubt they have bigger
[35:49] conferences than we have right they have
[35:53] more testimonies than we have of you
[35:55] know miracles and things like that no
[35:57] doubt about because they have more
[35:58] people there but that doesn't mean they
[36:01] have the genuine truth of Almighty God
[36:04] it doesn't mean they have genuine
[36:06] godliness so let me give an example I
[36:10] hate to call names but you know Joel
[36:11] Osteen has the biggest church in America
[36:14] in Texas Houston Texas
[36:15] it's the largest Church and if you go on
[36:18] their website they have at the bottom at
[36:20] least I last time I was there they have
[36:22] testimonies of people being healed all
[36:23] the time but if you go listen to the
[36:26] pastor and his interviews he accepts all
[36:28] homosexuals and will not be says I will
[36:32] not preach against it and I would go to
[36:34] any homosexual wedding now Church just
[36:39] take a moment look at that you have all
[36:41] these people gather there with all kinds
[36:44] of miracles people being healed of this
[36:46] healed of that lupus and cancer all
[36:49] these things but yet they let the sin of
[36:52] homosexuality in the church now which
[36:56] one is Christ welcome which you're done
[36:59] the compare that church to our little
[37:00] church today they got to have four
[37:02] services you know to to meet all the
[37:04] millions of people or a thousand people
[37:06] that come in and the millions on
[37:07] livestream which churches Jesus gonna
[37:09] gather at the one who's rightly dividing
[37:12] the word of God because a word that is
[37:15] not rightly divided eats as tankers as
[37:19] gangrene and so see they get under the
[37:24] anointing of the music and they think
[37:26] about Jesus and and and the hot and the
[37:29] rain falls but guess what it falls here
[37:32] to you amen and so doing that at a time
[37:38] when it falls they reach blessing and
[37:40] they could say thank God for the rain
[37:41] thank God for the rain but their lives
[37:44] if they're the wrong seed they produced
[37:46] the wrong corrupt fruit
[37:48] but our lives when we get the rain it
[37:51] produces the real fruit of the Holy
[37:52] Spirit amen amen
[37:57] now we've been talking about speaking
[38:00] the word no brother Diggs preached two
[38:01] sermons on speak the arrival of the
[38:04] spoken word and we've been we've been
[38:05] saying how the greatest I'm sorry the
[38:09] way to get victory is by speaking the
[38:11] word and and I've been saying this you
[38:15] know I remember I came up after brother
[38:16] Diggs and I've come up after brother
[38:18] Keith and different ones when there's
[38:19] where everyone's saying speak the word
[38:21] that's true but we must speak the right
[38:24] word we must speak the word that God has
[38:27] given to us and brother Graham tells us
[38:30] when Jesus was here on earth he was God
[38:32] he was God in Christ reconciling where
[38:34] himself he never used any of his great
[38:36] gifts when he meant saying he said it's
[38:37] written man should not live by bread
[38:39] alone it's written thou shalt not tempt
[38:40] the LORD thy God he defeated him that's
[38:43] it that know this sure Satan knows it
[38:46] too but you got to know rightly divide
[38:49] the word of God brother man did not
[38:52] speak squirrels until the Holy Spirit
[38:55] said speak what you want amen
[38:57] and so it is with us like we you know we
[39:00] have these five cancer patients but we
[39:02] can't speak their healing until the Holy
[39:04] Spirit tells us to speak their healing
[39:06] we can pray and ask for God to reveal it
[39:09] we can pray and ask for blessings and we
[39:12] got all these but we can't speak it
[39:13] until God says it's the say at the Lord
[39:17] and now this is where we get down to
[39:19] real Christian maturity right because
[39:22] Jesus you know Satan was quoting Psalm
[39:24] 19 about oh if you cast herself off the
[39:27] angels of God will bear you up he was
[39:29] quoting the word but Jesus had to
[39:31] rightly divide the word of God he had to
[39:34] choose the right word that thou shalt
[39:36] not tempt the LORD thy God and so
[39:39] searider dividing the word is showing
[39:41] important and so crew
[39:44] pinnacle and when I live our daily lives
[39:48] right we got to quote the word and
[39:50] that's how this is how we'll overcome is
[39:51] by quoting the word the member we had
[39:55] and thank God we have this promise Jesus
[39:57] said he told his disciples when you're
[39:59] brought before councils and and judges
[40:02] and lawyers
[40:03] he said don't meditate on what you will
[40:04] say for the spirit of your father will
[40:07] teach you what to say in that hour amen
[40:10] praise God now when I spoke the word
[40:15] when oh oh who said he spoke the word
[40:19] for his nephew to have the baby remember
[40:21] everybody spoke the word now I was so
[40:23] nervous
[40:25] there's a good anointing there but he
[40:27] had the word he spoke the word he said
[40:29] God heard your prayer you're gonna have
[40:31] a baby and they did and then I spoke the
[40:36] word you know when I prayed over my my
[40:38] co-worker that they're gonna have a baby
[40:39] and I spoke the word over my friend's
[40:41] dad that Simon went and prayed for that
[40:45] he was going to be completely well the
[40:46] way I look at that is that when we spoke
[40:48] that Jose and when you've spoken the
[40:51] word of God in your life what happened
[40:52] is that you got under the anointing of
[40:55] the Spirit of God and so for you to
[40:57] speak it it wasn't a big thing because
[40:59] it was God's anointing amen
[41:02] it wasn't you trying to work it up it
[41:04] was the Holy Spirit flowing through you
[41:06] just like God speaking through this
[41:08] microphone you know God you just got
[41:11] real close to God and God spoke and said
[41:13] you're gonna have a baby right or you're
[41:16] gonna the gods going to bring that man
[41:17] out of the hospital that's what happened
[41:19] you weren't afraid because you were
[41:21] walking in the spirit amen
[41:23] Jose wasn't afraid to say that although
[41:25] I was a little nervous because I wasn't
[41:28] he I was the one God was going to use at
[41:30] that moment so see now we see it the
[41:34] importance that this is how our overcome
[41:36] Satan is by speaking the word for that
[41:38] hour rightly dividing the word now so
[41:45] this helps us to understand why brother
[41:47] Aaron would say something like this
[41:49] where we need preachers to rightly
[41:51] divide the word every service he said to
[41:55] bring up faith in Christ there's
[41:56] ministers
[41:58] that's the most important thing of the
[41:59] day is a good god sent preacher I admire
[42:02] them and their gift is far beyond
[42:04] anything could be done into anything
[42:05] else is a preacher a man who knows how
[42:07] to rightly divide the word of God it's
[42:09] the most wonderful gift in the world is
[42:11] to be a minister now why would he say
[42:14] this church he'd say this because of
[42:16] what we read for our text hi may Gnaeus
[42:19] and this other man I forget his name now
[42:21] was preaching that the the raptures are
[42:24] come and the Bible said they overthrew
[42:28] the faith of some see the preachers got
[42:33] to know he's got to be anointed by the
[42:35] right spirit and give the true
[42:38] interpretation of God's Word which he
[42:40] got from a prophet and if God give me an
[42:44] interpretation the Prophet didn't say
[42:46] that interpretation if he's a man of God
[42:48] will line up and agree with everything
[42:50] that prophet said his mother haven't
[42:53] preached every verse in the Bible right
[42:55] he didn't preach out of every single
[42:57] book in the Bible so what you've got to
[43:00] do is get under the same anointing that
[43:02] those are owes on the Prophet which is
[43:04] the Holy Ghost and then if ministers get
[43:06] into that anointing then everything they
[43:08] preach will agree with everything the
[43:10] Prophet said then you're not adding to
[43:13] the word because you're just saying what
[43:15] the word already says you're just
[43:16] revealing more of the same relation see
[43:21] this is why it's the most important
[43:23] thing is because the minister is either
[43:25] going to give you a rightly divided word
[43:27] or it's going to be a cankered word or
[43:30] which means a gangrene and now the
[43:34] church the sad part is that they could
[43:38] have a gangrene word let's go back to
[43:39] the Joel Osteen Church for just an
[43:41] example they can have a gangrene word
[43:43] and yet still jump in praise and their
[43:46] spiritual lives are corrupted right
[43:50] because they love homosexuality that
[43:52] smoking is okay and I've heard him say
[43:54] over the pulpit himself on livestream
[43:56] it's okay to marry two and three and
[43:58] four times they say that's okay God
[44:00] gives you a new beginning God's not
[44:02] going to give you a new beginning that's
[44:03] outside his word amen
[44:06] that's a Satan beginning Amen that's
[44:08] that's a devilish beginning but
[44:11] I will only give you a new season a new
[44:13] anointing a new new revival he'll only
[44:17] give you a new season when it lines up
[44:19] with us were a man but that's their
[44:23] keyword new beginning and fresh
[44:24] anointing and all these things now they
[44:26] do get that when they're worshiping and
[44:28] things like that but when they go
[44:30] contrary when they teach contrary to the
[44:33] Word of God that's no longer the right
[44:35] anointing it's not the right beginning
[44:37] it's the beginning of the end amen right
[44:40] it's the beginning of end of their
[44:42] spiritual because that's what the Lord
[44:44] says to bring the wrongly interpreted
[44:48] word create spiritual disease and that's
[44:52] right but amen Isaiah could say their
[44:54] tables are full of vomit because you
[44:58] look at their worship leaders women in
[45:00] high heels
[45:01] showing off their cleavage you know
[45:02] short skirts on and painted up like a
[45:06] barn you know and saying that's holiness
[45:11] that's their holiness that's worldliness
[45:14] that's sexuality that's sin and list
[45:17] that's lust of the eyes and God's Word
[45:20] will not lead you to such a place amen
[45:24] now for salvation all depends do they
[45:27] know better or not that's what it all
[45:29] depends on because the Bible said where
[45:31] there's no word or the Bible says in the
[45:33] book of Hebrews where there was no law
[45:35] there's no transgression and brother and
[45:39] brother Jose he's a man again brother
[45:41] Jose that's why a man said there can be
[45:43] Catholics that can be saved because they
[45:45] didn't know better where there's no law
[45:48] there's no transgression right that's
[45:51] why brother Han said that
[45:51] that's why though Jesus will save you
[45:53] know people for doing those six things
[45:54] in the book of Matthew 25 you know
[45:56] feeding the poor risen the sick in the
[45:58] hospital you know visit them in prison
[46:01] because they didn't know better right
[46:04] because of ignorance that's why they can
[46:08] be saved you know even preached on the
[46:09] mother harlot on Wednesday nights just
[46:11] hammering away huh but there's some
[46:13] people in there that don't know better
[46:15] and God's going to have mercy on some of
[46:18] them
[46:19] but few there be that find it over thank
[46:22] God that we heard the voice saying come
[46:24] out of her my people that you be not
[46:26] partakers of her sins and abominations
[46:29] and a worldliness and the lusts of our
[46:31] flesh in her eyes amen see that's why
[46:35] it's the most he's not worshiping
[46:37] preachers but is not trying to get you
[46:39] to worship a preacher but he's getting
[46:41] you to be thankful that God has four men
[46:46] and ignore them attain them and given
[46:48] you the same anointing to work in the
[46:50] truth of God amen that's what he's
[46:53] saying this not to exalt me or exalt any
[46:56] of the preacher no God will not share
[46:58] his glory with anyone but is to
[47:00] recognize the greatest thing you can
[47:02] have is the Holy Ghost save it and then
[47:07] their gift is to see you brother Mike
[47:09] unto the day of redemption and it will
[47:12] guide you into all the truth of God's
[47:14] Word a night all right so if we got that
[47:19] down that's a good start let me just hit
[47:24] a few more things before I get to the
[47:25] new things here I'm
[47:30] skipping ahead I know you don't remember
[47:31] this sermon I'm sure but remember
[47:32] there's three things about Rams that we
[47:34] must not do with the word and these
[47:36] three things cause spiritual gangrene to
[47:41] misinterpret the word you explain it
[47:43] incorrectly like with homosexuality or
[47:48] like with women and and and sexy clothes
[47:51] or men that Custance wear and commit
[47:55] adultery on their wives and things
[47:57] now misplace program said is to put in
[48:00] the wrong place and brother Adam said
[48:01] that's like Hebrews 13:8 where you say
[48:03] well Jesus isn't the same yesterday
[48:05] today and forever
[48:06] he used to do that but he doesn't do
[48:08] that anymore and then brother have said
[48:10] dislocate is the move out of position
[48:12] and the example he gives well he says
[48:14] what Jesus is not going to preach
[48:16] Moses's message or Moses not going to
[48:20] preach Noah's message because dislocated
[48:23] it see doesn't see there's three things
[48:27] you must not do and so high mania s' and
[48:30] let me read his name because I keep
[48:31] forgetting that guy's name philetus
[48:33] philetus
[48:35] they brought gangrene because it looks
[48:39] like it could be some of it could be a
[48:40] couple of these it's probably dislocated
[48:42] or misinterpret they put though they put
[48:45] the Millenial message in the wrong day
[48:48] amen see they said the rapture the
[48:51] resurrections past already and guess
[48:55] what you would you know which
[48:55] denominations do that the Catholics and
[48:57] Jehovah's Witnesses do that look it up I
[49:00] was looking up Jehovah's Witnesses
[49:01] doctrine this morning and I've read
[49:03] their articles today and I'm like man
[49:05] this looks like the millennium didn't
[49:07] know it - this morning they teach like
[49:10] everything's peace now that's and church
[49:12] we do have a lot of peace right in
[49:13] America but that's in America yeah a lot
[49:17] of countries don't have that but see
[49:20] they got so relaxed and their false
[49:22] doctor now they believe will get to a
[49:23] little bit Java's Witnesses believe that
[49:25] Christ came or the rapture took place in
[49:27] 1914 that's what they believe
[49:30] so anyways they believe we're in the
[49:33] Millennium so see and then the brother
[49:35] brand proves that the church age book to
[49:37] the Catholics believe that as well
[49:38] now they're having their millennium
[49:40] right now so see because they don't they
[49:42] don't teach a rapture
[49:43] Catholic Church does not teach the
[49:45] rapture they don't you know it so see
[49:49] they dislocated the word same thing I
[49:51] mean eosin philly philetus that they
[49:53] dislocated so it's kinda like they put
[49:56] they took this out and they put it
[49:58] somewhere else back here they dislocated
[50:01] it and of course you might you might
[50:03] even say this too they explain it
[50:04] incorrectly you might you might even say
[50:06] that now let me go down to this thought
[50:08] about philetus here just for us a moment
[50:13] now the Bible said we study to show
[50:17] ourselves approved unto God so see he's
[50:21] telling Timothy to do this so so this is
[50:23] what I do Keith him Randolph and brother
[50:26] Diggs and brother kam and brother Brooks
[50:27] other preachers we go and study and when
[50:30] we study gotta proves the word that
[50:33] we're going to preach himself because
[50:37] we're approved unto God that's why I
[50:40] study in prayer and fasting is so
[50:42] important before preaching because you
[50:45] go study and then God approves it ya go
[50:47] preach that son I'll say thank you Lord
[50:50] yes yes Father
[50:52] I'll go preach that well you know the
[50:55] devil say well some of the people don't
[50:56] wanna hear that well I got obey daddy
[51:00] devil say well that might drive some of
[51:02] the people out of church God says preach
[51:03] anyways son I don't want him here at
[51:06] your church you know or you know all the
[51:12] people don't need that in the whole and
[51:13] the Holy Spirit said yes they need to be
[51:15] healed they need to set free this
[51:17] doesn't fit your series but preach it
[51:18] anyway it's gonna set the people free
[51:21] yes so you first get approved unto God
[51:25] as you work in your studies it's work
[51:29] you're not ashamed of what you're
[51:31] preaching because you've rightly divided
[51:34] the word of truth see the Bible truths
[51:37] needed divided or cut accurately okay
[51:41] this was tight by animal sacrifice
[51:49] Testament sacrifices now all of them got
[51:51] cut but some of them did the burnt
[51:53] offering member the bread offering was
[51:54] never cut the burnt offering was brother
[51:57] Mike
[51:57] it was like Abraham I'm bringing my bait
[52:00] housing and all of it goes to you amen
[52:03] a burnt offering was total dedication
[52:05] I'm giving a far offering to God God
[52:09] gets all of it I'm not eating ever the
[52:11] priest nah this is all going to God amen
[52:14] amen
[52:15] hallelujah but some of those like the
[52:18] meal and the peace offering in the sin
[52:19] offering in the guilt offering some of
[52:21] those were cut and sometimes God got a
[52:24] piece the priest got a piece and you got
[52:27] a piece and that fits perfectly because
[52:31] sometimes we just if they're a burnt
[52:33] offering
[52:34] it's just I'm just laying on the altar
[52:36] God God all of this goes to you and
[52:39] other times you need the preachers faith
[52:43] did you go in with you something like to
[52:47] come lay hands on you lay hands on me
[52:48] brother you know huh
[52:50] sometimes you you know we need each
[52:52] other sometimes sometimes we leave here
[52:55] like Oh everybody got a piece of that
[52:57] sacrifice but other times this is just
[53:01] between God and me amen amen
[53:05] glory and that's when you lay yourself
[53:07] on the altar of God or you give some
[53:09] some offering to God and God alone
[53:11] receives all of it there's no connection
[53:15] anyone else that sacrifice is only unto
[53:17] God see now going back to this idea of
[53:22] divided God's truth are purposely
[53:24] scattered hid in the Bible God purposely
[53:28] does that to hide himself from the wise
[53:31] and prudent now that's what Jesus and
[53:35] Jesus thank God he this is the one time
[53:36] he rejoiced he's the man of sorrows but
[53:39] this is one time he rejoiced thank you
[53:41] Lord that you hid the truth all through
[53:42] the Bible now that's strange to us but
[53:46] that's what Jesus said thank you Lord
[53:48] that you hid it from these people that
[53:50] really don't want it came in and the
[53:54] Bible says the glory of God to conceal a
[53:55] thing it's a glorious thing to do for
[53:59] God to hide it like that God likes to
[54:01] play hide and seek he likes to play hide
[54:05] and seek but it's the honor so see this
[54:07] gives when God hides it it gives you an
[54:10] chance to be honored because he'll say
[54:14] come find me if you really love me come
[54:16] find you you really no fellowship with
[54:20] me it's an imitation so this gives God a
[54:25] way that he can honor you and I more
[54:28] than like let's say a megachurch because
[54:30] we've gone beyond the service level of
[54:32] God's Word and we prayed more we've
[54:34] sought God more but it's God we're also
[54:38] this is God leading us through his
[54:40] leadership it's God inviting us into a
[54:43] deeper world it holds me do is say okay
[54:45] men so there's really no glory for us
[54:50] because all we did was just obey what he
[54:52] said
[54:53] whereas everyone else turns it down and
[54:56] they think you can understand the things
[54:59] of God on a surface level now some
[55:03] people will like the thief on the cross
[55:04] all she had was a surface level
[55:05] understanding of Jesus but he knew Jesus
[55:08] was innocent but God still saved him
[55:11] because he judged the word right he saw
[55:14] himself as a sinner and he saw Christ as
[55:17] the Savior and God saved him amen
[55:21] remember he that answers a matter before
[55:23] he hears it it's folly and shame and how
[55:26] many people go to the Joel's megachurch
[55:28] and you know they have their preachers
[55:30] outside they're trying to get people to
[55:31] wake up to some of those things and how
[55:34] many of them really how many answer that
[55:36] matter before they hear it and don't get
[55:39] me wrong I don't I don't believe it's
[55:41] right you know to to hound preachers and
[55:43] to stand outside churches and and pick
[55:45] it and I'm not saying that but I'm just
[55:47] saying like when when it issue is
[55:49] brought to your attention do you
[55:50] consider it or do you cast it aside and
[55:53] all you should do what God leads you to
[55:55] do on it okay now
[56:01] dividing means to cut straight that's
[56:02] what it means in the Greek if I'm
[56:04] rightly dividing the word I'm cutting it
[56:06] straight it's a straight cut and it
[56:08] proceeds to straight pass it holds a
[56:10] straight course it's doing right to make
[56:13] straight and smooth to hand alright to
[56:15] teach the truth directly and correctly
[56:18] so when someone's rightly dividing the
[56:20] word brother Mike they're saying what
[56:22] precisely is the truth yes it's not
[56:25] father son only goes baptism is okay
[56:27] sometimes or it's okay to sprinkle
[56:29] something no it's always wrong the only
[56:33] right way is full immersion pronouncing
[56:35] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's
[56:39] just an easy example that we can all
[56:41] agree on and we can all say amen to that
[56:44] right because there's a lot of things we
[56:46] might not agree on all the way now
[56:52] here's the scripture about Jaime Gnaeus
[56:53] and philetus now I'm gonna skip to
[56:56] cankering because look when people start
[57:00] preaching false doctrine like I said it
[57:02] leads to iniquity which is doing wrong
[57:04] even though you know what's right and
[57:05] the ungodliness remember godliness is
[57:08] being reverent like God perhaps of
[57:10] godliness is being like God
[57:12] that means reverent and loyal faithful
[57:15] devoted and so they start losing some of
[57:17] the loyalty to the word and they start
[57:20] doing things that normally they wouldn't
[57:22] do now here this is important so here's
[57:25] the meaning of kanker it's a gangrene a
[57:27] disease by which if any part of the body
[57:29] suffering from inflammation become so
[57:31] corrupted that unless the remedy be
[57:34] seasonally seasonably all times and
[57:36] seasons hey thank God for the times and
[57:40] seasons amen anyway that's how we preach
[57:43] them 23:00 tonight just so you know the
[57:46] evil continually spreads so see false
[57:49] doctrine will continually spread it may
[57:54] be slow but it will continually spread
[57:56] eventually it attacks other parts and it
[57:59] last eats away the bones the bones so
[58:04] the structure right bones are structured
[58:06] back your backbone or your structure and
[58:10] give an example I remember I'll just I'm
[58:12] gonna call another name today Joseph
[58:14] Coleman and the seven thunders movement
[58:15] remember that okay well I was watching
[58:17] this week on some of their I was like
[58:19] what is this guy preach his major thing
[58:21] was he said the seven thunders are the
[58:24] seven virtues of the status for men and
[58:26] brother BAM never said that now he'd put
[58:28] two quotes together where it makes it
[58:30] sound like that but it's not that and I
[58:35] was watching their services and as soon
[58:36] as he would say thunder those guys would
[58:39] jump up and everybody would be going you
[58:41] seen it right yeah he's seen he's been
[58:43] around long enough I wasn't there you
[58:44] know what it was happening I was
[58:46] watching a video from like 2002 it was
[58:49] and as soon as he says the word thunder
[58:51] people are jumping and shouting and all
[58:54] these young guys are jump up they're
[58:55] shouting but talk to brother have on
[58:58] carry on out in New York and they're in
[59:00] the same city as that church and that
[59:02] church was filled with adulterous
[59:05] divorces money laundering and when he
[59:09] died in 2012 there was predictions he
[59:12] was going to rise on the third day and
[59:14] it came out thus saith the Lord in the
[59:16] church and he didn't rise again so see
[59:20] because he preached the raw and I he
[59:22] might have had I don't know he might had
[59:25] some truth but that doctrine wasn't true
[59:28] but man said the seven thunders he said
[59:31] are the voices of the seven seals
[59:33] it's the revelations contained in the
[59:35] seven seals brother Graham didn't
[59:37] mention anything about the stats for a
[59:38] man in the seven seals okay so they got
[59:42] it wrong but it looked good at the
[59:46] beginning but by the end of it by the
[59:49] 2012 it had spread to where now there
[59:53] was all this evil and his son was
[59:56] arrested of on Karen told me his son was
[59:58] arrested for stealing all hundreds of
[1:00:00] thousands of dollars from the church and
[1:00:01] all kinds of things in jail it was all
[1:00:03] over the news I looked it up it was on
[1:00:04] it was on the internet I saw the
[1:00:06] articles on the internet you can look it
[1:00:07] up so see there's a real blessing among
[1:00:13] us when we see our lives mourn to
[1:00:16] godliness when we see holiness reading
[1:00:19] and not evil amen
[1:00:22] when we see people you know when their
[1:00:25] hunger for God grows amen when their
[1:00:28] devotion to God grows Oh we're seeing
[1:00:31] something else we're not seeing angry
[1:00:33] we're seeing the Living power of God
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:36] we're seeing Holy Spirit grow amen we're
[1:00:40] seing that seed grow into something
[1:00:42] greater because you're born again the
[1:00:45] incorruptible see the Word of God and
[1:00:47] that will push out and bring forth the
[1:00:49] fruits of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:52] now church this is what's really
[1:00:55] striking when I was preparing gangrene
[1:00:57] only tax living things so that means
[1:01:01] people in Joseph's church or we can use
[1:01:03] even Joel scenes that means some of them
[1:01:06] had started out as Christians yes they
[1:01:09] had to bend because gangrene can't start
[1:01:11] on a dead thing it's got to be alive has
[1:01:14] to feed off of something so that means
[1:01:16] they started out they got saved right
[1:01:19] faith they got justified maybe virtue
[1:01:24] knowledge you know he started to started
[1:01:25] going up the highway but then at some
[1:01:28] point this gangrene set in right it
[1:01:35] can't live off something dead they had
[1:01:37] to have some anointing they had to have
[1:01:41] some type of and that proves like what
[1:01:43] brother have said Judas was genuinely
[1:01:44] saved he gently was confessing he
[1:01:46] generally thought he was going to be
[1:01:48] saved now let me say this it clear up to
[1:01:50] me this week too
[1:01:51] can a person lose their salvation if a
[1:01:54] person is predestinated the salvation
[1:01:57] they can never lose their salvation
[1:02:00] that's right so see the only way a
[1:02:04] person can lose your salvation is if God
[1:02:07] foreknew they were going to sell it out
[1:02:09] the Bible says cast it away
[1:02:11] the Bible says depart from the way but
[1:02:15] the person who's predestinated to
[1:02:17] eternal life amen
[1:02:19] a person who stays true to Christ can
[1:02:21] never lose his salvation amen because
[1:02:26] his name was written before the
[1:02:27] foundation of the world on the book of
[1:02:30] life and Jesus literally says I will
[1:02:33] blot your name
[1:02:35] right in the book of Revelation if you
[1:02:38] don't repent quickly so yes people can
[1:02:42] lose their salvation but it's because
[1:02:44] God for knew they were gonna forsake it
[1:02:46] anyway but you cannot lose it if you
[1:02:51] were ordained to it as many as we're
[1:02:54] Daniel I believed glory not cease of the
[1:03:03] teaching of false doctrines teachers I'm
[1:03:05] sorry if false teachers doesn't cut
[1:03:07] straight or clinched the nail it leaves
[1:03:10] something open at least something like I
[1:03:12] don't see quite understand and it
[1:03:14] reminds us of leaven 11 spreads and it
[1:03:17] corrupts the whole loaf so I think
[1:03:20] gangrene was very good choice by Paul to
[1:03:23] show to show how false doctrine works it
[1:03:26] works like 11 and it leavens the whole
[1:03:29] cause remember that was that who's that
[1:03:30] woman I hid those three measures in
[1:03:31] there she hid a father son Holy Ghost in
[1:03:33] there it has a Roman Catholic Church who
[1:03:37] was it and now look what they got look
[1:03:39] at their loaf now it's all 11 now I
[1:03:44] think I pretty much got the review so
[1:03:46] now I can move on here
[1:03:47] yeah so now boy get ready if you haven't
[1:03:52] heard this get ready here we go I'm just
[1:03:55] kidding I may say some things you know
[1:03:59] today that you've never heard before so
[1:04:00] bear with me bear with me I don't know
[1:04:05] because a lot of these things Church I
[1:04:06] didn't know till this week like
[1:04:09] specially with a die Glocke did you know
[1:04:11] this is a Jehovah's Witness book I'm
[1:04:17] gonna show it to you in a minute who
[1:04:19] published this brother Mike publishers
[1:04:22] read the W word their tract Society who
[1:04:27] published this show was witness so I
[1:04:33] didn't know that till this week now
[1:04:36] brother Brad mentions I think 29 27
[1:04:38] times so I'm gonna go through this but I
[1:04:40] may say some things that might shock you
[1:04:44] a little bit but just love me
[1:04:46] okay pray for me I've studied myself
[1:04:49] approved unto God don't walk out stay
[1:04:51] here to the end of the sermon trust me
[1:04:54] I've been here 13 years I'm not gonna
[1:04:57] preach any false doctrine but here's a
[1:04:59] picture of you know they got to rightly
[1:05:01] divide the sacrifice it first had to be
[1:05:02] cut and just to give you an idea so this
[1:05:04] is what a minister has to do a minister
[1:05:06] has to go in the presence of God and and
[1:05:08] offer it and he's got to he's got to cut
[1:05:11] it the way God says cut it like with the
[1:05:14] guilt offering you had to cut this part
[1:05:16] goes to the priest this the God this to
[1:05:18] the you know the fat always went to God
[1:05:20] so we got to cut the fat out that's
[1:05:22] gonna go to God and then you know the
[1:05:25] man takes this well so it is with the
[1:05:26] word there are certain parts of this
[1:05:28] that it has to be cut in the right way
[1:05:30] I can't preach certain things like
[1:05:33] against a women can preach you know I
[1:05:35] can't say man you can marry three you
[1:05:37] can bring polygamy back in the church
[1:05:39] that's not cut right that part doesn't
[1:05:42] go with the Word of God
[1:05:44] okay although although you could cut
[1:05:46] that out brother Mike because Abraham
[1:05:49] did that right but you can't place it in
[1:05:51] our day amen
[1:05:52] Larry you cut it out and this locate it
[1:05:57] that's gonna be wrong it's gonna cause
[1:05:59] this you see so I reviewed those parts
[1:06:05] now I mentioned this a few weeks ago
[1:06:07] brother Aaron really enjoyed this that's
[1:06:09] why I was gonna show it again but he's
[1:06:10] not here but he's live streaming so
[1:06:11] brother hope your volumes up here Jesus
[1:06:14] first coming had to be rightly divided
[1:06:18] see because here's a Bible you know
[1:06:20] here's your Old Testament there's Old
[1:06:21] Testament these two shelves New
[1:06:23] Testament so you know before all this
[1:06:26] also had to look at was these two
[1:06:28] shelves how are we gonna know the
[1:06:30] Messiah well God hid it in all these
[1:06:32] books not every book right but he hid it
[1:06:37] like in Jonah he hid it where the three
[1:06:39] three days and three nights in the belly
[1:06:42] of the whale amen but most people to
[1:06:46] know that you had to be you had to be
[1:06:49] around the man of God for that day the
[1:06:52] one who was rightly dividing the word of
[1:06:53] God and then he would say I'm gonna give
[1:06:56] you a sign amen
[1:06:57] as Jonas was in the belly of the world
[1:06:59] three days and three nights so on the
[1:07:01] son of man be in the heart of the earth
[1:07:03] they met Laurie
[1:07:05] it had to be rightly cut out of here and
[1:07:08] no no see without a spiritual mind they
[1:07:11] say oh you're blaspheming
[1:07:12] you'reyou're applying that you're not
[1:07:15] dividing that the right way but he had
[1:07:17] signs that vindicated maybe had he had
[1:07:20] the signs of indicated amen he said I
[1:07:22] only dude I wish my father shows me amen
[1:07:26] and so there's God give us the signs not
[1:07:29] only a brother branham like with will
[1:07:31] willie Upshaw you know you have we have
[1:07:33] William Upshaw's tract where he wrote a
[1:07:36] poem about brother Branham and he got
[1:07:39] healed brother he was in his wheelchair
[1:07:41] for 66 years
[1:07:43] he went to brother Rams meeting my mom
[1:07:44] saw a vision he spoke it across the pole
[1:07:47] the the microphone and the man got up
[1:07:49] and he wrote a poem about it and took it
[1:07:53] around the world and then we have his
[1:07:55] voice at one of brother Graham's
[1:07:57] meetings in 1951
[1:07:59] testifying about being healed and
[1:08:01] wanting to share his testimony of a
[1:08:03] pamphlet with Joseph Stalin and all the
[1:08:06] people are clapping you know they're
[1:08:07] rejoicing in other words God has
[1:08:11] infallibly proved that William Branham
[1:08:14] was his messenger amen and on top of
[1:08:17] that you put the word the seven seals
[1:08:19] the church ages all these things you put
[1:08:21] on and off of that you got a God called
[1:08:22] man but with Jesus he had all the signs
[1:08:26] plus he had the character amen now I
[1:08:30] just found this in a book years ago I
[1:08:32] saw a quotes Malachi you know what the
[1:08:33] Prophet said about Jesus you know John
[1:08:35] the Baptist coming Micah Isaiah Jeremiah
[1:08:38] Hosea
[1:08:39] Zechariah Isaiah now there's hundreds of
[1:08:41] scriptures that were referencing Christ
[1:08:43] but they had to be rightly divided so I
[1:08:47] just circled a few of them those right
[1:08:48] there so if you are going to recognize
[1:08:50] if you're living here before all this is
[1:08:52] written you had to just pull you just
[1:08:54] had to pull a few here pull there you
[1:08:56] know the the seat of the woman you know
[1:08:58] you had to pull Hosea you know talked
[1:09:00] about Christ Psalms his body won't see
[1:09:04] corruption brother amen you had to pull
[1:09:06] them all over the place it had to be cut
[1:09:08] and rightly divide the right way amen
[1:09:10] you just couldn't pick up one Birkin
[1:09:13] I'll pick up Nahum Neiderman say well
[1:09:15] another thing about the Messiah now and
[1:09:19] God doesn't expect you and I to memorize
[1:09:21] God didn't expect everyone to see all
[1:09:23] that what God expected was to see that
[1:09:26] God was with Jesus amen and that God
[1:09:30] anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy
[1:09:31] Ghost and he went around doing good and
[1:09:34] did good for everybody healing the sick
[1:09:36] raised in the dead and preach the true
[1:09:38] God amen because God the bait has to be
[1:09:44] on the hook Christ so God uses right to
[1:09:47] attract the true believer right and then
[1:09:52] all those that you know we're real
[1:09:54] believers they Peter said where and
[1:09:55] where are we gonna go when he start
[1:09:57] preaching the hard things about you know
[1:09:59] my flesh is my flesh is your meat my
[1:10:02] blood is your drink and 70 preachers
[1:10:04] walk away he said he said well do you
[1:10:05] want to go to he said how can we go
[1:10:08] anywhere we know God's with you amen we
[1:10:11] don't understand where all this way but
[1:10:13] we know the words anointing you hey man
[1:10:17] that's what we know about brother brand
[1:10:18] the word was anointing him and now we
[1:10:20] can see the way the main thing you and I
[1:10:23] man oh yeah praise God
[1:10:27] it's anointing us to holiness it's
[1:10:30] anointing us to miracles when it's time
[1:10:32] for that it's anointing us for the gifts
[1:10:34] when it's time for that but the main
[1:10:36] thing it's anointing us for is living
[1:10:38] the life of Christ
[1:10:39] hey godly sinless lot if they met only
[1:10:45] life because number that says great is
[1:10:48] the mystery of godliness God was
[1:10:51] manifest in the flesh and now he's
[1:10:54] trying to manifest in your flesh in your
[1:10:56] flesh in your flesh in you in my flesh
[1:10:58] that's what godliness is God manifesting
[1:11:01] through our flesh Amen Alleluia so I
[1:11:07] just circled a few but remember Jesus
[1:11:09] said the Bible said on the road to
[1:11:11] Emmaus he began at Moses and all the
[1:11:13] prophets in spite of them in all the
[1:11:15] Scriptures of things concerning himself
[1:11:17] so Jesus starts rightly dividing the
[1:11:20] word to them
[1:11:21] he pull a little bit out of Genesis
[1:11:23] Exodus Leviticus numbers or what a
[1:11:25] sermon that must have been no I'm the
[1:11:28] preacher preachers he began to preach he
[1:11:31] said to them these are the words which I
[1:11:33] spoke unto you I was it with you that
[1:11:35] all things must be fulfilled which were
[1:11:37] written the law of Moses and the
[1:11:38] prophets and the Psalms concerning me so
[1:11:42] all of that was in there so Jesus says
[1:11:44] there was a whole lot more that was just
[1:11:46] a real small sampling I just wanted to
[1:11:48] show people and then what I always say
[1:11:50] after that is that if Jesus first coming
[1:11:52] was like that brother Mike then you know
[1:11:54] the second coming he's gonna be an iPad
[1:11:56] too yeah but the beautiful part is now
[1:11:59] the beautiful part let me go back here
[1:12:01] the beautiful part now for the second
[1:12:03] coming is God compose scriptures
[1:12:05] although a man he can boast coaches from
[1:12:08] any book Old Testament New Testament and
[1:12:11] he can reveal how he's coming amen glory
[1:12:16] we know he's coming shout voice Trump
[1:12:19] but we don't know all the details behind
[1:12:20] that but I imagine there in the Word of
[1:12:22] God in types and shadows praise the Lord
[1:12:27] so we stay with the Holy Ghost he'll
[1:12:29] guide us into all that truth alright let
[1:12:32] me jump ahead back to where I was so the
[1:12:37] question is how far will we go for the
[1:12:39] truth because in at the feast of
[1:12:41] tabernacles Jesus cried out and he
[1:12:44] invited everybody to living waters just
[1:12:47] like we do we invite everybody we tried
[1:12:49] invite everybody we can I saw some
[1:12:51] Facebook post about having people repent
[1:12:53] that was really good sister I like that
[1:12:55] we argued on that book that more people
[1:12:58] this week I'm just trying to bite
[1:12:59] everybody you know some doubted and
[1:13:02] their excuse was that so what the Bible
[1:13:04] records their excuse was that
[1:13:06] well no prophet was going to come out of
[1:13:08] galley now church catch that they knew a
[1:13:11] prophet would come out of Bethlehem but
[1:13:14] they were never had the desire to ask
[1:13:16] Jesus personally if he ever lived in
[1:13:18] Bethlehem they say well we know he's
[1:13:21] going to come out of Bethlehem but he
[1:13:22] came out of Galilee like they didn't
[1:13:24] have the desire they didn't have the
[1:13:25] unction to even go ask him personally
[1:13:28] and sometimes that little fearful spirit
[1:13:32] falls on you and I we're we're scared to
[1:13:34] go I talked to some
[1:13:35] about a problem right we're just going
[1:13:39] to take what we know about a situation
[1:13:40] rather than go ask them about it and the
[1:13:43] church said everybody got quiet on that
[1:13:46] one because that's the truth
[1:13:47] it's easier just to assume and stay in
[1:13:50] your own little cocoon and and try to
[1:13:52] figure out what that verse is so it must
[1:13:54] be this that's that must be how they
[1:13:55] feel that must be what happened because
[1:13:58] I know this this but it's better to go
[1:14:01] ask somebody about it yes and that the
[1:14:04] one thing that's one thing they didn't
[1:14:06] do they just thought well I know he came
[1:14:08] out of Galilee so it can't be him and
[1:14:12] they failed to dig deeper they failed to
[1:14:17] dig a little deeper Church if you wanted
[1:14:19] to find some gold you're not gonna find
[1:14:20] it on the surface ha ha ha you gotta dig
[1:14:23] deep George ain't never like like job
[1:14:27] said Jones had god help us to find a
[1:14:29] vein of gold amen help us I find a deep
[1:14:33] place where there's lots of gold and
[1:14:36] where it's all kind of hidden under
[1:14:37] there let me dig until I find it amen
[1:14:40] people just don't hang around long
[1:14:43] enough they don't ask enough questions
[1:14:44] they're not as interested as they should
[1:14:46] be and God will hold him accountable for
[1:14:48] that because listen instead of devoting
[1:14:51] their time to Bible they go devote it
[1:14:52] for the sports games right they'll go
[1:14:55] devote it for drinking and getting drunk
[1:14:57] they go devoted to movies though devoted
[1:15:00] to family members right vacations
[1:15:02] they'll devote all of that time where
[1:15:04] they could be searching and seeking
[1:15:06] after God but instead they'll answer
[1:15:08] quickly they'll be a fool and they'll go
[1:15:10] off there and just try to have life and
[1:15:12] have fun all's they had to do was go ask
[1:15:16] Christ himself where were you born
[1:15:21] that's all they to do because remember
[1:15:23] the Shepherd's had already told
[1:15:24] everybody about it 33 years earlier
[1:15:27] they'd already brought the Bible so they
[1:15:29] broadcast it everywhere they went and
[1:15:31] Mary heard it but the difference was she
[1:15:33] kept it in her heart I remember what the
[1:15:36] preacher said I remember when they
[1:15:38] appreciate that one Sunday I remember
[1:15:40] that revelation I'm not going to lose
[1:15:42] that revelation
[1:15:45] I'm going to ask God God let me never
[1:15:48] forget that I don't want to be the same
[1:15:50] I want to believe what God's Word says I
[1:15:52] would believe what the Angels say I
[1:15:54] won't believe what God's prophet says I
[1:15:55] want to believe all the rising divided
[1:15:58] truth they meant Mary kept these things
[1:16:02] in her heart yes God reveal this to me
[1:16:05] this lines up with the word and no no
[1:16:10] doubt she could even look at I had Jesus
[1:16:12] in Bethlehem and Micah says I'm gonna
[1:16:15] have a baby in Bethlehem my life lines
[1:16:18] up with the word we can look at the same
[1:16:23] way Jesus said this Holy Ghost is to
[1:16:25] them that are in Judea and all them that
[1:16:27] are upon the face of the earth and it's
[1:16:30] for me honey Leah I wonder what that was
[1:16:34] for and the Lord's calling me amen
[1:16:37] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:16:39] call amen
[1:16:44] let's give this wealth sermon was I was
[1:16:46] studying I was talking about the
[1:16:48] concordance we were talking about the
[1:16:49] concordance a few weeks ago by the Amen
[1:16:51] this is kind of where it started it
[1:16:53] there's 11 times program talks about
[1:16:55] using a concordance I want you to catch
[1:16:56] this and we're get to the die got now
[1:16:58] just for a moment then we'll get back to
[1:16:59] the concordance now 1959 questioners
[1:17:04] answers service on the Holy Ghost now we
[1:17:07] got some very stiff questions here and
[1:17:11] we wanted to get right into them
[1:17:12] sometimes you guys bring me stiff
[1:17:14] questions usually there are text
[1:17:17] messages though there's stiff messages
[1:17:19] that's okay not really
[1:17:22] someone looked at all these books I had
[1:17:24] and I said well smart man only needs one
[1:17:27] so brother Ram Haddad I got a Bible and
[1:17:30] you've seen the concordance it's huge
[1:17:32] the concordance is like three of these
[1:17:34] Bibles so Bubba has walk in the
[1:17:36] tabernacle that morning he's got a
[1:17:38] concordance all these things they say
[1:17:40] well if you're a smart man you only need
[1:17:41] one book what a lie from the devil what
[1:17:47] a lie now for salvation you only need
[1:17:48] one book but if you're gonna answer a
[1:17:50] question and find scriptures that you
[1:17:52] know you know you don't have memorized
[1:17:54] you need some help
[1:17:57] he imagined me to properly God walking
[1:17:59] in church you got y'all yours your help
[1:18:00] and everything so a real man doesn't
[1:18:02] need an iPad oh really
[1:18:09] all the reside of my iPad is for a
[1:18:11] concordance and then to show you the
[1:18:14] scripture so you can see it with another
[1:18:15] sense not only hearing but seeing Church
[1:18:17] will have no excuse on the day of
[1:18:18] judgment you know generations they
[1:18:21] couldn't even see it like but we only
[1:18:23] get to see it we hear it too
[1:18:26] yes and me I mean I forget to touch it I
[1:18:31] don't taste it or you know smell it I
[1:18:33] can touch it I can see it and I can hear
[1:18:37] it
[1:18:37] we have no excuses there's a famine for
[1:18:41] the word of God this generation but let
[1:18:43] me tell you there's no famine here right
[1:18:45] now we're facing on God's holy word amen
[1:18:48] hallelujah we see it we hear we touch it
[1:18:53] we believe it amen he said I'm not a
[1:18:56] smart man she have to have a lot of them
[1:18:59] to look into well this is a dicot and
[1:19:02] this is a Bible and this is a
[1:19:05] concordance he were just going to ask
[1:19:08] the Lord to help us and direct us to
[1:19:15] answer these questions just according to
[1:19:17] his divine will and His Word so don't
[1:19:24] get upset if brother Jesse uses a
[1:19:25] concordance or you know I doubt I'll use
[1:19:29] ad I got but there might be one reason I
[1:19:31] use that I'll explain just a moment now
[1:19:33] let me explain the die guy here this may
[1:19:36] be kind of deep so I'm just warning you
[1:19:38] you might not remember this but just
[1:19:42] remember to stay with the King James
[1:19:43] okay can you remember that church now
[1:19:47] I'm not a bible thumping King James only
[1:19:49] all the time I'm not that yet well I'm
[1:19:52] getting closer all the time and here's
[1:19:56] the reason why because I go on these
[1:19:57] websites to see like the Bible version
[1:20:00] like ESV and I try to find what
[1:20:02] manuscripts did you use and they don't
[1:20:05] say I'm like
[1:20:09] so the only way to know or the only way
[1:20:11] to kind of know is to go to a website
[1:20:13] where they have all the versions and you
[1:20:16] can look up one Scripture and see it in
[1:20:17] all the versions which I use Bible
[1:20:20] gateway and search if I find one
[1:20:25] scripture from one version where it's
[1:20:27] missing part of that I'm never gonna
[1:20:30] reference that one again because jesus
[1:20:33] said if you take one word away or if you
[1:20:39] add one word the plagues are added to
[1:20:44] you or your names taken out of life now
[1:20:47] this gets real serious Church but listen
[1:20:49] I do believe people can be saved again
[1:20:51] I'm using this because it's scriptural
[1:20:52] where there's no law there's no
[1:20:54] transgression these people that don't
[1:20:56] know they don't know but behind it all
[1:20:59] behind all these Bible versions is money
[1:21:00] yes
[1:21:02] King James Version is is open to the
[1:21:05] public public domain but one of the
[1:21:10] reasons they do these new versions is
[1:21:12] they can sell to you make all kinds of
[1:21:15] money because we know the Bible is the
[1:21:16] most purchased book of all every year
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:22] now with the die got no this is what I
[1:21:25] show brother Mike it's the original
[1:21:28] Greek of the New Testament okay but it's
[1:21:33] published I'm sorry but it's from the
[1:21:36] readings it's rendered from it's the
[1:21:38] translation from the Vatican manuscript
[1:21:42] from the Vatican Library Church this
[1:21:47] gets into some strange conspiracy
[1:21:49] theories here where did the Jehovah's
[1:21:55] Witnesses get their original scrolls
[1:21:57] from the Catholic Church and church it's
[1:22:02] right on there it's on the website you
[1:22:04] can go watch I'll show it to you if you
[1:22:05] want and remember we just appreciate
[1:22:08] brother how all the death of all the
[1:22:11] people would be port was responsible for
[1:22:14] that the mother harlot man
[1:22:16] I mean there's just some strange
[1:22:18] connections and I'm I'm usually not a
[1:22:20] conspiracy theorist but but I just think
[1:22:23] it's interesting and we know what the
[1:22:25] Word of God says and we know the word
[1:22:26] can't be wrong so in other words who is
[1:22:30] the inspiration behind the dyg lot the
[1:22:33] Roman Catholic Church now if you read
[1:22:37] brother his message to which we'll get
[1:22:38] to
[1:22:38] he never Labor's on he never makes us
[1:22:40] the absolute he uses as a witch it still
[1:22:45] may be used as a tool to some degree but
[1:22:48] I personally will explain why or when
[1:22:51] I'll use it as a tool so that this is
[1:22:53] this is this dyg lot english translation
[1:22:58] from the vatican scrolls the matter of
[1:23:00] human ship scrolls okay scrolls and
[1:23:03] another name for the vatican manuscript
[1:23:05] is codex Vaticanus and this was used by
[1:23:09] Westcott and Hort now Westcott and Hort
[1:23:10] were two scholars and in 1881 they put
[1:23:15] all these scrolls together and say these
[1:23:17] are the scrolls we need to use to make a
[1:23:19] new version of the Bible I'm just trying
[1:23:21] to very simplify it now there's two ways
[1:23:25] here's the true path to the King James
[1:23:27] Version and here's a corrupt path
[1:23:30] now the Westcott and Hort which is what
[1:23:32] this is from the Westcott and Hort 1881
[1:23:35] that's where that vatican manuscript
[1:23:37] belonged to belong to them so Westcott
[1:23:40] and Hort took these scrolls the Vatican
[1:23:42] manuscript and they put him together and
[1:23:44] say we're using these now listen the
[1:23:46] ones they use were actually physically
[1:23:48] older than the other ones that they use
[1:23:51] so the paper itself was older but it was
[1:23:55] corrupted paper the words on the paper
[1:23:58] was corrupted so in that case it don't
[1:24:01] matter is what's older and matters
[1:24:03] what's right amen
[1:24:08] to see the code
[1:24:10] McKenna's was used by Westcott and Hort
[1:24:12] and they eventually produced the modern
[1:24:14] translations especially the NIV that's
[1:24:17] the big seller that's the big one so see
[1:24:23] the NIV the reason it's wrong it starts
[1:24:26] with the wrong path they start with the
[1:24:28] wrong Scrolls but the scrolls that we
[1:24:32] start with is called the Textus Receptus
[1:24:35] or the receive texts so the the Jawas
[1:24:42] witnesses found the vatican manuscript
[1:24:44] and they took that and they just did the
[1:24:47] New Testament now because there are
[1:24:49] Greek translations of the Old Testament
[1:24:51] just say no I know it's Hebrew but they
[1:24:54] do have translations from Hebrew to
[1:24:55] Greek so that's a little bit confusing
[1:24:57] so see but they they started with the
[1:25:00] wrong scrolls and so the dagger actually
[1:25:04] comes from the wrong scrolls they start
[1:25:08] with the wrong scrolls they interpreted
[1:25:09] in English it's the wrong scrolls now
[1:25:12] just so you know 7% of this of our texts
[1:25:18] our scrolls I say the holy scrolls 7% of
[1:25:21] the holy scrolls is taken out in the
[1:25:24] Westcott and Hort scrolls 7 Jeff Satan
[1:25:27] person 8 sit there's something like a
[1:25:30] hundred and forty thousand words in the
[1:25:32] New Testament in the the the right
[1:25:35] scrolls but the Westcott and Hort cuts
[1:25:37] off seven percent of that and if you
[1:25:40] take one word away and these and these
[1:25:43] guys the Westcott heart those guys were
[1:25:44] known to be immoral men too
[1:25:46] they lived all kinds of filthy lives you
[1:25:48] know sexual sins and all kinds and the
[1:25:51] very eyes cutting out and choosing the
[1:25:53] wrongs girls and it's okay to cut that
[1:25:55] out that's really those those words
[1:25:58] aren't on our older scrolls the very
[1:26:00] guys that we're doing that we're living
[1:26:01] gangrene lives now let me share this
[1:26:07] even though this William Tyndale a
[1:26:12] church
[1:26:14] was martyred at the stake in 1526 amen
[1:26:20] you can look this up online he was one
[1:26:24] of the main translators of the original
[1:26:26] manuscripts all the ancient copies he
[1:26:28] was one of the original translators and
[1:26:31] all these evil people during the
[1:26:34] Inquisition killed him and his last wish
[1:26:36] was Burton getting Bert his last prayer
[1:26:39] was God open the eyes of the king of
[1:26:42] England a man in other words a man have
[1:26:48] died to preserve the Bible that you and
[1:26:51] I believe today and it's even prophetic
[1:26:55] because the spirit of Jesus Christ is
[1:26:58] the spirit of prophecy amen and a little
[1:27:02] less than a hundred years later King
[1:27:04] James saw the vision he said I need to
[1:27:06] make a Bible that we that's all the
[1:27:08] truth and that we all need to agree upon
[1:27:10] it he said we got all these different
[1:27:12] bishops Bible Geneva but we need a Bible
[1:27:15] in the common language of the people
[1:27:16] amen
[1:27:17] so the Holy Spirit married to that man
[1:27:20] and raised the Bible that we have today
[1:27:22] amen hallelujah see but we got the right
[1:27:27] scripts we have the right texts I'm
[1:27:29] sorry scrolls our Bible comes from the
[1:27:32] right Scrolls that's why we can rightly
[1:27:35] divide the word of truth that's why
[1:27:37] they're going to miss it every time
[1:27:39] almost every time is because they start
[1:27:41] with the wrong scrolls you know so so so
[1:27:47] see this came from Westcott and horts
[1:27:50] collection of paper Scrolls
[1:27:52] papyrus scrolls and they just copied it
[1:27:55] over and they have this now let me move
[1:27:57] on now the best example of this that I
[1:28:02] found and I looked this up myself
[1:28:03] through Bible Gateway is Isaiah 14:12
[1:28:06] King James says how shall follow no
[1:28:08] heaven from heaven o Lucifer son of the
[1:28:11] morning now look look what he's called
[1:28:12] he's called son of the morning how art
[1:28:15] thou cut down from the ground which this
[1:28:18] week of the nation's now this was my
[1:28:19] favorite secondary Bible but I'm never
[1:28:21] going to use it again here's why because
[1:28:25] when they translate son of the morning
[1:28:27] say how are you falling from heaven Oh
[1:28:28] Daystar I'm never gonna use that one
[1:28:31] again because Peter caused Jesus the day
[1:28:35] stuck in 2nd Peter 1:19 yes now that can
[1:28:40] only be Satan because Satan wants to rob
[1:28:43] all the glory from Christ I will exalt
[1:28:46] my throne above the heaven I will be
[1:28:48] like the Most High
[1:28:49] so I will never reference the ESV again
[1:28:55] that was my favorite because I read
[1:28:57] online was somewhere it was a
[1:28:58] word-for-word translation but listen
[1:29:00] Church if it's a word-for-word
[1:29:01] translation and it's the wrong scripts
[1:29:03] it doesn't matter if you knew word for
[1:29:04] word or thought for thought it doesn't
[1:29:07] matter because you got the wrong text to
[1:29:08] begin with look what look what and I see
[1:29:15] NIV is so perverted how you fall forever
[1:29:18] the old Morningstar Jesus literally says
[1:29:20] I am the bright and morning star you can
[1:29:26] look it up go to Bible gateway type in
[1:29:27] Isaiah 14:12 I did this before I study
[1:29:30] myself approving the God and you can see
[1:29:33] that's what they do so let me say just
[1:29:36] plainly my our church if you're a vom
[1:29:38] your pastor stay with the King James I'm
[1:29:44] not a King James only thumper you know
[1:29:45] like you got a yeah I'm not I'm not all
[1:29:47] that but what I know it's the only
[1:29:49] version I'm gonna preach from and study
[1:29:52] from until I can find somebody that
[1:29:55] literally says this they're gonna say
[1:29:57] well Church we went back and we're using
[1:29:58] the same script Scrolls that Tyndale and
[1:30:01] Kover dale and you know and king james
[1:30:04] we're using the very Textus Receptus and
[1:30:06] i'll say praise a little hard yeah but
[1:30:08] then we're gonna watch and see if they
[1:30:09] take anything away I don't think that's
[1:30:13] gonna happen I think I think we'll be
[1:30:14] with King James rest of our lives maybe
[1:30:16] to the rapture so see Church that's why
[1:30:20] I'm preaching things I've never preached
[1:30:23] before because I feel like God has
[1:30:24] helped me to understand how to rightly
[1:30:26] divide the word of God and now when
[1:30:29] people tell me things I'm gonna say this
[1:30:30] like every year at Bible Club I always
[1:30:32] get asked you know there's children what
[1:30:34] what Bible versions are they saying I've
[1:30:36] said well I would try the ESV I'm never
[1:30:38] gonna say that again
[1:30:40] I'm gonna say I just only recommend the
[1:30:42] King James Version because it's from the
[1:30:45] right source scrolls the primary scrolls
[1:30:48] that comes from are the true ones and I
[1:30:52] can and then I say I'll say this I can
[1:30:53] show you where they take words away okay
[1:30:59] no the watchtower it's right here this
[1:31:02] this was published and I got it was
[1:31:03] published by the watchtower society and
[1:31:09] never said Jehovah's Witnesses can be
[1:31:11] saved yes they can
[1:31:12] just like Catholics just like Luther
[1:31:14] mint they can be saved right if they
[1:31:17] don't know better and they're not
[1:31:18] purposely walking iniquity and they're
[1:31:20] trying to live godly if they literally
[1:31:21] live a virgin life although foolish if
[1:31:23] they live a version life they can be
[1:31:25] saved but look what they believe I went
[1:31:28] on their website they believe in
[1:31:30] cessation this is the most dangerous one
[1:31:31] that's why I put it started they believe
[1:31:33] there's no more miracles they believe
[1:31:35] there's no more working of the Holy
[1:31:36] Ghost and when they do that many of them
[1:31:38] they crucify the Holy Ghost they they
[1:31:43] crucify Christ afresh and my wife has a
[1:31:45] good story they came to the door one
[1:31:46] time and my wife didn't know it but my
[1:31:48] wife let it talk to him my wife started
[1:31:50] talking about how my mother or my mother
[1:31:51] was here the cancer and the younger ones
[1:31:54] tell me about the other one got really
[1:31:55] excited oh praise God but the older ones
[1:31:57] like no that doesn't happen anymore and
[1:32:01] we're Charlie after that they left they
[1:32:05] don't believe that and that's really
[1:32:06] close to blasphemy that's really close
[1:32:09] to crucifying because if I stand with
[1:32:12] that guy and say the Holy Ghost did it
[1:32:14] and he say no the devil did it
[1:32:16] now he's just blasted in the Holy Ghost
[1:32:17] now he didn't say that but let's say he
[1:32:20] did say that now most of them are I just
[1:32:22] say well it was the doctors or like he
[1:32:24] said maybe your mother mother-in-law
[1:32:26] never had cancer to begin with
[1:32:28] so they won't blaspheme it but if they
[1:32:31] say the devil did that then yeah that
[1:32:32] would be blasphemy they and you can look
[1:32:36] it up they believe 1914 was the second
[1:32:37] coming they believe Michael is Christ
[1:32:39] but see brother Graham liked him a
[1:32:41] little bit because they denied the
[1:32:42] Trinity and I like that they got some
[1:32:45] good things going for him and they got
[1:32:47] some real bad things they got some
[1:32:49] gangrene and they also exalt the name of
[1:32:53] Jehovah above the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:56] right they say the name what's the name
[1:32:59] of God Jehovah well it's more net it's
[1:33:02] Lord Jesus Christ now Michaels Christ
[1:33:07] now there's once or twice after the
[1:33:09] seals brother Graham says Michaels
[1:33:10] Christ but let me show this I by the way
[1:33:13] I'm never labored on that brother
[1:33:14] branham never increased his sermon on
[1:33:15] that so here's what I'm saying if
[1:33:17] Michael's Christ which if God's fixing
[1:33:19] this way the right hand I guess Satan
[1:33:22] was the right-hand man to fellowship so
[1:33:23] I got this man I could have it mixed up
[1:33:24] it's not a major doctrine many ways
[1:33:27] whichever if Michael's Christ then who's
[1:33:29] the one speaking between the cherubims
[1:33:33] Michaels that Christ Christ is God are
[1:33:38] you a church Christ is God and the same
[1:33:41] thing is true when program says when
[1:33:43] Jesus broke the here's John seeing the
[1:33:46] four horse riders but remember Jesus was
[1:33:48] standing there with John breaking the
[1:33:50] book broke breaking the first seal and
[1:33:52] bro man said see the white horse rider
[1:33:54] can't be Jesus because Jesus is standing
[1:33:56] right here by John Amen yeah this is the
[1:34:01] first seal better and will tell you that
[1:34:02] Jesus is right here by John and Jesus
[1:34:05] just broke the seal and they're both
[1:34:07] looking up then there's the white horse
[1:34:08] rider rode go past God's not going to
[1:34:11] give two personages God's only one
[1:34:13] person so the same thing is true Michael
[1:34:16] can't be Christ because Christ is the
[1:34:19] one who's seated on the mercy seat hey
[1:34:21] that glory
[1:34:25] everybody catch that hope that's okay
[1:34:28] now let me go back
[1:34:32] here's why I'm not gonna use this unless
[1:34:34] now here's what the one reason I could
[1:34:37] use this by those a and brother Amen
[1:34:39] just somebody knows is there's notes in
[1:34:41] here from authors like and the one
[1:34:44] example is tears it gives a really good
[1:34:46] detail about the history of Tears
[1:34:47] in Judea and Palestine so that is really
[1:34:51] helpful but that's the only way I'll use
[1:34:54] it but this this leaves out first John
[1:34:59] 5:7 what's first John 5:7 there's three
[1:35:03] that bear record in heaven the father
[1:35:04] the word and the Holy Ghost not the son
[1:35:08] that's why the Catholic Church is trying
[1:35:10] to get that out because it proved Jesus
[1:35:12] name is not son see and even it even
[1:35:17] show see the word the the word son is a
[1:35:21] title and so is the word word is the
[1:35:23] title but the name of the word is the
[1:35:25] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:35:29] praise God are you with me to see this
[1:35:33] cuts out Scripture now there's an
[1:35:35] asterisk that says well some manuscripts
[1:35:37] have you know this this verse in it but
[1:35:41] they cut it out I remember the warning
[1:35:45] if you add one word or take one word
[1:35:47] away your name will be taken out now I'm
[1:35:52] trying to get down to cloves here I'm
[1:35:53] not gonna promise when I'm gonna close
[1:35:54] either
[1:35:56] I'll close at noon okay I gives me 24
[1:36:00] more minutes now barrel there was 27
[1:36:04] quotes on the diag lot and he does not
[1:36:06] emphasize them after the seals there's
[1:36:10] only three mentions nor in the church
[1:36:11] age book so churches that's like a tool
[1:36:13] his brother am believed Michael was
[1:36:15] Christ you know but he never major on it
[1:36:17] god never major done it to correct him
[1:36:19] on it because it's just a minor it's not
[1:36:21] a major right and so see it wasn't
[1:36:25] emphasized it was just a tool he would
[1:36:28] use it the main way he used it was with
[1:36:30] two verses blasphemous names because the
[1:36:34] you know Jesus said they'll be full
[1:36:36] blasphemous names but this says names of
[1:36:38] blasphemy so brother man was always see
[1:36:40] he said oh it's a great difference I
[1:36:42] don't know what the difference is but he
[1:36:43] says there's a great difference
[1:36:44] so this says names of
[1:36:46] ask me the Bible said blasphemous names
[1:36:48] either way Methodist Baptist
[1:36:51] Presbyterian Jehovah's Witness they're
[1:36:52] all blasphemous names anytime you say up
[1:36:55] trusting in the Catholic Way instead of
[1:36:57] the Christian Way you blaspheme the
[1:36:59] Christian name and the second one is
[1:37:02] jesus said greater works than these
[1:37:04] shall you do because I go to my father
[1:37:06] and John 14:12 but a man said they don't
[1:37:08] use greater here they use more and that
[1:37:10] would actually be a better translation
[1:37:13] because Bill Graham said you can't do
[1:37:15] any greater than Jesus
[1:37:16] listen Church the bride ain't gonna do
[1:37:19] greater miracles than Jesus just get
[1:37:22] that in your head right now you ain't
[1:37:24] you ain't gonna do greater miracles in
[1:37:26] Christ you can't he was God in flesh
[1:37:28] amen the fullness of the godhead dwell
[1:37:32] in christ bodily program says that over
[1:37:34] and over but some people I still heard
[1:37:35] people the message say
[1:37:36] even that camp meetings I heard him
[1:37:38] preach it some of the camp meetings I
[1:37:39] heard people say that would do greater
[1:37:41] works greater works than these show you
[1:37:42] do or do greater works than even Christ
[1:37:44] I heard people say they camp meeting
[1:37:45] over Internet you're not going to you
[1:37:50] can believe you can believe what
[1:37:51] everyone but that's not gonna happen now
[1:37:56] here's how you use the concordance he's
[1:37:58] preaching on the ten virgins under
[1:38:00] 44,000 he said we know what the seal of
[1:38:02] God is what does the seal of God he
[1:38:04] lists all the scriptures you just take
[1:38:06] the word seal in your concordance and
[1:38:10] run it everywhere you want to so let me
[1:38:12] open up my Bible so you have a Bible app
[1:38:14] if you have a search menu bar at the top
[1:38:17] you click that and you type in seal but
[1:38:22] they meant how many
[1:38:23] Bible verses have seal see the blue
[1:38:25] there 58 so look how easy it is for me
[1:38:29] now program had to get out a book and he
[1:38:30] had to open like a thousand two thousand
[1:38:33] pages and find where seal Susan oh now
[1:38:36] he found seal and they list all fifty
[1:38:38] eight times the word seals use in this
[1:38:40] big huge I remember when brother Craig
[1:38:41] used to carry it he would come into he
[1:38:44] would come into preaching with a duffel
[1:38:45] bag carrying all of his books he got
[1:38:48] that big concordance boot my brother I'm
[1:38:53] thinking I gotta carry one of those
[1:38:54] around thank God for technology but
[1:38:59] brother says if you're gonna teach on
[1:39:00] the of God he said get out the
[1:39:02] concordance and see what it says every
[1:39:05] time about the seal of God so what does
[1:39:09] the seal of God the Holy Ghost in other
[1:39:14] words you look if you wouldn't know
[1:39:15] about something you look at every time
[1:39:17] God said it and then if the Holy Spirit
[1:39:19] will anoint you to see the truth of that
[1:39:21] subject you'll see it and then you'll
[1:39:24] have the say that the Lord Amen
[1:39:25] hallelujah that's right and he goes
[1:39:31] preaching the seals look what he says
[1:39:32] the third seal he said o oil typifies
[1:39:35] spirit wine symbolizes stimulation of
[1:39:37] Revelation boy I'd like to run all over
[1:39:39] the place it's a wonder I didn't wake up
[1:39:41] the neighborhood when the Lord showed me
[1:39:42] that simulation of Revelation see all
[1:39:44] the line is in the Bible is associated
[1:39:47] together always so in order to
[1:39:51] understand the third seal about the oil
[1:39:53] line hurt not the oil one brother Brahim
[1:39:56] said I got the concordance and looked
[1:39:58] and there's a string of them like that
[1:40:00] where wine and oil goes together all the
[1:40:02] time and there's a screenshot I know
[1:40:06] it's small but thirty nine times in the
[1:40:08] Bible Deuteronomy 14 all the way to
[1:40:10] Revelation eighteen thirteen thirty nine
[1:40:13] times oil and wine run together praise
[1:40:17] God
[1:40:18] so if the third seal says touchdown that
[1:40:23] old online glory and Jesus is protecting
[1:40:28] the oil Lord and on the day of Pentecost
[1:40:31] they said we've got new line hahaha
[1:40:35] and there's a connection and I also fit
[1:40:37] together these cannot contradict each
[1:40:39] other they all have to say the same
[1:40:41] thing and in the old testament they were
[1:40:44] four shadows of the type of sacrifices
[1:40:47] God wants in other words God wants you
[1:40:49] to have the oil in your sacrifice I want
[1:40:52] you to have one your sacrifice that
[1:40:54] means you're going to get bored again
[1:40:55] and you gotta get stimulated by the
[1:40:59] revelation of God's Word amen and saying
[1:41:04] can't touch your name Satan cannot touch
[1:41:09] that Holy Ghost amen
[1:41:15] Lori thank there's a heart thank you
[1:41:21] Jesus
[1:41:21] now he's preaching the 4-cyl he said
[1:41:24] last night we find it the first seal
[1:41:26] went forth the right and the Lord so
[1:41:27] help me I never knew before none of
[1:41:30] those things have I ever known before
[1:41:31] that's right and I just go up there and
[1:41:33] take the Bible and sit down and there
[1:41:35] until when it grows to breaking forth
[1:41:38] like that I just pick up my pen and
[1:41:41] start writing and just stay there maybe
[1:41:45] four hours till it gets finished and if
[1:41:49] I've preached this before I'm not gonna
[1:41:51] preach this morning but every one of the
[1:41:53] seven seals brother man tells you
[1:41:54] sometime in that sermon when the Holy
[1:41:56] Ghost visited that day to give him the
[1:41:58] revelation now what a beautiful lesson
[1:42:00] that is for you and I if brother Mike if
[1:42:03] we'll just shut away every day with God
[1:42:05] and just wait on and just read the Bible
[1:42:08] and just wait pretty soon a revelation
[1:42:10] is gonna break forth we won't see a
[1:42:16] vision because we're not prophets like
[1:42:17] brother Branham now we may have a dream
[1:42:18] which could be like a vision you know if
[1:42:20] it gets interpreted later on but it
[1:42:23] teaches us we just gotta wait upon the
[1:42:25] Lord just wait there and pretty soon the
[1:42:27] Spirit will begin working and then it'll
[1:42:31] show us something in God's Word
[1:42:32] how many experience that I experienced
[1:42:36] it almost every day very force
[1:42:44] now he's same quote then I go back and I
[1:42:46] find out as I see where he said I
[1:42:47] thought well looks like I've seen that
[1:42:49] somewhere so brother ham sees a vision
[1:42:51] of horse riders and then after that
[1:42:52] vision ends he says I think I've seen
[1:42:54] that somewhere in the Bible I get my
[1:42:59] concordance go back is there something
[1:43:04] like that and here it is right here and
[1:43:06] then here it is over here see in the
[1:43:08] Bible and here over here and then I just
[1:43:11] tie ride it I know that's the devil no I
[1:43:15] know that's God as long as it's
[1:43:18] comparing Scripture of Scripture
[1:43:19] that's the way it has to do Amen just
[1:43:24] like putting a building together the
[1:43:26] stones have to fit stone by stone praise
[1:43:30] God
[1:43:31] oh don't you love a jerk hmm now side
[1:43:41] note the concordance is how I preach the
[1:43:44] statue of a man series and this is what
[1:43:47] brother Branham wanted to do one of
[1:43:49] those days but he never got to do it so
[1:43:55] for example virtues only use ten times
[1:43:57] in the Bible brother Branham only quoted
[1:43:59] this one that Verte I'm sorry these
[1:44:02] three that virtue Anna so in brother I'm
[1:44:05] preached virtue he only used these
[1:44:06] virtues about divine healing so if you
[1:44:09] listen to the stature of man and I heard
[1:44:12] brother Joseph Coleman preach this he
[1:44:15] said you don't have virtue until someone
[1:44:18] touches you and they get healed by
[1:44:20] touching you because they listen to it I
[1:44:24] can understand why he preached it
[1:44:25] because that's the only one brother
[1:44:26] Branham used in the sermon but there's
[1:44:29] other scriptures about virtue and member
[1:44:32] this has to be a virtue that every
[1:44:33] person can have man or woman but brother
[1:44:39] Branham first you know reason maybe they
[1:44:41] have enough time to study but he only
[1:44:42] preaches the vine healing virtue he
[1:44:45] doesn't preach the virtue of a virtuous
[1:44:47] who can find a virtuous woman oh not now
[1:44:51] everyone we can say amen to that but if
[1:44:53] I said everyone you women have to have
[1:44:55] somebody touch you and be healed and
[1:44:57] so you have to know weren't you flowed
[1:44:58] out of here and that's what Joseph
[1:45:00] Coleman preached I heard him say it on a
[1:45:01] video on YouTube and no wonder that gets
[1:45:05] the people I mean does that
[1:45:06] automatically make you feel like this
[1:45:09] see that was a case I'd be praying up
[1:45:12] say touch me brother might touch me you
[1:45:14] know let me know when you're sick
[1:45:16] somebody come touch me when you're sick
[1:45:18] I mean honestly right because I want to
[1:45:20] know I got what God wants me to the
[1:45:23] Bible said add it and I want God to add
[1:45:26] to me virtue but you see you see how let
[1:45:30] me say this you see how he's led of the
[1:45:32] Holy Spirit to go back to the
[1:45:33] concordance if I'm gonna preach a series
[1:45:36] I've got to go back to the concordance
[1:45:38] and see all that the Bible says about a
[1:45:40] topic and then in the Holies we're now
[1:45:46] to the true revelation because remember
[1:45:49] the scripture says not all have gifts of
[1:45:51] healing so that means not everybody is
[1:45:56] gonna have somebody lay their hands on
[1:45:57] them and they're gonna healed because
[1:45:59] not everybody has a gift of healing am I
[1:46:02] trying to correct brother BAM God knows
[1:46:04] I'm not but would brother Branham want
[1:46:06] us to go deeper in the word yes he would
[1:46:09] because the Holy Spirit's trying to take
[1:46:11] us deeper in the word and look what that
[1:46:14] just just by focusing on those three
[1:46:16] neglecting the rest look what it did in
[1:46:17] that seven thunders camp total division
[1:46:21] gangrene sin ungodliness all these
[1:46:24] things so I hope you understand church I
[1:46:29] hope you understand that we're just
[1:46:30] trying to balance just trying to rightly
[1:46:32] divide the word a virtue that everybody
[1:46:36] can have a faith everybody can have a
[1:46:38] knowledge everybody can have now look
[1:46:41] we're
[1:46:43] there it is in the Bible here it is
[1:46:45] notice at the end the message is
[1:46:46] paragraph 411 this is a three knife our
[1:46:48] sermon he said if I only had time to do
[1:46:50] it you can't do it in one day so man
[1:46:51] lets us know I didn't get all to it
[1:46:53] today you can't do this in one day
[1:46:55] that's why I preach I think 15 messages
[1:46:57] on it you know that but can tie the
[1:47:01] whole thing together amen
[1:47:03] see the stat for a man can be tied the
[1:47:06] whole can tie the whole Bible together
[1:47:08] because of all the sevens it's 7 it's 7
[1:47:12] whenever you see 7 building is speaking
[1:47:13] of the church ages stats River man all
[1:47:15] these things 7 you could tie the whole
[1:47:18] thing together because it's a 7 he said
[1:47:21] see now this is before previously in the
[1:47:23] sermon paragraph 345 see what I mean see
[1:47:25] how these virtues these building
[1:47:26] materials type in with the church
[1:47:28] messages with the church ages now one of
[1:47:31] these days ours one of our days they
[1:47:33] that's what I believe we're gonna take
[1:47:36] each one of those words and study them
[1:47:38] out see and show that it proves it it
[1:47:42] all goes together now brother Mike I
[1:47:46] believe I haven't fulfilled that brother
[1:47:47] now you can call me crazy if you want
[1:47:50] but just let me be happy because because
[1:47:54] I did what brother Branham did when he
[1:47:57] when the seals came to him I just did a
[1:47:58] concordance search of all those
[1:48:00] scriptures and let the Holy Spirit
[1:48:02] reveal rightly divide what's the what's
[1:48:04] the what's the word for all of these
[1:48:07] what's the holy spirit truth for all
[1:48:09] these virtues it all goes together see
[1:48:12] how wonderful that is see to see what it
[1:48:14] does now
[1:48:17] I know I'm running them recently I know
[1:48:19] a lot of brothers that teach the
[1:48:20] adoption message rather than
[1:48:21] sanctification in other words a lot of
[1:48:23] brothers more than I thought preach that
[1:48:26] you got to get justify sanctified feel
[1:48:28] the Holy Ghost and then you start the
[1:48:29] statue perfect man not to me that's to
[1:48:32] me there that's wrong and I love that
[1:48:34] all of them but to me they're basing it
[1:48:37] on quotes rather than the word because
[1:48:41] they misunderstood some of the quotes
[1:48:43] now if that's true if they're right and
[1:48:46] I'm wrong then this suggests someone can
[1:48:48] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:48:50] still need faith and then you still need
[1:48:54] to be capped off with the Holy Ghost
[1:48:55] again
[1:48:58] but remember I said this before do a
[1:49:01] Bible search the Bible never says do a
[1:49:03] concordance search the Bible never says
[1:49:05] we're sealed twice there it is you're
[1:49:09] sealed until a man you're sealed until
[1:49:14] the day of your redemption they're not
[1:49:17] two seals there's one seal see so it has
[1:49:23] to be like it has to be that way because
[1:49:25] if not you add something to the word now
[1:49:33] see in church let me just say like this
[1:49:35] this is the gift God has given to me
[1:49:36] I can't I'm a teacher I'm a pastor I
[1:49:39] can't be something that I ain't why do
[1:49:42] these things come to me brother William
[1:49:44] I don't know but they come to me and
[1:49:48] what does it do it lies it rightly
[1:49:50] divides it it's perfect because the Holy
[1:49:54] Spirit it's not me I just sit back and
[1:49:56] let him come to me now I'm gonna try to
[1:49:59] close in 10 minutes yeah good it'll work
[1:50:00] huggy see brother and so you can have
[1:50:02] different convictions yet unity yes so
[1:50:07] but man this is in 63 question has drawn
[1:50:10] the seals he's doing questions he said
[1:50:12] he said I have higher answer wrong you
[1:50:14] forgive me if you have a different
[1:50:15] interpretation and believe that your
[1:50:16] idea is right just go right ahead that
[1:50:20] won't hurt now a lot of people they say
[1:50:23] if you don't have the rhetoric same
[1:50:25] interpretation as me you're not born
[1:50:26] again I'm not gonna say that now I'll
[1:50:30] say it to people like you know
[1:50:31] megachurches you know that we know
[1:50:33] they're not born again they're smoking
[1:50:35] and drinking and cussing and and
[1:50:36] half-naked we know they're not born
[1:50:38] again you know that's gonna hurt them
[1:50:40] right if they got the wrong
[1:50:42] interpretation that's gonna hurt them
[1:50:43] but brother Aaron says within this
[1:50:45] message movement if we have a slightly
[1:50:48] different up rotational hurt because
[1:50:50] that's not only about one or two of them
[1:50:52] that pertains the salvation so salvation
[1:50:57] is the major doctrine see most the
[1:51:02] quotations is on the other side of the
[1:51:03] tribulation are on the rapture of the
[1:51:04] church now a few months later and
[1:51:06] overcome he said there's a great friend
[1:51:09] of mine a great teacher
[1:51:10] bosom friend lovely brother I'd be
[1:51:11] Darren to say one word against the
[1:51:13] brother I wanted as a Christian I
[1:51:14] wouldn't say nothing against him you
[1:51:16] don't agree with me on what one subject
[1:51:17] and he's my precious brother we eat
[1:51:19] together oh he's just a dandy fella I
[1:51:21] take his magazine read his articles and
[1:51:23] he writes of some of mine and so forth
[1:51:24] and I took many attacks out of what I've
[1:51:26] read of his articles hear him say WOW
[1:51:29] now if you remember church brother Ram
[1:51:31] got sermons from this guy's magazine he
[1:51:33] got sermons from lavell he got sermons
[1:51:37] from a level right which proves that's
[1:51:41] the AL apostolic pattern even a prophet
[1:51:44] could feed off a pastor a perfe can feed
[1:51:48] off evangelist see we all feed off one
[1:51:50] another because God ordained oh boy
[1:51:52] dance amen and you're incomplete without
[1:51:55] one of them which today they're trying
[1:51:58] to get rid of the pastor play tapes only
[1:52:00] I like her brother Donny Reagan said he
[1:52:02] said yes I'll push play and then here
[1:52:03] brother branham say that all five people
[1:52:05] are supposed to preach God I push play
[1:52:10] dice here brother and say I'm not the
[1:52:12] only preacher I like that we did more of
[1:52:16] a may man better called of God I
[1:52:24] appreciate that brother he's a great man
[1:52:30] he just can't agree with me I appreciate
[1:52:32] that of his sincerity so brother and
[1:52:34] could recognize sincere people though he
[1:52:36] just thought he's not one of these
[1:52:37] pushovers and church I'll be honest
[1:52:40] that's something I have to be careful of
[1:52:43] there's something burrs a part of me
[1:52:44] sister Shirley man like that I don't
[1:52:46] like any conflict at all and there's
[1:52:48] ever a way I can just like not deal with
[1:52:50] conflict I'll be there okay
[1:52:52] I just hate conflict but uh but I've
[1:52:57] learned God's over the after 13 years of
[1:52:59] whippings brother William after 13 years
[1:53:01] of spankings I'm sorry get a backbone
[1:53:04] I'm not a pushover anymore just have to
[1:53:09] agree with everything you say he's got
[1:53:11] his own conviction he stands there for
[1:53:12] like recent I got a email from a brother
[1:53:14] saying well you're wrong on the stature
[1:53:16] of man and I said well brother I love
[1:53:18] you and I appreciate you for let me
[1:53:20] preach at your church I said but that's
[1:53:22] where I stand it's what God's revealed
[1:53:24] to me
[1:53:24] I believe such fervor man's of
[1:53:25] signification message and if everyone
[1:53:27] sit down and talk about it we're more
[1:53:28] than welcome to do that
[1:53:29] I didn't apologize what I preached
[1:53:32] because I know what's right he's a good
[1:53:35] man I'm not a teacher or scholar at all
[1:53:37] but this man is both teacher and scholar
[1:53:38] he said I can't agree with him because I
[1:53:40] don't see it but it doesn't pertain to
[1:53:42] salvation
[1:53:43] it's pertaining to the coming of the
[1:53:45] Lord he sees the church has to go
[1:53:47] through tribulation and purification I
[1:53:48] say the blood of Jesus Christ purify the
[1:53:49] church now this is striking
[1:53:52] this has to be bounced out with our text
[1:53:54] because in our text hi may Gnaeus and
[1:53:57] philetus were preaching false doctrine
[1:53:59] about the coming of the Lord but they
[1:54:03] were saying the rapture already took
[1:54:05] place now here he's saying they're not
[1:54:08] saying the rapture took place they're
[1:54:10] just saying well the church has to go
[1:54:11] through tribulation before the rapture
[1:54:13] oh my goodness are you serious
[1:54:17] what is it brother Jesse it's like
[1:54:18] splitting hairs the truth and false was
[1:54:24] so close together to teach the rapture
[1:54:28] already happened is death but to preach
[1:54:30] if they go through the tribulation to
[1:54:32] get the rapture you can still be saved
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:36] see how close it is oh but the only that
[1:54:39] the elect will not be to see they men
[1:54:42] what does it take it takes the Spirit of
[1:54:44] Truth it takes a man who's the noise of
[1:54:47] the Holy Ghost by the man the god man to
[1:54:50] preach and rightly divide God's Word
[1:54:53] never understand yeah all right I think
[1:54:56] I'm about done we see you got my last
[1:54:59] quote I got three more no I got whoa
[1:55:02] whoa oh I got a lot more like if I go
[1:55:07] through these refit real fast so Holy
[1:55:09] Ghost filled preachers now these are
[1:55:10] missionaries now Paul and Barnabas
[1:55:12] disagreed Barnabas said I'll take mark
[1:55:14] and Paul said I'm not taking mark we got
[1:55:16] to split up and so they did now later in
[1:55:21] the book of 2nd Timothy Paul says mark
[1:55:23] what he said bring mark with you he can
[1:55:25] be beneficial for the ministry so at
[1:55:27] some point and this is one thing I
[1:55:29] appreciate Albie the last time I was
[1:55:30] there at some point you know at the
[1:55:33] beginning Paul said he cannot benefit my
[1:55:35] ministry I have a prophet ministry
[1:55:38] I have a healing ministry I see
[1:55:40] something in marks life he won't help my
[1:55:41] ministry but later on down the road now
[1:55:45] he sees some about Mark's character now
[1:55:47] yeah he can help out my ministry yes
[1:55:50] praise God now what does that tell us it
[1:55:54] tells us that people will be a part of
[1:55:56] this ministry who are qualified to be
[1:55:59] part of this ministry if you see me
[1:56:02] inviting people to preach you know I got
[1:56:03] confidence in them if you see me not
[1:56:05] asking people to preach then you know I
[1:56:08] don't I don't have confidence in them
[1:56:09] and that's been a number of people I've
[1:56:12] I've given them a chance to preach but
[1:56:14] later said no I don't see they're not
[1:56:16] qualified to preach God's Word okay now
[1:56:19] later it may change right you see there
[1:56:25] can be contention amongst Holy Ghost
[1:56:27] filled believers well you got to go
[1:56:30] through the tribulation and wash your
[1:56:32] robes right in the blood of Jesus then
[1:56:34] your rapture no Jesus washes your robes
[1:56:36] now you're going the rapture before
[1:56:37] that's fine we're still brothers
[1:56:39] but if you say the Raps already happened
[1:56:41] that's from hell is Jesus Christ is
[1:56:45] still waiting he's still saving he's
[1:56:47] still making sure those names that
[1:56:49] although his book a minute or lenzburg
[1:56:50] life get filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:56:52] right now amen
[1:56:53] there's still mercy amen haha that's
[1:56:57] what he's saying yes now revelation is
[1:57:01] the greatest realm of ministry corner
[1:57:07] brother Brandon questions answers on the
[1:57:09] seals now this is the morning before he
[1:57:11] preached the seven seals in the evening
[1:57:12] this is Sunday morning March 63 of all
[1:57:16] the times I've ever been behind the
[1:57:17] pulpit at Tabernacle I have never never
[1:57:19] he said it twice verily verily verily I
[1:57:25] say I've never never at any time of my
[1:57:28] ministry ever worked into the realms the
[1:57:32] shallowness did he say shallowness some
[1:57:35] people say oh you're preaching the sales
[1:57:37] and while you you shouldn't preach the
[1:57:38] seals and know this wasn't shallow this
[1:57:42] was
[1:57:45] the realms of God and the spiritual
[1:57:47] realms as its bent this time
[1:57:49] yeah it's beyond anything I ever did in
[1:57:53] any time of my ministry in any meeting
[1:57:57] at anywhere like this
[1:58:01] mostly it's on healing see most of his
[1:58:03] sermons were on healing this is
[1:58:05] revealing of truth by the same spirit
[1:58:08] the same spirit Durban South Africa
[1:58:14] truckloads of crutches going down the
[1:58:17] road so you can only believe brother
[1:58:18] Bram said this was actually greater why
[1:58:23] because it was those seven thunders all
[1:58:29] the revelations and nobody knew seven
[1:58:32] thunders seven voices of God Amen
[1:58:34] revealing the revelations of the seven
[1:58:37] seals was greater than just by a man
[1:58:42] why because souls get healed with this
[1:58:45] one hey man and I've been to myself all
[1:58:49] together man boarding at a place and
[1:58:50] going down eating at a place and I just
[1:58:52] been alone so it's been a really great
[1:58:53] time the human mind can only stand so
[1:58:55] much and when you get this spot where
[1:58:57] you set our nun with the Friends of God
[1:58:59] and a pillar of light hang in there
[1:59:01] before you just can't stay there too
[1:59:02] long the human being can't stand it
[1:59:08] after sitting
[1:59:10] writing down the white horse rider for
[1:59:13] the mic he'd be numb for an hour had to
[1:59:17] sit there that morning once he got a
[1:59:21] numb do you go back he got his
[1:59:26] concordance to start looking up now he
[1:59:28] did have a phone what is seal anyway
[1:59:32] what is oil wine anyway let me take it
[1:59:36] my Bible let me make sure everything
[1:59:39] that angel said is the Word of God
[1:59:41] because though we are an angel
[1:59:45] we've preached to the first let him be
[1:59:47] cursed glory
[1:59:54] so church this is something I've got to
[1:59:57] grow into I get I'll be honest sometimes
[2:00:00] I get discouraged when I don't see
[2:00:01] people healed around in our church but
[2:00:03] I've got to remember it's not about that
[2:00:06] the greatest realms are not with divine
[2:00:09] healing the greatest realms are with
[2:00:11] revealing the truth of God's Word I've
[2:00:16] got to remember that that's I'm just be
[2:00:18] honest that's what I need help with
[2:00:20] because you know all I hear is Bob Arum
[2:00:22] say all the true church these signs
[2:00:23] filed in the believe and I hear it all
[2:00:25] the time you know I must be listening to
[2:00:26] the sermon sir he's made you're not
[2:00:27] healing all the time and then I get
[2:00:31] discouraged well no one got healed today
[2:00:32] well maybe I'm missing the mark maybe
[2:00:34] I'm not walking with God and the whole
[2:00:35] time I could be walking right with God
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:38] revealing things you never heard before
[2:00:41] amen and it wasn't me it was the Holy
[2:00:43] Spirit and brother amen we could be in
[2:00:47] the greatest realms and yet the devil
[2:00:48] will beat me up and be like nobody got
[2:00:50] healed this week some Holy Ghost you got
[2:00:53] where's all your signs if you say you're
[2:00:57] a Christian but I can say back well now
[2:01:00] devil if I divide the right the word the
[2:01:03] rightly divided word of truth then I
[2:01:05] gave people the words of and they're
[2:01:10] increasing on to more godliness amen
[2:01:13] yes that's gonna make sure you and I
[2:01:15] live the right kind of life see any new
[2:01:20] revelation so even like when I preach
[2:01:22] this edge word man where it seems like
[2:01:24] oh that might be new it will be the same
[2:01:27] revelation just with more information
[2:01:29] and brother branham tells us in the
[2:01:32] church age book he talks about the
[2:01:33] Apostles saying some new apostles
[2:01:35] Enderlin and he found they were liars
[2:01:38] and then he quotes this what I just
[2:01:42] closed though we or an angel preached
[2:01:44] anything other under you what we've
[2:01:45] preached letting me curse so Brumaire
[2:01:47] says it's the Apostles who brought the
[2:01:48] original word to the people the original
[2:01:50] word could not change not even a dot or
[2:01:52] - of it Paul knew it was God's Word or
[2:01:55] was God who had spoken to him so he said
[2:01:56] if I even if I come and give a second
[2:01:59] revelation to try to make one little
[2:02:01] change in what I gave originally let him
[2:02:04] be cursed you see Paul knew that first
[2:02:06] revelation was correct
[2:02:07] God can't give a first revelation then
[2:02:10] give a second revelation if he did he
[2:02:12] would not he would be changing his mind
[2:02:13] he can give a revelation and then add to
[2:02:18] it right as he's in the Garden of Eden
[2:02:23] and when he promised to seed the woman
[2:02:24] and then later designated that seed
[2:02:26] would come through Abraham 2,000 years
[2:02:30] later he added more information and then
[2:02:33] later designed that seed to come that
[2:02:34] Abraham and the later center would come
[2:02:36] by the bloodlines of David but it was
[2:02:37] the same revelation it only give the
[2:02:39] people more information to help them
[2:02:42] receive and understand it to see
[2:02:47] anything you hear that's new from me or
[2:02:49] any preacher you and I have to take that
[2:02:52] back to the word and make sure that
[2:02:54] lines up with everything we've heard
[2:02:55] before if it doesn't leave it alone they
[2:03:01] bloom and the way you do that is take
[2:03:03] your Bible in your concordance and you
[2:03:05] see if the scripture teaches that now
[2:03:09] what a lot of people do today with false
[2:03:11] doctrine they'll take a quote from
[2:03:12] brother Branham and they'll take you
[2:03:13] through the quotes which is okay but
[2:03:16] those quotes have to be taken back to
[2:03:17] the scripture like that's a Joseph
[2:03:20] Coleman it
[2:03:21] he took the quote about the stepless the
[2:03:23] virtues and then he found the quote from
[2:03:25] the revelations
[2:03:26] series where it says your life is a live
[2:03:28] voice oh how we need live voices in
[2:03:31] jeffersonville region I remember that
[2:03:32] the thing he said the thunder of your
[2:03:34] life thundering out a live life in
[2:03:35] Jefferson so he took a quote that wasn't
[2:03:38] in that sermon and applied at your
[2:03:41] perfect man when brother man never
[2:03:43] replied way and church not only did it
[2:03:46] it didn't work there it didn't work with
[2:03:49] brother Rams other two quotes for
[2:03:50] brother Branham said the seven thunders
[2:03:51] are the revelations contained in the
[2:03:54] seven seals so see his his he was taken
[2:03:58] a quote and interpreting him by another
[2:04:00] quote but actually contradicted the
[2:04:02] other quotes to see if God gives us
[2:04:08] anything if God gives us anything that
[2:04:09] seems new it will line up with all the
[2:04:11] other quotes and most importantly it'll
[2:04:13] land up with this word because you
[2:04:14] change one word of this brother sister
[2:04:16] you're cursed like we saw today I hate
[2:04:20] to say but the authors of this are
[2:04:22] cursed because they took things out of
[2:04:24] the scripture they took out father word
[2:04:27] Holy Ghost these three or one they took
[2:04:28] it out because they want to say gods
[2:04:30] three persons as a curse behind that now
[2:04:33] I'm not saying every person that reads
[2:04:35] it is curse I'm not saying that what I'm
[2:04:37] saying is if you make this your absolute
[2:04:38] if you're if you really had a desire to
[2:04:40] get this out the person who Papa but and
[2:04:45] it was in your heart to do this then
[2:04:46] like that Texas you don't like that King
[2:04:47] James Version now you're cursed because
[2:04:49] that King James Version is God's Word
[2:04:51] that's the text that men died for bled
[2:04:54] for were martyred for were crucified for
[2:04:57] that's the word that God protected
[2:04:59] that's the seed that God protected see
[2:05:04] God's Word can't change the seed came
[2:05:06] exactly as revealed hallelujah and we
[2:05:08] see what these false apostles were doing
[2:05:09] they came with their own word those
[2:05:14] Ephesians knew that word as Paul taught
[2:05:16] it they were full of the Holy Ghost by
[2:05:18] the laying on of Paul's hands
[2:05:19] they looked those false prophets in the
[2:05:20] eye and said you're not saying what Paul
[2:05:22] said you are therefore follows oh that
[2:05:27] sets my heart on fire get back to the
[2:05:28] word it's not you that really tries the
[2:05:31] apostle of the Prophet in the teacher
[2:05:32] it's the word that tries them and church
[2:05:38] I sent this quote to voice of God those
[2:05:40] brothers we met with last year I sent
[2:05:42] them the quotes they said oh we're not
[2:05:43] going to argue about it I said brother
[2:05:44] I'm not arguing about it then they never
[2:05:46] wrote me back
[2:05:47] I said please write me back let's talk
[2:05:48] about they never wrote me back up there
[2:05:50] I'm not trying to argue but I'm trying
[2:05:53] to test them by the word cuz they got
[2:05:56] him they got Anu they got a new
[2:05:57] revelation they're bringing their own
[2:05:58] word where everything bowed Ram said
[2:06:00] with us saith the Lord that's not true
[2:06:01] that's your own word that's not programs
[2:06:03] word that's not the Bible's word most
[2:06:05] important it's not Jesus's word right
[2:06:09] because everything brother Branham says
[2:06:10] has to be taken back to the word see one
[2:06:14] of these days there's gonna come a
[2:06:15] prophet the latest in church age and you
[2:06:17] know if he's the real ones that from God
[2:06:19] or not yes you will
[2:06:20] for he's of God and he'll be in that
[2:06:23] word exactly as God gave it to Paul he
[2:06:26] won't deviate from that word for a ruler
[2:06:28] not one iota in the last age will there
[2:06:33] be many false prophets appearing watch
[2:06:35] and see how they keep telling you that
[2:06:36] if you don't believe them or what they
[2:06:38] say you're lost no I didn't say that at
[2:06:39] all if you don't agree with my teaching
[2:06:41] on the centaurum and you're not lost
[2:06:42] you're still saved and I hope you say
[2:06:44] I'm saved too but if you change
[2:06:47] salvation to make it something outside
[2:06:49] of the blood of Jesus Christ or make it
[2:06:51] the blood of Jesus plus your Antichrist
[2:06:54] amen
[2:06:55] the salvation is the blood of Jesus
[2:06:58] Christ amen
[2:06:59] faith you're not saved by works you're
[2:07:02] saved by grace through faith you must
[2:07:04] have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:07:06] to forgive you and you always say that's
[2:07:08] a major amen that's why Jehovah's
[2:07:13] Witnesses can still be saved right they
[2:07:16] can still be safe as long as in the
[2:07:19] blood they're still virgin if they're by
[2:07:21] the blood sea
[2:07:25] they'll keep telling you if you don't
[2:07:26] believe them they're you're lost but
[2:07:27] when the last a prophet comes on the
[2:07:29] scene if he's truly the prophet help me
[2:07:30] cry now get back to the Lord or you are
[2:07:33] lost he will be on a private revelation
[2:07:36] interpretation around the word amen
[2:07:37] a man let's say to our feet remember
[2:07:39] program when I preach us I preach a
[2:07:41] revelation in series on chapter 4
[2:07:42] brother bran tells us this is how you
[2:07:45] interpret he said he said the reason we
[2:07:49] know that 24 elders are not angels is
[2:07:51] because of he lists all these scriptures
[2:07:53] see they'll let you know there redeem
[2:07:56] men they're not angels the 24 elders he
[2:07:59] says how do you know yes he said you
[2:08:00] have to consider the dress consider the
[2:08:02] dress consider their position you said
[2:08:04] can you have to consider all the
[2:08:05] scripture around them so see when you
[2:08:08] interpret something you have to consider
[2:08:10] every detail of the word and take it
[2:08:12] back to the rest of the word because
[2:08:18] that's what brother Ram did when God
[2:08:20] gave him the seals
[2:08:20] he watched the vision wrote it down went
[2:08:23] back and makes sure okay that that was
[2:08:24] that true the Old Testament is that true
[2:08:26] the Newton okay now I got revelation now
[2:08:28] I know it's that saith the Lord and he
[2:08:32] says you can compare
[2:08:33] scriptures I better stop here let me
[2:08:36] just stop I think I got yeah I got too
[2:08:38] many a guy but I will read II so you got
[2:08:43] to sit through full three more quotes
[2:08:45] let's got to use the restroom
[2:08:47] now what did they do they didn't know
[2:08:50] today men walk in early they don't know
[2:08:52] that's the truth they think it's some
[2:08:53] kind of ism listen the reason they don't
[2:08:56] know the message they don't dig down
[2:08:57] deep enough to get in the spirit of
[2:08:59] Revelation amen and that makes me sad
[2:09:04] I'm about ready to cry because I think
[2:09:05] all my friends who study the Bible but
[2:09:07] they don't study deep enough I gave my
[2:09:10] book I give my book brother Mike and
[2:09:11] they don't read it again I'll give it
[2:09:15] I'll give it about 80 books already and
[2:09:16] hardly anybody will even say anything
[2:09:18] about it after I give it out they just
[2:09:21] they don't want to dig down they don't
[2:09:22] want to get in the spirit revelation but
[2:09:24] I want to get in the spirit of
[2:09:25] Revelation that's one place I want to
[2:09:27] get to brother Mike I wanna get in the
[2:09:30] spirit of Revelation they don't pray
[2:09:34] enough they don't call upon God enough
[2:09:36] because jesus said if you ask you shall
[2:09:39] the reason people don't receive the
[2:09:41] message because they don't ask for it or
[2:09:44] the Bible said they ask with selfish
[2:09:47] intentions that they may consume it upon
[2:09:48] their lusts God give me a great
[2:09:50] revelation so I can have a mega church
[2:09:53] we get more people come to our church
[2:09:56] that's the that's a selfish ambition but
[2:09:59] this morning I prayed God give me your
[2:10:00] word so I can feed your lamb not for
[2:10:03] popularity not for money but so your
[2:10:05] sheep feast on your word hallelujah no
[2:10:10] matter who comes or who goes god let me
[2:10:12] just feed your little lambs did Jesus
[2:10:16] know Peter do you love me Peter he said
[2:10:18] yes you know I love you then he said
[2:10:19] feed my lambs amen
[2:10:21] how do you know Jesus I'm feeding his
[2:10:24] lehem hallelujah that's my desire and we
[2:10:30] want to get in the spirit of Revelation
[2:10:32] if revelation is beyond you look up and
[2:10:35] see God for it now I'm skipping ahead
[2:10:38] because the time we need to call on God
[2:10:40] for revelation more than anything else
[2:10:42] in the world let's stop right there
[2:10:45] for musicians if you'll come here curse
[2:10:49] that's why if we don't see miracles
[2:10:50] going on it's okay we should still cry
[2:10:52] out for more revelation because that's a
[2:10:54] greater realm than just divine healing
[2:10:57] do I appreciate divine healing of course
[2:10:59] don't want to see more miracles more
[2:11:01] gifts yes
[2:11:01] but the greatest realm is when someone
[2:11:04] doesn't know thus saith the Lord and
[2:11:06] then God reveals to them the revelation
[2:11:08] of the Word of God and now you've gone
[2:11:12] beyond just the body and now you've gone
[2:11:14] down to the soul now you're standing on
[2:11:18] the say the Lord the greatest realm
[2:11:22] there is praise God well my burdens been
[2:11:30] delivered praise the Lord I can relax Oh
[2:11:32] second service church I hope you know
[2:11:37] I've had people you know listen to my
[2:11:39] sermons and say all you you're you're
[2:11:42] trying to get rid of brother Branham and
[2:11:43] I'm not trying to get rid of brother
[2:11:44] Branham anyone that knows me knows I'm
[2:11:47] not trying to get rid of it available
[2:11:48] what I'm trying to do is rightly divide
[2:11:50] everything take everything he said and
[2:11:53] take it back to the word I'm just trying
[2:11:56] to do it brother Branham said and then
[2:11:57] people say you're not doing what you're
[2:11:59] trying to get rid of brother Branham I'm
[2:12:00] not trying to I'm just trying to do it
[2:12:04] [Music]
[2:12:10] may God help us Church to pray for a
[2:12:14] revelation more than anything else

[2:12:23] these are just precious times I really
[2:12:24] feel your presence this morning and lord
[2:12:26] it may not be from divine healing and
[2:12:28] forgive me Lord because often I just I
[2:12:31] desire to see these signs follow me as a
[2:12:33] believer and I've no doubt that
[2:12:36] unbalance in that Lord I'm pressured
[2:12:39] myself
[2:12:40] you know years ago I apologized to the
[2:12:43] church for pressure in the church with
[2:12:45] those things we know it's important but
[2:12:48] it's a high nerd orkut the greatest
[2:12:52] realms we can work in lord is revelation

[2:13:02] stand torrential or satan say it's also

[2:13:37] forgive our debtors as we forgive those
[2:13:40] who are knitted to us we love you Lord

[2:13:50] anchored down in the hearts of the
[2:13:51] people and they would see Lord what the
[2:13:53] Holy Spirit is doing in this hour trying
[2:13:55] to reveal more of the word give us more
[2:13:58] of the same revelation more information
[2:14:00] on the same revelation there's already
[2:14:04] past the days where people are stirred
[2:14:06] up and by the water baptism in the name
[2:14:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ or even Malachi
[2:14:11] 4 5 and 6 that God has set a prophet
[2:14:14] with people Lord you're trying to get us
[2:14:17] to advance Lord God to more of the
[2:14:20] revelation but Lord we got to dig deeper
[2:14:25] amen or we've got the pray more for
[2:14:28] Revelation we can't be content with our
[2:14:33] walk with you Lord God
[2:14:34] so father with this anointing of the
[2:14:37] Holy Spirit I pray we pray for more
