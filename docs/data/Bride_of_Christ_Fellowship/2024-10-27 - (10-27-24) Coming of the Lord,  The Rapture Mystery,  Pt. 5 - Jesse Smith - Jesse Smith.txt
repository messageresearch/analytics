TRANSCRIPT
========================================
on Wednesday I just felt led to kind of continue on this series here about the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery Hallelujah re I'm sorry Psalm 27 1-5 and I don't know if you've listened to this but um I was listening do it real slow yesterday and today U this is the text Brother BR uses but um as I'll be sharing maybe a little bit more here as we go on with the Rapture there are certain things that um we're not given thus sayith the Lord on you know we're not given thus sayith the Lord on Psalm 27 for the Rapture brother raham just uses it for the Rapture so it's kind of like you know the squeeze and all these things that some things we don't have thus sayith the Lord on but we're just look into the scripture for inspiration Hallelujah and if you look it up I I would encourage you to look it up after reads verses 1-5 he doesn't read this text again the rest of the sermon so it's just look it up yeah look up trouble I looked up trouble I looked up hide me in the Pavilion it's only used one time that's the beginning of the service uh the lady was trying to push him out of there uh there I guess they were too long in that uh hotel room there but just very interesting and so it just requires us to have some maturity and for us to seek God as well uh to say Lord Inspire us with the verses we need to fulfill F before the Rapture Hallelujah so it gives us a little bit of a Duty uh to stay in the word of God to look to the word of God I find it very striking brother bam uses this verse uh uh for the Rapture I've never heard anybody else use this verse of course I just only listen to Somebody of God preachers before that but let's read this uh Psalm 27 1-5 I'll read 1-4 okay and then we can read uh five together Psalm 27 1-5 Hallelujah verse one says a Psalm of David the Lord is my light and salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid just pausing just a moment we can see how this would be a real encouragement for the Rapture right because we're we're told there might be a squeeze there might be some fearful things happen but if this is a Rapture scripture then we're told not to be afraid it's going to take the anointing of the holy spirit it's going to take we what we call rapturing Faith Hallelujah verse two when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell so on their way to attack David they stumbled and fell God wouldn't let them actually get to David verse three though in host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident talk about confidence a war Rising against someone and yet there confident verse four one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple let's read verse five together one 2 3 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set my feet upon a rock let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto the Lord somehow let's pray father God we thank you for the reading of Thy word Lord your Prophet used this Lord almost 60 years ago Lord to teach the people about the Rapture and Lord the Holy Spirit told them to store up food Lord God we would need it later on so Lord we see how we need this today in a time when there's Wars rumors of wars Lord God and Lord enemies and and uh Christianity is being attacked and mocked and made fun of scoffed at all around Lord we need your Holy Spirit Lord that we would not fear we need your Holy Spirit Lord to hide us in a time of trouble if the trouble should come upon us Lord so father God that we see the inspiration Lord now of the Holy Spirit storing up these things for us Lord God and we're grateful for the word of God Lord God thank you for the songs the worship Lord the baby dedication bless van Andia and father God bless our uh final here two services with brother William Lord and father we'll give you all the praise honor and Glory anoint me anoint your people with the Holy Ghost In Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so this is part five for those people keeping track part five the coming of the Lord uh the map The Rapture of mystery rather so Wednesday we finished the 1957 sermon uh the sudden secet going away the Lord and we started then we looked at the six proofs the Rapture is pre-tribulation and then we began looking at the beginning of this sermon the Rapture from Yuma Arizona uh December 4th 19 65 and we got in to see how brother random talked about the message of the hour he said it was the scriptures that God is vindicating right now it was foretold in the Bible and just hits exactly each time because it's God saying that hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God all right then he said uh the uh B uh the Christian businessman's Fellowship was an oasis of Fellowship outside of denominational barriers I think find out that as well when we can fellowship with other churches isn't it so refreshing you know when we remember when we had the and you know they're and they're message leaders remember we had the Pennsylvania Saints the open door Tabernacle come to see us wasn't it so refreshing it was so refreshing they sent us a card I still left it up there on the on the bulletin board out there just it so refreshed their spirit and they listen to our sermons you know they I show Malachi they made a comment on our Wednesday night service they gave Malachi a nice compliment I said Malai got to keep humble though by God's grace uh it was Aaron's wife said oh no nobody plays like Malachi I said well I appreciate that I said but Malachi knows he's got to be humble Hallelujah CU we're all growing in the grace of God right buddy Hallelujah and brother R said how God is turning a corner right and with the the seven Church age messenger god was turning a corner into this last final Church age and we're hoping by God's grace we're at that we're at the very end of this corner where the corners are going to come together and the building of God is going to be finished and he can Rapture the bride out of here hallelujah so that's what we're looking for by the grace of God and brother Bram did not call these uh Presbyterians Baptists Pentecostal he did not call them Devils he called them fine Brethren Hallelujah so we want to make sure we no matter who we disagree with we want to call them fine Brethren of course unless God anoints us to say something like oh Child full of subtility thou child of Satan or something like that unless we get some type of powerful anointing like that let's be gracious let's be kind Hallelujah because we always want to remember where were we Hallelujah when we were before the message came to us where was I right amen and we always want to remember that by God's grace now right after brother reads this text I'll be getting into the sermon here we'll just hit the highlights kind of as we feel L of the Lord uh brother Ram said how many in here believes the Bible teaches there will be a Rapture of the church yes sir that's right exactly a catching away of the church whether you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian whoever you are Pentecostal there will be a catching away and he says I in speaking I just don't try to get up here to say something that I would think would please the people I've never been guilty of that so brother said it's basically a sin to for a preacher to stand up here and say how can I please the people brother man said that's a sin and that's how I I never want to approach it that way I want to clarify things and I want to preach things and answer questions but I'm not up here to please the people I'm here to please Jesus Christ amen butam said I want to get up here and say something as I feel led to say it that I think would be a help to you something that would further your EXP experience with God if you are a Christian he said but make you so ashamed of yourself uh I'm sorry s it says if you're not a Christian make you so ashamed of yourself that you will become a Christian so see there's shame right there there before you can have good news you got to have the bad news you have to know you're a sinner going to hell but God's grace will save you if you repent of your sins Hallelujah so brother R said I want to further your experience with God not to please you but to give you a better experience and then make so ashamed of themselves they'll become Christians brother said that's the purpose I've always tried to line up my thoughts as the Lord would lead me Hallelujah now brother B takes the next I'm going to look at this the next uh I'm looking at time here now okay so 14 uh to 32 okay so that would be 16 18 the next 18 minutes brother Adam spends talking about scoffers in the last days so if you have your Bible Casa uh pull up uh he reads 2 Peter 3: 3 and 4 for so this is the first verse brother am reads right after reading his text he talks about scoffers and he spends quite a bit of time on this uh starting with scoffers remember he's in a mixed audience they're not all message Believers they're all Pentecostals though they all believe in Divine Healing they all believe in Jesus Christ as Messiah they're businessmen and uh it's a non-denominational Gathering he says now we're warned in in the doctrine of this in the last days will be scorned at the doctrine of the Rapture will be scorned at right just like we saw with you know John rich and Tucker Carlson I've had three or four people text me over these last few months or so just uh belittling me because I believe in the pre-tribulation Rapture they have nothing to stand on uh they all they can do is name call really but brother Braham said that has to be in the last days because it's prophesied knowing this that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust so again that's something we got to keep in mind anyone that attacks the message we have to look at their lives and see are they living in sin or are they living in Holiness if they're living in sin in the lust of their flesh and pride of life lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh then they're a scoffer now but if they're sincerely trying to understand they'll have a humble Spirit about them right if you really want to know something and you're really a real Christian you'll have a humble Spirit not an angry attacking kind of spirit like these scoffers right like brother Rand he's going to give some examples here in a little bit but you'll notice one thing about them they're always walking after their lust that's why I told you know these groups that leave the message that I've got in contact with some of them won't even share some of the things they do uh they they won't tell you their ideas about hair they won't tell you their ideas about uh dresses and pans they won't they won't say it they'll just attack brother brandham because they know if they say they're lust we're going to call them out right and that will expose them when they start compromising on the word of God when they start adopting Abominations it EXP oses them as scoffers as Peter said which was really the Holy Ghost predicting it that's right that's right and saying where is the promise of his coming since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so they're saying where is the rapture where is Jesus where's his coming you've been saying this for so long everything's just been going the same way it's always been for this they are willingly ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and Earth standing out of the water and the and the water in the water now I'm quoting by yeah standing out of the water and in the water thank you whereby the world that was being overflow with water perish so Peter gets the same inspiration of just like uh just like Luke CAU Jesus inspiration as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man Peter gets the same Revelation just like they doubt the flood they'll doubt Jesus Second Coming hallelujah amen it's the same Spirit scoffers uh that want to live in sin now brother gets done there and he says now we see that the reason the subject is so lightened at or attacked is because the prophet here has said that in the last days these scoffers would come saying these things see it's predicted the reason the people are acting today the way they're acting why you certainly are expecting it because the Bible said that now Church you're the same as me when we see these uh uh liberals or radicals when we say these things or when we hear them say the things they say it shocks us but really if we actually think about it it's it's exactly what was prophesied to come lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God a great Falling Away now but it's shocking in the in the purity of our hearts it's shocking to see it actually in front of us right to see the video or it's shocking but it's actually the scripture because God's word not one jot or title will pass away from this word hallelujah someone's got to fulfill the scoffers if this is like the days of Noah the days of lot if this is also uh like the days of Enoch and all these things we've got to have uh scoffers around that are mocking Christ mocking Christianity and they are and they're fulfilling the scripture brother now quote second Timothy 3 in the last days they'll be heady high-m minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God truth Breakers promise Breakers false accusers incontinent remember that's a lacking self-control especially sexually and of course with alcohol incontinent Des desis of those that are good having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away Hallelujah brother Bram said can we look for an impersonation of Truth certainly now brother is going to give some examples of scoffers in the last day and I got two for you I kind of mentioned one on Wednesday night to the supreme court of justice but I got two for you here tonight I think you like these here brother man breaks into he said there were scoffers in Moses's day he said and then there was also impersonators Janice and jambre Hallelujah and that's what Paul said would be like the end times right as right there in second Timothy chapter 3 he said this has to happen because Satan is the God of this world the Bible calls him the God of this world I think it's 2 Corinthians 4:4 honey do you want to pull that up there uh the God of this the God of this world that doesn't mean uh he's to be worshiped or or that doesn't mean like he's greater than God it just means god gave him Dominion because he defeated he overcame Adam and Eve is that it second Corinthians 4:4 yes God of this world thank you Lord I had forgotten that one um in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who the image of God should shine unto them you know I've heard people say uh if there's a God why would he make a place like this well God didn't make this place Satan made all this sin when God made it God made it good Hallelujah and then the creatures the the two in the image that that God made to have dominion over it they fell to Satan so God did not do all this sin sin's a perversion sin's not a creation sin's a perversion Hallelujah and Satan of course deceived Eve uh Adam has some guilt in there it's quite quite a mystery right that whole scripture there that whole set of verses why would a man leave his wife there uh if he's there why would he just stand there not say anything uh if if that's the case but if it's other case why would she be wandering away from him now that remember that uh drama we watch said they were played in hide and- seek and remember that Adam eve were playing hideand-seek and then she hid so good that Adam can't couldn't find her now that that's kind of a childish idea but uh it just you know it's hard to understand you know how could where was Adam you know where we we don't know but there's scoffers and Satan's the God of this world so Satan is also the prince and power of the air right and especially in this day the air waves right the radio waves and the internet waves Satan controls most of what comes out of there Hallelujah the God of this world and then brother man breaks into a second example after Moses's day and Janice and jamrose he breaks into a man from England he said scoffers I was reading a paper two weeks ago in Tucson there was some English man from England made a statement it's the headlines in the paper that the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus was only fake between pilate and Jesus so this brother said this was in the paper just to make himself something so Jesus just put a he he did a fake crucifixion to make himself look like he raised from the dead brother R said this was in the two- sound paper now look what brother R says there's no way that we could disprove that to them you and I we have no proof I like I like how brother says that in other words we can't make somebody believe we can present the evidence listen we can present the evidence and all the all the facts and all the number of Scrolls that we have far out number any secular Scrolls all these uh Scrolls of the Bible but it takes that person that scoffer it takes them coming under conviction of the Holy Ghost recognizing the truth repenting of their unbelief and believing the truth it takes that it takes their individual free moreal agency to be saved you and I can't save anybody praise God right well that takes us back to hadie Wright how did she do that it must have been it was the boy's will to be saved right cuz hatri can't force anybody to be saved brother man said I can't heal anybody you and I we can't save anybody any preacher preaching salvation by Christ is not a divine Savior and the church said so when hadri spoke to the boys there spoke about that that was God's perfect timing for them to repent Hallelujah God knew they wanted and look they were even snickering at it a few seconds there but then the power of the Holy Spirit fell and said give her whatever she wants Hallelujah that's right and she wanted the salvation of the souls and so in the moment the Holy Spirit convicted them and they the brother said they threw themselves down at her feet and were crying and wept their way to Calvary amen see but with these scoffers we can't make them believe I I was discouraged a few years ago I thought why can't I get more of these people that leave the message to come back and well now I know it's because I can't do it I I thought my brother William if I can prove this if I can show them all the water B isms the Lord Jesus if I can show them all these six thus say the Lord that come to pass surely they'll believe it and the people say oh that's not good enough that doesn't convince me what you you told something in the name of the Lord and it came to pass and that's not good enough for you see it shows they love the things of the world but they're under the anointing of scoffing thank God we're under the anointing of the spirit of truth hallelujah that we can see it Hallelujah they can't see it but we can see it Hallelujah brother say there's no no way we could disprove that that Jesus faked his crucifixion to them because all the things of God is to Beed by faith we must believe it that's why church we have to remember you know we get into the deep things of the message we have to remember now every now and then to say I believe Jesus died and rose again I believe in the resurrection we got to get back to the Simplicity sometimes of the Gospel right just stating that with our words with our desires with our faith Hallelujah I believe Jesus died and rose again Hallelujah I believe he's alive forever more Hallelujah I believe all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto Jesus Christ Hallelujah because it's what we we must believe it the individual must believe it Hallelujah and then brother BR breaks at the 19-minute Mark and I try to give these minute Marks here he broke into this thought of how we need a message for every time period he said our last great Reformation was Pentecost 1906 he said but it's he gives us thought numerous time during this sermon he said the the the revivals is word on top a word he said Luther had a word justification he said but Wesley brought another word that's right we don't get rid of Luther we keep Luther's word if it's in the Bible right all he had a lot of things outside the Bible he wasn't perfect like brother BR wasn't perfect he said some things outside the Bible but what he taught from the word of God was the truth and he said God takes that word the J live by faith Builds on that sanctification and then he builds on that the nine gifts of the holy spirit brother said but see now God's doing something else he said then he begins talking about the Seven Seals but brother said it's all the word it's God building he said it's like the life in the stock of wheat I think my children saw the Harvest out in the field this week didn't they I said I think I looked out there and I saw I said it's Harvest Time one of these years right I hope it's 2024 I hope the Rapture is this year it might be next year we don't know but it's always a good reminder there's a season for the Rapture Hallelujah brother say it's like that it's like the the the life in the stalk of wheat he said Luther was like the the Chute and then the stalk uh Wesley uh and then the chaff he says like Pentecost but the wheat now the life is in the wheat seed and brother said that's his ministry the life is in maturity it's back in the wheat because we are the seed of God hallelujah and brother said that he said you can't beat nature Hallelujah if Luther had to restore with the beginning Foundation that it's just like that wheat seed the church has to be built up the church has got to grow amen amen the church has got to keep receiving more life and come to a maturity to where we bring the Original Seed glory to God the original seed that fell down in other words the day of Pentecost the power of Pentecost we've got to bring that back to the church hallelujah amen I believe we had we've seen brother like said we've seen portions of it he said but we want to see more of it remember perfect Faith remember perfect faith I preach that now it's about been about a year brother B said we've seen Apostolic times he said but we want to see more of it what is it going to take he said a real shaving down for us see that's why we got to keep coming back to church get shaved down right let the shepherd Holy Spirit shave off all your wool shave you down make you make you lighter right make you free in the Lord hallelujah he said just like the life in the stalk and then brother BR talked about a a scoffer that scoffed at him brother Braham said there was a scoffer also who wrote about him in one of his books and he said if there ever was a fanatic it's William brandham he said a magician he said he said William brandham was a magician and he said uh he said oh and then he said in this book he said he was an atheist he said brother R preaches about a God he said a God who sat back and put his hands on his tummy uh during the Dark Age and watch as God let all these women and children die and be killed martyred this is what the atheist wrote he writes a brother man believes in that kind of God who would would would hold his tummy and laugh at all the martyrs dying and brother said that man is so blind he said God wasn't watching it laughing like that he said it's God letting the seed go down into the ground Hallelujah a seed must be planted in corruption and then it raises in incorruption hallelujah hallelujah there's people that they have to know Jesus in the power Sor the power of His manifestation power of his resurrection and the and the fellowship of his sufferings Hallelujah and that lines up with the Seven Seals the ax anointing that's right there's a generations and and hundreds of years that had to know Christ as with that ax anointing give their life as a sacrifice as Christ Christ gave his life Hallelujah but then there was a man age Hallelujah and then now Church we're in the Flying Eagle age Hallelujah Eagle represents God or a prophet where the carcass is the Eagles to be gathered represents the birds that fly above worldly things Hallelujah and they only come down to Feast on the word of God and then they fly back up to safety hallelujah amen we saw two eagles flying over our house was it this week or last week I got video of it there's a male and female Christ in the church they're doing some Maiden thing or something like that yeah they weren't fighting right they weren't fighting they were doing some type of a mating thing there so I thought that's really good I don't know if I've ever seen that flying over my own house Hallelujah so I thank the Lord for that now I'm not trying to be super spiritual I'm just thankful you know because I've seen uh Eagles driving to cam church right out in the field that doesn't mean NE necessarily anything it's just a good omen Hallelujah it just makes you feel good it reminds you of God's grace and mercy amen hallelujah brother said see this man does it understand the martyrs the corn of wheat he said has to fall on the ground but it'll be raised again Hallelujah then brother man he says now he talks about more scoffers he said over in England the teenagers are on the TV at churches saying calling Jesus Daddo but BR said what a shame daddo's like hey dude or bruh now's the one bruh I think there's probably a new one too but like they say Jesus is BR my BR I don't know don't don't don't take me literally but uh and then there's you know for Our Generation my wife and I uh we had friends that had a church said Jesus is my homeboy Jesus is not your homeboy he's your Holy Savior the Son of God the Lamb of God see brother man said they see they start scoffing by making Jesus less they lose their fear of the Lord amen they got a partial fear of the Lord K was reading this week and she said Daddy every time now I see the fear of the Lord she says I think is it partial or full I said that's a good thought you keep those good spiritual thoughts coming honey cuz we don't want a partial I mean if anyone's going to have a partial be someone like us that really have fear of God and Satan will try to discourage us or make us pull down our standards but we got to keep the standards High Hallelujah we got to remember to fear God hate evil depart from Evil that's the beginning of wisdom hallelujah hallelujah he said they're calling Jesus Daddyo or like Jesus my buddy today or Jesus is uh my bruh or something like that a homeboy this is the type of uh scoffing that's going on today you know you I've even seen it too you know some preachers even cussing from the pulpit now people not message people but just in you know General it gets too loose sometimes Church brother brother said it gets too loose he said you got to get out the belt and tighten up the belt Hallelujah if our standards get a little loose we got to tighten up and brother said get your gear all tightened up and get ready to fight a battle Hallelujah Satan's trying to make us feel uh less connected to God but he said you got to put on the full armor of God hallelujah remember the belt of Truth was the mind he said be sober in your minds Peter said putting on the belt of Truth so having our minds sharp we're not going to lose the fear of the Lord we're not going to uh kind of make Jesus less than what he is we're going to keep him high lifted up Hallelujah then brother BR said another United States preacher now look he's going through all these TA of scoffers he said this us preacher said the crucifixion was fake and Jesus had a man drank weed and he said kind of like a marijuana that's listen brother BR that's what he said it was kind of like marijuana and Jesus slept for two or three days but then he woke up and then he went up to uh India and married a wife and everything like that brother man said think of that making Jesus like he was trying to fake a religion but brother said the scoffers are fulfilling prophecy he said they're the men ordained to fulfill that word about scoffing Hallelujah he said in every age God ordained men like Moses he said the Son of God Jesus in every age he for ordained his men brother R said nothing is out of cater ah Church we're right where we need to be God the God's timing God's clock is working perfectly Hallelujah his eternal clock amen it's better than atomic clock amen I appreciate that clock sisters I think sister Z got his that clock that's a good clock but God's timing is eternal it's perfect brother said he won't come one minute late one minute early the Rapture will be right on time and we won't miss it Hallelujah why cuz we're making ready for it that's why we're here today to make ready for keep washing those dishes as Wednesday night's Story the armor company brother R said keep washing dishes he's coming back for you Hallelujah he promised you amen he promised in your word in the word and he promised in your heart amen that's right Hallelujah nothing's out of cater and now at the 23 minute Mark brother random begins doing apologetics that's defending the truth so brother gives a few scoffing stories but now he shows how they're wrong that's called apologetics your pastor does that sometimes all the time he said the first reason they're wrong that Jesus drank this mandri weed and and faked his death was because the Bible said he was offered the vinegar but he spit it out right so the preacher saying see you know when the when the when the soldier put that vinegar up to him that was actually Mand Drake weed he drank it in and then he fell asleep for three days he woke up he never really died he went off and married Mary Magdalene in India and brother said see Let me show the the silliness of that he said GE the Bible said Jesus refused it right he refused the vinegar so right there their argument their whole newspaper article fails right there you might as well burn that paper it's better for paper to be burned Hallelujah than to read nonsense like that then he reads a second one the second proof is that Jesus's life exactly fulfilled every Prophecy of the Old Testament he says uh for a man to predict something he said you have one out of a million chance he said but then tell where would happen you have a one out of 10 million chance and then he says uh all the details what happened now you're on a 100 million of getting it right and there's hundreds of prophecies Jesus fulfilled and Jesus met every single one of them written 4,000 years before he was here even before crucifixion was invented David said I stare at my bones Hallelujah even before it was invented God allowed to be prophesied and brother said that's proof these people are scoffers but we believe Jesus is Alive amen and that's only two proofs and brother R said the third proof this is the third and final one he does he said if Jesus faked his death he said why would all those Apostles give their lives as Martyrs and die for a lie because they would have known it was fake you say well uh the Muslims uh will die for a lie yeah but they die in a different way they die with murder not with self-sacrifice the church said that's a huge difference people say well Muslims they must be sincere uh uh they do suicide bombings yeah they're sincerely possessed possessed with Devils because when all the apostles died they died as a sacrifice no one else died in fact uh some of the church age Messengers and polycarp of them uh polycarp yeah that's right when he come back from Rome they said polycarp if you don't turn yourself in we're going to kill this whole village of Christians polycarp 90 years old went there and gave his life and was burned at the stake in order to save others lives see those Muslim extremists they're trying to kill people with their deaths Christians are trying to save people with their death Hallelujah and that's the third proof brother said brother said no man will die for a faker die as a sacrifice right those Muslim extremists they're dying as murderers not like Christians Hallelujah everybody see that so three proofs he already uh refutes some of these arguments he's doing apologetics here I like that brother BR prove all things brother Ram said because the Bible says that and then he said oh yeah he does the fourth one yeah and then uh he he said uh Moses they say Moses didn't actually go through uh uh the Red Sea or whatever uh he said Moses just went through the the real shallow water where the Reeds were and brother bam said I I I I'll give you to know the Bible says the water stood up on themselves so see their claims don't match the scripture Hallelujah see the Bible they're putting something in the Bible oh the Bible never said they went through the reads see it's the devil bringing it's the devil bringing doubts upon the word of God but God's here to remind us go back to the word the word Can't Fail don't take one word away don't add one word the word is life Hallelujah brother gives four proofs that doesn't match with the rest of the infallible scripture hallelujah oh yeah brother R gives a fifth one well no this just an example of a scoffer sorry he said uh you saw it recently astronauts went up into space and they come back and they said I renounce my faith because when I went up in space I was expecting to see the Throne of God and I didn't see anything so there must be no God brother Braham said how sad they lost uh to he said to think that God would would have a home some somewhere up there like by the planets or something like that the Bible never said God would be up upon the planets right the Bible never said Heaven is outside of Earth's atmosphere so brother shows these scoffers like God would let it be seen up there he said the church has become a Ragweed Church too much education too much science he said that's of the devil right all this doubting about uh the word of God he said this civilization is going to be destroyed he said there'll be no cars there'll be no automobiles think of that there'll be no planes in the Millennium because we'll travel like a thought Hallelujah he said Cain's people focused on science Seth people called upon the Lord hallelujah glory to God at the 26 minute mark he says the Catholic Church made a statement recently the Bible is just a history book and he said the Catholic Church said well the Bible wasn't actually available until 250 years ago that been around the late 1600s so the Catholic church was saying because of that you we only had the Bible 250 years but said that's a lie he said but he says uh the Catholic Church says because of that see we got to file the traditions of the church because we haven't had the Bible very long brother brandom said this quote what a subtle lie that is brother said we've had the Bible 3,000 years before Christ he says hallelujah he says even before Christ came he said but what do they do they're making fun of the Bible they're trying to substitute the Bible for tradition or the Bible for science or the Bible or for Liberation or he says freedom of women he calls it which is uh slavery of women to the devil right brother they're making fun of the Bible and look his emphasis with scoffers is they're going to be judged by the word of God he says everyone will be judged by the word because Christ is the word brother saying if God judges the the the World by the Catholic Church which Catholic church if God judges it by the Baptist which Baptist Church if he judges it by the message which Message Church brother said he'll do neither he'll judge it by his word and Christ is the word amen see we all got the same judgment standard it's the word of God that's why if we remain humble he'll guide us into all truth as he promised that's how we know that we have Humble Hearts he we get more truth as time goes on brother said they're trying to push out the Bible and take Creeds and walk by it Hallelujah he said this revival of his now he breaks into his Revival has been sweeping for 20 years and it will never be a denomination now you know I preached this before uh any church that adds a man-made Creed if they don't repent of that they become a denomination right so the message itself all the bible promises we have like acts 238 right uh Hebrews 1 uh 2 about uh God's one person all the revelations father and Holy Ghost you know all all the truth of the Bible uh the serpent seed everything that we have Seven Seals all that is the truth of God's word hallelujah and it's been sweeping all those truths cannot be denominated Hallelujah other words brother R said you never put a period after what you believe you put a comma after what you believe Hallelujah and then brother breaks into this he said uh he says there's been blackouts going all over the east coast and all around the world he said people are wondering what is it he said it's a sign of the days we're living in and he goes back to the seven uh the seven Church age circles that were drawn in the back of Bram Tabernacle so if this was if this was Bram Tabernacle it be right above Acacia that's where those seven circles were drawn with the The partially shaded out areas of the light of the church ages so brother he's trying to get them to see modern things modern things happening are signs of the blackout in the churches that's right they're blacking out on the word of God they don't want the real word of God but I know you and I want the real word of God I know there's just a little light in that seventh circle but that little light is the light we're going to walk in Hallelujah I walk in the light such a beautiful light it shines where the D Drops of Mercy our bride amen shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of this world Amen he's the light of the church Hallelujah and then he quotes Zechariah which I've never I need to grow with this scripture I've never been able to fully understand that uh it shall be light about the evening time so I've never quite understood the context of that so that's why you never heard me preach on it because I can't understand that chapter of Zechariah but one day I will by God's grace Hallelujah because I'm looking at the context brother I talked about how the pillar of fire uh made those moons uh blacked out in the same forms of the church ages at brandham Tabernacle and he said Church Christ could come for his church at any time but there then all the scriptures have to be fulfilled Hallelujah now I'm about ready he's almost done with the scoffers so bear with me just a moment here we'll move on to the next section see brother said see the scoffers they didn't know what they were doing and he uses Caiaphas as an example Kai is there uh he's trying to murder Jesus but the bi but the Bible said he prophesied he's got a hatred towards Jesus but that must have left him for a moment and the Holy Spirit got on him and he prophesied and said it's expedient that one man died for the whole nation and then that Spirit must have left him right because then he rips he he rip he rips his clothes garments and slaps him they spit on him the Son of God think about that think how quickly they go from under the anointing and out the anointing God help us to stay in the anointing day and night Hallelujah not be double-minded like we've been preaching on Cai is brother said they brother said they were singing my God my God why has Thou forsaken me in the temple while Jesus is out there saying it on the cross and brother said they're so blinded they couldn't even see it they still couldn't see it they're singing that song on that Friday Friday after afternoon they're singing the song and they they hear him say it but they can't connect they can't put it together he said because they were ordained to be scoffers but brother man said look at God's grace Jesus even prayed father forgive them they don't know what they're doing there were some people in there that didn't know what they were doing and so Jesus prayed for Mercy hallelujah oh it's beautiful brother Ram now then he takes that verse about Caiaphas and he brings in he said Caiaphas was blind to it he brings in Revelation 3 I believe 17 he said they'll be miserable wretched poor blind blind and naked and he says blind he said they're blind to the word of God they're scoffing at it making fun of it Hallelujah but see it's falling under the anointing for this day see we we got to fall under the Holy Spirit they're falling under the anti-christ spirit right the pale horse rider oh thank God that we got the eagle anointing Hallelujah the lying you anointing the scoffers are against this word against this Revelation but we fly above the scoffing now I gave you this example let me give you two modern day scoffers I thought hope you like these these the recent Supreme Court justice as I said last week was asked when when she was getting approved what is a woman and she said I don't know you got I'm not a biologist and now she's sitting on the Supreme Court think about that the woman interpreting all the laws how they apply doesn't know what a woman is well I'm sorry there's a lot of laws about men and women right and then I saw this meme I thought I'd share with you just the the words of it if she can't Define a woman why is she campaigning for the first woman president how can you know she's a woman she might be a man she might be a man like some of our previous presidents and their spouses no I'm just I'm just being silly but look at that they say I don't know a woman I don't know what a woman is but we want the first woman present that's plain blindness everybody see that that's spiritual blindness that's called lying through your teeth like a hypocrite that's kind of rough but that's the truth see they're Anointed with that Spirit to lie and yet this person's exalted now some of I'm sure there's three or four just like that they're just the same I'm not picking out on this person yeah there's three or four on the on maybe two or three on the court just like that person but then they're looked at too as they're the ones who really have wisdom to interpret the law and they don't even know what a woman is just look at the XY chromosomes that's all you really got to do Mercy now this second one I thought you like this one this was I heard this uh Ken on uh not kenam it was uh Ray Comfort Ray Comfort how many know this astrophysicist named Neil Degrassi Tyson everybody heard of him well he really gives Christians a hard time he's atheist but I heard him say this uh uh interview asked him uh where does human life come from and he said we are literally Stardust he said he was asked on the origin of the world where uh where did we come from he said Stardust we come from the stars now Church in one way he's a million miles off in another way he's kind of close so bear with me here so let me read what the history says he's a well-known astrophysicist and he emphasizes that human life is deeply connected to the cosmos how many would say Amen to that I'll say Amen to that yeah yeah yeah human life got here from the cosmos but it's from the creator of the cosmos not from the cosmos themselves his statement about beings made of Stardust refers to the scientific now this ain't scientific so here's the LIE this ridiculous concept they call it scientific based on the origins of the elements that make up everything including living organisms so his argument goes back to where did all these elements come from they must have come from the Stars that's his argument okay now let me tell you how these elements came into humans that we have today in the early Universe only the lighter elements like hydrogen and helium were present now I'm a long ways from remembering my chemistry class so I I'm just reading this I don't understand any of this except for at the end there it is let me okay yeah over time stars formed and through nuclear fusion they produced heavier elements such as carbon oxygen nitrogen and iron these elements are crucial for Life as we know it when stars reach the end of their life cycles what do they do they have Supernova explosions good buddy good so he says uh he says there's all these elements out there and the nuclear fision and all the gases up there create these Stars okay like like that's scientific right like they've never proved that he says but then they the stars explode and the and they release these element M into outer space so first there was the lighter elements and then after all this Fusion you had stars and the Stars exploded and released all these heavier elements that makes no sense but here's what he says over billions of years this Stardust colest who knows what colest means come it means come together to form one mass or whole unite join together or combine so after all these Stars exploded everything just kind of comes together all these elements just kind of find their way to come together now you and I have enough sense to know that if we go get some dynamite and we go explode something out there out there in the churchyard you know in a million years it's never going to come back together in fact let's take one of your greatest enemies let's take your cell phone and let's go explode out let's go put some Dynamite on there I'm just joking and let's explode it and let's see if that ever will come back together through the the Sun and everything it's never going to happen this is what a smart astrophysicist does you know I looked up his job description he don't have a very hard job they look at data they teach it they make guesses they look at some more data they and analyze it they teach it they're just a bunch of smart know nothings as far as know nothing about the word of God who have they helped nobody they've only helped bring people's Faith down in Christ and this ties in with last week remember the Bible said there's all these it's the foolishness of the world this is foolish yeah people look at them and say oh he's a doctor or they Supreme Court Justice M they're really to be respected you should respect them and it's foolishness they can't Define a woman and God defines it just by your own sight Hallelujah can tell a woman right and then Common Sense any science remember science must be repeatable right have they taught you the scientific method you have to observe something and it has to be repeatable over and over again if you can't observe it and you doesn't repeat it's not science it's it's imagination it's a fallacy it's a fable it's a fairy tale amen and so this astrophysicist is giving people fairy tales when the word of God says let there be light and there was Hallelujah the word of God explains it perfectly brother BR said it like this God spoke the word he believed it and then it came to pass God believed his own word hallelujah oh amen Oh Glory to God over billions of years this uh dust star dust cast into new stars planets and eventually it turned into living organisms Stardust that's complete nonsense so there's no scientific method you can't prove this this is a fairy tale just like the the evidence you can defeat uh Evolution very simply right first of all uh there's never been an organism add DNA data to their DNA right so for a monkey to go from a human he needs some different DNA added to him and no organism has ever added DNA information to another one right whatever is in the seed that's what it's going to be can't add information in there right to produce a new like a it's never happened naturally right and the second proof there's no evolution is we never how come today we don't see any organisms turn like in the middle turning into from like a monkey to a human right or like uh a dog into a ape or something like that you know I don't you don't see any like mixture uh evolving creatures whatever the creature is that's what it is because God made it and God said it's good Hallelujah I love how Ray Comfort says uh well if the chicken or the egg was first well then who was who who Evolved first was it the the female chicken or the the the male chicken that's a good question if the female evolved there's no male how's it going to reproduce it ain't going to reproduce well now you got to have some really smart Stardust that makes a male and female at just the right time over millions of years that's some pretty smart Stardust I'd like to get some of that can create me some I don't know create me some help I don't know that's really really pretty powerful Stardust right there it's basically saying that stars listen listen what it's saying it's basically saying Stars contain DNA because DNA is the building blocks of life Zion asked me recently daddy how tall are you or how tall is Malachi I said or Malachi is taller than you I said because that was in his DNA buddy he's like okay like he understands that you know I said there's a there's a plan in in in your blood I said Z I'm sure he was catching this lesson there's there's a plan written in the cells of your blood and it says make the hair this color right make the eyes this color and make make make the the legs this long and all it does uh the living things the blood cells just do those white blood cells they do what's written there in the DNA they just go to heal and they go to attack the germs they go to build all the bone cells you know it's already in there God put it in there praise God but this smart guy the scoffer is saying there's DNA in the Stars I'm sorry you won't find that in science my goodness how many thankful that we have the simple plain Gospel of Jesus Christ and these people are they go on the uh to promote their latest book or their latest lie they go on these night shows and they're so honored and revered fools the Bible said right God has made the wise of this world fools oh you're a judge but you don't know what a boy or girl is you're the greatest judge in one of the greatest nine judges in the world really and you don't even know what a girl is or a woman and then you're the smartest astrophysicist ever believe in fairy tales oh thank God for the truth of the word hallelujah now brother R now he moves off of scoffers and that's where I'm going to move off of scoffers here and then he gets into Revelation the importance of Revelation for a moment so let's look at a few that he preaches about eight minutes on Revelation then he gets into a lection all in this sermon on the Rapture brother said but the Rapture is a revel ation to the bride and he said she'll be waiting for that Revelation how many waiting for it that's why I don't want to miss church that's why I don't want to miss a day to read my Bible or pray I don't want to miss it I want to stay in the word of God hallelujah brother bam said Revelation is faith faith is a revelation he says and notice it's like when Abraham could call those things not as though they were now this was a great lesson to me in here great lesson to all of us I'm going to PR preach it Lord willing I'm going to preach a sermon on Divine Healing again just to kind of show again the there there's all these Extremes in Divine Healing right my wife and I we've been finding quotes where brother man says you can't tell God anything to do you can't speak anything what you want you got to do what God wants but there's other quotes that say speak the word whatever you want you got quotes on both sides amen hallelujah and I just read yesterday where uh that that sister stad cleff she's from Germany her husband was a German soldier uh she was there in Mexico when they brought the dead baby to brother brandham the baby was dead all day it died in the morning and they took it to the doctor uh they uh they took the doctor they brought to brother r that night she pushed her way through the crowd right brother saw the vision pray for the baby came back to life after a day of being dead sister stad saw that she flew back to Germany she had a baby the baby died and said brother ram my husband's in the military he's going to fly you over here so you can pray for the baby and brother R said let me pray about that first brother said other brothers were saying yes God's going to raise up the baby brother said let me pray about it first remember for two days he didn't get an answer the third day the Lord said don't touch it that's my hand don't rebuke that remember that now why didn't she just speak the word because it was God's will to take the child does see we need some maturity around the message praise God well I thought every uh a positive attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass it will if it's revealed to you glory amen I'm getting in my sermon ahead of time okay I'm kind of preaching my Divine Healing sermon already but that's true that quote Works any positive attitude toward the promise of God that God's revealed to you will bring it to pass Hallelujah but still in every case you have to find the will of God hallelujah and you know what that woman C call called up brother crying and I I got the quote brother BR was saying or she said well brother Brandon what was the problem was it the weakness of my faith he said no sister you had great faith amen what my child died and I had great faith brother said yes you had great faith it was God testing your faith Hallelujah so see church that that's that's a great balance there you can have great faith this is why I want to preach the extremes I'm already preaching my sermon but since I'm already in it I'm going to say it you can have great faith and not get your answer or you can have little faith or no faith and God answer your prayer but see it that's why it's it's so sad when people say God will once to heal every single time what about sister stad Cliffe see it's totally unbalanced and remember the Lutheran Dean brother wrote a letter and put it out uh to brother Bram said I just want to say I appreciate brother brandham how he waited to get a clearcut decision from God before he said something about the baby see brother and so in other words brother saying find the will of God first before you speak something now unless you're led to speak by the Holy Spirit and that ties perfectly into the scripture about Abraham Hallelujah where brother R said it he said faith is a revelation just like it was revealed to Abraham how could Abraham call those things not as though they were because God had revealed to him that he was going to have a child through Sarah amen and if God had told him that then he could call his old body he could call the deadness of his loins he could call this this is a lie because God has already revealed to me I've got faith for Divine Healing and church we can have faith for a Rapture Hallelujah because it's in the scripture praise God right 1 Thessalonians 4 uh 1 Corinthians 15:51 to 58 the Rapture is in the Bible praise God we just got to make sure we've got the token to go in the Rapture Allelujah Hallelujah that's why this this message is so important he lays that in there Abraham could only call it not because he had a thus sayith the Lord like I told that example for you young people I had a friend uh he's a little older than you guys he was right out he's about 19 years old and my friend said this he said I claim that girl I'm going to marry that girl I claim her he was trying to speak the word like a real uh flying high an eagle anointed person or something like that right he was just he was just you know he heard brother ramam say claim things and without the context he claims it well within a year she she she didn't even give this guy a minute of the day and she within a year she married some other handsome guy over there then he's got he kind of got discouraged but then you know he had to wait a little while he had to learn that you just can't claim everything you want that's right you got to be led by God to claim things amen so think about that any a positive attitude he could had the positive attitude oh even though she's engaged she's still going to marry me well now that's going too far right he could have saw her engaged and said well God's still gonna give her to me God and he'd have to die for them to be rightfully married see every positive any positive promise of or any positive attitude will bring it to pass no it won't unless God showed it to you does everybody understand that that's crucial that's crucial to understand Hallelujah and see it's going to take a balance by the Holy Spirit by God's grace Hallelujah and it's this example brother bam gave too uh brother bam said two apostles were put into prison Peter and James only one of them got out James died he was martyred don't you think the saints were praying for him what made Peter any greater than James right oh did God fail with James no God took his son home when it was his time to go home Hallelujah like brother said he need a Little Flower by his altar you know sometimes in in the in the big churches they put flowers we don't do it here because we're not really denomination we're not but I don't really care about the decorations I mean I could put flowers here but it doesn't mean anything but brother RS uses that imagery he said see God had to pull up James and he needed a flower right by the throne up there he needed a he he wanted his his son or he wanted his daughter he wanted them with him in heaven at that time because God knows the best time God knows more than our time Hallelujah but look at Peter both are men of God Peter gets in prison the church prays and he gets an angel escort he gets the first automatic door before the hat at grocery stores he gets the first automatic door that opens itself right we walk in there and the camera sees us and the doors open Peter had that first Hallelujah yeah I heard a preacher say that I like that one Peter had it first before Walmart had it Peter had it before that the world always copies the word of God but look at that two men one man lives one man dies it was God's will Peter still had to write the statue of perfect man amen I just got that now he still had to write that praise God he had to say build up your faith virtue knowledge patience Temperance God brotherly kindness and receive charity Hallelujah he still had a Ministry to go but God was done with James and that's why people even think you know with this election coming up you know at when President Trump got shot at in Butler the bullet grazed his ear that's caused some people to believe in God because other bullets hit other people one person died two people are finally recovered but it explains that why did did one person live and one person die God's not done with them yet so we can thank God we're still here but I'll say like this we could also thank God if one of us left because then they'd be with God and their work on here would be done now we would mourn yes we would mourn because that's our human emotions just like Jesus Jesus wept he loved Lazarus so much that precious brother he wept he could feel the pain of losing someone he loved but he understood God's got a perfect time God's got a purpose his ways are higher than mine ways hallelujah amen his ways are past finding out God has plans that we don't always understand so see church it's going to take a revelation and I'm almost closing here it's going to take a revelation that's why brother said each person must find the mystery of God's will for their own life find what God has called you to do what God want you to do and then do it with all your heart remember the thief on the cross cross what was his purpose of his life to be right by Jesus to live a wicked life but yet at the very end of his life he'd be a deathbed confession how many people brother William over the last 2,000 years have been saved because of the thief on the cross the hope that even in the final hours before death Jesus will show Mercy if they'll just say remember me Hallelujah if they say God remember me I don't want to be lost may I be with you in heaven and surely Jesus if he's the same yesterday today and forever if he is the same he he'd say the same thing today you'll be up here with me in Paradise hallelujah amen amen that was the purpose of his life he couldn't argue about that he couldn't debate that he couldn't change that he just walked in the plan and purpose for his life he just had to be a testimony to the grace of almighty God are you thankful for Amazing Grace today it's Revelation God's got to give us a revelation of the will of God for our lives I think of all these young people God bless you young people I think of all these young people out there God's got a plan for your life Hallelujah just be humble brother man says it later here just be humble and accept God's plan for your life just wait upon the Lord and he'll renew your strength amen wait on God to reveal it to you don't be in a rush don't be in a hurry Hallelujah wait on the Lord wait for Revelation and then God will show you you uh his will for your life Hallelujah I've told you my testimonies I thought about tell my I always tell my testimonies you guys know my testimonies inside outside you can remember them better than me I always forget him let me try to close but said next a Baptist Minister came to him uh he says uh he didn't agree with brother's teaching on Revelation and the brother said brother Bram you're all mixed up and brother Bram said this listen he said then I pray you'll help straighten me out that's a nice attitude to have well I'm a prophet of God who are you to correct a prophet of God I'm the seven Church age messenger I've got a a Divine gift delivered by an Angel who are you to correct me brother R said I hope you'll help correct me and straighten me out Hallelujah there's a sermon I forget it's in 1965 right before brother Ram died he said he's preaching at the beginning he said there's all these doctorates back here he said I hope they'll correct me if I get something wrong after the service brother BR was willing to be corrected yes brother BR was willing to be correct Ed you think he was lying no he was humble he realized there's majors and minors Hallelujah in fact in the sermon he makes two obvious mistakes he said Enoch was the seventh from Noah look it up all you quote Searchers if you love to search the quotes I do I want to is that right preacher I'd love to go find those quotes he says it twice Enoch was the seventh from Noah I hope you go listen to the sermon this week and then he reads uh the shout voice Trump and he said let's look at our text from second Thessalonians why is that wrong because it was in first Thessalonians anybody been reading their Bible lately shout voice Trump that comes out of first Thessalonians 4 brother manam says let's go to Second Thessalonians church he was in a hurry he was getting pushed out by the woman he's a man Hallelujah but he never said anything wrong with thus sayith the Lord and then then then now now think this then all these people will say oh every word on tape is thus say you can't correct a prophet I'm not trying to correct him he would he would want to be corrected right he would want us if I go try to read second Thessalonians look for shop voice Trump I'm not going to find it how can I preach the shout voice Trump if it's not in second Thessalonians if I believe every word is thus sayith the Lord I ain't gonna find I ain't gonna have nothing to preach out of I have to change my text it's so simple thank God for the humility of the Holy Spirit he says then I pray you'll help straighten me out and then remember in the same sermon brother Ram said nobody corrects a prophet in the same sermon brother Jose brother Bram says I pray you'll help straighten me out and he says I'm open to be corrected in the same sermon later he says there's two kinds of prophet gifts there's the gift of Prophecy in the church and then there's a prophet like a major prophet brother said with a minor prophet in the church if someone would say thus sayith the Lord in here we would need two or three people that have discernment that would judge is this from God or not before we can accept it now we've only had one but I was out that Sunday and that was where it actually said thus sayi the Lord and foretold something I was out that Sunday so we didn't do it that Sunday but you if someone gives a gift the prophecy thus say the Lord tomorrow at this time is going to happen like that like that we would need three people at least two to stand here and pray and say yeah that's the Holy Spirit or no that's a lying Spirit now what a thing to say to your brother or sister talk about love talk about maturity now what what if they were lying would you have would you have the mercy to sayh I think you're off the word here I think you got the wrong Spirit brother sister you got the wrong Spirit the devil got in there and tricked you would you have the grace to say that that's the book of Acts church right there because Peter told ananas and saf you've lied to the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so the same sermon brother says I hope he says I'll pray you'll straighten me out and then later he says but nobody stood before that Prophet to correct him he's talking about Isaiah Jeremiah right who was there brother will to When when when when he had written a virgin shall conceive who is there to correct that nobody right just like when Jeremiah remember Jeremiah had his uh Scrolls written down by somebody who was there to correct Jeremiah nobody he just had a scribe to write it down so that's what brother R is saying any thus sayth the Lord cannot be corrected by a prophet because it's God's word amen thus sayith the Lords don't fail thus sayith the lord it's eternal thus sayith the Lord is life you can hang your soul on thus sayith the Lord hallelujah nobody stands before to correct that now do you prove all things yes you got to go back brother you got to prove all things make sure it comes to pass but brother said nobody stands before a prophet to correct Isaiah no uh you got the wrong word a virgin shall conceive no uh it was something else a virgin shall rejoice in the Holy Ghost no no nobody was there to correct the prophet you understand so in the same sermon brother says correct me and then he says prophets you can't can't stand before a prophet to correct him it's all about the context Hallelujah would you be surprised how many preachers have shared that with me and said oh brother Jesse you're off you're trying to correct the prophet or nobody can stand before a prophet well there's all they're corrected All Through the Bible brother said my wife is my correction I mean what are you gonna do with that his wife was his correction it's just uh it's a I think I told my wife one time we're talking about it it's like a when when someone's fearful and they're wrong they'll just attack to they'll just attack you because they're afraid it's kind of like a wounded animal right you try to help a wounded animal try to attack you that's what some of these preachers you know they're wounded animal or they're wounded Eagles I'll say like that they're wounded Eagles right they they know their they know their logic is wrong so they just attack and anyone that's against me uh I can't love them God help us to have the love of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah wellam said he says we need every we need every word word on word hallelujah I'm going to close here let me close uh 12 let me find one place to close it yeah let me finish with Revelation I'll finish on this thought right here he says brother reads Matthew 16 Upon This Rock I'll build my church it's been revealed by the father brother said it's the spiritual revelation of who Jesus is the revelation of the word in its season he says the Book of Revelation is the last book of the Bible it's sealed to unbelievers see that's why they can't recognize the Seven Seals because they're unbelievers they can't recognize the truth of the Seven Seals brother sayso not add do not take one word away he says the Book of Revelation reveals the author of The Bible he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end it's Jesus Christ and then brother breaks into his ministry he said Jesus has given us the revelation of the seven Church ages the Seven Seals Revelation 107 the days of the sounding of the voice of the seventh angel he says that's the age we're living in the Seven Seals should be opened at that day it won't be something outside the word he said but God will make it fit in with the rest of the scripture amen everybody catch that whatever brother man preached brought To Us by Revelation it has to already be in the Bible it can't be outside the Bible it's got to be something that's in the word of God hallelujah it won't be something outside the word it has to fit with the rest of the scripture and then brother says God don't need no interpreter he's his own interpreter Hallelujah did you know there's a Bible verse though that says the prophet is The Interpreter let me find that real quick yeah job pull up job 33:23 a messenger is called interpreter how many know John the Baptist was called a messenger a forerunner My Messenger will go before my face and prepare prepare the way of the Lord job said if there is a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto man his uprightness Hallelujah so a messenger is an interpreter so what does that mean if brother says uh God doesn't need an interpreter that means the prophet is not adding his own idea the prophets just say what God Said everybody catch that and one again we have quotes on both sides one quote brother says brother R says I cannot interpret God's word and then there's a quote brother said the prophets are interpreters of God's word and I can say Amen to both because you have to take them in the right context Hallelujah every understand that only God gives the real interpretation so God's really the only interpreter Hallelujah but when a prophet speaks thus sayth the Lord he's giving you God's interpretation of the word of God okay I'm trying to help you so when you come across quotes that are seem opposing you'll know the truth behind it and you'll be solid in the word of God the quotes won't make you shake and quiver and uh run and talk to me about it which none of you have ever done but you won't run to your mama or your daddy or your husband or wife and I can't understand this just wait on the Lord he'll renew your strength there are answers church if we just wait upon the Lord let me close brother man said God don't need interpreter he's his own interpreter he said search the scriptures Jesus said for in them you think you have eternal life and there are they which testify of me he said we must believe every part of the word he said Luther's age Wesley's age uh Pentecost and now the Seven Seals he said God is restoring the word of God and brother says Pentecost is still burning so I want you to catch this too it's that portion of the word so brother bam was living in the day after Pentecost how many remember 1906 when I preach on isza street it's been a little while it's been over a year now I hit the highlights of that it was amazing time called it the greatest Revival since the day of Pentecost that's what brother Bram said that's a pretty amazing Revival brother Braham said uh the critics the scoffers here we are scoff scoffers said oh it'll go out in a few years brother maram said it's still burning 1965 54 years later it's still burning brother said you'll never put it out now church if you caught that that means the gifts will never go out of fashion let's go deeper that means justification will never go out of fashion amen that means sanctification will never go out of fashion hallelujah we're always need that the young believers our young believers will always need justification right cuz there's going to come a time when God where the enem is going to test their faith whether they're saved or not if that hasn't happened to you yet brothers and we sister if that hasn't happened yet you rejoice but it's going to come the enem is going to come and try to test your faith are you really saved do I need to get re-baptized again do I have the Holy Ghost oh yeah he's going to come but you got something to fight him off with you got the sword of the spirit hallelujah praise God but said you have to fight for every inch of land that you possess right and then sometimes Satan will try to drive you back em you'll go back to this spot and say am I saved that's where you got to look down and say I nailed a post down there I had an experience there I know God did something right there I'm not going to forget that I'm going to get the rest of my land back Hallelujah he might drive you back to there but don't forget where you come from amen don't forget the promise of God don't forget God is faithful to every generation [Applause] Hallelujah justification still alive sanctification still alive the gifts are still alive hallelujah amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost is still here the Mysteries have been finished hallelujah praise God we're living in the days of the son of man a prophets visit our our nation Hallelujah a prophets visit our world praise God we're living in the coming of the Lord God help us to be ready hallelujah amen well said we're living in the day when the bride is being called out Pentecost is still burning he says hallelujah praise God Amen he he said it's that portion of the word and church that explains why the Israel can still be saved because the Mosaic Covenant is still in effect for them that's what brother said they they they're blinded to the New Covenant so they're still under the Mosaic Covenant but when that 144,000 sees Jesus that davidic Covenant is going to come alive to them because they're going to have a king from the lineage of David rule over Israel the Millennium that Covenant will not fail hallelujah oh my we're closer than ever Amen to Jesus reigning over Israel that's what we're singing marching desion that's a millennium song you know that we're marching up word design now we might might have to March we we'll March if we want to or we can travel like a thought like Star Wars or we not Star Wars star track can travel like a thought that's what Jesus did with his theop or his glorified body he traveled like a thought he go in through the doors in through the walls he could just go wherever he wanted so we can choose to March up with our people that we're ruling over or we can just transport up there Hallelujah I imagine I want to be with my people don't you have mercy don't you think you'd want to be with the people that you're leading and by God's grace you know we're trying to direct them and we got the rod of iron and I'm not trying to be prideful I'm just saying that's the promise of the word of God if you can be faithful with the Revelation he said I'll make you ruler over much amen closing with this the Rapture is only for the bride brother R quotes Revelation 20 he said the rest of the Dead live not till the thousand years were accomplished that's right brother that's the verse I think it's Revelation 12 or 20:4 that's his verse it's only for the bride the Rapture is only for the elect lady the pulled out church thank God he pulled you out of denominations we should have some happy people in here today he could have left you in denominations but he pulled you out hallelujah amen hallelujah he pulled me out he said the holy spirit is calling a church out of a church he's calling a bride out of a church it's that elected forn he said it's the father's spiritual Gene because you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world let's stand to our feet well musicians can come I'm going to pause right there brother man then breaks into election for 10 minutes then he gets back to the Rapture then he gets into Enoch and the shout voice Trump it's a beautiful messag amen I love going through these slowly don't you oh I heard one amen hallelujah I I

them all because he is faithful praise God let's bow our heads father God we thank you for today Lord God lord we're thankful Lord that we're going to be ready for the Rapture Lord God we want that Revelation your Prophet said the Rapture will be a revelation to the bride and Lord surely I can look at my friends outside the message of I can see they don't have a revelation of the Rapture it's
