[24:01] [Music]
[25:46] [Music]
[26:02] let me do just a few announcements real
[26:04] quick
[26:05] the first announcement I wanted to
[26:08] follow up our family started reading the
[26:09] church age book so if you'd like to join
[26:12] us I think we're on page 28 right now
[26:15] but we're just gonna read we read about
[26:17] a page and a half or two pages every
[26:18] night together and so if you want to
[26:20] join us we're gonna read through the
[26:21] church age book we finished the whole
[26:22] Bible now we're gonna go to the church
[26:24] age book by the grace of the Lord so I
[26:25] want to follow up on that
[26:27] also the second announcement brother
[26:29] bang and I kind of had like an impromptu
[26:31] trustee meeting last Sunday and he
[26:34] wanted to know how many people would
[26:36] like to begin saving to buy a church
[26:38] building I told him in your in years
[26:40] past it's been hard to say because of
[26:43] the needs of the Saints and also just
[26:44] because of the the high cost of buying a
[26:47] church and then all the costs that are
[26:49] associated with it but if you would like
[26:52] to do that let me know send me a text or
[26:54] something like that I'd like to know how
[26:57] many would like to do that by the grace
[26:58] of the Lord I think in the last year
[27:00] I've had about three people approached
[27:01] me about that that's something we could
[27:04] look at you know Lord willing not the
[27:07] Lord tarries I hope he doesn't tarry but
[27:09] if he tarries we had something we can
[27:11] look at by the grace of God so that's
[27:14] the second announcement I believe that's
[27:18] it for announcements prayer requests the
[27:22] urgent one is there's a child in my
[27:23] class this year a boy he had he's had
[27:25] the flu three days this week and now
[27:27] it's so bad he can't walk so he's at
[27:29] Akron Children's Hospital so he has pain
[27:33] in his legs and can't walk so the dad
[27:34] was sending me text this morning that's
[27:36] when we lift him up in prayer his name's
[27:38] AJ things AJ Andrew so let's pray for
[27:43] him also sister Connie's van is having

[50:31] will see how far we get by the grace of
[50:34] the Lord revelation 3 verse 20
[50:58] revelation 3 verse 20 quite an
[51:06] interesting week with Billy Graham
[51:07] passing thank God for a servant Lord
[51:10] like Billy Graham we know brother Aaron
[51:12] repeatedly called him an angel to Sodom
[51:14] over and over and no doubt he was an
[51:18] angel of God brother Branham says hardly
[51:21] anyone ever preached justification like
[51:22] he did he said he had it down to a tee
[51:24] trying to get people to come forward and
[51:27] repent and my wife and I were looking we
[51:28] saw some pictures of him preaching the
[51:30] forties he's like leaning down like this
[51:31] preaching he stopped doing that later on
[51:34] as he got older but there was no doubt a
[51:36] lot of fire and zeal in his heart at the
[51:38] beginning and were grateful for a
[51:42] faithful ange of the Lord so Revelation
[51:48] chapter 3 verse 20 I'll read this myself
[51:59] here behold I stand at the door and
[52:01] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[52:04] the door I will come into him and sup
[52:07] with him and he with me to him that
[52:10] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[52:12] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[52:16] I'm sat down with my father in his
[52:19] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[52:21] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[52:23] that's just bow our heads for word of

[52:40] Lord that we must hunger and thirst
[52:42] after righteousness lord help us to
[52:45] remember the power of prayer Lord and
[52:47] the power of gathering whether there be
[52:50] two or three or more in the precious
[52:52] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord we
[52:55] thank you for this opportunity
[52:56] Lord speak to us through this word Lord
[52:58] here as we endeavor to say what the
[53:00] seventh angel said Lord and the seventh
[53:04] angel was speaking to the churches Lord
[53:06] and here we are
[53:07] a church Lord and we want to hear
[53:09] what the Spirit is saying Heavenly
[53:11] Father so bless us Lord in thy divine

[53:22] you'll do it Lord God help us to look
[53:24] for you help us to sense your presence
[53:26] lord help us to believe all your word in
[53:28] Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen
[53:32] god bless your being seated praise the
[53:33] Lord so we like to
[53:47] get part 10 this morning by the grace of
[53:49] the Lord most of us are pretty familiar
[53:50] with the 7 church age it's the church
[53:53] age were living in by God's grace now
[53:58] looking at part 10 part 57 overall of
[54:00] the church ages I think I have maybe one
[54:03] or two more sermons left maybe on the
[54:06] Laodicean Church age and then the series
[54:08] I told y'all Wednesday I'm praying about
[54:09] I've been I've studied quite a few hours
[54:11] and proverbs and Ecclesiastes in job I'm
[54:14] kind of feeling burdened to preach on
[54:16] the wisdom of the Holy Spirit
[54:17] I've also want to preach on the life of
[54:20] Christ you know the whole whole entire
[54:21] life that would be a big long series I'd
[54:24] like to do a prayer series this year
[54:25] I've been looking at leadership and also
[54:28] believe the sign rebuttals like to do
[54:31] that as well and finish you know the
[54:32] series that I've been working on but the
[54:34] nice thing about a pastor has always
[54:35] have time to go back and finish it Lord
[54:37] willing if God Terry's by the grace of
[54:40] the Lord and also I've had three or four
[54:42] ministers help me correct my book so I'm
[54:45] getting more progress on that I think
[54:46] I'll start with my wife going reading
[54:49] edits and then I'll send off to a
[54:50] professional publisher as soon as my
[54:51] wife and I finish editing the book and
[54:54] some of the brothers have already said
[54:55] there it's gonna be a really powerful
[54:56] books I hope it is by the grace of the
[54:59] Lord I hope it's something that people
[55:00] can read and I'll point them right to
[55:02] the Word of God amen so I'm looking
[55:04] forward to that let's look at Christ
[55:06] outside the church that's what the
[55:08] Prophet speaks to us here in the church
[55:10] ages and so we read our text verses 20
[55:13] 21 and 22 now we're gonna look at verse
[55:16] 20 to start off with it's interesting in
[55:19] the church age book the Prophet said
[55:21] this scripture is not to individuals
[55:23] it's to the entire church and then in
[55:26] his sermon in 1960 he said it is to
[55:28] individuals as well so we know there's a
[55:30] dual application to the scripture Jesus
[55:33] is speaking to the church age as a whole
[55:35] but also he's knocking on every
[55:37] individual hearts door as we know the
[55:39] sermon door within a door right we know
[55:41] that sermon from February of 63 so it
[55:45] has a dual application the Prophet said
[55:48] this is one of the most outstanding
[55:50] statements that I've ever seen the New
[55:52] Testament I want you to notice this I
[55:54] stand at the door and knock this is
[55:58] generally used a quotation for the
[56:00] appeal for
[56:00] sinners we tell sinners Jesus is at the
[56:04] door knocking but here he's knocking at
[56:07] the church door for he once walked with
[56:10] them but they with their organization
[56:13] and worldliness and coldness had
[56:15] excluded him he's on the outside of the
[56:17] church now we've got to make sure we
[56:19] don't have an organization per se but we
[56:21] got to make sure this one right here
[56:23] this rascal right here we don't get
[56:24] caught on God and the last few
[56:27] Wednesday's we looked at zeal and
[56:28] fervency I remember when Karen asked me
[56:30] about what's the difference between
[56:31] Zeeland fervency well we found out the
[56:33] last few weeks they're very similar
[56:35] they're like synonyms it's the boiling
[56:37] love of God both words mean to boil when
[56:40] you're boiling with zeidel you're just
[56:41] overflowing with God's love and or
[56:43] overflowing with a purpose in your heart
[56:45] for God it's this boiling over it's this
[56:48] energy the spiritual energy we'd say or
[56:50] spiritual inspiration of the holy spirit
[56:52] that's what we've got to have a zeal to
[56:54] repent and to do the works of God in
[56:56] this hour so we got to make sure we're
[56:59] watching that in our lives so we see
[57:01] that there's a application to the entire
[57:03] church age because here now this is from
[57:07] the sermon now we go to the church age
[57:08] book the Prophet said Heath and ear let
[57:10] him hear what the Spirit say it to the
[57:12] churches so this is a message to the
[57:14] churches as well so this is the message
[57:17] to the church of the last age this is
[57:19] the condition of the Laodicean church as
[57:21] its end nears it is not a personal
[57:26] message to one person it is the spirit
[57:29] telling us where Jesus is Christ has
[57:32] left the church that would be an awful
[57:34] condition to be in this morning if
[57:36] Christ was not in our church can you
[57:40] imagine
[57:41] I'll say like this the anointing can be
[57:42] in churches but Christ could not be in
[57:45] the churches I'm talking about the
[57:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost they can have
[57:50] the anointing in their service the
[57:51] anointing of the Holy Spirit and so
[57:54] forth but not have Christ the person of
[57:56] the Holy Spirit in the Baptism in
[57:59] individual lives that's right because we
[58:01] hear about all the time from our friends
[58:03] God healed this one in the denomination
[58:04] God healed that one God's working and
[58:06] drawing people to repentance the
[58:08] anointing is there but not the person
[58:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[58:13] that's exactly
[58:14] because they reject all the ways to get
[58:16] to him the way to get to the person of
[58:18] Christ its justification and then that
[58:21] sticky one right there sanctification
[58:22] that's the one they don't like because
[58:24] brother Graham said that's the labor
[58:25] that's the labor stage where you've got
[58:27] a labor you've got to get down to
[58:29] business with God you've got to sit in
[58:31] the hot Suns of the wilderness and let
[58:33] all the the light of God baked out all
[58:35] your worldliness amen your worldly
[58:37] habits your worldly thoughts your ideas
[58:39] your own opinions you've got to let it
[58:41] all get baked out so Christ there can be
[58:43] room for Christ in the soul praise the
[58:45] Lord amen now here's a quote in the same
[58:50] sermon from 1960 where brother Graham he
[58:52] stresses it's the individual so he in
[58:54] one place he says it's for the church
[58:56] and then another place he says it's for
[58:58] the individual so it's both we know it's
[59:00] both he says if any man any Methodist
[59:04] Revenue have any former Methodists in
[59:06] here any Baptist we have any former
[59:09] Baptists in here he said any
[59:12] Presbyterian when I was going to the
[59:13] chapel that was a Presbyterian Church I
[59:15] was a former Presbyterian and
[59:17] Pentecostal by birth being raised in a
[59:19] Pentecostal church or any Catholic now
[59:22] many former Catholics in here all right
[59:24] he says or he says any Church of God man
[59:27] any Nazarene man Pentecostal man any man
[59:31] that will hear my voice and will open
[59:33] the door I will come in and sup with him
[59:35] and he with me
[59:36] that's the message to the Pentecostal
[59:38] Church not tried to revive the
[59:40] Pentecostal organization but revive the
[59:44] Pentecostal blessing in whose heart the
[59:47] individuals heart that's the only way
[59:51] and I was up with him and he with me so
[59:53] the only people that are supping with
[59:55] Jesus sitting across the table or
[59:57] sitting next to Jesus and supping and
[59:59] communing and talking you know how you
[1:00:01] like to do that you got like to go out
[1:00:03] to eat and I like to sit across the
[1:00:04] table and look at you and talk with you
[1:00:06] and hear about how your week went and we
[1:00:08] like to sit across we enjoy that we like
[1:00:10] that we enjoy being in one another's
[1:00:12] presence the only people that do that
[1:00:14] with Christ are those who have been
[1:00:16] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:00:19] of Christ amen
[1:00:20] because that's what he's saying say come
[1:00:22] out of the church systems come out right
[1:00:26] come out and be separate saith the Lord
[1:00:28] if you look at it on the church scale
[1:00:30] but on the individual scale he's saying
[1:00:32] open the door and let me come into your
[1:00:34] soul amen
[1:00:35] it's exactly right so see you have both
[1:00:38] applications you can't deny it here he
[1:00:40] says in leadership a few weeks before he
[1:00:42] passed away
[1:00:43] God don't deal with organizations he
[1:00:46] don't deal with groups he deals with
[1:00:48] individuals that's right always not in
[1:00:52] groups individuals one person so to
[1:00:55] prove this how God deals with
[1:00:56] individuals what scripture does the
[1:00:58] Prophet use this is just days after he
[1:01:00] printed the church age book he says in
[1:01:03] the last days he said I stand at the
[1:01:04] door and knock and if any man not any
[1:01:07] group to see the Prophet applies at both
[1:01:09] ways it applies to the church and also
[1:01:12] applies to the individual if any man
[1:01:14] will hear my nook and open I will come
[1:01:18] in and sup with him if any man can hear
[1:01:21] how many of open the door to Christ to
[1:01:23] your life hey man what a blessing how
[1:01:25] many enjoy feasting with Christ you
[1:01:27] enjoy the word he gives you you enjoy
[1:01:30] his fellowship oh my it's all around the
[1:01:33] Word of God hallelujah you can't have
[1:01:35] fellowship with Christ if we're not
[1:01:37] fellowshiping with each other and the
[1:01:39] Word of God that's right now I'm
[1:01:42] finishing the quote from the church age
[1:01:44] but Christ has left the church is this
[1:01:47] not the logical result or end if the
[1:01:50] word is put aside for creed the Holy
[1:01:52] Spirit disposed for Pope's bishops
[1:01:54] presidents counselors etc and the Savior
[1:01:57] set aside for a works program or Church
[1:02:00] joining or some type of conformity to a
[1:02:02] church system what more can be done
[1:02:05] against him this is the apostasy this is
[1:02:09] the falling away this is the open door
[1:02:11] to the Antichrist for one came in his
[1:02:14] father's name Jesus and was not received
[1:02:16] but rejected then there will come
[1:02:18] another with his own name a liar a
[1:02:20] pretender and him they will receive John
[1:02:23] 5:43 the man of sin that son of
[1:02:26] perdition will take over
[1:02:27] now most churches will say we're
[1:02:29] preaching in Jesus name but if you
[1:02:31] really get down to it
[1:02:32] they're preaching in the titles father
[1:02:34] son Holy Ghost praise the Lord cuz you
[1:02:36] said well whose name you going to be
[1:02:37] baptizing father son Holy Ghost they're
[1:02:40] really not come
[1:02:41] in the name of Jesus Christ because when
[1:02:44] you come in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:02:46] bring the power of Christ with you amen
[1:02:49] and it brings power to change the draw
[1:02:52] center your back ciders to repentance
[1:02:54] to heal the body praise God to raise the
[1:02:57] dead or whatever God's calling to make
[1:03:00] tumors vanish whatever God's calling you
[1:03:02] to do the name of Jesus Christ is what
[1:03:05] accomplishes that miracle amen but see
[1:03:09] Christ had left them because they didn't
[1:03:12] want the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[1:03:14] wanted just a church joining in a church
[1:03:16] routine oh my if we get when we get keep
[1:03:20] our spiritual eyes open if we get people
[1:03:22] coming up for the Holy Ghost and today's
[1:03:24] service or future service that ought to
[1:03:27] be the most that be the time that we
[1:03:31] most give to sincere prayer that should
[1:03:34] be time where we're most down to
[1:03:35] business with God saying God fill them
[1:03:38] so they can open their door and let you
[1:03:41] in so they can have fellowship with you
[1:03:43] you ought to care if people were down at
[1:03:45] the altar if you met sup with him you
[1:03:47] want other people to have supper with
[1:03:49] him it's not the time we walk out or
[1:03:52] fall asleep or just put our head down or
[1:03:54] close their eyes and try to think about
[1:03:55] after service that's the time we're
[1:03:57] saying lord help them to surrender help
[1:04:00] them to open the door and help them to
[1:04:02] have fellowship with you hey man that
[1:04:04] that ought to be the climax of every
[1:04:06] service amen brother Brooks called me
[1:04:09] and we talked in last time I was out in
[1:04:10] Iowa said he went back to Iowa City and
[1:04:12] where the brothers were saying we got
[1:04:14] filled with the Holy Ghost and mother
[1:04:15] Jesse was preaching and I said
[1:04:17] hallelujah praise the Lord that's that's
[1:04:19] when it's all about to get people to
[1:04:21] open the door and invite crisis not just
[1:04:24] be a temporary visitor but a permanent
[1:04:27] resident amen
[1:04:29] to be a resident in my life that
[1:04:31] everyday I can have fellowship with
[1:04:34] Christ I don't know about you Church but
[1:04:36] you feel your you see your life more and
[1:04:38] more every day all you do is think about
[1:04:40] Jesus it's like I can't get away from it
[1:04:43] I love it but I guess I can't get it I
[1:04:45] get tired too but even when I'm tired
[1:04:47] and worn out all I can do is think about
[1:04:49] Jesus it's this constant just coming
[1:04:52] back and meditating the Bible calls that
[1:04:54] meditate
[1:04:55] or pondering or thinking on their ways
[1:04:58] everything ultimately goes back whether
[1:05:00] it's you know work or family whatever
[1:05:02] it ultimately all points back to the
[1:05:04] Word of God it all points back to Christ
[1:05:06] and that's what David said think on
[1:05:08] God's ways amen if you think on God's
[1:05:11] ways you'll turn your feet to his pass
[1:05:13] hallelujah
[1:05:14] that's the believer every day their mind
[1:05:16] is just filled with the things of God
[1:05:18] because they're having sup with Christ
[1:05:20] Christ is there he's not somewhere else
[1:05:23] but crisis in my soul praise God God is
[1:05:26] in my soul and I talk with him I think
[1:05:28] about him I fell oh with him and I
[1:05:31] eat what he's feeding me praise God Oh
[1:05:33] hallelujah he's here in my soul he has a
[1:05:37] place at the table Amen hallelujah oh
[1:05:41] but the churches don't have this and it
[1:05:44] could be a message Church it could be
[1:05:45] any because they can denominator by the
[1:05:47] spirit and not by the we'd say the
[1:05:49] written letter on a on a book or
[1:05:51] something like that now after this after
[1:05:54] the random notes that Christ is outside
[1:05:56] the church he goes to the sign in the
[1:05:59] heavens that Christ has left the church
[1:06:02] and he quotes Matthew 24 and to save a
[1:06:08] little time I'm going to skip past this
[1:06:09] quote but he basically compares the
[1:06:12] light on the church ages okay the light
[1:06:16] of the church ages right here he
[1:06:17] compares this to a total eclipse over
[1:06:20] Jerusalem On January of 1964 if you
[1:06:24] remember from the church age book so let
[1:06:26] me go back and the Prophet mentions this
[1:06:28] he said Matthew 24 mentions signs in the
[1:06:30] heavens now immediately after the
[1:06:33] tribulation of those days shall the Sun
[1:06:34] be darkened and the moon shall not give
[1:06:36] her light and the stars shall fall from
[1:06:38] heaven and the powers of heaven shall be
[1:06:40] shaken
[1:06:41] now when the stars fall from heaven that
[1:06:43] of course would be in the sixth seal but
[1:06:45] we see all these signs are leading up to
[1:06:48] the sixth seal right to the to the right
[1:06:50] to the the rapture first and then the
[1:06:53] Tribulation Period there's obviously
[1:06:55] some overlap so the prophet notes how
[1:06:57] there's going to be signs in the skies
[1:07:00] at the coming of the Lord and the
[1:07:03] prophet saw how the moon this moon is
[1:07:06] the type of the bride right because she
[1:07:08] reflects the
[1:07:09] she has no light of her own she reflects
[1:07:11] the light of Christ and the Prophet said
[1:07:13] at the end of the Laodicean age this
[1:07:15] will once the bride goes up this will
[1:07:17] fully be darkened out there'll be no
[1:07:19] more mercy
[1:07:20] there'll be no more grace there'll be no
[1:07:22] more Holy Spirit for the people of the
[1:07:24] world once the bride goes up except
[1:07:26] it'll go to the Jewish people praise God
[1:07:28] now he says it is now think on this the
[1:07:31] church shines in the reflected light of
[1:07:33] Christ he is the son the church is the
[1:07:36] moon thus this orb of light is the moon
[1:07:39] it has decreased from almost a full moon
[1:07:41] in the first age to a sliver in the
[1:07:43] fourth age when the fifth age it begins
[1:07:46] to grown the sixth took a great step
[1:07:47] growth forward in part of the seventh
[1:07:50] age it was still growing when suddenly
[1:07:51] it stopped short and wanted to almost a
[1:07:54] nothingness I'm sorry waned to almost
[1:07:56] nothingness so that instead of light it
[1:07:58] was the blackness of apostasy and at the
[1:08:02] end of the age it had ceased to shine
[1:08:03] for darkness had taken over Christ was
[1:08:06] now outside the church everyone said
[1:08:09] here is the sign in the sky the last
[1:08:13] Eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse
[1:08:16] it waned to a total darkness in seven
[1:08:19] stages and there's the picture in the
[1:08:21] church age book remember this from the
[1:08:22] church age books who's read it lately so
[1:08:25] there are six pictures but the seventh
[1:08:26] was when there was the total eclipse so
[1:08:27] they didn't put that picture on there
[1:08:28] they just put six pictures on there so
[1:08:31] the Prophet is comparing how the light
[1:08:33] gets darkened out in the church ages and
[1:08:35] God gave a sign of that over Jerusalem
[1:08:38] in January of 1964 at Pope John the 6th
[1:08:43] visit to Israel you can look it up it's
[1:08:45] on Wikipedia it's all out there you can
[1:08:47] look it up if you want a program says
[1:08:49] this is a sign he says in the 7th age
[1:08:54] the total darkness came as Pope of Rome
[1:08:56] Paul the six went to Palestine to make a
[1:08:58] holy tour of Jerusalem he was the first
[1:09:01] pope to ever go to Jerusalem he in fact
[1:09:03] he was the first pope to ever get on a
[1:09:04] plane - I saw the I saw the report on
[1:09:07] him this morning from 1964 first plane
[1:09:09] delete I'm sorry first pope to leave
[1:09:11] Rome four thousand years I think it was
[1:09:14] and then the first pope to get on a
[1:09:15] plane and where'd he go he went to
[1:09:17] Jerusalem he says the Pope is named Paul
[1:09:20] the sixth Paul was the first messenger
[1:09:22] and the
[1:09:22] man goes by that name notice it is the
[1:09:25] six or the number of man this is more
[1:09:27] than a coincidence
[1:09:28] and when he went to Jerusalem the moon
[1:09:30] of the church went into total darkness
[1:09:31] this is it this is the end now look at
[1:09:35] this statement here I'm gonna just take
[1:09:36] a moment look at this this generation
[1:09:38] shall not pass until all be fulfilled
[1:09:42] now put Asterix by this because I don't
[1:09:45] I can't really explain this statement we
[1:09:47] know it's not a prophecy because he
[1:09:48] doesn't say they'll say at the Lord but
[1:09:50] this is going to be a good lesson to us
[1:09:52] to help us rightly divide the word of
[1:09:54] truth he says even so Lord Jesus come
[1:09:57] quickly
[1:09:58] so this seeing this happen brother RAM
[1:10:00] saw this happen in Jerusalem in 64 he
[1:10:03] thought my this this must be the end he
[1:10:05] thought he said this generation will not
[1:10:08] pass until the coming of the Lord
[1:10:11] because he saw this he saw what God was
[1:10:13] doing here and then he saw this happen
[1:10:15] as the Pope who was the leader of the
[1:10:17] mother harlot right
[1:10:18] the man who rides the Beast right and he
[1:10:22] saw this all coming together now I'm
[1:10:25] going to look at this here now let's go
[1:10:27] down here I've already read this I'm not
[1:10:29] sure how to interpret this statement
[1:10:30] when he says this generation shall not
[1:10:33] pass until all be fulfilled so it's been
[1:10:37] 54 years since 1964 a generation the
[1:10:41] Bible has different meanings there's all
[1:10:42] kinds of different meanings for
[1:10:43] generation in the Bible but it usually
[1:10:45] means 40 years in the Bible and this
[1:10:48] reminded me about the statement of 1977
[1:10:51] and so I'm going somewhere with this I
[1:10:53] want to I'll get to that but here's two
[1:10:57] thoughts on how a generation can be 40
[1:10:59] years and the Lord's anger was kindled
[1:11:01] against Israel and he made them wonder
[1:11:02] the wilderness 40 years until all the
[1:11:06] generation that had done evilness I the
[1:11:08] Lord was consumed so how long Lord are
[1:11:11] they going to wonder 40 years to make
[1:11:13] sure that all that generation passed
[1:11:15] away so it seems like a generation can
[1:11:19] be 40 years 40 years long was I agree
[1:11:22] with his generation said it is a people
[1:11:24] that do err in their heart and they have
[1:11:26] not known my ways so again I think
[1:11:29] everybody can see it's been well past 40
[1:11:32] years since 1964 so if we interpret it
[1:11:35] that way
[1:11:36] it would of course not be right it would
[1:11:38] just be his thought and I'm comfortable
[1:11:41] with that because we all have to say
[1:11:42] with the thought of 1977 that was just
[1:11:45] brother rands thought nobody can say it
[1:11:47] can everybody say amen to that
[1:11:48] that was just his thought so I'm just
[1:11:51] trying to look this morning especially
[1:11:55] at worth the end time and we've got to
[1:11:57] make sure that everything we believe is
[1:11:59] in line with the scripture I just want
[1:12:02] to empty because that's what we find and
[1:12:03] it just shocked me as I'm reading this
[1:12:05] where the Prophet said this generation
[1:12:06] won't pass until we see the coming of
[1:12:08] the Lord so I just want to rightly
[1:12:12] divide this now look what the prophets
[1:12:15] said now don't know don't forget in
[1:12:17] later on in the book the prophets said
[1:12:20] he predicted all seven visions of the
[1:12:22] seven missions would come to pass by
[1:12:24] 1977 now of course we know that it
[1:12:26] hasn't happened because he saw America
[1:12:29] nothing but ashes and boulders and and
[1:12:31] meteors sitting in her I'm sorry atom
[1:12:34] bombs and all kinds of holes and
[1:12:36] explosions everything was with ashes and
[1:12:38] everything so that hasn't happened now
[1:12:43] brother Branham says you know you might
[1:12:45] think it's irresponsible but I maintain
[1:12:46] this prediction after 30 years because
[1:12:48] Jesus did not say no man could not know
[1:12:51] the Year month or week in which his
[1:12:52] coming was to be completed so I repeat
[1:12:56] now look I sincerely believe and
[1:12:59] maintain as a private student of the
[1:13:01] word along with divine inspiration that
[1:13:04] 1977 ought to terminate the world
[1:13:06] systems and usher in the millennium now
[1:13:10] this doesn't stumble me I hope it
[1:13:13] doesn't stumble you because he was being
[1:13:15] completely sincere in all of his
[1:13:18] sincerity for some reason he thought the
[1:13:21] world would end by 1977 now he told us
[1:13:25] the reason behind the 1977 statement and
[1:13:28] we can see that he was trying to be a
[1:13:30] student of the word so the reason behind
[1:13:33] it was from Daniels I'm sorry from the
[1:13:35] 70th week of Daniel and 1961 so I want
[1:13:38] to revisit that so you can see the
[1:13:41] humanity of brother Branham huh me know
[1:13:43] that Jesus said I'm sorry how many know
[1:13:45] that John the Baptist said I must
[1:13:47] decrease and he must increase
[1:13:50] if that applied to the first 4runner
[1:13:53] what about the second 4runner Amen now
[1:13:57] what I mean by that is we can't lean
[1:13:58] upon any thought from brother Branham
[1:14:01] unless it's got a scriptural backing
[1:14:03] praise of the heart I'm not saying we
[1:14:06] forget brother rhythm we never do that
[1:14:07] we would never forget John the Baptist
[1:14:09] we thank God but we've got to be more
[1:14:12] sure we've got to be more in fellowship
[1:14:15] having sup with Jesus more than ever
[1:14:17] praise God because it is the spirit of
[1:14:20] Jesus that is going to change our bodies
[1:14:23] in a moment and a twinkling of an eye
[1:14:25] amen and so see we we can't just guess
[1:14:28] and well I'm just going to believe this
[1:14:30] because I heard it on a tape it's good
[1:14:32] that you heard to take but you've got it
[1:14:33] we've got to take that back to the Word
[1:14:35] of God because one of Satan's greatest
[1:14:37] tools is to use the prophet of God and
[1:14:41] try to try to bring some false doctrine
[1:14:45] that was maybe just the opinion of the
[1:14:47] Prophet or something and to make it
[1:14:49] something big right and to make it
[1:14:51] distract people from the real truth now
[1:14:54] it'll never distract the Bride of Christ
[1:14:56] it'll never distract the element but the
[1:14:59] elect never want to be guilty of saying
[1:15:01] anything outside the Word of God now
[1:15:04] here's where he says it he's closing
[1:15:06] this message and says a striking
[1:15:08] statement from the time God made the
[1:15:10] promise to Abraham don't miss this he
[1:15:12] said from the time God made the promise
[1:15:14] to Abraham Genesis 12:3 to the time of
[1:15:17] Christ being rejected in AD 33 by the
[1:15:20] Jews according to Galatians 3:16 and 17
[1:15:24] according to Ussher's chronology of the
[1:15:27] Hebrews the power of God was with the
[1:15:29] Jews exactly 19 and 54 years
[1:15:33] sbobet I'm saying from the time of
[1:15:35] Abraham until Jesus crucifixion was 1954
[1:15:39] years this is where he got his numbers
[1:15:42] from he said I got many more scriptures
[1:15:45] I'll just give you that he said now
[1:15:46] counting that time we find that we have
[1:15:48] exactly he said 17 years left and we
[1:15:51] have the same span of time given to us
[1:15:53] as God dealing with us in the power of
[1:15:55] the Holy Spirit sends a t-33 until 1977
[1:15:59] the same span of time of 1954 years
[1:16:03] deals with us the same time as he did
[1:16:06] with the juicy how about that so what
[1:16:10] was brother branham's as a student of
[1:16:12] the scripture
[1:16:12] what was he basing the 1977 prediction
[1:16:16] on he was basing it upon this number he
[1:16:18] came up from Abraham until Jesus
[1:16:22] crucifixion in a t-33 does ever
[1:16:24] understand that and he was saying if God
[1:16:27] was with the Jews for 1954 years then
[1:16:30] he'll maybe be with the Gentiles for
[1:16:32] 1954 years has ever understand that now
[1:16:35] I preached this one time when I first
[1:16:36] preached in a Lima and I showed I showed
[1:16:39] the people how brother Brandon found
[1:16:41] this and I had an older woman come up
[1:16:42] and she shook my head she said thank you
[1:16:43] so much for preaching that I always
[1:16:45] wondered my brother branham said in 1977
[1:16:47] and then she could have peace and move
[1:16:50] on past that question or mind and that's
[1:16:52] what the Holy Spirit does it dissolves
[1:16:54] all of our doubts praise God that's what
[1:16:57] he does now he even tells them to mark
[1:17:00] that down in a little your little book
[1:17:02] of Scripture here and he talks about the
[1:17:05] Jubilee year and how the Jubilee year
[1:17:07] came exactly it was a multiple of 70 so
[1:17:12] this three hundred so if you add up the
[1:17:14] Jewish years plus the Gentile years he
[1:17:16] said all that comes out to a multiple of
[1:17:18] 70 so he had layers and layers of
[1:17:21] numbers that seemed to be right and he
[1:17:23] was Church he was being sincere he
[1:17:27] sincerely believed it
[1:17:30] he said as a student of the word I still
[1:17:33] sincerely believe it's gonna be 1977
[1:17:36] what was he basing upon he was basing
[1:17:37] upon Scripture he's a patient upon years
[1:17:40] he thought God would give the same
[1:17:42] amount of time to it to the Jews as you
[1:17:45] to the Gentiles but if you if you just
[1:17:47] do some simple math anybody got their
[1:17:49] phone ready or you can look at mine here
[1:17:51] if you just do simple math here I'll do
[1:17:54] 1977 - 33 it's actually 1944 years I'm
[1:18:02] not trying to I'm not trying to one-up
[1:18:05] brother branham I'm not but he just got
[1:18:08] his numbers wrong
[1:18:09] how many bleedy was sincere and how many
[1:18:13] people Loras and Karen did they see
[1:18:15] trying to follow the Lord
[1:18:17] around night
[1:18:17] 77 they fell away now I'm not we're not
[1:18:22] trying to say oh you know he's not a man
[1:18:24] of God here was no doubt a man of God no
[1:18:26] doubt about that but you see as sincere
[1:18:30] as we can be we've got to make sure
[1:18:33] especially in this day when there is not
[1:18:35] a prophet on the scene we've got to make
[1:18:36] sure we are directed back to the Word of
[1:18:38] God that's right he brought him he goes
[1:18:42] again and says that did you get that God
[1:18:44] has dealt with us exactly the same
[1:18:45] amount of time that he dealt with the
[1:18:46] Jews from the time he gave Abraham the
[1:18:48] promise unto the rejecting the Messiah
[1:18:50] in a t-33 which was 1954 years but
[1:18:54] actually it was 1944 at least in that
[1:18:56] calculation he's ever understand what
[1:18:59] I'm what I'm saying he was doing his
[1:19:02] best now this 77 issue never stumbled me
[1:19:05] because he never said thus saith the
[1:19:07] Lord behind it because Church if you're
[1:19:09] honest with yourself you know and I know
[1:19:11] all of us had said the spirit told me
[1:19:13] this times I felt led of the Spirit and
[1:19:15] we found out later we were not led of
[1:19:17] the Spirit be honest with yourself
[1:19:19] oh I know I heard from God did you and I
[1:19:25] knew even as a young Christian I knew as
[1:19:27] long as he didn't say in the name of the
[1:19:29] Lord it was just him being human we've
[1:19:32] got to let people be human and have
[1:19:35] mercy upon them especially if they don't
[1:19:37] go speaking in the name of the Lord
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:40] it was never spoken the name of the Lord
[1:19:42] and in fact I was reading a quote this
[1:19:44] morning where brother Branham said after
[1:19:46] he got out of the trance of the seven
[1:19:47] major visions he says some thought just
[1:19:49] came to him about 1977 that what he said
[1:19:52] that 1958 by the way so see look how
[1:19:55] close that is look how close Church the
[1:19:58] supernatural is to the natural and we've
[1:20:01] got to make sure everything we believe
[1:20:03] everything that we we say swallow
[1:20:06] everything that we eat spiritually is
[1:20:08] the truth of God now we know the
[1:20:12] majority of Bible teaching from brother
[1:20:15] Branham was thus saith the Lord in full
[1:20:19] harmony with Scripture can you say amen
[1:20:21] to that
[1:20:21] the majority of what he taught was thus
[1:20:25] saith the Lord so much so that he kept
[1:20:27] saying thus saith the Lord water baptism
[1:20:29] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:31] now say the Lord Trinity doctrine is of
[1:20:33] the devil right thus saith the Lord
[1:20:36] these are the revelations of the seven
[1:20:38] seals and that's when I wrote this page
[1:20:44] that we believe page of our church plus
[1:20:47] other YouTube videos when I make a
[1:20:49] youtube video and I put something out
[1:20:50] there for the public I don't I don't put
[1:20:52] up things I know are wrong I put up
[1:20:54] things that we know we have a Bible
[1:20:56] backing for amen
[1:20:59] does everyone understand by God's grace
[1:21:02] and so you see if the prophet makes a
[1:21:06] sincere mistake we've got to know we
[1:21:09] might make sense their mistakes and
[1:21:11] we've got to be humble enough to say God
[1:21:13] if I make a mistake please correct me
[1:21:16] now let's move on by the grace of lord I
[1:21:19] hope that was okay I just wanted you to
[1:21:21] see that I thought maybe some of you had
[1:21:23] never seen that where brother Brandon
[1:21:25] was trying to add updates and that's a
[1:21:26] good thought but we know it wasn't the
[1:21:29] right thoughts it was just his own
[1:21:30] thought as a student of the word and
[1:21:33] we're at the end time and memory brings
[1:21:35] up this statement about how this
[1:21:38] generation will not pass until we see
[1:21:41] the coming of Lord it's been past 40
[1:21:43] years now it might be 70 or 70 years can
[1:21:45] be a generation 2 because God Jeremiah
[1:21:48] told Israel you'll be down in Babylon
[1:21:50] for seven years a generation so that
[1:21:54] will lead us to the next thought a
[1:21:56] little bit by God's grace but let's look
[1:21:59] at this here now after this thought
[1:22:01] let's move on and then we'll actually
[1:22:02] move back now we can see why there were
[1:22:06] two vines so one of the churches lost
[1:22:09] all the light while the bride is course
[1:22:11] shining in the light of God one true one
[1:22:14] false now we can see by Abraham had two
[1:22:16] sons one after the flesh that persecuted
[1:22:19] Isaac and one-half their promise now we
[1:22:21] can see how that out of the same parents
[1:22:23] two boys came forth as twins one knowing
[1:22:26] and loving the things of God and the
[1:22:28] other knowing much of the same truth but
[1:22:30] not of the same spirit and hence perfect
[1:22:33] persecuted the child that was elect God
[1:22:36] and not reprobate for the sake of
[1:22:39] reprobation he cannot I'm sorry he
[1:22:42] reprobated for the sake of the elect
[1:22:44] Alette cannot persecute elect he let
[1:22:47] cannot harm elect
[1:22:49] Amen this is why it's so important that
[1:22:52] we love people in the message praise God
[1:22:56] this is why it's so important we don't
[1:22:58] brand and label and make decisions and
[1:23:01] try to be judges and try to make
[1:23:03] ourselves more spiritual than other
[1:23:04] people the best thing you can do to be
[1:23:07] spiritual is humble yourself and not say
[1:23:10] much about it that's the best thing you
[1:23:12] can do now if you've got a leading of
[1:23:14] the Lord where Paul says mark those that
[1:23:16] cause division they're preaching heresy
[1:23:18] then you've got the leading of the Lord
[1:23:19] for that but see the elect will not
[1:23:23] persecute the elect
[1:23:24] now remember Paul and Barnabas had a
[1:23:27] nice dispute one time about mark can the
[1:23:30] elect
[1:23:31] maybe disagree with the elect absolutely
[1:23:33] they can definitely disagree with one
[1:23:35] another but they will not persecute the
[1:23:38] elect
[1:23:38] they will only maybe disagree for a
[1:23:41] season then remember mark became
[1:23:43] beneficial to st. Paul at the end of his
[1:23:45] ministry but there was something holding
[1:23:48] it off at the beginning that's what we
[1:23:50] find some people we think they're ready
[1:23:52] to serve God maybe the ministry but
[1:23:53] they're not quite ready God will make
[1:23:56] them ready in their time and season how
[1:23:58] many let me know that by God's grace
[1:23:59] mark Paul looked at his life and said
[1:24:01] Mark's not ready he's not quite ready
[1:24:03] for the ministry he's got to go through
[1:24:05] different types of trials and tests he's
[1:24:07] got to be trained more he's not ready
[1:24:08] Barnabas said he's ready
[1:24:09] Paul said he's not ready but pretty soon
[1:24:11] he gets ready and then God can use that
[1:24:14] man of God Haven hallelujah I like it it
[1:24:19] is the reprobates that persecute and
[1:24:21] destroy the elect think about that who's
[1:24:24] trying to destroy your life or your your
[1:24:26] faith lately that's the that's the false
[1:24:29] mind they're trying to destroy and say
[1:24:31] you need to leave that message you need
[1:24:33] to leave the word and go to just some
[1:24:34] other church or something like that
[1:24:35] that's the false vine they're
[1:24:37] persecuting the truth about water
[1:24:39] baptism or the Godhead or the seventh
[1:24:41] years of the church ages when they
[1:24:43] persecute the truth they persecute you
[1:24:45] and I he said Oh
[1:24:50] religious and they're smart they're of
[1:24:53] the cane line the serpent seed they
[1:24:56] build their babbles they build their
[1:24:57] cities they build their empires and all
[1:24:59] the while calling on God they hate the
[1:25:03] true seed and they will do all they can
[1:25:05] even the name of Lord to destroy God's
[1:25:07] elect ones but they are needed
[1:25:10] what is the chaff to the wheat if
[1:25:12] there's no chaff there's no wheat but at
[1:25:16] the end what happens to the chaff it is
[1:25:18] burned with fire unquenchable and the
[1:25:20] wheat here where is it it is gathered in
[1:25:22] his garner it is where he is see God has
[1:25:25] a purpose even for the Serpent's seed
[1:25:28] they've got to be the chaff that's
[1:25:30] burned but God has use for the wheat
[1:25:33] God's gonna use the wheat praise God
[1:25:36] he's gonna bring it to his table thank
[1:25:39] the Lord
[1:25:40] now here's what I want to get to here
[1:25:42] this is where I'm going to come back to
[1:25:43] this thought o elect of God beware so
[1:25:49] right after he says this about this
[1:25:52] generation won't pass and he gives us
[1:25:53] the two seeds how one persecutes the
[1:25:55] other he said beware study closely be
[1:26:00] careful now you know church in your
[1:26:04] heart are you studying the message
[1:26:05] closely or do you only hear it on Sunday
[1:26:08] and Wednesday are we studying closely
[1:26:12] we've got to study this thing closely if
[1:26:15] a prophet could miss on 77 a prophet God
[1:26:19] let him make the mistake
[1:26:20] how many understand that God let it make
[1:26:22] a mistake if a prophet could miss and
[1:26:25] church if you go back and listen to the
[1:26:26] Daniel 70 weeks everybody's really
[1:26:28] excited after the end of that service he
[1:26:30] talks about 1977 why because people want
[1:26:33] to be ready for the coming of the Lord
[1:26:34] don't you want to be ready for the
[1:26:36] coming of the Lord and so it just it
[1:26:39] just makes you naturally excited OMA may
[1:26:41] be only 17 or 16 more years now so
[1:26:44] people are saying today the latest in
[1:26:46] church age is 112 years right so far
[1:26:49] Ephesus was 117 so people say oh maybe
[1:26:52] just five more years but be careful it
[1:26:54] might be longer than that we cannot put
[1:26:57] our hopes on our own thoughts we can
[1:26:59] only put our hope on the grace of Christ
[1:27:03] through the word I know this is from
[1:27:05] here but it's in here and we must
[1:27:07] revisit these things because if not
[1:27:09] we'll start drifting if we don't study
[1:27:11] close and if we don't play close
[1:27:13] attention we'll just start accepting
[1:27:14] anything anybody says we've got the
[1:27:18] study closely and be careful now how
[1:27:23] many know you how many know I'm gonna do
[1:27:25] this in your home you work out your
[1:27:26] salvation with fear and trembling you're
[1:27:28] trembling in your prayer closet at home
[1:27:30] how many do that how many do it at
[1:27:32] church this is the condition we've got
[1:27:36] to be in he says rely upon God and be
[1:27:40] strong in his might your adversary the
[1:27:42] devil is even now going about like a
[1:27:44] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[1:27:47] watch unto prayer and be steadfast so I
[1:27:50] think the thing we find many time is
[1:27:52] that Jesus said watch and pray the thing
[1:27:54] we find is that most people watch but
[1:27:56] aren't praying more they watch the news
[1:27:59] they watch our Billy Graham and we're
[1:28:02] you know we're grateful we can know
[1:28:03] those things you know thank God for a
[1:28:05] serving of Lord but see we're watching
[1:28:07] those things but then are we taking
[1:28:09] those things and praying about it
[1:28:11] if not we'll just so we'll just keep
[1:28:14] watching but we've got to watch and then
[1:28:17] pray about that this is the end time
[1:28:23] both a true and false vine are coming
[1:28:26] into maturity but before the wheat
[1:28:28] matures those ripened tears must be
[1:28:30] bound for the burning see they're all
[1:28:34] joining the World Council of Churches
[1:28:35] that is the binding soon the guarding of
[1:28:39] the wheat will come but right now the
[1:28:40] two spirits aren't working two vines
[1:28:42] come out from among the tears start to
[1:28:44] overcome that you may be considered
[1:28:47] praiseworthy for your Lord and fit to
[1:28:50] reign and rule with him how do you well
[1:28:53] thank God we've come out of
[1:28:54] denominations but we've got to get rid
[1:28:56] of our coldness we got to be on fire we
[1:28:59] have to be fervent for Christ we have to
[1:29:01] be zealous for Christ how many want to
[1:29:03] be zealous for Christ you've got you're
[1:29:05] gonna be excited about something if
[1:29:07] you're not excited about cronic Christ
[1:29:08] and you're excited about your new car
[1:29:10] we're gonna be excited about the the
[1:29:11] next update on on whatever phone you
[1:29:14] want you know you're gonna find
[1:29:15] something to be
[1:29:16] about but we've got to make sure our
[1:29:18] main excitement our main zeal our main
[1:29:20] burden is for the work of the Lord
[1:29:23] study closely be careful don't swallow
[1:29:27] everything you hear go back and study it
[1:29:30] now here's why I saw this on Facebook
[1:29:33] and I'm gonna post this up here because
[1:29:34] whether this and here just give me a
[1:29:37] moment here let me let me do something
[1:29:38] real quick there we go
[1:29:44] I saw this on Facebook immediately made
[1:29:49] me think of what we saw with 1977
[1:29:51] now this dear person that looks got a
[1:29:54] lot of likes on it a lot of love on it
[1:29:56] this sweet sweet dear person as a
[1:29:59] minister he's doing the same thing
[1:30:02] brother Branham was doing which is okay
[1:30:03] it's alright to do that it's not going
[1:30:05] to stumble the elect but we've got to
[1:30:07] make sure we don't put more emphasis on
[1:30:10] our presuming or our thoughts we got to
[1:30:12] make sure we put our emphasis on the
[1:30:14] word of God do you understand this
[1:30:18] person in other words is setting a date
[1:30:19] for the rapture for this year and
[1:30:21] they're not I'm not even sure if they're
[1:30:22] aware of it cuz look what they're saying
[1:30:24] this year is Israel's Jubilee you're at
[1:30:27] 70 years since 1948 which I'll get my
[1:30:30] calculator out again and I'll make sure
[1:30:32] that's right because we can see how easy
[1:30:35] how easy it is for a man of God even to
[1:30:37] make a mistake
[1:30:37] so it's 2018 - 70
[1:30:42] that's right 1948 so that can be a
[1:30:46] generation because Jeremiah said that
[1:30:47] generation will we'll be in Babylon 70
[1:30:50] years so this person without even and
[1:30:52] they have a lot of influence this person
[1:30:54] has thousands of friends a preacher and
[1:30:57] now look now see they're bringing this
[1:30:59] week and Billy Graham left the scene see
[1:31:04] how there can be a lot of oh my watching
[1:31:07] watching
[1:31:07] now look now this next segment the
[1:31:11] 144,000 44,000 Jews will soon receive
[1:31:14] Jesus that means the rapture is going to
[1:31:16] take place this year because it's the
[1:31:20] 70th year in the seventh year is a year
[1:31:22] giru jubilee and the only way that Jews
[1:31:24] can have a jubilee is if they receive
[1:31:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:31:27] the seal of God their forehead
[1:31:29] the only way the Jews can receive that
[1:31:31] is if the Gentiles are gone at the
[1:31:33] marriage supper of the lamb to see how
[1:31:35] people may swallow this and and see
[1:31:38] they're watching this and I like it I
[1:31:39] didn't even like it I didn't like it or
[1:31:41] love it because I don't want to make
[1:31:42] predictions I don't want to get people's
[1:31:45] false hopes up you see how you see how
[1:31:48] careful we got to be this is the same
[1:31:50] thing that was with 1977 is it good to
[1:31:54] watch yes but you have to accompany that
[1:31:57] with prayer now if this person's right
[1:32:00] which I hope they are would that be
[1:32:02] glorious if the rapture came this year
[1:32:03] we'd be an eternity nothing to worry
[1:32:05] about you know Christ was we walking
[1:32:08] with Christ maybe with Jesus we'd all be
[1:32:10] with King Jesus amen Mahadevi glorious
[1:32:14] but if not well then here comes another
[1:32:17] well somebody guess and it wasn't right
[1:32:20] somebody's guessing again somebody's
[1:32:22] presuming again now I believe what
[1:32:24] brother Ram said I believe to the Holy
[1:32:27] Spirit may say this is the year of the
[1:32:30] coming of the Lord and that could be
[1:32:31] accurate maybe it would be down in
[1:32:33] Louisiana at the Louisiana camp maybe be
[1:32:36] over in Africa at a convention maybe the
[1:32:39] Holy Spirit would say thus saith the
[1:32:40] Lord the rapture is going to take place
[1:32:41] this year if that's the case that could
[1:32:43] be scripturally accurate because jesus
[1:32:45] said only no man knows the day or the
[1:32:47] hour so that's why even with 1977 people
[1:32:53] could say well it's possible because it
[1:32:54] is possible that would not be adding or
[1:32:57] taking away from the word but the way to
[1:32:59] know is pray about it that's the way to
[1:33:03] know we must pray about so this must be
[1:33:07] prayed about and I hope the brother
[1:33:09] prayed about it before he posted it if
[1:33:11] not it's just gonna be another well like
[1:33:13] the like the remember the 2015 the blood
[1:33:15] moons remember that 2015 the blood moons
[1:33:17] America the Pope was coming and he
[1:33:20] spoken at the Senate right in the
[1:33:23] Congress and I was shaken up by that I
[1:33:25] remember that I was shaken up by that I
[1:33:28] thought my maybe this is the coming of
[1:33:30] the Lord and so see I just want every
[1:33:37] to see this that you've got to be ready
[1:33:38] at any time it shouldn't take something
[1:33:42] like this to make us be ready because
[1:33:44] Jesus is already something with us right
[1:33:46] now
[1:33:46] praise God I'm having supper with him on
[1:33:49] a daily basis amen I feel his presence
[1:33:52] ah he's teaching me his word I'm talking
[1:33:55] to him every day he's in the house amen
[1:33:58] hallelujah and I'm not being critical
[1:34:01] Church I'm not being critical at all I'm
[1:34:03] just saying this is the same thing if
[1:34:05] this comes the two paths and 2019 comes
[1:34:09] well what did that mean then I don't
[1:34:11] know what it mean but it just means that
[1:34:13] we shouldn't guess anymore
[1:34:14] we shouldn't be guessing we should make
[1:34:18] ourselves ready for the coming of the
[1:34:19] Lord now I want to read this next few
[1:34:25] things here I'm gonna really try to
[1:34:29] watch my time I've been really really
[1:34:30] going over lately support me in the days
[1:34:33] of the seventh messenger and the days of
[1:34:35] laodicean age its messenger will reveal
[1:34:38] the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul
[1:34:40] he will speak out and those who will
[1:34:43] receive that prophet and his own name
[1:34:44] who received the benefit I'm sorry the
[1:34:47] yeah beneficent effect of that prophets
[1:34:51] ministry and they that hear him will be
[1:34:53] blessed and become part of that bride of
[1:34:55] the last day who were mentioned in
[1:34:58] revelation 22:17 the spear and the bride
[1:35:01] say come
[1:35:02] Oh church how many can rejoice in the
[1:35:06] benefits you've received because of the
[1:35:08] message oh my I rejoice every day I was
[1:35:11] even walking my house yesterday say my
[1:35:13] what a blessing the message has been on
[1:35:15] my life it's delivered me from all my
[1:35:19] addictions it's giving me hope for the
[1:35:21] future it's given me wisdom for the
[1:35:24] future it showed me the power of Christ
[1:35:27] it showed me that Jesus Christ is the
[1:35:30] same yesterday today and forever I
[1:35:32] didn't have that my other churches but
[1:35:34] today like the Prophet said the whole
[1:35:36] reason he wrote this book and gave us
[1:35:38] ministry was that he would restore a
[1:35:40] true relationship between God and man
[1:35:43] amen that's why he wrote the book that's
[1:35:47] why he labored on the field for all
[1:35:49] those years
[1:35:50] that
[1:35:50] and I could truly have sup with the Lord
[1:35:52] Jesus Christ what a blessing my here's
[1:35:57] why when I get to this the corn of wheat
[1:35:59] the bride wheat that fell into the
[1:36:02] ground at Nicaea has come back to
[1:36:04] original word again
[1:36:05] praise God forever yes listen to the
[1:36:08] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:36:12] in this last age what he says from God
[1:36:16] the bride will say did you catch those
[1:36:18] words let's can we say this can we say
[1:36:21] from God ready from God what he says
[1:36:23] from God the bride will say the spirit
[1:36:29] and the prophet and the bride will be
[1:36:31] saying the same thing and what they say
[1:36:34] will have already been said in the Word
[1:36:38] of God we're getting down to the last
[1:36:41] age we're in the last age we're getting
[1:36:43] down to the final years whether it's
[1:36:44] five fifty hundred one hundred fifty we
[1:36:48] don't know but we are down to the end of
[1:36:50] the end and we've got to say what the
[1:36:53] Spirit is saying we've got to say what's
[1:36:55] already in the Word of God amen he says
[1:37:00] they are saying it now come out from
[1:37:02] among her now and be separate the cry
[1:37:05] has gone out the cry is going out how
[1:37:09] long will the voice cry we do not know
[1:37:11] but one thing we do know it won't be
[1:37:14] long for this is the last age praise the
[1:37:18] Lord
[1:37:19] now if I can hear by the grace of Lord
[1:37:23] let me go back to that we believe page I
[1:37:25] want to show you that we believe page on
[1:37:27] our website I've had different people
[1:37:29] tell me that because of that page
[1:37:31] they've been able to really understand
[1:37:34] the word of the Lord and express their
[1:37:36] their faith so here's our web page we
[1:37:41] believe is right here and I've sent
[1:37:43] people that have left the message with
[1:37:44] big names I've sent them to this website
[1:37:47] and they never respond to me back
[1:37:49] because everything we believe is from
[1:37:51] the scripture and I'll just make it
[1:37:52] really big like that our church has one
[1:37:56] faith how many believe we have the one
[1:37:57] faith God
[1:38:00] one God and he's revealed in one person
[1:38:03] in three ways one person revealed in
[1:38:05] three ways the Bible is infallible grace
[1:38:09] is unmerited to all those who receive it
[1:38:12] but most people misinterpret grace and
[1:38:16] the Bible said people can reject the
[1:38:19] grace of God they can fail the grace of
[1:38:21] God legalism
[1:38:23] allows one to fall from grace so we must
[1:38:27] understand grace the right way salvation
[1:38:29] by grace through faith the way to
[1:38:32] repentance is by faith faith is God's
[1:38:36] gift to you and I amen and God uses
[1:38:39] three works of grace to do this
[1:38:41] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:38:43] of the Holy Ghost we have three divine
[1:38:47] ordinances that we keep they're all
[1:38:48] scriptural water baptism is only done in
[1:38:52] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:38:54] gifts and power of the Holy Ghost are
[1:38:56] still here today amen
[1:38:59] all nine for all men and women but we
[1:39:05] know here the rain falls on the just and
[1:39:06] the unjust operation of miracles does
[1:39:10] not prove anyone is saved now present
[1:39:13] truth Peter said we must be established
[1:39:15] in the present truth the present truth
[1:39:17] for our day is the message of the hour
[1:39:19] it's the legacy in church age it's the
[1:39:21] restoration that jesus promised in acts
[1:39:24] 3:21 in matthew 17 11 and we believe
[1:39:27] there's one angel messenger this day his
[1:39:30] name was william branham we also believe
[1:39:34] the mysteries of god are finished praise
[1:39:37] the Lord
[1:39:37] that's proven by the Word of God there's
[1:39:40] 12 New Testament mysteries we know that
[1:39:42] there's seven kingdom mysteries that
[1:39:45] Jesus talked about we know modesty and
[1:39:49] outward clothing is the will of God is
[1:39:52] it's proven completely through the
[1:39:54] Scriptures we know the fivefold ministry
[1:39:57] will bring the people to perfection for
[1:40:00] the rapture that's right
[1:40:02] we believe marriage and divorce is
[1:40:04] between one man and one woman till death
[1:40:07] that's right we believe
[1:40:12] Hollywood in the internet are great
[1:40:13] tools of Satan for the lust of the eyes
[1:40:16] we must avoid them at all costs and we
[1:40:20] know predestination is God's plan for
[1:40:22] our life every event in our life every
[1:40:24] footsteps of the righteous have already
[1:40:26] been ordered by the Lord amen can the
[1:40:29] church say Amen
[1:40:30] what on there is our thought or our
[1:40:33] injection nothing we haven't ejecting
[1:40:37] into the Bible but we've only accepted
[1:40:40] exactly what the Bible says so again the
[1:40:45] spirit the prophet and the bride will
[1:40:48] all be saying the same thing how many
[1:40:50] want to say that amen and they what they
[1:40:53] will say have already been said in the
[1:40:55] word now I want to close with this I'm
[1:40:58] gonna I don't have time to get it on the
[1:40:59] slide so I'm gonna read it out of the
[1:41:00] book here the overcomers throne let's
[1:41:03] finish with this by the grace of God I
[1:41:05] knew I wouldn't have time to get it on
[1:41:06] there so pardon me revelation 3:21 let's
[1:41:14] read that it says
[1:41:15] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:41:17] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:41:20] overcame and I'm set down with my father
[1:41:23] in his throne I'm gonna read these
[1:41:27] thoughts right out of here he says now
[1:41:30] what are we to overcome that is the
[1:41:33] normal question to ask here but that is
[1:41:35] not the actual thought of this verse for
[1:41:37] is not so much what we're over to come
[1:41:39] but how we're over to come this is
[1:41:43] logical for what does it matter
[1:41:45] I'm sorry for it matters not much what
[1:41:49] we are overcome as long as we know how
[1:41:51] we can't overcome let me say like this
[1:41:55] church it doesn't matter what you're
[1:41:57] battling right now I just say it like
[1:42:00] that it really doesn't matter what I
[1:42:03] struggle with it really doesn't matter
[1:42:06] what your struggle with well I just wish
[1:42:08] somebody would come and preach on that
[1:42:09] it really doesn't matter now I hope so
[1:42:12] for that to you understand that if God's
[1:42:14] working in time or seasons but it really
[1:42:16] doesn't matter what your week with
[1:42:18] compared to what I'm week with or what
[1:42:20] your week but it doesn't really matter
[1:42:22] what we struggle with as long as we know
[1:42:24] how to over
[1:42:25] that struggle hey man it doesn't really
[1:42:27] matter yes I want God to minister to
[1:42:31] every need of every person and family we
[1:42:33] we want that but we can't sit back in a
[1:42:36] spiritual lazy state and sit there and
[1:42:38] say well they never preach on it's just
[1:42:40] going to remain there in my life we
[1:42:42] should have enough maturity to take our
[1:42:44] needs before the Lord and say God it
[1:42:47] doesn't matter what need I have it
[1:42:50] doesn't matter what I'm struggling I'm
[1:42:52] sorry it doesn't matter what I struggle
[1:42:54] with because I know you can meet that
[1:42:56] need if I'll just accept your word amen
[1:42:59] sometimes we build up our our enemies so
[1:43:02] big in our mine I just wanna however
[1:43:06] overcome by this or brother I've had
[1:43:08] people tell me this brother cast these
[1:43:09] demons off me and like well first of all
[1:43:13] you've got to want those demons off you
[1:43:15] it isn't even going to work if you don't
[1:43:20] win and you should have so much zeal
[1:43:22] that God could help you to repent and
[1:43:24] then it will leave you praise God
[1:43:26] because the Bible said draw nigh unto
[1:43:27] God he'll draw nigh unto you amen does
[1:43:31] he sometimes we make our enemies so
[1:43:33] greater I could never overcome this or
[1:43:35] maybe one day God will do this for me
[1:43:37] but the point is it doesn't really
[1:43:39] matter who our enemy is because who can
[1:43:41] stand before the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:43:45] nobody can stand before him and in his
[1:43:49] presence is fullness of joy that's where
[1:43:52] we've got to get to it is Presidents
[1:43:54] amen and when we get in his presence and
[1:43:57] when we look in his full in his
[1:43:59] wonderful face we'll turn our eyes from
[1:44:02] our truck struggles our trials this is
[1:44:05] what the overcomer focuses on in this
[1:44:07] hour it's not so much I'm struggling
[1:44:10] with this or with that it's instead of
[1:44:13] looking at that we've got to look at the
[1:44:15] Word of God and I know now we know it
[1:44:19] now more than ever before it's easier at
[1:44:20] night time just to take our phone and
[1:44:22] turn on YouTube or turn on something
[1:44:24] else but if we do that too much you and
[1:44:28] I stop speaking the word and the only
[1:44:31] way to overcome is to speak the word I'm
[1:44:34] gonna prove that to you brother Branham
[1:44:35] says that Jesus the only way he could
[1:44:38] overcome
[1:44:39] seyton with the three temptation is my
[1:44:41] speak in the word he didn't put on
[1:44:44] YouTube right he didn't go to YouTube he
[1:44:47] didn't looked he to look to anything any
[1:44:49] other source so if I can just put on the
[1:44:51] tape or but although that can help don't
[1:44:54] get me wrong that can help it may raise
[1:44:55] your faith to speak the word but what
[1:44:58] I'm saying is that the way to overcome
[1:45:00] is to have the Word of God near to you
[1:45:04] now you even in your mouth that's how we
[1:45:07] overcome and that's how the latest Seon
[1:45:10] bride member will overcome say in this
[1:45:13] hour by speaking the Word of God it
[1:45:16] doesn't matter what you're battling it
[1:45:20] doesn't matter at all
[1:45:23] it doesn't matter the the enemy what
[1:45:26] matters is God's Word what matters is
[1:45:29] the power of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:45:32] matters amen and believing in that power
[1:45:36] and staying behind that word it's
[1:45:40] exactly right I just have to emphasize
[1:45:42] that because that's what the Prophet
[1:45:44] said it doesn't matter what we have to
[1:45:46] overcome what matters is that we have
[1:45:48] the power to overcome that the Word of
[1:45:51] God and brother man then goes into the
[1:45:55] scripture about Jesus's temptation and I
[1:45:58] know Church we've heard of the thousand
[1:45:59] times but if we still got if we still
[1:46:02] have Satan by our side we need to hear
[1:46:03] it again are you with me if you've still
[1:46:07] got a devil on your shoulder trying to
[1:46:09] tempt you to the cares of the world the
[1:46:11] pride of life the lust of the eyes then
[1:46:13] you and I need to hear it again
[1:46:14] are you with me if you feel like Satan's
[1:46:18] right there trying to talk you into
[1:46:19] doing some or then you just like Jesus
[1:46:21] and you've got to talk back to him the
[1:46:24] only way you're overcome the only way
[1:46:27] you'll sit on the throne near Christ is
[1:46:29] to take Christ's word and speak that
[1:46:32] word it's the only way Jesus overcame
[1:46:38] the personal temptations of Satan by the
[1:46:41] word and by the word only when he was
[1:46:46] face to face was Satan all three times
[1:46:49] and Satan said it's written Jesus said
[1:46:51] back it is
[1:46:53] he had to do what the word said he had
[1:46:56] to take that word and speak the word to
[1:46:59] the devil
[1:46:59] amen well the RAM said Eve fell to the
[1:47:05] personal temptation of Satan by failing
[1:47:07] to use the word she didn't use the word
[1:47:11] she didn't say well my husband told me
[1:47:12] this or God told my husband this she
[1:47:16] didn't use the word she just said oh
[1:47:18] that sounds pretty good she just took
[1:47:21] the word like that and that's what I'm
[1:47:23] saying with any now these these 1977
[1:47:25] idea and this generation won't pass I'm
[1:47:28] not saying that's the devil but he would
[1:47:29] just it was just his own thought it
[1:47:31] wasn't a prophecy but I'm just saying in
[1:47:34] every situation we've got to take the
[1:47:37] Word of God and use the Word of God
[1:47:41] that's the only way we overcome personal
[1:47:43] temptations is by the Word of God only
[1:47:46] Eve did not use the word we must use the
[1:47:50] word and he says and right now let me
[1:47:53] say that is the only way to be an
[1:47:56] overcomer
[1:47:57] also it is the only way that you can
[1:48:01] know you are overcoming because the word
[1:48:05] can't fail Church I hope that's your
[1:48:08] desire I hope you desire you want to
[1:48:11] know you're an overcomer I don't want to
[1:48:13] walk through this life and pretend I
[1:48:15] hope I overcome and Laodicea
[1:48:16] I hope I'm an overcomer I hope one day
[1:48:19] I'll sit by Christ I don't want to hope
[1:48:21] that I want to know that my brother had
[1:48:24] said the only way to know is to quote
[1:48:26] the word and actually overcome your
[1:48:29] current struggle right now amen
[1:48:32] that's the only way how do I know my
[1:48:36] overcomer because I'm overcoming Satan
[1:48:39] right now with the word just like Christ
[1:48:41] did amen because Christ is in me I'm
[1:48:44] having sup with him
[1:48:45] and he's telling me what sits out of
[1:48:47] that devil amen hallelujah because I'm
[1:48:50] suffering with him it doesn't matter
[1:48:52] what's out it doesn't matter my enemy
[1:48:54] because I've got the victor I've got the
[1:48:56] mighty conquer in my soul amen the only
[1:49:02] way you know you'll sit with him on the
[1:49:04] throne is by overcoming right now
[1:49:07] I'm going to just keep saying that again
[1:49:11] all of you could pride on a piece of
[1:49:13] paper say both Jessie I'm strong with
[1:49:14] this can you preach on that that might
[1:49:16] be helpful but at some point even I can
[1:49:19] write that too but at some point I'm the
[1:49:21] one who's got I've got to take what the
[1:49:22] word says instead of what reasoning says
[1:49:25] and I've got to speak that word and I've
[1:49:26] got to obey that word I've got a verb
[1:49:29] and so you have to apply that word and
[1:49:31] obey it apply that word and obey it's
[1:49:36] easiest to see like with a sickness give
[1:49:38] me five more meds like if if you're sick
[1:49:42] one of the easiest ways to see it is
[1:49:44] just to deny the the the symptoms just
[1:49:48] deny them and keep quoting the word just
[1:49:51] quote the word quote the word quote the
[1:49:53] word that's an easy one for us to see
[1:49:55] because you have to look past the
[1:49:57] symptoms and you have to look to what
[1:49:58] the word says and that takes maturity
[1:50:01] right Church that takes maturity that's
[1:50:05] the only way to know we've got we have
[1:50:07] to constantly apply the word of God in
[1:50:12] his own personal life contending with
[1:50:15] himself
[1:50:16] Jesus had to wrestle with himself he
[1:50:18] overcame by obedience to the Word of God
[1:50:22] the Bible said that he learned obedience
[1:50:25] by the things which he suffered and he
[1:50:28] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:50:29] unto all them that obey Him what was he
[1:50:32] obedient to the Word of God
[1:50:35] remember the brother Branham said no one
[1:50:37] is stronger in their Christian walk then
[1:50:41] they're then they're pure and her
[1:50:43] adherence to the word of God you and I
[1:50:46] will never be any stronger than how much
[1:50:49] we adhere to obeying the word of God
[1:50:53] ever understand the only
[1:50:56] we can be strong is just keeping that
[1:50:58] word not giving into our flesh not
[1:51:00] saying well I'll just enjoy it tonight
[1:51:01] or I'll just enjoy for the week and then
[1:51:03] I'll go back you know the week and I'll
[1:51:05] just go back to that the only way to
[1:51:07] overcome is to deny that temptation and
[1:51:10] hang on to the Word of God we must
[1:51:13] adhere to the Word of God Jesus Christ
[1:51:16] overcame Satan himself now most of us
[1:51:20] it's not really Satan himself coming to
[1:51:21] us it's just a demon power right Satan
[1:51:25] doesn't go to every individual it's his
[1:51:27] demons many times that go to individuals
[1:51:28] and he overcomes Satan himself
[1:51:32] twisting the word I'm trying to get him
[1:51:35] to do some try to make himself a miracle
[1:51:37] or try to do something special like that
[1:51:39] he just kept quoting the Word of God and
[1:51:41] he overcame was simply quoting the Word
[1:51:43] of God don't you want to quote the Word
[1:51:44] of God hey man we must be obedient to
[1:51:49] the word quote the Word of God
[1:51:51] constantly apply the Word of God to our
[1:51:54] enemy that we're facing today the
[1:52:00] Prophet said no there will not be one
[1:52:02] person who will sit on the throne with
[1:52:05] the Lord Jesus Christ unless he or she
[1:52:08] has been living that word we've got to
[1:52:14] live that word that's why I'm feeling
[1:52:15] led to go to proverbs because there's so
[1:52:17] much wisdom in there and I've been
[1:52:20] reading that and the first chapter has
[1:52:23] the baptism Holy Ghost in the first
[1:52:24] chapter I don't know if you read
[1:52:25] proverbs lately I'm really excited to
[1:52:28] preach it it's got the baptism Holy
[1:52:31] Ghost in Chapter 1 and it ends the book
[1:52:33] of Proverbs ends with this proverbs 31
[1:52:36] woman who's she's applied every word of
[1:52:40] God to every area of her life she has
[1:52:44] every inch of her house in order
[1:52:47] she's got all our children prepared and
[1:52:50] everyone in her house is prepared for
[1:52:52] anything that Satan might bring against
[1:52:53] them hey man and we think oh I'm just a
[1:52:57] woman I'm just this or that but the very
[1:53:00] pinnacle of God's wisdom is a woman who
[1:53:03] applies the Word of God to every area of
[1:53:06] her life amen
[1:53:07] I should have preached on wisdom this
[1:53:08] more
[1:53:09] that's kind of my burden but I got to
[1:53:12] finish this Laodicean Church age I got
[1:53:13] to finish this I mean I've been 3 years
[1:53:16] on this I got to finish this
[1:53:18] I love the Lord Jesus only those that
[1:53:22] live the word will sit by him on the
[1:53:25] throne and that's a woman who lived the
[1:53:27] word because there was every era even
[1:53:30] the middle night she was ready for all
[1:53:32] the battles that might come in the
[1:53:33] middle night she was prepared for the
[1:53:35] coming she's prepared for the coming of
[1:53:37] Lord she was prepared for any enemy that
[1:53:39] would come against her everything was in
[1:53:42] order
[1:53:43] she was a woman who walked in the wisdom
[1:53:45] of God and never were there going to be
[1:53:47] a wise woman or we're gonna be a foolish
[1:53:49] woman
[1:53:50] the foolish doesn't prepare the bush
[1:53:53] doesn't have everything in order the
[1:53:56] wise virgin has everything in order
[1:53:59] oh I want to sit on that throne don't
[1:54:04] you church not to be somebody but just
[1:54:07] to be faithful to what my Lord said
[1:54:09] that's all not to be a king or make
[1:54:13] myself a priests or not to make myself
[1:54:15] anything but just to do what's right
[1:54:17] just to show that he and I we did have
[1:54:21] sub we did have fellowship it wasn't
[1:54:24] just fellowship with a church
[1:54:26] organization or a religious experience
[1:54:28] but it was fellowship with the God of
[1:54:30] the universe
[1:54:32] let's stay on our feet here
[1:54:35] he says Eve fell because she left the
[1:54:38] word and the ephesian church age fell by
[1:54:41] turning slightly away from the Word of
[1:54:43] God this later seen age ends in a
[1:54:48] complete blackout of the word so see
[1:54:51] Ephesus start out just a little bit
[1:54:53] turning away from the word a little bit
[1:54:54] a little bit a little bit we know and by
[1:54:56] the end the church systems have totally
[1:54:57] left the Word of God there's no more
[1:55:00] light Jesus is on the outside they can't
[1:55:04] overcome they can't overcome the things
[1:55:08] of the world in this day delay our scene
[1:55:13] age ends in a black of the word thereby
[1:55:15] causing a departure from of the Lord
[1:55:17] from the midst he stands outside calling
[1:55:20] to his own who follow him by how do you
[1:55:23] follow him by obedience to the word
[1:55:26] after a short and powerful demonstration
[1:55:29] of the Spirit this little hunted and
[1:55:31] persecuted group will go to be with
[1:55:33] Jesus I think I'll stop right there do
[1:55:37] you love the Lord today oh ma that's
[1:55:39] beautiful constantly applying the world
