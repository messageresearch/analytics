[32:43] sorry versity by God's grace I'd like to
[32:45] go back to the vision series here
[32:47] tonight is it a church age book written

[33:31] may finish the chapter tonight we'll see
[33:33] how it goes by God's grace but just
[33:35] working our way slowly through these
[33:37] epistles visions 3 verse 9 the Bible
[33:49] says in verse 9 and to make all men see
[33:51] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[33:52] which from the beginning of the world
[33:54] hath been hid in God who created all
[33:57] things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[34:00] that now unto the principalities and
[34:03] powers in heavenly places might be known
[34:05] by the church the manifold wisdom of God
[34:10] according to the eternal purpose which
[34:12] he purposed in Christ Jesus
[34:15] Lord let's read verse 12 together ready
[34:18] one two three in whom we have boldness
[34:20] and access with confidence by the faith
[34:23] of him and we'll stop there like I said
[34:26] perhaps we'll get further but we may not
[34:28] if you have a need on your heart just
[34:30] make it unto God as we bow our heads

[35:55] god bless you sir
[35:56] [Music]
[36:05] okay so maokai you can switch over or
[36:07] Lydia got I got quite a few quotes I've
[36:11] imagined in scriptures want to go
[36:13] through these by the grace of the Lord
[36:16] so let's start with this thank you
[36:18] part 10 here and we our text wasn't all
[36:24] the way to 21 so I'm sorry I did think
[36:26] we believe we stopped at verse 12 but I
[36:28] was considering reading all the way to
[36:29] 21 but we'll just stop at 12 there I
[36:32] want to remind us why we're going
[36:34] through why I felt led if last year I
[36:37] started going through the book of
[36:38] Galatians and I want to just remind us
[36:41] of why where I feel led to go through
[36:44] these because the Prophet said we must
[36:47] preach what Paul preached and remember
[36:50] the story I read it a few weeks ago
[36:51] about brother I'm going around the
[36:52] curtain of time and he said does every
[36:54] leader out to be judged like this he
[36:55] said yes I said what about Paul he said
[36:58] I'll have to be judged by him with his
[36:59] so well
[37:00] his group goes in so a mine because I
[37:03] preach exactly the same word that's it
[37:06] I said where he baptized in Jesus name I
[37:08] did too I preached you know what other
[37:10] quotes he said the Holy Ghost and and no
[37:13] women preachers and long hair on women
[37:15] short hair all men we know there's
[37:16] different quotes like that and I like
[37:18] this and the millions screamed out all
[37:20] at once it said we're resting on that so
[37:23] church you and I are resting upon what
[37:25] Paul preached and so that's part of the
[37:27] reason why I felt led you know to start
[37:30] that series and I actually started that
[37:31] after been Narada to come and preach
[37:33] because he talked about how churches
[37:35] battle spirits and every Church battle
[37:38] is a different spirit you know and I
[37:42] briefly mentioned it you know when I
[37:43] when I think our church battles over the
[37:45] years you know and so I just you know I
[37:49] just want to bring out some of these I
[37:50] didn't have time to go through the
[37:51] scriptures but I've preached on these
[37:52] like the church at Galatia they battled
[37:54] legalism because they were trying to
[37:56] bring circumcision back into the New
[37:59] Testament
[38:00] so Paul Paul had to rebuke them for
[38:03] bringing legalism and in fact we
[38:04] listened to it on the way here I just
[38:05] played it on the on my phone and Paul
[38:08] said if you began in the Holy Ghost how
[38:11] can you be perfected by going back to
[38:12] the law you can't if you start in the
[38:15] Holy Ghost you got to keep going with
[38:16] the Holy Ghost again you don't
[38:18] go back to the law and remember legalism
[38:21] just means excessive adherence you know
[38:25] so it's too much so like in the case of
[38:27] circumcision that's no longer required
[38:29] that's too much and like today you know
[38:32] if we say oh you're long your sleeves
[38:33] have to be down to your wrist bone or
[38:35] whatever more like that's too much
[38:37] that's that's excessive you know or our
[38:39] men's hair can't be passed there their
[38:42] ear you know that they make it legalism
[38:44] we're you know we know Jesus maybe by
[38:46] history had a hair down his shoulders
[38:48] it's made it's possible but the thing
[38:50] was his hair was cut women have to have
[38:53] uncut hair but men have to have cut hair
[38:56] so we want to understand we want we must
[38:59] not be legal
[39:01] which means adding on to the Word of God
[39:03] the Pharisees were legal they added on
[39:05] to the word they said you gotta wash
[39:06] your hands and do all these extra things
[39:08] that was all excessive but Jesus never
[39:12] disobeyed one word he was fully obedient
[39:15] to the Word of God and so that's what we
[39:16] want to be we want to be fully obedient
[39:18] and we don't want anything excessive on
[39:20] top of the word we just want the Word of
[39:22] God okay now remember they also had the
[39:25] spirit of discrimination or segregation
[39:27] because Peter wouldn't eat with the
[39:28] Gentiles so they had to battle that
[39:31] spirit the spirit of discrimination or
[39:33] segregation like I'm better than you and
[39:35] you're just a little bit dirtier I'm
[39:37] just you know you're you're a pastor
[39:39] you're just too dirty you know you're
[39:40] not as holy as I am so II just can't eat
[39:42] together and fellowship and so that's
[39:46] what Peter had he had a wrong spirit on
[39:47] him and pawed to correct him so you see
[39:50] now can you see how that could happen
[39:51] today for example when the Saints on
[39:53] Sunday just last Sunday one of the
[39:56] Saints and I were talking after service
[39:58] and they said brother Jesse you just
[39:59] don't understand you know churches where
[40:01] I grew up you know they said it's all
[40:07] it's all segregated by money so the rich
[40:11] message believers won't talk to the poor
[40:13] message believers isn't that said that's
[40:16] a form of segregation in that set and
[40:19] all saying they got the Holy Ghost right
[40:22] well they may but they may not Peter had
[40:27] the Holy Ghost we know that but he got
[40:30] corrected by the word
[40:32] and so if we're wrong and if anyone says
[40:34] they got the Holy Ghost they're wrong if
[40:35] the word comes to them and they don't
[40:37] get corrected they probably don't have
[40:38] the Holy Ghost but if we're wrong and we
[40:40] get corrected that shows that might be
[40:42] good sign we have the Holy Ghost you get
[40:45] you understand so see every Church you
[40:47] know every Church struggles with some
[40:48] things you know brother man person if
[40:50] your church isn't being battled you're
[40:51] not a real church so I'm glad we get
[40:54] battled because a real church hallelujah
[40:57] now the church in Corinth battled
[40:59] sensual temptations remember that the
[41:03] man was sleeping with his stepmother
[41:05] remember that and the Bible Paul said
[41:07] you weren't even mourning about that so
[41:09] people the church was like huh that's
[41:10] okay they weren't even sad about it you
[41:13] know why cuz they were battling the two
[41:15] they battled that because spirits hang
[41:17] around churches right spirits are
[41:19] territorial they hang around that
[41:21] remember Paul said such were some of you
[41:23] some of you were whoremongers some of
[41:25] you were effeminate which means a child
[41:27] molester
[41:28] some of you were homosexual he said but
[41:31] you were sanctified and washed by the
[41:33] Spirit of God amen
[41:34] you see those spirits still hung around
[41:36] there and it calls this man here to
[41:39] sleep with his stepmother and so they
[41:41] battled that not only did they battle
[41:42] that they battled fanaticism remember
[41:46] hard to correct him and say you know you
[41:48] all want to speak in tongues he said but
[41:49] you can't do that the most three he said
[41:52] two at the most three see they they all
[41:54] wanted to have a partner they all wanted
[41:56] to get really and there's nothing wrong
[41:57] with speaking in tongues it's just got
[41:59] to be an order right it's good it's good
[42:03] it's good to be emotional I love God's
[42:05] emotions that he brings but they got to
[42:07] be in order by the Holy Spirit so see
[42:09] they have different battles the church
[42:14] at Thessalonica they battle lazyness pod
[42:17] to rebuke some of them and say if you
[42:19] don't work you don't eat remember that
[42:21] in the scripture you had to rebuke them
[42:23] a little lazy spear all the coming of
[42:26] Lord why should I work the company
[42:27] lawyers gonna be anytime run Jessie well
[42:29] then you then just eat on the trashcan
[42:31] then because you should only eat what
[42:34] you work for honey no that's the
[42:36] scripture if you know if a man don't
[42:38] provide for his own children he's worse
[42:39] than an infidel that's a spirit that a
[42:41] church battled right they battle that
[42:44] laziness well
[42:46] she's gonna come why should I even try
[42:47] why should I even get insurance or why
[42:49] should I even get car insurance you know
[42:51] but the Bible says obey the laws of the
[42:53] land respect those in authority so see
[42:57] what do you need you need a real wisdom
[42:58] of God you need a real discernment of
[43:00] spirit that's what we need today but
[43:02] ramps that's one of the greatest gifts
[43:03] today and the end time is to have
[43:04] discernment a spirit to discern the
[43:07] truth from air and then remember
[43:10] persecution in Chapter 1 they bat a lot
[43:12] of persecution I preached on that a few
[43:14] weeks ago in passing Paul said it was an
[43:17] evident token of their love for God so
[43:20] the fact that they had persecution
[43:22] showed was a real sign that they were
[43:24] real believers amen now we'll get to the
[43:26] ones in emphasis we haven't got there
[43:27] really because as we get back there
[43:30] we're kind of and I'm gonna skip ahead
[43:32] just a little bit here we're kind of in
[43:34] this second theme remember there's three
[43:35] themes member Scofield says there's
[43:38] three themes and there's three themes in
[43:40] emphasis they're exalted position the
[43:42] body of Christ both Jew and Gentile and
[43:45] then now warfare when we get to chapter
[43:47] four which may be Sunday or maybe next
[43:50] week or whatever the Lord if the Lord
[43:51] tarries then we're gonna start seeing
[43:53] what the church actually struggled with
[43:55] okay but right now in Ephesus we haven't
[43:58] really seen them Paul's just given us
[44:00] our position he showed how we're one
[44:02] body this mystery of the one body of Jew
[44:04] and Gentile let me go back so I can get
[44:07] on that again I remember this church
[44:08] started with twelve men being filled
[44:11] with the Holy Ghost that's what that's a
[44:12] great way to start a church amen
[44:14] huh but Paul was writing them from
[44:18] prison remember that that's chapter
[44:19] three four and six he was either incest
[44:23] Cerrito or Rome under house arrest or
[44:25] prison arrest and then Takai 'kiss
[44:28] carried the letter this letter of
[44:31] Ephesus Ephesians he carried the letter
[44:33] to the church and possibly the letter to
[44:35] the Colossians for Paul said to tychicus
[44:38] would make known all things about Paul's
[44:41] condition so it's likely that this man
[44:44] carried it and then the church received
[44:48] this letter from Paul who was in prison
[44:50] I'm sorry I must have repeated that yeah
[44:52] but they knew it was the scripture be
[44:54] just like Peter knew whatever Paul wrote
[44:57] with Scripture C they'd heard Paul's
[44:59] testing
[45:00] Jesus knocked him off his horse he went
[45:02] to Rabia for three years and then he
[45:04] didn't even see the apostles till 14
[45:06] years so for 11 years then after three
[45:10] years in Arabia eleven more years he
[45:12] didn't even go to Jerusalem until no
[45:13] fourteen whole years so they'd all heard
[45:16] about his conversion they'd all knew he
[45:18] was commissioned by Christ to go to the
[45:21] Gentiles
[45:22] so they received his letters as
[45:24] Scripture a dispensation or a season of
[45:27] the gospel had been given to Paul from
[45:30] God all right now I don't know remember
[45:32] this I preached on this on the Ephesian
[45:35] Church age the brother BAM writes this
[45:38] he says repent quickly don't hesitate
[45:39] evidently Ephesus did not hesitate for
[45:44] her lifespan was not very long now this
[45:47] really helps me brother Adam this really
[45:49] helps me our church has lasted 11 years
[45:52] that shows me I've repented right
[45:55] because if we don't repent God will take
[45:57] this God will take the candlestick out
[45:59] of the out of the area so Ephesus
[46:02] wouldn't repent so after a few decades I
[46:04] think it was like 30 or 40 years the
[46:06] church was totally removed history shows
[46:08] that God took the the believers out God
[46:11] pulled him out because the people
[46:13] wouldn't repent see how it is important
[46:14] for everybody in the church to repent
[46:17] everyone in the church must repent or if
[46:20] they don't God said I will take the
[46:22] candlestick out of the land
[46:24] I'll take those are the Holy Ghost out
[46:25] and they can still have a church but be
[46:27] a dead church we don't want a dead
[46:29] church we want a living Church with
[46:31] living prayers and living the signs and
[46:33] wonders and we want Christ in our myths
[46:35] amen all the gifts of God hallelujah so
[46:39] see by a few decades later there wasn't
[46:42] even one Christian left that's why we
[46:44] must constantly repent and constantly be
[46:47] faithful to God now remember there's our
[46:50] three themes let's get in out of the
[46:51] message here let me set a little timer
[46:54] here by God's grace
[46:56] now the fellowship I love this when I
[46:59] just saw this thought it made me cry
[47:00] when I written when I studied this the
[47:02] one time it was such a blessing just you
[47:04] know about the Holy Ghost this is all
[47:05] about the Holy Ghost so you love the
[47:07] Holy Ghost huh it's eternal life if you
[47:09] got it then you got eternal life in you
[47:11] amen but that's what he's saying here
[47:13] the
[47:13] the fellowship or the another word is
[47:16] intimacy of the mystery intimacy that's
[47:20] what the word fellowship means so here's
[47:21] the word fellowship and the Greek it
[47:23] actually means intimacy its intercourse
[47:26] so like a husband and wife it's that
[47:27] type of intimacy the intimacy of the
[47:31] mystery it's a joint participation it's
[47:34] communion
[47:35] that's what communion is right right in
[47:36] two Sundays we have communion Lord
[47:38] willing that's what it is it's like
[47:39] having this communion it's like having
[47:41] this intimacy with Christ right Christ
[47:44] I'm eating your word and I'm drinking in
[47:46] your spirit I'm constantly doing that my
[47:49] life is cleaned out I'm gonna remember
[47:51] your death until you come back
[47:53] amen but I'm gonna take in your life the
[47:55] whole time how do they remember your
[47:57] death but we see more of your life all
[48:00] the time amen
[48:01] so Paul's preaching was to help
[48:03] believers see the intimacy of the hidden
[48:07] mystery of God that's what his preaching
[48:09] was for that's it let me read that here
[48:12] verse 8 and 9 verse say unto me Who am
[48:16] less than the least of All Saints
[48:18] remember less than the least so Paul
[48:21] makes himself the lowest of the
[48:23] Christians but we know he's one of the
[48:25] greatest in his eyes he's one the lowest
[48:28] but in God's eyes he's one of the
[48:29] greatest amen
[48:31] how humble he said is this grace given
[48:34] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[48:36] the unsearchable riches of Christ and to
[48:40] make all men see what's the Fellowship
[48:41] of the mystery is that what you guys
[48:42] isn't that what we as believers desire
[48:44] we want all men to see the Fellowship of
[48:47] the mystery don't you I want all my
[48:49] friends to see the intimacy of the
[48:52] mystery of God which is the baptism of
[48:54] the Holy Ghost I want all my friends to
[48:56] see that it's all about being born again
[48:59] hallelujah that's what Paul is saying
[49:00] I'm preaching and I'm trying to make all
[49:03] men see what is the intimacy of this
[49:06] mystery what is the the knowledge of
[49:08] this mystery it's Christ in you amen all
[49:12] right so we're gonna prove that now
[49:13] remember I kind of I just think I
[49:14] repeated this Paul would preach the
[49:16] unsearchable riches of Christ and would
[49:18] seek to make all men and see what the
[49:20] intimacy really was yeah
[49:22] God wants intimacy so deep that it goes
[49:25] to the soul of man
[49:26] the core vis being his very nature now
[49:31] remember let's go to the back to John
[49:32] here John 7:38 let's go back here
[49:35] especially for my children I want them
[49:36] to know this Oh children please pay
[49:38] attention maybe you can read for us here
[49:39] John 7:38 because I've shared this
[49:46] thought with my some of my friends that
[49:47] I do the Bible club with the older the
[49:50] older men that are about my age you know
[49:51] maybe the older I've shared this thought
[49:54] the scripture with them over and over
[49:55] and they're finally starting again after
[49:56] four years by that in four years I've
[49:59] been sharing these water baptism
[50:00] scriptures and now Holy Ghost scriptures
[50:02] and they're finally started to get it
[50:03] after four years which is encouraging to
[50:06] me you know I really I love seeing
[50:08] growth in people's lives so children
[50:11] could you read seven let's start with 37
[50:17] malachi he read 37 38
[50:35] okay now Lydia read verse 39 I want you
[50:37] to see this alright so what Jesus
[50:48] preaching about he's preaching about the
[50:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said drink
[50:52] of the waters come to me if you're
[50:54] thirsty come drink you'll have rivers of
[50:57] water flow audio what's that rivers of
[50:59] praise River is a worship that's right
[51:03] that's what happened the day of
[51:04] Pentecost they were saying the wonderful
[51:05] works of God all of the Messiah Christ
[51:08] is so wonderful hallelujah glory to God
[51:10] Jesus has risen from the dead they're
[51:13] declaring the wonderful works of God
[51:14] living waters are flowing out of their
[51:16] mouths how did he gets the bonus that
[51:18] goes along with being born again glory
[51:21] now remember this scripture says that
[51:26] people weren't born again yet but what
[51:28] did Luke say Luke said John the Baptist
[51:30] was filled with the Holy Ghost from his
[51:31] mother's womb right so how do we know
[51:34] how how do we how do we reconcile those
[51:36] well that just means John the Baptist
[51:38] had the Holy Ghost on his human spear
[51:40] and not on a soul because this picture
[51:42] shows it to us for like I said I'm kind
[51:44] of reviewing this mainly know for sister
[51:47] Connie and my children because I'm not
[51:48] sure what Connie she and I met no really
[51:50] talk about the doctrine you know and I
[51:54] did the same thing when Austin mentioned
[51:55] we're here I tried to just slow down a
[51:57] little bit and teach these so hope this
[51:58] is a blessing the Bible says you have
[52:01] three parts right and Christ wants to
[52:03] sanctify or clean out all of you wholly
[52:06] everything your whole spirit body and
[52:08] soul so there's your body we know that
[52:10] that's the outer court we want the Holy
[52:12] Ghost anointing on the body and then we
[52:14] here's what John the Baptist I think in
[52:16] the mother's room this one I think I
[52:18] believe it we have scripture to prove
[52:19] that he had the anointing in his mind
[52:21] even as a baby he had a human spirit and
[52:24] he jumped he leaped you know when he
[52:26] heard the name Jesus he leaped that's
[52:28] what it'll do to you and I write even
[52:31] today here the name of Jesus and get you
[52:33] off stirred up right all stimulated like
[52:35] ham breeze on Sunday and then the third
[52:39] part is your soul now this is what Jesus
[52:40] is talking about he's how about your
[52:42] soul this is the part that that Jesus
[52:45] was gonna bring rest - okay so let's can
[52:49] we prove that can we we have some
[52:51] readers here brother Adam let's go to
[52:52] Matthew 11:29 I just looked these up
[52:55] Matthew 11:29 I want to prove this to
[52:58] you
[53:00] it was the soul that Jesus was trying to
[53:03] get into Jesus was preaching to them
[53:05] about the Holy Ghost and he's he's
[53:07] trying to get into their soul and I'm
[53:10] turning their bow just give me a moment
[53:12] here at the eleven brother can you read
[53:17] 28 and 29 how about that sir thank you
[53:20] [Music]
[53:29] okay which part of you is gonna find
[53:32] rest your body when no Christians are
[53:35] still gonna be persecuted and tired just
[53:36] like everybody else your mind no your
[53:40] what your soul he's saying come to me
[53:43] and I'm gonna give you rest to your soul
[53:46] he's not talking about the body he's not
[53:49] talking about the human mind he's
[53:50] talking about the baptism of the Holy
[53:51] Ghost in your soul now go
[53:53] Hebrews 4 this is proves it this proves
[53:55] right here Hebrews 4 and this is the
[53:57] squeeze of the Scriptures by the RAM
[53:58] teaches in the church age book about how
[54:00] we're not Sabbatarians or we're not we
[54:02] don't observe the physical Sabbath
[54:04] anymore it's the spiritual Sabbath that
[54:07] counts the holy ghost in the soul which
[54:10] interestingly while you're turning there
[54:11] to Hebrews for I've got two emails in
[54:14] the last month about that they're just
[54:16] these Sabbatarians are pounding on me to
[54:18] make it Saturday like I need to rest
[54:20] Saturday yeah like I read I rest Sunday
[54:23] Sunday I don't work Sunday now I work
[54:26] for God but I don't work in my job
[54:27] sunday is my day but it's it don't that
[54:29] that's my natural day but that's not
[54:31] even what's important what's important
[54:32] is rest in the soul that you get borned
[54:35] again that's what I'm trying to get
[54:37] brother Saturday's your commercial day
[54:39] we're trying to get them to rest from
[54:41] stop trying to earn salvation but to
[54:43] have the Holy Ghost in them amen to have
[54:46] God in them because then when God's in
[54:48] you then you rest from your works now
[54:49] it's not it's not me anymore it's Christ
[54:51] in me you and I just need to pray and
[54:54] then when we pray God leads us to do his
[54:56] will that's that's all it is it's Christ
[54:59] in you it's you resting from your work
[55:02] so I'm not trusting and what Jesse
[55:03] submitted in the flesh I'm trusting in
[55:05] what God does amen what is God done to
[55:08] me lately hallelujah what I just have to
[55:10] yield to him it's Christ doing the works
[55:12] it's not me it's Christ in me amen
[55:15] Hebrews four and so they're very
[55:18] respectful those Sabbatarians but but
[55:21] they sure didn't agree with me and I
[55:22] sure didn't agree with him but yep
[55:25] that's all right that's all right that's
[55:27] I mean what can you do I just we just
[55:29] stand on the Word of God you know oh and
[55:31] I even took him to Colossians where Paul
[55:32] said you know the holy days and Sabbath
[55:36] days and he said which were a shadow of
[55:38] things to come and they say they still
[55:39] can't even see that Paul's saying
[55:41] Sabbath days were shadows that was a
[55:44] shadow taking a physical day of rest
[55:47] that's a good thing we do that on Sunday
[55:49] right we don't work on Sunday but that's
[55:52] just a shadow and a shadow is not the
[55:54] real person right you don't want to
[55:56] shake my shadows hand you want to shake
[55:58] my hand I want to shake your hand not
[56:00] your shadow that's what you want we
[56:02] don't want to talk about Christ shadow
[56:03] we want Christ amen
[56:05] but see it's just it just takes the Holy
[56:08] Spirit that's why we're so thankful God
[56:09] sent a prophet ain't bad because without
[56:11] that we we would have been some along
[56:13] and maybe with and I have friends that
[56:15] have taken off from Friday night like I
[56:17] told you Friday night to Saturday night
[56:18] they physically they have Sabbath's I'll
[56:22] watch football and things like that
[56:23] see son it just shows its inconsistency
[56:26] its worldliness you know but it's just
[56:28] man works but they're physically
[56:30] attracted to that because this this
[56:32] world is so busy yes the cares of life
[56:34] but see it's because they don't have
[56:37] peace in their soul thank God we can
[56:39] have peace in our souls amen
[56:40] that's what they don't have church
[56:42] they're still trying to work and so see
[56:44] now I'm trying to work on a Friday night
[56:46] it's a Saturday they're trying to work
[56:48] on a Sabbath day but we don't work it's
[56:50] Christ working in us and I can truly say
[56:53] that if I did any ever if there's ever
[56:55] anything good in my life it was not me
[56:58] it was Christ in me amen Christ working
[57:01] through me because jesus said apart from
[57:02] me you can do nothing him head okay now
[57:06] he was for one let us therefore fear
[57:10] lest a promise being left us of entering
[57:12] into his rest any of you should come
[57:14] short of it okay so Paul's saying here
[57:17] you know we have to labor to enter into
[57:19] the Holy Ghost you got to work and bring
[57:21] your in other words bring your body
[57:22] under subjection in other words you got
[57:23] to die to yourself you have to submit
[57:26] you have to become humble now I'm gonna
[57:30] skip down to verse 4 for he spake in a
[57:36] certain place of the seventh day on this
[57:37] wise and God did rest the seventh day
[57:39] from all his works and in this place
[57:41] again if they shall enter into my rest
[57:42] so you talk about how God took a seven
[57:44] literal physical seventh day of rest now
[57:49] now look at verse six seeing therefore
[57:51] it remaineth that some must enter
[57:53] therein and they to whom it was first
[57:54] preached and are not in because of
[57:56] unbelief again he limited a certain day
[57:58] saying in David today after so long a
[58:01] time as it is said today if you will
[58:04] hear his voice harden not your coach
[58:08] Joshua means Jesus Jehovah our Savior
[58:11] for if Jesus had given them rest then
[58:14] would he not afterward have spoken of
[58:16] another day
[58:18] so see Paul's showing how Joshua when he
[58:21] entered the promised land that wasn't
[58:23] the real rest God wanted God wanted us
[58:25] to enter the promised land of the Holy
[58:26] Ghost right the soul born again of the
[58:29] Holy Ghost
[58:30] Joshua brought them in the land but God
[58:32] want us to go into the land of the Holy
[58:34] Ghost as a type now look at verse 9 this
[58:39] I was trying to prove it to the
[58:40] individual both individuals on the email
[58:42] was verse 9 there remaineth therefore
[58:44] rest of the people of God you see there
[58:46] still arrest even though they enter in
[58:48] the promised land and rested and they
[58:50] honor the 7-day there still remained
[58:53] arrest for the people of God right
[58:55] Joshua gave them the rest they took the
[58:58] day off but there remain another ass
[59:01] they men okay now that's verse 10 for he
[59:05] that is entered into his rest
[59:06] he have also seized from his own works
[59:08] as God did from his time about New
[59:10] Testament rest verse 11 let us labor
[59:13] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[59:15] any man fall after the same example of
[59:18] unbelief amen suppose you say we must
[59:21] enter into the promise of God it's the
[59:23] rest Jesus spoke of for your souls amen
[59:26] that's the rest he's talking about rest
[59:28] for your soul where it's no longer me
[59:31] it's Christ in me now verse 12 proves it
[59:33] for the word of God is quick see this is
[59:35] with us of the rest the Word of God is
[59:37] quick powerful sharper than any
[59:39] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[59:40] dividing asunder of soul and spirit soul
[59:42] and spirit there you go the Word of God
[59:44] dividing the soul and spirit and of the
[59:47] joints in the marrow and is a discerner
[59:48] of the thoughts and the tense of the
[59:51] heart can brace amen amen that's just a
[59:55] real quick brief study on that all right
[59:59] now I'm gonna skip past this quote I
[1:00:00] usually school with marriage and divorce
[1:00:01] how we can't we have to go further with
[1:00:04] the word or else Christ can put us away
[1:00:06] I'm gonna skip that because I kind of
[1:00:08] gone over that twice so God want a deep
[1:00:11] intimacy with his creation how we would
[1:00:14] do this was a mystery though how how was
[1:00:16] God gonna get greater intimacy it was a
[1:00:18] mystery now through the message we now
[1:00:21] know what God was thinking God was gonna
[1:00:23] start god above us then he was gonna get
[1:00:26] closer to them God with us and then he
[1:00:29] was gonna get in us by God's grace this
[1:00:31] was God's plan for it
[1:00:32] see right father son Holy Ghost that's
[1:00:36] this plan of relationship to man
[1:00:38] intimacy so Paul said this mystery for
[1:00:43] God's desire to dwell in us was actually
[1:00:45] hidden God this was actually hid in his
[1:00:47] mind that's what Ephesians 3:8 9 said
[1:00:51] which from the beginning of the world
[1:00:53] was hidden God so see the that's why the
[1:00:55] Father Son and Holy Ghost is a mystery
[1:00:57] people asked me one time and I said it
[1:00:59] wrong the first time but they asked me
[1:01:01] later what was Matthew 28:19 where he
[1:01:03] said father son Holy Ghost was Jesus
[1:01:05] telling a parable one time I thought it
[1:01:07] was a parable it's not it's not a
[1:01:09] parable he's speaking in mystery Jesus
[1:01:12] is speaking of mystery Jesus is
[1:01:13] unleashing a mystery you're gonna
[1:01:15] baptize them in the name of the Father
[1:01:17] Son Holy Ghost he's speaking in the
[1:01:19] mystery because that mystery was hidden
[1:01:21] God that God is a father he'd become a
[1:01:24] son and he drown us by the Holy Ghost
[1:01:26] amen and there's one name to the Father
[1:01:30] Son Holy Ghost not names plural but one
[1:01:33] name it's the Lord Jesus Christ you see
[1:01:36] he was speaking in history in Matthew 20
[1:01:38] 19 that's what I told the guy teach the
[1:01:40] Bible club with just a few weeks ago I
[1:01:42] said he wasn't speaking in parable it
[1:01:44] was mystery that's why I said that
[1:01:46] mother bram said that even if Jesus was
[1:01:48] here today he's still to say the same
[1:01:49] thing baptized name a name of the father
[1:01:51] and all the ghosts because he has to
[1:01:53] give there has to be scripture that
[1:01:54] people stumble by people that really
[1:01:57] don't want to serve God the God has to
[1:01:59] lay out of Scripture there that though
[1:02:00] they'll turn and and because they don't
[1:02:02] agree with the truth they got to believe
[1:02:03] a lie
[1:02:04] see they gotta have scriptures there
[1:02:06] because Paul said that false doctrine
[1:02:08] manifests those who are heretics
[1:02:11] I mean alas the scripture gonna read
[1:02:14] that let's go - I believe it's Romans 16
[1:02:17] if I'm not mistaken I'm just gonna go
[1:02:18] off my memory here so see God has to lay
[1:02:22] scriptures in here that kind of seem
[1:02:23] contradictory but they're not we know
[1:02:25] they're not there's no contradiction but
[1:02:28] he has to leave them in there because
[1:02:29] false teachers and doctrine will always
[1:02:33] manifest who is the heretic who has left
[1:02:35] of faith who's preaching for money or
[1:02:38] who's preaching for popularity or who's
[1:02:39] preaching for women the false doctrine
[1:02:41] always shows who's wrong amen and true
[1:02:45] doctrine oiz shows who's
[1:02:47] hallelujah thank God for that okay now
[1:02:51] give me just a moment as I look for here
[1:02:59] let me look on my Bible search I don't
[1:03:01] see it here I forgot my Bible at home I
[1:03:03] left it right by my table I think it's
[1:03:09] manifest heresy so just a minute here
[1:03:11] I'm sorry let me find it here yeah there
[1:03:16] it is okay it's not it's I'm sorry its
[1:03:21] first Corinthians 11 19 forgive me
[1:03:22] Church I thought it was Romans 16 tells
[1:03:26] us to avoid all those who teach false
[1:03:28] doctrine but its first Corinthians 11 19
[1:03:30] I'm sorry forgive me I got my books
[1:03:33] mixed up there eleven nineteen yeah sure
[1:03:38] I'm thankful for concordance amen first
[1:03:40] Corinthians 11 19 for there must also be
[1:03:45] what heresies among you know we get all
[1:03:48] you know we I do I know I do I get
[1:03:50] little nervous when there's heresies I
[1:03:51] get the kind of discouraged but Paul's
[1:03:53] saying this must happen you must have
[1:03:56] heresies among you that they which are
[1:03:58] approved may be made manifest among you
[1:04:02] okay can never understand that by God's
[1:04:04] grace so see Jesus would have still said
[1:04:06] father so only ghost if he was alive
[1:04:08] today he's to go baptize them in the
[1:04:10] name of the Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:04:10] because those that are heretics are
[1:04:13] those that really don't want the truth
[1:04:14] they would have found some way to
[1:04:16] detractor they would have found some way
[1:04:18] to separate from the Holy Ghost because
[1:04:20] the Bible said their sensual not having
[1:04:23] the Holy Ghost and they separate from
[1:04:25] those who do have the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:27] right there he meant hallelujah and
[1:04:29] that's in Judas go to Jude verse chapter
[1:04:31] 1 it's kind of hot lady can you turn
[1:04:33] down the key turn off the heater hon are
[1:04:35] you guys everybody hot I'm kind of warm
[1:04:36] yeah I'm kind of one can you turn off
[1:04:38] the heater hon just put it off and just
[1:04:39] put the fan on okay so Jude one I'm
[1:04:44] sorry Jude one you see so the person who
[1:04:48] doesn't have the Holy Ghost has to have
[1:04:50] some reason to leave and go start their
[1:04:51] own church er but God always starts with
[1:04:54] true doctrine right like on the day of
[1:04:56] Pentecost and then the wolves come in
[1:04:58] later you understand that
[1:05:00] Oh
[1:05:00] like brother man said about Moses Moses
[1:05:02] brought in the signs of miracles first
[1:05:04] he said then Janus and Jambres started
[1:05:06] impersonating him after that God always
[1:05:09] did it first
[1:05:10] yeah Paul came into Ephesus started
[1:05:13] church and he says I've cried for three
[1:05:14] years wolves are gonna come in and see
[1:05:17] then Satan comes in afterwards
[1:05:19] okay so Jude one and it's verse yeah its
[1:05:25] verse 19 these be they who separate
[1:05:28] themselves sensual not having the spirit
[1:05:30] so cease you know false teachers will
[1:05:33] have some lust like I said money
[1:05:35] popularity or women some lusts or
[1:05:37] something like that maybe big buildings
[1:05:39] which would be money but they need a
[1:05:41] reason to criticize the true church so
[1:05:44] they bring a false doctrine and that
[1:05:46] false doctrine it blast seems the truth
[1:05:49] but then because of that it manifests
[1:05:52] that they're not the true believer does
[1:05:54] that help by God's grace nope that's the
[1:05:57] scripture and they'll always separate
[1:05:59] themselves didn't Judas separate himself
[1:06:00] from the true believers right he
[1:06:03] separate himself but then the Bible said
[1:06:06] those that are with the faith will stay
[1:06:08] with us there's no doubt they'll
[1:06:09] continue with us those who are faithful
[1:06:11] Christians will always stay with the
[1:06:12] real Christians that's right
[1:06:14] okay so par me let's go move on see that
[1:06:16] mystery was hidden God it was hidden God
[1:06:18] I'm a father son Holy Ghost but I'm
[1:06:20] gonna manifest it at a certain times now
[1:06:23] Colossians ones are the same thing
[1:06:25] Paul said I'm a minister of the
[1:06:27] dispensation of God to fulfill the Word
[1:06:29] of God even the mystery which has been
[1:06:31] hidden from ages and from generations
[1:06:32] but has now made manifest to a Saints
[1:06:35] whom God would make no one as the riches
[1:06:37] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:06:39] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[1:06:42] of glory how many feel you got glory
[1:06:44] inside of you I know I've got glory
[1:06:46] inside because I know what it was like
[1:06:47] before I had this glory its Christ and
[1:06:50] you the hope of heaven the hope of glory
[1:06:52] heavens inside of you amen Colossians
[1:06:56] three to set your affections on things
[1:06:57] above not on things on the earth for you
[1:06:59] are dead I'm dead and my life is hid
[1:07:02] with Christ in God amen so my real life
[1:07:07] the real person that I am is in God
[1:07:09] where is it it's in his mind and Here I
[1:07:13] am living out
[1:07:14] God's will for me that's already in his
[1:07:16] mind but my life all I'm gonna be all
[1:07:19] I'm ever gonna achieve has already hid
[1:07:20] in the mind of God hallelujah and I'm
[1:07:23] just livin it out I'm just following the
[1:07:25] will of God I'm just doing what God
[1:07:26] asked me to do every day so see God
[1:07:29] above us
[1:07:29] Adam was sent away from breaking the
[1:07:31] garden breaking the fellowship in the
[1:07:33] Garden of Eden he broke the intimacy
[1:07:35] because he wasn't born again he broked
[1:07:37] into the sea he broke the fellowship ya
[1:07:40] then Enoch walked with God see how he
[1:07:41] starting to get the fellowship back
[1:07:43] Abraham called was called the friend of
[1:07:45] God God's riding to fellowship he's got
[1:07:47] above us
[1:07:49] he called Israel of Egypt to be a son
[1:07:51] and also a priesthood unto himself see
[1:07:54] once and now he calls a just a group of
[1:07:56] people before he walked with individuals
[1:07:58] now I'm gonna walk with a group of
[1:07:59] people it's God above us because Israel
[1:08:02] was called God said I loved Israel and I
[1:08:05] called my son out of Egypt in Exodus 19
[1:08:08] he said you shall be a kingdom of
[1:08:10] priests unto me a holy nation I mean no
[1:08:12] we're kings and priests to see we're a
[1:08:15] different kind of King Kingdom a
[1:08:17] different kind of priesthood we're the
[1:08:19] spiritual priesthood they were natural
[1:08:21] physical Israel a holy land priesthood
[1:08:24] but we're universal heavenly Holy Ghost
[1:08:27] field priesthood hey man that's exactly
[1:08:30] right
[1:08:30] God above us God even caught Israel's
[1:08:33] wife but she was not faithful in Exodus
[1:08:36] I'm sorry zekiel 16 God found Israel and
[1:08:40] blood and mud pulled her out cleaned her
[1:08:43] up and said I swear I've entered into
[1:08:45] covenant with you saith the Lord you
[1:08:46] became mine but a few verses later he
[1:08:49] said but you didn't you about you trust
[1:08:51] in your own beauty and played the harlot
[1:08:52] because of thy renown
[1:08:54] and then Jeremiah he said backsliding
[1:08:57] Israel committed adultery I had put her
[1:08:59] away I gave her a bill of divorcement
[1:09:01] see he's got above us and he was trying
[1:09:04] so hard to to love them even he even
[1:09:08] dwelt among them with the Ark of the
[1:09:09] Covenant he was so close to them but
[1:09:11] their hearts turned away so God said
[1:09:14] okay I'll bring come in my own body I'll
[1:09:17] be a manual if you don't want my spirit
[1:09:20] there well I'll put my spirit in a body
[1:09:22] and outcome as God with us and the Bible
[1:09:26] I didn't have many scriptures on this
[1:09:28] guy they ran out of time so forgive me
[1:09:29] remember the angel said Gloria he said
[1:09:32] behold I bring you good tidings of great
[1:09:34] joy which shall be to all people glory
[1:09:37] to God in the highest peace on earth
[1:09:39] peace and goodwill toward men so when
[1:09:42] God came down to earth now God with us
[1:09:45] great joy was upon the earth
[1:09:48] hallelujah great joy good tidings peace
[1:09:53] toward all men and then Jesus while he
[1:09:57] was God with us
[1:09:58] he spoke about being in us in John 14 he
[1:10:03] said I'll pray the Father give you
[1:10:04] another comforter
[1:10:05] I'm sorry comforter that he may abide
[1:10:07] with you forever
[1:10:08] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:10:09] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:10:11] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[1:10:14] he dwelleth with you and listen shall be
[1:10:16] in you see he was saying I'm with you
[1:10:19] now but I'm going to be in you
[1:10:22] hallelujah I will not leave you
[1:10:25] comfortless I will come to you what I
[1:10:27] hope we have today we are not orphans
[1:10:29] we're not we're not people that can't be
[1:10:32] comforted we can be comforted we can
[1:10:35] have peace today because the comforters
[1:10:36] here with us amen that's why I was
[1:10:39] praying for that Texas church you know I
[1:10:40] my heart goes out to them I forgot to
[1:10:42] put them on the prayer list but does it
[1:10:44] but don't don't we all believe that God
[1:10:47] can comfort them now of course they're
[1:10:49] Baptist they don't believe in the full
[1:10:50] Holy Ghost like we do but they can
[1:10:52] experience the Holy Ghost -
[1:10:53] sanctification and that can be a comfort
[1:10:56] can you say amen to that
[1:10:57] they can be comforted by the Holy Spirit
[1:10:59] in that way not to the soul because they
[1:11:02] reject the word to get there but they
[1:11:04] can have a real experience with God they
[1:11:06] can be comforted by the Holy Spirit in
[1:11:07] the way of sanctification and
[1:11:09] justification amen which are all great
[1:11:13] things justification is a mighty work
[1:11:14] Saint vacation is a mighty work but the
[1:11:17] Holy Ghost is the sealing work amen it's
[1:11:20] the seal to the day of redemption and
[1:11:22] then you amen every word of God
[1:11:24] hallelujah you live it and ain't that
[1:11:26] every word of God now Jesus did I tell
[1:11:29] you the truth it's necessary it's
[1:11:30] expedient for you that I go away for if
[1:11:33] I go not away the comforter will not
[1:11:35] come unto you but if I depart I'll send
[1:11:37] him unto you you know you and I would
[1:11:39] have been just like the disciples we
[1:11:40] were
[1:11:40] been crying on Saturday oh Jesus is gone
[1:11:42] he's gone you and I would have been the
[1:11:44] same way wouldn't you like to have a
[1:11:46] pastor like Jesus who can walk on the
[1:11:48] water he called the storms he raised the
[1:11:52] dead he break up every funeral by
[1:11:54] raising the dead up of course we would I
[1:11:57] rat it because it's easier to lean on
[1:11:59] somebody who's there physically right
[1:12:01] it's easier but Jesus said it's better
[1:12:04] that I go away because that you won't
[1:12:07] get the Holy Ghost inside of you if I
[1:12:09] stay here and then he said when the
[1:12:11] Spirit of Truth has come he'll guide you
[1:12:13] into all truth
[1:12:14] now remember brother man so that's the
[1:12:15] evidence of the Holy Ghost right here I
[1:12:16] show the scripture all the time with
[1:12:17] people this is the evidence of the Holy
[1:12:19] Ghost I just shared it when I took
[1:12:20] Benjamin in the hotel last week and the
[1:12:22] woman said what church are you do you
[1:12:24] believe in tongues I said no so we we
[1:12:26] have tongues from time to time and we
[1:12:28] believe it's a gift but I said it's not
[1:12:32] the evidence I said John 16:13 I quoted
[1:12:34] this exact scripture brother Benjamin
[1:12:36] can tell you he was right there I said
[1:12:37] the Holy Ghost is being guided into all
[1:12:39] the truth of God that's Devon so the
[1:12:41] Holy Ghost that you can live all the
[1:12:44] word for your age
[1:12:45] and she said yeah I always believe that
[1:12:47] too I gave her my card you know but she
[1:12:50] never called me just try to witness the
[1:12:52] people you know they're hungry we have
[1:12:55] plenty of food for them if they're
[1:12:57] thirsty we have plenty of living water
[1:12:59] here we do by God's grace he'll not see
[1:13:04] the Holy Ghost won't speak of himself
[1:13:06] but whom sober or whatsoever he shall
[1:13:09] hear that shall I speak he will show you
[1:13:10] things that come the Holy Ghost will
[1:13:12] show us thing to come I'm me so the Holy
[1:13:15] Ghost will always make you worship Jesus
[1:13:17] for he shall receive a mine and shall
[1:13:20] show unto you all things that the father
[1:13:21] has are mine therefore I said that he
[1:13:24] shall take a mine and show it unto you
[1:13:27] and that day I love this you shall no
[1:13:30] not guess not hope for children we don't
[1:13:35] have to hope for the well do I have the
[1:13:36] Holy Ghost or not he said that that day
[1:13:39] you'll know that I'm in my father you
[1:13:42] and me and I'm in you we could know
[1:13:45] we've got God inside of us see that
[1:13:47] that's where the Holy Ghost is for - no
[1:13:49] I've got Christ in me like today I went
[1:13:51] to another meeting and this happens all
[1:13:52] the time
[1:13:52] all the teachers around
[1:13:54] Prince Prince around there and other
[1:13:55] people they're all custon about dirty
[1:13:57] about kids cuss and saying the bad words
[1:13:59] and I'm just sitting there staring at my
[1:14:00] screen like praying for them like God
[1:14:02] have mercy on these people and some of
[1:14:05] these people all say they go to church
[1:14:06] and love God and everything like that
[1:14:07] laughing about kids cussing and see
[1:14:11] that's just another reminder I've always
[1:14:12] got to be a light for Christ and I am
[1:14:15] just by saying they're not laughing and
[1:14:16] focusing and praying I am a light for
[1:14:19] Christ enough to answer right just like
[1:14:23] you on your job or your home where you
[1:14:24] are your family
[1:14:25] if you stand out with the word go off to
[1:14:28] answer for not living like you that's
[1:14:31] exactly right
[1:14:31] I love this how do you know how do you
[1:14:34] know Christ Christ is in you because he
[1:14:37] that hath my Commandments keeps them I
[1:14:38] keep the Word of God he it is that
[1:14:42] loveth me that's how I know I love
[1:14:44] Christ I keep the word he's in love with
[1:14:46] me shall be loved to my father I'll love
[1:14:48] him and manifest myself to him okay now
[1:14:50] now watch how Paul describes God in us
[1:14:53] see this is the this was the mystery God
[1:14:55] was above us with us but now I wants to
[1:14:58] be in us look how he describes it
[1:15:01] because remember Joe was wondering how
[1:15:04] can a man be justified with God
[1:15:05] how can he be clean he that's born of a
[1:15:08] woman see Joe was just getting cleaned
[1:15:09] by the blood of the sacrifice of blood
[1:15:11] of bulls and goats like cameras
[1:15:12] preaching and David in Psalm 51 he
[1:15:16] desired to have a clean heart again
[1:15:18] after falling in adultery and murder the
[1:15:21] man who slayed Goliath couldn't even
[1:15:23] slay his own lust remember that he slay
[1:15:27] Goliath but he couldn't even slay his
[1:15:29] own desire to take a man's wife can you
[1:15:32] be that the Holy Ghost
[1:15:34] the oil was poured all over his head but
[1:15:37] where was that when it came to Bathsheba
[1:15:39] it dried up it just see how the New
[1:15:43] Testament is so much greater we have so
[1:15:45] much greater power are you with me it's
[1:15:47] so much greater because David got slew
[1:15:51] by a lust even but you and I can slay
[1:15:53] that lust demon and there'll be no songs
[1:15:58] about us you know Adam is slain is ten
[1:16:00] thousand demons and Jesse's slain a
[1:16:02] thousand
[1:16:04] like there'll be no parades for us but
[1:16:07] I guarantee it's written in heaven hey
[1:16:10] man I guarantee it's written in heaven
[1:16:13] because the works of the believer are
[1:16:14] recorded in heaven hallelujah there's a
[1:16:16] book about us there's a book about you
[1:16:18] and you overcome there's a book about me
[1:16:20] and it's on record there and Christ is
[1:16:22] recording it amen so see we're not
[1:16:26] better than David but we've just got
[1:16:27] more access to more power
[1:16:29] amen hallelujah see to bring all these
[1:16:33] to bring this land in this objection
[1:16:36] right
[1:16:37] that's what I want to bring that out and
[1:16:39] remember here's how Paul describes it
[1:16:41] Paul says we are the temple of God and
[1:16:43] God said I'm gonna dwell in sister
[1:16:46] so-and-so I'm gonna walk in brother
[1:16:49] Jesse what a privilege we have Church
[1:16:52] God is dwelling in me God is walking it
[1:16:55] when I went to work today God walked
[1:16:57] into work today hmm that's how he
[1:17:01] describes it and I got 15 more minutes
[1:17:05] bear with me this is how he describes it
[1:17:09] God is walking inside of you when God is
[1:17:12] in us this is God's house I am God's
[1:17:18] house God lives here hallelujah right
[1:17:24] God lives here God's walking in me this
[1:17:28] is the description of it not just
[1:17:29] anointing and then leaves and northing
[1:17:31] the leaves but God actually lives and
[1:17:33] abides here amen don't get me wrong we
[1:17:36] do need that anointing on our human mind
[1:17:38] and flesh we do need that but when it
[1:17:40] all comes down to it when it boils down
[1:17:42] to obeying the Word of God or staying
[1:17:43] with the word you don't feel like it
[1:17:45] how do you know he's there because the
[1:17:46] anchor holds amen
[1:17:48] it holds you out of sin hallelujah it
[1:17:51] holds you into righteousness and keeps
[1:17:54] us in out hallelujah I'll be their God
[1:17:57] they'll be my people come out from among
[1:17:58] them be separ say the Lord
[1:18:00] don't touch the unclean thing and I will
[1:18:02] receive you and I'll be a father unto
[1:18:04] you so I'm I I'm the house of my father
[1:18:08] my father lives inside of me my father
[1:18:10] walks inside of me oh mercy now where'd
[1:18:18] you get this scripture do you ever run
[1:18:19] the run the reference on this this is
[1:18:21] where
[1:18:21] the scripture from the context is the
[1:18:23] two lambs for daily sacrifice like camp
[1:18:25] preached on Sunday so that when when
[1:18:28] God's telling Moses about the daily
[1:18:29] sacrifice he said I was sanctified the
[1:18:32] tabernacle of the congregation the altar
[1:18:33] I'll saying if I also both Aaron his
[1:18:35] sons to minister me in the priests
[1:18:36] office and I will dwell among the
[1:18:38] children Israel and will be their God
[1:18:40] what is he saying that God wants to live
[1:18:43] in us now he wants us to be a living
[1:18:45] sacrifice every day make sacrifices so
[1:18:49] God can walk in us amen
[1:18:52] so God can talk through us hallelujah it
[1:18:59] also gets quoted again here in Leviticus
[1:19:01] 26 the context of this is God's promise
[1:19:04] to bless Israel once they possess the
[1:19:06] promised land this is the whole chapters
[1:19:07] about that all the promises once they
[1:19:09] get the promise then and I will set my
[1:19:11] Tabernacle among you and my soul shall
[1:19:13] not abhor you and I will walk among you
[1:19:17] and be your God and you should be my
[1:19:20] people see God above us was just God God
[1:19:22] above us it was he was just among us but
[1:19:25] now it's God in us oh it's so beautiful
[1:19:28] and I remember Paul said before the Holy
[1:19:30] Ghost we were without hope
[1:19:32] we had no covenant we had no God we're
[1:19:35] Gentiles think of all that we have now
[1:19:38] through the intimacy of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:39] the fellowship of this mystery Oh mine
[1:19:43] that made me cry when I studied that the
[1:19:45] first time think of all that we have
[1:19:47] because the Bible said we were without
[1:19:49] Christ we're aliens from Israel we're
[1:19:52] strangers we had no hope and we had no
[1:19:56] God we had nothing
[1:19:58] but now with Christ we've got God inside
[1:20:02] of us we've got eternal life inside of
[1:20:04] us we've got a portion of the king and
[1:20:06] kings and Lord of lords inside of us the
[1:20:10] Spirit of Christ now I'll try to close
[1:20:14] here yeah I got 12 minutes here now in
[1:20:18] verse 10 let me go back to Ephesians 3
[1:20:22] can you imagine this is what all Paul's
[1:20:24] saying all this I'm just scratching the
[1:20:26] surface you know this is the letter that
[1:20:28] the people read in Ephesus they're
[1:20:30] trying to stay on fire and they're
[1:20:32] hearing about the Fellowship of the
[1:20:33] mystery
[1:20:34] I've tried to preach to you the
[1:20:36] Fellowship of the mystery I want
[1:20:38] everybody to see that this mystery is an
[1:20:41] intimacy with God God wants to be so
[1:20:43] personal with you that he lives in you
[1:20:46] he walks in you and talks with you every
[1:20:48] day that people see Christ in you I'm
[1:20:53] trying to make everybody see that
[1:20:54] that God can live inside of you too oh
[1:20:56] my that's beautiful
[1:20:58] fusions 310 sorry lost my spot there to
[1:21:05] the intent or purpose that now unto the
[1:21:08] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:21:10] places might be known by the church the
[1:21:12] manifold wisdom of God so he's trying to
[1:21:16] get all men to see the mystery for the
[1:21:18] purpose that all the powers and wisdom
[1:21:21] might be known to the church and here's
[1:21:23] our brother branham set an expectation
[1:21:24] oh God strike the church this morning
[1:21:27] Lord with thy power and with thy
[1:21:30] manifold wisdom hey hey man how I'm
[1:21:34] getting poorer I'm trying to get
[1:21:35] everybody to see that that this is an
[1:21:37] intimate relationship and to understand
[1:21:40] the manifold wisdom and powers that are
[1:21:42] at access to the church are available
[1:21:45] for the church I thought that was
[1:21:48] beautiful
[1:21:48] they just praise the prayer and see when
[1:21:54] we receive the wisdom of God what do we
[1:21:57] start doing we start speaking the wisdom
[1:21:58] of God because the Bible said we speak
[1:22:02] we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery
[1:22:05] now now the mystery now we start sharing
[1:22:08] the mystery right but only the elect
[1:22:11] catch it when sister Beau started
[1:22:13] sharing the mystery with Adam he caught
[1:22:15] it because he's a member of the body of
[1:22:17] Christ right when I share it with people
[1:22:19] like I said last week at the hotel they
[1:22:21] didn't catch it it wasn't for them
[1:22:23] because it's a mystery to them but us we
[1:22:26] speak the mystery like the Bible said
[1:22:28] and it's ordained for our glory
[1:22:30] and what is our glory Christ in us
[1:22:32] that's the only thing we can boast in
[1:22:33] right the only thing we can boast in is
[1:22:35] the cross and how the cross brought us
[1:22:37] the Holy Spirit we can boast of nothing
[1:22:40] Paul said boast I have no nothing else
[1:22:42] to boast of just the cross of Jesus
[1:22:44] Christ
[1:22:45] let me glory in that people can glory in
[1:22:47] their sports and
[1:22:48] their money their fame but our glory in
[1:22:50] the cross of Christ and that now Christ
[1:22:53] is living in me hallelujah that's what
[1:22:55] we glory in see even the hidden wisdom
[1:22:58] which God before Dain before the world
[1:23:00] unto our glory which is the Holy Ghost
[1:23:02] Christ in us the hope of glory which
[1:23:05] none of the Prince of the world knew for
[1:23:07] had they known it they would not have
[1:23:08] crucified the Lord of glory so see say
[1:23:10] none then have that wisdom there's
[1:23:12] certain wisdom that only comes its
[1:23:14] manifold wisdom it's great wisdom on how
[1:23:16] to conduct and live your life and
[1:23:18] glorify God it's great wisdom and that
[1:23:21] was Paul's purpose that we might know
[1:23:23] the manifold wisdom of God because
[1:23:26] remember wise virgins walk wisely right
[1:23:33] if you're wise version your life is
[1:23:35] filled with wisdom with your everyday
[1:23:37] decisions that's why you and I won't
[1:23:40] join certain things we won't do certain
[1:23:42] things why because we're using God's
[1:23:43] wisdom right that's exactly right we
[1:23:48] won't touch certain things we won't go
[1:23:49] certain places we only want other people
[1:23:51] can and even in our church or other
[1:23:53] churches they can go do things but some
[1:23:55] reason you and I can't why because it's
[1:23:58] God's wisdom living through us because
[1:24:00] we walk in wisdom every everything we do
[1:24:03] is based upon God's wisdom the manifold
[1:24:05] wisdom of God we walk in wisdom towards
[1:24:09] them but there are without redeeming the
[1:24:10] time let your speech be always with
[1:24:13] grace see so it affects your words if we
[1:24:16] have the wisdom we have to speak wisdom
[1:24:18] like last week we had sister Danny here
[1:24:21] now she never came back and she's
[1:24:22] actually done at our school sure her her
[1:24:25] contract ran up and so I don't see her
[1:24:27] anymore but when I started talking to
[1:24:29] her what happened I started speaking the
[1:24:30] wisdom of God to her and there's things
[1:24:33] she said she never heard before she
[1:24:34] never heard about the Queen of the South
[1:24:35] judging Jesus generation she never heard
[1:24:38] about the men of Nineveh judging jeeze
[1:24:40] generation she said Maya that's deep
[1:24:41] what was that that's the wisdom of God
[1:24:44] because I said I've got to stand there
[1:24:46] as a witness against my co-workers and
[1:24:48] this and all these communities that
[1:24:49] Halloween's of the devil right I mean we
[1:24:53] love people we appreciate people but if
[1:24:55] they want to come down to look at the
[1:24:56] Word of God we speak the wisdom of God
[1:24:58] in a mystery it just goes over their
[1:25:01] head
[1:25:02] but we speak it because we not only walk
[1:25:04] in it but we speak it we've received
[1:25:07] manifold wisdom of God on how to conduct
[1:25:09] our lives and so we speak the Word of
[1:25:11] God with wisdom it's a mystery it's
[1:25:13] hidden to most people it's hidden and
[1:25:18] that you may know how you ought to
[1:25:20] answer every man so our answers even
[1:25:22] contain wisdom our speech has wisdom and
[1:25:25] we walk in wisdom because we're wise
[1:25:27] virgins that's right now the depth here
[1:25:31] Paul Paul notes the depth of the riches
[1:25:35] of the wisdom and knowledge of God and
[1:25:38] this is I just wrote here is if it's
[1:25:41] very wise of God to pass on mercy to the
[1:25:43] Gentiles after the Jews rejected that's
[1:25:46] what Paul is saying here God was very
[1:25:49] wise to do that the Jews and Gentiles
[1:25:52] were both in unbelief so God could then
[1:25:54] have mercy on all so see before God
[1:25:57] called the Jews all the Gentiles were in
[1:25:59] sin God knew that God knew the Gentiles
[1:26:01] were sinners so God called out Abraham
[1:26:04] and then Isaac Jacob and then then the
[1:26:07] children of Israel Moses and all these
[1:26:09] God caught out of people but then when
[1:26:11] they rejected the Holy Ghost God took it
[1:26:14] back to the Gentiles to have mercy on
[1:26:15] them right and that shows God's wisdom
[1:26:19] he gave both groups now we know there's
[1:26:21] Samaritans to bear with me you
[1:26:23] understand what I'm saying God has given
[1:26:26] every nation every every human group God
[1:26:30] has given everyone a chance and they've
[1:26:31] all failed that's why God could have
[1:26:33] mercy on all of them amen that's wisdom
[1:26:36] I've got to give everybody chance to
[1:26:38] receive it they'll all turn it down but
[1:26:40] because they'll all turn it down I can
[1:26:41] have mercy on all that's God's wisdom
[1:26:44] that's what Paul says the depths of the
[1:26:47] wisdom of God now here's another key
[1:26:51] that you're walking with wisdom I got
[1:26:52] five more minutes to bear with me here
[1:26:54] here's another way you know you're
[1:26:56] walking the wisdom of God because the
[1:26:58] wisdom that descends not from above so
[1:27:01] Satan's intellectual wisdom is earthly
[1:27:05] so it only pertains the things on the
[1:27:07] earth it doesn't pertain to storing up
[1:27:09] treasures in heaven its earthly it's
[1:27:13] sensual it gives you your lusts of your
[1:27:14] flesh
[1:27:15] things you want from your flesh things
[1:27:17] you'd lost your eyes pride of life and
[1:27:20] devilish which would be persecution you
[1:27:23] know the spirit of Satan persecutes the
[1:27:26] true spirit of God so that's how that's
[1:27:28] another way to know is this decision I'm
[1:27:30] making is this wise or not is this
[1:27:33] helping me storm earthly treasures or
[1:27:36] heavenly treasures is this feeding my
[1:27:39] flesh or is it helping to me me be more
[1:27:42] consecrated to Christ right like fasting
[1:27:46] when I asked the church to fast or if I
[1:27:48] asked you to come on Sunday night
[1:27:49] services like I know everybody's tired
[1:27:50] I'm tired on Sunday night
[1:27:52] I know it's hard to fast but what am i
[1:27:56] but if not what do we become we become
[1:27:58] more sensual right we just we're just
[1:28:01] naturally that way we've got to be under
[1:28:03] the leadership of the Holy Spirit with
[1:28:05] the wisdom of God so that we'll stay
[1:28:08] close to God because we've all seen
[1:28:10] people who don't consecrate their lives
[1:28:11] they're more sensual they're more
[1:28:13] earthly they're building an earthly
[1:28:15] Kingdom instead of building heavenly
[1:28:17] treasures and we don't want to be like
[1:28:19] that is every understand we don't want
[1:28:21] to be foolish we want to be wise
[1:28:24] that's foolish virgin type of material
[1:28:26] for where and being in strife is see we
[1:28:28] don't want to envy others we don't have
[1:28:30] arguments and divisions with people
[1:28:32] there's confusion in every evil work and
[1:28:35] thank God God has kept us God has really
[1:28:37] protected our church I'm very thankful
[1:28:38] you know God has really blessed our
[1:28:39] church and we all battle so you know but
[1:28:41] but God has been very gracious to us but
[1:28:44] the wisdom that's from above is first
[1:28:46] not like this pure so see when we're
[1:28:49] making decisions is this something I can
[1:28:51] say with a pure heart I'm choosing this
[1:28:53] to glorify God or is there a little bit
[1:28:55] impurity there see wisdom from God is
[1:28:59] pure it's peaceable brings the peace of
[1:29:01] God it's gentle it's easy to be taught
[1:29:04] or entreated you can easily be taught
[1:29:06] the Word of God when you when the wisdom
[1:29:08] of God is there you can easily be taught
[1:29:10] the wisdom of God full of mercy and good
[1:29:12] fruits without partiality see it's not
[1:29:16] well brother Jesse can get away with
[1:29:18] this but you can't you know it's
[1:29:20] impartial its impartial God's Word is
[1:29:22] true for everybody see and without
[1:29:26] hypocrisy see so we don't say one thing
[1:29:29] do another well I'm gonna fast but I'll
[1:29:31] eat the whole time you know
[1:29:33] alright faster do you know her so you
[1:29:36] understand we're not hypocrites what we
[1:29:38] say we live by the grace of God we're
[1:29:41] trying to be as sincere as we possibly
[1:29:42] can that's wisdom of God I'm trying to
[1:29:49] think if there's anything else I want to
[1:29:50] say on there so that's what we must do
[1:29:52] if we're gonna be though we're gonna
[1:29:54] have all the wisdom of God the manifold
[1:29:55] not look not a little bit of wisdom
[1:29:56] manifold major wisdom God is giving us
[1:30:00] plenty of wisdom we just gotta ask for
[1:30:03] wisdom and that's James chapter one we
[1:30:06] must not doubt when we ask for wisdom
[1:30:07] God you're gonna give me wisdom how to
[1:30:08] handle this there's a situation Church
[1:30:11] nobody knew about it I was praying about
[1:30:13] it on Sunday I had to answer Sunday
[1:30:15] night I knew when I had to answer it I
[1:30:17] was praying for God to give me wisdom I
[1:30:18] just committed in his hands I prayed
[1:30:20] about it and God totally took care of
[1:30:22] the situation it's too personal I can't
[1:30:24] share it but God just blew me away I did
[1:30:27] not expect this answer I ask God give me
[1:30:29] wisdom how to handle this I don't know
[1:30:31] what to do is if I choose this it's
[1:30:33] gonna hurt this person if I choose that
[1:30:34] is gonna hurt that person and God so
[1:30:36] change one person's heart that it
[1:30:38] totally took care of the whole situation
[1:30:39] I said oh thank you Jesus how you
[1:30:41] answered prayer head in other words he
[1:30:44] diffused a potential difficult situation
[1:30:48] I just want to thank the Lord for that
[1:30:49] that we just can't doubt and I was
[1:30:51] battling on his husband to work out I
[1:30:52] just had to cast it on the on the Lord I
[1:30:54] just kept Amen in the word and worship
[1:30:56] it and the problem took care of itself
[1:30:58] I could have lingered on that all day
[1:31:00] trying to pay attention but I got this
[1:31:03] problem and I don't know is God gonna
[1:31:04] give me wisdom or not but God took care
[1:31:06] of it
[1:31:06] I just tried to cast it upon the Lord
[1:31:08] and you know it was involved finances
[1:31:11] and involved families and of all these
[1:31:13] things and God took care of it and no
[1:31:15] there's no problem at all with it by the
[1:31:16] grace of Lord so thank you Jesus thank
[1:31:19] you lord I just thank the Lord for that
[1:31:20] God knows my heart I was really
[1:31:22] concerned about that okay I got 40
[1:31:27] seconds so what can i creech in 40
[1:31:29] seconds no let me just give me two
[1:31:32] minutes let me finish for this well
[1:31:33] close to the thought and this was
[1:31:34] actually the scripture we ended with
[1:31:35] when we read our text I was just kind of
[1:31:37] guessing maybe we'll get that far
[1:31:39] okay so boldness and access let's stand
[1:31:41] on our feet here
[1:31:43] have you stand here visions 3:12 in whom
[1:31:49] so time-out Christ our eternal purposes
[1:31:52] in Christ in whom we have boldness and
[1:31:56] access with confidence by the faith of
[1:31:59] him by the faith of him I don't remember
[1:32:05] when I preached on the book of
[1:32:06] Revelation chapter 1 but chapter 1 says
[1:32:08] we have the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:32:11] that's a deep thought but in other words
[1:32:13] when we're anointed by the Holy Ghost
[1:32:15] and we have great faith in God's Word
[1:32:17] it's not-it's not even our faith its
[1:32:19] Christ's faith he's given us the faith
[1:32:21] so if we take that thought and apply to
[1:32:25] this scripture the only way we can pray
[1:32:27] the right way is when we pray with his
[1:32:29] faith in other words when we pray with
[1:32:31] for God's will that's the only way we
[1:32:34] can have confidence when we pray it's
[1:32:36] the only way we can be bold before God
[1:32:38] it's the only way we could have access
[1:32:40] before God is when we pray with God's
[1:32:42] own faith and I know that that's a
[1:32:44] really deep thought I could preach a
[1:32:45] whole sermon on that we have to look at
[1:32:47] all the prayers for the Bible prayers
[1:32:48] that were answered prayers that were not
[1:32:50] answered and you could see how they pray
[1:32:52] with God's God's will or not okay so
[1:32:56] what is bonus mean church it means
[1:32:58] freedom and speaking unreserve anise in
[1:33:02] speech open frankly without concealment
[1:33:07] so if I had something to tell brother
[1:33:09] Adam I would tell him everything about
[1:33:11] that situation I wouldn't conceal it and
[1:33:13] say well I can't tell Adam this part I
[1:33:15] did that last week I can't tell her on
[1:33:17] that that's not boldness you know if I
[1:33:20] got to repent say I'm sorry brother you
[1:33:21] know forgive me
[1:33:24] the only way I can be bold children is
[1:33:27] if I don't conceal anything I have to
[1:33:29] come clean with everything and that's
[1:33:31] how God wants us to pray not to conceal
[1:33:34] anything so see that's why that song
[1:33:37] says you know you can talk about me as
[1:33:38] much as you please I'll talk about you
[1:33:40] on my knees that's why that's so true
[1:33:42] because we because when we're in our
[1:33:44] prayer clauses alone we can tell God
[1:33:46] everything right this brother did this
[1:33:49] to me Lord Jesus you know and I really
[1:33:51] feel like maybe he did this that but
[1:33:53] Lord you know forgive
[1:33:56] helped me not to have any hard feelings
[1:33:57] again soon you know like when we're in
[1:34:01] our prayer closet with Christ
[1:34:02] nothing's concealed we can just say
[1:34:04] whatever and as long as always listening
[1:34:07] you know through the events you know you
[1:34:09] understand like we should we should just
[1:34:11] pray to God you know and we shouldn't
[1:34:14] pray loud if people are gonna hear us
[1:34:15] you know if we're gonna talk about
[1:34:17] people on our knees we should not pray
[1:34:19] so that people can hear but Aaron is
[1:34:21] there and I'm saying we have that
[1:34:22] boldness with Christ Jesus and a freedom
[1:34:26] I can tell the Lord anything in prayer
[1:34:27] right we can tell Christ anything in
[1:34:30] prayer as long as we say let your will
[1:34:33] be done now my will you were like I pray
[1:34:38] this all the time Lord I want to be a
[1:34:39] full-time pastor but I always got to say
[1:34:40] let your will be done because I want it
[1:34:44] right now I want to make videos more
[1:34:46] teaching videos I want to preach more
[1:34:49] sermons I want to study more things
[1:34:51] that's all I want to do I want to pray
[1:34:53] up and down all day back in I'm gonna
[1:34:55] just go do that all day I'd love to do
[1:34:57] that I do that all summer but it seems
[1:35:01] like God's an answer right now so what
[1:35:03] should i do should I get upset or should
[1:35:05] I just say Lord let your will be done I
[1:35:06] just have to say Lord let your will be
[1:35:08] done it's not my will but I can be so
[1:35:11] honest with him I I won't conceal that
[1:35:13] in prayer say lord I don't know why I'm
[1:35:14] not a full-time pastor yet but I'll wait
[1:35:16] upon your promise and fear let's see
[1:35:20] there's there's no there's no fear
[1:35:21] because perfect love casts out all fear
[1:35:24] well we're praying in the love of God we
[1:35:27] have boldness there's no fear I know
[1:35:29] God's hearing me right I have confidence
[1:35:31] God hears my prayer I've confessed all
[1:35:33] my sins I'm cheerful I'm cheerful one
[1:35:37] time for that I can't preach to us on
[1:35:39] Sunday
[1:35:39] I've got courage I've got blessed
[1:35:41] assurance a boldness when I pray now
[1:35:46] access means I'm moving too I can move
[1:35:48] closer to God never feel like that way
[1:35:51] in prayer
[1:35:52] you start off prayer you feel like real
[1:35:53] far away from God pretty soon you keep
[1:35:55] praying then you feel real close to God
[1:35:57] you didn't you might not even move to
[1:35:59] half inch but it's spiritually I no
[1:36:03] longer have my thoughts my thinking now
[1:36:05] I want the mind of Christ
[1:36:08] I want to pray his will not my I've
[1:36:10] moved now we have access so first we
[1:36:12] have that boldness and access move
[1:36:15] closer to God's we'd say God's heart we
[1:36:17] want God's heart for the situation now
[1:36:23] there's lot of scriptures on that we're
[1:36:24] not gonna read them but there they are
