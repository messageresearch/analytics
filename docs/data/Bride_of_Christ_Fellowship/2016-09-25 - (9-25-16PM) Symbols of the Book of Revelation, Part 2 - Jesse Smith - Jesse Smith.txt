spirit from a piece to the shore by Henry who rose here praise God and up you let's take our Bibles for tonight by God's grace if you will open up to Revelation 13 like to preach on the symbols of the book of Revelation part two tonight want to thank my wife for giving me the lecture time to prepare for the message tonight and I got it I put my email it to the church computer so we have to worry about any Apple TV phailin so brother Maggie's got it on PowerPoint so after we do the text you'll be able to see the slide and so it was gonna be a way around it if one technology fails there's got to be another one thing to make it work revelation 13 and church God knows I've always wondered about the first few verses of Revelation 13 by feel like the Lord of this recently opened up to me as I've studied the message of brother branham more and more and I feel like I know who these beasts are praise God and we're going to look at that here tonight by God's grace revelation 13 1 & 2 is a particular beast and then something changes in verse 3 and we'll be bringing that out here by God's grace in just a moment recently we preached on you know the showdowns that we know Revelation 13 16 is where the prophets said they're brought to be forced to stop preaching but we want to look at the previous verses in that chapter and it's a real blessing I trust you'll be able to understand these symbols how to understand the symbols of God amen Ram says we can understand all the symbols and everything a revelation you've got power over Satan amen because you can recognize Satan and in the world and our lives and overcoming by the power of the Holy Spirit amen revelation 13 verse 14 there say men let's read verses 1 2 & 3 oh sweet him together 1 2 3 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the names of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast what attacks they met I'm never eat I before but don't look at it here tonight let's have one more word of Prayer Heavenly Father we bow our heads to you lord do what only you can do break the word to us bring Revelation Lord God and Lord we know if you do Lord the gates of hell would not prevail against your revelation dear God the counsels of hell to to seek out our lives as to steal from us kill and destroy they will not overcome us but we will have life and life more abundantly in the Holy Ghost thank you for this morning's message in worship thank you for tonight the wonderful song special in the testimony Lord were just more in love with you father speak to us here tonight it Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god I should be in senior so we got it all right now when you when you when you go from platform a platform like we went from the Apple platform to Microsoft sometimes it doesn't turn out right but hopefully it turns out right by God's grace ok brother bank next one here let's look at symbols the book of Revelation this is part 2 like I said we want to look at revelation 13 next one brother so I want to look at the revealed symbols of Revelation 13 how many would say this is new to them they not really studied revelation 13 anybody say they're kind of new to that okay just few of us okay praise the Lord if you have anything could be real blessed by gods grace I think you like I said I didn't even understand this first his first few beasts here I didn't even know that was so a few weeks ago and now the Lord has shown us you know through the message of the prophet and uh trust it'll be a blessing to here tonight to understand this how do you know how many of America's in the book of Revelation 13 I know that amen revelations in there so we want to we definitely want to know where we stand in Scripture Trey Scott so next one brother bang let's go this one I just want to start by saying this revelation 13 1 & 2 is Imperial peg and roll okay so this is before Constantine no Constantine was around 300 AD but before that you know Road ruled the earth right and so revelation 13 1 & 2 is imperil pagan Rome you know such as under Julius II but Caesar before that you know hair it even in the days of Jesus and so forth all the time Rome was ruling up until rock on steam use because Constantine mary church and state how many know that in the third church age he married church and state so revelation 13 1 and 2 is imperial pagan Rome so let's let's look at that the next side brother depend here's the scripture and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up by the earth or out of the sea having seven heads ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like a leopard ok so it's one beast but he's like a leopard his feet are the feet of a bear and his mouth as a mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power he's seen the thorn I don't know who the dragon is Satan's the okay so I don't have it on here but revelation 12 if you read revelation 12 Satan is the dragon that tries to devour the woman and the child right and then also the remnant of the woman's seed which is 144,000 program tells us so Satan tries to devour them but God raises up a standard amen he annoys does to protect his people praise God next one brother it's a little picture here so this will just look at this just for a moment here's a beast coming up out of the sea it's got the seven heads it's got ten horns I think this one has some extra horns there you'll see it's like a leper but it's got feet like a bear it's got heads like a lion sorry this is just one authors you know Photoshop version of it you know the best they could do without drawing it just kind of computer animation and so for like that and of course behind it or where this beast gets his powers role that's the Vatican right and then behind that has Satan you know the dragon he's in charge of Rome and so forth like that so in Revelation 13 1 and 2 here we have Imperial pagan Rome stepping out stepping out of the sea now we're going to go through each of these symbols here by the grace of God and brother branham's quotes will tie this all together so we can understand it by the grace of God so next I brother van so let's focus on the Beast let's focus on the Beast part of this the first symbol will be the Beast part of it alright let's look at this here praise God next one so in the scripture a beast is in kingdom it's a human Kingdom power who family says the Beast is a power I've never heard him say that well the power is actually a kingdom human government power right that's what it actually is neck scripture and this proves are right here scripture proves it so no matter what people say we hobo the Rams just you know they say be program saying things he's not he's actually interpreting the Word of God to us so Daniel 7 23 next one brother thus he said the fourth be shall be the fourth Kingdom don't you love that a beast is a kingdom praise God upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and tread it down and break in pieces praise God now the fourth beast has to be rolled okay the force be fourth beast has to be roll so that's what we're looking at here we're seeing a Roman power rise up out of the sea okay and it has to be the the kingdom of role but it's got other attributes in it that we may have heard before so brother man just pause them right here don't worry about this I want you to turn your Bibles to Daniel 7 let's go to your Bibles to Daniel 7 I've got to lay this in here this is where now you know more Horrors time goes on we're understanding more about the Book of Daniel which is a mysterious book but through the prophet of God through another prophet prophets always interpret other prophets words we're starting I'm sorry to understand a whole lot better praise God so Daniel 7 verse 1 I want you to look at here the division and worry verses one through eight in the first eight verses you see four kingdoms or four beasts if you've ever read lately just so you know first one and the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters Daniel spake and said I saw my vision by night and behold the four winds of the sea strobe upon the Great Sea and four beasts came up from the sea diverse one for another another different one for another so what Daniel sees this vision therefore diverse there four separate beasts but when John saw they're all in one beast how many did you anybody catch that here Daniel sees it and they're separate four separate beasts but when John sees that they're all mixed up into one of your brother have tell us about that isn't just a moment now verse for the first was like a lion and had eagle's wings I be held to the wings were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given on who does that sound familiar the man's heart and the beasts heart that's Nebuchadnezzar remember that one he was given a beast heart praise the Lord so this first beast lion represents Babylon it represents the king of kezer all right we'll show this later my brother branham's quotes you'll see it now notice their diverse they're different and they rise up verse 5 i've always wondered what the lion the bear and the leopard where but now we know by God's grace now we don't burst fun and another and beheld another beast a second like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and they had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said the Sun to arise devour much flesh okay so the second piece the bear is the Medes and Persians the Medes and Persians they came immediately after the Babylonian Kingdom after the Babylonian Kingdom rose up the Medes and Persians fact rated there in Daniels time next piece verse 6 and after this I beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it for wings of a file the Beast had also for heads and Dominion was given unto it hey this is the Grecian kingdom led by Alexander the Great if you know the scripture there we'll get to it also in Daniel chapter 2 now verse 7 is now the Roman kingdom after this I saw the night visions to be held a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron notice that iron teeth this beast has ayran teeth if you know anything about Daniel's vision in Daniel chapter 2 the fourth part of the beast was legs of what iron and then the feet were iron and clay mixed together right so again this shows this fourth piece was a symbol of the Roman Empire it devoured him break in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before and it had ten horns doesn't that sound forbidden from revelation 13 and had seven heads and ten horns amen now go to Daniel chapter 2 Daniel chapter 2 believe it's 31 if i'm not mistaken or 36 this is Daniel gives the interpretation my brother ban can you skip ahead you might have 2x out but can you skip ahead to slide 128 it's got the picture of the image that in King Nebuchadnezzar saw if you can skip ahead of that then we'll read here in Daniel chapter 2 there it is thank you but hey praise God wonderful now if you haven't seen this before this is what Nebuchadnezzar dream remember and his men could have figured out and daniel said just give me some time give me some time alone with the Lord and the gift will start working praise God that's how every gift works right spend time with the Lord the gift of God will go to work in your life whether it's tongues interpretation prophecy whatever it is give God some time I'm really sorry this is small but i can email to everybody the Babylonian Empire was the head of gold that was Nebuchadnezzar Daniel tells this the Nebuchadnezzar is the state the word of God the chest hair breasts of silver was the Medes and Persians ok there's the bear so there's the lion bear okay the thighs here was the Grecian Empire Alexander the Great from 3 30 12 146 BC I forgot to read the years up here so here's the years of Nebuchadnezzar and King Darius now once you get down to the legs of iron you get into the Imperial pagan Roman Empire that's before the Holy Roman Empire knots not wholly just they call it holy all right it's not holding but down here at the feet you have Catholicism and Protestants a Protestantism iron represents Catholicism because they're iron they won't Bend and they go into all the world and then convert everybody as proselytes right so that's what program teaches us the iron and clay mixed together now keep that up there brother bang now if you would Daniel 236 here's where Daniel gets thus saith the lord and he gives it to King Nebuchadnezzar no does that start to make sense a little bit by God's grace in Daniel 7 he saw the east for diverse from each other they were separate from each other but John sees that revelation 13 and they're all combined into what beasts praise the Lord all right you might be thinking why they combined brother man tells us it's very very simple but let's just hold on this to Daniel 236 this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation they're up for our they're up before the king the owl King aren't a king of kings for the God of heaven have given the Aquino power and strength to glory and where's over the children of men well the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into that hand and have made thou the ruler over up them all thou art this head of gold so in church isn't it now said the Lord from a profit Babylon is the head of gold can really see that by God's grace he said you came through the king of the babla you're the head of gold he's the lion that was talking about right there he's the line that was talked about all right now next one verse 39 and after these shall rise another Kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of grass which shall bear rule over all the earth brass again what is the Grecian Empire but one that was lesser was the needs and Persians and history backs us up as well versed for nelligan verse 40 remember what we read in Daniel 7 and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as what iron and we just read that that horned beast here strong as iron now it says I'm sorry missed my part for as much as iron breaketh and pieces and subdue with all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall break in pieces and brews and whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of strength of the iron for as much as thou saws the iron mixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron apart or clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men you only know brother Graham said that was he said that was Catholics intermarrying with Protestants now I can show you the quotes if you want to see them they shall mingle themselves so the iron was trying to mingle right with the Protestants that's why if a Catholic marries a loser who who could hook it hurts the loser right I see that's happened to my family right Luther American Catholic Lutheran converts to Catholicism because they mean Oh their seat brother branham said but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay okay so look at today are the Catholics and Protestants mingling together not really right but they will become united at the end time right we know that but they're not mixed fully they're not they're still separate numbers 44 here's where we look here's where I look forward to this is Armageddon in the days of these Kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed amen no ending that can only be Christ's millennial reign right and then the same rain that goes into the future home and the kingdom shall be I'm sorry shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever amen for as much as I saw that the stone was cut off the mountain with hands without hands but let it break in pieces the IRA at the brass and the clay the silver and the gold the Great God have made known to the king why shall come to pass her after and the dream discern and the interpretation thereof sure praise the Lord remember brother random dramatized when Christ went down into paradise after he was crucified he said he dramatized each of the Saints looking out and saying what what what they saw Jesus like Ezekiel Johnson hey there's the wheel in the middle of the wheel remember that and he said Daniel looked out they said there's the stone that was cut out of the mountain today man so Daniel saw Christ come back and Armageddon and he went down the Bible said he went out and struck that image at the feet and where was the feet the feet was Roman Roman aslam and cooks are catholicism protestantism that's what christ is going to smash when he comes back at Armageddon everybody with me by God's grace amen hope hope you are by God's grace uh I think you'll get it here by the grace of the Lord now you see this here now let's go brother bang if we can let's head back back up a little bit let's go up to 112 now 112 you don't know how he did that he did pretty good all right so we got the first symbol okay so the first symbol in Revelation 13 I was imperial pagan Rome coming up out of the sea that was the legs of brass those legs of brass that's what it was that was manifesting so this is the legs of rafts coming up this is impaired of paying your own coming upon the earth now you wonder why does have the other beast in it hopefully we'll get to that soon brother branwell taos exactly right but let's first look at the see why is it coming out to see next one brother bang seer waters represents multitudes of people so when you read the Bible you have to understand if it's a vision from a prophet sees represent many many people brother may next one here's where it says it and he said unto me the waters which style sauce where the hopes sitteth are people's and multitudes and nations and tongues amen so that pagan Rome Imperial pagan government came out of many many people right it was a worldwide rain all roads led to Rome let me know that on time to go on the history I don't even have it in front of me to do that but that's how it was all roads lead to Rome they rule the horse look at the time of Jesus you know they try to control everything that's the spirit of rome next my brother man so this piece that came out revelation 13 12 is pagan Rome's kingdom with combined demon powers of the first three Gentile kingdoms all right now brother man can you go down to verse herbs I'm sorry to slide 122 let's see where the prophet said that then we'll head back up here's where broadband says this so you understand it now in Daniel 7 there's four separate ones right and now in John observe Revelation 13 John sees them all combined okay next one here's the prophets revelation listen to it its mark of the beast 1954 amen Church he was always a profit even before the seals on NVIDIA he's always a profit and he had revelations from God amen he spoke thus saith the Lord now we got two things under consideration i watch this beast it has four different characters in it the one we just saw if you'll take daniel 7 you who are marketed down to no.7 Daniel saw the same vision 800 years before this all the vision he saw those beasts separate from one another in the beginning of the Gentile ruling alright next one all right here's where I opened up to meet your dope won't go catch you right here and here they are John sing it and the end of the Gentile really so John sing the end of that Gentile statute are you seeing the legs of the feet all four of those beasts represented in one beast now here's where it is them save old Devils demons that possessed each kingdom of the Romans down through in the Greeks and so forth down to the Gentile dispensation has come right down and all met up in one beast and you say amen to that so before when Daniel sought a hundred years before the four beasts were separate but after each kingdom went out after Babylonian Kingdom went out those same demons came into the Medes and Persians Kingdom and then when Alexander came in the same demons that were there in the and the beads of Persians came into the Grecian Kingdom amen and then with the creation kingdom without the same old Devils came in the Roman kingdom are you with me Lori that beautiful and then open up the Bible to you I daniya always wondered what was the leper but Mr bear all these things well God has revealed it through a profit a man there it is now we can see it by God's grace beautiful now probably I go back up to 116 if you can I really appreciate your help but really I'm just kind of trying to follow follow the leading of the Lord here now what are the seven heads represent the seven heads are seven mountains of ancient Rome because even ancient Rome was still build on that's in fact where that's in fact where the Seven Hills actually are in the old city of ancient Rome the old part of a chiral not the current Vatican location but they call it ancient Rome now that's the next one by the bank revelation 17 9 here's the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads of the set melons on which the woman sitteth praise the Lord next one by the bank one of the ten horns the Bible tells us there are 10 earthly kings now these are still future but wait Daniel and both John thought they had ten horns to show that at one time this kingdom is going to have the power of ten Kings upon the earth right now we might call them dictators we've not calm other things around the world but there's going to be ten kings or dictators upon this earth that give their power unto the Roman Catholic Church that's right that's the scripture next one brother may at least in 1712 and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as of yet but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast it was the Beast there's spirit of Rome in that hour so they're going to rip these ten Kings around the world are going to receive powder with the Roman Catholic Church for only one hour remember that our they get destroyed it doesn't last very long these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the peace so the Catholic Church is going to add backing from all the kingdoms right and backings from all 10 of these Kings he's going to have all that there she's going to have all that power okay next one brother baby verse 16 and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the Beast these shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire neck scripture for God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will to agree and give their Kingdom unto the Beast until the words of God should be fulfilled so they're going to have a love-hate relationship with this with this woman they're going to love her for an hour give her a power but after that they're gonna are going to hate her the Bible says right all right my brother bang if you can skip down to berk 126 slide 1 26 now if you got your Bibles revelation 13 3 to 10 is the current holy Roly hold up holy roman empire now holy rollers a holy roman empire pardon me my revelation 13 verse 3 now I'm going to leave it brother bang we're just leave it there for a little bit here I'm going to read some quotes from and talked about this in the church change book okay now verse 3 revelation 13 3 now what happened to verse 3 memory read this and I saw one of the heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast alright let me read my brother man told about this here on the church age book just a moment here all right now he's talking about the third church age so this scripture Revelation 13 3 happened during the third church age you looked like it looked like this beast that rose up was killed but then it got healed so it didn't he never died it got healed I wrote down says this he said in right in this age of the Pergamum program only in church age he says when the Beast of Revelation 13 3 that was wounded to death the pagan Roman Empire came back to life and power as the holy roman empire so papal rome lost some of its power but that life that evil Antichrist spirit got life again through working and marrying to the catholic church all right that's what ba-bam says it was married he says it actually says this not only was this day in church wet in this age but the babylonian religion was officially joined to the first church say you now have access to the name of Christ and he was enthroned as God and worship and with the help of federal a the churches fell heir to beautiful buildings which were lined with altars of white marble and images of the departed Saints honey know the history of Constantine that happened when Constantine was ruling memory had a dream and he saw he saw a cross so he said if you if you paint this cross on the shelves of your men do get victory and so he did that the next morning he painted it and he got the victory they rename the city constant oh boy named it after himself there but after that he he married church and state and then as program says through history they took those pagan temples and they just changed the names of the gods to Christian names that's all they did and they married church and state now what's a sad thing is that most inama nations rejoice over Constantine today because Constantine made christianity the official religion and they stop persecuting them and for example some family members of our church that used to be Baptist sent us some books about church history and the books recover all church history from the time of Christ till now and the book about Constantine they rejoice they celebrate Constantine because Christians were no longer persecuted and so there to see than they think oh that was a good thing now don't get me wrong it's a good thing of Christians ought to be persecuted but it's a bad thing to marry paganism with Christianity praise God so that's how to see most denominations are today they think oh that's a good thing he saw a cross and brother Graham said he wasn't converted just as much as a great can be converted or something like that he said he wasn't convert he wasn't even a real Christian he was just following the dream and he never got baptized everly got saved and see what the Holy Ghost so he was a man that was still a worldly man and he just united church and state all right now here's brother Brandon describing chapter 13 verse 3 Rome as a material nation had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer completely but it mattered not now for her religious Empire would keep her on top of the world governing from the inside where she would not appear to be doing soap from the outside now to prove this brother man goes back to Daniel too but we already read that right that's what I want to read that earlier to prove this boat man said let me show you the exact script truth of this and he goes back to Daniel to 31 to 45 which we already read and he proves it there and it reads it lists all those scriptures in the church age book now he says this here it has revealed an exact account of future unfilled history that was prophesied to come upon the earth from the time of Daniel until Jesus would come and reign as a son of David this is known as the times of the Gentiles well then can you go back to that slow i D let me give you the number here so everybody conceding in 128 so it's two more slides thank you now look at this while you listen to what brother branham said programs and this is the times of the Gentiles so when Daniel here started it you know he was prophesied this is the time the Gentiles would rule the earth right in Christ of course he smashes it here at Armageddon then no longer our Gentiles ruling then Christ is ruling at that point amen but Bob answer this is the times of the Gentiles it had within it for historical divisions which were known by the dominating empire in each division Babylonian means and Persians Grecian Roman the greatest and most absolute monarchy was babbling which was typify daz ahead of gold the next thing glory was the Medes and Persians which has history barat was truly less glorious and was typify daz the breasts and arms of silver then their father Grecian age whose king was the most period of all military leaders the world has ever known so it was fittingly type typify daz the belly and thighs of brass finally came the last kingdom which was the Roman Empire typify daz the legs and feet but where the former kingdoms were simplified as pure materials this last Empire was pure iron only in the legs for when it came to defeat it was a mixture of iron and clay amen and he said now be not only is this so but most amazing this last Roman Empire he said would last right up until Jesus returns praise God that's why brother BAM can say how can rush or rule he said Russia's not going to rule he said Rome's going to rule thus saith the Lord how do we know that what's he basing about he's basing it on Daniels vision and the interpretation Russia is not going to rule Rome was going to rule but how does Rome ruling out through the church right and she rules now even through the United States is where this beast advances to as we'll see in just a few moments here alright oh brother have said since the Roman Empire iron signifying power great destructive force against opposition was to be made of two main opposition's east and west so see this is roland empire east and west both of them very powerful crushing all before them he said but as the glory and power of all empires fail so this Empire began to fall off so thus Rome fell in peril pagan Rome was no longer iron she crumbled she was wounded to death Rome could not not rule it was all over so thought the world see that stuff thought the world but how wrong the world was for that Headroom the wounded was not wounded unto death revelation 13 three people look at Rome they look at the nation of Italy and as they look they do not realize that Rome with her strict confines where the Pope as an actual area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation and she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors papo Falls Christian Rome now controls by religion even more aptly than when pagan Imperial Rome controlled by pure iron of force amen he said Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined church mistake and back the Union by force the spirit that motivated pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivates false Christian Rome you can see that is so because you now know that the fourth Empire never went out of existence it just changed its outer texture how many can say amen to that so prophet just interpreted for us this is East and West Roman Empire but now down here is their Holy One holy roman empire i'll say like that that's true all right now this one has to exist remember until the time when Jesus returns after the tribulation this Gentile kingdom will rule that loan ok Bango the next slide 129 there it warned now next one verses 11 to 18 is the power of the Holy Roman Empire United States how many we're aware that a men's let's go there revelation 3 i'm sorry 13 11 13 11 all right revelation 13 11 now remember what did John see John and verse 12 John's Ontario pegatron rising up out of the sea right he saw rising up and it had all the heck of a demon spirits of the first three previous kingdoms the Babylonian Kingdom head of the demons of that one demons of the Medes and Persians and the demons of the Grecian walk uniting in this power now it's the Roman power pagan Rome but in verse 3 imperil pagan Rome dies so don't robot the Romans any more naturally our government elite but now the Roman Catholic Church pagan papal rome now rules the world by her religion or deception alright and then she rules from her street on the verse 10 now we pick it up at verse 11 I got this this is from again brother man preaching on this in 1954 the mark of the beast if you want to look at it a wonderful message here all right now verse 11 and I beheld beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first piece before and causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed so this beast causes everybody to worship the Beast the earlier beast how is it because it's the same demon spirit right it's the same demon power as we said here is the power of the Holy remanent Roman Empire through the United States how did the Roman Empire get the United States they elected chafe cable around said they elected the wrong guy right through popular vote of women he said when women of course we got the remote avoiding three years but now they back side and through the popular vote of women they erected the law or elected the wrong man amen and now Roman Empire now has a leader here in the United States that's right now verse 13 and he do with great wonder so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by means of those miracles which he had power to do in the side of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did lives there so the United States somehow is going to have some part in this image under the Beast I know with the images over after the image is the World Council of Churches remember that the image under the Beast of em of the Beast is invisible demon spear by the spirit of Rome but they need an image for the beach so that image of the beast is the Royal counts of churches program said they don't mean to do if I at one point though unite with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope will be head of it all human though they did not envision it that way that's right all right now brother bang I don't have the quotes was just stay right here but madam said this is mark of the beast 1954 this United States is rotten to the core he says he says will redound here in Revelation the fifteenth verse they said I want to go back to 11th okay now brother BAM the eleventh verse and I beheld another beast coming up on the earth a problem says out of the earth that the thickness and multitudes of people's water then this is where there was no people the United States praise God so in verse 11 that earth right there is North America or United States can you say amen to that Lauren this beast did not come up out of the water like Imperial pagan Rome this feast or the spirit of Rome came up on the United States the earth that earth program said is united states now look and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as it dragged him listen what his brother Adam call the two horns I don't know what he calls it he said what is it it's our American Buffalo did you know that this lens like a lamb right that's a description says but I said it wasn't a lamp it was like a layer I program said like a lamb beans just like freedom of religion he says that's what he says sure then there's two horns like a lamb but what did he do he had freedom of religion first he acted like a leaner but he spoke he said he would snow goggle haven't remember he never did become an old ram he was the lamb this country is only a hundred and fifty years old you know just a lamb so human road app says a lamb represents a young country so the Edit so the spirit of Rome rises up in the earth rises up by the united states are with me looks like a lamb looks like freedom of religion but it speaks like a dragon it speaks like Satan with the power Satan that's right because Satan is a dragon all right now um you have to turn there stare at their mother magnate you can how many know that on May thirteenth of this year I know what had happened I'm a 13-2 this may thirteen this year anybody know what President Obama did he made the Buffalo was selected as the official map of the United States haha it's on history channel you can look it up it's all over the news brother Sonny sends me back in may I come up to say this for a future sermon sometimes glory here's what it says this is on the news article on Monday President Barack Obama signed off on the national bison legacy app you can look it up it's on the White House's website a new law making the American bison the first national mammal of the United States on ouya the Bill of the result of a lobbying effort from conservationists the files a long history that saw the Bison here we go extinct in the 19th century I said the Bison often called the buffalo has appeared on everything from a famous us nickel to Tuesday flags the seal the Department of Interior and even the logos of many sport teams but now the Buffalo joins the bald eagle as one of only two animals officially recognized by the United States government Lori amen hallelujah it was signed by President Obama on May night and describes the Bison as in a historically historical symbol of the United States and animal integrally linked with economic and spiritual lives of many Indian tribes in 1954 brother random said that land that Eric's are the animal I came up like a lamb was a buffalo and the earth was the United States hallelujah there wasn't many people remember said it wasn't waters it was the Roman Catholic Church now moving in the United States so this is the beast out of land it's the Roman Catholic Church the spirit of the Antichrist spirit of Rome in the United States rising above the United States and then acting like a lay I'm all kind but then speaking like a dragon praise the Lord honey love the Lord tonight as a young way us out of old ram it's not a whole nation its young nation praise the Lord now verse 12 again and he exercised all the power of the first beast before and caused the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed so America is going to cause the world to worship the first beast which is that Roman spirit praise God's make it really obvious the Roman Empire right America is going to cause everybody to worship this Roman spirit that's right rotor have said this as well now let's go to verse 13 because brother I've always wonder about this man brother try to explain what it meant fire come down from heaven anybody know what it means levan told us and all right and he do with great wonder so that he maketh the fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men how the United States make fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men my wife's grandfather sought and he or she might but M says what is it he said the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb smart intelligent nation and so forth deceiving the nation by these things praise God is that what the time about was it blew up in the air right it looked like fire right light and fire spread out and disintegrated whole bodies and peoples and buildings and all kinds of things who did that the Beast that come up on the earth praise the Lord church were living in Bible days amen Bible days this is the United States in Scripture as chapter 13 and you guys say started with how many colonies 13 colonies right amen praise the Lord program says next this United States will come to a time that church and state will unite together aren't we almost there can't you almost see that that church and state is almost united together my look at all the violence happening you know with cops and all these things like that it's only a matter of time so goes on into religion they've already had a few Catholic nuns and priests killed by a no terrorists and sober like that it's only a matter of time that this country will unite church and state might be the wrong Church is uniting it'll be it'll be a bad thing it would be a deceptive thing not a good thing it'll be a bad thing we must only unite to the word church we're not trying to unite with governments we're trying to unite to Christ Jesus and we can't say we have been told we've been told amen we've been told all right now brother bang next slide here let's go next wonder all right here's where he says again like the angel told John I'll show you this judgment that's coming to the great church now watch now this is speaking of revelation 17 so it carry me away in the spirit of Lourdes and I saw a woman setting upon a scarlet coloured Beast scarlet the bottom represents royal the colour scarlet means red and beast represents power next slide did you notice the bees that come about a seed that was in the revelation the 13th and when you see the beast coming up out of Assiut met that this power was raising up among the people but in Revelation 13 when this lamb came up he came up on the earth no people united states praise God so everybody see that by God's grace earth in Revelation 13 11 represents the United States and this beast this Roman spirit rises up where there's not many people just Native Americans right he rises up out of here all right now the out of the earth which is United States next one and then after that he had two little horns look the horns represent something so the symbols even have a representation so it's a buffalo rifle guess it's a buffalo a young muffled up garden which is that comes the country's mammal official mammal his two horns represent civil and ecclesiastical powers there's the marriage of church and state are you with me and then he received power and spoke like the dragon in perform so you just got to mark it down so these these horns represent symbol and ecclesiastical powers and state powers he said mark it down were coming into religious persecution with the same things they didn't pagan Rome many years ago for its what they'll say the Lord I'm not giving you my ideas I'm not giving you brother Rams ideas I'm giving you those save the Lord we ought to rejoice I knew you amen this is thus said the Lord hallelujah the earth is the North America United States Rome rises up looks like a little lamb but it's actually a buffalo it's got two horns church and state it's going to unite those powers and they're bringing a persecution it's thus saith the Lord how is up the message of the hour Oh hallelujah enjoy this tonight I'm trying to finish up here I'm trying to keep my sermons a little shorter I did it for a while pretty good i'm getting over now I'm over I more than 50 minutes here so let me try to get down in these quotes here all right next oh brother man this is 1963 remember this is where he lists the five operations of the third pole if you ever heard that one of them's Hattie right you know mr shipp speaking of that storm that snowstorm squirrels oh and his wife's tumor there we go there's all five amen he said that's the third pole and operation notice not one of them was done to the church service because the third pole goes home with you I like that kid amen there's come at a time in this nation to wear this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before which was pagan Rome when it became bathroom see that nation will do that next slide rotation 13 plainly explains this something brother BAM taught his whole ministry but lamb come about the earth the other piece come out by the water thickness of multitudes of people this lamb come where there were no people and Al and represents religion the Lamb of God remember it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb now verse next five remain and then after a while if received power and spoke like a dragon and exercise all the dragon power the dragon had performed the dragon is roll along how Satan in Rome get that Satan Satan is a dragon that's revelation 12 we can prove that but is saved in and roll he says so don't you see Roman denomination a mark Protestant denomination an image under the Beast making a power that will force all Protestants like a union you have to be in this council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship he says amen next slide now we already went over this one is like a lamb the man is a bison buffalo next slide there's a link to it if you want to see the article it's right on history channel calm it means around the wet the White House's website is going to look on there this actually happened to bisect or the bison was recognized as the official mammal next slide by the way if you want to read it that again i can sell you the quotes there right here I can read I didn't have time to put on the slideshow which sprint another time next slide now let's go to verse 16 them remember verse 15 they're going to start killing people the United States is going to start killing people robinsons religious persecution religious persecution the state the Lord is coming to America and only the Holy Ghost will keep us ready and prepare ssin and help us to escape by God's grace verse 16 now revelation oh yeah right you're right there with a revelation 13 16 is the squeeze right followed by the laying down of the mark of the beast next slide brother bang thank you remember I just rather stay a few weeks ago I believe a corner revelation 13 16 that the bride wife to stop preaching does the squeeze for the Beast is demanding the mark in the right hand or forehead a permission to be preached be granted denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching then the land will come first bride and judge the great harlot amen remember he said I never rode this he said he wrote it so I'm taking brother ran him at his word I just believe that because that's what he said next time this be has the same number of heads and horns as the Scarlet beast of revelation 17 3 s let's turn your Bibles weekend revelation 17 remember who is revelation 17 it's Mystery Babylon right the woman who rides the Beast this is the same beast just start a colored now revelation 17 3 so he carried me away in the spirit into the lunas and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of the names of blasphemy member names of last a chapter 13 the name of lasting doubts names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns praise God now got your Bibles I'm gonna close this let's go back to Revelation 13 back there to verse 17 I'm sorry verse 16 let's read this relation 13 16 again I didn't read all that so now you see that same beast that was in Revelation 13 is the same be sets of revelation 17 which was the same beast i was in Daniel 7 amen that's how I was telling brother Austin those brothers you know the you have to interpret the Bible by the Bible right we don't do with go to any other book the Bible interprets itself and we can know thus saith the Lord we can know what the leopard is we can know the Bears we can know what the beast is where you know who the woman is we can know who everybody is praise God because the Bible interprets itself it just needs a prophet to bring the light to us amen now verse 16 I'm closing and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or their forehead so remember that scripture brother Graham said they have to stop the bride from preaching and then Christ has got to come and get his wife before they kill anybody or before the bride is killed of course verse 16 I'm sure I just read that verse 17 and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the number of the beast or the number of his name to look into or you ever see that or so he can deceive in many ways he can deceive uh mark or the name so somebody just trust in the name right it's a are you can either take the mark or the name or the number of his name what's the number of thing but Karis filling day it means a God's vicar that's what it means that I did the Google translation if you go to Google translation if you type in mccarren spill a day that's what it means the vicar I think it's victor of God's if they're not mistaken so if you just trusted the name of the Pope that's why you watch the Pope brother Madison watched a purple curtain yes he said von scheele Russia he's these things but later he says watch the purple curtain he said that's your enemy that's what you got to fight his man-made denominations and religion amen glory so don't we don't confess in the mark which is number the well the mark is later on a verse 18 or we don't confess the name of the beast or the number of his name all right role in the Holy Roman Catholic Church and all that nonsense and things like that I'm not bashing them like a priest a son and I'm not name calling I'm just saying I'm talk about the spirit behind it to bring with me the spear behind it remember brother man had his complexes any name called Ricky Turkish I'm not I'm not name calling the people I'm just saying that's the system all right now verse 18 here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for his number of a man and his number is 603 score and six that's the number 666 which that's where we get if you take the vicarious be like day into the Roman numerals on then you get 666 alright alright last thing i want to say here um let's see let's go to Revelation 18 relation 18 for relation 18 4 and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues for sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double quarter her works in the cup of have failed sort of filled fill to her double yeah we should have filled filled to her double how much she have glorified herself and lived deliciously see church guy live a humble life the spirit of the Roman Catholic churches to live a real relaxed rich kind of life that's why we'd all riches we want spiritual riches not natural juice remember there's one great gain in Christianity where remember that great gate is its godliness with contentment Paul said his great game are you content tonight with the things you have are you living a godly life if you can you can achieve great things in Christ if you live godly and I'll content with things that you have not covetous or greedy or gain for other things like that so much torment and sorrow give her for she say that her heart I sit a queen and no Widow and shall see no sorrow crazy a let's stay in our feet to that by God's grace you see that voice in verse 4 saying come out of her my people see that voice program said that was the voice of the seventh angel come out of her my people as you be not partakers of her sins and plagues and receive not of her plagues that's why we said that on this tight and right with last Sunday night serving about name column we don't name-call got to a brother man don't call then Ricky Ricky and ricotta because I've got children in those systems praise the Lord so we're not to call names we're not to to meet everybody God knows the names the names are written in heaven praise the Lord he knows everything we don't know it so we shouldn't name call praise the Lord and so we see we've got to come out of any denominational spear even amongst us as we preach this morning how many want the real freedom of the Holy Ghost in the church us my greatest Azhar I prayed and wept and cried on Wednesday night for more that I was praying for this church that God would send us the real holy ghost we know what no impersonation we want the real thing praise God amen and so we can have it we just got to keep walking on with God amen loving God being sanctified living the right kind of a life and God can visit us but we've got to come out of any any form any connection to traditional worship of creeds and men and we got to have a real sincere in our hearts amen how many one that real sincere let's pray together if we care by God's grace father thank you for this word of God tonight Lord I'll tell you Lord adjust I want to thank you publicly or what I was so grateful when you reveal this to me I never understood the leopard in Daniel 7 the bear I never understood the lion and hear your profit back in 1954 gets under inspiration speaks it or now we can place more of the Bible together or them so I just want to say I'm so happy about that Lord i'm so happy that i can read the words of a prophet and it helps me to understand my Bible more and Lord none of that but I can see where we are in prophecy in this age even more so to your God right this time where this beast is in America and it's going to force a religious persecution against the real Christian they're going to force the bride to stop preaching the Word of God Lord may we enjoy it while we have it it may be in our lifetime or they'll stop it it may not be it might be the next generation of following help us to enjoy it while we have it to make ready of people prepared for the Lord to turn grand of Jesus as your prophet said may your people humble themselves and pray and call upon God and their people will be healed your Lord so we pray that tonight what we call upon you Jesus and we ask you Lord to be with us Lord we've come out of the actual building now help us to come out of any trees and our harder writing traditions in our hearts Lord any any starchy denominational kind of worship and let us be sincere Lord for the depths of our soul or you see that outside and cried for sins in our church in Akron and I'll keep praying I'll keep believing I'll keep asking Lord that you said the real Holy Ghost here in Akron Ohio Lord God we've had blessings we've had anointings and so forth but nor we want everyone
