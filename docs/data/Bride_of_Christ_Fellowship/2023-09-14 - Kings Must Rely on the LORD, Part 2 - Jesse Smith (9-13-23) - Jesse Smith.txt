========================================

all right thank you praise God praise God 2 Chronicles 16:7 then we'll read Hebrews 10:35 thank you casa great job already on the computer right on top of everything thank you so last time we looked at uh King abijah and how King abijah relied upon the Lord and God honored him for relying on God rather than relying on man but here's a verse where um a king did not rely on God so it just kind of gives us the contrast and we want to learn uh we want to learn of course from abijah but I just want you to see here this verse here verse 7even I'll read this one but then we'll all read Hebrews 10:35 together at that time hananiah the Seer came to ASA king of Judah and said unto him because thou has relied on the king of Syria and not relied on the Lord thy God therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand so we see the king loses uh a battle because he did not rely on the Lord all right now let's read Hebrews uh 10:35 Hebrews 10:35 just a wonderful scripture reminds us to keep our confidence in God that's what relying means relying means to have full trust and confidence in something or someone and so we want our full trust and confidence to be in the Lord Jesus Christ let's read this together ready 1 2 3 cast not away therefore your confidence which ha great recompense of reward may God add his Blessing to re his word you may be seated praise God okay so I don't have any uh well I guess you know I guess yeah we can hook up and have this kind of ready to go actually you know what let's not let's hold off on that I got a few things I'll show just a few visuals eventually but let's get let's go to the scripture here uh by the grace of the Lord now just in a review remember last time we looked at Kings rely on the Lord and we showed the New Testament scriptures how we are Kings and Priests unto God what do we Reign Over we re over sin we re over the sin that dwells within us and we re over the evil spirits the spiritual wickedness in high places that try to tempt us right to do evil we Reign Over that the Bible said by casting down uh evil imaginations right so when Satan comes and he brings a Temptation we've got to uh think about that and we've got to cast that down and say I'm not going to dwell on that I'm not going to accept that thought right what I'm going to do is I'm going to put my trust and put my thoughts on the word of God Goden Hallelujah so that makes you a king when you and and I say a queen for our sisters if that makes you feel uh better um when you cast down evil thoughts and evil ideas from the enemy and you're able to to reject those and accept the word of God you're now ruling over evil spirits and we know the Bible teaches that plainly uh by God's grace good to see you Brother Marlin God bless you sir and that teaches you know uh it goes along with the Bible where Revelation 1 vers vers six says we are Kings and Priests unto God so in the Old Testament they were Kings naturally right God wanted to establish uh uh you know all the kings of Israel you know Saul David and Solomon all the way down God wanted to establish natural Kings but now in the New Testament God's not uh trying to establish natural Kings although he would like Godly leaders um but God wants us to be spiritual Kings and Reign Over sin and the wicked one Hallelujah and then the Bible says we're priests unto God uh again in Revelation 1:6 and we do that according to Romans 12 by presenting our bodies a Living Sacrifice that's why we've got to come to church that's why we've got to pray at home that's why we got to read our Bibles at home you actually have to present your body as a sacrifice right you have to choose to not do something that would be more easy or more pleasurable uh by denying pleasurable things and coming to church and so forth uh by God's grace we make our bodies a Living Sacrifice unto God hallelujah like I said on Sunday I've never seen it fail I've never regretted once coming to church because the spirit of God is here hallelujah it gives us strength and joy and victory and repentance and healing whatever we have need of that's what the Holy Spirit does it gives us what we have need of in that hour praise God and we also as priests you know we first got to take our bodies Away From Evil things and then the Bible said we got to to give God thanks and we got to offer spiritual sacrifices onto go unto God it's so important to sing to God to to say praise the Lord to say thank you Jesus it's so important that's part of our role as a spiritual priest unto God and also pray for other people intercede for other people in other words uh just don't pray for yourself all the time right that's the Habit bad habit we get into me me me me me but that that's not really a sacrifice a sacrifice is praying for other people praise God Amen and that's what God wants us to do intercede for others Hallelujah and so we saw that and then we saw um how you know rabom and Jobo uh rabom would serve God but then you know would fall away uh but then how God kept them you know because rabom sought God God kept them from a civil war right and then we ended with King abijah uh there was 800,000 of his fellow Israelis uh fighting against him but because he relied upon the Lord the Lord slew 500,000 of them all because he called out to God in his dark moments right amen Church we've all had dark moments praise God right and so uh if we haven't been faithful in those dark moments let's let's decide in our hearts tonight the next difficult time we have the next dark moment we have we're going to cry out to God in that moment amen rather than cry out to another person or or you know indulge in some sin or something like that or try to drown away our our our trials you know with some other thing but to call on God and give God an opportunity to save us amen give God an opportun opportunity to help us hallelujah amen that's what abijah did and so God honored him because he relied upon the Lord though surrounded by a an army twice the size of his army Hallelujah God honored him abide of course being Solomon's grandson now as I said last time I didn't get a chance you know to finish a few of these Bible kings I wanted to preach on because remember we can look at their lives and we can learn from their lives we can learn spiritual lessons from their lives amen they were physical Kings uh but we're spiritual Kings and so we can gain understanding Hallelujah and so we want to learn from that by the grace of God and you know while I Was preparing I just thought of a few simple examples of how Believers relied upon uh other things other than God but yet God was merciful to them right Abraham and Sarah relied on their own understanding of how can we have a son they you know they said well Abraham you marry Hagar that will produce the promised child well he wasn't the promised child right he he was a wild man the Bible said that he only caused trouble and they still to this day his descendants still cause trouble to Israel Israelis today they're the ones persecuting Israel um but but God forgave them right and God gave Abraham another chance hallelujah amen and God helped Abraham and Sarah to believe the word of God to rely on God even when he was 99 and she was 90 right right God helped them learn to rely on him because they were the friends of God and remember they were the friends of God because they trained the Bible said Abraham trained his household to obey the word of God and fulfill the word of God that's why it's so important train your children right train yourself right train your spouse and however however more uh train your household to honor the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah and God will be your friend that's what the Bible says we're the friends of God because we're the the the spiritual descendants of Abraham because we have faith in Jesus Christ amen I thought of you know King numerous times you know he relied so much on himself he relied on his own timing remember he sacrificed right before Samuel got there only prophets were supposed to make that sacrifice but he intruded into the prophet's office and missed the timing of God therefore God said I'm taking the kingdom away from you because you didn't rely on me you didn't rely on my timing you didn't think I could I could make this happen in a certain time and he intruded into the office of a prophet and then remember at the end of his life he went to a witch the Bible said he went to the witch of Endor the equivalent today would be like doing the horoscope or going to the Ouija board some evil thing like that trying to figure out your future try to gain some uh some favor by going to demonic Powers rather than God right and the Bible said he didn't you know he didn't rely on the uraman Thum that breastplate where the high priest would take it before God and and ask God a question and if it was God it would Shine the lights would shine right and they'd know yes or no is this from God or not but he didn't rely upon God he relied upon a witch and the Bible said God killed him prematurely because of that and the Bible says in the New Testament many are SI sick and weakly among you and many sleep because they do not discern the body of the Lord that that means they mistreat other Christians and so the Bible tells us plain in the New Testament God will cause Christians to go to a premature death because they don't treat other Christians the right way God help us to be full of compassion praise God full of mercy and for forgive one another as we need forgiven who doesn't need forgiven today is there anybody that made it through the day without a sin no we all need forgiveness so Jesus says you know forgive us our debts as we forgive those who sin against us right amen amen hallelujah and so we see you know can think of many many examples of how people rely on other things rather than God but let let's be determined in our hearts to rely on God when we have difficult times Hallelujah because the Bible said we do not want to Cast Away our confidence think about that our confidence would be like this Bible and and when when we take matters into our own hands it's the equivalent of just throwing this Bible across the room now that'd be a sacrilegious act wouldn't it but the same thing's true when when we say well I'm not going to pray about this I'm just going to do what I want to do it's the same thing right but is there is there mercy and forgiveness of course amen but we're Kings and Priests unto God and let's overcome let's act like kings and queens right let's act like a spiritual priest or a priestess we'd say always want to make sure this is uh appropriate for male and female right let's act like that let let's let's be determined next time I have a struggle I'm going to go right to prayer amen or I'm going to go right to singing a song of worship to to encourage me by God's grace I need that we all need that praise God Amen now I want to read through a few verses to kind of get a few good examples here let's go to uh 2 Chronicles 14 like I said I've been reading through these uh Kings it's just been really refreshing 2 Chronicles 14 verse1 and remember what brother Bram said it was it's just a good word of wisdom try to find someone in the Bible that's like your life right and then and then mimic their life in other words see how they overcame their difficulties and then model your life after them right praise God so when I first started pastoring I looked at Hezekiah I don't know if my wife remembers that or not but he started uh um he started reigning when he was 25 well that's when I started pastoring I looked right there in the Bible I'm like wow I need to follow what he did right he started ruling over people at 25 and I'm not ruling by it myself I'm ruling by the word of God the Bible says that uh obey them which have the rule over you that preach the word of God to you and they they live their life as an example before the people and so for a while I looked at him and I look at St Paul I look at David look at different ones I can who can I model my life after and so we can see that about uh ASA you know we have a friend up there in uh uh Lorraine yeah Sheffield and his name is as I always wonder why is his name as and then I went and read about ASA he was a mighty man of God right he was a mighty king now he had his mistakes but don't you and I have our mistakes too see sometimes we're so quick to judge other people but what would we have done if we were in that situation right I think if we're honest we'd say well we would have fell short at some point right we all would have fallen short of God's glory right so let's not be too quick to judge ASA or you know condemn somebody we of course we never want to do that anyway let God do the judging Hallelujah we have to condemn sin but uh God God's the one who does the ultimate judging of souls Hallelujah 2 Chronicles 14 I'm not there yet so just had that thought there verse one so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of David and ASA his son reigned instead in his days the land was quiet 10 years now look at that it's quite a blessing to have peace for 10 years right right it's quite a blessing now if you've suffered over a year or even a few months you know the pain of suffering so to have peace for 10 years that's a quite of a stamp of approval God just blessed you right amen 10 years no war now Israel's famous for you know leaving God and then all the enemies will surround Jerusalem right how many times has Jerusalem been destroyed rebuilt destroyed re it's the story of a believer's life right right a Believer gets victory for a while and then they let up and then they they need some correction right they need a difficult time to drive them back to God Amen it's just a beautiful story but here ASA ASA gets 10 years of quietness that should remind you of the New Testament right right we'll get to that in a moment verse two and ASA did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord is God don't you want God to say that about you amen Lydia did that which was good and right I can't use my children right amen verse three for he took away the altars of the strange gods look he took the idols out of the land now for us to be taking out you know the the care for riches right uh lust for money pornography uh dirty movies right I mean just take Evil songs right Wicked songs worldly songs any Idol movie stars whatever be take all these Idols got to be cast down in Jesus name right amen right some people can make an idol of just being depressed right self-pity you know feeling sorry for themselves they can make that their Idol that's what that's all they care about getting attention from others so we can learn from this a man or woman that does good and right in the sight of God takes all the idols out of their lives they live to God for everything and the high places and break down the images and cut down the Groves and commanded Judah now that's quite a thing command them to seek the Lord God of your their fathers and to do the law and the command and he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him look at that and church isn't that true you know the the more Temptations we get out of our Lives the more simple and wonderful and enjoyable our lives are amen how many can say Amen to that right yes when you make sure you you you're you're limiting anything other outside the word of God you're just more happy right amen life is just more simple right right life isn't so hard because you've got rid of all the distractions right amen and life just seems to go smoother amen I love that the land the kingdom was quiet before him verse six and he built fence cities in Judah for the land had rest and he had no war in those years because the Lord had given him rest ain't that awesome Amen you can you can love God and serve God so Faithfully that God will give you rest from major trials amen that's what the Bible teaches and I like that in his days of rest he wasn't uh you know slacking on God what was he doing he was building up and strengthening other cities amen now for us if God gives us peace and quiet we should build up our lives amen we should look at our lives and say what areas of my life are weakest how can I make them stronger right and another way to to to get stronger is to build up other people amen right right focus on other people build them up make them stronger help them out right see look outside of your city look to somebody else who can I protect who can I pray for who can I be a blessing to this was a time of rest therefore he said unto Judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers and Gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the Lord our God we sought him and he ha given us rest on every side so they built and prospered would that be great just to have peace in your family peace at home peace at work peace at school right peace at church peace at Aldi when you go to ALDI right right wherever you go peace it's just peace God blessed him with peace why because he sought the Lord and He took all the idols out of his life amen and God said because of that I'm rewarding you with the time of Peace amen not going to fight all these difficult Wars you're not going to have all this Bloodshed in these this decade think of that a decade of Peace we should be we should be striving for that praise God Amen Lord give me a decade of Peace Hallelujah 10 years of Peace verse eight and ASA had an army of men that bear targets and Spears out of Judah 300,000 and out of Benjamin that bear Shields and Drew bows 200 and4 score thousand and all these were Mighty Men of Valor so even in peace he had Mighty Men see even in times of Peace you can be Mighty in the faith amen now this reminds me again of a couple verses so let's go to 1 Timothy 2 verse 1 I preached these a few times over the years 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse one thank God for seasons of rest yeah amen I exhort there that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men so see constantly pray for people that are struggling anyone that needs prayer give God thanks verse two for kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty that's why I pray for Biden and Harris to repent of their support in abortions I still pray for them to repent I don't know if they will but I'm commanded to pray for them right right just like anyone anyone who would do wicked things like that supporting abortion and murder I still pray for them I don't agree with their sins but I'll pray for them I'm commanded to pray for them amen that we may lead a quiet and Peaceable life in all godliness and honesty so we pray for our leaders so we can have a peaceful life Hallelujah that's the scripture verse three for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior so a church who's on fire with the Holy Ghost they should be constantly praying and God will give them peace in their lives amen amen a't that wonderful God will give us seasons of Peace we just got to pray for our leaders we got to pray for you know State you know local state federal uh pray for everyone everyone that we're aware of we should pray constantly pray for them keep putting in those good prayer requests Hallelujah prise that's exactly right now go to acts 9 now this is off of memory this might be the wrong verse Acts 9:31 but in case you don't hold me on that one okay it is yeah that's right I wrote down right before service but I left the paper inside of my office then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost were multiplied look at that Holy Ghost filled Saints they they once were persecuted of course we've never lived through that in America yet we know the Bible said it's going to come the Bible said every nation uh will have the mark of the beast place down where if you don't take their Mark you'll be killed and you can't buy or sell without it so we know that's coming we don't know when though but here the Bible said God gave them rest God edified them so even while you're resting God can make you stronger Now isn't that the type of the natural how many like to get a good night's rest right how do you feel when you get a good night's rest you feel weaker or stronger well you're supposed to feel stronger that's the same thing spiritual as we're spiritually resting we can get stronger while we're resting in the promises of God Amen but we walk in the fear of the Lord we don't want to sin against God right amen and God gives us comfort in the Holy Ghost amen he's with us he's with me he's given me rest it's a great it's a great uh concept you so church can we see it we can see in the Old Testament right and we can see in the new can everybody see that God gives seasons of rest we can see it plainly in the scripture now if you would uh let's go to 2 Chronicles 17 so we're going to skip a few chapters ahead 2 Chronicles 176 2 Chronicles 176 now this speaking of Jehoshaphat now this verse was striking verse six I don't know if you've read this lately but listen to this and his heart was lifted up now how does that sound right away it doesn't sound good right but actually this is good usually we say people are lifted up they're prideful but this must mean Jehoshaphat has a lot of confidence in God amen right his heart is not depressed down in the ways of the Lord his heart is lifted up in the ways of the Lord amen in other words he's got confidence in God and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord moreover he took away the high places and Groves out of Judah see every time God's moving people are getting rid of their sins and the church said amen so if we want to see God move more we got to get sin out of our Lives got to talk to somebody about it or talk to eles about it or pray about it lay at the altar lay at your chair you got to get sin out of your life and then God comes on the scene praise God Amen Hallelujah verse 7 also in the third year of his Reign he s he sent to the princes even to Ben Hal and to Obadiah and to Zechariah and to nethanel and to Miah to teach in the cities of Judah and with them he sent Levites even and I'm not going to skip all I'm going to skip all those names he just names all the people the Levites and Priests verse 9 and they taught in Judah and had the book book of the law of the Lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people now I sent these verses to another bible message preacher down in South Carolina and scoffield calls this section the Revival under Jehoshaphat I thought that's beautiful how do you have what Revival means to make alive again right so the land was dead because of the idols but as soon as they got the idols out and they started teaching the word of God now they're having Revival right amen that's always the way to have Revival Hallelujah get the sin out of your life and be enjoy the word of God hear the word of God believe the word of God hallelujah amen and notice they were teaching the word of God so that's why I sent it to a teacher and he said Oh Glory to God he sent me these texts with these emojis that was such a blessing and I said it wasall see when you're having Revival sins out of your life and you want to learn more about the word of God Amen see you always hungering for more of God's word amen so how do they have Revival they got rid of sin and they wanted to learn learn more be taught the word of God hallelujah and then you know in the next in the rest of the chapter he he grows um he grows Israel he in verse 12 he racks he waxes great rather he builds Judah he builds cities of storehouses and he he develops his businesses raise up Mighty Men of Valor and all these men the Bible said in verse 16 willingly offer themselves to God so during this time of Peace uh they built up each other they got stronger they learn the word of God hallelujah amen it's a great lesson for us if we want to be strong in God we've got to rely upon God we've got to get sin out of our lives and we've got to Hunger for More of the word of God right amen I'll just give a case little pat on the back you know recently I've been noticed her been reading the church age book and she's been asking me some good Bible questions I thought right there look at that 14y old girl just reading a few pages every morning right few pages every morning same thing I used to do when when I used to read that book I read through that book a couple times and I that's a great example of just drawing n to God and see when you when you when you Feast on the word of God you ask questions about God's word right right and and that makes you want to grow closer to God Amen and you want God you come to church asking God questions Lord let the preacher preach on this let somebody preach on this we got brother bod coming on Sunday right he don't know nothing I'm preaching I'm sure he don't listen to me who would listen to me right but Le let's let's pull upon God's word and let's see if God will minister to some of our questions amen it happens so often yeah so often if we just come hungry to hear God's word amen amen amen okay now now I want to switch over here just show a few things you know um I was thinking about my life and I said this um I think last Wednesday when I preached it here you know I look back at my emails and uh you know it was uh July of 2018 when I started what I feel like has been a season of rest for me and I told you about you know just generally just about some church problems we used to have with certain certain individuals and uh I would lose sleep about it I was telling that to Serena uh on the drive to church with with Casa it was just hard to sleep you know it was just it was pressure stress just worrying how's this going to work out um and during during that season beforehand it was difficult sometimes to come to church it's difficult to see people and shake their hands right because you never know when the next critic I felt like when when am I going what what have I done wrong this time you know the next criticism the next criticism next criticism like I could never do anything right um but I just thought it was interesting you know in July of 2018 uh this this this uh group left and then remember August of 2018 who remembers August 2018 what happened that's when the church flooded remember that and I forgot about it but at that time another group uh had left as well so two months in a row and and uh you know God bless those individuals but they they were some of my biggest criticizers and I'm not saying that critical because some of them come back later and apologize so they admitted they were wrong and just in my in my heart of hearts and my in my love for God I was just trying to get through it and understand Lord have I done wrong and you know I'm scratching my head pulling out my hair you know have I done something wrong and but we've all we all witnessed back then if you remember back to 2018 it was like God allowed that flood to come in here we had a month over at the YMCA right we come back and God is our witness it's like we had a brand new church and not just the brand new carpet cuz it don't look new anymore but it was the criticism was gone the evil spirit of criticism was gone and now there was peace and love and joy back in the house of the Lord amen right so it's been five years since then now we've had some great I personally have had some great highlights in this season of rest uh remember the Bible says Paul you know went around strengthening all the disciples right we just read how when when the Kings had rest they sent the word of God and it strengthened them right in the New Testament the Bible says let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord so we saw in the Old Testament when they had seasons of rest God gave them teaching and God gave them the word of God and God strengthened them amen and remember you know you preach on Joshua a few years ago remember the Bible shows us the way to have strength in God repent and be humble the Bible says remember God's promise of his faithfulness amen right God told Joshua remember the word remember the promise and then keep all the commands you can right and Jesus said that uh Jesus uh says man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God we live by the word of God right amen and then the Bible says constantly speak God's word and constantly meditate upon God's word then you'll be strong amen so we know the way to be strong and if I'm having a season of Peace then I I I need to make myself strong because I know a battle's coming eventually right we know awful Winters eventually coming we know the icy roads are eventually coming right we know negative 10's probably coming again so we got to keep our pipes from bursting right we know it's coming it's inevitable seasons of Trials are coming it's inevitable so let's strengthen ourselves now right in a season of rest right and that's what I feel like God has done uh in my life of course and I believe in this church but remember the Bible says the joy of the Lord is your strength and the Bible said how do we have joy in thy presence is fullness of joy amen so we want to be strong so how do we be strong we got to get in his presence amen right and the I said how do you come in his presence give Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise un the Lord amen so come to church give God thanks give him praise get this presence that makes you joyful and then that Joy gives you strength praise God Amen oh the Bible gives us all these beautiful formulas amen amen these spiritual formulas these spiritual checklist we can use to honor God and obey his word and church and I thought again 2018 my season of rest started and I published my first book in in 2019 that's not a coincidence I remember there was a break in there when I stopped writing because I was discouraged and I was going through trials so isn't that interesting I couldn't finish that book and that book has now helped many many people yeah I still get testimonies about it and then in 2021 I put out my second book and I thought wow in my season of rest God's allowed me to get the word of God out just like the Bible just like Jehoshaphat he got the word out he had the word to be taught in a season of rest Hallelujah and church we've had some great things we've learned some great things you know this has helped many people too about water baptism I preach this down at the uh uh former Amish committee when we baptized 17 of them back in April 17 former Amish baptized they were baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost but they didn't know if you keep reading 10 days later after Jesus said this Peter said baptize in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah M right uh and then James and and John James and Peter baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then Peter baptized in the name of the Lord and then Paul baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then Paul was baptized in the name of the Lord which Father Son and Holy Ghost then equals Lord Jesus Christ the disciples never used father son Holy Ghost and when those former Amish saw it they went right to the water to be baptized that's been a great highlight of this season hallelujah hallelujah a great season of rest right so we got to recognize the seasons and what God has been showing us here I'm going to go back to this one um we saw how God you know over the years God showed us that we have three parts and we need the Holy Ghost in all three parts right most churches just get the first two parts they feel the Holy Ghost on their body you know they'll cry they'll say I got goosebumps or you know something like that that's fine that's good that's the Holy Ghost no doubt but it's got to get deeper inside you amen and then some of them will even get the Holy Ghost in their mind which is good they're thinking about the word of God they might speak in tongues they might prophesy but we all know people that have spoken tongues are prophesy and then go live a sinful life right and the Bible says in the New Testament perfect Holiness in the fear of God Amen other words make your life more holy as you become a Christian right as you become a more experienced Christian you should be more holy amen less sin in your life more Holiness amen amen that's what the Bible teaches but we found that real Holy Ghost filled Christians let the Holy Ghost go deeper than that down to the soul where God comes and lives in the very depth of their being amen their nature the soul is the nature of the person that's why some people have a sinful nature right they live a sinful life because they got a sinful nature but when you have God down in the soul you want everything in your life to obey God's word right amen and you say God I'm throwing open all the doors come in every area of my life fill every area of my life Hallelujah that's right take control of every area of my life amen right my thought life my finances uh my marriage right my my parenting Hallelujah my money already said money yeah uh my church life you know my my relationships my friendships my education right make everything God's spirit makes a difference in every area of Our Lives hallelujah amen and that's a real person who's really filled with the Holy Ghost they want every part of their life directed by God Amen obedient to the word of God and this this actually takes three steps right to be filled with God's spirit takes three steps somebody go back there just like being born takes three steps water break blood Breath of Life a man's spiritual birth is three steps justification you're saved you're forgiven but you got to be Sanctified you got to be cleaned out and then you got to be baptized with the Holy Ghost in your soul amen most churches stop right here they say okay you're saved and they they don't move the people on to a more separated cleaned out life right but we want to go beyond that praise God Amen we want to go to the filling of the Holy Ghost where your soul is immersed in the spirit of God so every part of our Lives is directed by the holy spirit amen Israel even it took them three steps to get out of to possess the land they left Egypt they went through the Wilderness and then they possessed the promised land amen the Tabernacle was cleansed in three parts the outer core the holy place the Hest of holies the Earth was cleansed by Noah's flood then Jesus's blood and it's going to be burned by fire right before the Millennium and then ezekiel's prophecy said there'll be three steps to be filled with the Holy Ghost God gives you a new heart a new spirit and then God's spirit comes and dwells in you Jesus said the Holy Ghost is like a plant a wheat plant with three stages the blade comes forth then the ear then the full corn right amen and then Jesus said I am the way the truth and he gives you the Holy Ghost life hallelujah oh beautiful praise God it's just the Bible is so beautiful it's so rich amen amen um so these are all great highlights of this season of rest here and as you know my family we're almost reading through we're almost done reading through the the the 12 New Testament Mysteries book but remember brother Ram spoke over 30 times to thus sayth the Lord in other words God told him 30 times to say I'm speaking this with my authority and that's what I always say if anyone has a question about brother BR go that 13th chapter of that book because that lays it out as best as I possibly could by the help of God brother raham gave us at least five fulfilled prophecies that have come to pass he gave us six thus say the Lords about New Testament Mysteries he gave us eight doctrines with thus sayith the Lord and he's given us 11 future prophecies with thus sayeth the Lord all these great uh blessings they've come in this season of rest right and I can recognize that in my life as a season of rest you know how many times have I looked at my wife or we talked and maybe just I've said honey we sure enjoying these Golden Years these last five years have been I mean they've all been wonderful being married to her you know but I'm talking about like you know troubles and trials we've really had we've had really had some wonderful years here where they're peaceful and they're in obedience and we're growing in the things of God Amen I just got an email this week of the brother said uh forget where he's from some foreign country but he said brother Jesse your video about how to overcome pornography he said it set me completely free from pornography thanks the Lord hallelujah what are we doing we're trying to strengthen other people amen we're trying to strengthen the Saints like they did in the Bible get rid of all these Idols no doubt pornography is an awful Idol you got to break down that Idol you can overcome that Idol praise God crush it like they did in the Bible amen crush it Hallelujah yes get rid of it Hallelujah and fill your life with the love of God God hallelujah amen so we had these great uh highlights you know in this uh season of rest been very thankful for all these God has done wonderful things and so I want to recognize that I want to thank God for seasons of rest and we we've learned to rely upon the Lord praise God right I hope that you feel this way as a church we rely on each other's prayers right right some of our families maybe don't believe in God or they don't believe the same way we do which is you know that's their choice and we love them still but you you know you wouldn't maybe ask them to pray for you because you know they don't have faith like they should have right and so who do you go to when you need prayer hopefully one of us by God's grace right right because you have confidence in their prayers amen hallelujah because God has strengthened us over the years in quiet years God's Building up our confidence in the word of God God's teaching us to trust in his word even in the quiet times God's Building up fences around us amen God's putting Gates around us praise God Amen God's uh putting doors in front of us hallelujah amen he's given us Shields of Faith hallelujah amen now we're getting into the the full armor of a Christian hallelujah amen he's given us a sword to battle with praise God Amen and all the Army of a fully armed Christian amen God has been strengthening Us in these Seasons amen and it's been a great blessing but yet Kings must rely upon the lord it's a great thing to do Church to rely on the lord it's a great thing to do it's hard to do right people want to rely on their own smarts or their own plans or their own their own ideas about the future they want to rely upon family or friends or their boss whatever they want to rely on so many other things other than relying upon the Eternal God right and that's we've got to learn to rely on the Lord Jesus Hallelujah so we saw there uh getting back to our text this same King ASA who did such a wonderful job and had the 10 years of rest he was the one that when the the enemy came the syrians I'm sorry another enemy came against him he hired or the Syrian King and tried to hire him to help him out to fight his battles and God said because of that you've lost the battle you've lost the battle because you relied upon the hand of man rather than the strong arm of the Lord hallelujah think about that church sometimes sometimes we don't think about enough God says my right hand is my right hand of strength right right God's God God's got power Hallelujah he's not short on power he can deliver he can save he can heal Hallelujah he can provide hallelujah amen it's a right hand of power the Bible says amen amen and he wants us to rely on him praise God now what we see is that sometimes people get they rely upon themselves right they get prideful and we must not let Pride build up in our lives that's just an awful Idol as something else might be right like greed or something you know or lust or something awful is just as awful to be prideful like I can rely upon myself or I can trust me I know I won't fail well just give yourself five minutes you might fail right you might fail right you might not do what you said you were going to do so we've got to put all of our trust in God Amen Hallelujah how many want to put their trust in Christ tonight amen hallelujah I'm almost done here by God's grace so we go through these Seasons church and we've we've got to learn here to strengthen ourselves in these Seasons like here tonight tonight's service is not in vain this should be an opportunity where you can leave here saying I'm stronger than what I was when I came am that's right right I'm stronger I'm more joyful amen right I know the word better right amen some of you might want to print out his life there and just hang it up on your fridge there right get rid of all the idols season of rest God prospers everything in my life right I mean who wouldn't want that but you got to be willing to break down the idols praise God that means everything comes into subjection to the word of God right everything comes into subjection to God's word remember the Bible just says it like this it's just a matter of yielding right right Malachi and I drive to taekwondo every every Monday night and we always go to copy Circle right Malachi right before we get right before we get there what do we got to do we got to yield right there we got a choice we can either burn through it and I'm glad he doesn't do that somebody taught him well to drive must been my wife he don't try to burn through and I'm not yielding every time he's yielded so far keep it up buddy yield you just have to let the other person have their way right and the church said now I'm not saying don't let people walk on you sometimes Jesus says you have to let people do that but I don't mean I mean it not in bad ways like physical abuse mental abuse sexual abuse never allow that sometimes you got to lend money to people and hope they don't pay it back right like that's what Jesus said lend money and hope they don't pay you back all right or make a meal for somebody and you know they would never make a meal for you that's real Christianity right helping the people that can't help you back right but that's what the Bible says following the Holy Spirit each day is just yielding to God's spirit letting God's word have its way in your life and not taking your way and things that you want to go or things that you want to do and the way you want your life to go but yielding to God's way and the way you know it's God's way is it obeys God's word right Hallelujah obeying God's word and so you know in these last five years I feel like God has really strengthened me you know as as I've told you you know my only real persecution these last five years has been online right but sticks and stones may hurt my I'm sorry Sticks and Stones how's that go may may break my bones that's right break my bones but words but comments or thumbs up or thumbs down will never hurt me on YouTube right that'll never hurt me on YouTube it won't hurt me it make me nervous and upset you know and but it won't hurt me thank God we're in a season of Peace amen but we get stronger because we still have battles to face but God's word makes us stronger God's word makes us joyful God's word edifies us hallelujah God's word keeps Our Lives clean hallelujah amen that's what God gives God gives us peace prosperity restoration he rebuilds Our Lives amen hallelujah gives us a fresh start he turns the page as we've said right right God let you turn the page start a new chapter in life oh it's so wonderful just like these wonderful kings that God had raised up there ASA and Jehoshaphat hallelujah it's also a great time to store up treasure in heaven if You' got peace that's a time to serve other people fast pray give arms store up Treasures in Heaven where nobody can break in and rob the bank in heaven Hallelujah no devil will rob that bank amen hallelujah he protected by the spirit of Holiness hallelujah oh it's beautiful now remember let's read a couple more verses uh I'm done with that I think let's read just a couple more I just had a couple more verses uh 1 Chronicles 49 1st Chronicles 4:9 I recently heard this preach and I thought well this would be a good reminder for all of us 1 Chronicles 4:9 actually nine and 10 in case you when you get a chance there this familiar now somebody wrote a big famous book about this it kind of took it the wrong way but if you take it the right way this this this uh testimony is really powerful it's about JZ how many remember the book of JZ the prayer JZ I read the book it's a real short book it's all positive positive positive and that's good but if you take some new testament Scriptures it really balances it out okay so let's read that there and Jaz now his name means sorrow so think about that you know when he was born his mom looked at him and said sorrow that's pretty sad name right youd want your name to be like blessing or virtue or something that'd be a good name to have or Joy or something like that healing or faith or something but mom looks at Jaz sorrow sorrow this baby is sorrow to me and jabz was more honorable than his brother and his mother called his name jabz saying because I bear him with sorrow so it was a difficult birth right difficult delivery and Jaz called on the god of Israel saying oh that th would bless me indeed and enlarge my coast and that thine hand might be with me and that thou wouldest Keep Me From Evil that's the ticket right there that's the key right there keep me from evil in other words I'm not asking for more so I can enjoy the lust of it I'm asking so I'll avoid evil amen I want to have more responsibility I want to have more in in his case land so that I can do good with it amen I want to be kept from Evil things right I don't want all these Temptations I want to serve God Amen and look at that let your hand might be with me the Bible said God stretched forth his hand to heal Hallelujah so he wanted healing Hallelujah he wanted blessings he wanted all his needs met it's a beautiful testimony here I guess I overuse the word beautiful it was a tremendous testimony here that's another word I've overused for 10 years uh that enlarge my my Coast that thy hand might be with me that thou Keep Me From Evil and that it may not grieve me see he didn't want a life of constant grief right suffering and disappointment and despair he wanted strength he wanted happiness right and what did God do God gave him what he asked for amen well those moms said well you came to this world sorrow yet he said Lord make me a blessing amen bless me so I can avoid evil and I can expand my Coast course that would mean right land would be either animals or right grains or so I can be a blessing to people amen and notice that more honorable so that means his other brothers they enjoyed a little bit of sin but not Jaz Jaz was against sin hallelujah amen and that in church just you know in the natural we all many of us have brothers and sisters some of us has seven brothers and sisters right or five or nine right or eight yeah we got a lot of big families here and so it's not a competition you know against your siblings but your desire should be Lord I want to be kept from all evil amen I don't want to play with sin in other words right I want to live holy to Christ amen and God will look down and say I'll bless a prayer like that amen so I've got four brothers and a sister and I'm not in competition but my desire is Lord Keep Me From Evil right do whatever you have to do to keep me humble walk in the ways of God that I'll live holy to glorify your name amen if that means I I'm I'm more honorable than praise God I know they'd say I've heard cam preach the same thing so that's just that that's what every Christian wants right every Christian wants to honor God and live clean to God hallelujah amen but we need reminders of that that's why this is a good reminder for us amen now the balance on this is that it's not all fun and games if you get your your Coast enlarged or I've got more money or I've got more influence because Jesus said to whom much is given much is required right so so in other words on the day of judgment God's going to ask you now what did you do with that extra money what did you do with that extra platform I gave you right what you do with that and you want to be able to say Lord here's what I've done I did like you told me I did what was right I did which was good and right in your sight amen and remember the Bible says preachers will be judged most harsh I'm bringing that up mainly for my sake and any of the maybe future preachers where's Zion is he there where's Malachi any any brother you know if they would consider those things they got to consider that you're going to be judged more harshly right more strictly because of your position and so this is the great uh this is just a great prayer you know he called on God he said God I want to do more for your name Hallelujah I don't want a life of Sorrow I don't want a life of grief I want a life of blessings and God heard that humble prayer what did he want to do he wanted to rely on the Lord amen amen he didn't want to rely on other people he said Lord enlarge my Coast so I can be a blessing to other people that's a wonderful prayer that's a prayer of a sincere heart and that's a prayer that God will answer Hallelujah last verse I just read this one this morning I thought well it's perfect 2 Chronicles chapter 32 this is my chapter this morning 2 Chronicles 32 then we'll be finish up right about 8:00 right school night trying to watch the clock here try not to get too caught up in Heavenly places here tonight who's ready to dance around the church Hallelujah 2 Chronicles 32 verse 20 and 21 there's a time there's a season to dance no doubt about that all right now in this case uh if you just go back and read the chapter maybe in your free time sen a cherub was a king and he sent letters first he gathered around Israel and then uh you know they prayed nothing happened then he sent a letter right a threat sometimes that's how like our text messages are like threats right modern day modern day threats from the Bible Tex you or emails oh I got this email I got this i got this text it's our modern day sen cherub and it was quite intimidating and he and he said what makes you think your God will save you all these other nations said their gods would save them and I've destroyed all of them and so what did the prophet and the King do Hallelujah very simple and church this is how simple it is for us verse 20 and for this cause Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos prayed and cried to Heaven see that church sometimes prayer isn't enough sometimes you got to cry some tears that's right amen not just they just didn't pray they cried amen and God saw their tears amen praise God grown men grown men Isaiah a man who wrote a 66 chapter book of the Bible he saw God High lifted up and a coal touched his mouth is that right right he said here am I send me and here's a man that could cry and pray to God am what' God do with all these threats with all these uh all this intimidation against him did God hear their cries absolutely verse 21 and the Lord sent an angel aren't you glad he sends Angels amen and cut off all the Mighty Men of Valor and the leaders and the captains in the camp of the king of Syria Assyria and he returned with shame of face to his own land and when he was coming in the house of his God they that came forth of his own bows slew him there with the sword not a very pleasant ending to this man's life but he spoke against the god in other words he spoke against the Holy Spirit and so he reaped what he sowed he blasting the Holy Ghost and look what happened to him right he went beyond mercy and he was judged but we want to be the group like Isaiah and Hezekiah cry unto God and God will hear from heaven and God will send his Deliverance to his people amen let's stand to our feet praise God musicians can come Kings must rely on the Lord I love like I said I love verses like this I can apply it directly to my life has God given me seasons of difficulty sure has God given me seasons of Peace absolutely absolutely you know why cuz Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same amen hallelujah he's the same today let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer church if you're having trouble relying on the Lord let's take this as a as a a lesson we can learn here tonight let's pray and ask God to forgive us if we haven't relied on the Lord you know church every now and then I'm sure you could say Amen you know I don't rely on the Lord I rely on my own planning my own thinking well I'll do this then I'll do that then and I'll have this for that that and it just doesn't work out it just doesn't work out and then God will break me down and I gotta like I told you I gotta cry out to God like I did last week then God sends the answer amen amen and I don't deserve it I don't deserve it but God show me to rely on him am amen rely on him have confidence in Christ today Heavenly Father we thank you God for this opportunity to be in your house Lord Lord this blessed my soul last week when I read it seasons of rest a decade of [Music] rest you blessed ASA with a decade no battles no Wars no enemies surrounding him causing

the mind and the Soul we want it recorded that we did which was good and right we want you to hear our prayers Lord God because they're praying with sincere Hearts not based upon our sinful desires Hallelujah I want to thank you Lord for 5 years of rest Lord God I testified of it even in the midst of Co it was a very restful year for me I finished that book I had more time with my family I

of the lambskins may we apply this fresh word of God to our lives Lord God let the Life of Christ freshly anoint us dear God lord I was even inspired because one of the Saints said they want to do
