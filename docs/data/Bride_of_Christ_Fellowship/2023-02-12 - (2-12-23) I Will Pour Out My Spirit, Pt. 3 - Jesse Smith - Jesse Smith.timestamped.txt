[11:53] areas
[12:01] six
[12:04] before we sit here
[12:28] God bless you guys
[12:32] okay so uh God did something awesome
[12:35] last Thursday
[12:37] so
[12:39] I recently got my my grandma's wedding
[12:42] ring in
[12:45] and uh she gave it to me so
[12:48] I was gonna put it around like a
[12:49] necklace you know to keep it on me but I
[12:52] didn't have a necklace that would stay
[12:53] on it always falls off so I was wearing
[12:56] it and I've been going to the trails a
[12:58] lot like walking the trails
[13:00] and this one day last Thursday
[13:03] I walked all the way through this Four
[13:05] Mile Trail and then on my way home I
[13:07] realized like or when I got home I
[13:09] realized the ring wasn't on my finger
[13:11] anymore
[13:12] and I felt so bad I was like
[13:16] what kind of grandson I could hear like
[13:20] it's in my head like come on why'd you
[13:22] lose the ring but
[13:23] so anyways though I literally started
[13:26] like thinking I'm like I gotta rely on
[13:28] God I was like I gotta I gotta humbly
[13:30] come to God and like
[13:32] repented some pride and stuff and just
[13:35] go to God and really trust in him you
[13:37] know so because I was like as small as
[13:38] it seems I was a God I know you can't
[13:40] help me find my grandma's drink I feel
[13:41] awful
[13:43] so I woke up the next day determined I
[13:45] was like oh yeah I'm gonna find it like
[13:46] I look good you know hey I'm gonna find
[13:49] it okay guys you know God's Gonna help
[13:51] me find it so I'm walking this Trail you
[13:54] know I go back to the trail and I'm like
[13:55] it's a Four Mile trailer takes like two
[13:57] hours you could do so I'm just scanning
[13:59] back and forth the whole time I was
[14:01] looking for this ring
[14:02] and I just keep I keep telling myself
[14:04] because I kept doubting I'm like awesome
[14:05] I found it you know it's it's over and
[14:08] every time I would think that I would
[14:10] start chanting I would be like
[14:12] it's God's will I'm gonna find it it's
[14:14] God's will I'm gonna find it until I
[14:15] wouldn't feel that doubt anymore
[14:17] and then like halfway through I was just
[14:19] like beating myself up I'm like
[14:21] oh
[14:22] an idiot for doing that and
[14:25] but
[14:26] I like I got on my knees and I started
[14:28] praying to God like really hard like I
[14:30] just started praying like I'm like Lord
[14:32] I was like if there's anything I'm so
[14:33] sorry you know forgive me Lord I don't I
[14:35] don't you know I just wanna I just want
[14:38] you to work through me I was like I know
[14:40] this is an insignificant you know
[14:42] materialistic ring
[14:43] but I was like it means a lot to me you
[14:45] know and I really want to find it I'll
[14:46] I'll just put it in a box until I get a
[14:49] necklace
[14:50] and I'm just really praying I'm like
[14:52] Lord if you don't if it's not your will
[14:53] for me to find it today then I'll fast
[14:55] and pray so you can give it well give me
[14:57] a vision and show me where it is in a
[14:58] vision like I was determined to find it
[14:59] so after that prayer
[15:01] I started feeling a lot better
[15:03] you know and I was just like all right
[15:04] guys will I started to doubt because
[15:06] God's willing to find it and I get to
[15:08] the end and I'm like by the end of it
[15:10] I'm like okay I don't even care anymore
[15:11] so I still get the season happens so
[15:13] it's okay
[15:15] but I get to the very end
[15:17] and then I'm walking
[15:19] and I walk into this Plaza
[15:22] sitting on sitting on the ground right
[15:24] so so
[15:26] I literally picked it up and I went
[15:28] outside and I started jumping I was like
[15:30] thank you God I was like yeah I was like
[15:32] hey man like it was it was it was the
[15:35] craziest it may be like a small story
[15:37] but like to me it was great I felt like
[15:39] like a Bible that was in a Bible verse
[15:42] like I was just like my God I was
[15:44] fighting doubt but then like God was
[15:45] like oh
[15:47] I'm really trusting in God this time and
[15:49] I really I ever found it sitting it was
[15:51] sitting in the public area too where all
[15:53] the people walked so
[15:55] had been God
[15:57] yeah so that that's the uh that happened
[15:59] last Thursday so I didn't
[16:01] like so excited since that so it was
[16:04] awesome
[16:47] thanking God
[16:52] why how far he's brought hair like she's
[16:54] 70 years that's a lot and then to think
[16:58] of the fact that she's not I don't even
[17:00] remember
[17:03] I don't even remember how she ever like
[17:05] getting taken in bed for a long time

[32:13] two Hallelujah you like to preach on I
[32:16] will pour out my spirit part three by
[32:17] God's grace
[32:19] it's good to be with you in the House of
[32:21] Lords seems like it's been a long time
[32:22] since I preached so I kind of feel like
[32:24] a rookie again today
[32:26] Acts chapter 2
[32:28] by God's grace verse 4 Acts chapter 2
[32:31] verse 4.
[32:32] you know we've had some wonderful
[32:33] Ministry I'm so thankful the Lord sent
[32:35] brother Ben and then brother Simon you
[32:37] know we just had some wonderful Ministry
[32:42] pardon me
[32:43] um it was just something I love about
[32:45] both of their ministries of course all
[32:47] these brothers that come through here
[32:50] we're so blessed to have men that can
[32:52] yield to the Holy Ghost praise God
[32:54] that's just wonderful to have that
[32:58] the brother Ben took us deep down into
[33:00] some you know mind battles we might have
[33:01] and showed us how we can overcome those
[33:04] by God's grace by surrender how many
[33:06] still surrendering today a week later
[33:08] are you still surrendered absolutely
[33:10] Hallelujah Simon showed us how God's
[33:13] with us through the valleys
[33:16] we can't live on the mountain
[33:17] thank God for the mountain but God is
[33:20] going to walk with us through the valley
[33:21] praise God all the way through thank God
[33:24] I'm glad he doesn't leave us you know
[33:26] some some at some point in the valley
[33:28] I'm glad he goes more than halfway with
[33:30] us I'm glad he goes all the way through
[33:31] with me to praise God because I need
[33:33] somebody to walk with me praise God I
[33:36] can't do it alone I need the Lord Jesus
[33:37] Christ
[33:38] Acts chapter 2 verse 4.
[33:43] well look at that I will pour out my
[33:45] spirit here part three by God's Great
[33:47] I'm going to believe he pours out his
[33:49] Spirit still
[33:51] saith God it's such a beautiful promise
[33:53] God promised to pour out his Spirit he
[33:56] didn't say when he just said upon All
[33:58] Flesh and he said in the last days
[34:01] so we met already two conditions we're
[34:03] in flesh and we're in the last days
[34:06] Hallelujah now we're just waiting on the
[34:08] right timing praise God hallelujah
[34:10] and you know of course we've had the
[34:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost that is God's
[34:14] pouring out his Spirit but then we know
[34:16] we need revivals praise God when your
[34:18] revivals of our minds and we need uh we
[34:21] need church revivals praise God we just
[34:23] we need Revival Hallelujah
[34:25] thank God so let's go to Acts 2 verse 4.
[34:28] let's read that verse 4 1 2 3 and they
[34:31] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[34:34] began to speak with other tongues as the
[34:37] spirit gave them utterance now turn if
[34:39] you would to verse 15 I'll read 15.
[34:43] for these are not drunken as you suppose
[34:45] seeing it as but the third hour of the
[34:47] day but this is that which was spoken by
[34:50] the prophet Joel let's all read verse 17
[34:53] if we can one two three and it shall
[34:56] come to pass in the last days saith God
[34:59] I will pour out of my spirit upon All
[35:03] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[35:06] shall prophesy and your young men shall
[35:09] see visions and your old men shall dream
[35:12] dreams amen let's have one more word of
[35:14] prayer how many want God to minister to
[35:16] them today by God's grace just show it
[35:17] maybe with the uplifting of hand or
[35:19] about heart let's pray together father

[35:55] beheaded they trust in these same
[35:57] promises God help us in the midst of our
[35:59] light afflictions dear God that we will
[36:02] trust your promises Lord God hallelujah
[36:04] we're so grateful Lord Jesus for all
[36:06] you've done Lord God and we know the
[36:08] Same Spirit the same holy ghost that
[36:10] minister to those early Saints will be
[36:12] with us today in the midst of our trials
[36:14] Lord God and you promise to pour out
[36:16] your spirit Lord God so we are looking
[36:18] to that God for those of us that have
[36:19] received that we're rejoicing in that
[36:21] but we need more of your spirit dear God
[36:23] we need more of your blessings to be
[36:25] poured out on us Lord God hallelujah we
[36:27] want pure Minds God we want pure hearts
[36:29] Lord God we want a testimony that
[36:31] pleases you Lord Jesus we want to be led
[36:34] by the spirit because we are the sons
[36:35] and daughters of God we can see that
[36:37] Lord God over all these years over these
[36:39] these lives we've lived Lord God we can
[36:41] see we are the sons and daughters of God
[36:43] you've proved it to us and Lord we just
[36:46] want to keep walking pleasing to you so
[36:48] Lord pour out your spirit that we can
[36:50] continue to walk into your promises we
[36:52] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[36:53] name the Saints said amen God bless you
[36:56] as you're being seated praise God
[37:01] so I want to continue with it uh
[37:03] continue on this little thought you know
[37:04] we've been looking a lot of history you
[37:06] know from Zoo's history I guess I'll go
[37:08] back here and just show some of these
[37:09] pictures again
[37:10] and then I'll just kind of skip forward
[37:11] I don't know if Emma's been here have
[37:14] you been here on
[37:16] I don't know if Emma's seen all the
[37:17] pictures there but William Seymour so
[37:19] this is the the black brother who
[37:21] preached uh the beginning of this
[37:23] revival
[37:24] the Legacy in churches think about that
[37:27] the laodicean church they started with
[37:29] one man
[37:30] who is so hungry for God we're going to
[37:32] see his exact quote in a minute but just
[37:35] a humble man this is the I couldn't see
[37:38] out of his left eye you can see it's a
[37:39] little bit different than his right eye
[37:40] I think he had polio and he lost the
[37:43] sight in his left eye he only had one
[37:45] eye now I think about that he has less
[37:47] eyes he had less eyes than we have to
[37:49] read the Bible and God still poured out
[37:50] the spirit in his life praise God
[37:52] he didn't have he didn't have all the
[37:54] natural blessings that we have praise
[37:56] God but he had one thing that we need
[37:58] more of and that's a hunger for God
[38:00] hallelujah and so we want to also uh
[38:03] just show you know here's the humble
[38:04] building it was just a 40 by 60 building
[38:08] a very humble building there's another
[38:10] look at it there's brother Seymour there
[38:11] at the front
[38:14] uh and I don't know if there had other
[38:15] ones oh yeah there's his wife Jenny
[38:18] Jenny was filled with the Holy Ghost
[38:20] that first night it fell I believe it
[38:21] was April 4th if I'm not mistaken 1906
[38:26] and then uh there's a there's a there's
[38:28] the first house it fell in look at this
[38:30] humble little house and I can drive down
[38:32] some Akron streets I can see the houses
[38:33] that look a lot like this
[38:36] is this some mansion uh you know is this
[38:38] some Mansion or is this some beautiful
[38:39] edifice like Solomon's Temple
[38:42] it's just a humble home
[38:44] it was so humble after just three days
[38:46] of meetings this porch collapsed because
[38:48] it couldn't hold all the shouting
[38:50] jumping worshipers praise God the people
[38:53] that were glorifying the Lord so it's
[38:55] it's a beautiful story and we want to
[38:57] return to how many want to return to Our
[38:58] Roots praise God this is our Roots this
[39:01] is the beginning of the church age
[39:02] praise God brother Adam said as we'll
[39:04] see this is the second greatest pouring
[39:06] out of the spirit since the day of
[39:09] Pentecost so let's get up here now I
[39:11] want to look at more details I'm just
[39:12] going to pull a few details from this
[39:13] book you know sister Wendy actually gave
[39:15] me this book and it's been sitting on my
[39:17] shelf for years and years and years I
[39:19] knew there was a time in season four
[39:20] praise God and so I read through the the
[39:22] first portion you know uh the reason I'm
[39:24] not going to read through the second
[39:25] portion is because because it goes
[39:27] through like Oral Roberts and and you
[39:29] know now it says like TD Jakes is now
[39:31] one of these uh
[39:34] beneficiaries of the zuza street now
[39:36] myself I differ with that I want to
[39:38] respect all men and women but I don't
[39:41] really believe the Holy Ghost is truly a
[39:43] hundred percent in his ministry but of
[39:45] course I can name anyone Joel Steen or
[39:47] even John MacArthur who's a very sound
[39:50] Bible teacher but I don't believe
[39:52] they're fully yield to the Holy Ghost I
[39:54] don't believe they have the Revival I
[39:55] believe we've got the Revival praise God
[39:57] how do I know because it lines up with
[39:59] God's word amen
[40:01] just like Jesus said Jesus said they'll
[40:04] rise many false christs
[40:06] false anointed ones and show many signs
[40:10] and brother random I just listened to
[40:11] brother man yesterday he he said he said
[40:13] well how can we know brother they said
[40:15] brother how can we know if they have if
[40:16] they have Miracles if they have the dead
[40:17] Rays if they have all these things how
[40:19] can we know brother Adam said he said
[40:20] you got to look for the thus saith the
[40:22] Lord in the Bible
[40:24] Hallelujah so every time Church there's
[40:26] a question every time there's uh
[40:28] something we must know or understand
[40:30] we've got to look in the Bible Church
[40:32] we've got to stay in the Bible how many
[40:34] how many excited to say in the Bible
[40:35] praise God you have to stay in the Bible
[40:39] anytime we step out we're on Dangerous
[40:41] Grounds like brother Randolph said uh he
[40:44] said
[40:45] God can do things out of the Bible like
[40:48] God cannot be limited to just this Bible
[40:50] right because he's outside of time and
[40:52] he's outside a paper and he's greater
[40:53] than the paper he's greater than the ink
[40:55] he said but for me he said I just want
[40:57] to stay with what I know is in this
[40:59] Bible praise God because I know God he
[41:02] will do things according to this Bible
[41:04] Hallelujah he can do things outside of
[41:06] it we don't want to limit God to that
[41:09] uh even so much where brother Brandon
[41:11] originally thought in the 1960s or 1960
[41:14] brother Ram thought there were seals
[41:15] inside the book and outside the book
[41:18] brother and thought that but then the
[41:20] Holy Spirit quickened him on the
[41:21] unveiling of God in 1964. he said I
[41:24] always thought there was seals inside
[41:25] and outside he said but then I realized
[41:27] it can't be outside the book he said
[41:29] because you can't add one thing or take
[41:31] one thing away from this word praise God
[41:33] my brother man was looking at one time
[41:35] he thought there was going to be seals
[41:37] and Revelations that are outside the
[41:39] Bible
[41:39] but he said if God did that he would
[41:41] contradict what he already wrote in the
[41:43] Bible what a consolation to us church if
[41:46] we can just stay in the word of God
[41:47] hallelujah if we can just keep feeding
[41:49] on the word of God then we shall not be
[41:51] deceived amen amen
[41:53] amen now here's what I thought I had
[41:54] this week just a simple very very simple
[41:56] thought how many know that the Bible
[41:58] says the elect cannot be deceived
[42:00] the elect cannot be deceived but this
[42:03] doesn't mean that we won't get deceived
[42:05] like in a mistake that we make
[42:08] so I just want to make sure this is a
[42:09] fresh thought I hadn't preached it
[42:10] before because look at Peter Peter got
[42:13] the Holy Ghost he started on fire but
[42:15] then he got deceived by his spirit of
[42:17] fear
[42:18] he let fear deceive him into not
[42:20] fellowshipping with gentiles
[42:22] right fear he was afraid of the Jewish
[42:25] teachers
[42:27] now maybe some of you have never
[42:29] experienced that fear before but peer
[42:31] pressure is a real thing
[42:34] you know I really never felt a lot of
[42:36] peer pressure so I sat around a bunch of
[42:37] message preachers and everybody's asking
[42:41] what do you believe in what are you
[42:42] thinking well I think this and I think
[42:44] that
[42:45] and everybody turns and it seems like
[42:47] they all look at you right at you
[42:49] all the faces in the crowd turn right at
[42:52] you
[42:52] and so it seems like maybe Peter come
[42:54] under that he's a man filled with the
[42:56] Holy Ghost Church he could say I've got
[42:58] thus saith the Lord I've got the Keys of
[43:00] the Kingdom
[43:01] but because of a few preachers looking
[43:03] at him and what do you think are the
[43:05] Jews more holy than the Gentiles well
[43:07] yeah actually you know we we actually
[43:09] are more holy so I'm not going to eat
[43:10] with the Gentiles
[43:12] and so God has to send this Prophet all
[43:14] the way across however however many
[43:16] miles and brother Adam said put a finger
[43:18] under his nose and said you're the one
[43:20] to be blamed preacher
[43:22] you men of God who walked on water you
[43:24] man of God who's got the Keys of the
[43:26] Kingdom you're the one to be blamed
[43:28] because you're honoring some brethren
[43:30] above the other let's honor all men
[43:32] praise God let's honor our Sisters Let's
[43:34] honor our children let's honor the
[43:36] elderly let's honor the young let's
[43:38] honor everybody with the same love
[43:39] praise God
[43:41] but notice church he was deceived in
[43:43] that in that in that space of time
[43:46] but God was gracious what that means is
[43:48] they won't be deceived into being lost
[43:51] that's what that means the elect cannot
[43:53] be deceived into being lost
[43:56] right so what a consolation we know God
[43:59] started our Salvation he's going to
[44:01] continue our Salvation he's going to
[44:03] finish and we're going to receive the
[44:04] end of our salvation
[44:06] Hallelujah I hope that was a help to
[44:07] somebody when you look at you know we
[44:10] are we are elect we that means we are
[44:12] chosen we're chosen before the
[44:14] foundation World we're chosen to
[44:15] salvation but we are going to be
[44:17] deceived we are going to have little
[44:18] mistakes in some minor areas
[44:22] right but God's grace he's going to send
[44:24] somebody to bring us back in line amen
[44:26] now specifically I don't want a preacher
[44:28] to come put his finger under my nose
[44:30] publicly
[44:31] I'd rather have it in private
[44:34] right but but Peter Peter got it
[44:36] publicly
[44:38] and Peter Paul said you're the one to be
[44:40] blamed so church we got to be humble and
[44:43] realize at some point the blame is going
[44:45] to be on us but we got to be humble
[44:46] enough to accept it praise God
[44:49] Hallelujah
[44:51] it was my fault imagine Peter getting up
[44:53] there and said you know Saints I'm sorry
[44:56] are the Keys of the Kingdom
[44:58] I'm sorry after church you know I'm
[45:00] sorry I I I I I I I walled off the Jews
[45:04] and Gentiles over there in the
[45:05] fellowship hall I'm sorry about that
[45:07] right because that's what he had he had
[45:09] a fellowship hall and he he only had
[45:11] Jews on one side and Gentiles on the
[45:13] other I'm so glad I could sit right next
[45:15] to brother amen I can sit right next to
[45:17] Sister Beatrice and her family right
[45:18] there's no walls dividing us praise God
[45:20] all the walls all the discrimination are
[45:23] all all of any any evil thoughts it's
[45:27] all been taken away by the blood of
[45:28] Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[45:30] we got to be careful I'm Gonna Knock
[45:31] this off like I did last week amen
[45:34] I don't know I don't know I didn't know
[45:35] that was a punching bag all these years
[45:39] you see the blood of Christ does that
[45:41] now look and that proves church we all
[45:43] need a fresh sanctification amen we all
[45:45] need a fresh Revival sometimes amen a
[45:47] man of God like Peter who knew Jesus he
[45:50] saw him resurrected he saw him in a
[45:51] glorified body
[45:53] he saw Jesus create fish and have fish
[45:56] burning there and bread right there when
[45:58] you come in from the the fishing and he
[46:00] said my Lord and my God you know he saw
[46:02] right there he saw Jesus do that and yet
[46:04] he could get so deceived where he would
[46:06] not eat with Jews or Gentiles anymore
[46:09] so we've got to Humble ourselves Church
[46:10] we've got to make sure that we're
[46:12] willing to be corrected because I say
[46:14] like this we've got to be willing for
[46:15] God more of God's spirit to be poured
[46:17] out on us amen
[46:19] and so see you know and we got to
[46:21] remember God's spirit being poured out
[46:23] is not always what is it's not always
[46:25] going to be shouting
[46:26] it's not always going to be praising God
[46:28] sometimes it's going to be you on your
[46:30] face apologizing before God that's God's
[46:33] spirit on us
[46:35] and the church said
[46:36] it's not always to me running around the
[46:38] church or it's always going to be
[46:39] jumping or shouting or speaking in
[46:40] tongues or glorifying God or God in
[46:42] America sometimes it's going to be I'm
[46:44] saying I'm the one that should be blamed
[46:46] Hallelujah
[46:48] that I'm willing to say I'm sorry
[46:50] because it was my fault of course that's
[46:52] what we need remember that fourth ground
[46:54] that good heart was called just good and
[46:56] honest that's what we need honest
[46:58] message Christians praise God
[47:01] honest Christians
[47:02] that's what we need today
[47:04] so I just want to that wasn't really my
[47:06] notes I felt I might say that as I was
[47:08] thinking about it
[47:10] but remember just because you're elect
[47:12] doesn't mean you're going to be perfect
[47:15] because you're elect there's nothing
[47:17] going to separate you from the love of
[47:19] Christ hallelujah amen that's what I
[47:22] mean I'm chosen to ultimately receive
[47:24] salvation I'm chosen to go to heaven I'm
[47:27] chosen to be with Jesus for eternity
[47:29] praise God
[47:30] that doesn't mean I'm not going to have
[47:32] stumbling stones on there or stumbling
[47:34] blocks on the way here
[47:35] doesn't mean I'm I'm going to be totally
[47:37] blameless my whole life and that's
[47:40] something Peter's one that said be
[47:41] blameless too
[47:42] Paul laid out Paul laid out the
[47:45] requirements for a bishop a preacher and
[47:48] a pastor and he said blameless so there
[47:51] you go there's a good balance that never
[47:52] came to me till just now
[47:54] teachers in other words we don't have to
[47:55] be spotless
[47:57] we don't have to be perfect
[47:59] God knows we're going to fall short but
[48:01] we should be striving to be perfect
[48:04] we should be willing to be corrected by
[48:06] the Holy Spirit that's right Paul said
[48:08] the bishop must be blameless well here's
[48:10] Peter a bishop and he's the one to be
[48:13] blamed
[48:14] church I today I'm trusting in the grace
[48:16] of God
[48:18] praise the Lord his Mercy's more brother
[48:20] amen praise God his Mercy is greater
[48:23] than my sins Hallelujah
[48:25] see we're in other words like as a
[48:27] pastor I'm striving to be hospitable
[48:29] I'm striving to be blameless
[48:31] but sometimes I'm not hospitable
[48:33] sometimes I'm not blameless
[48:35] right
[48:37] sometimes I fall short of God's glory
[48:39] sometimes I'm not apt to teach sometimes
[48:41] I forget the answers to some of these
[48:42] questions you guys ask and you ask some
[48:44] good questions
[48:46] sometimes I can't answer I need to well
[48:48] can somebody help me out there can
[48:49] somebody give me a I can't I'm not real
[48:51] fresh on that question anymore
[48:53] see we're gonna fall short but the grace
[48:56] of God because I have this the spirit of
[48:57] God is going to be poured on us afresh
[48:59] to have a fresh start amen
[49:01] Glory now let me get to this here
[49:04] um I'm not even
[49:07] not even halfway through sharing some of
[49:10] the things just in this book I made it
[49:11] through most of the other book that I
[49:12] preached
[49:13] but just just a background remember
[49:16] this revival in Los Angeles started
[49:18] because there had been previous revivals
[49:21] in the late 1800s there's a Revival in
[49:25] Kansas I'm not mistaken and then in 1904
[49:27] there was a Revival in Wales through
[49:30] Evan Roberts and I got his journal over
[49:32] there I read it years ago I'm going to
[49:33] read it again by God's grace
[49:35] and learn about Revival again because we
[49:38] need Revival praise God
[49:40] we want God to pour out his Spirit
[49:42] praise God
[49:43] church I found this I think you found it
[49:44] too the happiest moments of Our Lives
[49:46] when we're is when we're really seeking
[49:48] God
[49:49] praise God
[49:50] those are the happiest moments like
[49:52] think about like we looked at you know
[49:54] remember I preach on the glory and the
[49:55] Wonder I entered the service without a
[49:56] couple Wednesdays ago see what what do
[49:58] we always desire oh I wish I could go
[50:00] back and live that again
[50:01] those those wonderful moments what was
[50:04] in those moments it was just a pure
[50:05] heart seeking God
[50:08] it was just God visiting you it was God
[50:11] anointing you praise God it was God
[50:13] helping you it was God strengthening you
[50:16] so Lord give me that again once more
[50:19] Lord can we pray like Samson today amen
[50:22] give me some more moments where we're
[50:23] really seeking God hallelujah when I'm
[50:25] really down to business with God
[50:26] whatever you got to do God get me to a
[50:29] spot where I'm desperate for you and I
[50:30] know when I'm desperate when I see God
[50:32] with all my heart I know God said You
[50:34] shall find me Hallelujah
[50:37] those are those moments
[50:39] and George I found too when God does
[50:40] those things I don't even realize this
[50:42] is one of those red letter days
[50:43] until later I'm like oh man that was one
[50:46] of the greatest days
[50:47] you know I had a like I'm sure Austin
[50:49] probably feels that way about last
[50:50] Thursday or two Thursdays ago
[50:52] he's rejoicing it I found it reminds me
[50:55] that woman that found the coin brother
[50:57] she said neighbors come and rejoice I
[51:01] had a coin it was lost but now it's
[51:03] found amen
[51:05] that's a type of win in a soul brother
[51:07] hallelujah praise God
[51:10] and so this this revival it happened in
[51:13] in Wales in England and uh the the
[51:16] people in the United States heard about
[51:18] it so they sent ambassadors over to meet
[51:19] Evan Roberts and they come back and they
[51:22] said the way to Revival is Cottage
[51:24] prayer meetings
[51:25] prayer meetings just home prayer
[51:28] meetings in other words just say like
[51:30] this just praying more at home
[51:33] now is God a god of
[51:36] confusion or is God a god of simplicity
[51:39] and that's just that's all they did they
[51:41] went over there in 1904 they come back
[51:43] and for two years they just prayed God
[51:45] sent us Revival and specifically
[51:48] preachers in Los Angeles we're praying
[51:49] God sent us Revival God sent it like you
[51:52] did in Wales there and God did more than
[51:54] that God did exceedingly abundantly
[51:57] above above what he did in Wales praise
[51:59] God
[52:00] because they prayed for two years going
[52:02] into it oh it's a beautiful testimony
[52:04] praise God
[52:05] I think of this too all those years you
[52:07] know
[52:08] growing up you know my dad and mom were
[52:10] divorced but every night my mom I don't
[52:12] know how she did all by herself she
[52:14] would Wrangle up six kids
[52:16] now I got eight kids and my wife and I
[52:19] to try to get you know there's some
[52:21] nights where it's like where's where's
[52:22] so and so where's so and so right where
[52:24] we got to get all these kids in here for
[52:26] Bible time we've been waiting five
[52:27] minutes where's ever we've been waiting
[52:29] 10 minutes right for about where are all
[52:30] these kids at well my mom was able to
[52:32] Rally them all around every night
[52:35] sometimes later than other nights
[52:37] sometimes we weren't all happy
[52:39] but think about that for all those years
[52:41] for 19 years of my life my mom prayed uh
[52:44] God saved Jesse's Soul she said
[52:46] you know being a single mother the only
[52:48] prayer she had the only strength for
[52:50] prayer that she had was Lord save my
[52:52] children that was all she could pray for
[52:54] after all the pressure of washing dishes
[52:57] cooking three meals a day for six kids
[52:59] trying to work a side job to make some
[53:01] money all by yourself with no husband
[53:03] she said all the strengths she had at
[53:05] the end of the day was to pray Lord save
[53:06] my children Church whatever you got at
[53:09] the end of the day give it to Jesus
[53:11] if all you can say is Lord Jesus send me
[53:14] the Holy Ghost then you pray that praise
[53:16] God
[53:17] amen whatever you got just pray what you
[53:19] got but for 19 years she prayed for all
[53:23] these children to get saved and then
[53:25] thankfully on two in 1999 or 2000 this
[53:28] this old sinner named Jesse Smith went
[53:30] to the conference and got saved and my
[53:33] mother's prayer of 19 years was answered
[53:36] Hallelujah
[53:37] we got to be willing to pray we've got
[53:39] to be willing to wait we've got to be
[53:40] willing to believe God hears our prayers
[53:42] amen
[53:44] got to be willing to wait
[53:46] I remember for years I was going to
[53:48] Lydia Malachi's bunk beds when they were
[53:50] I waited you know I'd kiss him good
[53:52] night and say good night and then I
[53:54] sneaked back in there and I Lay My Hands
[53:55] on and I remember looking up to the top
[53:57] bunk I said in the name of Jesus Christ
[53:59] Phil Lydia with the Holy Ghost In The
[54:01] Name of Jesus Christ Bill Malachi now I
[54:03] laid my hands on Acacia filled them with
[54:04] the Holy Ghost now don't do that as much
[54:06] anymore because I'm tired and old and I
[54:07] forget
[54:08] but I have done that recently a few
[54:09] weeks ago I went in there and I laid my
[54:11] hands on on Haven and Garrison and
[54:13] Acacia sorry uh Nick Haven yeah nature
[54:18] of nature sorry Haven Victoria I'm
[54:21] trying to go too fast Genevieve
[54:24] I've laid my hands on Zion a number of
[54:25] times in the name of Jesus Christ save
[54:27] his soul one time he was up he followed
[54:29] me up to the altar he's praying up here
[54:31] and I was praying God filled with the
[54:33] Holy Ghost he just comes up here he
[54:34] wants to be like Daddy that's one thing
[54:37] I want to I want him to follow that that
[54:39] example not my bad examples at home
[54:42] or other places praise God but think
[54:44] about that if my mom or your parents
[54:46] were able to pray all those years then
[54:48] church surely we can join and we can
[54:50] join the faith and pray and ask God to
[54:52] save the souls Hallelujah of our family
[54:55] of our friends praise God
[54:58] let's have real Faith praise God that's
[54:59] my love when Austin shares that
[55:01] testimony if you've got to fire your
[55:02] testimony come up here and share because
[55:03] that's going to search somebody up to
[55:05] keep praying praise God
[55:07] that's going to serve somebody out the
[55:08] next time you know we lose something
[55:10] let's remember Austin's prayer I know
[55:12] the children will bring it up because
[55:13] they're really good at remembering that
[55:14] because when I forget all the things
[55:15] that you're like Daddy we should pray
[55:18] yeah that's right why didn't I think of
[55:19] that you know
[55:20] I'm in the midst of these trials I'm
[55:21] going through these these battles
[55:24] see the next time we need something
[55:25] that's going to stir somebody up
[55:27] remember God was faithful to brother
[55:28] Austin God is faithful to us God will
[55:31] answer prayer God is here God cares God
[55:34] Longs God wants Fellowship praise God
[55:36] amen
[55:38] well they prayed for two years for
[55:39] Revival
[55:42] it was a beautiful story
[55:44] they go from church to church
[55:46] here's a few details
[55:48] now what did I do okay that was from the
[55:50] last time oh I didn't get to where I was
[55:51] today's lesson here it is okay
[55:53] yeah before I move on remember Brother
[55:55] Anderson
[55:56] God's provided them one of the greatest
[55:59] revivals this nation has ever known
[56:02] so brother says the uh the Seymour Azusa
[56:05] Street Revival is greater than Charles
[56:07] spurgeon's Revival
[56:09] Calvin Knox great reformers even Luther
[56:12] think about that
[56:15] Luther came out of the Catholic church
[56:17] and he denied transubstantiation
[56:20] he stood against it even when he would
[56:22] have got arrested now Seymour was never
[56:24] on the brink of being arrested as far as
[56:25] I know
[56:26] he lived out his whole life died at 52.
[56:30] but Luther stood up was willing to die
[56:32] was going to be arrested and and killed
[56:35] but this revival was greater
[56:38] Azusa Street Revival
[56:41] see Luther was a time of reformation but
[56:45] here in Azusa this is a time of
[56:46] restoration amen
[56:48] Hallelujah
[56:51] he says it's the greatest thing that
[56:53] struck the Earth since the Holy Ghost
[56:55] fell on the day of Pentecost
[56:58] so church that little house on Bonnie
[57:00] Bray Street that's the closest thing to
[57:02] the upper room that the world's ever
[57:04] seen praise God think about that
[57:07] greatest thing the world's ever seen
[57:09] since Pentecost happened in a small
[57:12] little tiny house has a porch on the
[57:13] front maybe had one or two rooms in
[57:15] there
[57:16] in 1906 did they have running water in
[57:19] the houses I don't know
[57:22] did they have plumbers in 1906.
[57:25] we got an assignment cam no no
[57:27] don't know about Plumbing they'll know
[57:28] the history of Plumbing I think they
[57:30] sold out houses if I'm not mistaken
[57:31] brother Jose
[57:32] I'm not mistaken
[57:35] and here God pours out the second
[57:36] greatest Revival ever been done
[57:39] because somebody got devoted to prayer
[57:43] and so we need to be church we need God
[57:45] to guide us into devoted prayer
[57:49] praise God and again it don't have to be
[57:50] five hours a day but it has to be a
[57:53] hunger for God that's what it has to be
[57:56] no
[57:57] just notice here again God poured out
[58:00] his spirit in dilapidated old houses and
[58:04] buildings
[58:05] now we're fortunate we got a new carpet
[58:07] three years ago when it flooded remember
[58:09] that when it flooded we got new carpet
[58:11] the chairs are from 2015.
[58:13] about eight years old now
[58:16] you know got fresh paint there also did
[58:18] a good job painting out there for us
[58:20] it's about two years old
[58:22] you know we got we got nice things
[58:25] but having nice things is is okay but
[58:28] it's not a requirement for God's spirit
[58:30] to come
[58:31] I didn't get there but I'm gonna go read
[58:33] a little bit more Church those people in
[58:35] Azusa Street and that building they
[58:37] would lay on dirty old floors
[58:40] they're not perfectly tiled it wasn't
[58:42] nice carpet it was a dirty floor
[58:45] dirt on the floor
[58:47] and they'd be willing to get on their
[58:48] knees in their Sunday best
[58:51] they get on their knees and pray and
[58:53] seek for more of God whether they're
[58:54] getting saved or whether they're getting
[58:56] the holy ghost or whether they're
[58:57] getting Sanctified whether they're
[58:58] praying for their their mom to be saved
[59:00] or their dad to be saved they were
[59:02] willing to seek God and God honored it
[59:04] as the second greatest pouring out
[59:06] praise God oh my
[59:09] God used the unknown humble one-eyed
[59:12] black preacher one item
[59:15] in a world ruled by white men God
[59:17] bypassed the white man and went to a
[59:19] black man
[59:22] right we're talking this is Henry
[59:24] fordtime the first millionaire with the
[59:26] automobile they said you got a million
[59:28] dollars what do you want now 2 million
[59:30] the eyes are never the lust of the eyes
[59:31] are never satisfied
[59:34] look he Henry Ford was working on on the
[59:36] automotive he was working on the
[59:38] spiritual and and Seymour was working on
[59:40] the spiritual praise God oh my look at
[59:43] that two men two great men at the turn
[59:45] of the century
[59:46] who I want to ask you who is great in
[59:48] God's eyes
[59:50] was it the smart businessman I mean I
[59:52] thank God for the cars you guys got to
[59:53] the Revival back or the yeah it might be
[59:55] a Revival
[59:57] the youth meeting him back I thank God
[59:59] for that but what was more beneficial
[1:00:01] for society it was Seymour amen the man
[1:00:04] that was seeking God the one-eyed man
[1:00:07] who believed God's word and just
[1:00:08] preached God's word let's believe God's
[1:00:10] word let's preach God's word let's pray
[1:00:13] for God's word to come to pass amen
[1:00:16] let's keep praying for God's word to
[1:00:18] come to pass don't ever give up on God
[1:00:20] his timing is perfect praise God
[1:00:24] church this is you know in that book it
[1:00:26] estimated right now there are 600
[1:00:28] million people on Earth right now just
[1:00:29] 600 million that have say they're
[1:00:31] they're influenced by Azusa Street and
[1:00:33] listen church I'm one of them
[1:00:35] I'm one of them
[1:00:37] that meeting brought forth FF Bosworth
[1:00:40] who meet met brother Branham amen
[1:00:42] remember that how we can tie our lineage
[1:00:45] all the way there
[1:00:47] we are connected to there praise God
[1:00:50] we're connected and that's just 600
[1:00:52] million alive today what have all what
[1:00:55] about all the means that have died
[1:00:56] there's probably a billion or more
[1:00:59] people
[1:00:59] all impacted and I'll say like this
[1:01:01] there are billions of people that will
[1:01:03] answer for what God did at Azusa Street
[1:01:06] praise God whether they accept it or
[1:01:08] reject it thank God we can accept it
[1:01:10] Hallelujah
[1:01:12] thank God we can enjoy blessings that
[1:01:14] come from Azusa because people hungered
[1:01:17] after God people believe God still pours
[1:01:19] out his fear hallelujah oh he still does
[1:01:22] it today praise God
[1:01:25] I think it's okay if lean if I just
[1:01:26] share this testimony but the last time I
[1:01:28] preached this on a Wednesday night I was
[1:01:30] preaching that verse Acts 2 17. what
[1:01:32] happens when you pour out the spirit you
[1:01:34] get prophecy visions and dreams
[1:01:37] that's what the Bible says
[1:01:40] and just as a small testimony sister
[1:01:41] Lena had a really spiritual dream
[1:01:45] and brother also thought maybe this was
[1:01:46] something she had to obey right it's
[1:01:48] probably something she has to obey God
[1:01:50] wants her to do and God's given her a I
[1:01:53] say a warning and a blessing
[1:01:55] a warning and a blessing just days after
[1:01:58] I preached that
[1:01:59] this is what the Holy Ghost does that's
[1:02:01] what the Bible says your sons and your
[1:02:04] daughters should prophesy your young men
[1:02:06] shall see visions and your old men shall
[1:02:08] dream dreams on my servants and on my
[1:02:10] handmaidens like Lena I'll pour out my
[1:02:13] spirit in the days of my spirit amen
[1:02:15] hallelujah praise God like brother Jesse
[1:02:18] amen like brother Jose amen God will
[1:02:20] pour out a spirit on his sons and his
[1:02:22] daughters your son your daughter God
[1:02:25] will pour out a spirit on you praise God
[1:02:27] Hallelujah
[1:02:29] but let's be open to how it's going to
[1:02:31] come praise God
[1:02:33] how do you don't have to come as they
[1:02:35] were seeking initial evidence initial
[1:02:36] evidence it may not come that way not
[1:02:39] all speak with tongues not all are
[1:02:40] Apostles not all have gifts of healings
[1:02:42] but I got something thank God I might
[1:02:44] not have it all but I got something
[1:02:46] hallelujah amen thank God I got
[1:02:49] something Hallelujah
[1:02:50] if God pours out his Spirit on me
[1:02:52] something's going to happen
[1:02:55] I'm going to share this about sister Zur
[1:02:56] here but just be an encouragement to her
[1:02:58] when she first came in the message
[1:03:00] sister Karen Sanders from Lima was
[1:03:02] looking at or I'm sorry sister and I got
[1:03:04] the email did I share it with sir
[1:03:07] sister Karen Sanders and you met her at
[1:03:10] the Emma's graduation party you might
[1:03:12] have met her she had the glasses and
[1:03:13] she's an older black lady sweet sweet
[1:03:15] sister she's prophesied right in front
[1:03:18] of me on numerous occasions and I've
[1:03:19] seen all of them come to pass
[1:03:21] when she was sitting down there we were
[1:03:23] fellowshipping and she'd come to Akron
[1:03:24] to visit us and Sir walked by her
[1:03:27] and sir and and sister Karen turned to
[1:03:30] Simon said who is that girl
[1:03:33] she said the spirit of God is upon her
[1:03:37] and she said she has gifts that God
[1:03:39] wants to use amongst the people
[1:03:41] praise God
[1:03:43] now church does that line up with
[1:03:44] scripture yes your sons and your
[1:03:47] daughters
[1:03:49] does that line with the scripture the
[1:03:50] Bible said every man is given a gift to
[1:03:52] profit the body of Christ
[1:03:54] so we know she has at least one gift
[1:03:56] right
[1:03:58] but Karen thinks maybe numerous gifts
[1:04:02] well how do you operate gifts you got to
[1:04:03] be sincere
[1:04:05] like like brother mayor said to operate
[1:04:07] a gift you got to be consecrated to the
[1:04:09] spirit
[1:04:10] that means obedience that's what Evan
[1:04:12] Roberts says he said there's three
[1:04:14] things to do for the spirit of God to
[1:04:15] flow obedience
[1:04:17] get ready for the second obedience get
[1:04:19] ready for the third obedience
[1:04:23] we gotta obey God instead of obeying the
[1:04:25] flesh Hallelujah
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] if any good comes out of my life if any
[1:04:31] good gift is ever used in my life
[1:04:32] whether it's teaching or Divine Healing
[1:04:34] or discernment or wisdom or whatever be
[1:04:36] it would only be God it's only because I
[1:04:39] finally obeyed God hallelujah
[1:04:42] because you and I finally obeyed God
[1:04:48] what was it that was the Holy Spirit
[1:04:50] telling sister Karen I'm going to pour
[1:04:52] out my spirit on sisters there you go
[1:04:54] hallelujah how many glad God has poured
[1:04:57] his Spirit out on you for some time
[1:05:00] but I'm not done I'm still here that
[1:05:01] means I need more
[1:05:02] Hallelujah I've got it done with me yet
[1:05:04] praise God
[1:05:06] gets done with me and we either the
[1:05:08] Rapture will come or we're all stand
[1:05:09] around my casket
[1:05:11] you all stand there on my casket but I
[1:05:13] won't be there I'll be in heaven I don't
[1:05:15] know you can stand around there all you
[1:05:16] want praise God I'm Gonna Be With Jesus
[1:05:18] I'm gonna be with the Saints of moon
[1:05:21] hopefully one person runs to me saying
[1:05:23] my precious brother remember
[1:05:25] I know my grandpa'll be there praise God
[1:05:27] Amen Hallelujah
[1:05:30] hopefully somebody runs to me and said
[1:05:32] my precious brother
[1:05:33] hallelujah thank God Amen
[1:05:37] church is always going to come to the
[1:05:39] humble
[1:05:40] the pouring out of the spirit is always
[1:05:42] going to come to Humble people
[1:05:44] and God help us to be humble praise God
[1:05:45] remain humble here's a direct quote he
[1:05:48] said such a hunger to have more of God
[1:05:50] now this wasn't legalism
[1:05:52] he didn't say such a hunger I had so I
[1:05:55] didn't feel like I was lost
[1:05:59] such a hunger I had to make sure to feel
[1:06:01] like I had uh I had
[1:06:04] I had done enough to deserve this
[1:06:08] I'd reached my uh my quota
[1:06:11] on the number of times I had to pray
[1:06:14] he just he fell in love with God
[1:06:17] he just wanted to see God move
[1:06:20] such you're hungry to have more of God
[1:06:22] was in my heart that I prayed for five
[1:06:24] hours a day for two and a half years
[1:06:28] hunger every time we want to hunger like
[1:06:30] that
[1:06:31] I want to hunger like that
[1:06:34] we're in the most deceptive age
[1:06:37] it's not the darkest age that was the
[1:06:38] Dark Ages but we're in the most
[1:06:41] deceptive age
[1:06:42] where deception is all around us
[1:06:45] it's all around us
[1:06:47] and then we have all these uh cares of
[1:06:50] life
[1:06:51] right all the cares of the world all
[1:06:53] these battles mind battles like crazy
[1:06:56] we have all these things
[1:06:59] but I'm sure in some way Church don't
[1:07:00] you think some in some way in 1906 don't
[1:07:03] you think he had mind battles too
[1:07:06] don't you think's in some way you know
[1:07:08] he had struggles as well well first
[1:07:10] thing he didn't have a job
[1:07:13] he was a beggar he was basically a
[1:07:15] beggar bumming off these guys living in
[1:07:17] their house
[1:07:18] basically
[1:07:20] right
[1:07:22] the banker the uh the the the the teller
[1:07:24] the the his friend there where he was
[1:07:26] staying was a teller at the bank
[1:07:28] and he lived with the teller
[1:07:30] and he'd be the one praying he'd be the
[1:07:32] one seeking God
[1:07:34] well I just heard brother Adam say it
[1:07:35] last night brother I said if a man that
[1:07:37] got the Holy Ghost he don't care if you
[1:07:38] have to beg for his food or work for his
[1:07:41] food he said he don't care because he's
[1:07:43] got the kingdom of God he's going to
[1:07:46] you don't care if he has to beg for his
[1:07:48] food now to me I'd be ashamed to beg
[1:07:51] because of the conditions I've lived in
[1:07:53] right I don't want to beg I don't ask
[1:07:55] for money but brother Adam said and
[1:07:56] that's just like the beggar I just like
[1:07:57] the beggar in the story of Jesus and the
[1:07:59] rich man
[1:08:01] the Beggars begging can I have crumbs
[1:08:02] can I have crumbs
[1:08:05] see so when you're born again God wants
[1:08:08] us to focus on heaven
[1:08:11] God wants us to set our desires on
[1:08:13] Heaven praise God not so much on Earth
[1:08:15] but God wants us to be concerned about
[1:08:17] heaven that's why we just praying all
[1:08:18] the time because he was concerned about
[1:08:19] heaven amen
[1:08:21] Hallelujah
[1:08:23] he was locked out of that first church
[1:08:26] the woman Pastor I forget her name now
[1:08:28] Lucy I think it was invited him to come
[1:08:30] out and preach his message on tongues
[1:08:32] but then after he preached for about a
[1:08:34] week they locked him out it's a perfect
[1:08:36] type of Jesus being locked out of the
[1:08:38] church
[1:08:39] right I imagine he went out for lunch he
[1:08:42] come back in I don't know who paid for
[1:08:43] his lunch but he come back in I'm
[1:08:44] expecting to preach oh and the door was
[1:08:46] locked the pre the new preacher is
[1:08:48] locked out of his new church
[1:08:51] what a honeymoon
[1:08:53] what a honeymoon with the congregation
[1:08:55] right
[1:08:56] well that lasted about one week thank
[1:08:58] God
[1:09:00] what a honeymoon
[1:09:01] well I'll say like this I'm I believe
[1:09:03] that Seymour could feel what Jesus feels
[1:09:06] like
[1:09:07] right Jesus is on the outside of the
[1:09:09] church he's trying to get in let me in
[1:09:10] let me in let me in I said let me just
[1:09:14] be honest every service Jesus wants to
[1:09:16] get in our service
[1:09:18] right we either get closer to God every
[1:09:19] service or further away right
[1:09:22] every service Jesus wants to come in if
[1:09:24] we let him come in let's let him rush in
[1:09:26] amen praise God Hallelujah
[1:09:29] let's let him Rush In
[1:09:31] in other words what does he want to
[1:09:33] accomplish today well many times we know
[1:09:35] that through the preaching or
[1:09:38] also it could be someone after service
[1:09:40] who feels led to go pray for somebody or
[1:09:42] speak a word to somebody
[1:09:45] Hallelujah
[1:09:48] see
[1:09:49] and that's what we'll get to here at the
[1:09:51] a little bit further here
[1:09:52] Seymour this is his quote I prayed to
[1:09:54] God to give what parnam preached even
[1:09:56] though he didn't have it
[1:09:57] who's praying God give me that the real
[1:10:00] Holy Ghost and Fire with tongues and
[1:10:02] love and power of God like the apostles
[1:10:04] had
[1:10:05] now church this is what we can pray
[1:10:08] we can say I prayed to God to give me
[1:10:10] what brother Branham preached right the
[1:10:13] real Holy Ghost and Fire with tongues
[1:10:15] and all nine gifts of the Spirit amen
[1:10:19] and love and let me have what the
[1:10:21] apostles had amen
[1:10:24] make us such a reality make it real
[1:10:28] make it so real
[1:10:31] that all I want to do is talk about
[1:10:33] Jesus that people can see Jesus flowing
[1:10:35] through my life praise God
[1:10:38] I want a reality today
[1:10:40] praise God
[1:10:42] that should be our desire today give me
[1:10:44] a reality of God
[1:10:49] once the Holy Ghost fell they shouted
[1:10:51] for three days and three nights that's
[1:10:52] what the history said
[1:10:54] and it was Easter season the Holy Ghost
[1:10:56] fell right at the resurrection
[1:10:58] as the people came in they would fall
[1:11:00] under God's power
[1:11:02] the sick we're healed and sinners were
[1:11:03] saved just as they come in people would
[1:11:06] just come in and they just fall down you
[1:11:08] know the people would already be praying
[1:11:09] there and then they would just fall down
[1:11:10] and they would join in the prayer
[1:11:12] get saved get healed what a powerful
[1:11:15] move of God hallelujah
[1:11:17] thank you Jesus
[1:11:19] this is a this is a powerful testimony
[1:11:22] the second greatest
[1:11:24] second greatest nothing now let's
[1:11:26] compare that to the Pentecost Peter gets
[1:11:29] up there and he says we're not drunk
[1:11:30] this is what Joel spoke of and what
[1:11:33] followed that 3 000 baptisms amen
[1:11:37] how many people did Paul did Peter
[1:11:38] baptize that day
[1:11:40] Peter baptized all of them maybe baptize
[1:11:42] a couple hundred or something like that
[1:11:44] three thousand baptisms so people would
[1:11:46] just flood in that's kind of what was
[1:11:48] that's kind of what it was as Azusa they
[1:11:50] would flooded and get saved on the day
[1:11:52] of Pentecost they'd flooded and get
[1:11:54] baptized praise God
[1:11:56] it just wave after wave after wave
[1:11:59] people being baptized all these people
[1:12:01] flowing in and they cause such a trouble
[1:12:03] that they didn't have enough food to
[1:12:05] feed the people
[1:12:07] and then oh and then there come the
[1:12:08] first the first Ascension was these
[1:12:10] people are getting food and we're not
[1:12:11] getting food that's the first Ascension
[1:12:13] early church
[1:12:15] because sometimes we want numbers but
[1:12:17] sometimes we don't understand what goes
[1:12:18] along with big numbers
[1:12:20] well either way that was going to battle
[1:12:22] us right so we gotta we got to be
[1:12:23] Warriors whether we're a big church or
[1:12:24] small church God chose to be small for
[1:12:26] this season perhaps forever but we got
[1:12:28] to be faithful with what God has called
[1:12:30] us to do
[1:12:31] if he's if we're favored with little God
[1:12:33] will make us ruler over much praise God
[1:12:36] Hallelujah
[1:12:38] now Church did you know this building
[1:12:40] was previously a stable
[1:12:42] where was Jesus born
[1:12:44] in a stable
[1:12:46] it's a beautiful type Church
[1:12:49] that that second place we rented on Mo
[1:12:51] Drive I don't know brother Jose ever
[1:12:52] come there
[1:12:54] observer's there remember when we used
[1:12:55] to meet in that Mojo and had the garage
[1:12:57] door on the back that was an old wine
[1:12:58] cellar
[1:13:00] and how many wonderful Services did we
[1:13:02] have in that old wine cellar how many
[1:13:04] times did the wine of God flow out upon
[1:13:07] us amen ah
[1:13:10] that's a beautiful type praise God now
[1:13:12] this was formally
[1:13:18] for car parts
[1:13:20] I don't know the type there but brother
[1:13:22] Adam said you got to have Dynamics and
[1:13:24] mechanics to make the car run
[1:13:27] so I just believe we got all of it
[1:13:28] praise God Amen
[1:13:31] yeah I remember when I first walked in
[1:13:33] that Fellowship room there there was uh
[1:13:34] there was Auto signs certain name brands
[1:13:38] I forget the names and they had Mufflers
[1:13:39] in there and all these things like huh
[1:13:41] Auto Parts
[1:13:42] huh interesting a place for Auto Parts
[1:13:45] well God takes all those pieces and he
[1:13:47] puts them together and he gets some
[1:13:49] electricity and and some some gasoline
[1:13:52] and he fires it up and then an
[1:13:54] automobile can drive may God help us to
[1:13:56] have mechanics and Dynamics so this
[1:13:58] bride can drive into the heavens praise
[1:14:00] God
[1:14:01] driving to the Rapture praise God now
[1:14:03] that's just fun just to kind of type it
[1:14:04] out a little bit but that was literally
[1:14:06] a horse stable
[1:14:08] Azusa Street was a horse stable
[1:14:11] and Jesus was born and stable
[1:14:13] it was also a warehouse and Solomon's
[1:14:15] Temple included a storehouse
[1:14:17] all the treasures
[1:14:19] Hallelujah
[1:14:24] Heinz celebrates over to Old Auto
[1:14:26] automobile automobile Place praise God
[1:14:28] you know Perry Green's first church was
[1:14:30] a Jewish Church
[1:14:32] and brother Branham like it unto the uh
[1:14:35] the Jews giving to the Gentiles well and
[1:14:38] brother man like it unto the Holy Ghost
[1:14:40] was on the Gentiles and they're going to
[1:14:41] eventually give it back to the Jews
[1:14:43] liked it like under like that
[1:14:46] so there could be types here in our
[1:14:48] buildings but what a beautiful
[1:14:51] what a beautiful type that was
[1:14:53] this building formerly would hold you
[1:14:56] know animal babies being born but now
[1:14:58] greater than animal babies it's my sons
[1:15:00] and my daughters amen hallelujah
[1:15:03] the horses would be named but instead of
[1:15:06] Nang now they're praising God and
[1:15:08] speaking in tongues Hallelujah
[1:15:10] glory to God what a beautiful type
[1:15:13] now I just got a few more slides I want
[1:15:15] to get into a different thought here
[1:15:18] to kind of finish with
[1:15:20] their services were totally spontaneous
[1:15:22] they had no order
[1:15:24] they did not pre-announce events
[1:15:27] like some of you might have been
[1:15:28] surprised on Wednesday when Simon came I
[1:15:30] think I forgot to announce it
[1:15:32] but that's how all their services were
[1:15:33] everything was a surprise you never knew
[1:15:36] it was going to happen
[1:15:37] there are no special choirs
[1:15:39] right there's nothing wrong with that
[1:15:41] the Holy Ghost can follow when choirs
[1:15:43] sing right we know that they had no
[1:15:45] special singers or well-known
[1:15:47] evangelists
[1:15:49] he spent his time in prayer and he'd
[1:15:51] wait on God with his head in an empty
[1:15:52] shoebox
[1:15:54] you just wait on God and when the time
[1:15:56] came he would preach
[1:16:00] but the main thing about all the
[1:16:02] services was prayer it consumed all the
[1:16:05] participants the whole place was steeped
[1:16:07] in prayer you ever had a tea bag you got
[1:16:09] to steep it in the hot water right
[1:16:12] my wife tells me let it sit in there for
[1:16:14] 15 minutes
[1:16:15] then everything I want out of there will
[1:16:17] get into the water can go into me
[1:16:19] I can heal my throat
[1:16:21] but you got to steepener it's got to lay
[1:16:23] in the hot water
[1:16:25] sure sometimes we got to lay in prayer
[1:16:28] the lady is going to let it steep let it
[1:16:31] sit there
[1:16:31] sit there and pray don't give up after
[1:16:33] five minutes
[1:16:36] my Father in heaven Hallowed Be Your
[1:16:38] Name
[1:16:39] ah what's on Instagram now
[1:16:42] is that being steeped in prayer
[1:16:46] that's deep in your cell phone
[1:16:48] we all got them but we can't be steeped
[1:16:51] in those things
[1:16:53] they were steep in prayer they didn't
[1:16:55] quit after a few minutes
[1:16:57] they just stayed in prayer
[1:17:00] how many uh how many uh just recently or
[1:17:04] in the last few months have you stayed
[1:17:06] after from prayer or prayed before and
[1:17:08] you felt refreshed after the prayer
[1:17:10] this is God's way
[1:17:12] this is God's way to stay fresh or to
[1:17:15] refreshing yourself in the presence of
[1:17:16] God steep in prayer
[1:17:18] if you're I'll say like this if we're
[1:17:19] not getting much time a prayer at home
[1:17:21] then at least pray here
[1:17:25] at least pray here at least get some
[1:17:27] steeping here praise God
[1:17:29] if you can't Steep and what happens when
[1:17:32] when it Steeps right all the good things
[1:17:33] come out well Glory
[1:17:36] when you're when you are steeped in
[1:17:38] prayer all the good things are going to
[1:17:39] come out of your mouth praise God
[1:17:42] Hallelujah instead of all the jokes and
[1:17:44] the nonsense and the the bitterness and
[1:17:47] the whatever negativity when you lay in
[1:17:50] God's presence blessings are going to
[1:17:51] come out
[1:17:53] Hallelujah Praises are going to come out
[1:17:55] but the thing is you got to stay steep
[1:17:57] in the hot water of God's word amen I
[1:17:59] didn't know I was going to preach on T
[1:18:00] today praise God
[1:18:02] I sure like kombucha but that's a
[1:18:04] different kind of a tea
[1:18:05] different uh way to outbreak tea I guess
[1:18:07] or use tea
[1:18:10] anybody can testify at any time
[1:18:15] sometimes the spirit would fall right
[1:18:17] away and people would rush to the altar
[1:18:18] to either seek God get saved intercede
[1:18:21] get healed
[1:18:23] they simply prayed and God did the rest
[1:18:26] yeah that should be did did the rest
[1:18:29] so that was their testimony of all these
[1:18:32] years of Revival they just prayed and
[1:18:35] let God move
[1:18:37] now Church there's nothing wrong just
[1:18:39] you know there's nothing wrong with
[1:18:39] having an order for the service because
[1:18:41] look how God honored brother Branham
[1:18:44] brother man found the order in Joshua 6
[1:18:46] right
[1:18:47] praise praise God first
[1:18:50] then the word comes right and then the
[1:18:52] battle brother random says and then all
[1:18:54] the armed soldiers
[1:18:55] right there's nothing wrong with that
[1:18:57] look how God honored him
[1:19:00] right so nothing wrong with order I'm
[1:19:02] not saying hey we need to change our our
[1:19:04] services but I do want to say this at
[1:19:05] the end of service
[1:19:07] we should have a lot of sponsors we
[1:19:09] should have that's a time for
[1:19:10] spontaneous things to happen
[1:19:12] like I might invite you up to have some
[1:19:14] group prayer
[1:19:15] or might invite people up to the altar I
[1:19:17] might have a call a prayer line
[1:19:19] right and we know these things but God's
[1:19:22] got to be in it praise God
[1:19:24] we've got to be moved by the spirit to
[1:19:26] get into that
[1:19:27] praise God that's the thing that they
[1:19:30] had they would pray so long until they
[1:19:32] were led by God to do something
[1:19:34] praise God
[1:19:37] that's what I want to do I want to pray
[1:19:38] so long so I feel led to preach a sermon
[1:19:40] I want to pray so long as I feel led to
[1:19:42] reach out and text a brother or sister
[1:19:45] I want to pray so long until I know this
[1:19:47] is the decision I got to make coming up
[1:19:50] I'm going to pray so long till I know
[1:19:51] the right decision to make
[1:19:53] praise God
[1:19:55] let's be steeped in prayer so people can
[1:19:58] taste the so God can taste the blessings
[1:20:00] on our lives the Bible says the Bible
[1:20:02] says our prayers our sweet smelling
[1:20:04] savior unto God
[1:20:06] Hallelujah
[1:20:09] now uh yeah I want to get to here I want
[1:20:13] to just work my way to close with it
[1:20:15] with these quotes here in a few
[1:20:16] scriptures by God's grace
[1:20:18] uh yesterday I was listening to
[1:20:19] questions answers and I got I was
[1:20:21] searching for some quotes and I found
[1:20:22] this it's a really beautiful quote
[1:20:24] brother man preach on what is the Holy
[1:20:26] Ghost now I know Church we've had
[1:20:28] numerous people seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:20:30] we have at least five
[1:20:31] or more people seeking the Holy Ghost in
[1:20:33] our church
[1:20:35] praise God maybe more maybe more
[1:20:37] and church I'm saying I'm seeking more
[1:20:39] of God
[1:20:41] brother man said uh I just heard him say
[1:20:43] yesterday
[1:20:45] he said I he said he said I believe he
[1:20:48] said my name's written there he said but
[1:20:50] he said if I don't have what Paul had he
[1:20:53] said I'm going to keep this until that
[1:20:55] comes
[1:20:57] right
[1:20:58] what I have now has led me safely these
[1:21:02] 23 years praise God it's kept me from
[1:21:04] sin it's kept me out of the
[1:21:06] the the world the garbage dumps of Hell
[1:21:09] in the world
[1:21:10] what I've had has made me a real a real
[1:21:14] Christian praise God but if I don't have
[1:21:16] all of it I want more praise God
[1:21:19] amen that ought to be every one of our
[1:21:20] desires praise God
[1:21:22] then church those of us that say we got
[1:21:24] it we ought to pray until somebody else
[1:21:25] gets it praise God
[1:21:27] if we're such good examples which we
[1:21:29] ought to be
[1:21:30] if we're if we're if it's not if we're a
[1:21:32] real weathered and mature Christians
[1:21:38] brother Brandon said we're not fresh
[1:21:40] recruits anymore right I've said that
[1:21:42] before look up that fresh record we're
[1:21:44] not I mean we have we have some new
[1:21:45] Christians in here but some of us have
[1:21:46] been around going on decades
[1:21:50] then brother William say he had over 40
[1:21:52] years in the message if I wasn't
[1:21:53] mistaken over 40 years the message I
[1:21:55] know uh Brother Ray has over 40 years
[1:21:58] the message
[1:22:00] we're not fresh recruits anymore
[1:22:02] we should we should be uh able to hear
[1:22:05] the voice of the Holy Spirit and and
[1:22:07] yield and ask God to direct us to be a
[1:22:11] blessing to somebody else
[1:22:13] amen amen and I know he does the church
[1:22:16] I know he doesn't
[1:22:17] like we gave the example with Lydia
[1:22:19] going through that mind battle and Naomi
[1:22:21] and Beatrice and and Hua prayed for her
[1:22:24] and set her free
[1:22:25] that's what I'm talking about that's
[1:22:26] what I'm talking about right there when
[1:22:28] there's a need that the Saints Glory
[1:22:30] they feel light of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:31] they're led by the spirit of God
[1:22:33] and God's children are set free
[1:22:35] Hallelujah amen now
[1:22:38] now brother Adam just reads through a
[1:22:40] few of these verses now this is going to
[1:22:41] be good for all those young Christians
[1:22:43] but of course a good reminder for all of
[1:22:44] us who are have a few more years serving
[1:22:47] God
[1:22:49] now let's go to Luke 24 49 brother
[1:22:52] Brandon says brother Ram reads this I'm
[1:22:54] going to read it there out of the Bible
[1:22:55] Luke 24 49.
[1:23:01] brother Bram uh he's basically showing
[1:23:03] the difference between what churches
[1:23:05] today says the Holy Ghost is compared to
[1:23:07] what it really is
[1:23:09] there it is
[1:23:10] Luke 24 49 and behold I send the promise
[1:23:13] of my father upon you but tarry ye in
[1:23:16] the city of Jerusalem until you be
[1:23:17] endued with power from on high
[1:23:22] so see receiving the holy ghost in a
[1:23:24] greater measure is a promise
[1:23:27] he didn't say when but he promised I'm
[1:23:30] going to send more my spirit
[1:23:34] right
[1:23:35] I send the promise of my father
[1:23:38] and it's the it's the Father's Promise
[1:23:40] Glory your heavenly father has more
[1:23:43] power for you praise God
[1:23:45] your daddy wants to empower you praise
[1:23:48] God can I say like that layman's terms
[1:23:51] your dad wants to empower you with keys
[1:23:54] to his kingdom amen
[1:23:57] I'd buy you that car Emma or not did you
[1:23:59] or do you mind
[1:24:03] okay so your dad did Empower you with
[1:24:05] that car
[1:24:07] Dad provided the car right
[1:24:10] so my dad never gave once I couldn't use
[1:24:11] me
[1:24:13] so your dad got you a car your dad
[1:24:15] promised a car we'll say
[1:24:18] and then the power came to operate the
[1:24:20] car right the power came this is like
[1:24:24] Jesus
[1:24:25] the he said I send the promise of my
[1:24:28] father upon you but Terry ye in the city
[1:24:30] of Jerusalem until you've been due with
[1:24:31] power from on high so God promised to do
[1:24:34] it but you got to wait until the promise
[1:24:35] comes
[1:24:37] praise God
[1:24:39] said what promise the seal the Holy
[1:24:41] Ghost the sight of the Holy Ghost the
[1:24:43] comforter all these things I've spoken
[1:24:45] of times thousands more
[1:24:47] now look there's thousands of blessings
[1:24:49] of the Holy Ghost and the church said
[1:24:52] not only is he your sign your seal your
[1:24:54] comforter he's more than that he's your

[1:25:55] on God
[1:25:57] and church we've got to expect God to
[1:25:59] pour it out
[1:26:00] Hallelujah
[1:26:01] you have to wait on God you got to trust
[1:26:04] God if God makes a promise he's going to

[1:26:11] what is the Holy Ghost then it's power
[1:26:13] from on high
[1:26:15] not power from the bishop not power from
[1:26:17] the church but power from on high
[1:26:20] brother Chris and Lena whoever seeking
[1:26:22] the Holy Ghost is not power for me it's
[1:26:24] power from God
[1:26:27] 20 years ago I would have never thought
[1:26:29] I'd be a pastor never like I said I hate
[1:26:32] to go to church anyone I got saved I
[1:26:34] could hardly I could hardly raise my
[1:26:35] hands I was so ashamed of myself
[1:26:38] what do people think what are they going
[1:26:40] to say I was so I just spent all my
[1:26:42] services enjoying uh I was just I love
[1:26:45] the song service but I could never have
[1:26:46] any freedom now look at me now Church
[1:26:48] Look at me now I make a fool of myself
[1:26:50] almost every service
[1:26:52] I dance around and I praise God I give
[1:26:55] God the glory and I just love God Amen
[1:26:58] it's power amen
[1:27:01] it's a greater power than what I have
[1:27:04] praise God and God promised to send it
[1:27:06] and he said it Hallelujah
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:11] and then you've got to have that power
[1:27:12] on the job like I said they try to get
[1:27:14] me to buy a lotto ticket the other week
[1:27:15] I said I ain't buying a lotto ticket
[1:27:17] they said well you might win a million
[1:27:19] dollars I just looked at them
[1:27:22] not buying your lotto ticket
[1:27:24] I had a sister from overseas text me and
[1:27:26] she said brother Jesse she said
[1:27:28] um
[1:27:28] my husband and all my family are drunks
[1:27:31] and she's the only one that believes the
[1:27:32] message
[1:27:33] got a couple kids
[1:27:36] and she said we're at a family uh
[1:27:40] a a family gathering
[1:27:42] and she said they were all sitting
[1:27:44] around she's there at the table
[1:27:45] she said somebody slit her up
[1:27:48] a drink of alcohol
[1:27:50] and she said the pressure was so great
[1:27:54] he said she took the cup
[1:27:56] and she said she let two drops touch
[1:27:58] your lips and then sit it down
[1:28:01] and she said brother Jesse am I saved I
[1:28:03] said
[1:28:04] I said I believe you're saved
[1:28:07] and I said I believe it's the Holy Ghost
[1:28:08] keeping that out of your mouth
[1:28:10] Church how many times have we touched
[1:28:12] sin
[1:28:14] I mean really close to sin
[1:28:18] I wasn't going to de-christianize her
[1:28:19] and I don't know where she stands with
[1:28:21] God but I said it's a real encouragement
[1:28:22] that she felt so bad about it afterwards
[1:28:25] and that she didn't drink it
[1:28:27] she just let it touch her lips but
[1:28:29] that's what I was talking about earlier
[1:28:29] peer pressure
[1:28:31] right
[1:28:33] it's easy to shout around here it's easy
[1:28:35] for me to jump around here it's easy to
[1:28:38] I can shout in praise God hallelujah but
[1:28:41] let me go out there for a few minutes
[1:28:43] let me get discouraged or not get enough
[1:28:45] sleep some night
[1:28:47] right
[1:28:50] everybody's asking me what are you gonna
[1:28:51] do with this or what are you gonna do
[1:28:52] with this situation what are you gonna
[1:28:53] do about that everybody turns and looks
[1:28:55] at you
[1:28:56] see what I've seen is that Jesus is
[1:28:58] there in that moment to help you right
[1:29:00] in that moment
[1:29:02] that's why he give you the Holy Ghost
[1:29:03] for those kind of moments praise God
[1:29:06] I don't know if she's got the holy ghost
[1:29:07] or not but I'm thankful that she didn't
[1:29:09] drink it she didn't drink it down she
[1:29:11] just let it touch your lips
[1:29:13] think about church what evil things come
[1:29:15] out of our lips
[1:29:17] the church said
[1:29:19] she kept the alcohol from going I mean
[1:29:21] the alcohol touch her lips but didn't go
[1:29:23] down her throat
[1:29:25] I said be encouraged
[1:29:27] I said just be aware next time and just
[1:29:29] say a million miles away from that table
[1:29:31] right just use wisdom for next time I
[1:29:34] thought that was a good testimony
[1:29:36] because peer pressure
[1:29:37] that's a that's a real thing
[1:29:39] and Satan always does it not when you're
[1:29:41] strong
[1:29:42] when you're weak
[1:29:44] when your husband hasn't been treating
[1:29:45] you're right hasn't been paying the
[1:29:46] bills because he's been buying all the
[1:29:47] alcohol
[1:29:49] hasn't been buying food for the kids
[1:29:51] because he's getting drunk all the time
[1:29:53] it's the moment
[1:29:54] when the test comes
[1:29:57] discouraged don't maybe don't have a
[1:29:59] home church or not I don't know not in
[1:30:00] the fellowship I don't know I don't know
[1:30:01] all the details
[1:30:03] I'll say like this the Holy Ghost was
[1:30:05] with her
[1:30:06] the Holy Ghost was there as a comforter
[1:30:10] to protect her in that hour
[1:30:13] Church don't you know the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:14] going to be there for you too
[1:30:17] like I said a few months ago it's not if
[1:30:20] you're going to have those moments it's
[1:30:21] when you're going to have those moments
[1:30:23] right like brother amen was in the
[1:30:25] hospital and some family come in and
[1:30:27] just accuse accuse accused he could have
[1:30:29] gone off the handle on them
[1:30:31] but the comforter was there brother amen
[1:30:34] praise God
[1:30:36] all the accusing all the lies all the
[1:30:39] attacks
[1:30:40] see all the peer pressure what are you
[1:30:42] going to say about it what are you going
[1:30:43] to do about what are you gonna do about
[1:30:44] it
[1:30:45] but see in those moments in your
[1:30:46] weakness story in your weakness his
[1:30:49] strength is made perfect Hallelujah
[1:30:51] amen he said my Grace will be sufficient
[1:30:55] for you praise God in weakness
[1:30:57] Hallelujah
[1:30:59] like I'm now I'm getting on the Simon's
[1:31:01] message again I thank God for the
[1:31:02] mountaintops
[1:31:03] but I want Jesus when I'm in the Valley
[1:31:05] praise God that's what I want him
[1:31:08] because I'm in the shadow of death
[1:31:10] death is all around me
[1:31:12] none of you are standing by there
[1:31:13] because you've got your life and I'm not
[1:31:15] standing with you and you're in your
[1:31:16] Valley praise God but Jesus will be
[1:31:18] there
[1:31:21] what is the Holy Ghost brother Chris

[1:31:31] be from anybody it's gonna be from Jesus
[1:31:33] praise God
[1:31:35] how'd the power come by joining the
[1:31:36] church he said I challenge you to say
[1:31:38] that that's right by joining Church

[1:36:38] necessarily feel the power I was praying
[1:36:40] and fasting but I felt God just flow
[1:36:42] right out of me
[1:36:43] like I said people just they just every
[1:36:45] week or whatever they testify they can
[1:36:48] see God's spirit I can't always see it

[1:37:19] were set and appeared unto every one of
[1:37:21] them cloven tongues I come to fire
[1:37:23] they're all filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:24] and begin to speak with other tongues as
[1:37:26] the spirit gave them utterance
[1:37:28] now we're going to find out after they
[1:37:30] were filled they were sealed until how
[1:37:32] long how many here got the Holy Ghost
[1:37:33] let's see your hand there's more with
[1:37:35] the Holy Ghost than there is without it
[1:37:36] we want you to be one of us brother
[1:37:38] sister when you understand what it is
[1:37:40] what is the holy spirit it's the spirit
[1:37:41] of God dwelling in you to do the works
[1:37:43] of God
[1:37:49] Lord that should be our prayer Lord just
[1:37:51] do the works of God in my life
[1:37:55] I'm not gonna it's not it's not the
[1:37:56] works I want to do for God
[1:37:58] it's the works God wants me to do
[1:38:01] that's what the Holy Ghost is for to
[1:38:03] give you power to do what God has called
[1:38:05] you to do
[1:38:11] I remember when your mom
[1:38:13] you were just a little girl and you were
[1:38:14] bad on seizures I remember when your mom
[1:38:16] my sister
[1:38:18] of course I can
[1:38:20] she won't get that
[1:38:21] that was the night I danced two hours
[1:38:23] around the church I remember when your
[1:38:24] mom went up for prayer for your seizures
[1:38:28] one woman walked over and grabbed it was
[1:38:30] either you were Ali out of her hands I
[1:38:31] don't remember which one it was
[1:38:34] I can't remember
[1:38:36] a woman just your mom was just standing
[1:38:38] there I remember and a woman just walked
[1:38:40] over and just took her and your mom
[1:38:42] started praising God
[1:38:44] worse than God and your mom Allison
[1:38:47] knocked over she she knocked over the
[1:38:49] whole Pew so it was not straight it was
[1:38:51] crooked
[1:38:52] because her thighs were bumping against
[1:38:54] her weeping and crying praying for this
[1:38:56] little one right here
[1:38:58] to be healed
[1:38:59] and then she didn't stop there
[1:39:01] she come up to the Altar and she laid
[1:39:03] there from 9 00 PM till midnight I left
[1:39:06] around 10 or 11.
[1:39:08] because I preached that night and I
[1:39:09] danced two hours I was I was exhausted
[1:39:13] and look at her today
[1:39:15] can everybody see her by God's grace a
[1:39:17] real trophy of God's grace
[1:39:19] driving my kids around the country thank
[1:39:21] you for doing that we're not the state
[1:39:22] rather safety don't go around the
[1:39:23] country
[1:39:24] unless you feel that then you can go
[1:39:28] I'm just sales over my kids
[1:39:31] that but that that's
[1:39:32] seeking the Holy Ghost that's power
[1:39:36] and don't matter how God answers
[1:39:39] sometimes God will answer right away
[1:39:40] sometimes it takes years
[1:39:44] the investment came the seeking God came
[1:39:47] the hunger for God to move was there
[1:39:49] Hallelujah that's what we need a hunger
[1:39:52] for the things of God in our lives amen
[1:39:57] that's what three hours of prayer does
[1:39:58] it produces an MSL
[1:40:00] Ane Hallelujah
[1:40:02] I didn't plan to say that just kind of
[1:40:03] getting to me
[1:40:05] it's doing the works of God a mother
[1:40:07] what's a mother's job to do well she has
[1:40:09] gifts of the Spirit but the main job is
[1:40:10] to raise those children to love Christ

[1:40:56] spirits on you
[1:40:58] yeah I just had a woman email me from
[1:41:01] Arkansas this morning she's like brother
[1:41:03] Jesse I met brother brand I'm in the
[1:41:04] airport when I was a little child
[1:41:08] and then I heard about his preaching and
[1:41:09] then she said I I I I I was sitting
[1:41:12] there watching the TV and I saw the
[1:41:13] demons come out of the screen
[1:41:16] and try to get on me and then go back in
[1:41:19] because it's a real thing and look look
[1:41:20] now we got the screens right here now we
[1:41:22] got the screens in our pockets right
[1:41:23] here
[1:41:24] they hide behind those images those
[1:41:27] those words sometimes
[1:41:29] trying to get on us God will protect us
[1:41:31] though praise God
[1:41:33] God will he's our Shield amen
[1:41:36] he's our Shield
[1:41:38] I heard a preacher say that somebody's
[1:41:39] going to preach it to him might as well
[1:41:40] preacher I'm going an hour and a half I
[1:41:42] might as well keep reaching Thursday
[1:41:46] hallelujah it's been a long time since I
[1:41:47] preached so you got it
[1:41:49] probably want me to preach a little
[1:41:50] longer I don't know maybe
[1:41:52] if I heard a preacher say you know
[1:41:55] he said we need more offensive Services
[1:41:57] you know using the sword of the spirit
[1:42:00] or no he no he actually he said this he
[1:42:02] said we don't need defensive Services we
[1:42:03] need offensive services
[1:42:06] and immediately the holy spirit said
[1:42:07] what about the other five
[1:42:09] armor pieces of the Holy Spirit they're
[1:42:12] all defensive
[1:42:15] and this brother and they're the church
[1:42:16] that says God always wants you to heal
[1:42:18] God always wants to heal you we're the
[1:42:20] greatest of all time
[1:42:22] the bride is the greatest Christians
[1:42:24] ever was in the face and he's saying we
[1:42:26] don't need defensive Services we do need
[1:42:28] defensive services
[1:42:30] sometimes Church Malachi knows history
[1:42:32] sometimes those soldiers had to just
[1:42:34] hide behind the shields
[1:42:36] there's a story of the 300 remember that
[1:42:40] sometimes it's not an offensive moment
[1:42:42] sometimes it's a defensive moment
[1:42:45] sometimes it's camp out brother Chris
[1:42:46] digging your heels and just try to
[1:42:48] withstand
[1:42:49] attack after attack
[1:42:52] wave after wave but the shield of Faith
[1:42:55] Glory will distinguish every fiery Dart
[1:42:58] of Hell praise God Amen
[1:43:01] and then when it's your time to take the
[1:43:03] sword yeah then you can move the shield
[1:43:04] out of the way and then you can be on
[1:43:06] the attack and then you can overcome but
[1:43:08] not every piece of our armor is
[1:43:10] offensive there's times we got to be
[1:43:12] defensive God makes us well-rounded amen
[1:43:15] church I want to be a well-rounded
[1:43:16] Christian where I can speak the word
[1:43:18] sometimes but even if I don't have
[1:43:19] strength to speak to the word I still
[1:43:21] got God's defenses amen hallelujah
[1:43:23] because I know what it's like there are
[1:43:25] times I don't have the strength to speak
[1:43:27] God's word
[1:43:28] so tired of discouraged or whatever I
[1:43:31] might not have the strength to wield the
[1:43:33] offensive weapon but thank God for his
[1:43:35] defenses amen
[1:43:37] thank God for the helmet of salvation I
[1:43:40] know I'm saved sister Emma because he
[1:43:42] saved me I was there when it happened
[1:43:43] amen hallelujah
[1:43:46] I know thank God I got the I got the
[1:43:48] belt of Truth
[1:43:50] I got the the the feet shot with
[1:43:52] preparation the gospel of peace thank
[1:43:54] God I got a breastplate Hallelujah
[1:43:56] protecting my soul and my heart amen
[1:43:59] I got Christ's righteousness protecting
[1:44:01] me
[1:44:03] yes we have to have offensive Services I
[1:44:05] preach those on the Mighty Men services
[1:44:07] and he's dancing in the spirit that's
[1:44:09] offensive going on the attack praise God
[1:44:12] I went to the enemy's camp and took back
[1:44:14] what he stole from me that's offensive
[1:44:16] but not every service is offensive
[1:44:20] sometimes there are sneak attacks
[1:44:22] sometimes there's appendix problems we
[1:44:24] didn't know about we didn't know they
[1:44:25] were coming
[1:44:26] sometimes there's deaths in the family
[1:44:28] we didn't know what's coming
[1:44:30] but the Lord give us he give us armor to
[1:44:32] prepare us praise God
[1:44:34] how many can say thank the Lord for that
[1:44:37] let me try to close here
[1:44:40] what is the Holy Ghost it's the spirit
[1:44:41] of God dwelling in you to the works of
[1:44:43] God and then you'll do all these things
[1:44:45] that Holy Ghost pill Christians do if
[1:44:47] it's ordained for you to do
[1:44:49] you'll fulfill all your gifts you'll
[1:44:52] have all these fruits of the spirit
[1:44:53] right these signs will follow you in
[1:44:55] some manner you'll have some testimonies
[1:44:58] praise God
[1:45:02] he said when God ever sent any of his
[1:45:04] Spirit into any of his servants any of
[1:45:06] his prophets and and of his teachers any
[1:45:08] of his Apostles they were always
[1:45:09] rejected of the world
[1:45:12] they were considered crazy in every age
[1:45:14] there was even when Paul stood before
[1:45:16] Agrippa he said in the way that's called
[1:45:18] heresy what is heresy crazy in the way
[1:45:20] they call crazy a bunch of nuts that's
[1:45:22] the way that I worship the god of our
[1:45:25] fathers
[1:45:26] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:45:28] them yes sir that's right I'm so glad I
[1:45:31] can say I'm one of them
[1:45:33] I want to close with one more verse here
[1:45:34] this is the last one here
[1:45:38] uh
[1:45:42] you just come on my heart here so I
[1:45:44] didn't have time to write this one down
[1:45:49] it's in John
[1:45:57] there it is yeah John 14.
[1:46:00] John 14 16. I'm sorry it's so small he
[1:46:03] said I will pray the father and he shall
[1:46:04] give you another comforter that he may
[1:46:06] abide with you forever I love that
[1:46:09] forever
[1:46:11] not just in your good times
[1:46:13] the Holy Ghost will be there in the bad
[1:46:15] times too
[1:46:17] well then really is it such a bad time
[1:46:18] if he's with you then
[1:46:23] it might feel bad but it's still good
[1:46:25] because he's right there with you
[1:46:26] and all things work together for good
[1:46:29] to them that love the Lord
[1:46:31] see this is one of the benefits this is
[1:46:33] part of the power brother Chris of
[1:46:34] having the Holy Ghost
[1:46:36] you have a comforter with you who never
[1:46:38] leaves you
[1:46:41] even we even sometimes when you're
[1:46:42] tempted to leave
[1:46:44] him
[1:46:47] or leave the church or leave your family
[1:46:49] even when you're tempted to leave
[1:46:51] everything leave your job leave leave
[1:46:53] all responsibility even when you're
[1:46:55] tempted to leave that he never leaves
[1:46:57] you praise God hallelujah
[1:47:01] what is a comforter
[1:47:02] it's an advocate that's what John says
[1:47:05] little children in first John chapter 2
[1:47:07] he says be not discouraged he said if we
[1:47:10] sin we have an advocate with the father
[1:47:14] what is an advocate it's the same as a
[1:47:16] comforter
[1:47:17] it's someone who's called to your side
[1:47:20] called to your Aid
[1:47:23] one who pleads another's cause before a
[1:47:26] judge
[1:47:27] a council for defense a legal assistant
[1:47:29] amen and Advocate I'm glad I got a legal
[1:47:33] assistant who knows the laws of God real
[1:47:36] well
[1:47:37] sometimes I forget them brother Chris
[1:47:38] but my lawyer Jesus he don't forget any
[1:47:41] of these laws praise God
[1:47:43] and when I need help he's here to argue
[1:47:46] my case for me
[1:47:50] praise God and he's with me forever
[1:47:54] he's not going to lead me this is part
[1:47:57] of the power this is part of the pouring
[1:48:00] out of God's spirit
[1:48:01] that I want to remind you of today
[1:48:04] it's a person who pleads another cause
[1:48:06] with one an intercessor so Christ in his
[1:48:10] exaltation at God's right hand pleading
[1:48:13] with the father for the pardon of our
[1:48:15] sins
[1:48:17] he's also called our helper our aide our
[1:48:19] assistant
[1:48:21] you know the popular thing right now in
[1:48:22] technology is having a personal
[1:48:24] assistant
[1:48:25] somebody who can handle pay all your
[1:48:26] bills handle all your emails do all the
[1:48:28] little things for you first we got way
[1:48:30] better than that
[1:48:32] praise God
[1:48:34] Hallelujah we have a personal assistant
[1:48:36] we have an eternal assistant praise God
[1:48:40] Amen praise God any help I need he can
[1:48:43] help me achieve what I have to achieve
[1:48:45] praise God
[1:48:46] and then not only that he'll go to the
[1:48:48] father for me
[1:48:50] now say father you know Jesse did this
[1:48:53] but he didn't mean to do this
[1:48:56] he fell short of the glory
[1:48:58] he didn't mean to this father will you
[1:49:00] forgive him
[1:49:01] and the father smiles back and said of
[1:49:03] course I forgive my son
[1:49:05] or father Jesse's coming in here and
[1:49:07] interceding for brother Jose's Health
[1:49:09] today
[1:49:11] father would you please hear Brother
[1:49:12] Jesse's prayer
[1:49:14] would you please hear this today
[1:49:17] the helper
[1:49:19] he's the one that's going to help us
[1:49:20] praise God get the answers to our
[1:49:21] prayers amen let's stand to our feet
[1:49:24] he's the assisting God gave us
[1:49:27] then the Bible say when you don't know
[1:49:29] what to pray for the Holy Ghost will
[1:49:31] pray for
[1:49:33] how many times have we seen that
[1:49:35] I don't know what people are praying for
[1:49:36] and you go pray for them
[1:49:38] you don't you don't even know what's
[1:49:40] going to come out of your mouth but
[1:49:41] something comes out of your mouth praise
[1:49:42] God
[1:49:43] and it can sometimes go right to the
[1:49:45] need of the individual
[1:49:47] praise God
[1:49:49] let's have our musicians come by God's
[1:49:51] grace
[1:49:52] now church this is the time for
[1:49:53] spontaneous anybody that feels the Lord
[1:49:55] to do something now now's the time to do
[1:49:57] it
[1:50:01] the Bible says
[1:50:03] extinguish not the Holy Spirit
[1:50:07] so the preacher's done now thank God I'm
[1:50:09] done
[1:50:10] some of you are saying amen no
[1:50:12] I'm done
[1:50:15] whoever feels led to the holy spirit
[1:50:16] this is the time for them to operate
[1:50:19] if they have anything from the Lord
[1:50:21] any guess
[1:50:24] yes
