[7:13] this is for the videos were good on
[7:15] YouTube this is from a sister in
[7:17] Zimbabwe she says I want to write to
[7:22] appreciate the work that you do I came
[7:24] across one of the videos on YouTube and
[7:25] that's when I came to know your church
[7:26] website
[7:27] I missed it out of it you found here the
[7:32] videos a good summary of the spoken
[7:34] words that are easy to follow especially
[7:36] to a non-believer printed those
[7:40] documents I wish to keep them for my
[7:42] young children as a heritage together
[7:43] with the spoken word books about the
[7:45] Branham I have adopted your statement of
[7:48] faith I wrote a statement of faith on my
[7:50] website remember that we believe I wrote
[7:52] out all our doctrines major doctrines
[7:54] and put all the scriptures behind it and
[7:57] she said I've adopted your statement of
[7:59] faith and now it's very easy for me to
[8:01] outline what I believe so clearly I can
[8:03] now clearly explain the person why
[8:05] makeup is not for a believer as in line
[8:08] with the Bible also undressed in your
[8:09] videos are quite clear and I think I'll
[8:13] skip talks about her experience with the
[8:15] message or they do appreciate the work
[8:17] you do to give macaca dean you give you
[8:21] strength indeed you're feeding a slog
[8:23] even at us who are in zimbabwe number
[8:25] last legs we preach on the missionary
[8:27] work I wouldn't do missionary work well
[8:29] we're already doing a little bit by
[8:30] God's grace
[8:31] I checked it today we have 125,000 total
[8:35] views of all the YouTube videos on our
[8:37] church websites now that's 125,000
[8:40] people I can't preach too inaccurate so

[8:44] thought I would encourage you that

[8:50] thank reward for that knowing that your
[8:52] tithes and offerings that paid for the
[8:53] video equipment paid for our internet
[8:56] connection you get those videos streamed
[8:58] on there and live stream even today by
[9:02] God's grace so everybody has a part of
[9:04] that who's faithfully supporting the
[9:07] church and thank you for that I just
[9:08] thought I would encourage everybody by
[9:10] God's grace okay so I may repeat these

[29:42] Hey
[29:44] [Applause]
[29:56] [Applause]
[29:58] Oh
[30:19] [Applause]
[30:33] [Music]
[30:38] [Applause]
[30:52] [Music]
[30:55] [Applause]
[31:10] [Applause]
[31:25] like I said I'm trying to nail snot wear
[31:27] myself out you know
[31:28] after about two years of leading all the
[31:31] solemn service of preaching I think I
[31:33] could finally wear myself out to
[31:34] actually numerous times but I really
[31:37] gotta watch it
[31:38] else if I could have any strength for
[31:40] work and things like that but God knows
[31:43] you can just pray to God a race of a
[31:45] solemn leader you know it can be here
[31:48] every service by God because I'd really
[31:49] appreciate that but God wants me to do
[31:51] it I'll do it - I'm not going to
[31:52] complain I just kind of much myself
[31:54] for example like brother Graham when he
[31:57] preached the Thyatira Church age if you
[31:58] listen to that from 1960 he cuts it
[32:00] short because he says his voice and a
[32:02] little hoarse he said breeches last
[32:05] night because my voice is a little
[32:06] hoarse
[32:06] so for probably to do that I think
[32:08] pastor duty that is madam this God loves
[32:11] always - amen amen so that's just that
[32:13] take our Bibles that's what a Daniel
[32:15] chapter 7 I kind of heading them praying
[32:17] and preparing kind of felt we go back to
[32:20] the Daniel series tonight by God's grace
[32:23] so this is a message of prophecy I like
[32:25] Bible prophecy hey man why the Bible
[32:27] prophecy never even said it's the
[32:29] pastor's job to tell you what's in the
[32:31] Bible so that a five job show you what's
[32:34] in the Bible I love this do that because
[32:36] I love to see what go grab stuff and
[32:38] take you right back to the Word of God
[32:40] and show you how it lines up on the road
[32:42] okay so Daniel chapter 7 liquid the
[32:46] screen the first few verses the grace of
[32:48] the Lord
[32:49] Daniel 8 is a real unfamiliar one to me
[32:53] so I'll have to take a lot of studying
[32:55] pad for that one God's graces a lot of
[32:57] history on that you know anything about
[33:00] you know the goat with the horn
[33:01] everything like that there's a lot of
[33:03] symbols in there that I'm really not too
[33:05] familiar with so I got a little bit of
[33:07] studying to do on that I should say a
[33:09] lot of study the end of 7 remember
[33:14] Church we have what's called the state
[33:16] the Lord's brother branham in other
[33:17] words he's almost busted the Lord the
[33:19] fourth beast is rolled thus saith the
[33:22] Lord he told us to throw the mark of the
[33:24] beast let's take the Lord on
[33:26] watching the the curtains all these
[33:27] things like that so we don't understand
[33:30] a few little things well we do
[33:31] understand the most important thing
[33:32] right we do understand that so we're
[33:36] very thankful for that
[33:37] by His grace of mercy so Daniel chapter
[33:40] 7 let's just go to the verses one two
[33:42] and three let's just read those what I
[33:45] read verses wanted to myself and then
[33:47] we'll read three together in the first
[33:49] year of Belshazzar king of Babylon
[33:51] Daniel had dream and visions of his head
[33:54] upon his bed then he wrote the dream and
[33:58] told the some of the matters
[33:59] Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision
[34:01] by night and behold the four winds of
[34:04] the heaven strove upon the grapes eat
[34:07] let's read three together ready one two
[34:09] three and four great beasts came up from
[34:12] the scene diverse phenomena eight
[34:16] minutes our heads and I work Greg never
[34:18] you know artists make it on to God God
[34:20] give me anything have to be related to
[34:22] this message I could inspire us to
[34:25] preach something else
[34:26] Elleni father we love you tonight Oregon
[34:28] our hearts and minds are clear Lord we
[34:30] pray you've saying your song we worship
[34:32] You Lord God our courage is risen Lord

[34:36] tonight lord give me strength to
[34:38] preaching and to feed on your word also

[35:05] God to be a faithful witness what your
[35:07] prophet has taught us father who we know
[35:10] North God we are not to add to what the
[35:12] prophets that are take away those things
[35:14] there in the scripture so we thank you
[35:16] for your mercy embrace Jesus Christ name
[35:18] sure set in and out as you can see here
[35:21] please good maybe that's what the quotes
[35:24] and pictures you looking for so
[35:26] hopefully this works that's crazy
[35:29] okay Harvey praise the Lord amen
[35:32] okay let's look at this here so the
[35:34] tonight's service is called the vision
[35:36] of the four Great beasts we're look at
[35:38] that tonight
[35:39] Daniel series part seven are enjoined
[35:40] Daniel I just had a pastor out of
[35:43] nowhere
[35:43] text me today and said he said we're
[35:45] living in the days then you know he
[35:48] starts talking about Daniel things I
[35:49] just preached them then brother Brooks
[35:50] is preaching on Sunday to see how the
[35:53] Holy Spirit's really try to get us focus
[35:54] on these things I can't I can't
[35:56] orchestrate that didn't tell brother
[35:58] Brooks allows Regina tell this pastor
[35:59] you know it's actually better any size
[36:01] just let you know real fine minister I
[36:03] don't tell these brothers well I'm
[36:05] pretty I'm sure they're not watching my
[36:06] videos you know I'm just gonna they're
[36:09] not you know so see it's the Holy Spirit
[36:11] trying to get us this is my boys look
[36:15] past the man and just see the word
[36:17] tonight that will hear from Christ you
[36:19] know we got accept that and believe it
[36:21] there's a nice little picture that's the
[36:22] most humble picture I could find on
[36:24] these four beats up no one really knows
[36:27] what the last one looks like that's just
[36:28] somebody's idea code looks like a dead
[36:29] stop but that's just an artist's idea
[36:32] the first three are clearly describing
[36:34] the shadow so let's begin here and we'll
[36:37] look at this here Chapter seven here's a
[36:40] bit of background Scofield and other
[36:43] another sword said Chapter seven took
[36:45] place in 556 BC the first year of
[36:49] Belshazzar's reign so in other words
[36:51] this dream did it happen in the order of
[36:54] of the chapters it's the orders kind of
[36:57] mixed up not chronological order and
[37:00] that's in chapter 7 verse 1 the first
[37:02] year in doubt shoot up this means it was
[37:04] 18 years before chapter 5 because in
[37:07] chapter 5 there were the handwriting on
[37:09] the wall member that that was in uh that
[37:14] was in 5:30 something so if you do 18
[37:16] years you know matter
[37:17] 5:38 so this actually the vision
[37:23] actually took place before chapter 5 and
[37:25] how we know that revelation everything
[37:27] is not in chronological order understand
[37:28] that some of it is some of it is why is
[37:31] that well Graham says to hide it from
[37:33] the eyes of the wise and prudent and
[37:35] reveal it unto babes I trying to learn a
[37:37] vet so the lies get figured out with you
[37:40] go on somebody but it takes God's
[37:42] prophet to give us the interpretation
[37:43] and we can understand it because we're
[37:45] faithful to God's Word now so it's 18
[37:49] years before chapter 5 in which
[37:50] Belshazzar was killed and Ares
[37:52] need to go verb a bond remember that it
[37:55] took place 18 years before that
[37:56] remember when he did that that was the
[37:59] piece of hose that was the silver chest
[38:01] of silver right and arms would show that
[38:04] very night they went from the head of
[38:05] gold and the chest of silver but then
[38:09] straight in Chapter said his vision on
[38:11] she took place 18 years ago cutter okay
[38:14] and this took place like I said the
[38:16] first year was rate remember Belshazzar
[38:18] they say was either the grandson or son
[38:19] of Nebuchadnezzar it says son by the
[38:22] historians say was actually granting
[38:23] said I don't know yeah I'm out of the
[38:25] store I just try to study what they sit
[38:27] now let's go to verses 1 to 7 this is
[38:30] the mission of the four beasts now the
[38:35] Rd read verses 1 to 3 that's kind of the
[38:37] background and but verse 2 I'm going to
[38:43] read that Daniel speaks that I saw in my
[38:45] vision by night and behold the four
[38:47] winds of the sea strove upon the great
[38:49] seat I mean oh it winds on what man told
[38:51] us what winds are anybody know lavance
[38:53] is now winds in the bible 1954 haven't
[38:57] got time to run the scripture for you
[38:58] but we can go to this if it isn't
[39:00] answered correctly I'll get us on time
[39:01] the wind the for the winds in the Bible
[39:04] means Wars and strife now think about
[39:07] this like in jokes I remember the winds
[39:09] came down and took the sun's remember
[39:11] that and you want to mean is trouble so
[39:13] wars and winds means strike wars and
[39:16] trouble so that means these four winds
[39:20] bring about these four beasts or these
[39:22] four kingdoms and what did every Kingdom
[39:25] have Church a powerful army see how that
[39:29] works out
[39:29] the Babylonians how they are they cog
[39:32] how did Nebuchadnezzar conquer anybody
[39:34] knows Nebuchadnezzar come in to
[39:35] Jerusalem and destroy the temple anybody
[39:38] knows that he did it by force you did it
[39:40] by power right you did it by military
[39:43] strength so the winds represent a war
[39:46] strife or trouble through violence we
[39:50] can see that okay so that's verse two so
[39:54] he sees these big winds and it's wars -
[39:56] a Wars are stirring people up and verse
[40:00] three four great beasts came up from the
[40:02] sea diverse from one another
[40:04] all right now
[40:05] verse three there are four and a four is
[40:08] the same number of beasts as in the
[40:11] sections I'm sorry has sections in the
[40:14] image of Daniel chapter 2 verse 31 249
[40:17] so that image has four parts right gold
[40:21] silver brass and then iron and clay
[40:24] right has four parts will notice there's
[40:27] four beasts as well can we see that so
[40:29] we'd have the same number for now beasts
[40:32] are government or world powers or
[40:35] kingdoms started go to verse 23 the
[40:37] three decks I can show that to you a
[40:39] beast represents a government power or a
[40:42] world power or earthly Kingdom Daniel
[40:46] 7:23 then thus he said the fourth beast
[40:50] shall be the fourth one Kingdom so beast
[40:53] equals a human government or Kingdom
[40:56] everybody say Amen to that all right you
[40:59] can see that so these beasts are
[41:02] governments or kingdoms that rule the
[41:04] world
[41:04] now the seas it comes up out of the
[41:07] season the Bible thousands what seas
[41:09] represent waters represent multitudes of
[41:12] peoples and nations and tongues I'm
[41:14] going to read that revelation 17 15 I'm
[41:17] just going to turn there about God's
[41:18] grace I didn't have time to get that
[41:21] scripture on there a lot of scriptures
[41:23] on here about to get a chance to get
[41:24] down there
[41:25] revelation 17 15 all right the Virgin's
[41:34] no it has a little chapter I'm in the
[41:36] wrong each other okay I was in 80
[41:38] chapter 17 verse 15 I'm sorry a little
[41:40] bit nervous and you saved them to be the
[41:43] waters which thou sawest where the
[41:45] sitteth are people's and multitudes and
[41:47] nations and tongues how many like to
[41:49] understand the Bible of symbols I'd love
[41:51] to understand that number in 2016 I
[41:54] preached about I think I preached 13
[41:56] sermons on the symbols in the book of
[41:57] Revelation so it's really giving us a
[41:59] good foundation as we get into the
[42:01] church ages and eventually the rest of
[42:03] the book of Revelation okay now I'm
[42:06] going to give you a picture so I think
[42:07] you'll like this by God's grace
[42:09] so burst 4 speaks of the line which is
[42:13] the head of gold the babylonians verse 5
[42:16] is the bear with three
[42:19] I forgot what the ribs represent brother
[42:20] Graham said it and it's in the history I
[42:22] just forgot to look that up so I'm sorry
[42:23] about that I think it was three great
[42:25] conquests that the Medes and Persians
[42:27] did they conquered three other nations I
[42:30] think that's what it was when I was
[42:31] statement see how he bit them he's got
[42:33] the bones in his mouth he conquered up
[42:35] see that that's the Medes and Persians
[42:37] that's the chest and arms of silver
[42:40] where six is the leopard which is the
[42:43] ancient Greeks Alexander the Great was
[42:45] in there okay and that's the loin there
[42:49] the thighs of brass now verse seven is
[42:54] this iron teeth teeth two beasts okay so
[42:57] see this this guy had an idea it's kind
[42:59] of like a you're like a lion or
[43:02] something like Panther maybe the other
[43:04] guys I look like a dinosaur they're just
[43:06] weak Nevadan tells it just says it talks
[43:09] about the horns
[43:10] it talks about iron teeth that's all
[43:12] that's all the definition that it gives
[43:13] you so this represents the Romans of the
[43:16] legs and then the feet the Roman Kingdom
[43:19] is that how high God's grace I'm going
[43:22] to show you exactly what brother have
[43:24] said that this is exactly right each of
[43:26] these beasts represent the previous
[43:28] Kingdom that was already described in
[43:30] Daniel chapter 2 now remember now we're
[43:36] to go to the next one these four beasts
[43:38] all come into one piece in Revelation 13
[43:41] let me know that I preached on that
[43:44] before so let me show you that program
[43:46] tells us that these four beasts combined
[43:49] into the one beast in Revelation 13
[43:52] verses 1 to 10 so there's the picture
[43:55] now so we did a nice Photoshop job there
[43:58] on Adobe Photoshop but they put here's
[44:01] the bear there's the leopard here's the
[44:04] line of course and the last one is the
[44:06] ten holders yes if you count up the
[44:08] horns you know it's got a seven heads
[44:11] and ten horns
[44:11] somebody did a nice job on the Photoshop
[44:14] here now what does that mean I remember
[44:17] we're to get to and show you but that
[44:18] means the same demons that were in every
[44:21] one of these the same demons that were
[44:23] the Babylonians and Persians and Greeks
[44:25] are now in the Roman system that's what
[44:27] that means
[44:28] just so you know that's important to
[44:30] notice you're going to get a little bit
[44:31] confused it looks that dry
[44:32] behind there that's Satan right that's
[44:35] Satan and with that building there
[44:38] that's the Vatican see how that works at
[44:40] all it's connected in Revelation 13 and
[44:42] 17 and 12 it's all connected so I wanted
[44:46] to show you this shrunk down the
[44:48] pictures this is Daniel 2 so you know
[44:50] Daniel 7 and this is Revelation 13
[44:54] it's all those all three are connected
[44:57] all right you're all three connecting
[45:00] just the same four kingdoms is the same
[45:03] four beasts or save save more phases of
[45:07] the times of the Gentiles now I just
[45:12] this is I hold the slides to when I
[45:14] preached this last year I just pulled a
[45:16] few of the slides so now this is a beast
[45:18] out of the sea and this is verses three
[45:23] to ten revelation 13 was it is the
[45:25] current papal Rome or the holy or unholy
[45:28] roman empire you know what I'm saying
[45:30] you know and this took place verses
[45:33] three to ten revelation 13 took place
[45:35] during the Pergamos Church age which
[45:38] that we've already preached up emphasis
[45:39] summer nafferton ones who are decreasing
[45:41] on this and I read chapter five quotes
[45:44] on that so here's another picture if you
[45:46] want another one you probably member
[45:47] this one okay the head it represents
[45:50] that lion the chest and arms represent
[45:53] the bear the thighs of brass the long
[45:56] expressed represent the leopard yeah
[46:00] that should be up there and then the
[46:02] Roman Empire of course has two parts and
[46:04] then it divided now it's got the
[46:06] Protestants members of the Protestants
[46:07] and Catholics down there so it's really
[46:09] got four divisions now here's the
[46:12] prophets revelation here's what I've
[46:14] said about how those four beasts came
[46:16] into one beast here's what he told
[46:18] here's what he taught this is from 1954
[46:20] now we got two things under
[46:21] consideration watch this beast it had
[46:23] four different characters in it if
[46:24] you'll take Daniel 7 you who are marking
[46:27] it down Daniel 7 Daniel saw the same
[46:29] vision as John 800 years before Saul the
[46:33] vision he saw those beasts separate from
[46:36] one another in the beginning of the
[46:37] Gentile ruling and here they are John
[46:40] sees in revelation 13 at the end of the
[46:43] Gentile ruling all four the Beast
[46:46] presented in one piece them same old
[46:49] Devils amen
[46:51] demons that possess each kingdom of the
[46:54] Romans down through the Greeks and so
[46:56] forth now to the Gentile dispensation
[46:58] has come right now and all that up in
[47:01] one beast does that help you by God's
[47:04] grace amen I hope it helps you by the
[47:06] grace of the Lord now sort of verse
[47:09] eight actually know it let's read verses
[47:11] four five and six let's read verses four
[47:14] you've ever read those yet let's go back
[47:15] to Daniel 7 verse four
[47:18] then you'll be real familiar with it at
[47:21] least for a while unless you forget you
[47:23] know you just tend to forget things over
[47:25] the years but it's good to review it and
[47:26] good to understand it now because you
[47:30] never know and there might be a preacher
[47:32] sitting in here maybe now Cotter have
[47:33] you never know and they need to know the
[47:36] Word of God sisters need to know - I'm
[47:37] just saying if you want to know really
[47:39] deep you got to study it amen and you'll
[47:43] find Malachi right if they never go up
[47:44] to be preacher you'll find you'll
[47:46] remember it more after you teach it and
[47:49] that's true about our sisters you know
[47:50] they teach the younger sisters or you
[47:52] know teach their children anything like
[47:53] that
[47:53] whenever you teach something yourself
[47:55] you'll remember it a lot longer that's
[47:58] what the Bible says teach these things
[48:00] to faithful men so how do I know I don't
[48:02] have a another preacher sit down here
[48:04] that might win souls to the kingdom of
[48:05] God how do I know
[48:06] so what I got to do I got teach them
[48:08] thankfully the Word of God that's
[48:10] exactly right
[48:10] I'm not going to just say it's your
[48:12] mighty I'm showing you our program says
[48:13] about it that's that's our desire stay
[48:16] with the message okay
[48:18] Daniel 7 verse 4 now the first was like
[48:21] a lion now Lydia Malachi knew brother
[48:23] have you guys get ready to read it
[48:24] that'd be ok I'm a reverse for first for
[48:27] the first was like a lion and had
[48:29] eagle's wings I beheld - the wings that
[48:31] were plucked and it was lifted up from
[48:33] the earth and they stand upon the feet
[48:36] as a man and a man's heart was given to
[48:39] it now some people think that refers to
[48:40] Nebuchadnezzar's remember how he started
[48:42] off he was remember he started off as a
[48:44] man got the heart of a beast and then
[48:46] got the heart of a man again so many
[48:48] people think that's what it refers to
[48:49] I'm not sure that's what people think
[48:52] now who would like to read the verse 5
[48:55] we would like to write adam and then now
[48:56] kind of 6 and Lydia 7 that ok thank you
[48:59] but
[48:59] and people with another piece a second
[49:02] Lake to the beer and raised up itself on
[49:06] one side and had three ribs in the mouth
[49:09] event between the teeth of it and they
[49:12] said thus unto it arise and devour much
[49:15] flesh thank you sir that's the scripture
[49:18] about the bear program tells us that is
[49:20] the meats of Persians so Babylon is the
[49:24] lion like with eagle winks bears needs a
[49:26] Persian and you know what let me just
[49:27] tell you is not just brother Branham
[49:29] says that means a person's almost every
[49:32] historian I've read says that they all
[49:33] agree on that remember program did say
[49:36] those those four kingdoms are the state
[49:39] of the Lord he said Rome will rule until
[49:41] the end time when the stone has kind of
[49:43] mounted smashes that image at the feet
[49:46] it doesn't have the head the chest or
[49:48] the god it's the feet if the Catholics
[49:51] and Protestants amen that's right
[49:54] judging them for their unfaithful
[49:56] doctrines and life of sin and rejection
[49:59] of God's Word that's right okay so now
[50:02] Kai can you get verse six the leopard
[50:04] please sir after this I beheld and lo
[50:08] another like a leopard which had upon
[50:09] the back of it four wings of a fowl the
[50:12] Beast also had four heads in the minion
[50:15] was given to it yeah I don't know the
[50:17] symbols here I don't know what the wings
[50:18] is headstand poor off the look that up I
[50:21] get a chance to look at them okay
[50:23] Lydia verse 7 firstly stressful terrible
[50:32] and started seeing me and had great iron
[50:34] teeth it devoured and brake in pieces
[50:36] stands the residue with the feet of it
[50:39] and it was diverse from all the beasts
[50:42] that were before in head and alright
[50:45] thank you
[50:47] okay so now we got the definition or we
[50:50] got just the the understanding of that
[50:52] now don't forget that fourth beast I
[50:55] know we talked about a lot but the
[50:58] chapter ends up by going and just
[51:00] focusing on the fourth beast if you ever
[51:02] read Daniel chapter 7 he kind of takes a
[51:04] break in the middle takes us a
[51:06] knife-throwing judgment and then he goes
[51:08] back and he teaches us more about that
[51:11] fourth beast
[51:13] why because we need it in this hour not
[51:16] just Oscars not just the judge Osmond
[51:18] who else also needs that teaching the
[51:20] Jews because they're the ones that
[51:22] really have to fight it will get the
[51:24] very beginning of it as they change the
[51:26] laws right but that does the calculus of
[51:27] Protestants will change the walls break
[51:29] a squeeze upon us close our doors stop
[51:31] us from frigid that's what brother
[51:32] granite taught us but that we won't have
[51:35] a war against the Beast but I'll tell
[51:37] you the Jews are going to have a war
[51:39] against this peace
[51:39] that's exactly right that's the
[51:41] scripture and we'll look at that tonight
[51:42] if you've got the time
[51:43] okay verse eight let's read that I'll
[51:45] reverse eight and then maybe I'll have
[51:46] some other maybe those people read with
[51:49] me again verse 18 I consider the horns
[51:52] now we're look at the horns of this
[51:54] fourth beast and behold there came up
[51:58] among them another little horn so this
[52:00] is like an eleventh horn it's like an
[52:03] eleventh horn it comes up now what are
[52:05] the horns again ten keys and that's in
[52:08] revelation 17 now I believe those ten
[52:11] Kings program said it are ten kind of
[52:14] communist accrual errs at the end time
[52:16] that gives them power to roam for one
[52:19] hour but then they hate her after the
[52:21] hour and then they destroy her it's
[52:23] really quite striking
[52:26] so these horns are future well thank you
[52:28] so you know from what I understand but
[52:31] up comes a little horn and we know that
[52:33] little hornets you might know the
[52:36] Antichrist it's the person Antichrist
[52:38] it's the Pope so let's look at this year
[52:41] now here's the slide I'm going to show
[52:44] it to you so I just zoomed it up
[52:45] remember he just has ten horns I don't
[52:48] see little horn coming up on this one
[52:49] less I missed it did I miss it
[52:51] somebody three four five okay I don't
[52:55] see a little more coming up okay so I
[52:56] was trying to get the pictures are here
[52:58] now brother ran up top the little horn
[53:01] was a hold let me show you the quote
[53:03] next I believe it will be on us I'm
[53:06] saying now this is me I believe it will
[53:07] be on a future
[53:09] false prophet for the person the
[53:12] Antichrist
[53:13] okay now go to Revelation 19 25 gotcha
[53:16] by was it
[53:17] relations 19 already this one - I'll
[53:19] probably get there first so I don't
[53:22] where I'm going so late at night - each
[53:23] one now look we got all these symbols
[53:26] here
[53:27] and the Beast was taken and with him the
[53:31] false prophet that wrought miracles
[53:33] before him which he deceived I'm sorry
[53:36] which he deceived them that had to
[53:38] receive the mark of the beast and then
[53:40] they worshipped His image and they were
[53:42] these both were cast alive into the lake
[53:44] of fire burning with brimstone all right
[53:45] never see that you have two separate
[53:47] things here you have a beast and you
[53:49] have a false prophet
[53:50] who's the false prophet that works
[53:53] hand-in-hand with the beast that
[53:54] performs miracles that has to be the
[53:56] Pope because it's one man it's one false
[54:00] prophet the Beast for the RAM says is
[54:02] the demonic spear of wrong so there is
[54:05] one demonic power by that not know how
[54:07] to explain this to you and I really
[54:09] don't explain to know myself but there's
[54:11] like a demon there's one powerful demon
[54:13] and he is like this he's the spirit of
[54:16] Rome okay I don't know because that's
[54:19] that's what the Beast is because the
[54:20] beast and the false prophet are cast
[54:23] alive and like a fire and I got closer I
[54:25] can show your mother and said anyone
[54:27] knows the Beast is wrong okay so it's
[54:30] like a it's a demonic spirit of Rome
[54:33] some demon net is powering Rome and
[54:37] what's wrong do whatever it divides and
[54:38] conquers right just like the Nicolaitans
[54:41] doctor right it's a demonic sphere
[54:43] divided the church in Concord see that's
[54:45] what Saint wants to do you divide you
[54:47] other church right divide away from
[54:49] fellowship with don't fellowship with
[54:50] the Saints and that's what he does
[54:52] that's his tactic always is to separate
[54:54] the sheep from the flock and then the
[54:57] wolves can get it that's always say
[55:00] always watch it we can put around the
[55:02] message what 10 15 years as always we
[55:04] see that people come in for a while and
[55:06] Satan would pull them out and devour
[55:08] their lives but we got to stand strong
[55:11] you got to stand together praise God we
[55:14] Widow by the grace of the Lord I just
[55:17] want to show you that skirts for that
[55:19] proves the Beast is separate from the
[55:20] false prophet the false prophet is the
[55:23] person of the Pope the Antichrist the
[55:26] person but also you know there's a hand
[55:29] high Christ spirit right because John
[55:30] BIRT John and first John says we know
[55:33] that our many Anti Christ come out into
[55:35] the world already let me know that
[55:37] you have to make your words make sense
[55:40] right enough to make them make sense now
[55:42] here's the quote from 1916 this is
[55:45] actually right after he preaches the
[55:46] seven churches it's like a few days
[55:48] after in fact I'm sorry it's the weekend
[55:50] after he preached it because he preached
[55:52] a whole week of the church changes and
[55:53] then he preached the bird ten virgins on
[55:55] for four thousand mark of the beast'
[55:58] native on their program said now he's
[56:01] reading uh Daniel 7 verse eight let me
[56:06] go back to her just to make sure I got
[56:08] that right he's actually reading the
[56:11] actual scripture they considered I
[56:15] consider four horns
[56:16] yeah that's right yeah actually universe
[56:17] a so you got your Bibles amazing now in
[56:20] parentheses here we have his words that
[56:22] he injects his thoughts that he injects
[56:24] his interpretations I considered the
[56:27] horns and behold there get up on them a
[56:28] little horn before whom there were three
[56:31] or four those are three of the first
[56:33] horns plucked up by the roots
[56:34] I prepared said now we know were wrong
[56:37] there now see so Graham tells us that
[56:40] four beasts is Rome and behold at this
[56:45] horn were eyes of a man now remember
[56:47] this horn did not receive a crown it was
[56:50] a cunning thing the other horns turned
[56:53] to beasts he said this was a cunning it
[56:57] was a man Pope instead of pagan you see
[57:01] so see it was a pagan Rome like Julius
[57:03] Caesar and all them guys it was papal
[57:07] Rome see that so this little horn it
[57:11] comes up you have ten horns and got a
[57:12] little video or it comes up this is the
[57:15] end Oh yet pursue the Antichrist and a
[57:19] Bible said you had a mouth speaking
[57:21] great things okay so you can already see
[57:28] that how do you feel better now about
[57:29] Daniel said you feel better I feel that
[57:31] better by God's grace so now I know
[57:35] those four great beasts are actually the
[57:38] same four Gentile kingdoms that Daniel
[57:41] saw in the image of Nebuchadnezzar's
[57:43] dream which program calls the times of
[57:45] the Gentiles these kingdoms will rule
[57:47] over Jerusalem
[57:48] rule over Israel and rule over the whole
[57:51] world until Christ returns at the Mount
[57:54] or the showdown there to fill the
[57:56] 144,000 with the Holy Ghost glory all
[58:00] right
[58:00] so verses 9 to 14 brother Ram thought
[58:04] this portion of Scripture was the white
[58:06] throne judgment okay
[58:09] now the white throne judgment comes
[58:11] after the rapture right after Armageddon
[58:15] it comes after the Millennium after the
[58:19] Battle of Gog and a god then comes the
[58:21] white throne judgment every with me I
[58:24] thought I'd throw judgment then you have
[58:25] the future home the New Jerusalem are
[58:29] you a man
[58:31] thank you Jesus is happy about that
[58:33] David can't wait to get out of this sin
[58:35] cursed world I can't wait to get a new
[58:38] body pretty sure I don't want that don't
[58:40] we don't want that right away but I want
[58:41] to live as long as God wants me to live
[58:43] when I can't wait to hang out at us
[58:46] sickness my battles temptation why is my
[58:50] flesh - Wow I don't let this silly
[58:52] I can't wake up I see him and be like
[58:56] him amen now if we can let's read 9 - 14
[58:59] maybe I get some help here Daniel 7:9 -
[59:03] 14 oh no I forgot my one great question
[59:08] I have about the Bible I got a few
[59:11] questions
[59:11] my wanted great questions in here and I
[59:14] think I'll share it to you after we read
[59:15] this ok I don't honestly know the answer
[59:18] ok but I think I got a pretty good idea
[59:20] ok now first night we start with Adam
[59:24] and then go Malachi Lydia okay when he
[59:28] reversed night and now Piper said I
[59:30] behold till the thrones were cast out
[59:34] and the Ancient of Days did sit whose
[59:36] garment was white as though and here on
[59:40] his head of the lake appear what pool
[59:42] his throne was length a very clean and
[59:45] Willis is burning fire amen
[59:48] I remember that who's this Ancient of
[59:49] Days that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:51] right and here's the revelation got a
[59:54] catch here's Revelation God the Father
[59:56] has never been seen or never will be
[59:59] seen
[1:00:00] I mean know that he's you know he's an
[1:00:02] invisible spirit so this first I could
[1:00:05] not be the father suffer from the Sun
[1:00:08] this has to be the Sun has see the image
[1:00:12] of the Sun because no man can see the
[1:00:14] father and this is how I was confused
[1:00:16] for quite a few years on this one and
[1:00:18] some people told me this and some people
[1:00:20] told me that another but that's why you
[1:00:24] can't take someone else's work you got
[1:00:25] to pray and find out with from God
[1:00:27] himself aim ahead and I'm not saying
[1:00:28] that God bless the Lord about you
[1:00:30] believe I got a good understanding okay
[1:00:32] so we see Christ on his throne remember
[1:00:35] this first reminds us of Revelation
[1:00:37] chapter 1 remember the Sevenfold blood
[1:00:39] of his person he's got hair like wool
[1:00:41] eyes a fire feet of grass after that you
[1:00:44] got the breastplate I'm sorry he's got
[1:00:46] that it's got a vesture over his chest
[1:00:49] you know I forget that extra words there
[1:00:51] forgive me but this is found the same
[1:00:54] thing in Revelation chapter 1 okay now
[1:00:56] Malachi 10 liddie 11 Malcom ointment a
[1:00:59] fiery stream issued and came forth from
[1:01:01] before him ten thousand minutes ten
[1:01:05] thousand thousands ministered unto them
[1:01:07] in ten thousand times ten thousand stood
[1:01:09] before the judgment was set in the books
[1:01:12] were opened it stop right there so again
[1:01:14] this is the white throne judgment books
[1:01:16] are open program tells that clearly is
[1:01:20] this isn't it strange can't you see how
[1:01:22] you need the Holy Spirit to interpret
[1:01:24] the Bible because the verses 1 through 8
[1:01:26] you're thinking okay for Gentile
[1:01:28] kingdoms fortune cookies and all of a
[1:01:29] sudden God like skips out of there he
[1:01:32] skips the rapture he skips the
[1:01:35] millennium and he skips the battle Magog
[1:01:37] Hill goes right to the white drum
[1:01:39] judgment
[1:01:39] see God loves to hide himself but the
[1:01:42] Bible said it's the honor kings to
[1:01:43] search out a matter a man he approves
[1:01:46] you're a king and a priest when you love
[1:01:48] to search out the Bible and understand
[1:01:50] what the Bible mean again that's exactly
[1:01:52] right
[1:01:52] but see if you just try to do this kind
[1:01:54] of actually with your own human
[1:01:56] understanding
[1:01:56] you get all mixed up that's we that's
[1:01:58] why we thank God for a problem now verse
[1:02:01] 11 Lydia may be held because of the
[1:02:06] voice of a great word
[1:02:09] I beheld even till the beast was slain
[1:02:12] and quite destroyed and given to the
[1:02:14] great okay thank you
[1:02:16] now did you remember that with that
[1:02:18] little army so this little heart has a
[1:02:20] voice right the Bible said the voice of
[1:02:23] the great words which the horn spake so
[1:02:26] the year there's these ten horns then
[1:02:27] there's this little gobbler and he's the
[1:02:30] one speaking now we'll see later the
[1:02:32] chapter he speaks great things against
[1:02:34] Almighty God that's exactly what 2nd
[1:02:37] Thessalonians chapter 2 says my this
[1:02:39] this is teaching the boy Brendan tied
[1:02:41] the whole Bible together same day it's
[1:02:43] his side all of those things are tied
[1:02:45] together we know where we are we're know
[1:02:47] where we stand and we know where we're
[1:02:48] going praise God
[1:02:49] exactly right enough to wonder about
[1:02:51] these things a prophet is told us now in
[1:02:56] verse 11 let me just put this in here
[1:02:58] because I'm not I'm not sure it seems
[1:03:01] like the beast that was slain on that
[1:03:03] that beast there might be used for the
[1:03:05] Antichrist I don't know or it might be
[1:03:09] that spirit of Rome I'm not sure but I
[1:03:10] know there's some there's some
[1:03:12] overlapping a little bit with the words
[1:03:14] that are used because I you know I'm
[1:03:17] just because the Bata the Bible says his
[1:03:18] body was destroyed and given to the
[1:03:20] burning flame now it could be the could
[1:03:22] be the Antichrist it could be the spear
[1:03:24] because remember the demon even the
[1:03:25] demons are cast alive into that internal
[1:03:27] fire so even the bodies of demons have
[1:03:29] to be destroyed which our spiritual
[1:03:31] bodies it's a little deep I understand
[1:03:33] than me too but just so you understand
[1:03:36] but let's just go to verse well okay
[1:03:38] Lydia Jordan Rita okay back to me verse
[1:03:42] 12 as concerning the rest of the beast
[1:03:44] they have their dominion taken away see
[1:03:46] that so that lion that leopard that bear
[1:03:49] they're done for it's this last one the
[1:03:53] one with iron the roll that's the one
[1:03:55] that keeps ruling right yet their lives
[1:03:58] were prolonged for a season in time how
[1:04:01] are the lives of those beasts preserved
[1:04:03] because they're in that final business
[1:04:05] the life of the first three beasts are
[1:04:07] in the last piece right okay now verse
[1:04:12] 13 now here it is here 13 or 14 is
[1:04:16] what's BB for quite a few years and
[1:04:18] here's why in verse 9
[1:04:21] at red we're told that the ancient days
[1:04:24] looks like right we're told he's got
[1:04:27] white hair looks like it looks like a
[1:04:29] man right here's where stumble being
[1:04:32] here's I'll tell you what when somebody
[1:04:34] told me we're going to see one life into
[1:04:36] the son of man coming to stand before
[1:04:37] him and somebody told me that this one
[1:04:42] like the son of man was the bride I
[1:04:44] thought no no no sound right uh but
[1:04:48] here's what stumble meet the one like
[1:04:51] the Son of Man seems like Jesus the body
[1:04:54] of Jesus I'm talking about the physical
[1:04:55] about the physical body that was
[1:04:56] crucified okay but here's what stumble
[1:05:00] me if you have the Ancient of Days like
[1:05:02] white wool right here like white wool so
[1:05:05] you have an image of a man on a throne
[1:05:07] and then you have the body of Jesus that
[1:05:08] makes it look like two persons that's
[1:05:10] why it stumbled me but here's my thought
[1:05:14] here we just hear this before we get
[1:05:16] here spice up I don't know I'll tell you
[1:05:19] if there is two there that would stumble
[1:05:21] me a little bit I'm just saying I
[1:05:23] wouldn't doubt God it's not one person I
[1:05:26] always believe that but I just wouldn't
[1:05:28] what I'm saying is I wouldn't understand
[1:05:29] it I wouldn't know how to explain that
[1:05:31] to somebody I would never I would never
[1:05:34] think God's do people or three people I
[1:05:36] would never add to the word I just
[1:05:38] wouldn't know how to explain but here's
[1:05:39] what I think would happen when the Son
[1:05:41] of Man comes and stands for the Ancient
[1:05:43] of Days the Ancient of Days goes back to
[1:05:45] being maybe a pillar of fire or
[1:05:48] something like that because in verse 13
[1:05:52] 14 the Bible doesn't say that Ancient of
[1:05:54] Days has a body it just says the Son of
[1:05:56] Man comes to stand before the Ancient of
[1:05:58] Days is that make sense what if I get
[1:06:01] confused as long as I see like two
[1:06:02] bodies I see all the white winged one
[1:06:05] and I see the body of Jesus Christ man
[1:06:07] and it makes it look like two verses but
[1:06:10] I know it's not because the Bible never
[1:06:11] says these two persons so I'm just
[1:06:14] letting you know that you got the
[1:06:15] revelation somebody tell me after
[1:06:16] circles okay that's alright that's a lot
[1:06:20] to save I'm saying I just want to be
[1:06:21] honest I don't know everything and I
[1:06:24] don't have all the answers I know one
[1:06:26] one person that does and will understand
[1:06:28] it better bye-bye amen but just listen
[1:06:31] if a Trinitarian brings us to you that's
[1:06:32] what you say well I would say I don't
[1:06:34] know
[1:06:34] but I know the Bible never says these
[1:06:36] two or three persons simmer understand
[1:06:39] that so the trinitarian bothers to me
[1:06:41] I'd say I don't know I just know God's
[1:06:43] out three people all right now verse 13
[1:06:48] and I saw the night visions and behold
[1:06:49] one like the Son of Man I didn't say
[1:06:52] this on a man it just had one liken of
[1:06:55] the Son of Man right came with the
[1:06:58] clouds of heaven
[1:06:59] remember he when he when he went to
[1:07:00] heaven member when he left on the the
[1:07:03] Great Commission number in mark 16 he
[1:07:05] was on a mountain and the Bible's that
[1:07:07] he left on a cloud so this is Jesus
[1:07:10] ascending to the heavenly throne and
[1:07:15] they came to the eight I'm sorry and
[1:07:17] came to the Ancient of Days and they
[1:07:19] brought him near before him so now you
[1:07:22] have a him coming before him Richard but
[1:07:27] he's not two people he's not three
[1:07:28] people what would it be it might be
[1:07:31] manifestations it might be more than one
[1:07:33] manifestation can God have more than one
[1:07:35] manifestations absolutely at Jesus
[1:07:38] baptism manifestations were the three
[1:07:41] there's a body manifestation a voice
[1:07:43] manifestation and a dove manifestation
[1:07:46] that don't mean he's free persons that
[1:07:48] just means he can reveal himself in
[1:07:49] three ways at the same time because he
[1:07:52] never said I did god I'm free purchase
[1:07:53] with worship yes Trinity the word
[1:07:55] Trinity isn't even in the Bible program
[1:07:57] I said thus saith the Lord that trade
[1:07:59] Trinitarian doctrine three persons of
[1:08:01] the devil he says he said we can't hold
[1:08:03] back on it any longer because the coming
[1:08:05] of the Lord is here so I put it on my
[1:08:08] video of the seven problems of the
[1:08:09] Trinity and they sure didn't like that
[1:08:11] one I'll be what in light of that my
[1:08:14] brother have said they're not going to
[1:08:15] help he said they're just sincerely
[1:08:16] wrong you believe three persons Isaiah
[1:08:19] if you swallow that pause doctrine
[1:08:21] Maxwell's mother false doctrines and I
[1:08:22] go to hell
[1:08:23] thank God we're out of that it's just a
[1:08:25] name Adam because remember what's the
[1:08:28] mark of the beast in the head it's
[1:08:30] believing the doctrine of the of the
[1:08:32] Antichrist and what is the folk belief
[1:08:34] of the Godhead three persons so see you
[1:08:38] can get saved and believe that but you
[1:08:39] can't be filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:41] believe that it's impossible no matter
[1:08:44] the greatest revelation the first
[1:08:46] revelation is the
[1:08:47] freak deity of Jesus Christ hey that's
[1:08:50] right
[1:08:50] amen that's why we get baptized in the
[1:08:54] name of Lord Jesus Christ all right so
[1:08:57] can everybody see my my I stumble or my
[1:09:02] lack of Revelation I'll say like that
[1:09:04] that's why I understand you have one
[1:09:06] life into him
[1:09:07] coming to him so he's coming to him now
[1:09:10] I see like this the Sun is coming to the
[1:09:12] Father that's why I believe that
[1:09:15] white-winged one change his
[1:09:18] manifestation I just leave you what back
[1:09:20] to you to Pillar five and then you have
[1:09:23] the body of Christ coming to the throne
[1:09:25] and the Ancient of Days now has a new
[1:09:27] form that's just what I believe Jessie
[1:09:29] can you prove that the Bible no but I
[1:09:31] can't prove to people I can't prove to
[1:09:33] persons either because I don't believe
[1:09:34] that you understand what I'm saying
[1:09:36] though it could be it could be the body
[1:09:38] of Christ before the glorified body of
[1:09:41] Christ but that's the theophany
[1:09:42] right that's a theophany that's a
[1:09:44] glorified body of Christ so I'm just
[1:09:48] letting you know if you have grown Jesse
[1:09:49] what does that mean I said I don't know
[1:09:50] that's what I I just gave him ideas now
[1:09:54] verse 14 proves that this is Christ the
[1:09:57] Son of man was Christ and there was
[1:10:00] given him Dominion and glory and a
[1:10:01] kingdom that all people nations and
[1:10:03] languages should serve him his Dominion
[1:10:05] is an everlasting Dominion which shall
[1:10:06] not pass away and his kingdom that which
[1:10:09] shall not be destroyed let me just say
[1:10:12] something here actually when he comes up
[1:10:15] to the Ancient of Days this might be
[1:10:16] after he raptures the hundred forty-four
[1:10:19] thousand - so let me just clarify that I
[1:10:22] don't know this is actually when he uh
[1:10:24] resurrected the first time I don't know
[1:10:26] if it's when he could bring him back
[1:10:28] 144,000 because it makes it sound like
[1:10:30] he's gonna rule all nations at this
[1:10:32] point okay so I I don't know I just said
[1:10:35] I just be honest and say don't now let
[1:10:38] me um go through this kind of quick come
[1:10:40] back let me set a timer so don't go over
[1:10:43] to I just see I get caught up in
[1:10:46] preaching you know I get all happy and
[1:10:48] everything I get stimulated by the Word
[1:10:50] of God and I'm not forget what time of
[1:10:52] this thing burn myself out now Daniel
[1:10:54] scriptures okay so six times the church
[1:10:57] age book brother random references
[1:10:59] the annual scriptures I just want to
[1:11:00] show them to you because twice two of
[1:11:03] them are Daniel 7 what we just read and
[1:11:06] then he connects those to the white
[1:11:07] throne judgment I just want to show that
[1:11:09] to you here is the sixth Scripture now
[1:11:11] you can you go oh I'm sorry I should say
[1:11:13] good I could count hopefully I can count
[1:11:15] so I want to say hopefully that counting
[1:11:16] right Daniel 2 is reference twice Daniel
[1:11:21] 7 well we just read this reference three
[1:11:23] times and the Daniel 12 is reference 1
[1:11:25] so that's 5 plus 1 to 6 so 6 times
[1:11:29] brother branham mentions the Book of
[1:11:31] Daniel in the church age book and three
[1:11:34] times he references this is the white
[1:11:36] throne judgment I just want to show that
[1:11:39] to you ok now here's the first reference
[1:11:41] he referenced Daniel 7 what we just read
[1:11:44] it in Revelation 1:14 how his hairs is
[1:11:47] why to smell it but I had to just read
[1:11:49] it and I already preset we will preach
[1:11:51] on Daniel chapter 7 chapter 1 see now
[1:11:55] he's company the judge of all the earth
[1:11:56] will be crowned with wisdom that is what
[1:11:57] the white and glistening hair signifies
[1:11:59] see this in Daniel 7 1940 we just read
[1:12:02] so revelation 114 shows what's happening
[1:12:06] it shows how Christ looks in Daniel 7 9
[1:12:09] to 14 okay so there it is danger solid
[1:12:12] white hair he was the judge opening the
[1:12:14] books and judging on them
[1:12:15] Daniel saw him coming to the clouds
[1:12:17] that's example John saw they both saw
[1:12:19] him exactly the same they saw him judge
[1:12:21] and his judgment girl over shoulder
[1:12:23] that's where was the girl standing pure
[1:12:25] and holy full of wisdom fully qualified
[1:12:27] to judge the world in righteousness
[1:12:28] hallelujah number two is Daniel or as
[1:12:33] the times of the Gentiles Daniel 2
[1:12:35] verses 31 to 45 okay so just so you know
[1:12:39] that's Daniel jump into a party priest
[1:12:41] at you are depreciated chapter 2 are you
[1:12:44] read that to you the third reference the
[1:12:51] vision of Daniel okay so this is again
[1:12:54] Daniel chapter 2 he's talking about the
[1:12:57] last part of image the last world power
[1:12:59] was in the feet okay so yeah that's
[1:13:01] Daniel 2 again so the second third
[1:13:03] reference for Daniel chapter 2 the
[1:13:04] fourth reference of the church age book
[1:13:06] is Daniel 12:1 now this is going to help
[1:13:08] us later on so good that's three bottles
[1:13:10] let's go there Daniel 12:1 program
[1:13:13] this is the hundred and forty four
[1:13:14] thousand so I read that for me but it
[1:13:19] would like to be that for me okay thank
[1:13:21] you sir
[1:13:21] then if you read trouble it's a rather
[1:13:23] long verse would thank you sir and at
[1:13:25] that time shall Michael stand up and the
[1:13:29] Great Prince which stand for the turn of
[1:13:31] the people and there shall be a time of
[1:13:34] trouble such as never was since there
[1:13:36] was a nation even to that same time and
[1:13:40] that time now people shall be delivered
[1:13:42] every one that shall be found written in
[1:13:46] the book a minute thank you sir
[1:13:48] so Brandon says Daniel 12:1 refers to
[1:13:51] those hundred forty four thousand being
[1:13:54] sealed during the sixth seal and the
[1:13:57] time of the great tribulation or Jacob's
[1:13:59] trouble praise God
[1:14:03] alright so go ahead just read about the
[1:14:05] Tribulation Period the angel 12:1 in
[1:14:08] fact all of Daniel 12 is the tribute as
[1:14:10] all the time after the rapture it's all
[1:14:13] the time every rapture you know time to
[1:14:15] go through it but we'll go through it
[1:14:16] eventually lift god Terry hour on
[1:14:18] Chapter seven
[1:14:18] we got five more chapters ago actually
[1:14:21] four hundred you okay v reference is in
[1:14:25] Revelation twenty eleven through fifteen
[1:14:29] let's read that let's go to Revelation
[1:14:31] 20:11 this is the great white throne
[1:14:34] judgment Lydia and help me out here
[1:14:42] relation 2011 hey Lydia can you read I
[1:14:50] might read eleven and twelve
[1:14:52] I already though the rest of us when I
[1:14:55] saw a great white throne and him that
[1:14:57] sat on it from whose face the earth and
[1:15:00] the heaven fled away and there was found
[1:15:02] no place for it
[1:15:03] I saw the death at great small and great
[1:15:05] stand before God and the books were
[1:15:08] opened and another book was opened which
[1:15:10] is the book of life and the dead were
[1:15:12] judged out of those things which are
[1:15:14] written in the books according to the
[1:15:16] group's
[1:15:16] amen keep a Jeanette will be standing
[1:15:18] there but Donald Trump Bron James beyond
[1:15:22] say this I mean if we're really holy
[1:15:25] most of all Christians will
[1:15:26] be on the throne and they'll be standing
[1:15:28] for him before us a man and their works
[1:15:31] he judged are the most of their lives
[1:15:35] right so see on the Wednesday night I
[1:15:39] don't feel bad coming in here because
[1:15:41] I'm letting my life be judged right now
[1:15:42] I go through my tribulation right now
[1:15:45] don't worry amen if God comes in their
[1:15:48] lifetime don't you go to the tribulation
[1:15:50] we won't have to because we're going
[1:15:52] through right now
[1:15:52] amen the trials the persecution the
[1:15:55] struggles the battles our spiritual
[1:15:57] battles at one day physical as far as at
[1:16:00] least pressure some type of squeeze or
[1:16:02] pressure don't reach in and you can't
[1:16:04] have Church here anymore all these
[1:16:05] things like that if God tears now I'm
[1:16:08] going to read thirteen at the sea gave
[1:16:10] up the Dead which were in it at the
[1:16:11] death and he'll were delivered up the
[1:16:13] Dead which were in them and they were
[1:16:16] judged every man according to their
[1:16:17] works and death and he'll were cast the
[1:16:19] lake of fire this is the second death
[1:16:21] and who suffered on rip the book of life
[1:16:22] was cast in the lake of fire brother who
[1:16:26] says that there will be both the
[1:16:28] righteous and the unrighteous in this
[1:16:30] judgment it says so these righteous will
[1:16:32] not be in the bride with a bride sits
[1:16:34] with him in the judge me see the bride
[1:16:37] is with him in the throne as she is to
[1:16:40] touch the world she has to be sitting in
[1:16:42] the judgment with him that is exactly
[1:16:44] what Daniel saw and read Daniel 7 we
[1:16:47] just read Davis said so revelation 20:11
[1:16:51] 2:15 and Daniel 7 9 to 10 is the same
[1:16:54] thing but heaven sea is the same scene
[1:16:56] for a thousand thousands who are
[1:16:59] ministry to him are the bride ha ha ha
[1:17:02] for who ministers a dozen but the white
[1:17:06] I'm tired hungry youth who helps me out
[1:17:09] my wife who rubs my feet when I'm tired
[1:17:12] my wife who washes my clothes my wife
[1:17:16] phase-in who ministers to me
[1:17:18] my wife says amen that's the fifth
[1:17:23] reference the last one is again this
[1:17:25] white throne judgment but rancid but
[1:17:27] once the tears are found the rapture can
[1:17:29] take place and does so at the same as
[1:17:32] sometime between the binding and
[1:17:35] revelation and cry so raptures right
[1:17:36] between you have the binding of the
[1:17:38] tears
[1:17:39] with their political move you have that
[1:17:40] first then the rapture and then you have
[1:17:43] the remember revelation Antichrist then
[1:17:46] Satan comes out as well fully in the
[1:17:48] Pope then we'll come today when all said
[1:17:52] together the white drove judgment I've
[1:17:53] seen an angel seven thank you the king
[1:18:01] will be there with his bride and in
[1:18:03] front of them will be the multitudes who
[1:18:06] are to be judged yes all are there all
[1:18:10] the books are opened a final disposition
[1:18:11] of all is made the harvest is in need
[1:18:13] over the books once often are closed
[1:18:18] Hillary Clinton be staying there Bill
[1:18:20] Clinton think about that night we must
[1:18:23] judge our lives now we must have the
[1:18:25] right works now we must pray fast now
[1:18:27] and there must be faithful to God now
[1:18:29] must do all we can now there'll be no
[1:18:33] chance to do with them
[1:18:34] amen it's all finished and rip we must
[1:18:36] live godly now amen
[1:18:38] I'm very happy to do that amen
[1:18:41] now I'm done with that I just wanted to
[1:18:43] show you the six times in the church age
[1:18:45] book when brother Branham references the
[1:18:47] Book of Daniel because remember the
[1:18:50] church age books are very prophetic an
[1:18:51] important book as many has numerous
[1:18:54] about states of origin like about the
[1:18:55] bride and different things now let's go
[1:18:58] back to Daniel 7 can we go back here I'm
[1:19:01] going to try to finish up here I got it
[1:19:02] up ten minutes here want to stop at 8:30
[1:19:06] yeah then you're 7 and I'm not I'm not
[1:19:13] going to able to finish all of data
[1:19:15] sevens and I just wanted to do a little
[1:19:16] bit more so the next time I preach I'll
[1:19:18] probably finish Daniel 7 up for a few
[1:19:20] minutes and then go into Daniel 8 and
[1:19:22] work with because I didn't get enough
[1:19:24] time I just come right out right outside
[1:19:26] they had such a busy meet these last few
[1:19:28] weeks I told my wife in all honesty I
[1:19:31] said honey time is going so fast I just
[1:19:33] I feel like it's just falling through my
[1:19:35] fingers as soon as I sit down to study
[1:19:37] seem like it's time to get up and go to
[1:19:38] work you know but God is good and it's
[1:19:42] almost summer time praise God amen
[1:19:45] Daniel 7:15 I Daniel was reading to my
[1:19:49] spear in the midst of my body and the
[1:19:52] visions of my
[1:19:52] troubleman I came here into one of them
[1:19:54] that stood by and asked him the truth of
[1:19:56] all this so he told me of a we know the
[1:19:59] interpretation of things so Daniel said
[1:20:00] in my angels imagine this extended by
[1:20:02] angels and angels given the
[1:20:05] interpretation of his dream remember he
[1:20:07] was just in his bed for that but right
[1:20:09] now God you just lay in his bed also he
[1:20:11] has these visions he wakes up he says an
[1:20:13] angel there but show me the
[1:20:15] interpretation I talk about a spiritual
[1:20:18] life is amended now no remember the
[1:20:20] physical stress that spiritual visions
[1:20:22] and dreams have upon prophets and
[1:20:24] anybody anybody that has that Holy Ghost
[1:20:27] really moved through them through
[1:20:28] spiritual dreams and visions or even
[1:20:30] divine healing pepper the Bible said
[1:20:33] virtue it out of Jesus and he felt weak
[1:20:34] when the woman with the blood is your
[1:20:36] question anytime there's a real powerful
[1:20:39] move of God your body gets weak that's
[1:20:42] true verse 17 18 now look here's
[1:20:47] interpretation these four great I'm
[1:20:49] sorry these great beasts which are four
[1:20:51] are four kings which shall arise out
[1:20:53] here now we already know their kingdoms
[1:20:55] right so see the word King and King
[1:20:57] kings and kingdoms can be interchanged
[1:20:59] see you have to understand that okay
[1:21:02] verse 18 but the Saints of the Most High
[1:21:05] shall take the kingdom and possess the
[1:21:07] kingdom forever even forever and ever
[1:21:09] not good up here Church the Saints which
[1:21:12] are mentioned five times in this chapter
[1:21:13] are most likely the 144,000 Jews
[1:21:16] motorcycle it could be the bride it
[1:21:19] could be but it's most likely the Jews
[1:21:21] because that's who we see this whole
[1:21:23] thing is about most of the legitimate
[1:21:25] Jews and the Jews or a bride will
[1:21:28] overcome the fourth Beast now either way
[1:21:29] you're right
[1:21:30] this is 144,000 overcome them the Beast
[1:21:34] and so the bride but the bride will have
[1:21:36] the full won't have a full tribulation
[1:21:39] right I'll have no tribulation right I
[1:21:41] won't have to defeat the beast as like
[1:21:43] in a war because there we know where she
[1:21:45] won't show vote for the war the war will
[1:21:47] be for the tribulation period
[1:21:48] okay verse 19 then I would know the
[1:21:52] truth of the fourth beast which was
[1:21:53] diverse from all the others exceeding
[1:21:55] dreadful whose teeth were of iron and
[1:21:57] his nails of brass which devoured break
[1:21:59] in pieces and stamped the residue with
[1:22:00] his feet so see the fourth beast is
[1:22:04] revisited for the
[1:22:05] the Ford peace let's get that okay
[1:22:09] forgive me
[1:22:10] guys get nineteen okay no okay no okay
[1:22:14] its first nineteen okay
[1:22:15] I'm sorry first one I got confusing
[1:22:18] first twenty and of the ten horns that
[1:22:22] were in his head and of the other which
[1:22:23] came up and before whom three fell even
[1:22:28] of that warned that had eyes and a mouth
[1:22:31] mistake very great things whose look was
[1:22:33] more style than his fellows here's some
[1:22:35] interesting and I don't know all the
[1:22:37] symbols here but the little horns are
[1:22:39] ten Kings you can look that up in
[1:22:41] Revelation 1710 I'm not going to take
[1:22:42] the time to go there but trust is there
[1:22:44] if you go read that now this little horn
[1:22:49] is more stout now the Hebrew word means
[1:22:51] great so this little horn is Lord great
[1:22:53] or is it captain or chief than the other
[1:22:56] horns which is strange because the
[1:22:58] little horn okay and I could not find no
[1:23:03] brother random quotes on this scripture
[1:23:04] I looked up style
[1:23:05] I looked up more style you know I
[1:23:06] couldn't find any quotes on the side I'm
[1:23:08] just telling what it means but we can
[1:23:11] see how clearly the Antichrist is more
[1:23:13] powerful than everybody else right never
[1:23:15] you understand that we know that because
[1:23:18] he exalts himself above God he has all
[1:23:20] of Satan he's fully and Carter was
[1:23:22] saying just like Judas was right and
[1:23:25] Judas was a pre figure of the Antichrist
[1:23:28] cuz he sells him out for money always
[1:23:30] after money now verse 21 I'll read that
[1:23:34] and I got my comments up here I beheld
[1:23:38] and the same horn made war with the
[1:23:41] Saints that prevailed against them now
[1:23:43] stop right there that's why I don't
[1:23:45] believe Saints means the bride because
[1:23:46] what war does the bride have to go
[1:23:49] through her have said Christ keeps his
[1:23:52] bride from tribulation you see that now
[1:23:56] it might be a spiritual I could be wrong
[1:23:57] but I'm just saying to me it seems like
[1:24:00] a little horn the Pope Antichrist
[1:24:01] prevails in a war against the Saints
[1:24:03] right this seems to be the death of
[1:24:06] 144,000 or perhaps is the death of the
[1:24:08] two witnesses revelation 11 Praxis that
[1:24:13] verse 22 so look he prevailed until
[1:24:16] verse 22 on TLA see
[1:24:18] Antichrist will prevail until who comes
[1:24:20] create two days until the Ancient of
[1:24:24] Days came and judgment was given to the
[1:24:27] Saints the most high sea and the time
[1:24:31] came that the Saints possessed the
[1:24:32] kingdom
[1:24:34] all right so verse 22 I'm sorry I'm
[1:24:37] still 21 look I'm selling 24/7 of
[1:24:41] Revelation on these chapters and
[1:24:42] sections have referred to the
[1:24:44] Tribulation Period
[1:24:45] revelation 11 refers to a war that's the
[1:24:48] two witnesses that's not right chapter
[1:24:51] that's Israel chapter chapter 12 brother
[1:24:55] family literally said chapter 12 is not
[1:24:57] as nothing to the bride it's all Israel
[1:24:59] and you have Wars of safety in Chapter
[1:25:02] 12 now revelation 13 you do have a
[1:25:04] little bit of brown in there but verse 4
[1:25:06] is not the bride and verse 7 is not the
[1:25:08] bride that is a papal Rome before the
[1:25:12] United States ok so that's before the
[1:25:14] United States times that's not the bread
[1:25:16] for from what I could see I could be
[1:25:18] wrong at 17 14 makes war that's once the
[1:25:22] seven horns are already up that's the
[1:25:23] tribulation that's not the bride and
[1:25:24] these two wars are Armageddon glory of
[1:25:28] the Lord so see how is safe and rebelled
[1:25:31] against the bride when there's nothing
[1:25:32] written that safety prevails against you
[1:25:34] and I hey Ben there's nothing ready say
[1:25:37] that's no scripture where he prevails
[1:25:38] against the bride but the bride
[1:25:40] overcomes why because she's washed at
[1:25:42] the blood of the enemy bed and the blood
[1:25:44] of Jesus Christ always overcome Satan
[1:25:46] itself I hate men because that was the
[1:25:49] blood the blood of Christ shed is what
[1:25:52] bruised the head of the serpent that
[1:25:53] right is the Bible said he bruised him
[1:25:56] on Calvary amen hallelujah so she's
[1:25:59] under the blood so her life has bruised
[1:26:01] the head of safety amen now verse 22 I
[1:26:06] just read it I'm trying to finish you I
[1:26:07] got four minutes the energy of days the
[1:26:10] Lord Jesus Christ comes he stops the
[1:26:12] prevailing Antichrist later the cost was
[1:26:14] prevailing get victories Christ oxen
[1:26:17] then judgment comes and then the Saints
[1:26:21] possessed the kingdom numbers 23 thus he
[1:26:25] said the four beasts shall be the fourth
[1:26:27] Kingdom upon the earth which shall be
[1:26:28] diverse from all kingdoms and shall
[1:26:30] devour the whole earth
[1:26:31] and shall tread it down and break it in
[1:26:33] pieces how many know Trump's going to
[1:26:35] the Vatican pretty soon let me know that
[1:26:36] he's going to Saudi Arabia first then
[1:26:39] he's going up to Rome
[1:26:42] no Israel then he's going to the Vatican
[1:26:44] this year I think it's next look look at
[1:26:48] that church you see how they're coming
[1:26:50] to a union see that that's revelation 13
[1:26:54] United States and rolling must work it's
[1:26:56] that beast that roots fear of Rome
[1:26:58] working the United States and I'm always
[1:27:01] going to have another Trump or not I
[1:27:02] don't know if I'm just saying it's
[1:27:03] really looking close but if it's not
[1:27:06] close well praise God will serve the
[1:27:08] Lord
[1:27:08] but we see it has to move to that
[1:27:11] because it's the state the Lord
[1:27:12] it's the word of the Lord okay now verse
[1:27:17] 29 24 yeah what 24 and the ten horns out
[1:27:24] of this kingdom the Rome are ten Kings
[1:27:27] that shall rise now that's specifically
[1:27:29] quoted I already showed you in
[1:27:30] revelation 17 now finishing verse 24 and
[1:27:34] another shall rise after them and he
[1:27:36] shall be diverse from the first and he
[1:27:39] shall subdue three kings alright so the
[1:27:44] ten horns or ten Kings are mentioned
[1:27:45] again I'm not sure who this other king
[1:27:48] is it rises and subdues three kings it
[1:27:50] might be the Antichrist I don't know
[1:27:53] might be the Pope and because I could
[1:27:57] not find a brother and quote about this
[1:27:58] annuity of the three kings I'm not sure
[1:28:00] I don't know anyone knows - fine -
[1:28:03] please show it because I love to know so
[1:28:04] what I like to do is make all these
[1:28:06] serpents I'm preaching out in two videos
[1:28:07] for you to the people only seem to enjoy
[1:28:10] them all right now verse 25 and that's
[1:28:13] actually my last verse that I had yeah
[1:28:19] okay and he shall speak great words I'm
[1:28:22] who this I believe this is a little horn
[1:28:23] or the Antichrist he should speak great
[1:28:26] words against the most high and shall
[1:28:28] wear out the Saints of the Most High and
[1:28:32] think to change times and laws
[1:28:36] okay now we're getting into now we're
[1:28:39] getting to some other things here
[1:28:40] government's right and they shall be
[1:28:43] given into his hand
[1:28:44] until a time and times and dividing of
[1:28:48] time now
[1:28:52] the other that rises this looks like the
[1:28:55] Antichrist is this other King now is
[1:28:56] called a little horn speaks evil words
[1:28:59] against God wears out the Saints and
[1:29:01] changes times and laws now the phrase
[1:29:05] time times and half a time seems to
[1:29:07] refer to the last three and half years
[1:29:08] of Daniel 70 weeks in other words just
[1:29:10] saw the Tribulation Period okay there's
[1:29:13] my time so I hope there you need five
[1:29:15] movements the same phrase using
[1:29:19] Revelation chapter 12 14 so here's what
[1:29:23] the phrase means time times and half the
[1:29:25] time but time is a year because remember
[1:29:27] Nebuchadnezzar was had the heart of a
[1:29:30] beast for seven times you remember that
[1:29:32] seven times seven years so this
[1:29:37] Antichrist here is going to do this
[1:29:41] until the time times and half a times
[1:29:44] are fulfilled okay
[1:29:47] so just kind of if you like the Bible
[1:29:49] prophecy that help you out all right
[1:29:52] naughty I'm sorry I'm just I'm just
[1:29:55] happy I'm just happy I'm happy I know it
[1:29:58] by God's good I was raised in the church
[1:29:59] that all they do is speak in tongues
[1:30:01] that's all they did I didn't know that
[1:30:02] about the Bible and now we got the keys
[1:30:04] that unlock the body wait a minute I'm
[1:30:06] just happy journeys come in ha I wish
[1:30:09] one understand the Bible and now we can
[1:30:10] by God's days now I just understand it
[1:30:12] but half that simple or here's the quote
[1:30:15] 64 questions answers programs in
[1:30:17] Revelation as well has nothing to do
[1:30:19] with the crime Revelation chapter 12
[1:30:22] does not pertain to the bride relation
[1:30:24] chapter 12 I have looked up but I know
[1:30:25] it is the woman standing in the Sun with
[1:30:27] the moon under feet the moon represent

[1:31:00] the time times and half a time that
[1:31:03] woman that woman Israel has to hide for
[1:31:05] a time she's fed a time times and half a
[1:31:09] time

[1:31:11] manipulations the letter n are we fed by
[1:31:15] the former reign of god's prophet amen
[1:31:18] breathe the holy spirit word that God
[1:31:21] gave to brother brand that's what we're
[1:31:23] fed by today it's exactly right now
[1:31:26] let's say to our feet we're going close
[1:31:28] because I didn't get time to look up
[1:31:29] wearing out the Saints and changing of
[1:31:31] laws and - but I know there's quotes I
[1:31:33] just ran out of time it took me a lot of
[1:31:36] and no numerous times here all these

[1:31:49] preached on Israel I think right before
[1:31:50] I did the boat got merit it was right
[1:31:52] before they left I preached on Israel
[1:31:56] Rome and the Vatican I think I preaches
[1:31:58] two sermons on I know I did use I listen
[1:32:00] to a recent but it's been a while I
[1:32:04] can't I don't have memorized I need to
[1:32:06] go back and look at those and that's
[1:32:09] that okay
[1:32:11] praise God so hope you're blessed by
[1:32:14] that tonight the visions of the great
[1:32:16] for peace now Church the longer I go on
[1:32:18] and the more I feel like the Bible is
[1:32:20] more sinful all the time you feel that
[1:32:22] way amen we just needed God to send the
[1:32:25] Prophet and now we feast on that now
[1:32:28] enjoy that by the grace of life okay
[1:32:30] let's sing a song your every need you
[1:32:32] can take a great request hopefully this
[1:32:36] works out good I'm starting to get the
[1:32:40] routine amen praising them as we close
[1:32:44] here does anybody have any special
[1:32:46] prayer that they need a prayer okay I
[1:32:49] just put a reminder let's pray for
[1:32:51] missionary work again let me just share
[1:32:53] a few things before we go um you know I
[1:32:59] wanted to make them make everybody aware
[1:33:01] of this if people are kind of feeling
[1:33:03] led to go into that mailing out
[1:33:05] invitations because I'm seeing such good
[1:33:09] results you know overseas
[1:33:11] people are seem like they're enjoying
[1:33:12] the videos but let me say this if
[1:33:15] someone wants to do a ministry like that
[1:33:17] for example you would design a postcard
[1:33:20] maybe you work with my wife my wife's a
[1:33:21] art major something like that maybe you
[1:33:24] could share the images back and forth or
[1:33:26] something and if somebody would want to
[1:33:28] be in charge of printing those out and
[1:33:30] then taking the post office but you know
[1:33:32] the church will fund that in other words
[1:33:34] we'll pay for all the postage pay for
[1:33:35] all the printing if somebody has a
[1:33:37] burden to a ministry it could be a
[1:33:39] sister or brother because it has nothing
[1:33:41] to 3t it's just getting out invitations
[1:33:45] to invite people to either visit our
[1:33:48] website or come right here at church in
[1:33:50] terms we can send them to every home in
[1:33:53] this area coats and every business as
[1:33:56] well praise God would that be awesome to
[1:34:00] have give everybody a chance in this
[1:34:01] area to hear the word of God now just
[1:34:04] let's pray about that before we go if
[1:34:07] anybody has a desire like maybe if you
[1:34:08] said recently well I really want to do
[1:34:10] something the Lord what now you can do
[1:34:13] something else
[1:34:14] you've already you're already doing
[1:34:15] something every is are doing something
[1:34:16] for the Lord no either serving your
[1:34:17] husband or loving your wife or serving
[1:34:20] the church supporting services praying
[1:34:21] for the services you know you're already
[1:34:23] doing something for the Lord but it's
[1:34:25] going to do a little more I just saw my
[1:34:26] hard to share that I think I could use a
[1:34:28] little help with that
[1:34:29] all right God's grace so just think
[1:34:33] about that okay would and also you like
[1:34:35] to make copies of our our might be our
[1:34:38] videos you know the teaching videos if
[1:34:40] you like to make copies of that and
[1:34:42] package them up and so we can distribute
[1:34:45] them or mail those out that'd be a
[1:34:47] ministry - I would really I could really
[1:34:50] appreciate some help with that by God's
[1:34:51] grace I have the summer off so I can
[1:34:54] really help somebody get started doing
[1:34:55] that and like for example the church to
[1:34:57] buy some computers we used to have
[1:34:59] printers I remember when both well
[1:35:00] private members would first ah the
[1:35:01] church John would have the printer and
[1:35:03] we print out CDs of the services and we
[1:35:06] make our own DVDs and stuff like that
[1:35:09] but we got rid of them because we just
[1:35:11] ran out of time and I just don't wanna
[1:35:13] do something else but now it seems like
[1:35:16] we can do that again and have another
[1:35:17] ministry there to at least invite people
[1:35:20] to church how many know where brother
[1:35:23] Brian say which country needs
[1:35:24] missionaries of
[1:35:25] who knows America phrase the others to
[1:35:29] go America now I know the Rebbe said
[1:35:32] you're not going to get many souls but
[1:35:35] if you can't if you and I can't go
[1:35:37] overseas at least we can do submission
[1:35:39] her look here
[1:35:40] now here's my thumb I thought would be
[1:35:42] to put something on the cars invite them
[1:35:45] you know to hear about the message on
[1:35:47] their website but also write them to a
[1:35:48] Sunday night service and we'll caught
[1:35:51] like a Bible revelation series you know
[1:35:54] if you want to come learn about the
[1:35:56] Bible but see church war if nobody comes
[1:35:59] we're already here for our four o'clock
[1:36:00] service and we never pulled them away
[1:36:03] from their home church if they already
[1:36:04] have a home church because that's what
[1:36:06] brother Branham did brother Branham
[1:36:07] wouldn't go into the city and he would
[1:36:08] never have service on Sunday morning
[1:36:10] it'd always be between services would be
[1:36:12] like Sunday at one o'clock or Sunday too
[1:36:14] you can hear them on tape it's on tape
[1:36:16] he never pulled people in the church so
[1:36:19] I never want to pull people away from a
[1:36:20] church and that way if you happen let's
[1:36:23] say we have a howitzers at 4:00 p.m.
[1:36:25] sometime that way we're already here it
[1:36:29] doesn't make us we're worn out more like
[1:36:32] doesn't wear me out more head we're
[1:36:35] already going to be here and if some
[1:36:37] straggler comes in and hears the word
[1:36:38] and can say well boy and if they get
[1:36:41] saved churches and your name and my name
[1:36:44] is wrapped around that soul for
[1:36:46] alternative program says we have a
[1:36:48] connection that person for all eternity
[1:36:50] so let's just pray about that and you
[1:36:52] pray about with me we've saved up some
[1:36:55] church money we got funds and if we have
[1:36:57] a missionary count it's just missionary
[1:36:58] money I think right now there's 700
[1:37:01] dollars in it we could easily pump a lot
[1:37:03] more in there print out some tracks
[1:37:06] mailing out you know put something on
[1:37:10] there and try to be a missionary in the
[1:37:12] US the band said try it he said every
[1:37:15] Christian sort of should hunger to win a
[1:37:16] soul well if you don't feel comfortable
[1:37:19] going to witness the people they can
[1:37:21] weekly spider by mail so let's just
[1:37:25] let's just pray about that anybody I
[1:37:26] don't have any the prayer requests by
[1:37:27] God's grace it's not afraid about this
[1:37:29] week that's kind of what I've had a
[1:37:30] burden for you know then we can go that
[1:37:33] route by God's grace and try to invite
[1:37:36] the missionary to people here
[1:37:39] now in the u.s. try to be a Jew
[1:37:40] submission your work our own country by
[1:37:43] God's grace okay all right let's bow our
[1:37:46] heads here we'll just be dismissed on
[1:37:47] this prayer just bring with me and I'll
[1:37:49] pray you onto that Ben golden maybe pray
[1:37:51] about it as well before going to bed it
[1:37:52] can heal there by your bed or however
[1:37:54] you do it maybe crown the couch or
[1:37:55] something
[1:37:56] Heavenly Father nor we're thankful for
[1:37:59] tonight or tonight focusing on prophecy
[1:38:03] of Scripture Lord I remember the Bible
[1:38:06] said Daniel was sealed up into the end
[1:38:08] time thank you Lord and now your
[1:38:10] prophets come and the book is no longer
[1:38:13] sealed to us sure we don't know every
[1:38:15] single detail but the major symbols Lord
[1:38:19] God we have with us say the Lord because
[1:38:21] you send it to us Lord I want to take a
[1:38:24] moment and say thank you lord I do not
[1:38:27] take these things lightly I was raised
[1:38:30] in church I went to church every Sunday
[1:38:32] of my life for 21 years and I heard the
[1:38:37] message I was in church every Sunday
[1:38:39] and Lord I never understood the Bible so
[1:38:42] I want to stand here tonight and just
[1:38:43] raise my hand and say thank you but I
[1:38:46] can understand this worthiness our it
[1:38:50] means so much to us Lord God and to have
[1:38:53] the backing have the authority of thus
[1:38:55] saith the Holy Spirit we're thankful for
[1:38:58] that Lord God always be thankful for
[1:39:00] your prophet whatever worship Him will
[1:39:03] only worship you the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:05] o Lord we do want to take a moment say
[1:39:07] thank you for the prophecy that we know
[1:39:09] and love and help us for God to do some
