we pray you just continue to bless this church Lord and the pastor and his ministry Lord and all those that follow Lord we pray to you keep your holy hand upon us in the one of the name of Jesus Christ we pray letter say Amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Matthew the 16th chapter praise the Lord Amen Matthew 16 some familiar verse of scriptures 16 let's start reading at verse 13 Matthew 16 and 13 if you have a say man the Bible says when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he acts his disciples saying who do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter axed and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen let's go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 Peter chapter one I start at verse um it's not at verse 4 whereby given unto you whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be particularly divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge into your knowledge temperature temperance and to your temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ he made me the Lord of blessing to the reading of his words you can have your seats I mean I want to use for a subject today the foundation of man the foundation of man you know it's uh I believe that we're in very crucial times and I think as a Christian what we need to do is reflect on our foundation you know and and when it comes to God you know when we look at the scriptures especially here in Matthew the 16th chapter you know he asked him a question he says who do men say that I am and some said that he was trying to Baptist and some said that he was Jeremiah or what Elias or one of the prophets you know the the way they thought about Jesus was they compared him to another man you know but when Christ was spawned to them he said all that's fine and he says but who do you say I am because when they responded to Christ you know asking him Who am I all they can do is reflect on what somebody else is saying and in this time we need to be sure hi leah of who we are and who we serve Amy and this is a time where our foundation has to be sturdy amen our foundation has to be solid and we can't build a foundation based upon the merits of mankind hallelujah our foundation has to be on something that's unmovable heylia that's unshakable that's unstoppable hallelujah and the only foundation on the face of the earth like that is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ earlier we are building on the flesh of Jesus because the flesh of Jesus was crucified earlier we build it on the revelation of who he is earlier because by revelation the prophet of God say Christ defeated the devil by simply knowing who he was earlier a man think about that trick if we could get a revelation of who we are Satan is defeated in your life hallelujah amen of you could get a revelation of who you serve do we get a revelation of who God is it can change your life this morning because the revelation of Jesus Christ hurry let's think about this foundation but let's go back to the foundation first everything starts with a foundation earlier the best thing you can build a foundation is upon something solid higher yeah and normally you just take a house or let's take this building this building had to be built upon a solid foundation because when winds come when in your case when blizzards come when atmosphere has changed in all these things this building had to be placed upon a foundation that would keep the building standing in perilous times hariya so the building higher you couldn't be resting alone upon sand Oh Oh burn strong open hallelujah would it had to be something that was stronger than all those elements hurry up and once the foundation was in a place to where it was sturdy where it was solid way it was provable that's the thing about it you can't just lay it down it has to be provable hallelujah it has to be able to go through the tests it has to hurry you go through all the tests of the instructor or the inspector haymann and if the foundation is solid then the building can go up oh yeah so what is the foundation of man huh the foundation in which we were built upon jesus said he said Asia and um hey hey man he said haruya it Matthew when he talked about the church you know they say that once a year a John the Baptist would say your lives here Maya you know one of the prophets and and and if we go and we look into those means life we find some kind of error although they were used by God we still find some kind of error earlier there was a time in John the Baptist life where he doubted that Jesus was the Messiah oh yeah so he can't build a church on that earlier on that man although he was you a man we can't build a church only Liza honey there was a point in his life where he was depressed Maria but he start to question how do you a man whether he was a man of God he was sitting up on his his he was sickening the cave and someone just worried about a woman chasing him we can't build a church upon that foundation honey you say Jeremiah we build a church upon Jeremiah well Jeremiah got to a place where Jeremiah say I quit hang creature no more the burden is too much hallelujah but we can't build a charge upon our quitting so we can't build a church upon the men four stations of great men holy and we have a message bosses of the Prophet but we are not built upon the life of William branham's the message hunter is not the life of random the message is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what we're standing upon dr. foundation the foundation is not Jeffersonville the foundation is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen the foundation is not four walls Hurley the foundation is not a platform or church building Harley or a person for the foundation is the spiritually revealed truth in the heart of the believer Korea so we don't take anything away from great men earlier but we're building this foundation God built this foundation upon something that was unusable that was that will go P every test that we'll go through every child go through every situation and come out like gold that's what we are built upon honey that's what we standing on honey oh my the revelation of Jesus Christ and he said Simon Simon spoke out he said but who do you say I am and Simon said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now listen to the response of Christ Christ says Honoria flesh and blood have not revealed that till this revelation that we have earlier didn't come from a prophet Wow also appreciate the prophet of God what's been revealed to me I was built upon the foundation of Jesus Christ hallelujah he said blessed are You Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood did not reveal this unto you how are you you he said what my father was in heaven revealed this unto you amen the only way hallelujah you could know Jesus I see Jesus is by Christ revealing himself to you no man has anything to do with it and you catch something out of this service today it wasn't me and my gift it's God talking to you it's God revealing himself when it's fake faith is a revelation what is Saint faith is when something is revealed to you oh yeah and the Bible says all I'm going to look too far you got back up higher getting it I'm getting into tonight amen oh yeah but but church you know when we look at this and we see the foundation let's let's let's go back and look at how powerful the foundation of man is I think sometimes as Christians we lightly esteem ourselves we lightly esteem that huh what the word Christian meaning means to be christ-like huh or to be called sons and daughters of God that means honey we're sons and does of God that means that we come from a heritage of God if we have a federal union it'll be filled up with God's in there right in that right when you go to a family unit kinfolk that's how we say back home folk its kinfolk Korea it's people who are related hungry some way down that family tree honey they're connected wholly to the father of that family honey that spread it see earlier and it all traces back earlier to the foundation hurry the chase is our way back to the first man who held that name three and you and i hurry coming from the family tree of Jesus Christ I can say over half is my brother I can say Paul is my brother I can say Astor is my sister Holly Rahab is my sister going because we all come from the same foundation oh yeah when you look at a tree it could produce food for years and years and years hallelujah but it had to start somewhere it started from a foundation it started from what one seed being planted in the ground and God planted one seed the seed of his word the seed of his life hariya and here we are today and that one see that one life has been gone for seven generations or should I say seven Church ages funny he never had to plant another seed or another vine is all coming off that one tree so tree of life oh yeah hey hey look at your foundation church what Paul preached came off the same tree further Hill the life that Moses lived came off the same tree the life that Abraham lived came off the same tree you take the greatest person in the Bible you come off that same tree hey same foundation hey man but you know when we look at it and we think about the foundation of man and just begin to encourage me well I got up this morning I was looking at like oh we're gonna speak on this morning that's just a life of evangelist hey man I wish I could I could sit back and study and everything come together like Jesse Harley I see I see y'all don't understand ministers look at each other and we wish we had the next man's gift but they wish I ain't made long why did you make that I was it long why did you make me like Jesse Bacchus studying and notes and everything come together and just illuminate that's not me you know so I have to come I have to come to place to where I'm confident and how God uses me hallelujah amen and you have to trust God oh yeah you have to trust God save oh yeah st. has an element of trusting but because faith can't see the outcome so in that moment you're trusting God these are the foundations of the man earlier but we look at our foundation I want to show you something so powerful you know you walk out of here today I want you to walk hurry you with your hand up high amen arrogant in the spirit not in a natural in the spirit so when you walk out in the world you walk past these demons these demons of seat you know who you are her the real with a person knows who they are they get treated different look and you know hit too much of this but you know we have all kind of supporters we got Trump supporters Obama supporters all these things but you know one thing that always caught me about Trump came in he was a man of confidence that's why he do what he does he's just a man of confidence and and he he has a certain arrogancy about him so you know always had the question that if he get elected to be President who's gonna tell him what to do and don't we see the results of that because he has he has his own ideas of who he is and nobody can tell him anything other than that and that's a man oh yeah in a natural room what about you and I you know that we are sons and daughters of God hey we ought to be able to walk up in the midst of our trials into relations and say devil I know Lamb Quarry to God I feel resurrection powering in this morning hallelujah glory Church but when God he built the church earlier he didn't he didn't have way doing I mean it wasn't quick fan he didn't build a church hurry or on the shifting sands of time he didn't build a church on the flesh of the ability of a man hey Lia will you go to Genesis wanted to he six he said let us create man in my image in my likeness holy just that's our foundation our foundation is the image and likeness of God you are not to settle for anything else when you go into prayer not to go in not as a sinner but as a god that demanding of God was in God I'm your child I'm your child and I want what you have for me one thing about being a child I'll put you in a spot Jesse one thing about being a child if you're a father I just used Malachi cuz he's the only boy Malachi comes to Jesse he says hey Dad I want a new bike I want the one with the paddles on the side the pedals on the back I want the lights I want the brakes up here and I wanted to be a ten-speed and if Jesse ever since okay son is over in Malachi's mine it's over he's daddy then told him now huh his faith is gonna rest in his father fulfilling that okay oh yeah see the foundation of that son huh is what he believes his father is that's what we're standing on holy we're standing on the revelation that our God created in the world we're standing on the revelation that our God can heal you from cancer amen our witness of that that revelation and God healed me from cancer so I'm here to say that that foundation is true is solid it cannot be moved its unshakable it's been tested it's been proven and it remains the same today oh yeah but you know it doesn't matter oh yeah because this faith is trusting in the revelation of who his father is so he's not gonna come to bring Jesse Hurley and say dad did you get 40 hours this week you're not worried about it my father told me yes close what is he basic his trust on what his father has already done Church to ask and receive is the same thing to do again to ask and receive him and that script has been holier dwelling in my heart he said you asked the father anything in my name he says I will do it what does anything mean without separation anything now that script is like that blow me away you know why because I believe it Kerli see with that those kind of scriptures how do you the devil can't come to you and say see he's not talking about your situation it says anything husband anything wife anything children anything whatsoever you ask he says I will do it and my problem is I'm going to God and prayer and say hey Lord you said yes I'm standing on the foundation these are not the words of any man hug these are not the words of shifting sands but these are the words heard of someone who proving it already like I said like I said Mallika's never come dad did you get it all the time cuz the bike I want it it's really nice you ain't just nice it's nice when I see it huh I see the reflectors and the seat and everything daddy is just nice honey you probably probably seen in a certain store hey Lou you and sister Smith don't realizable and she go to that store Malik I always say mommy cannot come because he want to look at the things his faith is hoping for honey but now holy his fact has the ability to touch it Oh to touch it and make it tangible in his life but he's trusting in his father to connect with his face Hey hellooo yeah that's what a prophet said when - I've never since meet honey the miraculous has to take place what is it is the revelation becoming material to God that's what I want in my life I won't substance me any word just to be faith of his faith is that these hopeful no there's a two parts in that scripture evidence evidence let's go back to the foundation but the foundation of you and I the foundation of us he's built on the image and likeness of God know what you ought to do I do this sometimes I get in the mirror I always say this to people I go to certain churches and you know I'm always running above the speed limit I'm talking spiritually funny I ain't talking about ideal in 77 I'm to my spiritually in the church I'm always going above the speed let me hug everybody else doing the casual you know they they riding in the law you know the law says we can only come to church and be prospective we don't want to be out of order and all these things I'm a law breaker yeah sometimes I like to jump out there and see what I can do hey hey I like to put the horsepower I want to know if this car this vehicle can really do what it's supposed to do we're didn't have a high performance vehicle and you've never tested out you just got something for show earlier but this word holier the lives we have we should be able to test it out we should be read as they got you said hey the foundation we built on you said like a week say on stole you saying that the poorest a rich you said this God and I'm gonna test it out oh yeah that's right when I pray I don't pray for small things I pray for miracles despite what you might be looking at honey my faith honey is the foundation of the building that's why honey second Peter it says honey head to your faith faith is the foundation without faith it is impossible to please the Lord hurry up is that God is the reward of those that diligently seek you so your faith has to be in action honey you know what I'm gonna place now honey well I'm not reasoning anymore with God anybody ever prayed in and and I'm sure most of all of us we prayed about things nothing has happened what do we do we say Oh Lord well I guess in a chore wheel how do you know that how do you know that unless God tell you amen when you pray like that and you act like that that means you're not standing on the foundation because we're standing on a solid foundation of children of God hey let's realize something Adam how you was created in their image Adam had constant fellowship with God constant fellowship with God now you and I created in the same image so why should we have constant fellowship with God God was so mindful of Adam God could look at him and say hey Adams lonely Adam didn't ask God for anything he was just so connected with God God could feel where he was going he is that God created me a woman now oh yeah oh that's on the foundation god knows what you're going through that's what I want to be change I would be so connected with God hallelujah that before I can even ask God's putting things into motion that's what he did but you know you say we're buddies we're in a foundation fail Adam fail yeah Adam fail man fail but not the foundation the foundation stayed the same that's why God told him and Eve honey to strive to get back to this place hallelujah hey man he said I'm gonna put guards there hey man hallelujah that you say you can't just walk back in here your life's got to be right you gotta be worthy hardly to stand on this foundation again this is like I said as the president hugly III may not agree with a trunk I mean I agree with Trump but Trump has a certain platform that I can't stand on because of his natural position and I have a platform that he can't stand on because of my spiritual position we have a platform that cannot be shaken okay he says upon this I will build my church clearly not hallelujah the knowledge of men but the revelation of Jesus Christ and you look at how each man each individual steward on that revelation and look at the results they got we take somebody like Moses who didn't want to be a deliverer but that was a part of the platform Moses standing on that platform hardly he could go down into the kingdom of Egypt and demand liberty because he's good on the platform in which God made him which was a deliverer and now he's standing there on that foundation hi Leah and Moses yes all these human questions he has all these human reasonings like the disciples had in Matthew 16 some say now like this some say now is that some say some say something here's Moses coming to God with the saying some Saint well you know Lord I can't talk but we know Lord they're gonna say this about me and you don't know what's you who should I say see me and all these things and gauzy shut up I'm sorry children you know you're not supposed to say that but God tells Moses be quiet he said who made man's mouth and then God puts him back on the platform honey he says hey you looking at her own he says hey hey I want you is that will Aaron to be your prospect and you be God to the people so he put Moses back color back into what he created in Genesis 1:26 oh my church and that's what he's always done when the platform looked like honey the platform is the foundation stays sturdy but sometimes we get off of it and God comes back in hey let me put you back where you belong surely he did that throughout the times a man remember David David David got in trouble and David fell God in him but you know God constantly pushed him back on the platform push him back on the foundation he said you know what David you're a man after my very own heart oh yeah and God did that through the generations and even like I said when John the Baptist got poured of God's sake go back and tell John what you see he'll put him back on the platform with Elijah hallelujah got all messed up he was in the cave and all these things oh god Ravens and birds and things to feed him huh they let him know he was with him huh but yeah my earlier get all depressed and the stars God came down and started stirring in his heart then Jeremiah say he's like fire shut up in my bones okay yeah but stand on this foundation Jesus comes to the disciples over me and say I'm the Christ he says flesh and blood have not revealed this on you Peter he says but huh my father's in heaven he says and upon this rock hurry rock me from elationship oh yeah he said the Catholic Church says is Peter no it can't be Peter how do you know why because even after Peter got that revelation he had lying in him he had cussing in him he had denial in him with that revelation of the Christ that's why you can't count nobody out this person got the message this brother I'll hold up let's see if God gonna put them back on the platform and see God gonna put them back earlier on the foundation again honey because the foundation ain't going away we always need the foundation he was just like honey God told holy Santos Sampson saying I would give you a vow I mean your foundation that lives by her don't cut your hair stay stay right with your Nazarite Philemon now when Samson got thrown out hurry he left the foundation but the foundation was still there while he was in prison crying in hugs but he's in prison working bills latter day the foundation stayed the same you know one day he got back on the foundation he got back on what God created him to be huh Leah hey man I deliver I'll destroy her foundation didn't move stayed the same and the Bible says he destroyed more Phyllis ties that day then he did the whole time he was with it all you got to do is be what God wants you to be hallelujah but we look and you know we say we're standing on the revelation of Jesus Christ I want you to think about that think about who you serve and why are you going through trials and tribulations acts yourself is there any error in the foundation is there any cracks in it is it chipping away no it's perfect this thing we're standing on is perfect the revelation of Jesus Christ is greater than Allah clearer than Buddha haruya greater than two fishes or whatever other God that they say they got the foundation of Jesus Christ is unmovable unshakable it's so powerful Church that he he wanted to put us on the foundation he did it in such a way that our era holy wouldn't stop us from remaining there because like I said Peter lies Peter Peter Peter said all kind of things you know he cursed and everything and church even in that moment when Peter look like he was failing God he still was you see my mind you see my mama according to God he was still in the foundation now peeling himself may have saw himself in the natural not standing for God but God had it all playing out that way and something I want to say to you that color we see mistakes we see people have error and all these things Peter in all his error and everything else before he got to his error God had already given the keys of the key lying had the keys cutscene Lena Headey keeps denying Peter had the keys the foundation is unmovable psycho-boy unchangeable and despite what the world thought about him he had the key to the key he lied he does he thank God I sit back saying don't worry I pray for you God is in control he's in control about the closed church but but but we think about Holly was standing on the rock who is that rock that rock is Jesus Christ under the revelation of Jesus Christ spiritually revealed truth amen and you look at how that truth holier got color in the Saints of Oh through all their battles because the foundation remains the same that's why when the Prophet Hurley was like they're hunting for squirrels honey he start to doubt himself that's why I said we don't base hariya our livelihood on what honey or who brother Branham is no we base it upon the word that he brought the word that was preached early and I say this to you honey that this message is no good to you unless you mix it with faith so you have to take this message and put it on the right foundation it's no good just saying brother Branham said cuz that's my faith oh you're just in agreeance but faith is honey-producing what he said manifesting what he said or showing what he said in your life hey cuz remember Holly Melbourne was a man hurry Leah and you can't you know I was just preaching the wave offering you know a lot of people a lot of people saying and believe that they believed brother Brennan was out wave offering I don't agree with that that's just me Hurley because if he was our wave offering that means you can lie before God and it'll be all right that's the kind of thing that we want to say we that's kind of free we want to say coming out d'Avignon remember he said hey tell them I'm not here and he with that did it happen there was a time in his ministry well he got so sick of people rejecting him that he started calling people Ricky's and Rick Etta and God had to rebuke him is that what we're waving before the people come on telephone suit of that vineyard the foundation has to be Jesus Christ cuz there's no era that's why you can waive that before the people and say everything come out of this vineyard is gonna be like that there's a point in the province like when he wanted to commit suicide not Jesus I I like to bring I like for everything we believe the tie into this and I'm not saying that the proper wasn't a great man honey yeah but if I waive him before me I'm waiving flesh he went in the Bible says honey flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God it has to be a spirit and really spirit that came loose earth that was perfect was the Lord Jesus Christ so I'm gonna waive that before me hallelujah yeah Lord that's what I would love for all the fruits of my life to be like well you can get tired you say nevertheless not my will that I will be done a man we have to look at the profit and see that he was a man honey he got tired they meant all the things like we see in John the Baptist and Elijah and and and the different ones that when they said we see huh he said who the men saying they say well John you know they say uh he lies the only thing brother Brennan went through those stages he went through stage where he was depressed honey he went through stages where he quit preachers huh he with the stages huh well he ran because he got tired of explaining what he believed he went through early stages but just like Jesus said who do men say I am just that's where we are who do men say we are Hollow who do mean honey who ye honey say these messages hey doctor Christ three so when I look at this message I see Jesus I don't see a man that's the foundation that's what it's all about and the foundation is spiritually revealed truth now what I'm getting to before I close what makes this foundation so so important he goes back and he says if you're standing on his foundation the gates of Hell shall not prevail against so European stage four cancer the gates of Hell shall not prevail against another friend a friend of mine I'll tell him I'm just a friend of mine can't boy he just passed go be with the Lord but I was there and I saw him when he was going through the stages of brain cancer healing all the Saints are praying if y'all gonna do anything for me pray for me cuz thus the prayers of the Saints are very powerful huh pray for me and my family huh but you know church cuz everybody world was playing and I didn't know it was his time to go or not but I wanted to see him if whatever the case was and just at my - singing huh I want to get it in send up a prayer before God huh because Chuck we have to believe that God hears us huh so you know I went to see them and so forth you know and all these things I'm one of these kind of people that when you're going through something I ain't gonna keep asking you well how's it going good if you tell me you believing I'm just there praying to the manifest I don't keep coming back to you asking you how things going everything all right that's so you believe right you to pray son situation actually pray keep praying to I taste something different so he's lying ain't gonna brother ki nag me I had a brain cancer doing what's going on cuz he's already asked God he said Lord believe me for healing so I'm gonna come in and ask him about some doubt far as he concern even had no brain - no brain cancer huh so you know Church we prayed and prayed in different things so forth and I was in um I was in the UM I was in South Africa and I got a text and he wasn't eating and he wasn't getting out of bed anymore anything he was just laying there he couldn't get up and go for walks anything you know so everybody was still praying yeah I got another text they say hey he starts to get hungry again honey he told his wife honey help me put on my clothes I feel like going for a walk honey so everything he couldn't do he started to do it honey he's trying to go for a walk he started you know people that come to see me started to greet him and walk to my house and everything like he did unto me hallelujah and you know church he got to a place to where a couple maybe a week or so after that he went back to the doctor honey Leah went back to the doctor and everything to tell the doctor the stages of where he was not feeling well and couldn't eat him and and couldn't walk couldn't get out the bed and all these things to receiving strength again earlier and and start to do all the things that he couldn't do see the foundation didn't change and he was in his doctor's office and tell him everything the doctor says we're gonna do some some tests and they begin to examine and examine and examine and examine you know what they were examining while I was examining him there was examining his foundation that was something greater than his body it was his revelation and the doctors examined and examining examined her ear then the doctor came back to him so the windy and says hey you don't need me anymore I don't see nothing hey doctor God and brillkids gonna be with the Lord but it ain't from brain cancer hallelujah God is - oh my the foundation can't be shook holy he left this place with a testimony that he was healed now everybody this family all his friends meet all of us we know that he's gone because it was his time not because he was sick huh because God holy P again that the foundation of Isaiah 53 is still remaining strong and the gates of hell honey in my closing church when things are going on in our lives and do things let's examine our foundation because your foundation is weak the building this week Hurricane Florence and all these places can come in and he can pour and pour and pour a lot of the things that we get lasted through the flood because the foundation hallelujah foundation remain strong a little water might get in but the bills are still standing oh yeah we might have a little struggle a little trial a little just a little debt but it's the building still standing huh if the foundation is still strong hallelujah and and we had to ask a question when I was standing on such I'm even encouraging myself today hug hug it then as we go through trials and tribulations we have to sit down take a deep breath as a thought I'm standing on you I'm standing on hallelujah it doesn't matter what it looked like right now huh I'm standing on a foundation that cannot be moved you think about you know the next storm that we may have on or the next trial you may have if the foundation is strong building ain't going nowhere and sometimes you've seen a building get tore down but the foundation still stays hey hey man so it's all right to get a little beat up sometimes the longer the foundation is there you can always reveal and a lot of times we revealed you reveal stronger cream and you reveal tough for her and sometimes and then the rebuilding process is so good you make it bigger you add some things that you didn't already have unless they add to your faith or your knowledge knowledge chipperz chipperz patient hire you add to that building Kaluga that's what we need to do Church as we grow in Christ just remember that the foundation and going away in the foundation his faith was standing upon how God Hurley originally created us to be in His image and likeness that's what we're spending on come on brothers are musicians I'm closing amen huh and I just love the party says in the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it now ain't that just a wonderful consolation that no matter how he'll die he didn't say here won't fight he say prevail and church I preached the message one time call get your mind right get your mind right cuz sometimes you can be in a battle and you think you losing know the battles making you stronger that's what the battle is all about a person that lives waits they don't live wait to get weekly live ways to get stronger but you have to the process of lifting weights you have the channels muscles down and as they build back up they get stronger then you can lift more weight and that's what God does in trials and tribulations we go through things that we think oh why am I going through this cuz he want to make you stronger just standing on the right foundation see cuz God he doesn't bring tests and trials for failure that's not his way what he's trying to do is show you what else is on that foundation show you what else how do you show you what kind of building you can be I mean I like brick buildings Carly look here hey man cuz you know he'll he'll he'll let certain things happen Harley so you can see that you can add this to your face you can add this to your face you can add this and that you can add that all of us are part of the beauty hey man that's what we won't church so don't get discouraged when you go through is God building you up honey remember he told Abraham he say you and Sarah have a cellar look at all the stones that came down the foundation had to be right honey he say you and Sarah first thing you did hug he got hey God foundation was still the same though then after he left honey young king took his wife but the foundation stayed the same God will fight your battles honey he told the King hose he told hey God it was hey yeah it's me here wow man he not promised Hurley then the young king came to chuck teller he said give it back or you good as a dead man God stayed there huh just show Abraham ain't going nowhere what Santa's gonna happen and what was he doing making Abraham stronger Holly then 25 years later he has the baby hurry he has the promise honey did God said I'm gonna test the foundation again I want you to kill him for the foundation were made the same now it for ham became her a part of the foundation he's just standing on it he is at this point he is what God is honey yeah so that's why he can say Isaac can say no yes daddy I see I see the to the altar and we got the wood and all these people where the sacrifice now he comes labor him he says the Lord shall provide you sacrifice God had to take him through child inflation so he could get to that place oh yeah and we are the same that's why the Bible says what so everything when you pray and believe you can have it honey we touch and agree hallelujah he said and I'll give it to you amen this is what we're standing on church hey man let's pray glory to God North following thank you for your word and we pray
