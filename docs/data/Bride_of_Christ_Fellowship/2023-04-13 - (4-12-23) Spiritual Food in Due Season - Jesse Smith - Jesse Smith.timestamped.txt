[0:00] because of my voice and we'll see how
[0:02] that goes by God's grace
[0:05] Hallelujah
[0:06] let's go to First Kings
[0:08] 17.
[0:11] First Kings 17.
[0:14] I'm not really going to preach a series
[0:15] or anything like that tonight I'm gonna
[0:17] I just want to preach a sermon kind of
[0:18] based off what happened there on the
[0:20] weekend and
[0:21] someone preach a simple sermon called
[0:22] spiritual food and due season praise God
[0:25] no doubt that's what it was over the
[0:28] weekend
[0:30] and it's all God's doing
[0:33] we were just there when it happened
[0:35] praise God
[0:36] so First Kings 17 of course brother
[0:38] Brown preached this in 1965. just a few
[0:41] uh months before he went off the scene
[0:44] and in that sermon I was listening to it
[0:46] today
[0:47] he said you didn't have much time left
[0:48] before he had to cross over to the other
[0:50] side
[0:51] and that was exactly right there
[0:53] First Kings 17.
[1:01] pardon me as I get there first king 17.
[1:05] my brother Ram says this story here is a
[1:07] perfect type
[1:09] verses one to seven
[1:11] uh we'll read seven together I'll read
[1:14] one to six myself here
[1:16] spiritual food induces
[1:18] and Elijah the tishbite who was of the
[1:20] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as
[1:23] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[1:24] whom I stand there shall not be do nor
[1:26] Reign these years but according to my
[1:28] word
[1:30] I think about that brother Adams makes
[1:31] that statement have you ever
[1:33] seen a time where there was no rain or
[1:35] Dew
[1:36] Reign or do for three and a half years
[1:40] so this was brother said he got so close
[1:43] to God he knew exactly what God wanted
[1:45] that's how he could say something like
[1:46] that he was so so close in Fellowship to
[1:48] God
[1:50] verse two and the word of the Lord came
[1:52] unto him saying get thee hands and turn
[1:53] the Eastward and hide thyself
[1:56] by the Brook cherith that is before
[1:58] Jordan
[1:59] so he comes out with thus saith the Lord
[2:01] to Ahab we'd say like the president of
[2:03] the nation and then he goes into hiding
[2:07] you see how God has certain times and
[2:09] seasons for us
[2:10] here he's out in the public declaring
[2:12] the word of God but then God says go
[2:14] hide yourself
[2:17] verse 4.
[2:18] and it shall be that thou shalt drink of
[2:21] the Brook and I have commanded the
[2:22] Ravens to feed thee there but remember
[2:24] to see there we always want to be there
[2:26] where God wants us to be
[2:29] hiding myself well if that's where the
[2:31] Lord tells me to go yes I want to be
[2:33] there praise God
[2:35] verse 5. so he went and did according
[2:37] unto the word of the Lord so see that's
[2:38] where we want to be the word where the
[2:40] word of the Lord tells us to be
[2:43] for he went and dwelt by the Brook
[2:44] cherith that is before Jordan
[2:47] and the Ravens brought him bread and
[2:49] flesh in the morning and bread and flesh
[2:51] in the evening and he drank of the brook
[2:54] let's read verse seven ready one two
[2:56] three and it came to pass after a while
[2:59] that the brook dried up because there
[3:03] had been no rain in the land let's have
[3:05] one more word of prayer if you have
[3:05] anything on your heart just don't make
[3:07] it known unto God here
[3:08] father God you are faithful you're the
[3:11] only living God

[3:21] the future you're doing great things in
[3:22] the past help us to see what you're
[3:24] doing right now Lord God and Father Lord

[4:55] thank you for that victory tonight Lord
[4:56] God thank you for your food and due
[4:57] season I pray you minister to your
[4:59] people tonight God I'm nothing I can't
[5:01] help anybody Lord as I've seen you time
[5:03] and time again I pray you just speak to
[5:04] your people here tonight God because you
[5:06] are faithful Lord Jesus we love you and
[5:08] worship you in Jesus Christ's name the
[5:10] saint said
[5:11] amen God bless you as you're being
[5:13] seated praise God
[5:17] bless you
[5:19] are we live streaming then okay praise
[5:21] God God bless the life Chambers and
[5:25] certainly love everybody by God's grace
[5:28] I have a few slides I'd like to share
[5:30] here
[5:33] if I can get this plugged in here
[5:40] so uh
[5:43] I'm gonna set the timer I hope I just
[5:44] really want to preach about half an hour
[5:45] I don't even know that's possible but
[5:47] and I want to I want to stop the live
[5:48] stream and just share some personal
[5:49] things from this weekend that meant a
[5:52] lot to me and and some of the people I
[5:53] know that were involved and then I just
[5:55] thought too I'd like to have a little
[5:56] testimony if anybody has a testimony
[5:57] from the weekend I'd like you to come
[5:59] share it maybe by God's grace
[6:01] I like to put you on the spot
[6:03] because I know everybody likes being put
[6:04] on the spot
[6:06] no I know you don't but we sure would
[6:08] like to hear some testimonies you know I
[6:09] would like I would like I did something
[6:12] you know for each person so brother
[6:14] Adam's text of course was you know uh
[6:16] First Kings 17 like we read one to seven
[6:19] and of course speaking of uh Elijah
[6:21] Elijah
[6:23] now a little later once it gets into a
[6:25] sermon he says I'm going to type this
[6:27] great ministry tonight of Elijah and the
[6:29] time of Elijah with the hour that we're
[6:31] now in I believe it's a perfect type
[6:34] so he says verses one to seven are a
[6:37] perfect type
[6:38] okay so as you'll see later on the type
[6:43] is is that God's word has been spoken
[6:45] and then judgment is upon the
[6:48] unbelievers
[6:49] so that's not us God's grace is on us
[6:51] how many can say Amen to that
[6:53] we are with Elijah praise God we believe
[6:56] Elijah's message can I say can you say
[6:58] Amen to that I believe it Bill Graham's
[7:00] message I believe it
[7:02] um so that's the type you're eventually
[7:04] going to see he gets to that and the
[7:06] whole point of this type is that we will
[7:08] be like Elijah will have his word and
[7:10] then we will hide away with God
[7:13] okay while the world is suffering
[7:16] drought now brother man types it it's a
[7:19] spiritual drought
[7:21] while the world is suffering spiritual
[7:23] drought we're enjoying the blessings of
[7:25] God
[7:27] being shut away with God
[7:30] amen so he says verses one to seven is a
[7:32] perfect type
[7:34] I can see that I can see that because of
[7:37] the scripture Amos and so forth we'll
[7:38] get to that here in a little bit by
[7:39] God's grace Brother Bear mentions that
[7:41] scripture right in the sermon
[7:42] he said and then of course they had a he
[7:44] preached really short I think it might
[7:45] have been like a 40-minute sermon then
[7:47] the rest of time he spent praying for
[7:48] the sick if you listen if it's only an
[7:50] hour and a half this sermon the whole
[7:52] whole recording from beginning to end
[7:54] now he says that type there I'm going to
[7:56] type Elijah with a church today the
[7:57] Church of today just before judgment he
[7:59] received this message
[8:01] Elijah he represented being cared for in
[8:03] the natural his natural food because it
[8:04] wasn't going to rain now according to
[8:05] the word of the Lord for three years and
[8:07] six months or until Elijah called for
[8:09] him whatever time you say Elijah that's
[8:11] what it'll be therefore he walks up to
[8:13] the king and said there will not even be
[8:14] do fall till I call for it
[8:17] that's quite a load isn't it that's
[8:18] quite a message
[8:20] now think about think about what
[8:21] prophets have spoken I mean this this
[8:23] just blows my mind he stands there and
[8:25] says there will be no do
[8:28] until I call for it
[8:31] Joshua stood there and he said Son stand
[8:34] still
[8:36] it's never been done before and it's
[8:38] never been done after
[8:40] Moses said let there be flies and then
[8:42] nine other plagues
[8:46] I mean these guys have to be filled with
[8:48] God's spirit to speak such things like
[8:50] that
[8:51] because we can try to claim things right
[8:53] we've all tried to I'm guilty
[8:56] we can all try to claim and speak things
[8:57] but
[8:58] does it happen it's a different story
[9:01] when you're a prophet
[9:03] right that's why these guys are called
[9:05] prophets that's why we honor them as
[9:07] Prophets
[9:08] because they have power to speak for God
[9:11] they're speaking on God's behalf and
[9:13] that's why church that's why you know
[9:14] even I you know Jesus says uh like we
[9:17] preached on a few weeks ago they call
[9:19] them Gods to whom the word of God came
[9:20] to like see I don't even like to put
[9:22] myself in that position because look
[9:23] what these guys said
[9:24] yeah I mean I've spoken a few times a
[9:26] few situations
[9:28] thank God for the answer but to me it's
[9:31] just not on this level this is a whole
[9:33] The Profit level is a whole another
[9:34] level
[9:35] that's just that's just me you know and
[9:37] I just feel like we should be humble you
[9:39] know he said that's quite a message
[9:43] now we're going to type that with a
[9:44] spiritual drama today now we all know
[9:45] we're very aware there's a great
[9:47] spiritual drought in the land today
[9:48] spiritual speaking
[9:50] and you know that this was predicted by
[9:52] the prophets just before the second
[9:54] coming of Christ would be there would
[9:56] come a famine in the land and it won't
[9:57] be for bread alone but for the hearing
[9:59] of the word of God and that day is now
[10:01] hearing the true word of God
[10:03] you know church I uh
[10:04] I got back from the weekend you know so
[10:06] it's on fire I was tired but I was on
[10:08] fire
[10:09] and I just scroll and I think it was
[10:10] Sunday night yeah I got home and you
[10:12] know I was getting ready for bed and
[10:13] everything
[10:14] I saw oh they had a service at Lincoln
[10:17] Memorial in Washington Washington D.C
[10:21] and I clicked on there I said I'm just
[10:22] going to fast forward to the end what
[10:23] did this preacher say
[10:25] like so what so what is the world
[10:27] preaching
[10:30] um you know I compared to what the lord
[10:31] gave me for Sunday morning
[10:34] the lord gave me you know
[10:36] the the thought about how Jesus is is so
[10:39] faithful Even in our mistakes he he even
[10:41] though the Sheep are scattered he goes
[10:43] and gathers them all back
[10:44] and then if you're risen with Christ
[10:47] you'll crucify
[10:50] right so this guy talks about what this
[10:54] this worldly preacher we'd say worldly
[10:55] preacher denominational preacher
[10:57] whatever he is he talks about how God
[10:58] accepts homosexuals
[11:01] and how that we that we have God in us
[11:03] and we just gotta tell people that Jesus
[11:06] is Alive that that was just the basics
[11:08] of it
[11:09] I mean listen I kept waiting for
[11:11] something about repentance and uh but he
[11:14] he said imagine we have God's Own Spirit
[11:16] living in this we have the uh we have
[11:18] eternal life living in us and church it
[11:21] was all good news now good it was all
[11:22] good stuff
[11:23] now of course the homosexual stuff is
[11:25] not
[11:26] I thought well let me just compare what
[11:27] God gave us to come compared to what the
[11:29] denominations got today
[11:31] I was just so I was so astounded
[11:35] because there was no mention of any
[11:36] dying out to self no mortification
[11:40] right no sanctification
[11:42] it's just we we you know Jesus is Alive
[11:44] and our his spirit's on us and we just
[11:46] got to tell others that he's alive now I
[11:48] believe we got to tell her he's alive
[11:49] but when we're not doing that we got to
[11:51] die to ourselves
[11:54] if we're risen with Christ
[11:55] those things that are above
[11:58] yes I just thought well what what a
[12:00] great
[12:01] and so see that's why people will drive
[12:03] I think there was 10 000 people there at
[12:05] the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday morning
[12:07] and it was a it was a uh sunrise service
[12:10] so they were there while it was dark now
[12:12] look at look at the dedication look at
[12:14] the dedication I've never been I think I
[12:16] may have only been to one or two sunrise
[12:17] services in my life you know in
[12:19] denominationalism
[12:21] but look at the dedication they'll drive
[12:23] 10 000 people drive across the country
[12:25] or drive across or fly in they said
[12:27] people flew in from all over the nation
[12:28] to be there that morning
[12:30] and they hear and they're here there
[12:32] they hear the word of God now church
[12:33] what do you think what's your judgment
[12:35] did they hear the fresh word of God or
[12:37] was there a spiritual drought there
[12:40] drought
[12:41] they're flying all in they think it's
[12:43] going to be some some great move of God
[12:44] and then here we are a tiny little
[12:46] church in Napoleon Ohio
[12:48] repenting of our sins dancing rejoicing
[12:51] praising the Lord shouting screaming
[12:53] crying I don't know if anybody spoke in
[12:55] tongues but it would have been a good
[12:55] atmosphere to speak in tongues
[12:57] Hallelujah
[12:59] it would have been a great atmosphere to
[13:00] get healed and so forth like that that's
[13:03] what I was praying for
[13:06] but I just thought wow what a contrast
[13:09] of a people that in Napoleon that get
[13:13] the rain from God
[13:15] and then the people that are in a
[13:17] spiritual drought
[13:19] it's the same old same old and now
[13:22] they're just letting more goats in all
[13:23] the time now I'm not trying to be
[13:25] critical but I'm just saying once you
[13:26] allow sin it's just letting the goats in
[13:29] right you can't allow the goats in
[13:32] I thought wow what a perfect application
[13:34] from this today
[13:35] we ought to be able to recognize
[13:37] they they just have a drought they can't
[13:39] hear the true word of God now the man
[13:41] said many right things but then he also
[13:43] said some bad things and he left out so
[13:46] much too
[13:47] there's so much that was left out
[13:50] so what was left out is like the drought
[13:52] right we didn't get the rain we didn't
[13:54] hear all the truth
[13:55] right they didn't hear everything they
[13:57] should have heard
[13:59] he said sit and unbelief by false
[14:01] teachers and modernists in the church
[14:02] had brought the place to this coming
[14:05] oncoming judgment then they had turned
[14:07] from God's word and his Prophet to a
[14:09] modern theological terms of the word
[14:13] right just know him by theology all
[14:15] these three persons and let's recite the
[14:17] Creed let's allow sin to come into the
[14:20] church that's theology right that's
[14:21] man-made theology
[14:25] now here's a scripture brother Ryan was
[14:27] talking about Amos behold the days come
[14:29] saith the Lord that I will send a famine
[14:31] in the land not a famine of bread nor
[14:33] thirst for water but of the hearing of
[14:34] the words of the Lord
[14:36] and they shall wander and look at this
[14:37] from sea to Sea from North even to East
[14:40] they shall run to and fro to seek the
[14:42] war Lord and shall not find it
[14:44] they think they're hearing the word of
[14:45] God but they're not hearing the word of
[14:47] God
[14:48] and let me say this blessed are your
[14:51] eyes for they see
[14:53] blessed are your ears for they hear
[14:56] because we can see their sin loving
[14:58] Doctrine taking them further down
[15:00] further away from Christ
[15:03] as if they're as if as if they're I'm
[15:07] sorry as if they have no rain praise God
[15:09] as if they're drying out
[15:11] yeah on the outside they got all the
[15:12] they got the fancy sunglasses they got
[15:14] the leather jackets I mean they look
[15:15] like they're hip and cool and Rich
[15:18] they look like they got everything
[15:19] figured out it's perfectly loud to see a
[15:21] rich and increase with Goods have need
[15:23] of nothing
[15:24] the guy was testified oh we started our
[15:26] church with 34 people now we're up to
[15:28] 600 whatever like like that's a is that
[15:31] a measurement of God's blessing not
[15:33] always
[15:34] not always it could be
[15:36] if it is well I sure miss God a long
[15:38] time ago praise God as far as I know
[15:40] I've been serving God as best as I can
[15:41] in all these years
[15:43] but I realize they are they don't have
[15:45] the reign of the word of God
[15:47] so it's still Trinity still sprinkling
[15:50] right it's still sin loving religion all
[15:53] these things I realize I really know
[15:55] what church and you know you do too we
[15:57] know what the reign of God produces
[15:58] praise God
[16:00] we know what God's Reign brings to the
[16:02] believer praise God refreshing amen
[16:04] that's what the Bible says it's
[16:05] refreshment in the presence of the Lord
[16:08] Hallelujah
[16:12] you notice here it's just at that time
[16:14] God always raised up something because
[16:16] he always he he does nothing until he
[16:18] first reveals it to the people and he
[16:19] always reveals it to his servants the
[16:21] prophets
[16:22] now but Elijah during this time had a
[16:24] secret place that God had ordained for
[16:25] him to go
[16:27] that's the thing we want to see now just
[16:29] before we have the prayer line he's only
[16:30] been preaching like 10 minutes Elijah
[16:33] had a secret place provided by God
[16:34] himself now the church now look at this
[16:37] the church never provided for him the
[16:39] key never provided for him he didn't
[16:40] provide himself but God provided a
[16:42] secret place for Elijah to be fed all
[16:44] the time during the drought where his
[16:45] food was provided day by day
[16:48] let me just say this I can't provide the
[16:51] secret place for you
[16:52] what I do is I preach about the secret
[16:54] place
[16:56] amen hallelujah amen can't provide the
[17:00] secret place for us he he can't sing us
[17:02] into that secret place his singing will
[17:05] not take us in there Malachi's playing
[17:06] Lydia's playing they will not take it in
[17:08] there we're singing about that secret
[17:10] place
[17:11] but each one of us have to choose to go
[17:13] into that secret place that's what
[17:15] brother says the church the church can't
[17:17] take you there
[17:18] you know like nobody can do it it's it's
[17:20] each one of us submitting to the Holy
[17:22] Spirit praise God
[17:24] and walking a secret consecrated life
[17:26] with Jesus Christ feeding on God's word
[17:28] every day have you have you found on
[17:30] God's word today praise God if not now's
[17:32] a good time
[17:33] Hallelujah see that daily need for God
[17:36] is that daily communion with the Lord
[17:41] he didn't need to wonder what's what's
[17:43] going to happen tomorrow or wonder if
[17:45] the supply will run out I wonder if God
[17:48] will have enough word for me for
[17:49] tomorrow
[17:50] I wonder if God's word will be able to
[17:52] keep me in 2023 the rest of the way
[17:55] right got about six more months right
[17:57] I'm sorry eight more months right can
[18:00] God's word keep me the rest of this year
[18:02] we have to wonder about that God said
[18:05] I've commanded the Ravens and they'll
[18:06] feed you what a wonderful thing a type
[18:09] of our secret place where where is it in
[18:11] Christ Christ is the word Christ is the
[18:14] Holy Ghost
[18:15] our secret place is fellowship in the
[18:17] Holy Ghost
[18:21] now I'd like to just you know move from
[18:22] that sermon I'll get back to that sermon
[18:24] I'm going to move here to some
[18:25] scriptures about the importance of words
[18:27] in due season
[18:29] now think about your life you know a
[18:31] word you heard the word of God right at
[18:34] the right time
[18:39] you think about the examples you know
[18:41] you could pull out in your life when
[18:42] Austin really needed to hear that God
[18:43] loved him and Austin be loved to the
[18:45] Lord talk about it we're in due season
[18:47] buddy Hallelujah
[18:50] each one of Simon when he preached there
[18:51] nine I mean the certain nine events of
[18:54] my life talk about here in a word and
[18:55] due season
[18:57] I mean it just blew my mind
[19:00] you know right when we need it it seems
[19:01] like right we need it that's what God
[19:03] shows up praise God you know why because
[19:05] he knows you want to be in that secret
[19:07] place with him
[19:08] amen that's right that's right
[19:10] Hallelujah he knows he knows you're
[19:12] waiting on him so he shows up and gives
[19:14] you the word for the due season
[19:16] and of course you could church I didn't
[19:18] do this but you could take this all down
[19:19] through the Bible think about how each
[19:21] person had a word induced Enoch had the
[19:23] word for the Rapture in the season
[19:25] Noah had the word this is the season to
[19:27] build the ark
[19:28] the word and then and then the season
[19:30] was get in and then the season was uh
[19:33] then the season finally was the Dove's
[19:34] not coming back now it's time to leave
[19:36] the ark and think about the words that
[19:38] he needed in every season we could run
[19:40] this thing all the way down to the Bible
[19:41] think about Elijah said he said Elisha
[19:44] if you want a double anointing that's a
[19:45] hard thing to ask he said but if you
[19:47] watch me you'll get it by God's grace
[19:50] look at the word and new season you had
[19:52] to know you had to hear the word at the
[19:54] right time
[19:56] the church as children of god let's just
[19:58] let's just agree to this tonight I'm
[20:00] sure you do but let's just believe since
[20:02] God loves us so much God will bring us
[20:04] the word at the right time and he'll
[20:05] make sure we don't miss it too
[20:08] if God took Enoch in the Rapture without
[20:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we got
[20:13] it we're going to praise God Amen he had
[20:16] blood of bulls and ghosts we got the
[20:17] blood of Jesus Christ
[20:19] speaks better things
[20:21] better things
[20:23] that's just how I believe that's how I
[20:25] believe it that's how I live my life
[20:27] I know there's I know there's five and a
[20:29] six hour services like Saturday night
[20:30] but I also know there's two hour
[20:32] services
[20:34] right
[20:35] think about that if you did a six hour
[20:37] service every night how would you feel
[20:38] after about a couple days
[20:41] you wouldn't be able to come to church
[20:42] you'd be passed out
[20:44] you'd be in the hospital
[20:46] they'd be pumping oxygen in you at least
[20:48] I would be if I was preaching
[20:50] I know that I'd be out of water and
[20:52] everything
[20:53] but you could take this all out onto the
[20:56] Bible you know
[20:57] God's word always comes at the right
[20:59] season right when you need it that's
[21:01] just what you needed to hear exactly
[21:03] right
[21:04] praise God
[21:06] now of course they needed natural rain
[21:08] in due season and God promised Israel if
[21:10] you walk in my statutes and keep my
[21:12] Commandments to them then I'll give you
[21:13] the rain right at the right time
[21:16] you obey God's word I'll send the rain
[21:18] right when your seeds needed
[21:20] remember rain something they can't
[21:22] control
[21:24] so the natural needs were based upon
[21:26] their spiritual obedience
[21:29] that's now that's not here in America
[21:30] right because people we have sin loving
[21:33] Nations or cities like New York and
[21:34] California they still get rain I know
[21:36] California is running out that might be
[21:38] a spiritual application but
[21:40] it wasn't like on one nation like with
[21:42] Israel just one God was focusing on that
[21:44] one nation right one nation
[21:47] so this was based upon the natural rain
[21:50] and due season was based upon their
[21:52] spiritual obedience in every season
[21:56] another one uh revolving I'm sorry
[21:59] involving sacrifices God no no notice
[22:02] God required them at the certain season
[22:04] to make a sacrifice
[22:06] he said he told Moses command the
[22:08] children of Israel and say to them my
[22:10] offering and my bread and for my
[22:11] sacrifices made by fire for a sweet
[22:12] saber to me you should observe them to
[22:14] offer me in their due season
[22:16] so God had a set season also
[22:19] God said you got to obey me and then he
[22:21] said you got to do it at the right
[22:22] season
[22:23] praise God now we know the seven piece
[22:25] of Israel I preached on that I wrote it
[22:26] you know I got I got it in chapter two I
[22:28] think it is in my book in the 2021 book
[22:31] but God had specific details here's how
[22:33] you Worship On this day and then uh uh
[22:35] you know the the first three feasts were
[22:37] three days in a row right and then you
[22:39] 50 days to the Feast of Weeks and then
[22:40] three more months and then you had three
[22:42] more feasts right in a row
[22:44] and these were specific times if they
[22:46] wanted God's favor they had to be
[22:48] obedient in the right season
[22:51] right so let's let's uh let's have it in
[22:54] our hearts tonight that we're going to
[22:55] make the sacrifices when God wants us to
[22:58] praise God let's not let's out withhold
[23:00] worship let's not withhold of sacrifice
[23:02] let's give God everything we can praise
[23:04] God
[23:06] which actually let me go back here you
[23:08] did do that last weekend by God's grace
[23:10] by making the great sacrifice to go
[23:12] there if you could I know we Austin was
[23:13] working and everything like that but I'm
[23:15] just saying the people that could get
[23:16] off and I know Austin wanted to make
[23:17] that sacrifice praise God uh that's just
[23:19] just the point I'm making everybody
[23:21] brother Cam and them were blessed by the
[23:23] sacrifice that was made
[23:25] and look here George here you know
[23:27] behind this it wasn't like a legalistic
[23:28] like God's mad at me God's love was
[23:31] behind all this and that's why I always
[23:33] want you to see and I hope you felt that
[23:35] when I as I preached it obedience is
[23:37] always based upon love
[23:39] God's not trying to beat us down and
[23:41] make us feel like we're just Mindless
[23:43] robots it's all like God's love wants us
[23:46] to obey
[23:47] God love God's love wants us to draw
[23:49] closer to him like the motivation is
[23:51] always love
[23:53] it's not that we're worthless or
[23:55] anything like that or or we should feel
[23:56] worthless God doesn't come to condemn us
[23:58] but in God's love God God is saying this
[24:00] is going to produce the best life for
[24:02] you
[24:03] this is going to produce happiness for
[24:04] you if you can mortify your desires if
[24:07] you can crucify your desires it'll make
[24:09] you the happiest you ever be right
[24:12] if we're not convinced of that look at
[24:14] the people out there still addicted to
[24:15] drugs look at the people that have been
[24:17] married two three four times they think
[24:19] they think uh satisfying their flesh is
[24:21] going to make them happier it doesn't it
[24:23] makes them angrier
[24:26] it makes them bitter right it makes it
[24:28] makes them sad it makes them depressed
[24:30] God's ways always produce Joy
[24:35] he said this is a land the Lord thy God
[24:37] cares for the eyes of the Lord God are
[24:40] always upon Him God's always looking
[24:41] after this land now what about the bride
[24:43] amen if you just looked at that natural
[24:45] piece of land what about his his
[24:47] blood-bought people praise God
[24:49] the Bible said the Bible even says God's
[24:51] eyes run to and fro around the whole
[24:52] world
[24:53] right his eyes are constantly running
[24:55] around the whole world well if you
[24:57] believe it's flat then it's like this I
[24:58] guess
[25:00] [Laughter]
[25:03] but they're they're constantly running
[25:04] around
[25:06] and look the Bible says God's always on
[25:08] it oh isn't that beautiful
[25:12] church God don't sleep or slumber
[25:15] you know you're going through a hard
[25:15] time God's not sleeping God you hear me
[25:18] God uh can you wake up Lord no he hears
[25:20] us all the time
[25:22] he's testing us he's training us praise
[25:24] God he's teaching us to trust in him
[25:26] praise God
[25:28] look from the beginning of the year even
[25:30] what to the end
[25:32] praise God we're almost in the middle of
[25:33] this year
[25:35] is he still with us yes he said he'll be
[25:37] there at the beginning he'll be there at
[25:38] the end too
[25:39] he's right here in the middle almost
[25:40] we're almost to the middle
[25:42] it should come to pass if you shall dip
[25:44] now looking look at this hearken
[25:46] diligently in other words put your whole
[25:47] heart into it
[25:49] unto my Commandments which I command you
[25:50] this day to love the Lord your God see
[25:52] the love hearken diligently in other
[25:54] words give God your love with all of you
[25:56] all that you've got serving with all
[25:58] your heart with your soul that'll give
[25:59] you the reign of your land in his due
[26:01] season the first Reign the latter rain
[26:02] that thou mayest Gather in thy corn and
[26:04] thy wine and thine oil see it's about
[26:07] love it's about letting love motivate
[26:09] you to diligently certain I'm sorry
[26:11] diligently serve God
[26:13] pardon me
[26:15] this chapter is beautiful I read this
[26:16] this week I I hope I can convey this
[26:18] help me Holy Spirit to convey this
[26:22] uh this is a long chapter but he says
[26:24] there go the ships and there's the
[26:27] Leviathan remember that's the water the
[26:28] water dinosaur
[26:30] the Bible Hebrew calls it a serpent it's
[26:33] a serpent dinosaur
[26:35] talk about those sea serpents right they
[26:37] got movies about sea serpents well yeah
[26:39] there used to be I used to be whom thou
[26:41] Hast made to play therein
[26:44] now look Church These weights all upon
[26:48] thee that thou mayest give them their
[26:50] meat in due season
[26:53] that thou give us them they gather thou
[26:56] openest thine hand they are filled with
[26:58] good look church every living creature
[27:01] seeks food from God in their season
[27:06] I didn't look online but I could make a
[27:08] guess about how many
[27:10] billions of creatures there are in this
[27:12] world how many fish do you think really
[27:14] are in the ocean right now
[27:16] who could put a number on that
[27:18] how many how many whales or how many
[27:21] dolphins how many minnows are out there
[27:23] in the ocean how many crayfish
[27:25] right you can start naming all the life
[27:27] I've not studied up on that lately so I
[27:29] can't give you all the the different
[27:30] kinds
[27:31] but look the Bible said every single
[27:34] living creatures waiting on God to feed
[27:36] them now what about you
[27:39] how many waiting on God to feed them
[27:43] I think I think the creator of all the
[27:45] world one person God sits up there he
[27:47] says I can take I can feed all of them
[27:49] I only have to make a Sweat Right
[27:54] he said they're all going to come to his
[27:55] hand and they're going to all feed out
[27:57] of his hand
[27:58] that's how God pictures all creation
[28:01] coming to him
[28:02] to feed him to give them what their meat
[28:05] in due season
[28:06] God it's been a hard season just wait
[28:08] Church his hands open praise God
[28:11] stands open that's what the Bible says
[28:14] he opens his hand he said here it is
[28:16] just keep trusting to me
[28:20] so it's the sea serpents not anymore I
[28:23] don't know if there are any more but
[28:24] the sea dinosaurs they're waiting on God
[28:27] can you imagine the dinosaurs are
[28:28] swimming through the ocean I'm just
[28:30] waiting on you Lord I'm just waiting on
[28:31] you
[28:32] how silly can I make myself look
[28:35] to try to get the point across
[28:37] or just swimming
[28:40] I'm waiting on you Lord I'm waiting for
[28:41] waiting for a good catch here pretty
[28:43] soon I'll just keep swimming until I
[28:45] finally get something
[28:46] every one of them Church
[28:49] every one of them just waiting on the
[28:51] Lord see church now we don't feel so
[28:53] alone do we
[28:55] all of creation is Waiting on Jesus
[28:58] Christ
[28:59] oh he's faithful
[29:04] now earlier in this chapter
[29:06] the Young Lions Roar after they pray and
[29:08] what they do they seek their meat from
[29:11] from who
[29:12] Mother Nature
[29:16] the zebra families
[29:19] see even the lions are looking to God
[29:23] for food
[29:25] so next time you squirm you watch an
[29:27] animal kill another the next time you
[29:28] scream I don't feel so bad because God
[29:30] provided that
[29:33] lions are there in the world and God
[29:35] each one God knows each one well that
[29:37] one needs a
[29:38] that one needs food I think about a
[29:40] zookeeper they got they got a schedule
[29:41] right they gotta feed this one at that
[29:43] time how about God's schedule
[29:45] in the zoo of the world
[29:48] the zoo of the entire Earth he's got it
[29:51] all planned out
[29:53] same chapter he sends the Springs into
[29:55] the valley so he sends water to The
[29:57] Valleys which run among the Hills
[29:59] they give drink to every beast of the
[30:00] field the wild asses quench their thirst
[30:04] by them shall the fowls of the heaven
[30:06] have their habitation which sing among
[30:08] the branches
[30:09] so all the beasts rely upon the Lord for
[30:11] water God sent the water out there right
[30:13] where he knew it would be it gives them
[30:15] food gives him water
[30:18] every Beast relies on the Lord he causes
[30:21] the grass to grow for the cattle the
[30:22] herb for the service of man
[30:24] I should show that to my wife she'd like
[30:26] that she's a herbal that's right
[30:28] that he may bring forth food out of the
[30:31] Earth the wine that maketh glad the
[30:33] heart of man and the oil to make his
[30:35] face shine and bread which strengtheneth
[30:37] the man's heart
[30:41] he said I will sing unto the Lord as
[30:43] long as I live I will sing praise to my
[30:44] God while I have my being my meditation
[30:47] of him shall be sweet or Pleasant
[30:50] so so thinking of all this thinking of
[30:52] all that all nature is waiting on God to
[30:54] feed them they're all Waiting for God to
[30:56] open up his hand and feed them that
[30:58] ought to make us have sweet meditation
[31:00] about Jesus
[31:02] that if he's faithful to feed all those
[31:04] fouls of the air all the fish of the sea
[31:06] all the cattles of the field he he will
[31:09] give us our food in due season as well
[31:12] they're talking so much natural I'm
[31:13] talking about spiritual praise God
[31:15] thank God for the natural blessings in
[31:17] America thank God
[31:20] and then he kind of kind of gives a
[31:21] rebuke on Sinners there and he says
[31:23] bless thou the Lord O My Soul bless ye
[31:25] the Lord so church that's tonight you
[31:27] know as we're as we're you know moving
[31:29] on here I'm not sure when I'm finishing
[31:31] meditate on God's pleasantness and look
[31:33] at this his absolute faithfulness to all
[31:36] living creatures he is absolutely
[31:38] faithful
[31:40] when a lion's hungry he Roars we think
[31:43] he's roaring to scare him away but he's
[31:44] probably worn to God
[31:49] where where's my meat in due season God
[31:52] hears it
[31:53] God said I'm getting ready
[31:55] there it is he'll open his hand and feed
[31:58] him
[32:00] that's how much God cares he is
[32:02] absolutely faithful
[32:05] to feed the Natural Things of this world
[32:08] so he is the spiritual now church now
[32:10] think about that with with our with our
[32:12] two sermons we heard from Sunday right
[32:13] or I heard the one from the
[32:15] denominations and the one we had
[32:18] ours is the only one where God opened up
[32:20] his hand and said come feed on my word
[32:22] the other one was not God's hand
[32:26] right
[32:28] if they sought God's hand if you seek me
[32:31] you'll find me
[32:33] so see they're seeking after what bigger
[32:35] buildings fancier musicians or more
[32:37] popular musicians and bigger production
[32:40] more money that's what they're seeking
[32:42] after popularity we're seeking after the
[32:45] Risen Christ
[32:48] and again I'm not trying to be critical
[32:50] I hope everybody can feel that I'm not
[32:52] trying to be critical I'm just saying
[32:53] there has to be a difference there has
[32:54] to be because the Bible says so there's
[32:56] a famine in this land and most people
[32:59] are not hearing the word of God well I
[33:01] don't want to be one of those I want to
[33:02] be one of the people that hear God's
[33:04] word
[33:07] and church honestly with all my heart
[33:09] my soul is not in a drought
[33:12] I feel refreshed
[33:14] if I've ever felt refreshing it'd be
[33:18] from this weekend praise God
[33:21] but let me say this too because of my
[33:24] sins and my failure sometimes sometimes
[33:26] I feel like I'm in a drought you'd have
[33:28] to say Amen too loud
[33:30] but I'll be honest there's times I feel
[33:32] like I'm gonna drown but that's my fault
[33:35] but if I look at the overall course of
[33:37] my life God is sending his reign
[33:40] the God is set in his room I'm saying
[33:42] Lord Send the Rain send the word he
[33:43] sends the word in new season
[33:46] you know why because he cares
[33:50] he loves to send his word to his people
[33:54] every time I go back to the Bible every
[33:55] time I go back to brother and quote I
[33:57] hear something oh that's right that's
[33:58] right I forgot about that Hallelujah
[34:00] that's new oh thank you Jesus amen it's
[34:02] refreshing
[34:04] the times are refreshing come from the
[34:06] presence of the Lord the Bible says

[34:19] Lord upholdeth now look he upholds all
[34:21] that fall

[34:37] around and he'll lift you up
[34:39] to push that chest back a little bit and
[34:41] lift your head up
[34:43] if you're not just looking at your your
[34:45] symptoms all the time or looking at your
[34:46] situation he'll cause you to look up to
[34:48] heaven seek ye things that are above
[34:50] praise God

[34:52] the Majesty on high praise God
[34:55] ah it's the one who Catches Us God's the
[34:57] one that will straighten us up again
[34:59] praise God
[35:01] this is the Old Testament
[35:03] the Lord and he says the eyes of all
[35:06] wait upon thee so look everybody's
[35:07] really looking to God everybody animals
[35:10] humans everyone's looking
[35:12] we're all waiting on God and God is
[35:15] faithful to give them their meat in due
[35:17] season
[35:19] everybody's looking at him right
[35:21] everybody's looking what's he going to
[35:22] do when are you going to send it God

[35:30] or I I want my I want my loved ones to
[35:34] be saved everybody's looking to God at
[35:37] all these things and the Bible said God
[35:39] is faithful to give them their meat in
[35:40] due season
[35:42] he's faithful
[35:43] he's faithful
[35:45] he says Thou openest thine hand and
[35:47] satisfies the desire of every living
[35:50] thing every
[35:52] every how many plants are there in the
[35:54] world
[35:55] how many trees how many ants are there
[35:57] in the world
[35:59] God satisfied my
[36:02] monsters I hope your worry or your doubt
[36:04] or fear is starting to fade praise God
[36:05] yes
[36:08] he hears every one of them
[36:11] it's it's amazing when I read this the
[36:13] other day I was like what
[36:15] I said God I was like forgive me
[36:18] why do you doubt so much
[36:20] silly
[36:22] he's so human all the time
[36:25] trust the Lord
[36:30] without counsel purposes are
[36:32] disappointing of course that's Holy
[36:34] Ghost Council Jesus I counted I
[36:36] counseled thee to buy of me gold tried
[36:38] in the fire
[36:39] white Raymond I South
[36:43] also you know you can look at in the
[36:45] book of Acts you know when there was
[36:46] questions they would go to the elders
[36:47] they would go to Paul and James and
[36:50] Peter
[36:51] so trusted people so there's times when
[36:53] we do need to have counsel from others
[36:55] I've needed it we all need it
[36:57] but in the multitude of counselors they
[36:59] are established
[37:01] but you want Godly counselors in your
[37:03] life
[37:06] um a man has Joy by the answer of his
[37:08] mouth
[37:10] and a word spoken in due season how good
[37:13] it is
[37:14] think of what brother man spoke to
[37:15] Hattie Wright you know I think about
[37:17] what Hattie Wright said that's nothing
[37:18] but the truth brother Brandon that was a
[37:20] word in due season
[37:22] because it brought forth the salvation
[37:23] of her voice
[37:25] think about I read this remember a
[37:26] couple weeks ago Mina's tumor
[37:29] she was going getting ready to go to the
[37:31] appointment there and the Holy Spirit
[37:32] said stand up
[37:34] and brother Brown stood up and he says
[37:35] whatever you say that's what will be and
[37:37] brother man said before the doctor's
[37:38] hand could touch the tumor it will
[37:40] vanish
[37:41] and then just maybe an hour later she
[37:43] was there to you know Across the Nation
[37:45] she was there at the doctor's office was
[37:47] sitting on the table had the tumor and
[37:50] within a few moments it vanished by
[37:51] God's grace
[37:54] a word in due season how good it is
[37:59] and then of course I'll get to this
[38:00] later but the Easter Service is there in
[38:02] Napoleon it was the word in due season
[38:06] a word in due season
[38:08] and just to prove that you know not
[38:09] every Service is like that Sarah nice
[38:11] service right
[38:13] because it's a different different
[38:14] season
[38:15] you know it's a different time it's a
[38:18] different need for that night
[38:22] like I was thinking too like I don't
[38:23] know if I haven't been in a service like
[38:25] that that long
[38:29] maybe 10 or 11 or 12 years
[38:31] that long
[38:33] it's been a while it's been a while
[38:36] um
[38:37] well like but like I said again you know
[38:39] we don't make those type of service
[38:41] those types of services aren't evidence
[38:43] that we're born again
[38:46] and let me give you some Bible proof on
[38:47] that okay everybody ready for this
[38:49] are we ready
[38:51] okay
[38:52] Acts chapter 10.
[38:54] Peter sees a vision
[38:57] right no Lord honest it's unclean I'm
[38:59] never gonna eat that he said go to the
[39:00] house of cardios
[39:02] Cornelius bows down to worship and he
[39:04] said get up I'm just a man
[39:06] he said but I got something to preach to
[39:08] you go gather your people
[39:10] he preached him a five-minute sermon and
[39:13] the Holy Ghost fell in that place amen
[39:15] amen and the church said
[39:17] did he have to pray all night
[39:19] the corneas have to fast all night
[39:22] do they have to have a five hour service
[39:24] no
[39:25] he was already Justified and Sanctified
[39:28] he was ready for God's spirit to pour
[39:30] into and praise God oh he was ready for
[39:33] the word and due season praise God
[39:35] amen but do we so see it doesn't take a
[39:37] five-hour service that's why the Bible
[39:39] doesn't say thou shalt pray all night
[39:40] and then get the Holy Ghost the Bible
[39:42] don't say that
[39:44] you get the Holy Ghost when you're ready
[39:45] for that word and due season praise God
[39:47] what's the season forget born again
[39:48] that's when you get born again
[39:50] but those are great special moments you
[39:52] know when you have long surfaces or pray
[39:54] all night or whatever whatever God gives
[39:56] you those are special moments to enjoy
[39:58] the presence of God
[40:00] but Cornelius didn't have to wait five
[40:02] hours
[40:03] he just had a five I mean you could look
[40:05] at the it was a five-minute sermon if
[40:06] that
[40:08] and the Holy Ghost fell right there so
[40:10] see what we want to be doing we want to
[40:12] be balanced in the word of God
[40:14] that's what we really want
[40:16] and yes we want to draw all night of God
[40:18] yes we want to enjoy the presence of God
[40:21] but really
[40:23] the word in due season is what God
[40:25] determines it to be
[40:31] and then of course this is a parable I'm
[40:33] not going to just for times like I'm not
[40:34] gonna I could preach a whole sermon on
[40:36] just this parable
[40:37] but Jesus says who is that he's talking
[40:39] about the day and the hour no man knows
[40:41] and two will be in a field want to be
[40:43] taken two will be in a bed want to be
[40:44] taken of course the Rapture he said who
[40:46] then is that faithful and wise servant
[40:48] whom his Lord hath made him ruler over
[40:50] his household to give them meat in due
[40:52] season so so Jesus gives two different
[40:54] kind of preachers one of them he's
[40:57] looking for the coming of the Lord and
[40:58] so he's feeding the people meat so they
[41:00] can be ready for the Lord's coming
[41:02] the other one says oh he's the land is
[41:05] coming Jesus ain't coming back anytime
[41:06] soon I'm going to start smiting the
[41:08] people I'm gonna start beating the
[41:10] people and I'm gonna start getting drunk
[41:16] so you have two different kinds now
[41:18] church I believe we gotta we have
[41:20] faithful ministers that come to our
[41:21] church I believe I'm a faithful Minister
[41:22] I believe you're getting the meet and
[41:24] due season
[41:25] if I didn't
[41:27] uh I need to be voted out praise God
[41:29] and get somebody in here who who will
[41:31] feed your soul Faithfully praise God
[41:34] I've been standing at this Pulpit I've
[41:36] been standing at this Pulpit since 2006
[41:38] praise God
[41:39] almost 17 years giving people the meat
[41:42] and due season praise God Amen I see
[41:46] myself growing in the grace of God now
[41:48] Naomi Naomi who would have thought we'd
[41:49] been dancing in Akron praise God like
[41:51] you dancing God praise God
[41:53] see we're growing right we're growing
[41:56] did you almost feel home on Saturday
[41:57] night by the way
[41:59] let's give her a horizon
[42:03] that's what I was thinking of something
[42:04] I was like I wonder if her and Beatrice
[42:06] are really enjoying this or not I wonder
[42:08] if they feel like they're free like they
[42:09] are at home you know because I've always
[42:11] desired that you know I've always known
[42:12] you know they have a dance they get to
[42:14] dance in Ghana almost every service
[42:16] I just always wanna I hope they can feel
[42:18] at home some at some point in America
[42:24] Hallelujah
[42:28] but see a faithful Minister gives people
[42:30] the word a new season now like I've told
[42:32] you sometimes I come to Papa I don't
[42:34] even know what I'm going to preach and
[42:35] God will give you the meat
[42:36] sometimes I know I got directly like
[42:38] Saturday night I knew that was exactly
[42:40] God's service for that night
[42:43] nobody was going to talk me out of that
[42:47] I knew two months ago I was going to
[42:48] preach that sermon at Cam's Church
[42:51] if you would ask me I would have told
[42:53] you I can actually prove it I got my
[42:54] journal I got over in January I was a
[42:57] preached dancing in the point
[42:58] I can show you
[43:00] I knew I was going to preach out I knew
[43:02] that was the word in due season
[43:04] um I had uh three or four Witnesses on
[43:06] that I knew it was the right the right
[43:08] message
[43:09] but it's all God it's all God you know
[43:12] sometimes you just sometimes you just
[43:13] know things
[43:14] sometimes you just know things
[43:17] it's what is it it's God leading you
[43:19] because we're just sheep and we can't
[43:21] lead ourselves
[43:22] so I need somebody to Lead Me praise God
[43:25] because God just leads us right he leads
[43:27] us on
[43:30] um I just got a couple more here let's
[43:31] see yeah
[43:33] be not deceived church God is Not mocked
[43:36] for whatsoever man plants in his life
[43:38] that will he Harvest
[43:41] whatever we plant every single day
[43:43] that's the kind of things we're going to
[43:44] harvest
[43:48] if we plant to the flesh if we enjoy
[43:50] sins and keep sinning we're gonna of the
[43:54] flesh reap corruption
[43:57] but if we sow to the Holy Spirit
[44:00] so shall we reap of the spirit life
[44:03] Everlasting
[44:06] I love this let us not be weary in
[44:09] well-doing I wonder how many sermons I
[44:11] preach from the time we you know in 2011
[44:13] when I dance around there for I dance
[44:14] for two hours around that church I
[44:16] wonder how many sermons I preached from
[44:17] 2011 until last Saturday night
[44:22] some of those I could have got weary
[44:25] I could look back and said when are we
[44:26] ever going to have Revival
[44:29] right I could have
[44:30] I could have got weary in well doing I
[44:33] could say well I'll just throw in the
[44:35] towel we're never gonna have Revival
[44:36] what do we keep believing we keep
[44:38] believing that God keeps his word
[44:41] and God orders the events of Our Lives
[44:43] anyway
[44:45] right our thing is to just keep crying
[44:47] out for meat and due season
[44:49] because that's what all the that's what
[44:50] all living creatures do feed me Lord
[44:52] feed me Lord Roar feed me Lord whatever
[44:58] like a lion
[45:01] that's what we must do we must say God
[45:03] feed me God feed me God feed me God feed
[45:04] me and he'll say I'll feed you at the
[45:06] right time
[45:08] I always give meat in due season praise
[45:10] God I'm faithful to every living
[45:12] creature
[45:15] because in just be just be faithful
[45:17] church that's the main thing I found
[45:18] just be faithful to God just Faithfully
[45:20] confess your sins seek God every day be
[45:22] as faithful as possible in due season we
[45:25] will reap a harvest if we faint not
[45:30] and as we have therefore opportunity
[45:32] let's keep our eyes open let's do good
[45:34] unto all men but especially the Saints
[45:37] right here in Akron and the church said
[45:39] let's be especially good to one another
[45:43] I hope I'm good to you
[45:45] I really want to be good to you
[45:48] you're the ones God put in my circle of
[45:50] influence I can't help people other any
[45:52] other place I can only help the people
[45:54] right here
[45:56] I hope I've been good to you praise God
[45:58] that's what I want to do
[46:00] I want to keep doing that if I have by
[46:02] God's grace I believe I have if I'm not
[46:04] God help me
[46:05] we should especially be good to those of
[46:08] the household of faith
[46:15] now so the final brother brand closes
[46:17] this sermon Here's the final application
[46:19] he uses I kind of mentioned it earlier
[46:20] but just so you can see it notice there
[46:22] was meal in the barrel every time she
[46:24] went after the meal now brother man
[46:25] breaks into the next story
[46:27] but his text was only you know with with
[46:30] Elijah at the brook and the Ravens
[46:33] feeding him but he breaks into this
[46:34] other the next story it's verses eight
[46:36] to
[46:37] 16. every time that Widow went to the
[46:40] meal there was a meal in the barrel
[46:42] there was oil in the cruise every time
[46:43] she went for it why meal represented
[46:46] Christ in the meal offering the birds
[46:47] had to be set just right to grind every
[46:49] one of them every bird of this meal
[46:51] exactly the same showing that he's the
[46:52] same yesterday today and forever that
[46:54] was the word the bread of life following
[46:56] the message to vindicate the word
[46:59] so it is today friends so it is today
[47:01] that the bread of life that children eat
[47:03] on it follows the message of God to
[47:06] sustain them during the time of the
[47:08] drought
[47:09] so while everybody is in a drought we
[47:12] are not
[47:13] we have we have food in this drought
[47:16] we are sustained we're not ignored and
[47:19] we're not starving we have sustainment
[47:22] we have nourishment praise God we have
[47:25] nourishment in the midst of this drought
[47:28] right
[47:29] what if he stood in our presence today
[47:31] what if he stood in our presence right
[47:33] now we would act and do just exactly
[47:35] like he'd done the days when he was in
[47:36] the flesh here on Earth so Jesus
[47:39] he would do the same
[47:41] right
[47:43] Jesus would act the same
[47:45] I imagine Church don't you think he'd
[47:46] rebuked some of us for not have enough
[47:48] faith
[47:49] but would you ever leave us or forsake
[47:51] us of course not
[47:53] if it I mean if I can handle rebuke from
[47:55] anybody it's Jesus praise God because he
[47:57] died for me he loves me amen I know he
[48:00] wants the best for me praise God
[48:02] and I'm not trying to hang around with
[48:03] the devil I'm trying to hang around with
[48:04] Jesus Christ praise God I'm trying to
[48:06] he's my best friend he's my Lord praise
[48:07] God I can handle a review from Jesus
[48:10] he's only going to help me praise God
[48:11] the only what's the best for me amen
[48:13] I'm his child you're his child
[48:16] amen you're his son you're his daughter
[48:18] praise God
[48:20] he would treat us the same way as he did
[48:22] the disciples in the Bible
[48:25] the bride is part of the husband the
[48:27] church is the same as Christ The Works
[48:29] that I do shall you do also
[48:31] it is the word that done it he told us
[48:32] the things that he did that he would
[48:35] also do we notice here again if the word
[48:37] is in us and has come to us as it did to
[48:40] Elijah in that day it'll do the same
[48:41] thing that he did it would feed on the
[48:43] secret things of God which is hid from
[48:44] the world
[48:46] oh again it makes the message and the
[48:48] messenger won
[48:49] the spiritual food is ready and it's in
[48:51] season now
[48:53] and each one of you can have this food
[48:55] if you wish how many wish for it
[48:58] if now here you can have it if you're
[49:00] willing to what steal away from all the
[49:02] unbelief
[49:05] so in other words you gotta you have to
[49:06] say I'm not gonna disbelieve I'm gonna
[49:08] believe
[49:11] if you're ready to come into Christ come
[49:14] into his promise
[49:17] and what are these promises brother Jess
[49:18] I'll be happy to read them I'm actually
[49:20] making this video I'm almost done with
[49:21] this video there's I got 30 verses of
[49:23] how brother Ram defines the message
[49:25] I got 30 right now I'm sure there's a
[49:28] lot more
[49:29] I'm about 33 done hopefully I can have
[49:31] it done by Friday or Saturday
[49:33] and remember his promises in Malachi 4
[49:36] Luke 17 30 also Saint John 14 12 and how
[49:39] many more scriptures of telling Joel 2
[49:41] 28. what he would do in these last days
[49:43] how the prophet said it'd be light in
[49:45] these last days how it would work what
[49:47] it would do and all the scriptures
[49:48] pointing these last days and that is
[49:51] Christ what is what is Christ the
[49:53] scriptures are Christ
[49:56] Hallelujah if you can hide away in that
[50:00] now in what
[50:02] I'm gonna how can I hide in Malachi 4.
[50:07] because I can see I'm one of the
[50:09] children whose hearts are turned back to
[50:11] the fathers
[50:13] I gotta hide in that verse in other
[50:15] words God I'm just a child and just turn
[50:17] my heart to be like the book of Acts
[50:18] praise God Amen
[50:21] right
[50:22] how could I hide I can hide in John 14
[50:25] 12 The Works that I do so you do also we
[50:28] gotta hide in that
[50:31] yes I can lay my hands on the sick they
[50:34] shall recover
[50:36] Hallelujah some of us will speak in
[50:37] tongues the Bible says these signs
[50:40] follow them that believe praise God
[50:42] some of us will cast out devils like I
[50:44] said they'll cast them out with the
[50:45] music amen amen amen right
[50:49] if you're sick there's healing oh yeah
[50:51] I'm sorry if you can hide away in that
[50:53] now in that secret place you can eat and
[50:55] see the goodness and mercy of God
[50:59] see God's not hammering us like oh you
[51:01] poor person or you're awful person God
[51:04] it's God's care God cares God wants to
[51:08] pour His mercy and goodness on us
[51:13] in a time of drought he puts you in a
[51:16] place there where he can feed you and
[51:19] actually it's in Christ
[51:22] it's not by a brook
[51:24] right it's not an underground layer you
[51:26] know
[51:27] you know it's not it's not at the top of
[51:29] a skyscraper it's in Christ
[51:32] in Jesus Christ the word

[51:54] you're his creation and you're calling
[51:57] to him keep your promise Lord God
[52:00] I know you'll do it right but we're not
[52:01] gonna be discouraged
[52:03] you're going to keep your promise I'm
[52:06] your child
[52:07] open your hand to me open it up I need a
[52:09] great blessing praise God
[52:13] if you're sick there's healing there
[52:16] and now today he visits the Gentiles in
[52:18] their time and it's and you say why is
[52:21] it that the message don't go out in
[52:22] these great big places like these big
[52:24] Crusades like amongst the denominations
[52:26] it's not their food
[52:29] it's not the church so-called food it's
[52:31] the bride's food it's spiritual food in
[52:33] season
[52:35] it would make them sick at their stomach
[52:38] to hear a sermon about the serpent seed
[52:40] right
[52:42] to your sermon about marriage and
[52:43] divorce oh there's only one cause for
[52:45] remarriage
[52:46] that'd make them sick to their stomachs
[52:50] women having long hair and not wearing
[52:52] makeup and Men clean up their lives and
[52:55] not a bunch of whoremongers that would
[52:57] make them sick to their stomach
[53:01] it's too rich for them
[53:04] that's kind of how my wife is and she
[53:07] stayed from away from sugar so long like
[53:09] she can't even handle like some sweets I
[53:10] could still handle them
[53:12] sometimes I have sweets
[53:14] but she's been so far from sugar she
[53:17] can't even handle something I'm like
[53:18] really that tastes too sweet to me that
[53:20] sounds just right for me
[53:22] but it all depends like that's how it is
[53:24] not spiritually right
[53:26] the churches can't handle the richness
[53:28] of God's word
[53:30] that we that we receive it's too rich
[53:32] for them brothers says it's too rich
[53:34] and make them sick to their stomach
[53:37] he says see you can't you can't do it
[53:39] but for the children it's bread it's
[53:41] life
[53:42] it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[53:44] today and forever
[53:48] now we're going to get too late if we
[53:50] don't start the prayer line I want you
[53:51] to see I want you to listen to his
[53:53] prayer listen to prayer before he starts
[53:54] this is finishing finishing up the
[53:56] thought it's just a simple short sermon
[53:57] spiritual food and due season
[54:00] dear God food induced season spiritual
[54:02] food something that the world knows
[54:04] nothing of I didn't know nothing about
[54:06] this I was raised in church I didn't
[54:07] know nothing about the spiritual food we
[54:09] got today
[54:10] all these great Promises of God
[54:13] how we hear our Lord say that night or
[54:15] that day down there at Samaria the same
[54:17] place that Elisha walked up and said why
[54:19] the Dew will not fall for I call oh
[54:20] there's a mistake in me there you go it
[54:22] was Elijah
[54:23] Elijah not Elijah
[54:26] every words I say the Lord
[54:29] here's to Jesus there tell his disciples
[54:31] said Master why don't you eat he said
[54:33] look at that in John 4 he said I have
[54:35] food that you don't know of
[54:38] what was Jesus food
[54:42] the food was to do the will of God
[54:46] to see the works of God May manifest in
[54:48] his hour
[54:50] praise God
[54:54] he was there to see that it was done I
[54:56] do nothing except my father shows me
[54:58] first what the father shows me that I do
[55:02] and father so is it today the church the
[55:04] True Believer the body of Believers has
[55:07] access to food spiritual food that the
[55:09] nominals know nothing about the world
[55:11] knows nothing about of this food father
[55:12] but your church your people the Bride of
[55:15] your son loves it
[55:17] oh I love this word amen bring Simon in
[55:20] here bring cam in here bring brother
[55:21] Diggs in here bring brother Brian
[55:23] Hawkins in here I love God's food praise
[55:25] God
[55:26] I'm going to say Amen to God's food
[55:28] because I know it's just going to be
[55:30] just exactly what I need at the right
[55:31] hour
[55:35] we have access to healing of our bodies
[55:37] when the doctors has failed we have
[55:39] access to this it's one of the foods of
[55:41] God that He gave to his church and
[55:43] promised in the last day to his
[55:45] believing children and father help us to
[55:47] be believing children for all things are
[55:49] possible to the Believers granted dear
[55:51] God we ask it in Jesus name
[55:53] amen
[55:54] and notice this is just kind of for me
[55:56] but also for you the importance of
[55:59] Doctrine we have to have the right
[56:00] Doctrine
[56:01] brother random in this sermon at the end
[56:03] brother man says but the lord gave me
[56:05] what I should do in my message he said
[56:06] do the work of evangelist make full
[56:08] proof of your ministry for the hour will
[56:10] arrive when they will not endure sound
[56:12] Doctrine if that hasn't come now every
[56:15] church denomination has turned me down
[56:16] they wouldn't endure sound Doctrine
[56:19] think of that
[56:20] why'd they turn brother Branham down
[56:22] because of his Doctrine
[56:24] right
[56:27] he said after their own lust so see true
[56:29] Doctrine will cut out all the lusts
[56:32] right it'll show the the sinfulness of
[56:34] lust
[56:36] they'll bring their own teachers in and
[56:38] they'll be turned into fables like I saw
[56:41] a preacher down in Georgia he has a huge
[56:43] mega church
[56:45] he he uh he's inviting homosexuals and
[56:48] he said homosexuals have way more faith
[56:50] than us
[56:51] because they still come to church even
[56:54] though churches preach against
[56:55] homosexuality he said they have more
[56:57] faith than me
[56:58] and this guy sold millions of books
[57:00] Christian
[57:03] he says they have more faith because
[57:05] they've been they've been spoken against
[57:06] yet they still come to church
[57:10] it's amazing what people will say
[57:13] but these are teachers bringing in their
[57:16] own lusts the Bible said they'll be
[57:17] itching ears
[57:19] now Church don't be wrong I want every
[57:21] homosexual to come in here but leave out
[57:23] not a homosexual
[57:25] praise God just like I want every
[57:27] fornicator to come in here leave out
[57:29] pure before God and not a fornicator
[57:30] anymore
[57:31] every cigarette smoker cocaine addict
[57:34] prostitute would ever be I want you to
[57:36] come in here but I want you to leave out
[57:38] Washed by the blood amen
[57:40] I want you to I want you to get out of
[57:42] that drought I want you to get the reign
[57:43] of Christ on your life praise God Amen
[57:45] once you get the refreshing and the
[57:47] presence of Jesus Christ amen
[57:50] so if you leave out of here refresh
[57:52] praise God
[57:53] change a new creature in Christ Jesus
[57:56] so I hope you understand what I'm saying
[57:58] by God's grace we want him to come in
[58:00] but we want them to be changed by the
[58:03] word of God
[58:06] okay I think I'll just finish up here
[58:08] um yeah the Bible says there come a time
[58:10] when they won't endure sound Doctrine
[58:12] and remember Simon preaches Balaam had
[58:14] the same Spirit anointing him on Moses
[58:16] but what was the difference the teaching
[58:18] of Moses Moses was what perfect that's
[58:21] one thing I believe we have by God's
[58:22] grace now we're not perfect every word
[58:24] but overall generally we have the
[58:26] perfect teaching of the Bible
[58:28] we don't have every detail but overall
[58:30] we have the complete teaching right
[58:31] three works of Grace we've got the
[58:33] Mysteries the Seven Seals Holy Ghost the
[58:36] power of God we teach perfectly on all
[58:39] these things for the most part
[58:40] no one's no one will ever be absolutely
[58:42] perfect outside of Christ
[58:44] but generally we have the complete
[58:45] revelation of true Doctrine
[58:48] and the Bible says my Doctrine shall
[58:50] drop as rain praise God hallelujah it's
[58:54] refreshing when you hear the real truth
[58:56] it's refreshing to you
[58:58] oh
[59:01] again like Saturday night brother Cam
[59:03] said oh we never heard a a
[59:06] the right balance on dancing like we did
[59:08] tonight he said it just dropped down
[59:10] like rain Harmony got wet I got wet
[59:14] praise God
[59:17] and then brother random says uh brother
[59:20] Brown says his ministry was the teaching
[59:22] reign
[59:22] so anyone that received brother Adam's
[59:24] teaching they got the reign of the Holy
[59:26] Spirit
[59:28] they got the reign of the doctrine
[59:31] right he says the latter rain can only
[59:33] come after the former Reign which is the
[59:35] teaching rain and the latter rain then
[59:37] is the Harvest rain how could this how
[59:39] could the how could Azusa Street which
[59:41] we preached on
[59:42] be the real thing when the teaching
[59:44] Reign had not yet come the prophet
[59:46] messenger who was to be sent to teach
[59:48] the people and their turn the hearts of
[59:50] the children back to the Pentecostal
[59:51] fathers had not yet come
[59:54] okay
