[7:02] Bible study Lord God we just ask Lord

[7:07] Lord God as she approaches the waters of
[7:09] Baptism Lord we ask father that you'd
[7:12] bless her life and Buster abundantly
[7:14] Lord for her desire to follow you Lord
[7:17] Lord I'm reminded of that little
[7:20] recording Lord on Teddy's button and how
[7:22] the pastor said one of your lambs is
[7:25] coming home Lord father thank you for
[7:27] bringing another lamb home Lord little
[7:29] haven let her serve you Lord faithfully
[7:32] reverently all the days of her life in
[7:34] Jesus Christ II never said amen praise
[7:38] the Lord let's take our let's stay in a
[7:39] little bit here let's stand here let's
[7:47] go to Acts chapter 2 we'll just read one
[7:49] scripture and then we'll go through the
[7:51] Word of God we have you know such a
[7:59] smaller crowd I just thought it'd be
[8:01] okay just to teach on water baptism
[8:03] we've talked to Haven a lot about water
[8:05] baptism but not going over some of the
[8:08] scriptures so maybe Lydia can be right
[8:10] there nakisha you having your Bible
[8:12] handy and Malachi you can pulp the
[8:14] Scriptures so Haven can see those
[8:15] scriptures and understand it a little
[8:18] better but we're thankful let's read
[8:25] verse 41 acts 2:41
[8:30] then they that gladly received his word
[8:32] were baptized and the same day there
[8:35] were added unto them about 3,000 souls
[8:39] and they continued steadfastly in the
[8:42] Apostles doctrine and fellowship and in
[8:44] breaking of bread and in prayers amen
[8:48] may God has busing the reading of his
[8:49] word you may be seated there by God's
[8:51] grace okay so we just want to start with
[9:02] that scripture Acts to about those who
[9:07] gladly received the Word of God were
[9:10] baptized by the grace of the Lord I like
[9:13] to go to Romans chapter 6 and let's make
[9:18] sure girls that we can have Haven look
[9:20] at these scriptures Romans 6:4 let's go
[9:22] right there to Romans 6:4 and I want to
[9:25] show again how when someone is baptized
[9:30] it represents the old nature the selfish
[9:33] sinful nature we could even say the
[9:36] selfish will of a person is dying going
[9:38] under the water and then a new creature
[9:41] is raised with a new will to want to
[9:43] serve God so Romans 6 verse 4 but
[9:47] actually why don't we read when we start
[9:51] at verse 1 we'll just read through a few
[9:52] verses here thank you me okay first one
[9:56] what shall we say then shall we continue
[9:58] in sin that grace may abound verse 2 god
[10:03] forbid how shall we that are dead to sin
[10:06] live any longer therein so as a
[10:11] Christian we should be dead to sin we
[10:13] should not want to serve sin any more
[10:15] verse 3 know ye not that so many of us
[10:19] as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[10:22] baptized into his death so when
[10:26] someone's baptized they're baptized into
[10:28] Christ death right he went and died here
[10:31] and died with all of our sins upon him
[10:33] and was raised right and when we die it
[10:36] shows that we're dying like Christ we're
[10:39] dying and the old nature sinful nature
[10:42] dies and
[10:43] new nature raised so verse four
[10:46] therefore we are buried and that's why
[10:48] we don't sprinkle we're actually
[10:49] supposed to be fully immersed in water
[10:51] were buried in water with him by baptism
[10:54] into death so we have to die to
[10:57] ourselves that's what it represents that
[11:00] like as Christ was raised up from the
[11:03] dead by the glory of the Father even so
[11:06] we also should walk in the newness of
[11:09] life and recently we've heard Haven talk
[11:12] about how you know her older siblings
[11:14] have been baptized and they're going to
[11:16] heaven and now she wants to go to heaven
[11:18] as well and she wants to serve the Lord
[11:21] to it
[11:22] Haven many times we'll talk about
[11:25] praying for her friends who haven't been
[11:27] baptized and one day we said well Haven
[11:29] you could be baptized to it and that
[11:32] kind of turned on the light in her heart
[11:34] you know that all I haven't been
[11:35] baptized I I want to be baptized and I
[11:38] want to serve the Lord so that we're
[11:41] very thankful for and that kind of
[11:44] struck her heart that she needs to be
[11:45] baptized so we're thankful for that and
[11:47] the scripture says that we walk in the
[11:49] newness of life verse 5 for if we have
[11:52] been planted together in the likeness of
[11:55] his death we shall also in the likeness
[11:59] of his resurrection so that's why we're
[12:02] all that's why we're buried in water
[12:04] it's just like when Jesus died he was
[12:06] resurrected same thing for us when we
[12:08] die to ourselves were raised to new
[12:10] resurrection and we're promised just
[12:12] like the Bible says here if we're
[12:14] planted we'll be raised right we have
[12:17] that promise if we're plants in the name
[12:19] of Jesus Christ
[12:20] we'll be raised in the name of Jesus
[12:21] Christ sohave Annette when I'll have
[12:24] that promise when she is baptized today
[12:26] by God's grace she'll have that promise
[12:28] if she was planted like Christ was
[12:30] planted she'll raise just like Christ
[12:32] was raised what a promise verse 6
[12:35] knowing this that our old man is
[12:37] crucified with him so it also is a sign
[12:41] that we've died right that the body of
[12:44] sin might be destroyed that henceforth
[12:45] we should not serve sin verse 7 for he
[12:49] that is dead is freed from sin now if we
[12:54] be dead with Christ we believe that we
[12:56] shall also
[12:58] live with him so that's what our the
[13:00] deadness to our will we've got to
[13:02] crucify the flesh and say I don't want
[13:04] to live selfishly anymore I want to live
[13:06] for Jesus Christ I'm gonna give him my
[13:08] whole life and that's what it represents
[13:11] verse 9 knowing that Christ being raised
[13:15] from the dead
[13:16] Dyess no more death hath no more
[13:19] dominion over him amen for in that he
[13:22] died he died unto sin once but in that
[13:25] he liveth he liveth unto God praise the
[13:29] Lord praise God
[13:30] all right and I want to go to the story
[13:33] of the the eunuch I believe it's in Acts
[13:35] chapter 8 Philip in the eunuch
[13:45] so it's Act chapter 8 verse 26 we'll
[13:54] just go through this story here
[13:57] I like haven to see this one as well
[14:03] x8 26 so Philip a course is at Samaria
[14:08] they're having a tremendous revival of
[14:11] evangelism with devils being cast out
[14:14] and people being healed and saved and
[14:16] baptized but then the Holy Spirit called
[14:19] Philip away from the revival after James
[14:21] and I'm sorry Peter and John got their
[14:23] God called him away to meet this eunuch
[14:30] here this Ethiopian eunuch so verse 26
[14:32] and the angel Lord spake unto Philip
[14:34] saying arise and go toward the south
[14:36] unto the way that go down from jerusalem
[14:39] unto gaza which is desert and he arose
[14:43] and went and behold a man of Ethiopia
[14:45] and eunuch of great authority under
[14:47] Candace queen of the Ethiopians who had
[14:51] the charge of all her treasure and had
[14:53] come to Jerusalem for to worship was
[14:56] returning and sitting in his chair at
[14:58] red Isaiah the prophet then the spirit
[15:01] said unto Philip go near and join
[15:03] thyself to this chariot and Philip ran
[15:07] thither to him and heard him read the
[15:10] prophet Isaiah
[15:11] and said understand this now what thou
[15:14] readest verse 31 and he said how can i
[15:17] except some man should guide me and he
[15:21] desired philip that he would come up and
[15:24] sit with him the place of the scripture
[15:27] which he read was this he was led as a
[15:30] sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb
[15:33] dumb before his Shearer so open he not
[15:37] his mouth in his humiliation his
[15:40] judgment was taken away and who shall
[15:42] declare his generation for his life is
[15:45] taken from the earth and the eunuch
[15:48] answered Philip and said I pray thee of
[15:50] whom speaketh the Prophet this of
[15:53] himself or of some other man then Philip
[15:57] opened his mouth and began at the same
[15:58] Scripture and preached unto Him Jesus
[16:02] now let's pause right there keep your
[16:03] spot there let's go to Isaiah 53 let's
[16:06] go to and read that so Haven can hear
[16:08] this here Isaiah 53 Isaiah 53
[16:20] [Music]
[16:32] first one is a 53 verse 1 Isaiah 53
[16:39] verse 1 now we'll read a few in here and
[16:50] I just want Haven to see this and I'm
[16:51] looking I had a picture I want to show
[16:53] her I can find it yeah this is pretty
[16:58] good one
[17:00] okay so Malachi if you can pull this up
[17:03] here you can switch over now it's a kind
[17:12] of a graphic one but it's not too
[17:14] graphic okay so as we read Isaiah 53
[17:19] Haven think about this in the Old
[17:21] Testament God had animals died for our
[17:23] sins
[17:24] well Isaiah 53 what the prot what the
[17:27] eunuch was reading said that there was
[17:30] gonna come another one who was gonna die
[17:32] for us so we wouldn't need animals
[17:34] anymore we would need a savior someone
[17:37] else to die for us and all of our sins
[17:41] were placed upon this lamb Jesus Jesus
[17:45] says the lamb right
[17:46] he's the Lamb of God who takes away the
[17:48] sins of the world so as we read this
[17:51] this is what Philip I'm sorry this is
[17:53] what the eunuch was reading he's like
[17:55] what does this mean and we're gonna see
[17:57] that all of Jesse's sins were put on
[17:59] Christ olive vein all of Kristen all of
[18:03] Haven sins were put on Christ and he
[18:06] died for your sins that you don't have
[18:08] to that we don't have to be punished he
[18:10] took the punishment so Isaiah 53 that's
[18:13] called us a substitution he took he took
[18:16] our place so we don't have to pay for
[18:18] our sins let's go to verse 2 isaiah 53:2
[18:26] for he shall grow up before him as a
[18:28] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[18:30] ground
[18:31] he hath no form nor comeliness and we
[18:34] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[18:35] should desire him he is this
[18:40] spies and rejected a men a man of
[18:42] sorrows and acquainted with grief and we
[18:45] hid as it were our faces from him and he
[18:48] was despised and we esteemed him not
[18:51] so Jesus wasn't a beautiful man he
[18:54] wasn't a handsome man we'd say he
[18:56] wouldn't attract any attention from
[18:58] anybody and when he died
[19:01] everybody forsook him in one way or
[19:03] another we know John was there and Mary
[19:05] his mother was there but everybody
[19:06] forsook him for to some extent because
[19:10] their sins verse 4 surely he hath borne
[19:13] our griefs and carried our sorrows yet
[19:14] we did esteem him stricken smitten of
[19:18] God and afflicted came out I go back
[19:20] over to the picture here for Haven so he
[19:25] bore our griefs so all of our griefs all
[19:29] of our pain and Haven knows - and our
[19:33] children if we've ever lied you know
[19:35] that's our fault right that's a grief
[19:36] but we've done to God but Jesus if we've
[19:40] sinned if we've stolen if we've done
[19:41] anything evil if we've cursed our
[19:44] parents or recursed a friend or anybody
[19:46] any of our griefs he born he poor he
[19:50] paid the price for all of our sins I'm
[19:53] gonna see if I can zoom in ok yeah
[19:54] that's even better ok so he took the
[19:58] price Heat he paid the penalty for all
[20:00] of our sins verse 5 but he was wounded
[20:03] for our transgressions he was wounded
[20:07] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[20:12] our peace was upon him and with His
[20:15] stripes we are healed amen we already
[20:20] are healed so we need Haven Haven needs
[20:23] to know that because today's her day
[20:26] all of your sins Haven that you already
[20:29] did or were already or do in the future
[20:32] Jesus already took all of them all of
[20:36] our sins were put upon him the Bible
[20:38] said and then he already healed us by
[20:42] taking all of our sins and all of our
[20:44] punishment he already offers us healing
[20:46] if we just believe that he took our
[20:48] place just like that Lamb if Israel
[20:51] bullit all of all of Israel's sins were
[20:54] transferred to that lamb when they would
[20:56] lay hands on that lamb all their sins
[20:58] left and now they were clean and so it
[21:01] is with Jesus when we believe in Jesus
[21:02] and when you say today you're gonna say
[21:05] I believe Jesus Christ the Son of God
[21:07] and when you say that spiritually all
[21:10] your sins have transferred to God's lamb
[21:14] and now you're clean and now you don't
[21:17] have to worry about being lost you have
[21:19] to worry about anything because Christ
[21:21] has paid the price for your sins he was
[21:24] God's lamb verse 6 all we like sheep
[21:28] have gone astray we all left Jesus at
[21:30] some point right all of us we have
[21:33] turned everyone to his own way and the
[21:38] Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us
[21:40] all that's why I said earlier Malachi's
[21:42] sins sister Naomi sins my sins all of
[21:47] our sins were placed upon the Lord Jesus
[21:50] Christ God knew it and God put all of
[21:52] our sins upon Jesus Christ he was
[21:57] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[21:58] opened not his mouth he's brought as a
[22:01] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[22:03] before his Shearer's is dumb so he
[22:05] opened not his mouth
[22:10] alright and that's what the the eunuch
[22:13] read there so let's go back to Acts
[22:14] chapter two maokai you can usually just
[22:17] leave it up there for now let's go back
[22:20] to Acts chapter two I'm sorry actually
[22:21] after eight where were you reading
[22:22] parmie look at verse 35 acts 8:35 now
[22:33] just go a little bit further I want to
[22:34] go too long you know but just wanna go a
[22:36] little bit further then we'll take her
[22:37] to the waters and baptism praise God
[22:40] X 8:35 then Philip opened his mouth and
[22:43] began to preach at the same Scripture
[22:45] and preached on em Jesus so I imagine or
[22:47] something like this Haven imagine Philip
[22:49] said now the one we just read about was
[22:53] God's lamb the Messiah has come this is
[22:56] speaking of God's Messiah he was gonna
[22:57] come and he was gonna take all their sin
[23:00] upon him and I imagine Philip said God
[23:02] sent the prophet Jesus of Nazareth he
[23:05] came to earth and God anointed him with
[23:07] holy
[23:08] Oh some power needed many signs and
[23:09] wonders but then at the end of his
[23:11] ministry he was to be offered as God's
[23:13] lamb and Jesus in Jerusalem was wounded
[23:17] for our transgressions bruised for our
[23:19] iniquities everybody left him everybody
[23:22] forsook him the Bible said but on him
[23:26] God laid the iniquity of us all and then
[23:29] he died for our sins and rose for our
[23:31] justification and now with His stripes
[23:34] we are healed and he might have said you
[23:36] know 40-day or I'm sorry yeah fifty days
[23:39] after Jesus raised from the dead the
[23:41] Holy Ghost came and now the power that
[23:44] was on Jesus is here for us that's why
[23:47] when we pray for the sick they recovered
[23:49] amen when we cast out evil spirits
[23:51] that's why they leave amen it's because
[23:54] the power that was on Jesus is on us
[23:56] today hallelujah and so the eunuch
[24:01] didn't know this so Philip preached to
[24:04] him Jesus out of this one scripture he
[24:07] might said you know eunuch you know
[24:09] Jesus died for all your sins he is the
[24:11] god of the Old Testament but this is his
[24:13] manifestation in our day he's the Living
[24:15] Word today he came and died and your
[24:18] sins unit can be forgiven if you believe
[24:20] in Jesus Christ as the Messiah
[24:22] look at verse 36 and as they went on
[24:26] their way they came into a certain water
[24:29] and the eunuch said see here is water
[24:31] what does hinder me to be baptized so is
[24:34] there anything that's keeping me from
[24:35] being baptized Philip remember all she
[24:39] had done and this is still the same day
[24:42] so in one day he didn't know Isaiah 53
[24:46] month was the Messiah but God sent
[24:49] Philip out there one man to preach to
[24:51] him Christ that Christ is the Messiah of
[24:54] Isaiah 53 he looks at the water so does
[24:56] anything hinder me from being baptized
[24:58] and what does Philip say and Philip said
[25:01] if thou believest with all thine heart
[25:03] thou mast so hey for Haven and for
[25:07] everybody else that's all you need to be
[25:09] baptized you need to recognize Jesus
[25:11] Christ as the Messiah who died for your
[25:13] sins he raised for justification and if
[25:15] you do believe he's God's lamb with all
[25:17] your heart you may be baptized amen
[25:21] and the Bible said and he answered and
[25:23] said I believe that Jesus Christ is the
[25:25] son of God so that's always the first
[25:26] question I ask people when I baptized
[25:28] them do you believe Jesus Christ is the
[25:30] son of the Living God if they say yes
[25:32] then you just met the same requirements
[25:34] as the eunuch a memorable Gramps had
[25:37] God's not a respecter of persons if God
[25:38] honored the eunuchs faith because he
[25:41] believed Jesus Christ is the son of God
[25:42] he's got to honor havens fate today amen
[25:44] he's got to honor our faith if we come
[25:47] by the same faith under the same
[25:50] conditions verse 38 he commanded the
[25:53] chariot to stand still and they went
[25:55] down both into the water both Philip and
[25:59] the eunuch and he baptized them notice
[26:02] into the water not sprinkling but
[26:04] actually went into the water and when
[26:07] they were come up out of the water the
[26:09] Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip
[26:11] and the eunuch saw him no more and he
[26:13] went on his way rejoicing so we expect
[26:16] Haman to feel rejoicing after today
[26:19] right because after after the eunuch was
[26:22] baptized he was rejoicing God is real
[26:25] God is with us god is my Savior God
[26:28] Jesus Christ is the Messiah
[26:29] amen that's what we expect by the grace
[26:32] of the Lord so does that make sense
[26:35] Haven is that God placed all of your sin
[26:38] on Jesus even before we were born the
[26:41] Bible said God loved us while we were
[26:43] yet sinners he died for us before we
[26:46] even loved him so that's what this day
[26:51] is all about this day is all about
[26:52] recognizing that Haven doesn't have to
[26:55] die anymore for her sins you don't have
[26:57] to pay for any of your sins because
[26:58] Jesus already paid for them I don't have
[27:01] to pay for my sins because Jesus already
[27:03] paid the price for them he was wounded
[27:05] for my sins
[27:07] he was chastened because so I could have
[27:09] peace and that's the same thing for you
[27:12] that's a beautiful story praise God he
[27:16] was hurt so I don't have to be praise
[27:18] the Lord and then he went to hell so I
[27:20] don't have to go to hell I can go to
[27:22] heaven because he made the way for me
[27:25] and if I'm buried with him if I'm
[27:28] planted with him I'll raise like him
[27:30] that's another promise we already read
[27:32] that from Romans chapter 6 so when
[27:34] you're planted today it's
[27:35] promise every seat that's planned to
[27:37] ever see that God plants will raise up
[27:39] and God will plant you in the faith and
[27:42] you'll raise one day by God's grace okay
[27:46] so I was gonna show a few of these four
[27:51] I wanted to Haven to see a few of these
[27:55] so Haven there's five baptisms I'm sorry
[28:00] yeah five baptisms in the book of Acts
[28:02] let's just read over those and then
[28:03] we'll be done we'll just we'll just
[28:04] close with that and in each case Haven
[28:07] they either say Jesus Christ i baptize
[28:09] you name of Jesus Christ or they say
[28:11] Lord Jesus
[28:12] i baptize you name of Lord Jesus or they
[28:13] say i baptize you name of the Lord or
[28:16] they say I baptized Lord Jesus or Lord
[28:18] and if you put all those together it's
[28:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[28:24] that's what God does God hides it and
[28:25] God put incomplete things in here to
[28:28] hide his truth from the eyes of the wise
[28:30] and prudent but he reveals it unto babes
[28:32] and that's what you have to do by the
[28:35] scripture because jesus said go ye
[28:37] therefore and baptize them in the name
[28:38] of the Father Son and Holy Ghost so the
[28:40] name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is the
[28:43] Lord Jesus Christ that is the name of
[28:44] the Father Son Holy Ghost because all of
[28:47] God came and dwelt in one man named the
[28:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[28:51] okay so Malachi let's switch over now
[28:55] let's go through these and then we'll be
[28:57] done then we'll have a word of Prayer
[28:58] over Haven and then we'll head off to
[29:00] the waters of baptism by the grace of
[29:02] the Lord you know I had I have it I just
[29:10] sermon ready to preach I was gonna
[29:11] preach on the Sardis church age park - I
[29:12] had that already go yesterday I've
[29:14] prepared two sermons and I was already
[29:15] go but seen we have a smaller group and
[29:18] you know just seem like we should just
[29:20] maybe minister to Haven here a little
[29:21] bit by God's grace hope that's okay
[29:23] the grace Lord but I was all ready to
[29:25] preach you know the the announcement and
[29:28] all that Jesus did there at the Sardis
[29:30] Church age I was all ready to do that
[29:31] but maybe Wednesday we'll see okay so
[29:36] let's go to Matthew 28 verse 19 we'll
[29:42] just go right in order right through the
[29:44] Scriptures so Haven could see that you
[29:45] have a Bible there in case you okay
[29:47] super thank you honey
[30:04] okay let's go up to verse eighteen
[30:06] twenty eight eighteen and Jesus came and
[30:11] spake of them saying all power is given
[30:13] to me in heaven and earth go ye
[30:15] therefore and teach all nations
[30:16] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[30:18] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
[30:21] let's stop right there is America one of
[30:23] the nations yeah so weird America we're
[30:28] missionaries in America how many
[30:29] understand that we're missionaries we're
[30:31] supposed to invite the Lost to come to
[30:33] our church and hear the Word of God
[30:35] so that's what we're doing we're
[30:36] teaching this nation here in Accra we're
[30:39] doing our little part in Akron we're
[30:41] teaching all nations verse nineteen oh
[30:44] yeah I already read verse nineteen okay
[30:46] verse twenty teaching them to observe
[30:48] all things whatsoever I commanded you so
[30:51] that's what happens after havens
[30:53] baptized and after we're all baptized
[30:55] then we need to learn to observe or obey
[30:57] all things commanded by Jesus in the
[31:00] Bible and lo I am with You alway even
[31:03] unto the end of the world amen so Haven
[31:07] has that promise and will have that
[31:08] promise that Christ is with us until the
[31:11] end all right
[31:13] acts 2:38 let's go there so ten days
[31:19] later ten days after Jesus said this
[31:29] Peter gets filled with the Holy Ghost
[31:31] and 120 get filled the Holy Ghost in
[31:36] acts 2:38 then Peter preaches this then
[31:39] Peter said unto them repent and be
[31:40] baptized every one of you in the name of
[31:41] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[31:43] so Haven remission means sending away so
[31:47] Jesus has sent away your sins you don't
[31:51] have to you don't have to think about
[31:52] them anymore he sent them away that's
[31:54] what remit means to send away and ye
[31:57] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[31:59] and the gift of the Holy Ghost Haven is
[32:02] power
[32:03] for you to serve God right it's power
[32:05] for service because jesus said when the
[32:07] Holy Ghost comes you'll be a new with
[32:09] power amen
[32:11] so the Holy Ghost will give you power to
[32:14] serve the Lord amen
[32:16] okay let's go to acts 816 we just kind
[32:20] of read that I'm sorry no we didn't read
[32:22] this one yet but we will read this X 8
[32:25] 16 here's where Philip baptizes in the
[32:30] name of the Lord Jesus
[32:33] so Peter baptized in Jesus Christ's name
[32:35] and now Philip baptized in the name of
[32:38] the Lord Jesus all right okay so could
[32:42] you read that for us verse 16 could you
[32:43] read eight sixteen for us so the Haven
[32:45] could hear amen thank you acacia so
[33:01] Seahaven they're baptized in the name of
[33:03] the Lord Jesus and then you want the
[33:06] Holy Spirit to fall on you and that
[33:08] means he'll give you a blessing we'll
[33:10] give you a a worship and anointing
[33:13] something some power to love him more
[33:15] so yeah that's wonderful the Lord Jesus
[33:18] when we baptized and even Lord Jesus now
[33:21] we just saw the eunuch being baptized go
[33:24] to acts 1048 acts 1048
[33:35] [Music]
[33:40] now you remember this story this is on
[33:44] this is the Centurion yeah I forget his
[33:49] name now Cornelius yeah this is on the
[33:52] top of Cornelius house the holy ghost
[33:54] Falls while Peter preaches the word and
[33:56] they received the Holy Ghost but they
[33:57] haven't been baptized yet
[33:59] so the Bible said and he commanded them
[34:02] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[34:04] then prayed they him to tarry certain
[34:07] days so here's another baptism and I
[34:10] want you to let's maokai jump up to
[34:11] verse 46 here's a time where the Holy
[34:15] Ghost falls in verse 46 for they heard
[34:18] them speak with tongues and magnify God
[34:20] so Haven that's what we want to happen
[34:23] to you and everybody who's been baptized
[34:24] we want you to be so filled with God's
[34:27] love that you'll speak words you've
[34:29] never spoken before and you'll glorify
[34:31] God in a way you've never glorified him
[34:33] before that means it's a time of
[34:36] personal worship a time where you're
[34:39] free to worship the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:41] amen
[34:43] okay let's go to acts 19:5 two more
[34:45] scriptures then we'll be done here acts
[34:47] 19:5 we'll read five and six acts 19:5
[35:00] and six Lydia can you read out that
[35:01] aloud sohaving can hear you
[35:13] amen so as soon as they're baptized Paul
[35:16] lays hands on them the Holy Ghost falls
[35:18] on them and they just start worshipping
[35:20] God through prophesying through speaking
[35:23] in tongues but remember there's other
[35:25] times in the Bible when they receive the
[35:26] Holy Ghost they just had boldness to
[35:27] talk about Jesus so that's what Helen
[35:31] Helen I told her we need to sit down new
[35:32] Bible study
[35:33] she was always taught that tongues were
[35:35] the evidence so I need I told her now
[35:36] they're actually not the evidence and so
[35:40] I need to sit down with her I need to
[35:41] make an appointment maybe Saturday to
[35:42] talk with her and show her that through
[35:44] the scripture but one thing's for sure
[35:46] when the Holy Ghost falls on you you'll
[35:48] either worship magnify God speak in
[35:51] tongues glorify God prophesy magnify God
[35:54] or do something you'll have some
[35:56] personal worship experience that's the
[35:59] experience of power power is coming on
[36:01] you to worship God amen
[36:03] all right and last one acts 22:16 here's
[36:11] Paul's baptism
[36:26] alright now notice when once we believe
[36:29] in Jesus Christ as the Messiah we
[36:31] shouldn't we shouldn't put off our
[36:33] baptism but we should be baptized
[36:35] quickly look at verse 16 and now why
[36:39] tarriest thou why are you waiting Paul
[36:41] this is what Ananias is saying why are
[36:43] you waiting Paul
[36:44] don't wait arise and be baptized and
[36:47] wash away thy sins calling upon the name
[36:51] of the Lord and mommy remember when
[36:54] mommy explained it to you Haven before
[36:56] you get baptized your heart is like
[36:58] really dirty right it's got 13 s of sin
[37:00] the Bible also calls it a stony heart
[37:02] your hearts like a stone but once you
[37:05] repent and accept Jesus as your Lord and
[37:08] Savior your dirty heart gets washed over
[37:11] and becomes white as snow or your stony
[37:14] heart turns into a really soft fleshly
[37:17] heart so instead of stone and soft like
[37:19] your skin your heart becomes really soft
[37:21] like that your spiritual heart because
[37:24] the Bible said see you wash away your
[37:26] sin so you can take that picture of a
[37:28] dirty heart like dirty laundry but then
[37:31] God takes this Holy Spirit and he washes
[37:33] all your sins away and now you're clean
[37:36] in Jesus name
[37:38] praise God was that helpful havens that
[37:41] helpful okay
[37:42] praise the Lord any questions Haven you
[37:46] have any questions or anyone else have
[37:47] any questions no okay wonderful let's
[37:51] we'll have a word of prayer and then
[37:52] I'll do is I think my wife and I just
[37:54] want to talk to Haven and you know say
[37:56] the sinner's prayer with her and she can
[37:58] officially invite the Lord into her
[38:00] heart here and then we'll get changed
[38:02] and then we'll head over to Portage
[38:06] Lakes now remember Portage Lakes we just
[38:08] go out let's see we go out this way take
[38:11] a right or left here take a right on
[38:12] Turkey foot road and take that for a
[38:14] while until ninety think it's 93 if I'm
[38:18] not mistaken so last time I was going
[38:20] the wrong way in the lab when we
[38:21] baptized acacia and Lydia I think we're
[38:24] driving all around I took the wrong road
[38:26] but I know the right road this time I
[38:28] haven't forgotten but let's just stand
[38:31] while we stand here we'll have a word of
[38:33] Prayer
[38:36] that's all let's all pray for Haven and
[38:38] the God will bless her and let's also
[38:41] pray for other souls in our families and
