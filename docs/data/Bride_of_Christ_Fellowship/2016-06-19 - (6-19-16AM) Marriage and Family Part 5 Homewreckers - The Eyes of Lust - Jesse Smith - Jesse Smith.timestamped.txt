[1:09:04] confirmation I'm preaching the right
[1:09:06] thing he said he said I can't go out
[1:09:08] there and evangelize and teach this
[1:09:10] scripture by scripture like that he said
[1:09:12] the churches can't receive it this has
[1:09:13] to be through a pastor Ministry so thank
[1:09:16] God for that so we're really encouraged
[1:09:18] by the word of the Lord so let's go to
[1:09:20] uh 2 Samuel 112 and3 I got a inter tit
[1:09:24] or subtopic here I like to call my
[1:09:27] subtopic I know it's a little uh uh
[1:09:30] intense but I like to call it home recer
[1:09:33] the eyes of lust so we're look at eyes
[1:09:35] of lust this morning by God's grace uh 2
[1:09:41] Samuel 112
[1:09:43] and3 how many you happy to be in the
[1:09:45] house of the Lord this morning praise
[1:09:48] God we're just so grateful to be back
[1:09:49] with you we surely enjoyed our vacation
[1:09:51] and um just enjoyed the time away
[1:09:54] together as a family really needed that
[1:09:56] had some wonderful times together
[1:09:58] learned a lot about the American
[1:09:59] Revolution so you're probably hearing
[1:10:00] some sermons on the American Revolution
[1:10:02] pretty soon it's a perfect type of the
[1:10:04] Revolution we're in right now the
[1:10:06] spiritual Revolution the brides Revival
[1:10:08] how many part of that by God's grace
[1:10:11] it's a perfect type of that and so we'll
[1:10:13] be preaching on that Lord willing and
[1:10:15] thank God for his mercy and his love you
[1:10:17] know one thing that really impacted me
[1:10:18] was that before they started uh the
[1:10:21] American Revolution before they signed
[1:10:22] the Declaration Independence they had a
[1:10:24] day of praying and fasting and it was to
[1:10:27] actually avert War uh to stay away from
[1:10:31] war because they just got out of
[1:10:32] numerous battles and things like that uh
[1:10:34] in in the day they just the ministers
[1:10:36] called them to pray and fast and then it
[1:10:38] wasn't long after that uh you know that
[1:10:40] war started and so see sometimes you
[1:10:42] know we pray and fast for things and it
[1:10:44] seems like God doesn't answer but church
[1:10:46] he answers every time and if you just
[1:10:48] set your side set yourself aside and
[1:10:50] pray and fast and wait on the Lord he'll
[1:10:52] bring you through it you might not want
[1:10:54] to go to war but he'll bring you through
[1:10:55] it by God's grace and he'll make you
[1:10:57] Victorious on the other end only God
[1:10:59] could do such great things as that
[1:11:00] praise God 2 Samuel 11 2 and 3 you're
[1:11:04] there say
[1:11:06] amen and it came to pass in an evening
[1:11:08] tide that David arose from off his bed
[1:11:11] and walked upon the roof of the King's
[1:11:13] house and from the roof he saw a woman
[1:11:15] washing herself and the woman was very
[1:11:17] beautiful to look upon and David sent
[1:11:19] and inquired after the woman and one
[1:11:21] said is this I'm sorry is not this Shea
[1:11:24] the daughter of Elam the wife of UAH the
[1:11:28] hittite look how David Gets reminders he
[1:11:30] said don't you know this is a daughter
[1:11:32] and this is a
[1:11:34] wife she's more than just a object you
[1:11:37] look at she's a daughter and a wife yeah
[1:11:40] amen she's the daughter of the king amen
[1:11:44] and all you sisters today you're
[1:11:46] Daughters of the king and brothers
[1:11:48] You're sons of the king so we got to
[1:11:50] treat each other like we're Sons and
[1:11:52] Daughters of the king
[1:11:54] Glory job 311 this is familiar scripture
[1:11:58] but in case you haven't read it in a
[1:11:59] while job was a man that God said he's a
[1:12:01] perfect man brother brah tells us he was
[1:12:04] perfect through the sacrifice of the
[1:12:06] blood of bulls and goats so that was
[1:12:10] that was his Perfection of that day job
[1:12:11] was not a sinless man but he was perfect
[1:12:14] because he kept offering the sacrifice
[1:12:16] of praise and even in job's day he had
[1:12:19] troubles with lust he had trouble with
[1:12:21] his eyes so he had to make a covenant he
[1:12:23] had to make a promise to God and say God
[1:12:25] I will keep my eyes from Evil things and
[1:12:28] this is applicable for all men and women
[1:12:31] this morning can every say
[1:12:33] Amen I'm going to give a testimony from
[1:12:35] our recent meetings in Minnesota where
[1:12:38] women were confessing their lust and
[1:12:40] their eye trouble so it's not just for
[1:12:43] men it's for women as well job 311 now
[1:12:47] of course it battles men more often but
[1:12:49] in our day and age with the visual age
[1:12:51] we have it's on women and them
[1:12:54] I made a covenant that means a promise a
[1:12:57] testament a vow I made a covenant with
[1:13:00] my eyes why then should I think upon a
[1:13:04] maid so see the eyes are first open and
[1:13:07] if they're open looking at the wrong
[1:13:09] thing that picture becomes a
[1:13:11] thought brother Ram said the eye is the
[1:13:14] gate to the soul but before it passes
[1:13:16] down to the soul it's got to pass
[1:13:17] through the human
[1:13:19] Spirit how many let's bow our heads how
[1:13:21] many would say Lord speak to me today
[1:13:23] help me today I have needs upon my heart
[1:13:25] God bless those hands my hands are up

[1:14:34] bit at them and he said Daddy you're
[1:14:35] preaching and I said well you can take
[1:14:37] the preacher out of the pulpit but you
[1:14:39] can't take the pulpit out of the

[1:14:47] of God so we're thankful for God's mercy
[1:14:49] and his love amen uh just keep uh uh
[1:14:54] this service in prayer there's some
[1:14:56] people that said they were coming
[1:14:57] they're not here yet and last night
[1:14:59] we're at this altar I was crying and
[1:15:00] praying with individual to uh get right
[1:15:03] with the Lord I think it was at midnight
[1:15:05] last night we
[1:15:06] were pleading with God at the altar here
[1:15:09] last night so I'm a little tired but uh
[1:15:11] thankful for God's mercy and his love if
[1:15:13] you just can say a little prayer in your
[1:15:14] heart for that ask God to guide the
[1:15:16] individuals to worship here if it's his
[1:15:19] will I believe it is so let's look at
[1:15:22] this thought uh my sub topic this is
[1:15:24] part five of marriage into family my
[1:15:26] subtopic is home recer the eyes of
[1:15:30] lust uh the term home wer has become
[1:15:33] more popular you know since uh social
[1:15:36] media and things like that uh and talk
[1:15:38] shows you know when I was younger God
[1:15:41] forgive me but I would watch you know
[1:15:42] some bad talk shows and that's when
[1:15:44] things got really bad on TV you know
[1:15:45] they started fighting and uh cussing and
[1:15:48] all these things like that but they
[1:15:49] would call you know they would have Mory
[1:15:51] pich was one of them I can't remember
[1:15:53] their names you know sad to say but I
[1:15:56] wasn't raising the message I didn't know
[1:15:57] that was I knew it was wrong but I
[1:15:59] didn't have preaching and teaching on it
[1:16:01] but you know what I'm trying to say um
[1:16:04] but they would have special shows where
[1:16:05] they would have home
[1:16:07] records and they would bring out a
[1:16:09] person who supposedly wrecked a home and
[1:16:11] then they would have the other person
[1:16:13] you know they explain why they wrecked
[1:16:14] the home and then they would have the
[1:16:16] other person share their side and
[1:16:17] usually there be a fight and that's what
[1:16:18] Skyrocket the radio somebody remember
[1:16:20] that anybody remember that it's a shame
[1:16:22] that was in the
[1:16:23] as I was growing up but I thought my
[1:16:26] what a interesting word because we see
[1:16:29] that happening with David in the
[1:16:32] scripture David wrecked a beautiful
[1:16:36] home he was a man Anointed The Holy
[1:16:39] Ghost now of course when he did this sin
[1:16:40] the anointing left him because the Bible
[1:16:42] said when you sin you grieve the spirit
[1:16:44] of God that means to
[1:16:46] offend now listen you have three
[1:16:49] parts when you grieve the Holy Ghost if
[1:16:52] you're born again Christian that
[1:16:53] anointing never leaves your soul it
[1:16:55] leaves your human
[1:16:57] spirit because you have three parts now
[1:16:59] in the Old Testament the Holy Ghost
[1:17:00] couldn't come according to John 7
[1:17:03] 38-39 the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[1:17:05] could not be given till Jesus was
[1:17:06] glorified brother said the same thing he
[1:17:08] repeated the same scripture so David had
[1:17:10] a seed in his soul but it was never
[1:17:12] quickened it was never sealed by the
[1:17:13] Holy Ghost and so when he looks out he'd
[1:17:16] already conquered look at this he
[1:17:17] conquered Goliath a natural giant but he
[1:17:19] couldn't conquer the Giant in his heart
[1:17:21] of lust
[1:17:23] praise the
[1:17:25] lord we think think about what God's
[1:17:28] brought us through and yet there's these
[1:17:29] little things that to the world it don't
[1:17:31] seem like big things but Satan if we
[1:17:33] don't give God the the the right way if
[1:17:35] we don't give God obedience things can
[1:17:37] conquer us that might not seem so great
[1:17:39] they might not seem like a Goliath but
[1:17:41] if we're not careful they could kill
[1:17:44] us and they could hinder our walk with
[1:17:47] the Lord how many with me so far so
[1:17:49] David had a soul it was a genuine seed
[1:17:51] of God but it was not quick because you
[1:17:53] only have one or the other uh and
[1:17:55] because it wasn't quickened uh it wasn't
[1:17:57] sealed by the Holy Ghost but his human
[1:17:59] Spirit would get anointed he would write
[1:18:00] songs he would play he would play on the
[1:18:02] harp and cast out demons off of Saul you
[1:18:04] know and slay Goliath and all prophesy
[1:18:07] about Jesus and and Psalm 22 and all
[1:18:10] these things but in this case it was
[1:18:12] just an ordinary evening the Bible
[1:18:14] doesn't say when the date was but the
[1:18:15] Bible said it was an evening time and
[1:18:17] it's just com another average day isn't
[1:18:20] that when Satan comes are just average
[1:18:21] days we're just trying to make it
[1:18:23] through the week just trying to make it
[1:18:24] through uh whatever more and here Satan
[1:18:26] comes and shows and allows this basa to
[1:18:30] get undressed and wash yourself in front
[1:18:33] of him and he did not have a spiritual
[1:18:35] guard up brother brand said he neglected
[1:18:36] his duties King should have been out in
[1:18:38] war the Bible tells us that we know that
[1:18:40] so first thing he neglected his
[1:18:42] responsibility wasn't fighting where he
[1:18:45] ought to do that's when we fall we're
[1:18:47] not fighting like we ought to amen we
[1:18:49] think we get in the picnic mode instead
[1:18:51] of the war mode right War mode is down
[1:18:54] on your knees battling principalities
[1:18:56] and powers and dominions can you say
[1:18:58] Amen to that but picnic mode is all just
[1:19:01] okay everything's fine don't have to
[1:19:02] pray up don't have to focus on the word
[1:19:04] don't have to plant the word in my heart
[1:19:05] don't have to memorize the Bible don't
[1:19:07] have to worry about all these things
[1:19:08] don't have to keep listening to tapes
[1:19:09] and you get in picnic mode which is
[1:19:11] neglecting the responsibilities God's
[1:19:14] given to us brother manam said it
[1:19:15] shouldn't take uh a desperation to get
[1:19:18] us to draw near to God but he said as
[1:19:20] humans that's what we need many times oh
[1:19:23] and so David here he gets relaxed he
[1:19:25] gets neglectful and he looks upon basba
[1:19:28] we know the story I preach on this about
[1:19:29] two months ago a little more in depth
[1:19:31] scripture by scripture but I'm just
[1:19:33] hitting the Highlight uh and remember
[1:19:35] before this Uriah had a beautiful home
[1:19:38] in 1 Chronicles 11 the Bible said Uriah
[1:19:40] was a valiant man he was one of David's
[1:19:42] Mighty Men right after David Rose up and
[1:19:45] got anointed and slave Goliath he was
[1:19:46] one that was prited and brought into the
[1:19:49] the fold there he was one of David's
[1:19:51] Mighty Men and he had a beautiful home
[1:19:52] he had a wife in subjection he had braba
[1:19:55] there and he he had a wonderful Godly
[1:19:57] home we would say he was walking in step
[1:19:59] with the
[1:20:00] word but because of one man's failure uh
[1:20:04] to to conquer his own lust his Goliath
[1:20:07] of lust I'll say it like that and we're
[1:20:09] g to get to porn in just a moment but my
[1:20:11] word for porn I don't want to use that
[1:20:12] word too much uh because it comes from
[1:20:14] the Greek word though although pornea
[1:20:16] which is a fornication uh but that word
[1:20:18] I'm going to use the word lust instead
[1:20:20] just because of the children and to be
[1:20:21] respectful them so hopefully they don't
[1:20:23] ask too many questions but if they do
[1:20:24] you can give them a Godly answer just
[1:20:26] ask the Holy Spirit to give you the
[1:20:27] right uh
[1:20:28] terminology there's always a gentler way
[1:20:30] to say things and you have to come out
[1:20:32] and say things maybe uh so plain uh to
[1:20:35] children so God will give us wisdom to
[1:20:37] do that and so Uriah had a beautiful
[1:20:40] home so what wrecked his home now look
[1:20:43] his his home was so consecrated to God
[1:20:45] that when David brought him back he was
[1:20:47] so focused on the the the leadership of
[1:20:50] the Holy Spirit the leadership of the
[1:20:51] Holy Spirit was your it's war time time
[1:20:53] you're to battle it's not fleshly
[1:20:55] Pleasures time it's war time and he was
[1:20:58] so devoted even when David got him drunk
[1:21:01] he would take him down to the house and
[1:21:02] go lay with your wife and he was so
[1:21:04] devoted even inside despite being drunk
[1:21:06] and all these things he was his mind was
[1:21:08] so made up on it's not time for fleshly
[1:21:11] lust it's time for Spiritual battle amen
[1:21:14] and if we can get that Focus today we'll
[1:21:17] be more than conquerors in Christ Jesus
[1:21:19] we'll conquer more enemies will overcome
[1:21:21] we'll be true over comers in this hour
[1:21:23] and if we overcome in this hour we sit
[1:21:25] on the throne with Christ amen
[1:21:29] glory but he had such so if see if if
[1:21:32] the leader of the home has everything in
[1:21:34] order everything else goes everything
[1:21:35] else Falls in order praise God sat you
[1:21:38] try to attack different places brother
[1:21:40] man said he tries to attack the wife
[1:21:41] more than anything so the husband's
[1:21:42] really got to pray for his wife we went
[1:21:44] through that we preached on that
[1:21:45] recently he must do that but if his
[1:21:48] focus is on right on Christ uh then it's
[1:21:52] a Happ Happ home it's a Victorious home
[1:21:54] by the grace of God brother BR makes a
[1:21:56] statement there in that first uh
[1:21:58] Ephesians parallels Joshua he said we
[1:22:00] find many people are displeased with
[1:22:02] Christianity he said they get frustrated
[1:22:04] with Christianity because their Center
[1:22:06] is not directly centered on the cross
[1:22:09] when people get dissatisfied and get
[1:22:11] that they just don't enjoy Christianity
[1:22:12] as much anymore it's a burden to them
[1:22:14] instead of a joy he say because they're
[1:22:16] not focus directly on the cross of Jesus
[1:22:18] Christ Church let our eyes remain upon
[1:22:21] the cross someone died for me because
[1:22:24] I'm Unholy Glory someone had to pay the
[1:22:27] price for my sins because I'm a sinner
[1:22:29] and I need to be saved by grace keep
[1:22:32] your eyes on that someone had to die for
[1:22:34] me I'm not worthy there's nothing good
[1:22:36] about me I must trust in the forgiveness
[1:22:38] and the grace and the blood of Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ amen glory but he said said it'll
[1:22:44] be such a discouragement to people if
[1:22:45] they're not directly focus on Calvary
[1:22:48] Christianity becomes a burden rather
[1:22:50] than a joy so we must be focused is
[1:22:52] completely on Jesus
[1:22:55] Christ now brother Brandon said this he
[1:22:58] said uh this is uh I can't remember the
[1:23:00] message oh yeah this is the message of
[1:23:01] Grace 1961 brother B said he wants to
[1:23:04] walk up to UAH in heaven and say brother
[1:23:07] UAH your testimony meant something to me
[1:23:10] on Earth praise God you imagine a
[1:23:13] prophet walking up now what was it about
[1:23:16] Uriah he was a man who sold out all his
[1:23:19] Heathen ideas to follow the message of
[1:23:22] the hour and the messenger of the hour
[1:23:25] and he was so devoted he wouldn't give
[1:23:27] over to a life of pleasure even his his
[1:23:30] his legal Pleasures with his wife he was
[1:23:32] so focused on the battle so focused on
[1:23:34] the war that he turned down physical
[1:23:36] Pleasures in order to fight and stay
[1:23:39] focused on the goal at hand that's a
[1:23:41] real man Glory a man that won't be no
[1:23:45] matter what what others try to influence
[1:23:47] him or get him drunk or whatever more or
[1:23:50] try to get him distracted a man will say
[1:23:52] f focus on the goal the prize that's a
[1:23:55] real man yiah was a real man church
[1:23:58] amen his devotion in the time of war was
[1:24:01] extremely loyal he was fully focused and
[1:24:03] sold out to war and would not partake of
[1:24:06] temporal physical Pleasures even though
[1:24:08] they were legal now most of us when our
[1:24:10] physical Pleasures they're not legal
[1:24:11] they're illegal praise God when we fall
[1:24:14] short of the glory of God they're
[1:24:16] illegal things they're sinful things
[1:24:18] sometimes we watch the wrong thing we
[1:24:21] look at the wrong thing we start
[1:24:22] thinking the wrong thing and that's
[1:24:24] where we get illegal troubles right but
[1:24:27] his would have been a legal pleasure but
[1:24:30] for that time and season he turned it
[1:24:31] down because he was so devoted what a
[1:24:33] man what a mighty man he was no wonder
[1:24:35] the Bible called him valant Hallelujah
[1:24:38] so let me say
[1:24:39] this let's read uh second Samuel let's
[1:24:42] go back to 2 Samuel
[1:24:44] 11:25 I brought this out well let me see
[1:24:47] the Holy Spirit brought it out I'm not I
[1:24:48] can't bring out nothing uh 2 Samuel
[1:24:51] 11:25 let's bring this out again this
[1:24:54] was really striking to me I think it
[1:24:55] came to me as I was ministering uh the
[1:24:58] the continual revelation of the Holy
[1:25:00] Ghost now before we read this remember
[1:25:02] David was a Man Who Loved God and he
[1:25:04] loved people he cried when his son
[1:25:06] absolon was killed he cried and wept
[1:25:08] they mourned for I think what a day or
[1:25:10] two maybe more when Saul died David
[1:25:13] mourned and wept over Saul a man that
[1:25:16] hated him how many remember that in
[1:25:19] scripture okay so now in our story
[1:25:21] you're right has died David ordered it
[1:25:24] he knows it the message comes back to
[1:25:26] David and here's what David says about
[1:25:28] the news of
[1:25:31] Uriah and his death here's what he says
[1:25:34] remember he cried he cried for his
[1:25:36] enemies he's cried for his son to try to
[1:25:37] take the Kingdom from him but when it
[1:25:39] comes to a loyal servant a follower of
[1:25:42] the message of the hour a mighty man he
[1:25:44] hardly even cares that Uriah
[1:25:46] died what was the difference well we're
[1:25:48] going to talk about it then David said
[1:25:50] unto the messenger thus shalt thou say
[1:25:52] unto joab let not this thing displease
[1:25:56] thee for the sword devoureth one as well
[1:25:59] as another make thy battle strong
[1:26:01] against the city and overthrow it and
[1:26:03] encourage thou him so he tells him es
[1:26:05] just tell joab don't be discouraged we
[1:26:06] lost you right just move on everybody
[1:26:08] dies and all these things like that
[1:26:09] there's no crying for him there's no
[1:26:12] mourning for him it's just oh somebody
[1:26:14] died okay move on where was David's
[1:26:16] affections where was David's love for
[1:26:19] his Brethren he cried over Saul he cried
[1:26:21] over absin he doesn't even cry over UAH
[1:26:24] you know why because when people are
[1:26:26] possessed by lust they lose their desire
[1:26:29] and care for other people because it's
[1:26:32] full selfishness it's full pride pride
[1:26:35] is my way is better than God's way and
[1:26:38] so David was all focused on himself as
[1:26:40] long as my sin is covered who cares
[1:26:42] about your right I don't care anymore he
[1:26:44] was walking by the wrong spirit so lust
[1:26:47] will keep will make you do things you
[1:26:48] never thought you would do amen amen
[1:26:53] lust will take you farther than you want
[1:26:54] to go he hardly acknowledges it but
[1:26:57] before he cry over his brother why
[1:26:59] because he was walking right with God
[1:27:01] and church when you and I make mistakes
[1:27:03] in sin and it's not repented yet we lose
[1:27:05] our affection as
[1:27:07] well
[1:27:09] Glory things don't touch us anymore
[1:27:11] yesterday a brother sent me a 13.8
[1:27:13] megabyte video of Christians being
[1:27:16] whipped in h Africa with sticks and then
[1:27:19] burned
[1:27:20] alive That Shook me up I got it it's
[1:27:24] I'll share with you one they just get
[1:27:26] burnt and so they're they're charcoal
[1:27:28] and it's right on the video someone's
[1:27:30] phone it's a five minute video within
[1:27:32] five minutes they're beaten and of
[1:27:33] course it fast forwards and things like
[1:27:35] that church we should have that should
[1:27:36] make us want to
[1:27:38] pray those are your brothers and sisters
[1:27:41] being persecuted and we're that's what
[1:27:43] their battle is like and what's our
[1:27:44] battle we battle little lust we're
[1:27:47] battling our
[1:27:48] smartphones we're battling tobacco or
[1:27:50] we're battling uh you know hatred or
[1:27:54] we're bound uh Gossip or something like
[1:27:56] that these people are battling life and
[1:27:58] death but see when we get our eyes off
[1:28:00] with a prize those things don't impact
[1:28:02] us anymore when we hear about well P
[1:28:04] Christians being persecuted we don't
[1:28:06] want to pray for them we don't care
[1:28:07] about them why because we're only
[1:28:08] centered on us selfishness I need what I
[1:28:11] want I want my lust satisfied God help
[1:28:13] us to crucify the lust and the
[1:28:15] affections thereof and then we'll live
[1:28:18] for others praise God amen amen in other
[1:28:21] words when you
[1:28:22] give over to lust you lose your desire
[1:28:25] to live for others David was no longer
[1:28:27] living for Uriah he was living for
[1:28:29] himself so he had UAH killed so see when
[1:28:32] you give over to lust you lose uh the
[1:28:35] influence of eternal life I didn't say
[1:28:37] you lose eternal life I said you lose
[1:28:39] the influence of eternal life Hallelujah
[1:28:43] other words the anointing of the Holy
[1:28:44] Ghost does that make sense
[1:28:47] everybody David could care less about
[1:28:49] Uriah why because a lust Spirit was
[1:28:51] anointing him see we think demon
[1:28:53] possession is just somebody foaming at
[1:28:54] the mouth or they got cancer or their
[1:28:56] handshaking or something awful like that
[1:28:59] that's that's a bodily demon possession
[1:29:01] no doubt about that sometimes mind but
[1:29:03] what about the temporary possessions in
[1:29:05] our minds and Spirits the Bible calls
[1:29:07] them
[1:29:09] strongholds in our minds we build up
[1:29:11] strongholds when we entertain lust
[1:29:14] spirits and all these things like that
[1:29:15] and things we should not be watching
[1:29:18] Satan gets a stronghold in our mind and
[1:29:20] somewhere it messes up those one of
[1:29:22] those five channels affection reason
[1:29:24] imagination uh different ones like that
[1:29:25] I can't remember last
[1:29:27] two and it builds up a stronghold in our
[1:29:30] mind and so we don't God's spirit can't
[1:29:32] flow through that channel anymore we
[1:29:33] lose our affections God help us to have
[1:29:35] the right affections now let's go to
[1:29:38] some scriptures you can see this in the
[1:29:39] scripture Hosea
[1:29:41] 4:18 Hosea 418 I know it's an extremely
[1:29:44] personal topic that's just kind of what
[1:29:46] God's called me to do I believe my
[1:29:47] Ministry is a Deliverance Ministry I
[1:29:49] believe that with all my heart God's
[1:29:50] kind of proven to me over over and over
[1:29:52] and over again uh and we'll maybe share
[1:29:54] a little bit more on that later the very
[1:29:57] first sermon I ever preached was called
[1:29:58] addictions uh be not a stumbling block
[1:30:01] in Aran Ohio few weeks later brother
[1:30:03] Brooks had me preach people were telling
[1:30:04] me right after the service I got
[1:30:05] delivered from video games I got
[1:30:06] delivered from smoking got delivered
[1:30:08] from this got delivered from that uh
[1:30:11] seem like every time the spirit anoints
[1:30:12] the church to pole and me to get in the
[1:30:14] right Channel people get delivered
[1:30:17] amen so I'm thankful for that by God's
[1:30:20] grace and the only way I could be that
[1:30:23] kind of type of ministry was because I
[1:30:25] had to be delivered
[1:30:26] myself praise God lord I many
[1:30:29] deliverances I had to go through I've
[1:30:31] had numerous people tell me you know
[1:30:32] I've been delivered from smoking after
[1:30:34] uh hearing your ministry and different
[1:30:36] things like that delivered from this
[1:30:38] delivered from that delivered from
[1:30:39] movies delivered from uh TV shows all
[1:30:42] these things Church what is it it's the
[1:30:44] grace of God like I was telling someone
[1:30:46] last night I said you know the reason
[1:30:47] you went through you know all these
[1:30:49] trials is because God wants to bring out
[1:30:50] a special kind of testimony like brother
[1:30:53] said a bell when you make a bell it has
[1:30:55] certain types of metals right certain
[1:30:58] mixture of this kind of metal that kind
[1:30:59] of metal and then become based upon the
[1:31:02] different mixtures you get a special
[1:31:03] ring to that Bell and they're not all
[1:31:05] the same right and so that's how it is
[1:31:08] we have to go through this hardship of
[1:31:09] maybe maybe child abuse or the hardship
[1:31:12] of poverty or maybe the hardship of
[1:31:14] addiction or maybe the hardship of of
[1:31:16] something like that and because of it go
[1:31:18] God was there the whole time God was
[1:31:21] allowing us to go through to shape Us in
[1:31:23] order to bring us out and at the latter
[1:31:25] end we'll have a testimony that can have
[1:31:27] the right kind of ring Glory if it
[1:31:30] doesn't ring on this Earth Church it
[1:31:31] will ring at the day of judgment because
[1:31:33] Jesus said that the Queen of Sheba will
[1:31:36] be raised up and her testimony will ring
[1:31:38] out against all that generation because
[1:31:40] she came to see Solomon and a greater
[1:31:42] than Solomon is here amen glory you feel
[1:31:46] like your testimony is not being ringed
[1:31:47] out enough here don't get sad don't get
[1:31:49] discouraged because if it doesn't ring
[1:31:51] here it'll ring out there amen it'll
[1:31:54] ring at that white Throne judgment how
[1:31:55] many love the Lord amen
[1:31:58] glory so you had to go through what you
[1:32:01] went through not because God was upset
[1:32:03] at you but because God loves you and he
[1:32:05] wants you to have a special ring to your
[1:32:07] testimony oh hallelujah amen if I wasn't
[1:32:10] so addicted to those things how could
[1:32:12] people ever get delivered from my
[1:32:13] Ministry I wouldn't know anything about
[1:32:15] it but because I was addicted and God
[1:32:17] gave me victory in areas like this then
[1:32:19] I see people getting the same Victory I
[1:32:21] can say thank you Jesus that the
[1:32:23] testimony of Christ in my life can be a
[1:32:25] blessing to somebody else
[1:32:28] amen I know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:32:31] that's why God's called me to Pastor
[1:32:32] preach Deliverance is part of that
[1:32:34] Ministry I believe with all my heart God
[1:32:37] just keeps proving it again and again I
[1:32:38] didn't ask for it I just but that's
[1:32:40] that's the ring I
[1:32:44] have and this week I've had people tell
[1:32:46] me uh by those videos we have on YouTube
[1:32:48] they told me I'm done cutting my hair go
[1:32:50] I watch your video and and God is sh me
[1:32:52] I'm not supposed to cut my hair anymore
[1:32:55] you think that's a little thing that's a
[1:32:56] big thing brother brandom said thus
[1:32:57] sayith the Lord I don't care if a woman
[1:32:59] dances in the spirit shout speaks in
[1:33:01] tongues if she cuts her hair she's dead
[1:33:03] thus sayith the Lord so if she stops
[1:33:06] cutting her hair she can get born again
[1:33:08] hopefully not
[1:33:11] guaranteed right why because if she cuts
[1:33:13] her hair she dishonors her husband that
[1:33:15] dishonors Christ and that dishonors God
[1:33:18] how can somebody be born again and
[1:33:20] dishonor the very God of Christ you
[1:33:22] can't be you've got to get Victory and
[1:33:24] so when when I get a testimony like that
[1:33:26] it's more than the world to me praise
[1:33:28] God because now this individual can have
[1:33:30] ability to be delivered praise God the
[1:33:32] ability to be born again how how many
[1:33:34] love the Lord amen yes
[1:33:40] Hallelujah Glory oh Hosea
[1:33:46] 48 they eat up the sin of my people and
[1:33:49] they set their heart on iniquity
[1:33:52] see it's what you set your heart
[1:33:55] on remember uh we preach on Galatians we
[1:33:57] preach through every verse of Galatians
[1:33:59] Bible said don't be God is Not mocked
[1:34:01] you can't mock God you can't plant evil
[1:34:03] sins and expect a holy ghost experiences
[1:34:06] afterwards you got to plant Holy Ghost
[1:34:08] seeds and you'll get Holy Ghost fruit
[1:34:10] praise God amen amen he said they set
[1:34:14] their affections on sin on iniquity and
[1:34:16] what do they get
[1:34:18] judgment you must set yourself on of
[1:34:21] Heavens let's leave Colossians 3
[1:34:24] beautiful scriptures that all tied
[1:34:26] together you must be set you must be so
[1:34:29] uh diligent like uh Uriah my goodness
[1:34:32] you must be so faithful you must be so
[1:34:35] uh programmed by the Holy Spirit I'm G
[1:34:37] to accept my affections I'm only gonna
[1:34:39] love what God
[1:34:41] loves
[1:34:44] amen I'm sorry I forgot to say Happy
[1:34:46] Father's Day to all the fathers I just
[1:34:48] saw forgive me uh Colossians I can't
[1:34:52] think of a better thing for fathers than
[1:34:53] to get victory over the lust of the eyes
[1:34:56] or mothers or or anybody by God's
[1:34:59] grace like I've said this before as
[1:35:01] we're turn there Colossians 3 I've said
[1:35:03] it before brother R said power without
[1:35:05] character is satanic and I apply that to
[1:35:07] the smartphone power or access to the
[1:35:10] internet or laptops or whatever you got
[1:35:13] that kind of power access without the
[1:35:15] character of a Christian is satanic in
[1:35:17] your life how many believe
[1:35:19] that yeah I met somebody from Meo email
[1:35:22] me and say that really touched me
[1:35:23] brother Jess I really need that to get
[1:35:24] Deliverance they were just streaming one
[1:35:26] day I said glory to
[1:35:28] God that kind of power without the
[1:35:31] character of Christ is satanic in your
[1:35:33] life I don't have a struggle with
[1:35:35] pornography I don't I don't struggle
[1:35:36] with the lust on my phone and movies and
[1:35:39] I don't struggle with that you know why
[1:35:40] because I've been
[1:35:41] delivered praise God I used to many
[1:35:45] moons ago many many moons
[1:35:47] ago but God has shown me and delivered
[1:35:50] me and he showed me how to live a
[1:35:52] Victorious Life above it amen so we get
[1:35:55] into that how do you overcome by the
[1:35:57] word how did Jesus overcome Satan's
[1:35:58] Temptation from Satan himself he just
[1:36:00] quoted the word and now he did more than
[1:36:03] that he stayed behind the word too amen
[1:36:05] see we'll quote the word and say well
[1:36:07] get behind me get behind me and then
[1:36:08] will partake of sin you got to quote the
[1:36:10] word and stay behind it and not go out
[1:36:12] after it amen glory Brother s the seals
[1:36:16] he said to sin Satan can't get into your
[1:36:18] soul you've got to leave the soul your
[1:36:20] your cons has to leave the soul stop
[1:36:23] deciding from the soul and go out to him
[1:36:25] to get sin but he can't get you in the
[1:36:28] soul because you're sealed by Christ
[1:36:30] until the day of your Redemption amen
[1:36:35] glory is that all right
[1:36:37] Brothers on Father's Day is that
[1:36:41] okay
[1:36:43] Glory Satan cannot touch you when you're
[1:36:45] walking by the soul that's a nature so
[1:36:47] it's a holy nature or we if we don't if
[1:36:50] we're not affected by that or influenced
[1:36:52] by that then we're just in our human
[1:36:54] Spirit that's where we're we're making
[1:36:55] decisions from we got to make decisions
[1:36:57] from the nature of
[1:37:01] Christ Colossians 3 1 if ye then be
[1:37:05] risen with Christ seek those things
[1:37:06] which are above where God sth on the
[1:37:08] right hand of God isn't that our daily
[1:37:11] battle right we're seeking so many
[1:37:13] things we got to seek the things that
[1:37:15] are above praise the Lord I heard this
[1:37:18] I'm going to repeat I heard it in
[1:37:19] Minnesota one of the brothers said he
[1:37:20] said how come I see he's a evangelist
[1:37:22] we're going to have him here uh Lord
[1:37:24] willing in August brother Dale Smith
[1:37:25] what a wonderful Ministry what a
[1:37:27] wonderful brother he made the statement
[1:37:29] he said my pastor Jason Watkins made
[1:37:31] this statement he said I see so many
[1:37:32] people in the message trying to get rich
[1:37:35] he said why would we try to get rich
[1:37:36] when Jesus said that's the thing that'll
[1:37:38] keep most people out of the kingdom of
[1:37:40] God I thought what a beautiful
[1:37:43] thought why are people trying to get
[1:37:45] rich when Jesus said that's your
[1:37:46] greatest trouble uh that will keep
[1:37:47] people out of the kingdom of God is
[1:37:49] riches how hardly a man can enter the
[1:37:51] the kingdom by
[1:37:53] riches it's like a camel trying to get
[1:37:55] through an eye of a needle praise the
[1:37:57] Lord it depends what you set your
[1:37:59] affections on set your affections on
[1:38:01] things above like heaven and Jesus and
[1:38:04] God and the Saints and glory and the
[1:38:06] sixth Dimension and divine love and all
[1:38:09] these things eternal life eternal youth
[1:38:11] all these things let us set our
[1:38:12] affections on things
[1:38:14] above verse two so set your affections
[1:38:18] on things above not on things on the
[1:38:20] Earth
[1:38:21] now affections is your emotions Your
[1:38:23] Love don't get fully attached
[1:38:25] emotionally to things on the earth so
[1:38:27] much get emotional to the things of God
[1:38:29] in heaven when was the last time you
[1:38:31] cried over the joy of going to
[1:38:33] heaven I'll give you a few seconds to
[1:38:35] think about
[1:38:36] that Glory when was the last time you
[1:38:39] cried for a soul I just did it last
[1:38:40] night at 12 midnight by God's grace
[1:38:43] right here at this altar right here now
[1:38:45] it doesn't happen every day but Church
[1:38:47] it ought to right because if brother man
[1:38:49] said you got the Holy Ghost you will
[1:38:50] sign and cry for the Abominations of the
[1:38:52] sins done in this city don't cry for
[1:38:54] people that don't have because your
[1:38:57] affections are set on that I don't care
[1:38:58] if you say it's hard for you to cry if
[1:39:00] you get t with the Holy Spirit it'll
[1:39:02] give you such a burden for them you
[1:39:04] can't help but cry it's exactly
[1:39:09] right so see set your affections on
[1:39:11] things above for ye are dead and your
[1:39:14] life is hid with Christ and God brother
[1:39:17] Bry said brother said this I heard on
[1:39:19] the adoption series he said go walk over
[1:39:21] kick a dead man or and say you hypocrite
[1:39:23] and see what he
[1:39:25] says he said a dead man won't get up and
[1:39:27] say
[1:39:29] nothing he said I'm afraid too many of
[1:39:31] us went down to be baptized and died and
[1:39:33] he said we weren't dead
[1:39:35] yet because when somebody calls you
[1:39:37] hypocrite or mistreat you you get up and
[1:39:39] say something about it but a dead man
[1:39:40] will lay there brother said in fact the
[1:39:42] dead man will actually get up and go
[1:39:44] praying about you to
[1:39:47] Jesus amen is that right Church yeah
[1:39:50] that's what he said listen to it if you
[1:39:52] want adoption series beautiful you're
[1:39:55] dead you're supposed to be dead your
[1:39:57] will your desires should be dead your
[1:40:00] emotion should be set on things above
[1:40:02] David's was not set on things above it
[1:40:04] was upon a little pretty girl that he
[1:40:07] was watching take a
[1:40:08] bath wasn't set on things
[1:40:11] above and when he fought Goliath it was
[1:40:13] set on things above I'm taking your head
[1:40:15] off today because you I come against you
[1:40:17] in the name of the Lord God of
[1:40:18] hosts amen God show me your head's
[1:40:21] coming off today God showed it to me in
[1:40:22] a vision right like brother R said
[1:40:24] hallelujah how many love the Lord amen
[1:40:27] yes so see you must set your affections
[1:40:29] on things above now let's start getting
[1:40:31] in a little bit here uh some deeper
[1:40:33] scriptures here so see when people get
[1:40:36] anointed by lust a stronghold of lust
[1:40:38] they no longer care about things they
[1:40:40] should care about their effects David
[1:40:41] didn't care about his friends anymore
[1:40:43] sometimes when people aren't contacting
[1:40:44] you now not every time but sometimes
[1:40:47] when your friends don't contact you
[1:40:48] don't email you back don't text you back
[1:40:50] don't call you you back after a while
[1:40:52] sometimes it's because they're
[1:40:52] struggling with lust and they don't care
[1:40:54] anymore but sometimes they're just plain
[1:40:56] busy praise the Lord I'm just saying
[1:40:58] that's one example someone might I've
[1:41:01] had that recently happen to me people
[1:41:02] won't call me back and text me back
[1:41:04] nobody in here because they're actually
[1:41:06] struggling with sin and they're avoiding
[1:41:10] me but like a pastor Shepherd I'm trying
[1:41:13] to go after those
[1:41:14] sheep come on back come on back here's
[1:41:17] some good sheep food I'm not sure grass
[1:41:19] I'm not sure what you have hey whatever
[1:41:21] more come on I'm trying to get them to
[1:41:23] come back but the reason they don't
[1:41:26] respond back the reason they don't have
[1:41:27] any affection toward me is because of
[1:41:30] sin they lost their natural affection
[1:41:32] that they should have a pastor that
[1:41:34] cares about me a pastor that will call
[1:41:36] me a pastor that will answer my
[1:41:38] questions a pastor that'll sit down and
[1:41:40] ask me how things are going that don't
[1:41:42] have any impact on them anymore all this
[1:41:44] about is me me me it should be about we
[1:41:48] we
[1:41:49] we amen church should be about us should
[1:41:53] be about the body of Christ because
[1:41:55] we're not going anywhere till that last
[1:41:56] member's called in glory should be about
[1:41:59] us the body of Christ eternal life
[1:42:01] living for
[1:42:02] others okay second Peter 28 this is a
[1:42:04] familiar scripture but extremely
[1:42:07] powerful second Peter
[1:42:09] 2:8 let's start getting into men and
[1:42:11] their struggles here uh because like I
[1:42:13] said I'm realizing it's not just men
[1:42:15] anymore it's women women might not lust
[1:42:17] after the same things men do but as I
[1:42:19] said from our recent meetings there
[1:42:20] Minnesota they do lust after certain
[1:42:22] things might not be the visuals men lust
[1:42:25] after but for women it might be the
[1:42:27] feelings of emotional romance or
[1:42:29] something like
[1:42:30] that might be some other type of a a
[1:42:33] feeling or some type of a lust or
[1:42:34] something along those lines so second
[1:42:37] Peter 2:8 now you're familiar with this
[1:42:39] lot was a foolish virgin how many
[1:42:41] believe that he wasn't the highest
[1:42:43] quality believer he was a penny Abraham
[1:42:46] was a silver
[1:42:47] dollar Glory how do you know because
[1:42:50] Abraham SA
[1:42:51] out of Sodom Abraham was not draw by the
[1:42:54] luxuries and Riches of Sodom he just
[1:42:56] said have your choice right and lot was
[1:42:59] okay with living around a bunch of
[1:43:01] homosexuals I'm sorry I'm
[1:43:04] not I'm not comfortable worshiping
[1:43:07] around them unless they repent now I
[1:43:10] have patience I have patience with a
[1:43:11] homosexual person I have patience with a
[1:43:13] murderer we have patience with the
[1:43:14] Molester have patience with any sinner
[1:43:16] murderer liar you can go to hell for
[1:43:18] lieing the Bible says you want to H the
[1:43:20] kingdom God just for lying and not
[1:43:22] repenting of
[1:43:24] it the Bible says we have so much grace
[1:43:27] upon them but when you go to correct
[1:43:29] them the Bible said in Galatians 6 Mar
[1:43:31] guard yourself that you're not tempted
[1:43:33] with the same thing they bow because
[1:43:35] demons like to jump on other people
[1:43:38] amen so lot just goes around them and
[1:43:42] he's hang he's living around homosexual
[1:43:45] homosexuality and he he he doesn't say
[1:43:47] too much about it because as soon as he
[1:43:50] says something about it they say we're
[1:43:51] going to knock your house down and we're
[1:43:52] going to tear you up lot so it shows the
[1:43:55] whole time lot wasn't he was just you
[1:43:57] know shaking hands and nice to meet
[1:43:59] you nice to have our financial gains
[1:44:01] here oh boy we're sure getting rich and
[1:44:03] all these things well you guys can just
[1:44:04] live however you want to live well the
[1:44:05] said his prayer meeting got smaller and
[1:44:07] smaller and smaller and smaller and then
[1:44:09] when he tried to get his sons-in-laws to
[1:44:11] believe it was destruction time they
[1:44:13] laughed and mocked at him brother B said
[1:44:14] that was because he didn't have a real
[1:44:16] Godly testimony of like Abraham
[1:44:19] believer that's right up I preach a
[1:44:21] whole group of sermons
[1:44:24] unlocked Abraham was a higher quality
[1:44:27] God said I can reveal my destruction to
[1:44:29] Abraham because I know he'll train his
[1:44:31] children to go in the ways of the Lord
[1:44:34] amen so second Peter 28 for that
[1:44:38] righteous man now look he's a righteous
[1:44:39] man he he
[1:44:41] saved that righteous man dwelling among
[1:44:44] them in seeing and in hearing Vex his
[1:44:47] righteous soul from day to day with
[1:44:48] their unlawful Deeds
[1:44:51] Vex means
[1:44:53] torment and the word devil means what
[1:44:57] Tormentor and we know
[1:44:59] that how did lot get tormented every day
[1:45:04] here's a man living amongst
[1:45:05] homosexuality the Bible tells us here he
[1:45:07] was tormented every day he couldn't get
[1:45:09] peace any day why because he was seeing
[1:45:13] and hearing all the sins in Sodom and
[1:45:16] Gomorrah every day he couldn't get away
[1:45:19] from it so that every day he tormented
[1:45:21] there's no peace why does this happen
[1:45:23] I'm a righteous man I hate this and he
[1:45:25] allowed himself rather than moving away
[1:45:27] and getting some peace he remained in it
[1:45:30] why was that he wasn't the same type of
[1:45:32] Christian as
[1:45:33] Abraham that
[1:45:35] right that look for us we might battle
[1:45:38] with that but see we can live above that
[1:45:40] we can leave that because Abraham and
[1:45:42] his father were over there by the Tower
[1:45:44] of Babel but they left it amen glory so
[1:45:49] if you're being tormented don't don't be
[1:45:50] discouraged don't make yourself Li make
[1:45:52] yourself Abraham with his daddy and move
[1:45:55] away from the Tower of Babel come out
[1:45:57] from among them and be separate sayth
[1:45:59] the Lord and I'll receive you as Sons
[1:46:01] amen glory that's what I when people
[1:46:04] preach about Judas I say in my mind I'm
[1:46:06] never Judas I'm never Judas now I say
[1:46:08] like this I'm never liot I'm never liot
[1:46:10] I always say I got the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:46:12] born again I know I'm delivered I'm not
[1:46:14] going back uh God has delivered me we
[1:46:16] always say the right thing you're a
[1:46:18] Creator create the atmosphere SP and
[1:46:21] watch it happen
[1:46:22] amen death and life are in the power of
[1:46:25] the tongue create life with your words
[1:46:27] amen and watch yourself overcome by the
[1:46:30] grace of God
[1:46:32] glory but lot oh honey I comeing what's
[1:46:35] wrong darl every day coming like this
[1:46:37] well I saw some homosexuals King down
[1:46:39] the street I saw this man rape this man
[1:46:41] all these things like that you better be
[1:46:42] careful the news stories you watching
[1:46:44] yes wonder why you're having trouble
[1:46:46] sleeping wonder why you're having
[1:46:47] trouble reading your Bible it's because
[1:46:49] of the thing you see and
[1:46:53] hear and the church
[1:46:57] said brother bam said this look what
[1:46:59] brother
[1:47:02] says this is blind Bas 1960 see and
[1:47:06] there's something about now he's talking
[1:47:07] about how Jesus contacted the woman at
[1:47:09] the the well remember how the Bible said
[1:47:12] Paul and Peter would go to people that
[1:47:14] needed healing and they say look on us
[1:47:16] remember that so see he had to contact
[1:47:18] their Spirit that's how you contact
[1:47:19] somebody's spirit look him in the
[1:47:21] eye get their attention that's how you
[1:47:24] contact them and brother saying that's
[1:47:27] what Jesus did he had to talk to the
[1:47:28] woman to catch your spirit and get her
[1:47:30] to look at
[1:47:31] it and then you can start helping out
[1:47:34] somebody he said each one of you you're
[1:47:36] looking at me your eye is the gate to
[1:47:39] your soul huh so the outward flesh body
[1:47:45] is the first gate down to the Third
[1:47:48] Realm so there there is a gate in your
[1:47:51] outer realm it's called your
[1:47:53] eye it's called your
[1:47:55] eyesight that is the first gate that
[1:47:59] gets in that Satan's trying to get in or
[1:48:01] God's trying to get in Glory Hallelujah
[1:48:04] that's the first gate where God is
[1:48:06] trying God or Satan is trying to
[1:48:08] influence your soul he's trying to work
[1:48:10] his way down to the second uh ground and
[1:48:13] then down to the Third Realm the first
[1:48:15] gate is in your flesh it's your
[1:48:18] eyes how many believe that
[1:48:22] brother said that about Paul and Peter
[1:48:24] they couldn't heal the people until they
[1:48:25] got him to look at
[1:48:26] them and then Peter could say I see you
[1:48:28] got faith to be healed he said a loud
[1:48:30] voice rise in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:32] you're healed how he saw it Through The
[1:48:35] Eyes
[1:48:37] glory amen Church your eyes a gate to
[1:48:41] your soul you can look at it it almost
[1:48:45] governs the other
[1:48:48] senses so you're eye governs almost
[1:48:51] governs all your other
[1:48:54] senses how many how many can say Amen to
[1:48:56] that think about it throughout the day
[1:48:58] what's the things you remember at the
[1:48:59] end of the day well probably what you
[1:49:01] saw right probably what you heard your
[1:49:05] last few thoughts well I saw that video
[1:49:07] oh my I saw that news
[1:49:10] article that's what brother Ram said he
[1:49:12] said it's
[1:49:14] usually no he now I gu an example he
[1:49:16] said you look at something before you
[1:49:18] taste it don't you you just don't start
[1:49:19] eating things about looking at it your
[1:49:21] first and most important sense is your
[1:49:25] eyes now after church we can try that my
[1:49:27] wife brought some soup you don't have to
[1:49:28] look at it and I'll just you'll close
[1:49:30] your eyes I'll take my spoon I'll put in
[1:49:32] the soup and I'll put in your mouth how
[1:49:34] many would like that you would like your
[1:49:36] taste probably but just the idea of
[1:49:39] something go contacting you that you
[1:49:42] haven't looked at no I got to look at it
[1:49:45] that's why Christmas presents or
[1:49:46] birthday presents are so
[1:49:48] excited what's under there what's under
[1:49:51] that wrapping paper that's why kids love
[1:49:53] Christmas who doesn't I mean who doesn't
[1:49:54] like to get a gift Wendy's like Wendy's
[1:49:56] like the queen of giving gifts you know
[1:49:57] I got but God anoints her to do that
[1:49:59] there's been times I've been so
[1:50:00] discouraged Wendy will give me a gift
[1:50:02] I'm like oh no I'm not telling you get
[1:50:04] me gift sister I'm just saying I'm just
[1:50:06] giving you a rose but that's her
[1:50:08] Ministry it seems like to be able to be
[1:50:11] sensitive to the needs of others and to
[1:50:12] bless
[1:50:13] others my wife will give me things like
[1:50:15] Oh Glory oh I just I needed that I
[1:50:18] wanted that how did you know
[1:50:21] there's something about your eyes
[1:50:22] catching it he said you look at
[1:50:26] something before you smell
[1:50:29] it and feel it and so forth so the sense
[1:50:32] that governs all your other senses
[1:50:33] brother manam said is
[1:50:38] sight and that's the first gate to your
[1:50:42] soul and the Bible said the soul that
[1:50:44] sinth it shall what
[1:50:48] die Satan is trying to influence your
[1:50:50] soul so that disbelieves God's word how
[1:50:52] many you going to believe God's word
[1:50:53] today
[1:50:55] Glory he's trying to get your soul to
[1:50:57] disbelieve it God can't do this God's
[1:50:59] not worth my time God's not worth the
[1:51:01] investment of my youth yes he is I'm 35
[1:51:04] years old I gave my life to Christ at 19
[1:51:06] if I could go back I would have gave it
[1:51:08] to him at five Glory it's been the
[1:51:10] greatest investment you say well you
[1:51:11] miss the sewing your wild seeds and
[1:51:14] things like that I didn't want to sew
[1:51:15] wild seeds I want to seow seeds of faith
[1:51:17] I want to se seeds of Holiness the Bible
[1:51:19] said remember the Creator in the days of
[1:51:21] your youth because the days will come
[1:51:23] when you're older and you'll say I have
[1:51:24] no pleasure in them I got arthritis I
[1:51:26] can't get off the wheelchair I'm in a h
[1:51:29] I'm in a nursing home all these things
[1:51:30] where the physical things of Life Won't
[1:51:33] Be pleasurable remember God now and will
[1:51:35] bless your later years
[1:51:41] amen
[1:51:43] glory the eye is the gate to your
[1:51:46] soul no wonder Peter said the lust of
[1:51:49] the flesh FL make you war against your
[1:51:51] soul how many remember that
[1:51:54] scripture you ever feel like you're
[1:51:56] having a war with yourself ever feel
[1:51:58] like that I want to do what's right but
[1:52:00] I can't I want to do what's right but I
[1:52:03] keep struggling it's a war it's a war
[1:52:07] going on with your soul the soul that
[1:52:09] the seed of God that wants to live and
[1:52:11] be expressed and be quickened and and
[1:52:13] made alive that Soul wants to be made
[1:52:15] alive it wants full control but when we
[1:52:17] give over to the affections and lust of
[1:52:19] the flesh it creates a war within us
[1:52:23] that's why the peace of God only comes
[1:52:25] when we fully obey the word of God
[1:52:27] praise the
[1:52:29] Lord and church there's a very easy way
[1:52:31] to get peace it's called
[1:52:34] repentance it's extremely
[1:52:37] simple God doesn't make it too hard the
[1:52:39] Bible said a fool won't air in this way
[1:52:41] it's so easy a fool can't miss it all
[1:52:44] you have to do is say I'm sorry and Lord
[1:52:45] I don't want to go back and you'll feel
[1:52:47] the peace of God sweep over your soul if
[1:52:50] you repented at all if you meant it at
[1:52:52] all and mean it from your heart you'll
[1:52:53] feel that sweet peace come because
[1:52:55] there's a war going on and once God gets
[1:52:57] the victory it's like a peace treaty no
[1:53:00] more guns fire no more no more killing
[1:53:02] no more this and that oh there's peace
[1:53:04] in the land Glory
[1:53:08] Hallelujah the eyes the gate to of the
[1:53:11] Soul
[1:53:13] now now verse eight so how did lot get
[1:53:16] how did how was he tormented every day
[1:53:17] by the things he saw and he heard
[1:53:21] so church if we're being if we're living
[1:53:23] a tormented life it's because of what
[1:53:26] we're seeing and hearing probably and
[1:53:28] it's probably things we haven't repented
[1:53:30] of fully because really when when you
[1:53:32] what's repent repent is Du a 180 right
[1:53:35] repent if you don't repent you keep
[1:53:36] walking enjoying the sin but when you
[1:53:38] repent you actually go the other
[1:53:40] direction you got to do more than turn
[1:53:42] your back you actually got to go further
[1:53:44] into the right direction got to go more
[1:53:46] into Holiness that's what we do that's
[1:53:47] what we all battle with it some days you
[1:53:49] know we just turn our backs and say I'm
[1:53:50] sorry but we actually have to make some
[1:53:52] progress and get some victory you got to
[1:53:55] possess the land step by step praise the
[1:53:57] Lord little by little step by step
[1:54:00] you'll possess all your inheritance oh
[1:54:02] brother Jess I feel like there's more
[1:54:04] peace out there for me there is walk in
[1:54:06] it I feel like there's more Victory out
[1:54:09] there I feel like there's more
[1:54:10] Revelations out there I feel like
[1:54:11] there's more power out there more bonus
[1:54:13] out there there is walk into it one day
[1:54:16] at a time step by step God will lead you
[1:54:18] if we just make the make the walk and
[1:54:21] make our direction to walk into Holiness
[1:54:24] and not stay defeated how many love the
[1:54:27] Lord
[1:54:29] beautiful the word is
[1:54:31] beautiful so this is why he's tormented
[1:54:34] what he saw and heard it's so important
[1:54:36] church now let's do a few more now I
[1:54:39] want to get now into lust or like we
[1:54:41] said porneia let's go to Proverbs 5 now
[1:54:43] we're going to read about four
[1:54:44] scriptures in Proverbs so just have your
[1:54:46] Bibles handy
[1:54:47] there this sets you free this sets you
[1:54:49] free
[1:54:52] free I thought about this you know when
[1:54:54] you when you turn your Bible real fast
[1:54:55] like that it creates a wind doesn't it
[1:54:57] it's like the wind that that that kind
[1:54:59] of ignites the fire in your
[1:55:01] soul that's how I look at it by God's
[1:55:03] gra you see I go like that all that wind
[1:55:05] comes and it ignites my soul to read
[1:55:07] more of the word
[1:55:09] amen
[1:55:12] glory maybe that's a childlike
[1:55:14] expression but that's how I feel Robbs
[1:55:18] 55
[1:55:23] okay now this is speaking of a woman
[1:55:25] let's go to verse three though Proverbs
[1:55:26] 5:3 for the lips of a strange woman drop
[1:55:28] as a honeycomb and her mouth is smoother
[1:55:31] than oil he's describing an evil
[1:55:34] woman on the outside it's really smooth
[1:55:36] and sweet isn't it sin is always
[1:55:39] pleasurable for a season but the end of
[1:55:41] sin is
[1:55:43] death
[1:55:45] separation verse four but her end is
[1:55:47] bitter as wormwood sharp as the
[1:55:49] two-edged sword her feet go down to
[1:55:51] death her steps take hold on hell so
[1:55:55] other words when she possesses the land
[1:55:57] her steps take hold on the land of
[1:55:59] Destruction the Lake of Fire that's
[1:56:02] where her steps are going her steps take
[1:56:04] a hold of hell that's the direction
[1:56:06] she's walking but we got to walk the
[1:56:09] other direction praise the lord we got
[1:56:11] to walk away from lust and walk toward
[1:56:14] the Heavenly land towards our Promised
[1:56:16] Land by God's
[1:56:18] grace
[1:56:20] so the seductress or the adulterous
[1:56:22] woman is always connected to hell
[1:56:25] because a forn a fornicator or adulterer
[1:56:27] will not inherit the kingdom of God any
[1:56:29] sexual sin outside of marriage that's
[1:56:32] not in the Holy uh undefiled bed if not
[1:56:35] repented of that person will not inherit
[1:56:37] the kingdom of God any sexual sin that's
[1:56:40] exactly right I believe I can back that
[1:56:42] up by all the scripture because one of
[1:56:43] those uh Greek words means any sexual
[1:56:45] act in the Greek it can mean anything
[1:56:48] anything that's not approved by
[1:56:50] God God help us to repent amen just just
[1:56:54] just like Sams just repent say Lord once
[1:56:55] more bring the Holy Ghost back forgive
[1:56:58] me uh he'll he'll come back in a
[1:57:00] powerful way Proverbs
[1:57:03] 7:27 here's another
[1:57:07] one okay go to verse 25 let not thine
[1:57:10] heart decline her
[1:57:12] ways uh go not astray in her paths so
[1:57:15] see what she is uh a woman that's a
[1:57:17] seductoras or let me say like this any
[1:57:19] any uh uh temptation to your eyes it's
[1:57:22] taking you on a
[1:57:24] decline praise God it's taking you on a
[1:57:27] decline not on an incline it's a decline
[1:57:30] why because sin is the easier way how
[1:57:33] many ever run downhill it's pretty easy
[1:57:34] isn't
[1:57:35] it how many never tried to run uphill
[1:57:37] now you got a real challenge now you're
[1:57:40] GNA see What You're Made Of but
[1:57:42] everybody loves to run her right there b
[1:57:44] down the hill it's so easy that's how
[1:57:46] sin is sin is so easy and that your
[1:57:48] speed picks up as you
[1:57:50] go the closer you get to spiritual death
[1:57:53] and all these evil fruits and corrupt
[1:57:55] fruits and all these things like that
[1:57:57] but to walk the narrow way it's an
[1:57:59] Ascension Glory it's going higher and
[1:58:02] higher in Christ Living in Heavenly
[1:58:04] places in Christ
[1:58:06] Jesus now look at her she's this woman
[1:58:09] she's a quite a foe for she have cast on
[1:58:13] many
[1:58:15] wounded see what happened people get
[1:58:17] wounded in their spirits and she cast
[1:58:19] them down they get wounded for example
[1:58:22] people might get wounded maybe they get
[1:58:23] hurt by a boyfriend they get hurt by a
[1:58:25] girlfriend and so they just want some
[1:58:27] love so they go out and get a prostitute
[1:58:28] or something like that right or somebody
[1:58:31] breaks their heart and so they go out
[1:58:33] and they go with somebody they shouldn't
[1:58:34] go
[1:58:35] with and so Satan anoints people to have
[1:58:39] somebody ready there to tempt them with
[1:58:41] a relationship tempt them with lust and
[1:58:44] that person will snatch many wounded
[1:58:47] people see how we got to have the
[1:58:48] healing of Christ in our
[1:58:51] lives when there's a hurt situation
[1:58:53] someone hurt you you better pray for
[1:58:55] healing and the church said you better
[1:58:58] pray for healing you better pray for
[1:59:00] divine love perfect love I'm not saying
[1:59:02] scars won't exist there might be little
[1:59:03] scars but I'm saying if you really have
[1:59:05] healing in your heart you can look at
[1:59:07] that person and say thank God Jesus died
[1:59:08] for them amen and you don't have the
[1:59:11] complex anymore like I hate this person
[1:59:13] every time I around them I feel hatred
[1:59:14] and that you got to cast out upon the
[1:59:16] Lord amen you've got to cast down
[1:59:19] anything that exalts itself against the
[1:59:21] glory of God Amen if not it will eat you
[1:59:26] alive and it you'll be wounded like a
[1:59:28] wounded
[1:59:29] soldier brother talked about that
[1:59:31] wounded soldier at
[1:59:33] Amnesia F but just not go that direction
[1:59:36] but just so you know people get wounded
[1:59:38] they let sin remain in their hearts and
[1:59:40] they don't let themselves be healed by
[1:59:42] God they don't let the bomb and Gilead
[1:59:43] come and heal them and those the kind
[1:59:45] Satan targets those that are already
[1:59:47] wounded and hurting God help us to be
[1:59:49] healed every
[1:59:51] service that's why every service is
[1:59:54] important get healing get time to
[1:59:56] worship time to love God time to pray
[1:59:59] time to seek God if not you're going to
[2:00:00] be so busy when you GNA when are you
[2:00:02] gonna find time how many of you give the
[2:00:04] last three how many service is usually
[2:00:06] three hours right sometimes too on
[2:00:08] Wednesday night how many of you just on
[2:00:10] your free time give two hours every
[2:00:12] every other night for God how many you
[2:00:13] do that I say hardly hardly any probably
[2:00:16] do just out of your love for God that's
[2:00:18] why service is so important to stay in
[2:00:21] tune with the Holy Spirit brother R said
[2:00:22] always be where the spirit of God is
[2:00:24] pouring out and I feel he's pouring out
[2:00:26] this morning amen glory for those who
[2:00:30] want them to pour out on
[2:00:32] them
[2:00:34] Glory see it's those that are wounded
[2:00:36] that don't take care of their sins or
[2:00:37] their hurts they just say well I'm I'm
[2:00:39] wounded somebody hurt me somebody that's
[2:00:41] fine but Jesus is here to heal you don't
[2:00:44] stay wounded be
[2:00:46] healed in Jesus name don't hold any
[2:00:49] bitterness against anybody brother said
[2:00:51] never have any bitterness in your heart
[2:00:52] towards anybody or else Satan will get
[2:00:54] in
[2:00:55] there yay many strong men have been
[2:00:57] slain by her David was slain now just
[2:00:59] for a temporal time I'm not talking
[2:01:01] about eternity Samson was slain right
[2:01:04] what got them women temptation of
[2:01:07] women is that right Church they were
[2:01:10] slain for a few moments thank God he
[2:01:13] resurrected
[2:01:14] them her house is the way to hell want
[2:01:19] to go to hell go follow a woman who's
[2:01:22] got a lustful Spirit on her or go get
[2:01:24] involved in any lust of the
[2:01:27] flesh that's the house is the way to
[2:01:29] Hell going down to the chambers of death
[2:01:32] imagine entering into a prison house or
[2:01:34] some type of Chamber Of Death that's
[2:01:37] what it's like to commit adultery that's
[2:01:40] what it's like to commit
[2:01:42] fornication now say like that that's
[2:01:43] what it's like to be addicted to
[2:01:45] pornography exactly
[2:01:48] right
[2:01:49] Proverbs
[2:01:51] 9:18 this is how the Bible describes
[2:01:53] this this is not something we should
[2:01:55] take lightly what you see what you hear
[2:01:58] you must guard it like a soldier amen
[2:02:00] that's
[2:02:01] right oh last
[2:02:04] night had that good illustration last
[2:02:07] night when we were
[2:02:08] fellowshipping some people say well how
[2:02:10] come we're not how come oh he said Jesus
[2:02:12] is the five star
[2:02:14] general right now what if your general
[2:02:16] said just stay here and guard your your
[2:02:19] your
[2:02:20] headquarters oh I want to go and fight
[2:02:22] though General come on I want to see
[2:02:23] more signs and I want to slay more
[2:02:25] devils and I but what if your general
[2:02:27] just say it's time for a guarding time
[2:02:29] right now it's not exactly war time it's
[2:02:31] not full-blown War would you be happy
[2:02:35] and that's what I think the bride's
[2:02:36] going through right now she's getting
[2:02:37] trained to guard herself for one final
[2:02:42] showdown about Zion Showdown
[2:02:46] amen she's guarding her life she's
[2:02:48] guarding in headquarters she's making
[2:02:50] sure everybody's sealed she's making
[2:02:51] sure the tokens applied amen glory she's
[2:02:55] making sure there's and keeping ey all
[2:02:56] the demons making sure the blood's on
[2:02:58] the lentil and the doorpost and making
[2:03:00] sure she's guarded like a soldier just
[2:03:02] walking back any devil that comes up she
[2:03:04] slays it in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:03:07] amen well come on I want to go out and
[2:03:09] do these things what but what if your
[2:03:11] general said just guard the house just
[2:03:13] say would you be able to keep your duty
[2:03:15] would you be able to keep keep your
[2:03:16] orders my prayer is God let me obey your
[2:03:20] orders if this just time to guard my
[2:03:22] family until a great final battle comes
[2:03:25] then God let me do it with the sword of
[2:03:27] the
[2:03:28] spirit let me stand there like a soldier
[2:03:31] that was a beautiful illustration last
[2:03:32] night don't you that's
[2:03:34] beautiful my that's a good thought Glory
[2:03:38] would you like that okay now Proverbs
[2:03:41] 9:18 I never got to that
[2:03:43] okay now in Proverbs 9 it Compares a
[2:03:46] woman to a well and remember God told
[2:03:48] Sal or Solomon told his son drink from
[2:03:50] your own water so Brothers we have to
[2:03:53] look at women like that God has one well
[2:03:56] for
[2:03:57] you all women are wells to a man because
[2:04:00] a man's thirsty right the Bible calls it
[2:04:04] a burning how many know that God places
[2:04:06] in a man to reproduce to multiply said
[2:04:09] he can't get away from that brother said
[2:04:10] it's totally impossible for a man to
[2:04:13] look at a woman who's half naked and not
[2:04:14] get a sensation pass over him we're
[2:04:16] going to get to that in a little bit
[2:04:17] it's called dopamine
[2:04:19] something in this human spirit is
[2:04:21] released he has no control over that so
[2:04:23] he's got to have somebody to control
[2:04:25] that GL
[2:04:28] amen he can't control the feeling but he
[2:04:31] can control the reaction amen he can
[2:04:34] control his next step he can't control
[2:04:37] the the dopamine from being released and
[2:04:38] all these things but he can't control
[2:04:40] his next decision is he GNA pursue that
[2:04:42] opportunity or is he going to turn it
[2:04:44] down in the name of
[2:04:46] Jesus
[2:04:47] Hallelujah
[2:04:51] so every woman to a man is like a
[2:04:54] whale but God has one well where the man
[2:04:57] is supposed to get his
[2:05:00] refreshing
[2:05:01] right now verse
[2:05:04] 17 stolen waters are sweet see when
[2:05:07] people steal other men's wives it tastes
[2:05:10] sweet to them at first and bread eaten
[2:05:13] in secret is Pleasant secret sins they
[2:05:16] don't tell anybody well let's just have
[2:05:18] an affair on the side let's just have a
[2:05:19] fornication before we're married and
[2:05:21] nobody will know about it well God knows
[2:05:22] about it yes sir it sure taste sweet it
[2:05:25] sure that taste sweet uh my first
[2:05:28] denominational Pastor when I first gave
[2:05:29] my heart to the lord gave this
[2:05:30] illustration he said your sexual your
[2:05:32] sexuality is like a
[2:05:34] Band-Aid the first time you have an
[2:05:36] interaction that Band-Aid is stuck on
[2:05:38] that person if that person doesn't
[2:05:41] remain your spouse the Band-Aid gets
[2:05:42] tore off and it's a little less sticky
[2:05:45] the next
[2:05:46] time everybody understand what I'm
[2:05:48] saying and so you need to wait we need
[2:05:49] to wait up on God and wait till uh God
[2:05:52] brings us the right spouse now listen
[2:05:55] most of us have have had sexual trials
[2:05:57] or or mistakes before most of us right
[2:06:00] church so what God does is God brings
[2:06:03] healing in the process are you with me
[2:06:05] but that was a great illustration to
[2:06:07] understand that you got to really guard
[2:06:09] it and you got to understand that that
[2:06:11] we have to wait upon the Lord for his
[2:06:13] leadership praise the
[2:06:16] Lord and give all that we have have to
[2:06:19] the person God's called us to
[2:06:21] have I thought that was a good
[2:06:23] illustration like I said there's healing
[2:06:24] in it and so forth we know God heals and
[2:06:26] can restore uh God can restore the
[2:06:28] stickiness can I say like that God can
[2:06:31] restore sayith the Lord that's right so
[2:06:34] what I mean is by that you'll enjoy the
[2:06:35] that relationship more in marriage by
[2:06:38] God's grace that's what I mean to say by
[2:06:40] the grace of the Lord
[2:06:42] okay but he knoweth not that the Dead
[2:06:45] are there so see this is a man who's
[2:06:47] taken adultery and not her and that her
[2:06:50] guests are in the depths of
[2:06:52] hell right so a man who say like this
[2:06:56] addicted to the internet lust or he
[2:06:59] actually goes out to prostitutes or a
[2:07:01] woman who's C in adultery or something
[2:07:03] like that they don't even realize
[2:07:05] they're living amongst the dead and
[2:07:07] that's why you heard preachers preach on
[2:07:08] zombies a lot because zombies are like
[2:07:09] the living dead that's what a lot of
[2:07:11] people are today those that are
[2:07:12] predestinated for hell they're like the
[2:07:14] Living Dead they're alive physically but
[2:07:16] dead spiritually and they're never Liv
[2:07:17] spiritually
[2:07:20] right so her guests are in the depths of
[2:07:23] hell so all the people that do those
[2:07:25] same acts as an immoral woman today or
[2:07:28] immoral man they're all guests in the
[2:07:30] depths of hell they're all predestined
[2:07:33] to
[2:07:34] that
[2:07:36] right now Proverbs
[2:07:41] 27:20 I'm thankful for the delivering
[2:07:43] power of the Holy Spirit I'm thankful
[2:07:45] for the healing power of the Holy Spirit
[2:07:47] let's not be wounded church if you have
[2:07:49] a wound go to Jesus and say Heal Me and
[2:07:52] the next time Satan tries to come back
[2:07:53] you say I don't hurt me anymore I'm
[2:07:55] Healed Hallelujah that can't hurt me I'm
[2:07:58] not wounded anymore I'm Healed by the
[2:08:00] power of the Holy
[2:08:02] Spirit that's a reality church that's a
[2:08:07] reality and that's for any sin not just
[2:08:09] sexual sin any
[2:08:11] sin Proverbs 2710 I believe it
[2:08:14] was that
[2:08:16] right oh yeah thank you brother
[2:08:18] appreciate that yes look at you thank
[2:08:20] you
[2:08:22] glory hell and destruction are Never
[2:08:25] full so the eyes of man are never
[2:08:28] satisfied that's why men with the lust
[2:08:30] problems and internet problems and
[2:08:31] things like that they can never get
[2:08:33] enough they never get enough It's never
[2:08:37] enough so if someone doesn't repent
[2:08:40] they'll keep going and wanting more and
[2:08:42] more and more and
[2:08:44] more the same thing is true though for a
[2:08:46] Christian who's repented once you get
[2:08:48] some of God you just want more and more
[2:08:51] and more and you're never satisfied you
[2:08:53] want more and more of Jesus how many you
[2:08:54] believe that Glory that's right I can
[2:08:57] never get up of the preaching and the
[2:08:59] worship and the
[2:09:00] word uh last Sunday I was so hungry for
[2:09:02] God that there was no message churches
[2:09:04] in our area so I just I I just prayed
[2:09:06] and asked God to Lead Me went to
[2:09:07] Assembly of God
[2:09:08] Church because that's the church I was
[2:09:10] Raising I thought well if I can't get a
[2:09:12] whole over get a few
[2:09:14] slices and church I got a few
[2:09:16] slices the worship was beautiful they
[2:09:19] had the piano there I was such a I felt
[2:09:22] the presence of the Lord this was end
[2:09:25] time became a more reality to me there
[2:09:27] was people that right raising up crying
[2:09:29] and praising God thaning for but as soon
[2:09:31] as the preacher got there he cracked
[2:09:32] some jokes and you could just feel like
[2:09:34] oh the anointing just
[2:09:39] left and in the middle of his message he
[2:09:42] went into First Corinthians 2 and he
[2:09:44] started dealing with how there's
[2:09:46] Mysteries we speak the wisdom of God in
[2:09:48] a mystery and he keep saying we got to
[2:09:50] go deeper there's deeper Revelations
[2:09:52] there's deeper Mysteries that God wants
[2:09:54] to reveal to us before the end
[2:09:57] time I was
[2:09:59] like and he said he said God got God's
[2:10:02] forign knowledge he said God is like a
[2:10:04] he didn't know anywhere to explain it he
[2:10:05] said but like a card player how they he
[2:10:08] said PE people can cheat and mark the
[2:10:09] cards so they know what cards you got
[2:10:11] across the table if you're playing cars
[2:10:12] he said that's kind of how God is now
[2:10:14] that he said that's sacrilegious I said
[2:10:16] yeah that is but he said God knows
[2:10:19] everybody's hand and God knows all the
[2:10:22] cards and he said God knows that who
[2:10:25] that are here today that are children of
[2:10:27] God and who are not I thought mercy here
[2:10:30] we are he's preached on Mysteries he
[2:10:32] said there's greater deep things to go
[2:10:33] into and I thought thank God that's
[2:10:35] exactly what God has done for me he's
[2:10:37] taken me into the deep things of God
[2:10:39] he's revealed his word to me the Bible's
[2:10:41] a new Bible and now I know who everybody
[2:10:43] is I know who the Jew is I know who the
[2:10:45] foolish virgin is I know who the sinner
[2:10:47] is and I know who the right is most
[2:10:49] importantly I know who Christ is amen
[2:10:52] he's the
[2:10:53] word hallelujah he's not a denomination
[2:10:57] he's not a Creed he's not a tradition
[2:10:59] he's the
[2:11:02] word it was such a wonderful time of
[2:11:04] Lord you are truly speaking to me and he
[2:11:06] stopped at the verse verse 10 verse 10
[2:11:08] says but he has revealed him unto us the
[2:11:11] deep and secret things he stopped right
[2:11:13] there I thought oh mercy if God ain't
[2:11:15] speaking here this morning I don't know
[2:11:16] who
[2:11:17] is he's crying at the end say here now
[2:11:19] here's crying at the end saying God he
[2:11:21] said eyes not seen ear ear Hur about
[2:11:24] what you're going to do it's going to be
[2:11:25] greater than isusa
[2:11:27] street because what is their what's
[2:11:29] their denomination based on ausa street
[2:11:32] and they're looking for something
[2:11:33] greater he talked about uh different
[2:11:36] Miracles and things that would be
[2:11:37] greater than what ausia street was and
[2:11:40] they're expecting the whole world to be
[2:11:42] revived and saved that's the Revival
[2:11:45] they're looking for brother said thus
[2:11:46] sayth the Lord it will not be a
[2:11:48] worldwide Revival it will be a bride's
[2:11:51] Revival it will be a latter rain on the
[2:11:55] true seat of God Amen they will never
[2:11:58] have a word Revival they might have some
[2:12:01] type of gathering together they're
[2:12:03] gathering together to academical council
[2:12:05] ra said that's the hour we're living in
[2:12:07] is The Binding of the tears how many
[2:12:08] know that that's the hour you're living
[2:12:10] in is The Binding of the tears well if
[2:12:13] they're being bounded together then
[2:12:14] we're maturing and we're learning how to
[2:12:17] bow to the Sun right aren't you glad for
[2:12:19] that the tears are getting plucked up
[2:12:22] one by one their denominations they're
[2:12:23] getting plucked up and get ready to be
[2:12:25] bound together and we're just laying
[2:12:26] there enjoying the rains Glory enjoying
[2:12:29] the word just loving God just bowing
[2:12:32] saying thank you Jesus send the rain and
[2:12:34] the rain both wheat and tear are praying
[2:12:36] for Revival but we're the only ones
[2:12:38] that's going to have the right revival
[2:12:40] can you say Amen to that
[2:12:42] Glory they are so misguided and there's
[2:12:45] nothing against them it's because their
[2:12:47] hearts haven't open so the the man comes
[2:12:49] up he said can you fill out this card
[2:12:50] the pastor wants to contact you I said
[2:12:52] sure here's my website here's my number
[2:12:54] he hasn't contacted me yet but hopefully
[2:12:55] he does by God's grace God is everywhere
[2:12:58] church if you go with a Hungry Heart God
[2:13:00] will speak to you
[2:13:02] amen beat on you according to your faith
[2:13:05] that's what Jesus says okay Proverbs
[2:13:08] 27:20 yes thank you sir uh never
[2:13:11] satisfied yes eyes are never satisfied
[2:13:14] so they can never get
[2:13:15] enough now let's look at some studies
[2:13:17] here bear with me just a moment um I
[2:13:21] want to read these studies here now I've
[2:13:22] got these from a YouTube channel called
[2:13:25] Covenant eyes they're a company that uh
[2:13:27] they make uh software for computers and
[2:13:30] tablets uh that keeps you away from uh
[2:13:34] lustful websites I'll say like
[2:13:36] that and we did it for a few years but
[2:13:39] then I found a way to do it without you
[2:13:40] know paying the money to them to have us
[2:13:42] do it uh so I found a way to do it on
[2:13:44] your on your iPad you can uh restrict
[2:13:47] things and things like that which is
[2:13:47] which is really nice restrict websites
[2:13:49] and you have to have permission to go to
[2:13:50] any new website so that's kind of nice
[2:13:52] you don't have to pay the extra $20 a
[2:13:54] month you know there's a way to do it by
[2:13:55] God's
[2:13:56] grace but anyways this this website does
[2:13:59] uh this company does great studies on
[2:14:01] pornography almost every week they put
[2:14:03] out a new video talking about the
[2:14:04] harmful effects of it and it's a really
[2:14:07] good uh YouTube channel there I got I've
[2:14:09] been very helped by it so let's let's
[2:14:12] read a few of these here okay so now you
[2:14:15] can just you know can just kind of
[2:14:16] listen to some of these facts here
[2:14:20] they made a video said the essential
[2:14:21] reason why lust is wrong now I'm not I'm
[2:14:23] going to use the word lust instead of
[2:14:24] the other
[2:14:26] word they make a they make a point
[2:14:29] showing that the act of this lust is not
[2:14:32] love it's selfish selfish
[2:14:34] usage so they they say the whole the
[2:14:37] whole reason behind why lust is wrong is
[2:14:39] because it's a selfish act it's someone
[2:14:42] selfishly using something for their
[2:14:44] desire rather than God's desire that's
[2:14:46] so true that is so
[2:14:49] true and like I said it's for women like
[2:14:51] I experienc in Minnesota it's for women
[2:14:53] and men anything you look at and lust
[2:14:55] after without it being the will of God
[2:14:57] it's a selfish usage and not the will of
[2:15:01] God here are four ways that lust warps
[2:15:04] the human male brain it says these from
[2:15:06] a real real studies they list them on
[2:15:08] the
[2:15:08] video lust gives watching lust gives men
[2:15:12] a
[2:15:13] new unrealistic standard of
[2:15:16] beauty so men learn by watching these
[2:15:19] videos and and websites and women too
[2:15:21] they learn a different definition of
[2:15:24] beauty okay so an instead of the word
[2:15:26] being their definition of beauty and
[2:15:28] instead of filtering your thoughts
[2:15:29] through the word they filter it through
[2:15:31] a evil
[2:15:32] website or a bad a bad movie and because
[2:15:36] of just watching that over and over it
[2:15:38] reprograms their brain to associate
[2:15:42] Beauty with these evil things these evil
[2:15:45] pictures evil videos and it takes it
[2:15:48] takes all the value of the woman away
[2:15:50] they no longer care about the inward
[2:15:51] beauty of a woman they only care about
[2:15:53] the external and it's a lust of what
[2:15:55] just the flesh It's All Flesh nothing
[2:15:58] about the character nothing about the
[2:16:00] soul of a woman and that's sad when
[2:16:02] Brothers marry women just for the sexual
[2:16:03] benefit of it that's a sad thing they
[2:16:05] don't even treat her like a sister in
[2:16:07] Christ that's a real sad thing she's a
[2:16:10] daughter of God who has a soul as a
[2:16:12] human Spirit who wants to bond with a
[2:16:14] man all a man sees is just a physical
[2:16:17] use something selfish he can use that's
[2:16:19] lower than an
[2:16:20] animal praise God Amen they're beasts
[2:16:25] but a man don't look at a woman like the
[2:16:26] way she's supposed to be made to look at
[2:16:28] as a daughter of
[2:16:30] God next the second study showed male
[2:16:33] brains don't just view lust they enter
[2:16:35] into
[2:16:36] it now listen when a a brain in the
[2:16:39] brain Myra neurons fire in the brain
[2:16:42] when men watch lust which produce a
[2:16:45] reaction when you you it's the same
[2:16:46] reaction you see when uh when hit by a
[2:16:49] car and you feel the impact of what you
[2:16:50] viewed how many you ever seen that you
[2:16:52] watch somebody get hit you watch the
[2:16:53] video of somebody you know getting shot
[2:16:55] or whatever maybe you don't mean to but
[2:16:58] you you can actually feel that how many
[2:16:59] ever experienced that before you can
[2:17:01] feel what you're watching movies love to
[2:17:02] do that they'll make you feel it right
[2:17:05] fear or you know they'll make you feel
[2:17:07] that's what lust videos do it makes you
[2:17:10] enter into that what's going on because
[2:17:12] myew rounds fire
[2:17:15] says so when men watch it they're the
[2:17:18] actual one they enter into it and they
[2:17:20] become the ones
[2:17:22] acting in the video or on the on the on
[2:17:24] the
[2:17:26] picture they view their themselves as
[2:17:28] the main character the one who's
[2:17:30] powerful it makes the man feel like he's
[2:17:32] attractive and sought after by the woman
[2:17:35] so now he's validated now he's strong
[2:17:38] now he's attractive so now he's from
[2:17:41] he's left reality and he's come to a
[2:17:43] spot of
[2:17:46] fantasy
[2:17:48] and he becomes defiled so these Myra
[2:17:50] neurons place the man doing the ACT
[2:17:53] himself that's why Jesus said to lust in
[2:17:55] Matthew 5 to lust in your heart is doing
[2:17:58] the very same act because that's what
[2:18:00] seeing it does when a man watches that
[2:18:02] and enters into that he's literally
[2:18:03] coming into the video literally coming
[2:18:05] AP part of that
[2:18:07] picture because of
[2:18:09] the uh the my neurons in his
[2:18:14] brain number three the more a man
[2:18:16] watches lust the more brain looks like
[2:18:18] an addict's brain like
[2:18:20] alcoholics when hook up to MRI machine a
[2:18:23] lust addict's brain structure the vental
[2:18:26] dium lights up just as when an alcoholic
[2:18:29] brain lights up when it sees a picture
[2:18:31] of a beer same it has the same
[2:18:34] reaction researchers believe the more
[2:18:36] you watch lust like the more alcoh
[2:18:39] alcoholics look at and drink alcohol
[2:18:41] cause them to lose their willpower to
[2:18:43] turn down alcohol or lust you lose
[2:18:46] willpower to overcome it the the more
[2:18:47] you watch it the more you're taken by
[2:18:49] it like brother said about the maniac
[2:18:52] vad he lied one time a devil got on him
[2:18:55] he had a drink another devil came on he
[2:18:57] had another drink another devil come on
[2:18:58] him the more bad decisions you make the
[2:19:02] more Devils get on
[2:19:06] you so instead of I'm sorry they become
[2:19:09] slaves to lust or alcohol rather than
[2:19:11] enjoying it so at some point people stop
[2:19:13] enjoying it they're just a slave to it
[2:19:15] they just can't say no because of what's
[2:19:18] Happening up
[2:19:22] here now here let's look at how it
[2:19:24] impacts the brain now look this is how
[2:19:26] lust impacts the human Spirit I'm not
[2:19:28] GNA use the word brain anymore I'm gonna
[2:19:30] use the word Spirit that's a part of
[2:19:32] your that's part of your human Spirit
[2:19:35] right the brain is the well the the
[2:19:37] brain is the control center for
[2:19:38] everything your body does it's three
[2:19:40] pounds but uses 20% of blood and oxygen
[2:19:42] just to
[2:19:44] operate the brain is pliable it can be
[2:19:46] trained Chang molded shaped has a 100
[2:19:49] million neurons and is always making new
[2:19:52] connections if you allow it that's why
[2:19:53] brother R said read read books a
[2:19:56] lot and I've I've as a teacher I've read
[2:19:58] other articles too where if you don't
[2:20:00] read you get set in your ways and you
[2:20:01] cannot change anymore you become you
[2:20:04] become a know at all and you can't
[2:20:06] that's why old people they don't some
[2:20:08] some of the old people don't change
[2:20:09] anymore they can't overcome things
[2:20:10] because they get set in their ways they
[2:20:11] stop making new Connections in their
[2:20:13] brain the human Spirit their Spirits get
[2:20:16] lazy in the church say Amen to that amen
[2:20:19] so that's why it's good to constantly
[2:20:20] learn something new about the Lord the
[2:20:23] Bible say grow in Grace and what the
[2:20:26] knowledge when you learn something new
[2:20:27] about Christ it's like a new neuron path
[2:20:30] in your brain amen and it's all what
[2:20:32] going towards Christ it's all centered
[2:20:34] around Christ it's a beautiful thing God
[2:20:37] uh he he molds and pl and he trains our
[2:20:40] human Spirits all these new Pathways in
[2:20:42] our brains to think about Christ oh
[2:20:46] my
[2:20:49] now listen lust viewing lust triggers
[2:20:52] the same
[2:20:53] neurotransmitters and hormones as having
[2:20:55] the literal Act of
[2:20:57] lust but the effect is very different a
[2:20:59] man that is uh aroused towards lust
[2:21:04] dopamine is released and creates a state
[2:21:06] of tension and focus that got a habit
[2:21:09] feeling how many ever felt that you're
[2:21:11] watching something should say how many
[2:21:13] we've all felt that but you know it's
[2:21:15] like ever your flesh often feels like
[2:21:18] that I got to have
[2:21:20] this
[2:21:22] right that's the dope of me oh I've got
[2:21:25] to have this food I gotta have this
[2:21:26] video I gotta have this picture I gotta
[2:21:28] have this when it's pleasure For Your
[2:21:31] Love pleasure for your flesh that's
[2:21:33] dopamine I gotta have it it got It's
[2:21:35] gotta go through it this feeling that's
[2:21:40] dopamine it is a Feelgood reward that
[2:21:42] makes the person want to have more of
[2:21:44] the activity the feeling of dopamine is
[2:21:50] addictive then no I'm sorry no repine F
[2:21:55] I can't say no repine PR is released
[2:21:58] which creates more alertness burning
[2:22:00] this experience in our
[2:22:01] minds at the moment of heightened
[2:22:04] arousal oxytocin or vasopressin is
[2:22:08] released which create a emotional bond
[2:22:11] to the person or object causing the re
[2:22:14] arousal so a spiritual bond isect
[2:22:17] connected in your
[2:22:18] mind when someone has a a arousal
[2:22:21] experience whether it's with a wife
[2:22:23] which or husband which That's The Godly
[2:22:25] way how when you're married you want to
[2:22:27] have a connection with your husband and
[2:22:28] wife don't you that's right that's the B
[2:22:31] that's why God created these oxytocin
[2:22:33] and things like that dopamine he created
[2:22:34] it so you'll be so bonded to your spouse
[2:22:37] but when we go out when we when we have
[2:22:39] dopamine for lust of the flesh it
[2:22:41] creates a bond to what a computer screen
[2:22:44] it creates a bond yes it creates a a
[2:22:47] bond to a phone a bond to a tablet a
[2:22:49] bond to a
[2:22:51] laptop praise the
[2:22:53] Lord because that's where you're getting
[2:22:56] the arousal
[2:22:57] from so no matter wherever people go to
[2:23:00] satisfy their lust and that's why they
[2:23:02] can bonds to restaurants right right
[2:23:05] church or bond to certain foods if
[2:23:08] that's the heighten of their arousal and
[2:23:10] satisfies that I'm talking about sinful
[2:23:14] arouser like
[2:23:15] that that that's what happens and all
[2:23:18] these connections are made in the in the
[2:23:20] brain now it says the body also creates
[2:23:23] and releases o opiates creating a sense
[2:23:25] of euphor and release then serotonin is
[2:23:28] released causing calmness sense of
[2:23:30] well-being
[2:23:34] satisfaction now when someone's viewing
[2:23:36] lust the same neurotransmitters and
[2:23:38] hormones are released but they create
[2:23:41] different neurop Pathways in the brain
[2:23:43] see that so if you if you're married and
[2:23:45] you're able to have those experiences
[2:23:47] with your spouse they create a pathway
[2:23:49] in your SP in your brain to your spouse
[2:23:51] so whenever you think of your spouse
[2:23:53] that's the connection you have but if
[2:23:55] someone gives into lust or or you know
[2:23:58] internet lust and all these things like
[2:24:00] that they have a connection in their
[2:24:01] brain to the computer to that website to
[2:24:05] that image to that video is this all
[2:24:07] making sense by God's
[2:24:10] grace so it actually affects the human
[2:24:12] Spirit by training your mind what's that
[2:24:15] called what we say that was a stronghold
[2:24:18] amen glory a stronghold the stronghold
[2:24:21] in the human spirit that makes you feel
[2:24:24] bonded or connected with
[2:24:26] sin bonded or connected with anything
[2:24:29] that's outside the will of God
[2:24:39] stronghold now I want to go a little bit
[2:24:41] further okay 1121 okay yes we're doing
[2:24:44] pretty good I preach about hour and half
[2:24:45] I'll try to bring this down to the close
[2:24:47] I know I couldn't finish this but I
[2:24:48] should like to
[2:24:52] um let me pray here Lord
[2:24:58] Jesus um here's some signs when uh I'm
[2:25:01] reading this for the wives maybe
[2:25:02] streaming or here I'm reading this for
[2:25:04] the wives uh signs that your husband
[2:25:06] might be watching
[2:25:08] lust the first one is his uh his Desires
[2:25:13] in the bedroom of changeed I just read
[2:25:15] like that number two he might lose
[2:25:17] interest in the physical act of coming
[2:25:20] together see because that pathway is not
[2:25:22] being refreshed that pathway is not
[2:25:24] being strengthened now he's got a
[2:25:25] different Pathway to the computer or the
[2:25:28] maybe it's the wh house or whatever more
[2:25:30] that's a rough word you know what I'm
[2:25:31] saying red light district I'll say like
[2:25:33] that forgive
[2:25:34] me but the word hormonger is a Bible
[2:25:36] word
[2:25:38] right they actually lose interest in his
[2:25:40] wife because he has all these
[2:25:42] connections and bonds with other things
[2:25:44] outside the
[2:25:45] word uh he might even lose the ability
[2:25:48] to be intimate physically because that
[2:25:51] connection is no longer there with a
[2:25:52] with with his wife anymore he might even
[2:25:55] lose the physical ability to have that
[2:25:57] um number four the man spends excessive
[2:26:00] amount of time online and gets upset if
[2:26:02] he can't surf the Internet or have his
[2:26:04] private time on the internet that's one
[2:26:07] sign the man might be into things he's
[2:26:09] not oh he shouldn't be it during family
[2:26:12] time he's away online with a computer or
[2:26:14] phone or something like that another way
[2:26:17] is their internet history is always
[2:26:20] empty right because Inter internet
[2:26:22] history keeps all the websites aren't
[2:26:24] you glad God whites away our
[2:26:28] history praise the
[2:26:32] Lord how about times we've gone to the
[2:26:34] wrong websites or seen something aren't
[2:26:36] you glad God wipes that all way Mercy
[2:26:39] Jesus all the evil things we've said or
[2:26:41] done or something like that God wipes
[2:26:43] away all the history
[2:26:45] right the husband seems emotionally
[2:26:49] distant or withdrawn that's number six
[2:26:50] uh he number seven seems more antisocial
[2:26:53] so you don't want to live for others you
[2:26:54] don't care about others he just cares
[2:26:55] about his selfish desires number eight
[2:26:58] his financial patterns have changed
[2:27:00] maybe has new charges or new credit
[2:27:02] cards so his wife can't see his charges
[2:27:03] on his credit cards he can hide his
[2:27:05] addictions and his uh memberships on
[2:27:09] websites number nine he's secretive
[2:27:11] elusive evasive defensive he's nervous
[2:27:14] he's easily irritated easily bothered
[2:27:16] why are you coming in here and number 10
[2:27:19] this is an important one I think we've
[2:27:20] seen uh well I I talked to other people
[2:27:22] not in this church but other people

[2:27:26] wife's physical appearance so now his
[2:27:28] wife isn't pretty enough why because
[2:27:30] he's made Beauty he has a new definition
[2:27:33] of beauty now all the videos all the
[2:27:36] images he's looking at why because he's
[2:27:38] formed new Pathways in his human Spirit
[2:27:40] he's got strongholds in his human
[2:27:42] spirit that need to be taken
[2:27:45] down those are signs that
[2:27:48] people have this kind of
[2:27:50] trouble is this okay is it making sense

[2:28:29] that testimony

[2:28:42] I think I'll preach another sermon on
[2:28:43] this Lord willing later maybe next

[2:28:50] blessing in there Minnesota the Lord
[2:28:52] kind of opened up some more things but
[2:28:54] let's close with a few scriptures okay

[2:29:04] addictions God is my witness I hung this
[2:29:06] scripture up in my room I was in college
[2:29:08] and it helped me
[2:29:10] overcome every addiction I've
[2:29:12] had 1 Corinthians
[2:29:14] 6:12 now remember this is right after he
[2:29:17] says such were some of you you were
[2:29:18] fornicators adulterers but you're
[2:29:20] washing the blood of Jesus right and
[2:29:22] verse 12 now look at verse 12 all things
[2:29:25] are lawful unto me but all things are
[2:29:27] not expedient or
[2:29:31] beneficial all things are lawful me but
[2:29:33] I will not be brought under the power of
[2:29:37] any when I first came in the message
[2:29:39] this scripture hit me like a ton of
[2:29:40] bricks I realized wow tobacco was a
[2:29:44] power why because there's a demon behind
[2:29:48] it right online addictions are a power
[2:29:52] because there's a demon of addiction
[2:29:54] behind it praise the
[2:29:57] Lord so I had to realize that this is a
[2:30:00] power this is something that's stronger
[2:30:02] than me myself so I've got to have
[2:30:04] somebody greater that's in me than he
[2:30:06] that's in the
[2:30:08] world don't you love
[2:30:10] that all
[2:30:14] right Psalms 1013 let's read that
[2:30:18] there I will not like this is exactly
[2:30:21] what job said I will not be brought
[2:30:22] under the power of any I will make a
[2:30:24] covenant with my eyes I should not look
[2:30:27] upon a me why would I do that I made a
[2:30:29] if I made a promise with my eyes why
[2:30:31] would I look upon a made I won't because
[2:30:33] I made a promise to God brother Bram
[2:30:35] said you're only as good as your
[2:30:37] word when you confess you have to say
[2:30:39] that in your heart and maybe out loud
[2:30:41] God I am finished with this trouble now
[2:30:43] I don't have to be lust it could be
[2:30:45] something else I'm finished with lying
[2:30:46] I'm finishing with gossip I'm finishing
[2:30:48] with being greedy or critical spirit I
[2:30:50] see a lot of that
[2:30:52] sometimes you know you know how you
[2:30:53] recognize a critical spirit is somebody
[2:30:55] that points out other people's wrongs
[2:30:57] and then does nothing of themselves to
[2:30:59] to to fix the
[2:31:01] problem praise the
[2:31:03] Lord for example someone might criticize
[2:31:06] a church well that's fine they might be
[2:31:09] wrong but what are you doing to help
[2:31:11] them
[2:31:13] out are you doing are we doing anything
[2:31:15] to help out the people people that were
[2:31:17] criticizing ever say that can you catch
[2:31:20] that critical spirit I've seen it so
[2:31:22] much lately people just want to poke
[2:31:24] point out every they did like they like
[2:31:26] they have the gift to discernment they
[2:31:27] might but they just point out
[2:31:28] everybody's else's wrongs and they're
[2:31:30] not doing anything to help out the
[2:31:31] people they're just being critics to
[2:31:34] make themselves look better church
[2:31:37] that's sad it makes me want to
[2:31:39] cry because in in the message we point
[2:31:41] out a lot of demons don't we thank God
[2:31:44] but if we're not doing anything to help
[2:31:45] out anybody then we're just being
[2:31:47] critical if we're not using these things
[2:31:49] that we know to overcome sin and become
[2:31:52] more like Christ we're just being
[2:31:53] critical that's what you see a lot of
[2:31:55] message churches are they just criticize
[2:31:57] criticize I should say message could be
[2:31:58] any any church could be all churches
[2:32:01] yeah they just criticize criticize and
[2:32:03] they do nothing to help the person
[2:32:05] that's Fallen we gotta be like the Good
[2:32:06] Samaritan we see somebody down let's try
[2:32:08] to lift him up by God's grace you can
[2:32:10] just stand there and criticize you got
[2:32:11] beat up you got robbed look at you but
[2:32:14] if you never help them out how they ever
[2:32:15] going to get heal
[2:32:17] you got to give them oil and
[2:32:18] wine you got to take them to the end
[2:32:21] take them to the host Glory because he's
[2:32:23] got two pence from Christ he's got the
[2:32:25] spirit and truth and that'll bring
[2:32:27] healing to the individual can you say
[2:32:29] Amen so I I'm just laying that in there
[2:32:32] I want to preach a whole sermon on that
[2:32:33] one day if I can I don't I used to be
[2:32:35] critical I don't want to be a critical
[2:32:36] spirit anymore because if I if I see sin
[2:32:39] I want to go help somebody out of it I
[2:32:41] got to pray and say Lord pray for them
[2:32:43] first how many can say Amen to that pray
[2:32:45] for them first don't fight back and
[2:32:48] don't gossip and spread to other people
[2:32:50] the Bible said if you got real love you
[2:32:51] won't you'll hide you'll hide people's
[2:32:53] sins if you got real love for
[2:32:56] them you'll hide
[2:32:58] it and then you'll go do something about
[2:33:01] it now your only option might be to pray
[2:33:02] like if someone won't fellowship with
[2:33:04] you because of the sin or whatever your
[2:33:05] only option might be to pray well then
[2:33:07] you just pray and God will work it out
[2:33:10] let's not be critical make ourselves a
[2:33:11] judge and this wrong yeah we could all
[2:33:13] say that you could you can hang around
[2:33:15] me for a few hours you're going to say
[2:33:16] yes you're wrong with this people come
[2:33:17] to this church and they can find faults
[2:33:19] with anything they could preach a whole
[2:33:21] sermon on all the faults in our church
[2:33:23] and it might be true but what are they
[2:33:25] doing to help us out are you with be
[2:33:28] church what good does it do to point out
[2:33:30] all my errors if you don't show me how
[2:33:31] to fix
[2:33:33] it
[2:33:35] Glory that's the beauty of the right
[2:33:37] kind of discernment it will correct you
[2:33:41] by showing you the right path to walk in
[2:33:44] that's why I'm trying to do that by the
[2:33:45] grace of God God not to have a critical
[2:33:47] spirit because that only exalts a human
[2:33:50] but to have a spirit of
[2:33:52] Correction okay this is wrong now here
[2:33:54] apply this bone apply healing or go to
[2:33:57] that person oneon-one talk to them about
[2:33:58] it that'll bring healing pray until you
[2:34:01] feel you have victory over this help
[2:34:03] somebody out I know I'm going long here
[2:34:07] about an hour and a half now by God's
[2:34:08] grace so forgive
[2:34:11] me okay yeah Psalms
[2:34:15] 1013
[2:34:16] what I want to get into is bail worship
[2:34:19] and the Groves that's what I want to get
[2:34:21] into because that ties in with man caves
[2:34:23] I want to preach on man
[2:34:25] caves all these guys talk about going in
[2:34:27] their man cave they're going into a
[2:34:30] Grove and they're worshiping
[2:34:33] ba I I prove it I prove it by the word
[2:34:36] prove it by the word when they go down
[2:34:38] there and lust after they just put all
[2:34:40] things men love and lust it's it's a
[2:34:42] growth it's a secret Hideway sin is
[2:34:45] something they love to do I'm going to
[2:34:46] preach a whole sermon on that by God's
[2:34:48] grace do that sound good I see my
[2:34:50] Ministry is an my Ministry is an
[2:34:52] exposing sin I've seen that course it's
[2:34:54] in teaching as I'm a pastor when I go on
[2:34:56] evangelize that God has blessed my
[2:34:58] Ministry in such a way to expose sin and
[2:35:00] bring Deliverance to people's lives I
[2:35:02] just seen that's that's what's God's
[2:35:03] called me to do I gotta stay with what
[2:35:04] God called me to
[2:35:06] do Psalms 1013 um I'm not there but I'll
[2:35:10] get there in just a few turns of the
[2:35:12] beautiful Bible here okay I will set no
[2:35:16] Wicked thing before my eyes I hate the
[2:35:19] work of them that turn aside it shall
[2:35:20] not cleave to me now this is after he
[2:35:22] had contact with B Sheba what did he
[2:35:24] learn he said I will not set anything
[2:35:26] before my eyes that's wicked and I hate
[2:35:29] anything that will turn me aside from F
[2:35:31] see we got to when someone's involved in
[2:35:33] addictions they love it so much or they
[2:35:35] are slave to it so much they have to
[2:35:37] learn to hate it when I learn to hate my
[2:35:39] addictions wasn't long after a little
[2:35:41] prayer this guy was
[2:35:44] Overcomer by the grace of of Jesus
[2:35:46] Christ you got to hate your sin you got
[2:35:49] to want Victory more than anything over

[2:39:40] you speak in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:39:42] you better believe that God Honors that
[2:39:46] because he gave us the keys to the
[2:39:48] kingdom how me love the
[2:39:51] Lord let me just share this testimony
[2:39:53] brother Lord you come whenever you're
[2:39:55] ready maybe play that Turn Your Eyes
[2:39:58] Upon Jesus
[2:40:00] Glory we went to up there in Minnesota I
[2:40:02] share a little bit of testimony but
[2:40:04] after the services like I told
[2:40:07] you the first sermon I preach was on
[2:40:10] Gideon and the Groves now I called it
[2:40:11] Gideon the sword of the Lord in Gideon
[2:40:13] but I F the Holy Spirit just led me to
[2:40:15] preach on the Groves and I I was real I
[2:40:17] was really dramatic I was acting it all
[2:40:20] out and you know acting out Gideon in
[2:40:22] this Dad and it was it awesome I just
[2:40:25] felt the anointing of the Lord and God's
[2:40:27] my witness there was numerous Brothers
[2:40:28] probably four or five brothers that all
[2:40:29] come up confessing
[2:40:31] lust they were hiding their sins
[2:40:35] away and the ones that were sincere I
[2:40:37] believe got a blessing that day but I
[2:40:39] realized the script these scriptures
[2:40:41] started coming to me I said' if you will
[2:40:42] confess that sin and expose the devil
[2:40:45] and say it out loud now I don't to say
[2:40:47] it loud enough somebody can hear it but
[2:40:48] you got to speak the word
[2:40:50] right Devil's got to hear you and you
[2:40:52] got to have faith behind that word
[2:40:53] because you can say anything but you got
[2:40:54] a faith behind it and we I just I was
[2:40:57] weeping and crying with these brothers
[2:40:59] to help them get victory over this lust
[2:41:02] battle because it's Every Man's Battle
[2:41:05] praise God it's Every Man's Battle
[2:41:07] brother if you're a healthy man it's
[2:41:08] your battle but depending on how much
[2:41:11] you give into it is how much you
[2:41:13] struggle if you learn to cast it down if
[2:41:15] you learn if you starve starve the lust
[2:41:18] of the Flesh and don't let those
[2:41:19] connections be made in your your human
[2:41:21] Spirit you can really get the victory to
[2:41:25] each so I was very thankful there the
[2:41:27] Lord dealt with those things numerous
[2:41:29] Brothers come
[2:41:30] up sharing very personal things and I
[2:41:32] said just said praise the
[2:41:34] Lord but the one that meant the most of
[2:41:36] me was on Sunday night I preached on
[2:41:39] waiting on the Lord's Visions out of
[2:41:40] habach and showed all these prophecies
[2:41:43] and then ended with a call for the
[2:41:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:41:46] and the first person was up there was a
[2:41:48] a
[2:41:49] mother such a wonderful little mother
[2:41:51] she was and these little children and
[2:41:54] everything like that and she's weeping
[2:41:55] and crying I said sister do you want the
[2:41:57] Holy Ghost and she said no I've got the
[2:41:59] Holy Ghost but I'm addicted to watching
[2:42:02] YouTube movies and TV stations and I
[2:42:05] slip away from my family my children and
[2:42:07] I hide out and I watch TV shows right
[2:42:10] because YouTube has their own original
[2:42:12] TV
[2:42:14] shows I said sister God bless you for
[2:42:17] confessing that I said say it out loud
[2:42:19] say Satan I expose you in the name of
[2:42:21] Jesus Christ she starts weep she start
[2:42:23] she was already weeping and
[2:42:25] crying
[2:42:28] Glory I said tell
[2:42:31] him today that you're casting down his
[2:42:34] stronghold in your
[2:42:35] life and say this and say you're never
[2:42:38] coming you're never entering into my
[2:42:40] mind anymore in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:42:42] and she did and she got down there at
[2:42:44] the altar I'm leaving the services after
[2:42:46] we probably prayed for 30 minutes half
[2:42:48] an hour afterwards people crying at the
[2:42:49] altar I walk out there I'm walking out
[2:42:52] with the brothers and she kind of comes
[2:42:53] up right to me and kind of stops me and
[2:42:55] says brother Jesse I just want to tell
[2:42:56] you this whole weekend was for me she
[2:42:59] said everything you preach on about the
[2:43:00] Groves and everything about this this
[2:43:03] was all for me and she said I I really
[2:43:06] enjoy your message Sunday night she said
[2:43:08] but really I wasn't Hardy
[2:43:09] listening because I just wanted to lay
[2:43:12] on the Altar and die out to my addiction
[2:43:15] she said thank you for coming and church
[2:43:17] I left six kids here with a wife that
[2:43:19] had no electricity in your house our
[2:43:21] house sick kids I left Six Sick six kids
[2:43:25] that were
[2:43:26] sick and a wife and flew out there to
[2:43:29] Minnesota to preach the word of God and
[2:43:31] if it was to help deliver that mother so
[2:43:32] she can walk in the fullness of the Holy
[2:43:33] Ghost it's worth it all it is a great
[2:43:36] sacrifice it's hard on
[2:43:39] families it's worth it all to see when
[2:43:41] the word of God is inspired from Heaven
[2:43:44] that the children of God are set free he
[2:43:47] whom the son has set free is
[2:43:50] free let's bow our heads here for a
[2:43:55] moment I appreciate your patience I got
[2:43:58] through about half the message so maybe
[2:43:59] nor next Sunday or something like that
[2:44:01] we can deal more with this home
[2:44:03] Wreckers the eyes of
[2:44:05] lust I want you to think about your home
[2:44:08] I want you to think about your private
[2:44:10] time or just
[2:44:14] you most most of us here I would say if
[2:44:16] you've been serving to God a long time
[2:44:18] you have enough conviction where you
[2:44:20] wouldn't sin
[2:44:21] outwardly and look at evil things while
[2:44:24] other people around you most of us would
[2:44:26] have that maybe that level of character
[2:44:28] maybe that level of
[2:44:31] conviction and I'm not going to ask
[2:44:33] anyone to raise their hand today because
[2:44:34] I realize this is probably something
[2:44:36] everybody struggles
[2:44:38] with but in your heart if you know
[2:44:41] you're struggling with this say in your
[2:44:43] heart say Lord I need your help
[2:44:47] today in your heart say Lord
[2:44:50] Jesus I'm tormented by what I see and
[2:44:55] here and I've opened my eyes and I've
[2:44:58] looked at Wicked things I should not
[2:45:00] look at whether it's news lustful
[2:45:03] things romantic relationships as we said
