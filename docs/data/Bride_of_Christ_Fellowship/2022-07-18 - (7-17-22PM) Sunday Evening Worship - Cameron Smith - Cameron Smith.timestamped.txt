[0:00] and uh
[0:01] you know a lot of times you said
[0:04] just to trust the lord and
[0:06] always trust that you're blessed with
[0:08] this morning just realizing the
[0:09] positional placement
[0:11] god's trying to do in your life and
[0:14] this evening we'll we'll just bring
[0:15] another thought i've been ministering
[0:17] this uh recently at the church uh so
[0:19] greetings from deploying ohio i forgot
[0:21] to do this morning we'll do it tonight
[0:22] and uh
[0:24] anyway we
[0:26] we see
[0:28] that we might not be able to hook up
[0:30] here
[0:31] and i'm gonna need to hook up so i might
[0:32] have to get my
[0:34] uh
[0:36] get my powerpoint
[0:38] maybe it's one of these hdmis maybe it's
[0:40] not
[0:42] now do you have an hdmi adapter to there
[0:44] brother
[0:46] i got excited i thought i could get by
[0:48] just using my laptop
[0:50] but sometimes
[0:53] stuff gets a little finicky
[0:56] it's not
[1:10] there it is yeah
[1:13] maybe maybe not
[1:23] you have to press on yours to project um
[1:25] let's try this
[1:30] appreciate your patience brother sister
[1:34] i got all excited thinking i wouldn't
[1:35] have to do that one extra step but you
[1:37] know you can't skip steps sometimes
[1:40] and that's uh very true with
[1:42] the word of god and
[1:44] the way the lord moves and
[1:46] i'll tell you what i can
[1:48] get something
[1:49] can you give me a second here
[1:56] how many love the lord appreciate him
[2:00] give me a moment here and we'll get
[2:02] things to move right over
[2:04] and i've done this a few times you know
[2:06] as your pastor taught me how to do all
[2:08] this stuff
[2:09] and uh
[2:11] with the lord's help we
[2:12] we realized that uh still we don't have
[2:15] much ability this is a couple minute
[2:16] process
[2:17] but
[2:19] we do
[2:20] appreciate all the lords doing in your
[2:21] lives and
[2:22] uh i heard there's a lot of birthdays
[2:24] here so we rejoice at that and uh always
[2:27] thank god for a special time yesterday
[2:29] with my son's birthday
[2:30] and uh we
[2:32] we sure love the lord and give me a
[2:34] minute like i said and we'll try to just
[2:36] ramble on and just start talking
[2:41] but uh we'll get her on there just uh
[2:42] give me a second here praise god and uh
[2:46] i don't mean to keep you standing
[2:48] um you probably could sing uh
[2:52] sing another song
[3:00] it's one of those awkward moments
[3:16] just keeping it stuck
[3:19] aren't you glad for technology
[3:21] you know the other day uh we had
[3:26] we had a second service
[3:29] at the church
[3:31] and
[3:34] and brother simon his whole technology
[3:37] had failed him and he and he handled his
[3:40] ser and it deleted his entire sermon he
[3:42] was going to do second service
[3:44] so
[3:45] i walked back there
[3:47] and he said brother i don't i don't have
[3:49] it my brother it's five minutes till we
[3:51] start
[3:53] i learned the definition scripturally of
[3:56] instant in season
[3:58] and uh brother jesse i think he listened
[4:00] to that just so i ended up just running
[4:01] up there and just doing a bible study on
[4:03] the former ladder rain yes that was good
[4:05] before when i did that the atmosphere
[4:07] was uh just phenomenal as far as i felt
[4:10] anointed but because i wasn't fully
[4:11] prepared at the time
[4:13] seemed like it was a little bit
[4:15] challenging for me
[4:17] but everybody said they were blessed
[4:18] your pastor said praise the lord when he
[4:20] got a hold of that so amen we rejoice in
[4:24] these things
[4:25] so now let's try this again we will
[4:28] overcome and we'll overcome
[4:32] yeah there we go
[4:37] the scripture says with your patience
[4:39] possess ye your sins
[4:42] so you've had a really good move of that
[4:43] tonight so god be praised and let's open
[4:46] up our bibles to a few places here
[4:48] um i'm going to try to go through uh
[4:51] four services and one i will skip a lot
[4:53] but i want to hit some highlights for
[4:54] you amen and uh i trust this will be a
[4:56] blessing to you uh one thing i find is
[4:59] that this this bible just keeps on
[5:01] opening and vindicating and proving uh
[5:03] that the message that god sent through
[5:05] william branham was 100 correct amen so
[5:10] uh
[5:12] i know you're going to have to fight for
[5:14] a few amens tonight
[5:16] you have to fight through for that
[5:17] because the devil will fight you with
[5:18] tired fatigue and and uh
[5:20] and whatever you ate for dinner there
[5:22] everybody looked like they had lovely
[5:23] food and uh not just lovely but
[5:25] beautiful food
[5:26] and uh that's so nice to see um here
[5:30] if we can we'll read second samuel 7
[5:33] verse 1. it says it came to pass when
[5:35] the king sat in this house and the lord
[5:37] had given him rest round about from all
[5:41] his enemies
[5:44] but the king said unto nathan the
[5:46] prophet
[5:47] see now
[5:49] i dwell in a house of cedar
[5:53] but the ark of god dwelleth
[5:56] within curtains so notice what david is
[5:58] he is concerned about the ark amen
[6:02] not trying to make a building not trying
[6:04] to make this of that he's concerned
[6:07] about the ark and what is the art the
[6:09] word
[6:10] okay yes and nathan said to the king go
[6:12] do all that is in thine heart for the
[6:14] lord is with thee
[6:16] and it came to pass that night that the
[6:18] word of the lord came unto nathan
[6:22] saying go and tell
[6:24] my servant david
[6:26] thus saith the lord shalt thou build me
[6:29] in house for me to dwell in all right
[6:32] one more passage
[6:35] first chronicles 22 verse 7 and we'll
[6:37] pray let you have your seats
[6:38] and uh we'll just start letting the lord
[6:41] have his way amen let me know you're
[6:43] going to receive something from the lord
[6:44] tonight amen amen
[6:46] one thing about uh the scripture we love
[6:48] to eat the book
[6:49] that's right we get strength from that
[6:52] uh we get confidence and that we're
[6:54] believing the truth through that and
[6:56] what our faith rises when you hear that
[6:58] all right
[6:59] chronicles 22 7
[7:01] and david said to solomon
[7:03] my son as for me it was in my mind
[7:06] to build and house unto the name
[7:10] of the lord my god you want to build a
[7:12] house to the name
[7:14] of the lord is god okay
[7:16] but the word of the lord came to me
[7:18] saying thou has shed blood abundantly
[7:21] and has made great wars thou shalt not
[7:24] build and house under my name
[7:26] because thou has shed much blood upon
[7:29] the earth in my sight
[7:31] behold a son shall be born to thee
[7:33] who shall be a man of rest and i will
[7:35] give him rest from all his enemies round
[7:38] about for his name shall be solomon and
[7:40] i will give peace and quietness unto
[7:43] israel in his days
[7:45] he shall build a house for my name
[7:48] and he shall be my son
[7:50] and i will be his father and i will
[7:52] establish the throne of his kingdom
[7:54] over israel
[7:56] forever i just went through a big giant
[7:58] tight and i'm going to go a whole
[8:00] different type
[8:02] because we understand that david was a
[8:04] type of christ
[8:06] david had to shed the blood
[8:08] but he was not to build the house okay
[8:12] right so he's a perfect type of christ
[8:15] he had to what the
[8:17] the scripture says that he put all the
[8:18] enemies under his feet david did
[8:21] so that the man of rest
[8:23] could come forth
[8:25] which was the holy ghost because he said
[8:27] well the holy ghost is unrest
[8:29] and solomon is a type of the rest okay
[8:31] that's a whole that's that's old
[8:33] testament first church age right there
[8:35] i'm sure your pastor will go through it
[8:36] one of these days it's a beautiful thing
[8:38] so let's bow our heads forward to prayer
[8:39] i'll let you have your seats or let you
[8:41] remain to stand if you'd like to join me
[8:45] at attention
[8:46] bless by our hands lord jesus we sure
[8:48] love you we appreciate all the love and
[8:50] mercy that you have for us
[8:54] trying to figure out which way to go
[8:56] this night uh for you lord and we're
[8:58] just asking oh god as this is the
[9:00] direction we uh we've come now lord that
[9:02] you just bless it be with it allow to
[9:04] build strength
[9:05] and revelation and faith to the believer
[9:08] to the church tonight oh god lord uh
[9:10] this is an army that's right before you
[9:12] right now
[9:14] and lord we understand we're not
[9:16] supposed to be faint in this hour
[9:18] but oh god uh even as the scripture says
[9:21] is that in the old testament the priests
[9:23] would get before the people before they
[9:26] were sent out to war
[9:28] and say that god would give them a
[9:31] victory he would say the word of victory
[9:34] to them that's all that would have to
[9:36] happen the priests would give them the
[9:38] word and they would go out and fight for
[9:40] victory oh god we're asking tonight as
[9:43] we once again approach this word
[9:45] may there be a blessing that will come
[9:47] upon the people god they'll have
[9:49] strength to fight another day to fight
[9:51] to the next service to fight oh god
[9:53] until thy thy close coming lord yes
[9:56] we're just believing uh we thank you for
[9:58] this word we thank you that you're gonna
[10:00] preach it lord and we ask of god that
[10:02] revelation would be in our midst we
[10:03] receive it yes because there's one thing
[10:05] satan cannot fight this revelation
[10:09] gates of hell will not prevail against
[10:11] it and in this building there is a group
[10:13] that the gates of hell shall not prevail
[10:17] maybe so we speak in faith
[10:19] in the precious holy name of jesus
[10:21] christ the church says together amen
[10:25] once again we're blessed we love our
[10:27] brother we love you all church
[10:29] you're a beautiful people i love it when
[10:31] when god brings ghana over here and i
[10:32] get to see brother william i just
[10:34] rejoice have a wonderful time
[10:35] fellowshipping and uh and the rest of
[10:38] you we sure love and appreciate as well
[10:40] and uh we got laborers in the harvest
[10:42] and the apple harvest we got we got you
[10:43] name it it's here so uh and i'll tell
[10:46] you what i sit back there and i hear the
[10:48] voices worshiping god and i feel like
[10:50] i'm i feel like i'm in a heavenly place
[10:52] and then so i appreciate all those
[10:53] voices we hear amen
[10:55] but yet tonight we want to work with
[10:56] this idea we will not be able to do a
[10:58] full idea but we won't do an idea
[11:00] but we want to work tonight with
[11:02] the transition uh from tabernacle to
[11:06] temple all right
[11:08] so just get your spiritual like brother
[11:10] man say get your spiritual thinking caps
[11:12] on and uh let's see what we can do here
[11:15] to enjoy the word of god and find the
[11:17] word of god come to life for us amen
[11:19] we began to work here uh showing that
[11:22] god uh he would allow david to come by
[11:26] david as i spoke on zion last time i was
[11:30] here david would be the one to finish
[11:33] the battle in order to israel would be
[11:37] established in jerusalem or the city of
[11:39] peace amen and uh david was a perfect
[11:42] type of christ and uh david as our
[11:45] opening scripture showed he wanted to
[11:48] build the house of god amen now notice
[11:51] what he was wanting to do
[11:54] david was wanting and i'm going to keep
[11:56] saying this he was wanting to get the
[11:59] art from a temporary house and he was
[12:02] wanting to get it into a permanent place
[12:04] amen he said what he could look at
[12:06] himself he had a permanent house he
[12:08] could dwell in it was beautiful
[12:10] magnificent it was great but when he
[12:13] looked at the word he wanted the word to
[12:16] have a greater place that he had amen
[12:19] hallelujah and so will any christian
[12:21] when you see what god has done for you
[12:24] you want the word to have preeminence
[12:26] amen you are the word to what because ye
[12:30] are the temple of the living god
[12:32] and the word within you the bible says
[12:35] that the word is mighty even in my house
[12:38] amen hallelujah so you can speak that
[12:41] word yes you can believe that word and
[12:44] what the ark or the very soul of god
[12:47] wants to live in you amen amen
[12:49] amen amen but tonight we want to take
[12:52] this direction as the lord has given us
[12:55] we believe
[12:56] that we want to start by working with
[12:59] the transition from the tabernacle to
[13:02] the temple yes now notice here
[13:05] in exodus 25 verse 8
[13:08] it says and let them make me a sanctuary
[13:11] here on mount sinai after they left
[13:13] egypt let them make me a sanctuary now
[13:16] notice why
[13:17] he wanted to give them a tabernacle
[13:21] that i may dwell among them amen
[13:27] god wanted a house
[13:30] or a place
[13:31] that he could dwell amongst his people
[13:35] hallelujah hallelujah that they could
[13:38] come and worship
[13:40] come receive him hallelujah and notice
[13:44] according to all that issue thee
[13:47] after the pattern of the tabernacle and
[13:50] the pattern of all the instruments
[13:52] thereof even so shall he make it so the
[13:56] tabernacle did not come by chance it
[13:58] didn't come from a man's mind but
[14:00] actually god said he would give the
[14:03] pattern and make it exactly like i give
[14:07] it to you all right and what it was god
[14:11] was showing man that he wanted to dwell
[14:15] among them all right all right now let's
[14:18] begin here uh right here in exodus 19
[14:22] i'm going to be quick with this all
[14:23] right but notice it says in the third
[14:25] month when the children of israel were
[14:27] gone forth out of the land of egypt the
[14:30] same day came they into the wilderness
[14:33] of
[14:34] sinai in the third month now they're
[14:37] moving to mount sinai yes
[14:40] for they were departed from freedom and
[14:42] were come to the desert of sinai had
[14:43] pitched in the wilderness and there
[14:45] israel camped before the mount
[14:48] they were coming
[14:50] to mount sinai
[14:52] to meet god we see by exodus 19 right
[14:56] yes and notice now
[14:59] we see that there god actually gave them
[15:02] the opportunity
[15:04] to watch to come and meet him at mount
[15:07] sinai we still have pictures now oh how
[15:10] can man not believe in jesus christ amen
[15:13] when you can look and see mount sinai
[15:15] still charred at the top formal
[15:18] a living god connect with his people
[15:20] amen amen hallelujah i don't know if you
[15:23] can see it but a living god wants to
[15:25] come down and meet with you now amen
[15:29] and the more that you get the hunger for
[15:31] god to come the more he'll show himself
[15:33] amen
[15:34] hallelujah that's right because what his
[15:36] whole idea was to dwell among you to
[15:38] begin with amen amen
[15:41] now notice this idea very quickly here
[15:44] so in mount sinai israel chose law
[15:48] which was of course god's plan to show
[15:51] himself to his people god wanted to go
[15:53] that way
[15:54] it was his will for it to go that way
[15:56] even though he gave them a choice right
[15:58] right i mean the perfect way would have
[16:00] been to go this way but what would we
[16:02] miss if it didn't go that way you see
[16:04] how it's all a perfect move of the word
[16:06] of god amen and failure there's a
[16:08] perfect move god is trying to do through
[16:10] you amen amen hallelujah you see the
[16:14] israel could look very easy and say uh
[16:16] we might will just go to hell they can
[16:18] do it because they backslid on god every
[16:21] single time amen
[16:23] but god long suffering to show mercy he
[16:26] always came back to them amen
[16:30] and he said he would walk he would once
[16:32] again cure his people at the end time
[16:36] right
[16:37] he said he would draw them again but he
[16:40] won't do it until he's done with you
[16:42] hallelujah
[16:43] [Applause]
[16:45] now watch this so here
[16:47] we're going to begin talking about the
[16:49] tabernacle
[16:51] in exodus 40 17 it says and it came to
[16:54] pass in the first month
[16:56] in the second year on the first day of
[16:57] the month that the tabernacle was reared
[17:00] up
[17:02] in the third month
[17:04] was the idea
[17:07] of the tabernacle given to moses in the
[17:11] mount
[17:12] and yet
[17:13] in the first month of the next year the
[17:16] tabernacle was reared up
[17:18] yes
[17:20] we see
[17:21] there it was perfectly
[17:23] nine months from the conception
[17:27] of the tabernacle in the mine
[17:30] to bring it forth amen where it could be
[17:33] a tabernacle
[17:35] praise god hallelujah now i'm gonna get
[17:38] i'm gonna show you a few things here
[17:39] this might be a little bit it's gonna be
[17:40] something all right but notice so it
[17:42] took nine months from conception to the
[17:46] birth of that tabernacle that's right
[17:48] good all right
[17:50] now notice
[17:51] the idea
[17:53] is that it was a three
[17:55] uh had three different spots his soul
[17:58] spirit body god made it so that that
[18:02] tabernacle would be a representation
[18:05] that man would draw to that tabernacle
[18:08] to worship it amen amen amen
[18:11] hallelujah but remember the idea of that
[18:14] tabernacle was what it was given to get
[18:17] them from egypt to the promised land
[18:21] yes
[18:24] just like
[18:25] jesus christ
[18:27] the tabernacle was always a reference to
[18:30] one
[18:32] you had one word one ark
[18:35] you had one table of incense you had one
[18:38] table of shoebread you had one laver you
[18:40] had one menorah you had oh you had one
[18:44] uh uh what's that the altar of incense
[18:47] you had all those things everything was
[18:49] won yes
[18:51] amen
[18:52] hallelujah
[18:54] now watch this
[18:57] because as you see the tabernacle reared
[19:00] for a purpose
[19:02] the tabernacle was none other than
[19:05] showing jesus christ on his journey
[19:09] amen
[19:12] the bible says in john 1 10
[19:15] he was in the world and the world was
[19:17] made by him
[19:19] and the world knew him not
[19:21] he came unto his own and his own
[19:25] received him not
[19:27] i'm laying a foundation for you okay
[19:30] so notice
[19:32] jesus christ came to his own
[19:36] but his own received him not yeah right
[19:39] they didn't want him
[19:41] but as many as received him to them gave
[19:45] he power to become the sons of god amen
[19:48] even to them that believe on his name
[19:52] glory
[19:54] which were born not of blood
[19:58] nor the will of flesh
[20:00] nor of the will of man
[20:02] but of god that tells you right there
[20:06] that you are not here by chance
[20:09] [Applause]
[20:11] god might have let you fall in failure
[20:13] but it's not by chance amen
[20:16] he's going to rear a victory for you
[20:19] amen
[20:20] hallelujah amen but now notice this idea
[20:24] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[20:26] among us and we beheld his glory the
[20:29] glory of the only begotten of the father
[20:32] full of grace and truth
[20:35] the tabernacle was the manifestation of
[20:38] jesus christ right right amen i'm going
[20:41] to show you this in just a little bit
[20:42] just hold on glory it was jesus christ
[20:45] remember the tabernacle was to take them
[20:49] to the promised land
[20:52] the promised land was a type of the holy
[20:54] ghost
[20:55] right that's right so
[20:57] jesus christ within the tabernacle
[21:00] that's why you see him seated in the
[21:02] whole thing because as the tabernacle
[21:04] was being reared up brought down
[21:07] and put back up and what god would send
[21:09] the pillar a fire by night and a cloud
[21:11] by day to lead them all the way right
[21:14] yeah he showed what he would be to his
[21:16] church in the wilderness amen and
[21:19] remember in john 6 they said they said
[21:22] oh oh he started talking about the manna
[21:24] and he said i am that bread of life that
[21:27] came down right yes that tabernacle with
[21:31] that word or that word that ark was to
[21:34] get them to a permanent place
[21:37] amen that's why jesus said he said it is
[21:41] expedient that i go away
[21:44] how could that possibly be exceeding
[21:48] to be more beneficial to not have jesus
[21:50] christ god walking amongst you
[21:53] right
[21:58] how could it not be more experience not
[21:59] walking with you
[22:02] if only the greater benefit
[22:05] would be that god would walk in you
[22:07] that's right yes
[22:12] i guess i asked a question it might be a
[22:14] little bit uh awkward maybe even an
[22:16] answer
[22:17] but since would you rather have a living
[22:19] brother we didn't really let's give a
[22:21] seat for jesus here okay let's let jesus
[22:24] sit there
[22:25] would you rather would you think that
[22:27] would be more expensive to have jesus
[22:28] right there
[22:30] or would you rather have or think that
[22:33] is more expedient
[22:35] with the message that god actually gave
[22:37] you
[22:38] yes that jesus wouldn't sit here
[22:42] but jesus would take the throne of your
[22:45] hearts amen amen yes to manifest his
[22:49] will to be done inside of you amen
[22:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[22:55] so notice
[22:57] that tabernacle brought them into the
[23:00] wilderness through the wilderness now if
[23:02] you get in the old testament you look up
[23:04] that word willingness you'll actually
[23:06] see that it actually means teaching as
[23:07] well one of the sub the sub definitions
[23:09] is teaching
[23:11] the wilderness was the teaching
[23:14] right to bring them to the promised land
[23:17] that's why scripturally you can see
[23:20] that the four gospels guard the book of
[23:23] acts
[23:24] amen and everything you see from the
[23:27] book of acts it can be proven by those
[23:30] gospels that's right the gospels were
[23:33] the
[23:34] throne guards to the book of acts amen
[23:36] not then just the acts of the apostles
[23:38] but the acts of the holy ghost through
[23:40] the apostles amen all right amen
[23:44] hallelujah amen now i'm going to be very
[23:46] basic and very quick with this if i can
[23:49] that tabernacle was for the jew
[23:53] now i'm going to say this in a way that
[23:54] you'll see it especially when i get to
[23:56] it later here
[23:58] the jews were given the tabernacle from
[24:01] mount sinai
[24:03] well the gentiles were not involved
[24:05] right
[24:06] it was to get them there
[24:09] hallelujah yes
[24:10] the jews also built the tabernacle
[24:15] it was a jewish move
[24:17] yes
[24:19] hallelujah
[24:21] just like we read he came to his own
[24:24] and they received him not
[24:26] right
[24:28] hallelujah amen
[24:30] so they would have to be
[24:33] a manifestation
[24:35] to make the clear word of god
[24:38] progress from one idea to the next
[24:43] hold on
[24:48] this was to go about to get the children
[24:50] to the main place they were supposed to
[24:52] be
[24:53] yes there you have a pillar of fire at
[24:55] night they're all encamped around it
[24:58] just like jesus christ he went about
[25:00] doing good they would flock him
[25:03] hallelujah and what he was doing is he
[25:06] was doing the good remember as they were
[25:09] going through the wilderness their
[25:10] clothes didn't even wax hold they didn't
[25:12] get sick
[25:13] as long as they stayed with that
[25:16] tabernacle and ordering them they were
[25:18] what just as good as almost invincible
[25:22] right outside of the fathers that had to
[25:24] die off and mixed multitude
[25:26] hallelujah
[25:28] just as jesus christ went about doing
[25:31] good
[25:32] yes he was he lived 30 years
[25:36] in a life
[25:37] but the end the ministry was to get the
[25:40] people to something all right yes
[25:44] we have here
[25:46] the moving about
[25:48] of the worship of god
[25:50] but we've seen in our opening scriptures
[25:53] that god was actually trying to get it
[25:57] to a permanent spot
[25:59] yes david in his flesh seeing what it
[26:02] was coming to and was trying to fulfill
[26:05] that
[26:06] right
[26:07] but his position
[26:10] typically
[26:11] was not to actually build the temple
[26:15] it was actually to what fight the
[26:18] battles
[26:19] finish the battles shed the blood and
[26:23] let the let solomon his son bring on the
[26:27] temple
[26:28] amen
[26:29] so we have here from a wilderness
[26:32] the traveling on
[26:34] to now a permanent
[26:36] establishment
[26:38] that god would do through the temple
[26:40] right like so i'm trying to do this
[26:42] through through four sermons it might be
[26:44] a little bit difficult but we're going
[26:45] to try to do it all right it says acts
[26:47] of holy spirit now here's my idea of it
[26:48] brother
[26:50] that temple there represented the temple
[26:52] spiritual the temple we're now in
[26:56] they come into the temple for their
[26:58] blessings
[26:59] we are baptized into the temple of god
[27:05] you know the prophet said he said he
[27:06] said that jesus was that tabernacle
[27:09] right amen they come into the temple for
[27:11] the blessing we are baptized into the
[27:13] temple of god into the body of god into
[27:15] the body of jesus christ and we're in
[27:17] christ by holy spirit baptism first
[27:20] corinthians 12 and there is now
[27:22] therefore no condemnation to them in
[27:25] christ jesus romans 8 1 that walk not
[27:28] after the flesh but after the spirit
[27:30] they desire spiritual things amen amen
[27:36] we're talking about
[27:38] tabernacle
[27:40] to a temple manifestation amen
[27:42] identifying just a little bit here so
[27:44] just hold on
[27:45] watch us
[27:47] he's saying
[27:49] that the temple was the spiritual
[27:50] movement of god for you
[27:54] watch what he says they desire spiritual
[27:56] things they don't care about the fleshly
[27:59] things
[28:00] my flesh says i'm too tired
[28:04] anybody's flesh saying that tonight
[28:06] your flesh will tell you that sure sure
[28:09] your flesh will tell you oh god that
[28:11] brother can't hit the 30 minutes uh
[28:13] streak here
[28:15] right
[28:16] but look your flesh says i'm too tired
[28:19] but your spirit says you're not i'm your
[28:22] boss
[28:23] follow me
[28:25] amen
[28:26] [Applause]
[28:29] glory so we're not looking at a
[28:30] situation where um
[28:33] where the spirit is reeling but the
[28:35] flesh is weak we have now moved to a
[28:38] greater manifestation
[28:40] when we can actually put the flesh under
[28:42] our feet
[28:50] get up and worship god amen that's what
[28:53] these things do amen
[28:55] hallelujah
[28:57] because ultimately it's not it's not
[28:59] it's not me saying sister naomi oh
[29:00] you're you're flesh ain't tired get up
[29:03] you know your flesh
[29:05] i'll wash your flesh around
[29:08] but it's an individual revelation
[29:11] you realize that this is temporal
[29:15] and what is eternal is inside of you
[29:17] amen amen
[29:20] christ or paul would say by the spirit
[29:22] of christ ye are the temple of the
[29:26] living god amen amen amen the temple is
[29:29] a spiritual move
[29:31] done to a spiritual people accepting it
[29:33] that's right now watch us
[29:35] i want you to see this
[29:37] this is this is the beginning of our
[29:39] we're going to be moving here first
[29:40] chronicles 22 verse 5 and david said
[29:44] solomon my son
[29:46] is young
[29:48] and tender
[29:49] and the house that is to be builded for
[29:52] the lord
[29:54] must be exceeding
[29:57] magnificable
[29:59] i love that
[30:00] put that together
[30:01] exceeding magnifical
[30:04] hallelujah
[30:06] closely
[30:08] amen that sounds pretty good
[30:10] hallelujah but notice from a transition
[30:13] from the tabernacle to the temple it had
[30:17] to be exceeding magnificent magnifical
[30:20] from what the tabernacle was amen
[30:24] it was a greater manifestation
[30:27] of jesus christ
[30:31] hallelujah
[30:33] amen
[30:34] notice
[30:35] it was to be watched of fame
[30:39] and the glory
[30:41] throughout all the countries
[30:45] notice the temple
[30:46] was not to just be something moving them
[30:50] through the wilderness
[30:52] yes
[30:54] it played its parts
[30:56] in jericho they already heard about it
[30:58] they're already scared about it all
[31:00] right brother good but now god was
[31:02] wanting a temple to do that
[31:05] yes
[31:08] throughout all the countries i will
[31:09] therefore now make preparation for it
[31:13] so david prepared abundantly before his
[31:16] death
[31:18] hallelujah
[31:19] just as jesus christ did everything on
[31:22] the spiritual realm and natural realm
[31:24] that needed to be conquered
[31:27] amen he was the all in all this jesus
[31:31] christ amen
[31:33] i mean there's not one thing that he
[31:35] left untouched even so much of the fact
[31:38] is that he's able to secure them that
[31:41] are tempted because he and always
[31:43] likewise was tempted as you are
[31:47] yes
[31:48] he is able to be a comfort to you
[31:52] because he cares for you amen amen amen
[31:57] hallelujah hallelujah we're getting
[31:59] ready to make a turn here
[32:00] i want you to see this because remember
[32:02] jesus said it'd be expedient
[32:04] right it was good that he goes away so
[32:06] the next manifestation remember he said
[32:08] he said i will not leave you comfortless
[32:11] i will come to you
[32:17] it was something god was trying to do
[32:22] saying chronicles 510
[32:25] here it is i'm going to jump up and jump
[32:26] back but it said in second chronicles 5
[32:29] 10 there was nothing in the ark say two
[32:33] tables which moses put therein at
[32:36] when the lord made a covenant with the
[32:37] children of israel when they came out of
[32:40] egypt and it came to pass when the
[32:42] priests were come out of the holy place
[32:44] for all the priests that were present
[32:46] were sanctified and did not then await
[32:49] by course
[32:52] also the levites which were the singers
[32:55] all of them of a asaph haman a judith
[32:58] with their sons and their brother being
[33:00] raiden white linen having symbols and
[33:02] sultries and hearts stood the east and
[33:04] the altar and with them notice it's
[33:06] capitalized
[33:07] 120 priests sounding with trumpets amen
[33:15] in dedication of lee was 59 if i
[33:17] remember right
[33:18] brother branham said that there
[33:20] it was in that dedication message he
[33:23] said there was a hundred and twenty that
[33:25] were trumpeting out
[33:28] because what it does
[33:31] is it puts the scripture in line
[33:34] that the number of those names together
[33:36] were about 120
[33:40] so god
[33:42] and through our prophet would tell us i
[33:43] believe it's in 54 where he said that
[33:46] solomon's day was a type of the holy
[33:49] ghost falling on the church
[33:52] because notice what happened it came to
[33:55] pass as a trumpeter series where as one
[33:58] they were in one place and one accord
[34:02] that's right to make one sound to be
[34:05] heard
[34:06] in praising and thanking the lord and
[34:08] when they lifted up their voice with the
[34:10] trumpets and symbols and instruments of
[34:11] music and praise the lord saying for he
[34:14] is good for his mercy endures forever
[34:16] that then the house was filled with a
[34:19] cloud even the house of the lord amen
[34:22] so that the priest could not stand to
[34:25] minister by reason of the cloud for the
[34:28] glory of the lord had filled the house
[34:30] of god amen now notice the tithe because
[34:34] it is the same that's why god left the
[34:36] types in there but in the upper room
[34:39] that's what it was brother brown said it
[34:41] was a unifying time amen he said any
[34:44] time when the children of god get to a
[34:46] place like they were it'll bring the
[34:48] sound of a rushing mighty wind amen amen
[34:51] amen but look at this
[34:54] a lot of times we'll just leave that
[34:56] oh that's church look at that what
[34:58] happened
[34:59] but did you know that that was actually
[35:00] the start of what god was trying to do
[35:03] and he left it in the time
[35:06] that was it was a type
[35:08] of the upper room
[35:09] but it gave us the characteristics of
[35:12] what made it happen yes amen what are
[35:15] you saying
[35:17] what i'm saying is
[35:18] you got to tell your flesh i'm your boss
[35:21] [Music]
[35:22] because the types give us a greater
[35:25] picture of when it actually come forth
[35:27] we don't i mean it's written on paper
[35:29] there's only so much we have so god
[35:31] leaves the time so that you can see
[35:33] that what they were in one place in one
[35:36] a car but notice
[35:38] they were worshiping god
[35:41] they were thanking god
[35:43] they were lifting up their voice
[35:47] to such a place that the shekinah glory
[35:51] filled that house amen
[35:55] hallelujah you want to get there god
[35:57] shows us how to do it
[35:59] that's why they demonize us so much
[36:01] oh they're pentecostals they're not even
[36:03] in the message
[36:05] let them call you what you want if you
[36:07] can get that cloud down
[36:09] hallelujah it shows that god is at peace
[36:12] with what you're doing amen he's pleased
[36:15] with it he likes it
[36:17] and anytime you aim in that word any
[36:19] time you praise the lord with your heart
[36:22] that is a sign that god is what he's
[36:29] hallelujah because ultimately this
[36:31] should be our experience
[36:33] hallelujah they got persecuted after the
[36:35] gate of beautiful the scripture says
[36:36] they went and prayed in that one place
[36:38] they started they started praying to god
[36:40] worshiping god loving god and what the
[36:43] holy ghost shook that place
[36:45] you know your prophet said he said they
[36:46] needed that it was three or four days
[36:48] after the upper room
[36:50] that's right
[36:51] three or four days
[36:53] you see
[36:54] we should be going from pouring out
[36:57] to pouring out
[36:58] man hallelujah amen
[37:01] hallelujah so there you're 120.
[37:04] now let's begin to look at this here
[37:07] our transition continue in first kings 6
[37:11] 38
[37:12] it says in the 11th year in the month of
[37:14] bull which is the eighth month
[37:17] was the house finished throughout all
[37:20] the parts thereof
[37:22] and according to all the fashion of it
[37:25] so was he seven years in building
[37:30] hallelujah that's right
[37:32] we see the tabernacle was a nine
[37:34] nine-month conception birth
[37:37] and then it lived
[37:39] but when god did the temple
[37:42] it was to be manifested for seven years
[37:46] seven church ages
[37:48] one two three four five six seven
[37:53] it was to be a move over seven church
[37:56] ages
[37:57] now this is gonna get really pretty here
[37:58] in a second that's pretty to me right
[38:00] there how you got a seven up in there
[38:02] yep you got upper room and seven church
[38:04] changes
[38:06] hallelujah remember where this church is
[38:09] going is not just back
[38:12] to the book of acts
[38:15] you're going all the way through to our
[38:17] rapture amen amen to the full perfection
[38:20] right where god bless ephesus remember
[38:22] at least uh aimed at but relaxed
[38:25] you're going from being relaxed to fully
[38:28] aimed at it fully adapted fully
[38:30] positionally
[38:35] [Music]
[38:36] amen
[38:37] so now that's seven
[38:39] we also have seven church changes
[38:42] now watch this
[38:45] in mark 11 15 christ saying here it says
[38:48] and they came to jerusalem and jesus
[38:50] went to the temple began to cast out
[38:52] them that sold and bought in the temple
[38:54] and overthrew the tables of of the money
[38:57] changers and the seats of them that sold
[38:58] doves and would not suffer that any man
[39:01] should carry any vessel through the
[39:02] temple
[39:03] and he taught saying unto them is it not
[39:06] written
[39:08] my house
[39:10] shall be called of all nations
[39:13] the house of prayer
[39:15] but ye have made it again of phoenix
[39:18] he said what that the temple
[39:22] was to be a house of prayer of all
[39:24] nations
[39:27] now watch
[39:28] so now the temple is beginning to pick
[39:31] up
[39:32] a characteristic of its type
[39:34] that jesus christ even himself said that
[39:37] it was a house of prayer for all nations
[39:40] now that's where it'll make a saint want
[39:42] to rejoice because you are not part of
[39:45] that jewish heritage amen yes yes
[39:49] now watch
[39:50] here it is solomon dedicating the temple
[39:55] he says moreover concerning a stranger
[40:01] he's talking about the stranger what's a
[40:02] stranger a gentile
[40:04] yes that's a stranger
[40:07] that is not of thy people israel
[40:11] but cometh out
[40:13] of a far country
[40:16] for thy name's sake
[40:18] the temple was made to troll them from
[40:22] all over the place amen
[40:25] to that temple
[40:28] for they shall hear of thy great name
[40:30] and of thy strong hand
[40:32] and are thy stretched out all
[40:35] when he shall come and pray towards this
[40:37] house
[40:39] now when you see the time you see all
[40:41] through his his dedication he's saying
[40:44] if they pray to this place
[40:47] the place of that temple amen
[40:50] it was a type of the baptism of the holy
[40:52] ghost
[40:54] that's why in
[40:56] revelations 2 in the ephesians church
[40:58] age he says he says repent and do the
[41:00] first works
[41:02] look hallelujah if you ain't got a first
[41:04] love then go back to when you knew he
[41:07] was your first love in him what were you
[41:09] doing there you were crying out right
[41:11] there fill me with your holy ghost
[41:14] you don't have to live in a backswing
[41:16] conditioning
[41:18] below
[41:19] [Applause]
[41:24] where christ himself came and filled
[41:26] that temple where the ark walks
[41:29] notice what it was
[41:30] god did not make a new art for that
[41:33] temple
[41:34] he transferred the original ark
[41:37] to the temple it was the same word
[41:40] yeah the whole way through amen
[41:45] i'll tell you what when it comes to the
[41:48] next temple being built
[41:50] it won't be a different arc it'll be the
[41:52] same arc that's right crazy because
[41:55] god's tithe is he said i am the lord and
[41:58] i change not amen
[42:07] [Applause]
[42:11] so now
[42:12] solomon's crying out in his dedication
[42:15] that the strangers are going to be drawn
[42:18] to this temple amen
[42:19] they're going to hear about this
[42:21] manifestation of the temple
[42:23] they're going to hear about 120
[42:27] falling under the holy ghost
[42:29] they're gonna hear about it and they're
[42:31] going to be drawn to it amen see the
[42:34] jews didn't even figure that out that's
[42:36] why acts 10 was such a
[42:38] a shocking mind blow to them
[42:41] yes because the scripture says that they
[42:43] were in all that god let the holy ghost
[42:45] fall on the gentiles like he did then
[42:47] that's right amen
[42:49] hallelujah but they all they had to do
[42:51] was hear the same wire that's right yeah
[42:54] the glory see the manifestation and they
[42:56] received and god filled them they
[42:58] prophesied spoke of tongues
[43:00] yes yes you know he still does the same
[43:02] thing amen hallelujah yes
[43:06] so he says
[43:08] for they shall hear thy great name
[43:11] and of thy strong hand
[43:12] and of thy stretched out arm
[43:15] when he shall come and pray towards
[43:18] this house
[43:19] yes
[43:21] hear thou in heaven
[43:23] thy dwelling place and do according
[43:28] to all the strange all that the stranger
[43:30] calleth to thee for
[43:33] you mean
[43:34] solomon is so caught in the inspiration
[43:37] that he's crying out exactly what would
[43:40] happen as the gentiles receive this yes
[43:45] they'll hear about the god of israel
[43:48] and they'll come and accept it
[43:50] hallelujah
[43:55] and do according to all that the
[43:56] stranger calls to thee for that all
[43:59] people of the earth may know thy name to
[44:02] fear thee as do thy people israel and
[44:06] that they may know that this house which
[44:08] i have built and built it is called by
[44:11] thy name
[44:13] amen
[44:15] the baptism of the holy ghost was to
[44:17] magnify the name of jesus christ
[44:20] that's
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:35] on god for that he will bring it to you
[44:38] amen amen
[44:39] hallelujah
[44:42] because god wanted man
[44:45] to fall in love with his glory because
[44:46] look
[44:49] he he said that god would do to the
[44:51] stranger just like he would to a jew
[44:53] that's right
[44:57] now
[44:58] that is phenomenal
[45:00] because this is a time when the jew
[45:02] gentiles were not accepted that's right
[45:05] that's right
[45:06] that's why you're here right now that's
[45:09] right because god blinded israel when
[45:11] they rejected him and he went to the
[45:14] gentiles till the fullness of the
[45:17] gentiles come in that's right
[45:19] which is the rapture of the church right
[45:20] that's right right there the phone is
[45:22] the jedi it's almost here get in get
[45:24] along yes sir yes for that holy ghost
[45:27] cry out to this place and god will
[45:30] answer you remember
[45:33] when he said that
[45:34] god showed it in natural type i'm going
[45:37] to trump here god showed it in natural
[45:39] time that he would answer that
[45:41] remember jonah caught in the belly of
[45:44] the whale
[45:46] jonah caught the belly of whale he was
[45:48] what he was caught in death in the in
[45:51] this way on the bottom of the ocean
[45:52] that's right
[45:53] there he was the scripture says that he
[45:56] turned himself to the temple and cried
[45:59] out to god for mercy yes
[46:02] amen he prayed towards that place
[46:07] the natural is a type of the spiritual
[46:10] he prayed towards that place and what in
[46:12] a few days god spit him up on nineveh
[46:14] right
[46:16] and he finished the plan amen yes
[46:18] hezekiah the prophet came to isaiah came
[46:21] to him said you're a dead man amen make
[46:23] your house ready that's right
[46:25] the scripture says that isaiah turned
[46:27] himself to the wall
[46:30] amen amen
[46:32] yeah he read the commentaries it was the
[46:34] wall of the temple
[46:36] glory he returned himself and prayed to
[46:38] the wall and said lord give me 15 more
[46:41] years
[46:43] amen and god gave it to him amen
[46:47] wow beautiful if you want the holy ghost
[46:49] all you got to do is know where you come
[46:52] from
[46:57] [Applause]
[47:05] [Music]
[47:09] this temple is very open to the
[47:11] strangers
[47:13] very open
[47:17] look ephesians 2
[47:19] 19
[47:20] now therefore ye are no more
[47:22] strangers that's right
[47:25] and foreigners glory
[47:28] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[47:32] of the household of god and are built
[47:35] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[47:37] prophets jesus christ himself being the
[47:39] chief cornerstone
[47:42] in whom all the building fitly framed
[47:44] together growth unto a holy
[47:46] temple
[47:49] in the lord in whom you are also
[47:51] building together for a habitation of
[47:52] god through the spirit i said i had to
[47:54] cuddle out but i trust you'll see it
[47:56] tonight because what god's trying to do
[47:59] he's trying to manifest that temple move
[48:01] through you
[48:03] yes hallelujah oh thank god that jesus
[48:07] christ tabernacled before us in flesh
[48:09] amen yes
[48:11] but the ultimate thing that was coming
[48:13] was a permanent place
[48:16] where the holy ghost would fall on them
[48:19] amen and they would be able to follow
[48:22] that out to amen to the rapture of the
[48:24] church
[48:26] all right it would be just as meaningful
[48:29] in uh uh
[48:30] in 1833 as it would be in a.d 2022.
[48:36] [Applause]
[48:37] there's no scaffold building up from
[48:40] this it's the same gospel the secret
[48:44] same holy ghost and god
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:56] oh
[48:59] [Applause]
[49:06] [Music]
[49:12] [Music]
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:24] amen
[49:25] [Applause]
[49:27] watch this this is beautiful
[49:30] second chronicles 2 17.
[49:33] it says in solomon
[49:36] numbered
[49:37] all the strangers
[49:39] that were in the land of israel
[49:42] the strangers
[49:46] that's you
[49:48] that's right after the numbering where
[49:50] dave and his father had numbered them
[49:52] and they were found a hundred and fifty
[49:54] three thousand and three thousand and
[49:56] six six hundred
[49:58] watches
[50:00] and he set
[50:02] three score
[50:03] and ten thousand of them
[50:06] to be
[50:07] bearers
[50:09] of burdens
[50:14] and four score
[50:16] thousand to be hewers
[50:18] in the mountain
[50:20] and three thousand and six hundred
[50:22] overseers
[50:24] to set the people
[50:27] a work
[50:29] jumping down to our parallel first kings
[50:31] 9 22.
[50:33] but of the children of israel did
[50:35] solomon make no bonding
[50:38] but they were men of war
[50:41] his servants and his princes and his
[50:43] captains and his rulers of chariots and
[50:45] his horsemen
[50:48] all right what are you trying to say
[50:49] good game
[50:51] when god built the temple over these
[50:54] seven ages
[50:57] the vast majority of the work
[51:00] was done by gentiles
[51:04] amen amen
[51:06] yes and i love i love how king james
[51:09] explains it
[51:11] because he said that they were workers
[51:13] amen
[51:15] they were bears of burnings amen
[51:18] they could handle these gentile
[51:21] strangers in us could handle the pairing
[51:24] of bird and satan
[51:26] they hew out stones in a mountain amen
[51:31] hallelujah they were to do the work of
[51:34] the temple amen amen well what
[51:38] god let god left to israel just just do
[51:41] their thing without it right but the
[51:42] temple building was ordained to be done
[51:44] of the gentiles
[51:53] notice
[51:55] there was a little bit of work that was
[51:56] done
[51:57] by the jews and the king solomon raised
[51:59] a levee out of all israel and the levy
[52:01] was thirty thousand men and he sent them
[52:03] to level lebanon that's where they got
[52:05] the trees from
[52:06] ten thousand a month by quarters a month
[52:08] they were in lebanon two months at home
[52:10] and adanaram was over the levy
[52:13] so the jews now notice it wasn't all
[52:16] done by the gentiles
[52:18] but the vast majority of us
[52:24] all right
[52:26] so the jews were just doing a portion of
[52:29] it
[52:30] but the ultimate design to build the
[52:32] temple was to be moved by the gentiles
[52:41] i'm just going to rejoice
[52:42] [Applause]
[52:44] because the scripture says right there
[52:45] you can bear any burden
[52:48] amen
[52:49] you're here to build the temple of god
[52:52] amen
[52:52] until the capstone sets down
[52:57] you can build brilliant kindness you are
[52:59] born for you'll bear the burden if they
[53:01] reject you if they say anything nasty
[53:03] about you you can bear it and if your
[53:06] brother and sisters in pain are hurting
[53:08] you can bear that burden with them
[53:12] [Applause]
[53:14] remember christ was a healer ff bosworth
[53:17] he said
[53:18] he said in that he said many times
[53:20] people get sick and they get so weak
[53:23] he said that they can't even
[53:25] bear the burden
[53:27] he said the church would look at them
[53:30] and put them down i'm paraphrasing and
[53:32] put them down and think that they didn't
[53:34] have any faith
[53:39] he said but the church has it all wrong
[53:42] he said they were actually when they
[53:44] would see that person weak
[53:47] they would actually stand up
[53:49] and help bear the burden
[53:52] to get that same he said he said they
[53:54] would be so hard to have any faith so it
[53:57] would take the rest of the church to get
[53:59] behind that
[54:01] and why if they were in a good time
[54:03] raise their faith up amen amen bear the
[54:06] burden with them praise god hallelujah
[54:09] christ bear a cross for you amen
[54:12] that's why he said to you that you take
[54:14] up your cross and follow me
[54:17] amen amen
[54:18] he took the cross up the mount of
[54:20] calvary amen
[54:22] oh how could we not bear one another's
[54:24] burdens
[54:25] how could we not try to hew some stones
[54:27] out of the mountains because i'll tell
[54:29] you what where we're at in this age
[54:30] that's what it's like
[54:32] that's right
[54:33] you're you're up there trying to find
[54:34] all the pieces for the temple you know i
[54:36] ain't got time to go there but brother
[54:37] branham said that that those slow stones
[54:39] were taken from all over the place
[54:43] and what he ties into the scripture
[54:44] where he says ye are lively stones
[54:48] hallelujah those stones gotta come from
[54:50] somewhere somebody's got to dig them out
[54:52] amen oh god anoint the living church
[54:55] amen by the holy ghost to find those
[54:58] tools amen
[54:59] amen
[55:03] there's something ironic that god let
[55:05] the holy ghost fall on the jews
[55:07] and then very quickly within a few years
[55:09] there we see the gentiles and paul said
[55:11] i'll go no more to the to the jews
[55:15] amen
[55:16] hallelujah
[55:18] all right
[55:20] brother king
[55:21] what else is there okay
[55:25] say chronicles 3 3.
[55:27] so now these are the things wherein
[55:29] solomon was instructed for the building
[55:30] of the house of god the length bicubits
[55:33] after the first measure were three score
[55:35] uh cubits in the breath 20 humans
[55:38] all right you already read it i'm sure
[55:42] but when you look at the tabernacle
[55:45] the tabernacle was 10 cubits wide
[55:48] and then 30 cubits long
[55:52] but when god come
[55:54] lengthen went
[55:56] to build the temple
[55:58] he made it 20 cubits long wide
[56:01] and then he made it 60 cubits long
[56:04] yes
[56:06] he gave them a double portion
[56:10] amen of his spirit that's right
[56:18] this is one of the uncapped resources
[56:19] that's right in our hands that's right
[56:22] it's right in our hands now this is
[56:24] right where i left off with the church
[56:25] because this goes throughout the bible
[56:31] let me say a few things
[56:34] you know what god calls you the church
[56:37] of the firstborn
[56:38] yes
[56:39] the firstborn had a double portion
[56:43] of all that the rest of them had
[56:48] hallelujah that's you spiritually the
[56:51] firstborn
[56:53] hallelujah the blood had to be applied
[56:55] why for the elect first ball
[56:59] yes right not only that
[57:02] we see in the scripture god talks about
[57:04] the levites
[57:06] and he says that the levites would now
[57:09] be his first form too
[57:12] they would have the birth right
[57:14] now notice god himself calls it a birth
[57:18] right
[57:23] you have a right by your
[57:32] [Applause]
[57:38] don't settle for complacency
[57:42] [Applause]
[57:47] amen
[57:51] [Applause]
[57:54] i'm not going to get this into him but
[57:56] god actually multiplied numerous things
[57:58] in the temple
[57:59] to show the greater glory of what he was
[58:00] trying to produce
[58:02] but i want to go here real quick here
[58:04] let's go down the 11th verse he says
[58:06] believe me that i am the father and the
[58:07] father of me or else believe me for the
[58:08] very work state verily verily i send you
[58:11] he that believeth on me
[58:13] the works that i do shall he do also
[58:18] so you will have a single portion
[58:22] of the holy ghost
[58:24] yes
[58:26] you'll be able to do the same things
[58:28] jesus did
[58:30] with what
[58:31] a single portion i'm talking about from
[58:33] your prophet
[58:35] because your prophet identified what
[58:36] this was numerous places
[58:42] hallelujah so doing the works of jesus
[58:46] that's a single portion
[58:48] well
[58:51] but he said what
[58:52] and greater works than these shall
[58:55] he do
[58:57] because i go unto my father
[59:01] your prophet said that was a double
[59:03] portion
[59:05] the greater works were a double portion
[59:07] right amen remember my price said this
[59:09] morning but but remember brother branham
[59:12] said just do the same works until he
[59:15] brings the double portion
[59:20] now watch this
[59:22] i want you to see this double portion
[59:24] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[59:26] that will i do
[59:28] that the father may be glorified in the
[59:29] song
[59:31] whatever you ask
[59:33] says nature whatever you ask
[59:37] this beatrice whatever yours
[59:39] real man whatever you ask
[59:43] so what
[59:44] so that full glorification goes to the
[59:46] soul
[59:49] amen
[59:50] but he doesn't stop there does he
[59:52] he says it again
[59:54] if ye shall ask anything in my name i
[59:57] will do it
[1:00:02] remember in the scripture
[1:00:04] you can take it back to the songs you
[1:00:05] take all over the place but a lot of
[1:00:07] times they repeat it
[1:00:11] wait on the way down the lord i say
[1:00:12] again i say wait on the lord right right
[1:00:15] and they say it twice
[1:00:17] to show you the emphasis that they're
[1:00:19] trying to place on it
[1:00:22] god just doesn't want you to ask and
[1:00:24] receive no he really wants you to ask in
[1:00:27] his name and receive it amen
[1:00:30] hallelujah
[1:00:31] you have not because you asked amen
[1:00:35] amen he said he'd do it amen amen oh god
[1:00:40] get this get us ready for this sickness
[1:00:44] hallelujah we're closer than we've ever
[1:00:46] been yes no
[1:00:48] notice second kings 2 8
[1:00:51] said elijah took his mantle wrapped
[1:00:52] together smoked the waters there divided
[1:00:54] hither and together so that they too
[1:00:55] went over on dry ground
[1:00:57] and it came to pass when they were gone
[1:00:59] over that elijah said unto elisha
[1:01:03] ask what i shall do for thee then we
[1:01:05] just read that
[1:01:08] ask what i shall do well what did
[1:01:10] brother braham say elijah and unless you
[1:01:12] were a type of
[1:01:14] christ in the church
[1:01:16] right
[1:01:21] ask what i shall do for you before i be
[1:01:23] taken away from thee before i'll be
[1:01:25] taken away from them
[1:01:29] and elisha said i pray thee
[1:01:31] let a double portion of thy spirit be
[1:01:35] upon me
[1:01:39] notice this oh
[1:01:41] spoken word church
[1:01:44] all right
[1:01:47] elijah didn't say hey i bet you want a
[1:01:49] double portion why don't you ask for it
[1:01:55] it was already written on his heart
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:02] hallelujah now god left it in scripture
[1:02:08] so that you could see
[1:02:10] that this should be the crying out of
[1:02:12] your heart
[1:02:13] amen amen
[1:02:19] it ought to be from uh from sister
[1:02:21] lena's mouth oh god let there be a
[1:02:24] double portion come on in
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:28] remember it was god that built the holy
[1:02:32] ghost in such a way he could give you a
[1:02:34] double portion
[1:02:39] that's why it's a permanent place it's
[1:02:41] expedient it's great it's exceeding
[1:02:43] magnifical amen it is a great place
[1:02:47] [Applause]
[1:02:54] so now
[1:02:55] you don't even gotta figure it out all
[1:02:56] you gotta do is look at the word
[1:02:58] this is a revelation that's right you're
[1:03:01] the church
[1:03:02] see a lot of people say oh that's christ
[1:03:04] and brother branham
[1:03:07] good you know it's elijah
[1:03:09] it's got to be an elijah spirit
[1:03:13] well what spirit did brother branham not
[1:03:15] just elijah it was the holy ghost
[1:03:17] right
[1:03:23] so god actually sent the message to
[1:03:25] produce the same things
[1:03:29] as was done in the prophet
[1:03:31] or the angel
[1:03:32] as what he wanted to do in the church
[1:03:38] did i say something strange
[1:03:42] this is how underprivileged we are
[1:03:44] that's why everybody wants to put
[1:03:45] brother brandon on this pastor
[1:03:49] come on
[1:03:51] all right brother
[1:03:53] that's why
[1:03:54] i preach on the spiritual gifts about 12
[1:03:56] servants
[1:03:57] and what blew me away
[1:03:59] was if you all would get in one accord
[1:04:02] in such a way that the holy ghost would
[1:04:04] fall and i had spiritual gifts on you
[1:04:06] brother branham told us exactly what
[1:04:08] that would do and that's what i said in
[1:04:09] first corinthians 14 this morning that
[1:04:12] the discerning of the thoughts and tense
[1:04:13] of heart will come right from you that's
[1:04:15] right
[1:04:16] sinner come in it'd come right up on you
[1:04:19] brother branham said that
[1:04:21] he said there would be he said it
[1:04:23] wouldn't be something just general
[1:04:28] he said but the holy ghost would be
[1:04:30] specific
[1:04:32] now you go back and study do you want
[1:04:33] the notes i got it
[1:04:36] but brother branham said he said he said
[1:04:38] sister so and so uh you were you know
[1:04:41] you were prostituting yourself yesterday
[1:04:43] or something like that and and this and
[1:04:45] then that and you're from new jersey
[1:04:48] and he said
[1:04:49] that's thus saith the lord it would come
[1:04:51] from tongues and interpretations
[1:04:58] it would come from prophecy
[1:05:00] right and it would be just as specific
[1:05:03] as the prophet that's right every circle
[1:05:05] thus saith the lord thus saith the lord
[1:05:07] and the laity
[1:05:13] is anybody else's mind going
[1:05:18] because that's what the original church
[1:05:19] was
[1:05:20] and that identification was in first
[1:05:22] first corinthians 14
[1:05:24] where he said that if somebody had
[1:05:25] learned god
[1:05:27] it would call them directly out
[1:05:29] their needs their issues brother said he
[1:05:32] said it would be so specific in the
[1:05:33] church that there need be somebody that
[1:05:35] would need a healing
[1:05:36] and he said so and so you've come here
[1:05:38] from so and so spot and you have cancer
[1:05:41] thus say lord if you repent of of this
[1:05:44] addiction of smoking god will fill you
[1:05:45] with the holy ghost and heal you right
[1:05:46] now
[1:05:47] look look it up
[1:05:51] he said
[1:05:52] he talked about a court story
[1:05:55] where where he said these fanatical
[1:05:56] pentecostals uh they got in trouble
[1:05:58] because they were being loud and
[1:05:59] obnoxious and so forth with with their
[1:06:01] spiritualism
[1:06:03] and they went into the judge
[1:06:05] and they just started speaking rampantly
[1:06:07] in tongues
[1:06:09] and the judge said he said these people
[1:06:11] are lunatics lock them up
[1:06:15] ah here i am i'm on my tangent it's
[1:06:17] going this way
[1:06:20] and brother branham said he said it
[1:06:22] would have been different
[1:06:25] if they would have had it in order
[1:06:27] he said they would have said judge
[1:06:29] you did this thing last night
[1:06:33] how can you come against the elect of
[1:06:36] god with what you're calling us out for
[1:06:39] he said if they would have had it right
[1:06:41] and in order
[1:06:43] it would have turned the opposite way oh
[1:06:46] i wonder what we're getting ready to do
[1:06:50] i think a lot of times we just think oh
[1:06:52] glory to god i'm just going to sit in
[1:06:53] this chair uh holy ghost gonna follow
[1:06:55] that rain boom done
[1:06:57] i'm in heaven
[1:07:02] right right oh
[1:07:04] the american spirit
[1:07:07] it's going to be a squeeze
[1:07:10] right right yeah you know where he says
[1:07:12] physically bereft
[1:07:16] the deities are going out the door but
[1:07:18] it's got to be that way to get you into
[1:07:19] the spot god can do what he needs to do
[1:07:21] with you
[1:07:22] amen amen oh glory to god
[1:07:24] hallelujah
[1:07:31] elisha said let a double portion be on
[1:07:34] me
[1:07:35] yes amen
[1:07:37] and he said
[1:07:39] thou has asked a hard thing
[1:07:45] it's not an easy thing
[1:07:48] what you're supposed to have from christ
[1:07:51] there's only one
[1:07:54] nevertheless
[1:07:56] if thou see me when i am taken from thee
[1:08:00] it shall be so unto thee
[1:08:03] but if not it shall not be so
[1:08:07] and it came to pass they still went on
[1:08:10] and taught that behold there up here to
[1:08:11] cherry to fire horses of fire and parted
[1:08:13] them both asundered and elijah went up
[1:08:16] by a whirlwind into heaven
[1:08:23] do you realize
[1:08:24] that god showed us how to get a double
[1:08:25] portion too
[1:08:29] because when elijah went up the mantle
[1:08:31] came back down
[1:08:32] well why did the mantle come back down
[1:08:34] the mantle came back down because elijah
[1:08:38] told elisha how to get the double
[1:08:41] portion
[1:08:42] that's right he had to solely look at
[1:08:46] elijah
[1:08:48] that's right it didn't matter if a
[1:08:50] little critter and game random ran by
[1:08:53] didn't matter if an alien flew across
[1:08:56] the sky
[1:08:58] i didn't care what the if somebody ran
[1:09:01] up in the news article and said watch
[1:09:02] out brother that's coming
[1:09:04] right he had to keep his eyes on elijah
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:11] hallelujah you were born for a double
[1:09:14] portion how do i get it you've got to
[1:09:17] have your eyes solely on christ
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:28] you know why because it's a hard thing
[1:09:31] it was ordained to be this way that's
[1:09:34] right that's why brother branham said he
[1:09:35] said the hardest thing for god to do is
[1:09:36] to find one man that he can get solely
[1:09:38] set aside
[1:09:40] but think about it god is getting a
[1:09:42] whole bride ready for that amen
[1:09:45] amen by the hearing of the word
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] i got a lot more but i'm just gonna say
[1:09:52] a few more things i'll let you go
[1:09:54] hallelujah
[1:09:56] god hiding himself in simplicity he said
[1:09:59] god taking a humble sinner and cleansing
[1:10:01] him by his blood
[1:10:03] and dropping that confessed sin into the
[1:10:05] clorox bleach of the blood of the son of
[1:10:07] god and putting his own life into that
[1:10:10] man by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:14] then if we have the genuine
[1:10:17] baptism of the holy ghost what's wrong
[1:10:19] with us
[1:10:24] when the time
[1:10:26] when elijah dropped the robe on elijah
[1:10:28] you've got a double portion of it jesus
[1:10:30] said the works that i do
[1:10:31] ye shall do also and greater than this
[1:10:34] shall you do for i go unto my father
[1:10:37] what's a wrong church
[1:10:40] it's right after the seas
[1:10:42] now you've called us beelzebub of
[1:10:45] visions and things like that get off my
[1:10:47] back
[1:10:49] brother get down to the cross get the
[1:10:51] gospel we don't have to impersonate
[1:10:55] why would you take an impersonation when
[1:10:58] uh why would you take some false
[1:10:59] conception of it when the skies are full
[1:11:01] of genuine pentecostal power that makes
[1:11:03] a man or woman a son or daughter of god
[1:11:05] and takes him back into the presence of
[1:11:07] god
[1:11:08] there you are god revealing himself in
[1:11:10] humility watch us
[1:11:13] you've got to get away
[1:11:15] from your own thoughts
[1:11:18] you've got to let the mind that was in
[1:11:20] christ be in you
[1:11:22] and you've got to stay there
[1:11:24] till every sin of fear every sin of
[1:11:27] doubt has gone from your heart amen
[1:11:31] hallelujah you know why fear is being
[1:11:33] unleashed on us right now
[1:11:35] it's just a greater portion because only
[1:11:36] the bride can get to a spot where
[1:11:38] they're not afraid of it
[1:11:40] amen
[1:11:43] you know putin's got some bombs with usa
[1:11:45] written all over it
[1:11:48] yep
[1:11:48] it's coming
[1:11:50] that's the seven vision american craters
[1:11:53] newt
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:57] let's get ready
[1:11:58] because i'll tell you what the holy
[1:11:59] ghost can be so strong you could be like
[1:12:01] john the revelator being a pot of
[1:12:03] seething oil i won't even phase you
[1:12:05] that's right
[1:12:08] until every sin of fear every son of god
[1:12:10] of doubt is gone from your heart and if
[1:12:12] you're there and god doesn't take you
[1:12:14] and omit your sins and send you into the
[1:12:15] presence of god there's something wrong
[1:12:17] with your experience
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:22] all right where's jesus at let me look
[1:12:23] at him
[1:12:25] keep your eyes on jesus amen amen
[1:12:39] i ain't gonna have time for that
[1:12:42] i want us to see this very quickly
[1:12:46] remember christ is the mystery of god
[1:12:48] revealed
[1:12:50] that there's
[1:12:52] three manifestations that christ wanted
[1:12:53] to be known as if you fail come back to
[1:12:55] this
[1:12:56] one is what
[1:12:58] god in christ
[1:13:00] god in the holy ghost in his church
[1:13:04] then god in even condition
[1:13:07] to rule this church
[1:13:09] yes
[1:13:11] you have literally
[1:13:12] son of man
[1:13:14] son of god
[1:13:15] son of david so i'm just touching this
[1:13:18] because what i have told you
[1:13:20] is son of man
[1:13:22] that's prophet
[1:13:23] christ was the prophet
[1:13:25] he was the tabernacle that moved about
[1:13:28] that's right yes
[1:13:31] son of god is the holy ghost ministry
[1:13:34] that's now remember this is prophet
[1:13:37] priest
[1:13:38] and king that's right
[1:13:40] that's right amen
[1:13:42] son of god and then what
[1:13:59] pulling it out yet
[1:14:02] it's deep
[1:14:03] there's a lot there
[1:14:05] yes sir
[1:14:07] but notice that son of god
[1:14:09] yeah prophet
[1:14:10] priest
[1:14:11] okay
[1:14:13] who's who's our high priest christ he's
[1:14:15] a high priest yes
[1:14:18] now let's do this really quick here
[1:14:21] come a close
[1:14:23] when god built
[1:14:24] the temple how's it under jesse this
[1:14:28] when god built the temple
[1:14:30] he actually
[1:14:31] built it
[1:14:33] to be actually surrounded
[1:14:35] completely outside of the east gate
[1:14:38] by priestly chambers
[1:14:42] those priestly chambers as it says here
[1:14:45] the beans should not be fastened into
[1:14:46] the walls of the house
[1:14:48] let me show you the picture in just a
[1:14:49] second
[1:14:51] notice these priestly chambers
[1:14:54] out of the middle of june third there
[1:14:56] was actually three stories
[1:14:57] to these priestly chambers
[1:15:00] so he built the house finished it
[1:15:01] covered the house with beams and boards
[1:15:02] of caesars
[1:15:06] aside
[1:15:07] the temple
[1:15:08] god build priestly chambers
[1:15:11] to store all the goods for the house
[1:15:15] three stories
[1:15:18] the priests would watch they would lean
[1:15:20] upon the temple
[1:15:25] they said that that was a place of rest
[1:15:27] they would rest right against
[1:15:30] the temple of god
[1:15:31] they needed a rest is to head right to
[1:15:33] their station when they were in service
[1:15:34] they were in service when they rest they
[1:15:36] would go right there and rest
[1:15:38] by their courses
[1:15:40] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:15:42] the holy ghost there's another picture
[1:15:44] of the cut out that right against
[1:15:46] leaning against the house
[1:15:49] was the priest chambers
[1:15:50] there's a good picture right there
[1:15:53] of course they line it up to a football
[1:15:54] field
[1:15:57] hallelujah americans
[1:16:01] hallelujah
[1:16:03] but notice you have prophet
[1:16:09] see the temple
[1:16:10] it was set to be a priestly move
[1:16:14] what which was facilitated
[1:16:16] mainly by the high priest
[1:16:18] himself but the move was for priests
[1:16:21] which is what you are you're a priest
[1:16:23] amen you see every focus of the type
[1:16:26] shows you that's right
[1:16:28] because you're a royal priesthood
[1:16:31] you're doing a holy priesthood offers
[1:16:33] spiritual sacrifices let's stand i gotta
[1:16:34] quit
[1:16:40] now i got time to do this
[1:16:42] but when god set that temple up
[1:16:45] the priest had to worship their duty was
[1:16:48] to worship that's right yeah that's why
[1:16:51] i'm back here right here i hear the
[1:16:52] voice is screaming i'm like oh glory to
[1:16:54] god
[1:16:55] hallelujah
[1:17:05] they did all the insurance let's just
[1:17:06] read that one
[1:17:08] so the priest said what and a stand
[1:17:09] every morning to thank and praise the
[1:17:11] lord
[1:17:12] and likewise at the evening do all the
[1:17:14] sacrifices the priests and all that
[1:17:16] the prophet priests okay
[1:17:19] the threefold mystery of god christ the
[1:17:21] mystery of god revealed
[1:17:23] see
[1:17:24] see what we see is that what
[1:17:26] christ is all of us
[1:17:28] christ truly is the temperament
[1:17:32] christ is what
[1:17:35] he's the temple
[1:17:37] yes hallelujah but now he lives inside
[1:17:39] of you that makes you the town
[1:17:41] amen amen and there's coming a
[1:17:42] millennial temple
[1:17:45] christ was over but it also manifests
[1:17:47] all three of his offices
[1:17:48] hallelujah prophet priest okay
[1:17:52] now you know
[1:17:53] you can go days and services on him
[1:17:55] working with those things i've heard
[1:17:56] your pastor priests quite a few mighty
[1:17:58] ones
[1:17:59] but coming to church one time preaching
[1:18:00] priesthood like oh lord of god
[1:18:03] he's like hallelujah in time i was like
[1:18:05] i was like those priests that were
[1:18:06] shouting in the morning shout at night
[1:18:08] shouting that's having a good time
[1:18:11] because the responsibility in the son of
[1:18:12] god ministry which you remember is a
[1:18:14] feast of feast of weeks to the feast of
[1:18:15] pentecost it's worship
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:18] the temple was worshipped and we see
[1:18:20] originally when they worship the cloud
[1:18:22] come down
[1:18:23] that's
[1:18:24] right glory see how important your
[1:18:26] worship is yes hallelujah he didn't ask
[1:18:29] how good your voice was he asked do you
[1:18:30] worship
[1:18:32] that's right brother
[1:18:33] praise god
[1:18:36] what we say
[1:18:37] today i showed you about christ but it
[1:18:39] also identifies you that's right amen
[1:18:42] there's a lot more there
[1:18:43] we just scratched the surface
[1:18:46] and i hope i didn't wait because i tried
[1:18:47] to punch four services
[1:18:52] a lot of scriptures but the scripture is
[1:18:54] so beautiful and thank god we had a wise
[1:18:57] master builder that gave me amen
[1:19:00] i'm so happy about it when i see stuff
[1:19:01] like this i see the gentiles are bearing
[1:19:03] all the birds
[1:19:04] do all the hard work that thing amen
[1:19:06] thank god there's some 11th hour workers
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:10] they didn't have to do the work as the
[1:19:12] people started then
[1:19:13] that's right
[1:19:16] they just had to do that last hour
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:19] oh god let us go forward with all our
[1:19:22] hearts into the heart
[1:19:24] let's get ready let's do what we can
[1:19:26] amen hey man got me with you
[1:19:28] i know you guys got some works ahead of
[1:19:30] you a lot god's opening some doors and
[1:19:32] and uh god like you being beacons of
[1:19:33] light amen hallelujah that souls can be
[1:19:37] won to this rapture
[1:19:39] praise god to christ because that's the
[1:19:40] holy ghost praise god hallelujah
[1:19:43] it's not about making it's not just
[1:19:45] about making friends
[1:19:46] we're trying to get souls right
[1:19:49] and ready
[1:19:51] remember brother ramsay said when you
[1:19:52] get there he said you wonder why you
[1:19:54] didn't do more to get people in there
[1:19:58] oh god let me do all i can while i can
[1:20:01] hallelujah you are the temple of god
[1:20:04] indeed hallelujah
[1:20:07] and the double portion is yours
[1:20:10] are we going to do it
[1:20:11] where do we go from here
[1:20:13] just see what you're looking at
[1:20:15] are you looking at jesus or you're
[1:20:18] looking at this
[1:20:20] a lot of times we look way too much of
[1:20:22] this it's okay if you look at this and
[1:20:24] it's jesus
[1:20:26] that's right brother but the vast
[1:20:27] majority of time your bible has since
[1:20:29] lonely
[1:20:32] maybe youtube or something else got
[1:20:33] something better for you here
[1:20:35] right brother but they don't have
[1:20:36] anything better that's right that's
[1:20:38] right yes sir we're all in this together
[1:20:40] remember three out of four people are
[1:20:42] addicted to their cell phones
[1:20:43] you know except in message churches
[1:20:46] [Laughter]
[1:20:51] but let's not be
[1:20:54] so sarcastic with it
[1:20:56] it is an issue
[1:20:57] right brother we've got to get our full
[1:21:00] attention where everything is made to
[1:21:01] draw your attention away
[1:21:03] we've got to get our full attention on
[1:21:05] him because he has a double portion of
[1:21:06] christ
[1:21:07] amen amen how many want to say god and
[1:21:10] let this be our prayer tonight
[1:21:12] god
[1:21:13] i want to ask for a heart thing
[1:21:17] can you as an individual even now
[1:21:20] say god i want to ask for a hard thing

[1:21:30] to the tabernacle

[1:21:36] the work that you did and do greater
[1:21:40] works just more
[1:21:43] brother branham said he said what
[1:21:45] he said he used to think it was more he
[1:21:47] said but then christ did things only
[1:21:49] with that which was already there
[1:21:51] he said but when it came to speaking
[1:21:53] squirrels in existence god took it to a
[1:21:55] greater work
[1:21:56] where he could make it happen when there
[1:21:58] was nothing there
[1:22:00] you're made to materialize things that
[1:22:02] aren't even there
[1:22:05] can i look at you can i point at you
[1:22:06] you're made
[1:22:08] to materialize things

[1:23:54] lord we're not even familiar with that
[1:23:55] yet

[1:23:59] type of movement
[1:24:03] [Music]

[1:24:13] above all the temptations and challenge
[1:24:15] of the age may we look solely on you and
[1:24:17] your word
