[32:17] the danger lies okay so we want to I
[32:24] just heard

[32:32] Balaam and Moses had the exact same
[32:34] anointing an exact same spirit the Holy
[32:40] Ghost was on both of them he said the
[32:43] only difference was the teaching so that
[32:48] struck right down into me so I want to
[32:51] kind of go along those lines about the
[32:53] grace of God the Eastgate hopefully
[32:58] don't mess it up

[34:56] mm-hmm praise the Lord
[34:58] Genesis 2 verse 7 will read two
[35:04] scriptures here then will say what a
[35:06] prayer Genesis 2 verse 7 because in the
[35:10] Lord God formed man out of the dust of
[35:12] the ground and breathed into his
[35:14] nostrils the breath of life and man
[35:15] became a living soul and the Lord verse
[35:21] 8 God the Lord God God planted a garden
[35:26] eastward in Eden and there he put the
[35:31] man whom he deformed let's say a word
[35:34] prayer
[35:37] during father Lord Jesus Lord we just
[35:38] yield ourselves Lord everyone Lord just
[35:40] yielding to the Holy Ghost Lord we love
[35:42] you Lord your only hope Lord and Lord we
[35:46] know you're the only one that will stand
[35:48] on Judgment Day for Scott Lord as you
[35:50] come back to grab your bride and each
[35:52] one's judged Lord and the works are
[35:55] burnt thoroughly to see what's of God
[35:57] and what's not and the Lord Jesus we
[35:59] just love you Lord we're trusting in
[36:02] that saving blood Lord we're trusting in
[36:04] the Holy Ghost
[36:05] making us sinless in the soul God we're
[36:09] so sinless loaded that we're not worthy
[36:12] just going to tribulation god that will
[36:14] not worthy to see death or death or even
[36:17] taste of it Lord we're counting on those
[36:19] things Lord we believe them Lord may we
[36:22] just just be so reverent well God we
[36:25] love you Lord bless I still study Lord
[36:27] in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may
[36:29] have her seats are the grace of God I
[36:31] want to teach on the East Gate on the
[36:36] east of gate so here's what we read here
[36:42] it says and the Lord God planted a
[36:44] garden eastward in Eden and there he put
[36:47] the man whom he'd formed okay so now
[36:50] this is the beginning God is now
[36:52] starting to deal with with man and flesh
[36:54] of flesh man God creates the entire
[36:58] world and he picks this little area up
[37:00] and he calls the whole Dominion the
[37:02] whole domain Eden but then he says in
[37:05] the eastward part the very east part not
[37:09] the north not the West not the south but
[37:11] on the east part of this region Asst
[37:15] state country province way to say God
[37:18] has eat and he places a little garden
[37:20] here he planted a garden eastward in
[37:25] Eden notice Adam didn't plant it even
[37:31] planet but God Himself planted the
[37:34] garden right there all Adam had to do
[37:38] was keep the garden pure that's all he
[37:43] had to do was work the tools whatever
[37:46] God gave him to do and he didn't have to
[37:49] specifically make anything speak
[37:52] anything the existence and and planted
[37:54] himself but it was already good to go
[37:56] he just had to keep things in order now
[38:00] as we continue on by the grace of God
[38:02] Genesis 2 and 8 says and the Lord God
[38:04] planted a garden eastward in Eden and
[38:09] Genesis 3:22 this is a after the fall
[38:15] says and the Lord God behold man has
[38:19] become as one of us to know good and
[38:21] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[38:22] and take also of the tree of life and
[38:24] eat and live forever correct
[38:28] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[38:30] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[38:32] ground from whence he was taken so he
[38:34] drove out the man and placed at the east
[38:37] of the Garden of Eden cherubims not
[38:41] singular cherubim but plural cherub
[38:43] limbs to cherubims right he says what
[38:46] and a flaming sword which turned every
[38:48] way to keep the Tree of Life
[38:50] which tells me what there was only one
[38:52] way into this garden it was on the east
[38:57] side of that garden was the entrance
[39:00] into what would God's perfect place for
[39:03] man this isn't he placed on the east of
[39:07] the Garden of Eden cherubims
[39:12] notice it's like flaming sword and if
[39:16] you don't like the Holy Ghost you
[39:17] wouldn't make it back into that garden
[39:18] it's what the world with the Holy Ghost
[39:21] power amen the word was fire amen
[39:24] absolutely and as the fall has taken
[39:30] place we find now after the fall twins
[39:35] being born
[39:37] Adam knew his new Eve his wife and she
[39:40] conceived and bare Cain said I've got to
[39:42] the man from the Lord we know that's the
[39:43] second line in the Bible and she the the
[39:46] the second false preacher in the Bible
[39:51] and she began and she again bare his
[39:54] brother Abel and Abel was a keeper the
[39:56] sheep but Cain was a tiller of the
[39:57] ground he's in the price of the time he
[40:00] came to pass that
[40:01] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[40:02] offering unto the Lord he says the fruit
[40:06] of the ground and offering the Lord and
[40:07] Abel also brought forth the first thing
[40:08] with his flocks in the Panther up and
[40:09] the Lord had respect and Abel and to his
[40:11] offerings correct now notice what the
[40:13] Prophet says here in 53 he says look
[40:16] here he says but when I see Cain they
[40:17] wanted it seen they more immoral they
[40:19] were he's all mortal sorry they they've
[40:22] got to get away they've got to get find
[40:24] favor with God he says and they go out
[40:28] and get some different ones he's the
[40:30] fruits of the field and so forth to make
[40:32] a sacrifice to find they try to appease
[40:34] the wrath of God the judgments of God
[40:37] that's been passed upon them Cain toiled
[40:40] a hard he says no doubt raised a nice
[40:43] crop of fruit he's now watch Cain was
[40:45] just as religious just as much of a
[40:49] gentleman in every respect that Abel was
[40:52] just a pure Christian and he wanted to
[40:57] be closer to God
[40:58] two brothers rise up in the church he
[41:02] says and we want to grow closer to
[41:04] Christ he says in every aspect the Abel
[41:07] was now not by good works we are saved
[41:10] by his mercy then they both came up to
[41:12] worship before God he says I believe it
[41:14] was at the east of the gate the exact
[41:17] same place where them cherubims were
[41:19] guarding with flaming swords that he
[41:23] believed he says he says there was the
[41:24] altar was set there right by the
[41:27] entrance there and to order him to
[41:29] bypass those angels they have to cover
[41:32] that altar with blood of course we know
[41:35] that's what God was looking for but each
[41:37] brother brought forth their sacrifice
[41:39] one was fruits he said the other one was
[41:41] what the Lamb of God Lamb of God he says
[41:46] and I believe they called right before
[41:47] his presence there where that flaming
[41:49] sword was running around the east side
[41:51] of the guard like that guarding the Tree
[41:54] of Life
[41:56] so everything's pointing east
[41:59] everything's pointing east everything's
[42:02] pointing to the east side absolutely now
[42:06] next we see Cain rejected and as my old
[42:10] pastor brother brother Brooke said God
[42:13] actually gives Cain
[42:14] an opportunity for the holy ghost he
[42:16] said if you would have just done like
[42:18] your brother he said I would give you
[42:20] the Holy Ghost why because it was first
[42:22] towards him he was the older but he
[42:26] failed Genesis 4:13 and Cain said unto
[42:30] the Lord my punishment is greater than I
[42:32] can bear
[42:32] behold thou has driven me forth from
[42:35] this day the face the earth he says I'm
[42:37] from thy face shall I be hid and I shall
[42:39] be a fugitive I beg abide in the earth
[42:41] and so gonna pass to everyone that finds
[42:43] me shall slay me so here God gives him
[42:46] what the mark the Lord set a mark upon
[42:48] Cain lest any finding him should kill
[42:51] him we know that was the first person
[42:54] with the soul that got the mark of the
[42:57] beast in fact that was the mark of the
[43:00] beast that mark marked the Beast and
[43:03] fluid that beast seed line correct
[43:07] now did when Cain left the present Lord
[43:11] because we know after that directly as
[43:13] he takes the mark the Beast the Bible
[43:15] says he left the presence of God he says
[43:18] Cain left the presence of God so so did
[43:21] this caused him to become an atheist
[43:22] altogether and lose his religion did he
[43:26] start a rock-and-roll band
[43:27] and did he did he go and do devil signs
[43:30] and did he do this and to do that and
[43:32] all these worldly things no he was just
[43:34] as religious now look what happens and
[43:42] Cain went out from the presence of the
[43:44] Lord he leaves now and dwelt in the Land
[43:50] of Nod on the East of Eden the exact
[43:56] same area or location the same general
[44:01] specific direction the opening of the
[44:06] Garden of Eden was it was on the east
[44:09] side which is where near the east gate
[44:15] he did not go north he did not go west
[44:19] or south across the globe and sail
[44:23] stormy seas and go through deserts but
[44:27] he stayed in the exact
[44:28] same area location he stayed right there
[44:33] and he was still on the presence of God
[44:37] though he was close to the gate this
[44:42] study came from this one quote I'm gonna
[44:43] show you right here look what the
[44:45] Prophet says him he just reads Genesis
[44:47] 4:1 partner 50 girls the only travel man
[44:51] hand was was by horse or by foot and he
[44:53] goes out by gentleness my thought see
[44:55] science has done is he's he said that's
[44:57] the devil you know that that's right
[44:58] brother branham yes sir he says now he
[45:00] lets goes to Genesis forces and Cain
[45:02] went out from the prints of Lord now
[45:04] wash the first thing he done you tell me
[45:08] you tell me when you think we got enough
[45:10] cuz here I'm stopping anyway see Cain
[45:12] went out from the prints Lord that's
[45:14] there he made his mistake and there is
[45:17] where you will make a mistake and there
[45:20] is where I'll make a mistake the very
[45:22] minute we walk out of the presence of
[45:24] God he's dealing with Genesis 4:1 he
[45:28] says Cain went from the presence of the
[45:30] Lord and dwelt a Nod on the East of Eden
[45:32] and locals upfront the inspiration the
[45:35] spiritual eagle revelation and eyes he
[45:38] says see how religious it was this was
[45:45] not a worldly move this was not an anti
[45:50] ah--this or anti that or some kind of
[45:52] new idea move he says this was religious
[45:57] and we know this because the prophet no
[46:01] he says see how religious it was he says
[46:04] went around to the east side he says the
[46:07] east side I read this quote nothing in
[46:12] the east side what is so prevalent or
[46:16] prominent what is so important about the
[46:19] east side of Eden I thought on it for
[46:23] about a week the east side the east side
[46:28] I'm thinking the east side in Toledo
[46:31] so we know hi we have the the west side
[46:33] and we have the east side now the east
[46:36] side of Toledo is across the river and
[46:38] they say their East Siders a little bit
[46:40] different and about five about five
[46:43] years ago I did a job on the east side
[46:45] weight high school right on the east
[46:47] side of Toledo and they are different I
[46:51] am a witness there is a different
[46:53] mentality I work with the gentleman from
[46:56] from that east side area and he has a
[46:59] little bit different mentality there the
[47:02] way he thinks is completely almost
[47:04] backwards the way I think and everyone
[47:07] else around us he's thinking different
[47:09] it's almost like survival mode I can't
[47:13] even explain is different but here he
[47:16] says he says look how religious see how
[47:18] religious it was but notice if we think
[47:25] spiritual if this was a religious move
[47:28] the rest should be religious to and came
[47:33] when of the presence of Lord and dwelt
[47:34] in Land of Nod on the East of Eden and
[47:35] Cain knew his wife and she conceived and
[47:37] he builded a city he started making
[47:39] himself a kingdom making himself a name
[47:45] religious name building his empire in
[47:52] religion verse 40 I'm sorry Genesis 4
[47:57] verse 19 and Lamech took unto him two
[48:01] wives that seed what now dealing with
[48:03] two churches instead of one
[48:07] absolutely now he says for it
[48:13] instanced 53 his furnaces many of them
[48:16] like that from the how look like how
[48:19] that formal religion he said he calls it
[48:21] formal religion beginning Kane how it
[48:24] come all the way out and come down
[48:26] through the sons of Noah ham out of ham
[48:28] head he had Nimrod Nimrod but the tower
[48:30] bable bable comes down to the king at
[48:32] his time and all in all to revelations
[48:34] Babylon how that little seed started way
[48:36] back there at the east side of the gates
[48:39] of Eden coming on down winding out all
[48:42] kinds of costs and everything started
[48:44] back there winding themselves because it
[48:47] was a religious smooth he says he says
[48:50] and it was formal religion that's right
[48:55] but notice the Prophet could look at
[48:58] that scripture and he could identify by
[49:00] what action right now we've covered this
[49:04] I think I've hit this here before but I
[49:05] wanted in Luke 14 1 and it came to pass
[49:11] when he went on the house and one the
[49:13] chief priests to eat bread on the
[49:14] Sabbath day that they washed him watch
[49:17] to Jesus Christ he says and behold there
[49:20] were certain men before him they were
[49:21] had to dropsy and jesus answered spake
[49:23] to lawyers and Pharisees saying it is is
[49:24] it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day and
[49:26] they held their peace and they and he
[49:29] took him and healed him and let him go
[49:30] and answered them saying which of you
[49:32] shall have an ass or an ox fall into a
[49:34] pit and will not straightway pull him
[49:36] out on the Sabbath day and they could
[49:38] not answer him for these things and he
[49:40] put forth a parable to those things
[49:42] forbidden when how he marked how they
[49:45] chose out the chief roomed so he marched
[49:49] them by what outward action by a
[49:51] movement by choices they make the way
[49:54] they set up their shop the way they
[49:56] carry themselves and conduct their
[49:57] actions he marks them by their actions
[50:02] because what it's the follows the same
[50:05] line they were watching him and Christ
[50:08] did exactly the actions that a true
[50:10] Christian would do and he watched them
[50:12] and he says he said this goes all this
[50:14] is he says he marked them just like all
[50:16] the way back to Cain correct now I start
[50:20] on what is the significance of the east
[50:22] the east
[50:24] side these gate what is it and then I
[50:29] thought about Moses he says in Hebrews
[50:33] 85 says who served unto the example the
[50:35] shadow of the heavenly things as Moses
[50:37] was emerged of God when he was when he
[50:40] was about to make the tabernacle he says
[50:44] see saith he that that will make all
[50:46] things according to the pattern showed
[50:47] thee in the Mount when Moses went up
[50:49] into that mountain got into the presence
[50:51] of God God actually showed him the
[50:54] pattern of the tabernacle he was to
[50:56] build on earth correct absolutely so
[51:01] what exactly now he may have saw it by
[51:04] vision but John was actually taken up
[51:07] into heaven he was on the spirit and the
[51:10] Lord's Day taken up there and look what
[51:12] he saw in Genesis 4:1 he goes there he
[51:16] sees the throne he sees one standing or
[51:19] the sat on the throne that was Jesus
[51:21] Christ he says in verse six and before
[51:23] the throne there was a sea of glass like
[51:24] in the crystal in the midst of their
[51:25] throne round about the throne were four
[51:27] beasts full of eyes before and behind he
[51:30] says the first beast was like a lion
[51:33] notice the order he places the order how
[51:36] he sees him exactly how the church ages
[51:39] went he says the first because beasts
[51:41] like a lion the second beast like a
[51:42] captain third beast like a man and the
[51:44] fourth beast was like a flying eagle
[51:47] exactly showing a pattern one of the
[51:49] Gentile anointings absolute sure and
[51:52] that's exactly what Moses saw because he
[51:55] arranged the camp the exact same way
[51:57] in Ezekiel one and one he says and now
[51:59] it came to pass in the thirtieth year in
[52:00] the fourth month and the fifth day of
[52:02] the month I was among the captives by
[52:04] the river of Chebar that the heavens
[52:06] were opened and I saw visions of God so
[52:09] not only did Moses see visions of up
[52:11] there he says but Ezekiel here was able
[52:14] to catch the exact same vision and look
[52:16] at what he's seeing in verse 5 also out
[52:19] of the midst thereof came the likeness
[52:20] of four living creatures and this was
[52:22] the appearance they they had the
[52:25] likeness of a man correct and every one
[52:27] had four faces they had four wings and
[52:29] all these things he says in verse 10 he
[52:31] says for as for the likeness of their
[52:33] faces they had for they four had the
[52:35] face of a man the face of the lion
[52:38] they four had the face of an ox on the
[52:40] left side and they four also had the
[52:43] face of an ego see so they see the exact
[52:45] same thing that Moses saw and John saw
[52:50] it even better
[52:51] Amen yes so what's important with the
[52:55] East right but if we go back now to how
[53:00] God had Israel built informed in numbers
[53:06] 2 verse 25 the standard of the camp of
[53:09] dance shall be on the north side by
[53:11] their armies and the captain of the the
[53:13] children and shall be a he's or the son
[53:16] of what's his name
[53:17] now Ephraim was on the west side
[53:20] standard Ephraim Reuben was on the south
[53:23] side and then of course we start the
[53:25] chapter here with Judah and Judah was on
[53:28] the east side toward the rising of the
[53:31] Sun amen and all the others twelve
[53:34] tribes we know these things right three
[53:36] on each side ride short and then each
[53:38] three were under a certain sign or
[53:40] standard right absolutely Dan was the
[53:42] Eagle Ephraim was I believe the the man
[53:46] Reuben was the ox or vice versa and we
[53:49] know Judah was the lion correct and this
[53:54] is a picture I got when probably when
[53:56] the best pictures I I like how he drew
[53:57] this out notice this setup this is the
[54:01] tent this is the tabernacle right here I
[54:04] know it's kind of cooked but I kicked
[54:05] this to the east side just turn it to
[54:09] just turn to the right side okay
[54:11] amen now this is how it was set up in
[54:15] the wilderness here's the east side
[54:19] right here there's only one way in the
[54:27] holy place there's only one way in it's
[54:33] on the east side as well the holiest of
[54:36] holies only one way in it is the east
[54:40] gate this right here is the east gate
[54:45] but as we continue on by the grace of
[54:48] God look at here in numbers
[54:51] 334 8 and this is this is very important
[54:54] right here but those that encamped
[54:57] before the tabernacle towards the east
[55:00] even before the tabernacle the
[55:01] congregation eastward shall be Moses and
[55:06] Aaron and his sons keeping the charge of
[55:11] the sanctuary for the charge of the
[55:12] shorter Israel and the stranger that
[55:14] come with nigh shall be put to death
[55:17] so not only not only the Judah and the
[55:21] four others reside there but the
[55:25] priesthood in camp right on the east
[55:29] side and the Prophet could look and see
[55:33] Cain's set up on the east side he's and
[55:35] look how religious Cain's setting up on
[55:42] the east side exactly the order of the
[55:46] priesthood absolutely I think that's
[55:50] powerful yes ma'am now think on this now
[55:57] Jesus comes out of the tribe of Judah
[56:01] correct not just one side because here
[56:06] in Matthew one is doesn't jacob begat
[56:07] joseph the mary of the husband or joseph
[56:11] the husband of mary of whom was born
[56:13] Jesus who is called Christ he says so
[56:15] all the generations from Abraham to
[56:17] David are fourteen generations and from
[56:19] David and the carry over Babylon is
[56:20] fourteen generations and from the
[56:21] carrying away into Babylon the Christ
[56:23] are fourteen generations now the birth
[56:26] of Jesus Christ on this wise when he was
[56:28] with mother his mother and Mary was
[56:30] espoused to Joseph before they came
[56:31] together he was found with the child of
[56:32] the Holy Ghost and as you go down here
[56:34] by the grace of God since the beginning
[56:36] Abraham begat Isaac Isaac we had Jacob
[56:38] and Jacob begat Judas which is Judah
[56:42] right so on this side of the genealogy
[56:46] it ends it stems from Judah but then
[56:51] I've heard this is what mary side and
[56:53] then Joseph side or however but if you
[56:55] look at the other side here in Luke 3
[56:58] and 20 I guess if he was 2000 to 33
[57:02] there he says which was the son of
[57:05] I'm Abinadab which was the son of Aaron
[57:07] which the son of Esther on which his son
[57:08] of Ferris which was the son of Judah so
[57:12] both sides Mary and Joseph stemmed from
[57:15] Judah all right and we know by scripture
[57:20] revelations 5:5 that Jesus Christ is the
[57:22] Lion of the tribe of Judah
[57:27] that's where Christ would come out of
[57:29] because he would come from everything
[57:31] comes from the east when he comes back
[57:33] to the earth on this side it'll be from
[57:35] the east side absolutely it'll be from
[57:38] the eastern sky sure everything the Sun
[57:41] rises in the east like we shared this
[57:43] morning absolutely and the Bible says
[57:47] the armies of heaven will follow the
[57:49] lamb absolutely so the moon will come as
[57:51] well from the east
[57:52] sure now now what's so special about
[57:57] this line or the alliant the east gate
[57:59] this lion here in 1st Peter 5:6
[58:04] humble yourselves therefore under the
[58:05] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[58:08] in due time casting all your care upon
[58:10] him for he careth for you he says be
[58:12] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[58:15] the devil as a roaring lion already in
[58:20] the ephesian church age even before then
[58:23] this is Peter still alive this was
[58:25] before the Ephesian this is the pure
[58:26] church Satan was already tapping into
[58:30] the lion anointing right he says as a
[58:35] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[58:37] he may devour now like how Barnes puts
[58:41] this he says walking about seeking whom
[58:44] he may devour devour he says naturist
[58:46] have observed that a lion roars when he
[58:49] is aroused with hunger for when he is
[58:52] most fierce and most eagerly seeks his
[58:54] prey absolutely sure so he was so upset
[59:01] by Jesus Christ coming and dying on the
[59:03] cross coming and down to hell taking the
[59:06] keys of death hell in the grave and then
[59:07] not set in captivity captive that he's
[59:10] now angry it gets him fired up like I
[59:13] thought I was defeating you here you
[59:15] come and want me Amen sure so
[59:18] comes back up that same spirit that fed
[59:20] that came off Christ fella Pentecost in
[59:22] the same spirit that was on Judas now
[59:24] comes back as a line anointing as well
[59:27] as a lion roaring angry but then if you
[59:32] look he says because your adversary the
[59:34] devil the cow he comes as a lion he says
[59:40] the word here the adversary the word
[59:41] here used is a forensic term and
[59:43] signifies a court adversary it goes back
[59:47] to the law all one that litigates a
[59:52] point in law or opposes another an
[59:55] action or suit he says at law the Jews
[59:58] have adopted this word into language and
[1:00:00] explains it Bible ah a law adversary
[1:00:03] didn't you do this sister didn't you do
[1:00:06] that brother this how about that brother
[1:00:08] he just did the other day what were you
[1:00:09] thinking in your head over there brother
[1:00:11] sister oh my and he tasted lawyers is it
[1:00:13] you know you're a sinner you'll never
[1:00:15] make it he said this is time comes right
[1:00:19] out of what the roaring of the lion the
[1:00:22] one lion brought forth just blazed the
[1:00:25] law did away with the law this lying and
[1:00:27] going to now of Satan now places the law
[1:00:29] back he says Satan accuses men of the
[1:00:33] breach of law and please the justice
[1:00:35] might take place and punish would be
[1:00:37] inflicted in which he pursues with great
[1:00:40] violence and diligence absolutely the
[1:00:44] line anointed sure now continue on he
[1:00:48] says everybody it's just becoming a
[1:00:49] neurotic age everybody's all built up
[1:00:51] haven't got no time and that builds it
[1:00:54] out to a place that breaks up things it
[1:00:56] causes people to have hard feelings when
[1:00:58] they snap them off and say things they
[1:01:00] don't mean to say he says now
[1:01:03] everybody's guilty I'm guilty you're all
[1:01:05] guilty says we do things under pressure
[1:01:08] that we wanted to do otherwise so they
[1:01:10] they've they've got an access pressure
[1:01:13] built up today I believe before I go any
[1:01:16] further I might say this I believe it's
[1:01:17] the enemy coming down and pressing I
[1:01:19] believe it's the devil and he brings it
[1:01:22] back to what and we know the coming of
[1:01:23] the Lord his hand and the Bible said in
[1:01:25] the last days he says now look how the
[1:01:27] prophet places us he says that in the
[1:01:29] last day the devil would go about
[1:01:31] roaring lie
[1:01:32] a line he places that scripture to the
[1:01:34] last days the end time and where are we
[1:01:37] getting convicted right here in the mind
[1:01:40] our greatest battle and not only does he
[1:01:43] fight you you fight yourself and condemn
[1:01:45] yourself he says that the devil would go
[1:01:50] about like a roaring lion and he could
[1:01:52] get you under pressure hurrying and
[1:01:55] running over something you'll make
[1:01:58] decisions that you want to make if you'd
[1:01:59] sit down and think it over a man indeed
[1:02:04] me now demonology 53 he says we know
[1:02:06] that Satan has gone out like a about
[1:02:08] like a roaring lion everywhere devouring
[1:02:11] what he will wearing religious cloaks as
[1:02:15] a lion as someone that's been behind the
[1:02:20] back side of the desert
[1:02:21] what would with the lion a tribe of juda
[1:02:23] a man sure of course sin in Matthew 7
[1:02:28] verse 13 enter you in at the strait gate
[1:02:31] right no way I'll taught this the
[1:02:33] Prophet was the one that brought this
[1:02:35] out so beautifully he said it's not
[1:02:37] straight like this like a ray like a
[1:02:39] lion he says but it's straight St a i.t
[1:02:42] right amen because because Strait is
[1:02:44] what the gate what is that gate that is
[1:02:47] the east gate he says in the narrow is
[1:02:50] the way which leadeth unto life and few
[1:02:51] there be that find it right he's dealing
[1:02:55] with the east gate what is the word
[1:02:59] straightening it is a narrow passage of
[1:03:02] water connecting two seas or Lord's
[1:03:07] areas of watery saints of God we were in
[1:03:11] the world amen but when we went the
[1:03:13] waterway what Hitler hid the baptism we
[1:03:16] went from the worldly people and we're
[1:03:18] planning on going to a heavenly people
[1:03:20] oh man absolutely
[1:03:21] we're leaving what from this people and
[1:03:23] we're going to that people amen but it
[1:03:25] has to go the straight way the narrow
[1:03:27] gate the east gate we have the Strait of
[1:03:32] Gibraltar the Straits of Florida the
[1:03:35] Strait of Dover the Hudson Strait
[1:03:37] there's this probably like a hundred
[1:03:38] streets in the world by the grace of God
[1:03:39] Denmark Strait the Hudson Strait the
[1:03:41] straits of mackinac the straits of
[1:03:43] magellan absolutely sure
[1:03:46] chains of God we must be so close like
[1:03:51] we said before how many people how many
[1:03:53] pastors have fallen away and preachers
[1:03:56] in this message falling away I know of
[1:04:00] so many even come to our church in
[1:04:03] little Napoleon Ohio get behind a pulpit
[1:04:06] and preach a masterpiece and I'm just
[1:04:09] going to Wow
[1:04:10] and where are they today Beck's led back
[1:04:13] to what denomination Baxton to this to
[1:04:16] that they had to be they had the ability
[1:04:19] to bring the Word of God to tie one time
[1:04:23] we had this one brother he come on a
[1:04:25] Friday and Friday nights we have prayer
[1:04:28] meeting and my pastor's wife's just
[1:04:31] being observant we all went in to pray
[1:04:33] and we we usually pray for about an hour
[1:04:36] I don't have you know how it usually
[1:04:37] goes when everybody kind of gets tired
[1:04:39] who everyone get up and what we pray the
[1:04:43] past my pastor's wife sister Julie was
[1:04:45] sitting back with the children and she
[1:04:46] watched his brother go like this and he
[1:04:50] was the guest minister didn't even pray
[1:04:58] one minute got out and went on Senate
[1:05:01] bench on the outside the vestibule and
[1:05:03] got on his phone did not even pray he
[1:05:07] comes back Sunday morning Sunday night
[1:05:09] and preaches masterpieces but you could
[1:05:13] not even pray for a minute and within
[1:05:16] one year his back slid back into the
[1:05:18] world but what we find him at the east
[1:05:22] gate he was able to step behind the east
[1:05:26] gate and bring the word he found himself
[1:05:30] what in a Levitical position he placed
[1:05:33] himself right there and we're praying
[1:05:35] for the brothers soul we're praying for
[1:05:36] this for this although whoever but we
[1:05:41] must be always so careful on these
[1:05:45] things amen
[1:05:48] now all through the
[1:05:53] for those twins Abel and Cain and Abel
[1:05:59] Isaac and Ishmael Jacob and Esau we know
[1:06:03] the types of this but I find it amazing
[1:06:07] that when the King of Kings the Lord
[1:06:10] Jesus Christ comes the Lion of the tribe
[1:06:14] of Judah comes in man form God in flesh
[1:06:18] that his one adversary would be named
[1:06:23] Judas which is the same word as Judah
[1:06:28] that this is uncanny only God could
[1:06:34] write a story like this there would be
[1:06:36] what as as a roaring lion he was a
[1:06:39] preacher the Prophet said he had a Holy
[1:06:41] Ghost filled ministry God Jesus Christ
[1:06:48] would send the people out two by two he
[1:06:50] would heal the sick raise the dead signs
[1:06:52] wonders and miracles come back rejoicing
[1:06:54] with the other eleven but he was he was
[1:07:02] he was a false seed absolutely
[1:07:09] his name was Judah also in Genesis 29
[1:07:20] verse 35 and Leah or Leia how you say it
[1:07:24] she conceived again and bare a son and
[1:07:26] said now I will praise the Lord
[1:07:29] therefore she called his name Judah and
[1:07:32] left bearing that word Judah means
[1:07:35] praise
[1:07:37] so that's anointing that lying anointing
[1:07:40] will get on a man and come up here and
[1:07:42] be able to preach and this and that and
[1:07:43] he's looking for praise as well and in
[1:07:48] John 12 41 says these things saith
[1:07:52] Isaiah's when he saw his glory and spake
[1:07:53] of him nevertheless among the chief
[1:07:55] rulers also many believed on him but
[1:07:57] because of the Pharisees they did not
[1:07:59] confess him lest they should be put out
[1:08:02] of the synagogue for they loved the
[1:08:04] praises of men more than the praise of
[1:08:06] God
[1:08:07] oh my on the east gate the Eastside
[1:08:12] Judah means praise the lion anointing
[1:08:17] romans 2 verse 28 for he is not a Jew
[1:08:20] which is one outwardly neither is that
[1:08:22] on that circumcision but which is one
[1:08:25] outward which is our in the flesh but he
[1:08:28] is a Jewish as one an inner lead and the
[1:08:30] circumcision is that of the heart in the
[1:08:33] spirit and now the leather letter whose
[1:08:35] praise is not of men but of God so we
[1:08:40] must watch these things the Jesus said
[1:08:44] he said watch and pray watch with your
[1:08:47] spiritual eyes and be able to catch
[1:08:48] things he says pray get her and get into
[1:08:51] the spirit of prayer and praying God
[1:08:53] will real things absolutely when the
[1:08:57] Antichrist himself comes he says let no
[1:09:00] man deceive you by any means for that
[1:09:02] day shall not come except there come a
[1:09:04] falling away first and that man of sin
[1:09:07] be revealed he says what the son of
[1:09:08] perdition who opposes and exalts himself
[1:09:11] all it is called God or that is
[1:09:13] worshipped notice he actually comes now
[1:09:16] and gets right to the Eastgate but his
[1:09:21] whole thing was say to me know Satan as
[1:09:22] a roaring lion he wants the worship as
[1:09:25] well he says I will be like the Most
[1:09:28] High he's I'll be most like God
[1:09:30] absolutely what he wanted that position
[1:09:32] but he goes to the east gate and every
[1:09:37] Sunday every Wednesday around the world
[1:09:40] minister after Minister every church
[1:09:45] that has service their pastor will get
[1:09:47] behind entering at the east gate
[1:09:50] and perform a service but is he is he
[1:09:54] giving them what they need thousands and
[1:10:00] thousands hundreds of thousands of
[1:10:01] Ministers in the world today maybe a
[1:10:05] million or so hundreds of thousands of
[1:10:07] pastors in Thailand pastors after
[1:10:11] pastors
[1:10:12] I don't women and they're looking to
[1:10:19] rule they're looking to lead absolutely
[1:10:24] now this is our set up right here
[1:10:31] obviously the East Gate right there one
[1:10:33] way in and we know there's the altar the
[1:10:37] brass base and the holy place in the
[1:10:38] holiest of Holies the east gate is so
[1:10:41] important because directly right there
[1:10:43] is the altar represents repentance just
[1:10:47] like the Earth's repented early with
[1:10:48] crying and breaking up with the
[1:10:50] Fountains of the deep the altar must be
[1:10:52] hid and then the brass basin which is
[1:10:55] the baptism right there the natural
[1:10:57] baptism baptizing in the name of the
[1:10:59] Lord Jesus Christ and those that the
[1:11:02] Eastgate will teach these faults
[1:11:06] sometimes they will oh you don't have to
[1:11:08] repent just sign your name right here
[1:11:09] just come to church you don't throw a
[1:11:11] pet and they'll totally bypass the altar
[1:11:14] oh maybe they do have a hit the altar
[1:11:16] brother let's repent or wherever let's
[1:11:18] say the Lord's Prayer but then they
[1:11:20] baptize them father son Holy Ghost and
[1:11:24] all these priests in the world today are
[1:11:26] doing these things depending on the
[1:11:31] revelation how they're taught in their
[1:11:33] churches absolutely and then now we come
[1:11:37] to the message the message of the hour
[1:11:39] thanks guys we got this dialed and I
[1:11:41] believe we understand it must be a real
[1:11:44] true heart felt born religion religious
[1:11:48] I was like this a letting go of yourself
[1:11:50] a real dying out now why did God not
[1:11:54] accept Cain's sacrifice because he says
[1:11:58] it did had and there was no sound to it
[1:12:01] it was an uncertain sound God was
[1:12:04] looking for what the voice of a dying
[1:12:07] lamp
[1:12:10] that land must die it was a bleeding out
[1:12:14] that's the voice that God recognizes
[1:12:17] someone who wants to die on the altar
[1:12:19] because what he said Jesus said well my
[1:12:21] time is coming to you just go ahead and
[1:12:23] do yours a man and in this day Christ
[1:12:26] could say I already did it you do it too
[1:12:29] absolutely it must be a real repentance
[1:12:33] heartfelt dying out sin killing religion
[1:12:36] for repentance absolutely every day not
[1:12:38] just then every mistake amen and we know
[1:12:42] the true baptism in the name of Lord
[1:12:44] Jesus Christ right but when they take
[1:12:47] people into the holy place what's in the
[1:12:50] holy place the altar of incense okay we
[1:12:53] got it
[1:12:54] alright guys we gotta we gotta make sure
[1:12:55] we pray very very key that was right
[1:12:58] before the holiest of Holies and the
[1:13:03] people the ministers will take him right
[1:13:04] there we gotta pray absolutely and
[1:13:06] they'll take him and examine the golden
[1:13:09] candlesticks and that's the riches right
[1:13:12] there that's made out of gold that's
[1:13:15] back in the oil and the poor all these
[1:13:17] mysteries right out of there

[1:13:32] that but are they getting people took
[1:13:37] the holiest of holies are they getting
[1:13:39] people right there it depends on what

[1:15:09] spirit but hitting putting his spirit
[1:15:11] within us a man absolutely
[1:15:15] I was so careful by the grace of God I
[1:15:18] won't be much longer
[1:15:19] this one do a little bit during Israel's
[1:15:25] six-day war it was a miracle war they
[1:15:30] say lasted the short war of six days so
[1:15:36] during that war Israeli paratroopers
[1:15:38] from the 55th paratroop Brigade came
[1:15:41] through the eastern gate of Jerusalem
[1:15:43] called the Lions Gate and that's how
[1:15:47] they conquered right there it was not
[1:15:50] until Israel itself went through the
[1:15:54] east gate did they gain true some back
[1:15:58] what does that show
[1:15:59] tell me anyone related here anyone can
[1:16:03] pick what I'm trying to tell you Israel
[1:16:06] was they are gonna have to go through
[1:16:09] the Gentile way the east gate themselves
[1:16:12] to be restored
[1:16:13] amen that 144,000 will have to go that
[1:16:17] God provided where Hinna a couple of
[1:16:21] weeks ago is here and preach the
[1:16:22] forfeiting the seven churches they
[1:16:25] forsook it but they're going to have to
[1:16:27] partake in anyhow you guarantee them two
[1:16:31] prophets will be baptized the name of
[1:16:33] Jesus Christ
[1:16:34] and that we stand there for a while
[1:16:36] going through 144,000 amen and one day
[1:16:39] and they'll receive the baptism of the
[1:16:41] holy ghost what are those ordering
[1:16:42] 144,000 they are actually the bridal
[1:16:45] chamber yes they serve the bride for all
[1:16:51] eternity
[1:16:52] those 144,000 will be in the Millennium
[1:16:55] the prophecy and they will serve the
[1:16:57] bride of Jesus Christ their servants
[1:17:02] Israel's servants but the Gentile is the
[1:17:05] wife of God hey man
[1:17:09] praise the Lord Jesus any man praise the
[1:17:15] Lord that Eastgate is oh so important
[1:17:21] keep our spiritual ears open our
[1:17:24] spiritual eyes keen sharp when I go when
[1:17:29] I go to a service a lot of times I'll
[1:17:32] just I'm an eagle I just in my sytem I'm
[1:17:36] eagle and I'll watch everything I listen
[1:17:39] to everything because I want to pick
[1:17:41] things up if there's something good I
[1:17:44] want it if there's something bad I want
[1:17:46] to see exactly where it came from I want
[1:17:47] to see exactly the motive I want to see
[1:17:49] exactly what's going on absolutely we
[1:17:51] must be we must be able to catch the
[1:17:54] spirits around as the environment we're
[1:17:57] in see pick up this pick up that see
[1:18:00] what's going on around here just sort it
[1:18:02] and then try and make changes by the
[1:18:04] grace of God absolutely we are what we
[1:18:07] are the Messiah adds we are what the
[1:18:09] eagle lets if we have to be able to get
[1:18:12] to a point coming up soon we will be
[1:18:16] able to control nature once again we'll
[1:18:19] be back into that what manifestation of
[1:18:21] the sons of God and the Bible says all
[1:18:23] of creation is groaning for it and he
[1:18:26] said well he's now all we also within
[1:18:28] ourselves are growing for the
[1:18:29] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:18:33] absolutely but the only way to get back
[1:18:36] to that point is to go through that east
[1:18:38] gate and to make sure you hit everything
[1:18:41] on the way through
[1:18:45] amen
[1:18:47] let me see if I got some more notes here
[1:18:49] by the grease gun this is our new this
[1:18:53] is what the new the New Testament style
[1:18:55] right here everything is spiritual
[1:18:58] correct the outer court is what the body
[1:19:00] the spirit the holy place in the holiest
[1:19:02] of Holies of the soul the new birth and
[1:19:04] the Word of God placed in there now I do
[1:19:07] see different this is I think actually
[1:19:09] switched Luke and Mark should be over
[1:19:11] switched but other than they got
[1:19:13] everything in correct absolutely
[1:19:15] I don't know how many people have seen
[1:19:16] that one before anyhow by the grace of
[1:19:19] God Saints we must be very very careful
[1:19:23] for us to miss the rapture it'll be the
[1:19:27] most tormenting mental tormenting time
[1:19:31] we'll ever have and that leads what
[1:19:34] right in to the tormenting or the
[1:19:38] torture of the Great Tribulation is that
[1:19:41] the fourth version we rounded up and
[1:19:43] killed yes we're facing we're in that
[1:19:49] hour we are in the season of this thing
[1:19:52] we must be so like I believe it's
[1:19:55] brother Jesse's preached one time and he
[1:19:57] thought he said something about being
[1:19:58] deadly sincere we must be so sincere and
[1:20:02] the angel of God came to the Prophet
[1:20:03] said you must be more sincere we have to
[1:20:07] be exactly right everything we must do
[1:20:09] our very very best and we'll full count
[1:20:11] on the grace of God we'll try it well
[1:20:13] trust on the blood of Jesus Christ will
[1:20:15] believe in the Holy Ghost to cover the
[1:20:16] rest but we must do our absolute best I
[1:20:20] mind if you understand by the grace of
[1:20:22] God I know the short one but I just
[1:20:24] wanted to touch that the Eastgate I'm
[1:20:32] just and I kind of shared this cuz I'm
[1:20:35] just worried I'm worried for the people
[1:20:37] in the message and if we as and I'm just
[1:20:41] a really young minister myself but have
[1:20:43] we ever as a ministry have we gotten the
[1:20:44] people to if we entered got everybody
[1:20:47] entered into the Eastgate and on into
[1:20:50] the holiest of Holies are we able to
[1:20:53] push them that way and get them that way
[1:20:55] lead them as lambs that way
[1:20:59] are the people in the condition for the
[1:21:00] rapture are people really in this
[1:21:03] message really in the condition for the
[1:21:04] rapture are they ready to go are we
[1:21:08] totally dead to ourselves is there
[1:21:11] anything if we wake up at 3 a.m. in the
[1:21:14] morning and the voice of God says go do
[1:21:16] this will we do it here right wake up
[1:21:23] and Lord says quit your job what would I
[1:21:27] do it or don't go to work today call him
[1:21:29] and say you can't come in I need you to
[1:21:31] do this has anyone ever heard those
[1:21:33] things we're not probably not in that
[1:21:36] condition yet but we will be there has
[1:21:41] to be a bride there has to be more a
[1:21:44] more sincere walk more consecrated way
[1:21:48] just like I shared this morning I've
[1:21:52] seen three Eagles this year eating
[1:21:54] roadkill that shows me the condition of
[1:21:57] the bride
[1:21:59] and I broke my heart when I seen it
[1:22:02] absolutely every time I'm thinking what
[1:22:03] are you doing why are you eating this
[1:22:07] isn't there other things you can eat I
[1:22:09] mean God mercy dekat he's something
[1:22:13] fresh you know but I see these Eagles
[1:22:15] two of them I had to stop and wait and
[1:22:17] they're eating on the road I just kind
[1:22:19] of inched for heading that way and then
[1:22:21] they flew off I look back in the mirror
[1:22:23] they flew right back to it what is that
[1:22:27] telling us in the natural what is that
[1:22:28] telling us in the spiritual look at the
[1:22:31] condition there's a deception coming
[1:22:35] there's a major major deception coming
[1:22:39] yes Judas's are among us we must be very
[1:22:45] in tune with the Holy Ghost we must be
[1:22:47] able to rightly discern not only the
[1:22:50] Word of God but the spirit of the person
[1:22:53] about on behind the pulpit it must be at
[1:22:56] that condition we have to work our way
[1:22:58] into the presence of God to where he'll
[1:23:00] speak to us remember the cleft of the
[1:23:04] rock I told on that last Thursday
[1:23:08] john the divine laid in the bosom of
[1:23:12] christ he laid right there taking
[1:23:16] communion he laid right in the cleft of
[1:23:19] the rock and faith wanted to know
[1:23:22] something so faith asked love and then
[1:23:26] love could you tell me the secret lord
[1:23:29] and he did the prophets and you cannot
[1:23:34] beat your type you don't think there's
[1:23:38] gonna be a people whose gods who God is
[1:23:41] going to reveal who's who we must enter
[1:23:46] into this place the cleft of the rock
[1:23:49] that is think on this Jesus was put into
[1:23:57] a rocky cave or grave it was hewn out of
[1:24:03] the rock and that dead body was placed
[1:24:06] in there the stone was rolled away
[1:24:08] Christ the dead body was in the cleft
[1:24:11] the rock it was sealed in there what
[1:24:14] took place what happened in there a
[1:24:18] resurrection Lazarus was put in a rock
[1:24:22] cave stone rolled over what took place
[1:24:28] in there what is this white tent
[1:24:31] envisioned they come out said what
[1:24:33] happened I don't know I don't know but
[1:24:35] I'm healed what happened I don't know I
[1:24:37] don't know they have to get to the cleft
[1:24:39] of the rock the Bible says the bride
[1:24:42] maketh herself ready and she comes out
[1:24:44] of the closet we have to get back to the
[1:24:50] cleft the rock there's a scripture in
[1:24:52] the Old Testament where the bones of
[1:24:54] Israel were laying outside the caves
[1:24:59] entrance they were laying outside the
[1:25:02] caves entrance had those bones been
[1:25:05] inside the caves entrance and the cleft
[1:25:07] of the rock they would have lived
[1:25:10] absolutely anyhow let's just say a word
[1:25:13] of Prayer I know it was a short but I
[1:25:16] feel like that was important to share
[1:25:20] during father Lord Jesus we just love
[1:25:22] you Lord and Lord God even as Moses and
[1:25:28] the real priests of God stand at the
[1:25:31] east of gaze and sigh and cry for the
[1:25:34] abominations done in the holy city Lord
[1:25:36] remember that sighing crying God was not
[1:25:39] a none of the sins in the world Lord he
[1:25:42] was in the sins in the church yes they
[1:25:46] were crying out for Israel to be saved
[1:25:49] and to be made right and Oh God the
[1:25:52] Prophet said don't pray for America
[1:25:54] don't pray for this or that but we got
[1:25:58] to pray for one another pray for all the
[1:26:01] seed of God to come out and or Jesus

[1:26:10] God show us Lord please keep us the
[1:26:12] Bible said to be so close the anointed
[1:26:14] ones the endtime would be so close God

[1:26:19] possible Lord and Lord even then all our
[1:26:21] hearts Lord even the forefront of our
[1:26:23] mind God we don't want to be deceived

[1:27:33] short Lord but Lord we wanted to convey
[1:27:36] this little thought God we just love you
[1:27:38] Lord grana in the name Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:43] Saints I just I just worry a lot about
[1:27:46] this age you know even the prophets said
[1:27:52] about Abraham whenever Abraham made a
[1:27:55] mistake brother Graham said he said he
[1:27:57] he doubted slightly he always said
[1:27:59] slightly when he told his wife out twice
[1:28:03] he said he doubted slightly he always
[1:28:06] put that little bit of grace in their
[1:28:08] form and saying sometimes I think about
[1:28:10] myself and I doubt slightly man am I
[1:28:12] ready am I am i real have I really
[1:28:15] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:18] I see the continual battles in this
[1:28:20] flesh
[1:28:21] I see the continual mind battles eating
[1:28:24] me up and I say Lord have I arrived am I
[1:28:27] ready to go but just like a brother said
[1:28:31] he says we can't do it ourselves but we
[1:28:34] know how to ask for it we have to ask
[1:28:38] for the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:40] - Lord finish this work make I want you
[1:28:46] to live through this vessel God
[1:28:50] controlling not sinless flesh but sinful
[1:28:55] flesh God having full control of a body
[1:29:00] that was born in soon if the devil
[1:29:06] thinks he got a smack in the face by the
[1:29:08] living Jesus Christ when with no sin
[1:29:10] what is he gonna he's going to be beside
[1:29:13] himself he goes haywire in the Great
[1:29:15] Tribulation because now God has used the
[1:29:17] people who have a sin in their vessels
[1:29:20] to warp him just like crashed it amen
[1:29:23] amen
[1:29:24] that's all promise amen
[1:29:27] for sure you can count on it because the
[1:29:30] Word of God guarantees it
[1:29:33] amen that's why we have to look at the
[1:29:36] seed the Bible says we're sinless when I
[1:29:41] go out and I do something bad or listen
[1:29:43] Ed I shake myself repent
[1:29:46] I'm sinless once again because what you
[1:29:50] have to be worthy to miss this to make
[1:29:54] this rapture you have to be counted as
[1:29:57] the Bride of Christ Christ is sinless
[1:29:59] and he's coming for a sinless bride and
[1:30:01] that comes through what the sealing of
[1:30:03] the Holy Ghost absolutely but I just see
[1:30:07] if you want to come thank you for a hack
[1:30:11] giving your attention Saints we
[1:30:13] appreciate that talk about the Satan
[1:30:34] trying to copy the genuine hey man that
[1:30:37] religious spirit perhaps there was only
[1:30:40] way one way to know he said that's the
[1:30:41] word test Jesus said I lead and guide
[1:30:45] you into all the truth of the word man
[1:30:48] you find people say oh I can do without
[1:30:50] the preaching on either preaching that's
[1:30:52] a good test right there any mine we need
[1:30:55] more preaching of the word any man
[1:30:57] remember we need more preachers brother
[1:31:00] Graham said for the rapture he said do
[1:31:01] all you can he said then God will take
[1:31:04] care of the rest
[1:31:04] [Laughter]
[1:31:08] a lot of shaving down for you and I he
[1:31:11] said but together we'll make it a race
[1:31:13] of God help me Lord because we're
[1:31:16] alternately trusting in him we do what
[1:31:18] we can in our ability and God honors
[1:31:21] that but the rest will be made up by the
[1:31:24] grace of God amen thank God brothers
[1:31:27] have a wonderful message for a beautiful
[1:31:29] beautiful Judah Judas is the name Judah
[1:31:33] that's striking I read that a few years
[1:31:36] ago I forgot all about that look how
[1:31:38] close it was Jesus from the Tri
[1:31:40] Oh Judah and there's Judas or Judah in
[1:31:44] the program so there's twins it was
[1:31:47] twins both form from Judah named Judah
[1:31:52] but one was actually from the tribe of
[1:31:53] Judah Amen hallelujah what a thought I
[1:31:57] thank God for His mercy and his love and
[1:32:00] how do you know what one sells out the
[1:32:01] word one stays with the word how men are
[1:32:05] gonna sell out the world to have
[1:32:06] received Christ that's what we've done
[1:32:09] we must sell out the world and gain
[1:32:12] Christ but see the st. Judas he's gonna
[1:32:14] sell out Christ the word to gain the
[1:32:17] world you're they're gonna sell out one
[1:32:19] of the other either gonna be fully
[1:32:20] devoted one of the other either sold out
[1:32:23] to the word or told out to the world
[1:32:24] money cares of this world
[1:32:26] we're sold out for Christ here thank God
[1:32:29] we're so out for Jesus Christ
[1:32:31] hey man I'm so happy about that
[1:32:34] praise Lord in the Lord struck something
[1:32:36] to me in the holy place the
[1:32:39] sanctification you have the the bread 12
[1:32:42] loaves the seven the candlesticks the
[1:32:46] Rams are the seven candlesticks we just
[1:32:47] went over last week he said without the
[1:32:49] illumination of those candlesticks the
[1:32:51] brilliance of them he said you'll never
[1:32:52] get into the holiest of holies in other
[1:32:55] words the seals you know the seven seals
[1:32:57] and then those twelve loaves had just
[1:33:00] struck me today those twelve those
[1:33:02] loaves were presented the bread and
[1:33:04] there's 12 New Testament Bible mysteries
[1:33:07] isn't that striking and Scofield lists
[1:33:10] him right here he lists eleven of them
[1:33:12] but there's actually 12 because he
[1:33:15] missed one of them and brother Ram
[1:33:16] brings that out in the message as serves
[1:33:18] us as the endtime in that striking seven
[1:33:21] Church ages twelve new testament
[1:33:23] mysteries then prayer so we've got to
[1:33:26] know those that was beautiful beautiful
[1:33:28] just struck me the seven twelve and you
[1:33:32] got your your prayer that brings you in
[1:33:34] we have to know those mysteries we have
[1:33:36] to know all that and that will bring in
[1:33:38] us bring us in the presence of God to be
[1:33:41] born again my this word is really
[1:33:44] opening and Simon preached the
[1:33:45] forfeiting of the church ages where he
[1:33:48] the Lord showed to him the church ages
[1:33:49] were in the book of Joshua the book of
[1:33:53] the church ages was in
[1:33:54] the book of Joshua and also due to
[1:33:56] Romany man this thing is coming alive by
[1:33:59] the grace of God and we're just and like
[1:34:02] this even this morning's message we're
[1:34:03] just seeing more and more of what we
[1:34:05] already know was the truth and it's
[1:34:07] showing us more proof infallible proofs
[1:34:10] that this is the word of the hour it's
[1:34:14] not making us doubt or making us weaker
[1:34:16] but it's confirming everything we've
[1:34:18] already heard shown it's more and more
[1:34:20] the truth that we can arrest our souls
[1:34:21] upon thus saith the Lord from the Word
[1:34:24] of God want to thank the Lord you know
[1:34:36] for his word and and also thank the Lord
[1:34:38] for sending brother Simon this week and
[1:34:40] it was truly a blessing when I got his
[1:34:41] text and said do you still want me to
[1:34:42] preach on Sunday it's like a wave of
[1:34:44] relief when over me Oh hallelujah I
[1:34:47] forgot all about that so we were

[1:37:04] yesterday I just asked the Lord to help
[1:37:06] me remember this but yesterday I was
[1:37:08] talking to somebody about all my things
[1:37:10] my friend Brian floor you know I was
[1:37:12] saying I said we have such a hard edge
[1:37:14] to live in because the Bible said Jesus
[1:37:17] had to shorten the days that the elect
[1:37:20] might be saved that even someone would
[1:37:22] be saved
[1:37:22] so we're coming down where the door is
[1:37:24] closing and fewer and fewer people are
[1:37:26] gonna be saved here in America we have
[1:37:29] the hardest time we put we pour hours in
[1:37:31] the studying and praying you guys pray
[1:37:32] hours at the church we pray before
[1:37:34] service you know we devote all this time
[1:37:36] and it seems as we're seeing less but
[1:37:39] it's the hour that we're living in Jesus
[1:37:43] said the love of many here's a second
[1:37:44] one the love of many shall wax cold
[1:37:46] because iniquity abounds the love of
[1:37:48] many shall wax cold so we're getting
[1:37:50] we're living in a colder age there's
[1:37:53] fewer people to be saved right the Bible
[1:37:57] said they love pleasures more than
[1:37:58] lovers of God we're living in such a
[1:38:02] difficult age living right but we must
[1:38:06] not be discouraged we must trust in the
[1:38:09] Word of God we're gonna have to battle
[1:38:12] we're going to we may have smaller
[1:38:14] numbers who knows we who knows but we've
[1:38:17] got to be convinced that we're in the
[1:38:19] right and that we know Jesus Christ we
