continue on the Philadelphia Church H this is part number 8 tonight part 48 of the series revelation 3 verse 8 this morning I just kind of woke up I had a burden to look at the church ages again so I went to the book and I started reading in the book and so tonight we look more at the open door I was inspired by this quote I don't know if you've seen some of these thoughts before so I want to bring these and I want to close with a quote from the actual sermon from 1960 I mentioned it last Thursday I'm sorry I'm sorry last Wednesday I mentioned it and I'd like to just read the whole quotation trusting to be a blessing to you so by God's grace revelation three verse eight we can all read this all of us can read this on three one two three I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name it's a word of Prayer and just ask God to minister to those here and those livestreaming Heavenly Father Lord we're so happy at the cross Lord that's where all of us can say we're all the same there there's no great ones there there's no preacher that's above us Lord or there's no there's no prophetess or or any one that's above anyone else Lord at the cross we're all the same Jew Gentile Greek Lord Hebrew no matter what it is Lord male or female we're all one there at the cross Lord we all need salvation we all need your precious blood so we're grateful for salvation that flows rich and free tonight Lord God we give you praise in your house we worship You Lord God thank you for the cross we pray you take this reading of the word Lord as I prepared this morning I just pray dear God you'll bless this thought to the Saints Lord God knew these thoughts we'll look at here for an understanding of where we're at right now Lord God in Time Lord how there's a lap over from the Philadelphia Age to now dear God we love you Lord Jesus receive our worship strengthen us Lord and protect any of the saints drought traveling or driving on the road tonight perhaps Hosea might be the only one but Lord as they travel may your angels protect them Lord God and father unites us here Lord we can be back together Sunday except for me Lord pray you'd give a safe travel to Iowa and brother Matt would have safe travel here on Sunday Lord and just pray for good weather Lord we ask for all these things in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen amen god bless you we can switch over if you like to switch over here by God's grace I like to look at part eight tonight it's a Philadelphia Church age tonight we get him permanent pretty familiar with this by the grace of the Lord but the messenger of John Wesley and they had more light than the Sardis age but of course we know the latest seein has less light than this age 1750 to 1906 as I said part 8 of the series part 48 of the overall series we read our text I did just want to give a just a few reminders about the voting ballots are due by Sunday you can give those to brother vain there's either three four or five out depending you know some couples only one they only do one ballot so I'm not quite sure but three or four or five ballots have not been filled out give those to vain and as I said next Wednesday and the following Sunday Lord willing we'll announce the results by God's grace I just want to give a personal note you know thank you for all the support I'll no doubt be voted in as pastor again so I'm thankful for that but you know in the 12 years I've been voted on this is the first time I can remember I haven't got all 100% support so I just want to tell those live-streaming and who may listen this later on an archive I'm welcome I welcome any and all concerns in a private meeting at any available time you happy to get anyone's concerns and so I've been listening to you know church order from 1963 and and some of the quotes came up I would just want to share that might be a help for those votes I didn't get I always want to be open to correction if I'm wrong the scriptural way to correct a pastor is first Timothy 5:19 against an elder received not an accusation but before two or three witnesses so if one of the I don't know the reason I didn't get some of the votes but if I have done anything wrong and there's accusations against me which I don't know if there is right now please bring the was before me with two or three witnesses I'll happy to talk about anything I've tried to live pure before God these this is my 12th year of pastoring what will finish the 12th year you know in June so we're into the 12th year but if there's anything I've done wrong please let me know I've tried to live right before God brother Branham says this you know he at the being of Church order 63 says I'd expect you brethren now and that's what I say too I expect everybody here at the church and anytime that you see me get away from the scripture to come to me privately and tell me where I'm wrong I don't care if you're one of the trustees or or if you're the janitor whoever you are you're duty-bound to me as a brother in Christ to tell me where I'm wrong scripturally if there's a question let's sit down and solve it out together so I just want to repeat this you know if anything if I've done anything wrong or preached anything wrong I don't know about it and this last year I've had a maybe one email about something that maybe I'd done wrong but something very very small I talked to that person apologized something very small it didn't need to be repeat up here because it it wasn't a big issue and then I've had a couple meetings where people didn't understand what I said or either I said it wrong or they misunderstand me I never went back and listened to it but when we were talking we both agreed on what was true so we don't know we don't know if is that misunderstanding on their part or if I said something wrong but everything that's been brought to me this year I've addressed it by God's grace so for the votes I didn't get you know you're welcome to come talk to me about it happy to talk about and it may just be you know and it may be this next quote brother branham you know says he said there's just got to be one head around here you know and he says you may disagree with with my brother Rams decisions and principles that he holds but brother Branham said but if I let you run it I'll disagree with you so he's saying that you know as humans we disagree with Pete which with each other you know so if I can get the votes because they just disagree with me you know that's that's fine I probably disagree with them on certain things but we got to have one one leader that's God's God's body always has one head and that's how God does it in the local church as a type of his body his spiritual body one head man said we got to have some source somewhere where there's got to be an ultimate and that's the best I know I'm giving it under the Holy Spirit letting him be my ultimate and let this take me your ultimate on these questions so it may be these people just disagree with me and they don't want to talk about I don't know why but I'd be happy to talk about it if they do want to talk about it and here's something else I want to encourage I want to encourage the ones I didn't get votes from to please come talk to me because if they feel like I'm not qualified that's if they feel I'm not qualified because brother Branham says this when the time comes as under God if I feel like that I'm that Orman devil can't no more qualified to be pastor here I'm going to mention it to the church now if someone feels I don't qualify they don't mention it to the church they come to me privately like brother Branham said but brother Branham says in this quote that he's like the bishopric of the tabernacle which means he started the church and then they still recognized him as the leader he just would go out on missionary evangelistic trips and come back so he says he would let the church know he said when I'd see one thing here that you deacons couldn't qualify to be deacons I'm gonna mention it to the church then I find out there's a certain Deacon out here doing something he shouldn't do or he doesn't keep his post of duty and so forth like that or trustee or whatever it is I can't vote in I'm sorry I can't vote it in or out the church has to do that but I'm certainly going to present it before the church see because that's what it should do that's what I'm supposed to be as an overseer so the overseer makes it known to the board or the overseer makes it known to the trustees if someone in an office isn't qualified anymore now if somebody just in the laity thinks the pastor is not qualified they don't spread that idea around the church they come before the the pastor the elder with two or three witnesses in a private meeting that's how they address that so I just wanted you to see this that if we're Christians and we see someone's not qualified we need to come to that person and talk to them about it and I even at the bottom of the the ballot I did put check their you know I pastor I want to talk to you I feel someone's not qualified but nobody checked that so I don't understand but that's okay if I don't understand that's okay I just know I love everybody here I've tried to keep my post of duty as faithful as I possibly can I put this church above everything I put above my natural family I put it above everything I put this is my calling in life so anyways I just want to follow up on that and make just make sure you know any ballots are turning my Sunday so and we'll announce the results next Wednesday by God's grace and the following Sunday now I took a few minutes on that I want to move on here and look at the church age by the grace of Lord let me set a little timer here by God's grace now let's I want to look at this thought now as I was studying this morning I just these words kind of jumped off the the page is there in the church age book the province speaks of the carrying on of the sixth age into our seventh age and I just want to look at this now a few weeks ago when I preached on this I showed how brother Branham said there was an open door after the Xu's and Street revival denominated so I brought that farm that was a new thought I never seen that thought before no one that I had talked to it ever knew that thought so that was a great thought to see that 1906 there was a revival on Azusa Street in California but a few years after that they denominated I think I looked it up and I forget what it was I think it was 1914 or 1916 they group started denominating well brother branham said shortly after that that Jesus opened another door which was the door for his ministry the door for the bride so those that were really bride members out of that revival kept going on and eventually would receive the profit of the hour the message of the hour and so brother Ram was making a great observation that God made another open door even when the revival denominated God kept it going gave us another open door when we think for that we're living in an open door right now amen I'm living in that open door right now by God's grace the door but in this particular portion of the church age book the Prophet talked about how the sixth age melts or blends into the seven so let's look at this here's our text for tonight we read that for tonight I know thy works behold I've set before thee an open door which I'm sorry no man can shut it now in order to understand the wealth of meaning involved in behold I set before you an open door no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age there is overlapping a melting or fading into rather than abrupt end and a clear-cut start so the profit gives us years that are clear-cut stops but he's saying spiritually they overlap so the effects of each age overlap into other ages and the Prophet says and this age of Philadelphia particularly flows into the next age and not only does this age overflow into the last stage but the last age is in many respects simply a carrying on of the six age so that was striking to me the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the eve of every age and like this all the reality of Pentecost amen I like that now I got a visual here so is the live stream on the visual okay so I just did a visual there this morning I hope you open that this is what the prophets saying here that the six age blends into the seven so it's almost as if this open door started during the time of the Philadelphia Church age but it's been open now and it kind of blends right into the Laodicean because it's an open door for the rapture it's an open door for the marriage supper of the Lamb amen and so I hope that does that help I hope that helps as a visual the Prophet says this age melts and blends particularly this age is so connected to the previous age of Philadelphia church age now the next visual I just want to show this again I didn't really mean to put the lives of the the messengers on there but anyway those are the messengers this is what I wanted to say the open door age then continues to the rapture so this open door it carries over just like we'll see later when we in this series how Jesus said I'll keep you from the hour of temptation that will come upon the whole world that's speaking of the time right before the tribulation so speaking of the squeeze time so we have scriptures about or scriptures in the Philadelphia Church H that actually talk about the Laodicean Church age aren't you glad God gives us to all ages to catch the revelation of the hour God gave it to them in Philadelphia but that revelation carries over in the lair Asiya he gives us two ages to catch the revelation I like that amen now once the Philadelphia age has about run its course the layer C age quickly comes in bringing both the tares and the wheat to harvest remember the tares get bound first first bind the tares to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn now remember please that the sardian age started the Reformation that must still go on into the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing etc until it comes right back to the original seat aren't you glad God's watering you aren't you glad God is nourishing the seed life inside of the event so thankful for that amen until it comes back to original seed so see we're going to come back to the original conditions of the book of Acts if I don't see it in my generation I trust the next generation will see it where the body of Christ as a whole comes back to that original Church where they have all the gifts of the Spirit where they're walking in the power of God and they're hearing their supernatural gifts and and they're so senses are so dedicated remember they were they were meeting from house to house God was adding daily to the church now we don't know if God will keep adding every day to the church and of course he will around the world but on a local level we're not sure because we know we know the number of souls is going to decrease we went over that last Wednesday but all the at spiritual attributes all the depth of love that they had at Pentecost we'll be in the bride of Jesus Christ the depth of love amen now while this is going on the tears that were sown will have to go through their cycle and be harvested also that is exactly what we are seeing if you can just think of the seasons you can get a very good picture of this the plant that you see growing in full strength and summer suddenly appears to be going to see you can't tell exactly when summer became autumn it just faded into it that is how the ages are and especially these last two all right so that's been why there's that's been why there's a great even missionary work right now with and that's why the the countries are opening now where where people are still getting missionaries are still getting into countries that age of the open door Internet is helping people hear the gospel the passing out of literature the sending of books and Bibles and the tapes the books of brother Branham that's why it's still happening because we're still in that carryover that still carries over into this age now next he says it is to this age that Jesus says I come quickly in verse 11 so see that's that's real striking there as well revelation 3:11 behold I come quickly why would Jesus say behold I come quickly to the second and last church age because it's going to be short and that's those same characteristics many of them are going to carry over into the Laodicean Church age that's why Jesus said I come quickly he said that makes the last age a very short one Laodicea is the age of the quick work it is cut short now I put up here so it's very clear I've never heard a preach but I've heard people say in passing oh Laodicea has to be the shortest age and that that's a misunderstanding so I want to just stop here and say it's a misunderstanding that Laodicea has to be shorter than Ephesus now look ladis he has already going 111 years next year 2018 will be 112 years now this is why it's dangerous for people to his assume that that the rapture is gonna take place you know by 2020 23c some people have said in passing in conversations and maybe you've heard in preaching I never have but they've said Oh latest see it has to be the shortest age because it's a very short one and it's a age of a quick work but it doesn't have to be later to see how it can be longer than Ephesus I just want to make sure I say that that the the quotes of brother Branham do not say that maybe preachers have said that or maybe people in conversations have said that but brother Branham never taught that Laodicea was going to be shorter than Ephesus so 2023 will make Laodicea equal to Ephesus but see we're not setting dates we're not setting times and and years we're not doing that so these are that this is the order of the shortest ages Laodicea so far has been the shortest Ephesus 117 some myrna 140 to Philadelphia 156 okay then the next shortest would be Sardis and then Pergamos and batter tier is the longest is 896 years so so there we have that we have there you can see again the length of the years there 117 142 249 Pergamos 896 thyatira sardis 248 and Philadelphia 156 and there we are 111 years for this church age so hope that's clearly understood brother Branham never said labor to see would be the shortest age nor have I nor have anyone I know that that preaches the gospel I think I just heard people say it they've just misunderstood that quote where the Prophet said it's a short work and it's a very short age it's a very short age now more on the open door let's keep going on the open door now we will specifically dwell on the open door that no man can shut first of all I wanted well on the open door as signifying the tremendous missionary effort of that age Paul called a new missionary never for the Lord an open door that's in Sai Corinthians 2:12 and I preached us a few Sunday nights ago furthermore when I came to TRO has to preach gospel and the door was open unto me of the Lord so we can see by the comparison of scriptures that this open door signified the greatest spreading of the gospel that the world has ever seen like I said that continues in this age now we will specifically dwell I'm sorry wrong one now recall I use this slide a few Sundays ago when I preached on the open door in the evening service so right now the Prophet is speaking of the open door during the Philadelphia Church age remember there's numerous open doors in the scripture there's many ways to apply it there's the open door for the Gentile dispensation and the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost experience there's an open door to local ministry like choez as we just read there's an open door to heaven by vision that st. John experience there's an open door heart response requested by Christ to the latest in churches and then there's open door requested by the work of his iniquity but they will not get the open door that's a request that will not be granted by the Lord Jesus now I want you to see something here god works in threes now here's a thought you've probably haven't seen before I didn't see it either god works in threes doesn't he it was in the third or Pergamon me an age that the church was married to the state the deeds of the Nicolaitans had become the doctrine of Nicolaitans that age was the open door for the false vine once it was backed up by the power of the state it became an actual I'm sorry became actually a world system even though it bore the name Christian thus it spread like wildfire but now three ages later after a long and hard struggle of faith here comes the open door to the truth the door of the Lord now has its day of course the fifth age had set the stage for this mighty move as that age gave us exploration colonization the printing of books etc so this was interesting thought I'd never seen before I read it but I just never caught it Satan had an open door for three ages so let me just put I have a different picture very similar but I added some words here so Satan had to open door for the false vine at the pergamene church age and Jesus gave him three ages to have that open door but now he says three ages later one two three after that age now in the Philadelphia age Jesus opens a door to heaven right open door age continues unto the rapture the open door to heaven through the name of Jesus through the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the understanding of the Godhead for the power of the Holy Spirit for missionary work in the name of Jesus and books to be printed the name of Jesus after three ages God said okay you had your three ages now it's my turn amen and then he opens the door and now the believers have the open door to the name of Jesus Christ the true understanding of the word of God I thought that was a nice thought that I should share with you we should rejoice that we have the open door cuz it hasn't been open now Jesus opened and later to see right now I'm sorry Philadelphia and now it's open for you and I as well now he now he starts talking again about the Philadelphia Church age it would have been wonderful if this open door had followed the divine pattern of Pentecost which was set forth in Hebrews 2 verses 1 to 4 I'm gonna read that just because it's good for us to hear these scriptures therefore we ought to give them more earnest heed to the things which we have heard less than any time we should let them slip for if the words spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will now you know that this is the pattern for Jesus himself said so this is the pattern for the open door mark 16:15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believes in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and then after the Lord has spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen now the preaching on the gifts of the Holy Spirit should it should stir our church up it should stir any real message Church up because that is the prophecy we're living under we should be excited we should be thrilled we should be spiritually motivated to the promises that God has for us in this hour we should be grateful that we know the prophecy for this hour that there's going to come a harvest reign that there's going to come latter rain there's going to come Rahab stirring faith there's going to come a restoration there's gonna come a restitution that should stir us up and that's why the church age book and the series preached from 1960 on the church ages are so full of supernatural promises they're so full of this the true church will have all the gifts in the book of Acts that's thus saith the Lord brother Branham tells us that he says the true church will have all the power of Pentecost anything that doesn't have any church that doesn't have the power of God is a false church we just read it tonight the Church of God has all the reality of Pentecost you cannot read the church age book or listen to the seven churches sermons without seeing the emphasis on these signs following believers I know some people might get discouraged if they don't see in their lives or they might get discouraged by me reading it but but that's because that's all brother Branham talked about that was his major focus in the church age book and also in the SIRT the series sermon on the church ages in 1960 because that's the only true Church of God hey man that's the church that that has the revelation that Jesus is the Christ and then they can exercise that name they can exercise faith in that name and then faith in that name does mighty things they that's exactly right so see real believers don't get discouraged by that they don't get they don't get upset when that's preached this is what this is the example for the church this is what prophecy says and we've got to live this example amen now Jesus never told them to go to all of the world and pass out lid I'm sorry established Bible colleges normally tell them to pass out literature now those things are fine but what Jesus told them was to preach the gospel stick with the word and then the signs would follow the very first introduction we have in the way of the kingdom of God was to be preached was when Jesus sent out the twelve in Matthew 10 verse 1 to 8 he commissioned and instructed them on this wise and I'll read this cuz we haven't read it for a long time and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease now the names of the Twelve Apostles are these the first Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brother Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the publican James the son of Alphaeus and lebbeus whose name surname was thaddaeus simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him these twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel and as you go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely you have received freely give amen so that was Jesus first Commission and we already read Matt mark 16 that was Jesus last Commission both Commission's are the same all believers should have supernatural signs following them this sharing that he gave them this ministry that he gave them was that actually the sharing of his own ministry with them for it says this in Matthew 9 35 to 38 and Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and disease among the people but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then saith he undoes disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he was send forth laborers into the harvest now many people have the idea that just the Apostles had this ministry given them by our Lord Jesus and so when they died the ministry was over this is not so so brother Branham gives us one clear example of a deacon named Philip who was also an evangelist so this is Philip this Philip is actually different than the Philip that was one of the Twelve Apostles it's a different Philip now because the Prophet said how can the APUs - how could only the Apostles have these supernatural miracles when he says who would dare deny the mighty Ministry of Philip now Philip note is the Deacon of Acts six five and evangelists who would dare deny his mighty ministry because he was not one of the original apostles he was after the Apostles who would dare deny the mighty ministries of Iranians Martin Columbo Patrick and countless scores of others who have had God's anointing on them who would deny those things now look at let's look at Philips ministry again then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did so here's the mighty things he did for unclean spirits crying with a loud voice I've seen that in my ministry years ago came out out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and then and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that city amen look at the preaching of Christ does when it comes in power and demonstration it brings great joy to the people but the people the preachers everybody have to have faith in the Word of God they have to believe in the power of God as I preached two Sundays ago about faith comes by hearing the Prophet said he a real preacher tries to find someone who's believing what he saying it tries to find someone who has faith and then tries to get them to believe that Jesus is here and will answer their prayer that's what we do tonight that's what we do every night we that's what we do every time we gather we try to preach God's Word and get the people to accept God's Word that God never fails now many people have the idea that just the Apostles had this ministry not did that again yes the Bible way is the real way of the open door and I want to add my testimony to that the reason I have to do that is because I can only speak with assurance what God has done in my own life so if you'll excuse a personal note here I will tell you how I know for a surety that Jesus is the same yesterday and today and forever and that the power of God is still available to those who believe and receive so in this chapter and a Philadelphia in the church age book prophet takes about three or four pages and he tells some personal testimonies I'm gonna share two of them tonight the story was about brother Branham details the healing of a Muslim woman in Durban South Africa she was healed of a cyst on the womb after the sermon and her repentance and faith in Christ Jesus as her Savior so she was healed after she repented and gave her life to Christ she said and I'm just reading on the end of this testimony she said I accept Jesus as my savior that did it she was healed and about 10,000 muhammadans came to Christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power God never told a man to labour 30 years and harvest nothing he gave us the open door of word and power and that is what we were supposed to use that is what Paul gave his great and effective ministry 1st corinthians 2:4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and the power now I want to bring a balance of this as we know brother Branham was sent out by an angel he was told you're going to go before kings and monarchs and pray for kings and everything this and so we must note the balance for this because the gifts and callings of God are without repentance apostles must have all these signs okay all believers of course will have the signs from mark 16 following them as well as a body as a group but remember what Paul said in first Corinthians 14 are all apostles no do all speak in tongues no do all gifts of healing you all do miracles no but those things should be heard of around the believers and remember we cannot add one cubit to our stature you know I've talked to different people over the years and one family in particular that used to come to our church but left the message one of the individuals grew up in a church where they believed brother Branham to an extent but they would try so hard to be prophets and that's what this individual told me they would the people in the church would try to speak prophecies and they would try to speak prophecies over people and and I see that in the Pentecostal ranks too you know people just they're they're trying to add a cubit to their stature they're trying to add a gift to their life that's not there so we have to remember that we can't create any we can't try to put on any gift we've got a we've got to just be what we're called to be and we can't try to impersonate prophecy or try to make ourselves some spiritual super spiritual person brother Branham had a clear gift of God thousands of people were healed I've met a couple that were healed through bonds ministry it's obvious he had this calling it was part of the calling for his life now but what we need to remember as I've preached over and over and as we should preach over and over Hebrews 5 last Sunday night and the the question was if we're tired of hearing the word and the words becoming boring and the words not the feeling fresh anymore then it's our fault because the word has become dull to us our ears have become dull to hearing the Word of God and then Paul says if your ears are dull to the word it's because we're not living up to what we ought to be so that's our question are all living up to the word we ought to be is everybody in the church ever in our church or the lima churches you know is everybody living up to what they're supposed to be is everybody investing in the spiritual gifts in their lives like they ought to well probably not because we read the quote where the Prophet said if everybody was in Harbert the holy spirit we'd see gifts multiplying we'd see miracles increasing we would see a multiplication of that so we have the balance where we have to be called to do these things but we can't just sit back and not pray about it and and devote much prayer and fasting to to God's calling for our life if we don't if we don't see God will never find God God invites us to seek Him amen seek him with those you'll seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart so are their gifts that are not being cultivated through prayer and faith in people's lives and our lives we must look at that and of course the balance though with John the Baptist he was called to only preach that's what he was called to no miracles he didn't know americo's core to John 1041 and so we must ask ourselves what are each of us called to be pressing in and really hearing from God well God you know at least have an answer you know and say well well God hasn't called me to lay hands on the sick but God has called me to say in fasting the channel of fasting or like sister she carrion that was her calling to be a prayer warrior and fasting well God hasn't called me into fasting but God's call me into faith he just drops things in my heart and I've just got to speak it I've got to share those or doesn't calling me in a faith but God's calling me in discernment there's times I can judge when people coming to church I can kind of Judge they got the wrong spirit on them after church I can tell you know they're talking about something I can tell they got the wrong spirit how many people do we know that are pressing into that that's what we need to be pressing into in this hour that's why the words be coming though because people aren't pressing into what's being preached the Holy Spirit is asking them to invest more the Holy Spirit to ask them to draw closer and to have a ministry and to become but if they don't press into it if they keep telling the Holy Spirit know what's going to happen their ears are going to be dull to hearing the Word of God they're not going to be teachers when their God has called them to be teachers they're not going to have their it's an order if if they're not obeying what the Holy Spirit is calling them to do so I just want to make sure I give that balance about the Prophet the Prophet had the calling remember he got the calling after he went into the cave and fasted and prayed there it is hallelujah that's it right there amen so that shows us as the example if we really want to know what God has called us to do we must fast and pray and the Holy Spirit will speak it before us so we'll know what to do now getting back to the church ages no I'm sorry no getting back this is the court I read a few weeks ago and when I preached on faith cometh by hearing so this is kind of it encouraged us you have to watch these things because the Christian takes up the habits of a Christian and they live like a Christian jesus said these signs shall file them to believe notice in my name they shall cast out devils they shall take up serpents or drink deadly things and they'll speak with new tongues and then things just actually follow Christians now the person has a very good thing here or do we wait until the future time or the conditions appointed by the Holy Spirit I like that so see you just don't try to cast out devils that's what the sons of sceva did right the sons of schema the seven sons they tried to cast out demons and they weren't even called to do it or they didn't have or they didn't have faith in Christ to do it they tried to do it before actually having the timing and the anointing so that's what we must do we must find the calling the anointing and then we'll know it's God's time for us to do that see now you get the idea he says when it's appointed by the Holy Spirit God appoints things now this is something brother Simon sent me he was really encouraged he's a brother Jesse I want to send you something it'll really encourage you so you is that on the screen can you see that I just thought that was nice Joseph's waited 13 years in prison before he was raised to the level that God had called him to be 13 years we've had this church eleven-and-a-half Abraham waited 25 years until God started supernaturally moving in a great way right and brought forth Isaac Moses Moses waited 40 years in the wilderness before God sent him down to Egypt with his a full anointing on him and Jesus waited 30 years to start his ministry so he says if God is making you wait you're in good company like that hey hey man see Church if I gotta wait for this book of Acts Church time talking about the fullness of it I gotta wait till our church is fully on fire everybody's on fire or if we got to wait a little bit longer until the fullness of Pentecost we see it in our church on a constant basis if we gotta wait little long longer we're in good company amen because that's the profits of the hour and I'm willing to wait till God backs up his word amen because we know God will always back up his word his word can't fail now after that testimony of the woman healed from the cyst on her womb brother Hannah gave one more example of the supernatural power well I should say just an example of how we should stand up for the supernatural power and I shared this a little bit last Wednesday I believe brother man then tells them the meeting with the Methodist missionaries one man to two women to Rhodesia who had not one one soul to the Lord in three years they not one one soul in three years but RAM told them at the end he said I don't want to hurt your feelings I said but you all ought to be home helping your mothers with the dishes you haven't any business out here on the field unless you were filled with the Holy Ghost and preaching the true gospel in the demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost if you're not seeing the results that Jesus said you would see it's because you are not preaching the true gospel amen so he uses this example as brother Branham is seeing many soul saved whereas other people without the power of God we're not seeing soul saved and that ties in again with the open door now I got about twenty minutes here and I'm close with this thought I'll probably done this probably a real short sermon tonight by God's grace but that's alright here's a little thought here this is the thought I want to share I mentioned this quote I think last Wednesday night yeah I think that was last Wednesday night I want to mention this quote and I want to read this here in just a moment by God's grace let me looking up one thing real quick I just wanted to pull up here now the Holy Spirit was making the prophet of God rebuked denominations churches unbelief individuals anyone that made fun of speaking in tongues I just want to end with this brother Branham said it was the Spirit of God in him that would cut people that would rebuke people that would try to get them straightened out well Graham says that was the Holy Spirit making him new that so it's look at these quotes here now and as I said as I preached through these sermons I go back and listen to the actual sermon from 1960 and I want to bring out some of the most important thoughts and I thought this was a good important thought to bring out because many times you know here maybe on our level and our church and other churches people think that the pastor of the preachers are just cutting at them you know to be indifferent or or because they're upset or angry or something like that but I just want to give you some examples of what brother hams talking about here when he says it's the Holy Spirit making me cut and rebuke and preach against all kinds of sin it's not being critical or judgmental of individuals from the human side it's actually God being critical it's actually God trying to straighten out and rebuke his people now look man sit right here I just have to break in on me in the mornings message can't the sleep inversion right there I'm sorry that's the sleep inversion right there can you see it when was it at the end time oh when they went out see here they're justified by faith sanctified justified through Luther's message sanctified here but they miss the open door so the foolish version will miss the baptism of the Holy Ghost the open door you see justified by faith through Luther sanctified through Wesley's message many of them precious Nazarene pilgrim holiness Wesley and Methodists and so forth all of them live a good clean life sanctified and think it's got the Holy Ghost now look he's saying they live a clean life they think they got the Holy Ghost but then he says but then he'll hear a fellow speak in tongues or something and they'll laugh at him so these people that seem to live a clean life will actually laugh as somebody who's speaking in tongues and they'll make fun of him and say oh it's of the devil and brother have said brother you sealed your doom when you did that you blasting the Holy Ghost which is unpardonable so see people can live what they what they think is a clean life but if they make somebody they make fun of somebody speaking in tongues or doing a miracle and call a devil listen church approves they weren't living a clean life a man had glory they will they were not anybody that could last seen all he goes is not living a clean life they're just going through the motions of religious acts they're not drinking they really weren't doing that by the power of the Holy Spirit if they can blast seem the Holy Ghost they were just doing it through a religious spirit remember brother have said that's the most difficult one to deal with is a religious demon remember we preach that back on the Joshua series that was the most difficult demon to deal with and I think people around churches in our church other churches I think people would all say the same thing the hardest spirit to deal with is someone who thinks they're right thinks they're living a clean life but they got the wrong attitude they got the wrong attitude toward the right people that are walking with the Word of God yeah that's right he says well you say we belong to the first Church I don't care how many churches you belong to has nothing to do with the has nothing of the Word of God and don't take her add that's right he says their synagogues of Satan now that's just that's hard to read it's hard to read churches can have people that are living sort of clean lives but if they make fun of the real Holy Ghost brother Ram says their synagogues of Satan which we know we've heard god of this evil agent anointing once the end times all these things we've heard those beautiful powerful messages but I want to I want to make sure we read the next part but Ram said I hope I don't hurt you when I say those things because I mean think about think of all the adults lives for me think about how many nice people we know that go to Nazarene churches or Catholic churches I met lots of nice nice Catholic people I've got children I teaching them at the Bible clubs I teach and they go to Catholic churches and all kinds of non-denominational a Brethren Church the Church of the Brethren there are all nice people but if they actually make fun of the Holy Ghost they blaspheme the Holy Ghost unless they did it ignorantly like Paul did which they can have forgiveness for that but then they got to show real genuine repentance like Paul did hey they got a really repent like Paul he meant now the local program says he calls them synagogues as saying that he says I just hate to do that I hate to talk like that but there's something inside of me motivating me to do it so what is it as a pastor many times I have to rebuke some of the same sins over and over and over again what's motivating me to do that it's the Holy Spirit motivating me Branson I don't know why I do it you know I don't like to do that I just feel awful when I say it but yet I've got to say it there's something in me making me say it I always hate to cut it women a woman can cry and I just feel terrible I just hate to cut up women but there's something in there that makes me do it see and a moral woman oh my I just can't stand it because there's something inside makes me do it the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit makes them cut it immoral women and immoral churches people that make fun of the Holy Ghost we love the Holy Ghost we want the only ghost to speak in tongues hear and interpret and prophesied give the sermon we want all the Holy Ghost has to offer amen to make fun of that or to look down upon that you're getting close to ask me you're getting close to being a part of the synagogue of satan' which is not our church but you they would be a part of it spiritually right by making fun and not what the Holy Ghost to move who's who doesn't want the Holy Ghost to move we ought it we ought to all come to church wanting the Holy Ghost to move say Holy Spirit move flow through us have your way in this church amen program said see now look down here in the word I think Lord if I'm wrong show it to me don't let me do that just to be going like that people I will I love people you know I do I don't let nobody I'm sorry don't let me hurt nobody God you know I wouldn't do that same thing for a pastor evangelist or anybody you don't want to hurt people's feelings but you've got to look down at the word and preach the Word of God he said but the Holy Spirit rise up and say stand on that word stay there stay right there on that word I say yes Lord you're my best friend Sosa's he was tempted by all these people are your friends the church my brother have said no I've got to stand on the word because Jesus is my best for him then I like that you're my best friend you're the only one you're my real friend that's the only one that's gonna help me when this life is fading away amen that's why I've got a ball out you know media and people worshiping their phones and spending more time on their phones and then then on their prayer a praying a church you know or people skipping church and not going back and listen to the sermons of people not paying their ties or offerings things that got a preach on all the time you know falling asleep in church you know just not hungry for the Word of God you know all these things why what makes me say that the Holy Spirit makes me say that the Holy Spirit made brother Adam ball out all kinds of sins I remember the Holy Spirit on Peter it caught the first sin in the first church right it wasn't all sins out it caught Ananias and Sapphira sly they were lying to say we sold it for this much of now we're giving it for this and that the Holy Spirit wants to catch every sin every little laziness of sin every little disobedient well the RAM said one way you know you got the Holy Ghost it'll catch you on every little thing that you do and try to get Edward get you to repent as soon as possible I'm just paraphrasing but I read that a couple Sundays ago he said Jesus you're the only friend that's gonna stand with me when my life is fading away so we gotta stay on the Word of God he said so I'll stand right with you then Lord hey man I'll say hi Ricki Lord amen amen no matter who leaves or who stays praise God we have to stand with the Word of God hallelujah my brother Adam said here I come I don't mean to hurt please don't take me wrong when I'm cutting at them organizations and things way before I know anything about this all my life I've cut out it never did believe it that's the reason I wouldn't hook up with it all right thank God for keeping me away from I said thank God for keeping me out in denomination thank God for keeping me out of there for all these years and pulling me out by God's grace he said don't think that I'm standing here now look this is quite a quote if you wanting our brother man talk real in human humble terms look what he says here he said I'd rather if it be me I'd for me I could compromise with myself I hope everybody heard that instead of bawling and rebuking everybody like that brother Graham said it myself I can tell I'm more easily likely to compromise I could do that myself I could compromise and say let's take the summaries of God or some movement let's just go join them and go along with them see brother ham said inside of me there's a part of me that wants to compromise and church it's in every one of us there's a part of us all just compromise with with with my parents you know and I'll just I'll let the girls cut their hair or you know what I mean there's all kinds of compromise of us that wants to compromise oh I'll just let the children watch the dirty movie you know or the I'll just let them watch the latest movie there's a spirit that we're sin inside of us sending our members that wants us to compromise like brother Graham says we'll just go along with the rest of them but oh brother woe is me if I compromise amen what was me whoa is war all of us whoa unto us a Bride of Christ if we compromise on one word of god woe to us but we have said well if I do that what was me I know better than that God would send me to hell for doing such a thing as that is that pretty serious Church see inside of every one of us is a sinful nature that wants to compromise but if you're really born again the Holy Ghost will rise up and you won't compromise on God's Word amen see we got so much compromise around the message in a wrestle compo so much compromise around families and everything there must be no compromise with the Word of God and if you've got the Holy Ghost it'll help you stand upon the Word of God yes sir if I have to seal my testimony with my life I'll just have to see that's all because there's something in me I couldn't do I couldn't no more do that than anything in the world but RAM said I know this is the truth speaking of the Bible I know this is the truth and I've got to stand by what's the truth and the Bible backs it up the organizations against it but the Bible says it's right that every man's word be aligned his be true that's the truth that's it just stay with that now I got one more scripture or two more scriptures so let's go to the book of James I think I just read it last week James Chapter three pardon me taking me a while to get there I saw another scripture I want to find that scripture just came to me about the Pharisees receiving the greater damnation oh yeah be more tolerable yeah there you go or Tyler oh okay now I want to close with this thought it kind of goes with that idea of people will rot I think I preached this on Sunday night right peep brother Branham said people wrought more around the message of the hour they wrought fast around the message than they would if they're out an organization that's so true people get attacks harder around the message of course because this is the word of the hours is where Satan's bound the most but if we don't keep our lamps trimmed if we don't stay sanctified if we don't stay in prayer and fasting and seeking the Word of God our ears become dull our eyes become covered over with matter we'd say and then those people that do that become dull of hearing and and never get their spot back they're in danger of being make believers the people that were hanging right around the message of the hour so a bride of Christ fellowship and every church albian tonight and our churches we have the greatest responsibility to keep the Word of God we have to keep what we've heard we can't let these things slip through our fingers like we read earlier now James chapter 3 I believe was yeah verse my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation master's means teachers to see James is saying we don't need a lot of you know Bible teachers we don't need you know I know brother man said we need more he means around the world but in this case James is saying we don't need people coming to the pulpit that are not called to the pulpit that's what this means because they get the greater condemnation they get greater judgment because they're handling the Word of God and Paul said we are not those who handle the Word of God deceitfully of corrupt or corrupt ibly we handle the Word of God with sincerity praise God that's why we always want to be open if anything's ever preached wrong we want to be open come come talk about it bring the word to to me all right wherever I made a mistake and this goes to any church we've got to stay with the Word of God now look at verse 2 for many things we offend all If any man offend not and word the same as the perfect man is also able to bridle the whole body now next I'm not gonna have you turn there but Matthew 10 15 verily I say unto you it should be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that City that rejects the gospel of Jesus Christ now I don't I thought there was a scripture that said the Pharisees have a greater condemnation because they around the Word of God they were Jews they should have known they should have recognized Jesus but I got one more scripture to prove this here now we know that Sodom will have a their judgment will not be as severe as cities that heard the gospel preached to them and as we saw with James James said the preachers that are false get the greater condemnation because they handled the Word of God deceitfully for lust or gain or all these things they didn't preach the truth to the people now the last one is when we read in our family Bible time lamentations 4:6 but let me pull that up there lamentations 4:6 lamentations 4:6 let me pull it up there this struck me I think I don't know if Malachi or Lydia was reading this but this scripture just struck me I was shocked now this is of course Jeremiah's lamentation right before Jerusalem got taken captive members a Takei and them all got taken captive for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom that was overthrown as in a moment and no hands stayed on her which punishment was greater for homosexuals in Sodom or for Jews who didn't live the message of the hour it was Jews who didn't live the message of the hour see why we've got to stay on top of sin we can't compromise on any Word of God the judgment is worse for those who knew better and remember her brother might have said meet preaching remember what he said meet preaching was from Sunday night there wasn't a whole lot of people here so it might be good to go over that maybe more people are live streaming this Hebrews 10:24 I believe it was no it's 26 26 for if we then willfully after that we received a knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin Amen we'll stand on our feet I'm just saying that because it lets everybody know we're done here I hope that was a help the responsibility of the people of God is so great that the punishment on Israel was greater than that on Sodom and we know as James said the punishment upon false preachers will be greater than those who weren't preachers brother Ram said if I would compromise Jesus would send me to hell oh let's all go to the Pentecostal church let's all go back in denomination there's no compromise in the Bride of Christ she's going through that open door amen she has the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that will seal her into the rapture by the grace of God she'll go through the open door amen praise God let's have a word of Prayer now Kai you can make your way here to them the pulpit by God I'm sorry the piano by God's grace Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight Lord thank you for those that were live-streaming Lord or those who can listen to it on the archived God we're grateful

let these things slip through our hands Lord God help us to be fully dedicated diligent Lord God a living sacrifice but Lord we know that judgment is great for those who don't live the message of the hour as we saw in Jeremiah we saw in James we saw in Matthew Lord Lord help us if there's any that have dull hearing Lord God help their ears to be circumcised not so heavy and weighty help us all to act upon the word we've heard tonight Lord Jesus bless your people Lord God so grateful to be your people Lord Father I pray these prayers again or God nor does I preach on Sunday with unity Lord we

compromise when we don't lean upon you for just a moment [Music] Lord is the Holy Spirit that preaches through brother Branham and brings cuttings and rebukes same thing in my life it's the Holy Spirit trying to correct the people we have to do it Lord God may we see that that's your love trying to clean out our lives that we cleanly and clearly through the open door Christ the baptism of the
