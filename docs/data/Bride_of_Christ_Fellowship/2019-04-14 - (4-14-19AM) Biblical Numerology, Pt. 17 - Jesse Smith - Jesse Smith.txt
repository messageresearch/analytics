these are the days of the heart and we behold [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus let's say on our feet here Denver Bibles let's go to Leviticus chapter 25 and what a perfect song I've been planning to preach on number 50 this morning and number 50 is a year of Jubilee lift your voice it's a year of Jubilee I just love how the Lord works don't you Leviticus 25 then Malachi you let me know if the battery goes out on this sometimes I don't realize if the battery goes out so I'd like to go to Leviticus chapter 25 verse 8 we like to greet everybody in the name of Lord Jesus Christ this morning and certainly a privilege to be gathered in his name yes the greatest privilege in our lives praise God is to worship Jesus Christ and be associated and assembled and gathered with those of like precious faith that have faith in Christ Jesus amen Leviticus chapter 25 verse 8 for there say Amen and thou shalt number seven Sabbath's of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou caused the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man in his possession and you return every man unto his family a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you he shall not so neither reap that which in it nor gather the grapes in it of the vine undressed fur it is a Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field amen that's about heads for word of Prayer if you have an eat on your heart just make it known unto the Lord this morning surely God is all we have need of this morning and you're here to have him meet your needs also to give him glory and to worship Him this morning Heavenly Father Lord my hands are up and surely I've need of you Lord and father we bow again in prayer Lord we ask Lord God that nor the Holy Spirit will have his way this morning father God thank you for your presence your your constant abiding grace and Lord your supernatural power Lord to continually change our lives as we learn to lean upon your Lord God as we heard that song Lord God we're so grateful for that where we Lord want to just sound that that trumpet again this morning Lord as the preachers are commissioned to sound that forth to blow the gospel trumpet it's the year of Jubilee and so father Lord we just declare that this morning and father and your divine presence we ask oh god did you be magnified glorified let your will be done this morning father will be careful to give you all the glory honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you being seated praise God so like to look at biblical numerology again this morning this would be part 17 by God's grace and we'll be looking at this year Jubilee I just got I got a few texts from mother Simon he does have Wi-Fi right now over there in Thailand so he just would like to greet all the saints and give an update he's just been doing Bible studies with couple families and he said they had a Bible study with a pastor I believe and his wife on serpent seed and and afterwards he showed me pictures they're all smiling it was just encouraging to hear that and you know Simon and brother Ron are over there and they realize you know it's a lot of ground breaking there there's really no real message churches there and so they're doing the hardest job of missionary work is trying to find those first few believers by God's grace so just keep praying for them there about the father's business you know they leave their family and they spend all kinds of money to go over there and let's just remember them in our prayers by God's grace but they would like to send his greetings so let's look at part 17 here and it's been wonderful to see how the Lord is blessing these messages so I do have Malachi do you have some quotes and everything to to show today so we want to look at 50 but we'll just start out on on 41 and just kind of brief 41 up to 49 and then we'll spend most of our time on 50 by the grace of the Lord so Lord willing we'll look at Jubilee you know the the main text it's a it's a long text if you read Leviticus 25 verses 25 I'm sorry verse 8 all the way I believed a 39 is on the year of Jubilee then there's a few scriptures scattered in chapter 27 but I think Lord willing we'll stay in chapter 25 you know yesterday I was able to listen to that message from 1962 or the random priests return in Jubilee in Louisiana and it was a wonderful message I'd encourage you to listen to it if you have a chance I think you'd be really blessed but I think I'll take most of my thoughts as I was listening I was just trying to write down the thoughts that we're kind of dealing with my heart and hopefully they'll deal with heart as well so with number 41 I don't really have a meaning for that one 42 is easy to see 42 is the the number of judgment or tribulation a brother man says this you know in a couple of occasions but the the Great Tribulation is 42 months long and that's half of a spiritual week a spiritual week is seven years so so 42 months is sick there's three and a half years and a half half of a spiritual week so you see this in Revelation 13 verse 5 and there was given unto him speaking of the beast a mouth to speak great things and blasphemies and powers given unto him to continue forty and two months remember there's great blasphemies that the Beast does right the Bible said the Beast is full of blasphemous names and program interprets that force he said the Holy Spirit revealed it to him what that was and he said that was all the names that people put on churches and those churches are the churches that that that crucify the effects of the Holy Spirit for example a church would say oh were the Church of Christ or were the Church of Latter day Saints of Christ or or were we're a Methodist Church or or like a Catholic we're a universal Church we are the universal body of Christ as what the Catholic Church is saying or the Church of Church of God in Christ you know you could whatever name they put on in church they're all claiming to be the true church but when their lives live differently than the name on the church and and they've heard the word of God but reject it then their lives become an act of defiance against the true Word of God right so when they hear the Bible saying thou shalt not lie thou shalt not commit adultery yet they still do and claim to be Christians what they're doing is blaspheming the very name that's that they're claiming to serve right and so you know like an example would be like this let's say it's Super Bowl weekend you know and there's a there's a family that goes to the Church of Christ right we just passed the Superbowl weekend which hopefully you didn't watch but you know what what happens is let's say it's Friday night you know and let's say let's say the the husband of the family's got children he leaves his wife and children behind but he goes out for the basketball game on Friday night and he drinks there he cussed as he gets drunk he curses the ref you know he curses off you know they're watching they're watching the the sports show and they cursed the refs they they curse all the fans of anybody against him and then he flirts a little bit and gets the another man's wife's phone number you know planning to meet up there sometime and then Saturday you know drunk so he sleeps in they watch Netflix all day they go off to the mall and they they buy you know they buy bikinis for their upcoming vacation at the beach immoral clothes think about I mean this is common things I don't know about you but not many of my friends do this right yeah and then oh they'll buy video games with murders and violence and cussing on it and and that night to celebrate I've gone to a movie and they'll feel they're their souls with murders and and drunkenness and violence and debauchery and sexual morality and act like it's okay and because of that you know late night at the movie they'll sleep and they'll skip Church and I'll go to church next week but they said that last week and now they're three weeks in a row skipping Church you know it's awful and then they'll spend the rest of the day they'll devote that to the Super Bowl party right now Church how about you but that's the act of blasphemy against Christ claiming to be a good church of christ or latter-day saint or something like that some Methodists or Baptists or I'm a Baptist and I'm baptized into Jesus name and yet live like that that's a blasphemy against the very name someone's called to believe in so we don't blacks in that name we're supposed to be the ones that honor that name but the Beast the spirit of room which brother has enrolled is the spirit of the Beast the spirit of Rome is full of those names right it's full of all kinds of names like that and that's how they live and and accept them onto them and that's why you know that that's why that perk up is getting full and when if but it gets full God is going to pour our wrath for 42 months right because number 42 is the number of judgment or tribulation we see it in revelation 11 as well the Bible said that the Gentiles will control the court now not the holy place or the holy place but the the court of Gentiles it's given to the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months and so two is the number of tribulation you know the scripture as well and from second Kings chapter two and when he went up from thence on the Bethel and as he was going up by the way there came four little children out of the city and mocked him now this is especially hard Scripture for children to hear and adults too but they these children mocked elisha and sending him go up that bald head go up now bonehead and he turned back to looked on them and cursed him in the name of the Lord and there came forward to she bears out the wood and tear forty and two children of them so 42 is the number of judgment or tribulation uh now what I want to kind of show here is that that that mockery you know they they mocked Elijah the children mocked him but I want to show you too that mockeries just to form a blasphemy so anyone that mocks somebody else look at him he's a Holy Roller look look at the church he goes to oh he's just you know look at her look at her long hair like that spirit brother Ram said well brother man said he heard a preacher say that he said that preachers possessed of the devil what a Devil's preacher says all those women they should cut their hair oh it's just a big spare Darrell so old fashioned and all that hair spare tire well the man said that man is possessed of the devil because the Bible said a woman supposed to have long hair and it's her glory to God amen because if they're long uncut hair is a symbol of her undivided devotion to God he meant her uncut devotion her for so full hair is some bountiful devotion to God Almighty and she's under that sea she's a she is under that that authority right that devotion to God Almighty see the Bible said they the men that held Jesus mocked him and smote him and when they blindfold them shook him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee and with many other things blasphemously spake they against him so mockery anytime you mock somebody okay come on show me the prove yeah yeah you're either Elijah you're the messenger or you believe the end message come on anytime they mark that it's a form of blasphemy now think about all the people that have mocked the message that you know and think about other churches they go to names of blasphemy best Phineas names amen good to speak evil against someone that would just preach the word someone that would just beg people to to repent and live right and dress holy and live honestly and anybody that would mock that would be full of demons because they're blaspheming the holy name of Christ amen oh that's hard but that's true something but the truth now let's get back to this Elijah because as you probably know when a vice has said that that wasn't the Holy Spirit that cursed those should her that was the spirit of Elijah that was a human and cursing those children now that's the reason on the platform watch how close and careful we watch it be sure before you pray or try to cast away an evil spirit and that thing that person's life isn't clean and clear if it's just something that you're not sure of I bypass it because did you know through a divine gift that you could Mar your own soul do you know Moses was the prophet of God that God told him to go out and speak to the rock and instead of speaking to the rock Moses went out contrary to God's will contrary to God's Word and done exactly what God told him not to do but was successful anyhow he smoked the rock the second time is that right he was a prophet he had power to do what he wanted to do as long as N and he smoked the rock and the rock brought forth the waters so C is it's quite a quite a deep topic God will give a man or woman a gift and that gift will operate many times just because it's a powerful gift and they're able to operate that gift somehow somehow operate that gift successfully and it operates contrary to what God wants that wants to be done now two meters that's a great great deep teaching and I'm not saying I got it all figured out but God is so merciful many times they let gifts operate to let preachers or women or whatever gift it is I want to say women like a gift of prophecy or maybe a gift of healing or someone because you know there's women abandon us out there televangelist people get healing their services all the time we have to cut their hair wear pants expose their body parts wear tight shirts show cleavage wear makeup paint their face like Jezebel all these things but yet their gift is successful anyhow why because the rain falls on the just and the unjust so in the myths of so in the midst of this somehow the you know Moses was sincere enough where the anointing was able to be there and he smoked the rock instead of speaking to it and it still brought forth water because the anointing was there he was sincere and so see Church we got to be more than sincere because we know we can be sincere yet sincerely wrong so we need to be very careful how we operating gifts especially preachers that's why a lot of people you know leave the message or the message churches because a preacher will get the wrong spirit on them and you know do something wrong and won't repent and won't make it right and so there's wrongs on both sides many times but any of us who are caught and wrongs just need to say wrong and say God forgive me and then if you're a Christian you will forgive them because you know not only do they make mistakes but you make mistakes too right that sort of thing that can keep a church together is mercy right preach that message of grace brother said without grace no family would ever stay together so it shows the only way firmly consider together is by the grace of God does everybody make mistakes Rahab city lies to that young they look young prophet he didn't do this as an old prophet where he's got more wisdom young prophet how many would you say Lord forgive me when I made those mistakes when I was younger I had so much deal not enough wisdom that young prophet the one we're speaking of now is wrote down some little children run after him he went bald-headed when he was little young fella and they began to tease him about being bald headed that prophet turned around his hangar and put a curse on those children and before they got back home to she-bears killed 42 little children that ain't the holy spirit but it was an angered prophet you have to be careful not judge and that's like it said in that said a man of God now let God honored Elijah because he said he said I'm gonna follow him until I get his anointing right and he did he never left him he got the anointing he smoked the Jordan in the Jordan separated right and now that happened he did 16 miracles remember that Elijah today miracles and the double portion was on Elijah so he did 16 miracles and that's proven by the Bible you can prove that by the Bible but yet there's some things there's times that he get in the flesh at a time like this and he stilled that anointing he'd sell that Authority and he was able to speak such things and it happened Church now that's striking it's striking that that could happen and able to put a curse but it wasn't the Holy Spirit there's an angry spirit 9 turns out what about you but that shakes me and God help me to be careful when I say hoping to be careful when I pray for people right he said he nice this is a different message he said I want to talk to you because this is not a line into Surma this is a line of Prayer now the reason I comb through the people so closely with that discernment anyone knows then that knows the scripture sometimes sickness is permitted by God to bring discipline to his people amen right sometimes people the church gets sick sometimes you and I might get sick and the reason it's done is to discipline us because we must have did something wrong remember with that Communion last week and we saw how many of many are sick and weakly among you so the Corinthian church must have not been really living close to God they started out really good for God but then little little spirits and demons got their lives they started mistreating people in the body of Christ and Paul said because that many have died many are sick many are weak because they don't know how to discern the Lord's body they can't humble themselves and say they're sorry right they just say they don't know how to repair it anymore they forgot and so God will allow people to be sick why can't I get better why can't I get better and the whole time is because their spiritual life is all sick amen so because they choose to stay in a spiritually sick place don't let them stay sick physically that's right and all God says is just examine yourself make sure your heart is right make sure it's being the body of Christ the right way so many think about that many of the church members the church kept getting smaller and smaller because they wouldn't make things right in the church right he said you know that well what if you take a gift and take off a person what God put on them then you're in trouble with God is that right now this is what I need to be more careful I forget this from time to time you know as a pastor I pray for people cried quite often you know as you might imagine you know I'm sure not as much as evangelist or something like that but I do pray for people quite often and God knows God knows God knows my heart I need to reminded of this because sometimes I just forget to ask people now have you confessed everything before I pray for you right sometimes I'll be honest sometimes I think I just go right to the prayer but it's such a great reminder that I need to make sure before I rebuke that demon that demon might be there because God wanted it there to drive them back to repentance but if I rebuke that and it has to lead because of the authority God's given me my office as a pastor or with a gift to pray for the sick then I get in trouble for that now as far as I know I don't know of any time I have but sometimes I look sometimes I'll be honest Church I look at my life and say well maybe that didn't happen one time maybe that's why I went through such a hard spell there you're the mean never understand like boy that was a really tough year or that you know this has been a really tough six months and I honestly exist and I want to keep doing that I want to be careful how I live my life before the Lord I'm gonna be constantly examining trying to be more spiritual they're not going overboard like we said it's like on Wednesday counting the number ants oh they're seven ants here it's going to be a complete service or something like that you know just going too far on things you know but I'm talking about really examining my heart and making sure have I use the gift that God's given me the right way do you believe in the power that God gives unto men and prayer can do that whether it's the will of God or not it'll do it anyhow right where's the will of God in other words God will let you do things in the permissive will of God you can do supernatural things in the permissive will of God just take Matthew 7 many many will say Lord have we not cast out devils have we not prophesied that money of many wonderful things in your name and I said depart from me you worker of iniquity well apparently they got to do some work and they did the works of God even though it wasn't the will of God and the church said right so apparently God lets his power be used in his permissive will as well as his perfect will oh let's let's make it our goal to always be in the perfect will of God and that means caring what other people think right that means caring about making sure we're living right before each other see Moses smote the rock and it wasn't God's will I couldn't imagine being God's will because Elijah was bought ahead those should are making fun of him out there he cursed 42 of them I can't think that to be the Holy Spirit see but just the Prophet anger and the power of that prophet the power of a gift now 45 I'm unsure but this is part of Scripture look at this and now behold the Lord have kept me Caleb's talkin God's kept me alive as he said these 45 and five years even since the Lord spake this word in the Moses while the children of Israel Warner in the wilderness and lo I am now this day four score and five years old now verse seven says he was forty years old when he was a spy so God sends him out there and then he comes over more than is able to do it they warned her for 40 years right so then he's 80 when he gets in the Promised Land and then he fights with all misra for five years and now he's 85 years old he said I'm strong this day as I was the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so my strength is now for war work both to go out and to come in praise God Amen hallelujah so he had 45 years from the time that he was aspired to the time he was able to possess the land he was just as strong 45 years later Oh may God help that to be my testimony ain't got over to me your testimony that wherever you are no matter how many years impact you can feel just as strong spiritually for Christ and if you need the physical strength if God gave it to Caleb how much more could he give it to us amen under the blood of Jesus Christ to be able to do strong enough to do his work that he's called us to do amen hallelujah now I feel like that with my life I feel just as strong as I did started preaching 15 years ago but I gotta be careful I get a little more tired faster but I can feel the same amount of strength that's right and if I made at least 15 years preaching I can do the next 15 by His grace we see we got to have this kind of attitude like we're more than able in other words even if everybody else won't keep all the message it won't possess the land I'm going to do it yes because that's what God said God said man Caleb and Joshua they got a different sphere than all these other people how do they so what was the difference a difference of spirit amen and we gotta have the Holy Spirit amen and if you really got the Holy Spirit and you've got a different sphere and almost everybody in the church amen right and then the world in the nation you've got a different spirit and you'll hang on until it's God start to possess the promised land you have strength to hang on that's what it was to Caleb that different sphere was strength to him and he was able to hang on for 45 more years to possess the promised land and find his position so although all the other people died they they live to see it he lived long enough and was strong enough to possess the promised land that God had for him amen what a testimony 85 years old still just as strong as you ever were hallelujah thank you Lord now I'm not sure about 46 but Jesus said that you said forty and six years was this temple in building and will Lowry heard up in three days so I'm not sure what forty-six means maybe a man's building but like I said I don't know I don't have two or three witnesses I'm just showing you the scriptures that I found 48 not sure but the Bible said the Levites all the cities which he give to Levites shall be 48 cities I'm not sure why 48 there but that's what I found says it again in Joshua 21 actually it shows the first one was God's command and now here in Joshua we see the fulfillment all the cities the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were 48 cities with their suburbs praise God now 49 of course from our text here now shout number seven sabbaths of the years under the seven times seven years and the space of the seven Sabbath's of year shall be unto the forty and nine years so 49 represents seven Sabbath's or seven rests they're complete rests and now fifty as we sang earlier it's a year jubilee amen Jubilee is or Pentecost is the number fifty so you won't look at this here this morning by God's grace now I just had a little thought I want to just start off I preached this a few years ago I'm gonna switch over here to this one let's just bring this out I was studying yesterday remember Pentecost what it was was was was the was what God did to undo bable bable is what man did to try to unite men right but Pentecost or Jubilee is what God did to unite man amen hallelujah praise the Lord now look what Boehm says he said hi I'll admit that there was one time in the Bible that everybody spoke in tongues and he was debating and he said but he's very upset hallelujah now you're on the road I said yes sir that was that babble no one understood what the other one said I said on Pentecost they all understood what every man said I said it was the pouring out of the Holy Spirit you see at that will they all spoken unknown tongues like Pentecost does now no one know what the other ones saying one jabbering this one jabber net and you know nothing but that was Babel but I said a Pentecost every man heard in his own language wherein he was born praise God so the day of Pentecost when they spoke in tongues they might not have known really what they were saying or maybe themselves but at whatever they said was understood now there's different ways to look at it program have said and perhaps they were speaking Galilean so the Galileans like Peter and Andrew and James and John they were all speaking Galilee and praise the Lord Jesus the Messiah and while they're speaking that people from the 17 different tongues and Nations heard that heard them speaking in their language so they spoke the disciples spoke Galilean but let's say the Mesopotamians heard it in the Mesopotamian language and so everybody understood what was being said and Paul said I'd rather speak five words in a message service than 10,000 in an unknown tongue amen right and so that was how the Holy Spirit was poured out so Babel was man making a way to heaven for all men right but Pentecost was God making a way to heaven for all men out-of-area I remember a battle tongues were a sign of judgment upon all nations but at Pentecost tongues were a sign of grace upon all nations thank the Lord amen now a member of the Catholic Church is called Mystery Babylon because she rides the spirit of Rome right so what is K the Catholic Church she's a man-made way to heaven like I went to that funeral of my coach who was a devout Catholic and the priest gets up there and he says well no doubt you know my friend mr. kosher he'll just have a very short time in purgatory before he gets to heaven I thought ma did you hear that honey I think we both looked at each other you know because he never married I never did anybody any wrong as far as they could find him he's very faithful he never missed mass he was a very faithful Catholic um but you know they don't even believe you let you go like to have like they don't even believe all their prayers and all their penances and all their Hail Marys are enough to get them to heaven they've got to go to a special place to get ready for heaven in that shocking sea it's a man way it's a man way well I because they're known of the Holy Ghost well we live so filthy here you know we got to keep doing all of our penances I guess we should probably go get clean before oh thank God for the cleansing power of the blood of Christ right now amen amen that right now you can get wash right now you can actually be clean and ready for those party white gates amen you don't have to go anywhere else to be ready or a special place or a special holding tank or anything like that you've got the bleaching power of the blood of Christ to wash your garments right right now [Music] amen but this is a man way to heaven is Mystery Babylon and member she rides the beast or she arrived or upon the power of the influence of the Spirit of Rome and all of the spirit of Rome is as those same demons that were on Alexander the Great and the church said and all that was all those demons were the same demons that were on another means and portions right and all those demons one of these approaches was those same demons that was on Nebuchadnezzar how you have a church that beast spirit that demonic power of ruling one divide and conquer what do you have influence for every person that's the spirit of Satan but we've got the Spirit of Christ amen that's all it is those seem the same demons just now operate differently right and now it's finally starting to come out as I've shown you with those articles not only are priests pedophiles but nuns are pedophiles it's been coming all out over CBS News I can share the links with you the nuns are now being all these women are coming for saying the nuns abused me and taught me all these evil things and had ruined my life and took all my innocency and and it's a like the Bible said it's a cage of unclean and hateful bird right and it's all it's all documented it's all out there and how come the the evangelicals how come all these people haven't overthrown that church because they're all connected politically and financially is that right they are all got some connection somehow politically well we if we if we go against it then the Democrats are gonna win next year who cares that the Democrats or Republicans with price is gonna win amen see me sympathy they won't speak against sin because of their political influence or their financial influence well I know the Catholics how all these guys that control the big banks and all these things like that and if we throw them they'll get mad and who knows what's gonna happen to my bank accounts oh it's that's compromise amen yes so it's man's way to heaven Babel was confusions of tongues spread to every nation but Pentecost was the understanding of tongues spread the gospel to every nation sister Wendy let me borrow her her zoos history book from 1906 how's reading a few pages that I haven't even touched it hardly but the part I did look in the very first testimonies right after California after the Holy Ghost fell down his ooze the street they took that overseas I don't member if it was Africa I don't remember if it was the East I'm not sure anyways the very first testimonies was after they received the Holy Ghost there they went into a place and they had no interpreter so they just started preaching and singing and praising God and everything they said in English the foreigners heard in their own language and that's how it spread in night after 1906 come on yeah so see that's the power of Pentecost God wants to do that he wants to spread the good news through tongues to every nation Babel is the Nimrod Nimrod was a leader and this is the spirit of Satan right so the leader is motivated by the spirit of singing but the leader of Pentecost is Jesus Christ who has the Spirit of God that's right last one here I'll believe it's the last one no two more Babel was rebellion and blasphemy right it's a glorified man but Pentecost was obedience and worship to glorify God glory remember they said we're gonna make a name for ourselves remember they said that we're gonna be the big shots let's make a name for ourselves you know I heard a drama one time I liked it the children and I listen to the Bible dramas but one of them said you know they say went to the City Council and said you know last supposedly you know you know God sent this flood and and our cities our buildings weren't tall enough and so we got to build a tower that'll be so tired or gonna reach to heaven and so that if I God sends another friend then we can still get to heaven how foolish that that now maybe if that was let's say that was what they were thinking well that's a case then they never understood what the rainbow was all about right but God gave a promise I'll never fight it again and so they were trying to glorify man to see what man can do and God said they would accomplish great things right so they had to come down and confound their languages and I just heard brother Branham say it this week he said think of a mind he said that can go pick he said think about it you can go pick a blade of grass out in the yard and just there'd that black grass think about the life and the intelligence that blade of grass and they said compare that to the mind that just sent a rocket to the moon and that rocket is seems so great going to the moon seems so great which I don't even know if they did anymore who knows there's all these conspiracy theories who knows but he said compare those two minds and that great man that can shoot the rocket ship up there the great mind that can make a cell phone and and let you talk and livestream around the world the great man that can do that can't even make a blade of grass see man glorifies himself and seems like he can do such great things but in all reality God says that's nonsense what God calls great man says foolishness right what God calls foolish man says great it's the opposite I like this one right here Babel said let's get bricks and mortar and slide and God said give me some lively stones some revelations for believers I know they're going to build their where they were stones but God's gonna build his way with Christians out of ivory stones that are part of the foundation of the church of god and then stones represent revelation to upon this rock of Revelation I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it Babel was false unity centralized but God's Pentecost is true unity sent forth hallelujah Babel was tongues of confusion and division Pentecost is tongues of understanding and unity and I hear this yeah Babel is then making a name for man but Pentecost is them declaring the name of Jesus Christ and I think that's it yeah I just had that thought I thought you know I'd like to preach that to kind of give a start to to Jubilee and Pentecost you like that it's been about three years since I've preached that so I hope that was okay now notice here the Bible said the Jubilee came on the day of atonement I love this when I heard a preacher preach this the day of atonement was on the tenth day of the seventh month as the Old Testament type and that is fulfilled in revelation 10 7 because the days because as it was in days that I'm sorry the days of 7 J angel and he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets in other words you and I can understand the real gospel of Jesus Christ because God sent His Prophet to finish the mysteries of God amen and now the gospel is no longer a mystery right like I was talking to my friend who's still denomination on Thursday and he's still kind of complex you know how I like David could be a man after God's own heart but then go commit adultery and kill a man Uriah and I tried to tell him I said I said sir I said that's the power of the New Testament baptism of the Holy Ghost because once a man gets born again now he gets born again his soul and now he's the Christ is sealed into him that anointing would leave David but once you get the seal the Holy Ghost that anointing in your soul doesn't leave you you might forget about it and get all worked up and worried in your mind and frustrated and all kind of a discourage and then and defeat in your mind but if you stop and take a minute of Prayer and say God show me your goal later forgive me return to you if you stop for a moment pretty soon that soul will speak God's Word it will speak something if they let you know that God's presence is with you because it's God's nature the Holy Spirit is the souls of nature man so if the Holy Spirit has a mark in there then that mark inside of there is going to speak to you praise God it's so this is a nature when you get your mind off what the law says and get our minds on the nature of God it gives a witness because his Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God so the day of atonement was when the high priest would make atonement for his family first all the way in the holiest of Holies and then he take another go and take that blood and go all the way in for the people and then everybody can leave Church and say all of ours from 2019 is under the blood and that's such a beautiful type of what brother is method but his message took up all the misunderstandings about you know managing the about forgiveness and water baptism and the baptism of Holy Ghost it took all these mysteries off and who is no kaznyk and all these things and now we can see what God truly says and God says that he's forgiven you from every transgression and when you're born again the Bible said it's Christ in you the hope of glory that generations have longed to see that's what revelation 10 7 did it took all the seals off the book it took off the mystery of the book and now I know what God really thinks about me amen hallelujah and now what I'm atoned with God I have an atonement which means peace we've been made at peace I've reconciled where there's there's nothing between my Lord and I right there's nothing between me and my Savior amen or my savior life that's the right grammar Barney so 10 7 so the Pentecost the trumpet was blown on the same day the I'm forgiving all your sins oh what a beautiful type there the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell and it was sounding the trumpet all your sins are forgiven and now that now I'm gonna live in you I'm gonna talk in you I'm gonna walk in you and you will be my children take your Bible to second Corinthians 6 that just struck me they're fresh I'll be the second Corinthians chapter 6 this is the whole plan of God oh I'm in first Corinthians sorry yes sir okay verse 14 I'll share this with a guy from Texas who called me last night I preached in for about 20 minutes he was receiving it too so hopefully I'll get his life lined up he was in a fornication and all these things and I was kind of he wanted to hear so I was preaching it now I don't preach it everybody like that but he one to hear it so that was good the children heard me preaching to him too so I preached last night now I'm preaching this morning secondly at 6:14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with Belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the temple the Living God as God has said now here's where here's what God wants to do church went through the message right the baptism oils this is what God wants to do I will dwell in them how many want to be God's temple this is the whole purpose of the New Testament so God can dwell in you all the time and if he's in you all the time then that means churches every day praise God some of you say well I have a hard time coming on Wednesday night or I have a hard time come on Sunday night well me I go to church every day all day each day because God's at me God's in his temple God's in church all the time are you with me he said I will drill in them and how many want God to walk in them see that's it right there I'm sorry that word out right there right there is the feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace right there's the full armor of God because I preach that a few weeks ago remember that when your feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace that means you prayed through and you have peace in every step that you walk that means you've chosen the path of righteousness that means you've chosen to walk spiritually and naturally right in the perfect will of God not the permissive will of God but you're walking the wind of God and if we're working the will of God then you're willing to walk in the warfare because you're a soldier you didn't leave your sword at home or your shield you didn't forget your helmet you're only going to look in the paths of peace the past that God wants you to walk in so what did God say God said oh I want to dwell in brother amen right now what the Bible said and God has said I will dwell in Jose is that right brother this would gap it's not what I say it's what God says Amen God saying I couldn't live all the way in David but I would have live in you praise God God said I would warn you I want to walk in Jesse Smith I want to walk into the school on the walk in the church in his body I want to walk in him and then he says and then next he says and I will be their God and they shall be my people glory so wherefore come out from among them and be separate say at the Lord bro man said that is the price to pay for white garments hey man the price to pay is separating from anybody that you're unequally yoked with that's the price for a white garment separation is the price that you have to pay you have to lose a lot of friends right lose a lot of soceity might lose a job right you got to lose a lot of things if you want God to walk in you but you realize the treasure you have when you have God far outweighs the little loss that you just lost right because the Bible said the trials work inside of you an eternal weight of glory amen oh wait a character right a substance of faith praise God that's what God works inside of you and I glory how am i doing time okay good alright wherefore come among them be separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you right now it used to be magazines people touch those that was the wrong thing well today it's our cellphones many times right or sir remote control we shouldn't be touching that think about think about what you touch with your hands that's the wrong thing to touch and the Bible said touch not the unclean thing he says and I'll receive you saith the Lord and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty so see worldly things if we ever get attached to worldly things will feel like God is this some far-off God that doesn't really care about us and we can't feel close to him but when we walk in obedience we feel like he's daddy Abba Abba daddy father right now Abba Father and that's the spirit of the adoption right I cry Abba Father so see this is this is that what the baptism holy ghost was met this is what the message meant to do the message was brought to us so we could experience the fullness of Christ inside of us that God would live in me constantly and that God would work in me and God will be my god and I'll be his child glory amen now look at verse 10 and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land and all that happens there they shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man at his family a jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you you should not so neither shop neither reap that which growth of itself in it nor gather the grapes of it I'm sorry in its of that vine undressed now the word Jubilee means a shout of joy so church even under the law they had shout spell sometimes now why can't you and I have shout spells we can pave ahead we're supposed to right see every 50 years they had permission you can shout now right Joshua gave him permission when the walls fell down he said shout now see now the same thing is true for us but it's not me telling you to show it's the Holy Ghost telling you to shout and if the shout smell the worshipping spell the glory smell the giving God praise that's the Jubilee spirit of the Holy Spirit amen see with the religious impulse not a man telling you okay brilliant now you can shout now the songs over go ahead and shop now sister Brenda now you can shout okay go ahead go ahead we're waiting for you shop it's not a man telling you in the shout the holy spirit starts rising up and it's like a it's like an artesian well you just feel it embrace soon you just gotta let it know yeah oh praise God I just got a little because it's not me doing it it's bear doing it hallelujah and don't forget that's a fruit of the Holy Spirit so if you say you're born again every now and then you ought to have a joy shout that's right joy is one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit now thank you thank you Jesus praise God it's been proved scientifically that the more people praying shout and praise the Lord I got a little book on it the more people pray and shout the less stress they have in their lives and the healthy they are and the longer they live no wonder Adam lived 930 years no wonder he must have been glory shouts all the time it's probably due to oxygen or something like that okay you understand what I'm sayin right you when you come to God he lives in you you cast all your cares you get out all the mud Lori you get all the trash out and your body's healthier your mind stronger you're more focused you're more of a conqueror praise God you're more able to be used by God amen now if somehow or the other the individual lost their inheritance was given them by God they're coming here called the Jubilee here every seven years they had a rest of Sabbath every seven days and a Sabbath every seven years had a Sabbath and seven Sabbath's was 49 years the fiftieth year was Jubilee and then this Jubilee every man that had lost his hands by some means if he is a freeboard or true blood it is right no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he'd have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance and that beautiful if you wanted to be born again if we want a real book of Acts church we've just got to stop what we're doing and go back to what God has called us to praise God we just got stopped living in the same old ways the same old habits the same old thoughts writer we just got to stop that and just return to what the Bible says oh I love it don't you oh my he had a right to do it it was a god-given right because he by grace had inherited and there was been given to his father's and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it they must go free and that grace is way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance what a picture gives us tonight of the church in these last days you see what man can do and then you see what God does what man does is failing and will fail has failed and will always fail but what God does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away God give it it's his free gift and my sovereign foresight saw it placed it in there and there's nothing can ever move it it's very turn Lee and that Jubilee was God's manner of expressing grace to his people for restoring or be brought back to their rightful position oh so what did you believe it's God's grace it's his free gift come back you're entitled to freedom you're entitled to everything that you lost your entire driver back and there's only one thing you're gonna do walk away from your past life oh thank god amen see but people are so caught up in bad habits right and Mela Ram says and I quote habits are spirits a bad habit is a bad bunch of demons is that right it's exactly right now I want to bring this up here because it struck me as I read this I thought my see if your brother is poor and he's sold some of his possession let's say he's poor so he sells let's say a half of acre okay I'll just use that he sells a half acre and if any of his kin come to redeem it then char you deem that which his brother sold let's say the man says I'm gonna bind I can't pay my tithes and offerings Yeah right I can't pay my I I can't pay my food bill this month my grocery bill I'm gonna sell it half an acre he gets that money said okay all right here's the groceries all right now I can feed itll kitties praise the Lord but after I starts missing that land our four others died for that God brought Israel two million people out so I could have that that belongs to me my dad used to farm that land my mom gave birth on that land or whatever you know whatever no the the connection at land is the Bible said if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it so that man might eventually get some some funds he might have a season of gaining you know we have a season to lose and a season to get you might have a little season where he's pretty smart business-wise he pulled a good deal there or maybe there was a little extra corner he owns the other land he's able to sell that and he can go back and say listen it's not a choice it's not your choice I sold this to you but it's not your choice you have to let me have this back because I'm redeeming it back it used to be mine but because it's yours now but even though it's yours but it was yours it was my father's and before here's my father's the father before him the God said before was anybody it was God's and God determined that my family was let's say I'm the Judah God determined Judah had this land and so that guy who bought it he couldn't argue and say no I'm not that's mine fair and square I've got the deed he couldn't say that but the man coming back said listen I came into a better time I'm gonna buy this back I don't have to wait you know 49 more years for the Jubilee I can have it now now see a man could redeem his own land before the Jubilee and church this reminded me because you and I cannot redeem our own selves right but as far as salvation Jesus Christ redeemed us so what type is in here this is the type how can I redeem what I've lost this is though this is the only type that if it's as I can see in Scripture the only Redemption that you have the power to redeem you and I is redeeming the time right you can't save yourself can you are you are you your own Savior are you did you save yourself the brother Bram save you no of course not you can't redeem yourself there's only one thing you can redeem and that's the time your free time and only the wise virgin will do it let me be very straight on that foolish virgin will waste their time on worldly things right but the lines margin will redeem the time and they will do what God wants and not what their flesh was in the Old Testament yes you could redeem your own land back in the New Testament yes you can redeem your time back you redeem it well Jesse can you come over and pray for my house and and so I can do better in my house well I could or you could redeem it i I've done that people's house I'll take oh I'll now put on their house which that's a good thing to do I think I put oil up here on one of these I know I put oil we anointed these one time maybe it maybe it kind of operated but I've anointed every room in in this place and I could do that but then it's me redeeming for you but the Bible said you redeem the time you do it if you've lost it you go redeem it right and I've been reading this book lately actually listened to audio book I like this guy he's a Christian but he's really he's all about productivity and getting things done and it's really helped me it actually helped me write my book I'm gonna I'm gonna send my email maybe this week I'm gonna put a picture of his book in my book and hopefully he'll read my book cuz then he'll know about brother I doubt he will but you never know I want to thank him because he really helped me focus and cut out anything I didn't have to do and focus enough so I could still preach write a book so do YouTube videos do all these things cuz I cut out the things I didn't have to do now here's where he goes through these limiting beliefs now this is what you and now I've got to cast down see Satan might have gotten got into your life in a bad habit and now you just say I just don't have enough time to serve God don't raise your hands but how many have thought that this week I just don't have enough time to do what God wants me to do I really would like to invest in what God's called me to do but I just don't have enough time well this is me now this is not Michael hi you don't put bible scriptures in his books that's someone really Authority I got my books as God's Word right only Authority anybody has so instead of saying I don't enough time the fact is God gives everyone the same amount of time everyone has free time everyone whether it's five minutes on your phone or 10 minutes here in the morning 10 minutes before you go to bed everybody has free time god only expects you to invest your free time that you have in the talents that he's given you and remember you have to answer for them your dad's not gonna answer them your spinner wife's not gonna answer for your gifts God's given you gifts and you've got an answer for them so that excuse doesn't work well I don't have enough time no you you have time you have the same amount of time as we all have this is the one thing you can redeem church is the one thing you can do better this is the one time where you can be like I went to the enemy's camp and I took back what he stole from me I don't know how you can do that in other ways do you you can't do that with salvation you can't go get the Holy Ghost at your loss because you can't lose the Holy Ones to see them to the kingdom of God but it's the one thing that you can be like Joshua and go possess the land amen it used to be ours it used to be but we're taking it back were redeeming it back by the authority of God well I'm just not that discipline like you brother or sister you're just your sister you're so much more discipline than me I wasn't born that way see you were born to be disciplined huh well the Bible said you were born in sin and shapen in iniquity come to the world speaking lies are gonna be different today the Bible said you're shaped in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me the fact is were all born in sin the truth is that discipline or self-control is actually called temperance in the Bible the church said well this must be hittin a real weak spot which is good then we'll be a strong spot next week thank you all right well I'm just a discipline is you huh well last time I checked discipline is one of the one of the attributes that God adds to your character before listen to be before you get the Holy Ghost before and then after you get the Holy Ghost it's a fruit that everybody can see these grapes my look at these delicious bananas look at look at these peppers I like them too look at these my everybody can see the fruits from your life see the truth is that it must be added to you when you surrender your rights to the opposite thing so discipline comes to every Christian as long as they surrender their sensual desires and then the greater level of temperance after born-again is fruit of the Holy Spirit now remember this now I didn't want to do that okay so in order to get each attribute church remember what you have to do I preached this for you yeah I don't mean to go through all the steps so temperance is right here so before you get the Holy Ghost charity you got to die essential cravings that means self-control that means discipline you've got to be discipline and keep this body under discipline and that's the way the fourth step of getting to the Holy Ghost for the fourth that should be rather well you you're just born more discipline no you or I weren't born with it but it sure helped us God gave it just before we were born of the Holy Ghost Oh forgive me I happy now look God will give you discipline but you got to die out and say God forgive me I don't want ever want to do that again replace my less with obedience in order to get each blessing from God you got to die out too whenever the opposite temptation is if you want faith to be save guess what you've got to crucify your own belief right so tempers can be losing control and remember after you get the Holy Ghost then you program said have you go there to get the full armor of God then you start producing fruits of the spirit and one of those is discipline or more temperance as we serve God longer we should have more dedication to God more disciplined well I just can't get up early and pray well you got to take out that camp I'm going to start getting up early to pray by God's grace grace of Lord well I just can't read my Bible every day now it's gonna take that Kant out he's gonna take that posture fritti out I can read my Bible every Lord I can't witness like I ought to God's gonna take that can't doubt he's gonna put a can in there right it says as you grow as you become a Christian discipline is one of the main things involved you got to have that step four before you get the Holy Ghost and you got to have it after you get the Holy Ghost now I'm gonna skip this right well here let me yeah so this is a preaches three years ago so faith is assumptions need to choose the right way that's faith didn't say getting baptized virtues the strength to daily walk that way Rika's Ruth everybody saw her virtue she's a virtuous woman she didn't it publicly now it's just understanding that you need to know why you must walk this way I don't why do women wear skirts a wider band not cussin and jokes but tempers is a self-control we needed to remain on this way to beat your body and bring it under obedience to God's Word all right I'm trying to close bear with me what look at st. Peter judging by Andrew Andrews at prayer warrior just stayed on his knees all the time and the Apostle Peter was one of those firebrands that preached and Paul was more scholarly like like the Prophet or something and set back now I want to balance this out because it's true some people are born for different purposes Paul was born to be more scholarly to really understand the written word Andrew is born to be a prayer warrior that was going to be his major gift right but Paul was scowly not by denomination but by the Holy Ghost because he said I have been taught relations 1:12 I was taught the gospel by Jesus Christ in Arabia so some of us may be more prone to be more prayer warriors or you're more prone to have be a firebrand a fireball you're more prone to be a scholar like but all of us should have those attributes to be this discipline right here's another excuses well I'm just not that disciplined I wasn't born that way what about Philippians 4 when Paul Paul said I can do all things through Christ Church what was he talking about he was talking about not having enough food in jail look how Paul uses this scripture I don't run out of food it's gonna be cold all the winter I don't have a jacket I can do all things through Christ shoestring we're like it all right goodness can I handle this this cell phone I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me my honestly church think about this we said so much for big three because it's freely given because the gospel Jubilee trumpet has blown a many know it's God knew his leave behind the other one thanks Malachi I thought these batteries gonna go out today never know quite win never know the day or the hour right gotta be ready all the time thank you sir but look at look at the context here look at the context well I'm not that discipline well I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me my people say I could I could never handle seven children well I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I'm talking about people who just don't like children now I'm not talking about people that you know physically can't and God won't give them a miracle right all these excuses people make well I just can't I can never do that well it depends what it is if God calls you to do it if God's calling you to be no discipline if God's calling you to live closer to him then you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you the things that there's just each strength and we're straight come from poor and obedience I better say that too you can pray all day but if you don't obey God's Word your prayers did not pass the ceiling praise God that right about said Jesus that you pray to be in vain teaching for doctrines the commandments of men because they never would repent their prayers hit the ceiling boom back drop back down oh we want prayers that reach heaven like last Sunday sister Brenda that's the kind of prayers we want amen on an area that when we pray they go right through the ceiling amen straight to the white throne the golden throne of God and then Christ the intercessor intercedes mediax further is this the right time and father says yes and then the Sun the meteor sends the answer right back down there oh honey oh yeah thank God for that Amen Church you can do all things through Christ if Christ has called you to it you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you if this man could go without food or water hungry I know how to be full and hungry we know a lot about this we don't know a lot about that we know we don't know how this sufferer needs we don't know a lot about that but we do know about spiritual needs we need we need God we need to accept God's help for our spiritual needs well I'm not really in control of my time brother Jesse well that's because you may have let the devil play a trick and you know worship and your job right if you've let somebody take control of your time so much so your employer that you don't even control your time shame on you you're officially worshiping your job and that's called idolatry because the Bible said you redeem the time so repent pray for another job you may have made an idol out of a hobby relationship side Java all these things I don't have time to get closer to God you know you do you just got to go redeem it repent redeem back your rights well I tried to before brother Jesse didn't work well perhaps it wasn't the season that could be that could be one thing maybe it wasn't God's time and season the other reason because you haven't died out all the way right Church well I just I tried it well the last time I checked everybody that tried the day of Pentecost got the Holy Ghost and it started changing their life where people said you your life has been turned upside down amen hallelujah that's what everybody's family ought to say about you and I that if we only got the Holy Ghost something that happened to Bill Jesse and turned him upside down oh yeah because everybody there tried it and they liked it and it work for them that means it has to work for you and I today and then we got to come god it's provided way hallelujah Paul says Christians are dead to sin we cannot live any longer there and according to Roman's 6 1 & 2 lucubra Abraham says sandor feet I've ever stop right here yeah let me show how many slides I got here yeah I better stop right there man I got about 212 more slides there let me stop right here Malakai you come to the piano sir bad habits our demon spirits that have influenced our minds right if we say we don't have enough time I can't do this can't do that can I can't have a closer walk I'm not in control of my time then you can tell that devil say devil I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ it is written that I as a Christian can redeem the time because I know what the will of God is now then you'll feel like Jesus when he said it is written devil right you and I have that power that's one thing we can redeem I've looked at the word redeemed that's all I've ever found it says something that we can redeem praise God amen remember that Cobra had said he said I never didn't steal anything in our life except one thing and that's God's time he stole one thing he never stole money he never sold magazines he never stole food he said stole one thing that was God's time for my life my God's free time the free time rather would rather God had given me that I was supposed to devote to him and I didn't use it for him I'm sorry here's the last quote we need to go back to the power of God something that can do the same thing today brother BAM says about the Jubilee persecution always gives strength to the church we've had it too easy we get slothful we get the place where we don't want to move on you never been there don't feel like moving on with God because everything just handed to us the hamster takes sorrow tears sweat and prayer and faith and promise to move forward in the power of the Holy Spirit everybody repeat after me everybody say sorrow that's the first thing it takes to move on with God everybody say tears everybody say sweat everybody say prayer everybody say faith everybody say promise man I'm just quoting him I'm not trying to make a doctrine on those six things I tell you I'll get you anointed six is the number of anointed man that I'll get you know me too right there you start playing you start sorrow and tears sweating up glory pretty soon you're gonna be anointed but man said that zeal and power that they had in those days has long time vanished from our assemblies I'm afraid if the windows would be shot out again people run every way and never come back again he's talking about how they would shoot at Windows and Pentecost but the people would stay there and the bullets wouldn't kill people because the power of God was so strong there my goodness now Church let's bow our heads for a moment here that's what I felt letting the Holy Spirit on as I read that text my a man could redeem it back before the Jubilee he didn't have to have a Jubilee to get it back although it was a blessing it was freely given by grace but if he had a season where he could recognize we'll listen God's blessed me I can go by that I can redeem that myself all's he had to do was take that money go that individual show them the paperwork well listen I'm a Judah person I'm from the tribe of Judah this is my land I sold to you last year I want it back give it back and that man had to give it back [Music] now as we bow our heads how many would raise your hand say brother Jessie pray me that I'll be able to move on with God that I can redeem some of the time back to God Church maybe you won't get all of it today or tomorrow but you can start
