[0:02] the privilege and honor to be sure
[0:07] appreciates Lord and devil tried to take
[0:10] me out and been real sick for the last
[0:14] couple days here but feel better this
[0:17] morning and one thing I do love about
[0:20] the Ministry of the word is when you get
[0:22] that anointing on you you feel a lot
[0:23] better so we're looking forward to
[0:28] bringing forth this little message this
[0:29] morning for you it's like I said I sure
[0:32] love you love my brother here and the
[0:34] work that God is doing you know there's
[0:37] nothing in vain but God has predestined
[0:41] season and predestinated move and we ran
[0:45] under expectation for great things
[0:47] amen if we have any other expectation
[0:50] where we're missing the mark it must be
[0:53] a complete revelation that this word is
[0:56] going to manifest and then I trust it is
[1:00] amen so with that being spoke let's go
[1:03] ahead and open up our Bibles I'm going
[1:04] to bring just a little message here try
[1:06] to bridge a few things together
[1:13] second Samuel 6:1 there we go
[1:24] greetings from living waters Tabernacle
[1:27] our home church we've been watching the
[1:29] Lord do wonderful things a couple months
[1:31] ago we watched we watched the Lord heal
[1:35] sister Megan Nalin of stage 4
[1:38] non-hodgkins lymphoma she showed it to
[1:42] me before she went it was on her is on
[1:45] her leg down here and I was about size
[1:48] of a softball coming off there and she
[1:51] went down there and to to the hospital
[1:53] they pretty much told her they're gonna
[1:55] have to cut her leg off from right here
[1:56] and that was something you're gonna have
[1:59] to do very quickly but they said first
[2:02] they're going to try to do some chemo on
[2:04] her so she did the chemo and anyway what
[2:07] long story short what had happened was
[2:09] she she went through the chemo and she
[2:13] said
[2:13] I'm done I can't do any more I'm gonna
[2:15] trust God
[2:16] so she come home and that weekend she
[2:20] come up she said I got to show you
[2:21] something she says it doesn't even hurt
[2:23] anymore and she showed me that spot it
[2:26] was completely gone so so here's the
[2:29] kicker about him about three weeks ago
[2:32] maybe even less she had passed out at
[2:36] home because she was dehydrated and she
[2:39] went to they took her to the hospital
[2:42] and they said they looked at her file
[2:45] and they said they said well sure you
[2:47] got we know exactly what's happened the
[2:49] cancer has spread to your brain now and
[2:52] you're not gonna make it and you're just
[2:55] actually looking at the signs of your
[2:57] neglect to go through chemo and she said
[2:59] well that candy said because God healed
[3:02] me and anyway so what happened was she
[3:04] are they said well they said well we're
[3:07] gonna do a scan on you none we're going
[3:10] to show you that the cancers moved
[3:11] throughout your body and so pretty much
[3:14] she said you'd go right ahead and do
[3:16] that and she's how she says she said I
[3:17] told him she said do you all find
[3:18] nothing so she had that threat thrown
[3:23] right in her face just lying lying
[3:25] Vanity's of the devil and sure enough
[3:27] they they did the scan on her and she
[3:29] she came back and and they were kind of
[3:32] down when they came back and they said
[3:33] well you don't have any cancer from that
[3:36] tonight so I it's love Lord again know
[3:45] the tender love of Jesus Christ but
[3:49] anyway just sure love Lord here second
[3:54] Samuel 6:1 don't mean to keep you
[3:56] standing I'm gonna try to bring a
[3:59] thought this morning I trust it will
[4:00] help you second Samuel 6:1 it says again
[4:05] David gathered together all the chosen
[4:08] men of Israel thirty thousand and David
[4:12] arose and went with all the people that
[4:14] were with him from bale of Judah to
[4:17] bring up from thence the Ark of God
[4:20] whose name is called by the name of the
[4:22] Lord of Hosts that dwelleth between
[4:26] the cherubs and then let's go ahead bow
[4:28] our heads for a word of Prayer
[4:30] our most beloved Jesus Christ how we
[4:34] love you our Lord and Savior and we just
[4:37] appreciate Lord what your anointing in
[4:39] this area Oh God as far as the order
[4:42] you're getting this little move here Oh
[4:44] God crying out for you and surely Oh God
[4:48] it's not in vain Oh God and Lord it's
[4:51] going to bring forth that which it was
[4:54] called to do Lord and so Lord we're
[4:56] looking for great things we're looking
[4:57] for healings we're looking for revival
[5:00] we're looking for more of you to be made
[5:03] known in our myths God I'm looking for a
[5:04] healing right now Lord and Lord we
[5:07] believe oh god that surely oh gone
[5:09] because you're here that means that all
[5:13] things are possible so we're looking for
[5:15] that today Oh God realizing that Oh God
[5:19] if this service was predestinated from
[5:21] the foundation of the world it has a
[5:23] purpose and Lord we're asking that now
[5:26] as the sowing of the word comes forth
[5:28] man to accomplish the end then it was
[5:30] sent forward and we're just believing of
[5:33] God that everything that he said would
[5:34] be of you Lord and surely O God that you
[5:37] would Oh God just bring this little
[5:39] thought or revelation to your people
[5:41] that they might be able to climb higher
[5:42] into this thought in the name of Jesus
[5:45] Christ the church says together amen man
[5:48] you may be seated
[5:54] we're going to preach a thought today
[5:57] Minister this long time ago at home and
[6:00] I'm a bridge bridge over a bunch of
[6:01] things together here hopefully we can
[6:03] get this out to you but I want to work
[6:05] with this idea moving into a revival
[6:10] with the ark all right moving into a
[6:14] revival with the ark would just begin to
[6:18] go through this of course in the Old
[6:21] Testament God and ordained that they
[6:24] would build for Moses for the the temple
[6:28] that they would build the Ark of the
[6:30] Covenant and you know perhaps there is
[6:33] no other if I could say furniture that
[6:38] was designated
[6:39] God is supernatural furniture that God
[6:41] had provided with a mercy seat
[6:43] there was nothing as living in the Old
[6:46] Testament as this art was remember this
[6:49] Ark it was so powerful that it would
[6:51] want you and spread and spread the
[6:54] Jordan River so Joshua could walk over
[6:56] right and then they would go into the
[6:58] house of the Philistines in luck it
[7:00] would drop daggone right in his face a
[7:03] lot you see this art it was a perfect
[7:06] time in the Old Testament of the living
[7:09] word itself amen hallelujah and I want
[7:12] you to know that if it's tight like that
[7:14] in the Old Testament it's the same word
[7:17] in the New Testament he met all of the
[7:20] assault notice as long as they were
[7:23] following that Ark of the Covenant they
[7:25] were going to be all right there's
[7:27] nothing that could stop them there is
[7:28] nothing that could hurt them but they
[7:31] had to keep the ark before them and then
[7:34] now I want us to if we can must start
[7:38] going through this because I I want to
[7:39] land us in real fit today in first
[7:41] chronicles 13 lon so remember here that
[7:47] now David is taking over for Saul and
[7:50] Saul had the opportunity salt could have
[7:53] brought the ark back but remember Saul
[7:57] was a type of the denomination Saul
[8:01] didn't launch the ark all right he
[8:03] wasn't interested in having the ark in
[8:06] his nest he was okay with the art being
[8:09] somewhere else and but notice when it
[8:13] came to David David had a motive that he
[8:16] was trying to live out all right first
[8:18] chronicles 13 1 it says and David
[8:21] consulted with the captains of thousands
[8:23] and hundreds with every leader and David
[8:26] said unto all the congregation of Israel
[8:27] if it seemed good unto you and that it
[8:30] be of the Lord our God let us send the
[8:33] brog onto our brother and everywhere
[8:35] that are left in all the land of Israel
[8:38] and with them also to the priests and
[8:40] Levites are in their cities and suburbs
[8:42] that they may gather themselves unto us
[8:45] and let us bring the Ark of our God to
[8:50] us for we enquire
[8:52] not at it in the days of saw now notice
[8:57] that arc was to be inquired of if you
[9:02] needed an answer you could go to the RK
[9:05] men and the arc would bring forth that
[9:08] answer to you mayhem but notice here it
[9:11] says and all the congregation said that
[9:15] they would do so for the thing was right
[9:17] in the eyes of all the people how
[9:22] couldn't they see this and now we see
[9:27] the scripture letting out that all they
[9:29] really wanted they wanted the Living
[9:31] Word back in their midst
[9:35] they wanted a God that could lead them
[9:37] by the word even turn that arca come it
[9:40] was the word right and so a lot right we
[9:45] want the living mark in our midst and in
[9:48] so notice what happened so the fifth
[9:51] verse says so David gathered all Israel
[9:54] together from she or of Egypt even until
[9:57] the entry of her mouth to bring the Ark
[10:00] of God from George F Jairam Amen so now
[10:04] what they're bringing forth a revival is
[10:08] what they're doing you see they've had
[10:11] enough of an experience with the Living
[10:15] Word not being present and so David is
[10:19] now bringing the revelation well if we
[10:22] want the word to be alive and on this
[10:24] we've got to bring the word forth all
[10:28] right so now trying to do God a service
[10:30] about me as well it says now his
[10:33] intention was good his motive was good
[10:38] his objective was good and to bring a
[10:41] revival in the city bring the people
[10:45] back to God oh ha but he never consulted
[10:49] the way God told him to do it see
[10:53] so was David right in wanting the living
[10:58] Werner in back with him absolutely
[11:01] but he didn't consult God how to do it
[11:06] Oh hallelujah
[11:09] so even all the people grade in the
[11:13] priests that the king was right they
[11:15] needed the art back in the city now they
[11:19] needed the presence of God are you
[11:21] catching that if the Living Word is in
[11:24] our myths then the presence of the
[11:26] Living God is here amen that means you
[11:29] can believe right now whatever the need
[11:32] is on your heart that God will bring it
[11:33] to you and then you don't need just an
[11:36] arc of the cover to look at but we have
[11:38] the Word of God and then it's a
[11:41] vindicated message and it hasn't failed
[11:43] yet amen so notice they needed the
[11:51] presence of God I wonder if we sit in
[11:53] the same spot today and say I need the
[11:54] presence of God more in my life he said
[11:58] they needed a revival but God had not
[12:02] promised to reveal his word and it sees
[12:05] into the people's he never promised to
[12:08] reveal it to the King in the season God
[12:11] doesn't change a bit he didn't promise
[12:13] to do that no matter how sincere and
[12:17] what good motives and what good
[12:19] objectives and how people want those
[12:22] things and see the need of it there is a
[12:25] will of God to be carried out in these
[12:28] things that's what I want to drive down
[12:32] tight for I want to make this so that
[12:35] you have to see if the Spirit of God
[12:38] dwells in you
[12:40] mm-hmm and that's the reason I'm
[12:43] lingering so long hearing then so what
[12:46] we are looking to see whether the Spirit
[12:50] of God be dwelling in us because
[12:53] remember who's the temple of God now you
[12:58] are then where's the Living Word at
[13:01] right there right inside of you all
[13:05] right we're going to bridge this quick
[13:08] second samuel 6:1 here we're going to
[13:12] jump to the 3rd verse I want you to see
[13:15] this second samuel 6 3 it says and they
[13:18] set the ark of
[13:19] upon a new cart right and brought it out
[13:24] of the house of abinadab that was in
[13:28] Gabi ax and user and Ohio the sons of
[13:34] abinadab drave the new cars and they
[13:38] brought it out of the house of abinadab
[13:40] which was at Gibeah accompanying the Ark
[13:43] of God in Ohio went before the ark
[13:47] alright so notice what they're doing
[13:49] they're bringing forth the word all
[13:52] right
[13:53] but notice what they're doing they set
[13:56] it on a new cart there's the picture
[13:59] there the ark sitting on this new cart
[14:04] and obviously we know what happens here
[14:09] let's look very quickly where did Israel
[14:11] even get this idea at the first samuel
[14:14] six seven says that now therefore make a
[14:18] new cart and take two milk i'm on which
[14:22] there have come no yoke and tie the kind
[14:25] of the car and bring their calves home
[14:27] from then and take the ark of the lord
[14:29] and lay it upon the cart and put the
[14:33] jewels of gold which you return him for
[14:36] a trespass offering in a coffer by the
[14:39] side there out and send it away that it
[14:42] may go now in that interesting that when
[14:45] it came down to david bringing forth the
[14:49] ark of the covenant trying to get a
[14:52] revival back in the city
[14:53] he places about a new car but he was
[14:56] actually taking a Philistine idea
[15:04] remember what were the philistines
[15:06] remember they had Dagon or the fish
[15:09] later catholicism they're holding the
[15:15] creeds so what was this this was a creed
[15:18] coming forth and david and allow this
[15:22] creed to come forth with them so what
[15:25] are you saying that brother Chester if
[15:27] you want a revival you have to see that
[15:33] the
[15:33] word is coming forth in the right way
[15:37] all right
[15:40] notice again he says Christ is our art
[15:43] the word they want their denomination he
[15:47] cannot notice cannot be carried on the
[15:50] new cars of the denominations his
[15:55] message cannot go on the core of a new
[15:58] denomination when it's supposed to be
[16:00] born and come on the heart of a prophet
[16:04] it cannot he promised it it would be
[16:07] thus and that's the way it must be amen
[16:11] this word can only come forth in a
[16:15] living manner when it's accepted the
[16:18] right way it was sown through the
[16:20] property men many people are trying to
[16:24] make it say this and they can say that
[16:25] but it must line up 100% with the Word
[16:29] of God in it don't follow though message
[16:32] doctrine off some quote amen you have to
[16:35] line it up with the Lord amen and if you
[16:38] do then there is a revival that's
[16:41] knocking at the door and then so it
[16:47] makes you wonder when we look at
[16:50] basically the driest time in the history
[16:54] of our world in this Laodicea that we're
[16:57] living in right now what has actually
[16:59] happened there's been what people are
[17:04] trying to get revivals but how are they
[17:07] doing how they doing it are they doing
[17:10] it the proper way or are they doing it
[17:14] in a way that it actually kills the
[17:17] Spirit of God that they're inviting you
[17:20] see what I'm saying because I don't care
[17:24] how dry it is our God can bring rain it
[17:31] doesn't matter how how quiet everything
[17:35] feels and looks if we want God to come
[17:39] on the scene and we cry out to our God
[17:42] he says
[17:43] he would heal our land he would answer
[17:45] our prayers if we take him out of his
[17:49] word it will produce the right thing
[17:52] amen
[17:53] so notice what really is this this arc
[17:57] then it's Christ so that's why you go
[18:01] through the whole Testament every time
[18:02] you see the ark it'll tie right in with
[18:05] Jesus Christ
[18:06] Alleluia so now let's get to the breech
[18:10] here
[18:10] second Samuel 67 and the anger of the
[18:13] Lord was kindled against use them and
[18:16] God smote him there for his heir and
[18:20] there he died by the ark and David was
[18:25] displeased because the Lord had made a
[18:28] breach upon user and he called the name
[18:31] of the place para Zuza to this day and
[18:34] David was afraid of the Lord that day
[18:36] and said how shall the art of the Lord
[18:40] come to me all he wanted was a revival
[18:48] that's all he wanted but he was trying
[18:56] to bring the revival forth with a creed
[18:58] in it I'm just gonna say this brother
[19:01] sister we're never gonna get another
[19:03] revival unless we are living in the pure
[19:06] work amen
[19:10] that's exactly right it's exactly right
[19:13] we're in transition right now you better
[19:15] be in it amen
[19:16] but notice it says so David would not
[19:20] remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into
[19:23] the City of David but David carried it
[19:25] aside into the house of obed-edom the
[19:28] guillotines event so why yes he did not
[19:32] continue to bring the Ark in but when
[19:34] user actually touch the ark and it
[19:36] killed him he said how am I gonna get
[19:40] this art to me how am I gonna get the
[19:42] word to me I wonder if we're looking at
[19:46] our lives today and we're saying how am
[19:48] I going to get this Living Word to me
[19:51] how am I going to get this living lawyer
[19:54] Foley expressing from my being
[19:57] Oh hallelujah we could go to the message
[20:00] and find that your prophecy he said we
[20:03] should never let the spirit of revival
[20:05] die amen
[20:08] we should always be hungry for revival
[20:12] amen hallelujah it's not a bad learning
[20:16] and it's not a Pentecostal word anything
[20:18] the word revival means that you have
[20:20] left a dead state and you are alive amen
[20:24] we don't want a dead experience we want
[20:28] a living experience with God that's
[20:30] producing the fruit that the Father
[20:32] desires amen amen
[20:36] so now second Samuel six eleven I want
[20:42] you to see this and the Ark of the Lord
[20:47] continued in the house of obededom the
[20:49] gittite three months and the Lord
[20:54] blessed obed-edom and all his household
[20:57] that's something just bring the ark into
[21:00] your house just put the word in your
[21:03] house and it will bless every facet of
[21:09] your house amen amen
[21:11] play the Bible in your house and then
[21:14] pray in your house play the message amen
[21:18] so in spiritual things and this art will
[21:22] produce blessings they men now isn't
[21:26] that something that God had to send it
[21:28] to a guitar but this get tight his house
[21:32] was matched but then Israel they were
[21:39] cursed because they were trying to bring
[21:44] the word forth in a way that was against
[21:47] the word oh we better be careful god
[21:52] help us
[21:53] so notice so David he gets a little fire
[21:56] up in his life I remember he just stated
[21:59] how can I get the art to come on to us
[22:02] how can this happen how are we going to
[22:05] do this so notice I can only imagine the
[22:10] blessings that
[22:11] come to a Benetton's house because
[22:13] notice the blessings were so great in
[22:15] the 12th verse it was told King David
[22:19] saying the Lord had blessed the house of
[22:22] obed-edom and all that pertain is unto
[22:24] him because of the Ark of God hallelujah
[22:30] his substance was gaining amen
[22:33] everything in his life was growing
[22:36] abundantly Amen oh my I wonder if we
[22:40] have the Living Word and on this it
[22:42] should produce amen
[22:46] so notice so David went and brought up
[22:50] the Ark of God from the house of
[22:52] obed-edom into the City of David with
[22:57] gladness so David said God your blessing
[23:03] him surely this blessing can come by our
[23:09] way now I want you to see this because a
[23:14] revelation really unfolds here okay now
[23:19] let's go here first chronicles 15 1 so
[23:25] David catches the revelation and we're
[23:29] not done with this I want you to we're
[23:30] going to we're going to take a look at
[23:31] this and it says and David made him
[23:34] houses in the City of David and prepared
[23:37] a place for the Ark of God and pitched
[23:39] for it a tent
[23:41] then said David none ought to carry the
[23:45] Ark of God but the Levites for them hath
[23:51] the Lord chosen to carry the Ark of God
[23:54] and to minister unto him for ever and
[24:02] David gathered all Israel to Jerusalem
[24:05] to bring up the Ark of the Lord unto his
[24:09] place which he had prepared forth
[24:13] alright
[24:13] so now David saying well we can have
[24:17] this revival and somewhere along this
[24:20] thought process the Lord must have
[24:22] revealed it
[24:23] to him that wait a minute why is this
[24:26] thing on a cart to begin with you can't
[24:31] put the word on a new revelation that's
[24:33] unscriptural you can't put a living art
[24:38] in the midst of dead creed and
[24:41] denominational spirit we cannot pass any
[24:45] organizational spirit we have to be
[24:49] militant against organization Oh
[24:52] hallelujah that's the way it started
[24:55] that's the way it finishes in EM we must
[24:58] be so militant that we only prescribe
[25:02] the word to be carried over a Levites
[25:05] heart even and this word was meant to be
[25:10] carried over in your heart amen now
[25:13] notice Deuteronomy 10 8 it says at that
[25:20] time the Lord separated the tribe of
[25:22] Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant the
[25:27] Lord to stand before the Lord to
[25:29] minister unto him and to bless his name
[25:32] unto this day now
[25:34] we could run this type all the way
[25:36] because remember the Levites are a type
[25:38] of the bride and who is the one who's
[25:43] ordained to carry the ark the Levites
[25:47] the only one that's really ordained to
[25:52] carry the Living Word is the Levites
[25:54] amen that's why in the scripture says
[25:58] that ye our God hath made new kings and
[26:00] priests amen hallelujah you're not just
[26:04] a king but you're a priest and your
[26:06] prophets that you're offering spiritual
[26:08] sacrifices under God even hallelujah
[26:11] that's why brother sister when you look
[26:14] at the Levites role it's a Levites role
[26:17] to worship God in them hallelujah it's a
[26:22] Levites jobs a lot to do the ministerial
[26:26] work to bring forth God in their midst
[26:29] amen
[26:32] you see how can we how do we have so
[26:35] many Levites but nobody wants to worship
[26:42] by the law they had to worship I knew
[26:52] you that's why I was enjoying the
[26:53] worship here earlier Laurie you guys
[26:56] having a timeout here amen
[26:58] but that's what you're ordained to do
[27:00] but notice if you're not doing it you're
[27:03] showing you're not only vice you don't
[27:06] matter what your voice sounds like it
[27:08] doesn't matter how much you think you
[27:11] can't do it or you're tired or whatever
[27:12] do a call to bring forth please and
[27:15] there are God in it amen and that's one
[27:19] of the main issues because the scripture
[27:21] says that God inhabits the praises of
[27:24] his people amen
[27:25] no praise no one haven't sent him here
[27:30] unless you bring your whole heart and
[27:33] worship amen amen
[27:37] I was just I was just at a place the
[27:41] other day and and I I was I was sitting
[27:44] there and their worship was going on and
[27:47] I was thinking to myself I said I said
[27:51] they can sing but he's not a worshiper
[27:56] an individual can sing but he's not a
[27:59] worshiper but then you watch if that
[28:01] person is not a worshiper who's leading
[28:03] worship he won't lead the people into
[28:06] worship he might make it sound nice but
[28:11] he won't be in the spirit of worship
[28:17] Kohala louia remember God's or gain way
[28:22] to bring forth the victory he would
[28:27] ordain that lot that worship would have
[28:30] to go forth
[28:33] right that's how our services are lined
[28:36] up you open up service and you want you
[28:40] begin to worship amen because why that
[28:44] invites God in your miss you wanna
[28:47] remember I bought you can ever Bible
[28:48] worship service amen and then watch
[28:51] because you've invited God though God
[28:54] will come down and what you live right
[28:56] through the word right that's what they
[29:01] did when they had to go around they had
[29:03] to go around on Jericho they had to want
[29:08] they had to send forth all all the music
[29:12] and everything going before leading the
[29:15] archon and that's when the walls of
[29:21] their life it's are tumbling down the
[29:24] struggles in their life how do you think
[29:27] that Pentecost the turn of of the 19 or
[29:31] the 20th century how do you think that
[29:33] that that God so manifested their
[29:35] because they worshiped they didn't have
[29:37] the revelation of this word but you see
[29:41] we don't lose worship because we have a
[29:43] revelation
[29:44] the revelation should only make it
[29:47] stronger I don't know why I'm going this
[29:48] way stop I know but I hope you get that
[29:51] amen because that true worship will
[29:54] bring forth the Holy Ghost in the power
[29:57] of his resurrection he then so now Dean
[30:03] even notices here that what he tried to
[30:08] bring forth this revival with a the ark
[30:14] on a cart and he had worship he had
[30:17] everything just right all the emotion of
[30:20] a real revival but he was off the word
[30:25] so you see how that works you can have
[30:29] the worship ride but if you don't have
[30:31] the word right you won't get your
[30:34] revival
[30:36] [Music]
[30:38] so what does he do he commands them and
[30:40] says let the Levites put this Ark on
[30:45] their shoulders so they carry this Ark I
[30:52] want you to see this this is very
[30:55] beautiful here because quite often we we
[30:58] look and if you look in the scripture
[31:01] you'll find that the picture is always a
[31:03] little bit more it's a little bit more
[31:06] deep in the thought of what it is now
[31:08] notice this in first chronicles 1511 it
[31:14] setting David called for zadok and
[31:17] abiathar the priest and for the Levi's
[31:19] for urea as ayah joel shamaya eleo in a
[31:26] minute ab and said unto them ye are the
[31:31] chief of the fathers of the Levites
[31:36] sanctify yourselves both ye and your
[31:40] brother that you may bring up the art of
[31:44] the Lord God of Israel unto the place
[31:48] that I have prepared for it now look at
[31:53] this for because because he did it not
[32:01] at the first the Lord our God made a
[32:08] breach upon us for that we sought him
[32:11] not after the due order if you want a
[32:16] revival it has to be done in a do order
[32:21] oh my
[32:24] so notice not just the new cart was an
[32:28] issue but there was more that was an
[32:34] issue and by the scripture here we see
[32:39] that David also commands the Levi's and
[32:42] he said you have to be sanctified
[32:49] Oh hallelujah but let me say this for
[32:52] any of what's gonna sanctify you more
[32:54] than anything else the blood of Jesus
[32:57] Christ amen
[32:59] you will never ever live a perfect walk
[33:03] in this flesh you're promising many
[33:05] times a day your backside amen
[33:08] but the blood of Jesus Christ amen oh
[33:14] think about a brother sister that the
[33:17] blood of bulls and goats was so strong
[33:20] that you could what it could call the
[33:23] plagues down on Egypt your prophet said
[33:31] he said he said that God brought the
[33:34] thought to Moses his mind it was the
[33:37] literal thought of God that rolled into
[33:39] Moses mind and he said let there be
[33:41] flies and your father said he said that
[33:49] was under the blood of bulls and goats
[33:54] he was sanctified enough through the
[33:58] blood of bulls and goats that he could
[34:00] speak for water and frogs and everything
[34:04] else would come now oh it's a revelation
[34:06] of the blood of Jesus Christ in our
[34:09] lives amen
[34:10] I was just telling the church the other
[34:14] day you think about it under the blood
[34:17] of bulls and goats you realize that God
[34:22] could bring a rapture to Enoch oh wow we
[34:35] should raise our confidence up to
[34:39] realize that the blood of Jesus Christ
[34:42] is so much stronger so much greater
[34:47] there's not a sin
[34:51] cannot dispel mmm but when the word said
[34:55] that as the East is from the West
[34:58] so tell your sins be hallelujah God
[35:06] cannot even find them Oh blessed is the
[35:11] man whom God will not impute iniquity a
[35:13] born amen
[35:15] don't you see that if the blood is this
[35:19] strong that he can watch get a revival
[35:22] in your myths that blood paid for your
[35:25] revival that blood pay for that spirit
[35:32] of revival to never be able to leave in
[35:34] your life right think about the third
[35:38] seal because that's what remember it was
[35:42] the statement of Jesus Christ that said
[35:46] what a Satan you cannot hurt the oil on
[35:49] the wine you can't touch it you can't
[35:53] touch you can't hold it there's no
[35:57] reason that you should feel like you
[35:59] have a hurt experience there's no reason
[36:03] why you should feel that you don't have
[36:05] the stimulation of Revelation you make
[36:09] God preaching then you bring the Holy
[36:11] Ghost ileena he loves you so much that
[36:18] he died for you so that he could answer
[36:21] your every cry of your heart whoo so
[36:30] look at the issue as it comes forth not
[36:36] just was it wrongly placed on a new card
[36:41] but the Levites were no longer
[36:43] sanctified you see you can't even have
[36:49] the Levites carry the the ark unless
[36:53] their sanctify you say so what do you
[37:01] think God's trying to do
[37:02] he's trying to bring his church into a
[37:05] humble laughs for him so that what
[37:10] they'll say there everything else is I
[37:12] and they'll say god I let my life go
[37:16] this is all about you it's that simple
[37:20] but you see what it is so now it's not
[37:25] just that it has to be paired on the the
[37:28] the shoulders of the Levite but they
[37:31] have to be clean they then the due order
[37:36] said you should have done it the first
[37:37] time so notice says now notice in this
[37:50] now David thought he had everything in
[37:53] order and he was inspired see how the
[37:59] Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's
[38:05] got to be in the order of the anointing
[38:13] the outside spirit can be anointed with
[38:17] the Holy Ghost and the soul as dark as
[38:20] pitch the cocklebur rolls on the same
[38:25] water that bill puts life into the wheat
[38:28] puts life into the cocklebur but at the
[38:32] bottom of the cocklebur
[38:33] it's a cocklebur life it's rejoicing and
[38:36] blooming and got life and doing
[38:38] everything that the wheat does but the
[38:41] soul of it is a cocklebur see false
[38:45] teachers can rise teaching all kind of
[38:49] trinitarianism and everything else and
[38:50] be anointed with the Holy Ghost and
[38:53] perform just as many miracles as a true
[38:57] gospel can but by the word here that's
[39:00] what does it see what I mean oh my
[39:04] hallelujah you have to see are you
[39:08] inspired looking for a revival right now
[39:11] hey man why why would it be wrong
[39:16] not one revival or I would be wrong -
[39:19] one revival it camping because remember
[39:23] if this spirit that was in Christ being
[39:26] you it shall also quicken your mortal
[39:28] body
[39:30] it's a quickening spirit did you know
[39:33] that the word quickened and revived
[39:35] means the same thing if that's saying
[39:41] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[39:44] dwell in you
[39:45] dwelling you it shall also quicken your
[39:50] mortal mind it's gonna quicken you oh my
[39:57] hallelujah it's gonna bring life inside
[40:01] of you amen hallelujah it doesn't matter
[40:05] if it felt like you left it long ago
[40:07] today is your day for revival amen
[40:10] hallelujah Oh hallelujah crowds they got
[40:14] let a good greater every meeting every
[40:18] service let the power of God come amen
[40:24] hallelujah that's what he's really
[40:27] wanting to do he's wanting to turn every
[40:31] assembly that will get assigned to him
[40:32] into a living moving organism of Jesus
[40:35] Christ with power power
[40:42] amen amen
[40:46] but notice so the order has to be right
[40:51] if it's a cocklebur order and ain't
[40:53] gonna work right they can be anointed
[40:56] but it's always going to bring forth the
[40:58] wrong thing but the revelation should be
[41:03] telling you ain't no cocklebur here
[41:08] right your prophet said if there's one
[41:10] you be that one
[41:15] hallelujah so now they've been commanded
[41:20] to do this and look at what happens here
[41:24] in 1st chronicles 15 14 so the priest
[41:27] and
[41:28] the Levites sanctified themselves to
[41:32] bring up the Ark of the Lord God of
[41:35] Israel oh my so they did it well I
[41:42] wonder if it's going to work this time I
[41:45] wonder if the revival is going to work
[41:48] now that it's done in the right order
[41:52] many revivals have fallen flat because
[41:57] they have the wrong motives the wrong
[41:59] objectives but where the heart is
[42:05] looking for the right thing it'll come
[42:09] just as certain as we're standing here
[42:11] and the children of the Levites bear the
[42:14] Ark of God upon their shoulders with the
[42:16] stage there are as Moses commanded
[42:18] according to the word of the Lord in
[42:22] them so they had the anointed word the
[42:25] anointed commandment and what they
[42:27] followed that commandment oh my I wonder
[42:31] what happens now look at this numbers
[42:36] eight five we'll come back down to the
[42:40] purification here and the Lord spake
[42:41] unto Moses saying take the Levites from
[42:43] among the children of Israel and cleanse
[42:45] them and thus shall pout do unto them to
[42:48] cleanse and sprinkle water of purifying
[42:50] upon them let them shave all their flesh
[42:53] and let them wash their clothes and so
[42:55] make themselves clean then let them take
[42:58] a young boy and his meat offering even
[43:02] fine flour mingled with oil and another
[43:07] young bullet shalt thou take for a sin
[43:09] offering so this the the offering had to
[43:14] be wot this was a real deal they had to
[43:17] put some effort forth it wasn't just oh
[43:20] well I'll just try it and try a little
[43:22] bit here but no it was a set order to
[43:25] get them sanctified before God sometimes
[43:29] you got to sit there and look at those
[43:31] habits of those things that bind you
[43:33] down and you got to sit there and say
[43:36] God I need to be purified of this
[43:38] don't just go to say Oh God purify me
[43:41] and then stop give God a minute right
[43:48] but we need to put an effort forth to
[43:52] see if we're earnestly contending for
[43:54] this faith amen
[44:03] so now look
[44:04] second Samuel six thirteen so now
[44:08] they're bringing the ark for but look at
[44:11] now David is putting something else in
[44:13] here and it was so that when they bear
[44:16] the Ark of the Lord had gone six paces
[44:20] paces he sacrificed oxen and fat legs so
[44:27] notice they go six steps and then what
[44:32] then they bring out the sacrifice right
[44:36] before them so they had six steps and
[44:39] then the seventh step was blood
[44:46] hallelujah alright now I wonder if
[44:50] they're having a real revival this seven
[44:54] Church age is all about blood it's all
[44:57] about blood that's where everyone's
[44:59] missing it we can't miss it because it's
[45:07] all about remember your prophet said
[45:11] what'd he say he said that the foolish
[45:13] virgins missed the rapture because they
[45:16] didn't have the fullness of the
[45:17] atonement they didn't have a revelation
[45:21] of the blood they were virgins but what
[45:26] they didn't trust the blood that's
[45:29] really what it is because if you trust
[45:32] anything outside of blood you are going
[45:35] to be lost the blood holds your rapture
[45:41] the blood holds your peace it holds your
[45:44] healing today it holds what your
[45:47] strength and your power
[45:49] the breath gave you all of it oh I can
[45:59] only imagine what's going on here they
[46:02] sacrifice now the option and fatlings
[46:06] and the 14th scripture says in David
[46:10] danced before the Lord with a quarter of
[46:16] his mind just a little bit no the Bible
[46:21] doesn't lie the Bible stated that David
[46:25] danced with all of his mind
[46:30] and David was girded with a linen ephod
[46:35] so David and all the house of Israel
[46:38] brought up the Ark of the Lord was
[46:40] shouting and with the sound of the
[46:43] trumpet hold on don't you see that this
[46:49] is all coming down to the sounding of
[46:52] this last trumpet don't you think when
[46:56] the ark that living word don't worry
[46:59] there's fine identifications of that
[47:01] firm pole that's getting ready to live
[47:03] out on you there's an anointing a former
[47:07] ladder rain pouring up don't worry it's
[47:15] coming but what is it do we think that
[47:24] we're gonna undo everything and live it
[47:27] in any other order David he danced with
[47:31] all his might we could go whole sermon
[47:36] on this alright remember brother
[47:41] branham's he used to say he's the thing
[47:43] that dancing was wrong he said one one
[47:48] one day that woman was out dancing
[47:50] dancing in the aisle there if he was our
[47:51] New Year's Eve night or something and
[47:53] brother branham was out there and he
[47:56] said he said he looked over and he and
[47:59] he said why is she doing there
[48:03] and then the Holy Ghost spoke to him and
[48:06] said if you had victory like she had you
[48:11] would be out there this is my favorite
[48:15] part because I'm the Prophet said he
[48:17] said then I looked down and my methodist
[48:18] foot got this happen then he said before
[48:24] he do it he was out in the aisle dancing
[48:27] with that woman but don't you see it
[48:33] dancing is not it's not it's not defeat
[48:37] dancing shows you pepper victory Amen
[48:42] hallelujah
[48:45] don't you see that's what David had here
[48:48] he had the victory the ark had come
[48:51] forth now and it had been accepted right
[48:56] see if you want a revival you got to
[48:59] want everything that goes with it you
[49:04] got to be willing say God because here's
[49:07] the thing you don't control yourself
[49:08] anyway well you're not supposed to who
[49:13] controls you God does and if God
[49:15] controlled you what's he gonna have you
[49:17] doing he'll have you do the things that
[49:20] you don't normally do that's what he
[49:24] does
[49:26] so notice they brought the ark up with
[49:31] shouting and the sound of a trumpet all
[49:35] that excitement bringing the Living Word
[49:38] forth got there there's David doing this
[49:41] jig I like that I had to put that in
[49:44] there
[49:46] all's might oh yeah
[49:49] oh yeah but he had victory possessing
[50:04] all things - you've seen one time I used
[50:06] to think about dancing in the spirit see
[50:08] somebody stand and dance in the spirit
[50:10] now I've seen the mockery put on put on
[50:12] of it but I've seen the real thing - so
[50:16] I come to find
[50:17] why why could people dance in the spirit
[50:20] well I never seen one yet get out of the
[50:23] way I've never seen one yet act
[50:25] immorally I always see it just as DS Lee
[50:28] and an order and sweetness and even
[50:31] sinners run to the altar and get saved
[50:34] when it's going on
[50:42] you have sinners to give their lives to
[50:45] Christ you'd have to be willing to get
[50:51] you lost in the spirit dancing obviously
[50:55] it's not the only way but your prophet
[50:57] said he's seen it
[50:58] somebody get caught up in the spirit and
[51:01] dancing of the Spirit of God and a
[51:03] sinner's heart get convicted he says I
[51:05] gotta go I got to go up to the altar
[51:08] give my life to Christ oh my god works
[51:11] in a way that's contrary to the way we
[51:14] think you want God to be free to save
[51:19] souls let him be free in you and then
[51:24] then he says well I wondered why it was
[51:27] and I come to find out it's victory
[51:31] [Music]
[51:33] David danced before the Lord when the
[51:37] ark was brought back to its resting
[51:39] place
[51:39] amen when David saw the word as it was
[51:43] then with the tables of stone brought
[51:45] back to his right place David rejoiced
[51:48] and danced in the spirit around and
[51:50] around in a row why he saw the word back
[51:55] in its place why was David really having
[52:03] such a victory because he seen that the
[52:05] word was where it was supposed to be Oh
[52:11] hallelujah hey men see where's the
[52:19] revival going to be when the word gets
[52:22] in this right place and the word is in
[52:26] you amen what the word needs is not out
[52:33] of some seminary some theological mix-up
[52:35] but an old fashioned God sent preacher
[52:38] behind the pulpit with the word seeing
[52:41] God vindicated oh god help us almost
[52:47] done first chronicles 15 16 and David
[52:52] spake to the chief of the Levites to
[52:53] appoint their brother to be the singers
[52:55] with instruments of music psalteries and
[52:58] harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up
[53:01] the voice with joy
[53:04] just lift up your voice with joy now I
[53:12] want you to see this because you realize
[53:14] David ordained this when the art came
[53:17] back that there would always be worship
[53:23] my my my
[53:25] moving down he says so David and the
[53:27] elders of Israel the captains over
[53:29] thousands went to bring up the Ark of
[53:31] the Covenant of the Lord I was a house
[53:33] of event of the joy and it came to pass
[53:36] when God helped the Levites that bear
[53:38] the Ark of the Covenant allure that they
[53:39] offered seven bullocks and seven Rams
[53:41] there's your sevens and David was
[53:43] clothed with a robe of fine linen and
[53:45] all the Levites that that bear the ark
[53:47] and the singers in China cha-cha Nanaia
[53:51] the master of the song with the singers
[53:54] David also had upon him and Ethan of
[53:56] linen thus all Israel brought up the Ark
[54:00] of the Covenant of the Lord with
[54:01] shouting with sound of cornet with the
[54:05] trumpets with cymbals making a noise
[54:07] with psalteries and harsh harps and
[54:10] that's something how's this church going
[54:14] to be
[54:14] how's this Church gonna really bring
[54:16] forth the Spirit of Christ it's this
[54:20] ties perfectly in with x2 you have to be
[54:24] in one place in one Accord you have to
[54:27] have the same motives the same
[54:29] objectives you have to realize that you
[54:32] hold a part in this and this worship
[54:36] here it doesn't work without you
[54:39] hallelujah the word doesn't come forth
[54:41] without you amen
[54:45] oh holiday we got we got to fell out
[54:49] Holmen
[54:49] he hasn't caught the full revelation yet
[54:51] but he loves God and he works a lot of
[54:55] seven-day weeks but he's one of the only
[54:57] people I've ever noticed that when he's
[54:59] in service the atmosphere is completely
[55:01] different now I thought I said Lord this
[55:06] guy could catch a fire and be there
[55:08] every time and be be hungry just just
[55:10] being there cuz that's the way everyone
[55:14] should be right they shouldn't just be
[55:18] one guy I'm looking at and say hey yep
[55:19] yep when they're here that makes a big
[55:21] difference but that's you and you knew
[55:29] [Laughter]
[55:33] what else can live that fart out in the
[55:36] bride that you can and you have the
[55:39] revelation you know what this is you
[55:44] know how to have a victorious church
[55:46] service you know how to have healing in
[55:49] the service if the revivals not coming
[55:55] in charge like it's supposed to go back
[55:57] here are you in due order or if you let
[56:01] the cares of this life filter it's got
[56:06] to be the same and it came to pass as
[56:09] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came
[56:11] to the City of David that Michael the
[56:13] daughter of Saul looking out the window
[56:15] saw King David dancing and playing and
[56:17] she despised him in her heart oh my
[56:20] don't worry there's always gonna be
[56:23] somebody that's not gonna like the way
[56:25] you worship I like this my body hurts
[56:35] not your goodness hallelujah
[56:39] possessing all things again then David
[56:43] said glory to God this is it and around
[56:46] and around and around and around his
[56:49] little stuck-up wife set up there
[56:52] being the king's daughter said why he
[56:55] embarrasses me and David said you don't
[56:59] like that watch this and around and
[57:04] around he went again yes oh my what a
[57:07] time he had even you know God look down
[57:13] out of heaven said David you're a man
[57:15] after my heart see why he had done lost
[57:20] all pride
[57:23] why wouldn't we worship the way God
[57:25] wants us to worship she got pride
[57:30] remember your prophet told the story
[57:32] about he said we should be in a place he
[57:34] said he said the Lord will try to
[57:35] humiliate you he'll get you in front of
[57:37] a bunch of co-workers and get you to
[57:38] speak in tongues and from them just to
[57:41] see if you'll do it well you might want
[57:49] to get warmed up here and worry about
[57:54] the rest later so what it says you know
[57:58] god looked down out of heaven and said
[58:00] David your man he lost all his pride he
[58:04] had done lost all of his yet he was
[58:06] married to a king's daughter but that
[58:08] wasn't even considered then he know that
[58:11] he was acquainted with the possessor of
[58:13] heavens and earth and here was the Word
[58:15] of God coming right back among them
[58:17] again and David was so happy he didn't
[58:20] he just danced as hard as he could
[58:23] Miriam she grabbed the tambourine and
[58:26] went down to the bank dancing on the
[58:28] other side after she had come through
[58:31] the Red Sea and seen her enemies drowned
[58:33] then she could dance in the spirit which
[58:36] he seen the enemies that had tormented
[58:38] her dead
[58:39] then she danced in the spirit that's
[58:41] right after the battles worn when the
[58:45] glory of God comes down know I'd begin
[58:51] to touch to that day remember whether
[58:53] you see it or not the victory is already
[58:55] won amen
[58:57] hallelujah he led captivity captive a
[59:00] man indeed gets the men hallelujah let's
[59:05] tan
[59:13] says here closing he says it was at then
[59:17] when that man died that David with the
[59:21] anointing saw what he had done wrong Oh
[59:23] David you passed her can't you see
[59:26] you're dead Creed's and denominations
[59:28] you're holding onto can't you see what
[59:30] it's doing it's killing a Uzziah
[59:33] spiritually dead what was his ayah that
[59:39] was a person in David's church pastors
[59:43] killing people spiritually on the church
[59:47] spiritually dead and you wonder why
[59:50] there ain't no revival letting her women
[59:55] cut their hair paint their face wear
[59:57] shorts send your boys away to Rickey
[59:59] schools and so forth like that where
[1:00:01] half of them comes home homosexuals and
[1:00:03] everything sanctification gone we're
[1:00:12] done
[1:00:12] I trust that was a blessing to you how
[1:00:20] are we going to get revival how are we
[1:00:22] going to get it back in the due order
[1:00:27] but I know this if you want God hear
[1:00:31] your worship like you want him here
[1:00:33] because he likes that with all our
[1:00:38] hearts with all our praise we get it too
[1:00:41] so with that being spoke and looking at
[1:00:45] your your life today where are you at
[1:00:49] you need a revival maybe you need a
[1:00:52] touch of the Lord God is more than able
[1:00:55] to bring it to you but will you accept
[1:01:00] for the Living Word is here he's here
[1:01:02] he's absolutely here God has always been
[1:01:12] so gracious
[1:01:13] I just preached a funeral last Tuesday I
[1:01:15] preached one yesterday and I preached
[1:01:16] one last Tuesday before
[1:01:19] and the lower just really anointed it
[1:01:22] was great I had this lady actually
[1:01:24] numerous people come up and say boy it's
[1:01:26] really good
[1:01:27] cruciate that and sure tore him up with
[1:01:29] acts 2:38 but they still heard it and
[1:01:32] one lady came up to me she said just a
[1:01:36] worldly a girl and she said I don't know
[1:01:38] what it was she said but while you were
[1:01:40] preaching I felt this presence come down
[1:01:44] in the midst of this place and she's
[1:01:48] like do you think that was God I said
[1:01:53] absolutely I said it and what was the
[1:01:56] message he brought you to be baptized to
[1:02:00] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:02:02] Jesus Christ and that life that you felt
[1:02:04] now he would come we're living in a
[1:02:09] season brother/sister where this is not
[1:02:12] popular but God is doing everything he
[1:02:15] can to reveal that presence to people
[1:02:17] but we have to believe that he's with us
[1:02:20] you have to believe that you have to
[1:02:22] believe that he wants to answer your
[1:02:24] plan maybe you got something on your
[1:02:27] heart today we'll go before the Lord now
[1:02:30] say God maybe saying god I don't want to
[1:02:34] let the spirit of revival die in my life
[1:02:35] maybe saying God I want this church to
[1:02:38] be a to be a power house for you lord I
[1:02:40] Norden these meetings are here for a
[1:02:43] reason we're praying we're doing what we
[1:02:44] can lure not holding any Creed any Dogma
[1:02:47] but we're just here believing that
[1:02:50] you'll pour out your spirit upon us God
[1:02:52] we just need a higher walk with you with
[1:02:54] greater revelation with a greater faith
[1:02:57] to walk this Val Lord sees those hearts
[1:03:01] let's pray the most beloved Lord Jesus
[1:03:05] Christ how we love you know you're a
[1:03:08] great God ordained that Lord you would
[1:03:12] bring the Living Word in our midst if
[1:03:15] we've seen that need fortable if we did
[1:03:18] the do order Lord you said you'd bring a
[1:03:20] revival here and what we're asking now
