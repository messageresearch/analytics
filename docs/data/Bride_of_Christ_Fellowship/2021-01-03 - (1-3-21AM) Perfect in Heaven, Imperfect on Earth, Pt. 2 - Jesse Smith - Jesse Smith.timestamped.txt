[11:50] we must had a rough night last night my
[11:52] wife didn't get to bed till 3am because
[11:54] zion was sleeping that's why she's not
[11:56] here
[11:57] uh and then she woke up again at 5 00
[11:58] a.m because he's just he's teething you
[12:00] know
[12:01] he's just teething hopefully she'll get
[12:04] a nap today
[12:04] right now and then she'll be able to
[12:06] come to second service tonight i asked
[12:07] lydia to stay home and hold zion so my
[12:09] wife could
[12:10] sleep uh just awful not to get any rest
[12:13] so let's just remember her and zion will
[12:16] get over this teething
[12:21] when i come up to preach i'll do the
[12:22] officer appreciation for 2021 by
[12:25] for 2020 rather so i want to wait until
[12:27] ben gets here i would like to
[12:28] recognize our officer and then our song
[12:32] our worship team i'd say like that or i
[12:35] want to recognize them in just a moment
[12:37] but
[12:37] let's take a few prayer requests here um
[12:40] but amen had an unspoken request
[12:42] so let's remember that also brother jose
[12:45] the doctor said he's got glaucoma so
[12:47] let's pray for divine healing for that
[12:49] i'll probably text everybody a day to
[12:51] fast and pray this week so if
[12:53] we if we remember to talk about it maybe
[12:55] which day is best for you
[12:57] um so but jose i like to do that i like
[13:00] the faster pray brother and just see if
[13:02] god
[13:02] now they can they can help it with a
[13:04] laser surgery and drops but
[13:06] it would be amazing if god would come on
[13:08] and do a miracle
[13:11] but jose said he's not receiving that
[13:13] boxer out of snakes praise god so
[13:15] that's so while he's got that faith like
[13:17] we'll see with job today
[13:19] while you got that faith let's uh
[13:20] support it let's pray for it let's pass
[13:22] and pray and ask god
[13:23] to do great things for our precious
[13:26] brother jose so let's remember that
[13:29] um also there's a preacher you i don't
[13:31] even know him
[13:33] but he's from new zealand his name is
[13:34] gary walker his wife has cancer
[13:37] i imagine she's in her 50s so let's
[13:39] remember that
[13:41] in prayer
[13:45] any other needs yes
[13:48] any other needs anybody has for today
[13:50] that would like to be remembered
[13:53] praise god the battle belongs to the
[13:55] lord jesus christ
[13:56] praise god we cannot say with our arm of
[13:59] flesh
[14:00] only his arm can save jose yes sir
[14:14] right that's jolene right
[14:22] all right yes let's remember that in
[14:25] prayer but we'll certainly lift that up
[14:26] before the lord today
[14:30] you know god gave naomi and wesley and
[14:31] all them all those negative tests so
[14:33] let's pray there's more there for god
[14:36] to do it but if she would be positive
[14:40] uh god told us to do that so let's
[14:42] remember that uh we appreciate that
[14:43] brother jose

[29:49] the church said amen god bless you let's
[29:52] stand here we'll take our bibles here
[29:56] praise god let's go to the book of job
[29:57] chapter one
[30:04] i'm going to start as you probably saw
[30:05] in the text i'm going to start back up
[30:07] with the memory verses so i gave
[30:08] everybody a month
[30:10] so any time before that month just let
[30:12] me know the
[30:14] the scripture you'd like to memorize for
[30:16] that month
[30:17] and we'll keep doing that by the grace
[30:19] of the lord
[30:23] i gave uh some of the individuals like i
[30:25] gave hua an individual month
[30:27] uh my wife an individual month and
[30:29] malachi and lydia just so we got all 12
[30:31] months filled
[30:32] right because we ended up i think we
[30:34] stopped doing it in october or something
[30:35] like that and
[30:36] i just kind of finished up and then kind
[30:39] of forgot about it
[30:40] so this will give everybody a month here
[30:41] to just you know share
[30:43] scripture that blesses their heart and
[30:45] that we could memorize together
[30:47] and have the holy spirit write it upon
[30:48] our hearts
[30:54] i don't see vang yet so maybe we'll read
[30:57] our text and maybe he'll walk in
[30:59] hopefully in a few minutes
[31:00] by god's grace job chapter 1.
[31:08] and then we'll read uh another verse in
[31:10] job and then we'll do our the memory
[31:12] verse i'm choosing is from david so
[31:14] we'll read that in just a moment but job
[31:15] chapter one let's read
[31:18] verse 8. this is such a beautiful
[31:20] scripture we looked at it on
[31:22] friday how god places
[31:26] job as perfect i think it's beautiful
[31:29] don't you
[31:30] if god was going to judge you or judge
[31:32] me by
[31:33] a standard and declare us perfect how
[31:35] would he do it he'd have to do it the
[31:37] same way because he's the same yesterday
[31:38] today and forever
[31:41] let's read verse 8 together ready one
[31:43] two three
[31:44] and the lord said unto satan hast thou
[31:47] considered my servant job that there is
[31:50] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[31:54] upright man one that feareth god and a
[31:57] skeweth
[31:58] evil now i want to read another one job
[32:00] go to job
[32:01] 38.
[32:11] now notice job just told the devil job's
[32:14] perfect
[32:16] but when job cut when god comes to job
[32:19] he says who is this right he doesn't say
[32:23] hey job
[32:23] you're a perfect man thank you mr
[32:26] perfect for
[32:26] being a witness thanks for being a
[32:28] message believer mr perfect is that how
[32:30] god addresses job on the earth
[32:32] no he addresses him as a father with a
[32:34] son that needs
[32:35] help and correction now i'll read verse
[32:38] one and two
[32:39] then the lord answered job out of the
[32:41] whirlwind and said who
[32:42] is this that darkeneth counsel by words
[32:45] without knowledge
[32:46] so in heaven god's like job's perfect
[32:49] he's perfect but on earth he's like who
[32:51] are you job
[32:54] see how god deals with us differently
[32:57] he deals with the devil in a certain way
[32:58] regarding us they're perfect
[33:00] they're forgiven but with us father to
[33:04] son
[33:05] he speaks to humble us
[33:08] that we don't get too exalted and think
[33:11] we're
[33:12] so much like him that we don't need him
[33:14] anymore how many need the lord today
[33:17] now my choice for memory verse is first
[33:19] samuel 17
[33:20] 47 just a real short verse this is right
[33:23] before
[33:23] david slays goliath
[33:27] first samuel 17 47.
[33:31] and i hope it's prophetic i believe it
[33:32] will you know because i'm i'm sure it'll
[33:34] be
[33:34] prophetic in many ways because we'll all
[33:36] have battles this year
[33:38] right and some of us will share our
[33:40] battles in the prayer requests
[33:41] but this assembly will know that god
[33:44] saves us by his power
[33:45] amen not by our power but by his power
[33:49] amen and of course he showed that he's
[33:51] he showed us this
[33:52] year after year after year
[33:55] but i just i the scripture came to my
[33:57] mind this morning after prayer and
[33:58] uh i thought i really like this verse so
[34:00] let's let's read this together may this
[34:02] be our memory verse may god help us
[34:03] remember this during january
[34:05] first samuel 17 47 let's read it on
[34:07] three one
[34:08] two three and all this assembly
[34:11] shall know that the lord saveth not with
[34:15] sword and spear
[34:16] for the battle is the lord's and he will
[34:19] give you
[34:20] into our hands he's speaking to goliath
[34:22] right that enemy will be given into our
[34:24] hands
[34:25] amen we'll overcome the enemy may god
[34:28] add the blessings the reading of his
[34:29] word you may be seated praise god
[34:33] i'm going to send a quick text of ang i
[34:34] usually don't uh text from the pulpit
[34:36] right
[34:37] but let me send a quick text and see if
[34:39] he's coming if not
[34:41] uh i still want to recognize our uh
[34:45] helpers here say are you

[34:54] say god bless you are you coming to
[34:55] morning service let's see if he comes
[34:56] here
[34:57] if i get a text from him in the next few
[35:00] minutes
[35:03] it's a true uh pleasure to serve the
[35:05] lord uh

[39:13] take a little time and thank every
[39:15] you know all those that are officially
[39:17] helping out in those certain areas
[39:19] we appreciate it uh we're thankful to
[39:22] the lord for
[39:23] all his blessings um
[39:26] and like i don't know if naomi was here
[39:28] when i uh yeah i think she was out in
[39:29] ghana when i said this but
[39:31] you know with sister wendy leaving we
[39:32] lost a little chunk of our income so
[39:34] i'll be
[39:35] probably having less guest ministers um
[39:38] it's either that or i give them less
[39:39] money so i don't know i don't know it's
[39:41] kind of like a mind battle you know what
[39:42] i mean like
[39:43] uh because we love having this place and
[39:46] i love
[39:47] i was just driving in today i said thank
[39:48] you lord for this place
[39:50] i love this place i love having a house
[39:52] of god where we can worship the lord
[39:54] but i'm going to try to limit the guest
[39:56] preachers like i said try
[40:02] and so that means more preaching on my
[40:03] part but i don't mind that i certainly
[40:04] love to preach i've been
[40:06] it's my call of god
[40:09] so uh just uh be let's all be thankful
[40:13] and uh rejoice in what god has done for
[40:14] us and uh we'll see
[40:16] you know what the lord allows here in
[40:18] 2021.
[40:20] uh like i told you i have new numerous
[40:22] visions for this year i wrote my seven
[40:23] goals out for this year
[40:25] one of them is to maybe start that
[40:27] outreach ministry i talked about so i
[40:28] need cam's help with that and i'll need
[40:31] maybe amen and vang's help on that
[40:34] maybe jose and steven whoever feels led
[40:36] to do it but i just have a great
[40:38] burden to go out to churches and just to
[40:40] tell them who i am and who we are and
[40:41] what we believe so
[40:43] like paul paul went to the synagogues
[40:45] two by two you know
[40:47] him and barnabas and i just feel led to
[40:49] do something i got to do something more
[40:51] by god's grace
[40:53] so i don't know how that'll work out but
[40:55] that's my that's one of my desires for
[40:57] 2021.
[40:59] all right so let me just start preaching
[41:00] here i'll probably just talk all day and
[41:02] tell you how much i love everybody
[41:04] and i certainly do love everybody so
[41:05] great to have naomi back in the girls
[41:07] and
[41:08] uh beatrice how's it been at home has it
[41:11] been better at home
[41:12] hey we were joking one time and she
[41:15] she was saying uh can't wait to get all
[41:17] the the noise back in the house
[41:21] right that's how you know i got my eight
[41:23] kids there's a lot of annoyers you know
[41:25] so i'm sure that's a blessing to have
[41:26] all that noise back amen
[41:29] amen praise god
[41:32] thank god for his grace and mercy they
[41:34] grow up so fast you know lydia's 16 she
[41:36] don't make as much noise anymore you
[41:38] know so
[41:39] uh but we're so thankful for god's
[41:42] amazing grace
[41:43] i just hope this you know these i'll
[41:45] maybe preach one or two more sermons on
[41:46] this but
[41:48] i just hope this thought is a blessing
[41:49] to know that in heaven god sees you as
[41:52] perfect
[41:53] so between demons god exalts you as
[41:56] perfect
[41:57] because remember the bible says whoever
[41:59] god whoever humbles themselves
[42:01] god will exalt so in heaven god exalts
[42:04] you and i
[42:05] to such a spot where the satan can't
[42:07] even get anything on us
[42:09] because he humbles i'm sorry he exalts
[42:11] the humble
[42:13] praise god and the prideful he abases
[42:16] so remember the bible said we're seated
[42:18] in heavenly places
[42:20] so one application of that not just
[42:22] being in the mind of god here
[42:24] but one application of that as well is
[42:26] that god
[42:27] is a witness for us up in heaven we're
[42:30] we're
[42:31] we're exalted up in heaven as to being
[42:33] perfect before the throne of god
[42:35] what a privilege church amen that god
[42:38] can take us up
[42:39] in heavenly places and stand for us
[42:42] and say to the devil and all his
[42:44] accusers
[42:45] that my child is perfect have you
[42:49] considered him or her praise god
[42:51] have you seen such a witness have you
[42:53] seen such a love for me
[42:57] and we can stand there uh and we can
[42:59] stand on earth and be
[43:00] confident that god is pleading our case
[43:02] in heaven amen
[43:05] now just reviewing part one remember all
[43:08] the blessings from part one i hope
[43:10] uh the heavenly council remember there's
[43:11] a heavenly council going on
[43:13] and god stands for us but as god's
[43:16] standing for us remember we must be
[43:17] sober and vigilant
[43:19] because it's like we're being hunted
[43:20] down on earth
[43:22] satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom
[43:24] he may devour
[43:26] so we must keep on the armor of god
[43:28] church amen
[43:30] but god sees us and i love how god
[43:36] how god stands up for job how does god
[43:39] vindicate that job is perfect to the
[43:41] devil because
[43:43] he fears god and he hates evil and he's
[43:46] upright
[43:47] when he makes a mistake he says i'm
[43:49] sorry lord forgive me
[43:52] before he makes a decision he consults
[43:54] god because he wants to fear god
[43:55] he wants to respect god first before
[43:57] making decisions
[43:59] and when evil is presented when satan
[44:01] brings evil directly to him he turns it
[44:03] down
[44:05] praise god that's how god vindicates you
[44:09] as perfect as well when satan brings you
[44:11] a chance to
[44:12] enjoy sin turn it down amen
[44:16] you make a mistake you're upright you
[44:17] say you're sorry and you get back to
[44:19] your right standing with god
[44:21] amen that's how god determines who's
[44:25] perfect to the devil
[44:26] amen all right thank god for that
[44:30] remember heaven says you're loved in
[44:32] heaven
[44:33] right you're loved in heaven now uh
[44:37] i'm just skipping through these here uh
[44:39] these previous slides from the
[44:41] the earlier service on friday thank god
[44:44] we have jesus christ
[44:45] as an advocate in heaven praise god he's
[44:48] standing for us
[44:49] he's pleading our case against all the
[44:51] devils that are bringing
[44:52] accusations against us amen and nobody
[44:55] could argue a case like jesus amen
[44:58] we know he'll win because he already
[44:59] defeated satan on earth satan brought
[45:01] his best arguments
[45:02] and jesus said it's written praise god
[45:05] so we know if he won that debate there
[45:07] on earth he's going to win every debate
[45:08] in heaven praise god
[45:10] so our desire church is to just live
[45:12] upright
[45:13] confess our sins praise god now remember
[45:16] job was such a
[45:18] godly man now let's go over this real
[45:19] quick job made widows
[45:22] shout for joy because he helped him out
[45:26] he made the fatherless shout for joy
[45:29] he loved his enemies he didn't trust
[45:32] in his money and he helped strangers
[45:36] he also refused to lust after pretty
[45:38] women
[45:39] right because he overcame the mind
[45:41] battles
[45:44] what a man of god amen so this is how we
[45:47] fear god right this is how we
[45:49] escape evil so in our personal lives
[45:54] and in our pride in our public lives and
[45:56] our personal lives we
[45:57] always try to rid ourselves from evil
[46:00] but brother bam did say he did have a
[46:02] great battle with fear
[46:05] right the bible says he had a great
[46:06] battle with fear and because of fear
[46:09] this test seems like it
[46:12] came upon him because he feared he would
[46:15] lose everything
[46:17] but then we saw how god was gracious
[46:20] and god was merciful god brought him
[46:24] through the trial praise god
[46:26] and we saw that job was perfect in
[46:28] heaven
[46:29] by the blood just as we are perfect in
[46:32] heaven
[46:32] by the blood of jesus amen glory
[46:36] now starting today let's look at some of
[46:40] job's harshest words you want to see him
[46:44] i was listening to it reading through it
[46:45] this morning job had some
[46:47] pretty harsh words here now get your
[46:49] bibles to go to job 9
[46:52] 22 and 23 please
[47:04] actually just do job 9 17. let's start
[47:07] there job 9
[47:08] 17. now church
[47:11] remember we are not downgrading job or
[47:14] anything like that
[47:17] and let me say this again john the
[47:18] baptist no jesus said
[47:20] the greatest in the new testament is
[47:22] greater than anyone in the old testament
[47:24] now i believe that but i never want to
[47:26] exalt myself above them
[47:29] so i always say i always say old
[47:31] testament saints
[47:32] have more faith than me because i'm
[47:34] trying to humble
[47:35] myself does everybody understand but
[47:37] somehow in some way are they amen jesus
[47:38] says
[47:39] those least in the kingdom of heaven are
[47:41] greater than john the baptist
[47:42] now i'll let god do i'll let god say
[47:45] that i'm not going to say that about
[47:46] myself
[47:48] because i've never suffered like this
[47:49] man i've never lost 10 children
[47:52] i've never had boils for months where i
[47:54] can't sleep i've never had that
[47:55] so i'm not going to say we're greater
[47:57] i'm not going to say i'm greater than
[47:58] job
[47:59] i'll let god say whatever he wants
[48:00] that's up to god does everybody
[48:02] understand
[48:03] amen i'm not contradicting the scripture
[48:05] i'm trying to humble myself
[48:07] right we're trying to humble ourselves
[48:09] we're not trying to see how prideful we
[48:10] can be
[48:11] we're trying to see how humble we can be
[48:15] praise god okay so hopefully everybody
[48:16] understands job 9
[48:18] 17. now before we read this remember
[48:22] he started off strong he went right to
[48:24] the house of god i'm sorry he got right
[48:25] on his knees and said the lord gives the
[48:27] lord takes away
[48:28] blessed be the name of the lord amen but
[48:31] as the trial went on
[48:33] his faith got weaker his spirit mind
[48:36] got weaker and it was harder to fight
[48:38] the battles
[48:39] so that's why i really got to pray for
[48:40] brother jose as
[48:43] weeks may go on he may start having more
[48:45] mind battles about his eyes we don't
[48:48] know
[48:49] but if you go through a trial you may
[48:51] start strong
[48:53] but you'll need the prayers of the
[48:54] saints to bring you through
[48:56] just like peter needed jesus prayer he
[48:59] said don't fear
[49:00] don't fear peter i pray for you that
[49:02] your faith doesn't fail
[49:05] hallelujah praise god so your prayers
[49:08] are so important for jose now
[49:12] for each one of us church when we go
[49:13] through the trials they're so crucial
[49:15] job 9 17.
[49:19] now look at this he break for he
[49:21] breaketh me with a tempest
[49:23] and multiplies my wounds here it is
[49:25] here's the sin of job
[49:27] without cause
[49:31] god is allowing me to be afflicted
[49:33] without cause in other words he's saying
[49:35] i'm perfect i've done nothing wrong but
[49:37] the bible says he feared he had great
[49:39] fear
[49:41] i'm going to show you later the bible
[49:43] says he had iniquity church
[49:46] i'm going to show it to you from the
[49:47] scripture so see why we we know job is
[49:51] perfect in heaven he was still a man
[49:55] you know as much as we want to think
[49:56] we're perfect on earth we're not
[49:59] and church this has really helped me to
[50:01] understand brother branham because job
[50:02] was a prophet too
[50:04] and you're going to see some of these
[50:05] scriptures job had some
[50:07] he had some faults he had some he had
[50:10] some weaknesses
[50:12] but god didn't see it in heaven amen
[50:15] brother adam had some weaknesses he said
[50:17] some things he maybe shouldn't have said
[50:19] right he had some human faults and
[50:21] failures but according to the blood
[50:23] the blood forgives him and god sees him
[50:26] as a perfect prophet amen
[50:29] hallelujah amen
[50:32] so he says i'm getting all this and
[50:33] there's no cause no there's always a
[50:35] cause
[50:36] because god god can't tempt you the
[50:38] bible said god can't tempt you
[50:40] right so in other words any trial comes
[50:42] it's a consequence of something we've
[50:44] done
[50:46] right because the bible said god will
[50:48] not tempt any man
[50:50] so see god could not allow uh
[50:54] job to be tempted without there a cause
[50:56] for it
[50:59] i hope that makes sense i hope i'm
[51:00] saying it right i'll just say like
[51:01] graham
[51:02] said let if i can't get out in my
[51:04] english let the holy spirit reveal it to
[51:05] you praise god
[51:06] amen if i can't get the words and i
[51:08] can't order them the right way
[51:09] may the holy spirit help you understand
[51:11] anyway amen
[51:13] so what i'm saying is joe what i'm
[51:15] saying is job and you and i
[51:17] deserve every test that we go through
[51:21] every spanking we get from god we
[51:23] deserve it that's what i'm trying to say
[51:25] okay so job is getting spanked here
[51:27] because the bible said
[51:28] every every son that comes to god must
[51:31] be chastened
[51:33] and that means beat with the rod i
[51:34] showed you that a few months ago hebrews
[51:36] 12
[51:36] that means it hit with the rod so job
[51:40] needed i said like this job needed this
[51:43] you and i need our trials right
[51:46] we need god to correct us we need god to
[51:49] take out our bad parts
[51:53] okay so he says god's done this with no
[51:56] cause
[51:56] oh no there was a cause there was we're
[51:59] gonna see it in the scripture here
[52:02] go to verse 22. oh no wait uh yeah
[52:14] this is one thing therefore i say it he
[52:17] destroyeth
[52:18] the perfect with the wicked look at this
[52:22] verse 23 if the scourge slays suddenly
[52:26] he will laugh at the
[52:27] trial of the innocent now look at this
[52:30] church
[52:32] job says god is going to laugh when the
[52:34] innocent
[52:35] die quickly is that what the scripture
[52:37] says
[52:38] let me read again if this if the scourge
[52:40] slays suddenly he will laugh at the
[52:42] trial of the innocent
[52:44] a scourging right god is gonna laugh
[52:47] at innocent people getting uh
[52:51] spanked right or suffering does that
[52:54] sound right
[52:55] is that right the bible said god is
[52:59] very compassionate he's slow to anger
[53:02] the bible said god pities his children
[53:05] as a father
[53:05] pity of his children so
[53:09] job says two things wrong here oh
[53:11] there's i don't deserve this
[53:14] well yeah you do praise god thank god
[53:17] yeah we do deserve our tests and trials
[53:20] we do
[53:21] we do deserve spanking sometimes and
[53:23] then job said god laughs or makes fun of
[53:25] people that go
[53:26] when they're innocent being s and
[53:28] they're suffering well first of all how
[53:29] do you just say how do you say they're
[53:30] innocent on earth
[53:32] we're never truly innocent uh perfect on
[53:34] earth right
[53:35] because eventually we'll sin well now
[53:37] we're not innocent anymore we might go
[53:38] for a few hours we might go for the part
[53:41] of the day we don't sin but
[53:42] pretty soon church sometime in the day
[53:46] we're going to think or say the wrong
[53:47] thing
[53:49] we're going to get selfish we're going
[53:52] to wish bad on somebody
[53:54] right we're going to get jealous of
[53:55] somebody
[53:57] pretty soon we're gonna just fall short
[53:58] of god's glory
[54:01] so i hope that helps you now go to job
[54:03] three since we're here i mentioned this
[54:05] earlier
[54:06] in job one and two job is praising god
[54:09] he's saying the lord gives the lord
[54:10] takes away
[54:11] he's overcoming but in chapter 3 verse 1
[54:13] i like how amen saying on this this
[54:15] morning
[54:15] after this opened job his mouth and
[54:18] cursed his day
[54:20] and job spake and said let the day
[54:22] perish wherein i was born
[54:23] and the night in which it was said this
[54:26] there's a
[54:26] a man child conceived let
[54:29] let that day be dark and let not god
[54:31] regard it from above neither let the
[54:33] light shine
[54:34] upon it so he curses the very day he was
[54:36] born
[54:38] right because before he's saying bless
[54:41] the lord bless the lord
[54:42] but now he starts saying i wish i was
[54:44] never born
[54:46] a church i think we can all relate to
[54:48] this sometimes we're really giving god
[54:50] praise we're really getting the victory
[54:52] and sometimes we're losing the battle
[54:55] praise god sometimes we're winning
[54:57] tonight it's glorious and we're
[54:58] confessing
[54:59] and then we have tests and trials and we
[55:02] embarrass ourselves
[55:08] remember verse 25 for the thing which i
[55:10] greatly fear just come upon me
[55:12] he had a great fear all the time he
[55:14] sacrificed and even praising god
[55:16] sometimes he'd cycle back you know we go
[55:17] through cycles oh we're on the
[55:19] mountaintop then we're in the valley
[55:20] mountain top valley mountain
[55:22] in one of those cycles in the valley he
[55:24] said i'm going to lose
[55:25] everything i'm scared i'm going to lose
[55:28] everything
[55:30] and the trial church brought this to the
[55:33] forefront
[55:34] because then he says god laughs at
[55:36] people when they're punished
[55:38] god laughs at the innocent and this is
[55:40] happening without cause i don't deserve
[55:42] this well yeah
[55:44] the bible says you break one law you're
[55:45] guilty of the whole
[55:48] the bible said there's none that seeketh
[55:50] after god
[55:51] the bible said all we like sheep ran
[55:54] from jesus
[55:56] right that's what isaiah 53 says
[56:04] so i hope we're starting to see this i
[56:05] hope you and i can better understand
[56:09] some of job's harsh words
[56:15] now go we read 17 23 now go to
[56:18] job now i i got some up here i didn't
[56:20] write down but go to job 16 verse 9.
[56:23] i put this one in my notes and i didn't
[56:25] put it i didn't have time for the
[56:28] powerpoint
[56:32] you know i tried to get up at 5am this
[56:33] morning i guess i was so tired i slept
[56:35] until 6 50. so almost lost two hours of
[56:37] study time
[56:38] i guess my body needed it but i'd like
[56:41] to get up early at 5 00 a.m
[56:42] just i can study and get all these
[56:43] quotes so you can see them you know
[56:46] sorry i slept in this morning so
[56:49] 16 9 9. no
[56:52] my oh my look at this first mercy jesus
[56:55] god help us god help us
[56:58] verse 9 he teareth me in his wrath who
[57:02] hateth me
[57:04] and yet church god was up there saying
[57:06] he's perfect devil
[57:08] he hates evil so god is saying good
[57:11] things about
[57:12] job and now god and job's not saying
[57:14] good things about god
[57:15] that's just like jesus john the baptist
[57:17] remember that jose
[57:19] john's like disciples don't see him he's
[57:22] the one that's he's a watershed we look
[57:23] for another
[57:24] ah and then when they come to jesus
[57:27] jesus said hang around
[57:28] and see the glory of god amen
[57:31] he said if i tell you john is a great
[57:33] man he said he's a prophet i said he's
[57:35] more than a prophet he's the voice of
[57:38] one that cries in the wilderness in
[57:39] other words
[57:40] god is always saying good things about
[57:42] you and i even when we say bad things
[57:44] about him
[57:46] because we're human he said he hates me
[57:50] and yet god is up there saying
[57:52] god's telling the devil i've got to
[57:54] hedge about him because i love him so
[57:55] much
[57:57] thank god amen i love him so much
[58:00] i'm protecting him with fences glory
[58:03] with walls i'm protecting job nothing
[58:06] can get through that wall
[58:08] i'm protecting him because i love him
[58:11] i may let you know the devil come in
[58:12] through the head sometimes and i may
[58:14] remove the hedge for a while
[58:15] but i love job but job after months and
[58:19] months of not sleeping and
[58:20] months and months the bible said his
[58:22] skin was black with bruises
[58:25] right or rotting skin rotting flesh
[58:27] right
[58:28] like a man's shirt his skin was like
[58:31] black like that
[58:33] rotting off he said i haven't slept in
[58:36] months
[58:37] and he says god hates me
[58:41] and then later we're going to find out
[58:42] god has to correct this man
[58:44] god doesn't hate him god's testing him
[58:48] god is refining him god is taking out
[58:52] his impurities and making him more pure
[58:55] praise god god help us amen
[58:59] may god bring this to our remembrance
[59:01] when we suffer trials this year
[59:06] i could have used this when i had
[59:07] coronavirus that day and a half i laid
[59:08] on the bed
[59:11] but i was i was saying like bang i was
[59:13] saying like bang i was saying this is
[59:14] lying man he's lying man he's in between
[59:16] my moaning
[59:18] in between my cry lying man and he's
[59:21] lying vanities and i didn't really feel
[59:23] anything
[59:24] other than the pain of being sick
[59:28] isn't that amazing god hates me no
[59:32] god loves you god died for you amen
[59:35] he gnasheth upon me with his teeth so
[59:38] you like he takes a big bite of you
[59:41] that's what job says he's biting me he's
[59:44] gnashing on me with his teeth
[59:48] mine enemy sharpened his eyes upon me so
[59:51] he's letting
[59:52] my enemies just hunt me down
[59:55] that's what he says
[1:00:02] actually look at verse uh verse look at
[1:00:05] verse seven but now he hath made me
[1:00:06] weary
[1:00:07] thou has made desolate all my company
[1:00:10] so he's blaming god for making me weak
[1:00:13] right
[1:00:14] oh sometimes we say well i'm so weak i'm
[1:00:16] so weak spiritually and it's god's fault
[1:00:18] that's what he's saying
[1:00:19] it's god's fault i'm not stronger
[1:00:21] spiritually
[1:00:22] no no no no it's our fault praise god
[1:00:26] it's our fault because we're the ones
[1:00:29] who let down the guard
[1:00:32] we're the ones who instead of praising
[1:00:33] god start doubting god
[1:00:37] we're the ones instead of seeking god we
[1:00:38] seek other things of the world
[1:00:42] i hope this is helping somebody praise
[1:00:43] god yeah amen
[1:00:48] so we did 16. uh i guess job 27 has a
[1:00:50] lot let's go to job 27
[1:00:53] verse 2.
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:06] 27 verse 1 and 2. moreover joe continued
[1:01:08] his parable and said is god liveth now
[1:01:10] look at that he's almost like
[1:01:11] speaking speaking for god as god liveth
[1:01:15] if there's a god in heaven as just as
[1:01:16] there's a god in heaven he says he's
[1:01:18] taken away my judgment
[1:01:20] in other words god's not dealing justly
[1:01:23] with job
[1:01:24] god's misjudging the situation with job
[1:01:26] now can you imagine that
[1:01:28] in other words there's a court list
[1:01:29] there's a court in heaven and god judged
[1:01:31] the wrong thing
[1:01:32] he judged me wrong
[1:01:35] my lawyer god he argued my case the
[1:01:38] wrong case and i lost the case
[1:01:40] because god it was his fault
[1:01:44] praise god church i'm just reading you
[1:01:47] the bible
[1:01:48] same bible we've been preaching these
[1:01:49] last 14 years right
[1:01:52] oh job didn't deserve it oh no no he did
[1:01:55] he did
[1:01:56] he had great fear he was a man if
[1:01:59] brother branham sinned
[1:02:00] thousands of times a year with the holy
[1:02:03] ghost baptism in the soul
[1:02:04] what do you think job did there's a
[1:02:06] reason church he was offering all those
[1:02:08] lambs right
[1:02:09] there's a reason he's offering all those
[1:02:10] bullocks he's a man
[1:02:13] but we make it look like oh he never
[1:02:14] sinned he's only perfect by the blood
[1:02:17] he's only perfect by the forgiveness of
[1:02:19] god's grace
[1:02:21] amen that was the only way he was
[1:02:24] perfect
[1:02:24] in other words he keeps coming back to
[1:02:26] jesus hey amen
[1:02:28] oh god help us amen you see you keep
[1:02:30] coming back to church that's what i'm
[1:02:32] saying
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:42] and receive god's blessings amen amen
[1:02:49] good verse
[1:02:54] now look look at verse six my
[1:02:58] righteousness i hold fast and will not
[1:02:59] let it go look how prideful he was and
[1:03:01] later god's gonna say
[1:03:02] god says how prideful he was i didn't do
[1:03:05] anything wrong and i'm not gonna budge
[1:03:07] look how stubborn we can be sometimes
[1:03:10] i know it's god's father i know
[1:03:12] something's wrong with other people it's
[1:03:13] their fault not mine
[1:03:14] see pointing and everybody else he's got
[1:03:17] all those fingers pointing back at him
[1:03:19] right i'm not i'm not budget i'm so
[1:03:22] stubborn
[1:03:22] i'm not going to budge i've done
[1:03:24] anything wrong
[1:03:26] well your words tell what you've done
[1:03:28] wrong from the abundance of the heart
[1:03:30] the mouth speaketh god hates me
[1:03:35] trials i don't deserve any of these
[1:03:36] trials that's not true
[1:03:38] god loves you yeah and
[1:03:42] there should there's consequences to
[1:03:43] every action
[1:03:45] right just like blessings and cursing
[1:03:46] like i was telling my dad every time you
[1:03:48] say something negative about yourself
[1:03:50] that spirit hangs around well i'll never
[1:03:52] be any good i'll never do this
[1:03:54] i'm a worthless person that devil hangs
[1:03:56] around you're going to suffer the
[1:03:58] consequences of that
[1:03:59] but say you're sorry and confess the
[1:04:02] right thing
[1:04:03] resist satan and he's got to flee amen
[1:04:07] glory don't live under those curses
[1:04:10] don't live under those lies
[1:04:11] let the tree set you free amen
[1:04:17] look at verse 8 for what is the hope of
[1:04:20] the hypocrite
[1:04:21] though he hath gained when god taketh
[1:04:24] away his soul
[1:04:28] will god hear verse 9 hear his cry when
[1:04:30] trouble cometh upon him
[1:04:31] will he delight himself in the almighty
[1:04:33] will he always call upon god
[1:04:36] i will teach you by the hand of god that
[1:04:38] which is with the almighty will i not
[1:04:41] conceal so now he's talking like
[1:04:43] he's got all this he's got all this
[1:04:45] wisdom
[1:04:48] church we should be wise but we
[1:04:50] shouldn't brag about it
[1:04:52] because then it becomes pride and we
[1:04:55] lost our wisdom
[1:05:00] see there's so much to learn from the
[1:05:02] book of job and i've just this just even
[1:05:04] this morning it's opened up in a way
[1:05:05] i've never
[1:05:06] seen it before um
[1:05:09] we'll get to more so let's i did my list
[1:05:12] okay
[1:05:13] now let's look at this beautiful type
[1:05:15] here uh go to
[1:05:17] uh job uh
[1:05:22] let me see go to job 32
[1:05:25] yeah job chapter 32. brother braham said
[1:05:28] elijah
[1:05:29] is a perfect type of christ
[1:05:33] oh man this is beautiful i can't wait to
[1:05:36] preach this here i'm gonna
[1:05:37] i was anxious to preach it all morning
[1:05:39] all right
[1:05:41] job32
[1:05:48] now we're gonna we're now i'm gonna show
[1:05:50] you a few things i hope this is a
[1:05:51] blessing joe or eli who
[1:05:52] perfectly types jesus christ all right
[1:05:56] here's what brother brahm said then when
[1:05:58] his church members came and could not
[1:05:59] console him
[1:06:00] accuse him of being a secret sinner said
[1:06:02] he'd sin before god job knew he not
[1:06:04] sinned and he knew
[1:06:05] he was all right now that's generally
[1:06:07] speaking right because we know
[1:06:09] he had some of these fears inside of him
[1:06:12] so every time in other words every time
[1:06:13] he sacrificed he was forgiven
[1:06:16] but he still had mind battles can you
[1:06:17] say amen we still got complexes can
[1:06:20] anybody say amen to that
[1:06:21] yeah right like there are certain ones
[1:06:24] i'm thinking of right now
[1:06:26] and i'm not gonna feed those i'm not
[1:06:27] gonna say him out loud because i don't
[1:06:29] i don't want to worry about him but i
[1:06:31] pray in my home my children will hear me
[1:06:32] i'll pray in my home about two or three
[1:06:34] certain things god please don't let this
[1:06:35] happen please don't let this happen
[1:06:37] and i don't want to speak it out loud
[1:06:38] because i don't want to create any
[1:06:38] complexes in you or my children
[1:06:41] but there are certain things i just i'm
[1:06:43] worried about year after year
[1:06:45] right and so i just pray blessings jesus
[1:06:48] bless and protect my family and children
[1:06:50] in jesus christ's day
[1:06:52] just keep blessing praise god keep
[1:06:53] blessing because we all have inner
[1:06:55] we have all have inner fears we might
[1:06:57] lose something we really love
[1:07:03] but then god sent a young man down by
[1:07:05] the name of elihu
[1:07:07] come down to meet job perfect type
[1:07:10] of christ again oh hallelujah
[1:07:14] amen look at job 32 verse 1.
[1:07:18] so these three men ceased to answer job
[1:07:21] because he was
[1:07:22] righteous in his own eyes in the church
[1:07:25] he has made himself more righteous than
[1:07:29] god
[1:07:31] that's what that's what job is accused
[1:07:33] of by elijah
[1:07:34] the perfect type of christ he's accused
[1:07:38] that he has made himself
[1:07:39] smarter and wiser and a better
[1:07:43] judge than god
[1:07:48] verse 2 then was kind of the wrath of
[1:07:50] elijah the son of
[1:07:52] bearer rachel the bazi of the kindred of
[1:07:55] ram against job was his wrath kindled
[1:07:57] because why he justified himself
[1:08:01] rather than god and church that happens
[1:08:04] every time every time people reject
[1:08:07] god's way
[1:08:08] for their own way they just justified
[1:08:11] themselves more than god
[1:08:13] like this here's an easy example well i
[1:08:15] don't need to go to church and hear the
[1:08:16] preaching anymore
[1:08:18] i don't get anything out of it right
[1:08:19] there you've justified yourself
[1:08:21] more than god because god says if you
[1:08:23] come here you'll be perfected
[1:08:25] you'll be equipped every blessing will
[1:08:27] not be withholding from you in the house
[1:08:29] of god amen
[1:08:30] amen right because that's what the bible
[1:08:32] says the five-fold ministry
[1:08:33] produces those five blessings remember
[1:08:36] exact knowledge unity
[1:08:37] all these blessings that's what the so
[1:08:39] when someone says i don't got to go to
[1:08:40] church see what happens
[1:08:42] they're justifying themselves instead of
[1:08:45] what god's word
[1:08:46] says that's just a simple example there
[1:08:51] ah god's word isn't true that's not
[1:08:53] really true
[1:08:54] i don't really need that see how people
[1:08:57] can do it so easily they don't even
[1:08:58] realize what they're doing
[1:09:00] anytime they say my way is better than
[1:09:02] god's way
[1:09:03] they're justifying themselves more than
[1:09:05] god i don't need to repent to that
[1:09:07] person
[1:09:08] ah i don't need to pay my tithes i have
[1:09:11] to follow that scripture
[1:09:12] what are they doing they're exalting
[1:09:14] themselves i'm a better judge than god
[1:09:16] i know how to run my life better than
[1:09:18] god no you don't praise god
[1:09:20] god gave us these books this instruction
[1:09:22] that we can be free
[1:09:23] happy joyful praise god we can be
[1:09:26] blessed we can get through the trials
[1:09:27] amen and we can learn to love god and
[1:09:30] love his people
[1:09:34] who gets all fired up brother man he
[1:09:35] gets off uh you're gonna see why this is
[1:09:37] good brother amen you're gonna like this
[1:09:39] here
[1:09:39] you're gonna see why it's the wine
[1:09:41] building up church
[1:09:43] yeah here's the scripture amen the wine
[1:09:45] is built up it's maturing in him praise
[1:09:47] god
[1:09:48] this fire is building up in elijah
[1:09:51] because he hears all these things
[1:09:52] that are not right with the word he's
[1:09:55] sitting there listening he's like i'll
[1:09:56] wait my turn
[1:09:57] he likes these three older men go he
[1:09:58] lets joe go
[1:10:00] and all that time that wine is getting
[1:10:02] stronger and it's growing inside of him
[1:10:04] growing
[1:10:05] growing he calls it a fire in this
[1:10:07] scripture
[1:10:09] the wrath is like a fire burning up and
[1:10:11] he's just got to say something you ever
[1:10:13] had that church where you just got gotta
[1:10:15] say something to somebody
[1:10:18] and you let it stew and you let it stew
[1:10:20] and you know it's not you
[1:10:22] you know it's god with my dad this week
[1:10:26] i've had that student on my heart and
[1:10:28] mind for a few weeks there
[1:10:29] that's when cam said i could come i i
[1:10:32] went up for prayer after i preached
[1:10:33] and fasted all day on that wednesday
[1:10:35] night i went up for prayer i said
[1:10:36] can't pray for me that i'll say exactly
[1:10:38] what god wants me to say because it was
[1:10:40] burned by the bank
[1:10:41] it was burning and building it was
[1:10:43] building up praise god
[1:10:45] i just had to say it and then you wait
[1:10:48] for the right time and then you just let
[1:10:49] it flow by the grace of god
[1:10:54] one of the happiest days of my life i'll
[1:10:55] say it like that
[1:10:57] i've had a lot of happy days now don't
[1:10:58] get me wrong that was a great happy day
[1:11:01] to be able to tell my dad exactly here's
[1:11:03] where you've sinned here's where
[1:11:05] people tried to curse you and here's how
[1:11:07] you get rid of it
[1:11:08] the blood of jesus christ amen
[1:11:11] forgiveness
[1:11:12] and love overcomes hatred amen church if
[1:11:15] you want to witness to your parents or
[1:11:16] you want to witness to somebody
[1:11:17] just keep praying about it say god give
[1:11:19] me some wine
[1:11:20] and mature give me the words to say give
[1:11:23] me the opportunity to say it praise god
[1:11:26] his brother bang i told my sister betsy
[1:11:29] about wanting to write a letter to my
[1:11:31] mom and dad
[1:11:31] probably a decade ago i remember sitting
[1:11:34] in their old home
[1:11:35] and i almost had to let her finish then
[1:11:37] 10 years pass
[1:11:38] i forget about it and then look at this
[1:11:40] in the last two months god has given me
[1:11:41] grace
[1:11:42] to address them both by god's grace
[1:11:45] because there's a time and season for
[1:11:48] everything praise god
[1:11:50] and god has given me the desires of my
[1:11:51] heart praise god and i'm just going to
[1:11:53] worship and rejoice
[1:11:54] that god's going to save him amen i'm
[1:11:56] going to say thank you jesus amen
[1:11:58] because if he's allowed me to express
[1:12:00] the truth when i always want to express
[1:12:02] i'm trusting him to finish the rest of
[1:12:04] it amen
[1:12:06] thank the lord amen
[1:12:11] a perfect type of christ look at this
[1:12:13] church
[1:12:14] job cried for a kinsman
[1:12:19] and then god heard his prayer he's in
[1:12:22] the midst church of switching back from
[1:12:24] faith
[1:12:24] to unbelief faith you know doing good
[1:12:27] doing bad and in the midst of there
[1:12:30] he says god send send me a dazeman
[1:12:34] that i could have someone come between
[1:12:36] god and me
[1:12:39] all right so let me get that scripture
[1:12:42] on the days
[1:12:42] here let me pull it up here i got it
[1:12:45] later on but i think i'll just get to it
[1:12:47] uh so then you can see it right now
[1:12:51] if you've got your bible go to job19
[1:12:52] we'll read that while we're here
[1:12:54] yeah go to job19 25.
[1:12:59] remember job doesn't stop talking until
[1:13:02] the end of job chapter 31.
[1:13:04] so in job 19 he has this great
[1:13:06] experience
[1:13:09] but he's still not done complaining and
[1:13:11] that's a word he actually uses i'm not
[1:13:13] making that up
[1:13:14] job actually says i'm giving complaints
[1:13:16] before god i'm complaining about
[1:13:18] god okay
[1:13:21] so i'm letting you know that's job's
[1:13:22] words you know and you know why i can
[1:13:24] say it so plainly because i complain
[1:13:25] sometimes too and i'm guilty of it
[1:13:28] and i sin and i fall short of god's
[1:13:30] glory but i want god to renew my
[1:13:31] strength like the eagle praise god
[1:13:33] just like you did job amen when i fall
[1:13:35] short i want god to raise me up and give
[1:13:37] me strength and i can rise up above that
[1:13:39] next time
[1:13:40] and i can overcome the trial praise god
[1:13:46] job 19 this is this is one of the
[1:13:49] highlight scriptures of the entire book
[1:13:50] right
[1:13:52] remember this is chapter 19 in 27 he
[1:13:55] said god hates me
[1:13:58] see how we can go from shouting on
[1:13:59] sunday
[1:14:02] to complaining on tuesday are you gonna
[1:14:04] be sure
[1:14:05] are you gonna think we can go from
[1:14:06] seeing visions with amen or we see
[1:14:08] something spiritual or god touched me
[1:14:11] and then a few days later god hates me
[1:14:16] you know why because we're human and you
[1:14:19] know what god wants us to teach us to be
[1:14:20] real servants of god
[1:14:22] and sometimes we learn the best is when
[1:14:24] we're humbled and embarrassed
[1:14:32] job 19 25 i praise god ah i feel the
[1:14:34] holy spirit this morning
[1:14:37] look at verse 23 oh that my words are
[1:14:38] written oh that they were printed in a
[1:14:40] book
[1:14:41] that they were graven and look they were
[1:14:43] being written in a book
[1:14:44] that they were graving with the iron pen
[1:14:46] and lead in the rock forever
[1:14:48] now look just this is how much he thinks
[1:14:51] he's right
[1:14:54] god has been wrong god judged it wrong i
[1:14:57] judge it right
[1:14:58] he said let my words be written in steel
[1:15:01] and rock because i'm right
[1:15:04] i don't know i don't know about you
[1:15:05] church but that sounds pretty confident
[1:15:09] praise god oh let's make a monument out
[1:15:11] there and it will inscribe
[1:15:14] my quotes in there because i'm right
[1:15:20] verse 25 for now here now here he starts
[1:15:24] getting into the spirit right here verse
[1:15:25] 25.
[1:15:26] for i know okay i'm sorry yeah this is
[1:15:27] the right this these are the right
[1:15:28] things he wants to say forgive me
[1:15:30] these are the right things he wants to
[1:15:31] say so this is good this is what we do
[1:15:34] want written in steel here sorry
[1:15:36] verse 25 for i know that my redeemer
[1:15:38] liveth and that he shall stand
[1:15:40] at the latter day upon the earth who's
[1:15:42] he speaking of cries
[1:15:43] amen hallelujah so this is in the middle
[1:15:47] of his
[1:15:48] struggle he has this revelation i know a
[1:15:51] redeemer
[1:15:52] and i see him i see him he's a man and
[1:15:54] he's standing on the earth praise god
[1:15:56] amen
[1:15:58] and he says and those after the skin
[1:15:59] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[1:16:01] i'll see god in other words by the way
[1:16:03] he saw his own body resurrected amen
[1:16:08] so he saw his body die in the vision he
[1:16:10] sees jesus break out
[1:16:12] walk on the earth right at the rapture
[1:16:15] praise god
[1:16:16] amen or maybe it was jerusalem after the
[1:16:18] resurrection he saw himself go to the
[1:16:20] ground he says
[1:16:21] he sees worms eating up his body and
[1:16:24] then he sees jesus christ raising from
[1:16:26] the dead
[1:16:26] and then he sees that body resurrected
[1:16:29] and he sees himself standing with jesus
[1:16:31] christ amen
[1:16:34] hallelujah this is in the middle of the
[1:16:36] trial it's not even the end
[1:16:39] we would think oh after i got a
[1:16:41] revelation it's all over
[1:16:42] not not not every time
[1:16:46] oh god touch me at church and i feel
[1:16:48] forgiven and i feel blessed
[1:16:50] it's the end of my trial it may not be
[1:16:53] just hang on though try to hang on to
[1:16:55] the victory as long as you can church
[1:17:01] verse 26 though after my skin warms
[1:17:04] destroy this body yet in my flesh i
[1:17:06] shall see god
[1:17:07] whom i shall see for myself and mine
[1:17:09] eyes shall behold and none other though
[1:17:10] my reigns be consumed
[1:17:12] within me
[1:17:15] now let me show you uh job 9 33 you got
[1:17:18] your bibles there
[1:17:20] let me show you where he asks this is
[1:17:22] beautiful in the midst of his
[1:17:23] complaining and then rejoicing
[1:17:25] complaining rejoicing sounds like our
[1:17:27] week sounds like last week
[1:17:29] right complaining rejoicing on fire
[1:17:32] discouraged huh thinking that many amen
[1:17:36] is on that but i don't know heaven
[1:17:37] saying that right happy down
[1:17:40] excited frustrated hopeful
[1:17:44] hopeless so in the midst of all these
[1:17:48] back and forth
[1:17:49] job says i just wish i had a mediator
[1:17:53] someone that could talk between god and
[1:17:56] me
[1:17:58] verse 32
[1:18:01] for he is not a man as i am that i
[1:18:03] should answer him and we should come
[1:18:05] together in judgment neither is there
[1:18:07] any days men between us that's a kinsmen
[1:18:09] redeemer
[1:18:11] that might lay his hand upon us both so
[1:18:14] see he's having this argument
[1:18:16] this this frustration with god he said i
[1:18:19] wish we could have somebody between us
[1:18:22] that could stand there and help us to
[1:18:23] talk it over praise god amen
[1:18:26] so he prays for this and then god
[1:18:29] gives him a revelation of this in
[1:18:30] chapter 19. and then god
[1:18:33] sends a partial revelation of this
[1:18:35] through eli who praise god amen
[1:18:38] hallelujah since t-shirts even the midst
[1:18:40] of our trials make your requests
[1:18:42] unto god the ones that have a sincere
[1:18:44] attempt
[1:18:45] will be answered amen your prayers that
[1:18:48] you set the right sphere with they'll be
[1:18:50] answered
[1:18:52] praise god see that
[1:18:56] he was up and down up just like our
[1:18:58] months right in our weeks up and down
[1:19:00] up and down but in the midst of those
[1:19:01] hard times he'll make some good requests
[1:19:03] and god hears those two
[1:19:06] because thank you for the bad words
[1:19:08] right but he'll answer
[1:19:10] your honest requests he asked for a daze
[1:19:13] man right
[1:19:14] and even the promise even promised the
[1:19:16] days been in a receipt
[1:19:18] for a redeemer in a vision see god knows
[1:19:22] we need multiple experiences
[1:19:24] reminders encouragements signs
[1:19:27] how many times did god have to visit
[1:19:29] abraham before he finally got isaac
[1:19:31] over and over and over how many signs of
[1:19:35] gideon needed at least three signs
[1:19:38] before he would go out and fight the
[1:19:39] midianites which was a multitude of
[1:19:41] armies none of us have ever did that
[1:19:43] right
[1:19:44] see that's that's the loving god god
[1:19:47] teaches you over time to love him
[1:19:49] and trust him more you struggle he'll
[1:19:51] give you another sign
[1:19:52] you struggle he gives you another
[1:19:54] victory you struggle he'll give you a
[1:19:55] dream
[1:19:57] you struggle he'll give you a healing
[1:19:59] just keep shrugging just keep fighting
[1:20:01] against the devil
[1:20:02] and keep on the fire lines hey man
[1:20:13] here's where he asked for yeah i just i
[1:20:15] should have seen that
[1:20:18] see there's no there's no days between
[1:20:19] there's no one here between god and i
[1:20:21] there's no one as a mediator but the
[1:20:23] bible says there's
[1:20:24] there's one god and one meteor between
[1:20:26] god and man
[1:20:27] the man christ jesus amen
[1:20:30] so joe recognized i i need someone that
[1:20:33] could
[1:20:34] that can feel what i feel there it is
[1:20:36] right there amen
[1:20:39] i feel like god you just can't
[1:20:41] understand
[1:20:43] i need somebody that can kind of stand
[1:20:45] between both of us and god knew it that
[1:20:47] was his son jesus amen
[1:20:49] because he suffered and was tempted in
[1:20:51] all points like we are tempted again
[1:20:54] and the bible said he could be touched
[1:20:56] by the feeling of our infirmities
[1:20:58] amen now we got somebody that can stand
[1:21:01] between us
[1:21:02] it's not a second person either right
[1:21:06] someone that can stand between us and
[1:21:09] understand both sides
[1:21:13] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:21:17] so i'm going to go through some of the
[1:21:18] best words of elihu to read
[1:21:20] boy it hasn't seemed like it's just been
[1:21:22] five minutes here
[1:21:24] so i just got something to read to you
[1:21:26] church here just just let's read here
[1:21:29] so a lot elijah comes out and he's like
[1:21:32] i'm fired up
[1:21:33] i got the fire of god against job
[1:21:36] remember proverbs is a perfect type of
[1:21:39] christ as many as i love i
[1:21:42] rebuke oh brother jesse appreciate a
[1:21:46] real rebuking sermon today
[1:21:47] hopefully it wasn't me church it could
[1:21:49] be me but hopefully it was christ behind
[1:21:50] me
[1:21:51] amen and that would be his love to you
[1:21:53] if it was the right spirit
[1:21:56] not his anger his love
[1:21:59] because as many as i love our you can
[1:22:02] chase him
[1:22:03] also against his three friends was his
[1:22:04] wrath kindly because they found no
[1:22:06] answer
[1:22:07] and yet they condemned job so here's the
[1:22:09] danger of
[1:22:10] judging something before you get a
[1:22:12] vindication that god told you it was
[1:22:15] right
[1:22:17] see job's three friends jesus looked at
[1:22:18] everything and they just told job you
[1:22:20] did this to this
[1:22:21] you're a sinner but they never got a
[1:22:24] vindication from god
[1:22:26] so god sent elijah to rebuke them and
[1:22:28] then may remember later
[1:22:30] then they had to sacrifice at the end of
[1:22:32] the story
[1:22:33] and repent to god and job
[1:22:36] because they they tried to figure out
[1:22:37] the situation without a vindication for
[1:22:39] god what am i saying
[1:22:40] i'm saying before you judge somebody's
[1:22:42] situation pray about it
[1:22:46] because they didn't pray about it the
[1:22:47] bible says if you answer a matter before
[1:22:49] hearing it
[1:22:49] it's folly and shame unto him
[1:22:54] so see they really didn't seek god to
[1:22:56] know they just said well
[1:22:58] job's had this for months sinner
[1:23:02] liar and god
[1:23:06] god stirred up elijah and said these
[1:23:07] guys are wrong too they're all four of
[1:23:09] them are wrong
[1:23:11] right
[1:23:14] now this is beautiful you know what this
[1:23:16] reminded me of job reminds me
[1:23:18] of you and i living in laodicea because
[1:23:21] we
[1:23:22] are we not rich and increased with goods
[1:23:25] but sometimes we're not really hungry
[1:23:27] for spiritual things and the church said
[1:23:31] job was rich had all the goods he could
[1:23:33] wanted
[1:23:36] and god says you need to be gold
[1:23:40] you need some gold he said you need some
[1:23:43] right clothes
[1:23:45] uh you're naked and then i love this he
[1:23:47] says your eyes need anointed
[1:23:49] that you can see your true spiritual
[1:23:51] condition
[1:23:53] okay get your bible let's read it let's
[1:23:55] read job 42 5. get your bible there
[1:23:58] this is perp this was the great this is
[1:24:00] one of the great revelations that came
[1:24:01] this morning
[1:24:02] job is was like a laodicean he's living
[1:24:04] in laodicea
[1:24:05] just like we are job church needed his
[1:24:09] eyes open he was rich and increased with
[1:24:11] goods
[1:24:11] but he needed his eyes open to see his
[1:24:13] real spiritual condition
[1:24:18] in other words he could be more of a
[1:24:20] faithful servant to god
[1:24:24] look at verse five now remember this is
[1:24:26] after god rebukes job
[1:24:28] with 60 plus questions that job cannot
[1:24:30] answer
[1:24:31] one of them
[1:24:35] he's like god has judged me wrong god
[1:24:36] has judged me wrong and god's like let
[1:24:38] me ask you 60 questions
[1:24:39] and can you answer any of them job's
[1:24:42] like i can't answer anything
[1:24:46] i'm so smart i wouldn't judge this right
[1:24:48] uh god laughs at the innocent
[1:24:50] god said answer me one of these
[1:24:51] questions
[1:24:54] job said i can't
[1:24:57] look at verse five i have heard of thee

[1:25:02] bang he knew how to he heard about
[1:25:04] you know making sacrifices i've heard of
[1:25:06] thee by the hearing of the ear but now
[1:25:08] mine i
[1:25:10] see he saw the whirlwind brother amen
[1:25:15] in other words he saw he saw god come
[1:25:16] down to the theophany
[1:25:18] god came down there in the body in the
[1:25:19] theophany
[1:25:21] and showed himself and job said i was
[1:25:24] rich in increase with goods he said but
[1:25:26] now my eyes
[1:25:28] are anointed with eyes out now i can see
[1:25:30] praise god
[1:25:32] is that beautiful praise god
[1:25:35] as many as i love everybody said god
[1:25:37] hates me
[1:25:38] and god said i love you
[1:25:41] i'm giving you real eyesight that's my
[1:25:43] prayer god give me help me to see things
[1:25:45] the right way in 2021 praise god

[1:26:04] happening in my life

[1:26:07] goods god brings correction to him
[1:26:10] and now he says wow now i can see

[1:26:33] discouraging we hear all these quotes
[1:26:35] from brother braham how many of them are

[1:27:24] and jobs that all got to tell their
[1:27:25] opinions now notice god hasn't talked
[1:27:27] one time in this story
[1:27:30] since chapter two when god told satan
[1:27:32] look at job
[1:27:33] you can you can test him but don't take
[1:27:34] his life and god still said job's a
[1:27:37] perfect man
[1:27:38] well now we go since from chapter 3 all
[1:27:41] the way to 32 god hasn't said anything
[1:27:43] god just lets these four men spout out
[1:27:45] all their ideas some of them are good
[1:27:47] some of them are bad
[1:27:50] and eli who says now let me tell you my
[1:27:52] opinion a perfect type of christ
[1:27:55] for i am full of the matter the spirit
[1:27:57] within me constrains me
[1:27:59] the church there sometimes you're going
[1:28:00] to get so full of the holy spirit you
[1:28:02] can't help but say something
[1:28:03] amen praise god
[1:28:07] he said behold this one's i'll say my
[1:28:08] amen behold my belly is as fun remember
[1:28:10] he preached on a new one
[1:28:14] god see sometimes you just got righteous
[1:28:16] in your nation brother man you know
[1:28:17] exactly what god wants you to say
[1:28:20] that it don't happen all the time right
[1:28:22] like i know what happened with my dad
[1:28:23] this time i know it because god benedict
[1:28:24] with cam
[1:28:25] and my dad because he gives every word
[1:28:28] about the two or three witnesses
[1:28:30] you see sometimes that spirit of god is
[1:28:32] just bubbling up in you
[1:28:34] he said my bellies as wine which have no
[1:28:37] bet it's ready to
[1:28:38] burst like new bottles
[1:28:42] oh my god thank god amen what is new
[1:28:45] wine it's a fresh it's a word of god
[1:28:48] amen it's a revelation church
[1:28:52] there's something you know it's right
[1:28:55] you've been
[1:28:55] waiting to say it he sat there and
[1:28:57] waited all these chapters
[1:28:59] chapters 4 3 chapter 4 chapter 5 6
[1:29:02] 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
[1:29:06] 21 22 23
[1:29:08] 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 and now finally
[1:29:12] ready at 32.
[1:29:13] yeah great job like that birthday song
[1:29:15] oh darn it
[1:29:16] are you one are you two
[1:29:20] are you five are you 40 yes i'm 40.
[1:29:24] but see all these checkers eli who's
[1:29:26] sitting there waiting
[1:29:28] and it's just bubbling up bubbling up
[1:29:31] like new wine praise god
[1:29:33] amen hallelujah new eye new revelation
[1:29:37] praise god
[1:29:39] just wait for church try not to let it
[1:29:41] out early
[1:29:43] because the vibes of the spirits of the
[1:29:44] prophets are subject to the
[1:29:46] prophets you say i'm not a prophet well
[1:29:50] part of you is
[1:29:51] the spirit of jesus christ is the spirit
[1:29:53] of prophecy
[1:29:55] sometimes you'll say things and they'll
[1:29:57] come to pass some of you know with your
[1:29:59] dreams you'll see dreams
[1:30:00] they'll come to pass what is that that's
[1:30:03] prophecy
[1:30:04] there's a pro there's a there's an
[1:30:06] element to our experience
[1:30:07] that is prophetic right
[1:30:10] god will show us things to come amen
[1:30:20] some of these things i saw coming that's
[1:30:22] happened recently i'll tell you about it
[1:30:23] more later by god's grace
[1:30:25] just you know little things but i've
[1:30:26] seen it i see it coming
[1:30:28] see it coming so what is a fresh
[1:30:31] revelation it's like wine
[1:30:32] and you got gotta let it grow i say wait
[1:30:34] on it wait on it
[1:30:37] help me to release it lord at the right
[1:30:39] time
[1:30:40] remember church the bible said a gift
[1:30:42] will make room for itself
[1:30:45] when it's god's time for you to speak it
[1:30:47] will open up it'll be plain you'll be
[1:30:49] ready to say it
[1:30:50] amen if you're ready to go it'll be the
[1:30:53] right time
[1:30:54] because you waited on god and god will
[1:30:56] orchestrate everything
[1:31:00] i will speak that i may be refreshed so
[1:31:03] the wine that comes out of elijah
[1:31:06] just not only refreshes others it
[1:31:08] refreshes him
[1:31:10] praise god see when you speak god's word
[1:31:13] they get blessed but also you get
[1:31:15] blessed
[1:31:17] this is new wine but amen where there's
[1:31:20] new wine there's new power
[1:31:23] glory when you speak god's word you get
[1:31:25] refreshed it feels like everything's
[1:31:27] brand new again amen
[1:31:29] that's when it's god's wine not our wine
[1:31:32] we're not our whining can i say it like
[1:31:34] that not our wine
[1:31:36] but god's wine god's word
[1:31:39] god's revelation i guess i'm just so
[1:31:40] excited about this because i just saw it
[1:31:42] with my dad on thursday so
[1:31:44] and then with cam church on wednesday
[1:31:45] night where the holy spirit just pours
[1:31:46] out like that
[1:31:47] people people are just rejoicing and
[1:31:49] crying and being blessed
[1:31:54] so he says i've been waiting this wine
[1:31:55] has been growing in me
[1:31:57] and i'm going to get refreshed through
[1:31:58] this in other words the burden of the
[1:32:01] holy spirit
[1:32:02] is going to let be let off me because
[1:32:03] i've spoken what god wanted me to say
[1:32:07] i feel like that almost every week i got
[1:32:09] a burden to preach something and then
[1:32:11] when i preach i'm like oh thank god
[1:32:14] thank you jesus and then a couple days
[1:32:15] later i got another burden i gotta
[1:32:16] preach
[1:32:18] right let me not i pray you accept any
[1:32:21] man's person so he says
[1:32:22] see now look he's gonna be fair judge
[1:32:24] jesus is a fair judge
[1:32:25] jesus doesn't respect anyone above
[1:32:27] anyone else
[1:32:29] neither let me give flattering titles
[1:32:31] unto man oh mr joe great job sir
[1:32:34] holy father job because i ain't doing
[1:32:36] any of that stuff
[1:32:38] for i know not to give flattering titles
[1:32:40] and so doing my maker would soon take me
[1:32:42] away
[1:32:44] out of his presence right out of his
[1:32:45] blessings when we start exalting men or
[1:32:47] women above other men or women
[1:32:49] the bible said god takes you away from
[1:32:51] his presence right you go leave the
[1:32:52] holiness of god and you
[1:32:54] give a you go into a worldly life
[1:33:01] the spirit of god hath made me i'm sorry
[1:33:04] the spirit of god hath made me and the
[1:33:06] breath of the almighty has given me life
[1:33:08] that's jesus right the logos
[1:33:12] if thou canst answer me set thy words in
[1:33:14] order before me stand up so look he's
[1:33:15] even challenged a joke
[1:33:16] stand up if you can answer me in church
[1:33:18] if you know the story job never answers
[1:33:20] elihu
[1:33:23] so see he couldn't answer because he was
[1:33:24] wrong look at the holy spirit challenge
[1:33:27] if you can challenge it stand up and say
[1:33:30] something against it
[1:33:31] and job just sits there the whole time
[1:33:34] because this is christ
[1:33:36] right and christ is the judge aren't you
[1:33:39] glad he's the judge of your life
[1:33:42] and aren't you glad he's your advocate
[1:33:43] and you're a lawyer as well
[1:33:47] behold i am oh here it is i am according
[1:33:50] to thy wish in god's dead see
[1:33:52] this is where eli who is saying i'm the

[1:36:27] to repeat to you joe but you said
[1:36:29] you said you had no iniquity and eli
[1:36:33] who's like

[1:36:36] not for me if god is for us who can be
[1:36:39] against us
[1:36:40] amen praise god we read that on friday

[1:36:43] romans 8 if god is for us who can be
[1:36:46] against us
[1:36:46] praise god no matter how small the
[1:36:49] church is no matter who comes or goes
[1:36:51] if god is for us who can be dead

[1:37:11] and you'll come out a better christian
[1:37:12] on the other end
[1:37:15] oh thank the lord amen oh thank you
[1:37:18] jesus
[1:37:19] i hope this one is being recorded
[1:37:20] because i might have to study this one
[1:37:22] out and write a book about this one
[1:37:23] later
[1:37:24] ah look what see this is all jobs got
[1:37:26] iniquity then
[1:37:28] right job's really unclean he says he's
[1:37:30] clean but really he's unclean
[1:37:33] i thought he was perfect well he is by
[1:37:34] the blood but his human spirit's not
[1:37:37] perfect
[1:37:37] that'll happen later when he gets that
[1:37:39] new body
[1:37:41] when he finally gets that new body when
[1:37:43] he stands with the redeemer
[1:37:45] on the earth
[1:37:49] his mind will be perfect once he gets
[1:37:52] that new body
[1:37:53] that theophany body and i'll say like
[1:37:55] this glorified body too
[1:37:56] amen once you get that glorified body
[1:37:58] where it can eat again
[1:37:59] but that theophany will house his human
[1:38:02] spirit and human soul
[1:38:04] and he'll no longer think any more evil
[1:38:06] thoughts
[1:38:07] oh thank you god i can't wait for that
[1:38:09] hallelujah
[1:38:10] thank you jesus when i think no more
[1:38:13] evil thoughts
[1:38:14] it's only pure thoughts praise god
[1:38:20] how i long for that
[1:38:24] let's read eight through 13. go down to
[1:38:26] verse
[1:38:28] 10 10 he says he's god's enemy no
[1:38:31] no no joke no no god's not against you
[1:38:34] god's for you verse 11 he put
[1:38:37] my feet in the stocks and he market all
[1:38:40] my past in other words god put me in
[1:38:41] prison
[1:38:43] god locked me up in prison
[1:38:47] verse 12 behold in this thou are not
[1:38:49] just
[1:38:50] so here now eli who's saying you're not
[1:38:52] just joke
[1:38:54] i will answer thee that god is greater
[1:38:57] than man so what was he saying the whole
[1:38:59] time i'm greater than god
[1:39:03] i'm greater he did something wrong
[1:39:06] see how we're starting to see how what
[1:39:08] kind of man joe was
[1:39:11] i do because i move him just like i am
[1:39:15] and if god still saw him perfect by the
[1:39:18] blood
[1:39:19] what is he going to say about you and i
[1:39:20] praise god amen
[1:39:22] he did all this brother bang and god
[1:39:24] still says
[1:39:37] we're more just than god is no see this
[1:39:40] is how much god loves you church
[1:39:41] even in the midst of all your mind
[1:39:43] battles and all the struggles he doesn't
[1:39:45] count that against you
[1:39:46] because he knows your desire is to serve
[1:39:48] him and he knows you're trusting in his
[1:39:50] righteousness and not your own
[1:39:59] job thought he was greater than god
[1:40:00] verse 13 why does thou strive against
[1:40:03] him
[1:40:03] for he giveth not account of any of his
[1:40:06] matters so look
[1:40:07] job is fighting against god
[1:40:10] his words brother man we're fighting
[1:40:12] against the holy s
[1:40:16] who told him that jesus
[1:40:20] who's going to tell you and you're wrong
[1:40:21] jesus
[1:40:23] he's going to tell you the things the
[1:40:24] holy spirit will never be buttered up
[1:40:27] the holy spirit will always tell you
[1:40:28] this is what you did wrong that was
[1:40:30] wrong
[1:40:31] that was wrong
[1:40:36] look at verse 14 through 18. for god
[1:40:39] speaketh once yea
[1:40:40] twice yet man perceiveth a not now look
[1:40:42] what eli who's telling him this is the
[1:40:44] chapter about dreams brother
[1:40:47] god speaks to us many times in dreams
[1:40:48] and we just forget how many dreams have
[1:40:50] you forgot
[1:40:50] this last year i wake up and i always
[1:40:54] but here joe eli who's going to say god
[1:40:56] many times speaks twists and dreams
[1:40:58] with the same dream over and over just
[1:41:00] forget about it but it's god speaking to
[1:41:02] us
[1:41:05] in a dream and a vision of the night
[1:41:07] when the deep sleep falls upon men
[1:41:09] and slumbering upon the bed then he
[1:41:10] openeth the ears of men and sealed
[1:41:12] their instruction look at that he opens
[1:41:15] your ears
[1:41:16] so you can really get the instruction
[1:41:19] god is trying to get it to you in the
[1:41:22] end time
[1:41:24] god's in other words god is trying to
[1:41:25] help you understand praise god
[1:41:27] but we've got to be more spirit right at
[1:41:30] night time we can't be thinking about
[1:41:31] other things we have to think about god
[1:41:33] we wake up we can't be thinking about
[1:41:34] other things we got to be thinking about
[1:41:35] god
[1:41:37] he's trying to speak to us in the night
[1:41:40] that he may withdraw man from his
[1:41:42] purpose and hide pride from man oh
[1:41:44] he's trying to get man away from his
[1:41:46] pride
[1:41:48] that's what he's doing oh he's trying to
[1:41:49] get help him to stop being so prideful
[1:41:55] he's trying to help us not to be so
[1:41:56] prideful oh why do i need to pray more
[1:41:59] why do i need to go to more services why
[1:42:00] do i need to read my bible more
[1:42:02] he's trying to get us away from pride
[1:42:04] praise god
[1:42:07] we want to see miracles we'll have you
[1:42:08] before right
[1:42:10] you want to see god saved say people
[1:42:12] when was the last time we praised
[1:42:13] somebody
[1:42:14] to be saved we got to stop being so
[1:42:16] prideful
[1:42:18] right you know because whatever you do
[1:42:19] the most that's what you really want
[1:42:21] right
[1:42:21] you spend more time in prayer and you
[1:42:23] know that shows you really want that
[1:42:24] that's where your treasures are
[1:42:27] right we spend more time wasting time
[1:42:29] i'm not talking about things we have to
[1:42:30] do i'm talking about things we don't
[1:42:31] have to do
[1:42:32] we spend more time wasting time that
[1:42:34] shows really what we're after
[1:42:41] yes now look at verse 18
[1:42:44] god is keeping back his soul from the
[1:42:46] pit and his life
[1:42:47] from perishing by the sword so
[1:42:50] eli who says god is constantly doing
[1:42:52] this he's trying to protect us
[1:42:54] he's saving our life many times he's
[1:42:57] keeping us from dying
[1:42:59] and he's doing everything he can to try
[1:43:01] to get us to open up our hearts to
[1:43:03] receive his instruction
[1:43:08] amen is that through that verse eighteen
[1:43:11] okay
[1:43:14] now nineteen three two through thirty
[1:43:16] three
[1:43:20] let me uh
[1:43:25] i need to find a place to close
[1:43:28] yeah let's read this because this is
[1:43:29] prophetic here elijah prophesies to job
[1:43:32] right in the this beginning part of his
[1:43:34] speech verse 19 he's chastened also with
[1:43:36] pain upon his bed and the multitude of
[1:43:38] his bones with strong pain
[1:43:40] so that his life abhorth bread and his
[1:43:42] soul dainty meat
[1:43:43] his flesh is consumed away that it
[1:43:44] cannot be seen his bones that were not
[1:43:47] seen stick out yea his soul draweth near
[1:43:49] into the grave
[1:43:50] and his life to the destroyers she's
[1:43:52] talking about men who get sick
[1:43:54] and get close to dying if there be a
[1:43:57] messenger with him an interpreter
[1:43:58] one among a thousand to show on demand
[1:44:00] his uprightness
[1:44:02] then now look here it is then god is
[1:44:04] gracious
[1:44:06] unto him and saith deliver him from
[1:44:09] going down to the pit
[1:44:11] i have found a ransom
[1:44:15] think about how god save bang's life i'm
[1:44:17] sorry bang's dad's life
[1:44:18] from going down to the pit praise god
[1:44:23] this is what eli who's saying we don't
[1:44:25] even realize it's the god bringing
[1:44:27] us we do now right but sometimes we
[1:44:29] don't realize god has spared our lives
[1:44:30] so many times
[1:44:32] because he's merciful and the bible said
[1:44:34] he's
[1:44:35] gracious
[1:44:39] so he keeps us from dying he restores
[1:44:43] our strength
[1:44:44] like my brother paul he was sick for two
[1:44:47] weeks he had
[1:44:48] covet and pneumonia and he didn't he
[1:44:51] didn't leave off that bed except that
[1:44:53] you don't use the business
[1:44:54] he didn't leave off that couch for two
[1:44:56] whole weeks thought he was gonna die
[1:44:58] when he finally got up he went to the uh
[1:45:00] emergency room the game steroids really
[1:45:02] that's basically nothing i
[1:45:04] really can't do nothing for you and he
[1:45:07] has a greater appreciation for god now
[1:45:10] almost died amen pneumonia kills stop
[1:45:15] he's the one giving us more chances and
[1:45:17] more mercy amen
[1:45:19] and helping teach us to love him more
[1:45:21] and be more like him
[1:45:28] then he is gracious i look at verse 25
[1:45:30] here's the prophecy here's thus saith
[1:45:32] the lord brother
[1:45:32] his flesh shall be fresher than a child
[1:45:36] right now job's flesh is black and red
[1:45:38] and purple
[1:45:39] it's rotting but eli who says god just
[1:45:42] man like that and then he's gracious and
[1:45:45] that's what job is going to get in just
[1:45:47] a chapter just praise god
[1:45:48] he shall return to the days of his youth
[1:45:51] did he not brother amen
[1:45:53] he got all 10 kids back he saw four
[1:45:55] generations his son's son son
[1:45:58] praise god we got twice the money back
[1:46:04] this is god's grace unto you praise god
[1:46:07] this
[1:46:07] is how god it's not like i know better
[1:46:09] than god no god is very gracious
[1:46:12] god is very kind very patient
[1:46:15] he wants man to get it he wants man to
[1:46:17] be victorious he wants man to trust in
[1:46:20] him
[1:46:22] so let us go so close to the grave so
[1:46:24] close to the pit but then raise us up
[1:46:26] and restore
[1:46:26] everything to us my dad told me when he
[1:46:30] had covered for two weeks
[1:46:31] he said he had to breathe like this in
[1:46:32] order to make it through the day
[1:46:37] he said if he did more than that he
[1:46:38] would choke so my dad laid there for two
[1:46:41] weeks like this
[1:46:46] i said dad god brought you up from the
[1:46:48] pit
[1:46:49] praise god i said because god is not
[1:46:52] done with you dad
[1:46:55] i said there's still people out here you
[1:46:56] can win to the lord there's still
[1:46:58] something you can do for jesus christ
[1:47:00] hey man
[1:47:01] imagine that sucking on air
[1:47:05] for two weeks and then now he's up and
[1:47:08] around
[1:47:09] i'm giving him hugs i'm lifting him up
[1:47:10] you know he's all fine now he's still
[1:47:12] smoking sick
[1:47:12] back to smoking cigarettes to me that's
[1:47:15] god's mercy
[1:47:16] not that he smokes but that god raised
[1:47:17] him up from the dead
[1:47:19] almost the dead to give him another
[1:47:23] chance to me that's amazing grace church
[1:47:28] and the same thing for your life and my
[1:47:30] life let me finish this chapter and then

[1:48:05] for he will render unto man's
[1:48:07] righteousness he look upon men and if
[1:48:08] any say i have sinned and perverted that
[1:48:10] which was right

[1:48:12] his soul from going

[1:48:19] times how much
[1:48:21] often often god will bring people close
[1:48:25] to death
[1:48:25] and then bring them back to give them
