========================================

amen amen praise the Lord you know it's just by the by the grace that he has for us oh my it's good to see people worshiping oh I just love it and no I didn't know that a testimony was given but sister Emma just told me when we were leaving the restaurant that it's been since since March or somewhere around there since she's since the since the devil even tried to dare to bother her with a with a seizure and I thank God for that wow what a mighty God we serve amen praise the Lord and you know the you know a lot of times is I'm done thank you uh there's a lot of people want to say uh pray for my my situation of this pray for pray for the disease that I have they call it their disease well it's not their disease amen so that's the first thing is you got to deny that that it's even yours so I just had to tell her this is your freedom it's not your disease but it's your freedom that's exactly where it lies so I thank God for that wow I just love to hear testimonies you know people testifying of of God's goodness uh just going to get into the word this evening if you would uh turn with me to First Corinthians chapter 12 I was kind of tossed on on on a couple subjects and just felt uh felt led to go this this direction and pardon me one moment I forgot my water 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 4 it says now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the Spirit by the spirit of the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfs Same Spirit dividing to every man severly as he will also turn with me to James chapter 4 and verse 15 and this is something that we that we should know because when we say well I'm going to do this I'm G to do that uh my my children have been doing that lately well I'm going to do this well how about if you ask first you know they they kind of uh forget the step they're just so comfortable with Mommy and Daddy and uh they just come hey we're going to go do this but first what don't you ask so James 4:15 it says for that ye ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this or that but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin let's look to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you for the day that you you've given us that we continue in Lord that you've given us Grace to to continue uh to a second service and Lord it's the same as the first and any time that we come and Minister lord I can't do it without you I just pray that you just come and take over my body my spirit and just let your let your spirit come and take control father Lord just pray that the words that would come from my mouth would would be yours and that it would Bless the people Lord we ask it all in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated okay so we so we read that scripture and we went through the the operations of of the different gifts now what uh what I'd like to speak on is Discerning what is good and what is evil if if you pay if you notice in the in the uh scripture uh I lost it uh verse 10 1 Corinthians 12 and verse 10 it says to another the working of Miracles we we we know that there's uh people that could work miracles we know brother brandham did it there are other people that are able to do it to another one uh to prophesy uh or to prophecy uh to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kind of tongues to another interpretation of tongues but the one that I would I uh want to concentrate on is the Discerning of spirits there are some that have a a gift of discernment that can uh like brother Bram had in the prayer line when he uh when people would come forth uh he would break out in discernment he would have a vision that that's a gift of discerning okay that's a gift of discernment but uh to all of us we should have some level of discernment of spirits uh not that we have the the gift to go to different different churches and say hey I have the gift of discerning but we should have at least a minimal amount of of discernment in our lives uh so uh talking to people in the past you know about different things about uh you know things of what what are good what are bad things that they shouldn't do talking about smoking you shouldn't be smoking you shouldn't be chewing tobacco you shouldn't be drinking well who says who says that that's bad who who Who's to say what is good and what is evil uh so what is good and evil uh it's our morals uh like the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's that's pretty much talking about our morals and the way uh that we conduct Our Lives what is right and what is wrong so uh some say uh the good and evil it's our or discernment uh it's our moral compass that guides us our our morals are our uh our compass that guides us uh so sometimes our question are some people's Compass are those compasses broken because it seems like it doesn't work uh like brother uh amen and I were talking on the way back you know people that saying that they're they're Christians or whatever why you drinking why you smoke why you you doing all these things and it and it appears that they're just uh make Believers I I guess you could say or or uh Hypocrites and and Lord be it far from us that any of us would be a hypocrite right for we don't want to do that uh we don't we don't want to have that kind of a heart we don't want to have that kind of a life that we would live a life of a hypocrite do we have bumps do we have valleys and mountains yes we do but that doesn't mean that we are a hypocrite because we try to live the best that we can we try to live the truth sometimes we fall and that's just the way way things are because uh I I've I've heard people uh with the struggle why can't I do good all the time it's because we're stuck in this flesh all the time so this this is our greatest enemy right here is every time you look in the mirror you're looking at your greatest enemy not not that you're foes with one another but it's a constant War of the spirit and the flesh it it's constant because the inside man wants to do right but the outside man you know uh might be tempted in Sugar which which we know that Sugar isn't really good for the body body and uh so I'm I'm sure the Smith family goes through all that stuff so sugar is not good for us so are we are we uh uh oh what's the word that I'm looking for are we uh defiling our body because we're putting sugar some people would say yes some people would say no I like sugar it's not a defilement a defilement would be on the the inside not so much uh the Inside Man spiritual not so much the Inside Man uh natural but it does have an effect on your body different things that you eat and different things that you partake of have different effects on our bodies so what I want to ask is are we okay with letting down the bars so when when we see that we're getting getting uh a little easy or or complacent that we might say and then we then all of a sudden we realize hey wait a second I shouldn't be doing this you know six months ago I thought this was wrong but why all of a sudden am I thinking that it's okay to do you know uh why am I watching I love Susie when I didn't I didn't like such and such you know uh that was not as bad as as as uh I Love Lucy and things like that so uh where where is it that we draw the lines of our good and evil so who determines what is good and what is bad uh ultimately God in the beginning he he pretty much laid out everything you know uh in in Genesis and then he had the the law and uh uh Exodus Numbers Deuteronomy different things uh all through there uh through the levitical priesthood uh they had all the different laws and that's how they were to manage the people that they had to uh the Lord had to establish some kind of laws he had to or or or it would be Anarchy if you have a place of Anarchy well nobody's in charge there are no no rules or everybody for himself but what what happens when when somebody has Pride somebody gets greedy and then they start attacking other people people where do you draw the line for a law or a rule or just let everybody uh Run free you know as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so what what's on in in a man's heart that's what he's going to perform you know and and most times uh in a man's heart it's is full of wickedness it's full of evil because that's that's just the nature of or that's just the human nature uh it even even most times uh as we uh as we live you could tell if some something is wrong or if it's right just by the way that you feel after doing the action you know I took such and such as candy bar that that probably wasn't the right thing to do maybe I ought to give it back well and like zakus maybe do it two or three fourfold or whatever you know you didn't get to see the picture but my wife got me this whole tree of candy bars there were 27 candy bars on that and brother brother a how are you going to eat all those I'm not I'm going to share but you know obviously we know like we were talking this morning not everybody agrees with our views not everybody sees uh the way that we see not everybody believes in the way that we that we believe you know some people think lying is okay we don't think lying is okay we think lying is a bad thing to do because it it's it's dishonest and we don't want to be dishonest we want to be honest people we want to be that uh that vessel of Honor that's that's my desire that I I I believe it's your desire as well that we are the vessel of Honor we don't want to be a vessel of Dison uh most people think that it's wrong to kill we know uh one of the Ten Commandments is Thou shalt not kill but some people you know there are psychopaths out there sociopaths whatever you want to call them uh they they think they're doing the world a favor by you know serial killers they think that they're doing the world of favor by ridding something else evil you know but that that's not the way that we operate you know we don't do one evil thing to eliminate another evil thing because all in all it's evil you know uh so if you look at the the abortion uh argument you know some people think that it's okay to kill a baby they don't look at it as killing a baby they just see uh I I can't even think of their argument they're they're just killing a a lump of cells while me on the other hand I'm horrified by even the thought of of abortion because it's taking an innocent baby's life uh whether you think it's a lump of cells or not it's still alive it's still alive clump of cells but what the you're destroying the potential now if you take those same people and you and you sit them down if you block every Avenue of their potential in life they would get pretty upset so how is it that they can move freely sorry I I don't mean to get on the abortion thing but I can't help it uh but how is it that they could move so freely everything is so selfish and that's where it lies is is self- gratitude well if I don't if I don't abort this baby just think of what I'm going to look like after the delivery so what you know it it's not about that it's about you being responsible you you were the one who was the grownup enough to do what you did to get in that predicament now be grown up enough to get out of it by continuing on see uh what you reap is what you sow so or what you seow is what you'll reap you you know what I mean so uh just the way our our actions every action that we do has some kind of a consequence there's going to be some kind of a reaction something else has to take place so I I can't I can't see the abortion uh argument as being something good all I can see is that it's all evil because it's taking an innocent life I didn't mean to spend so much time on that but uh continuing on see uh rules were not really uh put into place except it came through a covenant right uh uh or unless it was specifically spoken by God so uh in the beginning we didn't uh you know Adam and Eve didn't really have any rules except two rules you could eat of the one tree but don't eat of the other tree that's that's as far as we know of what of what the the rules were okay so and we know Adam and Eve that disob disobeyed which was a punishable uh effect right uh it was a it was a punishable action for what they did because they they went against what they were told not to do so therefore a punishment came see even the serpent they were both cursed right so why wasn't Adam cursed if you notice Adam wasn't the one cursed but the ground was cursed see Adam was an image of God that was made God couldn't curse himself right so uh so we find out with Cain and Abel uh when they're born and with their actions when they uh as far as we know nothing nothing in scripture says Cain and Abel uh you need to uh bring a sacrifice we we don't know that we don't know how the instructions were given but uh there was a time that they uh felt that they needed to bring a sacrifice and we know Cain brought a a a sacrifice of the ground you know something from the garden different things might have been pumpkins might have been artichokes who knows know what it was but he brought a a a sacrifice from the ground where Abel brought a blood sacrifice see there was a revelation there but we don't know uh we don't know the instructions that was given to either one of them maybe it was on the inside of them you know because the Holy Spirit you know that's how the scriptures that's how prophecy is done right so uh everything by inspiration by the moving of the Holy Spirit by the moving of God right so so when it came to it there was no rules set that when uh Abel did well because God laid it out there look Cain if you do like like Abel did you know all thing will be all things will be well you know if you do according to Abel because that's what I'm pleased with but if you don't do according to what Abel did then sin lith at the door and that's the first place where we where we learn what sin is right so uh and then we find out that Cain slew Abel there was nothing said beforeand hey you shouldn't kill one another you know that's not a right thing to do but uh but that was also a punishable offense again we don't know exactly what the the uh the ground ground rules were in the beginning so how did how did God know that that Cain slew Abel uh we we know that through the scripture where he says he uh that he heard the voice of Abel's blood crying from the ground but see even after that uh God was saying that Cain you're going to be punished for what you're doing and he laid out the punishment and then Cain whin and cried and said hey this punishment is way too much for me to bear so then he so God laid out the stipulation any man that kills Cain that's going to be punishable as well but leave him alone so God made the God made the decree uh to not kill him for his wrongdoing so there was there was no capital punishment laid down so so what is good you know the the the age-old question what is good well things that are this is you might think this is a Sunday school answer uh but God works in simplicity so what is good things that are of God Philippians chapter 4 verse 7 it says and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds uh through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you so when that that that kind of alludes to the the thought that if I do these things God is going to be with me but if I don't do these things God will not be with me it kind of stands for uh reasonable statement so then if we if we think of what things are evil so why do we call things evil uh what what ex what would be evil well things that are not of God things that are of Satan right uh 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 9 sorry this might be a basic message this evening but it it's it's just something simple so 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 9 it says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God that's a pretty long list there but it's kind of laying it out avoid these things stay away from these things because it's going to take you away from God right so uh First Corinthians kind of going back there in ver excuse me chapter five and verse 9 bear with me I have a few things to get through in the scripture I don't dare bring my own word but I I got to back it up with scripture right so 1 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 9 says I wrote unto you in an epistle excuse me not to company with fornicators yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the Covetous or extortioners or with idolators for then must ye needs go out of the world he's saying you're going to encounter this stuff into the world he's not saying uh you know to not company with them of course you want to stay away from that kind of an atmosphere but uh let's see in verse 11 it says but now I have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother okay if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or Covetous or an idolator or a or a drunkard or an extortioner with such a one know not to eat why because those are the ones that are supposed to know better that's that's uh uh iniquity doing something that you know is wrong but yet you do it anyway so that that's kind of being in the company of hypocrite knowingly doing things evil while proclaiming to still be good that's the kind of an atmosphere that we definitely want to stay away from right because we don't we don't want to be partakers with them so verse verse 12 it says for what have I to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within another scripture says judgment begins at the house of the Lord right so this is where judgment begins we're not here to judge those that are out in the world but we're here to judge one another that we're that we're here members of of of the church members of Christ I guess you could say uh he says but them uh so do not ye judge them that are within so judgment starts at the house of God verse 13 it says but them that are without God them that are without God judgeth so we leave that for God to judge so therefore put away from among yourselves that Wicked person now see somebody that's committing these types of things he lays it out here that that is wickedness that is evil okay so and people are so confused in this day where they call good and they call good evil excuse me they call good evil and they call evil good uh we could all see that right because some people are saying abortion oh that's a good thing it's protecting the woman you can't tell me that 100% of abortions are are are protecting the woman it's done because of it because of its irresponsibility is why so many women do that and first it was designed to help save the woman that's the the the justification of it because if there was a woman that was that was going to be uh was going to die in child birth they wanted to try to save a woman right so uh but I don't see that the case we see that that's a very small percentage of the amount of women that that that uh have a hard uh have hardship with childbirth and possibly die from it my wife I'm I'm I'm not trying to brag or anything but it's by God's grace that she uh when we had Isaac uh she had the near stroke condition okay I I can't remember the term for it but uh her blood pressure was high it was Triple digits and they wanted to induce the baby and they said she it was close to Cheyenne's birthday hey can we wait such and such a date nope we're not waiting any longer we're going to take you in it was like the next day or two days after but they weren't even going to let her wait okay but we were going to keep Isaac anyways so that that's just the way it is uh so Roman chapter 6 and verse 15 if if you haven't noticed I don't support abortion at all so uh I I think they're arguments are weak they they try to and I'm not an intellectual that could even try to get scientific with them but morally I think it's wrong absolutely wrong especially when you know what they they the majority most of it is what they're using it for I was going to say something or not we're abstinence is the key so uh Romans 65 it says What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid so just because we feel that we're not under the law because we're under grace that doesn't give us a ticket to go out and do whatever kind of stuff that we want to do that doesn't mean that we can go rob a bank because I need to uh pay my rent or you might have enough money to pay your rent you just want to want the big Jeep Wrangler that looks like a Humvee or whatever I don't know what what those are called but you know you see where the greed comes in where does it stop and and that's why a lot of people do what they do whether it's out of greed or whether it's out of a a a selfish motive verse 16 it says know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are to him you obey whether nether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so you're either going to serve sin or you're going to serve righteousness But whichever one you yield yourself to that's the one you're going to be servant to so verse 17 it says but God be thanked that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you you mean Doctrine gave Deliverance absolutely because it was of the right Doctrine rightly divide the word of God so Verse 18 it says being then made free from sin you became the Servants of righteousness I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity it's one thing after another it's one filthy act unto another filthy act unto another filthy act it just leads one to another to another and it's not going to give you any Deliverance so long as you're being a servant of uncleanness you're just going to live a life that's full of uncleanliness so even so now yield your yield your memb servants to righteousness unto Holiness and I thank God that we're able to do that amen so for when you were the Servants of sin you were free from righteousness you were free from all these dos and don'ts of of what we believe you know Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife and all these things you're free from that see people don't want to serve righteousness because they want to do those things that's what's in their heart to do see when you're a servant of sin you're free from righteousness you don't have to live by the dos and don'ts but what fruit do you had then in those things whereof you are now ashamed see we we tell our stories you know uh sister Naomi we probably tell our children stories or friends stories we test ify what God brought us from to what we are now you know some people they they laugh it up and they and they're yeah I got away with this and I got away with that with no sorrow in their testimony because there should be and and I'm guilty of that I've I've done that before you know uh you just talk about how how how bad you were or or things like that and who knows what it was going to what it was leading up to but but still it should be a shameful feeling because if that's what Drew us to repent repentance we were ashamed then why aren't we ashamed of it now that same shame which caused us to repent should remain the same shame or even more more sorrow because of what we did but in verse 21 it says what fruit had ye then in those things whereof you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death for the wages of sin is death right well sorry getting getting ahead of myself verse 22 but now being made free from sin and and become servants to God you have your fruits unto Holiness in the end everlasting life see it's what we're looking to what we want to serve or what we yield ourselves to in verse 23 it says for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord but see since we've separated ourselves from those things we could move on unto righteousness we can move on to a clean life amen so then after after Genesis after uh Cain and Abel we see that there weren't a whole lot of rules established but it was uh since Moses came of course there were you know talking to Abraham making different covenants because that's how the rules came is through a covenant right it was a conditional thing if you do such and such if you obey me here I will bless you here you know that's pretty much what the Covenant was you do this you be obedient I will give but if you break it you won't get so we we see that as kind of a rule so it wasn't until uh Exodus and Leviticus uh and and uh numbers in Deuteronomy where there were a whole lot more rules that were applied right so and again covenants they were made uh in in trust with conditions uh so we everybody knows what a covenant is a it as agreement between two parties so and the with the expectation of trust to carry it out for each party to carry out their burden of the Covenant so when it was broken he that knows to do good but doesn't it's a it is a sin unto him right so uh we had uh I don't know how many covenants there were I I can't think I want to say that there were seven covenants but but we know we had Adam we had we had Noah we had uh Abraham we had Moses we had David and then we had the Messiah and I'm missing one somewhere in there uh you know if you look it up they they've got all kinds of different things in there the Palestinian Covenant the New Covenant the power Covenant or I can't even remember what they're term it why can't we just stick to the scripture of of what the Covenant is you know you know some people just make things more complicated because they want to look more spiritual than what they actually are so the most popular thing about the the rules or the laws are known as the Ten Commandments right everybody knows the Ten Commandments or or at least a couple or a few uh let's see can't make I don't even know why that's but any the scripture also tells us that we ought to listen to those you know be obedient unto those that have rule over us and uh just as we read through uh the different gifts you know the gifts of Miracles the diffs Gifts of discerning of spirits and the different things so uh we see as the the five-fold ministry they have different uh they ALS there's also different gifts as far as excuse me the five-fold ministry because not everybody's a pastor not everybody's a uh an apostle not everybody's a prophet you know uh not everybody's just a a preacher or the different things an evangelist uh but the scripture also tells us to be obedient to those that have the rule over us not as in a in a a thumb but those that watch after our souls amen because they they should have a genuine concern for our well-being that whenever they see us do something or see the church uh doing something that some that they're somewhere along the line there there should be coming a rebuke because the discernment of Good and Evil should should be should be made right so you look upon the the church you see how the church is behaving H this just doesn't seem right you know it could be from the pulpit it could be in from the congregation whatever it might be somebody might well I don't see that that seems to be heresy they're not acting quite just right and then it gets called out by what by a discernment whether it's an evangelist that comes whether it's a preacher like myself that comes or whether it's your pastor you know the discernment could go forth because I don't know what you think about when you're when you lay your head on your pillow I don't know what you think about at night and I don't know what you think about at lunchtime so you see it it's the inspiration or the discernment of the holy spirit it's not it's not the man that really has the discernment unless they're able to read minds you know unless they have that actual gift of discernment we won't know but there is a time if everything if if you sin and you come into the prayer line everything is repented of brother Bram said that he wouldn't be able to see that because it's under the blood but he also gave the warning if you come up for prayer don't come with sin in your life because it'll be called out in public right it was that discernment that went to work why to embarrass that person no to get them clean to get them right to get them into repentance that they could have a confidence to receive from the Lord that that there's no more condemnation in the heart but it that is pure amen see and that's and that's where it falls of of of those that that have the rule over you again it's it's not a dictatorship but it's who's looking after your souls for the betterment not to say no no no I'm I'm ahead over you that's that that's the wrong Spirit that's the wrong attitude and I wouldn't want somebody like that in the popit you know I I wouldn't be hanging around if somebody was like that you know being condescending uh uh to to the congregation and saying I'm so much higher than you I'm sure brother Jesse doesn't feel that way because he's he's going to be open and honest to say hey I've got faults and failures too I'm know I'm know better than anybody else in here I I know he feels that way because he's got something hanging on his wall right there that attributes that you know to be a servant to men right but it's not whether you know gifts and callings are without repentance so it so where where does that fall that falls in with the gifts okay so gifts and callings are without repentance so if somebody's called to do something you don't have to repent to do to do such and such but if you're going to watch after somebody if you're going to be a servant unto the Lord the desire should be to be clean before the Lord amen because that's that's what the Levites had to do is they had to cleanse themselves even before they went in into the temple into the holiest of holies they had to have a purification they had to be cleansed and and being it far from us if there's a minister up here that that that just lives in sin and comes and tries to pray for you again it's not the man right but it's the faith unto the believer see I wouldn't want to do I I wouldn't want to do something like that I would feel so horrible and and sometimes I do over the over the silliest things you you know I'm not going to explain anything but even just the silly things silliest things we tend to be ourselves up on you know well never mind I'm not going to go but you get what I'm saying is uh so man I get into that is I can't pray for anybody I can't pray for so and so you know I thought this I thought that well it's not that because if there's repentance that comes and and follows right after then there's no nothing held to your charge it's under the blood so how's it going to hinder somebody if it's under the blood now are we going to uh go out and sin just so we can Lord forgive me for this and then go out and do it again and Lord forgive me for this you know every hour upon the hour no because our heart is wrong even though the Lord would forgive us but if that's our motive to go out and do something well the Lord will forgive me when I whenever I go repent your heart is wrong your heart is wrong because it should be Grievous unto us that we shouldn't go unto under the things that we know are evil right because we want to cling to things that are good so uh we have we have laws that are made in the judicial system that's supposed to be enforced by law enforcement right so again some uh a lot of these law enforcement officers are out there you'll see them speeding by but man if you go five miles over the speed limit boy that pull you over you see what I mean you see you see where it comes so and and I can't help it but think of uh I I think it's Samuel's Samuel's two sons that were priests and they were living ungodly right so uh hni and finaz I think that's his son's name but they were living in sin but Eli wouldn't rebuke it even even when he was told to do so he didn't do it excuse me Eli uh Samuel's Sons didn't didn't live uh uh very righteous either but Eli is who I was talking about and uh he didn't rebuke his sons even when Samuel told told him look you better get this stuff right but he still didn't pay attention to it it was somebody looking after his soul amen so so even laws in the judicial system that's supposed to be enforced by law enforcement so we have that so we have that in this country we have that in they have that in other countries so when we get this mindset why I I can't I I've heard it from people that are left church I I've heard it from people that have left God allog together well it's just too many rules too many dos and don'ts you know children that want to leave homes because there there are too many rules I can't do this I can't do that I can't do what I want because it's a selfish motive it's a selfish motive not Discerning you know uh when we lay rules out as a parent We Lay rules out for the protection of our children youall might not understand that but you'll understand by and by when you have children you you'll understand so sister Naomi sister beus we make these rules and uh other parents we make these rules for the protection of our children you might think that it's unjust you might think that it's not fair that you can't go out with your friends that are out and and drinking and carrying on and doing everything else uh Under the Sun that they shouldn't be doing and you think it's unfair my parents should let me go wherever I want to go well they're looking out for your well-being because they don't want you to get caught up into something like that amen they they want it so they want you to be so far from that that because they know the path that it leads to and that path leads to destruction self-destruction family destruction relationship destruction friendship destruction uh you name it employee employer destruction that's what it just leads to so you might think that whoever's listening you might think that your parents are unfair because they make rules just remember they're looking out for your soul see and and a lot of times we think it's unfair you know and and and I'm saying this because I've heard people say well I want to cut my hair I can't follow that because you all believe that uh that you shouldn't cut your hair well at least come to church even if you think that you shouldn't cut your hair because who's criticizing you might hear it come across a pull pit or something you know but still you're hearing the truth but that just shows what's in their heart well I don't want to follow I don't want to follow what it says in the word you know dress modesty well I want to I want want to wear something a little bit more revealing I I kind of like that because I get more attention that's not the kind of attention that a sister should be getting but they should be getting attention from a from a respectful young man with respectful desires and treating you well I got your dad's back by the way that's a lot of back to carry you got a lot of sisters and you got a brother I'll be I'll be behind my I'll be next to the line I'll be there to help you out no but we want to take care of our daughters especially right so uh you mean Sons aren't worth much yes you are but but but there's a little bit more to a daughter that that people just don't realize there's there's more uh how do I want to put it there's more innocency at stake there's more more at stake for a woman for a young lady okay so uh yes we still care about you young men men we still care deeply about you young men because you you that's who's going to be protecting the the sisters right so in in the discernment of what is good and evil Discerning so Isaac is eight years old he's my he's my youngest and I am not going to let him drive me to Texas just because of he thinks he's able to drive he's a he can't drive he could he can't even drive a lawn mother much less my vehicle to Texas right so let let's you might say that that sounds childish but that's the discernment of the capability of the vessel okay the maturity level of the vessel so we ought to be our our senses ought to be exercised in discernment to where we could discern good and evil if we just let down the bars then we have no more discernment we just do whatever we want and no wonder people are muddled up uh not knowing what is good and what is evil because it all comes together and they can't they can't separate it because they've just let down the bars and they let anything happen and they indulge in anything so uh Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 11 just bear with me for a little bit longer I don't I don't plan on being that much longer I don't know if anybody knows brother Kenny CS had asked at byc being brother Jeremy Lord y probably don't know any me uh what does it mean when a when a message preacher says I'm closing absolutely nothing Well close when the spirit says close right so Hebrews chapter 5 some people just say it just to get the people awake because as soon as you say I'm closing they per up yeah so verse 11 it says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing y'all seeing ye are dull of hearing for when for the time you ought to be teachers you need that one teach you again which be the first principles the very basics of the oracles or the utterances of God and nor become such as have need milk and not of strong WR meat see a newborn baby can't eat meat obviously because it can't chew it up because it's not mature to eat that kind of food but a new believer a new convert needs to eat or needs to drink on the Milk of the word the easy things right not so much the hard things but uh why is it that when a a potential convert comes and and and we just want to ram all the Mysteries down and W how about if we get them to Christ first and and and let them have their experiences because they're going to have they need to have Falls to learn how to get back up you know so start it's like a newborn babe that you're teaching a little toddler how to walk you know they're going to stumble they're going to fall so we can't criticize a new believer just because they've stumbled and fell because that's all they know they don't know it yet so we got to we got to have a a a certain level of Grace right uh but as it comes as they go through the uring process you go you go from uh uh infant to uh toddler to adolescent to teen to adult it's a geriatric but there's a whole process of life right so uh we have to give the baby the newborn we have to give them milk and then as they grow you can give them the crackers you can give them the Skittles not not the not the Smith family you're not allowed to but you see what I mean you and then they can go on to things that are harder to uh digest harder to eat you know different things so uh verse 13 it says for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe because he just doesn't know any better yet see no wonder I think it's in Timothy uh if not that y'all are seeking a pastor but you a pastor should not be in place if they are a novice because they'll get headyy high minded they'll get puffed up and then they'll fall okay because they don't know how to handle things yet so uh verse 14 it says but strong meat belongeth to them that are of a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern now to to discern there means to to distinguish to judge both Good and Evil so see their uh strong meat belongeth to them that are of a full age now see their perception is mixed with experience to know and understand the difference of what is good and what is evil that's the one that's experienced the one that has become mature they they their perception or their uh discernment is mixed with experience they've been through something before so they know how to handle the situation they know uh they see a certain certain thing a certain individual behaving a certain way I know where this leads I've done seen this before we better take care of this right now right so I'm going to give some examples of definitions because it's it's used differently throughout the throughout the Scripture it it's pretty synonymous but you'd be surprised uh it it might be a little bit different from what you think so 2 Samuel 14 and verse1 17 it says says then thine handmaid said the word of my Lord the king shall now be comfortable for as an angel of God so is my Lord the king to discern good and bad therefore the Lord thy God will be with thee now see discern there means to hear or to listen or give attention to remember we were talking this morning about focusing on the right object so it's giving the right attention to okay so hearing and listening and giving attention to First Kings 3 and ver9 it says give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people see he didn't have a selfish motive that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this th so great a people he had a lot of people to go through for judgment so discernment there means Insight understanding or being observant First Kings uh chapter 20 verse 41 I say I like how Solomon ask for wisdom because you know the scripture says that if any man asks wisdom let him ask of God now see the Lord asked Solomon the one time says what is it that you would want me to give you he could have chosen great riches he could have he had lot of wise UNC concubines uh he could ask for more popularity than what he what he actually ended up receiving but would he could have had a selfish heart and just asked for something for him but he asked for wisdom and here as we read uh an understanding heart to judge the people he wanted to do right so he wanted to be a servant of righteousness right so uh First Kings chap 20: 41 it says and he hasted and took the ashes away from from his face and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets now discern there means to recognize acknowledge regard or respect see he recognized that there was a a a prophet amongst them how how would he be able to recognize that unless he had seen one before unless it had contact with a with one beforehand see that's that's where that that discernment mixed with with experience comes in there was a certain way that a prophet behaved and when he came in contact with with a a different prophet he recognized him as he would be one among the prophets see it's Discerning through the experience one more Ezekiel 44 and 23 is it okay to for 10 more minutes don't hold me to that but we'll try uh Ezekiel 44 and 23 it says and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean now see discern there means to teach the people to know the difference I'm trying to find that uh going to go back to where I think it was the thought it was the opening scripture that we had where brother was saying that which you see uh in me what you've heard in me that should you do yeah Philippians 4:9 it says those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and and seen in me do and the God of Peace uh shall be with you so teaching the people to know the difference Paul was saying you saw what I've done I've written unto you how to how to how to recognize these things or uh I've shown you how to conduct yourself and then anything outside of that you know that it's it's not going to be good you know for we're taught to preach what Paul T Paul preached right so that's what we want to do so whatever we've learned from that we want to carry on to teach somebody else right so the holy and profane well who's to say what's holy and what's profane well God established what was holy and profane and Paul and the teachers the apostles all those before us they taught the same thing of what God set aside as set aside as holy and what was profane and they moved right they moved to work toward that they worked in in one mind and one Accord yes they had a little hiccup when when Peter was trying to uh tell the tell uh the Gentiles to live as the Jews and then he was embarrassed when the Jews came because he was living as a gentile but then Paul rebuked him right because he ended up having uh Barnabas being caught in the same thing that he was teaching so not only did he did he hinder a couple a few other people but he hindered Barnabas so see that's where we need to be exercised in our discernment and rightly divide the word of God now see what happens is is uh we don't recognize the atmosphere or the influence of that atmosphere okay so a rotten atmosphere is like a poison now see some poisons work slow where others are fast some poisons are slow because it it it it's just like sin when it comes in in its infancy it seems so hard harmless but once it grows once it matures you'll get to see what it is because that's a law of a law of a seed right you got if you don't know what kind of a seed it is you plant it and then you got to wait for it to grow up and mature and then you can see what it is right so uh you you can come I'm going to turn to 1 Corinthians chap 11 verse 29 when I said one more for Ezekiel that was the examples of of discernment I didn't say one more one more scripture 1 Corinthians 11:29 it says for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily this is this is a communion uh scripture here right so for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and we we understand we believe that it is not a literal body it is not literal blood but is a it is a sign it is a h a poor substitute I mean uh but that's what we do to commemorate the Lord's body for what he's done for us the sacrifice that he's made for us for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep because we don't discern the Lord's body or we don't have the right discernment we don't we don't rightly discern what is in our lives we don't take proper inventory of our lives because we get to that point well I'm okay I'll go ahead and and partake of communion but then you're partaking unworthily because before you come to communion you should be cleaning up right I I believe brother Jesse would teach that here I I would hope that he would so before even come into communion service you got to make sure things are right see I I couldn't stand I I didn't like the way the communion service was before I gave my heart to the Lord you know because I I didn't want to do I didn't want to touch another man's foot you know and you know for the foot washing I I I couldn't do something like that but you know when I gave my heart to the Lord it was on a communion night and I watched another I watched another brother's feet something that I couldn't stand before I and now I can't I love communion service why because it makes me get in check it forces me to get right because I don't want to miss communion you can you can get into that place and say well I'm not going to take theun well I could get right but I kind of like where I am you and that's pretty dangerous because you're going to get so used to where you are that you don't want to come back oh my verse 31 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world oh my see judgment begins at the house of the Lord amen so when we take care of things in house how much easier it is and then we're not counted we're not judged with the world we're judged by according to the scripture right it says judge you not unless you be judged by by the same standard so that's what that's what we want to judge by right and then if we use that as our as our judgment not so much the rod but at least the the act of judgement we could discern learn what's a good behavior and what's not so good a behavior right so and then we could judge that and say hey I don't think we should be doing that you know as Christians as Believers we shouldn't we shouldn't be doing this we shouldn't be doing that it just doesn't seem right it doesn't feel right okay so uh when we partake in communion partake uh uh in sincerity and not hypocrisy so I I think I preached something it might have been years ago but y'all know the word sincere sincere means without wax it's from the word sincere I don't it's kind of like a dictionary what is such and such well it means to do such I don't many dictionaries don't get along very well sometimes like if you look up propitiation it's uh to propitiate well that helped out a lot thanks you know that was a good one that's where we don't get along but when we partake communion we come with a sincerity and sincere the the the root word pretty much is to be without wax and what they would do back in the old olden days with clay pottery and and and and jars bowls whatever it is if they had a crack they would fill it with wax just so they could sell it when it should be thrown away because it's no good but then they sell it off as a as a good piece of pottery good good piece of it's not a what is that I think of the dishes my wife just had to have some uh don't tell her it's the kind that it could fall and it doesn't break it's not corn something El I can't remember what it is but anyways I don't want to be hung up on that but coming in coming to communion partaking in communion without hypocrisy being true to yourself amen and being true to the Lord so uh you can stand your feet yeah I see the prodical son when when he when he told his dad that he uh wanted all his all his inheritance you know the the father said okay I'll give you all that he didn't he didn't really put up a fuss he didn't put up an argument but we know the story of the prod Goan is he he took all the in inheritance and then he he went and spent it on frivolous uh living you know things that that didn't really matter too much on uh on on uh food that he would be eating and drinking and then he just he just lived the life of of uh you know with no control I guess you could say and he just spent all his money on things that didn't matter see he didn't discern the the atmosphere that he was in he didn't discern his condition it wasn't until he got to his lowest of low and then he realized wait a second that even the servants at my father's house eat better than what I'm eating because he was eating pig slop so when he went home after he was able to discern the situation and that he was able to reconcile his situation as he went home his brother didn't discern the situation because the father said hey let's go kill the let's kill the fatted calf and then jealousy ensued Envy became part of the program there so the older brother didn't discern what the father saw because the father saw that he received his son back that his son was saved alive but the brother didn't see it that way all he saw was father's killing the fatted calf well you never killed the fatted calf for me and I've done everything that's right but rejoice in that the one of the 99 would be returned amen I I could say more but I'll just going to stop there but kind of the point is is uh it's not recognizing the atmosphere the influence of that atmosphere and it like I said it it acts like a poison uh arsenic was uh one example used uh many times uh years ago decades ago maybe century and centuries ago uh because it was easily accessible and it it could go undetected because it would act like flu like symptoms when the person took it and it didn't take much so uh women used it a lot for to the their husbands and that's how a lot of husbands died you know I don't know the situations maybe it was an abusive relationship or something I don't know but usually there's a selfish motive motive behind it but but just just to know that uh it it was it it was something easy and it worked fairly fairly slow at first it it depended on the amount but if you gave somebody a little bit here and there you know it it kind of it killed the person slowly so like I said the same thing with sin when we allow sin and we know the wages of sin is death so if you let a little bit in here a little bit in there and it just builds up into a whole big mature thing and then how are you going to get away from it because then you're going to speak evil against God because you don't want anything to do with church or God anymore so we must be careful the type of atmosphere that we have so uh I just saw this interview of this woman uh you know talking about Grace until it becomes disgrace you know we don't want to do that we don't we don't want to go do something to come and repent do something uh iniquity and then come to repent we don't want to we don't want to make Grace under disgrace right but I I saw an interview of the woman saying that uh and this this is not a a shot at at women by any mean but it's saying that uh uh the interview uh the woman was saying that women are a big contributor to the problem in society because uh women are generally more EAS easier on the children than what the men are that oh oh just we just got to love Johnny don't be too hard on them you you you know you know how it goes don't be too hard on them just uh we got to love them that's absolutely right we do have to love them we have to give Grace yep we have to give Grace but it's a father's tough love you know and some well uh the obviously the mother loves them more because they give Grace well if you think that a man doesn't love their children get in the way one time I wouldn't want to get in the way of an angry father especially if somebody's trying to hurt that child you know you just you you'll be able to see how much a a dad actually loves that child and and a mother too I'm not saying one is greater than the other but A Parent's Love for a child if you're hurting somebody's child you better watch out amen so because why because you love that child that's a part of you right oh I'll go ahead and close there Let's uh let's bow our heads for prayer heavenly father just thank you for the time that we've had here oh God and I pray that anything that was said I pray that uh that nothing would be empty but Lord I pray that it would be uh said in the way that uh somebody could really use it that uh it could help somebody's uh walk that they could walk more sincere in their lives that they could walk more true that they would have the desire to be a servant unto righteousness and not unto unrighteousness Lord our desire here would be that uh we would be vessels of Honor Lord be a far from us that we would be uh a vessel Of Dishonor Lord we don't uh be in our hearts that that wouldn't even be in our minds a desire to be un unclean vessel but Lord help that that desire to be stronger than ever before that we could uh that we would want to be a a vessel of Honor for you that we would be a vessel of cleanliness and righteousness help us that we would be a servant unto you and our fellow man our brothers and sisters Lord I just uh pray that when certain desires come into our lives that uh we would be able to discern whether it's a good desire or whether it's not a good desire and that we would be able to handle it through prayer through Godly counsel whatever it might be Lord I just think of uh the many times uh that people would ask a a question uh should I do this or shouldn't I do that Lord if the question stands and and and it goes so long unanswered then help us to stay away from that thing because if there's a question that if there's a doubt about it we should stay away from it so Lord I just pray that you would help us especially in this day there's so much there's so much uh there's there's so many scams out there Lord there's so many things that would try to deceive people uh there's so much deception out there Lord help us to discern between what is good and what is right father we just pray that you would strengthen this this church this body these members that they would get closer to one another uh Lord in a in a Godly atmosphere that I just see them uh how they fellowship and Lord It's a wonderful thing uh that they they Fellowship well with one another and it it's lord it's almost an Envy of other churches of how close this church could be but Lord may they not be boasting in that may they not uh uh boast in in that demeanor but Lord I just pray that you would uh show them of of what a wonderful thing they have here and to and to hold it dear to their hearts and and uh Lord It's just wonderful to be able to come here just a a wonderful spirit and I just pray that you would continue continue to bless this body that they would stay true to you that they would stand strong I just pray that you would be with brother Austin as he said that he has a headache this evening Lord I just pray that you would go and move upon him that you would touch him and remove that headache Lord you see the other situations in his life father I pray that you would give him clear-cut decisions and which way he should go Lord just uh different things that he's probably feeling I don't know but I just feel it in my heart and in my mind for some reason Lord he's he's got things in question and I just pray that you would uh just have a definitive answer for him Lord I just pray that you would show him in the the direction that he should go father I pray that you would be with brother J uh Jesse as he continues to uh pastor this church and be with him that he would uh live a whole a holy and clean life before you and before his family I just appreciate our brother and uh just pray that you would keep this church going Lord not so much in numbers but Lord in just the quality that you have here just love you appreciate you as we depart from here from one another just pray that you would give each one of us safety and uh that we would uh make it home to our loved ones father we we just want to ask all this in the Blessed name of our Lord Jesus Christ we love you we appreciate you and we invite you every day in our hearts and in our minds that when we're renewed in our minds that you would be there to help us through the day we ask it all in your blessed name our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the Lord
