========================================

brother austin and i were trying to hook up today for a bible study but we weren't able to get it because zion was really sick and everything so i thought tonight i'll just preach on his he had a question about the battle of the mind so i i just thought well i'll preach that tonight and hopefully they'll get here if not we got it saved and then you can listen to it tomorrow or whoever gets a chance so it's going to be a little bit of review for some of us but i know i got a lot of young children here and i know they don't uh understand everything right away so they need a few repetitions right to understand things so uh we'll look at that here tonight second corinthians chapter 10 verse three second corinthians 10 verse three just revisiting the battle of the mind i just want to revisit this here tonight get it on uh tape here for brother austin and there's a sub topic with complexes but austin a question about complexes so i'm hoping by god's grace we can minister uh in this area here tonight second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3. so i appreciate everybody's patience thanks for all your prayers and support for austin and lena and all the saints you know i emailed that gentleman who was very kind with his love offering this week and emailed me right back and he just said i'm in tears reading about the testimony and uh he said praise jehovah he said jesus is the author of all of it he said god gave me a word of knowledge he said to help those two in the congregation so he's just watching our youtube videos our sermons and he said i just the lord told me to send a certain amount of money to help out that couple he said i didn't know why he said but i just had a word of knowledge knowledge is understanding so i just understood to send them this certain amount of money and uh he said brother jesse he said please just be patient with them he said i remember when i we're not real we'd say dogmatic people you know we're not impatient people how many have the patience of the holy spirit i remember when i got the patience of the holy spirit it's a great anointing praise god before i couldn't be patient with god or i couldn't be patient with my family or could be patient with others but i remember the anointing of god coming upon me and then you realize oh i can be patient i can wait a little longer if i waited this long i can wait a little longer brother graham's example of that was noah if he could wait 120 years how many can wait a couple more weeks or months praise god you can wait a couple years as well so thank god for his anointing and he gives us that ability by the holy spirit so second corinthians 10 verse 3. i'll read verses three and four and then we can all read verse five together why don't we do that i'll read three and four we can all read verse five here tonight for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds so see god's weapons only work when we're using them according to his word in other words his word is only affected when we're letting the holy spirit anoint that word where we obey it and we live it again through the pulling down of strongholds or fortresses verse five let's read that together can we one two three casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ praise god let's have one more word of prayer if you have any on your heart just make another unto god let's pray for austin and lena as they're hopefully on their way you have to forgive me i got a little bit of runny nose and things so just bear with me here let's pray together heavenly father again thank you lord god you're tremendous lord god you're an awesome god lord we sing all these songs our god reigns hallelujah we thank you god hallelujah for your mercy and your grace we love to worship you we love to sing to you thank you lord we can hear the voices of these children the voice of the adults praising your name lord god the hands raised the lord the faces smiling with joyful lord over the things that our god has done and lord if our god is for us then no one can be against us it doesn't matter if the devil's against us or 12 legions of devils or whatever would be lord god hallelujah we have 12 legions of angels and we have the holy ghost with us as long as you're for us we thank you god for your mercy and grace for saying that you were for us lord god take this night god and use it lord god use me as a vessel now lord god for thy divine purpose and we just pray for safe traveling mercies for those still on their way lord god may you be glorified and god may you be magnified and we'll give you all the thanks and praise in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you for being seated praise god well you can switch over i'm just gonna have a few uh visuals you know hopefully aus and lena get here and if not well and children get another good lesson and you know there's times in life you just gotta get reviews you know you just gotta hear that again i mean who doesn't benefit from hearing brother brandon preach another sermon now you already heard it but don't you catch something new each time you know that's that's a well-known uh uh that's a well-known word of wisdom that you listen to it again you catch something new in it praise god so hopefully uh this will be a help here tonight by god's grace you know i was thinking about brother austin's question about complexes and i remember i preached a message back in 2014 uh and we had had some issues in our home church you know different disagreements you know with uh some families and things and um i looked you know i was looking i was talking with his brother and as i was counseling with his brother in the church uh i started realizing he's got a complex and then when i saw his complex god is my witness then i saw mine and i i didn't even realize it so i was looking at my notes you know from these uh eight years ago right and uh i remember that this idea of complex is that awesome was asking about i was wow this at one time this was a major message i remember preaching this at cam's church brother brooks's church brother jim schumacher's church and some of these thoughts and this message were so powerful i remember praying with brothers just preachers weeping at the altar over uh complexes and i don't know if anybody's gonna come up here tonight like that but i don't always expect that it's it's all god's time and season praise god god works in a season there's times i thought my god's gonna move mightily with this sermon then nobody you know it seemed like nobody moved and that's okay it's god's you know it's god's time there's other times i thought well i don't know how this is gonna work out and then god moves mightily you know and helps people uh brings them to repentance or gives them a healing or a victory or something uh so we never know exactly uh what's going to happen but we know god is in control of what happens and and we can't live our lives wondering you know uh worrying about the future we have to just choose the word of god obey the word of god and god will take care of the results amen so i'm trusting in that here and again i saw this brother had a complex and then i started looking at my life and that's when i told you this before but i had complexes to at least four preachers and maybe might have been more and so every time i would hear that preacher's name and these were my friends these were some of my friends every time i'd hear that preacher's name i'd get jealous or i'd get upset with that brother or i'd have to stop my tongue from saying something bad about that brother and i was a young preacher i was probably my 25 26 27 i was a pretty young preacher that's why the bible says you don't make a a young pr a new convert a preacher right away right you know you wouldn't want to make a novice a preacher uh and so you know i've been preaching at that time probably for you know if this was 2014 i'd probably been preaching for well maybe nine or ten years then by yeah ten years probably ten years by that time and i developed all these complexes and and so i remember one by one i either emailed or texted or called the brothers and i confessed my complex to them and they forgave me of course and now we're in you know good fellowship and and i've learned that you know i can uh it's okay to uh it's okay to have questions about people's lives you know it's okay but it's not okay to speak evil about them or think evil about them for example remember paul went to the galatian church and he said do i have to labor do i have to travail again for you to get a new birth he said i stand and doubt of you so because they they were they started in christ but then they brought legalism back into it in other words paul looked at their lives and said do i need to labor with you gentlemen here to get the holy ghost again what happened here you can't get the holy ghost twice in the soul you can only get it once and so there was there was this idea of where as a believer sometimes you have questions about other believers uh but you also want to always say positive things about them you know you always want to say positive things and i've learned that over the years and uh at least in two different situations now with the original brother when in 2014 when i preached this with a brother and sister actually um when i preached this it actually brought the brother up to the altar weeping and crying and i remember he told me afterwards he said i saw the last we were in the message at that point for 12 years he said i remember he said this i saw the last 12 years of my life flashed before my eyes of all the different times i'd heard him or a couple times he misunderstood me i didn't really hurt him but we spent the next month or so meeting every sunday after church he and his wife you know and talking and going through all and emailing back and forth it was a can i say like this it's a very draining process but was it worth it absolutely absolutely so all these questions over the years and i remember uh they'd bring up things from like the very beginning of the church or you know i'd be like well i don't remember that and if i couldn't remember i just say okay if that's how you said it i'm sorry i i i wouldn't think i would ever do that but if i did you forgive me right and then of course i expected them to forgive me as well uh sorry yeah as well and then i would tell them here's the times you hurt me and you don't you know what church each time they said i remember doing that look we can get anointed of the devil and do things and not even know we're doing it not in the soul and not possessed by the devil but by an evil thought so in both cases i remember on both sides both of us were like i don't remember doing that now a couple times i can remember doing it and that's why i said yes that's right i was a little discouraged that day or i was a little bit angry with you i'm sorry about that but uh that's where this sermon actually came out of and then i saw god use it to help you know numerous churches and then you know of course as you study yeah remember brother bran talked about a complex and he said how many here in brenham tabernacle have a complex he said my look almost every hands up now there's two thoughts on that it's like wow either uh these people are not getting they're not really working out their complexes or brother ram asked you know and they should have they should have taken care of the complex how we know we shouldn't we shouldn't live with the complex right right we shouldn't live with it so either they were being disobedient and uh hadn't confessed it or the other idea is they just recently got a complex right and they they now were real now they were receiving the present word of god and they're being instructed it's now time to take care of that by the grace of god so see either one uh could have uh been a real source here of the trouble it could have been well i should have dealt with this years ago and uh or or this is something new and i got to take care of this but either way church we got to take care of the complexes we've got to take care of the the hard feelings we're going to take care of those things now now what was interesting is you know uh like with the brother both of us had different kind of personalities i'm like a happy-go-lucky kind of person normally you know so if somebody offends me sometimes i'll just let it go i forget about it but yet it stays there right the fact that somebody hurt me it stays there and i don't i don't act as loving to the person right but the other guy was he's like uh kind of different he wasn't like happy-go-lucky he's just a quiet person but over the course of the years because he kept those complexes in he got even more quiet even more cold even more emotionless well you still see me emotionally smile happy how you doing brother god bless you but the other brother didn't have that same type of personality so we came to knew over time something's wrong right and that's why i preached it because i've seen all these scriptures and i heard all these quotes coming together brought together and preached it and then i saw it set the captive free and that's what christ came to do now we weren't captive in physical chains right but we're kept sometimes in spiritual chains like we sing that song on sunday uh i'm no stranger to remember oh yeah brother ben saying it all my hope is in jesus that song says i'm no stranger to a prison i've known shackles and chains now only a few people we know could even sing that as far as natural right people that have been in prison but if you've ever been a slave to sin or you've been a sinner which every hand should go up at that point right then you know what it's like to be a prisoner because you're a constant addict or a sin addict and you just don't get over it right but it's a beautiful song but jesus comes along and he shows you you don't have to be in those chains anymore he pays your debt and he's your judge he's your lawyer he's your advocate and he calls you forgiven and he forgives you as though you never did it in the first place praise god he gives you his righteousness but you know you did do it in the first place right you know your human mind chose to do that or your flesh you gave into your flesh you chose to do that now but then you realize my soul never did it the anointing of god the the gene seed of god that represents me the gene seed never did it but my flesh did it and i'm not going to choose uh to live from my mind and rem and i'm not going to choose to condemn myself from my my past i'm going to choose to walk free because i have a gene seed of god and i come from the mind of god amen i'm not going to choose to remember my earthly background i'm going to choose to remember my heavenly background hallelujah praise god and so we live in uh we live in a a time where things are complex how many know brother adam said we live in a complex age so listen church we battle complexes constantly yet we live in a complex age or a difficult age a very intricate age now church where we gotta we gotta watch our every step every day we have to take uh we have to uh take account of our lives every single day you gotta really consider what did i watch and listen to today what did i say today you have to take that consideration because it's influencing whether or not you're winning the battle of your mind this is a complex age i wrote down numerous things here that tell you it's complex but random said remember we have three pressures riches soft living and nervousness you and i in our minds are battling those three things other words your human mind is saying get rich you need to get rich you need more money you need more money right it's a constant pressure the other pressure is your life is too hard you need to ease your life make your life easier make your life easier right and are all these things true no they're not true and the third thing is there's pressure there's pressure there's pressure you should be stressed about this you should worry about this you need to care more about this you need to worry about this and so it's a complex age where these three spirits are trying to constantly battle us and not only not only on top of that the bible says there's a lack of love jesus said the love of many shall wax cold so not only are these pressures trying to get on us we look at other people most people are cold right most people are living in iniquity and because of that their lives are cold so you look around you're having my battles you're just like i just want somebody to love me but there's very few people that are even you just wanted from somebody but the very few people that actually love people god bless you good to see you there's your guitar brother amen see it's another gift in the house of the lord so this is a complex age where we have constant battles on our mind and yet we're looking for love from other people but there's very few people to love us and then there's this is the age of the days of lot and sodom and noah all rolled into one so everywhere we look outside the church there's violence there's homosexuality there's uh there's pleasures of food uh remember the bible said eat drink and be merry right so that's all the world wants they want to eat drink and have a happy uh foolish life joking life they just want jokes all the time these are the pressures trying to squeeze their way into our minds paul said deceivers wax worse and worse so that means there's more deceivers trying to deceive you and get your mind off the things of god or make you think that you're thinking right about god when you're actually thinking the wrong thought about god or like god wants you to be rich or god wants you to have an easier life when god may be saying well i need to take them through some trials so they can obey me better right but these are all complex things and bro that's what we're looking at tonight we're going to kind of do a bible study what we would have done yesterday okay we look at uh we're revisiting the battle of the mind okay so we have the greatest deception there ever was at this time plus we have the days of noah violence eating drinking jokes we have the homosexuality the days of sodom and gomorrah rampant homosexuality sexual sin we have very few people that even love us or love god right and then we have all these pressures trying to get into us god have mercy our only hope is jesus christ amen in this complex age and with all of our complexes in our minds our only hope is a savior who will set us free from our complexes amen because our soul our soul if it's filled with the holy ghost that's wonderful but we're still got to live up here in the mind we're still going to make active decisions in our mind and we still got a body to deal with it wants things right it wants food it wants uh lust of the eyes lust of the flesh it wants things and the mind the mob of the bible said the desires of the mind the mind has desires too it wants to imagine things of the world wants to do all these things so it's a very difficult age to live in but god would never send a soldier into a battle unless he fully prepared him with the right weapons and defenses and protection praise god and god sent us into this last age in satan's eden praise god with a sharp sword of his word that can defeat any enemy any time any place anywhere and you've got your hand on it you just got to grab it and you just got to use it amen hallelujah now let's review here so you have these three parts to you the bible says god is trying to sanctify all of you so god's kind of trying to keep your body sanctified so you don't give in to the desires of the flesh the flesh wants to smoke like i used to or drink you got to stop that you got to be a sanctified body right or sexual sin also you got to sanctify your mind your mind has to be sanctified and cleaned out and set apart in other words you can't think constantly about evil things your mind has to be dedicated to god amen god has to be your first thought god has to be your next thought god has to be your every thought praise god and then your soul needs to be filled with the life of god so that when you when you're in your the hardest battles and all and everything else seems like it's going crazy you can you can be still and know that god is in you amen and you can listen for the voice of the holy spirit praise god that's right church that's right now let's review real quick now don't notice the body's not on here right now i'm just looking at the mind and the spirit okay now what happens with the complex is satan injects an evil thought in there and then he builds up a fortress to fight against something that's good for example like with that brother and i um i was talking about earlier i think there was one complex he had against me because we were having a minister's meeting one time and i think it was i wouldn't share my notes with him and i admit i was wrong i should have but part of me my human thought was like well why don't he just study it himself do i have to do all the studying for that other brother the bible says study yourself approved to see how i had a mind battle and so i let that build up so every time that brother asked me for quotes i was like the enemy would shoot out and well the enemy actually shot out and said no i'm not going to give you this one you study it out and so he felt he was a younger minister than me i've been preaching longer so he felt that i was fighting against him and so we had to talk about that and i'd apologize now there is a thing there is a truth to that you have to study yourself approved right but at that moment i should i should have just shared it but that whole time before we talked about it i always had this hurtful feeling toward him and uh it wasn't right it's a complex the enemy built up a fortress against that brother in my mind so i didn't want to get an email from him i didn't want to get a text from him because i had a complex against him okay does that make sense the bible said don't give place to the devil where in your mind anybody whether you're holy ghost filled or not anybody can give satan a place in your mind so our battle is to not give satan any place in our body mind or soul praise god hallelujah now and then we learn brother austin and lena that you have five parts to your mind your mind works in five ways in other words you have an imagination right we can imagine what it's gonna be like when the weather is warmer again hallelujah how does william feel right now over there in ghana you have affection which is your emotions right that's part of your human spirit like when we were crying last week because you got the victory buddy it just overwhelmed our affections like our affections wasn't set on money it was on the fact that jesus christ loves you right and that overwhelmed us so we start crying and praising the lord and worshiping god and pounding on the pulpit and everything like that you just you get happy amen then you have reasoning right and reasoning is your reasons for decisions well i'm gonna do this because of that i think i'm gonna i think i'm gonna uh do this i think i'll go there so i can buy that get that and i'll go back i think i'll like remember like brother man said the reasoning is well remember from james i'm going to go move there and make so much money right but the bible said don't say that don't plan on making the money say if the lord willing i'll make the money but reasoning as well it's kind of like a lot well i'll move to sodom and gomorrah because i have a easier life there there's water there there's big business there but that was the wrong reasoning he should have said where can my family serve god better amen hallelujah my family can serve better hanging around abraham god's prophet amen hallelujah i don't want my family hanging around homosexuals in other words i want my family hanging around godly people like abraham and sarah and there are 300 servants praise god i want my family around saints because whoever you hang around with that's who you're going to turn into memory is one we can all remember we've where we've been hurt in the past how many remember being hurt in the past ever we've got a choice we can either let that memory stay there and i said i'm going to be against my dad or i'm going to be against my mom because my dad left my mom i'm going to be against my dad and every time i hear his name i don't want to see him i don't want to talk to him right i got a choice i can either build up a complex or i can forgive him and say father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing right and then the other the last part is the conscience and that's called the stoplight it's called the stoplight of your mind right so when you want to go let's say you want to let's say you want to skip church right and the devil's saying hey go and skip church but there's a red light saying no turn around go to church my conscience tells me i need to but you fly through the red light anyway when you could have done a u-turn and gone right back to church right that's a conscience well i know that's right so i should do it it's a light there to tell you stop go back or go this is the will of god right it's that stoplight that tells you what to do okay now i'm gonna stay back on this i'm just gonna use this now give me uh let's see let me take a half hour here i'll just try to hit the highlights on these scriptures um if you would get your bibles here let's have some readers here uh let's start with my oldest can you hon okay proverbs 23 he said remember return there proverbs 23 7. then we'll just hit some uh scriptures here i'll just try to keep it brief and then but austin we can talk more about it and it's a great topic brother uh it's a great topic i preached numerous times on the complexes and you know the mind we we just went over that before you guys got here in december and november we went over the mind again with all the children remember you guys come up with all those good examples i know maokai was shooting out all these good examples and all the girls you know you're doing a great job giving me examples of saints with mind battles did a great job proverbs 23 7. liddy when you got it can you read it all right so the bible says as a man thinks in his heart so is he okay so whatever you meditate on on think and think on that's what you are right so the the best example is i'm weak or i'm discouraged and the church said like all day you're thinking i'm so discouraged i'm such a weak christian i'm such a failure who told you that was that god that said that god doesn't call you a weak a wimp god calls you more than a conqueror i mean if you think you're weak if you think you're nothing if you think you're useless that's how you're going to act as a man or woman thinks in his or her heart so is he or she wherever you think you are that's what you are i'm jesse i'm loving the lord that's who i am amen that's my idea that's what john said i'm john i'm the disciple of jesus loved amen that's who i am that's your identity you're the one who god emptied out heaven for amen i shouldn't say empty not but he sent his son praise god he sent his son from heaven he created a body of jesus he sent his son filled his son with his holy spirit and then had his son's sacrifice for you praise god he thought so much of you he gave you a lamb to die for you praise god nobody else has done that for you satan's trying to kill you and destroy you but god's trying to save you empower you and exalt you to heaven praise god amen glory you are the purchase price of jesus's blood in other words jesus blood was worth whatever it paid for what it paid for your love your soul praise god hallelujah you are the purchase of jesus's blood hallelujah so your value is above measure amen your values above rubies amen like i said about the woman amen a proverbs 31 woman she's more valuable than far above rubies praise god she's worth millions and billions of dollars any real man who's married to a godly woman knows the value of a godly wife she's she's her value is in in immeasurable incalculable praise god because of all that she does over humility and the bible says that god for me my mother's womb and this is let's look look at your hands for a minute this is a pretty good job god did a pretty good job on your body praise god all of you walked in here nobody was packed in here on a wheelchair right god did a really good job and he said you're fearfully and wonderfully made praise god those are god's thoughts and god's thoughts are the best thoughts amen god thought so much of you he sent his son to die for you and he allowed the word of god somehow to reach its way into akron at a burger king to come to you praise god or he sent brother branham like your dad told me all the way to ghana just to be at the airport and brother and prayed made the message go forth in ghana and then god sent that message all the way down to your hometown sister amen god thought so much of you amen this is god's thoughts and the bible says god's thoughts are the greatest thoughts god's thoughts are the highest thoughts there's no thoughts higher than god's thoughts hallelujah no thoughts greater than god's thoughts now let's move on here as a man thinks so is he so you have to think all day about god now i know there's times you got to take a break when you're working but let's say this lord i'm having trouble on the job lord help me to solve this problem on the job that's what you need to do lord i got a problem i got a little situation lord give me your thoughts for this situation don't tune god out and say well now it's time to work no bring god and say god come on in i'm inviting you into my work i'm inviting you into my school work i do that many times selena she's getting ready to go to college i do that many times i had a lot of all-nighters well not all all-nighters but i had a lot of late-nighters writing 30-page papers instead of tests when i became a master's degree i had to do papers and i was writing all the time i say lord i have no words for this computer but somehow they always came because i say god help me we don't shut out god said well god you can't help me no god wants to help you praise god keep thinking about god say god you can help me write this paper i always pray like this lord you can help me remember everything that i learned and studied i forgot it all but you can bring it back to me and don't you know god did that amen he always does that praise god because he's faithful as a man thinks in his heart so is he now i want to just look at here let's look at a few uh so what happens with a complex uh brother austin will you read proverbs 18 14. everybody can turn there proverbs 18 14. what happens when a complex occurs how does it start it usually starts like this it usually starts through affection go to brother austin when you're ready uh uh proverbs 18 14. the spirit of a man will sustain in his firm infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear it very good so what happens you get wounded somebody said this austin somebody hurt your feelings or somebody did something last week and then the next day you remember oh they said that about me they put that on youtube about me i get it every time i get it a lot every time i oh there's another one i was in that one oh well praise god point out all my heirs and all my differences you know that's okay i still love those guys hallelujah if you're watching now spies i love you i'm praying for you hope you get saved by god's grace come talk to me come talk to me personally if you have something against me please don't go share with somebody else you come talk to me that's what jesus said did he not that's what jesus said somebody offends you go talk to them themselves but see you get wounded so somehow your feelings get hurt and then if you don't if you don't let god heal that it's going to keep hurting i'll never forget that i felt really bad as a dad one time genevieve got burned and i put a band-aid on it right away without yeah yeah listen we got some doctors in here and i forgot to put salve on it or whatever it was and that band-aid stood on there it was on there for like a week maybe two and it was so painful and that was another one of my dad fails just like that broken arm back there that's another dad fail but that was on accident i was just trying to help zion and uh genevieve i love you honey that was daddy's fault but yeah i need god's grace as a dad that's all i can say i really need god's grace i'm not perfect but that's a wound right it's a wound and if it's not taken care of properly it becomes a long-term problem a church that's a natural thing now what about spiritual what about always building up our children loving our children forgiving our children and saying the right things to our children if i had a choice now i'd rather make a mistake hurting the physical aspect of my child than the natural but do i ever desire to hurt anybody no but i'm a human and we have to go through mistakes we have to learn from our mistakes we have to suffer in order to learn mistakes i hope everybody understands me tonight here i never hurt anybody ever but if i had a choice i'd say lord let it be in the natural and not the spiritual because i want their spirits i don't want them to have wounded spirits i want them to when they see me to love me not to want to run away from me i don't want to be around dead i want them to run to me when i walk in the door i want to see jen run to me and zion like i want to get well too you know they used to run to me you know i want it i want their spirits to be strengthened with the holy spirit with god's love amen so what happens someone wounds us now we know it's the devil it's not the person it's the devil working on that person right then if we're not careful that memory will come up if we don't if we don't let that heal satan's going to take that wound and he's going to build up and well oh they did this but guess what remember last year they did that oh remember remember five years ago when they did that and pretty soon he has to build up this all these hard hard feelings you have such a case against this person to be angry with them but no you don't you have to remember the blood of jesus christ comes to forgive all their diseases right i'm sure all their iniquities all their sins the blood of jesus comes to offer forgiveness that's right go to hebrews 12 hebrews 12 14 maybe lena you could read this one hebrews 12 14 take your time it's the back of the bible back of the bible hebrews and james so it's towards the back hebrews 12 14 and 15. so the enemy comes in he tries to wound you but church i just pray the holy spirit when we have hurt feelings i just pray the holy spirit would come near to us and remind us it wasn't them it was the devil trying to hurt us and that we will say our prayer forgiveness father forgive them and now many times that will that will that will make everything okay but church there are some hurts that are so hurtful you have to go talk to the person or you're not going to feel you're not going to feel deliverance you're not going to feel victory until you go talk to the person face to face and then all that pressure goes away i know what i'm talking about with 15 years of pastor and 17 years of preaching there's been times i've hurt people's feelings or they've really just not really liked me but as soon as we talk about it i feel like a brand new person the weights off my shoulders i feel happy again because i'm not holding in this wound i'm letting the holy spirit heal it right i'm i'm setting the person free from hurting me right like jesus daily prayers father father uh forgive me of my debts as i forgive them who are indebted to me i don't think like austin owes me because he hurt me or malachi owes me because he hurt me i can i can let them be i can let i can let their debt be paid and jesus forgives them jesus loves him i can let go of that pain all right so sister lena could you read verses 14 and 15 please great thank you so now we get another picture so a complex can either be like a stronghold or it can be like a root or like a weed okay like a weed so this is either can be like a weed or a castle fortress satan's either trying to get a weed to grow up and what does a weed do it takes up precious space and precious minerals right that same ground could be used to bring forth fruit that same ground could be a blessing but instead it's a waste right we don't want to waste our lives we want our lives to be productive for the glory of god we don't want to waste our thoughts we want our thoughts to have a a benefit we want to see the fruits of good thoughts praise god and we see that through the words of our mouth praise god because our mouth reveals what's in our heart okay your mouth reveals what's in your heart let me let's go to the book of matthew jesus said that matthew i will get it in just a moment yeah matthew 12 34 yeah matthew 12 34 and malachi when you're ready you can read that matthew 12 34. in other words your mouth will always say what you're thinking about as a man as a woman thinks in their heart that's what they are they're currently weak if they're they're currently discouraged if they're saying i'm discouraged i'm discouraged then they're currently discouraged they're saying i'm condemned and god don't love me then they're currently condemned temporarily but not eternally amen praise god amen temporarily right because remember paul was to be blamed paul was to be condemned temporarily because he wouldn't eat with the gentiles but peter i'm sorry yeah peter was to be rebuked but paul corrected him and they both and peter got the victory by god's grace all right so uh mal i'm sorry malachi read matthew 12 34 please all right so that proves whatever comes out of your mouth that shows what you're thinking and the real secret to victory is rejecting the evil thoughts thinking the right thoughts and then making your mind and mouth say the right words praise god because every word starts as a thought right thought word action right i'm gonna go read my bible i'm gonna i'm gonna go pray well it starts as a thought then you speak it and then you do it praise god in church you have a 40 better chance of doing it if you write it down there's something about getting your something about prophesying with your words you are almost 50 percent more likely to do it if you write it down that's why i write down my goals for every day right but i don't write it down anymore but read my bible because i always do it it's a part of me i know my day hasn't got started unless i read my bible and i don't want the day to start unless i read my bible praise god amen you have to write it down speak it think it speak it act on it amen i'm gonna say i'm gonna get up at seven or i'm gonna get eight and i'm gonna read my bible right away you gotta speak it we'll see it's so important that you write it down speak it and then you'll act upon it praise god out of the abundance of your heart the mouth speaks praise god so speak whatever's in your heart if it's in your heart and it's god's will it's going to happen praise god so speak it anyway the devils won't stop it but god will bring his word to pass and you'll be the beneficiary of it thank god amen now go to ezekiel 36 here ezekiel 36 26 now i want to show the three works of grace here what the bible calls it the bible also calls it new heart is justification new spirit is sanctification and my spirit is the baptism of the holy ghost now we just had two recent baptisms that's why i'm going over this so thankful uh for them all celina obeying the word of god and being baptized in the name of the lord praise god that proves they have a new heart that proves they're forgiven god has forgiven them praise god because you get a new heart you go to be baptized the bible said wash away your sins praise god it washes away your sins now ezekiel 36 26 uh you got it haven are you just writing it down it's okay you got it no it's okay okay ezekiel 36 26 so before you're a christian you have a stony heart which means god cannot write his word upon your heart it's not it's not alive it's not it's not living it's a dead thing the word of god is dead to you unless you're saved if you're saved now the word of god becomes a flesh it becomes a part of you right your new life you love the word of god it's alive haven uh ezekiel 36 26. great go and read 27 too now here's the third step new heart new spirit third step amen great job haven i almost want to give you two claps but so there's three steps first god gives you a new heart you have now you have a feeling toward god you have a soft tender heart toward god it's not a stony heart where it's not alive to god it fights against god but now you have a heart of flesh and then so now that you guys are baptized now your goal is on a new spirit or a new mind so god is going to work through the word of god your prayers your bible reading he's going to give you a new spirit which is a new way to think so look at this time of your life as i'm getting washed my brain's getting washed i'm being brainwashed by the holy spirit okay because that's really what we all are the bible says we're washed by the washing waters of regeneration praise god that's what god's trying to do he's trying to wash away our evil thoughts wash away our evil memories glory amen he's trying to wash away all our evil hurtful feelings our evil imaginations and he's trying to clean it out so he can put his word in that mind amen and then it becomes the greatest weapon god ever had amen this is the greatest battle god ever we ever fought but also if we win the battle it can become the greatest source of a weaponry and victory that we can have is with a mind that's fully dedicated to the things of god i was thinking about that look look how god used my imagination to write those two books out there where do those two books come from do those books like look like brother branham's books no they come from the realm of the imagination right they weren't before they weren't here but god's spirit came in my mind and god's spirit led me to write those and now we have something from the imagination of my mind or when god gives you a new song can't wait till we get that it was it was out there somewhere in the mind of god before it wasn't here but if the holy spirit can anoint that the holy spirit you'll go out there by the spirit of god you'll catch the rhyming words or you'll catch the scripture and you'll put it down together like haven called a new song brother haven't just got a new song this week i'm trying to get her to play it now i said not tonight how about sunday i even gave her a little rhyme there about uh die what was to die in the sky right we're going to meet the lord in the sky and we never have to die right there's going to be a group of people that get to experience that see so her imagination was so unique to the holy spirit that just she climbed up there in heavenly places in christ jesus amen and caught the thoughts of god amen hallelujah now she could have used that to imagine well i'm going to get back at charis or i'm going to get back at daddy when daddy didn't let me have a fruit strip or something like that right she could have used that wow i'll make dad's life harder or something like that but instead she uses her imagination to catch the thought of god amen hallelujah see that's what god wants a mind that's yielded to him like how many testimonies have i got brother jesse your videos or your books have answered all these questions i always had but i never had the answers for it what was that praise god god put his word into my mind and i just shared what god put in there and it goes out there that meets the needs of the people it's a it's a life that's yielded it's a constant yielding to the holy spirit and god will magnify his gifts in our lives amen it's beautiful a mind that's yielded to the holy spirit right so that that's the goal of your life right now is that god wants to build a brand new way of thinking in your in your life in your mind he wants your conscience to be dedicated to the word always obey the word he wants your memory i'm just gonna i'm gonna forgive all my uh all the debtors and i'm not gonna remember those things so much and i'm gonna remember the word of god i remember when christ died for me amen i'm gonna remember the cross when jesus paid for my sins amen that i can forgive other people praise god holy day i remember when god took that financial blessing and god said i'm going to always remember that god will provide all my needs amen hallelujah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna develop the reasoning to do what's right i'm gonna remember i'm gonna bring up all the reasons to do what's right i'm gonna focus on the right reasons and i'm only going to feel emotion for the things of god i'm not going to long after uh the desires of the past like we talked about i'm not going to desire to be an nfl football player anymore i'm not going to desire to be a famous musician in the world anymore right i'm not going to desire that i'm going to set my affections my emotions on the things that matter and then imagination we've kind of talked about that i want to catch what does god have in store for my future what is god what new things can god bring that i've not never even thought about before and the church said god bless you let's keep going a little bit further here tonight is that okay all right got some amen praise the lord let's do that all right i think church uh let's see i think let's go to colossians 3 and i'll try to bring this down and then just a couple more scriptures colossians chapter 3 verse one so if you're getting the new testament chapter the four gospels and some other uh romans corinthians then you start getting into the epistles of paul pauline epistles they call them basins ephesians philippians colossians look for galatians ephesians philippians colossians colossians chapter 3. amen colossians 3 1. all right i'll read verse 1 if you or ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god you catch that paul says seek the things that are in heaven what things are in heaven answers to prayer right god's will heaven and we want to come down on earth seek god's will on everything not our will now here it is verse two is where you and i are absolutely commanded to set our what our affection set your your emotions your mind your mind on things above now this word in the greek means to direct your mind to strive for to side with god so direct your mind on things above how many know that you can point your mind in any direction it wants to go how many know that it's just like a steering wheel your mind is like a steering wheel right go wherever you want to go do you want to go right you want to go left you want to turn around where do you want to go do you want to go straight your mind is the steering wheel and jesus or paul through jesus or jesus through paul says set your affection or take the steering wheel towards the things of god in other words go directly go only to the word of god set it on there can i say it like this cruise control everyone ever know what curious control set your cruise control on god amen hallelujah amen they're just developing that now right in tesla cars you were telling me about that austin where you can take your hands off the steering book well i imagine one day i can't wait to do that harley i'm gonna take a little nap now saying to you he's gonna drive me all the way home when i get home zion's gonna wake me up he's gonna be a bigger boy then you know he's gonna be a couple years old hey daddy how you doing dad let's go play football let's go play catches now guy yeah set it on cruise amen set your affection set your emotions set your thoughts on god amen not on things of the earth for you're dead the earth is full of dead things amen dead sins right you're dead and your life is hidden with christ and god in other words you're dead to the world so don't think about the world anymore think about what heaven thinks about amen you're dead you'll nev glory you'll never go back to that old lifestyle amen you're dead to that and now your new lifestyle is only serving christ amen hallelujah set your cruise control on christ right it's got to move up you got to get it up to a certain degree where it's on christ ah now it's on christ hit cruise control so that's what you got to do in the morning you got to rev up your mind amen come on start thinking wake up stop feeling tired wake up and set it on christ get out your bible amen start praying praise god set your affection on things above and hit cruise control i'm going to spend the rest of the day serving god thinking about god meditating on the word of god oh it's the greatest blessing we've been ever given praise god is to set our minds on cruise control on the things of god church when you get on cruise control you can really you can really save on gas it's way more efficient praise god when you set your mind on on christ your life is way more efficient there's not all these stops there's not all these trials right because you're just cruising you're not going to make any stops you're not going to do anything abrupt you're just going to cruise through life praise god i'm not saying no trials but the trials aren't going to beset you the trials aren't going to stumble you you're going to be able to go through the trials well i could make i didn't think i could make it through but christ was with me all the time i just went right through it because my mind was on cruise control with christ amen hallelujah verse 4 when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory so look at verse five now brother austin can you read verse five brother mortified means to crucify brother so paul says set your mind on cruise control on christ and then he said crucify thee so go and read verse five concuptions thank you so paul tells us the whole victory right here set your mind on christ and then crucify concuptious means desires and lust of the flesh i just looked it up so evil desires you have to crucify that now brother austin is a crucifixion is it a a fast death or a slow death church did joshua drive out all the inhabitants fast or slow all you learned you learned great job you learned through all those 39 sermons great job church i'm so proud of you told joshua you will not drive them out in a day you'll not drive them out the year he said but you're gonna have to fight year after year amen you have to battle these things for years and but if you stay with me you'll drive up all the inhabitants and you'll be blessed and you'll have rest amen i don't know i'm not going to drive all the animals right away right i'm not going to drive out all the inhabitants you got to fight step after step day after day you got to learn how to serve god you got to learn to set your affection on things above you learn how to serve god you gotta learn how to crucify the lusts of the flesh fornication right sexual sin you gotta learn how to crucify sexual sin you gotta learn how to crucify uncleanness which is luxurious living right the desire for a luxurious living rich living you have to crucify that inordinate affection means uh a calamity a evil affliction a mishap sadness so sad feelings so now how many how many god how many gonna battle depression right we got a battle depression or grief we've got to crucify that it's not going to go away instantly now it could if there's a miracle but if you're going to battle right if it's a battle you have to crucify those feelings in other words say i'm not going to set my my my thinking on depression or or grief or or anger or malice i'm going to set my thinking on the joy of the lord on forgiveness i'm going to focus on forgiving people i'm going to focus on being positive knowing that god is with me god is for me and god's going to bring me through this trial amen hallelujah so how do i get the victory brother set your mind on god and crucify everything else that's how you do it does that make in sense words you got to crucify this you got to break this down now listen church anybody knows if you're going to break down a wall how does it happen it happens one brick at a time hallelujah you see we're in one accord one brick at a time unless you're samson if you're samson you just pick up the whole gate well commands but if you're not samson it's a slow crucifixion it's a just take down that wall get your sledgehammer out break down a few bricks there and break down it's a slow process it takes time kind of like shoving all that snow a few days ago i shoveled it so for three hours i felt about breaking down a wall right there it's about building up a wall see satan wounds us but we gotta ask god to for forgive the person or go to that person if somebody offends you jesus said let's go to matthew 18 15 matthew 18 15. if g if someone offends you you need to go to them that will get the guilt or the sin de off your mind matthew 18 verse 15. as our church knows you know i've just shared this often sometimes i have a hard time going to people because i just want to forgive them and love them but i i've learned over the years if that feeling stays i need to go talk to them then it was a really painful hurt and it could develop a complex if i don't go to that person okay so brothers think you read matthew 18 15 if thy brother shall trespass against me go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou has gained thy brother good verse 16 but if he'll not hear thee then take with thee one or two more than the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he neglect to hear them tell it to the church but if he neglected the church let him be unto thee as a he the man and the publican. so jesus said uh three strikes and you're out right or two strikes in your app right now this is for people in the local church right so but the point of this brother and sister is that if somebody's offended you you're you're going to be hurt and if you don't go talk to them satan could build up some complex or some evil feelings against the person does that make sense now what's what's wrong today is that people will go just bash somebody i'm going to go bash them on twitter right instead of hey can i call you we can need to talk about this right or send them a text and just tell them off and bleep any bleep and emojis like devil emojis you know i got one of those the other day i'm like what what in the world i said i'll pray for you sir he's from california so i don't even know what you're talking about i never said that i said well i said lord jesus father forgive them they don't know what they're doing got to offer love and forgiveness all right so your mind can be said everybody say that say my mind can be set ready my mind can be set you can you can set your mind on something and just keep everything else out you can do it you have to set your mind you have to hit cruise control and set it right i don't know i don't know about george but i gotta hit on i gotta turn cruise control on first and then i gotta get up to the speed i want and then i turn it on then i can set it so look there's multiple steps to setting it right so for us i got to pray first i go talk to the person and i can set my mind on things above see so it's going to take some time but as a man or woman thinks in their heart so are you so remember that you're a blood-bought blood forgiven child of the most high god and god is for you god is not against you all right i want to close with just a few thoughts here okay now go back to second corinthians 10. i think brother austin lina just missed this one but let's go back we're at the beginning it's okay we're just very glad you got here but i want to go over it one more time just let the church know uh 2nd corinthians 10 verse 4. the word complex is not in the bible the bible calls it a stronghold which is the same thing or it's a fortress or a castle or some type of military fortress okay so when i say i've got a complex that's what i'm saying i've got this i've got this all these evil feelings built up toward brother or sister or the president or you know a senator or something like that now verse four for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal they're not natural weapons but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds okay so in other words church we have weapons to tear these strongholds down okay who knows what's what's the name of the weapon that we use what's the one weapon the offensive weapon that we have is the the word the bible this which is a sword so in other words god is saying you go up to this wall you take my sword and my sword is so powerful now usually you want to use a sword against a brick wall right but god said my sword's a different kind of sword it's a double-edged sword amen it discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart and he said if you take my sword against the wall he said that sword will break through the wall it will tear down the wall that's what god's sword does now what does it look like for us verse five casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself i'm sorry every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing the captivity every thought to the obedience of christ in other words that thought about oh i hate my brother i hate my sister i i can't stand the preacher you've got to take that and cast it down and say i'm not going to let this stay in my mind i'm going to throw this down and it's leaving my mind i've got to cast out everybody say i've got to cast it out ready i've got to cast it out i can't do it for you you can't do it for me we've all got to choose to take to capture that thought bring that thought into capture and then cast it down and get it out of our minds but the bible said we have a mighty weapon do that the word of god amen now church look most people are going to be lost about jesus said few there be that find it so most people will never be able to do this they'll never be able to cast down evil thoughts like i shared with you that example uh michelle obama now she might be a nice woman but just one example she said i'll never be able to forgive donald trump for what he said about my husband not being born in uh the u.s well what is she basically saying she's basically saying i'm gonna hold a complex against him the rest of his life now that's just one example now there's all kinds of other examples i'm not picking on her i disagree with her politics to a million miles right but i'm sure she's a nice woman i'm sure but the point is it's this idea where i'm never going to forgive i'm going to let this complex grow and grow and grow until what it eats her away takes away her joy takes away her forgiveness now and jesus said if you can't forgive somebody else what do you say i'm not going to forgive you so look we look where people are placing themselves most people will never get victory over complexes but we are the few who can live free from complexes because we have mighty weapons amen we have the word of god praise god and we are more than conquerors and we are able soldiers we just must set our affection on things above set your mind on jesus christ and you'll remember well christ forgave me i will forgive everyone else and i'll go to them if i have to i say brother jesse we gotta talk her sister so-and-so can we please talk you've hurt me you offended me here here here and you have to let these areas be destroyed and you have to let the holy spirit heal you that's how you get victory over the complex okay so does that make sense by god's grace the bible says mighty so these things the word of god is mightily takes down our complexes okay now here's just a simple example in the book of genesis how many members of the man jacob abraham isaac jacob so jacob was the grandson of abraham he's the one that had 12 boys by four different women okay because it was it was okay in those days uh like a legal thing okay anyways before he had children he was living with his brother and his parents and he deceived his brother esau so he could because esau was the one who was born first he deceived his brother so he could get the birthright and not only the birthright he also got the blessing so he stole by deception he stole two things from his brother now when his brother found out guess what he said he said oh i forgive you no no he said i'm going to kill you right and so what did jacob do he ran away he ran and left i thought it was like 400 or 500 miles i think it was maybe maybe less by foot no i meant he wasn't in an uber he he walked all these miles and church who knows how long until he met esau and anyone know 19 years 19 years he worried my brother's going to kill me my brother's going to kill me he's going to kill me 19 years and then church he was leaving that land coming back to where his brother lived and you know what happened jacob heard esau was coming and he said before i meet this brother who's going to kill me i need to go talk to god about this because i've had a complex about him for almost 20 years church even the saints can have complexes for 20 years even saints but let me advise you let's not let it go 20 years let's not live in fear for 20 years where life can be miserable every time i get a call from that person or every time i get an email every let's not live in like that let's live in victory so you know he's a brother austin here's how we overcome complex you know what he did he said you know i'm going to send my wife's i'll send my wives first then i'm going to send my children behind them so they can go in mesa or go eat or go meet esau and he said i'm going to go pray in my closet we didn't go to the closet he went down to a river amen hallelujah he said i'm going to go down to the river and pray i've got a complex i'm afraid of this he's going to murder me knowing that after 20 years he probably killed me even more so what did what he did the bible said he prayed all night brother austin he was praying say god help kill me his name was jacob which means supplanter which means like a deceiver that was the name jacob the deceiver but as he's praying he saw the angel of the lord and the angel visited him and the angel tried to leave he said ibrahim said i'm not letting you leave until you bless me with victory over this complex amen i didn't hear you praise god and no i gotta go he's like no you're not leaving until you change me i need you to change me praise god that's how we get victory praise god we gotta plead with god in prayer say god change me i'm not leaving here until you change me praise god the bible said he wrestled the angel all night and he prevailed amen and then god changed his name he's no longer jacob now he's israel israel means a prince with power amen so he went from a deceiver after one prayer meeting amen one really long prayer meeting he went from from a deceiver to a prince a warrior that had favor with god and man praise god and then after that after he got up the bible said he had a new walk that next day the angel heard him but he had a new walk amen he had a new testimony praise god and now the best part was that he wasn't afraid to go meet the man that was going to murder him praise god now he wasn't you didn't have the complex anymore now he was fearless because he met somebody greater than esau amen he met the angel of the lord praise god and if he had met the angel lord and lived then surely that angel was going to protect him and he would allow him to live and face his greatest enemy because he met the greatest person there was god almighty praise god in church when you met god and you have fear for god you don't fear other people praise god one time you meet jesus christ one time you get born again one time you have a prayer meeting and the holy ghost comes down you won't fear anybody after that praise god because you know what real fear is that's being in the presence of god almighty so after 20 years jacob is able there to walk over and say brother esau he said will you receive a blessing and he said i was like no no and the met and they wept and cried together see but he'd build up this complex he's going to kill me he's going to kill me but he went to the prince of god and the bible said god does not give a spirit of fear so he went in the presence of god and he got the spirit he got the spirit of power love and a sound mind hallelujah so god wiped away the manner it is god might thrive the way the memory of my brother wants to kill me my brother wants to kill me in the prince of god this was all defeated by the mighty weapons of god amen hallelujah 19 years of mental torment i'm going to be murdered i'm going to be destroyed god wipes it away in one night with a prayer meeting and wrestling with the angel i don't know about you but i couldn't even i don't know if i could wrestle five minutes let alone all night right thinking about how weak we are right as human beings right now all of our food is mostly hybrid at least they had good food back then before the industrial revolution all these chemicals and everything but see he overcame his mind battle by getting in the presence of god and then he no longer feared man anymore and he forgave his brother and his brother forgave him and god worked it out when a man or woman church will go into the prince of god looking for help looking for answers god will answer their questions god will meet them and god will show up amen let's stand to our feet praise god musician can come how many enjoyed the word of god tonight let me do one more scripture here as we're standing here oh i almost got to it colossians 3 verse 16 church it says let the word of god dwell in you richly in all wisdom now let me just say this again remember this chapter begins by set your mind on god crucify anything else and then it said let the word of god abide in you abundantly what does that look like how does somebody let god's word abide in you abundantly what do you think what do you think malcolm i'll ask you you're pretty studious tonight what does that look like how does how do you as a 15 year old boy how do you let the word of god abide in you abundantly how how are you abundantly putting the word of god in your mind how do you do that what do you think pray and study the word but what if you got to fold clothes and do laundry like you did today or was it yesterday yesterday what do you how can you how can you fold clothes and do laundry and let the word of god dwell in you abundantly how do you do that what do you think that's right let's give him a round of applause he's right if you want to have victory in your mind you have to set your mind on god i'm that's that's what i'm going to do i'm that's my goal that's my only goal for today amen is to think about christ crucify everything else every evil desire and then let that word dwell in you abundantly put the word in you all the time as much as possible and here's how you do it teaching and admonishing one another she's not a good singer man i think there's a singer in there i never thought i'd sister sister i i i'd have been the worst singer before you and i can at least kind of carry a little tune a little bit i mean they put up with me all these years i mean how do you do that you let god's word dwell in you with psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord in other words if you're at work you can still sing all day some of you if you might get lucky you might be able to listen to sermons at work now now there they're paying you to oh my the devil the world's paying you to put god's word in your mind amen just like the devil paid jochebed to raise moses amen hallelujah i'll never forget those three summers i had after i got my job i painted the schools in our district for three summers and that met sister naomi for 40 hours every week i got to listen to brother branham oh my it was glorious amen i'm just painting away say oh i never let me go write that down real quick okay let me start painting again it was three and all it was hard to be away from my children malakai and lydia missed me for those summers you know casey a little bit too but it was some of the most glorious time where i could spend the whole day nature hearing god's word hearing the prophet of god teach me the word of god for three straight summers add that up how many how many hours is that you know almost two and a half months 40 hours a week of the word of god but you know what i was very thankful god let his word dwell in my heart abundantly and i was never the same
