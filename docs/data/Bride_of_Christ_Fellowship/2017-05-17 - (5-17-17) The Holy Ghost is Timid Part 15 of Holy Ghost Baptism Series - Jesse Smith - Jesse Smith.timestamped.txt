[50:12] title for tonight is the Holy Ghost is
[50:14] timid kind of odd title but for those
[50:19] people baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[50:21] those desiring net you must understand
[50:24] how to approach the Holy Ghost okay yes
[50:27] sir yeah I just want this one yeah it's
[50:41] going to work I need to talk to man
[50:42] again he needs to I need to get a
[50:44] refresher from him my mom my lorrison
[50:48] sister Karen if you're watching which
[50:49] they are faithful watching
[50:51] forgive me but I could show it on Sunday
[50:55] if you remind me I'll show it on Sunday
[50:56] by God's grace so I do - let me get this
[51:01] plugged in that will get to the root of
[51:02] God we had some wonderful we had upset
[51:05] we had a wonderful service we'll have
[51:06] one service on Sunday I preached it on
[51:08] voice went out I think I've reached two
[51:10] hours and then I prayed at the altar for
[51:12] like a half hour with some of the saints
[51:13] that come up for prayer so my voice is
[51:15] quite strained today but I'm just going
[51:18] to give it all I got my gods Greece only
[51:21] live once by God's grace today with
[51:22] everything I got to Christ II so I'm not
[51:25] much of a servant but the least of them
[51:27] but I just want to do what God has me to
[51:30] do here so let's look at part 15 here
[51:33] tonight it's quite a it's quite it's
[51:36] been quite a while since I was on the
[51:38] subject so that's part 15 and the last
[51:42] time I preached on it was November night
[51:44] so even before I had an invocation back
[51:46] by God's grace it's been a while so I
[51:49] preached 14 parts and I got them all say
[51:51] you know if you ever interested also on
[51:54] YouTube Church channel by one look at
[51:57] the Holy Ghost is timid tonight by the
[52:00] grace of the Lord that doesn't mean
[52:01] scare it means he's sensitive and he's
[52:06] watching all of us tonight
[52:07] you know every night air every service
[52:09] and there's a balance to it like oh the
[52:12] main thing I would you get tonight is
[52:13] that the Holy Spirit sent it in we got
[52:15] to be aware of his presence
[52:17] now remember Church he's quick to
[52:20] forgive to just I just want to say that
[52:22] we're going to go through a lot of
[52:23] culture by the Grahams you'll say you
[52:25] don't move around but we gotta remember
[52:28] he's quick to forgive we make a little
[52:29] stick you know by God's grace so and it
[52:34] doesn't mean we can't have her smile on
[52:36] the service can mean it doesn't mean we
[52:37] can't ever laugh because you can I'm
[52:38] going to show you brother branham makes
[52:40] it joke at the end of the summer in
[52:42] church age in 1960 he said you ought to
[52:44] love each other so much you can chew on
[52:46] another's chewing gum and everybody
[52:48] started to crack it up I started
[52:50] laughing on the date in church they say
[52:52] one of them I started laughing
[52:55] they sing one of them and then they
[52:57] started singing another song and they
[52:59] get three unknown tongues interpretation
[53:02] right in a row and it brought three
[53:04] people to the altar three people got
[53:07] saved that night program said each
[53:08] telling interpretation was for one of
[53:10] them if spoke directly to their
[53:12] situation right after a prophet makes a
[53:15] joke but see that's not a bad joke
[53:18] that's just a clean joke right because
[53:22] God has a sense of humor so what up I
[53:25] just want to preach on that tonight the
[53:27] Holy Ghost attended and we want to be
[53:30] aware of it but we want to also we also
[53:34] want to please him okay that he can come
[53:37] and deal with us more and the reason I'm
[53:40] preaching it tonight is because I know
[53:45] let me say like this I know everybody
[53:47] loves the Lord but I'm talking about I
[53:50] want to just say the people I want to
[53:54] say it the right way so just bear with
[53:55] me here I say it wrong forgive me the
[53:57] people that can become side that the
[54:00] people that can be really dedicated to
[54:02] church come on Wednesday night
[54:07] that can be some people can't because of
[54:10] distance now some people choose not to
[54:12] and that's wrong what I'm saying is that
[54:17] you have chosen to come here god bless
[54:19] you and if those most dedicated or that
[54:24] want to be most dedicated to the
[54:25] ministry here if we can all put myself
[54:29] in here too if we can all get a good
[54:32] understanding of this God will continue
[54:34] to pour out those blessings among us so
[54:38] I just want to say that not and I
[54:40] understand some people live an hour hour
[54:42] and a half when he lives three and a
[54:44] half hours I don't expect them to drive
[54:46] that far on Wednesday night Church but
[54:49] what I want to say too is that even if
[54:51] whoever can't come we hope they're live
[54:53] streaming and pulling on the word and
[54:55] someone to try to read address this
[54:57] again on Sunday when everybody's here
[54:59] outside morning because it's like having
[55:01] kind of like having two churches you
[55:03] know one church on Sunday mornings real
[55:05] big and then the other ones are real
[55:07] small that's understandable because the
[55:08] distance there's nothing against we
[55:10] appreciate everybody that loved to drive
[55:12] god bless them but I'm saying of all out
[55:16] of everybody we want the most dedicated
[55:18] people the ones that are really sure
[55:21] this is where God wants them if we can
[55:23] get hold of this God can continue to
[55:24] move new people raise people up into
[55:28] positions in the church reveal gifts to
[55:31] people like if you don't know your gifts
[55:32] got to reveal those to you and then what
[55:36] is that do it gets us more mature in
[55:37] Christ and we have the Holy Spirit
[55:39] moving more amongst us and that's what
[55:41] we all want amen so I hope that came
[55:45] across the right way if not somebody
[55:48] come tell me afterwards you know send me
[55:50] a text
[55:50] I want everybody know especially those
[55:52] that can't make it on tonight we love
[55:53] them we love everybody
[55:55] we hope everybody's as much dedicated as
[56:00] everybody else understand so there's our
[56:04] text the and the Bible says the Holy
[56:07] Ghost is timid which means sensitive and
[56:11] reserved numbers the Holy Ghost isn't
[56:14] quick to just come and anoint a service
[56:17] he reserves himself he waits until the
[56:20] atmospheres
[56:21] right so this is an hour stretch of
[56:25] green nut
[56:26] the Holy Spirit of God so the word
[56:29] grieve and the Greek means to make
[56:31] sorrowful to affect with sadness to
[56:33] cause grief the throne to sorrow to
[56:35] agreed to a fed that's the word I often
[56:37] use the most when we sin or we don't
[56:39] when we act like God's not around or God
[56:41] can't come and do something actually
[56:43] offends God now not he's not eternally
[56:46] upset at us charity understand it's up
[56:48] there it's like a parent and a child
[56:50] like if Malachi or Lydia if they sinned
[56:53] I don't forever want them to leave our
[56:56] house I just want them to say they're
[56:58] sorry and I'll kiss some good night and
[57:00] hug them you know in Nevermore you know
[57:02] same way with my dad when he spend me
[57:05] all right you didn't get rid of me no my
[57:07] mom would see you had to put soap in my
[57:09] mouth or say bad words when I was a
[57:10] teenager she did want to get rid of me
[57:12] she just wanted me to be obedient and
[57:14] she's quick to forgive us ranchers who
[57:17] put this over my mouth she made me
[57:18] suffer you know that she didn't deny me
[57:20] suffer although something I did that not
[57:23] for a long time so I understand like
[57:25] that's what we're saying here he's timid
[57:28] in that he gets offended easily by sin
[57:32] or unbelief or bad attitudes because if
[57:36] that actually comes from a bad spirit
[57:39] now let's get the context so got your
[57:42] Bible and I could use me to sum up
[57:43] readers to let fusions 4:23 if you got
[57:46] that group I'll count on some brothers
[57:54] to read tonight I mean something we have
[57:56] so many brothers I think any brothers or
[58:00] sisters with my bleep preciate it a de
[58:03] minimis obey they med son one day dad
[58:08] will be here by God's grace it gets on
[58:10] first shift
[58:10] or will it but Adam would you read 23 24
[58:16] maybe you read 25 and 26
[58:21] I'm sorry fusions 423 I'm sorry but my
[58:24] father my father does that be 23 24
[58:27] whatever you're ready and be renewed in
[58:30] the spirit of your mind
[58:31] and that ye put on the
[58:33] man which after God is created in
[58:36] righteousness and true holiness they met
[58:39] so how many believin get a fresh start
[58:41] to your mind and how many enjoy it don't
[58:44] you like that you feel like your mind
[58:45] it'll reset button and now you just got
[58:47] a pure mind to get that's what Paul is
[58:49] telling us and there's description sex
[58:51] really that says do it every day right
[58:52] we're supposed to renew it daily I daily
[58:54] renew our minding and so that's what the
[58:57] Bible saying we're going to make our
[58:58] minds new get a new life just throw out
[59:01] the old line get a clean life okay with
[59:04] a menu 25 and 26 wherefore putting away
[59:07] lying speak every man truth with this
[59:10] neighbor we are members one of another
[59:14] be angry and sin not let not the Sun go
[59:17] down upon your wrath
[59:18] thank you brother appreciate that now
[59:21] notice what it says there here are some
[59:23] things that grieve the Holy Spirit lie
[59:24] and then being angry and not taking care
[59:28] of it because what is verse 27 says if
[59:32] we lie or we hold any doors verse 27 say
[59:35] neither give place to the devil so when
[59:40] we lie or don't take care of wrath or
[59:44] anger it actually allows a demon to get
[59:46] into our spirit and then our secured our
[59:48] mind is not renewed anymore snot to do
[59:50] now it's black we basically fed the
[59:53] black dog and it's not like a full demon
[59:56] possession like but it is an evil sphere
[59:59] influencing us right no verse 28 29 Mel
[1:00:08] Kiper 28 29 sir
[1:00:09] I never still vesko steal no more but
[1:00:14] rather let him labor working with his
[1:00:16] hands the thing which is good that he
[1:00:19] may have to give to him that needeth let
[1:00:22] no corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:00:25] your mouth but that which is good to the
[1:00:27] use of edifying that it may Minister
[1:00:29] grace unto the ears that you see now
[1:00:32] goes into the more things that we got to
[1:00:34] overcome if there's any stealing or
[1:00:35] corrupt communication we're supposed to
[1:00:37] build people up now don't be around
[1:00:40] there's times where the Bible says
[1:00:41] you're supposed to warn people there's
[1:00:44] times the Bible says you're supposed to
[1:00:45] review people
[1:00:47] right so this isn't like every time you
[1:00:50] got to be all gracious I mean we do want
[1:00:51] to be gracious but there are times you
[1:00:53] gotta warn and review to understand that
[1:00:56] now verse 30 was our text reading out
[1:00:59] those very God ladies you read 31 32
[1:01:02] dark all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:01:05] and slavery
[1:01:06] equal speaking be put away from you with
[1:01:07] all malice be ye kind one to another
[1:01:10] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[1:01:12] even as God for Christ's sake amen so
[1:01:18] any bitterness
[1:01:19] any wrath anger clamor evil speaking put
[1:01:24] away from you with all malice there's a
[1:01:25] lot of things in there I'm not going to
[1:01:28] go through all those maybe something or
[1:01:29] willing and be tender-hearted so have a
[1:01:32] tender heart be tender towards people
[1:01:34] that might sit against you show them
[1:01:36] tenderness instead of hardness praise
[1:01:39] God
[1:01:39] now go dance at the word tinted now he
[1:01:43] said the Holy Ghost is him and I looked
[1:01:44] it up and the only one that made sense
[1:01:46] to me as far as all these fear not to be
[1:01:48] wrong was sensitively reserved because
[1:01:52] the Holy Ghost is not scared of you with
[1:01:54] that so that's one of them what's one of
[1:01:57] the definitions like you're the Holy
[1:01:58] Spirit isn't scared the Holy Spirit
[1:02:00] though has reservations about when he
[1:02:03] comes down and he's sensitive to the
[1:02:06] right atmosphere so let's look at this
[1:02:10] now you got you have a good
[1:02:11] understanding a little bit about this
[1:02:13] Paul says don't breathe him don't offend
[1:02:16] him with all these things like
[1:02:17] bitterness like wrath anger malice
[1:02:22] corrupt communication stealing lying
[1:02:26] angry you're not not dealing with anger
[1:02:29] see that here we see that okay let's go
[1:02:31] through a few quotes I think you'll like
[1:02:33] these by God's grace I think you're
[1:02:34] really lacking the ramesses old God is
[1:02:37] my prayer wake up the church to an
[1:02:38] old-fashioned all-night prayer meetings
[1:02:39] I've never done one of those but I'm
[1:02:41] praying to God witness up to that wake
[1:02:44] the people up to a spiritual atmosphere
[1:02:46] oh it takes that to bring children to
[1:02:48] Kingdom it takes the atmosphere right
[1:02:52] this night while we're sitting here if
[1:02:53] this right atmosphere would take place
[1:02:55] the entire group would be refilled with
[1:02:56] the Holy Ghost every search six person
[1:02:59] will be made well it's the app
[1:03:00] scare that does it you can take a
[1:03:03] headache and put it in an incubator and
[1:03:06] keep the atmosphere right it will hatch
[1:03:07] out of the chicken not an incubator I've
[1:03:09] done that at school we did that one time
[1:03:11] it works because if the atmosphere that
[1:03:14] counts put a chicken egg underdog you
[1:03:17] know hatch a have to be a real steel dog
[1:03:19] right there right real gentle dog it's
[1:03:24] the atmosphere and that's what it takes
[1:03:25] in the church today not so much starchy
[1:03:27] Creedon theology of course but the
[1:03:29] spirit of living God pouring down upon
[1:03:31] his people to bring a spiritual
[1:03:32] atmosphere not once a widely this total
[1:03:35] I believe it's that it's hard for the
[1:03:38] Holy Spirit to work I understand it's
[1:03:41] hard for God to work sorry forgot to
[1:03:44] work why because Satan's badly whatever
[1:03:47] side it's not a picnic right we're on
[1:03:51] the front lines of a war
[1:03:52] Amen praise God we are it's not to
[1:03:56] discourage I go so hard I'm not gonna
[1:03:58] try that's not the attitude we want to
[1:04:00] have we want to say it's hard but with
[1:04:02] God all things are possible
[1:04:03] amen now I'm taking this thought of hard
[1:04:08] that left eye looks yellow on mine but I
[1:04:11] said the TV does maybe is nice is good
[1:04:14] I'm jumping to a different sermon to
[1:04:17] show how the Rebbe says this over and
[1:04:18] over again but the right kind of music
[1:04:20] on the piano the organ everybody that is
[1:04:22] fear that Jesus Christ is there I'm
[1:04:24] going to be everything that we need up
[1:04:26] something we'll go to taking place
[1:04:29] atmosphere that's the hardest thing
[1:04:32] there is to do and that is to get the
[1:04:36] people in that atmosphere the atmosphere
[1:04:38] of worship the atmosphere of believing
[1:04:44] so I'm not talking about an easy thing
[1:04:47] to do I'm talking about that this is a
[1:04:49] hard thing to do the hardest thing there
[1:04:53] is to do is to get people to really
[1:04:56] worship from their hearts and really
[1:04:59] believe from their hearts amen
[1:05:04] holiday via he says again God doesn't
[1:05:08] fall upon denominations God doesn't fall
[1:05:11] upon mechanical devices God
[1:05:14] the Holy Spirit fell upon men man is
[1:05:17] God's agent and the hardest thing that
[1:05:19] God has ever had to do was to get one
[1:05:21] mortal to believe another you believe
[1:05:24] that they couldn't believe Moses God
[1:05:26] give two signs approve the people that
[1:05:28] he was sent from God for their
[1:05:29] deliverance you you believe that well
[1:05:31] isn't he the same yesterday today and
[1:05:32] forever think about that I don't even
[1:05:35] have the gifts of a brother Brennan or
[1:05:36] Moses and I try to get people to bleed
[1:05:38] he could hardly get anybody to believe
[1:05:40] and he had yes see over saying this is a
[1:05:45] difficult thing to do it takes God
[1:05:48] because then nobody gets any glory but
[1:05:51] God but we've got to do our part we've
[1:05:54] got a yield you've got a surrender we
[1:05:55] got to repent we have to be sensitive to
[1:05:57] the Holy Spirit now we're back to the
[1:06:03] quote where he said it's hard do you
[1:06:05] know what the Holy Spirit first came and
[1:06:07] we do remember of course remember it was
[1:06:09] on the day of Pentecost when they were
[1:06:10] all one place and one Accord so see this
[1:06:14] proves that we've all got to come to
[1:06:15] church we've all got to be in one place
[1:06:17] and then a week now that we're here one
[1:06:20] place now we just got to get in one
[1:06:21] Accord one by one thing you want to
[1:06:24] decide or one passion that word means
[1:06:26] passion one passion they met me we've
[1:06:29] all gotta want to see God move in our
[1:06:30] midst and then there came from heaven a
[1:06:33] sound like a rushing mighty wind they
[1:06:34] had to get the atmosphere right now jump
[1:06:39] into a new quote now you're the patient
[1:06:41] he's in the para line I want you to kind
[1:06:43] of come over this way if you want I'm
[1:06:45] sorry if you will I want you to stand
[1:06:47] there I want you to clear just let
[1:06:49] yourself be quiet just want to contact
[1:06:50] you it's just a little difficult you
[1:06:53] don't understand what I mean
[1:06:54] no you're now you're we're strangers
[1:06:55] aren't we I've never seen you knowingly
[1:06:57] I don't know nothing about you and we
[1:06:59] just met here at the time now the Holy
[1:07:01] Spirit is so timid you know very timid
[1:07:03] I must find favor with him first so
[1:07:08] brother Brandon had to find a favor by
[1:07:10] what repenting by worshiping by getting
[1:07:14] in a channel getting all any evil
[1:07:16] thoughts any evil thinking any evil
[1:07:18] desires he hadn't heard that out the
[1:07:20] repair repentance and work
[1:07:22] and then he finds favor with God how
[1:07:25] many what God's favorite Laughing Man I
[1:07:27] ask for every service as for God give me
[1:07:30] favor
[1:07:30] give me your Holy Spirit give me your
[1:07:32] anointing that the people we bless when
[1:07:34] they leave here but Graham I understand
[1:07:36] we got a quiet down the reason I had to
[1:07:39] show off my phone shut off you know shut
[1:07:41] off the computers if I'm going to pray
[1:07:43] and all these things because there can't
[1:07:44] be any distractions I gotta get quiet
[1:07:46] out and really realize that God's there
[1:07:49] says it again now just a little longer
[1:07:52] it's a few minutes until 10:00 if you'll
[1:07:53] just wait this is my last night here
[1:07:55] please when you move our syrup just
[1:07:57] shakes meat up this is his gift I lose
[1:08:01] the anointing so quickly see it's a very
[1:08:07] easy thing to do to lose the anointing
[1:08:08] it's a hard thing to get but an easy
[1:08:11] thing to lose coming money it's hard to
[1:08:14] get it but you lose it oh fast and I was
[1:08:19] said Christ has gold right buy of me
[1:08:22] gold tried in the fire
[1:08:22] amen holy spirit of spiritual riches
[1:08:25] it's worth all the died out praise God
[1:08:29] the Holy Spirit very timid how he knows
[1:08:31] that very timid if you'll just be
[1:08:33] reverent just a little while longer so
[1:08:36] see that's what we're saying like we can
[1:08:38] feel good for a little service like I've
[1:08:40] had I've had a preacher thunder service
[1:08:42] while the one anoint he was really good
[1:08:44] and all of a sudden something change and
[1:08:45] I felt that too you know different
[1:08:47] churches you know not talking about I'm
[1:08:48] not saying anything bad about our church
[1:08:50] it happens in every Church I'm just
[1:08:53] saying like one misstep or one missed
[1:08:57] off if not quickly robbed back to
[1:08:59] repentance can change the atmosphere
[1:09:01] right and so the anointing of them the
[1:09:05] faith can leave so quickly we've got to
[1:09:08] just be a momentum positive and later
[1:09:10] we've got a battle to keep the faith now
[1:09:15] Reverend just as revered as you can be
[1:09:16] for the Spirit of God is very timid
[1:09:18] everyone knows that
[1:09:19] sometimes if you're moved around it
[1:09:20] interrupts people moving around and all
[1:09:22] these things like that now that's that's
[1:09:25] moving around in the ungodly way he said
[1:09:28] see you're conscious every one of you
[1:09:29] and you to yourself is a supernatural
[1:09:31] bein you know you know that you see
[1:09:32] program that psychology it's not if it
[1:09:35] is you
[1:09:35] Christ's use it while you took the
[1:09:37] people out of the multitude and took a
[1:09:39] man out of the city and given the side
[1:09:40] again is that right see there were so
[1:09:43] many people moving around rice had to
[1:09:45] pull people out of the valta tubes in
[1:09:47] order to heal them and we know we had to
[1:09:49] do that I think he gives us another
[1:09:50] example you got here Jerry says cops
[1:09:51] remember Jerry Sue's house Jesus had to
[1:09:53] kick out the people who were laughing
[1:09:55] and saying oh she's sleeping aw Jesus
[1:09:58] you're a joker he had to kick them out
[1:10:01] in order to get the atmosphere right
[1:10:02] that's right so see it depends how
[1:10:06] you're moving it depends what you're
[1:10:07] saying that's right you know you've done
[1:10:12] he put him out of the house that right
[1:10:13] and then he raised the girl is that true
[1:10:16] so see the Holy Spirit very sensitive we
[1:10:19] got to have the right atmosphere
[1:10:23] how many is here without a prayer card
[1:10:26] let's your hands want to be healed well
[1:10:27] it's so many why it's hard to tell who
[1:10:29] it who is who I want to ask you
[1:10:31] something you know I did not know you
[1:10:33] now we just got plenty of time now here
[1:10:35] don't be in any rush there at the end of
[1:10:40] the service going to the paralyzer motor
[1:10:42] have said don't be in a rush to leave
[1:10:46] right see you get to rush in the Holy
[1:10:50] Spirit is very timid
[1:10:52] oh come on preacher come on with any men
[1:10:55] close the service come on yeah I gotta
[1:10:59] you know if you got to go
[1:11:00] listen Church that's understand it just
[1:11:02] bow your head you know say Lord I love
[1:11:03] you and just walk out with a smile you
[1:11:06] know that got agenda you know sometimes
[1:11:08] you have family things are extended
[1:11:10] people need to go but if it's if it's
[1:11:13] you don't have to go you got to keep the
[1:11:16] right attitude just like I've got all
[1:11:18] the time in the world we want to see God
[1:11:20] move but man I don't want to what rush
[1:11:23] you
[1:11:24] I want you to be reverent like you have
[1:11:27] plenty of time and some of my most score
[1:11:31] is prayer times now this is interesting
[1:11:32] I hope you can understand this I don't
[1:11:35] mean this in any in any negative way but
[1:11:38] some of my most glorious prayer times or
[1:11:40] even praying for people is like right
[1:11:44] after service when some people rush out
[1:11:46] it's okay they're allowed to rush out
[1:11:49] it's problematic me for good reason but
[1:11:51] some of my most sincere wonderful times
[1:11:53] worse than God had been once people
[1:11:56] rushed out and then what was left just
[1:12:00] those who under our hat time or could
[1:12:02] stay and worship the Lord does every
[1:12:05] understand
[1:12:06] god bless mother's I know they can't you
[1:12:08] know sometimes they can't keep the kids
[1:12:09] in here I understand that and sometimes
[1:12:10] they leave to help the atmosphere right
[1:12:14] just like sister Mita said programs that
[1:12:16] thank God me is able to take Joseph out
[1:12:17] and Sarah you know so that you might be
[1:12:19] blessed so do you see that even Sunday
[1:12:27] my we were talking right after I got
[1:12:29] done preaching a lot of people left and
[1:12:31] just a few minutes later somebody got
[1:12:34] healed Church and somebody went their
[1:12:36] way to repentance 14 year old boy and I
[1:12:39] talked to him last night on the phone
[1:12:40] he's doing great by God's grace hey
[1:12:42] you've had every word I gave him I musta
[1:12:44] pray for her 30 15 or 30 minutes were
[1:12:46] weeping he's shaking you know repenting
[1:12:48] of these sins you know raising his hands
[1:12:50] to God I'm leading him a guy in through
[1:12:53] prayer repentance it was awesome and
[1:12:56] then some Academy said well Jesse the
[1:12:58] sister came up for prayer go pray for so
[1:13:00] I walked over and now she sit down said
[1:13:02] sister can I pray for you she said she
[1:13:04] looked at me she said brother she said
[1:13:06] God already healed me I said glory of
[1:13:11] her like glory to God and church and she
[1:13:15] said the very time that he got the
[1:13:16] breakthrough in prayer and was
[1:13:18] worshiping crying raising hands was the
[1:13:20] same time she was shouted glorifying God
[1:13:22] and being healed and see how the Holy
[1:13:24] Spirit it just went from one person to
[1:13:26] the next right met that need and
[1:13:29] immediately goes to meet that need what
[1:13:32] are we saying to say thank you Jesus but
[1:13:34] it was after everybody that you know and
[1:13:37] no doubt Sunday was Mother's Day no
[1:13:39] doubt I understand people need to go see
[1:13:40] mama I'm not trying to stop you from
[1:13:42] doing it I guess there was a wave of
[1:13:45] that's understandable but if people want
[1:13:48] to touch from God they got to hang
[1:13:50] around and it got a crazy atmosphere
[1:13:55] does everyone stand up
[1:13:57] alright and now I'm just being worship
[1:14:01] you can watch this way but whenever I
[1:14:02] say now
[1:14:03] do as I tell you for is it me where the
[1:14:05] anointing strikes me I don't even know
[1:14:06] what know until my brother play a tape
[1:14:08] and tell me what I said that's why they
[1:14:10] take tit because mother I wouldn't know
[1:14:11] what he didn't know what he said because
[1:14:12] it's the Holy Spirit talking you see
[1:14:15] it's just so timid the Holy Spirit just
[1:14:18] the least little thing offensive creeps
[1:14:21] you know Reverend Jesus will come to you
[1:14:24] if you're all excited he can't come to
[1:14:26] you to be reverent and believe now if
[1:14:29] one person is ministered here on the
[1:14:31] platform that's God's attitude towards
[1:14:33] every person around look at that if and
[1:14:36] this is what happened when I can send
[1:14:37] with the Holy Spirit went immediately
[1:14:38] from that person to that person whenever
[1:14:41] somebody gets a breakthrough or answer a
[1:14:43] prayer or something
[1:14:44] that means God wants to help everybody
[1:14:46] who's in the congregation because what
[1:14:49] is it it's a pouring out of God's Spirit
[1:14:50] it's God's sending down a blessing he's
[1:14:52] sending down a shower and everybody can
[1:14:54] enjoy that shower amen
[1:14:57] it's so true church is so true now the
[1:15:01] sister they got healed was sister Karen
[1:15:03] so you know sister Carrie she had knee
[1:15:05] trouble that weekend sister Beth even
[1:15:06] drove down two hours to help her because
[1:15:08] she couldn't walk around and she had
[1:15:10] trouble
[1:15:11] she said incidentally God healed her
[1:15:12] need there by God's grace very thankful
[1:15:15] for that now I'm going to skip down he
[1:15:23] says that we want everything in order
[1:15:24] right
[1:15:25] just if you let it get out of order
[1:15:26] watch how quick the Holy Spirit takes
[1:15:28] its flight
[1:15:29] oh it's dim it you let somebody start
[1:15:31] just believing just watch how it leaves
[1:15:33] me just as quick as it can it won't it
[1:15:37] just won't stay around where there's
[1:15:38] unbelief it just won't do it very very
[1:15:40] timid notice many times I see visions
[1:15:45] and then I'd speak and if they don't
[1:15:47] respond to it it moves right over to
[1:15:48] someone else you see it's very timid the
[1:15:51] Holy Spirit and see that how many
[1:15:53] understand like each service got to deal
[1:15:55] with you on something let me understand
[1:15:56] it like the Holy Spirit wants to come by
[1:15:58] and help each person but if if we refuse
[1:16:01] that and say no I'm not going to go for
[1:16:02] prayer no I'm not going to worship God
[1:16:04] no I'm not going to file through that if
[1:16:07] we don't follow through that or operate
[1:16:09] with that or let that go
[1:16:11] follow that then he moves on to somebody
[1:16:13] else
[1:16:16] so we want to be sensitive to that by
[1:16:18] God's grace yeah and the sort of the
[1:16:23] Bible says here now maybe the person
[1:16:24] sitting there with good faith believing
[1:16:26] that would help them little it will not
[1:16:28] heal them it doesn't heal them it just
[1:16:30] gives them confidence additions to know
[1:16:32] that their prayers have so high priests
[1:16:33] and sometimes they'll miss it by not
[1:16:35] knowing just how to take ahold of them
[1:16:36] it's something new it's not no more than
[1:16:39] what your past or anyone else can pray
[1:16:40] for you after all it's just the prayer
[1:16:42] of faith to save the sick sometimes
[1:16:44] basically say anybody can pray for a
[1:16:46] sick person as long as there's faith
[1:16:48] there
[1:16:49] remember sisters can have miracles get
[1:16:51] some air holes I've seen the sister cast
[1:16:53] out a demon out of the mat I've seen
[1:16:54] that I've seen it sisters gonna have any
[1:16:57] gift except preaching and what we need
[1:17:00] though is the right atmosphere and we
[1:17:03] just need some faith praise God neither
[1:17:05] faith believe it mean the believing
[1:17:07] faith Sabri understand is that help I
[1:17:10] got now he said but I have a need of God
[1:17:13] I'm just going to raise my hand now if
[1:17:15] you'll just set up for a few minutes
[1:17:16] watch be careful be quiet now I don't
[1:17:17] mean what I say be quiet if the Lord
[1:17:20] does anything and you want to praise the
[1:17:21] Lord that's worship so brother having
[1:17:23] quiet the people say just work worship
[1:17:25] but he said if you want to shout praise
[1:17:27] God he said go ahead I'm going to show
[1:17:29] you right now where he does right in a
[1:17:32] certain right in a prayer line it's real
[1:17:35] quiet but then somebody goes to shouting
[1:17:36] and then the Holy Spirit goes to the
[1:17:38] person that's shouting and they get
[1:17:39] healed so see God understand that we
[1:17:45] want it reverent but reference can be
[1:17:47] showing reverence can be crying
[1:17:49] reverence can be dancing dancing it is
[1:17:52] render they head because it's in the
[1:17:54] order of the Holy Spirit but what I mean
[1:18:00] just run around a gun you know so you
[1:18:01] talk about Felix won't get up and want
[1:18:03] to walk around not people that want to
[1:18:05] worship and the lawyer is very very very
[1:18:08] timid very timid just like it just
[1:18:10] anything like that it just leaves me and
[1:18:12] I just have to battle there's a word I
[1:18:14] forgot the bold that word he's got a
[1:18:16] battle to get that back once somebody
[1:18:19] breaks that atmosphere he's got a battle
[1:18:21] and just kind of resetting
[1:18:23] hallelujah he's kind of relaxed himself
[1:18:25] and give the people quiet down in order
[1:18:28] to start ministering again
[1:18:30] now I want to show you this video
[1:18:32] Belgrad tells you god bless you now he
[1:18:34] calls her a colored sister now colored
[1:18:35] is not politically incorrect it's black
[1:18:38] or african-american you know one time at
[1:18:40] one time I was listing programs so much
[1:18:42] color color color I went to school and
[1:18:44] the principal I was talking to principal
[1:18:47] about one of the black children I said
[1:18:48] oh the colored boy was you know
[1:18:50] mistreated and she said don't say that
[1:18:52] that's not politically correct I said
[1:18:53] halt forgive me I listen to sermons all
[1:18:55] the time from the 1960s you know she's
[1:18:58] kinda like to do that so I don't mean to
[1:19:01] be politically incorrect but listen here

[1:20:42] black sisters Legrand pronounces that
[1:20:46] healed he tells that what their
[1:20:48] condition is and she stays up praising
[1:20:50] God I like I always loved this video God

[1:22:23] church I'm sorry
[1:22:24] I'm just try to do that okay so anyways
[1:22:29] I think you understand here God just
[1:22:36] loves to be worshipped
[1:22:42] so anyways the point is it's okay to
[1:22:45] worship it since the Holy Spirit praise
[1:22:48] God and Holy Spirit doesn't get offended
[1:22:51] if you're truly worship amen
[1:22:53] he likes the noise because these girls
[1:22:55] these women are screaming at the top of
[1:22:56] their lungs and that's it he's kind of
[1:22:59] stumbling out of the Spirit says I see
[1:23:00] the light over here now that he says
[1:23:02] color sisters god bless you for your
[1:23:04] shouting he's the raise up to your feet
[1:23:08] the of this this disease and he said
[1:23:11] you're healing the name of Jesus Christ
[1:23:12] and I started praising God so I think
[1:23:14] you understand okay let me move up look
[1:23:16] around so the Bible talk the Holy Ghost
[1:23:17] can be driven away how many know that
[1:23:20] the grandeur says always any wonderful
[1:23:22] you love him is he good you know there's
[1:23:23] been a little more reverence tonight I
[1:23:25] think I read this one already yeah the
[1:23:29] Holy Spirit's timid anyone knows that he
[1:23:31] just leave like he did in the Bible that
[1:23:35] struck me like huh when you move around
[1:23:38] just interferes you can't do that he'll
[1:23:40] just leave me and I just stand there so
[1:23:43] how was he how did he leave in the Bible
[1:23:47] well the Bible said he left the whole
[1:23:48] earth here mother I know this is when he
[1:23:51] left Adam and Eve member they had a holy
[1:23:52] veil over them they have the Holy Spirit
[1:23:54] anointing over them and the Holy Spirit
[1:23:57] was driven away why because it is so big
[1:24:00] as soon as they disobeyed eyes are open
[1:24:03] and they knew they were naked so shame
[1:24:05] and sin came upon them they drove the
[1:24:08] Holy Spirit way by disobeying the word
[1:24:11] here's another one you remember this his
[1:24:14] family was offended now that's a story I
[1:24:17] want to preach that one time on Easter
[1:24:19] all of Jesus's brothers were offended
[1:24:22] and James was one of his brothers the
[1:24:25] very James who wrote the book of James
[1:24:27] he didn't believe he said oh you're what
[1:24:29] are you doing you're crazy even his own
[1:24:32] brother didn't believe but then he
[1:24:33] believed after the resurrection eating
[1:24:35] the head that's right and he did not
[1:24:38] many works there because of their
[1:24:39] unbelief so unbelief bad attitudes right
[1:24:43] drives the holy spirit away here's where
[1:24:46] he says it now see I copied a basis I'm
[1:24:48] sorry it just didn't work I was born at
[1:24:52] the time that gift was savagely given to
[1:24:54] me but I couldn't do one thing
[1:24:55] that gets unless you believe it it's
[1:24:58] your faith of what I'm telling you about
[1:24:59] Jesus Christ that draws dividends on
[1:25:01] what God has did for you in Jesus name
[1:25:03] you see if that's what makes me weak in
[1:25:05] the platform that's why the reason you
[1:25:08] have to pack me out you see that
[1:25:09] scripture enough see it's you using
[1:25:12] God's Vietnam meat it's you not every
[1:25:14] one of you now just shut down on me and
[1:25:16] say I don't believe he's a hypocrite
[1:25:18] and I don't believe nothing of it there
[1:25:21] could not be one thing done mm-hmm now
[1:25:25] see the same is true for me if you look
[1:25:27] up at me and saying about he's a
[1:25:28] hypocrite he's a sinner well I do sin
[1:25:30] but my sins under the blood if I repent
[1:25:32] a man we're all we all fall short of the
[1:25:35] glory of God no matter who comes up here
[1:25:37] they're still human but see you gotta
[1:25:40] have the right attitude toward any gift
[1:25:41] of God you get sit there and condemn the
[1:25:42] preacher you give you the naked mistakes
[1:25:45] you say Lord forgive them show them the
[1:25:47] truth you know my brother madam said if
[1:25:49] you disagree on the church ages say
[1:25:51] probe say lord I pray for brother Graham
[1:25:53] that you'd open his eyes to see the
[1:25:54] truth beaver a humble like that now he
[1:25:58] gives the scripture Jesus went to the
[1:26:00] city where he was born and said many
[1:26:02] mighty works could not he do because of
[1:26:05] what because of their unbelief just read
[1:26:07] that scripture why is the approach look
[1:26:09] at the woman how she touched his
[1:26:10] garments and God healed but look at the
[1:26:11] Roman soldiers put a rag around his face
[1:26:13] and hit him on the head now if you now
[1:26:15] if you're a prophesy ER see visions
[1:26:17] tells who hit you
[1:26:18] you didn't feel no virtue because he
[1:26:19] didn't believe in the first place both
[1:26:21] both people touched Jesus right one of
[1:26:24] them touched his face another one
[1:26:25] touched in anger and maquis so it
[1:26:28] depends tonight how we want to touch
[1:26:29] Jesus amen
[1:26:31] and I just gave that example now sister
[1:26:34] Karen who got you on Sunday
[1:26:35] she was the one who was agreeing with
[1:26:38] the word the most not that you have to
[1:26:40] be the loudest but she was the one time
[1:26:44] she was stood up and shouted and
[1:26:45] praising God I love the children that or
[1:26:47] not but you did okay but she was just
[1:26:49] pulled out and she was pulling I mean I
[1:26:51] preached two hours and I said there must
[1:26:53] be some people on it by three people
[1:26:54] raised their hand
[1:26:55] where I can hardly stop because there is
[1:26:58] Poland
[1:26:58] um but member my sister uh Marie got
[1:27:02] healed she wasn't loud or anything but I
[1:27:05] remember that service she was staring at
[1:27:07] me the whole time just glued believing
[1:27:09] and just you know in tune with the Holy
[1:27:12] Spirit and she called me the next day
[1:27:14] her and Kevin called me the next day and
[1:27:16] so they she she got healed a man thanked
[1:27:19] the Lord for that now here's a way to
[1:27:23] drive away the presence people can just
[1:27:25] walk away from it because if I was at
[1:27:27] Cain went out from the presence of Lord
[1:27:28] in other words he left the preaching of
[1:27:30] the work he left offerings and what do
[1:27:32] we do here were given our spiritual
[1:27:34] offerings tonight by worse just praising
[1:27:36] you know they can God pray those are all
[1:27:39] sacrifices right because we're kings and
[1:27:41] priests and so when people don't come to
[1:27:44] church people don't worship God or the
[1:27:45] live stream and worship the Lord what
[1:27:48] happens they leave the Friends of God
[1:27:51] right so sometimes sin can drive them
[1:27:53] why other times people just straight out
[1:27:55] sin oh I'm not enough with that they
[1:27:59] leave the Friends of God
[1:28:01] remember Genesis 6 the Bible said you
[1:28:03] know they saw the daughters of men
[1:28:05] discreet God they married women just for
[1:28:07] their looks not for their character and
[1:28:09] that shake he said the Lord said my
[1:28:11] spirit shall not always strive to
[1:28:13] wrestle with man and plead with men for
[1:28:16] that he also has flesh to this day she
[1:28:18] 120 years so see there was come a time
[1:28:21] that the the sin was so great upon the
[1:28:23] earth in the days of Noah that God
[1:28:25] withdrew his spirit he was so grieved he
[1:28:28] would risk your any where he and only
[1:28:30] stayed in the ark amen
[1:28:32] there's one place where you could by
[1:28:33] God's Spirit and that was God's grace
[1:28:36] with no amen the only place on the earth
[1:28:39] at had no anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:41] was in that are in word Christ the ark
[1:28:43] tonight amen
[1:28:45] don't let that stop me I know it's a
[1:28:46] booze virgin tight but brother bad uses
[1:28:48] the art knows art as a type of the bride
[1:28:50] sometimes not all the time but he does
[1:28:53] use it I can show you the only fun that
[1:28:55] priest had before
[1:28:56] no is a type of the foolish virgin but
[1:28:59] he says about the rapture we got to get
[1:29:01] into the ark for the rapture so see it's
[1:29:03] just a type you know
[1:29:04] you just use it as we got to get into
[1:29:06] the baptism of Holy Ghost okay all right
[1:29:09] quit here's our text clench not the
[1:29:12] spirit and quench let me come back to
[1:29:15] this quench means of things on fire to
[1:29:18] be quenched to go out anybody ever seen
[1:29:21] a fire extinguisher I've never even used
[1:29:22] them but I've seen I've seen somebody
[1:29:24] using that's like what that's what
[1:29:27] people do the Holy Spirit they get out
[1:29:28] their spiritual unbelief fire
[1:29:30] extinguishers and they spray down the
[1:29:32] anointing and they they just get upset
[1:29:34] with people that get the spirit and they
[1:29:38] get mad at people that want to worship
[1:29:39] God right
[1:29:40] that's quenching the Holy Spirit to
[1:29:43] stifle let's go back to the scripture
[1:29:47] clench not the spirit so don't spray
[1:29:50] unbelief on the Holy Spirit I'll try to
[1:29:52] put out the Holy Spirit despise not
[1:29:54] prophesized see we should have despised
[1:29:58] people that are trying to pray for
[1:29:59] divine healing or speaking in tongues
[1:30:01] like we had back in February we should
[1:30:03] despise those things we should thank you
[1:30:05] thank God for those things they stood
[1:30:08] through all things kick not in the glass
[1:30:10] so see neglect is a way to drive way the
[1:30:13] spirit as well and that's what we've got
[1:30:17] to be careful for the message because we
[1:30:18] know the truth we have the revelations
[1:30:21] but if we neglect to enter into the
[1:30:23] spirit then it's still driving him away
[1:30:25] I can preach and we can all anybody sign
[1:30:29] of your breach but Brooks anybody and we
[1:30:31] can all say oh we want the movie the
[1:30:32] Holy Spirit but if we neglect to pray
[1:30:35] the mess of the Holy Spirit is just the
[1:30:37] same as driving him away with sin it's
[1:30:39] just neglecting and not entering the
[1:30:41] Holy Spirit so that's another way to
[1:30:45] drive way just just not just not
[1:30:47] entering into the worship not entering
[1:30:48] into the the prayer time it takes to
[1:30:50] have the Holy Spirit amen
[1:30:53] how many one have the Holy Spirit amen
[1:30:55] he is we like to see him use more right
[1:30:58] mota see more now here's the balance
[1:31:02] here's what I told you this has to be
[1:31:04] balanced that because hero program said
[1:31:08] hey brother times closing the Samaritan
[1:31:10] Church age the paragraph 175 so you know
[1:31:12] it's all this towards yet you said while
[1:31:15] we sing this next verse I want you to
[1:31:16] shake hands like you do each night all
[1:31:17] the methods and Baptists and
[1:31:19] Presbyterians shake hands with one
[1:31:20] another and even be furthered up into
[1:31:22] each
[1:31:22] those chewing gum if you can and
[1:31:23] everybody starts laughing startled that
[1:31:26] I just be real real friendly being
[1:31:28] sociable now obviously it I'm one of
[1:31:30] them it's just like a real kind of
[1:31:33] upbeat service so that was okay 175 so
[1:31:38] six paragraphs later that's usually
[1:31:40] about three minutes oh they're going to
[1:31:44] say there's going to be a meeting and
[1:31:47] then there's three tongues
[1:31:49] interpretations program it's all calm
[1:31:51] down he just told a joke about you
[1:31:54] should add Amisha to my chewing gum you
[1:31:56] want my gum brother a menu of my gum and
[1:32:00] everybody's laughing and just with a
[1:32:02] little worship God still please cuz
[1:32:05] what's that joke trying to do is trying
[1:32:07] to loosen the beat whoa and say we need
[1:32:08] to love each other but I probably chew
[1:32:11] you're doing good I don't know if you
[1:32:13] brushed I don't want old gum anybody now
[1:32:19] the next night no this is the same night
[1:32:23] so two paragraphs later they have three
[1:32:26] standing on their feet he said God gave
[1:32:28] a message to each person so three
[1:32:31] messages three people come to the altar
[1:32:33] the next night he said did you notice
[1:32:35] last night the Holy Spirit gave us after
[1:32:36] the service was over see how you can't
[1:32:38] be in a rush to get out what if those
[1:32:40] three would have rushed out all he's
[1:32:41] done preaching let's rush out not doing
[1:32:44] your own I understand you got once once
[1:32:47] a year thing you got to go too
[1:32:48] I understand but if we're constantly
[1:32:51] leaving out church then are people
[1:32:53] really seeking the Holy Ghost or not
[1:32:55] what do you think you know this is after
[1:32:59] the preaching three messages and three
[1:33:03] Souls now I didn't bring the quote up
[1:33:04] here but I can show it to you brother
[1:33:05] Graham said the time after the preaching
[1:33:07] is the climax of the service that is the
[1:33:10] most important time is right after I say
[1:33:13] okay we're done let's sing a little bit
[1:33:14] now most of us you know differ on us
[1:33:17] we'll say okay what song retired
[1:33:20] what's all gonna say I just got to make
[1:33:21] it through this testing a couple more
[1:33:24] songs I'm gone and we all get tired
[1:33:27] right I'm not I'm not condemning anybody
[1:33:29] with anything I'm saying I'm not going
[1:33:31] to condemning anybody tonight I'm just
[1:33:33] saying we got to get out of the flesh
[1:33:35] spirit I love everybody you love me I
[1:33:39] love you we're one happy family
[1:33:41] yeah but we got to recognize his
[1:33:44] presence we got to be sensitive to his
[1:33:46] spirit if the Holy Spirit doesn't move
[1:33:49] it's not his fault it's our fault
[1:33:51] and we want we really need to come to
[1:33:54] grips with that I need to come to grips
[1:33:55] with that three messages three Souls
[1:33:58] just exactly and when the spirits figure
[1:34:00] to come back the last interpretation
[1:34:02] okay I go through that is that not by
[1:34:04] God's grace man he can tell him he can
[1:34:06] tell a gauzy joke and 30 minutes 30
[1:34:09] seconds later the Holy Spirit speaks in
[1:34:11] tongues interpretation
[1:34:12] gourry read see cuz what is it Church
[1:34:16] I'm inside this is the joy of the Lord
[1:34:18] when he tells that joke he's got to joy
[1:34:20] the Lord you should love and love each
[1:34:22] other so much to each other to ego and
[1:34:24] the Holy Ghost moves nobody was quiet
[1:34:28] nobody was Reverend still oh brother
[1:34:31] amen oh god Jesse stop there's nobody it
[1:34:37] was just crazy you know we're happy the
[1:34:39] word streets it's true
[1:34:40] we're behind it and God can minister
[1:34:43] like that hey man the RAM should be
[1:34:52] careful Saint will come along try to run
[1:34:53] you off of the deep end but be sure it's
[1:34:56] the Holy Spirit each time if it's the
[1:34:57] Holy Spirit they'll speak directly to
[1:34:59] something that's going on it's for the
[1:35:01] edification of the church and then if
[1:35:02] you'll be real router with those God
[1:35:04] will give you more so you just keep
[1:35:05] adding more and more that's about gifts
[1:35:07] if we can be right if we can get some
[1:35:08] gifts operating you ought to frequent
[1:35:10] basis that'd be wonderful if not we can
[1:35:12] just wait in between there's no problem
[1:35:14] that we're I'm doing that but if we're
[1:35:19] ever with them which means respectful
[1:35:21] and we follow up on them if we follow up
[1:35:23] on them and make sure they're right and
[1:35:25] confess that they're wrong God will add
[1:35:27] more to us like I said I've never had a
[1:35:30] time where it operates frequently it
[1:35:32] seems like every three or four years
[1:35:34] we'll get a toga or something like that
[1:35:35] or unknown interpretation or something
[1:35:38] like that so we obviously know that the
[1:35:42] gifts are not operating on it on a
[1:35:44] current basis but also we have to say -
[1:35:46] are we praying
[1:35:48] to operate are we are we praying every
[1:35:52] servicemen so see if we don't pray for
[1:35:55] it
[1:35:55] we're not going to get it if you don't
[1:35:58] ask for it
[1:35:59] you're not going to receive it he said
[1:36:01] ask and it shall be given on these
[1:36:02] matter is that out by God's grace I hope
[1:36:05] it helps I'm gonna try to close to this
[1:36:08] Wow okay grace all right um hey let me
[1:36:13] see real quick I thought I had another
[1:36:14] quote after this do I know okay I just
[1:36:20] want to close with this insurance like I
[1:36:23] said you are showing your faithfulness
[1:36:27] tonight and I tell you I appreciate that
[1:36:30] and the people that are really behind it
[1:36:36] if we can get a hold of this I think
[1:36:39] it'll do a lot of force honey
[1:36:42] like for example when I walked into
[1:36:44] Bible believers I would god I got there
[1:36:46] 45 minutes early there was already 10
[1:36:48] people there praying reading their
[1:36:50] Bibles 45 40 minutes before service and
[1:36:54] one of them was assisted they got healed
[1:36:56] and I'm not making a law like that
[1:37:00] asking like that every time but I know
[1:37:02] they're there every circuit sir it's not
[1:37:04] part it was to their children go to
[1:37:05] Sunday school and they have to be there
[1:37:07] 45 not seven but see we had Sunday
[1:37:10] school on for a while but then we no one
[1:37:12] was coming and that's okay I'm not I'm
[1:37:14] not upset with anybody I'm just saying
[1:37:16] if you want the ministry you got to come
[1:37:21] a little earlier amen
[1:37:23] I'm happy to minister to the children in
[1:37:26] Sunday school we've got to make time for
[1:37:28] that it's got to be the number one
[1:37:30] priority right and if we want to see
[1:37:34] more of God moved by the Holy Spirit
[1:37:36] it's got to be our number one priority
[1:37:37] then mm-hmm I'll never forget when John
[1:37:41] and I prayed on a Sunday night we prayed
[1:37:43] for 45 minutes just shouting it was at
[1:37:45] this this this pulpit at Waterloo we
[1:37:50] prayed for miracles and then God said
[1:37:51] probably five or six miracles in that
[1:37:53] year my wife got healed of the migraines
[1:37:57] the brother got different touches I
[1:38:00] can't remember John wrote down one time
[1:38:02] I need to email know ask them about that
[1:38:03] we just kept writing them down because
[1:38:05] we prayed for in just a few months later
[1:38:07] it just starts happening and sometimes I
[1:38:10] forget that you know sometimes we forget
[1:38:12] that so tonight I come here I have a
[1:38:15] meeting after work so I got here 30
[1:38:17] minutes before service and four people
[1:38:19] are already here and I said Laurie you
[1:38:21] know back that's what that's what we'll
[1:38:23] do it you know that's what we'll do it
[1:38:25] where we can enter into God's will and
[1:38:28] not every time does America have to
[1:38:29] happen but let's say like this if God
[1:38:31] speaks to you and you're blessed it's
[1:38:32] kind of like a miracle for you you know
[1:38:34] today it's kind of like an instant God
[1:38:37] did something for me it's kind of a
[1:38:38] revelation for you so I just want to
[1:38:46] make sure I say that I got its grace and
[1:38:49] I've been trying since I cancelled
[1:38:50] Sunday school I've been trying to get
[1:38:51] here 30 or 45 minutes early every Sunday
[1:38:53] morning so I can pray here for half an
[1:38:55] hour I didn't when brother Brooks was
[1:38:57] here excited to get songs ready but
[1:38:59] every other Sunday I was either here or
[1:39:01] in my office on my knees praying for 25
[1:39:04] 30 minutes before serious and if you can
[1:39:06] join me that'd be fantastic but if not I
[1:39:08] want to try to pray and see if we can
[1:39:10] get into that because of this like I
[1:39:15] can't take these folks out of the
[1:39:17] message nor do I want to what I want to
[1:39:21] do is live those ones
[1:39:22] amen but we can't neglect them see so
[1:39:27] and I don't want to make anybody feel
[1:39:29] bad unless it's the Holy Spirit
[1:39:30] convicting them then I don't mind you
[1:39:32] know I don't mind that is this that mean
[1:39:34] that I'm just telling the truth you
[1:39:37] can't get mad at the mailman for the
[1:39:38] mail he brings it's just his job and
[1:39:40] deliver the mail right so if I'm reading
[1:39:43] my bearings mail or gods down from
[1:39:45] around us that's not my fault it's just
[1:39:48] what the word says you know if I got a
[1:39:50] bad attitude and said you bunch of lazy
[1:39:52] Smith's never here 30 minutes now see I
[1:39:56] gotta go overboard got to the flesh
[1:40:00] right Jerry are you bunch of lazy no
[1:40:04] good for nothing Smiths you know I don't
[1:40:05] you see I don't do that trying to be
[1:40:10] gentle because the Holy Spirit is gentle
[1:40:15] unless you reveal good you know really
[1:40:16] hard she like you generation of vipers
[1:40:19] you know but those are for Pharisees
[1:40:22] we're not Pharisees church we've left
[1:40:24] the creams we left the denominations
[1:40:26] we're in the presence of God what I
[1:40:29] tried to just I'm not here to impress
[1:40:31] you I'm here to be God's messenger and
[1:40:33] you're here to be God's servants praise
[1:40:35] God because we want to truly serve the
[1:40:36] Lord so we got to keep that in mind let
[1:40:40] me close to this brother Graham use the
[1:40:41] words of the church anybody remember
[1:40:43] this from Christ mister God revealed
[1:40:45] brother Branham just got done preaching
[1:40:47] the seals like three months before this
[1:40:48] he's go he's leaving Jeffersonville for
[1:40:51] a while and it gives one more word to
[1:40:53] the church before he leaves let's just
[1:40:55] look at it and it's all about reverence
[1:40:56] and keeping the atmosphere holy and all
[1:40:59] these things and loving everybody loving
[1:41:02] everybody like the Bible said number
[1:41:03] tender-hearted you know I remind you the
[1:41:06] children they get care very books on
[1:41:08] library like every Saturday and one of
[1:41:10] the Care Bears is tender hearted there
[1:41:14] he's always so kind you know he's just
[1:41:17] so tender no matter if so he's gloomy
[1:41:19] he's just tender and sweet right he's
[1:41:22] got these got that gift well see that's
[1:41:24] what we need to have not and that's a
[1:41:25] kind of a silly childlike thing but
[1:41:28] that's what the Bible said have tender
[1:41:30] hearts one toward another I should
[1:41:33] always be tender towards each one right
[1:41:35] should be tender towards my children I
[1:41:38] should be tender towards my wife because
[1:41:41] that's what the Bible says all right I
[1:41:45] want you to remember that brother devil
[1:41:47] year left in the church and charge this
[1:41:48] Tabernacle see I'm in charge of this
[1:41:49] church I'm not claiming to be a good
[1:41:51] leader Church I'm just trying to follow
[1:41:52] the Holy Spirit if I ever make a mistake
[1:41:55] just come tell me about it now be tender
[1:41:57] hearted under the Holy Spirit see the
[1:42:01] pre pastors always under the Holy Spirit
[1:42:03] not about under and either is left here
[1:42:05] and he believes the message who teaches
[1:42:07] it just as same as I do right and
[1:42:10] anytime that you want to you can see if
[1:42:12] it to come here brother devil you
[1:42:13] certainly do you good I'm sure he's a
[1:42:14] great servant of Jesus Christ right
[1:42:18] I know Norman devil since I was a little
[1:42:20] boy he hasn't changed one speck only got
[1:42:22] closer to God
[1:42:23] I remember when I first saw now somebody
[1:42:25] chose Methodist platform when I come
[1:42:26] back to Tabernacle
[1:42:28] someday I'll baptize him in the name of
[1:42:29] Jesus Christ and here is the message
[1:42:31] that I'm going on a real Gallic servant
[1:42:33] he promised I'd and brother devil goes
[1:42:36] through many strains and heartaches that
[1:42:38] he doesn't show here at the Tabernacle
[1:42:40] but being that the Lord lets me have a
[1:42:42] little sight into people's life I know
[1:42:44] when he goes through a whole lot of it
[1:42:46] see and he certainly goes under a lot of
[1:42:48] Labour and strains and things and you
[1:42:50] you people here hold him up like Joshua
[1:42:53] and Caleb held up the hands of Moses as
[1:42:57] he's great in the word so if you pray
[1:43:00] for me that will help me out just pray
[1:43:02] for me that will be holding up the hands
[1:43:04] for victory now here's where it gets
[1:43:06] into it love one of the what's the
[1:43:08] greatest force in the universe divine
[1:43:10] love what's the Holy Ghost love what is
[1:43:13] God God is love above everything love
[1:43:18] one another no matter what the devil
[1:43:21] tries to say now you're all one great
[1:43:23] big sweet group now but remember by
[1:43:25] morning see Satan won't let that stay
[1:43:27] that way
[1:43:28] a church I said this before just give me
[1:43:31] have patience with me last year this
[1:43:34] time an officer last year in April I
[1:43:37] told my wife out loud night I gotta be
[1:43:39] careful when I say out loud I told my
[1:43:40] wife I said this is the happiest I've
[1:43:42] ever been as a pastor and the very next
[1:43:46] week or two we had a family leave the
[1:43:48] church and disagree with some doctrine
[1:43:49] which is five and now since a year then
[1:43:53] we've had three more families leave plus
[1:43:55] two young men leave so what am I saying
[1:44:00] I was at the big sweet group honeymoon
[1:44:03] Tyler I'm half so happy everybody's
[1:44:06] enjoying the preaching but brother Adam
[1:44:09] said but remember my warning see Satan
[1:44:11] won't let that stay that way I
[1:44:13] understand that
[1:44:14] I'm understand you go through seasons of
[1:44:15] life churches go through seasons what
[1:44:18] seasons of happiness and mountaintops
[1:44:19] and everybody's on fire but then you got
[1:44:23] to go down and you got to be tested and
[1:44:26] try every Son of God must be chasing a
[1:44:29] mat so now I got to be able to say that
[1:44:33] people even disagree with me or don't
[1:44:35] like me what I gotta say love you anyway
[1:44:37] because my love for God and you is not
[1:44:40] depending on how many
[1:44:41] people here paint eyes my love for God
[1:44:44] is dependent upon nothing it's just my
[1:44:46] love for it hey I just got a love hint
[1:44:51] see you can't always keep the revival
[1:44:54] Satan attack the early church around the
[1:44:55] booking Baxter said Murphy had more
[1:44:57] martyrs all these things they had to
[1:44:58] flee their homes and spread
[1:45:00] they got driven out of Jerusalem member
[1:45:01] that and uh in a nice inspire I did not
[1:45:04] in a nice them is whatever that over me
[1:45:07] they got driven out of Jerusalem they
[1:45:10] kicked all the Christians out see God
[1:45:13] allows seasons no sir he'll shoot
[1:45:16] everything if he has to bring somebody
[1:45:18] in to make it started so my dad tells at
[1:45:21] some point after the happiness stage
[1:45:23] Satan's going to eject somebody with
[1:45:25] poison which is unbelief or sin it will
[1:45:31] bring some critic or unbeliever and sit
[1:45:33] him down and causing the fellowship with
[1:45:35] you under the Quietus that they seek
[1:45:36] they'll sit there for a while and just
[1:45:38] be real quiet and you'll get to trust
[1:45:39] somebody and then he'll shoot that guy
[1:45:42] with some kind of a poison stuff and
[1:45:44] it'll start through the church with it
[1:45:45] in other words somebody's going to get
[1:45:47] it evil anointing or maybe some people
[1:45:51] maybe many people and it's going to try
[1:45:53] to infect the church like a cancer but
[1:45:57] what overcomes it love don't you take
[1:46:02] sides of this so when someone starts
[1:46:03] accusing a met or atom or me or some of
[1:46:06] our sisters will protested this and this
[1:46:08] don't take sides of them you say I don't
[1:46:11] know don't have nothing to do with
[1:46:13] anything else you just stay loving and
[1:46:16] sweet and kind to one another Anna
[1:46:19] see because now you're pleasing the Holy
[1:46:21] Spirit cuz the Holy Spirit's tipping
[1:46:22] right he says it if you got a bad
[1:46:25] attitude or if you're upset or something
[1:46:27] like that or if you're fearful or scared
[1:46:29] or something he sets them to that pray
[1:46:33] for that man or woman that he'll be
[1:46:35] saved to of that woman or whether it is
[1:46:37] just pray for that hand stick with one
[1:46:39] another see when the problem comes don't
[1:46:42] leave the church yeah unless God tells
[1:46:44] you to you know but if you don't tell
[1:46:47] you don't leave you stick with everybody
[1:46:48] love you each other because every church
[1:46:51] goes through struggles how many know
[1:46:52] that and
[1:46:55] stay with your pastor please stay with
[1:47:00] me if you feel that it alone
[1:47:01] stay with your past and see he's the
[1:47:03] Shepherd at you give him respect
[1:47:04] everybody here respects me so well my
[1:47:06] proceed he'll lead you through because
[1:47:11] he's ordained of God to do so he's God
[1:47:15] now do you remember that car Gatien said
[1:47:17] Amen the enemy will come look he's
[1:47:19] telling them he's warning them you're
[1:47:20] all happy now
[1:47:21] just preach the CEOs he dug all these
[1:47:23] revelations but let me warn you Satan's
[1:47:25] going to come and when he does just
[1:47:28] clean that much closer together and
[1:47:31] that's again like that's why I like to
[1:47:34] do two services on Sunday
[1:47:35] it just gives us a little more time
[1:47:36] together Church and if we can talk
[1:47:39] between services or talk after it's just
[1:47:42] so important just to be around each
[1:47:44] other how many understand that amen
[1:47:46] if you miss church and you're sick or
[1:47:48] something how do you feel you feel sad
[1:47:50] you feel just disconnected right you
[1:47:55] don't feel like I love these people mind
[1:47:57] they love me and we're just a happy
[1:47:59] family in Christ Jesus you know things
[1:48:00] are looking up crisis with us you know
[1:48:02] we lose that connection and the one that
[1:48:07] the devil is using for enemy will either
[1:48:09] get out because you just love it about
[1:48:11] or to come in and be one of you hey man
[1:48:16] what are the other the love of God will
[1:48:18] either overpower that person to
[1:48:19] repentance or drive away and we don't I
[1:48:23] don't even we don't care about numbers
[1:48:24] if if someone doesn't want to love God
[1:48:27] it doesn't a lot of people here it's
[1:48:28] better that they go I'd rather have six
[1:48:32] adults here on a Wednesday night that
[1:48:33] all love God then they have 10 12 50 50
[1:48:36] that are all argued and busted and upset
[1:48:38] all these things like that
[1:48:39] we just want God's Spirit in them don't
[1:48:42] even care about the numbers I appreciate
[1:48:44] fewer than this when I told me one time
[1:48:48] it was just pay and mean with the old
[1:48:50] adults here one night back at Waterloo
[1:48:52] we're the only ones I'm not sure what
[1:48:54] might have been on Thursday night
[1:48:55] remember and Bay took Malachi to the
[1:48:58] restroom with Lydia and I think Acacia
[1:49:00] too and I was preaching to the phone
[1:49:03] only sister Kathy was a phone streaming
[1:49:05] us and so there's no word of that little
[1:49:07] church and up
[1:49:13] you know I preach this as hard as I
[1:49:15] would tonight minutes grain because you
[1:49:18] know what if the world will to shove me
[1:49:20] that's fine but I know one person who's
[1:49:22] not shutting me I know one person who's
[1:49:24] watching me and that's Christ he wants
[1:49:27] to see how I act in the good times and
[1:49:29] the bad times and we cleaned together no
[1:49:31] matter what happens no matter what
[1:49:33] troubles come our way we just clean that
[1:49:35] much more to get a don't never clan
[1:49:39] above you or make yourself pledge well
[1:49:41] I'm only fell tripping with Adam between
[1:49:43] services nobody else that's clannish
[1:49:47] right we're one I couldn't say left hand
[1:49:52] I'm mad at you I'm going to take you
[1:49:54] away because you're not my right hand
[1:49:55] he's my left hand I wanted to stay there
[1:49:56] even though the tip of my finger I want
[1:49:58] to stay right there every part of my
[1:49:59] body stay right there and God wants us
[1:50:00] as a body believers sustained right
[1:50:02] exactly one another riot at with one
[1:50:04] another and now you got facial notice
[1:50:07] comes your size you've got tapes on what
[1:50:10] we believe you got tapes on this for the
[1:50:11] church how we behave ourselves the
[1:50:13] Church of God how we got to come here
[1:50:15] together and sit together in heavenly
[1:50:17] places don't stay at home if that's a
[1:50:21] big if right there if God is in your
[1:50:24] heart you can't hardly wait for the
[1:50:28] doors to open up yeah man thank you
[1:50:32] Jesus yeah let's big if now this heart
[1:50:37] can mean your mind right because you get
[1:50:38] a Holy Ghost filled people that
[1:50:39] backslide and they might not want to
[1:50:41] come to church I've seen it probably
[1:50:42] five or six times they just go through
[1:50:45] trials you know it's we got to pray for
[1:50:47] them
[1:50:48] but God if their Holy Ghost field they
[1:50:49] always come back a man God's in your
[1:50:53] heart you can't hardly wait for the
[1:50:55] doors to open up yonder to get here to
[1:50:56] fellowship with your brothers see I
[1:50:59] can't wait to see amen
[1:51:00] I can't wait to see Adam and our sisters
[1:51:02] you know I like hugging the brother
[1:51:04] Christy I just I like that they're my
[1:51:06] brothers you know yeah we're just you
[1:51:08] know right now we're together and we all
[1:51:09] we love each other I can't wait to see
[1:51:12] them here Church if you don't feel that
[1:51:16] way I'll tell you this time you got to
[1:51:18] pray if you don't want to get their
[1:51:20] sisters and hug each other's neck
[1:51:22] your brothers don't hug each other's
[1:51:24] necks something's wrong with you
[1:51:25] because we are body because we're
[1:51:30] Madison now gives the scriptural backing
[1:51:31] these two scriptures because we're in
[1:51:33] the last days the Bible absorb as much
[1:51:35] more as we see that they approaching so
[1:51:37] the Bible says we must gather more as we
[1:51:40] see the Day approaching that's why I'm
[1:51:42] not going to cancel many Sunday night
[1:51:43] services although it wears me up but the
[1:51:46] Bible said we got to come together more
[1:51:47] and I a church I know I'll tell you if I
[1:51:51] don't have church on Sunday night and
[1:51:53] I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm
[1:51:53] gonna get it tired or discouraged and
[1:51:55] I'm going to go home and start mowing
[1:51:56] and work it around because I just I get
[1:51:58] tired and discouraged and I know myself
[1:52:00] I'm going workaholic sometimes and I get
[1:52:03] so stressed out I'll get less sleep I
[1:52:05] can't fall asleep at night I'll get a 5
[1:52:07] even before my alarm goes off and I get
[1:52:11] sick because I get stressed out and want
[1:52:13] to work too much in not doing enough for
[1:52:15] God and I'm condemning myself I've got
[1:52:17] to just devote that whole day to God and
[1:52:19] it helps my walk with the Lord
[1:52:22] that's just my testimony you know that's
[1:52:24] my battle so we got to come together
[1:52:27] with one another in Christian love and
[1:52:29] divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:52:30] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:52:32] Jesus and love one another this this
[1:52:34] will all men know you're my disciples
[1:52:36] when you have love for another so
[1:52:37] brother connects that scripture to
[1:52:40] coming to church the way to know we love
[1:52:43] each other is that we come to be with
[1:52:44] each other amen and worship God stay
[1:52:48] right together so see why does every
[1:52:52] understand why hammers so much on church
[1:52:54] attendance now maybe it might have seen
[1:52:56] hammer into you but to me I feel like I
[1:52:57] just got it does it right understand
[1:52:59] down brother Graham says if we don't do
[1:53:01] this Satan's going to get in whatever
[1:53:04] with the spirit of Rome is divide and
[1:53:06] conquer what's the easiest way to divide
[1:53:07] us well we never we live so far away we
[1:53:09] don't we never see each other during the
[1:53:11] week the easiest ways to get us not come
[1:53:13] to church right like with our the two
[1:53:17] brothers we bless their hearts but they
[1:53:19] fall away
[1:53:20] they don't come to church and they don't
[1:53:22] rule some of them won't return my texts
[1:53:24] isn't my text on Z what's the first
[1:53:26] thing they don't come to church you see
[1:53:30] because this is where the Holy Spirit is
[1:53:33] preached this is where the Holy Ghost
[1:53:35] can wash
[1:53:36] clean amen and they don't want to be
[1:53:38] clean because of whatever maybe it's
[1:53:41] gilding they're ashamed ourselves or
[1:53:43] maybe they're just loving sin I don't
[1:53:44] know but that's what the Prophet tells
[1:53:47] us if the brother you think he's little
[1:53:49] wrong or sister say Lord don't let me
[1:53:52] never have the root of bitterness
[1:53:53] springing up because it will affect him
[1:53:56] and it will take the Christ right out of
[1:53:59] my life if you get bitter with somebody
[1:54:02] will take the Holy Spirit right out of
[1:54:03] your life now poison acids of malice and
[1:54:07] jealousy and hatred will just take the
[1:54:11] Holy Spirit right away from you it will
[1:54:14] run in from the tabernacle here it'll
[1:54:16] kill the Spirit of God look how Bible
[1:54:18] uses that it will grieve him so much
[1:54:20] it'll drive it away it'll hurt your
[1:54:22] pastor Oh Lord it'll do everything see
[1:54:27] don't you do that now what I did is I
[1:54:30] cut off that quote malice is ill-will a
[1:54:34] desire to enter somebody well I just
[1:54:36] can't wait to get back at them I'm going
[1:54:38] to give them a piece of my mind I'm
[1:54:39] really going to show them what that's
[1:54:42] for spring it's 5:8
[1:54:43] jealousy is edgiest you believe they
[1:54:45] have a they'll they have that better
[1:54:47] than a how to do well the pastor he does
[1:54:50] this better than I do it and this is the
[1:54:52] sister and that brother has it better
[1:54:53] than I do they get jealous well they can
[1:54:56] treat it better than I do
[1:54:59] hatred hatred is extreme dislike or
[1:55:02] disgust even message churches see that's
[1:55:06] Galatians fighting we got to get rid of
[1:55:08] that because of hatred well if you have
[1:55:10] that and don't know confess it you want
[1:55:12] to hear the kingdom of God this is the
[1:55:16] last month let's say Murphy well Graham
[1:55:19] said you just wax that much closer
[1:55:21] together draw up take the buckle that
[1:55:24] something's about the armor of God as
[1:55:26] the brother testify the minister here
[1:55:28] the other night just about having a
[1:55:30] buckle see the buckles on the whole
[1:55:32] armor of God just call her on Tiger I
[1:55:34] move up right close to another love one
[1:55:35] another anyhow talk nice about one
[1:55:38] another say nice things about one
[1:55:40] another and then God will bless you the
[1:55:43] other Lord tonight amen
[1:55:45] did that help you to see how a sense it
[1:55:47] we must be the holy spirit
[1:55:49] a Sunday Lord willing at the morning
[1:55:52] service I'm going to take this thought
[1:55:55] and kind of go with a little more just
[1:55:57] kind of remind the church you know you
[1:55:59] want to see the Spirit of God once
[1:56:01] you're fully committed I bring some of
[1:56:02] these back I might bring some more
[1:56:04] different things along these same lines
[1:56:06] if you want to see more of God we need
[1:56:08] somebody man we need people that are
[1:56:10] going to be devoted to a man and I've
[1:56:13] been open to this to church let me say
[1:56:14] this if eleven is the earliest we can
[1:56:17] get here then we can just pray from
[1:56:20] 11:00 11:30
[1:56:21] I've open to that - I don't want to
[1:56:24] scoot anybody that wants to see God so I
[1:56:30] want to make that known as well maybe
[1:56:32] pray 15 minutes or whatever I want to
[1:56:34] make that known but the thing we got to
[1:56:36] do is if you want to see more of God if
[1:56:37] we want the Holy Spirit we got to have
[1:56:39] favor with it how do you have favorite
[1:56:41] it if that song you sent a man seeking
[1:56:43] love him worship Him
[1:56:47] that's how we get favored with the Holy
[1:56:49] Spirit
[1:56:50] that's prayer that's through contacting
[1:56:54] God so hope this is okay even you have a
[1:56:57] song missing but something like that by
[1:57:00] God's grace while he's coming let's just
[1:57:05] our heads for where to prayer here
[1:57:06] tonight yeah miss for children so let me
[1:57:10] switch over al Qaeda thank you sir
[1:57:12] thanks remind everybody appreciate it
[1:57:15] the only father Lord we love you Lord
[1:57:19] we're thankful for this word we don't
[1:57:22] want to offend the Holy Spirit we know
[1:57:24] we will at certain times but Lord you're
[1:57:26] quick to forgive you're so quick to be
[1:57:29] merciful your Bible says you're rich in
[1:57:31] mercy but nor we know it will be a
[1:57:35] battle to crucify our flesh and to get
[1:57:38] out of the flesh and into the spirit or
[1:57:40] we just want to see a church lower where
[1:57:42] we see more of you
[1:57:43] and Lord it's going to just going to
[1:57:45] take a little more sacrifice it's going
[1:57:47] to take a little bit more love it's
[1:57:50] going to take a little more your God
[1:57:51] than what we have Lord God
[1:57:53] so we ask Lord you to anoint us Noren as
[1:57:56] we yield to your Lord God we ask that we
[1:58:01] could catch a vision
[1:58:02] this Lord the hardest thing there is to
[1:58:07] do in order to create this atmosphere
[1:58:09] but with God all things are possible
[1:58:12] with you Jesus it's possible the Lord as
[1:58:18] your prophet said we don't want to be in
[1:58:19] a rush you'd only be moving around Lord
[1:58:21] and I believe our church is one of the
[1:58:23] very Reverend Church or the mothers are
[1:58:25] so good with the children to get them
[1:58:26] out right away are other Saints that
[1:58:29] don't have a little children are just so
[1:58:30] faithful and so reverent dear God now

[1:58:36] of us that's where we need all help to
[1:58:38] get rid of any mind battles dear God
[1:58:41] thankful for the church's efforts

[1:58:45] all the time dear God I want a better
[1:58:48] effort or God Lord these are not just
[1:58:54] prayers but they're from my heart
[1:58:57] not just filling up toddler or straight

[1:59:06] let love bind us together Lord God your
[1:59:14] prophet said whoever has God has the
[1:59:17] majority whether it's one man or one
[1:59:18] hundred we can have the majority we know
[1:59:22] you're not interested in numbers Lord
[1:59:24] God help us not to be interested in
[1:59:26] numbers help us to be interested in
[1:59:28] faith worship reverence love grace will
[1:59:36] be installed
[1:59:40] may these be the seeds more that come to
[1:59:43] fruition we can see the Holy Spirit
[1:59:45] continue to move whatever now then you
[1:59:48] do something wonderful we appreciate
[1:59:50] that in between you're teaching us
