there but woo 47's coming that I'm turning all the High singing over to these ones over here amen if you want to know where that High singing came from just look at that pretty little lady right there when her hair was like my beard you know she could crack glass too but amen we lots of preaching lot of my on The Voice amen and so anyways we thank the Lord we're so happy I like I want to hit the big note not to show off because that's how much I love him I really want to put it out there Amen Let Jesus know give you my best amen amen so we we love the Lord now if you have your Bible this morning we're going to turn to just a just a maybe one or two places amen just for the reading this morning of the scripture and um how many loves your Bible say amen I just love the word of God there's strength in it friends whether or not we realize it there is strength in the word of the Lord and um I want to talk if the God if if if the Lord will help us this morning if God will help us this morning I want to try to speak to you upon the benefits of like worship and Thanksgiving and praise and these kind of things and um you know and I'm going to say this while you're getting ready to turn with me I'm just I'm just lining up a few things here because I got a lot of hay on this Fork today let me tell you that right now but um we we you know we we understand that churches today I'm talking about message churches have really lost I think in so many ways the real meaning and the benefits of what it means to be worshippers and uh in my personal and humble opinion I think what we need more now than we've ever needed is we need the worship of the Lord in our midst and friends I'm just going to be real real honest with you and just say it like this there's a lot of people that just simply don't understand what it means to be worshippers they just don't understand it nor do I think they have a real good understanding of what it means for us as Christians to be worshippers I think a lot of folks feel like worship is just what you do here like this and Hallelujah and praise the Lord and you know or some kind of a thing but we'll find out today worship is a whole lot more than that there's a deeper meaning to all of it and uh once again we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord now uh Philippians chapter 4 let's start there in verse four four five and six we're going to read those three verses together and then we'll um we'll we'll we'll hop over to Colossians chapter 2 vers seven for just a moment and um what a privilege it is to be back in God's house we're so grateful to the Lord for the things that you know that God does for us and and appreciate my girls and somebody asked me did my oldest one sing I said she does but right now she just grins amen and so we're we're working on her amen and uh and uh but she's a good singer I'd like to see her get up and do some more singing she's a real good singer got a pretty voice you pray that the Lord just give her that you know and she can get up here and do it with us you know and and uh we we uh we like to see her in the service of the Lord and uh I thought anise done a great job didn't you think she did a good job she's a good singer she's a good little singer and I this one I here sings herself to sleep still you know here she is almost 15 years old and she'll I hear in the room singing you know and going to sleep and so amen it comes from an honest side of the things you I mean we had all kinds of singers in our family every which way and uh even on her mama's side you know the I always said it jokingly I said Grandma was a singer and that's on both our sides and then you know of course um mom's a singer on both sides of it and I said then they had a sewing machine at home and it was a singer amen it's about right ain't it all right Philippians chapter 4:4 rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice notice he said it twice and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God did he say everything look at your Bible again did he say everything in everything bad good positive negative up down left right in out everything by prayer supplication with Thanksgiving when we learn this lesson right here even when things are going bad we'll learn how to Worship the Lord in the right way because go worship doesn't come just when you feel good to worship right worship is something that comes even deeper than that all right now let's hop over to Colossians chapter 2 verse 7 that's I guess an evangelist term hop over amen pastors would have you walk over sturdily stain sanely you know steadily evangels are going to have you hop amen hallelujah all right and then looking at Colossians 2:7 now here here's where I'm talking about worship is not just the emotional output of it Paul says it like this rooted and build up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught notice that as you have been taught so these things have to be modeled somebody has to model right worship before you now there's an element of your Holy Ghost and your birth that's going to put it in you but it also has to be modeled in you especially when you start coming toward maturity because worship also includes the gifts and include Supernatural things dreams visitations all those things and those are the categories of Supernatural that have to be instructed you need instruction on how to handle if the Lord was to appear to you by the way of an angel you have to be instructed by Godly men understanding uh the the revelation of the day and things like that not just any old Fly by Night on YouTube but you have to understand or some other social media or website for that matter but you got to understand by Godly men that are inspired by the truth of the hour and understand the emphasis of the hour how to place those things and we don't want to be guilty in any way whatsoever of just accepting all kinds of worship and Supernatural things without being established established and being taught correctly by Faithful Men and then watch as you have been taught which what he says abounding therein abounding see that word now how why is it so many people come to church less barely hardly able to get to hands up if we've been taught correctly we should be abounding therein with Thanksgiving amen yeah three amens two ey blinks and all right I guess we going to start sticky huh well that's okay that's all right I uh I I know I already you're probably under a little bit of conviction so here's what you do you just say Lord forgive me help me straighten me out get me right don't sit there and beat yourself up all service now all right let's pray together over the word father thank you for this opportunity to open thy Bible to be able to Bow our heads over the truth of Thy word We Want to Thank You Lord For All Things We Appreciate You Lord Jesus for what you've done in the service thus far speak to us now in the remainder God may you anoint me Lord as your son your servant Lord to be able to get myself out of the way anoint them that they might be able to receive that which you want to speak to us and strengthen us Lord for the purpose of God today whatever you'd want us to do we want to follow that pathway whatever you want to lead me to say Lord I'm here to respond to whatever you want Lord and that's what's in our hearts today for your people whatever you would want to say now Lord we pray that the Holy Ghost will not only anoint us but set us free from every wrong Idol thing from this world forgive us and wash us of any little thing Lord that might set us back or beset us today just keep us clean Lord our hands and our feet and our minds clean that we can serve you to the best of our abilities and for the abundance of it we give you Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen amen well that was a pretty good amen for how we started there all right you may be seated may the Lord bless you I um I I I like to see the worship of the Lord now now this may sound like one of these sermons where my goal is to get yall hyped up and running and shouting before the end of the service now listen number one as message people we have moved Beyond modern day Pentecost I believe in true worship of God I believe in being emotional it's all right I believe in being loud but also believe in being quiet and I also believe in being medium and I believe in being low gear high gear third gear second gear and all the other years AG go with it the only difference between what I would probably say Amen to your opinion on something like that is if you'd say well I'm just a quiet person and God in heaven knowing the only reason you're saying that is because you're make an excuse not to be a loud one that's probably the only place we'd ever butt heads on that Doctrine right there so if you're not giving your best to the Lord all right then we got a problem now I'm going to have to preach on you and get on you a little bit by the word or brother Jesse or some Minister you know but if it's just that maybe that you are in the worship of the Lord and deeply in sincerity in the service of God and you're following the Lord and I mean when we come to church we want to be as reverent to that anointing as we know how that's the reason why brother Bram told us when we come in the house of God like this we don't pass notes between one another and talk to one another and you know and uh sit around chewing gum and looking at the ceiling and thumbing through Psalm books we used to have Psalm books where they used to do that in my day I'm Tell it on myself a little bit and uh you know running in and out through the back and things like that and just barely paying attention but that's the reason why brother BM said especially young people sitting here my own girls included brother B said if you want to be the kind of person in the service of God in the future when you get older he said behave it like this right here now he said and train yourself in other words to know how to act and behave and how to be sensitive to the spirit that's the reason why we don't come to church and sleep and we don't come to church and just kind of zone out do your best to pay attention and focus on the things that need to be said why because we don't come here for just no generalized purpose at all we're here to learn how as Paul said here to be established to be placed and positioned and for the word of the Lord to show us how God's purpose can work in our lives ever what that purpose may be might be to a housewife might be to a farmer factory worker might be a preacher who knows amen or a musician or whatever God may call that's why we want to be so reverent to those things because every time we come to church if we're looking for it and our cup is empty and open we know the Holy Spirit somehow will fill it up with Revelation and understanding especially if you're hungry they that are hungry and thirst amen he said they shall be filled ain't that right now I believe with all of my heart that if we are the kind of people that we need to be now this is my feeling I feel like as a message kid raised on the Pew just like y'all are amen I feel like that I had to be broken free and set free from a lot of message tradition that followed the traditions of elders and people that had established churches now I was never a part of Pentecost per se I was never a part of apostolic now Mom and Dad them came from the apostolic move when the message came back in the 60s and it hit Southern Ohio down there amen and uh a lot of the movements of course around this state that was birthed from those tent revivals down there that's what put a lot of these churches on the map outside of brother Brown and them over in Lima and brother da and them that followed brother brandom most of them churches were kind of burgeoned and uh grown from uh the meetings that we had in Southern Ohio down there in Dayton amen when a Fell's gone now by the name of Billy Andrews came set up a tent in the middle of Dayton farmers market and started preaching amen serpent seed and different things like that the coming of Elijah amen many folks left out of those movements and Then followed over into the message churches but here's the problem just like in our church our area and our state amen like all these other places around the message they may have came out of apostolic and they may came out of Baptist and out of Pentecost and these other things like that but Pentecost Methodist Baptist and all the rest didn't come out of them and they just carried that brother Jesse right on into the message of the hour and listen friends even us messaged kids that have been tailored to believe in certain manners listen and I say this respectfully of course because I'm up here preaching just like brother Jesse would but whether it be your father or your pastor or it be brother Ben or somebody like that no matter if you've heard it all your life you are Duty Bound by God be it my young girl sitting here like this or your family or your your brother your sister we are Duty bound to go back in this old Bible right here and search out our own salvation with fear and trembling amen do you believe that we got to know for ourselves because this is not a mama had it Daddy had it therefore I got it this is I've got to get it by the same faith that Mom and Dad had and if they believe the Lord like that I got to believe the Lord just the same way and to be established in the word we have to be exposed to right Godly Ministries friends I can't understand and this is something that I just cannot get my mind wrapped around how in the world people expect to be ready for the Rapture and the and the resurrection and the coming of the Lord Jesus where these bodies are going to be changed and when we pulled out of here amen they never go to church they hate preachers they're not interested in reading the Bible they got their mind on football and everything else in the world rather than on what they can do to become the kind of people before the Lord that they need to become amen and let me tell you if you're not concerned you'll never be convinced amen if you don't have a heart to want to know God will never reveal it to you cuz if you don't care God can't care you tie up the hands of deity himself he cannot show you concern and care and Revelation if in your heart you could care less what's going on today or tomorrow or whenever amen but if we will open our heart and say Lord Jesus establish me Lord set my feet Where I Belong help me know what is right is it going to be a battle brother Ben you better believe it's going to be a battle amen but if the Lord before us God before us tell me who can be against us amen with the Lord on our side we are sure to overcome oh I love that can can you say Amen to that I love that amen abiding in the faith notice again Paul said it rooted and built up in him in other words established not just upon a rocky Foundation or a rocky understanding or some little uh fellas stand in the pull pit and take the message like it's a ditch amen you know some people treat brother Brandon and the message like it's power windows amen you go to buy a car they ask you what options do you want power windows you want Bluetooth what do you want want and they treat brother bam in a message of the hour like his power wind is like it's optional amen but if you want to be bride if you want to go out of here in a Rapture brother bam was not sent to this generation amen for you to lean to the Baptist the Methodist the Presbyterian and still make the Rapture he was sent to procall and prepare a bride to get out of here to seow the root so the bride could have a word foundation amen not only to se her back into the Bible but to open up the Mysteries and the secrets of that Bible so we would know the things that need to be known now just like the critics many times will say now well brother brandham he just kind of preached along with Lin and some of those things and friends what they don't understand and can understand God won't permit it unless he opens their eyes amen all they reading is what was on the outside of the book remember when the scroll was sealed up brother Jesse Amen on the backside it said white horse rider and all those other things was wrote on the back side of the book amen anybody could read Lin or these other guys and understand and parallel what's on the back side of the book but the rear Revelation is contained not on the backside but on the inside of the book amen that's what tells me my purpose and where I belong in all of this and what my role is before the Holy Ghost amen those are the things that people will fail to understand they hear Brother bam preach and they think well he's just copying brother Bosworth or he just said what somebody else said but that's not the real revelation of it that's only the outside of the book amen when I preach preach to you I'm copycatting what Paul said amen I'm going to copycat what Peter said I don't come with my own message amen I'm going to preaching in a generalized way but the root and the instruction is when it's a revelation how do I fit into all of this preaching amen because there's been a lot of preaching done for 2,000 years amen this same Bible has been in the hands and the possession of humankind for the last 2,000 years amen but if you don't see your part in this Revelation this right here don't mean nothing to you Calvary is no benefit the message is no benefit a prophet is no benefit a pastor is worthless to you unless you can see the Revelation amen but when God opens up your eyes then you can see what's on the inside of it amen he talked about breeding between the lines that's what I'm talking about this morning being able to go right in between the lines amen right into the scripture to be able to see my part and my place in the kingdom of God rooted up build up in him established in the faith not just a faith not just any old Faith but the faith the faith that was once delivered to the apostles remember that's Elijah's Mission Amen to restore their hearts back to the original faith of the fathers and he said that cannot literally turn your heart amen he took those seven unknown Thunders to sound out Amen to literally turn our hearts back to the true Apostolic Faith amen and what was the seven Thunders amen it was nothing more than the voices of God coming to brother brandham and revealing to him all of those secret things that had been hid down through those ages Amen in other words Martin Luther said the just shall live by faith he only had a portion of it amen real justification isn't just being forgiven of your sins isn't just believing in Christ but real justification is to have your slate white as though there never was a slate in the beginning that's that's what that word opened up to us brother it's more than just a Greek word or something used out of the Bible but it is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ to you amen and when you can see it in that capacity you can understand who you are that's what's contained on the inside of the Scrolls Hallelujah that on the outside any dummy could put that together to some extent amen many of these things smart guys could prob about it and some of the most ignorant people in the world could understand serpent seed you don't need a degree to be able to understand that anybody with common understanding can read Matthew 28:19 and see it says name and not titles don't even take a revelation for some of these things that brother is just the outside of the book amen but the inside the root the thing you don't see that's the revelation of who it is and that's what brother Brenham came to to bring to us an understanding that would root us Amen in the spoken word rual c said that Billy Graham and or Roberts swed seeds you know what happens after seeds are swn they sprout Roots he said but the word has also been sown the eom unical has been sown that or Roberts group out there that charismatic group or somebody in Texas has got back trouble there all kinds of people in Texas got back trouble amen that that that real scholarly Man Billy Graham group where they just every word and salvation and Altra calls and that kind of thing all of that has been sown and it's brought forth fruits but he said the word has also been sown amen the Revelation has also been sown and that Revelation brings us to the roots of who we are CU remember Malachi 4 restoring our hearts back was part of Joel 2 I'm preparing a message right now I'm not through it just yet but I've been looking at some things about God's Heritage you know go back to 1962 we restoration of the brid tree brother man pulls it in through Joel 2 how that all that the pommer worm the cankerworm the Locust and the caterpillar had ate off he said it ate it all the way down to the ground amen and he said but yet it was God's Heritage God's inheritance was laying in the ground you know them four bugs it's just one big bug and all these different stages this one devil all the way through it amen and that one devil ate them all the way down to the ground took their Fellowship took their power took their anointing took everything but there's one thing he couldn't touch the root hallelujah amen it reminds me it puts me in mind of Samson amen when Delila wooed him into her lap amen and she tied him up amen and he picked the gates up on his shoulders and on and on and on until he revealed his secret to her you see he revealed The Secret of what the power was and the power was if he cut his hair he would become as a normal man but you see God predestines in a way that no matter what you reveal or what you let out accidentally or on purpose or what mistake you might make yes she could touch his hair the Philistines could take his hair they could put his eyes out but they couldn't touch the root underneath that skin amen and how hallelujah amen cuz after a while grinding at the Mill amen out there blind as a bat amen going round and round and round the prophet of God said he reached up and felt that hair growing back out brother that tells me no matter what kind of thing you fall into amen Satan May trap you into all kinds of messes and nonsense amen I like what a brother said last week amen down in South Ohio I was preaching down there and when I finished he made a statement that I just absolutely love and he he said remember Saints your mistakes are not Eternal hallelujah amen no matter what the devil might trap you into he can touch everything but he can't touch the root hallelujah hallelujah he can take your pride and take all of these things and lower you right down on your face until you ain't proud of nothing in your life but it can't touch that root that true seed that's been sown in there amen was swn by God I didn't put it in there I didn't ask for it it wasn't my choice amen all I do is I stay faithful to stay out of the lap of dilas Amen I try to stay faithful and do the god job that God called me to do but if they was to get my hair my glory if they was to take my prayer life that Root's still there Hallelujah established in the faith now moving on a little bit he said as you have been taught you see Paul was a man that believed in the five-fold ministry not only did he believe in pastors Bishops overseers and things but he also believed that those that were over the flock of God will also have assistance in that Ministry that local Ministry by Apostles evangelists teachers and Prophets now I know because a lot of people have this new testament idea about what a prophet is they don't think there's any prophets Among Us in the last day they're around they're preachers they stay with the message and with the Bible they don't necessarily have to be born off the Brandon branch and they don't have to be born off the Smith Branch or the NORAD Branch God calls as severly as he will God's got men that are prophets of the Lord that are Visionaries that are judgment speakers that can come to a church and tell them watch out for this certain thing that's coming down the road these prophets they understand they see the cup full before it gets there I don't know about you but I've sat under the ministry of men that may not call themselves prophets but their Ministry certainly is foretelling they let us know about things coming down the road they tell us about the troubles around us and what the bride should prepare for amen and how we should prepare ourself amen and what we should look for and I believe these Ministries not only establish the faith of the saints of God but give us the understanding of what we're going through whether it's bad good or anything else so that no matter what's going on we can be like job the lord giveth the lord taketh away but blessed be the name of the Lord these are the men of God that's going to help us understand what it means to be a true worshipper of him by the way that's my title I forgot to call it true worship is what I'm talking about this morning now Jesus said himself and I just happened to think of this trying to quote this scripture he said they that worship me the time is coming well they won't worship around here no more but the hour is coming and now is they that worship Him shall worship Him in spirit and in truth and the Baptist had him in the truth and the Pentecostals had him in the spirit amen one had the checkbook but no money in the bank the other had the money in the bank no checkbook brother BR said if you could ever get the two put together he said then you would have something by that would be amen a a a reflection of the book of Acts and the true church that God wanted and gave at Pentecost amen that's what brother Ram's mission was was to teach us how to get to money and to bank and put it all together so we could write the check and become the kind of people we need to become amen then once that account has been established and has been established in the hearts of the Bride then we can know how to worship God than friends when worship was first established in the very beginning with the New Testament Church you know all they had was the Old Testament side of things I mean think about it here these people you'd see for Shadows all down through the Old Testament Miriam grab that tambourine and Shout on the bank you'd see semi and them just without any bidding raise our hands up and thank God like that Jesus himself was a little bit Pentecostal he used to raise his hands up and thank the Lord too amen and yet at the very same time amen all they had was a reflection of what were worship was from the Old Testament think about that when they would go into the temple they had to be dressed a certain way they had to have a certain order of things everything had to be placed in its proper order and as they went back into the veil and they pulled back them flaps there was four flaps Matthew Mark Luke and John and as they pulled them flaps back and stepped back in behind that Veil they begin to Worship the Lord it wasn't just a Hallelujah and praise the Lord and glory to God like we have today but it was a reverential fear knowing that they were there for a purpose that everything God required of them was in its proper place now I want you to listen to me close this is the reason why that we preach that women dress a certain way and mandress a certain way this is the reason we preach Church order this is the reason we preach an order of gifts this is the reason we preach in order of worship this is a reason we preach an order of the ministry and how they're supposed to operate amen an evangelist ain't supposed to tell a prophet what to do and a prophet ain't supposed to tell a pastor what to do and vice versa and on each one has got their ministries of how they operate and they operate severly as they will but under one anointing of the holy spirit let all things Paul said all things all a l l all things be done decently and in order you know and we see it a lot amongst the people of this truth they got a lot of decency about them but not a lot of order and then a lot of order sometimes and not a lot of decency and just kind of willy-nilly and go about it and do whatever they want to do but God required the people to have an order now bridging from the Old Testament to the New Testament I've often said this that if you want to know what to bring up out of the Old Testament and what to place in the New Testament is not hard God provided a filter by the name of Paul that's right and the Apostle Paul was God's filter of what what we keep in the Old Testament and what we don't this is the reason why if you want to know what God wanted us to do from the Old Testament you go talk to Paul about it he was the man given the commission to place those things into the New Testament Church somebody said well who did he think he is well he must have thought God was behind him because he said though we are an angel preach anything contrary let him be a curse it's pretty powerful words pretty strong Revelation amen and him he said if a man think himself spiritual or a prophet let him acknowledge what I write are the Commandments of the Lord that's pretty strong and did you also notice there he said let him acknowledge because Paul didn't believe in women preachers that's he didn't say let him or her he said let him and he wasn't using someone's pronouns either they and them and H and all that amen because amen if you want to know where that stuff come from amen I I I'll just preach another sermon on on on hell and the devil and Satan and those things amen that's where a lot of that mess come from in the first place amen nothing but a bunch of perversion anyhow because you know you look at it don't call me a he or a she or call me an it or a that don't don't you see what's happening amen people don't have an identity they don't know what to do they're so confused about life and they just go into the neutral zones amen God don't want us living our life in a neutral zone he wants to identify who are we and who God made us amen I was preaching a Wednesday night back at the home Church our pastor's been into a family series and he invited me to come and speak and uh bring a portion of this family series and um I was sitting with my middle daughter anaise who was a little uh sing and this guy had done a talk that morning and he started in Daniel brother Jesse I noticed right away when he started reading how they changed the names of the children of Israel and Daniel and them amen it just it just grabbed me all of a sudden I thought you know that's what social media that's what all these other things are doing they're changing the identity of real saints of God Amen and giving them some false profile some fake life out there amen that they can hide behind that computer screen amen and change their identity to some Babylonian thing and never have to actually own up to who they really are amen listen let me just put it this way my family is is full of anxieties and fears that stuff just travels right down through our genetics and things amen and every single one of us amen my daughters me my wife my mom my dad when he was here and all my loved ones and when they are here amen are gone either way the life that they lived here amen nervous and all these other kind of things followed right down through that family line Satan would like to isolate our minds and make us think the only ones that experienced that amen but then you hear the prophet of God say now how many in here has nervous troubles he say 80% would raise up their hands amen but that's what Satan wants to do is isolate us away from the body amen from corporate worship amen because in here is where we can give strength one to another hallelujah amen the prophet said that we even have the ability if we're in the body to pass eternal life one to another and if I've got virtue and you need it amen in a corporate worship setting like this amen that wor that corporate worship will bring out that virtue and put it over in somebody else Hallelujah they may not even know where it's coming from amen but just someone exuding presence of God and powers of God and worship of the Lord and atmosphere like that oh you say it don't happen that way you should have said as far as you know I beg your pardon it does happen that that way amen when our Brethren get up here on this music and start playing you may not realize it or not but as gifted men amen all them little Devils you carried in from the world into this church with you amen them Divine healers are sending them Spirits off of you amen why in corporate worship that's where the anointing flows through the body of Christ and brother said these gifts of God Mill through this body while we're sitting here amen this is one reason why I believe that we got to be careful not to just alter call Pump It Up yes sir we need to understand that the power of God doesn't just operate just when someone calls an autter call or when someone comes up for prayer the mentality is okay now now I'm coming to the man of God for prayer now we're going to get under the anointing amen but you're under the anointing from the time you walk through the back door and walk through that door and sit down amen by the time the pastor walks out or the minister walks out the music is playing the worship is going and God is Milling through the body right then and people that understand that can absolutely fulfill Peter's words or Peter's example when he said while he yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them that's what happens when we're taught amen that is what happen when we're established when you realize the root of Christ that is in you was not placed there by a pastor or nobody else wasn't placed there by your mama or brother Ram or some church member or some family member or just because you were taught to do it or told to do it that root was placed in there by Christ himself you may doubt it being that way but God put it in there anyways in spite of what you might think about it give it time you'll find out who's the boss in the long run amen that's right cuz I know what God does to hard heads I used to be one of them amen he'll send you through the ringer until you wake up when wise up a bit and understand God is the one in control of your destiny and he'll shake you every which away amen turn you we say down in the South turn you every Way but Loose amen until he gets you in the right position but established abounding therein with Thanksgiving so a person that has been established rooted built up and taught right they can abound with Thanksgiving I've noticed this brother Jesse as I travel and I i' I've noticed this many many times brother Smith when I'm going place to place to place to place you can tell the churches that aren't really taught how to worship correctly and sometimes these places of worship are loud emotional and all it takes me is about 20 minutes of good dig right into the soul preaching to find out they ain't got a clue what I'm talking about they can be emotional they be loud they jump and hop and scream all over the place but that does not mean they understand their part on the inside of this Booker I'm preaching about yes sir yes sir cuz you could have all of those emotions like that and still never produce nothing talk to some of these people that come out of Pentecost and Apostolic my mom and and some of these things amen talk to some of these people that came out amen my mother used to Tar at the altars all night long amen and T and pray with them until they spoke in tongues and many of them would speak in tongues and walk right out there amen and commit adultery with somebody's wife smoking cigarettes cussing out out of both sides of their mouth on and on and on and on not enough power of God to blow the fuzz off a peach right brother and yet they were emotional yet that proves that there was no real root placed in the heart now many of you have heard my testimony you know the early days I come up mostly around the return Ministry movement when I was a boy back to only the church we had down there that made any sense and so we went there as the best slice of bread or loaf of bread or whatever we could get at the time and so you know of course my old Pastor he was a wonderful Bible teacher it just somehow or another we always wound up both feet right in the middle of return somewhere amen but I learned how to love and be patient a lot of things from some of them teachings so I'm not disparaging of it I thank God for the time I had but because of the emphasis on them things there wasn't much worship we'd sing a song it'd be As Dead As midnight and sing the next song it was dead than the first one if you can imagine and somebody would get up and they'd take prayer requests for 30 35 minutes and then they would spend 25 of that talking about that profit you got to Stomp the ground when you say it to get it right amen or the message you know you got to get your foot on there Amen to get it right amen or you got a gesture with your finger you wasn't getting the right holy ghost anointing if you didn't say it right amen and then all of that amen would come to the Apex of well Hallelujah God bless you Church take the name of Jesus with you amen we go through an entire service and not one time was there any really genuine corporate worship amongst that group why the failure to teach the people how to possess the word for themselves kills the body of Christ hang on a minute I just said a strong thing to you if you've only been taught believe the message because you've been taught believe the message you are never going to be able to worship God righty if you've been taught believe the Bible because you've been taught to believe believe the Bible you're never going to worship God right if you've been taught dress and live a certain way cuz you've been taught to dress and live a certain way and you don't possess that for yourself you will never worship God right it is hard to be thankful for something that's never penetrated your heart amen that's why our families brother they need more and sister they need more than just our teaching they need a real touch from the shikina himself amen that's what I pray for all three of my babies and I pray it for me too God keep their hearts sensitive that you can deal with them that you can move on them amen that you can all of the good things I could teach them that's wonderful but God keep them sensitive they can receive amen I pray it for me I pray it for my wife I pray for all of my loved ones amen I've got my three girls that I'm raising by God's grace and I try to raise them right their their daddy being a preacher I have tried my best Through The Years not to hammer him over the head with everything in the world yes sir cuz I didn't want him growing up hating church I've seen that too much where people pull them and press them and twist them and squeeze on them every which way and a second they get old enough to get out the door and get a little money in their pocket amen they run to the world as hard as they can go amen but what I've always tried to do as a father is instruct this is my Revelation this is what I believe this may not be what you believe and until God reveals it to you this is not my this is not your Revelation it's mine this is what God done for me this is what God put in my heart this is what the Lord shown me amen but what we've done as many times in our homes we've tried to raise little Messiahs when they were born Sinners just like you and I was I mean you Holy Ghost filled people and each one has to have their own revelation of Jesus Christ I should be getting a lot more amens of what I'm getting right now let me tell you that right now let me say it one more time each one everyone no matter of their age category who they are where they come from or background all of us have to have our own revelation of Jesus Christ because if I can Force One into it somebody will force him out of it if I can pull one in somebody will pull them out it just depends on how strong their influence is that's why it takes God to establish that seed Hallelujah it takes the Holy Ghost to plant that in their hearts and if it ain't there I can't put it there that's what I've said many times preaching like this I'd say you know somebody say to me uh uh for example brother Ben I need that Revelation I said but I can't give it to you h no man not one man can give another one a revelation it comes sovereignly by God Amen to who he will reveal it he'll reveal it but we have to be a ground amen that is good ground you got to get all the rock out of there you got to make sure them birds and all them are scared away out of there got to make sure it's good ground and even that brother said was predestinated before the foundation of the world yet there are certain things that if God wanted to do it amen he could shake anybody in and Shake anybody out if God wanted to fill this room up full of fleas are thick we couldn't bat our eyes he do whatever he wants to he's God but even God himself follows a program and an ordination he does everything decently and God does it in order amen so he don't call unless there's something to call and it don't reject unless there's something to reject and it lays upon us the responsibility my brother sister please listen to every word I'm saying every word right now listen to this don't let this leave your heart it is not God's responsibility to find out am I a part of this program or not that is for you and I to pray get in this Bible and start studying and reading listen to the message amen start with your Bible and move into the things of godj that burden lays upon on us to find out what is my purpose here in life it's easy for some people to say well Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm a part of the message I'm a believer I'm a believer I'm a Believer many of them are saying that just because they're robots and been taught that they're not saying that because it's Revelation to them they just been taught that amen and they're saying it that ain't no different in this and that modern day and somebody say well what are you I'm Pentecostal Pentecostal Pentecostal Pentecostal Baptist Baptist Baptist Baptist and our people message message message message they don't know anything else to say that's why they don't know how to Worship in the capacity of a Believer amen because the only way to Worship in God's chosen place oh I love to say this Hallelujah is to be in God's chosen place of worship amen and by one Spirit Hallelujah not by one church not by one preacher not by one Movement by one St we are all baptized into to the body of Christ hallelujah hallelujah if I am in that body I can worship I can praise the Lord I can worship Hall amen glory cuz I'm coming from a place from a source of real worship where it can really come from hallelujah thank you Jesus now Colossians chapter 4 verse two let's go through some scriptures for a little bit can we I figure I got about 20 minutes I guess we're at about 20 till all that singing I think maybe if I take you to 12 it' be all right you reckon all right pH excuse me Colossians I mean chapter 4 verse two now watch what he says here continue in prayer that's a good thing isin't it but now watch the next part and watch in the same huh with Thanksgiving it's amazing how we pray but we forget the Thanksgiving part girls are pray I need a husband I need a husband I need a husband but you ain't thinking the Lord he going to come good brother good example amen both boys are praying send me a good girl send me a right woman and praying but we're not thanking the lord she's on the way uh talk to me now we've got to remember what we ask God for if he doesn't tell us no then there's a possibility it might be a yes and we should be thankful are you with me are you listening are you with me we should be thankful to God and say Lord thank you for sending me whatever it is I'm praying for you ever stop to think one reason God just don't put it in our la because he knows we ain't nothing but an ungrateful bunch of SPO brats we're asking asking asking asking almost demanding many times and never stop to say Lord thank you for being gracious to me to be able to let me first even ask you I wonder if we practice a little bit more of this right here if we wouldn't see more prayers go woooooo woo preach brother Ben I think I will wonder if we would start thanking the lord a little bit more wonder if we'd start giving him some Glory Glory about what we asked him about I wonder if we would see more coming our way but if we're spoiled and ungrateful how's he ever going to give us anything say well I would be appreciative of great things and good things in the Lord and all that but you know God never answers my prayer right wonder why now Revelation 7:12 now notice this now this is uh not exactly right attached to the Seven Seals but the same thing occurs at the very time of the opening of the word now there's 30 minutes of silence when the lion roars out liken that to the lion in The Jungle he said when he cries out everything goes quiet he said the king is about to speak and so everything goes silent now the space of a half an hour is already done okay but I'm convinced that some message people believe we still in the silence they forgot how to say Amen 30 years ago they don't worship they don't praise they don't have any kind of anything about them and you preach a message like I'm preaching this morning they think you're Pentecostal and you backslid well we're in the word now we should be in the Revelation well if the revelation is the Revelation I think this is a part of the Revelation is it amen yet at the very same time how many do you know you could go visit a camp or whatever and they get in these camps and these special revivals and they are tearing the walls out of the place go home with some of them go home with some of them I do cuz I'm usually their church is four and five and six and 8 and 12 months afterwards and I know how they behave some of them will shout and roll in the saw dust and speak in tongues and slobber and everything else and get home and set out like a bump on a log amen yes sir now that's not worship that's excitement come on Amen it's getting under the anointing of some preacher or some Minister under the anointing of the conre and granted it's corporate worship thank God they've got an atmosphere that maybe they can get born in but that atmosphere atmosphere rather should follow you home and in your Amen in the school and everywhere [Applause] else now watch this now in Revelation 7:12 he said amen blessing Glory you ain't quit on me yet have you wisdom Thanksgiving honor power might be under our God forever and ever and John got so excited he said amen twice [Music] Hallelujah Heaven helped some of these people in the message they don't even know how to say Amen once much less twice as they come to church and they think being in church is the purpose is to be educated to learn something new what new thing can you teach me man of God I got news for you folks this church is not a TED Talk that's right that's right this is not an instructional YouTube video or or some Instagram video or some Facebook thing where you're learning how to bake a pie or sew some certain certain thing or fix a car this is not some intellectual talk this is the house of God that is a house of prayer and worship glory to God the TED Talks had the anointing and let him saying blessing and honor and glory and wisdom and Hallelujah but you ain't going to catch him doing that there CU that ain't the atmosphere for it so we shouldn't bring that into here oh I know how some people well you know brother Jesse's a teacher and maybe he doesn't get super excited and run around and you know but that ain't got nothing to do with your anointing let me tell you something brother I would almost rather hear a teacher in this day and age than I would somebody run around say where the bride where in the bride where're in the message where in the message I knew that 30 years ago now I need to know how to live right hello somebody I knew that 30 years ago when I first give my heart to the Lord now I need to have overcome everything around me I need someone to teach me something instruct me tell me [Applause] how how to be a good father how to be a good husband how to be a good son of God somebody teach me how to do the things God wants me to do yes heyen listen to this in the time of decision brother B says the church that's praising and blessing and watering with Thanksgiving to the Holy Ghost who has brought the word to you he types it with Isaac and Rebecca when elzer went out there and found him the right woman brother B said that she jumped up on that Camel you see a beast in the Bible represents a power right the power represents the Holy Ghost and the holy ghost that she watered was the Holy Ghost that carried her to meet her bridegroom that's right her new birth experience the power that laid in her you know a camel's a funny buil animal anyways you know reason they don't need a lot of water and all that kind of stuff their veins and things are really really wide open and thick like this where the blood just continually flow not like little skinny tiny veins like us humans got that's why we have to keep drinking water to keep from getting dehydrated but a camel got these big old veins like this and the blood just keeps circulating you see because that's what keeps the camel moving it has a lot of blood moving through it Hallelujah kind of like my Holy Ghost the blood of Christ is always moving through it I don't ever have to worry about being dehydrated during this spiritual drought season while I'm in the spiritual denominational organizational lady seeing desert Hallelujah I don't have to worry about it the blood is always flowing glory to God hallelujah hallelujah GL amen no matter how dry I my get the blood is still flowing through the body than you Jesus amen it's also one reason why I don't have to keep coming to church and keep looking for some huge Pentecostal out pouring every time I come it's okay to come to churches sometimes it be dry don't worry little camel you'll be all right yes sir oh you know the churches that go through dry spells pastors go through dry spells congregations go through dry spells but if you're riding the Holy Ghost camel don't worry your camel won't dry up and die he's Bel he's ballah to withstand the pressure am he's constructed God ordained to withstand the pressure of the desert Hallelujah that's why some people say well I go to that church out there but it's just so dry well you every you're not a camel that's why they run to every meeting they can and every outpouring they can because you know if you're not a camel you need lots of water some of these people got these thin little lady will see in veins they can just can't just barely make it somebody pray for me I can get back to prayer meeting in the middle of the church I can't hardly get through you ain't no camel if God ordained you with a holy ghost camel brother amen you can go through days and days and days of a dry spell I feel like shouting hallelujah hallelujah it can go mon sometimes a prophet of God said one time the Lord Jesus put him in a trial amen and stopped talking to him for six long months but did Brother Bram die up and die spiritually no he was on a cam glory to God hallelujah and that cam is built to EST stand the pressure of the Desert Glory [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah amen amen glory to [Applause] God so don't worry Rebecca if things get a little dry around you just remember that cam was built wo he is built to take all that heat and all that pressure that's right and if she watered him he took her straight to Isaac and that's the way it is oh thank you Lord there'll come some times and that Holy Ghost says I need a prayer meeting you need to spend some time with your Bible I need to get back in church oh hallelujah hallelujah oh thank you Jesus now 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse1 15 watch this now Paul says for all things are for your sakes watch this that the abundant grace the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redown to the glory of God corporate worship yes so not just one giving praise but as the whole congregation as the whole group enters in it just rebounds or redounds back to the glory of God this is why the Bible said when one rejoices we should all rejoice one cries we should all cry in other words not walk around feeling sorry for our but when one's going through a hard trial to enter into that burden of Affliction God help my brother help my sister help that family help that school boy help that school girl they're going through hell on this Earth and they need some help God I put forth my faith and my Thanksgiving to you that you can bring them out the same as you can bring me and all the rest glory to God hallelujah that you can bring all of us out of this [Applause] Thing 2 Corinthians chapter 9: 11 Paul says being enriched in everything to all bountifulness which causeth through US Thanksgiving to God this word enrich means to be rich of spiritual Rich riches to be richly furnished so Paul says we are furnished richly in everything to bountifulness so where in the name of God friends respectfully and honestly where in the world do people get this idea living here I've just got barely enough to make it you hear so-called Christians sometimes I just don't know if I I can make it through I just can barely somebody the Old Devil told me the other day praise His holy name that I probably wasn't saved and probably wasn't going to make it in the Rapture right brother and I imagine if these people are truly born again the Holy Ghost what they're doing is on the front porch with the door shut huddled in a corner in the fetal position nearly acting like they ain't got nothing when all you got to do is kick the front door in and start looking around that's good brother good that's why we don't need to be sitting around feeling sorry for oursel all the time sitting around worry all about this and obsessing about every little thing am I this am I that am I the other just stop looking at yourself and start looking at the Abundant riches is anybody hear me this morning stop looking at yourself as long as you focus on you you will never see success if you'll keep your eyes on that word you will always be successful you will always see the riches and the glory and the power and the wisdom and the might be unto our God forever [Applause] amen but as long as you keep your eyes on here long as you're always looking at this well I'm not this I'm not that what will people think what won't they think what this what that what that you will never ever see this right here but get your eyes off that praise the Lord I love this in Jehovah Miracles brother said you know every day every hour is a Thanksgiving Day now most Americans and Canadians Alli will celebrate Thanksgiving one day of the year but to the elect every day is a [Music] Thanksgiving he said I once was blind but now I see again brother B is preaching along and he says oh praise be to God well I guess it's appropriate for a minister to worship God from the pull pit he says but you know what's amazing how many preachers you see today that preach and preach and preach and preach but never get blessed now here's our example brother Bram is Malachi 4 this is Elijah Elijah the prophet of that anointing of the ministry of Elijah gets something good from the Lord he goes oh praise be to God but you don't see that anymore you see these guys he just talk and talk and turn pages and scroll and next slide and next slide and are you with me folks and but you never see them just step back and go my goodness Hallelujah so not only is it appropriate for you to be blessed but it's appr and to worship for that matter but it's also appropriate for me to worship because you see this is the misconception about preaching folks have their minds set up that when a preacher preaches we've got everything fixed we've solved everything overcome everything we preach I got news for you there are many things that we preach that we have not overcome ourselves right and we're not required by God to have it all licked whipped and under our feet before we preach it to the people we are setting an image up before all of us not just you but before me as well this is the goal this is the mark of the prize of the high calling and this is what we're all striving for oh you say that's not right hold on now before brother Brandon preaches marriage and divorce he had been looking at it and working at it for the my since the 50s early 50s Holy Spirit told him to tape it he tells I'm going to break every Church up in the nation if I preach it brother bam T toiled and carried and waited on God Plum up to February of 65 before he preaches it right right before he preaches it he's at the Tabernacle and he preaches a message called a man running from the presence of the Lord you know why he preached a man running from the presence of the Lord cuz he was that man running from the the presence of the Lord he knew what people were going to do with his message when it was over with that's look at what some of these guys have done over the polygamy things and over marriage and divorce in general look what they've done with all that foolishness that they've done yes sir taking a pure Godly thus sayith the Lord and they've Twisted it in a a trillion different ways right and here he is well I just thought I would Preach Today on Jonah a and running from the presence of the Lord why he was setting that image up before himself he was saying to you and the people and to himself William brandham this is what you need to be mindful ofallah if you go running away from this God will stick you in the belly of a whale boy right brother praise the Lord man I've told young preachers at different times and they think about being called and they act like they're wanting to run I said Just remember when you get down that whales belly just look up around the right side about halfway down and you're going to see brother Ben was here I said if you look above that you're going to see brother Brandon was here Wesley was here Luther was here Paul was here Peter was here all of us have that time that we just don't want to respond and take the responsibility of things sir but God holds our feet to the fire that we've got to do the thing that we have been called of God to do so the preacher is not just up there preaching it for you he's preaching it for himself too right and I hear him in 1962 January I think it was of 62 he's in Arizona preaching and up to this time if you study the progression of it brother renam has always said that Eve provided the egg for the Holy Spirit to mate with to produce the body of Christ that's right brother Jesse while he's in the platform while he's preaching the spirit of God reveals to him look and this is the statement we get later Look What You've Got God doing if you do that that takes a sensation to produce an egg and only a sensation or a sexual feeling would bring the egg down and that sexual feeling would have had to come from God and then brother bam says oh my oh my this is coming fresh never saw this before praise be to God he said she couldn't have produced that God couldn't have moved on her in that way it would have been sin and sex all over again so God created the sperm God created the egg and God brought them together in conception and the blood cell was created perfectly by God Joseph was not the father Mary was not the mother there was no sensations of sex anywhere it was perfect virgin amen creation praise be to God creation of God that's why he's our Messiah and his blood sets us free from everything amen amen and while brother bam is preaching this he says Oh Praise the Lord hallelujah now for these people to than every word brother B said was thus sayith the Lord to me they're going to struggle when they come there because he wasn't perfect he wasn't infallible he was learning just like you and I do praise the Lord right here at 12:00 I'm going to have to hurry if I'm going to get to 12 INE now watch this in a key to the door brother says now communion means Thanksgiving to the Protestant communion is Thanksgiving for what God has already done in communion with communion with God communion with him it's already done the Catholic takes Mass hoping God's going to forgive something but we take communion communion with Christ knowing our Thanksgiving that God has already done it but how many people do you see approach a communion table like they're coming to a mass they come to the communion table and they're oh God please don't strike me dead oh God please don't let me die oh God please don't let me be guilty of taking the body and the blood unworthily oh God if you are born again of the Holy Ghost that's impossible that's that's right we should be approaching a communion table with joy as I told my mother some time ago there's healing in that communion it's not that bread and not that wine that a person would take it's what it symbolizes the same thing as if you're sick and I put my hands on you like this it's what it symbolizes it's not my hand but I'm representing Christ on Earth glory be to God hallelujah I'm representing the body and the blood and if I take that in faith am there's healing and it I approach the communion table I don't go there saying oh God oh God please please it's why some people come to church oh God please I ple but if I'm set settled established in the faith rooted and built up I should be able to walk to that communion table Lord thank you for your blood thank you for your body God it was broken for me by your stripes I am healed and by your blood I am regenerated to some people it's a problem to me it ain't no big deal it ain't no bigger deal to me than was getting baptized I didn't go down to the river going oh God I hope I'm saved oh Lord I hope I'll get the Holy Ghost I was like man where are we getting baptized at get me down there I can't [Applause] wait woo glory to God some of y'all thought brother B was crazy now you know I am don't you amen Abraham Lincoln said let him guess don't open your mouth and resolve all doubt amen now notice this let let me let me just stop right here and we'll pick it up this afternoon watch again brother B said in the token millions of Americans will celebrate Thanksgiving eat dinner he said with a cart of whiskey on the table and beer sitting around he said oh it's just become an American tradition brother brandham and he said that's not even americanism to be such a way he said now I'll turn it right back around in your lap he said he said coming to the altar was some dry eyed confession now as he's saying the example he's given is that they'll come to the Thanksgiving table when they approach the Thanksgiving table they come almost like it's a you know just a just a thing getting together and having dinner what's a big deal you know and uh you folks are Chinese right did you come from China where's my Chinese brother sister at is that you folks from China are you the sister from China is it it do you have Chinese here sister Wendy was the Chinese one wasn't she from Hong Kong that's right I remember her story now that's right in China I don't know if they do this where you'all from again that's right yes I remember now 47 I'm telling you it happens hang in there it's coming I see a little gray hair and every now I'm teasing I'm teasing now in China they just come through what they call the Chinese New Year now it's not the Turning of the New Year it's a it's a festival it's a celebration they had it last Saturday and you know I I teach these little Chinese kids in the morning I teach them English and so somebody said do you know Chinese I said no no it's English all English everything's English and if they start speaking Chinese no no no no English only and so i' be teaching these kids and you can hear in the background boom boom bo bo boom bo bo boom boom boom fireworks everywhere couldn't even hardly teach these youngans because there were so many fireworks it was like boom bo bo bo bo bo bo boom these kids would laugh Chinese New Year Chinese New Year and I would listen to them I'd ask them questions I'd say well what does that holiday mean to you you know what answers I got out of 12 year olds and 10 year olds ah we go to my grandfather's we go to grandmothers and we have a little supper and that's it now to the Chinese it is the celebration of spring coming to them not being like Christian type people there's no protestantism over there as as as we would know it here to them it's just a traditional thing that they honor because that's just what they do in China and I sat and thought to myself how many Revival Services have we had people boom boom bo boom boom boom boom in the church people are worshiping everywhere or people the message the message boom boom boom boom boom boom the prophet the the prophet boom boom boom boom boom boom boom but when you really get to asking them what it all means it's nothing but a traditional Gathering you know what God Said to Israel he said your Feast your new moons your washing of pots and bands all of it has become a stink in my nostril think of it the very God that established the very worship they were performing the very thing they were demonstrating brother Smith was the very thing God told him to do and he tells them very same people about the very thing he told them to do it's become a stink in my nostril why it wasn't the action they were performing it was their attitude toward what was being performed I'll leave you with this we we'll we we'll break and come back the afternoon the Lord will Paul Raider remember that name in the message brother Bram had a friend Paul Raiders the one that wrote only believe he said he's a cut up had a sense of humor but he's also kind of a hot high high tempered type fell hotheaded and uh hotheaded I'm trying to say and him and his wife got in a fuss he said they had a little tradition so when they come to the door when he's going to work he'd kiss her she'd kiss him wave goodbye from the car and to go out and they got in a fuss that morning and uh do you some of you Yankees Northern people up here you know what fussing means you ever heard anybody fuss ever get in a fuss with your brother or sister some of you after Saints you know what fussing is do you do that in Africa somewhere or another they had a little spat little fuss he grabbed her and kissed her she kissed him he got to the car he waved she waved he went around the corner and a little bit he got down the road and he got under conviction something struck his heart what if she died before I got home what if I got killed on this road out here and I didn't get to see her ever again he spun that car around he drove and he said she was hiding behind the door holding her face like this with tears coming down her eyes he said he said he reached over and got her and he repented and said I'm sorry he kissed her and she kissed him he got in the driveway he waved and she waved and around the corner he went he said it was all different why he said the second time had real feeling in it the first time was just because it was a tradition come on somebody that's the way God wants us to come to church with passion with excitement Hallelujah that's how he wants us to sing and play that's how he wants us to play the piano that's how he wants us to worship that's how he wants us to pastors how he wants us to Mother how he wants us to be kids teenagers all of it with passion for the Lord I heard it some time back just a little bit a fellow was talking and he said he said the Journey To Success is Not an airplane flight it's not a direct flight he said he said ' it's a road trip and he said based on what kind of fuel you put in your car is going to be how your road trip goes and he said one of the things that a Christian has to fuel themsel they have to fuel themself with passion if you're not passionate about it if you don't care about it if it doesn't excite you enthuse you coming to church will'll be a kiss and a kiss a wave and a wave and around the corner you'll go that's good it'll become a tradition and the same God that said then it was a stink is the same God that'll feel the same way today we don't want it to become as stink in his nostril do we I want him to receive my worship as being passionate from the very depths of my heart stand with me praise the
