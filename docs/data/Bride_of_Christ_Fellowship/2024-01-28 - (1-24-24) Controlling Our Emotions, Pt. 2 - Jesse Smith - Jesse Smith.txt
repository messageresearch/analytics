========================================

let's look at control our emotions part two I told you last week I didn't get all the the notes preached and I surely did not but I'll try to get a little further today I think if I'm looking at my notes correctly I might have a third part in here we'll kind of see how it goes we'll see how tonight goes and you of course that deals with how the holy spirit will speak to us tonight you know with your polling uh and my yielding you know we'll see how far we can get here through these scriptures by God's grace Proverbs 25:28 thank youa appreciate it let's read that we can ready 1 2 3 he that have no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and Without Walls is that one more word of prayer you have a need on your heart let's just make a KN to God heavenly father in the presence of these Saints Lord we raise our hands Lord that we have needs that we need met Lord by you also in the presence of this live audience God we do the same online but also in the presence of these Holy Angels Lord that are encamped about us Lord we just lift our hearts to you God we love you God we've asked you to forgive our sins so we know we're coming with confidence God that you'll speak to us here tonight and help us here tonight Lord Jesus Lord take these scriptures break them to us just as you did Lord in that house after uh the walk to Aus Lord God you broke the bread in a way that only you could do it may you speak in a way that only you can speak that it won't be well I remember what brother Jesse said but Lord the people would remember what the holy spirit said father God I'm asking you to do it Lord God I need you to do it father God we just uh come here at our post of Duty Lord as you taught us to do Lord be faithful Lord God in season out of season whether we feel like it or not we must be faithful in every season and we ask God that you minister to us Lord we surely feel like being here tonight I surely feel like preaching Lord God so I feel like I'm in season Hallelujah and so father take your word now and uh speak to your people that we can see a change in our lives in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated a couple of wonderful testimonies you know from Sunday talked to brother Austin he had a really good testimony about the services there um so I really appreciated that and thankful to see what the Lord did you know down in Junction City I preed on uh the mystery of the church as the bride and a married couple had think they told my wife that they've been talking about that all week what is the bride and what is how do we uh how do we understand the bride I went and preach an entire sermon on it so it was really wonderful to see that and then we had some good questions afterwards uh I'll might share some of them here tonight if I kind of get to those um just some nice nice nice questions like about lot and uh the other one was about the three places you might go after death you know what are those three places of course that's for Sinners it's the uh the prison in the heart of the earth and then uh the sixth Dimension Under The Altar and then there's no doubt some saints in the seventh Dimension it's the 24 Elders you you know are at the Throne of God so there's at least three places we we could possibly go uh by God's grace brother goes beyond the curtain of time and he says he went to the sixth Dimension right or that place under the Altar and so uh we have that proof there so that's really good it's some excellent questions and uh real good Fellowship so uh it was a wonderful time in the Lord I just want to briefly review you know we looked at uh motions last week and I appreciate you know numerous people said they enjoyed it so I was really happy about that um by God's grace but I I love to me I love see Jesus's emotions I love seeing that because uh recently you know I was accused of not showing the love of Christ and maybe being a little angry but the Bible says you can be angry and sin not and that's what I felt like you know was happening in my life after prayer reflection you know I can only look at my life and and look at the fruits of my life praise God but uh we can have that we can have anger and sin not and Jesus did that when people had hard Hearts he would look at them in anger because he knew the conditions of their heart and so for me you know I see people I've I've worked with for years or maybe i' I've commented with people for weeks on end and I can see uh their attacks I can see where they come from and I feel like the Holy Spirit shows me that they have a hard heart right through their words right or lack of words uh and so that's when I may I may speak harsh words but if I know I'm right I I know the words right then I I know where I'm standing praise God and so Jesus you experienced uh anger uh and then we saw how brother brand said his main emotion was weeping so if you around Jesus a lot like his disciples the most common thing you would see him do is not shouting Glory Glory it was crying he'd be crying and in sorrow think about it think about all the stories you know the disciples can't cast out the devil and he's like oh faithless generation he's in the boat and they can't cast they can't rebuke the storm and he says oh where's your faith right here's a man he's a perfect man right but we see we see we see God's heart through Jesus brother R said Jesus is I'm sorry Jesus is the heart of God that's what brother R says you know it's figuratively right he's a heart of God he's the character of God Hebrews 1:3 you know Jesus is the express image of God the exact reproduction of God Amen so we see God doesn't rebuke us because uh you know the wrong reasons God rebukes us to try to help us amen just like you would correct your child right parents and the parents said or your dogs you're trying to help your dogs right they got to learn right and so God you know Jesus wasn't being mean in that way to his own disciples but he was trying to encourage them get out of the Flesh and get into the Holy Spirit praise God Amen he chastens all those that he loves so if God has rebuked you lately that's a good sign he loves you am hallelujah it's not easy to receive that at times but it's true if God rebukes you then he loves you hallelujah amen and he wants his aim is correction yeah amen hallelujah I like what brother tells us though he gives us wisdom for humans you know the wisdom for humans brother said in the church age book he said he says start with a positive before you bring the correction right so so you know all of us have bosses right or one time had a boss or and uh you know it feels really bad when the boss doesn't recognize all the good things you did they just come up and say you did this wrong I remember Austin was tell me about that at Mustard Seed one time you know he just felt bad you know getting all these rebukes and not any compliments right we can do all this extra work and it's nobody sees it except God Amen God sees it Hallelujah but then it can be discouraging so brother tells us as parents and as as Saints right if we're going to correct people if we're going to correct others we should start with a positive and then bring the correction now none of us are perfect right but it's a really good thing and I've learned that at school I've used that a lot at school you know and also you know through comments and so forth like that I'll say well God bless you and appreciate you thanks for the comment here's here's some correction you know uh and so Jesus went from anger to weeping and then the Bible said he thank God that God had hid these things from the wise and prudent and had revealed them unto babes such as would learn so we see he had the emotion of Thanksgiving thank you God Amen thank God that there's a little elect church that believes the word of God I'm talking about you hallelujah amen so Jesus would thank God for you if he was here praise God In the Flesh I'm talking he would do that he would be he'd be thanking God thank God there's a church in Aur thank God there's a church in Napoleon and albian Hallelujah and Iowa City hallelujah thank God that there's Saints all around there in Sheffield and Lorraine thank God there's Saints out there who who who have come to God like a child they come with childlike faith and they receive the simple revelation of the Bible amen like I showed you a couple weeks ago you know I'm making a video on it now there's over a 100 differences I'm up to 110 now 110 differences between between all the churches and the bride just based upon Doctrine remember one Doctrine off is Gang Green it's a flesh eating disease or it's a Le that's only going to spread to the rest of the the love so think about that what kind of spiritual condition do most these churches have if they have 114 what what do you want to say measures of of canker can I say like this a cancer I'll just say like that they have a four 114 different kinds of of cancer mhm what kind of church are they going to have they going to have a spiritual church no that's why they allow ballpark prophecies that's why they allow fornication and adultery and homosexuality has everybody see that by God's grace but by God's grace we can be free from that praise God Amen the Bible said we the holy ghost can guide us into all truth not just some but all truth praise God Amen Hallelujah and so that's what Jesus was thanking God for thank God that uh he can reveal his truth to a group of people that can have childlike faith in other words just believe the word of God just believe what the Bible says hallelujah just know that God doesn't add or take away you know no should ever add or take away from God's word hallelujah just believe what the Bible says amen amen then we finish the last time with rejoicing how Jesus rejoiced yeah he was thankful yeah Rejoice that was in the same context he rejoiced in spirit so he went from an angry Spirit imagine Jesus being angry with the cords and the whips and then not long later he'd be rejoicing amen hallelujah and see notice he rejoices over the Believers amen I preached that verse on Sunday the Bible said uh from Isaiah that God rejoices over Israel as a husband rejoices over his bride hallelujah amen hallelujah and that's what God thinks about you God rejoices over you hallelujah amen God Delights in your worship God Delights in your songs God Delights in your prayers Hallelujah God Delights in fellowship with you Hallelujah CU you're the bride you keep all the word you're submission to all the word of God hallelujah amen that's my challenge that's my humble simple challenge show me where I'm off the word hallelujah and it just it by God's grace we're not perfect but our major doctrines are right Hallelujah so are our minors amen I'll say like that by God's grace now we didn't get to this one but it's very simple Hebrews 4:15 for we have nothing not in other words we have a high priest which can be touched with the feeling of infirmities so it's in the negative which we have not a high priest which cannot be touched but we know what it's saying we have a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmity so Jesus knows what you're going through right whether it's depression or overwhelm right nervousness but R said nervousness is hereditary how many know that many times people are nervous because their parents were nervous nervous right I just heard brother say that today he said people will cross Bridges before they get to them they're already nervous about something that hasn't even happened yet now we're all guilty right we all need to cast our cares on the Lord but many times that's hered hereditary so you can expect to get Deliverance but then expect it's going to come back right especially if you spend time around your family Hallelujah because your family I'm talking natural family doesn't always bring out the best in you Hallelujah I can say Amen to that Hallelujah not always I got some good family too by God's grace I'm talking about some of them don't like I'll just be you know just be PL you some sometimes sometimes my dad is kind of negative that kind of that that can rub off on me if I'm not careful right or sometimes my mom can be a little loose that can rub off on me if I'm not careful that's what I'm saying right because I can see I I can almost feel and know what they're going to say before they say it m yeah and then I find myself saying things my dad said you know like laugh at pain you know are these things that my dad said go to college son you know those things like that don't work in a factory your whole life that's what he told me but see you know we got to be mindful though we got to be like a city that's got walls we got to put protections up to protect our thinking our human spirit amen yes amen but Jesus Can Be Touched by the feeling and our of our infirmities that means he can be affected with the same feeling that means he can feel what you're feeling amen that's what the Bible says isn't that amazing Church he's in a glorified body that can never sin again I'm sorry that can never sin at all sorry Jesus never sinned he's in a body I meant that can never die again right his body never Sinn he's in a glorified body he's got white robe on but yet he can feel the struggles you're feeling now that's to me that's a wonderful high priest hallelujah amen you got somebody on your side who knows what what you've gone through praise godh amen isn't that wonderful amen Jesus knows he can feel what you're going through and now only that uh he can be a high priest for you he can intercede to the father for you amen Lord help you know he says father help brother Jesse because he's battling depression or he's battling uh passions or whatever he's battling right he can feel that and he can pray the Bible said he prayed with strong crying and strong Tears while was on Earth so we know Jesus prays with sincerity hallelujah amen amen we know that the scripture is telling us the truth Jesus can feel what we feel Hallelujah yet without sin Hallelujah he was tempted at all points like as we are yet without sin so that means he can feel for you church he can have compassion upon you amen he can sympathize with you amen hallelujah right we always we sometimes don't get sympathy from others tough it up be a man be a woman or no there's no compassion nobody stops and says uh why you down today brother great sister why no maybe nobody pays attention to you right and the devil just likes to kick us while we're down but Jesus can have compassion amen and he does have compassion and He does care praise God Amen who's the one that comes to you when no one else feels like is around that's Jesus Hallelujah right amen who's the one telling you to worship and sing and put on that good old Snappy gospel music amen amen it's start praising God that's the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen or maybe somebody does text you out of the blue or something like that that's Jesus that's his love letting you know that he has compassion upon you praise God I haven't got to my text yet so I just kind of preaching there Proverbs 25:28 he that hath no rule now the the word rule here the word rule means to control there it is restraint sorry I lost my side there he that hath no constra I'm sorry restraint over his own spirit is like a city that's broken down Hallelujah and Without Walls Hallelujah you know if you read the old Old Testament that's what happened all the time right in the old days a city an entire city would get plummeted right how many times have they I think I was looking at it what time was there 11 times Jerusalem's been burnt to the groundh I mean and the enemy is just coming after God's holy city but God's going to get the final say hallelujah God always gets the last word amen hallelujah praise God burn it down do whatever you want but I will restore sayith the Lord hallelujah amen he that ha no restraint over his own mind is like a City that's broken down Hallelujah so see friends uh we can look at this here your spirit has five Realms conscious memory reason affection imagination and I believe affection is the realm of emotion so if we don't control these five areas the enemy can make us upset if somebody doesn't shake our Shake our hand after church right just something that small right that can upset us like oh they must not love me you know if you don't have the walls buil up anything can offend you right but the Bible said to be slow to wrath and the church said not quick like oh my whole day is ruined because of that or my husband or my wife or my mom or my dad or my sibling one little one little arrow shouldn't uh defeat your whole city and the church said right but it does if our walls are broken down and what's our wall what's our protection the word of God hallelujah very simply the word of God is our protection MH right and really nobody can hurt us if we got the walls of protection up amen amen hallelujah and then if we got the walls of protection of we will love the unlovable will love our enemies will bless those who persecute us amen hallelujah amen amen that's what you know got that's that proves Jesus had his walls up Stephen has his had his walls up when he said Lord don't lay it to their charge amen amen Jesus had his walls up right he sure did he kept the walls up how do you keep them up through that faithful prayer there in the garden ofy amen Lord let your will be done not my will be done hallelujah that faithful prayer kept his walls up do you think he wanted to slap them back I I I would imagine his flesh wanted to CU remember he was sweating drops of blood not wanting to go to the Cross right now so we must have control over our spirit we must restrain our mind so by the Holy Spirit we control feelings remember now they boil it down to four I don't know if that's wrong or not but I just like that right or not but happiness sadness anger fear we must control happiness not get happy for worldly things only get happy for God right we must not get sad in a sinful way but yes we can mourn when things are really sad in a in a holy way we must not get angry in a sinful way but it's okay to be angry in a holy way and we uh must have reverential fear for God and not fear of man Hallelujah that's the great spirit on the Amish community fear of man right that's what they said thank God for victory hallelujah amen thank God for victory through the blood amen second Timothy 2:24 H it says and the servant of the Lord must not strive Hallelujah but be gentle unto all men apt to teach and patient but yet Paul the same one that wrote this called the Galatians foolish Galatians who ha Bewitched you so see friends there's a balance just like Jesus sometimes notice he was very gentle with the children did you notice that about Jesus who was some of those Pharisees he wasn't so gentle right and Paul would not give a Paul would not give a requirement that Jesus didn't fulfill so Jesus was gentle when it was time to be gentle he was angry when it was time to be angry so you understand God Paul's not saying we must be perfect or or never get angry that's not what he's saying cuz Jesus got angry but these are General requirements he must be gentle unto to all men at to teach patient in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves see many times you know people come to me whether an email or Voice or whatever and they're they're actually caught in their own sin they're they're opposing themselves they're fighting against themselves like the one case all the brother had to do was just uh get a different phone right just get a get a dumb phone a flip phone that that will solve many of your like brother Dennis said just don't go out to the battle right don't put yourself in that situation right they they're opposing themselves or marriage trouble and they won't even say they're sorry to their spouse well you're just fighting yourself then because you've probably done twice as much to your spouse you know yet they won't even repent say they're sorry if God per Adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth so see when people oppose themselves they can't humble themselves and accept the truth can I say like this it's like a secret sin like we heard on Sunday right that's what I want to preach I want to preach a sermon just a sermon on secret sins All Through the Bible I might do that on Sunday Lord really I kind of had that thought come to me so we'll see how the St goes on Saturday or Sunday morning but see they they they won't acknowledge the truth like I was wrong it's my fault I've got some wrongs on my side too I need to say sorry for yeah right right that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil so the Satan Satan has caught them in a trap by their own lust right or own Pride lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life who are taken captive by him at his will remember Jesus told Peter Satan has tried to sift you like wheat it was Satan's will to to take Peter away from the faith but Jesus said I pray for you that your faith doesn't fail hallah amen if you if you feel like you're going to fall call somebody amen yes ask ask for intercessory prayer hallelujah amen amen because if God honored jesus' prayer to hold Peter if God honored Abraham's prayer to hold lot God will hear your prayer Hallelujah think of all the faithful prayers you prayed for your loved ones that maybe aren't serving God or maybe are caught in the snare of the devil let's have confidence in God that God hears our prayers amen that's one of the brothers was he was so blessed when I preached that he said I didn't I I forgot the Bible I didn't know the Bible said God remembered Abraham to save lot amen God Will Remember You amen amen God to remember your prayers for your loved ones that need salvation praise God am amise God remember Abraham interceded 50 40 35 30 20 if there be 10 save their souls Lord whatever you do have mercy and save Souls God hears and remembers that kind of prayer amen amen all right so see a servant of the Lord must have his walls up because he's gentle not attacks he doesn't attack others by violence and aggression I'm talking about sinful violence and aggression didn't Jesus look low pretty pretty aggressive when he got the Rope out didn't he look pretty aggressive Saints the Bible said he drove them out he didn't say excuse me would you like to leave he drove them out brother R said if Jesus was here in a lot of churches he'd be thrown tables over today amen now which preacher is going to be the first one to do that not me Hallelujah because we want to have grace and patience he's the son of God but the the the truth is here that uh we can see that sometimes there there you know we we we go back and forth between emotions I've seen all the time in the service I'll be really rebuking something then I'll be crying and dancing and joyful at the end how did I go from all those emotions God likes to use our emotions God wants you to experience all these emotions just like Jesus amen hallelujah said remember brother said he would use a little humor to open up people's Spirits so they relax and he could actually minister to them with a little humor that's why I don't mind just cracking a little joke or just trying to get people to laugh a little bit calm down a little bit right just relax God's here God he's Among Us he said wherever two or three are there I am in the mid yeah he's here kind of helps me relax too so it's so the the preacher's got to have his walls up and so does every Christian remember friends in the natural walls always had watchtowers and Ezekiel said oh Washman what of the night every city had to have a watch for danger Hallelujah and brother said that's why God gives you the Holy Ghost he says like a buzzer to protect your life amen Glory Hallelujah and so if we when we have our walls up when our walls are really up we can hear the warning of the Holy Spirit don't say that don't do that don't go there don't click on that don't watch that that's right don't reply to that yet right right Hallelujah but if our walls are broken down then we'll just do whatever we want then well whatever I feel like I want to do it's my life well it is your life but really it's life amen hallelujah so we must so we must watch then for Dangerous attacks on our emotions they don't look for Chariots of Steel and wood they to watch out for uh battering rams and ladders and arrows and all the swords then to watch out for that we got to watch out for lies of the enemy doubt and fear and discouragement right and pride of life and all these things we have to watch out for those and I'll say this they're just as dangerous as the other ones if not more right amen but say we're living in a more deceptive day today because before you could be killed for a Christian but now Satan comes saying he's a Christian in the in the false preachers amen they're going to be saying peace and safety through God the the pope will sit in the temple of God saying that he is God now thank God we'll be enjoying a three and a half year man supper the lamb during that timej thank God we W have to worry about that but it's slow holy building it's building towards uh the Roman Catholic church and the uniting of church and state again with Rome right it's building like that Hallelujah so what is our protection our protection is the word of God Amen the only wall that you and I have is the word of God to protect us from showing the wrong emotions now there's a quote you remember brother said this in the in the Seven Seals I was just reminded this while I was studying brother raham said if if your soul is sealed by the Holy Ghost Satan cannot get to you because you're sealed by the Holy Ghost but really it's any believer Satan can't make us do anything right says we what we have to do if we sin we have to leave the protection of the word of God Satan can't come into us but what we do is we get tempted and we go out to him and we yield to him just like brother said about Eve brother said God gave Eve the greatest protection the word but she went out from behind the word of God and that's when she got attacked she had no walls of protection as long as she she would have said God said thou shout not eat as long as she said that God said don't eat as long as she said that she was she was safe but as soon as she started questioning that she got out and the walls came down right and now look what look what we have here look look at the world today and this was I think I'll just lay this in here this was the question brother Urban had why did lot even uh offer his daughter to these Wicked sodomites and you know I had that question before and I don't remember how I answered it but I was kind of like Lord you know I just kept talking all of a sudden the Bible the the Holy Spirit I felt reminded me of the scripture he was a vexed man that means tormented he and the Bible said not just once in a while every day he was tormented and brother called him a penny while Abraham was a silver dollar right amen so God could do a hundred times more with Abraham than he could with lot and so the reason he offers his daughters because he was not a very good man at that point he was just barely saved the Bible said the righteous that were scarcely saved yeah he was just barely saved what kind of dad would do that a an awful day so show he was in a moment of fear he was already in a state of Torment his walls were down church amen and when your walls are down when your emotions are shot or when your mind is shot you might almost say anything you might do anything but said remember last week I was just ready to tell God I won't serve him then but then he said thank God the anchor held Hallelujah I was just about ready to say I won't preach then but thank God that anchor was there thank God the the Holy Ghost was there in my soul praise God Amen I was just about ready to do something but God stepped it and the church said well see that's why lot could do things like that because he didn't have that real Holy Ghost anchor that's right that's excellent question he gave us he was a saved man but yet he was a man full of vexation and torment think about that demon powers tormenting everything he saw was homosexuality and aggression and uh awful mobs and gangs doing awful things that's all he saw and he was just overwhelmed with this barely saved barely and remember his home life wasn't any good either so wonder what was inside of his home hey brother Dennis just preached out aan I wonder what was in lot's house the angels are like lot like come on in angels's like no I'll sleep on the street when was the last time you wanted to sleep sleep on the street so what kind of house did this guy have wonder what was hiding in there yeah but finally you know he persuades them they come in he said you better go get your your son son-in-laws and your daughters tell them the city's going to be destroyed I just thought that was really something so his home life wasn't very good he was uh tormented daily and brother said we want to live in a way where angels will want to come into our home Hallelujah didn't the angel visit uh Abraham praise God he ate some calf and he ate some butter and milk Hallelujah drank some milk he lived in such a way where the Angels could visit him church we will we should expect angels in our cars am we should expect angels for sure in this church H amen right if we could if we could ever get spiritual I would think it' be right here don't you right don't got any Temptations in front of you right hallelujah amen I would think if there's any time we could be spiritual it'd be now Hallelujah right Amen in the presence of God remember the Bible says Angels strengthen Jesus right Hallelujah when someone gets the Holy Ghost what happen wrestle with the angel hallelujah amen so we receive Str in the service if we rece receive strength here it was the angel of the Lord hallelujah amen this is us amen amen hallelujah but we got to have walls of protection we got to keep out the demon powers amen praise God got to have our emotions in check I'm only going to get angry if it's a holy anger Hallelujah I'm only going to get happy if it's happy about Jesus amen or good things in life you know what I'm talking about like my children and my family Hallelujah and you know H and I were talking after last Wednesday service and she's like Daddy that's a good illustration of a wall we're talking about how you build a wall right one brick at a time my friend Z know Seth ainson he's a he's a brick mason you remember Seth ainson Zion he's a brick mason I've seen him you just barely driving by you know they lay the brick on there they get all this uh concrete make it all sharp next one on the next one on the next one just one at a time and that's how we build walls right one day at a time amen why you be like this one hour at a time amen we had a difficult morning well let's make the afternoon a time where we Can Build That Wall praise God Amen let's get that protection back up I'll tell you God's a really fast Builder too amen hallelujah if he's a fast Destroyer he's a fast Builder hallelujah amen Jesus said destroy this body and in three days I'll raise it up hallelujah amen it took us 48 years to build this he the Bible say he spoke of the Temple of his body he can build back better hallelujah amen this is ation says they're building back better no no no they're not God builds back the best hallelujah amen God can build you up so quickly just like Samson right you can go from a blind state of slavery feel like God's A Million Miles Away just a couple words of prayer and the presence of God falls on you praise God get your strength back Hallelujah get your vision back Hallelujah get your calling back amen amen that's right that fast God Can Build You Back you can you got to protect ourselves right we must protect our human Spirits from lust passions anger greed self-pity depression fear Pride doubt perfectionism one time a sister came up I always appreciate that sister I preached that sermon said these women are so worried about a SP and span house that it becomes an idol I'll never forget this sweet sister come up there and and just cry and said I was you know I'm so focus on having a perfectly clean house and she's got I think five or six or seven kids I have to look next time and she's like I always yelled them before church why don't you get it clean now imagine that's the spirit people are bringing into the message Church mom just yelled at us and pulled us over the rails and red us over the coals you have this clean you have this clean and she comes up weeping and saying I realize now this this Fick and span has become an idol in my life now let's not take it the other way where you can live right right all messy all the time right but I just appreciated the I appreciated the honesty of this sister and I kind of knew her on a personal level yeah you know I thought wow I was humbl you know that that this person could recognize wow I'm yelling at my children my walls are down and one little uh one little let's say uh sock that's not in the the basket she gets attacked by that and blows up right the city had no protection m little arrow of a dirty sock on the floor one one one uh let's say one one spilled food on the table makes you blow up just just one yeah just one I thought that was inspiring it was inspiring to me like wow Lord help me to examine my life and make sure I'm presenting the right thing amen that I protect my emotions amen now I do admit sometimes on the drive to church I wonder why these people drive so slow on Sunday morning and is it the devil doing that to me sometimes Wednesday night right sister sometimes I wonder if the devil trying to get me upset and I have trouble sometimes with that but I say God forgive me God forgive me and so uh you know i' I've just seen this in my life and I've shared this before you know if I get in the if I'm and I get in the scrolling of Doom they call it right I'm just tired and I just scroll scroll scroll if I'm wasting time what I found is that if I pray repent ask for a scripture if I quote the scripture and then I write down tomorrow I will not waste time on my phone I'm very likely to overcome I've seen that in my life I'm a witness of that amen you know what the scripture is redeem the time because the days are evil amen amen that helps me many times but but many times I won't uh or many times it helps the most if I write it down and I got it right there you know why cuz you're a miniature Creator that's why right is that what brother brother Dennis said that remember he said aren't you manyi creators how many manyi creators we got in there got a lot of creators in here you can create the right atmosphere Hall you can do it right now amen amen agree with the word obey the word amen say what the word says hallelujah amen so I find it like that in my life too i' got to repent and then get a scripture and build the wall build the wall build the I'm not getting about this not but that's that something that's like a that's a natural thing of what the spiritual that's what God is saying build the wall of our minds amen amen in other words build up so much peace in your heart that nothing can take away the peace away uhhuh amen hallelujah build up so much joy in your life that the devil can't take your joy M Church said amen Build It Up Build It Up strong you know he's you know the devil's going to come back at some point with one of his imps right some type of Temptation he's going to come back there's a time and season he's going to come back so we got to build the wall build strength build build through the word of God well I know the devil's going to come back uh now he's going to try to come back and and bring that certain person I know he's going to bring that certain song or that certain uh website or that certain restaurant I know it's going to come back to that certain person so let's build a wall let's get ready for it reminds me of Ahab remember the Bible God told Ahab I just flipped through that this week God told Ahab the enemy was coming and he said you better get ready and the first time he got ready I think the second time he didn't take heed to it what a perfect lesson I'll have to preach that maybe next Wednesday by God maybe Sunday we'll see but we know that enem is coming so let's get ready to defeat him praise God amen amen so I will not waste time on my phone I will not speak angrily to my mom or dad or siblings Etc I will not steal I will not lie I will not waste my time because I'm strong in the faith right now am I'm putting up walls to protect me pray always I'm always telling the truth I'm I'm not going to uh uh not I'm not going to uh exaggerate that's the word that's sometimes I'm guilty of exaggeration like brother my wife can say Amen to that U my family PR is all sayen that I just get going and I just I just exaggerate and I've got to say Lord I'm not help me I'm not going to exaggerate I'm tell exactly what the truth is amen so I see I'm like brother Rand in that manner brother said he battled with exaggeration Hallelujah now if you got your Bibles uh let's go to 1 Corinthians 3 6 1 Corinthians 3:6 I want to read a few things um with this emotion the emotion of adoration just Str me sometimes church we admire people in the message so much don't we I have I've admired preachers so much and then as I've shared with you now I see some things I don't admire so much but the emotion of adoration I'm sure you feel it here too I'm sure you appreciate people's testimonies you really admire them but we must always be careful not to make that adoration too high the Bible said give honor right but we can't give too much honor praise God there's a reason I'm sharing this so I want to read the scripture first I'm just to tell story I have planted Apollo's water but God gave the increase verse 7even so then neither is he that planted anything neither he that water but God that gave the increase amen okay so we're seeing preachers or teachers or whatever it is pastors prophets evangelists the Bible said they're all Planters and Waters but they can't make anything grow right they they have a certain job but they can't bring life only God can bring life amen so anybody ever gets life it's not the preacher's reward it's God's work amen the preacher just did the natural thing that had to be done right verse eight now he that planteth and he that WTH are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor okay so here we can see uh oh now go to Romans uh 123 Romans 12:3 and this is a real life example I'm going to share as well theemotion of adoration we got to control that for example here's another one too this is not the one I'm going to share but some people admired brother R so much that when they found out he was a human they left the message they call him all these names right so that was too much adoration a lot of it was ignorance now that proves the people really didn't listen to brother brand right right because if you listen to brother BR you know he's a human right because he says it all the time right but that's one example too much adoration right Paul saw he said I'm glad I baptized none of you in Corinth because you would have baptized you would have said I baptized in my name see it's just common Christians have to battle the emotion of too much adoration like I told you that example from Columbus that brother ComEd up we had three people healed that service two or three I'm okay don't exaggerate we had two or three people heing that I know the mom and the son were healed Daren and and beatric were healed in that service at least two and the brother come up and he said I think he told my wife what is it like living with this man Jesse that's a little too much adoration well a couple of years later now he's making fun of me because I got a big family so he surely lost that adoration in the process of a few years but I remember that I remember in the parking lot when he said that what is it like to live with this G talking about me but it it's now he was a young believer and he KN and he knew and by our conversation he did not have the Holy Ghost so something to keep in mind right this emotion when people overly adore people Church it leads to a lot of trouble anytime your emotions are not in check the walls are down and you're open to anything any attack to be ins snared to be taken by Satan at his own will because you and I might have given into it for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to but to think soberly as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith now this is course speaking of ourselves right but so we must not think highly of ourselves well like Paul said here we shouldn't think too highly of preachers either okay now the story I want to share is actually uh close to our church in one way but I was listening to a preacher preached and uh he was talking about emotions and uh and in this sermon numerous times I'm trying not to exaggerate so help me Lord numerous times he talked about his Pastor he was really admiring his Pastor just brought up his Pastor numerous times during the sermon how much he admired as pastor and then fast forward a couple years the pastor up and leaves the church and the pastor didn't show this brother any love well according to him that's what he told me because I talked to him personally about it I talked to him personally and I I know what I'm talking about this pastor didn't show this brother any love and it destroyed the preacher where he couldn't even preach or go to church for 5 to 10 years and this a man who says he had the Holy Ghost my wife and I have seen God use his gifts to discern our family situation I'll just say it like that it's as if he preached this family member's entire life right right in our church but think about that do you hold anybody too high that if they fell or they left or they didn't say exactly everything perfect to you would you fall away out of church and go into plain depression he told me he said I could could and then when I went to church I couldn't say Amen to anything for 5 to 10 years how much praise did the devil take from that man that should have went to God and we're supposed to be Kings and Priests unto God right this man lost is just tring me now this man lost his entire Priestly Ministry said he couldn't even pray right couldn't even study couldn't even read the word of God because of too much adoration for one man see why we don't put too much adoration on people please don't lift me too high if you've been around me you won't you been around me more than five minutes you w because I'm just a human just a man and just like that told that the guy from Columbus he found out later I'm just a man and they can mock me and make fun of me to my face you know mock our family oh God has a way to get back with those people yeah the Bible said let the Lord have Vengeance vengeance is mine say the Lord God has a way to strank his children if they're really God's children I didn't say nothing I almost did I almost texted but I'm say they want I'm proud of my family in a Godly wayen not you know over overly admiring them but so let this be a lesson a man who preach and God uses him we've seen it can so highly Place emotions on I admire this person that when they get mistreated by that person they lose all their praise think about that what a snare and the only way to be hon only that was be honest and recover themselves and be acknowledge the truth that they put too much confidence in a man right and the church said amen amen or a woman right you might put it in your mom or your dad right or I can put it in my brothers they're preachers if I put so much adoration on people and yet when they fail me or or they God allows a mistake to happen I Lose My Faith and I can't even pray think about that you what what would keep you what would have to happen in your life to keep you from coming to church for 5 to 10 years I just thought it was really striking because I can see someone admire admire boast I love this I love this man and then when that person mistreats it you lose all your walls go falling down and then every attack comes in there every attack oh he never loved me there's no much love in the church these people have the Holy Ghost look at all these arrows he's taken I can't even praise God I can't even worship God I can't even preach anymore so let's be careful how we handle the emotion of adoration the church said amen amen again like I said many people have uh now turned on brother Rand because they had too much adoration it was just a a human adoration so Church what does the Bible say make Christ your example right the Bible doesn't say looking unto a brother brandom for your faith the Bible say looking unto Jesus for your faith or place anybody in there you want Pastor so and so evangelist so and so and then when I found out you know the pastor that left left that hurt this other brother that Pastor then lifted up another brother too high and then that brother let him down and he uh and he even uh he went to a mental mental depression uh mental breakdown that's what it's called and then wondered am I even called to preach to see church we got to be very careful how we lift up other people right how we admire them let's make Christ our example like I told this brother Denis he said it really helped him I I SED that verse after Jesus all those Miracles I think it was in Mark chapter 3 the next morning he didn't get up I'm sorry next morning he didn't sleep in he actually got up early to go pray and I believe it was to keep himself humble right he didn't say let's have a party let's celebrate they could have in those days they could have he said I need to go spend time with the heavenly father right and make sure my heart's in the right place amen and I told you Church my heartest battle last week right I didn't tell you this I'm actually told before but that older gentleman the man who left the message I was almost at the spot of asking him to be my mentor because I I watched him handle a situation I think I told you this a young sister in the church came up and and tried to take the microphone from him right in the middle of our altar call you remember that that's a long time that's 2017 remember that one and then I I I then I was back there in the office when uh he called her in and just gently spoke with her didn't rebuke her just say you know this was wrong and she starts crying and and he brought all this sweetness to the situation I'm like man this guy's really a pastor and I've seen the Miracles you know they had different Miracles um his mom was dying and he's in the he's in the hospital oh the mom had died she flatlined and he said Lord Jesus he said you can have my mama but not now he said Lord Jesus I call for a spear to come back right now in Jesus Christ's name and she'd come back instantly and Liv four more years now that's real Faith right there when was the last time any of you called for a spirit to come back after it already left you see I was about I was about ready I just wow I saw these gifts I saw this faithfulness I saw what it really handles good situations I was about to ask that person to be my mentor and then this thing happens with they leave the message speak all these evil things so what was it for me it was a learning experience for me don't lift people too high right right the greatest Mentor I can have is Jesus although sometimes without having a dad you know in my teenager years I wish I had a mentor right like there's something long in me sister knows what I'm talking about you know I just wish I had a dad there for I just never had him so I wish I wish I had somebody to talk to like a buddy to go to another man but God had to show me don't lift anybody up too high yeah am Let Jesus be my counselor praise God amen amen so we have to be careful we don't put too much emphasis on other people too much adoration I'm already at 8:00 I didn't this uh Mark 81 let's go here I'll try to go a little bit further here and of course I'm I'm I'm always advocating show honor the Bible said give double honor to those who labor in the doctrine so people really labor to preach the truth you should give them double honor but not I'll said well I guess not triple honor I just say like that got to say that don't get qu triple honor don't make it over an abundance admiration and honor because you're going to get disappointed right then the devil can break down your walls and shoot every arrow in there every lie and you'll believe it you'll struggle with it but we want to be faithful praise God Mark 81 in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat Jesus called his disciples unto them and saith unto them I have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat and if I send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from afar Hallelujah so here's another emotion Jesus SP compassion sometimes we don't see that in the message very much A lot of people aren't concerned about the poor they're not concerned about the weak right but Jesus clearly could feel compassion for people amen that's what we need Hallelujah we need to feel the compassion of the holy spirit amen for people that don't have food or people that are hungrier or in this case I mean they were people that probably had a living right but they were just in a spot where they're in an inconvenience they they're just not really close to food right they probably could pay they probably farms and Agricultural Society they probably had good families but they're just in a spot we a little down and out at that moment and Jesus has compassion on people who are down and out so let's ask the holy spirit is anybody down and out in our lives that we need to show compassion on it's a good question to ask our emotions should be just like Christ now does anybody know that at some point Jesus um told them they only came for him for bread does anybody remember that verse so there came a limit to The Compassion is what I'm trying to say see if I can find it real quick bear with me here anybody finds it let me know I'm looking up bread I'd like to be able to read it where uh it don't chop it up okay I have to look for it later here but uh I think you understand the story I Think Jesus fed the 5,000 a second time or 4,000 or 5,000 have to kind of Polish up on that story but he actually confronts the multitude how many remember that story and he says you're really only coming to me for natural bread so that gives a good balance Church we should feel compassion but after a while it's time to start calling up some accountability right I think I shared that with who did I share with brother Brooks yeah I sure with brother Brooks on the phone we were talking there right before uh Christmas Jesus said if a tree hasn't brought forth in three years he said one more time dung it up right give it one more year and then after that if it doesn't bring forth then get rid of it so brother's like yeah that's right at some point The Compassion has to run out okay so just so you know we're supposed to be used but not used too much and the church say amen amen hallelujah so Bible said uh love your enemies pray for those who despitefully use you but even Jesus at some point calls out their hypocrisy you're only coming here for natural things you're not coming here for Spiritual things I know if I did a Google search I could just type in Jesus uh rebuke some multitude for wanting bread I know it would come up and I could read it there but all right one more let's we'll do one more got it who found that lyia bless your heart giv you two quiet class John 626 Jesus answered them and said very I say to you you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled he they wanted to they wanted to have food that's why they were coming to not for Supernatural not for the the word of God they're coming to him for food I've seen like this people that come like that eventually they'll leave the people that love God they stay for the word of God hallelujah might have to feed them for a little bit or something like that but they're going to catch the word of God they're going to love God's word with all their heart praise God Amen but the Bible says if you don't give food to the hungry if you don't give a Coke to a cold person your faith is dead but Church let's have Living Faith let's have the compassion of Christ hallelujah amen amen amen last one I think I'll stop right here by God's I didn't get to where I want to go so I think we're have a part three Lord willing next week by God's grace Luke 13 Luke 13:31 actually I'll do two more verses here the same day there came certain of the Pharisees saying to him get thee out and depart hence for her will kill you now look he's threatened with death he's got a death threat verse 32 and he said to them go ye and tell that fox and what's a fox Sly crafty animal brother said this is Jesus with the sense of humor so look at that the prince of God was on Jesus how do you know the fullness of God was in him amen when he received a death threat he responded with some humor other words I know where I stand Herod can't take my life he knew who was taking his life actually he dismissed his own Spirit the Bible say one one in one case said he died of a broken heart but the Bible said I dismissed my spirit so maybe that's they connected he said go tell that fox that slide crafty ruler behold I cast out Devils amen you can't stop the power of God and I do curse uh today no I do I got the wrong oh I do cures oh yeah I'm sorry I read that wrong the fox's too small and I do cures today and tomorrow and the third day I shall be perfected but God does allow curses that was I said that nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerus Jerusalem so he gets a death threat what's his next emotion humor sometimes church we do have to laugh off things I just gave you a Bible example right there sometimes you got to laugh threats off oh nothing's going to happen to me God's taking care of me nothing's going to happen to me my walls are built up and strong praise God God has me fortified by the Holy Spirit like like the Bible said who shall harm me hallelujah amen the Bible says if God's for me who can be against me praise God Amen and then he goes into this roller coaster of emotions it's a death threat no doubt he probably would have felt fear but he laughs it off and then verse 34 oh Jerusalem Jerusalem which kills the prophets and sest them that are sent unto to thee how often would I gather thy children together as a hen doth gather her root under her wings and he would not brother said this is the weeping prophet of Jeremiah Jeremiah wept over Jerusalem and Jeremiah was called the weeping prophet oh I'm sorry this is also David this is David when he was ousted out by Absalon David cried and he was weeping he lost his kingdom so look at the roller coaster of emotions Jesus goes from Fear laughing it off and then here he goes to weeping and crying because the people won't receive the word of God I offered it to them I preached it to them I lived it before them but they don't want it but here's a man who can control his City his City's protected Hallelujah those are all the right emotion God wants him to express God wants us to have that kind of emotion praise God compassion amen God wants us to have weeping God wants to have a good sense of humor he wants us to to rejoice and give thanks and be angry sometimes in hard Hearts God wants us to experience the Life of Christ hallelujah amen last one Proverbs 17 this my last verse proverbs 17:22 I think that humor kind of goes in with this scripture don't you think a merry heart doeth good like a medicine sometimes humor makes you laugh right don't makes you feel a lot better there's sometimes I just need a really good laugh right I'm just like I can't wait till I can laugh my head off I just want to feel I just want to feel all the pressures off again I love when I laugh so hard till I cry those are the best laugh but that word medicine means a cure or remedy a merry heart is the cure to your mind battle and the church said am catch that amen a happy heart happiness in God is the remedy for a broken Spirit find something you can be happy about right have a sense of humor I'm not talking about evil sense of humor but good sense of humor but a broken Spirit dth the bones dry means to wither doesn't that remind you of Psalm chapter 1 if we're planted by rivers of water our leaves do not wither am amen how do I stay encouraged how do I how do I stay strong and fresh and beating on the word of God be happy Rejoice it's medicine to you amen amen it's the cure being happy in God hallelujah amen have a dance service amen you don't got to wait till brother Jesse to call one you can have at your own house amen amen how many times have I done that praise God it's easy to have dance parties when you're on a snow day as well by God's grace I like to have on that day or when I get some good sleep but it clearly shows us having joy happiness that is the cure to mind battles and and uh mind that that the walls are down you want the walls back up get happy about God hallelujah amen maybe sing Lord Lord Lord You've surely been good to me hallelujah praise God and Bones is strength but a broken Spirit Withers your strength See the s attack us and we get so weak we can't even fight against him think think about all the verses you've heard tonight sometimes we get so weak you can't even remember one of them am I the only one that's going to say Amen on this one amen amen we get so weak and so tired we can't what what's one thing what's one verse I can use what's one song right we get so tired our emotions are shocked that but that's the Christian Life we got to be tested we we got to be tried Hallelujah and we've got to remember how to overcome we got to remember the we got to learn the cure for our lack of strength we got we got to remember the remedy for our mind battles hallelujah amen it's a merry heart no wonder brother says the Christian is the happiest person on the face of the Earth at least he or she ought to be Hallelujah that's my laugh and servant sometimes I listen to myself I'm like why am I laughing so much that's cuz I got the victory amen hallelujah amen I got the victory brother Ra's preaching in uh questions answers law having a shadow 1954 brother Ram says he said yet a little while and the world will see me no more that's the body of Jesus will be taken away but you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world John 17 that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now he will return return to his body again and will set on a literal Throne a man that will eat drink and Shake Hands Glory Oh mys Glory you can hear him he's happy Glory Jesus is going to eat and drink with us hallelujah how many know that by by God's grace amen he said I won't eat and drink again until I'm in my father's Kingdom a new Jesus is going to eat and drink in our presence and brother says glory amen don't you like when preachers get happy anybody like that or you like sad preachers which one do you like who likes the sad one no don't raise your hand he said Glory oh that you say you're too emotional brother why this makes you emotional you can't hold yourself when you think of it hallelujah amen that's why I think I'm happy all the time because I'm reading God's word read these quotes from Brother R go right back and forth how can you not be happy when you meditate on God's word hallelujah amen amen you're too emotional brother Jesse well that's what happen to you that's what the word of God does you it brings medicine to your human mind hallelujah thank God Hallelujah how can you stand in a ball game or something like that real well you fisherman how could you get a great big bass about five pounds and oh that big grin everybody ever seen a smiling Hunter they're sitting right they're holding those they're holding the uh the rack of the deer I said a new Ohio record or a big fish with those big muscles brother Compares that to being a Christian sure something's happened when you really get saved and fill with the Holy Ghost something happens when the word of God begins to manifest for we're sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit teaching us and guiding us and setting us in order what a wonderful time hallelujah amen let's stand to our feet Hallelujah musician can come thank you Jesus you're too emotional brother Jesse that's what the word does that's what the word does to me and now you got a good reminder that's the medicine that's the Cure if your emotions are out of whack repent start worshiping God get the joy back and that will heal your broken spirit amen the joy of the Lord remember Church you are really saved let's say that can we say I'm really saved ready I am really saved let's say I really have the Holy Ghost let's say that I really have the Holy Ghost speak it hallelujah amen said that should make you emotional amen glory amen hallelujah I'm really saved amen I've really got the Holy Ghost I've got eternal life in
