few announcements this Sunday we are doing officer voting I think I've said in text everybody on that yesterday by God's grace so just keep that in mind for Sunday we'll also have two services this Sunday by the grace of the Lord those are our announcements prayer requests the little boy in my class he's still having these migraines let's keep praying for him his mom's gonna take him to get an MRI he was sick well he was fine all day today but then he threw up right at the end of the day so mom's really concerned about him let's pray that God will touch this child here and they're not sure what's wrong that's God to be merciful praise God also one of my college teammates his wife put a Facebook post up and and I haven't talked to him in years but I just told him on the on the Facebook that we pray for him the baby had one of those what are they calling on you when you scan the baby inside the womb I'll ultrasound that's right I don't want to say the wrong word that's like forgive me yes can we come over that medical term there anyways my friend's name is Brad then the baby is a boy but they said there's there's some trouble with the internal organs I think it's missing some of the organs or something like that and so it's only the baby is only expected to live a few hours after birth they said they're gonna take a full term because and she said they're praying for a miracle so I thought that was really wonderful and at the family siding with life so I told just the friend on Facebook that we would lift their baby up and pray so we know God is able let's ask if it be God's will to honor their faith to have that baby so just let's pray for God's will to be done you know think of my little nephew you know he he was born with a little hole in his heart and then my brother brothers prayed for him and in God closed up that hole didn't have to have any surgery so this this would be a bigger miracle than that but with God all things are possible praise the Lord any other prayer requests tonight by God's grace Esther amen we could thank the Lord for that a phrase the Lord very happy about that praise God II meant unspoken for sister Connie let's keep that in prayer Karis alright sweetie I'm gonna definitely pray for that sister Naomi okay we'll pray for that by God's grace I appreciate the update on that that's good good to know praise God any other needs

there's a channel between us and you Lord as the scripture says that we have access to the Father through Jesus Christ we come to the great High Priest the Lord Jesus Christ through the blood of the high priest we're trusting in the power in the blood dear God to cleanse us and make us pure as we ask these requests or the Bible said with everything give thanks Lord God make our requests known

hearts encourage them Lord God and father be magnified and all that said and done Lord the remainder of this service may have first place in our hearts first place in our minds in Jesus Christ name Amen amen praise now let's think our Bibles here we'll go to Revelation chapter 7 like to continue this revelation series and we'll start at verse 1 revelation 7 verse 1 [Music] revelation 7 verse 1 doctor read verses 1 1 to 4 by God's grace ah read verses 1 to 3 and then we'll all read verse 4 together Deborah Scott oh praise the Lord God let's give him around flowers good to see you brother Lord last year good to see you sir god bless you what a surprise hallelujah first one and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and that interesting and angel carries the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that interesting I can't explain that one yet but that's what the Bible says and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads that's all reading verse 4 ready one two three and I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel amen may God has blessings reading of his word may be seated praise Lord I like to it's got a few slides here I like to show Lydia I'll probably put them up here in just a minute so we're going through I think this is part eighty five on the book of Revelation series so we're going to keep pressing on through I like to preach the whole book of Revelation the Lord willing and appreciated the inspiration the Lord has given me so let's continue looking on there we finished last week looking at the sixth seal by the grace of the Lord and let's keep moving on here into Revelation chapter 7 and we will continue on you love the Lord tonight amen it's good to sing to the Lord good to worship and the beauty of holiness the Bible says so thank God so let's look here tonight and we'll look be looking at Israel of course if you know the message verses one to eight is Israel there's two thoughts on verses nine to the end of the chapter some people believe it's the foolish virgin some people believe it's the bride Lord willing we'll look at that on Sunday I believe it's the bride myself there's three quotes her brother Branham says it's the bride there's one quote where he says the foolish virgin so I just think I think from the evidence in the scripture it's the bride but tonight Lord willing we're looking at the hundred and forty-four thousand praise God so let's look at verse one again we look at the first three verses here and we'll get started by the grace of the Lord now here we have the angels command here in verse one two three again now we read this last week a little bit we've kind of been building up and last week we showed all the events that have to take place under the sixth seal there's many many events many of week we can place together chronologically and some we don't know for sure we don't for example we don't know if we'll see the building of the third temple or not we're not quite sure one thing's for sure if we're in the bride we won't see Moses and Elijah thank God we won't see that because they'll be interrupting nature right they'll be turning water to blood they'll be causing it to not rain for three and a half years the Bible says there in Revelation chapter and of course we won't see them slain we won't see that rapture but one thing we'll do perhaps we will see the Lord Jesus at the marriage supper of the Lamb amen and then somehow some of us may see him slip down where the BAM said he has to slip down for a little bit at the end of the marriage supper and come down and reveal himself to the 144,000 that's what we're looking at here tonight by the grace of the Lord now I want to just emphasize again verses 1 2 & 3 how the earth cannot be hurt until after the 144,000 are sealed by the baptism of the holy God in other words they below until the 144,000 are borned again in one day the Bible says talk about a glorious day this is very reminiscent of the day of Pentecost praise God where 3,000 were saved the Bible said souls were added so we don't know if all 3000 were born again or just saved but souls were added because we know when someone's justified even a foolish version they're saved when they really believe and they have justification the Jesus says they're passed from death unto life amen remember Jesus told the foolish virgins in Matthew 25 he said he said they were surprised on the day of judgment but he said come on in enter in unto the joys and I prepared for you from the foundation of the world so Jesus loves the bride which is that chosen remnant out of the garment but Jesus also loves the raiment as well praise God he loves every part of the garment he loves all his children praise God so we see this here that that God is not going to allow the trees to be hurt in verse 1 the earth or the sea until after 144,000 people are born again I remember last year I looked up Israel's population it was about 7 million and I did the quick calculation of 144,000 of 7 million and it was right at 1 percent so about 1 percent now that's that's just right now right the we know the population may grow but it goes to show again how this this this little remnant is such a small group of Israel right Israelites right it's just a very small group because right now there's many Muslims that live there many Jews even a small group of Christians I lived there but the 144,000 faithful Jews will be a very small group no doubt the words of Jesus remind us even of his words for the little flock fear not little flock it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom amen it's a very small group of Jewish people that are actually faithful there's many many Jews but there's very few that actually faithful to the commandments of Jehovah now look at verse 1 and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree now if you got your Bible just turn over to chapter 8 verse 7 i I think I referenced this last week but I just want to bring it to your attention again under the first trumpet after the seventh seal is broken which we know brother man said is the day and hour of Jesus is coming the seventh seal is Jesus Christ returning to the earth at that mysterious unknown day an hour and that's when the silence is I'm sorry heaven is silent for half an hour they're silent brother Branham says he says where is that big fellow anyway that big fellow left heaven and he come down to the sky to meet his bride in the air head that's where he's at amen and that causes all heaven to be silent they stop singing they stop praising man so they stopped their altar worship he said they stopped all that service because the body of Jesus Christ comes down to the sky to meet his bride in the air amen and after the seventh seal then the judgments are falling so verse seven revelation 8 verse 7 and the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up so see we we see under the first trumpet that trees 1/3 of the trees are burned up and remember the voice said in chapter 7 hurt not any tree until the 144,000 are sealed so we see the trumpets have to sound after the one day when 144,000 are born again the same Holy Ghost that you and I say we got hey then hallelujah and the program said if they got the same Holy Ghost they'll act the same way you and I do amen oh yeah that's exactly right amen now look in verse 2 in chapter 7 verse 2 you go back to chapter 7 verse 2 and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of God in their foreheads praise God so we see that the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Jews is called the seal in the forehead so you're gonna see that in other places in the book of Revelation that's that's just a figurative to the frontal part of the brain which is where the judgments and decisions are making I haven't preached on that in a while whether Scott would probably be able to give us a much better less than on that but I know the judgments and all your decision-making is in the frontal part and so the Bible likens the Jews receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost to having their foreheads sealed in other words their judgments are God's judgments amen and that's what our should be praise God that's right we should judge the same way Christ would judge because we've got Christ's spirit inside of us amen because Jesus didn't polish ed he said don't you know the Saints shall judge the earth so in one way the baptism of Holy Ghost in our soul is is in our soul but it's also symbolic of our foreheads or our judgments being solely based upon God's judgment amen in other words every evil thought you bring it into captivity you take it into captivity to the Lord Jesus Christ and you cast on anything that exalts itself against the word of God and that's how you judge the Word of God Amen that's right you cast out anything that exalts itself against the Word of God alright now that's verses one to three now in verse four we start getting into these twelve tribes here now remember I shared this pretty surely others day and it was may last may appreciate Leah Leah loved of the Lord and she definitely was loved to the Lord praise God although not loved by Jacob at first she was eventually loved by Jacob but always loved by the Lord and so you see the 12 sons you see Leah had four okay and then it's a car and Zebulun come out and then Dinah and then lead a servant you have gad and ashur and then Rachel's servant Billa had two and then Rachel had two a Joseph and Benjamin there at the end and so the Bible said that Leah and and Rachel built the foundation of Israel so mothers take courage tonight I've just rehashed that message a little bit your purpose is so important you're building not Israel you're building the bride of Jesus Christ amen and my mom doesn't even really you know it you know cuz she's still in denomination cuts her hair and wears pants and wears makeup and all those things but she was building part of the bride of Jesus Christ as well even I believe that my faith amen that's what I believe training us and teaching us the word dragging us a church as much as she knew she was trying to lay those foundations foundational blocks we'd say in our spiritual lives and so the Bible said that that Leah and Rachel laid the foundation of Israel they built the house of Israel amen so sisters your your work is extremely important praise God and God sees you as building his bride amen now for those of you know I think I shared this last summer I think I was preaching on Revelation chapter 4 and I just rehearsed this briefly and we'll just briefly rehearse this as well the twelve sons of Jacob are listed there and from the Genesis 35 account now colored the ones that change so Levi and Joseph were in the first group but then in numbers they come out and Levi and Joseph are subtracted and in their place are Joseph's two sons Ephraim and Manasseh of course Levi was separated under the priesthood I'm not sure why Joseph was take enough if you know after that you can tell me after service and give me a good lesson I'm not sure why Joseph was taken up but his sons are placed in and then I put the asterisks of course by Ephraim and Dan because they were they introduced themselves into idolatry they let idolatry come into their tribe and because of that God blotted their name out from under heaven now this is amazing that God blots their name out from under heaven but then later God restores their tribal name later in the millennium night that meant to me all that says is God is a God of Amazing Grace God sees that they're given to idolatry somehow forgives them and then in the Millennium he restores their tribes back to their tribal order now church I don't know about to you but now make a shout and say thank you Jesus amen because he's so merciful and he blacks out their names on the earth but not in heaven now that's amazing that we see from our text that we're getting to tonight that in Revelation 7 so this is the group these are the tribes that are represented on the one day when Jesus Christ bursts 144,000 believers into who say his final part of his body right because they since they have the Spirit of Christ they've got to be a part of the body of Christ so he finishes off this last part and now we see that manassas there he stays there and then we see that Ephraim and Dan are missing and then Levi and Joseph are back in because of what Ephraim and Dan did I'm not sure why I followed Manasseh the whole way I'm not sure why I made him yellow I'm not sure about that I kind of forgotten so forgive me so this is the group that's going to be filled with the Holy Ghost sometime soon now we don't know when I think it's foolish to start guessing you know you see people do it all the time on Facebook or from different pulpits and things like that they try guess 40 years and 80 years and 70 years everybody's guessing the thing to do is not guess the thing to do is spend more time getting ready praise God we don't need we're not the ones who are gonna make God's clock tick at the right time we're not it's not our clock we don't have to worry about that clock we've just got to make sure our lives are ticking correctly praise God and that we are getting ready and that we're we're ready when he comes by the grace of the Lord but I think it's foolish to try to guess it and do those things unless we feel absolutely led of the Holy Spirit and then if we're letting the Holy Spirit we won't be wrong we'll be right but I think that's a dangerous thing to do most of time because people are just maybe trying to draw attention or get people to fear you know to try to motivate people to be ready for the rapture by fear we got to be motivated by faith we got to be and faith ultimately works by love amen faith which worketh by love the book of Galatians says so Levi Joseph get back in for this 144,000 coming up here very shortly we think we believe and then in the Millennium what happens is Dan and the Ephraim come back so strange and then Levi Joseph go back out and you still have Manasseh I'm not sure why I left that yellow but must have been a reason for so just to kind of reiterate that from Genesis the numbers Levi separated the priesthood Joseph's two sons are placed in so they take it out to the Ephraim are removed due to idolatry and then from revelation Ezekiel they get back in the numbers ten order there they're travelling order so striking isn't it a striking that that that God blots out their names under heaven but not in heaven but then Jesus says all those who are faithful he will not blot their names out of the book of life so Jesus even makes it seem like a little more serious for the Gentiles in other words we've got to not let anything get in our way we can't let anything distract us from from the goal the goal is to be faithful the Gulf to have a clean white robe amen that's the goal be faithful and keep the works of Christ unto the end amen that's the go if not the names get blotted out brother Brown set an example of that as Judas his name was on the book because he was he was proclaiming that besaid he was proclaiming to believe but yet he did not believe he transgressed and because of that programs that his name was brought it off the book of life oh my so the book of life is a great mystery it's a great teaching it's a great understanding and we've got to have our names on the book by God's grace amen hallelujah now idolatry I want to look at a few things on idolatry just for a moment in the church age book brother Branham goes through on page 296 and 271 I'm just gonna read a few portions of that I didn't have time to get all the quotes up there on the slides so I'm just going to read a little bit about that idolatry to kind of remember a remind us of what happened now in Deuteronomy 29 16 to 20 God gives a warning about idolatry and says their names will be removed he says this he says the Lord will not spare him but then the anger the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against the man and all the curses that are written this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven so that's the judgment pronounced now here's the one of the cases if you have your Bible you'd like to read it if you want to you can first kings 12 25 to 30 here's where the ears were F Ephraim builds an idol and it's spoken of here verse 25 then Jeroboam built sheet gem in mount ephraim and dwelt there and went out from thence and built Penuel and Jeroboam said in his heart and how shall the kingdom return to the house of David if this people go up a new sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of his people turn again unto their Lord even under Ray jabón king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to Rhea boom king of Judah whereupon the king took so made two calves of gold and sending them it is too much for you to go up to Israel to Jerusalem behold thy God's o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and he set one in Bethel and the other one in dan I'm sorry put he and Dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan now church there's a good spiritual lesson there can anybody see the lesson in order for this king here Jeroboam to keep the people coming to him he had to create idols and these idols made the worship easier on the people and it changed the provided place where God put his name so it made it easier you don't have to travel all the way that long distance to worship I'm going to make it easier on you and I'm going to give you a different way to worship let me know that God's ways are not always the easiest ways help me know that we often must choose the harder way remember a few weeks ago when we preach on brother Rams reward through Danny Henry remember what the voice said because you've chosen the easier way is that what it said no it said because you've chosen the harder way you've had two choices before you but I take the easy road or do I take the hard road and always the Christian has to choose the harder road the way that takes more sacrifice because God loves sacrifice amen and God knows to be like Christ we must suffer like Christ in order to have the character of Christ so see this is the way the Antichrist spirit work then and that's the way the Antichrist spirit will always work he'll always try to make life easier on the flesh but we know the true will of God the true path of God is always to do the perfect will of God and it's always to line up exactly a twosie everywhere every letter lined up with the Word of God and many times it's going to require some sacrifice from us amen oh yeah that's right church Satan will always try to say well if you just do this or just relax a little bit on this or don't be so diligent about this just take it easy on this you you worked hard enough you can take a little break and you don't have to obey this anymore just take a little break and you know and I know that's the lie from Satan and we've got to be able to recognize that and say God's Word says this and I've got to do this if God requires it then God's gonna give me the strength to fulfill it amen God is not going to ask me to do something I can't handle if God requires obedience he's going to give me the strength to do it and the strength comes from renewing your mind amen getting the right attitude towards that commandment praise God so Satan says well I'll make it I'll make the church closer the church will be closer they'd have to drive so far to church I like a closer church myself you know but I appreciate what God has done here by the grace of the little fleshly pleasures determine our our our decisions rather than what we know God has told us to do praise the Lord and of course we know the CAF's were introduced of course the calf was a calf can be a good symbol can at church the very god that says no symbols the very god that says don't make any image had one of the tribes carry a flag that had a calf on it right it had the the lion the calf the mane and the eagle the very God that said don't make any images had to cherubims right where he dwelt right between those two cherubs so see it takes a balance and we have to understand the ways of God and it could seem it could seem a little tempting well there's calf's there or there they've got some gold there we've got to make sure no matter what the world says or whatever Satan tries to present to us that that looks flashy that that looks tempting we've just got to do what God says we've got to find where God placed his name and God placed his name brother man tells us in Jesus Christ amen and Jesus Christ is the word of God amen so if you got any questions about God's Word or God's plan for your life you got to take it right back to the Word of God it must be found in the Word of God and it must be part of God's provide place of worship amen all right so that's just a little review there and then it said in Hosea 4:17 Ephraim his join the idols let him alone all right so that's just a little review there they set up idols and then God was very displeased remember the same thing happened with Solomon I mentioned that numerous times as we did the proverbs in ecclesiastes series but solomon started off good but then he let idols rise up in his lives with his life right he built idols to please his wife and we've got to make sure we don't compromise with anybody in our family those of us who are married we can't compromise if wife or husband as as may be a wrong attitude or a wrong idea we can't compromise with any sin we've got to stand upon the Word of God amen but see Solomon was filled with compromise as he got older he got more tired he it was more bata trying to fulfill the lusts of his flesh rather than please God even though he's seen God twice it didn't do a nut he he didn't stay close to God like he should have stayed close to God but we've got to cleave unto God amen we've got to cleave to the Lord we've got to stay true to the Lord we've got to keep running after God we've got to keep seeking God that's what denominations won't do that's why they're foolish they don't really seek the Word of God Church we've got to see God amen we've got to see God tonight say God speak to me tonight amen in your word I'm seeking your Widow I'm seeking the Word of God for my life amen see we've got to come to church seeking God seeking his face wanting to know his will asking God for revelation praise God now one time in 2008 I uh I was traveling out to Iowa just want to share just a little brief testimony about this idolatry thought and I was going to preach brother Brooks is his church that and that time they're having church in a hotel in 2008 and I've been I've been studying on this these thoughts about idolatry this was quite what ten years ago what how time flies but God knows my heart I when I flew out there all by myself I had my own hotel room I woke up that morning and in my in my mind the FIR thing I saw was the outline of everything I was supposed to preach I've never had this happen before and never had it happen since but I saw in my mind's eye I saw preach on this idolatry that that that I quickly wrote it down I went and preached it and almost everybody the church afterward was weeping and crying came up for prayer it was what a really long prayer line but at the end of that service one of the mothers came up and her daughter had gone wayward she gotten in the wrong profession and fell for a gentleman who was a sinner and we prayed together and I said based upon these you know things you've heard let's pray together we join hands and we prayed and she was crying I was crying and and we just believed that word we just believed what God had said we believe the Word of God that God had given to us that day and it was just about three years later that this daughter after being out in the world for three years all of a sudden returned back home and if she had a short hair but then within a matter of a year or so she grew back her hair out cleaned herself up and gave her heart to or was baptized and now is married to a minister and loves along with all her heart amen and that just rejoices my heart because the Holy Spirit gave me a message on idolatry and and then God vindicated it by answering many prayers amen and I was out there last time in Iowa last December actually about a year ago now from this year and one of the brothers even remember that sermon because he came up for prayer again and so God was really inspiring that in that sermon now I want to just look at a few of those notes if I can just flip over here I want to go over to that note yeah so I just briefly I don't expect people to read this or anything but I just wanted to brief a look at this but brother Graham said idolatry is a great problem today and you know the Bible says keep yourselves from idols and no eye doctor have any inheritance in the kingdom of God and of Christ that's really smart I don't want you to strain your eyes I'd have time to put this up there but but brother may have said idolatry is just as just as rampant today as it's ever been if Act is actually more prevalent today than ever has been and so I just want to look at a few of these thoughts Bramson everything begins in Genesis so even I had doubt or tregos Genesis Baretta has not changed is the same today he said the world is full of it now worship does just review this for a little bit his honor or reverence great respect honor and devotion a celebrity is worshipped by her fans and homage homage is something that shows respect or test to the worth or influenced them another you know this week I watch I'm a subscriber to the to the the Vatican's YouTube channel I don't know if you are but I wrote honestly keep your eye on the purple curtain so that's why I do it but this week the Pope prayed and I watched the video this week the Pope praying said mother Mary we pay homage to you today an homage means respect or worth or influence he said we pay homage to you and he said he said we ask you to protect our Vatican is basically what he was saying brother Graham said that's the highest form of spiritualism there's nothing more deep in witchcraft as that because they're trying to they say they're contacting God but it's contacting God they're not contact God that contacting God they're contacting demon spirits in the name of God in the name of God's Saints and so I just you know I just was reminded of that how they pay so much homage and he's got his prayer beads and he's reading office his script there you know like he does but you know we've got to be careful that that we give the right honor and reverence to the right things praise God we've got to give the right respect to the Word of God we got to give honor where honors do and that's to the Lord Jesus Christ amen now if we honor the Lord Jesus Christ will honor everybody else praise God we have to honor brother Adam says you know that message respects in 1961 he said I fear God he said because I fear God he said I fear my wife I don't want to sin against my wife he's not fear the community I don't want to cause anybody in the community to stumble he said I fear the church I don't want to cause anybody in the churches stumble so when you truly honor God and respect God the right way you'll respect one another that's right the ramesses idolatry is when you place worship on something other than God all right I'm gonna skip ahead now here's here's what I saw in my mind I'm not sure what number one was I thought there was like four or five things well I must have deleted it pardon me but the first thing I preached on was the brass serpent and that was any gift of God brother Brent and the Bible says after Moses used the brass serpent for generations and generations people the Israelites used that till finally in the days of Hezekiah it became an idol so the very thing that people used to really see as a spiritual help to get divine healing event she became an idol and so has it kind of broke that brass serpent hum remember that in the scripture he broke the brass serpent he stand he stomped on it he made it into powder and he threw it in the water the river Kidron I think it was because something that was good eventually became an idol and church you know we've got to make sure that we don't make any minister or we don't make any story of brother Branham we don't let that become an idol to us where we put more confidence in that than we do God's Word itself that's right any gift of God so the brass slipper it was a gift of God any gift of God it could be a preacher living today it can be anyone who has a gift of God any gift can become an idol when we place too much confidence in again if and not recognizing that behind the gift is actually the power and that's the Holy Spirit there's no power in a cloth you know a prayer cloth or whatever you would have or the preacher would wear and pray for it or anoint it there's there's no power in that now we respect that but it's not really that that cloth just give us something to contact praise God but the main thing we gather contact is the Holy Spirit amen are you with me Church and that contact comes through prayer amen that's the contact that's got to be made so we can't idolize you know anything else we don't want to I'll eyes anything we just want to get proper respects to the holy spirit so that's what I saw my mind I saw that and I preached the brass serpent and then the third thing I oh the Bible says that that they Paul said that they worshipped Apollo speak I was eloquent he's a preacher that never spit he's a preacher that never stuttered he never forgot the word ultrasound you know he was so smart he was so eloquent and that's obviously not me but Paul Paul was even contemptible which means the Bible said he his speech was contemptible so even though he was a scholar and he was weak in presence can you imagine a man like Paul so gifted of the Holy Spirit yet the Bible said his speech was contemptible it was least esteemed so Paul wasn't some perfect speaking scholar either although he wasn't used to be a scholar but RAM said he had to counted all dumb the Bible said he had counted all done in order to know Christ and then his bodily presence was weak so he didn't walk up to the pulpit as his big strong muscle man he walked up there real humble and real just weak he looked like he was a weak person he didn't look like a strong person and then remember he said Peter and all the ones they made they they said some say I'm of Apollo's or Peter or Paul and Paul said I'm glad I didn't baptize any of you because some of you would have said I'll baptize you're baptized in my own name oh my isn't that just like human a humanity Church how many see it in your friend they just want to worship something since they won't worship Jesus they'll worship something like I've coworkers they won't worship Jesus so they'll worship the Grinch they'll dress up like Grinch it and I've coworkers than that that they put they put that name on their on their name plate above their classroom they call themselves the Grinch they'll dress up like that they'll act like that though we're close like that they'll get all identified with that they're identifying with that but we've got to be identified with Christ amen though they worship at Halloween know that they dress up as a scary vampire something like that they're identified with that and they'll worship that they give that honor and respect they set that day aside but we've got to set aside more time for Jesus amen that's right the Bible said more as we see that Day approaching praise God now what I see often times I'm sure you do too is that people start off giving all they have to Jesus but then things of the world come in cares of the world come in and it chokes out their walk with God and the church said yeah amen that's all we know only see it pretty soon piers of the world start coming in and they no longer have that connection they no longer have that fertile ground of the heart to bring forth fruits unto God that's normally what we see you know because remember the first I'm sorry the the second ground that Jesus talked about the four grounds the second ground as it springs up really fast they get really really excited but there's no route to it right there's no route to it the Bible says we must be rooted and grounded in what love so they get excited about the word oh it's a new messages its newest news new but they don't really fall in love with the word praise God Oh church I hope you came because you fell in love with the word not because you're scared to go to hell not because any other reason but because you love Jesus Christ word Amen that's not we ought to come to church we love the word amen but see it springs up really fast and then they get offended that was the second kind the third kind it actually starts out pretty good but then cares of the world come in and choke it out and it can't produce the fruit of the Spirit oh my god help us the third thing I oh my just in my mind there just a vision just a picture of my mind I guess was brother branham is idle for many people brother Brahim said just like in the days of Elijah and John the Baptist people worshipped the the man of God they were all mistaken for the Messiah but we know every word has not thus saith the Lord from brother Branham and just to give you an update on that the jeffersonville brothers I sent them that email and I heard back from him so I tried I did my part I said I just want to keep you from idolatry I just want to keep you from saying every word as thus saith the Lord and make your brother RAM infallible cause program so that's an awful tommyrot thing to do but see that's the great temptation today that's the temptation around the messages to worship brother Branham it's either to get rid of them to speak evil against him or to worship him but Church there's going to be somebody that finds the right balance right down the middle praise God they're going to appreciate brother man under program but they're going to not exalt him above his position they're gonna recognize what he said when it was the sate the Lord they're going to be able to do that but they're not gonna worship him and put him above Jesus all their love goes to Jesus that's right amen and then I think the last one yeah the Librium said the last one is people make an idol of God himself and church this is the one we got to be careful of right cuz you and I are not gonna work sure I've never had any conversation with any of you saying well I believe every word he said was thus saith the Lord I'm willing to challenge you on that brother Jesse no one's ever Jeff everybody here's got real good spirits you would never challenge me on that but my ram says we can make God in Idol if we're not careful and here's how he does it let me see says he says many times I'm sorry many times we went to make an idol out of God we ask God to do something and then he must do it just the way we ask it or we'll say he's never answered when we do that we weaken our faith in God and I'm sorry that's so small when we do not take him at his word God always answers brother Branham says you know church one time I had a friend and they were praying about something they didn't get it and afterwards they said they hated God and church that's the that's the clearest example I've ever seen out of out of this making God an idol they asked God to do something and because they didn't God didn't do it they got angry at God now Church it's okay to be confused if God doesn't heal somebody are you with me it's okay that made me wonder and say well Lord I don't understand that it's okay to ponder and say well lord I don't know you know but we must say your ways are past finding out your ways are higher than my ways and as brother Graham said if God he said man said many times God doesn't tell me what he's going to do he said he said that's fine he said that's none of my business name how do ya know Church that's real faith in God when you can ask God say God do this please and then he does it and you say well praise the Lord God you give and take it away that's your business that's none of my business now you've got some real faith they know but if we get mad and make an idol out of God and seem to tell God well you did something wrong like brother man said you owe me an understanding he said God will leave you alone he said for a long time he's a God left over alone for I think was two weeks or two months I can't remember what Iran said God will leave you alone when you make an idol out of him look at that he said we built God as an idol he's got to answer just according to our ways or well it's just no good he didn't answer us he said God out answers in many ways he answers in peculiar ways times and everything is odd perhaps an unexpected time and that the truth unexpected place unexpected way but when he realized that it was God he held on to it see here's what Botero says this is when it God becomes an idol when our prayers become a condition we need that out at night sick or blessed so and so blessed own so do this help John do this you make God a mascot you make God some kind of errand boy God you do this you do that you do this that's not the way Jesus told us to pray he said to pray like this our Father art in heaven hallowed be your name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven but we try to order God what to do for us that's the reason the church is cooling off hallelujah so this I think was my last one as far as on that little picture I saw my mind the worst either we can do is to make God in Idol they can just a statue just do what I wanted to just do what I want you to do you're there for my benefit no church we're here for his glory we were made for his purpose praise God and we can't tell God what our purpose for our life is that's what sends people to hell right they do what they want to do instead of doing the will of God they're workers of iniquity they do what they want rather than what God wants I think it's a great thing if you and I can point to our the Bible and point to our lives and say I chose the harder way I chose the perfect will of God hey man that's a great victory because then program says you received the mystery of his will for your life hallelujah and I think that's about that's about the end of it yeah I saw those four okay thank you was that okay by God's grace I just want to pull that up from ten years ago well I've been preaching that long huh only by God's grace but preaching longer than that but anyways I remember that as I was preparing for the message now brother branham I've been listening to the met the sermon the last few weeks it's called the ten virgins 144,000 from 1961 and brother dam goes through revelation seven and then he makes his statement he said he was talking about a man who thought the 144,000 were Jehovah's Witnesses and I said yes sir but that's not the way that we're they're replaced see you called the 144,000 the bride which they wasn't they was the Jews so something like the Jehovah's Witnesses will say well there's a 144,000 of Jehovah's Witnesses and they believe that's under 44,000 of them now their numbers are up in millions and millions and millions but don't laugh at that because that's how we are we're the same way but we're not saying 144,000 we're just saying a small group hallelujah because everybody in the message the reason one of the main reasons they're attracting the message is because they know this is a rapturing message right they don't want to be left behind they know judgment is coming they can see the handwriting on the wall judgments upon this nation judgments upon this world so what attracts people is this idea of escaping the judgment and the church said they want to escape the judgment so we're very similar so so I don't look so much so bad on the job as witnesses we don't want to think bad of anybody but they've got a good thought there's a small number there's a predestinated number but only God knows that number amen it's not 144,000 who knows we don't know how many it is but there's a predestinated number and many people are gathering around this movement this message but only the elected only the four-note only the ones as brother man said in Christ the mystery only the ones that God foreknew would love him are going to go in the rapture amen oh don't you love Jesus tonight oh we need how we should love Jesus with all of our hearts amen so see they're not so far off they got a pretty good idea except they put a number on it and then they placed themselves in the place of Israel mercy and the one that was the dragon spurted water out of his mouth to make war with which was the remnant the leftovers of the woman see now that's at the end of Revelation chapter 12 that kept the commandments and had the testimony of Jesus and the bride was in glory see but RAM said the 144,000 the 14th chapter of Revelation was standing there on Mount Sinai that's exactly true having their father's name in their forehead that's exactly right the Jew the remnant of the Jews let's go to Revelation 14 you'll see another picture of this 144,000 because program takes us there in that message from I'm sorry 1960 Revelation chapter 7 it's almost 60 years to the day since he preached him I look at that December 11th interesting revelation 7 by revelation 14 verse 1 and I looked and lo a lamb stood on Mount Zion Mount Zion and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his father's name written in their foreheads and I heard the voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps high heavenly music going on that's like what remember sister Karen oh if I told you that was sister Karen said before her mom passed away last year she was sitting in the room with her mom and they heard angels singing in the room hallelujah so here people just got the Holy Ghost in Revelation 14 and angels are singing there's harps playing there's music Heaven's rejoicing amen hallelujah amen because precious and the side Lord is the death of his Saints when we die but when they get born again there's music playing to somewhere in those great heavenly realms oh thank you Jesus verse 3 and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man can learn that song but the hundred and forty-four and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth right these are they which were not defiled with women see they live pure for they're virgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were the redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto God and to the land I think about that there's three virgin groups on the earth today in there there's the wise virgin the foolish virgin and the 144,000 virgin and the church set program said God's always perfected in threes there's three virgin groups and and virgin member I mean it means it means no interaction it means no association no intercourse so these three groups on the earth are free from all intercourse with the things of the world they only intercourse with the word amen they only interact they only accept the word that's all they want is just the Word of God and there's three groups and you and I better be in one praise God we don't going to be the Israel unless they're somehow God's calling you back to Israel then you better get a plane ticket pretty soon but we got to be either the Wise Ones or we got to be the foolish ones a member they're only foolish to the Holy Ghost they just didn't get they didn't just die enough amen they just didn't die out and run enough but they were they were wise to everything else except the Holy Ghost but because of that Jesus said they're foolish Oh my church doesn't it seems sometimes that we need to just lay at the altar or lay at your seat or something like that how many no you just got to lay in prayer sometimes in your home you just got to die if you're not sure if you're wrestle with something how many know you just got to die out and rot amen see people that don't do that probably never died out and rot to get born again I don't know if you're like me sometimes I just got to die out and wrestle it out and wait till something changes you gotta lay there until you die out and run until God gives you some type of hope or revelation or some type of inspiration but a real child of God can die and rot and wait on thus saith the Lord hallelujah but the foolish virgin doesn't do that she doesn't die out and rot but BAM said go pray up she doesn't pray hard enough she doesn't go all the way in prayer she doesn't fully surrender to everything of the world does everything work to everything of her surrender cuz remember she's virgin to the world but she doesn't surrender everything to God and brother Aaron tells us actually in this message he the one reason she's not born again if she doesn't keep all the Word of God so she's virgin to almost every word of God but she doesn't keep a word and it obviously refers to being being uh dying to self in prayer and totally letting Christ flow into her life hey amen Oh hallelujah I like that verse three it's a song only they can sing you ever heard somebody sing a song that you know only they can sing there's a sister from New York and she wrote this song and when we went to that sisters meeting last year and she wrote a song and she was singing this song about how God was testing her because God told her to marry this man the man loved her but then the man left and she was alone for all these years raising her kids and she just kept praying for this man to come back her husband finally he came back but she wrote this song church that was about that struggle how God let her go through the struggle and every I and the place was weeping she could sing it now she can sing that song and somebody else could sing that song but the way she sings it is much more powerful because she's experienced it praise God and so see that's the same way it is here this 144,000 they can sing a song that nobody else can sing because they know what it was like to be blind and then to be able to see they were they were they were not a part of the life but then they got grafted into the life amen I was a nut I was not attached to the life but now they're attached to life you and I ought to say amen to that because before we were sinners but God grafted us into his the Holy life into the holy tree and was not a holy lobe amen the Bible says hallelujah you should look at your life and say well I was unholy but now I'm holy thank God he grafted me in amen thank God that I'm feeding off of the life the literal life of Jesus Christ I'm a branch and I'm attached by the grafting efforts of God the great vineyard keeper the vine dresser I'm attached to the life and fruits of the spirit are flowing out of my life are Floyd all these branches and I'm attracted I'm attached to his life and I'm manifesting the life of Jesus oh thank you for hearts my goodness church that ought to make us sing a song we ought to be able to sing amazing grace better than the denomination down the road hallelujah we ought to be able to sing these songs that's why I like that song holy holy holy because the Lord gave me the words to change God's not in three persons he's in one true person and I can sing that song with the new with a new love for it then all the saints adore thee he's Harley's holy and one day I'll cast my crown at his feet praise God we can sing that with with a different experience because we've surrendered to all the Word of God glory see these 144,000 are not defiled with women brother Ram tells us and they follow the lamb weather wherever they go and they redeem their the firstfruits under God and to the lamb so the firstfruits of Israel praise the Lord now like verse five the best and in their mouth was found no guile for their without fault before the throne of God look what the Holy Spirit produces Church the Holy Spirit produces you with representation what is it it's your theophany the Bible said the theophanies are there before the throne of God praise the Lord when you're born again your theophanies before the throne of God and the Bible says you're without fault before the throne of God Satan can try to accuse you a demon can try to accuse you but the Bible says when you're born again they can find no fault with you all your sins are under the blood amen if Israel is without fault before the throne of God how much more the bride of Jesus Christ right now amen oh I like that hallelujah because that shows the power in the blood of Jesus Christ amen now see his verses 1 to 5 and that's balarama mentions that he said in revelation the fourteenth chapter there you see it now isn't this interesting jerusalem has numerous mounts but the ones that are most famous or mount moriah and mount Smith's Bible dictionary I just copied this from a message I preached a few years ago I might have been in that other sanctuary it says of these two Mount Moriah and Mount Zion on the west syan is higher and more massive on which the city of Jerusalem now stands and in fact always stood the hill on the east Moriah is considerably lower and smaller so that to a spectator from the South the city appears to slope towards the east so I just thought this was striking this is just an illustration you have Zion and then it slopes supposed to slope down to the you know from the west to the east then you have Moriah now here's a here's a here's a physical picture of it Mount Zion now it's kind of a slope it's kind of hard to tell but can everybody see how it's kind of like a slope going down from from west to east here so we have the Temple Mount you have the Dome of the rock this is Mount Moriah and then you have Mount Zion Church if I was a Jew I would sell everything and I'd move and I'd move as close as I can to Mount Zion right there because the Bible says that is where Jesus Christ is going to meet with his 144,000 holy ghost filled Israelite children amen right there I'm outside the highest point the highest peak in Jerusalem that's where Jesus is going to meet with them amen that's after they've heard Moses and Elijah preach for three and a half years and after you see them killed and then resurrected and raptured and then after they see Jesus descend himself they're gonna meet Jesus right there on Mount Zion isn't a striking Church they know the physical place we don't know the physical place but we know the spiritual place we've got a meet in Christ amen brother Ham says that in the church in the questions answer 64 they say should we move out to Arizona should we be in jeffersonville Graham said I he said it just struck me I know where we got to be he said to be in the rapture he got one place to meet he said that's in Christ how do you so see it doesn't matter physically now you want to be in God's perfect will but the main thing to do is be in Jesus Christ but if I was a Jew I tell you I'd be right there nah well it was I on my the Bible said who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand by his holy place he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he should receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek Him that seek thy face o Jacob sail ah who's gonna send that he'll church those with clean hands and pure hearts those who don't get their hands mixed up in in bad things they don't they don't do the wrong things with their hands right those have a pure heart they know everything they've done they've confessed that they tried to make everything right with all their heart there's trying to seek the Lord and do God's pleasure do exactly what he wants them to do those are the people of Israel that will ascend to the hill the Lord praise God now I think I'm just going to close with this because it again just shows God's grace yeah I want to try to close here in a few minutes how many remember there's 24 elders around the throne ever remember that 12 of them were the 12 liters of the 12 tribes of Israel so let me close with this here you probably call it and one of them was Judah now Judah I'm gonna try to find some I'm gonna try to show you the good things and bad things about these men remember Judas tribe will be saved right twelve thousand of Judas tribe will be born again I just heard brother Adam say today he said they they have no papers on which tribe they're in he said but the same God that knows the hairs on their head knows their blood type in which tribe Aryan amen hey that's the loving God that we serve amen he knows their blood type he knows which tried they're in now Judah of course he's the fourth son of Jacob and Leah it was he who suggests the sale of Joseph to the Ishmaelite traders so Judas stood up for Joseph remember Joseph types Christ he made a touching and persuasive plea for the release of Benjamin and he could be released and later of course you know because Ephraim him Manasseh Falls Ephraim farm sorry Ephraim falls he seems to be exalted to the position of chief of the Brethren so I'm just gonna go these quickly he's very successful in war now later in a later church Judah member he lost a little bit of faith remember that and so he wouldn't give Tamar's daughter-in-law he wouldn't give Tamar you know the sudden to Mary and all these things so remember when take that I'll remember that by God's grace okay all right so you remember that and then we're at the end Judas says Tamar you're more righteous than I am I remember that so see Judah his tribe is going to be saved there in Revelation here we're coming up very soon but even he himself is one of those twelve sons of Jacob and so see he admitted Tamar was more righteous than him and of course he has good parts the Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah David came out of Judah and Judah member we looked at that a few months ago Judah went first into battle because Judah means praise Amen so I just say like this Judah will be there with the white robe in a crown as an Old Testament overcomer praise God even though his faith wasn't even me made a mistake there at church you're going to see with all these twelve sons of Jacob all of them had failures all they made mistakes but church they all overcame by the blood they all were overcomers and Jesus exalts him and assists them on a throne right around his own throne amen oh my just because they were pure they were pure in heart and had a clean hands hallelujah he'll be there the Bible says have a robe and a crown he'll be there Reuben now Reuben he wrong does this Reubens an example of sexual sin Reuben committed sexual sin against his father because he slept with his father's concubine Billa and because of that you know he lost his place there but also he stepped in to save Joseph he's the one that actually pleaded for his life was Reuben and so church we know Reuben will be there let me know the Bible said God can wash away all fornication all adultery or homosexuality the blood of Jesus Christ can wash that all the way a man Paul said such were some of you but you're saved you're lost you're justified in the blood of Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God amen Oh Reuben is an example of someone who struggled sexually but God cleaned out his life and made him an overcomer Hey thank you Jesus dad had seven sons seven sons of Jacob he's got a pretty good testimony I don't remember much about him oh yeah he was a his tribe was very warlike dad was a very faithful man he trained up all these war soldiers there's not much said about GAD he later were transferred his allegiance to David there in 2nd Samuel 8 but GAD will be there GAD will have a robe in a crown how many can say amen to that he'll be there Asher there's a little bit said about him not so much about his life but his offspring were powerful oh yeah he did this really good he informed his brothers of Reuben sexual sin against his stepmother Billa in other words he's the one that had the integrity to say this is wrong our brother slept with the Our Fathers handmaid that was wrong so what does it show Church he had a heart of integrity praise God he had a heart of integrity and the the rabbi writer said that his brothers reproached him but he's an example of a virtuous man with single mindedness who strives only for the general good I like that his family was so powerful look at his family he was blessed with the most male children of all the tribes his women were so beautiful the prince and I'm sorry priests and princes sought them in marriage the abundance of oil which represents the baptism because all his land possessed by ash you're so enriched to try that know them needed to hire a habitation the soil was so fertile in times of scarcity and especially in the sabbatical year Ashur provided all Israel with olive oil my church Asher is gonna be there how many can say amen to that that man's gonna be there a good man a man of integrity ray he did everything right god bless him with oil God blesses his daughters god bless his sons God honors integrity how many got integrity where you don't want to sin against God do you have that you know you don't want to take a day off and well maybe I'll take Friday night and I'll go do some simple things and I'll just apologize on Saturday morning the Bible said make no provision for the flesh the Bible said put on the Lord Jesus Christ don't plan out well I know on Sunday night after church I can go to this I'll be all alone don't plan that out don't make any provision for the flesh but put on the anointing put on the Lord Jesus Christ Asher did that he'll be there how did you Naphtali he's now all's it says about him there's not much about him he had a really good tribe but he's a Swift runner and he's the one that first came to jacob with the good news Joseph wasn't alive he was so happy to see Joseph was alive amen reminds me of those women how they ran and said Jesus is alive kind of reminds me of that but he'll be there not much on him Manasseh of course he had some awful things now he was provoked I'm sorry yeah I mean Manasseh was I'm sorry the older son of Joseph right and then that's when when Jacob switches hands and he gave the blessing to the younger so the blessing came on the Gentile through the cross of Jesus Christ right the cross hands so Manasseh represents Israel the older but having being subordinate under-under unto the younger or anything else I thought AHA died down there I think that's it oh yeah I'm sorry oh yeah now Manasseh became a steward in Joseph's house and acted as an interpretive when the letter talked to his brothers and possess extraordinary physical strength so he had a pretty good testimony actually I think I'm getting my sons mixed up there but humming oh man asks we'll be there by God's grace he'll be there Simeon Simeon the second son of Jacob by Leah oh yeah here's one he was one that associated with his brother Levi in the massacre of the sheet you might soar in the revenge of the defilement of dinah which Jacob didn't like in other words he's a violent man he got angry he got upset and he killed a man is that remind you of anybody Moses got angry and killed a man but you know he'll be there Simeon will be there by God's grace praise the Lord remember prophets remember there's something about prophets where they struggle with killing people Moses killed somebody Paul's right there holding the coats of people that killed somebody brother bran tried to shoot people and the church said everybody wait tonight I'll try to close soon stay awake here just for a few more minutes there's something about prophets that their their temperament that they battle murder that murdering spirit I'm not sure why the Bible said prophets are like hewers they were cutters so maybe that's something to do with that they're just hewers out Levi will be there now Levi was a part of that destruction of the sheet you might so he was a little bit angry too a little violent they're a little too aggressive there but Levi had a daughter jakka bed the mother of Moses and mother Bram said give all the credit for Moses to jakka bed his mother and we all know the honor Levitical priesthood Levi will be there by God's grace amen it's a car anything in there so I think he had a pretty good tribe yeah yeah and four sons who founded the four chief families of the tribe Jacob and his blessing his children before his death compared it's a card to a strong donkey so I'm not sure about that it was a prophecy concerning the tribe of Issachar but if the car will be there I don't have much on it's a car Zebulon Zebulon was blessed in fertile grounds and much Commerce so he was very faithful with his resources I mean oh Jesus says I give talents to all my servants amen he gives everybody I'm out of town not of money amount of influence and you want to be faithful with the talents that he gives you also the prowess of this this tribe here what was it again Zebulon was sung about in the song of Deborah when Deborah and the King defeated that that barrack I think it was the evil King Maric they sung of the power of istikhara I'm sorry Beulah I keep getting mixed up Zebulon so Zebulon had a good testimony this tribe had a good testimony and Zebulun will be there by God's grace and we know Joseph Joseph will have to say much about him other than he's a perfect type of Christ he just had one flaw remember when he told his brothers tell them you're not Shepherds he told him a lie he just had one flaw but we know Joseph will be there by God's grace and lastly Benjamin let's say in our feet here Benjamin there's not much about him other than he was loved of the Father but Benjamin types out the 144,000 he was so loved of his father and history the Bible says after he moved to Egypt with his father he became the father of 10 sons he was so blessed remember his name is son of my right hand so he's a type of Christ my right hand and Benjamin will be despite their failures their sins Christ gives them eternal life robes crowns and Thrones do you love Jesus tonight oh amen God can God God chooses the people we might not expect let's think about that for a moment those murderers right the violent the sexual misconduct ones the ones who under rally around and get rid of Joseph had the wrong attitude God changes their hearts because they're part of God's family he changes their hearts and he redeems their life from the grave amen and then he gives him a robe gives him a crown gives him a throne to sit on Oh My gods Amazing Grace each one has the same reward because they overcame the trials of their day they were leaders of their day now the Bible says this Malachi have you come to the piano here the Bible says this 144,000 will be born in one day Isaiah 66 eight who hath heard such a thing who has seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as I and travaileth she brought forth her children that's the key word their church travail travail think about today what are we travailing for what do you ever burn for for God what is it you want to see God accomplish in your life in your family can we think on that for a moment travail what are we travailing for what are we willing to pray really hard for what are we what are we willing to to bear atlast David said bare my soul before the Lord what are we willing to do that see to be born again they've got to travail for it they've got to cry out for it just play Holy Spirit rain down sir now is eka ride twelve nine I'm gonna read that these are all familiar scriptures but let's think about this for ourselves Church think about this for ourselves [Music] and it should come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplication number of supplication is a specific prayer when you have supplication for a certain need it's it's one specific request I'm going to make a supplication to God for this request so the Holy Spirit is going to be poured upon Israel they'll have a spirit of grace favor and supplication prayer and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourns for His only Son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of had a dream on in the valley of megiddo and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of David apart and their wives apart the family of the house of Nathan apart and their wives apart the family the house the Levi's apart and their wives apart and the family of shamea apart and their wives apart all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart so when they see Christ he's got his wounds in his hands it's gonna make them mourn and weep and they're gonna go they're gonna join with their families and they're gonna pray and they're gonna mourn and say God how could we have crucified our Messiah how could we have been blinded for so long and the Bible calls this travail travail oh and Isaiah 66 they travailed for as soon as she travailed she brought four children so let me close with that by the grace of God what are we willing to travail for it's almost 2019 has God been good to us in 2018 certainly certainly but is there anything that we feel like we must travail for the Bible said as soon as she travail as soon as Israel mourns says look at that dead liquid look what we've done I feel so awful I feel so ashamed of myself hot we're so ashamed of our country we're ashamed of our family as soon as she started surveilling she brought forth and was born to camp a pit I didn't tell you amen glory they God anointed us a man because they like that with the spirit of grace and supplication to pray to have a burden for someone to travail for something because this is the time for it amen this is the time for it once the rapture goes to be no more time for writing this is the time for it [Music] praise God let's think about those things here with our heads bowed just for a moment what a scripture what a scripture as soon as she travailed she brought forth 144,000 people are going to be born again on Mount Zion what a revival service that's going to be church not goods in church it was just on my
