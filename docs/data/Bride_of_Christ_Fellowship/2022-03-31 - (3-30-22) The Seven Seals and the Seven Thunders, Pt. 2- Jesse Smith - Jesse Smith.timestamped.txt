[15:27] tonight let's go to uh revelation
[15:30] chapter eight by god's grace we'd like
[15:31] to continue
[15:33] lord willing one more service on the
[15:34] seven seals and the seven thunders
[15:37] i just want to
[15:38] preach a few more things on this and
[15:39] then lord willing to get back to gideon
[15:41] or whatever
[15:42] series the lord directs us to so
[15:44] revelation chapter 8 verse 1.
[15:56] as we start the service i just want to
[15:57] tell our home church not so much the
[15:59] live streamers unless the visitors but
[16:00] the home church i'm going to stop the
[16:02] sermon at the end to share just a little
[16:04] personal
[16:05] uh story i want to share
[16:09] but if our home church is listening you
[16:11] know i'll record it on my phone and i
[16:12] can just share it later if you like to
[16:14] listen to it
[16:17] kind of deals with
[16:19] you know just
[16:20] the pull of the hour kind of deals with
[16:22] uh the timing and the coming of the lord
[16:25] and uh you know
[16:27] numerous message ministers are saying
[16:30] the raptures any day now they've been
[16:31] saying that for a month now
[16:34] and that's the way numerous churches
[16:37] have kind of carried themselves
[16:38] and so i just want to address some of
[16:40] those things and share some of those
[16:42] things at the end of the service so our
[16:44] home church you know you're
[16:46] happy to you're free to contact me after
[16:48] service if you like but i'm going to
[16:49] stop the live stream a little shorter
[16:51] just meditating on it last night i
[16:53] thought well i'd like to address it
[16:54] tonight and
[16:55] maybe end the service with a few
[16:57] thoughts on that
[16:59] how i just felt the holy spirit put a
[17:01] burden on my heart
[17:04] so revelation chapter 8 verse 1.
[17:15] revelation 8 verse 1.
[17:23] let's read verse 1 together revelation 8
[17:25] verse 1.
[17:26] let's read this psalm 3 1 2 3
[17:29] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[17:32] there was silence in heaven about the
[17:34] space of half an hour now let me read
[17:37] just on you'll see the context so the
[17:39] context is after the seventh seal
[17:41] judgment gets ready to strike
[17:44] that's why i believe the seventh seal is
[17:46] the day and hour of the rapture
[17:49] because right after the rapture what
[17:50] happens grace is over for the gentiles
[17:52] and now the first half of the 70th week
[17:54] of daniel the first three and a half
[17:56] years of torment starts
[17:58] now it's a time of peace between
[18:00] it's a time of peace between rome and
[18:02] israel they're going to make a seven
[18:03] year covenant the bible says that in
[18:05] daniel 9 27.
[18:07] but it's also a time where the prophets
[18:08] are going to torment the earth
[18:11] it's not going to rain for three and a
[18:12] half years it seems like from the
[18:13] scripture
[18:14] but the real wrath of god is saved for
[18:16] the second half of the tribulation the
[18:18] real wrath of god is saved for that but
[18:19] look at verse two and i saw the seven
[18:21] angels which stood before god and
[18:24] then and and to them were given seven
[18:26] trumpets when after the seven seals
[18:28] opened
[18:30] that would make sense after the rapture
[18:31] after grace is over then we're getting
[18:33] ready for judgment
[18:35] verse three and another angel came and
[18:37] stood at the altar having a golden
[18:38] censer and there was given unto him much
[18:40] incense that he should offer upon the
[18:42] prayers
[18:43] i'm sorry offer it with the prayers of
[18:45] all the saints upon the golden altar
[18:47] which was before the throne and the
[18:48] smoke of the incense which came with the
[18:50] prayers of the saints ascended up before
[18:52] god out of the angel's hand
[18:54] and the angel took the sensor and filled
[18:55] it with fire of the altar and cast it
[18:58] into the earth
[19:00] and there were voices and thunderings
[19:02] and lightnings and earthquake and an
[19:04] earthquake so one specific earthquake
[19:06] could that be the los angeles earth
[19:08] earthquake possibly but there's another
[19:10] one mentioned later on in revelation
[19:12] that's called the greatest earthquake of
[19:13] all time i think that would be the los
[19:15] angeles one but of course i could be
[19:16] wrong
[19:17] yeah california yes sir
[19:20] yeah that's what it looks like by god's
[19:22] grace
[19:24] because we we could not think of a worse
[19:26] earthquake than that right where a whole
[19:29] piece of a continent falls off
[19:31] into the ocean i don't know what could
[19:33] be worse than that
[19:34] so it seems like that would be after the
[19:36] rapture
[19:38] but again we don't have the say the lord
[19:40] on that we just have thus saith lord
[19:41] it's gonna happen
[19:44] uh in verse
[19:46] six and the seven angels which had the
[19:48] seven trumpets prepared themselves to
[19:50] sound
[19:52] now look at the first the first angel
[19:54] verse seven the first angel sounded and
[19:56] there
[19:57] followed what hail and fire mingled with
[20:00] blood now what does that look like
[20:02] hail with blood we've all seen hail but
[20:05] this is hail with fire and blood
[20:09] and they were cast upon the earth and
[20:11] the third part of the trees
[20:13] right get a picture get a picture in
[20:14] your mind of earth look at all the green
[20:17] now a third of that is destroyed a third
[20:21] was burned up and all green grass was
[20:23] burnt up all green grass
[20:26] so you don't want to be here when the
[20:27] trumpet sounds when these trumpets sound
[20:30] we want to be gone when the last trumpet
[20:31] to the gentile sounds see there's a
[20:34] trumpet to the gentiles but then there
[20:35] are seven trumpets of god pouring out
[20:37] his wrath upon the earth
[20:40] may god has a blessing to read his word
[20:41] you may be seated here
[20:54] so i want to take one more service here
[20:55] and look at the seven seals
[20:58] and the seven thunders
[21:00] i appreciate the good feedback i was
[21:02] trying to ask people last week was that
[21:03] helpful and hopefully it was
[21:06] uh by god's grace i just want to just
[21:07] briefly again review this so you can
[21:09] switch over here i just want to show
[21:10] those
[21:11] those charts again that make it very
[21:12] simple so you can see every seal had
[21:17] three forms to it each seal had three
[21:20] parts to it so i want my kids to grow up
[21:22] lord willing if the lord tarries i want
[21:24] all the other children to grow up and
[21:26] understand these things so there's no
[21:27] questions about it did you notice how
[21:29] brother brian came in here and said it's
[21:31] good to ask questions you guys catch
[21:32] that on sunday
[21:34] i thought well that's the holy spirit
[21:35] right there
[21:36] because we're always like ask me any
[21:37] question right
[21:38] every sunday night ask me any question
[21:41] right
[21:42] because he he knows the value of that
[21:43] there's there's a real
[21:46] there's a real uh injury you give to the
[21:48] church when you say no questions because
[21:50] that creates fear
[21:52] uh anxiety uncertainty but when you have
[21:54] the liberty to answer it and ask any
[21:56] question that's where the spirit of the
[21:58] lord is
[21:58] because god's not afraid of your
[22:00] questions
[22:02] god's god's infinite he knows all things
[22:04] and although we don't have all the
[22:05] answers we should at least have all the
[22:07] honesty the bible says we should have
[22:09] all honesty
[22:10] so just briefly uh i'm going through
[22:11] this real quick here
[22:14] remember not uh the revelations of the
[22:16] seven seals and the church ages were
[22:17] thus saith the lord but not every word
[22:18] was thus saith the lord we saw that
[22:20] plain last week
[22:23] and each each seal has has three forms
[22:26] that have to be fulfilled i just want to
[22:28] show that again but plainly says it in
[22:30] this paragraph paragraph 147 and 148.
[22:34] he said there's a symbol form there's a
[22:36] reality form and then there's a
[22:38] revelation form as well when it's
[22:39] revealed so there's three forms to it
[22:42] and i just want to show this again the
[22:44] first seal
[22:45] has a symbol reality revelation
[22:48] each one's a little different the symbol
[22:50] is when john saw in a.d
[22:52] 90 or 500 everybody has a different date
[22:55] on that
[22:56] the reality form was different it's when
[22:57] the the the the white horse rider road
[23:00] that spirit of antichrist as the in
[23:01] deception wrote at that time then the
[23:03] spirit of antichrist and the second seal
[23:05] wrote as a murderer in the roman
[23:06] catholic church and then the fourth uh
[23:09] the
[23:10] black horse rider during the dark ages
[23:13] capturing the wealth of the world right
[23:15] through indulgences and crusades and the
[23:18] capturing of art and gold and all those
[23:20] things that was from 1095 to 1906 and
[23:23] now that pale horse rider is writing
[23:25] today spiritual death
[23:27] okay now the revelation form came on on
[23:30] the thunder the thunder the voice of god
[23:32] gave the revelation the first seal on
[23:33] march 18th second seal thundered out
[23:35] march 19th the third seal thundered out
[23:37] march 20th the fourth seal thundered out
[23:39] march 21st
[23:41] the fifth seal thundered out march 22nd
[23:43] 63 the sixth seal thundered out uh march
[23:46] 23rd and the seventh seal thundered out
[23:48] march 24th 1963
[23:51] and then the fifth sixth and seventh
[23:53] seals their reality forms are all future
[23:55] tense
[23:56] right these two are right after the
[23:58] rapture and the seventh is the rapture
[24:00] it is the rapture
[24:02] okay so hope that's again uh helpful i
[24:05] think church the more you see it the
[24:07] more you'll you'll understand it better
[24:10] and i'm gonna kind of close the service
[24:11] with this thought about time is the
[24:14] greatest vindicator of all things
[24:17] time will vindicate who was right and
[24:18] who was wrong
[24:21] and now we have what 56 years since
[24:23] brother ram's been off the scene
[24:25] so now we have plenty of time to see
[24:27] what was what was really inspired the
[24:29] lord what was his human thoughts what
[24:30] did he have what was he just kind of
[24:32] probing at you know like he even said he
[24:35] even said some of his sermons we're just
[24:36] i'm just i'm just presuming this like
[24:38] sirs is this the end time they said he
[24:40] said i've never preached a sermon like
[24:41] this this is just my guess i'm just
[24:43] trying to understand these visions okay
[24:47] now of course brother ram gave us all
[24:48] the mysteries you know the bible defined
[24:50] mysteries the godhead water baptism uh
[24:53] mystery of iniquity
[24:56] all 12 of them in the book there right
[24:57] all 12 of them
[24:58] so we have those revelations but there
[25:00] are certain things there's many things
[25:01] brother ram said on tape that we don't
[25:03] quite understand so time is the greatest
[25:05] vindicator of all those things
[25:07] all right now again to give you a visual
[25:09] of the the 2000 years of church history
[25:12] the symbol forms were given around 80
[25:14] 90. the reality form have been taken
[25:16] place the whole time
[25:18] the rowdy forms of those first four
[25:19] seals are going on right now uh actually
[25:22] we're in the fourth the three have
[25:23] already passed
[25:24] the revelation form of what they meant
[25:27] though that came in 1963.
[25:30] so i'll probably be you know over the
[25:31] years lord willing if the lord tarries
[25:33] we'll just be reviewing this to try to
[25:35] understand it better as the children go
[25:37] up they shouldn't have any questions
[25:39] about the seals i don't want them to
[25:40] have any questions about the seals or
[25:41] the thunders they should understand it's
[25:43] already been fulfilled and we just got
[25:45] to grow and receive more revelation from
[25:46] the holy spirit praise god brother
[25:48] graham said pray for revelation more
[25:50] than anything else hallelujah so that's
[25:52] what we do we pray for more revelation
[25:54] so there's the symbol form john got the
[25:56] visions on the aleppos the reality form
[25:59] was the actual years that the antichrist
[26:01] spirit was battling the certain
[26:02] anointing of the holy spirit
[26:04] and then the revelation form was in 1963
[26:06] when brother branham received the
[26:07] revelations from the holy spirit now uh
[26:11] let's skip ahead here i'm going to skip
[26:12] past that
[26:14] go to the thunder's quotes
[26:17] so brother ram said in revelation 10 1-7
[26:20] is history it's past
[26:22] that promise is already fulfilled
[26:25] so in revelation 10 when the mighty
[26:26] angel come down that was jesus christ in
[26:28] the holy spirit form or in the form of
[26:30] angels right because angels bring the
[26:32] presence of god that picture that we got
[26:34] out there the cloud that's the seven
[26:36] angels praise god come down clothed in a
[26:38] cloud praise god
[26:40] and then the mystery of god was revealed
[26:42] to brother branham and and now it's
[26:44] eaten by us and we're we're eating it
[26:46] today and we're taking it out uh we're
[26:48] taking out as far as we can go praise
[26:49] god we're just letting at this point
[26:51] really we're letting the internet do it
[26:53] right we don't know many missionaries
[26:54] going out right now but at this point
[26:56] we're letting the internet take the
[26:58] gospel praise god until some more
[26:59] missionaries rise up and can go overseas
[27:01] again praise god we never know when
[27:03] that'll start back up but we're waiting
[27:05] for it i'm ready for it praise god i'm
[27:06] ready to support one whenever they're
[27:08] ready to go praise god
[27:10] so that's history revelation 10 1 to 7
[27:12] is history so that means revelation 8
[27:14] or 10 8 through 11 is happening right
[27:16] now that's our responsibility right now
[27:18] to eat the book and prophesy again amen
[27:22] now brother brahm said they asked
[27:23] brother brown were the thunders revealed
[27:24] he said or he said were the
[27:27] are the thunders not yet known to us he
[27:29] said no they were already they were
[27:32] revealed in the seven seals that's what
[27:34] the thunders was about
[27:36] so to brother abraham in this quote the
[27:38] thunders was something of the past it's
[27:40] what the the holy spirit already gave us
[27:42] in the seals
[27:45] and then the church age book brother i
[27:46] read this over at least a couple of
[27:47] times he said
[27:48] i got a quote on that and he said the
[27:51] first job of malachi 4 is to
[27:54] turn our hearts to the fathers the
[27:56] second job is to reveal the mysteries of
[27:59] the seven thunders in revelation 10
[28:01] which are the revelations contained in
[28:04] the seven seals praise god
[28:07] all right now we looked at the bible
[28:08] teaching on seven thunders now i've got
[28:10] another one i want to go to so this
[28:11] one's not up here but turn your bibles
[28:13] to psalm 29 please psalm 29
[28:28] and if you haven't listened to the seven
[28:30] uh seven seals lately uh brother austin
[28:32] and lean i would really encourage you to
[28:34] do that i'm so glad some of the first
[28:35] sermons i've ever listened to to brother
[28:37] branham were some were those sermons
[28:39] they're some of the most highly anointed
[28:41] and revelated sermons because you get
[28:43] all the symbols you get the symbols of
[28:44] the seven eyes you get the symbols of
[28:46] the rainbow around the throne
[28:48] uh the 24 elders the symbols of the
[28:50] horse riders and the the
[28:53] the four cherubim there uh it's just
[28:55] beautiful it's really important get a
[28:56] lot of good church history too so i
[28:58] really encourage you to read that
[29:01] now what's interesting about
[29:03] psalm 29 is that there are seven voices
[29:06] of the lord
[29:08] or seven thunders
[29:10] now i can't at this point i'm just
[29:12] presuming i can't see how these are
[29:15] linked to the seven seals but i'm just
[29:17] showing you it's psalm 29 verse 1 psalm
[29:21] 29 verse 1.
[29:23] if you want to read it you don't have to
[29:24] but if you want to follow along
[29:26] verse 1 says give unto the lord o ye
[29:28] mighty give unto the lord glory and
[29:30] strength give unto the lord the glory
[29:33] do unto his name worship the lord in the
[29:35] beauty of holiness
[29:37] see the enemy's going to tell you you
[29:38] know your worship is just it's just
[29:40] legalism
[29:42] that he's going to tell you all you
[29:42] sisters when you dress like that you
[29:44] brothers when you dress like that when
[29:45] you stay away from evil that's just
[29:47] that's just legalism there's no god
[29:49] doesn't
[29:50] god's not pleased with that but the
[29:52] bible says worship god it's beautiful
[29:55] unto god amen
[29:57] sister is your dress beautifully and it
[29:59] glorifies god when your brothers dress
[30:01] modestly that glorifies god any holy
[30:04] living is beautiful in god's sight
[30:06] praise god so we got to tell the devil
[30:08] to be quiet get behind me satan
[30:10] when you choose to obey god's word and
[30:11] holiness god sees it as a beautiful
[30:13] thing praise god
[30:16] verse 3. now here it is
[30:19] here's the first voice the voice of the
[30:21] lord is upon the waters now waters
[30:23] represent multitudes of people the glory
[30:25] of god thundereth the lord is upon many
[30:28] waters so it repeats itself now notice
[30:30] there's seven voices here
[30:32] it looks like seven thunders
[30:35] okay now again i can't see the
[30:36] correlation between the seven seals but
[30:38] but uh perhaps somebody else can and
[30:40] they can email me and let me know
[30:42] verse four the voice of the lord is
[30:44] powerful the voice of the lord is full
[30:46] of majesty so there's three voices
[30:47] there's three thunders right there
[30:49] verse 5 the voice of the lord breaketh
[30:51] the cedars
[30:52] takes down woods yea the lord breaketh
[30:55] the cedars of lebanon that's the fourth
[30:57] voice
[30:58] verse six he maketh them also to skip
[31:00] like a calf look at that cedar skip like
[31:03] a calf cedar trees
[31:05] large massive trees skipping like calves
[31:08] that's how powerful god is amen
[31:11] he says lebanon and syrian like a young
[31:14] unicorn
[31:15] verse seven the voice of the lord
[31:17] divideth the flames of fire
[31:20] so god's voice separates fire flames
[31:24] that's the fifth thunder
[31:26] uh number eight the voice of the lord
[31:28] shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh
[31:29] the wilderness of kadesh that's the
[31:32] sixth thunder and nine and the voice
[31:34] lord maketh the hinds to calves that the
[31:37] voice of god causes these pregnant
[31:39] animals to bring forth their little ones
[31:42] and discovereth the forest
[31:44] and in his temple doth everyone speak of
[31:47] his glory
[31:49] praise god
[31:51] so the voice of god causes all the
[31:53] saints in the temple of god to praise
[31:55] the lord and to speak of god's name amen
[31:57] hallelujah that's what the voice of god
[31:59] does amen
[32:00] hallelujah
[32:02] you might as well finish the chapter
[32:04] because it's a short chapter verse 10
[32:05] the lord stood up upon the flood yea the
[32:07] lord sitteth king forever amen who's
[32:10] your king our king is jesus amen the
[32:12] bible calls him king of saints
[32:14] hallelujah
[32:15] so if you have a need in your life just
[32:16] go straight to the king praise god come
[32:18] boldly before the king hallelujah find
[32:21] grace to help in the time of need verse
[32:23] 11 the lord will give strength unto his
[32:24] people amen how many strength tonight
[32:26] praise god he's here to give us strength
[32:28] amen the lord will bless his people with
[32:31] peace
[32:32] amen keep praying for peace in ukraine
[32:34] keep praying for these things we don't
[32:36] know how much time we got praise god but
[32:37] god gives strength and god gives peace
[32:39] amen we need to be the ones praying for
[32:41] it hallelujah
[32:43] now so there you go i just thought i'd
[32:44] share that with you i've always had that
[32:46] for years
[32:48] and just laying there i'm waiting for
[32:50] inspiration on those seven voices seven
[32:52] thunders the bible says the voice of god
[32:54] thundereth
[32:55] amen
[32:57] now i'd like to uh skip ahead here these
[32:59] are the quotes i ended with last time
[33:00] remember brother brahm said you cannot
[33:02] add to the word at one time brother
[33:04] brown thought there were seals on the
[33:05] backside of the book according to
[33:07] revelation chapter five but then brother
[33:09] braham said i learned he said it wasn't
[33:12] that he said because there can't be
[33:14] anything that we need that's outside the
[33:16] bible everything we have need of is
[33:18] already in the bible praise god so
[33:20] brother ram could grow in revelation i
[33:22] just think that's a beautiful example if
[33:24] brother graham could grow in revelation
[33:25] how about us
[33:27] we should be able to come to church and
[33:28] learn learn something praise god we
[33:30] should be able to come and read we
[33:31] should be able to read our bibles and
[33:32] learn something new praise god
[33:34] get a fresh understanding a fresh
[33:35] revelation on the word of god hallelujah
[33:42] he says
[33:45] those things and i'm going to move on
[33:46] here
[33:48] but abraham said all of it
[33:50] he said you can't add anything to it or
[33:52] take anything from the bible it's all
[33:54] revealed in there and the seven seals
[33:56] opened up the revelation of what that
[33:58] was those seven thunders so you're
[33:59] talking about the seven thunders
[34:01] the seven seals opened up what the
[34:02] thunders was all about
[34:04] he said that's what it was see it's
[34:06] still in the word let's all say in the
[34:08] word ready in the word it's still in the
[34:10] word praise god the meaning of the
[34:12] thunders is in the word it's the seven
[34:15] uh it's the seven revelations of the
[34:16] seven seals praise god
[34:19] he said you can't get out of that word
[34:21] it won't leave that word and god's
[34:22] spirit will never leave that word it'll
[34:24] stay right there with the word blinding
[34:25] some and open the eyes of the others
[34:27] it'll always do that
[34:29] now i want to begin here for part two so
[34:32] just a very that was a very short uh
[34:33] review and hopefully everybody's gonna
[34:35] get up to on that
[34:38] now i just want to read this now it was
[34:40] interesting on uh march 19th
[34:43] which was a couple weeks ago
[34:48] the jeffersonville church got done
[34:50] listening to all the seals i thought
[34:51] that's interesting because i was going
[34:52] to preach on the seals right after that
[34:53] i didn't even realize it so i went back
[34:55] and see what their leadership said
[34:58] the day before they listened to that
[35:00] sermon and and uh
[35:02] the blue or the the the the black words
[35:05] there in the white tho those are just
[35:07] the words of the leadership at branham
[35:09] tabernacle
[35:10] uh
[35:11] the blue ones are my comments and the
[35:13] red ones are the things they said that i
[35:15] that are totally wrong
[35:17] okay so i preached to you the meaning of
[35:19] the seven thunders right and the seven
[35:20] seals now let's see what jeffersonville
[35:22] says about it let's see what they say
[35:24] and i just preached you all those quotes
[35:26] on rapturing faith a few weeks ago
[35:27] remember that i took you through every
[35:29] quote it's a two-hour sermon but you sat
[35:31] through it and god bless you and i hope
[35:33] the revelation's in your heart now amen
[35:36] uh
[35:37] i just preached you all those rapturing
[35:39] faith quotes now let's see what they say
[35:40] now this can be important for that end
[35:42] statement i'm gonna make at the end
[35:47] because a lot of preachers are on the
[35:49] message are saying the same thing
[35:50] jeffersonville's saying and i find that
[35:52] really strange
[35:54] if you are saying the same thing that
[35:55] that movement's saying
[35:57] about the prophetic things and all these
[35:59] spiritually revealed things i think
[36:01] there's something wrong with that
[36:03] because they are they are idolaters
[36:06] exalting brother branham equal with god
[36:08] and equal with the bible if not higher
[36:13] so that's what i want to say at the end
[36:16] so
[36:17] bear with me here i feel kind of led of
[36:19] the holy spirit to do this tonight i'm
[36:20] feeling very bold here tonight by god's
[36:22] grace strangely strangely just as
[36:24] strangely
[36:25] so here's what uh the the the leadership
[36:28] ends their blog post with this
[36:30] right right this was the this is the
[36:32] sunday i preached on the rapturing faith
[36:34] the very same and i didn't even know it
[36:36] i didn't even know it
[36:38] so the jeffersonville says it's this
[36:40] simple the mystery through those seven
[36:42] thunders will give the bride rapturing
[36:45] faith
[36:46] but i disagree i believe latter reign
[36:48] gives rapturing faith
[36:52] i believe we've already heard what the
[36:53] seven thunders said through the
[36:55] revelations god gave us
[36:58] now look
[36:59] they say only god through his seventh
[37:01] angel messenger will reveal those seven
[37:04] thunders
[37:05] i believe they already are revealed so
[37:08] jeffersonville is waiting for the
[37:10] thunders to be revealed but we believe
[37:12] they already are revealed praise god
[37:15] so see now what is that now if i'm right
[37:18] then that means there's millions of
[37:19] people following jeffersonville that are
[37:21] waiting for something to happen and it's
[37:23] already happened
[37:24] the prophecies already come and
[37:26] fulfillment and they missed it
[37:28] that's if i'm right
[37:30] now see where i'm putting myself i could
[37:31] be wrong
[37:33] yes sir
[37:48] that's how the rapture is going to be
[37:49] yeah that's what he was saying
[37:54] and everybody's going to be expecting
[37:56] it's already happened yes beautiful yep
[37:58] same thing with john the baptist yep
[38:00] john the baptist came he came six months
[38:02] of preaching died and they're like who
[38:04] they most people miss it even jesus
[38:06] disciples missed it and jesus had to
[38:07] come back and say who was he he was
[38:09] prophet he said more than a prophet he
[38:11] was the messenger of the covenant
[38:13] praise god they missed it
[38:15] yes very good brother very good
[38:17] now see so look
[38:19] the the movement that worships brother
[38:21] brown says we're still waiting for the
[38:22] thunders i say we already heard it
[38:24] praise god
[38:25] according to whose quotes brother
[38:27] branham and they're the ones that say
[38:28] and they believe brother rams quotes
[38:30] it shows they don't
[38:32] hallelujah
[38:34] amen
[38:35] if you want the seven thunders to be
[38:36] revealed to you to give you rapturing
[38:38] rapturing in faith there's no other way
[38:40] to receive that revelation but to get it
[38:42] from god's only vindicated voice for our
[38:45] day not from me not from your local
[38:47] pastor which is true you can't get it
[38:48] from me you get it from the holy ghost
[38:51] but it's through the fifo ministry
[38:53] hallelujah
[38:56] not evangelist or teacher but from god's
[38:59] now look at this god's pastor to the
[39:01] world
[39:02] by pressing play
[39:05] where did brother branham ever say i'm
[39:06] the pastor to the world with thus saith
[39:09] the lord
[39:10] where do you ever say that
[39:12] they asked brother brown i could show
[39:13] you plainly am are you the only one to
[39:15] preach brother branham and he said no he
[39:16] said i'd be an awful candidate for that
[39:18] he said i'm just one pebble on the beach
[39:21] now he was a
[39:22] major prophet no doubt about it but he's
[39:24] saying it's not just me it's all the men
[39:27] of god who are called by the holy spirit
[39:28] need to preach the word of god amen he
[39:30] said we need more of them is what he
[39:32] said amen
[39:34] yeah billy graham yeah he had a good
[39:36] part on justification now that's as far
[39:37] as he went brother he only went to the
[39:38] first step just so you know he only went
[39:40] to first base with god he didn't go to
[39:41] second base of god
[39:43] oh yeah he was a
[39:45] yeah he does he was a mighty preacher of
[39:47] salvation
[39:49] but that's as far as he went he never
[39:51] got into the sanctification holy ghost
[39:53] or gifts of the spirit never got into
[39:54] that
[39:57] yeah but he's godly man godly man he's
[39:59] the one i was telling you he he ran a
[40:01] mile every day to keep himself
[40:03] healthy and then he never went on a trip
[40:06] without another man everywhere he went
[40:08] in every hotel room because he knew the
[40:10] enemy would try to bring a woman into
[40:12] there to try to
[40:13] make a scandal on him real godly man
[40:15] that's a real godly thing he would never
[40:16] meet with the woman alone
[40:18] see that's a good godly thing to do
[40:20] he had some revelation some revelation
[40:23] not enough but he had some
[40:25] so see church brother ram never said he
[40:27] was the pastor to the world and brother
[40:29] ram never said for preachers to sit down
[40:32] the bible never says that
[40:34] so seats an attack on the fivefold
[40:36] ministry the very same sunday i was
[40:38] preaching rapture and faith
[40:40] hallelujah
[40:42] see they're saying preachers sit down
[40:43] shut up and press play
[40:46] that's that's not right
[40:47] if we go back to the bible if jesus says
[40:49] the same yesterday and forever the holy
[40:51] spirit would say my servant brother
[40:52] abraham is dead so joshua you go forward
[40:55] amen you go forward and preach the word
[40:57] of god you possess the land you take the
[40:59] people in to the baptism of the holy
[41:01] ghost amen hallelujah that's what he'd
[41:03] say because he's the same yesterday
[41:05] today and forever
[41:08] now he said uh the leadership says come
[41:10] here all the mysteries revealed brother
[41:11] i'm never said this
[41:14] receive rapturing faith brother brahm
[41:16] said rapturing faith is given just
[41:18] before
[41:19] uh the rapture in the church age book
[41:22] and fill your lamp with oil now you
[41:24] could get the holy ghost at any service
[41:26] if if there's real holy ghost filled
[41:27] people there
[41:28] oh and that's one thing i want to share
[41:30] with you yes uh
[41:32] brother brian asked me brother jesse was
[41:33] there anything i said you disagree with
[41:35] i just said one thing so i'm gonna share
[41:36] it with you and i love brother brian he
[41:38] preached some tremendous messages
[41:40] i said the only thing i disagree with i
[41:42] said uh
[41:43] he brother o'brien said how an amish man
[41:45] could have the baptism holy ghost and i
[41:47] said i don't think so
[41:48] unless he's in the message
[41:50] i said i just disagree with that you
[41:51] remember when he was telling his
[41:52] testimony he said the amish man had the
[41:54] holy ghost he said don't talk to me
[41:55] about politics only talk to me about god
[41:56] i don't know if you remember that or not
[41:58] i said well that's the only thing i
[41:59] disagree with brother i believe you got
[42:00] to be if you have the holy ghost you'll
[42:02] come out of amish churches and come to a
[42:04] message church that's what i believe
[42:07] because that's how it was in the bible
[42:08] the ephesians couldn't get the holy
[42:10] ghost until paul came and prayed for
[42:11] them praise god oh we had a good
[42:13] question about that the other a couple
[42:14] weeks ago too
[42:18] because i believe i see in the bible the
[42:20] life of the holy ghost only flows
[42:21] through the body that's what i see in
[42:22] the bible
[42:24] now like i said i also believe god could
[42:26] send a muslim i met a former muslim who
[42:29] saw a vision of jesus and got saved but
[42:31] then what'd he do he said he got the
[42:32] holy ghost he went to a message church
[42:35] that's that brother i was telling you he
[42:36] was the brother when i was preaching guy
[42:38] under brother austin he would slap the
[42:39] wall and say that's solid brother he
[42:41] said preach it that's solid brother he'd
[42:43] preach it like that i said yeah that is
[42:44] silent amen appreciate that brother
[42:47] but the reason he would do that was
[42:48] because he was he was a muslim he hated
[42:51] god all he knew was allah he was stoned
[42:54] with marijuana and drunk sitting on a
[42:56] couch watching tv he said he turned his
[42:58] head to the left he felt a holy presence
[42:59] come in the room it was jesus christ and
[43:01] a vision
[43:02] floating
[43:03] he said instantly the high left him the
[43:05] drunk left him he fell on his face and
[43:07] wept for hours he said and then he found
[43:09] the nearest church and that was a
[43:10] message church
[43:13] so that's what he'll say yeah that's
[43:15] solid
[43:16] so i said amen amen
[43:18] so a man that saw jesus said my soul my
[43:20] preaching was solid and then brother
[43:22] brahm
[43:22] prayed for sister humes she was healed
[43:24] and said she said you preached just like
[43:26] brother brahma i said amen i've got two
[43:27] witnesses amen
[43:29] one that saw jesus a vision and one that
[43:30] hurt brother branham amen hallelujah
[43:33] thank god amen that's what we need we
[43:35] need the real holy spirit to preach to
[43:36] us hallelujah
[43:38] so see church this is
[43:40] wrong
[43:42] it's so close but it's wrong so far away
[43:45] they use some of the same words some of
[43:47] the same thoughts but it's so far away
[43:51] and when i hear preachers agree with
[43:52] them something's wrong with that
[43:54] that's my personal opinion
[43:58] because brother man said when you got
[43:59] the holy ghost you got a little buzzer
[44:01] inside of you
[44:02] and something goes off something's not
[44:03] right with that
[44:05] i've been watching it here
[44:11] now here's what brother ham said in the
[44:12] fourth seal now look at my note down
[44:14] here out of the 51 there's 51 seven
[44:16] thunder's quotes there's only one that's
[44:18] thus saith the lord this is the one but
[44:20] notice brother ram is not interpreting
[44:22] the meaning of it he just says it has to
[44:24] come it's thus saith the lord so let's
[44:25] read it
[44:27] he said
[44:28] no he's talking about how
[44:30] any revelation has to come with the rest
[44:31] of the word that's the way the church
[44:33] ages and the seals and all the rest of
[44:35] it and when anybody thinks that he has
[44:36] those seven thunders if it don't compare
[44:38] with the rest of the word there's
[44:40] something wrong here see it's got to
[44:42] come thus saith the lord for this is the
[44:43] book this is the revelation of jesus
[44:45] christ in its entirety so i just want to
[44:47] say that plainly church there's no seven
[44:49] thunders quote that's thus saith the
[44:51] lord saying what it is but there's two
[44:53] quotes for brother brahman says it's the
[44:54] revelations already given to us in the
[44:56] seven seals
[44:59] now the biggest seven thunder mistake
[45:01] was joseph coleman's movement out of new
[45:04] york in the 70s 80s and 90s and 2000s
[45:07] and he died in 2012.
[45:10] he said he said the seven thunders were
[45:12] these right here
[45:13] he said these were the seven thunders
[45:14] and he was wrong
[45:16] he was wrong those are not seven
[45:17] thunders
[45:18] the seven thunders are the revelations
[45:20] and the seven seals and those are not
[45:21] the seven seals that's the statue of
[45:23] perfect man totally different
[45:25] but he deceived millions of people
[45:27] with that lie
[45:28] but see brother branham says it's got to
[45:30] be in the word
[45:31] see now that that is in the word but
[45:33] that's not about the seven seals that
[45:34] has nothing to do with the seals
[45:36] there's eight steps there there's only
[45:38] seven seals
[45:39] and the church said
[45:40] there's eight eight there's seven steps
[45:42] of sanctification or seven anointings
[45:44] and then you get the eighth eighth is
[45:46] eternity praise god and the holy ghost
[45:47] is eternal life amen
[45:49] in the soul
[45:54] now
[45:56] jeffersonville uses this quote
[45:58] to make those to make that blog post but
[46:00] it's before brother branham had the
[46:02] understanding about the seals on the
[46:04] back side of the book so this is uh
[46:06] right at the beginning of the seals the
[46:07] first seal
[46:08] also it's before the two times he said
[46:11] the thunders were already revealed in
[46:13] the seven seals so jeffersonville put
[46:15] this in there to try to convince people
[46:17] they're right this quote says and then
[46:18] there's coming forth seven thunders
[46:20] mysterious thunders that's not even
[46:22] written at all
[46:23] that's right and i believe that through
[46:24] those seven thunders will reveal the
[46:26] last days in order to get the bride
[46:28] together for rapturing faith because
[46:29] what we got right now we wouldn't be
[46:31] able to do it
[46:32] so see this is the quote they used to
[46:34] try to say we need to we need the
[46:35] revelation of the seven thunders we need
[46:36] it we need it but
[46:38] a year and three months after this
[46:40] brother ram said it's already revealed
[46:43] and then the church age book he said
[46:44] it's already been given to us
[46:47] so see see how the if if a pre if it's
[46:50] if he's not a real preacher he'll use a
[46:52] quote and deceive
[46:55] church people
[46:55] say like this they're looking for seven
[46:57] thunders to speak but it's already
[46:59] spoken praise god
[47:01] they're listening out there for
[47:02] something that's not going to come
[47:03] praise god amen
[47:05] and they're calling our move of real
[47:07] preachers and living and saying with the
[47:08] word they're calling they call our move
[47:10] demas
[47:12] they call our move make believers
[47:15] now look at that
[47:16] they call the real word make believers
[47:18] and demons when that's what they're
[47:20] doing praise god how are they going to
[47:22] hear the revelation they won't even
[47:23] budge they cannot be corrected how how
[47:25] can they even be
[47:27] saved
[47:28] i don't know
[47:29] it's up to god
[47:31] it's up to god i'm not the judge god is
[47:33] a judge
[47:36] but how can you go against the word of
[47:37] god
[47:38] like that
[47:40] it's all in god's hands
[47:41] i hope they're saved
[47:43] but i doubt with all my heart that
[47:45] they're born again because when you've
[47:46] got the holy ghost it guides you into
[47:48] all truth praise god and brother like
[47:50] program said you that when that prophet
[47:52] comes which he was talking about his own
[47:53] ministry he won't take one thing away
[47:55] from what paul said amen we need people
[47:57] that believe what paul said amen
[48:00] and they're they're taking away what
[48:02] paul said they're taken away from paul's
[48:04] gospel
[48:05] by exalting brother branham and taking
[48:07] away the preachers and limiting the
[48:08] preachers they're taken away from paul
[48:10] but paul said your curse to change one
[48:12] word of it praise god
[48:14] amen
[48:16] cursed
[48:17] and you're preaching another jesus he
[48:20] said
[48:21] jesus would never say sit down and press
[48:22] play no he'd say go up there and i'm
[48:24] anoint you to preach to my people praise
[48:26] god that's what he would say because
[48:27] that's what the bible says
[48:29] amen
[48:32] now i want to read this here this is the
[48:34] main rapturing faith quote that
[48:36] that i use to understand rapturing faith
[48:39] and i skipped it over when i preach it
[48:40] because you've heard it so many times
[48:41] but i'm going to read it again tonight
[48:43] now austin hasn't heard it so much but
[48:44] everybody else has heard it i'ma read
[48:45] again church age book chapter 10 last
[48:48] chapter
[48:49] what about the true seed of god it will
[48:51] happen just as we've said the people of
[48:53] god are being made ready by the word of
[48:55] truth from the messenger to this age
[48:57] brother brandon's ministry in her the
[49:00] true church will be the fullness of
[49:01] pentecost for for the spirit will bring
[49:03] the people right back to where they were
[49:05] at the beginning that is thus saith the
[49:07] lord amen so where church where are we
[49:10] hoping to go we're hoping and we're
[49:12] trusting and we're trusting god is going
[49:14] to bring us back to the day of pentecost
[49:16] we're going back to that praise god
[49:18] hallelujah
[49:20] where the whole church where the whole
[49:21] bride has that
[49:23] same experience that they had on the day
[49:25] of pentecost where they can all stand
[49:27] there and say this is that that joel
[49:29] prophesied of amen
[49:31] what you see out of my life what you see
[49:33] in the lives of our brothers and sisters
[49:35] this is what joel prophesied amen the
[49:38] former and latter rain we we see it as
[49:40] the finishing of the great commission
[49:42] praise god
[49:43] a great powerful anointing of the holy
[49:45] ghost to bring revival to our hearts
[49:47] church we all need revival in our minds
[49:49] praise god but before the rapture
[49:51] everybody
[49:52] that's in the bride is going to have
[49:53] that revival in their soul and their
[49:55] mind praise
[49:56] god thus saith the lord
[50:00] according to what how do we know the
[50:02] bride is going to have another day of
[50:03] pentecost because joel 2 23-26
[50:07] be glad then you children of zion
[50:10] and rejoice in the lord your god free
[50:12] hath given you the former rain now
[50:14] church do you remember what former rain
[50:15] means
[50:16] anybody remember say it out loud anyone
[50:17] remember
[50:18] teaching all right give her two claps
[50:20] yeah kind of like us kind of like a
[50:22] sunday night here
[50:24] former means teaching
[50:28] god has given you a teaching reign
[50:29] moderately and he will cause to come
[50:31] down for you the rain the former rain
[50:33] the teaching rain and the latter rain
[50:35] the harvest rain
[50:36] in the first month
[50:38] now that doesn't mean like the first
[50:40] month of the year like january it means
[50:42] as it did at first
[50:44] so in other words we're gonna get uh
[50:46] the latter rain the holy ghost anointing
[50:48] just like they did on the day of
[50:50] pentecost hallelujah
[50:52] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[50:54] the fats shall overflow with wine and
[50:56] oil and i'll restore to you the years
[50:58] that the locusts hath eaten the
[51:00] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[51:01] palmer were my great army which i sent
[51:03] among you and ye shall eat them plenty
[51:05] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[51:07] the lord your god that had dealt
[51:09] wondrously with you and my people shall
[51:11] never be ashamed
[51:13] that's why i don't care who hears my
[51:14] sermons that's why i just let them go
[51:15] out there right put out the videos
[51:17] because that's what jesus did
[51:19] now there's personal things i'm waiting
[51:21] on which is that's why i keep those
[51:22] things secret i'm waiting for more
[51:23] revelation i'm watching
[51:25] i'm watching at some point i will i was
[51:26] praying about it last night as i was
[51:27] going to bed
[51:28] at some point i may put out a video
[51:30] about that to expose some of these lies
[51:33] right but i'm just waiting on it because
[51:34] i'm not a prophet
[51:37] that's why our teachings are our
[51:38] preachings from the word of god our
[51:40] testimonies that's why we put them out
[51:41] there because it's real it's a reality
[51:44] praise god there's nothing to be ashamed
[51:45] of we've studied ourselves to prove them
[51:47] to god we've searched the scriptures
[51:48] amen we know in whom we have believed
[51:51] amen hallelujah
[51:55] god now it says god is going to restore
[51:58] the lutheran age did not restore the
[51:59] church it started reformation the
[52:01] western age did not restore the
[52:02] pentecost agent not restore but god has
[52:04] to restore for he cannot deny his word
[52:08] this is not the resurrection of the
[52:10] church it's the restoration
[52:12] god will take the church right back to
[52:14] pentecost of the beginning amen that's
[52:16] where we're going brother open up when
[52:18] we open up our bible read acts chapter 2
[52:20] that's where we're going praise god amen
[52:22] we're going to a people that will pray
[52:24] and get in one accord
[52:26] and then the holy spirit will come down
[52:27] we've had it a couple of times the holy
[52:29] ghost sweep through this church amen
[52:30] hallelujah but before the rapture it's
[52:33] coming back to that it has to come back
[52:35] to the very conditions where we can say
[52:37] this is that that joel spoke of it's
[52:39] thus saith the lord this is the latter
[52:41] rain
[52:42] when we see dead ones raised back we're
[52:43] going to say that and we start seeing
[52:46] dead people that were saints walk around
[52:47] revealing themselves and their brand new
[52:49] bodies we'll be saying this is the
[52:50] latter rain praise god
[52:52] amen
[52:53] if by god's grace we live to see it
[52:57] because brother graham said it could be
[52:58] 50 years 100 years he said
[53:00] no man knows the day of the hour
[53:05] now notice in verse 25 it tells why we
[53:07] need a restoration the locust cankerworm
[53:10] caterpillar palmer did you know that
[53:11] brothers these three are just the same
[53:15] four stages of the same insect
[53:18] so this is the caterpillar it's the
[53:20] these are the locust stages
[53:22] and that that that locus represents the
[53:25] same horse riders they're the same thing
[53:28] it's just different symbols for the same
[53:29] evil spirit
[53:31] okay so there's four horse riders the
[53:33] first four the white the red the black
[53:35] and the pale those are four
[53:38] four
[53:39] phases of the same antichrist spirit
[53:41] well the bible already foretold it in
[53:43] joel chapter two and it's also in
[53:45] chapter one
[53:46] those same four stages of the antichrist
[53:48] spirit it's already been foretold amen
[53:51] that means our victory has already been
[53:52] foretold as well praise god amen
[53:56] through the line the ox the man the
[53:58] flying eagle our victory has already
[54:00] been prophesied we've got a promise we
[54:02] will overcome praise god
[54:04] hallelujah
[54:07] the locust cankerworm uh kinder worm
[54:09] caterpillar and palmer have eaten all
[54:11] but the root and a small bit of the stem
[54:13] now we are told that all these insects
[54:15] are the one and the same in different
[54:17] stages
[54:18] that is right they are the antichrist
[54:19] spirit manifested in organization
[54:23] uh think of the catholic church right
[54:25] freemasons
[54:28] right
[54:29] jesuits
[54:30] that's right oh did i tell you that i
[54:32] haven't told this one well i told you
[54:34] guys a while ago i haven't told austin
[54:36] brother tim humes now he's left the
[54:37] message but before he left the message
[54:40] he told me he was driving uh he said a
[54:42] man joined his church and he was really
[54:43] friendly
[54:45] really nice guy he just started
[54:47] believing everything brother branham
[54:48] said and one day brother they got in the
[54:50] car together to go to aaron and the
[54:51] brother said why don't you
[54:53] change some of that holy ghost preaching
[54:54] we don't need all that screaming
[54:56] shouting speaking in tongues you don't
[54:58] need that
[55:00] and brother tim said
[55:02] a voice told him and said ask this man
[55:04] if he's a jesuit
[55:07] he said are you a jesuit
[55:09] now he'd already been there a year right
[55:11] he'd been buddied up to him
[55:12] he looked over and said stop the car i'm
[55:14] getting out
[55:15] he stopped the car my brother tim drove
[55:17] away
[55:19] yeah that's a testimony
[55:22] so see that that's what we're talking
[55:23] about jesuits they infiltrate
[55:26] and they try to influence they're trying
[55:27] to influence the people bringing the
[55:29] bringing the word of god
[55:31] now what's interesting is that he fell
[55:32] away from the message that's interesting
[55:35] but i pray for the brother i love the
[55:36] brother i preached for him twice you
[55:37] know i'd help him in any way i could i
[55:39] sent him a remember that letter we sent
[55:40] out in january uh remember you guys did
[55:42] the letters for us i sent him one i
[55:44] never heard back that's okay
[55:46] it's all in god's time it's up to god
[55:47] it's his choice everyone's got to make
[55:48] their choice i'm choosing my way with
[55:50] the lord's despise for you praise god
[55:52] this message is the word of god
[55:54] hallelujah
[55:58] and
[55:59] denomination and false doctrine through
[56:01] the ages and that poor little root and
[56:02] stock is going to be restored god isn't
[56:04] going to plant a new church but it's
[56:05] going to bring his original planting
[56:07] back to the original seed
[56:10] bless you he's doing it as stated by
[56:12] verse 23 by the teaching or former reign
[56:15] next will come the harvest reign or
[56:19] rapturing faith and the church said
[56:21] so see that's why church that's why i
[56:23] lean on this look he gave us two thus
[56:25] saith the lord he just repeats it thus
[56:26] saith the lord and then two paragraphs
[56:28] later he tells us what is rapturing
[56:30] faith it's harvest rain
[56:33] so the last rain that matures the wheat
[56:35] is the latter rain
[56:37] the last pouring out the holy ghost
[56:40] matures the seed and we experience
[56:43] pentecost
[56:44] all of us all the bride members
[56:46] experience experience our experience
[56:48] just like they did on the day of
[56:50] pentecost amen oh my can you imagine
[56:52] brother austin and cecilia seeing fire
[56:54] over people's heads we might see it who
[56:57] knows
[56:58] we might feel wind come rushing through
[57:00] here praise god
[57:01] hallelujah praise god
[57:03] we might see the dead rays hallelujah
[57:05] amen we might just have a church full of
[57:08] people speaking in times amen
[57:10] hallelujah
[57:12] of course they didn't understand that
[57:13] what they were saying
[57:15] right in most cases i would imagine
[57:17] unless there's an interpretation to come
[57:19] but see that that's why we that's why we
[57:21] stay with god's word every night you
[57:22] know we brother man says you're going to
[57:24] see it in little measures
[57:26] but he said it's really going to get
[57:27] poured out the harvest reign at the time
[57:29] of the squeeze
[57:30] now that's not thus saith the lord but
[57:32] that's that was his guess but this is
[57:34] thus saith the lord
[57:35] this is thus saith the lord
[57:37] or at least it's right around thus saith
[57:39] the lord
[57:40] acts 2 i'm sorry joel 2 23-26 is thus
[57:43] saith the lord
[57:45] that is
[57:46] god is going to bring the bride back to
[57:48] the fullness of pentecost it's the saint
[57:50] the lord praise god amen
[57:53] hallelujah
[57:54] ah one of these days all these sermons i
[57:56] preached it's all it's all worth it and
[57:58] it already is but it's gonna be all
[57:59] worth it praise god if we live to see
[58:01] that ladder rain amen hallelujah
[58:05] then there was gonna know why i was
[58:06] screaming and shouting for all these
[58:07] years preaching and
[58:09] losing my voice and spitting and all
[58:10] these things that's why because we're
[58:12] waiting for god's promise to be
[58:13] fulfilled praise god
[58:15] and we have the truth we have the
[58:16] revelation it's going to happen at some
[58:18] point praise god whether our generation
[58:20] or the next or next it's going to happen
[58:22] because this thus says the lord it's
[58:23] going to happen amen
[58:27] and it's either thus saith the lord or
[58:28] brother and was wrong well look at
[58:29] brother man's bible teaching it was with
[58:31] the word
[58:33] he said he said rome uh i put it on the
[58:36] podcast that i don't know if you heard
[58:37] this our second podcast we put out this
[58:38] week i put on the podcast brother
[58:40] brandon said rome is the mother of
[58:41] harlot and the protestants are the
[58:43] daughters thus saith the lord amen
[58:46] and
[58:47] message preachers have left the message
[58:48] the last few years and said no rome's
[58:50] not the mother harlot she's just a nice
[58:52] church and there's all good there's many
[58:53] good people in there there might be good
[58:55] people in there but the system is
[58:56] cankered it's eaten up from the roots
[58:59] it's perverted praise god it's a cage
[59:01] full of unclean and hateful birds amen
[59:03] and all of god's people must come out of
[59:05] there praise god hallelujah
[59:09] so who are you going to stand with
[59:11] these people that don't have any word or
[59:12] vindication or brother ram vindication
[59:14] bible teaching and thus saith the lord
[59:16] hallelujah i'm standing with god's
[59:18] prophet
[59:19] hallelujah
[59:22] so see brother adam even said now now
[59:24] church remember i remember that sunday i
[59:26] preached on rapturing faith
[59:28] that's why i hang on this one the most
[59:30] because there's a thus like the lord
[59:31] right right in front of it
[59:33] and brother man makes rapturing faith
[59:35] future tense he doesn't make it past
[59:37] tense he makes it future tense
[59:40] praise god
[59:42] and the very last sermon brother brandon
[59:43] preached i believe it was leadership or
[59:45] communion if i'm not yeah communion
[59:47] brother man makes a statement we're
[59:49] going to return to the times of ananias
[59:50] and sapphira in other words we're
[59:52] looking for rapturing faith
[59:53] we're looking for the book of acts and
[59:55] the pentecost of the hearts of the
[59:56] pentecostal fathers to be restored amen
[1:00:00] you imagine imagine that church walk
[1:00:01] into the church and your sins will get
[1:00:03] called out if you walk in there walking
[1:00:05] here sinning praise god
[1:00:07] that's he said brother man said that's
[1:00:09] what we're coming back to amen
[1:00:11] but i'm glad you know when we have sit
[1:00:13] in here i'm glad we can speak to those
[1:00:14] devils and they leave i'm glad about
[1:00:15] that
[1:00:16] i'm glad they got to leave anyway by
[1:00:18] god's grace
[1:00:19] hallelujah like i was talking about that
[1:00:21] critical spirit with brother brian god
[1:00:23] used me and god used brother ryan to
[1:00:24] tell that critical spirit leave this
[1:00:26] church in jesus christ's name amen
[1:00:29] the holy spirit moved out to leaven and
[1:00:32] we become a new lump praise god
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:37] now anybody think of this i was
[1:00:38] listening to a sermon this week
[1:00:40] anybody think of the former rain as
[1:00:42] doctrine
[1:00:44] give ear oh ye heavens and i will speak
[1:00:46] and hear o earth the words of my mouth
[1:00:48] my doctrine shall drop as the what
[1:00:51] rain and the word former means teaching
[1:00:54] doctrine reign
[1:00:57] that's why i believe brother graham's
[1:00:58] ministry was a was a very good anointing
[1:01:01] of teaching ministry it was teaching us
[1:01:04] the mysteries of god it was teaching us
[1:01:06] the doctrine and then this last
[1:01:08] anointing the latter reign will give us
[1:01:10] that rapturing faith hallelujah
[1:01:12] amen hallelujah praise god
[1:01:16] now what they're going to say about that
[1:01:18] you know church that's what i'm saying
[1:01:19] doctrine has become like a bad word in
[1:01:21] messenger churches because of all the
[1:01:22] false teachers over the last 56 years
[1:01:25] but that don't mean doctrine is wrong it
[1:01:26] means false doctrine is wrong
[1:01:29] it means somebody needs to pray and get
[1:01:30] the holy ghost and be born again and
[1:01:32] teach true doctrine praise god because
[1:01:34] that's what the bible says amen
[1:01:36] remember paul said teach no other
[1:01:38] doctrine than what i've delivered unto
[1:01:40] you praise god
[1:01:42] and then he said keep it without spot
[1:01:44] unrebukable until the day of the coming
[1:01:46] of jesus christ
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:49] hallelujah
[1:01:51] now let me do these quotes and then i'll
[1:01:53] try to close up here
[1:01:56] i'm going to skip to slide 78 here
[1:01:58] i'm just looking at my time there
[1:02:02] now this is review from six years ago i
[1:02:04] doubt anybody remember all these quotes
[1:02:05] can anybody think anybody think they
[1:02:07] remember all of them and i don't need to
[1:02:08] preach them okay that's what i thought
[1:02:11] because i couldn't remember them either
[1:02:13] now i found it most helpful these are
[1:02:15] quotes about now the seventh seal being
[1:02:17] the rapture
[1:02:18] quotes about the seventh seal is the
[1:02:20] rapture
[1:02:21] now some people say some preachers say
[1:02:23] and i disagree some preachers say
[1:02:24] revelation 10 1-7 was the seventh seal i
[1:02:27] don't agree with that
[1:02:30] there's a few quotes that make it sound
[1:02:31] like that i don't agree with that i
[1:02:33] believe the seventh seal is the literal
[1:02:35] day and hour of the rapture of the bride
[1:02:37] of jesus christ
[1:02:39] there's a few quotes people
[1:02:40] misunderstand
[1:02:42] but see church i'll say like this we're
[1:02:43] a minority if we believe this way if we
[1:02:45] believe the way we believe we're a
[1:02:47] minority but that's what jesus's church
[1:02:49] always was a minority
[1:02:53] so i found it most helpful to start at
[1:02:55] the end of brother ramsey's ministry and
[1:02:57] then go back all the quotes of the
[1:02:58] seventh seal go back to when he preached
[1:03:00] the seventh seal i found it it's very
[1:03:03] easy to follow
[1:03:05] so here's the first one i believe the
[1:03:06] seven seals a day and the hour of the
[1:03:08] coming of jesus christ or the rapture
[1:03:13] so in this quote brother answered the
[1:03:14] last seal will be the coming of the lord
[1:03:16] this is broken cisterns
[1:03:18] i'm just going to skip down here
[1:03:20] he says talk about the rapture he quotes
[1:03:21] the rapture right here then he says
[1:03:24] for the trump of god that last trumpet
[1:03:26] the sixth one just sounded he's talking
[1:03:27] about the sixth seal
[1:03:30] and that last trumpet like the last seal
[1:03:33] will be the coming of the lord
[1:03:35] it shall sound and the dead in christ
[1:03:36] shall rise first just resting until that
[1:03:38] time
[1:03:40] so see the last seal is like the coming
[1:03:42] of the lord
[1:03:43] the coming of the lord all right
[1:03:45] next one okay
[1:03:47] now you know shout voice trump trump is
[1:03:49] the last trump to the gentiles
[1:03:51] next quote
[1:03:52] because the seventh seal there was
[1:03:54] silence no one knew that well he said
[1:03:56] what was it that was the minute or hour
[1:03:59] that christ would come as he revealed it
[1:04:02] unto us
[1:04:04] so brother adam says the seven seals
[1:04:06] been revealed to us what the revelation
[1:04:08] form of it
[1:04:10] not the reality form the revelation of
[1:04:12] it praise god we know what it is it's
[1:04:14] the day and hour the rapture
[1:04:18] so the seventh seal was the minute or
[1:04:20] hour that christ would come as he
[1:04:21] revealed it to us
[1:04:22] now he says the seventh seal hasn't
[1:04:24] opened yet you know that's his coming so
[1:04:26] see hasn't opened yet that means we
[1:04:28] haven't experienced the rapture yet
[1:04:30] because he just said he's revealed it to
[1:04:32] us right i can go this is the same
[1:04:34] sermon this is the same sermon in the
[1:04:36] same sermon he says he hasn't opened it
[1:04:37] yet and then he says he already revealed
[1:04:39] it to us in the same sermon
[1:04:42] so see you gotta really have a
[1:04:43] discernment of the holy spirit
[1:04:46] at the same time now as soon as this
[1:04:48] church the bride is drawn together she's
[1:04:50] taken up and that mystery of the seventh
[1:04:52] seal or the seventh seal the mystery of
[1:04:54] going
[1:04:56] rapture
[1:05:00] so some are confused brother man said he
[1:05:01] revealed to us yet but he also said it
[1:05:04] hasn't opened yet the confusion leaves
[1:05:06] when you understand there's three forms
[1:05:07] to each seal including the seventh seal
[1:05:12] look at the yellow the reality form
[1:05:13] hasn't opened yet but the revelation
[1:05:15] form has
[1:05:17] and here's i just took this one column
[1:05:19] see i just took the seven seal which was
[1:05:21] the seventh thunder
[1:05:23] the symbol form there's really no symbol
[1:05:25] other than silence in heaven that's
[1:05:26] there's really no symbols for the
[1:05:27] seventh seal there's no real symbols but
[1:05:30] we know the symbol they're silence
[1:05:31] that's the only thing that they say
[1:05:33] the reality is future the day of the
[1:05:35] hour the ramp said it hasn't opened up
[1:05:37] the revelation he said what is it
[1:05:39] it's the rapture coming as he revealed
[1:05:42] it to us now church does that help by
[1:05:43] god's grace
[1:05:49] that's just as plain as i can make it
[1:05:52] and i've got numerous emails this week
[1:05:54] saying your teachings are just so easy
[1:05:55] to understand thank you for putting him
[1:05:56] out there he said god bless you for that
[1:05:58] see i knew i was one of the holy spirit
[1:05:59] to do that i knew it i just there's
[1:06:01] there are certain things that god does
[1:06:02] in your life and you just can't get away
[1:06:03] from it
[1:06:05] you just follow the leadership of the
[1:06:06] holy spirit you pray brother austin pray
[1:06:08] read your bible fast give alms and god's
[1:06:10] going to lead you praise god
[1:06:12] you're just going to be a surrender to
[1:06:13] him
[1:06:14] he's going to lead you to bless many
[1:06:16] people
[1:06:19] so what is the rapture this is the
[1:06:21] rapture but of that day and hour knoweth
[1:06:23] no man no not the angels of heaven but
[1:06:24] my father only that's the rapture
[1:06:26] scripture
[1:06:29] here's another one the seven is always
[1:06:31] the mystery watch that seven that's the
[1:06:32] finish that was the coming of the lord
[1:06:36] heaven was quiet silent nobody moved
[1:06:38] because jesus said not even an angel of
[1:06:40] heaven knows when i'll return i don't
[1:06:42] even know it myself what time the father
[1:06:44] has put in his mind god alone knows it
[1:06:46] the spirit said i don't know it then it
[1:06:48] wasn't revealed
[1:06:50] when the seventh trumpet sounded or the
[1:06:51] seventh angel a seal was open there was
[1:06:54] silence in the heavens see it wasn't
[1:06:55] given away what would take place
[1:06:58] see the day and the hour when the
[1:07:00] seventh seal opened none of the details
[1:07:02] were told because god's keeping that on
[1:07:04] his mind
[1:07:06] but i'll tell you like this church
[1:07:07] listen
[1:07:09] and i know you are but i'm just saying
[1:07:10] it because i'm in that i'm in the habit
[1:07:11] of preaching now
[1:07:13] brother braham said the holy spirit said
[1:07:14] pick up my pen and write and what he
[1:07:16] said was going to happen right before
[1:07:17] the squeeze he said america would change
[1:07:19] its laws to force the bride to stop
[1:07:21] preaching
[1:07:23] that's why i tell people that's why i
[1:07:24] put out that video in the 14 signs of
[1:07:26] the end times
[1:07:28] that's what that's what i'm watching i'm
[1:07:29] watching the purple curtain when i watch
[1:07:31] the u.s government and their laws i'm
[1:07:32] watching the purple curtain
[1:07:34] because it's
[1:07:36] rome satanic rome in the u.s the beast
[1:07:38] out of the land
[1:07:42] all these people are all these preachers
[1:07:43] are saying oh there's no more thing
[1:07:44] there's no other signs left before the
[1:07:46] rapture what about that pick up your pen
[1:07:48] statement brother random said but man
[1:07:49] said it was the holy spirit that told
[1:07:50] him that
[1:07:53] see
[1:07:55] again people at church i say like this i
[1:07:56] think it's pride people they just
[1:07:58] they're so prideful they think they know
[1:08:00] everything and they say i believe
[1:08:02] everything brother ram said and then
[1:08:03] they ignored the things brother bram
[1:08:04] said
[1:08:06] because pride
[1:08:09] can't be corrected that's exactly right
[1:08:10] brother can't be correct that's what
[1:08:12] brian preached to on sunday
[1:08:14] they wouldn't be washed it will not
[1:08:16] accept correction
[1:08:17] they will not be beaten and pressured
[1:08:19] and they won't go through the fires of
[1:08:22] tribulation and pressure just daily life
[1:08:27] that's right
[1:08:28] yeah most that's the spirit of pride a
[1:08:30] demon will do that if you won't confess
[1:08:32] it
[1:08:34] very good
[1:08:36] again
[1:08:38] remember he hid the seventh seal from us
[1:08:39] he wouldn't do it when the angel stood
[1:08:41] day by day telling it and he wouldn't do
[1:08:43] it on that one he said this there was
[1:08:45] silence in heaven no one knew it it was
[1:08:47] the coming of the lord
[1:08:51] so why is there silence in heaven i'm
[1:08:52] just going to skip to this brother
[1:08:54] brother now this is just so you know
[1:08:55] this is why some people disagree with me
[1:08:57] but i'm using a quote three years before
[1:08:59] the seals where brother brahm talked
[1:09:01] about there was silence in heaven
[1:09:04] he says the bible says the heavens was
[1:09:05] empty for a space half an hour where is
[1:09:08] this big fellow god then uh see he's in
[1:09:10] christ's shore
[1:09:12] so in other words when the seventh seal
[1:09:14] opens there's silence in heaven for the
[1:09:15] space to have half hour brother brown
[1:09:17] looks in that says why is heaven silent
[1:09:19] because that big fella come down to meet
[1:09:20] his bride in the air amen i believe that
[1:09:23] big fella come down to meet his wife
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:25] hallelujah so heaven's quiet because the
[1:09:28] big guy left and he come down to earth
[1:09:30] to meet christ or to meet the bride in
[1:09:32] the air now i know i'm using a quote
[1:09:35] three years before but it's the only one
[1:09:37] that lines up with all the other quotes
[1:09:39] and the scripture
[1:09:41] because the bible said the angels cease
[1:09:43] not day and night saying holy holy holy
[1:09:44] is the lord god almighty why would they
[1:09:46] stop why would they stop praising god
[1:09:48] because he left
[1:09:49] to rapture the bride
[1:09:54] christ the mystery of god revealed god's
[1:09:56] great mystery of how it's a secret he
[1:09:58] kept it a secret nobody knows nothing
[1:09:59] about it even the angels didn't
[1:10:00] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[1:10:02] that's the reason under our seventh
[1:10:04] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[1:10:06] now here look he says it open now
[1:10:10] remember i showed you the other quote he
[1:10:11] said it wasn't open now he says it's
[1:10:12] open
[1:10:15] there was silence jesus when he was on
[1:10:17] the earth they wanted to know when he
[1:10:19] would come he said it's not even the son
[1:10:21] himself don't know when it's going to
[1:10:22] happen see god has this all to himself
[1:10:25] see how the seventh seal is the day and
[1:10:27] hour god has kept this all to himself
[1:10:31] it's a secret same quote that's the
[1:10:32] reason there was silence in heaven for a
[1:10:34] space half hour seven thunders out of
[1:10:35] their voices john was even forbidden to
[1:10:37] write it see the coming of the lord
[1:10:38] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[1:10:40] of how he will come when he will come
[1:10:43] it's a good thing that he does it amen
[1:10:46] hallelujah church
[1:10:48] i was just going to say can i get amen
[1:10:50] from everybody
[1:10:51] are you just thinking about these things
[1:10:53] and that's good that's good too
[1:10:54] it's good to be silent brother said
[1:10:55] god's in silence too
[1:10:58] same same sermon now the coming of the
[1:11:00] lord is in a mystery we don't know when
[1:11:03] he's coming how he's coming but we know
[1:11:05] he's coming see and so is all the
[1:11:06] mysteries of god waiting for this last
[1:11:08] day and he's already been completed then
[1:11:10] he reveals and shows what he's done oh
[1:11:11] my he never gave his mystery in full
[1:11:14] which is the day in the hour
[1:11:18] there was silence in heaven at the time
[1:11:19] of the rapture
[1:11:21] he never revealed when he would come the
[1:11:23] day and the hour
[1:11:25] skipping ahead
[1:11:29] okay i'm going to skip ahead one more
[1:11:31] time here i'm going to slide i'm almost
[1:11:33] done i want to say a few things 137. you
[1:11:35] bear with me
[1:11:37] everybody take a deep breath can we
[1:11:39] all right now i want you to see how
[1:11:41] brother man finishes the seventh seal
[1:11:42] i'm just gonna read a few quotes
[1:11:45] i just want you to see how humble and
[1:11:47] how simple brother random is at the end
[1:11:49] of this sermon
[1:11:51] i'll tell you you want to talk about a
[1:11:52] confusing sermon when i first time i
[1:11:54] heard this i was totally confused but
[1:11:56] man talks about all these dreams and all
[1:11:57] these visions and all this
[1:12:00] getting the king's sword i'm like what
[1:12:01] does this have to do with the rapture
[1:12:04] and he tells us they're all signs to let
[1:12:06] you know the rapture's closed
[1:12:08] that's what it's all about amen all
[1:12:10] these dreams all these signs all these
[1:12:12] experiences to let you know he was god's
[1:12:14] prophet and that the coming of the lord
[1:12:15] is at hand
[1:12:17] in church that's 56 years ago
[1:12:20] now brother adam just got done talking
[1:12:22] about all these dreams all these visions
[1:12:24] and look what he says now i'm hoping and
[1:12:26] trusting you people realize i'm trying
[1:12:28] to put all this grace all these
[1:12:30] testimonies on jesus christ who's the
[1:12:32] author of all of it
[1:12:34] look what he goes on to say
[1:12:37] may you always bear that in mind be a
[1:12:39] gem in the crown of who jesus christ
[1:12:42] paul said you're jewels gems of his
[1:12:43] crown we want to be gems of the crown of
[1:12:45] jesus christ we don't ever want to put a
[1:12:47] man in it and look what jeffersonville's
[1:12:49] doing
[1:12:51] they say can't not your pastor not
[1:12:53] anybody just brother brandon just
[1:12:54] brother brown just brother bran just
[1:12:55] brother they're putting a man in it
[1:12:57] and we thank god for the man
[1:12:59] but they're making brother brahm the
[1:13:00] whole source of everything
[1:13:02] they're making him equal to jesus christ
[1:13:05] he says you forget he said you
[1:13:08] don't never want to put a man in it you
[1:13:10] forget anything about me
[1:13:12] i'm your brother a sinner saved by grace
