[23:59] Hallelujah you I was just listening to
[24:00] brother cam preach last night and he
[24:01] just brought out that scripture you know
[24:02] Jesus said if you have the faith the
[24:04] size of a mustard
[24:06] seed and we know what a faith is Faith
[24:08] is a revelation it's a substance right
[24:10] so God gives you a substance of his own
[24:12] faith and so we I just thought again wow
[24:14] if we could just have that much
[24:17] Revelation you know then we can speak to
[24:19] the mountain and it'll move by God's
[24:21] grace but it's got to be God's will
[24:22] right it's got to be God's will just
[24:24] like Paul three times said take this
[24:25] away from me take this buffeting me
[24:27] messenger way well he had Faith to
[24:29] believe it but Jesus said no it's my
[24:31] will for you to suffer like that so we
[24:33] want to find the will of God hallelujah
[24:36] but in the same in the same breath here
[24:38] maybe we don't know all God's will for
[24:40] all these situations let's pray God will
[24:42] anoint us with faith how many will do
[24:43] that by God's grace we can speak the
[24:45] word of God to situations and ask God's
[24:49] re or ask God to give us that Revelation
[24:50] for what we have in need of here tonight
[24:52] let's uh have a word of prayer here

[35:01] I'm going to set a timer here just kind
[35:02] of watch My Time by God's
[35:07] grace you know we are we're moving now
[35:10] by God's grace we're moving into this uh
[35:12] this fifth section uh that CI scoffield
[35:14] kind of outlines in his commentary
[35:16] that's the book that's the Bible brother
[35:17] Bram used was CI scoffield he was uh uh
[35:21] he was a pre-trib Rapture teacher yeah
[35:25] and uh a lot of people you know don't
[35:27] agree with that but brother Bram taught
[35:28] it like that and he taught lots of types
[35:29] and shadows of that so that's where we
[35:30] stand and um scoffield has a lot of
[35:33] great thoughts and uh brother Ram just
[35:35] got used to the Bible you know he said
[35:37] there are some things I disagree with
[35:38] you know like with the Trinity and so
[35:39] forth you know we don't believe in three
[35:41] persons we believe in one person but uh
[35:44] you know it's there's so many great
[35:45] thoughts in here from scoffield and
[35:47] brother Ram preached numerous thoughts
[35:48] from scoffield and preached them
[35:51] Hallelujah so uh you know we're going
[35:53] into this this fifth part and this fifth
[35:55] part is God's promise promises to Israel
[35:58] now it was really wonderful we saw the
[36:00] introduction in chapter one and then the
[36:02] next section was the whole world is
[36:04] guilty before God in chapters 1 two and
[36:07] three then in chapter three there's a
[36:08] transition but we're justified by faith
[36:11] for the solution for our guilt and then
[36:14] in chapter five then it transitions
[36:16] again to the Believers walk in the Holy
[36:18] Spirit and that goes through uh chapter
[36:21] 5 6 7 and we just finished eight on
[36:23] Sunday morning Hallelujah now this is
[36:26] just really I'm sorry and then I'm sorry
[36:28] the next one was the final result of the
[36:30] Gospel blessing so Romans 8 scoffield
[36:33] calls it the final result of God's
[36:35] blessing Hallelujah and the blessing of
[36:37] the Holy Ghost Boy and if you ever felt
[36:39] blessed I hope you felt blessed by
[36:40] reading Romans chapter 8 Hallelujah it
[36:43] starts off with no condemnation and it
[36:45] ends with no separation Hallelujah
[36:48] nobody's going to condemn you and nobody
[36:49] can separate you from Jesus's love
[36:51] Hallelujah nobody Hallelujah none and he
[36:54] lists 17 things that cannot separate
[36:56] separate us from the love of God and I
[36:58] love that last one he says any other
[36:59] Creature if there's anything outside of
[37:01] these 16 things not even that one can
[37:04] separate is from God's love hallelujah
[37:06] amen so can I say it like this it's in
[37:07] the bag our Victory is uh paid for
[37:10] hallelujah our Victory is certain our
[37:12] future home is certain Hallelujah church
[37:15] is that right we get to live in the
[37:16] Heavenly City the holy city the New
[37:18] Jerusalem with Jesus hallelujah what a
[37:21] blessing amen and it's quite a shift now
[37:23] though when you go to chapter nine Paul
[37:26] ends chapter eight by saying all these
[37:27] amazing blessings but then he goes right
[37:29] to this thought here in in verse
[37:32] one what a what a what a what a
[37:34] statement he makes here I say the truth
[37:37] in Christ now of course he was telling
[37:38] the truth the whole time but you know as
[37:40] humans we say things like that to put
[37:41] more emphasis on it right Paul was
[37:43] telling the truth all through the first
[37:44] eight chapters but here he just wants to
[37:46] make a true statement so he repeats it I
[37:49] don't lie of course he doesn't didn't
[37:50] lie in the other verses he wrote my
[37:53] conscience also Bears me witness in the
[37:55] Holy Ghost so Paul's conscience was a
[37:58] witness to him that what he's going to
[38:00] say was the truth in verse two that I
[38:02] have a great heaviness and continual
[38:05] sorrow in my heart now chch just stop
[38:08] there a moment here's the man who just
[38:09] said I have no
[38:11] condemnation he said I got the victory
[38:13] through Jesus Christ who can be against
[38:15] me if God is for me nobody can lay
[38:18] anything to my charges nothing can
[38:21] separate me from the love of God but yet
[38:23] he says I still have a great heaviness
[38:26] and continual sorrow of heart now church
[38:29] this is a great mystery to me and I
[38:31] believe church this is the mystery of
[38:33] the human mind Paul says we have three
[38:35] parts we have a body a spirit and then
[38:38] we have a soul right it's amazing Paul
[38:42] can say rejoice in the lord always and
[38:45] again I say rejoice did he not say that
[38:47] when I preached on the book of
[38:48] Philippians he's saying always Rejoice
[38:50] we know that must be a soul thing right
[38:52] it must be a soul desire right it just
[38:54] be the nature of the Christian is to
[38:56] rejoice rejoicing God am and the same
[38:58] man that says that now can come down and
[39:00] say I I I have continual sorrow in my
[39:04] heart for Israel and church it's this
[39:07] great mystery of the Christian Life
[39:08] right you can be beaten down but you're
[39:11] never defeated amen right you can be
[39:13] under fear but you're never you're never
[39:16] you're never forsaken amen right I mean
[39:19] it's yeah that love that scripture
[39:21] always bearing about in the my body the
[39:23] marks of the Lord Jesus yes sir brother
[39:25] Hallelujah
[39:27] don't you love that I just love I just
[39:29] find it so amazing he can just give us a
[39:31] whole list and give us all these
[39:33] questions just like God did to job all
[39:35] these questions are meant for us to
[39:37] think about and and and more Ponder more
[39:40] deeply God's love for us and make us
[39:43] happy and make us rejoice and brother BR
[39:45] said when you read Romans 8 it takes all
[39:47] the wind out of Satan's
[39:49] sails in other words you don't you don't
[39:51] feel like the enem is hot on your Trail
[39:52] anymore you feel like you got some
[39:54] distance between you and the devil amen
[39:56] amen you got some peace you got a season
[39:58] of rest hallelujah amen that's what
[40:01] Romans 8 does but then just one a
[40:04] mention of one subject Israel takes him
[40:07] from all this Joy oh I'm sorrow I'm
[40:09] sorrowful in another way
[40:13] Hallelujah this is the mystery of the
[40:15] Christian walk right we experience all
[40:18] we have all these blessings all this Joy
[40:20] all this peace all this assurance
[40:22] Blessed Assurance
[40:24] Hallelujah but then you could say one
[40:26] word
[40:27] Israel and it turned you to a different
[40:30] state of emotion right thank God we know
[40:32] how to control our emotions right we've
[40:33] been preaching on that Hallelujah and
[40:36] Paul says I have this continual it's
[40:38] like an unending sorrow in the Greek it
[40:40] means unceasing grief or pain so the
[40:45] same man that says always Rejoice he
[40:47] says I've got this constant pain in my
[40:49] heart Hallelujah so don't feel bad you
[40:52] come to church you know sometimes I feel
[40:53] bad I'll come to church I'll dance I'll
[40:55] shout I'll rejoice and then I'll leave
[40:56] and I'll hear just some maybe a family
[40:58] member struggling or something and then
[41:00] my heart just Falls and in the past I've
[41:02] been discouraged about that but after
[41:04] reading that now I don't feel
[41:06] discouraged that's the normal part of
[41:08] the Christian walk it's the ups and
[41:10] downs right it's it's understanding you
[41:12] have confidence in God but when but then
[41:14] when you see you know struggles you see
[41:16] people you know in this case they're
[41:17] blinded to the gospel amen when we see
[41:20] our family members blind to the gospel
[41:21] it should make us
[41:23] sorrowful we should have a feeling for
[41:25] them we should have a desire to see God
[41:28] save them
[41:29] Hallelujah so we can go from rejoicing
[41:32] and all you did a Jericho March right
[41:33] here right on Sunday we all had a
[41:35] wonderful time in the Lord but then
[41:36] somebody can say one word your mom or
[41:39] your dad right or your neighbor or your
[41:42] cooworker they can say one word and all
[41:44] of a sudden all that happiness it just
[41:45] comes down to a real solemn a real
[41:47] serious feeling that you have and that's
[41:50] the experience of a holy ghost filled
[41:51] Saint and the church said how many
[41:54] believe Paul was filled with the Holy
[41:55] Ghost amen right from the scales fell
[41:56] from his eyes ananas prayed for him he
[41:59] received the Holy Ghost
[42:01] Hallelujah remember God even withheld
[42:03] some of his healing at times with his
[42:05] eyes so I just find this amazing and he
[42:08] has to say this I'm not lying he said
[42:10] I'm not lying I've told you all these
[42:11] things he said but when I someone talks
[42:13] about Israel I have a continual
[42:16] heaviness in my heart for them the
[42:19] church God put that there for a reason I
[42:22] believe God put it there so Paul would
[42:23] go preach to them amen hallelujah so if
[42:26] you got a little sorrow in your heart if
[42:27] you got a little feeling in your heart
[42:28] for somebody it's there to motivate you
[42:30] to pray for them or go talk to them or
[42:33] share a Bible with them or what invite
[42:35] them to church amen that's why it's
[42:37] there Hallelujah so we see what a what a
[42:41] what what a contrast he can go from to
[42:43] there's nothing can separate me from
[42:44] God's love I have no charges Hallelujah
[42:47] the devil can't put one charge on me but
[42:49] then someone mentioned Israel and now
[42:51] he's
[42:53] sorrowful went from all this rejoicing
[42:55] to to sorrow so fast that's normal for a
[42:59] Christian Hallelujah and look at verse
[43:02] three this is a true sign this man had
[43:06] the spirit of Christ for I could wish
[43:08] that myself were a curse from Christ
[43:12] this is equal to basically saying he was
[43:14] going to hell right a
[43:17] cursed for my brethren my Kinsmen
[43:21] according to the flesh this is how much
[43:24] he loved his people anybody got any
[43:26] family members that are lost but you
[43:27] still love them so much with all your
[43:29] heart Hallelujah you you would do
[43:32] anything if they could get baptized in
[43:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ full
[43:36] of immers fully immersed in water you do
[43:40] anything and Paul says I wish that I
[43:42] could be cursed so that they could see
[43:45] the gospel what a statement does that
[43:48] remind you of anybody from the book of
[43:49] Exodus
[43:52] Moses right God told Moses I got think
[43:54] it's Moos Exodus 32 from I'm not
[43:56] mistaken on my notes Exodus 32:31 Moses
[44:00] returned to the Lord and said oh this
[44:01] people have sinned a great sin and have
[44:03] made them gods of gold yet now if thou
[44:07] will forgive their sin if not blot me I
[44:10] pray out of the book which thou Hast
[44:13] written now look even he'd even wish he
[44:16] was blotted out for
[44:20] idolators how many ever seen idolators
[44:22] in the last few weeks or months people
[44:24] that worship money that worship uh their
[44:28] physical
[44:29] appearance right and in our case there's
[44:32] people that worship brother brandom it's
[44:33] so sad it's it's heresy people worship
[44:36] anything they worship their car they
[44:37] worship their job right they worship
[44:40] their Pastor they worship
[44:41] anything and Paul says I wish I was
[44:44] cursed so these idolators would not be
[44:46] blotted out of God's
[44:49] book it's a true sign he's a prophet
[44:52] right Paul true sign he's a real
[44:54] believer I he's a real sign he's got the
[44:57] spirit of Christ Hallelujah why because
[44:59] Christ became a curse for us hallelujah
[45:02] remember Galatians 3 says it now before
[45:05] we move on though God said Moses
[45:07] whosoever has sinned against me him will
[45:10] I blot out of my book what a paradox to
[45:13] live in I wish I could just be I would
[45:15] do anything to get these people saved I
[45:18] myself I would give up my salvation if
[45:20] it were possible so that these people
[45:22] could be saved I make an exchange and
[45:24] you know if if Paul had done that God
[45:27] would have saved him anyway right
[45:29] because God's a god of Mercy amen God of
[45:32] love but he can't do that each person
[45:34] has their own free moral agency like
[45:37] Joshua said choose you this day whom you
[45:39] will serve Hallelujah and the Bible said
[45:41] God will give every man and woman
[45:43] according to their own Works Hallelujah
[45:45] that they've done in the flesh
[45:47] Hallelujah Galatians 313 said Christ has
[45:51] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[45:53] he's brought us back he's purchased us
[45:56] and brought us into the faith being made
[45:59] a curse for us for it is written cursed
[46:01] is everyone that hangeth on a tree now
[46:04] why was he cursed so we could be blessed
[46:07] amen realize that church the reason
[46:09] you're blessed tonight is because Christ
[46:11] was cursed for you am that's the only
[46:13] reason right now some of us have good
[46:16] parents like Naomi's got some wonderful
[46:18] parents
[46:19] Hallelujah others you got some real good
[46:21] Godly Parents I you got some good Godly
[46:23] Parents brother R yeah he's like yeah
[46:27] Hallelujah and thank God for that but
[46:30] really Christ took the curse of your
[46:32] parents Christ took the curse of every
[46:35] person he died not just for our sins but
[46:37] the sins of the whole world praise God
[46:40] Amen so this is the love of Christ we
[46:42] can see Paul has the love of Christ
[46:44] Moses has the love of Christ I wish I
[46:47] could be cursed so that this person
[46:49] could be saved remember brother Ram said
[46:50] if you want to see somebody go to hell
[46:52] he said you probably not even saved he
[46:54] said you need to come down to this altar
[46:55] right here here if you want to see
[46:57] anybody lost if you want to see anybody
[47:00] burn or anybody suffer or torment your
[47:02] heart is not right with
[47:04] God right we should uh because Christ
[47:08] was cursed that we might be
[47:10] blessed church that's the whole Spirit
[47:12] of giving right sometimes you know we
[47:14] give we don't have a lot of money or or
[47:16] maybe we don't have a lot of time but we
[47:18] give anyway and it feels like it's a
[47:19] burden but it's the reason we give is to
[47:22] bless other people we live for the
[47:24] blessing that's what Jesus did
[47:26] Hallelujah he lived for the blessing and
[47:28] that's what we've got to live for live
[47:30] for the blessing of sacrificing for
[47:32] others praise
[47:33] God may God give us wisdom this week or
[47:36] next few days here to see how can we be
[47:38] a blessing to
[47:39] others who can we or who can we help and
[47:43] how can I lay aside my life how can I
[47:45] lay down my life as Jesus said for
[47:47] somebody
[47:48] else sometimes it's driving to pick them
[47:51] up for church right right church
[47:54] sometimes it's just dropping off off
[47:56] praying for them when they're sick right
[47:57] just stopping by or dropping off some
[47:59] groceries when they need some
[48:01] groceries right
[48:03] Church be a blessing you know Jesus gave
[48:05] those six things you can do or people do
[48:08] and they're given eternal life in

[48:36] nation that were not the children of God
[48:38] but God made them his
[48:40] children right they were in Egypt they
[48:43] were slaves to idolatry but God brought
[48:46] them out he separated them from their
[48:49] from their sinful past right and God
[48:51] adopted them and he brings them into his
[48:54] country Israel amen
[48:56] he makes them possess the promised land

[49:14] people that preached the last 40 50
[49:17] hundred years praise God we're still
[49:18] living off the benefits of isusa Street
[49:20] amen hallelujah Martin Luther and John
[49:23] Wesley and all these Mighty Men of God
[49:25] brother we're living off of their
[49:27] testimonies we're blessed because of
[49:29] their Ministries praise God we wouldn't
[49:31] be where we are today without all of
[49:33] their efforts and all their sacrifices
[49:35] Hallelujah that's what Paul's saying
[49:37] here these were the Israelites they had
[49:40] the adoption they became the children of
[49:42] God didn't God tell Pharaoh he said let
[49:45] my son go out let my children go out and
[49:47] worship me in the wilderness praise God
[49:49] my people they also had the glory they
[49:52] had the covenants praise God they had
[49:55] the GI giving of the law and the service
[49:57] of God and the promises praise God what
[50:00] a blessing man if you had all that you'd
[50:02] feel pretty good wouldn't you but guess
[50:03] what church we got we got all that amen
[50:07] doesn't Galatians say you're adopted
[50:09] remember the brother Ram said the
[50:10] triumphal Capstone of the Holy Ghost is
[50:13] Galatians 4 because you are Sons God has
[50:16] sent his Spirit into your hearts amen
[50:19] you've got the spirit of adoption
[50:21] Hallelujah that's right you've got the
[50:24] New Covenant the the the blood Covenant
[50:26] of Jesus's blood you've got the law of
[50:30] the Holy Spirit we're not under the law
[50:31] of Moses we're under the law of the Holy
[50:33] Spirit you've got that
[50:35] amen and you got the service of God and
[50:38] you got the
[50:40] promises
[50:41] amen but Israel had these as well in the
[50:44] previous form the old Covenant and the
[50:47] Bible said now we've got better promises
[50:49] amen we got a better Covenant praise God
[50:52] verse five who are the fathers and of
[50:55] whom as concerning the flesh Christ came
[50:59] now Paul's saying look at this wonderful
[51:00] people that I wish I could be cursed for
[51:03] even Christ came to them this is such a
[51:06] wonderful people even the Messiah came
[51:09] to Israel and Christ who's overall
[51:12] finishing verse 5 God bless forever
[51:16] amen so he's saying let me remind you
[51:19] this is the people I wish could be saved
[51:21] the people God visited the people God
[51:23] adopted the people that God gave C and
[51:26] Promises I wish I could be cursed so
[51:28] they could see what I see praise
[51:30] God didn't brother Ram say living for
[51:32] others is eternal life isn't that what
[51:35] eternal life is I'm living for them I
[51:38] just want to see them saved I'm I'm so
[51:40] thankful I'm saved but my heart's broken
[51:42] I want to see them saved
[51:45] hallelujah
[51:47] hallelujah this is a real man of God
[51:49] right here verse six not as though the
[51:51] word of God have taken none effect for
[51:53] they are not all Israel which which are
[51:55] Israel so now he gets down into this
[51:57] truth that just because someone was born
[51:59] an Israelite doesn't mean they're saved
[52:03] right not all Israel is Israel so these
[52:06] are amazing privileges but the true
[52:09] Israel he said is the elected Israel is
[52:12] what it's going to get into next here by
[52:13] God's grace verse seven neither because
[52:16] they are the Seed of Abraham are they
[52:18] all children but in Isaac shall thy seed
[52:21] be called Hallelujah that is they which
[52:25] are the the children of the flesh these
[52:26] are not the children of God but the
[52:28] children of the promise are counted for
[52:31] the seed so Paul says even within Israel
[52:35] there's children of God that are
[52:36] children of the flesh they're just
[52:38] Israelis according to the flesh you know
[52:40] they keep circumcision they keep the
[52:41] Mosaic law he said but then there's
[52:43] children of the promise who the promise
[52:45] was given for and I'll say like this
[52:47] those who obey the promises Hallelujah
[52:49] keep the promises of
[52:51] God right because we all know Jesus
[52:53] rebuked the Pharisees uh they they they
[52:55] paid tithe of cumin and the mint right
[52:58] they they measured the exact exact
[53:00] tithing on their oils and everything
[53:02] like that but Jesus said you're of your
[53:03] father the devil right he said you
[53:06] missed the weigher parts of the law see
[53:10] they were born Israelis but they weren't
[53:12] living they weren't they were missing
[53:13] the promise of Christ Hallelujah that's
[53:16] what we can't miss today we can't miss
[53:18] the promise of Christ today that's why
[53:20] brother Ram's Ministry is so important
[53:22] brother Ram gave us I wrote it in my
[53:23] book and brother I've got free books for
[53:25] you I've written two books if I'll give
[53:27] them to you after service I put it in
[53:28] the last chapter brother Ram gave us 30
[53:31] thus sayith the Lords from the Bible
[53:34] Paul was brother man was just finding
[53:36] what what Paul taught restoring it to
[53:38] the church and then saying that's thus
[53:40] sayith the Lord and most churches reject
[53:42] it right but it's laying right here in
[53:45] the scriptures
[53:46] hallelujah hallelujah brother brandom uh
[53:50] finished the mystery of God and there's
[53:52] 12 there's 12 doctrines that are called
[53:54] Mysteries and brother Ram revealed those
[53:56] To Us by the Holy Spirit and how'd he do
[53:58] it he just gave us more verses to
[54:00] explain it like the godhead the Rapture
[54:03] Israel's blindness Christ in you the
[54:05] hope of glory the mystery of godliness
[54:07] my there's 12 of them we could I could I
[54:09] need I need my reference there's so many
[54:11] I forget him Hallelujah but brother R
[54:13] finished all those Hallelujah and then
[54:15] he foretold the future Hallelujah on
[54:17] numerous occasions I'll show this
[54:19] because brother Rod's here in 1965
[54:21] brother Rod brother Braham had a vision
[54:23] and he had a vision of the true the
[54:25] original book of Acts church and they
[54:26] were marching it was all women and they
[54:28] they marched past him he said glory to
[54:30] God then he had a vision of the American
[54:32] church and they walked by dancing to
[54:34] rock and roll and they were really
[54:36] immorally dressed they had uh they were
[54:38] almost there the women the backside was
[54:40] almost naked and he and then he cried
[54:42] before God he said God is we after all
[54:44] this preaching we've done is that all we
[54:46] can produce but the voice said that's
[54:49] not the bride that's the American church
[54:52] he said now is coming forth the bride
[54:54] and then he saw another group of women
[54:56] it looked just like the women at the
[54:58] beginning Hallelujah that because Jesus
[55:01] is the first and the last Hallelujah and
[55:04] he said then in that group was a woman
[55:07] who was representing the nation of
[55:08] America that was proving there was going
[55:10] to be a holy church in the United States
[55:13] of America just like all the other
[55:15] nations praise God
[55:17] Amen and and and then brother you know
[55:19] 40 years
[55:20] later look at the mega churches what do
[55:22] they got rock and roll like got they got
[55:25] a lot of half- naked women in the
[55:26] churches
[55:27] too and my mother was raised in the
[55:29] Assemblies of God and I told her that
[55:31] vision and she said I I was raised in
[55:33] Assembly of God she said I never thought
[55:35] rock and roll would come in but she saw
[55:36] rock and roll first then rap and now
[55:38] they got country they got everything now
[55:41] just like the prophet of God said
[55:43] hallelujah amen hallelujah what a
[55:46] blessing and so you know we have we have
[55:48] these proofs laid out before us and we
[55:51] must accept the worthy we must be the
[55:53] children of the promise Hallelujah amen
[55:55] there's more promises in the Bible than
[55:57] what you know we love the denominational
[55:58] people we don't like their system right
[56:00] because the their system denies the word
[56:02] of God but we love the people but
[56:04] they're forgetting some of the promises
[56:07] Hallelujah they're forgetting the
[56:08] promise of the Rapture Hallelujah that
[56:11] one day Jesus is going to snatch away
[56:13] his bride in the moment and the
[56:15] twinkling of an eye
[56:17] Hallelujah they're forgetting the
[56:18] promise that men should cut their hair
[56:20] and women should have long uncut hair
[56:22] they're forgetting that promise amen
[56:25] they're forgetting the promise that God
[56:26] made a male a male and a female a
[56:30] female Hallelujah that's a simple
[56:32] Genesis one promise I mean you can't
[56:34] miss that in the very first if you miss
[56:35] that in the first chapter of the Bible
[56:36] you're going to mess up the rest
[56:37] Hallelujah if you miss that one it's so
[56:40] plain they're missing the marriage and
[56:42] divorce one man one woman for life until
[56:45] death Hallelujah but most churches
[56:47] promote adultery right even fornication
[56:50] they promote all these things in
[56:51] homosexuality we could go on and on and
[56:52] on but the true church has got to look
[56:55] at the end just like she did in the book
[56:56] of Acts Hallelujah and she will and
[56:59] we're a part of that Hallelujah because
[57:01] God sent brother brandom to point us
[57:03] back to the Bible amen thank you Jesus
[57:07] now we see that in verse eight this is
[57:10] that is they which are the children of
[57:12] the flesh these are not the children of
[57:13] God but the children of the promise are
[57:16] counted for the seed verse n for This Is
[57:18] The Word of Promise at this time will I
[57:20] come and Sarah will have a son so for
[57:24] for Israel it was all about the promised
[57:26] son Oh Glory Isaac but our promised son
[57:30] is Jesus Christ amen the Son of God
[57:34] hallelujah
[57:35] am Heaven's hero right Heaven's son
[57:38] Hallelujah The Treasure of Heaven amen
[57:41] and our promise is that son the spirit
[57:43] of the son living in our souls that's
[57:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Jesus
[57:48] Promised it Jesus called it the promise
[57:50] of the father in Luke
[57:52] 24:49 and it's the it's the holy ghost
[57:55] in Acts chapter 7 that the Sanhedrin
[57:58] Council rejected and and and Stephen
[58:00] said you always do resist the Holy Ghost
[58:03] and he's talking to Jews that said we're
[58:06] the we're the people of God we've got
[58:07] the promises we've got the covenants but
[58:09] Stephen's saying the promise is the Holy
[58:11] Ghost now Hallelujah this is the message
[58:14] of the hour God is fulfilling this now
[58:17] it's still today even today 2,000 years
[58:19] later it's still all about the promise
[58:21] hallelujah amen who's living for the
[58:23] promise of the Holy ghost who's living
[58:25] for the promise of the restored book of
[58:27] Acts Church who's living for the promise
[58:29] of the Rapture
[58:31] Hallelujah while the whole world was
[58:33] watching the Super Bowl I was working on
[58:35] my YouTube video and got it out on
[58:36] Sunday night by God's grace let them
[58:38] watch that trash I mean that that's what
[58:40] they feed
[58:42] on right uh that's what vultures feed on
[58:44] is dead
[58:46] stuff but Eagles right well eagles they
[58:48] they do get the so getting a little
[58:50] technical Eagles do eat some uh roadkill
[58:52] sometimes but Eagles normally like the
[58:54] the fresh meat Hallelujah they they
[58:56] usually like to get their own fish but
[58:58] there's some pretty mean Eagles out
[58:59] there my wife and I saw one one time
[59:02] and an osprey got the fish and landed
[59:05] but then the eagle come knocked the
[59:07] Osprey out and took the fish they don't
[59:09] mess around when it comes to territory
[59:10] Hallelujah that's how we should be with
[59:12] the devil right we should knock the
[59:14] devil out of our territory Hallelujah
[59:17] knock him out of your thought life knock
[59:18] him out of your your bad habits knock
[59:20] him out Hallelujah draw night to God
[59:23] resist Satan and Satan will
[59:25] hallelujah amen but it's all about the
[59:28] promise for this day hallelujah it's
[59:31] more than just speaking in tongues like
[59:33] I was raised in that church and to speak
[59:34] in tongues they said that's the evidence
[59:36] but I saw a lot of people speak in
[59:37] tongues that didn't have the Holy Ghost
[59:39] they might have had a gift of the Holy
[59:41] Ghost but you got to have more than a
[59:42] gift you got to have the giver
[59:44] hallelujah amen hallelujah and that's
[59:47] the promise today the promise today is
[59:50] Christ in us the hope of glory
[59:52] hallelujah amen where you're sealed not
[59:54] just to the next Revival you're sealed
[59:56] to the day of your Redemption Hallelujah
[59:59] Jesus repeats this in Acts 1:4 and 5 he
[1:00:02] says go up to Jerusalem and wait until
[1:00:04] you're new with power from on high and
[1:00:06] he called it the promise of the father
[1:00:08] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost your
[1:00:11] soul is baptized your soul is immersed
[1:00:14] with the spirit of God Amen and how do
[1:00:16] you know because you can say amen and
[1:00:18] believe every word of God
[1:00:21] hallelujah that's how you know my soul
[1:00:24] is immersed in the spirit of God
[1:00:26] everything the word says I believe it
[1:00:27] Hallelujah and I'll do my best by God's
[1:00:30] grace to live it amen when the Lord
[1:00:32] shows me I'm wrong I'm I say Jesus
[1:00:34] forgive me uh try me again let me be
[1:00:37] stronger this time Hallelujah let me
[1:00:39] take revenge on the enemy who who uh who
[1:00:41] caused me to sin
[1:00:43] Hallelujah and the Bible said we're even
[1:00:45] drawn away by our own lust help me to
[1:00:47] overcome the lust of My Flesh
[1:00:49] Hallelujah then Peter says This Promise
[1:00:52] was fulfilled in Acts 2:33 we received
[1:00:55] the promise of the father Hallelujah
[1:00:58] that's why I'm so glad we sung that on
[1:00:59] Sunday I'm one of them amen I've danced
[1:01:03] and screamed and shouted and cried till
[1:01:05] my ribs hurt and I feel like if I sing
[1:01:08] or dance or cry one more time I'm G to
[1:01:10] die and I've ask God have mercy on me in
[1:01:13] other words I know what it's like to be
[1:01:14] there on the day of Pentecost I've had a
[1:01:17] Pentecostal experience that's what you
[1:01:19] and I need we need a Pentecostal
[1:01:21] experience Hallelujah every and brother
[1:01:23] like brother said every now and then we
[1:01:25] need another uh we need another
[1:01:27] experience Hallelujah we need another
[1:01:28] boohoo and hallelujah amen another time
[1:01:32] of rejoicing Hallelujah another time of
[1:01:34] surrender to God
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:01:37] amen it's a promise Hallelujah so see
[1:01:41] just as the the true Israel in the Old
[1:01:43] Testament had to be under the promise of
[1:01:45] the son Isaac we've got to be under the
[1:01:47] promise of Heaven's son Jesus Christ and
[1:01:50] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:52] Hallelujah that's what he said I'm Gonna
[1:01:54] Leave but I'm going to send you the
[1:01:55] comforter I'm going to send you the
[1:01:57] spirit of truth and the spirit of truth
[1:01:58] don't lie Hallelujah that's we got a lot
[1:02:01] of churches today and preachers lying
[1:02:03] they're telling lies Hallelujah but God
[1:02:05] help us to tell the truth hallelujah
[1:02:07] amen Romans
[1:02:10] 9:10 again the natural Israel and not
[1:02:13] only this but when Rebecca also had
[1:02:15] conceived by one even by Our Father
[1:02:18] Isaac for the children now here I want
[1:02:20] to look at this here just for a moment
[1:02:22] for the children being not yet born
[1:02:25] neither having done any good or evil
[1:02:27] that the purpose of God according to
[1:02:29] election might stand not of works but of
[1:02:33] him that
[1:02:35] calleth I love this as Paul breaks now
[1:02:38] into this
[1:02:39] election now Church election means
[1:02:44] chosen so see each person must do
[1:02:47] according to the purpose of God
[1:02:49] according to God's
[1:02:52] choosing God chose you to be his child
[1:02:55] God chose you to the adoption amen God
[1:02:58] chose you because he knew you'd believe
[1:02:59] the promise
[1:03:01] Hallelujah in this case he's going to
[1:03:03] get to Jacob and Esau well who really
[1:03:04] wanted the word Esau didn't want it
[1:03:08] right he God knew Jacob would want it
[1:03:11] and now he got it the wrong way and he
[1:03:13] paid for it
[1:03:14] too but eventually after he got all that
[1:03:17] nonsense beat out of him amen by the
[1:03:19] angel wrestling the angel once he got
[1:03:21] all that nonsense beat out him he said
[1:03:23] I'm a new creature don't call me Jacob
[1:03:25] don't call me supplanter call me Prince
[1:03:28] with power with God and man hallelujah
[1:03:31] amen what's he wrestled that angel and
[1:03:33] got over all his deceptive conniving
[1:03:36] ways he came out of there a new person
[1:03:38] praise God
[1:03:40] Amen that's why he types the baptism of
[1:03:42] the Holy Ghost Abraham types God the
[1:03:45] Father father Abraham Isaac types the
[1:03:48] son the promised son but Jacob types the
[1:03:51] Holy Ghost CU he wrestled with God until
[1:03:53] he was changed on the inside
[1:03:56] Hallelujah he had a real Holy Ghost
[1:03:58] experience Hallelujah and now he's a
[1:04:01] prince he's a new man he's got the
[1:04:03] spirit filling him hallelujah amen
[1:04:06] hallelujah father son Holy Ghost now the
[1:04:09] Holy Ghost is guiding him and he's got a
[1:04:12] new name Hallelujah and the Bible said
[1:04:14] the f the name of the family of God in
[1:04:16] heaven and earth is Lord Jesus
[1:04:19] Christ Hallelujah you got a new name
[1:04:21] church when you got baptized in the name
[1:04:23] of the Lord Jesus Christ you got that
[1:04:25] name Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:30] amen that's wonderful praise God so
[1:04:34] before you were born I'm applying this
[1:04:35] to you and I now before you were born
[1:04:38] God already chose
[1:04:40] you and I can prove that with Ephesians
[1:04:43] 1:4 and5 hallelujah oh I love this verse
[1:04:46] don't you brother Rod I was chosen in
[1:04:49] Christ where was I chosen you know some
[1:04:51] of the times the children ask me we're
[1:04:52] looking at pictures from a few years ago
[1:04:54] and G he's like where am I at I can't
[1:04:57] explain all that you know but because
[1:04:59] it's kind of she's a little immature for
[1:05:00] all that discussion but I just tell her
[1:05:02] honey you were in the mind of
[1:05:05] Christ Hallelujah Ephesians
[1:05:10] 1 four
[1:05:13] five according as he hath chosen Us in
[1:05:15] him before the foundation of world see
[1:05:19] that's where God elected you in the mind
[1:05:21] of God you didn't pre-exist as a a
[1:05:24] separate being no but you were a thought
[1:05:26] of God you were an attribute of God you
[1:05:28] were in God's
[1:05:30] mind brother Braham said you were in
[1:05:32] God's family album
[1:05:34] Hallelujah he had all the everybody in
[1:05:36] his album and his family he knew
[1:05:38] everybody and you were in The Bride
[1:05:40] section of the book hallelujah praise
[1:05:43] God thank you
[1:05:46] Jesus so see Jacob was in the mind of
[1:05:49] God then and see Church your Works will
[1:05:53] prove where you you were at before the
[1:05:54] foundation of the world right if you
[1:05:56] want that promise how many want the
[1:05:58] promise of the Holy Ghost amen I'm
[1:06:00] talking about all of God's blessings
[1:06:02] Hallelujah not just being born again
[1:06:04] yeah that but after that we need years
[1:06:05] of service right we need fruits of the
[1:06:07] Holy Spirit we want to mature with our
[1:06:09] gifts Hallelujah all like like the Bible
[1:06:12] said more fruit much fruit he that
[1:06:14] abides in me will bring forth much fruit
[1:06:16] not just fruit and more fruit but much
[1:06:18] fruit praise God that the father might
[1:06:20] be glorified
[1:06:21] Hallelujah that's what we need by the
[1:06:23] grace of God God but where did he choose
[1:06:25] you he chose you in Christ before the
[1:06:28] foundation World God knew Jacob would
[1:06:30] want the spiritual
[1:06:33] blessings I'm so thankful for the first
[1:06:35] 19 years of my life I ran from the
[1:06:37] spiritual
[1:06:38] blessings but there had to come a time
[1:06:41] where I had to turn over and God knew
[1:06:44] that right I used to be the one that
[1:06:46] hated Church the most of all maybe maybe
[1:06:47] not the most out of all my brothers but
[1:06:49] I didn't like going to church I was I
[1:06:50] didn't like it but when I turned 19 when
[1:06:53] I saw that that I saw uh Tim Anderson
[1:06:55] that football player rais his hands and
[1:06:57] I was there I repented of my sins I said
[1:06:59] what a shame if that six foot six guy
[1:07:02] can raise his hands what about
[1:07:04] me well I've wasted all these 19 years
[1:07:07] no more I'm surrendering to Jesus
[1:07:09] hallelujah praise God hallelujah that's
[1:07:12] right I recognize it that's the moment
[1:07:15] where I transfer I I get changed into a
[1:07:18] new being praise God that's the moment
[1:07:20] God knew would come God orchestrated
[1:07:22] that event in my life God God
[1:07:24] orchestrated your events of your life
[1:07:26] Hallelujah he knew when you'd surrender
[1:07:28] he knew when you draw night to him cuz
[1:07:31] he was drawing you hallelujah amen
[1:07:37] amen and that's the key church that's
[1:07:39] the key now this chapter brother R said
[1:07:41] and everybody knows this not just
[1:07:42] brother Ram everybody knows this Romans
[1:07:44] nine is all about predestination this is
[1:07:46] the sovereignty of God chapter have you
[1:07:47] ever heard that brother this is the
[1:07:49] sovereignty of God chapter because Paul
[1:07:51] breaks it down like really God just made
[1:07:53] V vessels to honor and God made Vessels
[1:07:55] Of Dishonor and who's going to tell God
[1:07:58] I don't like what you did who's going to
[1:08:00] rebuke God who's going to get God to
[1:08:03] change his mind uh the answer is
[1:08:05] nobody God does what he wants right but
[1:08:08] we don't we we didn't see that before
[1:08:10] the foundation world all we see is what
[1:08:12] we see right now all we see is we see
[1:08:14] the word of God we see the promises of
[1:08:16] God and if you react and you're hungry
[1:08:19] for the the the the spirit of God and if
[1:08:21] you want the promises of God that proves
[1:08:23] to you now that you are a child of God
[1:08:26] hallelujah if you want the promise of
[1:08:28] God like Jacob want the promise of God
[1:08:30] if you'll do anything to get to heaven
[1:08:32] if you'll do anything to be in the
[1:08:33] Rapture you know you're a child of the
[1:08:35] promise hallelujah amen amen I won't let
[1:08:38] the Super Bowl keep me out of the
[1:08:40] Rapture I won't let any pet sins or
[1:08:42] secret sins I won't let any of that keep
[1:08:44] me I'm going all the way just to see him
[1:08:47] Hallelujah like that song I'm going all
[1:08:49] the way just to see him the one who
[1:08:51] suffered and died for me Hallelujah
[1:08:57] I think that one verse says I might have
[1:08:58] to walk by myself but I'll see
[1:09:02] him might have to walk on my by myself
[1:09:06] but I'll see him I might have to walk by
[1:09:09] myself but I see him the one who
[1:09:12] suffered and died for
[1:09:15] me hallelujah praise
[1:09:18] God hallelujah I didn't always feel that
[1:09:21] way but what happened something happened
[1:09:24] praise God
[1:09:25] Amen I was elected by the grace of
[1:09:29] God in the Greek it actually means
[1:09:31] election means the act of picking out or
[1:09:35] choosing it's God's Free Will by which
[1:09:37] before the foundation world he decreed
[1:09:39] His blessings to certain persons the
[1:09:42] decree made from Choice by which he
[1:09:45] determined to bless certain persons
[1:09:47] through Christ by Grace
[1:09:51] Hallelujah so God has a purpose a
[1:09:53] choosing As Romans 9:11 says not of
[1:09:56] works but of him that calls see God had
[1:09:59] called Esau God had called Jacob but
[1:10:01] only one of them came and God knew which
[1:10:04] one would
[1:10:05] come right you have to come Jesus said
[1:10:08] you have to take up your cross and
[1:10:09] follow me he said if you don't take up a
[1:10:11] cross you're not my
[1:10:13] disciple so the election is proven in
[1:10:16] our sight the election is proven by who
[1:10:19] obeys Jesus if you love me keep my
[1:10:21] commands if you love me take up your
[1:10:23] cross every day and follow me Hallelujah
[1:10:25] Church we've all got things in our lives
[1:10:27] we wish we could
[1:10:30] change do you ever you know ever had a
[1:10:32] week like I I have a good I have
[1:10:33] sometimes weeks like this I'll be so
[1:10:35] happy leaving church but then sometimes
[1:10:36] something will happen and I'll just feel
[1:10:37] like trapped sometimes like I just can't
[1:10:39] get out of this right why can't this how
[1:10:42] many times have I prayed to God why
[1:10:44] can't this certain thing change am I the
[1:10:46] only one anybody got an amen you know we
[1:10:49] can be so happy but then we look at
[1:10:51] certain parts of our lives and say why
[1:10:52] doesn't this change
[1:10:54] remember all those questions God gave to
[1:10:57] job the questions promote Fellowship it
[1:11:00] promotes conversation with god amen
[1:11:03] hallelujah that's why God makes us
[1:11:05] that's why God lets us go through that
[1:11:07] so we can ask questions meditate on the
[1:11:09] things of God didn't David say I
[1:11:12] meditated on the word of God day and
[1:11:14] night and now because of like that I'm a
[1:11:16] tree planted by rivers of Living Water
[1:11:19] amen and my leaves don't wither amen
[1:11:22] because I'm meditating on the of God how
[1:11:24] does my life how does this how does my
[1:11:26] life fit the word of God why is my life
[1:11:28] going this direction and you just think
[1:11:30] about the scriptures all the time Church
[1:11:31] keep thinking about it one of these days
[1:11:32] a revelation is going to drop down from
[1:11:34] heaven Hallelujah and you're going to
[1:11:36] know why God has allowed you to go
[1:11:38] through some
[1:11:39] suffering or some questions why does my
[1:11:42] life have to be like this I would do
[1:11:43] anything to change this yet it doesn't
[1:11:46] change see we got to trust in God we got
[1:11:49] to trust Accord to according to God's
[1:11:52] choosing God chose this God allowed this
[1:11:56] and the church said am think about that
[1:11:58] area maybe areas of your life that are
[1:12:01] difficult did God allow it well yeah
[1:12:03] that's right that's right so then we
[1:12:06] have to accept that and God called you
[1:12:09] he elected you to stand
[1:12:11] amen he elected you to stand in your
[1:12:14] difficult situation in your life to
[1:12:16] stand for the truth of God
[1:12:19] hallelujah thank you
[1:12:21] Jesus so we see this Paul says before
[1:12:24] Jacob or Esau did any good or evil God
[1:12:26] already had chosen
[1:12:28] Jacob because he knew Jacob would have a
[1:12:31] desire for the word of God that's right
[1:12:35] Church uh verse uh 1912 now look it even
[1:12:38] was prophesied H I love
[1:12:40] that even as a baby they prophesied the
[1:12:43] Elder Shall Serve the younger wasn't
[1:12:45] Jacob grabbing at his heel when he come
[1:12:47] out of the womb isn't that something
[1:12:49] I've seen eight babies born but I never
[1:12:51] seen that a hand come out first and say
[1:12:53] give me that give me that I want the
[1:12:55] birth right my look at that it was even
[1:12:57] in him in the womb see Church there was
[1:13:00] something in you from a child it was the
[1:13:03] calling of God it was the election of
[1:13:05] God you wanted a spiritual relationship
[1:13:07] with God so God gave it to you
[1:13:09] hallelujah amen
[1:13:13] amen and she even got a prophecy the
[1:13:16] Elder Shall Serve the
[1:13:19] younger
[1:13:21] Hallelujah I love this story what a
[1:13:23] beautiful
[1:13:26] story now verse 13 here's kind kind of
[1:13:29] where I want to get to by God's
[1:13:34] grace verse 13 I'll probably stop here
[1:13:36] in just a few minutes so give me just a
[1:13:38] I'm G try to bring it down to a close
[1:13:41] Hallelujah Romans 9:13 as it is written
[1:13:45] Jacob have I loved but Esa have I hated
[1:13:50] now church I I feel like I've got a new
[1:13:52] understanding on this I actually used to
[1:13:54] think like God was actually uh hateful
[1:13:57] towards Esau but as I read the scripture
[1:13:59] I find out God was merciful to
[1:14:02] Esau God was longsuffering with
[1:14:06] Esau and then when I look at these other
[1:14:08] scriptures I understand this and I found
[1:14:10] this from uh a commentator I think this
[1:14:12] is Albert Barnes or John Gil both
[1:14:14] preachers in the 1800s wonderful men of
[1:14:17] God but he he he comments on this
[1:14:21] verse and he says this
[1:14:24] this does not mean a positive hatred but
[1:14:27] that God had preferred Jacob and had
[1:14:30] withheld from Esau the Privileges and
[1:14:32] blessings which he con conferred on the
[1:14:35] posterity or posterity of
[1:14:38] Jacob right so and and now here here's
[1:14:41] some scripture to back it up it wasn't
[1:14:44] like God is smiling at Jacob I love you
[1:14:46] and then I hate you Esau that's actually
[1:14:48] that's contrary to
[1:14:50] scripture right and I'm going to show
[1:14:51] you some more scriptures
[1:14:54] now here's what the commentator said and
[1:14:56] this is true it was common among the
[1:14:58] Hebrews to use the terms love and hatred
[1:15:00] in their comparative sense where the
[1:15:02] former implied strong positive
[1:15:05] attachment and the latter not positive
[1:15:08] hatred but merely a less
[1:15:11] love okay so the Jews would say love and
[1:15:14] hatred love is is all your love but
[1:15:16] hatred doesn't mean you hate them it
[1:15:18] just means less love and let me give you
[1:15:20] some examples so you'll know right this
[1:15:23] is undeniable because it's the
[1:15:25] scripture and of course what does this
[1:15:27] do church this magnifies God's grace
[1:15:30] this magnifies God's love and patience
[1:15:32] and
[1:15:34] longsuffering Hallelujah you want a good
[1:15:36] example how about this one Luke 14:26
[1:15:38] you want to pull it up there Lydia good
[1:15:40] job on a computer back
[1:15:43] there all right
[1:15:46] now Lydia last say she reads this right
[1:15:49] see this blew my mind too as I was
[1:15:51] studying I'm like oh that's right I
[1:15:52] forgot about that verse
[1:15:54] when you get saved Jesus is not saying
[1:15:56] you know Zur you got to hate your mom
[1:15:58] that's not what he's
[1:16:00] saying God wasn't telling me Jesse you
[1:16:02] got to hate your mom and dad that's not
[1:16:03] what God was telling me the church
[1:16:06] said so see so see it's it's a common
[1:16:10] Jewish custom just to use just to use
[1:16:12] love and hate where hate doesn't mean
[1:16:14] like you're you're angry with them it
[1:16:16] just means not loved as much
[1:16:20] right
[1:16:22] right so if any man come unto me and
[1:16:24] hate not his father mother and wife and
[1:16:26] children Brethren and sisters yay and
[1:16:28] his own life also he cannot be my
[1:16:30] disciple so malind L please don't hate
[1:16:32] me and your mother okay I want you to
[1:16:34] serve Jesus but don't hate us okay you
[1:16:37] understand what I'm saying see see
[1:16:38] Church like you
[1:16:39] see um you know another word for this
[1:16:43] might be hyperbole as well some
[1:16:45] sometimes that word is a good word
[1:16:47] too yeah it's just trying to show yeah
[1:16:50] very good brother this extreme contrast
[1:16:52] like Jesus said if you can't stop
[1:16:53] lessening he said pluck out your eyes
[1:16:55] well he's not really saying like you
[1:16:56] should do that or cut off your hand if
[1:16:58] you can't stop stealing I mean he's
[1:16:59] going to this he's going to Great
[1:17:01] Lengths to say you've got to be a
[1:17:02] changed person amen you got to get a new
[1:17:05] heart Hallelujah you don't got to get
[1:17:07] rid of your body you got to get rid of
[1:17:08] your sinful desires you got to crucify
[1:17:11] the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes
[1:17:12] pride of life You Must Die daily
[1:17:15] Hallelujah Church the more time you
[1:17:17] spend in prayer the more Victory you'll
[1:17:20] get it's just like building good habits
[1:17:22] you get a good you get a couple good
[1:17:23] days in a row you're going to be flying
[1:17:24] high in the spirit Hallelujah is that
[1:17:27] right church just get a couple good days
[1:17:29] you'll see you'll be walking we're we're
[1:17:31] walking the presence of God hallelujah
[1:17:33] God's moving God's blessing God's
[1:17:35] speaking God's ministering as we uh
[1:17:38] learn to to daily walk after the the the
[1:17:41] cross Hallelujah take up our cross so
[1:17:44] there's a good example there's numerous
[1:17:45] other examples Jesus said you'll love
[1:17:47] one master you'll hate the
[1:17:49] other right well I don't hate the school
[1:17:52] system I work work for that's my master
[1:17:54] right makes me work I'm a school teacher
[1:17:56] you know I mean I love I love Jesus but
[1:17:58] I don't hate my my job no I wish I could
[1:18:01] take more time off of my
[1:18:04] work but you see he's not telling me you
[1:18:07] should hate your job well then how am I
[1:18:08] going to show the love of Christ if I
[1:18:10] don't love my job you see you see now of
[1:18:14] course in this case he talking about
[1:18:14] Mammon right he's talking about money
[1:18:16] which is
[1:18:17] Mammon right but we don't have to just
[1:18:19] hate our money how many of you hate
[1:18:20] looking into your bank account online do
[1:18:22] you hate that
[1:18:23] well I guess you might hate it a little
[1:18:24] bit you you spend too
[1:18:27] much but you look at the look look look
[1:18:29] at the contrast here
[1:18:33] right so we can see it plainly uh
[1:18:36] Proverbs 13:24 he that spareth his Rod
[1:18:39] hateth his son but he that loveth him
[1:18:41] chasteneth him be times right the psalm
[1:18:45] is not saying you hate your children if
[1:18:46] you don't spank them like with real
[1:18:49] hatred it just means you don't love them
[1:18:51] like you should
[1:18:54] right because there's a lot of movement
[1:18:55] in the last you know 30 40 years not to
[1:18:56] use a rod not to use correction well
[1:18:59] those parents are going to pay for
[1:19:00] it they're GNA pay for it that's right
[1:19:04] and I'll just be honest I mean I didn't
[1:19:06] spank these guys too many times and look
[1:19:08] how they turned out pretty good by God's
[1:19:10] grace now we're like Lord willing now we
[1:19:13] can't can't predict the future we don't
[1:19:15] want to speak negative either but you
[1:19:16] know it just takes the love of God God's
[1:19:20] love there'll be times where God lead
[1:19:22] need you to chase them but somebody that
[1:19:25] doesn't that doesn't mean they just hate
[1:19:27] their child just means they don't love
[1:19:28] them the way they
[1:19:30] should so Jacob have I loved Esau have I
[1:19:33] hated it doesn't mean God hated Esau now
[1:19:35] God hates all
[1:19:37] sin right God hates all
[1:19:40] sin see so God wasn't you know so God
[1:19:44] just wasn't looking at Esau I hate you I
[1:19:46] hate you I hate you and I love you Jacob
[1:19:48] that's the way I thought before I'm just
[1:19:49] being honest I'm I'm growing and because
[1:19:51] of these scriptures because of Luke
[1:19:53] 14:26 Jesus is not telling me to hate my
[1:19:57] parents he's telling me I got to love
[1:19:59] Christ more than my
[1:20:01] parents
[1:20:03] right
[1:20:06] Hallelujah Jacob have I loved Esau have
[1:20:09] I hated Church you know what the heart
[1:20:11] of God is the heart of God is what we
[1:20:13] saw earlier I wish I could be cursed so
[1:20:16] other people could be saved how do we
[1:20:18] know that's the heart of God because
[1:20:19] that's what God did to
[1:20:21] Christ 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul says it who
[1:20:24] will have all men to be saved and come
[1:20:28] unto the knowledge of the truth so God
[1:20:29] desires everyone to be saved God wished
[1:20:33] Esau would have got saved now we know he
[1:20:35] was lost the Bible says he's
[1:20:37] lost right the Bible warns us in Hebrews
[1:20:39] 12 and other places he was
[1:20:41] lost he did despite he did the opposite
[1:20:44] of the spirit of Grace he trampled
[1:20:46] underfoot the grace of God during his
[1:20:49] lifetime he made a public show of it
[1:20:52] openly and and he uh smashed it with f
[1:20:54] figuratively with his feet he trampled
[1:20:56] on the grace of God I love this one I
[1:20:58] forgot about this one but I heard a
[1:20:59] preacher say this Ezekiel 33:10 I'm gon
[1:21:02] to skip actually I'm skip Ezekiel 33:11
[1:21:05] say unto them as I live sayeth the Lord
[1:21:07] how many believe he's alive tonight I
[1:21:09] have no pleasure in the death of the
[1:21:12] wicked God does not Delight in Sinners
[1:21:15] ding but that the wicked turn from his
[1:21:18] way and live turn ye turn ye from your
[1:21:20] evil ways for why will you die oh House
[1:21:22] of Israel
[1:21:23] remember I brought this up Sunday look
[1:21:24] up look up here here's the vessel of
[1:21:26] Honor glass here's the vessel Of
[1:21:28] Dishonor we're just going to drink this
[1:21:29] and throw it away right but God wishes
[1:21:31] this one would be right he doesn't enjoy
[1:21:34] when this gets tossed away he wished it
[1:21:37] was like this that's his that's his
[1:21:40] fatherly heart that's his loving
[1:21:42] Creator's heart his heart aches just
[1:21:45] like Moses's heart achd just like uh
[1:21:49] Paul's heart ACH how about Stephen Lord
[1:21:51] lay it not to their charge while they're
[1:21:53] throwing the stones at him how about
[1:21:55] Jesus father forgive them they don't
[1:21:57] know what they're doing
[1:21:59] right by God's grace we need to extend
[1:22:02] that same love and compassion to our
[1:22:04] enemies
[1:22:07] too God's saying turn turn turn from
[1:22:11] your evil ways right to all the evil
[1:22:13] people today right turn from your ways
[1:22:16] uh Barack Obama right right Joe

[1:22:30] and God's saying Turn Turn I don't
[1:22:33] Delight when they die without
[1:22:35] repenting that's why the Bible said pray
[1:22:37] for all the leaders that are in
[1:22:38] leadership over
[1:22:40] you
[1:22:41] Hallelujah now Church what's amazing
[1:22:44] here God the Bible said I have no
[1:22:47] pleasure in the death of Sinners but God
[1:22:50] did have pleasure in the death of Christ
[1:22:53] now you talk about a Divine
[1:22:56] love Isaiah 53:10 yet it pleased the
[1:22:59] Lord to bruise him you talk we're
[1:23:03] talking about a different kind of love
[1:23:05] here God God hates to see Pharaoh get a
[1:23:08] hard heart right and God had to harden
[1:23:09] his heart because that that that's what
[1:23:11] Pharaoh wanted God knew he would never
[1:23:13] return but it grieve God to do that but
[1:23:17] then it pleased God to put all your sins
[1:23:19] on his son amen praise God that's Divine
[1:23:23] love church that's amazing love that's
[1:23:26] eternal life that's eternal love
[1:23:28] Hallelujah
[1:23:29] am I have no pleasure when the wicked
[1:23:32] die but I do take
[1:23:34] pleasure in putting all the sin on my
[1:23:37] sacrifice for the joy that's set before
[1:23:40] Christ hallelujah amen
[1:23:44] hallelujah he hath put him to grief when
[1:23:47] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[1:23:49] sin he shall see his seed he shall
[1:23:50] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[1:23:53] Lord shall prosper in his hand what the
[1:23:55] children of God Amen that's the pleasure
[1:23:58] of God so it pleased God to bruise
[1:24:01] Christ so he he would have the pleasure
[1:24:03] of having his family all those thoughts
[1:24:05] in his mind Hallelujah he just wanted to
[1:24:07] see you manifested and giving God praise
[1:24:10] and singing there's joy in the house of
[1:24:12] the
[1:24:13] Lord amen God just wanted to give you
[1:24:16] want to see you worship and get some
[1:24:17] gratitude tonight and sing about the
[1:24:20] blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and
[1:24:22] thank God that nothing can separate us
[1:24:24] from the love of God
[1:24:26] hallelujah that pleasure so pleas him to
[1:24:29] put your sins on Christ so he'd have the
[1:24:31] pleasure of enjoying your worship and
[1:24:33] your
[1:24:34] fellowship that's
[1:24:36] love but he takes no pleasure when
[1:24:38] Sinners die takes no pleasure in
[1:24:42] that quite a quite quite a scripture is
[1:24:45] that quite a
[1:24:46] scripture Hallelujah let me close with a
[1:24:49] few more thoughts here yeah I'm already
[1:24:50] almost done here
[1:24:55] few more things here let me read this
[1:24:59] Esau we all know church he had the
[1:25:01] birthright he was a hunter
[1:25:03] right now what I found this was pretty
[1:25:06] amazing what I found
[1:25:08] here let me see if I can get to that
[1:25:10] right
[1:25:21] spot you have to forgive me here I was
[1:25:23] looking
[1:25:25] for a comment here I might just have to
[1:25:28] go by my memory here I got my notes
[1:25:30] thought I had my notes down here oh yeah
[1:25:31] here it
[1:25:33] is I want to read you some history about
[1:25:35] Esau some Jewish history I just had to
[1:25:37] go a little bit lower
[1:25:39] here Esau had the birthright and by this
[1:25:42] Birthright he had this Superior rank in
[1:25:45] his family he was number one in this
[1:25:47] family he got a double portion of his
[1:25:50] father's
[1:25:51] inheritance he got the Priestly Office
[1:25:53] of the family according to numbers 8:17
[1:25:55] and 19 he was the priest of the family
[1:25:58] so the religious leader and he had the
[1:26:01] promise of the seed to come through him
[1:26:06] Christ in which all the nations of the
[1:26:08] earth were to be blessed Genesis
[1:26:10] 22:18 and he sold all that out for one
[1:26:15] bowl of
[1:26:17] pottage now here's the history I didn't
[1:26:19] know but it agrees with Hebrews
[1:26:23] 12 see if I can find this
[1:26:26] here yeah Jewish tradition says this and
[1:26:28] this this author John Gil he cites he
[1:26:31] has the the books of the Jewish
[1:26:32] historians he said on the day Esau sold
[1:26:36] out the birthright he committed five
[1:26:38] transgressions that
[1:26:40] day so no wonder he would sell out the
[1:26:43] birthright history says the Jewish
[1:26:45] history says he laid with a virgin betro
[1:26:49] so he took another man's wife and the
[1:26:51] reason that's proven is Hebrews 12 it
[1:26:53] said he was a fornicator and a profane
[1:26:56] person but that's not recorded in
[1:26:58] scripture what's recorded in scripture
[1:27:00] is that after Jacob gets the be blessing
[1:27:02] he runs out and marries two Canaanites
[1:27:04] just to spite his parents and then he
[1:27:07] comes back and marri's an ishmaelite so
[1:27:09] he's got at least three wives so he does
[1:27:11] it on purpose I'm trying to I'm trying
[1:27:15] to spite my parents right see on
[1:27:20] purpose but I didn't know about this's
[1:27:21] other stuff no wonder he so easily sold
[1:27:24] out the birthright he had all those
[1:27:26] demon spirits on him right fornication a
[1:27:29] perverse Spirit right Spirit of
[1:27:32] fornication we' say a hor mongering
[1:27:34] Spirit right so he's Anointed with a hor
[1:27:36] mongering Spirit he took another man's
[1:27:38] wife a
[1:27:39] virgin he killed a person right and that
[1:27:42] that makes sense historically because as
[1:27:44] soon as he found out about Jacob he
[1:27:45] wanted to kill Jacob Jacob wasn't the
[1:27:47] first one he wanted to
[1:27:49] kill he's a murderer right in a
[1:27:52] murderous
[1:27:54] heart third thing now this is I don't
[1:27:57] know this one
[1:28:02] um where is it okay uh fifth one I lost
[1:28:06] my spot oh yeah okay yeah it says he
[1:28:09] denied the resurrection of the dead I'm
[1:28:10] not sure what that stands for and then
[1:28:12] he denied the root the foundation and
[1:28:15] then he despise his
[1:28:17] Birthright and he even desired now this
[1:28:20] says he desired his father's death
[1:28:21] because remember his father couldn't
[1:28:22] take back the blessings once he blessed
[1:28:24] him he couldn't take him back and then
[1:28:26] he sought to slay his brother that same
[1:28:29] day so all those evil spirits were on
[1:28:32] him no wonder he said I don't want to go
[1:28:33] to church and worship right I don't want
[1:28:36] to intercede I don't care if the Messiah
[1:28:38] comes for me he just laid with the woman
[1:28:40] he just wants to kill people he's got
[1:28:42] all these all these evil spirits on no
[1:28:44] wonder he doesn't want any connection to
[1:28:45] it but Jacob's the exact opposite
[1:28:48] Jacob's like I don't have it I want the
[1:28:51] Messiah to come through me I want Jesus
[1:28:54] to come through me hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:56] praise God I want God's blessings in my
[1:28:58] life
[1:28:59] Hallelujah I want the lineage of the
[1:29:01] Messiah to come through me praise
[1:29:03] God I want to be a spiritual leader how
[1:29:05] many want to be spiritual leaders in
[1:29:07] your family you all of you are right if
[1:29:09] you have a house husband or wife you're
[1:29:12] a team of course the man's the ruler but
[1:29:14] the Bible said the woman guides the
[1:29:15] house while the man's out working right
[1:29:18] Titus Chapter
[1:29:19] 2 see she's a leader one way leads the
[1:29:24] children but see I didn't know that now
[1:29:26] go to Hebrews
[1:29:32] 12:16 before they were born God knew he
[1:29:35] would desire these things so that's why
[1:29:37] he elected
[1:29:41] Jacob actually let's go to verse it's
[1:29:43] beautiful verse verse 15 Hebrews 12:15
[1:29:46] looking diligently lest any man fail the
[1:29:47] grace of God so see Church you got to
[1:29:49] look really diligently at the word of
[1:29:51] God

[1:30:20] light afflictions Hallelujah light
[1:30:22] afflictions but look see if you want the
[1:30:25] grace of God you got to look diligently

[1:30:28] God in other words don't let Satan tell
[1:30:30] you you're a vessel Of Dishonor you're
[1:30:32] not you're a vessel of Honor Hallelujah
[1:30:35] that's why you're here tonight you're
[1:30:36] looking diligently at the grace of God
[1:30:39] hallelujah how many want more go of
[1:30:41] God's grace in your life am that's why
[1:30:42] you're here you're looking into it you
[1:30:44] don't want God's judgment you don't want
[1:30:46] God's Wrath you want God's mercy

[1:31:00] Mercy sisters there plenty for all of us
[1:31:02] hallelujah is that right AAA plenty of
[1:31:05] Mercy plenty of Grace Hallelujah and he
[1:31:08] pours it out upon us
[1:31:10] hallelujah nobody can put any charge to
[1:31:13] God's
[1:31:14] elect we'll judge the Devils we'll judge
[1:31:17] the Angels Hallelujah we'll condemn the
[1:31:19] world the Bible said with our lives
[1:31:24] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:31:26] trouble you and thereby may may be many
[1:31:29] be defiled see we can't get bitter with
[1:31:31] people we got to be loving with people
[1:31:33] what happened to Esau he got bitter with
[1:31:35] his brother I'm GNA kill that man and so
[1:31:37] Rebecca says go run away go run away I
[1:31:40] love how God does it God brings them
[1:31:42] peace at the end of their lives right
[1:31:44] before their daddy died right and then
[1:31:46] their last meeting is at the very grave
[1:31:48] of their father love you brother love
[1:31:51] you the same guy that wanted to kill him
[1:31:52] now he's hugging on his neck and crying
[1:31:54] let me bless your children can I bless
[1:31:56] your wives can I bless your children is
[1:31:57] our last
[1:31:59] meeting God is the master of changing
[1:32:02] Hearts Hallelujah God can take a
[1:32:04] murderer and God can take that murderers
[1:32:06] out out of him and make his love make
[1:32:08] him love his enemy Church man Hallelujah
[1:32:11] he can make a murderer love his enemy
[1:32:13] Hallelujah that's the grace of God to us
[1:32:16] but what caused at the beginning
[1:32:19] bitterness well you're the one who sold
[1:32:21] it out you're the one that that took the
[1:32:22] betrothed woman you're the one that
[1:32:24] murdered there's consequences to your
[1:32:29] actions verse 16 lest there be any
[1:32:32] fornicators so that's where the Jewish
[1:32:34] historians get this he he took another
[1:32:37] man's betro wife for that's fornication
[1:32:40] right any act before marriage is
[1:32:42] fornication any act after that's not
[1:32:44] with the spouse is
[1:32:47] adultery or profane person as Esau who
[1:32:51] for one more more so of meat sold his
[1:32:52] Birthright for you know how that
[1:32:54] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:32:56] the blessing he was rejected for he
[1:32:58] found no place of repentance though he
[1:33:00] sought it carefully with tears and so we
[1:33:02] know what does that mean it means he had
[1:33:05] worldly sorrow and not godly sorrow he
[1:33:08] just felt bad Paul said Paul said
[1:33:10] there's two sorrows and I've seen it I
[1:33:13] prayed with one man here an hour and a
[1:33:15] half and then another time I prayed an
[1:33:16] hour and a half with there he cried for
[1:33:18] three hours straight saying he wanted to
[1:33:20] serve God I walked out I went the next
[1:33:22] day I saw him he was at Bible study the
[1:33:23] day after that he was out smoking weed
[1:33:25] again and sleeping with all kinds of
[1:33:27] girls now he's got almost uh six
[1:33:29] children by five different women and I
[1:33:32] thought for sure praying three hours
[1:33:34] with somebody All Those Tears I thought
[1:33:36] for sure something to happen but when
[1:33:39] there's no change of life it's called
[1:33:41] worldly sorrow they're just sorry they
[1:33:43] got caught they don't want to change but
[1:33:46] thank God we're changed thank God Amen
[1:33:50] that he can write the word of God on the
[1:33:52] fleshly tables of our heart
[1:33:56] Hallelujah and so Esau's crying but just
[1:33:58] because he lost the
[1:34:00] money right now God did still bless him
[1:34:02] later but he didn't get as much as
[1:34:05] Jacob see he cried for all the wrong
[1:34:10] reasons that's right
[1:34:13] Church though he sought it carefully
[1:34:15] with
[1:34:16] tears let's stand to our feet
[1:34:20] here musicians can
[1:34:24] come lot different than Sunday
[1:34:28] huh but how many know it's needful too
[1:34:31] how many believe Romans 9 is thus sayith
[1:34:32] the Lord too everybody believe that you
[1:34:36] you believe chapter nine just as
[1:34:37] inspirers chapter
[1:34:38] 8 Hallelujah it is church what does this
[1:34:42] encourage us to do be the Jacob amen be
[1:34:45] the child of the promise of God
[1:34:49] am don't let roots of bitterness to
[1:34:51] spring up in our
[1:34:53] hearts because that defiles many people
[1:34:56] that's why I told you even these there's
[1:34:58] a certain group of preachers in the
[1:34:59] message they call themselves The
[1:35:00] Greatest preachers of all time but I've
[1:35:02] got to be careful I've emailed them I
[1:35:04] tried to contact them I got to be

[1:35:25] don't uproot that it's going to defile
[1:35:28] lots of
[1:35:29] people create in me a clean heart oh
[1:35:33] God and renew a right Spirit within
[1:35:38] me and I love the story of Jacob no
[1:35:40] matter how bad he was at the beginning
[1:35:42] God knew he'd want to wrestle and get a
[1:35:44] changed
[1:35:46] life God knew there would come a
[1:35:48] showdown where I've got to be a
[1:35:50] different person I can't live like this
[1:35:52] anymore I need the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[1:35:56] I need the Holy Ghost I need a
[1:35:58] change God knew that moment would
[1:36:01] come and God let Jacob Prevail over the
[1:36:04] angel to show him that God's word
[1:36:07] prevails that God can change a man God
[1:36:10] is the only one who can Prevail over the
[1:36:12] will of
[1:36:13] man because his will is greater that's
[1:36:16] the reason I got saved his will is
[1:36:18] stronger amen that's why I got saved
[1:36:21] how we thankful his Will's stronger
