[0:00] you all again and did I hear you right
[0:02] one service yes one service so if it
[0:04] goes lengthy yall won't mind right well
[0:06] well equal to
[0:08] no we'll do whatever the Lord leads
[0:10] how's that so good to see you sister and
[0:14] uh it's good to be here once again and
[0:16] before I forget brother Jim wanted me to
[0:18] uh extend greetings to everybody here he
[0:20] says hello and uh and everybody behind
[0:24] him also says
[0:26] hello so it's uh good to see everybody
[0:29] smiling happy happy in the Lord and uh
[0:32] on a wintry day you know they keep
[0:33] throwing or threatening uh inclement
[0:36] weather bad weather but you still came
[0:38] out so that that just shows that you
[0:41] have a desire and a love for the Lord
[0:44] amen so know just appreciate uh you all
[0:47] making the effort to come and uh it's
[0:50] really good to see you all again and
[0:51] this is a really fast turnaround uh not
[0:55] not used to it so much I think a few
[0:57] years ago you know i' ministered a few
[1:00] times for youall it was like every every
[1:01] other month or something like that for a
[1:03] little bit but uh yeah so Lord be with
[1:08] you all if you would please turn with me
[1:09] to chapter or Ephesians chapter
[1:13] 3 and I had just preached this at the at
[1:16] the home church just a little bit ago so
[1:19] hopefully it's just as fresh and uh
[1:21] hopefully it's a a blessing to you as
[1:23] well uh I think it's in Daniel it's a in
[1:27] a couple places in the scripture where
[1:30] uh men have tried to do things and try
[1:32] to do it for the Lord but there's just
[1:34] something that always stands in the way
[1:37] and uh so we we we tried and I always
[1:41] feel bad because I I feel like I didn't
[1:43] do my due diligence to get myself set
[1:46] aside and never assume that you have a
[1:48] whole Saturday to do something to study
[1:51] because uh what I do is I work on
[1:53] generators and I got a couple calls
[1:56] yesterday and I had to get out into the
[1:58] field and repair a couple customers
[2:01] generators so that took me away from
[2:02] that a little bit and that's a lesson to
[2:04] me to don't don't depend on a whole
[2:07] Saturday
[2:08] so uh without further Ado you've been
[2:11] standing for a little bit uh Ephesians
[2:13] chapter 3 starting at verse
[2:16] 7 and it's always difficult to uh I know
[2:20] I'm rambling I'm nervous so uh it's
[2:22] always difficult to start somewhere in
[2:24] the scripture when there's a semicolon
[2:26] or a colon you know I hate to break it
[2:28] up so we're we're this is a little bit
[2:31] lengthy but not not too long don't don't
[2:33] worry but I just can't stop it once but
[2:35] so it's nice to get the whole thought of
[2:37] what it's of what it's saying getting
[2:39] the whole context of
[2:40] it so he says whereof I was made a
[2:44] minister according to the gift of the
[2:45] grace of God given unto me by the
[2:48] effectual working of his power so we see
[2:51] the gifts are given by him correct so
[2:54] verse 8 it says unto me who am less than
[2:56] the least of All Saints is the grace
[2:58] given that I should preach among the
[3:00] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[3:02] Christ right and to make all men see
[3:05] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[3:07] which from the beginning of the world
[3:09] hath been hid in God who created All
[3:11] Things by Jesus Christ see this is this
[3:14] is a time where our eyes are open that
[3:17] we are blessed to be able to see things
[3:19] that uh men and women of old time were
[3:22] not able to see it but what privilege we
[3:25] have in this day that we're able to see
[3:27] these things that our eyes are open amen
[3:29] hallelujah so verse 10 it says to the
[3:31] intent that now unto the unto the
[3:35] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[3:37] places might be known by the church the
[3:40] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[3:42] Eternal purpose which he purposed in
[3:44] Christ Jesus our lord Amen in whom we
[3:48] have boldness and access this is what we
[3:51] have in Christ that we have a boldness
[3:54] and we have the access see we are still
[3:57] privileged he's still going on to say
[3:59] what a privileg people you are
[4:01] Hallelujah with
[4:03] confidence not shaking well I almost
[4:06] feel feel like I'm I missed the mark of
[4:09] I feel led to go a different different
[4:11] direction
[4:13] now but you you and and and we could
[4:16] just oh Lord help me because I don't
[4:18] know what direction to go now but we'll
[4:21] just continue on but we'll see how it
[4:22] goes so verse 12 in whom we have
[4:24] boldness and access with confidence by
[4:27] faith of him 13 wherefore I desire that
[4:30] you faint not at my tribulations for you
[4:32] which is your glory for this cause I bow
[4:35] my knees unto the father of our Lord
[4:37] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[4:39] Heaven and Earth is named that he would
[4:42] Grant you according to the riches of his
[4:44] glory to be strengthened with might by
[4:46] his spirit in the Inner Man so this is
[4:50] kind of where I want to get to is the
[4:51] next few verses that Christ May dwell in
[4:54] your hearts by faith that ye being
[4:57] rooted and grounded in love
[5:01] may be able to comprehend or understand
[5:04] with All Saints what is the breadth and
[5:06] the length and the depth and the height
[5:09] and to know the love of Christ which
[5:11] passeth knowledge it's not even a
[5:13] knowledge game it passes knowledge you
[5:15] ever try to describe God and you just
[5:18] can't find the words because we just
[5:20] have these the the words of man and it's
[5:22] he's so beyond what a man can even
[5:25] explain right
[5:27] so uh may be able to comprehend with All
[5:30] Saints what is the breadth and the
[5:31] length and the depth and the height and
[5:32] to know the love of Christ which passeth
[5:34] knowledge that ye might be filled with
[5:37] all the fullness of God now unto him
[5:39] that is able to do exceedingly exceeding
[5:42] abundantly above all that we ask or
[5:44] think according to the power that
[5:46] worketh in US unto him be glory in the
[5:48] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[5:51] ages World Without End so he is able to
[5:55] do exceeding abundantly above that above
[5:58] all that we ask or think which he knows
[6:00] what we're going to ask before we ask it
[6:02] he knows what we need before we even
[6:04] bring it before him and he's already
[6:06] ready to bless it before we even speak
[6:09] it amen but it's just that whole thing
[6:11] is that we have to take that step
[6:13] because as we read in there it's as a
[6:15] faith right it's it's something that we
[6:18] that we are laying hold that we are
[6:20] claiming already see faith is the
[6:23] substance of things hoped for you hoped
[6:25] for it in the past but now you're going
[6:27] to say I have it going to say it's
[6:30] something that I have it's something
[6:31] that I possess now amen so when you're
[6:34] praying for sickness when you're praying
[6:36] for deliverance you give God thanks as
[6:38] if it's a done a a work already done
[6:42] that's having faith saying I have it I'm
[6:45] going to receive it not just laying it
[6:47] out there well Lord I hope that you're
[6:49] going to move on this I hope you're able
[6:51] to do that we already know that he is
[6:53] more than able to do these things
[6:55] exceeding and abundantly more amen so
[6:59] Colossians
[7:00] 2 and verse 6 if you would turn with me
[7:11] there in verse six it says as ye have
[7:14] therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord
[7:17] everybody receive Christ Jesus the Lord
[7:19] this morning amen it is a true gift so
[7:23] if you've received him it says so walk
[7:25] ye in him so walk in his ways walk in in
[7:29] the way that he's established walk in
[7:31] the way that is pleasing unto him not
[7:34] according to our way but according to
[7:36] the way that that he is amen so verse
[7:39] 7even it says rooted and built up in him
[7:43] established in the faith not just some
[7:46] kind of uh I'm hanging in there for the
[7:48] moment but being rooted and grounded
[7:51] unshakable unmovable yes coming with a
[7:55] faith coming with a confidence to know
[7:58] that you were his child
[8:00] am so rooted and built up in him and
[8:03] established in the faith as ye have been
[8:05] taught abounding therein with
[8:07] Thanksgiving abounding so there's there
[8:10] there there's a way to abound in Christ
[8:12] through all of his benefits amen so
[8:15] verse eight it says beware lest any man
[8:17] spoil you through philosophy and vain
[8:21] deceit after the tradition of men after
[8:23] the rudiments of the world and not after
[8:26] Christ and we see that there are so many
[8:28] philosophies way back in jesus' time the
[8:30] Greeks were known for their
[8:32] philosophical views and they would have
[8:34] their disputes they would have their
[8:36] debates of who uh look at Socrates and
[8:38] and and I can't remember him right now
[8:40] but there were so many philosophers in
[8:43] the day and this is the warning that was
[8:45] established beware of those that have
[8:47] philosop uh the philosophical ideas that
[8:50] try to draw you away from Christ it
[8:53] might have a it might sound good for a
[8:55] moment but it's pulling you away from
[8:56] the grace of God that's right it might
[8:58] sound good good it might be so close
[9:01] that it might deceive the very elect if
[9:04] possible so things can sound so good but
[9:07] yet it's trying to pull you away that's
[9:10] where we have to have our discernment
[9:12] exercised amen being able to distinguish
[9:15] to to to be to discern between good and
[9:18] evil amen so real quick to give a
[9:21] definition in the two scriptures I I
[9:23] read about being rooted and grounded so
[9:25] what is to what does it mean to root
[9:27] everybody kind of has an understanding
[9:29] of what root means correct so what a to
[9:32] root it means to to uh this is
[9:35] figuratively to become stable to cause
[9:38] to strike a root to strengthen with
[9:41] roots to render firm to fix to establish
[9:45] to cause a person or a thing to be
[9:47] thoroughly
[9:49] grounded a tree a plant all those things
[9:52] have Roots even a Vine has roots even
[9:56] and that's where the life is coming from
[9:58] as it draws and it it draws from the
[10:00] ground it draws from the soil it's
[10:02] getting the the water it's getting the
[10:04] nutrients as it as it goes down it has
[10:07] to get down into the ground it has to
[10:09] get down into the soil so when the wind
[10:11] blows it's not going to blow over it's
[10:13] strengthened by the root amen so if I
[10:17] could this
[10:18] morning uh if we could bow our heads
[10:20] this morning uh I'd like to speak on uh
[10:23] fruit of the
[10:26] root if I could have like a a side thing
[10:29] on that so cut the root you kill the
[10:32] fruit Heavenly Father we just thank you
[10:35] so much for what you've done for us we
[10:37] thank you for safe travels every one of
[10:39] us here and uh even if it's snowing or
[10:41] blowing and and and icy in different
[10:43] areas Lord uh each one has had the
[10:45] desire to make it here into the in the
[10:47] house of worship this morning to come
[10:49] and sing songs unto you to give you
[10:51] praise to give you worship and to hear
[10:53] your word father I pray that their
[10:55] effort would not go in vain but Lord I
[10:57] pray that you would bless each and every
[10:58] one that's made the effort to come here
[11:00] this morning and may they go stronger
[11:02] than they have in a long time may they
[11:05] go revived may they go uh uh just having
[11:08] a refreshing of your Holy Spirit Lord as
[11:10] we depart from here we ask the same that
[11:12] you would continue to be with us and
[11:14] keep us safe in our travels we ask it
[11:16] all that you would uh in the name of the
[11:18] Lord Jesus Christ that you would be here
[11:20] and as we're here in your presence we
[11:22] pray for your blessings be with the
[11:24] speaker and the hearer I just pray that
[11:25] you would keep my guard my lips keep me
[11:27] from speaking anything wrong in correct
[11:29] or or anything contrary to your word
[11:32] Lord we ask all these things again in
[11:34] your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ
[11:36] amen amen you may be
[11:39] seated so like I said I'd like to speak
[11:41] on
[11:44] Roots the fruit of the root and brother
[11:47] Jesse made a comment just before I came
[11:49] out about uh fruits and I brother you
[11:53] have no idea what you're just
[11:57] saying well I'm sure he has an idea he
[11:59] just didn't know what I uh what I what
[12:01] was prepared this
[12:03] morning
[12:05] so I'm just going to try to take my
[12:08] time so we we've we've all we all know
[12:12] the the story of the the the parable the
[12:14] sewer of the different seeds I'm just
[12:16] I'm just going to try to uh paraphrase
[12:18] uh through
[12:19] them uh if I go too fast uh raise your
[12:23] hand I I'll try to slow down so I just
[12:25] want to make sure you you're able to to
[12:28] understand it
[12:29] see uh y'all might not be hindered I I
[12:32] don't I was telling the brother here I
[12:34] have a hard time with accents sometimes
[12:36] and and it it it's not so much you all
[12:39] okay it's more me I just have a hard
[12:41] time under I have sometimes I have a
[12:43] hard time understanding my wife and it's
[12:45] not because of her it's just I just
[12:47] don't understand it very well so it's I
[12:50] if if you don't understand me if I'm
[12:51] going too fast just raise your hand so
[12:55] depending on what uh on what ground you
[12:58] are because the the parable of sers
[13:00] talks about the different types of
[13:02] ground of how the seed is able to be
[13:04] received correct so it depends on where
[13:08] you are in that in that Parable uh to
[13:11] see in your life uh where the where the
[13:14] spirit of the Lord is right so we
[13:17] understand the the seed to be the word
[13:19] of God right so uh so those that fell on
[13:23] the Wayside and this is in Matthew 13 I
[13:26] think is one of them and uh yeah in
[13:28] Matthew 13 and the other one I can't
[13:30] remember uh there was another one so
[13:32] those that fell on the
[13:34] wayside it means that that that seed or
[13:37] those people because we understand the
[13:39] seeds to be people right so uh excuse me
[13:42] the the roots and trees to be people uh
[13:45] so those that fell on the wayside it
[13:47] shows that they have no understanding
[13:49] and the wicked one comes and takes it
[13:51] away this is what the wicked one does
[13:53] right so and so there's there's nothing
[13:56] there that's going to be rooted and
[13:57] grounded so it's there there's no
[14:00] understanding there's no comprehension
[14:02] of of of what the word is they they hear
[14:04] the word but it didn't make sense to
[14:06] them and that can kind of you could
[14:08] attribute that right to
[14:10] predestination uh it doesn't mean that
[14:12] he's that we're puppets I I can't
[14:14] remember if I talked about this the last
[14:16] time but we're not puppets in the Lord's
[14:17] hands we're not marionettes you know we
[14:20] make our own decisions we we've been
[14:22] given that uh free moral agency that we
[14:24] can make our decisions and it's our
[14:27] decisions that determine what our
[14:29] destination is so uh we just thank the
[14:32] Lord that we were given the
[14:34] understanding that we could that we were
[14:36] able to see uh the meaning of his word
[14:39] so those that fell in the Stony places
[14:41] in Matthew 13- 20 uh it says but he that
[14:44] received the seed into Stony places the
[14:46] same as he that heareth the word hearing
[14:48] the word each one of these heard the
[14:50] word but there was something about uh uh
[14:54] each one so they they Hearth the word
[14:57] and a non with joy receive it
[14:59] yet he hath not root in himself but doth
[15:02] for a while for when tribulation or
[15:03] persecution ariseth because of the word
[15:06] by and by He Is offended see what is the
[15:09] Forgotten beatitude blessed is he that
[15:11] is not offended in me so when we hear
[15:13] the word if if uh a lot of people
[15:16] especially new converts or or or young
[15:19] people have that question uh as they're
[15:22] they're they're living their Christian
[15:23] Life how do I know if I really have the
[15:26] Holy Spirit or not that is a very common
[15:28] question question not just among the the
[15:30] youth but it's also even in in in adults
[15:33] how do I know that I have the spirit how
[15:36] do I know that I've I've been baptized
[15:38] or um not baptized but sealed with the
[15:41] Holy Spirit you know that that is a that
[15:44] is a question that people ask a lot so
[15:47] and that's one way to gauge if you have
[15:49] the spirit or not when you read the
[15:51] scripture are you offended in the
[15:53] scripture when you hear the preaching of
[15:54] the word are you offended over the word
[15:57] does the word of God bother you because
[16:00] if it bothers you that's going to be a
[16:01] pretty good answer right there that if
[16:03] you get angry at the word if you get
[16:05] upset at the word that you probably
[16:07] don't have that spirit and I urge you to
[16:10] to get into prayer and seek that spirit
[16:12] amen so uh and and
[16:16] so they dth uh yet he hath not rooted
[16:20] himself but doth for a while for when
[16:22] tribulation or persecu persecution
[16:24] arises so when when hard times come uh
[16:28] uh uh like says in the tribulations and
[16:30] the persecutions when somebody comes
[16:31] against us we're not rooted and grounded
[16:34] enough and we get upset about it and
[16:36] then we want to turn away because we're
[16:38] not fitting into the world view right so
[16:42] there's another one uh that talks about
[16:44] falling among the Thorns they hear the
[16:46] word again each each one of these you
[16:49] hear the word and the cares of the world
[16:51] and deceitfulness of riches choke the
[16:53] word to become
[16:56] unfruitful the things of the world the
[16:59] desire of the world uh uh seeking uh
[17:02] celebrities sports sports fanatics
[17:04] looking at at these Sports people I
[17:07] guess you can call them icons or or
[17:09] whatever Idols you know and and people
[17:12] idolize these people so much that the
[17:14] home Church knows that they pretty much
[17:16] know how I feel about celebrities is I
[17:18] really don't care about celebrities you
[17:21] know
[17:22] uh they're celebrities because they are
[17:25] popular with people okay you acted in a
[17:28] film then all of a you've made millions
[17:30] of dollars now people idolize you just
[17:32] because you were able to act in a film
[17:34] or a sports celebrity just because you
[17:37] can carry a ball across the line yeah
[17:38] that's great that you've got those that
[17:40] you've got those skills but you know
[17:42] what outside of that what kind of people
[17:44] are
[17:46] they so when these when these young ones
[17:48] or when these people want to idolize
[17:50] these celebrities or these icons or
[17:53] Idols they don't even realize what they
[17:56] are idolizing they see that oh they can
[17:58] run uh they can run a 100 yards and and
[18:01] 6 seconds flat not happening but you you
[18:04] understand what I mean so uh just
[18:06] because they run real fast they're
[18:07] carrying a pig skinn football so what or
[18:10] they could throw a baseball you know a
[18:12] lot
[18:13] of and people look under that just
[18:16] because they can accomplish something in
[18:17] a sports game or they can accomplish
[18:20] something in a film you know all this
[18:22] film stuff it's all Hollywood it's all
[18:24] fake anyhow it's not even real so these
[18:27] people get get Popular by doing
[18:30] something that's not even real it's
[18:32] acting it's
[18:35] pretend yes and people pay big money for
[18:39] it it's
[18:41] entertainment but if you if you meet
[18:43] some of these people you'll find that
[18:45] they're probably not real likable people
[18:47] that's right because when money
[18:51] hits they get stingy they get greedy
[18:54] they get uh uh uh uh prideful all these
[18:58] different sins that come into their life
[19:00] and these are the kind of people that
[19:02] they
[19:03] are and some of them have have been
[19:05] accused of of of of of
[19:08] assault and you want to pattern yourself
[19:11] these people want to pattern themselves
[19:12] after these
[19:14] people oh but they got bank they got
[19:16] money so what that money is going to go
[19:18] in the grave with them they're not going
[19:19] to take it with
[19:21] them so what are we interested in the
[19:25] fruit bearing fruit we are interested in
[19:29] character how we could treat one another
[19:32] amen I don't care what color skin you
[19:35] have I you don't care what color skin I
[19:38] have and I know I'm treading ground
[19:40] right so we don't care about color skin
[19:42] we don't care because if if I cut my
[19:45] finger you cut your finger you cut your
[19:47] finger what do we what do we bleed we
[19:49] all bleed red right I'm not better than
[19:52] you you're not better than me right
[19:54] we're all human
[19:57] beings and those people people put their
[19:59] pants on one leg at a time just like you
[20:02] do yes sir so what makes them so special
[20:07] it's other people that make it seem like
[20:09] they're more special brother I don't
[20:12] know how I got on celebrities but that's
[20:14] how I
[20:17] feel I'm more interested in one person
[20:20] one person gets my praise one person
[20:23] gets the greatest
[20:24] honor that's where my that's where mine
[20:27] lays that's where give my glory that's
[20:29] where I give my honor is to the Lord
[20:31] Jesus Christ prise God I'm not going to
[20:34] worship some some persons that's just as
[20:37] fallible as
[20:39] me they're going to misspeak sometimes
[20:41] they're going to say wrong things like I
[20:43] was talking about Jonah and I was
[20:45] talking about the juniper tree and it
[20:46] was a gourd I was talking about
[20:49] disciples and I said it was Peter that
[20:50] said we're going to call out fire from
[20:52] heaven and I spoke it here and I didn't
[20:54] say Peter we just make mistakes like
[20:57] that they make the same mist mistakes
[20:59] why do you think they have to do so many
[21:01] takes yes sir you ever watch a movie and
[21:04] you see the bloopers careful raising
[21:05] your
[21:08] hands but you seen the bloopers why
[21:12] because it was a blooper it was a
[21:13] mistake yes it's not a perfect take
[21:17] every time and I'm way off my notes is
[21:19] that okay yes sir so yes but it's the
[21:22] fruit of the person that we're
[21:23] interested in right and and I think
[21:26] brother brother Jesse might have said
[21:28] something about I can't remember but uh
[21:31] but what is the Golden Rule treat PE
[21:33] treat others respect others as you
[21:36] expect to be treated
[21:39] right not treating others because you
[21:41] were treated a certain way how do you
[21:44] expect to be treated then we treat
[21:47] others with the same Hallelujah right
[21:49] because we expect the same result it
[21:51] doesn't mean that we will get the same
[21:53] result and I think it worth talking
[21:55] about that because about somebody
[21:57] getting bullied or I I can't remember
[21:59] what it was so and still showing the
[22:03] love of Christ persecution tribulation
[22:06] should not be cont our our our
[22:09] relationship with the Lord should not be
[22:11] contingent on how people it doesn't
[22:13] depend on how other people treat us but
[22:15] we should still maintain that love of
[22:17] Christ to show it forth amen how else
[22:20] are they going to see it yes good unless
[22:23] we show it rightall and how else can we
[22:26] show it l we abide in him
[22:30] because if we're going to be like him we
[22:31] have to produce the same fruit
[22:35] right so that's the Thorns is hearing
[22:38] the word and the cares of the world and
[22:40] the deceitfulness of
[22:42] riches that's how we got on that the
[22:45] deceitfulness of riches don't think that
[22:48] rich people are always
[22:50] happy it doesn't always work that way
[22:54] well Money Can't money they people say
[22:56] well money can't buy happiness and and
[22:58] they're right but it sure
[23:02] helps sure having a lot of money sure it
[23:05] would help if you want a bigger house
[23:07] that you can't even you got more rooms
[23:09] than you got
[23:11] friends you know 15 15 rooms and 10
[23:14] bathrooms and you got two friends what's
[23:17] that going to so what you got a
[23:19] mansion but we've got a different
[23:21] mansion that we're concerned of amen
[23:24] that's the one that I want whose Builder
[23:26] and maker is God amen GL so let's talk
[23:30] about the good ground the good ground
[23:33] are those that hear the
[23:35] word again they heard the word right how
[23:38] else are we going to receive
[23:42] Deliverance how else are we going to
[23:43] have
[23:44] Liberty
[23:46] yes there's a whole lot that goes into
[23:49] that
[23:49] word it all depends on how you hold it
[23:53] it all depends on how you view it it all
[23:55] depends on how you apply it yes
[23:58] Hallelujah
[24:00] those those words written in this book
[24:02] are just going to remain words as as
[24:05] long as it lays dormant between those
[24:08] covers if you get into that word and you
[24:11] absorb the nutrients within the covers
[24:14] yes by the washing of the water the word
[24:17] rece absorbing the water right yes as
[24:20] long as we're in
[24:21] that oh I guess we get into some
[24:24] something else sticky just because you
[24:26] read it doesn't mean you're saved that's
[24:28] right just because you read it doesn't
[24:30] mean that you believe yes sir just
[24:33] because you read it doesn't mean that
[24:34] you're a Believer that's right the devil
[24:38] knows a word too yes sir I don't care
[24:42] how good you can quote the
[24:44] word that doesn't mean you're saved
[24:47] that's
[24:48] right and as long as it lays dormant
[24:52] inside you know back in school I learned
[24:55] stuff I was okay with math problems as
[24:59] long as the math problems were on the
[25:01] board you know what I couldn't I
[25:03] couldn't stand is I couldn't I I really
[25:06] didn't like was the word
[25:10] problems you know what the word problems
[25:13] had you do it had you face
[25:17] reality I knew how to work simple
[25:21] Algebra I could do that you give me the
[25:23] problems I could I could solve them I I
[25:26] I could solve them uh pretty quick
[25:28] it might always be right but but anyhow
[25:33] but once I got those story
[25:35] problems give me something to apply what
[25:38] I've learned I had a hard time figuring
[25:40] it
[25:41] out
[25:42] see same thing with the scripture we
[25:45] might have we might know what the word
[25:47] says we might be able to quote it but
[25:48] until you apply
[25:50] it that's where the working power is yes
[25:53] sir yes sir amen it's got to have
[25:57] substance yes
[26:00] amen but the good ground here's the word
[26:04] understands it and is able to apply it
[26:07] by bearing fruit that's how you know
[26:10] that there is a
[26:11] Believer because not only are they in
[26:14] the word they produce the
[26:16] word amenl so the function of a root I
[26:21] know what we kind of covered that but
[26:23] there's more so the function of a root
[26:25] it means to Anchor and to support
[26:27] holding the plant firmly in the soil
[26:30] preventing the plant from washing Away
[26:32] by water or by
[26:34] wind not carried about by every wind of
[26:37] Doctrine not being offended when they
[26:39] hear the water of the word yes sir amen
[26:42] but absorbing it and to be able to
[26:45] withstand
[26:46] it amen so it also absorbs and it stores
[26:51] nutrients and energy
[26:58] the
[26:59] message the message is the word you can
[27:02] look at it as a
[27:04] storehouse we've got a storehouse of
[27:07] sermons before us yes of the message of
[27:10] where we can go and that we can learn
[27:13] what the word if we don't understand
[27:15] this we can go to the message yes amen
[27:18] hallelujah I know I'm Los I'm I'm using
[27:20] that term kind of loosely because I
[27:22] think you have an understanding of how I
[27:24] feel of what the message is which I
[27:26] believe the message to be Jesus Christ
[27:28] am right so and brother Jesse is getting
[27:30] nervous what you going to
[27:33] say but if if we could keep that Focus
[27:36] that the message is Christ we're going
[27:38] to be doing okay we don't we don't want
[27:40] to go wide right we don't want to go
[27:42] wide left we don't want to go Thunders
[27:44] we don't want to go this we don't want
[27:46] to go that but we want to stay right
[27:48] down the middle as long as we can keep
[27:50] Christ as a focus Christ is the
[27:53] message and the and the message right
[27:57] that was given to brother brandom it was
[27:59] to bring forth the bride to meet the
[28:01] message amen yes
[28:07] Hallelujah so we've got a storehouse of
[28:10] messages of sermons that we can go to
[28:12] when we don't have the understanding
[28:13] that his message came and and and
[28:16] brought and
[28:17] introduced and clarified a lot of the
[28:20] Mysteries that brought forth so we could
[28:21] have the
[28:23] understanding
[28:25] amen that's right so when we get into
[28:28] these things when the no matter how
[28:31] strong the wind blows no matter how
[28:33] strong the storms are that we could be
[28:35] rooted that we could be grounded that we
[28:37] could be established into the word that
[28:40] no matter what persecutions come we're
[28:42] going to stay right there and we're
[28:43] going to have peace in our hearts we're
[28:45] not going to let anybody Shake us and
[28:47] we're going to have a
[28:48] boldness because we have
[28:51] access to the one that is exceeding
[28:54] abundantly able amen prise God go see
[28:59] Roots they dig deep in the soil they
[29:02] absorb the water and nutrients and they
[29:03] carry it through the rest of the
[29:06] body being rooted and grounded in the
[29:09] word we sustain constant nourishment
[29:12] Jesus is the vine and we are the
[29:14] branches so if he is the vine we should
[29:16] bear the same fruit hallelujah amen if
[29:20] it's showing forth a different kind of
[29:22] fruit that is of the wrong
[29:25] branch that Branch doesn't belong into
[29:27] that
[29:32] Vine so the vine is the life and the
[29:34] branch Bears the fruit right so if we
[29:38] bear fruit other than what is in the
[29:39] True Vine then we are not of the same
[29:41] life that is in the vine yes sir so
[29:45] brother brand says this he says look the
[29:47] same wind was making one moan and one
[29:49] groan was giving the other one a big
[29:51] time and I happen to think well what's
[29:53] this one doing and every time that
[29:55] little tree would twist what would it do
[29:57] it would pull the Roots loosen up the
[29:59] ground that's right loosen it up the
[30:01] ground that's what it's doing so it
[30:02] could grow deeper and get a better hold
[30:05] amen hallelujah hallelujah and every
[30:08] time God sends his blessings upon a born
[30:10] again man or woman it only loosens up
[30:13] the roots to grow deeper higher better
[30:15] Freer and glorify God Lord that's what
[30:19] it's doing that's what the tribulations
[30:21] are doing it's loosening up that ground
[30:23] so you can get rooted so you can get
[30:25] grounded so you can be more established
[30:27] amen
[30:30] amen and he says but I will restore
[30:33] sayeth the Lord that's what the Lord
[30:35] will do when you get a little bit hairy
[30:37] here and there you get a little bit
[30:39] weary here and there there's one that
[30:41] that'll encourage you that's one that's
[30:43] going to prepare the way for you
[30:45] Hallelujah for what did he say to the
[30:47] children of Israel when he spoke through
[30:48] Moses he said do you just stand still
[30:51] watch the salvation of the Lord amen he
[30:54] will restore when we get a little down
[30:57] we get a little hardships here and there
[30:59] he's still there to give us that Comfort
[31:01] he's still there amen he will not leave
[31:05] us he will not forsake us amen he is
[31:08] right
[31:10] there when we're in trouble I think I
[31:12] preached a message here a little while
[31:14] ago he uh about I will meet you there so
[31:17] when we meet the conditions and we call
[31:19] upon his name he's not going to leave us
[31:21] forsaken but he will meet us there all
[31:25] we have to do is utter his name off of
[31:27] our lips but we get so scared sometimes
[31:30] I don't know why a Believer shouldn't be
[31:32] afraid to utter his name prise God
[31:35] through his name there's
[31:38] Deliverance through his name there's
[31:40] salvation through his name there's
[31:42] forgiveness of sins
[31:45] Hallelujah
[31:46] Glory but where does it come in the
[31:49] humility of our hearts amen amen
[31:54] hallelujah not coming to him boastful
[31:57] and prideful
[32:00] amen but the root is the source of life
[32:03] that supplies the branches The Roots
[32:05] need to go downward as we bear fruit
[32:08] upward we've all heard the expression
[32:11] the Way Up Is
[32:14] Down coming in humility
[32:18] yes why else do we bow our heads before
[32:20] him in
[32:22] prayer to show that he is greater than
[32:25] we are we come to him and humility of
[32:32] spirit see we will be rooted in
[32:35] something we just have to decide what
[32:38] we're going to be rooted in yes sir and
[32:40] whether it's going to be good or whether
[32:42] it's going to be evil we're going to
[32:44] make that decision of what we're going
[32:47] to be rooted in it's we are the
[32:49] determining factor of what we're rooted
[32:52] in we make that
[32:55] choice otherwi that's why the rift the
[32:57] the scripture says you reap what you sow
[33:01] right because oh my now let's see what
[33:05] was told Brother
[33:06] brand oh let's go back get into the
[33:08] Rolodex of our memory I think it was
[33:11] because you have chosen the harder way
[33:16] hallelujah hallelujah is that right
[33:19] because he chose the harder way because
[33:21] you have chosen the harder way and not
[33:24] the easier way of the way of the K of
[33:27] the way of King not the way of the world
[33:29] not the way of riches amen that's
[33:33] right but you have decided to root
[33:36] yourself and ground yourself in the Lord
[33:38] Jesus Christ
[33:40] Hallelujah I don't even think I've got
[33:42] off page one yet but that's
[33:45] okay we don't gauge our sermons off of
[33:48] pages do we
[33:51] brother but we love the Lord amen yes
[33:55] sir now see through the scripture and
[33:59] this is where I think people get hung up
[34:01] is I don't think they realize that
[34:03] people are referred to in the scripture
[34:05] as trees yes and that's why serpent seed
[34:10] is so hard for people to understand
[34:12] because they can't view people as
[34:15] trees but that's where it
[34:18] is
[34:20] wonderful people are referred to as
[34:23] trees it's
[34:24] metaphoric yes sir Hallelujah this whole
[34:27] scripture scripture is
[34:29] symbolic but we try to understand it and
[34:31] read it with an an American
[34:34] mind and we try to Hash it out and we
[34:36] try to put everything of our
[34:39] understanding well this has got to fit
[34:41] into my American
[34:46] box you're not going to get the
[34:49] understanding this is an Eastern book
[34:51] that's right
[34:53] right this is an old ancient text it
[34:56] doesn't have all of our popular slang in
[34:59] it you know how many times the the the
[35:02] the words of of the American language or
[35:05] the English have changed the meaning of
[35:07] words
[35:10] yes it's funny because Caleb will try to
[35:13] He he'll come up with some of this slang
[35:15] that is not what that
[35:18] means and some well it might mean that
[35:21] today no it does not mean that
[35:28] I think the word was
[35:31] tripping I think he was using tripping
[35:33] or something no tripping means you're
[35:35] losing
[35:36] [Laughter]
[35:40] it dripping means you done lost your
[35:43] mind you you're going berserk over
[35:46] something silly
[35:48] right that's what I know tripping
[35:53] at so the those the English language has
[35:56] just changed over over the
[35:58] years I think it's because of somebody
[36:01] else's misunderstanding of the word so
[36:03] they wanted to they had the understand
[36:05] oh I think it means this you're far from
[36:09] it it doesn't mean that it means this
[36:12] yes so if you ever go back into the
[36:15] dictionary do anybody ever even look in
[36:17] a dictionary
[36:19] anymore my kids do because they ask how
[36:21] do you spell this well go find a
[36:23] dictionary well how am I supposed to
[36:25] find how to spell it if I don't how can
[36:27] I find it if I can't spell it I guess
[36:29] you're going to have to start from a and
[36:30] go all the way to
[36:32] Z start with what you
[36:36] think at least make an effort to go to
[36:38] the dictionary right but if you go if
[36:41] you if if you've ever gotten into a
[36:44] dictionary and you read some of the the
[36:46] the uh definition of words in there
[36:49] you'll see a little four-letter word in
[36:51] there about
[36:53] root of where that word came from it
[36:57] might be from Ireland it might be from
[37:00] Switzerland it might come from a a
[37:02] Germanic word it might come from a a
[37:05] French
[37:07] word yes
[37:10] sir but I think it all goes back to
[37:13] Latin I think all the languages if I'm
[37:16] not mistaken there might be a few but
[37:18] most of it is based on Latin and it's
[37:22] just changed over the years look at
[37:24] Spanish it's close to English and it's
[37:27] close to Spain but Spain and Mexican
[37:30] Spanish are not the
[37:32] same Italian is not the same as Spanish
[37:37] right but some of the words happen to be
[37:40] the same or you could figure it out why
[37:44] because there's a root behind that
[37:49] word
[37:52] okay I didn't know I was getting into
[37:54] teaching today
[37:57] but a dictionary could be your friend
[37:59] okay so if you don't understand I'm
[38:01] constantly looking at a dictionary you
[38:03] you brother so if you do any kind of
[38:05] study or research you're going to have
[38:07] to bef friend the
[38:09] dictionary be careful because some of
[38:11] them some of them are are a little loose
[38:15] so it's almost
[38:17] like Bible
[38:19] versions where'd you get that definition
[38:22] sorry and this is a side note I can't
[38:24] stand those words when you're trying to
[38:25] go look up a definition well what does
[38:28] it mean to what does sanctify mean oh it
[38:31] means to get Sanctified or uh to reach
[38:36] sanctification guess what you got to go
[38:38] to the root
[38:39] word to find out the meaning see there's
[38:43] something behind
[38:44] Roots eventually we're going to get back
[38:47] to Our Roots I'm going to I'm getting
[38:50] behind are we doing okay this morning so
[38:54] people are referred to as trees so so
[38:57] what do you think our fruits are fruit
[39:01] is our action what we do is considered
[39:04] our fruit so if we are trees what we
[39:07] bear is fruit if we uh uh lose our
[39:11] temper if we get anger that is our fruit
[39:15] if we are happy if we are kind if we
[39:17] have gentleness kindness meekness all
[39:19] these Temperance all these all these
[39:21] things it shows that what fruit we are
[39:24] bearing Hallelujah right it's our action
[39:28] that people
[39:29] see that's the fruit that's what it's
[39:32] talking about in case of you ever
[39:33] wondered what fruit was so that might
[39:35] help you back in the
[39:38] beginning about fruit because if we're
[39:40] going to bear fruit it doesn't mean
[39:42] we're going to Bear apricots it doesn't
[39:44] mean that we're going to Bear apples it
[39:46] doesn't mean that we're going to Bear
[39:48] pears right but it's our actions are the
[39:52] fruits of what it's talking
[39:54] about okay we got that right
[39:57] so doesn't the scripture say as a man
[39:59] thinketh in his heart so is he yes sir
[40:03] so that's going to show what he truly is
[40:07] somebody might do a good deed one
[40:11] time that doesn't mean that they're of
[40:14] God just because somebody does a good
[40:16] deed two times that doesn't mean that
[40:19] they're any closer to God some people
[40:22] just do good deeds okay it doesn't mean
[40:25] that they're Christian it doesn't mean
[40:27] mean that they're lost either
[40:30] right so but if you watch as they
[40:34] continue to Bear the fruit you can't
[40:38] judge a person by one or two actions see
[40:41] we we are people of Second Chances right
[40:43] because we beg and plead and I'm getting
[40:45] into a whole another Parable here so we
[40:47] beg and plead for
[40:49] forgiveness but we have a hard time
[40:51] forgiving somebody else right so when
[40:54] we're when when we're trying to get that
[40:57] we have to be mindful of how because we
[41:00] want the second chance shouldn't we give
[41:02] other people a second chance I might
[41:04] have been on this last time I I can't
[41:06] remember I was all over the place last
[41:08] time I can't remember where I
[41:10] was but Matthew 12 and 33 it says either
[41:13] make the tree good and his fruit good or
[41:17] else make the tree corrupt and his fruit
[41:19] corrupt for the tree is known by his
[41:24] fruit
[41:25] Hallelujah we are
[41:28] not what what's a oh don't judge me
[41:32] people are so quick to use that line
[41:33] especially the Christians oh you're not
[41:35] supposed to judge me yes I
[41:40] can because I'm not judging you I'm not
[41:43] casting judgment on you whether you're
[41:45] going to heaven or hell right when
[41:48] you're driving you make a judgment don't
[41:50] you oh you can't judge while you're
[41:53] driving a car Christian wrong judgment
[41:58] right we are able to make those kind of
[42:00] a judgments if somebody steals from a
[42:02] store they are what a thief if somebody
[42:06] kills somebody else for no reason
[42:09] they're a murderer oh we just judge
[42:13] people we made a judgment call according
[42:16] to the fruit that we can call it what it
[42:19] is that's right good good see people
[42:21] want to try to leave that obscured they
[42:23] want to try to leave it so Bleak that
[42:26] you don't call Sin
[42:29] Sin oh let's not be so specific here
[42:33] okay let let's just leave it in the gray
[42:36] area no I'm going to call it what it
[42:40] is we're not going to we're not here to
[42:43] sugar coat we're here to bring people to
[42:45] repentance as much as we can right if
[42:48] you try to sugar coat and tell people oh
[42:50] it's a flowery bed of ease than you're
[42:53] lying that's right right yes I remember
[42:57] one time testifying and I was a new
[43:00] convert and I had no idea brother
[43:01] brandom said this until years
[43:04] later but I got up and I testified you
[43:07] know I have never had this many
[43:10] battles it seemed to be so much easier
[43:13] when I was a
[43:14] sinner I didn't have all these battles
[43:18] and people the world would say well you
[43:20] can change that all you have to do is
[43:22] stop going to church your battles be
[43:25] over wrong
[43:30] I'm not here to compromise brother Jesse
[43:32] is not here to compromise brother amen's
[43:35] not here to compromise right brother
[43:36] van's not here to compromise we're not
[43:38] here to compromise right we're here to
[43:40] stay rooted and grounded and established
[43:42] in faith in Christ we're not here to
[43:45] compromise but we're going to say I'm
[43:46] going to continue
[43:48] on I'm going to even though somebody
[43:51] said this is physically impossible I'm
[43:52] going to pick myself up by my bootstraps
[43:54] and I'm going to continue on Amen yes
[43:58] it's
[44:01] metaphoric anyhow I better get off of
[44:03] that
[44:05] one so we could we know we can tell the
[44:09] the the the type of person that they're
[44:12] going to that they are just by their
[44:14] actions right because it's the fruit
[44:17] that's how we are fruit inspectors if
[44:19] you don't like to use the word I made a
[44:21] judgment call or I can make a judgment
[44:23] of what kind of a person I'm dealing
[44:25] with you could just say Well I'm fruit
[44:27] inspector if if you if you want to if
[44:30] you want to sugarcoat it okay so but I'm
[44:33] I'm not going to be told a lie by these
[44:35] people because they don't want to hear
[44:36] their sin that's right I don't want to
[44:39] back down just because they don't want
[44:40] to hear truth right you know and I'm
[44:43] sorry I'm I don't know why I'm going
[44:45] this way either but I I'm not on board
[44:48] for that non-binary stuff gender neutral
[44:51] stuff uh if if you could do simple
[44:54] algebra okay A plus b
[44:58] is two different variables right apple
[45:01] and an orange or you can call it banana
[45:02] cuz I said B so if you're adding an
[45:05] apple and a banana you have apple and
[45:09] banana it's not unless you're making a a
[45:12] drink apple banana strawberry kiwi stuff
[45:15] like that no it doesn't work you're
[45:17] either male or female okay that's that
[45:20] that's just the way it is nonb
[45:23] non-binary do you understand what that
[45:25] term is they're talking about binary a
[45:27] one or a
[45:28] zero because we're we're saying a binary
[45:31] is it's either a one or a zero that
[45:34] that's that's all the binary system is
[45:35] it's one or the other it's male or
[45:37] female you got two different things
[45:39] there if you add two males and two
[45:42] females you get 2 a and 2 B right you
[45:46] don't get 4
[45:47] a okay you understand I understand you
[45:51] could do Algebra you could plug any
[45:53] variable in there that you want to I get
[45:55] that
[45:57] but still you cannot mix apple and
[45:59] orange and when they're trying to say
[46:01] that men can men can produce get
[46:04] pregnant I don't think
[46:06] so oh but trans man can well that was a
[46:10] work in science in the medical field not
[46:13] nature you can't tell me that a male by
[46:16] nature is going to get pregnant it's not
[46:17] going to happen it's not going to happen
[46:20] sorry I don't know why we got there but
[46:23] that's you know where I stand I'm not
[46:26] going to sugarcoat it right so I'm just
[46:28] going to call what call it is what it
[46:30] is now can we be nicer about it sure we
[46:33] could be nicer about it and but I don't
[46:36] know why I'm going
[46:38] there so Romans chapter 11 verse 16 it
[46:42] says for if the first fruit be holy now
[46:45] this is going off of Matthew 12 where it
[46:46] says uh either make the tree good and is
[46:49] fruit good or make the tree corrupt and
[46:51] his fruit corrupt so Romans 11:16 it
[46:53] says for if the first fruit be holy the
[46:56] lump is also holy right so if one part
[47:01] is Holy the rest is Holy so and if the
[47:03] root uh uh uh the lump is also holy and
[47:07] if the root be holy so are the branches
[47:10] and vice versa if there's evil in that
[47:12] [Music]
[47:13] fruit the whole lump is
[47:16] evil the whole lump is evil amen so uh
[47:21] Jesus says this in John 15 in chapter 1
[47:24] sorry it almost feels like there was a
[47:26] damper put on the service and my
[47:28] apologies so but I'm not compromising
[47:32] either so John 15 and verse one Jesus
[47:36] says here he says I am the True Vine and
[47:39] my father is the
[47:40] husband okay every branch in me that
[47:43] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[47:45] every branch that he that that beareth
[47:47] fruit he purgeth it that it may bring
[47:50] forth more fruit talking about the
[47:52] pruning we prune a tree so it grows
[47:55] better if it's left unattended it grows
[47:58] wild and then it doesn't produce as much
[48:00] fruit but if it gets prudent if it gets
[48:02] taken care of it grows more fruit and
[48:06] better fruit amen so that you see the
[48:10] importance of tribulations you see the
[48:12] understanding the need for trials and of
[48:14] course we don't want to go through those
[48:16] because it's hardships right we don't
[48:17] want to go through hardships we want
[48:18] everything to go
[48:20] easy you know I asked a question when
[48:22] I'm working can't anything be easy
[48:27] cuz you just run into one snag after
[48:29] another it's something breaks or
[48:31] something something doesn't go in the
[48:33] hole just right you know a bolt strips
[48:36] and can't anything go easy then you get
[48:39] a little bit frustrated but you know
[48:42] that's that's where we need to stand is
[48:43] that we don't get frustrated and that we
[48:45] don't get thrown off course just because
[48:47] those things happen but we stay the
[48:49] course The Anchor Holds though the ship
[48:52] be tattered amen and those though the
[48:55] sails be torn we still maintain our
[48:58] course
[49:00] amen if not then we're not fighting the
[49:02] good fight of Faith amen so uh
[49:06] verse uh verse three says now ye are
[49:08] clean through the word which I have
[49:10] spoken unto you abide in me and I in you
[49:13] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[49:15] itself right it has to abide in the vine
[49:19] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[49:20] itself except it abide in the vine no
[49:23] more can ye except ye abide in me you
[49:26] can not do the works of God unless God
[49:29] indwells in
[49:31] you amen he says I am the vine ye are
[49:35] the branches he that abideth in me and I
[49:37] in him the same bringeth forth much
[49:39] fruit for without me ye can do
[49:43] nothing if a man abide not in me he is
[49:45] cast forth as a branch and is withered
[49:47] and Men gather them and cast them into
[49:49] into the fire and they are burnt if you
[49:52] abide in me and my words abide in you
[49:54] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[49:56] be done on un to you herein is my father
[49:58] glorified that ye bear much fruit so
[50:03] shall ye be my disciples you want to
[50:06] glorify the father you want to you want
[50:07] to uh uh uh edify him you want to show
[50:10] him uh uh honor you want to do all these
[50:13] nice things for the father he says
[50:14] herein is my father glorified that ye
[50:17] bear much fruit Glory much fruit not
[50:21] just a not just a little vidle once in a
[50:23] while not just a good deed once in a
[50:26] while right but it's it's an attitude
[50:28] it's a way of life it's the way we live
[50:31] every
[50:37] day we doing okay praise the Lord I know
[50:41] I ask that question a lot I'm told that
[50:47] often but I just want to make sure
[50:49] you're not mad at me no sir I don't know
[50:52] if you would tell me anyways you'd
[50:53] probably I'm not saying anything
[50:57] and that's probably good because it
[50:58] shows that you have a reverence for the
[51:00] sanctuary you know and a reverence for
[51:02] the Lord
[51:04] so so when we talk about Roots uh
[51:08] probably a lot of our minds go back to
[51:10] when when when I mention the word root
[51:12] you might think Green Thumb you know
[51:14] plants and stuff but what about your
[51:17] ancestry so the word also talks about
[51:20] the the ancestry also so when we talk
[51:22] about looking at our ancestries we talk
[51:25] about Tracing Our Our Roots right so
[51:28] somebody might say well what and where
[51:31] are your roots what are you talking
[51:34] about well where are you from well I'm
[51:36] from America if y'all didn't know I was
[51:38] born here in the United States and and
[51:40] uh my roots is
[51:43] [Laughter]
[51:45] mingled so I I have a whole slew of
[51:49] ancestry so they're probably hardly
[51:52] anybody pure bread
[51:55] anymore so when we look at that we
[51:57] typically look uh we we when we're
[52:00] talking about Roots we we typically
[52:02] think about uh what our family is what
[52:06] we're attached to what we value is kind
[52:09] of what we're what we are rooted
[52:11] to so uh so thinking of speaking of
[52:16] genealogies John the Baptist uh he he
[52:19] hammered this right out uh real quick on
[52:22] on those when he was baptizing people in
[52:24] Luke chapter 3 and verse 7
[52:27] is uh he he cut it off real quick that
[52:30] uh saying that you don't have I'm not
[52:31] even going to give you room to say that
[52:33] you have Abraham as your father you know
[52:35] so uh because each one of us have roots
[52:39] to Adam so It ultimately we all go back
[52:43] to Adam right we all go back to Noah
[52:45] because there were eight Souls saved but
[52:47] then ultimately we go back to Adam right
[52:50] so so who can Glory what nation can
[52:53] Glory oh our blood is better than uh
[52:55] nonsense
[52:56] you know I I just kind of go off of the
[52:59] brace yourself this is a philosophy is
[53:02] people are people I judge people off of
[53:04] character I don't judge people off of
[53:07] nationality you know so character
[53:10] character is what we
[53:12] can uh relate with right that's where we
[53:14] could find common ground is is having
[53:17] character so that's what we want to look
[53:20] at so verse uh verse 7 in Luke 3 he says
[53:24] then said he to the multitude that came
[53:25] forth to to be baptized of him oh
[53:28] Generation of Vipers who hath warned you
[53:29] to flee from the Wrath to come bring
[53:31] forth therefore fruits worthy of
[53:33] repentance and begin not to say within
[53:35] yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father
[53:37] for I say unto you that God is able of
[53:39] these stones to raise up children to
[53:40] Abraham amen so it do matter if they had
[53:43] TI of Abraham because they didn't do the
[53:45] works of
[53:47] Abraham as we learn in other in in other
[53:50] areas in the scripture he says this did
[53:52] not Abraham when they were trying to
[53:54] come against Christ the way that that
[53:56] they treated him he said Abraham didn't
[53:59] didn't treat people like this Hallelujah
[54:01] you say you're of Abraham and you're and
[54:03] you want to kill me this isn't the way
[54:06] of Abraham
[54:08] Hallelujah but yet they wanted to hold
[54:10] on to that genealogy of going back to
[54:13] Abraham's
[54:14] seed but they didn't have
[54:17] faith
[54:19] so so there's more to being uh a father
[54:22] Abraham for uh uh than just genealogy
[54:26] you know if you want to find commonality
[54:28] with them then we should bear the same
[54:30] same thing right so amen so in verse n
[54:34] it says and now also the ax is laid unto
[54:36] the root of the trees every tree
[54:38] therefore which bringeth forth or
[54:39] bringeth not forth good fruit is he down
[54:42] and cast into the fire so if you want to
[54:44] uh uh uh uh take something out which we
[54:46] were taught if you if if you want to
[54:48] kill something you cut off its head
[54:53] right so you got to cut it off at the
[54:55] head which is pretty much the the source
[54:58] of of of the body right that's how we
[54:59] function is through our head through
[55:01] through the knowledge so it's it's
[55:03] almost the same as the root because
[55:05] through the brain and the Brain stems
[55:07] that's how we're able to have nerves uh
[55:09] that's how we're able to respond to
[55:10] things that's how we have sight
[55:11] everything flows through the brain right
[55:14] muscle memory so if you want to kill
[55:16] something you get you get to the root
[55:18] which is the head so and and it's the
[55:21] same thing he's saying uh you can kind
[55:23] of look at this saying look I'm done
[55:25] playing around let's lay the axe to the
[55:27] root of the trees let's kill that Fruit
[55:29] by cutting off the
[55:30] root if you're doing evil works you
[55:33] bring forth uhh uh fruits worthy of
[55:36] repentance none of this false repentance
[55:39] stuff you know so so many things are
[55:41] sugarcoated out there and and and a
[55:43] flowery bed of
[55:44] ease that because they're more
[55:47] interested in numbers brother Jesse
[55:49] they're more interested in numbers
[55:51] filling the chairs than quality of
[55:53] people coming to Christ right
[55:57] yes sir so you say that there's false
[56:00] repentance yes I say that there is false
[56:02] repentance yes well how can we determine
[56:04] the difference well the difference would
[56:06] be one I'm not saying that you have to
[56:08] cry but we were warned about a dry-eyed
[56:12] confession if you're just saying oh I'm
[56:14] sorry and then you're you're longing to
[56:16] go back to do the same thing you didn't
[56:18] really repent what is repent mean repent
[56:21] means to stop turn and go the other
[56:25] direction the opposite direction stop
[56:28] doing what you were doing and cut it off
[56:31] at the root stop it turn and bring forth
[56:34] better
[56:37] fruit not just saying oh I'm sorry and
[56:42] not meaning it you know where the
[56:44] where's the
[56:46] genuine you know what I
[56:49] mean where's the genuine heart in that
[56:53] Hallelujah brother's laugh
[56:58] so where is the
[57:02] sincerity oh but I sigh and cry do you
[57:05] really and you can't even make it to the
[57:07] Altar for your own repentance right but
[57:11] you sigh and
[57:12] cry people might say they sigh and cry
[57:15] just so they can find common ground in
[57:17] the scriptures and seem more spiritual
[57:19] than what they actually are you know how
[57:22] the devil works right but repentance
[57:26] means that you have a desire to do it no
[57:28] more and you want that change yes sir
[57:30] hallelujah
[57:33] amen so this is Brother brandom again
[57:37] it's okay to read quotes
[57:39] right so now watch the scriptures let
[57:41] let them testify Jesus said search the
[57:44] scriptures for in them you think or
[57:46] believe that you have eternal life and
[57:48] they are the ones that testify me in
[57:50] other words if this tree ever brings
[57:52] forth a branch I am the vine the tree ye
[57:55] are the branches he that believeth in me
[57:57] the works that I do shall he do also
[57:59] that's very familiar John 4:12 right
[58:01] 14:12 excuse me and uh now he that
[58:04] abideth in me it was he it was that was
[58:07] in my root at the beginning now see if
[58:09] you want to sing Redemption Song you
[58:10] have to be part of him from the
[58:14] beginning in order to be redeemed
[58:17] redeemed means to buy back right or to
[58:20] to come and and bring back so if you
[58:23] weren't part of it from the beginning if
[58:25] you weren't a thought in his mine then
[58:27] you're not going to be brought back
[58:29] right there there's no
[58:32] Redemption because you had to be a part
[58:34] of him amen so if you want to uh uh uh
[58:38] now he that abideth in me he it was that
[58:40] was in my root at at the beginning so
[58:44] that's the reason Jesus was both the
[58:45] root and offspring of David he was
[58:47] before David in David and after davidj
[58:50] both root and
[58:52] Offspring The Morning Star the rose of
[58:55] Sharon the L of the valley Alpha and
[58:58] Omega father son holy ghost in him
[59:00] dwells the fullness of the godhead
[59:03] bodily both root and Offspring to David
[59:07] okay so he that has elected life he he
[59:12] that is the elected life the
[59:14] predestinated life that's in me talking
[59:16] about Christ and he is the word from the
[59:19] beginning when he comes forth he'll bear
[59:21] my
[59:23] fruits so if we are a part of him we
[59:25] will bear the same fruit
[59:29] amen so but others will live by the same
[59:32] thing calling themselves Christians and
[59:34] Believers not all that saith Lord Lord
[59:36] will enter in amen so even those that
[59:40] claim to be Christians you watch their
[59:41] life they they'll just say that they're
[59:43] just you'll just see that they're just
[59:45] putting a label on their
[59:47] shirt
[59:50] Christian but not doing the works of a
[59:53] Christian right yes let me inspect this
[59:56] fruit a little while yes that doesn't
[59:59] line up that doesn't line up that wo you
[1:00:02] do that and you say you're a Christian
[1:00:04] you're doing this that's right
[1:00:06] brother brother sister I think you need
[1:00:09] to get to the Altar and really become a
[1:00:10] Christian if you're going to say that
[1:00:11] you're a
[1:00:12] Christian in love of course you we don't
[1:00:15] want to go prideful we don't want to go
[1:00:17] with a with a a spirit of uh not
[1:00:21] condemnation but we don't want to have a
[1:00:23] condescending attitude you know we're up
[1:00:26] here and they're down here and and
[1:00:28] looking down our nose at them you know
[1:00:30] we want to bring them to the altar you
[1:00:32] know show them the right way right we
[1:00:35] want to do everything in love we don't
[1:00:37] want to do anything out of hate we don't
[1:00:38] want to do anything out of anger right
[1:00:41] so we want to do we want everything to
[1:00:42] be done in decency and in order right so
[1:00:46] it goes back to the golden rule we
[1:00:47] wouldn't like it if somebody grabbed us
[1:00:49] and and we're shaking us you're wrong
[1:00:51] you're wrong you're wrong and constantly
[1:00:53] saying you're wrong you're wrong you're
[1:00:54] wrong
[1:00:56] you how about giving some hope in
[1:01:01] there so now this is to take place and
[1:01:05] be manifested in the last days when the
[1:01:07] mysteries of God should be finished
[1:01:09] these trees the True Vine and the false
[1:01:12] Vine yep there could be both so how
[1:01:14] they've grown up together brought them
[1:01:16] in individuals and showed that from Cain
[1:01:19] and abble the two vines that met at an
[1:01:21] altar both of them religious both of
[1:01:23] them anointed both of them Desiring life
[1:01:26] both of them coming worshiping the same
[1:01:29] God and one was rejected and the other
[1:01:31] received and the only way that the one
[1:01:34] was that was received could have done
[1:01:35] anything different from his brother it
[1:01:37] was revealed to him for the Bible said
[1:01:38] by faith Hebrews in the 11th chapter by
[1:01:41] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:01:44] excellent sacrifice than that of Cain
[1:01:46] which God testified that he was
[1:01:49] righteous Jesus said the spiritual
[1:01:51] revelation of who he was who does man
[1:01:54] say I the son of man am he said pet uh
[1:01:57] Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:01:58] of the Living God see it's by
[1:02:01] Revelation amen so like I said just
[1:02:04] because somebody someone shows good
[1:02:06] fruit one time two times that doesn't
[1:02:08] mean that they're of God because in the
[1:02:10] scripture when Jesus was doing the
[1:02:11] Miracles what did they say I think it
[1:02:14] was Nicodemus I could be wrong but
[1:02:17] somebody in there said how can a man do
[1:02:19] these do these Works unless he be sent
[1:02:22] from God was that Nicodemus so they knew
[1:02:27] that those that the fruit that he was
[1:02:29] bearing was back to God doing the works
[1:02:33] of God hallelujah even Jesus said I can
[1:02:36] only do that but what the father shows
[1:02:38] me
[1:02:40] hallelujah
[1:02:44] amen see going back to John John
[1:02:46] immediately
[1:02:48] discarded uh any tie back to Abraham
[1:02:50] because it doesn't matter to whom we
[1:02:52] related it doesn't M it doesn't matter
[1:02:54] if your mommy and daddy went to church
[1:02:55] for years they grew up in the church it
[1:02:57] doesn't matter if you grew up in the
[1:02:58] church it doesn't matter if Grandma
[1:03:00] Grandpa Aunt Uncle Sally uh uh uh Aunt
[1:03:02] Sally Uncle Tom whatever uh Uncle Jim uh
[1:03:06] whatever it doesn't matter who you're
[1:03:07] related to you have to have your own
[1:03:10] experience with God you have to bear the
[1:03:12] fruits you have to make the decisions
[1:03:14] yes sir amen yes your feet will be held
[1:03:17] to the fire to make one kind of a
[1:03:19] decision or the other you cannot sit on
[1:03:21] the fence of
[1:03:23] neutrality you have to decide good or
[1:03:26] evil you have to make that decision of
[1:03:28] whom you're going to serve even Joshua
[1:03:30] said choose you this day of who you're
[1:03:32] going to serve but as far as me in my
[1:03:34] house we're going to serve the
[1:03:36] Lord a decision had to be made that's
[1:03:40] right Joshua declared his
[1:03:43] decision people had to figure it out
[1:03:45] with
[1:03:48] Judas people had to see the fruit
[1:03:51] because he said he was with Christ but
[1:03:53] we know what he did we know what his
[1:03:55] fruit was yes sir see the righteous have
[1:03:58] no no problem declaring who they're
[1:04:00] following but it's the other ones that
[1:04:02] are trying to mask it they have a hard
[1:04:04] time declaring who they're
[1:04:06] following you have to find out by their
[1:04:10] fruit
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:14] amen so Jesus said that he was the True
[1:04:17] Vine we read that in the
[1:04:19] scripture and that his father is a
[1:04:21] husband the husbandman expects good
[1:04:24] fruit for the heart Harvest and anything
[1:04:27] not worthwhile is discarded right it's
[1:04:29] wrapped up burnt burnt in the fire we we
[1:04:32] read that scripture so he knows the
[1:04:34] thoughts that he thinks about us
[1:04:36] thoughts of peace and not evil to give
[1:04:38] us an expected end right because he has
[1:04:42] given us the tools to navigate this
[1:04:44] world but what happens is is we don't
[1:04:47] take those tools we live under our
[1:04:53] privileges forgetting we must forget
[1:04:56] that we are children of God and that we
[1:04:59] have
[1:05:00] access to those
[1:05:05] benefits but oh I don't feel bold today
[1:05:08] I don't feel that the lord loves me if
[1:05:10] my children wake up that way then
[1:05:12] there's something wrong with
[1:05:14] me because there's they are still my
[1:05:18] children I am still going to Pro provide
[1:05:21] food for them I'm still going to
[1:05:23] provide a house shelter for them I'm
[1:05:27] going to provide clothes for them no
[1:05:30] matter if they drive me crazy the night
[1:05:32] before the morning the next morning I'm
[1:05:34] still going to love them because they
[1:05:36] are my
[1:05:38] children and if we know how to give our
[1:05:40] children good gifts so much the father
[1:05:43] knows how to give his children good
[1:05:45] gifts amen that's right amenu and we
[1:05:48] could take comfort in that being his
[1:05:51] children thank you Lord oh I made the
[1:05:53] Lord mad today he's not some like like
[1:05:56] those other God Gods back then like
[1:05:59] dayone and and things like that where
[1:06:01] they thought oh we've anchored the
[1:06:05] gods we still have we have a personal
[1:06:07] relationship with this God this God is
[1:06:11] our King he is our savior he is our
[1:06:13] provider he is everything that we need
[1:06:16] amen but yet we don't reach out and get
[1:06:20] it why because we want to do something
[1:06:24] else because we're fighting against this
[1:06:26] flesh it's always going to be a battle
[1:06:29] this flesh the carnality against the
[1:06:31] spirituality it's always going to be a
[1:06:33] battle it's always going to be there
[1:06:35] until the time of the Rapture that we're
[1:06:37] with him amen we're always going to
[1:06:40] struggle with the
[1:06:42] flesh so we we okay for a few minutes I
[1:06:46] I I know I've been going for a little
[1:06:51] bit so saying that with uh uh uh with
[1:06:55] the with the tree with the vine if it
[1:06:57] doesn't produce good fruit if it's not
[1:06:59] pleasing unto the husband the the
[1:07:02] husbandman he's going to gather it up
[1:07:04] and he's going to burn it with fire
[1:07:05] right so just like the fig tree that
[1:07:07] Jesus came across and he's he was hungry
[1:07:10] and he said oh I desire fruit of thee oh
[1:07:13] you have no fruit I curse you and then
[1:07:16] the next day right it was withered and
[1:07:18] the disciples
[1:07:19] were in awe over that and that's where
[1:07:22] he gave the teaching wheresoever you
[1:07:24] speak
[1:07:26] whatsoever you say you have this you
[1:07:28] have this ability too if you could just
[1:07:30] open up that realm if you could just
[1:07:33] open up your heart to it if you could
[1:07:35] just humble yourself and get there if
[1:07:38] you can get yourself out of the way and
[1:07:41] let
[1:07:42] him how much more successful we would be
[1:07:46] as a Christian yes sir but we try to
[1:07:48] push it so much ourselves well I got to
[1:07:50] do this I got to do that I got to treat
[1:07:52] this person such way I got to do this
[1:07:55] but we're CED about so much like Martha
[1:07:58] that we're not taking care of the merry
[1:08:00] things right the things that are needful
[1:08:03] that's
[1:08:05] right because we we let the things of
[1:08:07] the world come in a little too
[1:08:10] much yes sir yeah sure we desire things
[1:08:13] we desire a nice car yeah we we want
[1:08:15] something reliable to get to work and
[1:08:17] back right so sure we we want those
[1:08:20] things but when it becomes more
[1:08:22] important than him that's the problem
[1:08:25] yes sir that's the
[1:08:27] problem and did you know that the
[1:08:30] victory pretty much always represents
[1:08:32] Israel yes
[1:08:34] sir so do you understand where this this
[1:08:37] Parable where this cursing of the Fig
[1:08:39] Tree
[1:08:40] is is for a time because they stopped
[1:08:43] producing the
[1:08:45] fruit and then he's giving it over to
[1:08:47] the Gentiles amen now we have a
[1:08:51] turn but now it's coming full circle to
[1:08:55] where the Gentiles are not producing the
[1:08:57] fruit that's
[1:09:00] desired funny how that cycle works
[1:09:03] huh but it shouldn't be so if we have
[1:09:06] the knowledge if we have that
[1:09:08] understanding then we should be able to
[1:09:09] protect ourselves
[1:09:11] right so like I said true repentance is
[1:09:14] not just a confession but there's a
[1:09:16] changing when there's a true repentance
[1:09:18] when John the Baptist said bring forth
[1:09:20] fruits worthy of repentance he's saying
[1:09:22] really come and it's more than just a
[1:09:24] confession but it's a changing of your
[1:09:27] life when a repentance when a true
[1:09:28] repentance happens and you wonder well
[1:09:30] did I really repent did you have a
[1:09:32] change do I really have the Holy Spirit
[1:09:35] was there a change yes Hallelujah did
[1:09:38] something take place and did that thing
[1:09:41] take root Glory that's right
[1:09:44] GL because we want it to
[1:09:47] last not just rejoice in the Lord one
[1:09:50] time and then trials and tribulations
[1:09:52] come and then oh it didn't come the way
[1:09:54] that I expected
[1:09:56] so this isn't what I was cracked up to
[1:09:58] be so I can't serve the Lord
[1:10:01] anymore I had it much better out there I
[1:10:04] had I had more friends more friends
[1:10:06] doesn't mean better
[1:10:09] friends if you want friends a man must
[1:10:12] show himself friendly if you want
[1:10:15] friends choose yourself a good friend
[1:10:19] okay don't choose somebody that's that's
[1:10:21] that's got issues out of the world to be
[1:10:23] your best friend to be your your your
[1:10:25] go-to person when you need counsel you
[1:10:27] need Godly
[1:10:31] counsel iron sharpeneth iron right so
[1:10:36] Believers hang with
[1:10:38] Believers amen
[1:10:45] so when we get into those situations
[1:10:47] when we fall what what do people usually
[1:10:50] say well the devil made me do it but we
[1:10:53] can't we we're running out a room to be
[1:10:56] able to say that we can't say that
[1:10:57] anymore we can't use that as an excuse
[1:11:00] because uh James 1 and 14 and 15 it says
[1:11:03] but every man is tempted every man is
[1:11:05] tempted with something it's whatever
[1:11:07] your desire is Malachi's Temptations are
[1:11:09] going to be different from my
[1:11:10] Temptations this brother's Temptations
[1:11:12] are going to be different from my
[1:11:13] Temptations why because we're different
[1:11:15] people we have different likes surprise
[1:11:18] God likes a variety we're all not the
[1:11:20] same yes that's why when a church comes
[1:11:24] together and there's peace in the church
[1:11:25] when you have all these diversity uh uh
[1:11:28] uh diverse ideas husband wife they have
[1:11:31] different ideas they're not the same but
[1:11:33] they have to learn to coexist and in
[1:11:35] peace right so when you have a body that
[1:11:37] comes together in unity and can and can
[1:11:39] dwell and can serve and Worship the Lord
[1:11:42] in peace that's a wonderful body that
[1:11:45] you have going on that's where the
[1:11:47] presence of the Lord is welcome but when
[1:11:49] there's back bitings and strife and all
[1:11:51] these things happening the presence of
[1:11:52] the Lord is is a little bit quiet right
[1:11:55] right so we want the presence of the
[1:11:57] Lord because we want access to his
[1:12:00] benefits
[1:12:02] right
[1:12:03] so but every man is tempted when he is
[1:12:06] drawn away of his own lust and is
[1:12:09] enticed then when lust hath conceived it
[1:12:12] bringeth forth sin so temptation is not
[1:12:15] sin we have that understanding right
[1:12:17] temptation is not sin giving over to the
[1:12:20] Temptation that's where sin lies because
[1:12:23] every man is tempted but you have a
[1:12:25] choice you make that decision if you're
[1:12:27] going to partake of that fruit or you're
[1:12:29] not amen so but uh uh uh then when lust
[1:12:33] ha conceived it bringeth forth sin and
[1:12:35] sin when it is finished it bringeth
[1:12:37] forth death which is the wages of sin
[1:12:41] amen amen so we we see where that lies
[1:12:43] I'm going to try to wind this down uh
[1:12:45] give me a few more minutes is that okay
[1:12:48] sir I think I did the same thing last
[1:12:50] time I I closed I don't know how many
[1:12:52] times or I was I was in closing you know
[1:12:55] as soon as you say I'm closing now the
[1:12:57] eyes come Wide Awake oh boy he's getting
[1:12:59] ready to
[1:13:00] close so I'm going to say that often no
[1:13:02] I'm kidding I'm not going to do that
[1:13:05] wake everybody
[1:13:07] up
[1:13:12] so playing around I lost my spot so
[1:13:16] getting
[1:13:20] to it took me a long time to get to this
[1:13:23] spot okay we're going to kind of wind
[1:13:24] down with this thought here is roots
[1:13:27] when you cut the root you kill the fruit
[1:13:29] right so when you cut the root of the
[1:13:32] evil
[1:13:33] Vine the evil Deeds cease you kill that
[1:13:37] fruit and the same thing with the good
[1:13:39] Vine if you cut the good Vine The Good
[1:13:42] Deeds
[1:13:43] cease we don't want to cut that vine we
[1:13:46] want to cut the evil Vine the evil root
[1:13:49] we want to lay the axe to the root of
[1:13:51] the evil tree amen yes sir so
[1:13:56] uh just going to read through this if
[1:13:58] that's
[1:13:59] okay so it is vital that you search
[1:14:05] out to discover the root cause of every
[1:14:08] problem and this is what I wanted to get
[1:14:10] to is the root cause of situations the
[1:14:14] root cause of when people find
[1:14:16] themselves in sin what is the root cause
[1:14:19] if it's gambling it's the lust of one of
[1:14:22] of of the the uh
[1:14:26] the excitement of the
[1:14:28] gamble oh I might strike it big I might
[1:14:31] lose big but strike it a big and that's
[1:14:33] a terrible investment idea for those
[1:14:35] young ones out there if you think
[1:14:36] gambling is a good investment idea it's
[1:14:38] a terrible investment
[1:14:42] idea so getting to the root of the cause
[1:14:46] of what you're doing not just not a
[1:14:49] false repentance like what I was saying
[1:14:51] but truly getting to the to the root
[1:14:54] cause of the problem amen
[1:14:57] so if you go to counseling for uh a AA
[1:15:01] alcohol Alcoholics Anonymous if you go
[1:15:03] to counseling for drug addiction if you
[1:15:05] go to uh uh counseling for
[1:15:09] uh pornography addiction if you go to
[1:15:12] counseling for some kind of an addiction
[1:15:15] one of the first things that you have to
[1:15:17] do there that they counsel you on is
[1:15:20] first you have to recognize that there
[1:15:22] is a problem
[1:15:26] yes first you have to be able to humble
[1:15:28] yourself and recognize I am doing
[1:15:32] this right you have to say that there is
[1:15:34] a problem the second thing is you have
[1:15:38] to have a desire to want to get rid of
[1:15:41] that
[1:15:41] thing if there's no if you want to keep
[1:15:44] doing like that like that man that uh uh
[1:15:46] uh uh fell across brother bram's uh foot
[1:15:49] uh because he said I'm going to tear you
[1:15:51] from limb to limb or rip your head off
[1:15:52] or he was going to do some kind of
[1:15:54] violence to him' and and brother Brandon
[1:15:56] just said nah you'll fall across my feet
[1:16:00] so when they uh people were asking well
[1:16:02] should we move him you know should we
[1:16:04] cast out demon or I I can't remember the
[1:16:06] the whole story exactly verbatim but uh
[1:16:09] they were asking questions and he says
[1:16:11] no it's not going to come out of him
[1:16:13] there there's no point because he loves
[1:16:16] that spirit and that spirit's going to
[1:16:19] stay there because he wanted it to stay
[1:16:21] there that's right he had a love for
[1:16:23] that Spirit now see that's the second
[1:16:25] first you have to recognize that there
[1:16:26] is a spirit you have to discern that
[1:16:28] there is an evil spirit there second you
[1:16:30] have to be willing to get rid of that
[1:16:32] Spirit third you have to take the steps
[1:16:35] to take care of that
[1:16:38] spirit so
[1:16:40] recognize discern and put into action
[1:16:44] because if you don't if if you have the
[1:16:46] desire to want to do something about it
[1:16:48] but then you don't do anything then that
[1:16:50] Spirit has a right to stay there yes but
[1:16:53] until you take a step forward and say
[1:16:56] I'm sick of you I'm taking the ax and
[1:16:58] I'm laying it to the root of your
[1:17:00] fruit your root has no more dominion
[1:17:03] over me and you cast that thing
[1:17:07] out see but that's that's where sin
[1:17:10] still lies in people just because they
[1:17:13] come with a confession say oh I've done
[1:17:15] such and such but they are not willing
[1:17:17] to get it taken care
[1:17:19] of and we wonder why people are still
[1:17:22] sick we people we wonder why people are
[1:17:24] still struggles yes yes sir MH oh we we
[1:17:29] we'll get there so it is vital to
[1:17:32] honestly search out to discover the root
[1:17:34] cause of every problem for example the
[1:17:35] root cause is not drug addiction it is
[1:17:37] what is fueling the drug addiction the
[1:17:40] root cause is not immorality it is the
[1:17:42] lust resulting in the immoral immoral
[1:17:46] Behavior see we have to get to the root
[1:17:49] of it this is where you have to call
[1:17:52] black black and white white because
[1:17:55] we're not playing in this spiritual
[1:17:56] realm yes sir we are not compromising
[1:17:59] this spiritual realm we are possessing
[1:18:02] the Gate of our enemy and we have to put
[1:18:04] it in our mind I am here I am tired of
[1:18:07] it I am taking my life back I am taking
[1:18:09] this back I'm taking my joy back I'm
[1:18:12] taking everything good
[1:18:14] back I'm tired of you holding me
[1:18:17] down amen we've got to be sick and tired
[1:18:21] of being sick and tired amen but we' got
[1:18:25] to do something about it even the
[1:18:27] scripture teaches about that teaches us
[1:18:29] about that when you cast the spirit out
[1:18:30] then you've got to fill it with
[1:18:32] righteousness if not that same Spirit
[1:18:34] once it's swept and garnished out if you
[1:18:36] don't fill it with something righteous
[1:18:38] that spirit's going to come back and
[1:18:39] he's going to bring his friends with
[1:18:41] him and it's going to be a worse child
[1:18:44] of Hell than ever yes sir and you think
[1:18:46] it was hard to cast the first one
[1:18:49] out W my it's going to be much harder to
[1:18:53] cast out eight demons
[1:18:55] yeah then it is one demon yes sir yes
[1:18:58] sir so when you have these things taken
[1:19:01] care of you've got to fill it with
[1:19:03] righteousness you've got to fill it with
[1:19:05] word you've got to get into the word and
[1:19:07] suck up the nutrients suck up the water
[1:19:09] hallelujah amen so you produce the right
[1:19:13] fruit amen so the Bible commands us to
[1:19:16] diligently seek and destroy the roots of
[1:19:18] sinful Behavior amen see Hebrews 12:5 it
[1:19:21] says looking diligently lest any man f
[1:19:24] fail of the grace of God lest any root
[1:19:27] of bitterness springing up trouble you
[1:19:29] and thereby many many be
[1:19:32] defiled Oh you mean my actions can can
[1:19:36] have an effect on others yes
[1:19:39] sir your negativity can be contagious to
[1:19:42] somebody else your positivity can be
[1:19:45] contagious to somebody
[1:19:47] elseu it's what we choose our fruit to
[1:19:50] be it's what we choose to be rooted in
[1:19:55] because we will bear the fruit of what
[1:19:56] root we are rooted
[1:19:59] in I know it's not very deep is it but
[1:20:02] if you think about it it's more deep
[1:20:04] than what you think and that's where the
[1:20:05] problem
[1:20:09] lies so lest any root of B bitterness
[1:20:13] spring up trouble you and thereby many
[1:20:15] being many be defiled if the root causes
[1:20:18] uh if the root causes of problems are
[1:20:20] not dealt with the problems will only
[1:20:23] intensify when is Isel invaded the
[1:20:25] promised land God told them not to allow
[1:20:27] any of the enemy to remain but the Bible
[1:20:29] records that Joshua spared Giants in
[1:20:31] three cities Gaza ashdod and gath Joshua
[1:20:34] 11: 21- 22 says later the Bible relates
[1:20:38] that Samson got in trouble in Gaza
[1:20:40] judges
[1:20:43] 16 the Ark of God's glory was lost in
[1:20:46] ashdod 1st Samuel 5 and Goliath
[1:20:48] paralyzed the troops of Israel in gath 1
[1:20:51] Samuel 17 none of these tragedies
[1:20:54] probably would have occurred had not the
[1:20:56] Giants been left in the land Israel left
[1:20:58] a root and it bore fruit and it caused a
[1:21:02] snag to them
[1:21:04] later Giants beget Giants in both the
[1:21:07] natural and the spiritual World
[1:21:08] eliminate the spiritual Giants of sin
[1:21:10] and they will no longer reproduce amen
[1:21:14] deal with the root causes and the
[1:21:15] surface manifestations will cease as in
[1:21:18] the natural world so it is in the
[1:21:19] spiritual cut the root and you will kill
[1:21:21] the fruit of that root amen
[1:21:25] so smoking chewing gambling adultery are
[1:21:27] attributes of sin we understand that
[1:21:29] right the root is the
[1:21:32] unbelief which is the lust drugs and
[1:21:35] alcohol are not the root of an addiction
[1:21:37] but the lust the desire to have it
[1:21:40] people act out because of an underlying
[1:21:42] issue in their childhood that goes back
[1:21:44] to a root of some hurtful uh act that
[1:21:47] happened to them years past and it left
[1:21:50] the scar on them and that's why they
[1:21:51] behave the way that they do usually in a
[1:21:54] in a
[1:21:56] defense people get shut in they they
[1:21:59] just enclosed and they won't let anybody
[1:22:01] in why because there's a trust issue why
[1:22:03] because somebody broke their
[1:22:07] trust that's why we got to be careful
[1:22:10] that we don't root up the tears along
[1:22:11] with the wheat because we could pull up
[1:22:13] the wheat so that's why we have to tread
[1:22:17] softly but I'm not saying that we
[1:22:20] compromise but we tread tread lightly
[1:22:22] amen we tread with love love
[1:22:26] amen there was a woman that that brother
[1:22:28] Brandon told the story about that fell
[1:22:30] to temptation to the dance hall remember
[1:22:32] and then she she thought she lost her
[1:22:34] her salvation why was there why was
[1:22:37] there a a desire to go to the dance hall
[1:22:39] because there was something rooted in
[1:22:41] her she was a
[1:22:43] dancer and she wasn't fully cut off from
[1:22:47] that yes so when she walked
[1:22:51] by hearing that beat
[1:22:57] whatever beat you want to put in your
[1:22:59] mind I'm not a musician so I'll just
[1:23:01] throw out
[1:23:04] anything but it struck something in her
[1:23:06] in her spirit that she had common ground
[1:23:09] with before that wasn't fully cut off
[1:23:12] and then she wanted to go into the dance
[1:23:13] hall and she danced because she missed
[1:23:17] dancing and then she thought she'd lost
[1:23:19] her salvation no sister you didn't lose
[1:23:22] your salvation but you need to repent
[1:23:24] from that thing and stay away from that
[1:23:27] thing so when we now see I I changed I
[1:23:31] changed careers here uh last last April
[1:23:35] May so when I when I meet challenges or
[1:23:39] when I first met challenges there what
[1:23:41] do you think I wanted to do I wanted to
[1:23:44] yeah I wanted to go back to what I knew
[1:23:48] because I worked in the glass industry
[1:23:49] for 25 years I I kind of knew that that
[1:23:52] process pretty well
[1:23:55] so what I wanted to do is I don't like
[1:23:58] this I got to go back to the Glass
[1:23:59] Factory he said stop thinking that
[1:24:03] you're not going back to the Glass fairy
[1:24:05] glass no I'm not going to a glass fairy
[1:24:07] either you're not going back to the
[1:24:09] Glass Factory you know because I wanted
[1:24:12] a change from that and I'm not going
[1:24:14] back there but all the these thoughts
[1:24:16] come every now and then and it just
[1:24:18] types the spiritual so much because
[1:24:20] those those things come into our minds
[1:24:23] the greatest battle ever thought is the
[1:24:25] Mind battle right so things come to our
[1:24:27] minds and oh I got to revert back to the
[1:24:29] old thing why because it's what you
[1:24:32] knew it's what you're close more closely
[1:24:35] associated with because it's scary to
[1:24:38] move on to something new because we
[1:24:41] don't know what it's going to hold so
[1:24:43] what do we do we go right back to our
[1:24:45] comfort zone to what we knew and that's
[1:24:47] how people go just like the the seed
[1:24:50] when it's thrown upon the what was it
[1:24:52] the Stony ground when the tribulations
[1:24:55] and and the persecutions come they're
[1:24:58] not rooted and grounded or it might have
[1:25:00] been among the Thorns I can't remember
[1:25:02] I'd have to go back to my notes I wish
[1:25:05] well
[1:25:06] no not even
[1:25:08] going
[1:25:10] so there's another story that brother
[1:25:12] brandom talked about that a woman was
[1:25:15] sick and she went to him for prayer and
[1:25:18] he pretty much told her you're not going
[1:25:20] to get healed because you have an
[1:25:21] underlying you have sin still dwelling
[1:25:25] why I confessed all that
[1:25:27] well you still have to make it right to
[1:25:30] your husband because he discerned that
[1:25:33] there was adultery well I can't tell him
[1:25:36] that well long story short he said well
[1:25:40] rest assured sister he has the same
[1:25:42] thing to confess to you you know a
[1:25:44] Sunday school teacher and a deacon so it
[1:25:47] doesn't matter what position you have
[1:25:50] that doesn't that doesn't make you
[1:25:51] immune to to anything right right people
[1:25:54] can still fall into sin but they
[1:25:56] couldn't get their healing because there
[1:25:58] was underlying
[1:26:00] issue that they confessed but they
[1:26:03] didn't
[1:26:04] repent they did they conf they kind of
[1:26:07] confessed but they didn't
[1:26:09] confess you know when we do things to
[1:26:11] hurt one another we're supposed to go to
[1:26:13] the one that we hurt yes sir yes it's
[1:26:16] nice that we go to the Lord and
[1:26:17] apologize Lord I'm so sorry I did that
[1:26:20] yep we need to apologize for a fruit
[1:26:22] that we bore that wasn't of his Vine
[1:26:25] yes but aren't we supposed to go to the
[1:26:27] one that we hurt and that's where the
[1:26:30] true repentance comes in some people are
[1:26:33] just they have a hard time saying that
[1:26:35] I'm sorry they cannot come and say look
[1:26:38] I did this yes it's embarrassing it it
[1:26:41] is humiliating it is it absolutely
[1:26:45] is but to come before somebody and say I
[1:26:49] did such and such and I'm
[1:26:51] sorry well sorry isn't going to fix it
[1:26:54] no but I'm trying to fix it by
[1:26:56] apologizing repenting and you know
[1:26:59] hopefully we can keep a relationship
[1:27:01] going you know friends friendship or
[1:27:04] marriage whatever it
[1:27:06] is it's hard it is absolutely hard
[1:27:10] because you might lose everything that
[1:27:12] you
[1:27:12] knew just by coming but you'll be
[1:27:15] delivered you'll be free you'll be free
[1:27:18] in the
[1:27:19] Lord so don't hold on to things don't
[1:27:21] have that root of bitterness in you
[1:27:23] because it's going to tear you up and
[1:27:25] it's going to hinder you from receiving
[1:27:26] from the Lord
[1:27:39] amen I'll just go to close with a couple
[1:27:42] of these these
[1:27:44] here I know that that's what three has
[1:27:46] anybody been keeping track that it
[1:27:48] wasn't three I
[1:27:50] forgot no so Samson had that same issue
[1:27:55] is that he couldn't come he couldn't
[1:27:57] give the Lord his heart we know we
[1:27:59] understand that he gave the Lord his
[1:28:00] strength so that's all he could use but
[1:28:02] when the time
[1:28:05] came that mattered for him to stand
[1:28:08] strong he got weak and
[1:28:11] fell amen so because he let his guard
[1:28:15] down we cannot let our guard down we
[1:28:17] cannot let the bars down right we cannot
[1:28:20] compromise on the word yes sir we cannot
[1:28:23] compromise our position position we
[1:28:24] cannot compromise our relationship with
[1:28:26] the
[1:28:28] Lord so I talked about riches that was
[1:28:31] one of the the the seeds that fell upon
[1:28:33] the ground and the the deceitfulness of
[1:28:36] of riches right uh so it's not so much
[1:28:40] that a rich person I me I mean a person
[1:28:43] can have
[1:28:44] money but it's the love of money that is
[1:28:47] the root of all evil it's not money
[1:28:49] that's the root of all evil it's the
[1:28:51] love of money right that's 1 Timothy 610
[1:28:54] it says For the Love of Money is the
[1:28:55] root of all evil which while some
[1:28:58] coveted after they have aired from the
[1:28:59] faith and pierced themselves through
[1:29:01] with many many
[1:29:04] Sorrows because they they had a love of
[1:29:07] money and how many's thinking of Judas
[1:29:09] how many think how many is thinking of
[1:29:11] Joseph when his brother with his brother
[1:29:13] sold him into slavery for 20 pieces of
[1:29:16] silver Judas the
[1:29:18] fruit shows when he sold out Jesus for
[1:29:21] 30 pieces of silver m yes because it was
[1:29:25] the love of money right and and jealousy
[1:29:27] gets in way jealousy is a root that
[1:29:30] needs weeded
[1:29:32] out ananas and
[1:29:34] Safa huh they they held back money when
[1:29:37] they sold their their property or
[1:29:39] whatever they they yeah they sold their
[1:29:40] property and they held back a portion of
[1:29:44] the sum and then they told the disciples
[1:29:46] oh we sold the property for only this
[1:29:48] much
[1:29:49] money and I think it was Peter he says
[1:29:51] why have you let who Satan enter into
[1:29:55] thine heart to do this thing yeah see
[1:29:58] you see the fruit right there it was it
[1:30:00] was called out black was called black
[1:30:02] and white was called
[1:30:03] White that that that the problem was
[1:30:06] rooted out right there why have you let
[1:30:08] Satan into your heart to do this yes
[1:30:12] sir so that goes back the devil made me
[1:30:15] do it no because we are making a
[1:30:17] conscious decision on many things we we
[1:30:20] could we're being influenced but it h
[1:30:24] now there has been a time before that
[1:30:26] that I I could say that something had a
[1:30:29] power over me but I can't say that every
[1:30:32] time I do something wrong that the devil
[1:30:34] made me do it right I can't say
[1:30:36] that so so jealousy John 12 911 and you
[1:30:43] can stand to your feet with me I'm going
[1:30:45] to close with these couple scriptures
[1:30:48] here so much of the much people of the
[1:30:50] Jews therefore knew that he was there
[1:30:52] talking we spoke on this the last time
[1:30:54] about the alabaster box so this is the
[1:30:56] setting here so much people of the Jews
[1:30:58] therefore knew that he was there and
[1:30:59] they came not for jesus' sake only but
[1:31:01] that they might see Lazarus also whom he
[1:31:03] had raised from the dead see they were
[1:31:05] more interested in the Miracles that had
[1:31:07] happened than the one that was able to
[1:31:09] give salvation the one that is the root
[1:31:11] of all those Miracles so verse 10 it
[1:31:14] says but the chief priests consulted
[1:31:15] that they might put Lazarus also to
[1:31:17] death because that by reason of of him
[1:31:20] many of the Jews went away and believed
[1:31:21] on Jesus see he was the jealousy that uh
[1:31:25] that that they were calling people away
[1:31:27] from from
[1:31:29] them it wasn't as lucrative anymore they
[1:31:32] weren't able to con the people anymore
[1:31:34] because these people went to Jesus amen
[1:31:37] they found something better amen
[1:31:39] somebody was a little bit more popular
[1:31:41] than them so they got upset and they
[1:31:43] wanted to kill them right so and that's
[1:31:47] hate to give back to Hollywood but
[1:31:48] that's how Hollywood is it's a Cutthroat
[1:31:51] business over there I don't know if
[1:31:52] people are killing one another just to
[1:31:54] get parts I'm not I'm not saying that
[1:31:56] but but people trying to uh uh they're
[1:31:59] gunning for different positions they
[1:32:01] will put people down they will kill
[1:32:02] somebody's influence which is almost the
[1:32:04] same as killing a
[1:32:05] man and it's that's that's what it's
[1:32:08] meant by a Cutthroat uh situation uh
[1:32:12] it's it's a very competitive environment
[1:32:15] that people will chop one another down
[1:32:17] just to just to get that higher seat
[1:32:19] that promotion you know or whatever it
[1:32:21] is or something better
[1:32:24] so and unfortunately we have that in
[1:32:26] church ranks you know I'm not I'm not
[1:32:29] saying here I'm not saying in the home
[1:32:30] church but we've we've heard stories of
[1:32:32] different different uh uh uh uh places
[1:32:35] you know I think we've yeah so if you if
[1:32:38] you've seen stuff like that people uh
[1:32:40] trying to get to the higher position and
[1:32:42] they're cutting down anybody that they
[1:32:43] can in their in their way so we don't
[1:32:46] want that you know we don't want
[1:32:48] jealousy you know weep with them with
[1:32:51] that weep but Rejoice with them that
[1:32:53] rejoice
[1:32:54] sometimes that's a hard thing you know
[1:32:57] sharing in somebody else rejoicing uh
[1:33:00] sometimes that hard because the root of
[1:33:01] bitterness will come in or the root of
[1:33:02] jealousy will come in and it'll destroy
[1:33:05] that if you're not careful so uh uh we
[1:33:09] also learned because of uh getting to
[1:33:11] the root of a problem is because of the
[1:33:12] hardness of hearts in Matthew
[1:33:15] 19-7 it says they say unto him why did
[1:33:17] Moses then command to give a writing of
[1:33:19] divorcement and to put her away he saith
[1:33:21] unto them Moses because of the hardness
[1:33:24] of your heart suffered you to put away
[1:33:25] your wives but from the beginning it was
[1:33:28] not
[1:33:29] so he said because of the hardness of
[1:33:31] your hearts because you're cold-hearted
[1:33:34] that's why you want the writing of
[1:33:36] divorcement because you want out of this
[1:33:37] thing you want something different you
[1:33:38] might have found something better than
[1:33:40] you want out of the relationship
[1:33:41] forgetting that you said vows that's
[1:33:43] right that you promis to stay with one
[1:33:46] another amen and what happens is is in
[1:33:49] those situations selfishness comes
[1:33:51] in and Pride because the other can't
[1:33:55] humble themselves enough to to accept
[1:33:57] the other person's explanation or or or
[1:34:00] trying to make something right yeah that
[1:34:02] kind of goes both ways doesn't it
[1:34:04] somebody trying to make something right
[1:34:05] and then somebody that won't let you
[1:34:07] make something right because of because
[1:34:08] they're coldhearted they cannot receive
[1:34:13] it so and you know
[1:34:19] uh the disciples tried to cast out a
[1:34:21] demon and they came uh so the Lord the
[1:34:24] Lord Jesus came and he cast out that
[1:34:27] demon so they ask a question Lord why
[1:34:29] couldn't we cast out that demon he says
[1:34:32] uh because of your unbelief for one so
[1:34:35] there's a root right there which we
[1:34:37] understand that because you know smoke
[1:34:39] and drink and all those things aren't
[1:34:40] sin but it's the attribute of sin we
[1:34:42] people do those things because they
[1:34:44] don't believe so because of your
[1:34:46] unbelief you were not able to cast that
[1:34:48] demon out and he says this kind and we
[1:34:51] know every seed shall produce after it
[1:34:53] its own kind right so this kind talking
[1:34:56] about a a demonic Spirit he said this
[1:34:58] kind cannot come out except by prayer
[1:35:01] and fasting so I ask you how how sincere
[1:35:05] are we in our relationship with the Lord
[1:35:07] are we are we sincere yeah you came to
[1:35:10] church this morning what was the purpose
[1:35:12] you came to church don't answer me
[1:35:13] answer yourself what was the purpose
[1:35:15] that you came to church I'm hoping that
[1:35:18] it was because you wanted to come and
[1:35:19] sing songs of Zion Sing Sing worship
[1:35:22] songs unto the Lord coming and
[1:35:23] fellowshipping with with Believers
[1:35:25] coming and wanting to hear the word
[1:35:27] hopefully your desire was to get closer
[1:35:29] to the Lord hallelu but you might find
[1:35:33] yourself that you can't get closer to
[1:35:35] the Lord and you're wondering why you
[1:35:37] know I prayed for a couple people and I
[1:35:39] this was that brother cams uh years ago
[1:35:41] I can't remember if I told this story
[1:35:43] here or not so forgive me if I repeated
[1:35:45] it so I remember praying for a sister
[1:35:48] one time and and uh brother Carle was
[1:35:50] with me I want to say it was brother
[1:35:51] Steven and we went to pray pray for this
[1:35:54] sister and uh I started praying she you
[1:35:58] know she came up for prayer we started
[1:35:59] praying and and uh it just felt like a
[1:36:02] whole wall came up and I and it was kind
[1:36:06] of weird that uh you know this was
[1:36:08] something strange that I had never
[1:36:10] experienced before but I I figured it
[1:36:12] was the Lord so I told her I said sister
[1:36:14] I'm sorry but I can't I can't get
[1:36:17] anywhere in in prayer I said I'll I'll
[1:36:19] pray with you for a few minutes and uh
[1:36:22] you know to see if the Lord will open up
[1:36:23] but it just feels like there's a wall
[1:36:25] and uh it just feels like that there's
[1:36:28] no
[1:36:29] access and uh so I was just with her
[1:36:32] brother Steve and I were with her and
[1:36:34] you know just talking to the Lord and
[1:36:36] that all you know it seemed like maybe
[1:36:39] five minutes 10 minutes it could have
[1:36:40] been a half hour for all I know I had I
[1:36:42] had no concept of time and just all of a
[1:36:45] sudden uh it was like that curtain came
[1:36:48] up I said well sister I don't know I
[1:36:51] don't know if you made something right I
[1:36:52] don't know what happen but all I know is
[1:36:55] that curtain is lifted I said now let's
[1:36:56] enter into prayer for your need and uh
[1:36:59] so there was a brother uh the same
[1:37:02] service it was like the same situation I
[1:37:04] went and I I I started praying for him
[1:37:07] and uh I told him I said brother just
[1:37:09] seems like there's a wall there that I
[1:37:11] can't I can't get through there and uh
[1:37:15] and I think I remember something I
[1:37:17] started saying if if you want if you
[1:37:19] want to receive something from the Lord
[1:37:20] then uh if you're afraid that you're not
[1:37:23] going to receive receive it you might as
[1:37:24] well go sit down because you're not
[1:37:25] going to get anything it was something
[1:37:26] to that that effect and I prayed with
[1:37:29] him about the same as his sister and
[1:37:31] that curtain lifted I said okay brother
[1:37:32] let's go let's enter into into prayer
[1:37:35] now I'm not telling you this to try to
[1:37:36] sound like I'm super spiritual that that
[1:37:38] was just something strange happened to
[1:37:40] me and then it happened at at the home
[1:37:42] Church another time and this was years
[1:37:44] later and uh and I explained it to the
[1:37:47] church and there was a brother that came
[1:37:49] up uh after that he said uh
[1:37:54] brother I've been it feels like I'm I'm
[1:37:56] not able to get anything from the it
[1:37:58] just feels like that there's that
[1:38:00] curtain there that I can't get access
[1:38:02] there and come to find out he had an
[1:38:05] argument with his wife and
[1:38:09] he he went and he apologized to his
[1:38:12] wife and he came back he said and uh I
[1:38:16] told him I said it just I didn't know
[1:38:18] this until after he told me uh I said
[1:38:21] brother it just seems like there's a a
[1:38:23] it seems like that curtain is lifted I
[1:38:26] said now we can enter into prayer so I
[1:38:28] want to the reason why I'm telling you
[1:38:30] this is because there's a a
[1:38:32] root there's there's an underlying issue
[1:38:35] a lot of times of why you can't receive
[1:38:37] from God you know the we've known we've
[1:38:40] known people to say that if I don't
[1:38:42] receive my healing I'm not going to
[1:38:44] serve god well that is not the right
[1:38:46] attitude the right attitude would be
[1:38:49] whether he heals me or not whether he
[1:38:50] sends me to hell or whatever I still
[1:38:53] want to to praise him I still want to
[1:38:55] serve
[1:38:56] him that should be our attitude so if we
[1:38:59] have an underlying issue in our hearts
[1:39:01] and you have to look and you have to
[1:39:03] look deep and you have to be honest if
[1:39:05] you're not honest with yourself who are
[1:39:07] you going to be honest with that's right
[1:39:09] you have to search yourself yes you have
[1:39:12] to
[1:39:14] search and you have to see if there's
[1:39:16] something in the way only you are going
[1:39:18] to know
[1:39:20] that so I don't know where it went but
[1:39:23] there was a quote that I want to read if
[1:39:24] if if you give me a couple more minutes
[1:39:26] here yes
[1:39:40] sir and the uncomfortable silence is it
[1:39:46] uncomfortable I don't know where it went
[1:39:48] maybe the Lord doesn't want me to read
[1:39:49] it but
[1:39:59] oh here it
[1:40:00] is this is out a question and answers in
[1:40:03] 64 he says when Joshua entered the land
[1:40:05] of Canaan he said don't you let one of
[1:40:07] them live if it's a cute little baby a
[1:40:09] little amalaki or Amorite kill
[1:40:12] it okay he says you remember he'll grow
[1:40:15] up to be an amalaki he'll pollute the
[1:40:17] camp and when those little things come
[1:40:19] back uh like that disagreeing with the
[1:40:21] word of God get rid of that thing I
[1:40:22] don't care what what denomination it
[1:40:24] belongs to he says you say and I'm going
[1:40:27] to say I don't care what message Church
[1:40:28] it belongs to if it's against the word
[1:40:30] it's against the word and you stay away
[1:40:31] from it right so uh just like we said uh
[1:40:36] earlier that all those that say Lord
[1:40:38] Lord you know he's going to say I never
[1:40:40] knew you you know so we can't just say
[1:40:44] that oh I'm a Christian I I should
[1:40:46] receive anything it's it's not always so
[1:40:50] so we want to make sure that we are
[1:40:53] genuine that we are real that we are
[1:40:55] honest that we are sincere within
[1:40:57] ourselves okay so we have to make sure
[1:40:59] that all all that unconfessed sin that
[1:41:02] there is nothing there if you want to
[1:41:04] receive from the Lord you've got to make
[1:41:06] sure that there's nothing that there's
[1:41:08] no root of bitterness there's uh there's
[1:41:10] no uh uh Love of Money there's no uh
[1:41:14] love of lust you know different things
[1:41:16] like that so whatever it is that you see
[1:41:19] the greatest desire that you combat that
[1:41:22] you battle with all the time you have to
[1:41:25] be honest with yourself did I really
[1:41:27] confess this do I have to go make it
[1:41:29] right with somebody
[1:41:30] else am I accepting things that are
[1:41:32] against the word of God am I getting
[1:41:35] into those am I allowing that in my life
[1:41:38] these are the types of things that we
[1:41:40] have to be honest with and he goes on to
[1:41:42] say you say Well they're good I don't
[1:41:44] care how good of people they are if they
[1:41:46] are contrary to that word get that thing
[1:41:48] out of you it's a growing little amalaki
[1:41:51] looks cute looks innocent it looks like
[1:41:53] it's it's all right but don't you have
[1:41:55] anything to do with it you stay away
[1:41:56] from it well brother brandom I go down
[1:41:59] here because well I don't you just
[1:42:00] remember any amalekite anything that
[1:42:03] denies the word stay away from it amen
[1:42:07] have nothing to do with it at all how
[1:42:09] many believes that to be the truth he
[1:42:11] says sure it is see stay away from it if
[1:42:14] it's trying to pull you away from the
[1:42:16] Lord if it's trying to pull you away
[1:42:17] from the word you've got to cut it off
[1:42:20] at the root does it mean you're going to
[1:42:22] lose a friend friendship
[1:42:26] probably at the time you know when I
[1:42:28] gave my heart to the Lord I lost
[1:42:30] friendships but over the years I also
[1:42:33] gained respect and those friendships
[1:42:36] back because they saw that it wasn't
[1:42:39] something something it wasn't a phase
[1:42:41] that I was going through but they saw
[1:42:42] that it was an actual way of life that I
[1:42:44] lived my
[1:42:45] lifeall they saw something they probably
[1:42:49] everybody was expecting me to fail as
[1:42:51] they've seen so many people do before
[1:42:53] well I started going to church and then
[1:42:55] a couple years later you know and that's
[1:42:56] a problem in the church is when you're
[1:42:58] trying to get numbers instead of
[1:43:00] souls
[1:43:03] amen so what Ro what Roots do you need
[1:43:07] to let dig and what Roots do we need to
[1:43:11] cut so if you bow your heads I'd like to
[1:43:13] read this scripture here in Jeremiah
[1:43:17] 17 says thus sayith the Lord cursed be
[1:43:20] the man that trusteth in a man and
[1:43:21] maketh flesh his arm and whose heart
[1:43:24] departeth from the Lord for he shall be
[1:43:26] like the the heath in the
[1:43:28] desert and shall not see what excuse me
[1:43:32] and shall not see when good cometh but
[1:43:35] shall inhabit the parched places in the
[1:43:36] wilderness in a salt land and not
[1:43:39] inhabited blessed is the man that
[1:43:41] trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the
[1:43:43] Lord is for he shall be a tree planted
[1:43:45] By the Waters and that spread out her
[1:43:47] Roots by the river and shall not see
[1:43:49] when heat cometh but her Leaf shall be
[1:43:51] green so no matter what trials no matter
[1:43:54] how hard it gets we our leaves will
[1:43:57] still be green because we are rooted
[1:43:59] into the water
[1:44:01] amen and shall not be careful in the
[1:44:03] year of drought neither shall cease from
[1:44:05] yielding fruit the heart is deceitful
[1:44:07] above all things and desperately wicked
[1:44:10] who can know it I the Lord search the
[1:44:13] heart I try the Reigns even to give
[1:44:15] every man according to his ways
[1:44:17] according to the fruit of his
[1:44:20] doings let's look to the Lord in prayer
[1:44:23] most gracious Heavenly
[1:44:25] Father Giver of Life Giver of every good
[1:44:29] gift Lord as we've been here speaking
[1:44:32] this
[1:44:33] morning sorry that it's been so long but
[1:44:38] Lord just thank you for the word that
[1:44:40] you've given us we thank you for the
[1:44:42] spirit that's been here Lord we've we've
[1:44:45] laughed we've enjoyed hearing the the
[1:44:48] the word we've uh we've been here here
[1:44:53] today but Lord we don't want it to just
[1:44:56] be like any other
[1:44:58] service sometimes it becomes common when
[1:45:01] we come to service Sunday two times on
[1:45:03] Sunday come to service on Wednesday and
[1:45:06] it seems to repeat week after
[1:45:09] week but Lord may we not take that for
[1:45:14] granted just because we're in service it
[1:45:17] seems to repeat we have singing at the
[1:45:20] uh at the beginning we have prayer we we
[1:45:23] have preaching we have more singing and
[1:45:25] it just seems like a repeated thing over
[1:45:26] and over where some people would just
[1:45:28] grow weary from the same thing over and
[1:45:30] over but father I pray that it would not
[1:45:33] be so with this body of Believers here
[1:45:35] that they would not grow weary of
[1:45:37] waiting for your return that they would
[1:45:39] not grow weary coming to church service
[1:45:41] after service singing the songs of
[1:45:43] praise and and giving you glory and
[1:45:45] giving you worship because Lord if
[1:45:47] they're tired of it here they will not
[1:45:49] they will not like it over there when
[1:45:50] we're constantly giving you praise when
[1:45:53] we were constantly giving you worship
[1:45:55] where we were constantly speaking your
[1:45:56] name whatever it might be
[1:45:59] Lord father I pray that you would
[1:46:01] strengthen the hearts of the your people
[1:46:03] here today Lord if there's any
[1:46:05] underlying problems if there's
[1:46:07] unconfessed sin I pray in the name of
[1:46:10] Jesus Christ that it would be brought
[1:46:11] out today that it would hinder the
[1:46:13] people no longer that they would be set
[1:46:15] free today that they can come and
[1:46:18] receive from the spirit today that they
[1:46:20] can come and receive from you as it said
[1:46:24] uh receiving from your spirit that we
[1:46:26] wouldn't Harden our hearts oh God that
[1:46:28] we when we hear your word that we would
[1:46:30] not Harden our hearts but Lord that we
[1:46:32] would open our hearts to receive more of
[1:46:34] you to be rooted that we would be
[1:46:36] grounded that we'd be established more
[1:46:39] in you oh Father receiving more and more
[1:46:41] Revelation having a better character
[1:46:44] that you would be pleased with having a
[1:46:46] better a closer relationship with you
[1:46:48] being renewed in your spirit being
[1:46:50] revived in our spirit
[1:46:54] being renewed in our Christian walk help
[1:46:57] us today Lord to shed those things the
[1:47:00] the weight that this so easily beset us
[1:47:02] but father help this day to be a mark in
[1:47:04] our lives that we just say I forget the
[1:47:06] things in the past I want to start
[1:47:08] things a new because even even the breth
[1:47:10] in the scripture said that I renew
[1:47:12] myself my mind is renewed day by day and
[1:47:15] we understand that your mercies are new
[1:47:17] every day oh God so Lord what happened
[1:47:20] yesterday what happened last week
[1:47:21] whatever happened last month whatever
[1:47:23] happened last year 5 years ago 10 years
[1:47:26] ago 20 years ago whatever it might be I
[1:47:28] just want to put an end to that right
[1:47:30] now I don't want the accuser of the
[1:47:32] Brethren coming bothering me with it
[1:47:33] anymore but Lord I want to confess these
[1:47:35] things right now before you I want a
[1:47:37] true repentance to come before you oh
[1:47:39] God that I that any person here that
[1:47:42] they could be delivered that there would
[1:47:43] be nothing hindering them in their lives
[1:47:45] whether it's sickness whether it's a
[1:47:47] despair whether it's a sorrow whether
[1:47:49] it's uh uh not being able to understand
[1:47:51] your word whatever the the situation
[1:47:53] might be Lord I pray that you would move
[1:47:55] upon the person today that they can have
[1:47:57] that Deliverance oh Father Lord whether

[1:48:23] Gile within us truth means that there's
[1:48:25] that that there's no root of bitterness
