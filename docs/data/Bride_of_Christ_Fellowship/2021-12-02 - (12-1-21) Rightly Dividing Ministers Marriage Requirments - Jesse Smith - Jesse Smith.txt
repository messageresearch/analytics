as he's in quarantine there by god's grace we'll lift him up in prayer today brother amen he said he texted me and said i'm very sick so let's just pray for brother amen tonight that god will give him a healing touch by the grace of the lord that's all i said he didn't give me any details but we don't need them because god knows all things let's lift up our precious brother you know he labors for us so much you know let's ask god to give him a healing touch tonight by the grace of the lord also my my childhood pastor's wife has covered and uh she's got to be in her 50s if not 60s my mom just

glory and gave us [Music] you and down from me glory and gave us [Music] and gave us [Music] let's go to second timothy two second timothy two verse fifteen i'm gonna text my wife real quick i'm going to ask her how does the mic alone sound now i'd like to do a little different topic here tonight by god's grace i've been studying this week and been in contact with a few people not from our church but i'd like to look at rightly dividing ministers marriage requirements i've been studying on that i'm going to make i'm actually in the process of editing the video so i've been kind of studying on that lately and i'd like to go over this i think it's really going to be helpful for our church and then anyone else you know there's numerous people who have contacted me preachers even and pastors from i mean just a few but from all around the world and they they kind of ask me these questions and so i want to just look at it so i want to try to uh address this here tonight by god's grace i think it'll be a blessing so my wife says the volume is uh very quiet except when i'm very loud so i'll try to maybe just hold us a little closer here i'm sorry if i'm blasting everybody i don't want to do that but and then we have you know we have some people at church i've allowed them now to just call our church home our church their home church but they don't live in the u.s they don't have a home church so i just said please watch every service and then i'm going to try to reach out to them every week with a email see how they're doing i mean they've asked me numerous times i just said well okay let's try this see how it goes if you don't have a pastor you know we will be free we'll try to feed their souls by the grace of god so we'll try to do that that's why some of these topics i believe will be important for those who maybe have never heard this subject before um so i i've never preached it live i preached it one time in 2016 in the other sanctuary there but i didn't make it i didn't make it public well i'm going to make this one public of course and then i'm going to make a video on it because i believe it'll help especially preachers if they can really get a grasp on this i believe it'll help them and especially the young people if the lord tarries they're going to grow up they're going to hear all kinds of questions about different message churches why do some believe this why do some believe that and it needs to be answered uh i i think a lot of people uh a lot of churches maybe do a disservice when they don't answer questions that's what i personally believe i'm a very inquisitive person you know so when when these people left the message you know in 2012 i wouldn't know why why would you leave the mess this has been heaven to me i didn't know the message i came into it it's been heaven to me why would somebody leave it well as i started studying that well then i could have an understanding of why people might have questions or why they would uh maybe not understand a subject i still don't think it was reason to leave but anyways let's look at this topic here i know i'm doing a lot of talking here let's get right to the word of god here so my wife says we'll have to keep it right up here so i'll try not to speak too loud here but i can't promise anything you know there's there's times and you know how it is times and seasons second timothy 2 15. let's read this together ready one two three study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth praise god now let's go to leviticus 21 if we could leviticus 21 this is the verse brother branham uses about ministers marriage requirements in 1965 marriage and divorce february verse 7 and we'll read verse 9. these are of course mature verses here and you know when young people have questions i always try to just answer it as generally as possible and then say if you still don't understand it just wait a few years when you're older i'll address it then when you're older or parents can address it whenever they want because they're the parents but for me if i'm teaching someone else's children then i always say that you know this is as far as i can explain it and then as you mature we'll revisit this again but some of the some of these things aren't important for children to understand yet the main thing is get them saved praise god main thing is i know they're a sinner and the blood of jesus christ can remit all their sins away and get baptized and be saved by the grace of god that's the most important thing leviticus 21 7. you don't have to read it with me i'll read it but verse 7 they shall not take a wife that is a or profane neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband for he is holy unto his god verse 9 and the daughter of any priest if she profane herself by playing the she profaneth her father she shall be burnt with fire that's quite a serious scripture right that's quite a scary scripture verse 13 and he shall take a wife and her virginity now of course is speaking of the high priest now a widow or divorced woman or profane or in harlot these shall he not take but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife all right let's bow our heads let's have a word of prayer here heavenly father god we just thank you for your grace and mercy we just ask god that you anoint me god to preach your truth which i believe as a workman i've studied myself approved unto you lord rightly dividing the truth by your holy spirit i pray you'd help me lord god to stay with thy truth lord god and i pray god you'll bless your people here tonight lord and those that are live-streaming god i just pray a special understanding for them may they just silence any phones they have lord or any other any other distractions and may they just focus right into the holy spirit under the atmosphere of the anointing of god in jesus name lord to give them the spirit of truth and so father we'll be happy to give you thanks and praise in jesus christ's name and everybody said amen praise god so i'm going to text my wife and say at any time if it gets quiet let me know all right so we'll start here and i will try to do you know 45 minutes this might be a two-parter maybe i'll finish this on sunday and remember also sunday we'll do a 10 a.m service so we'll try that and uh i like to i like to be flexible and if the people you know it seemed like numerous people wanted an earlier service you know i'm happy to do that like i said you know i just hope i know you'll be flexible with me too i think there'll be times and seasons where i want to have a later service again so i can go visit some churches and stick my face in there and say how you doing god bless you would your pastor like to have my books about the message you know so so i want to do that by the grace of the lord all right so um this is not going to work good here so in case you just go back to the scripture okay it's not really going to be good for me to show that because i'm kind of referencing two documents okay i'm referencing a document i made and then another one that has kind of more quotes on it and i'm sorry let me blow my nose for you i just had a runny nose all day today thank you so sorry about that okay so let's look here uh so my my title is rightly dividing ministers marriage requirements now this is a course a very personal subject right that's why i've never put it publicly but i kind of feel like this is the time i've talked to numerous brothers over the last week or so and i just feel like it would help a lot of people so i think it's worth putting out there and i think it'll be a help to people by god's grace so the question comes after you listen to brother brahms sermon marriage and divorce the question is are new testament ministers or preachers required to marry virgins that's the question okay and for many of the years of somebody say this as a minister i just thought it was that way for many years i never really studied it i always had a lot of questions you know my friends and i are in the message always had questions we couldn't quite understand it but we always just said okay it's on tape i'll just believe it but as time goes on i find so many other doctrines that i have questions about and i find so many opinions of brother branham's and just uh huma that we he calls it the human side i find so many of those that i start studying it more and i look at it from a more mature perspective uh so after all these years i think i came to the conclusion around 2016 um that i i no longer thought that was scriptural so i thought that was just brother branham's opinion now so now i would say i believe the bible-based answer is no a new testament minister is not required to marry a virgin okay and i have at least six reasons why but i kind of want to background a little bit so you can see the understanding on it and i'm sure you know people will no doubt no doubt disagree right away they'll say who are you to correct god's prophet and my response would be to that uh would be every prophet needs their human side corrected every prophet male or female needs their human side corrected the divine side is the only part that doesn't need corrected okay so that's my answer and that's what brother branham said and he cares do you care for me 1963 and lord willing we'll get to that let me just briefly reference it church before months before that sermon brother branham preached over the pulpit that martin luther king jr was going to lead millions into a death trap into a revolutionary war over school segregation and i could show you the quote later maybe i wanted to try to play it later on if i could brother branham says now remember it's on tape so brother bam lets them know he thinks there is going to be a revolutionary war because of this in the south and he says remember this is on tape well a few months later they asked him was that a prophecy and brother brahm says no he says i have nothing on it from from the lord that's just my opinion so what do we learn we learn people can be very opinionated and the church said you can be very opinionated right you can have strong opinions i can be very opinionated right and i try to i know i'm not perfect i know you're not perfect either but we try to when we're opinionated we try to let us let people know that's just our opinion okay for example i put that on my joseph branham video i don't believe he's a prophet in my opinion so a joseph branham guy emailed me this week and said well yeah you're right that's just your opinion you're wrong i think i'm right but that's my opinion but i try to be humble enough where that shows perhaps that guy wasn't very humble but i try to be humble enough to say that i stand to be corrected and that's why i say that i want i invite people to try to correct me to see if they have anything i don't know because if they have something i don't know i want to know it and then i can grow as a christian but if i just shut everybody off and say i'm not open to correction i'm not open to any other opinions which many people act like even though they don't say it right then they they fail to grow as a christian if they're wrong because nobody has everything right only jesus christ has everything right so let me just preface it with that who are you to correct god's prophet well i'm going to make another video and show how lots of people corrected brother branham i have a whole list of people that corrected brother branham including his wife brother neville uh brother sherrod there's so many people that corrected brother branham and he accepted it he said i always make time because i want to be right praise god and so what i found is that that statement who are you who corrects god's prophet it's usually just a cover for i'm too lazy to go study the scripture myself or i'm afraid to have a different opinion than brother branham about a topic that's a minor does everybody know there's majors and minors how many look it up there's there's scores of quotes another man talks about the difference between a major doctrine and a minor doctrine what does he say church what does he say the majors are salvation and the baptism of the holy ghost those are majors right he says he said other things like the coming of the lord are minors he actually says that in a quote so um now i would go as far as saying this i believe marriage and divorce about being married one time is a major but i believe this subject of a marriage requirement for a minister is a minor because we don't find brother branham's opinion in the word of god in the new testament okay and i know there's lots of questions on that we'll try to get to that by the grace of god but you know people say oh you don't believe the message i've given my whole life to this message i've left everything for this message i've been rejected by my family kicked out all my friends at college no one ever contacts me all because of this message if i would if i wanted to be popular i would have never come in the message i came in the message because i saw much truth in it praise god but when you come to any man or any woman you're going to have a human side that's not divine and god is going to allow them to make mistakes god's going to allow them to be human so we all can learn and grow in church we're going to find out that when there's a question someone who's really born again will seek god for the answer they won't just say well i'll take brother braham's word rather than searching it out well that's really not an honest approach if you believe god's infinite and god's eternal and god's still revealing truth then you would have a hungry heart you'd hunger and thirst for righteousness and you'd seek god for an answer on a question you had it's but it's easier it's lazier just to say i'm just going to take what the tape said well what if the tape has something different on the contrary side which this subject does there's a quote where brother bam is talking to a woman she's a former prostitute and drug addict and brother brahm says don't you want to be free from that he said you'd make a really good wife for a tire little preacher of gods a prostitute now prostitute now does that sound familiar like rahab that god can forgive a prostitute and bring her into a a holy marriage like he did with rahab right so you have quotes on both sides but let me say again brother rahm only preached this in one sermon he never preached this sermon before or after that's one of the the main points i need to make i just want to state that so you got it at the beginnings because i'm sure some people listen for five minutes okay i'm done with this guy he's a blasphemer he's a heretic and they won't even consider these other things see that shows they're in a they're in a complacent lukewarm state when you can't even receive when you're afraid to hear anything outside of what you believe then you don't have the spirit of truth you have the spirit of fear because if you've got the truth church you can stand there like a rock of ages amen i know the truth i've studied i got the word of god i know what's right praise god so see people like that well there's really nothing you can do to help them other than pray and show them the love of god brother bram said they have to know you love them first so that's why i got this smile on my face i love all my doubters or haters you know i love all of them all the spies that spy for the other side you know i love all them and i'm not afraid of what i believe because i've studied it myself and i know what i believe i do want to say of course i respect both sides i respect the side that upholds this teaching but i respect the side that doesn't uphold this teaching and i found a lot of preachers don't uphold it but they're scared to talk about it because they're going to get rejected by their other message preacher friends who are more popular and have more influence and so i don't want to live like that i'm glad i don't have to live like that i don't have to live by the spirit of fear i'm going to live by the spirit of faith praise god because i don't care who rejects me or not all i know all i care is about jesus accepts me praise god and i know he has amen hallelujah because i i was there when it happened praise god hallelujah and i can't see from the bible how the new testament requires ministers to marry virgins so i feel this statement my brother brand was his opinion it's not a major it's a minor now consider there's numerous examples of brother branham's doctrines and opinions changing or just being wrong because he was human let's do four real quick four doctrines that were changed were the godhead went from three persons he said he said oh third person how we love you and how we want you to burn in our hearts how you're burning in our hearts tonight third person the trinity and later a year later he condemns it and says it's thus saith the lord it's of the devil okay so there he is he's growing in his doctrine he's praying and thinking he's praying to the third person inside of him and later he calls that idea of the devil the baptism of the holy spirit brother man believed the baptism of the spirit and the filling were two different things he believed that for many years up to 1963 after that now he believes they're one and the same he puts it in print in the church age book where he says the filling and the baptism the ceiling are all one and the same that's a major too right third man's three parts brother branham changes on this back and forth i found today first he said the soul was the most innermost being and then he said in 1962 the spirit was the innermost being and then he goes at the end and now he says back to soul at the end of his ministry so he went just back forth back and forth that's how daniel 70 weeks is too he goes sometimes he says it's christ was crucified in 33 a.d sometimes he says 30 a.d sometimes he says there's a week there's seven years left for the tribulation sometimes he says there's three and a half years left and that's okay is that related to salvation no it's related to the future right man three parts is that really related to salvation no because uh whether you understand that or not uh you can still repent of your sins and be saved by jesus christ okay um and last fourthly brother brahm said the white horse rider was the holy spirit i think on at least three occasions in the in the first seal and then in 1963 and from then on he knows it's the antichrist spirit with thus saith the lord that's a total 180 right from satan i'm sorry from god to satan it's a total 180. so those are just four others there's many more doctrines you could go with to show that but those are just four and so brother brahm could be wrong about the godhead and grow that no doubt he could be wrong about this minister's requirement as well but again it's not related to salvation it's a minor now here's four opinions that we know were either wrong or he changed in 1951 brother branham said billy paul was his promise joseph sarah the baby he thought would be joseph wasn't a boy it's a girl and he loves her with all of his heart well four years later in 1955 they had joseph okay so that that opinion changed right but he never addressed it brother i'm just going to let it go and he kind of went on we never hear him addressing it on the tape 19 or a second one is brother i believe the usa would be totally annihilated with only tree stumps left by 1977. karen lived through that she saw that dolores they saw it many people went on spending sprees to live it up before jesus came lots of people did a lot of bad things uh before 77 thinking they could live it up before the end and it came and went so we know that opinion was not right the third one uh brother brahms said in 1964 he said there's so much mental retardation in arizona's public schools he said we can't have another generation and here we are we're 50 almost 57 years we've had another generation i don't know for sure but i think brother brown does have great grandchildren if not i know he has grandchildren for sure i don't know does he have great i will have to ask that later maybe he has great great so we've had you know generation afterwards and fourth that what i mentioned brother brandon said martin luther king jr would lead millions to the death trap in a revolutionary war battle but then he said months later i could be altogether wrong in my opinion about martin luther king jr so i just showed you four doctrines by the ram change which were important ones right godhead three parts of man uh baptism holy ghost the seals very important right that's part of the fulfilling the the revelation 10 7 finishing the mystery of god and then four important opinions that we saw were either wrong he admitted or didn't admit them but we can look now and see well those were just his human opinions all right now i want to state this one reason message believers cling to this minister's marriage requirement so much is because at the end of the sermon brother branham said his sermon was thus saith the lord all the way through and let me just caution our friends we have to be very careful how we interpret every thus saith the lord okay very careful because brother branham said thus saith the lord it will be about the brown bear but he didn't shoot it right now all that happened with the brown bear he did see the brown bear he just didn't shoot it i'm sorry they saw the brown bear he didn't see it but the brown bear was there so he never said thus saith the lord i'll shoot it but he just said thus saith the lord it will be and all the part that god did was but then brother branham failed the vision just like people can fail the vision of acts 2 38. just like joshua there were people in joshua's generation not joshua but there was people in joshua's generation that failed the vision and they didn't drive out all the canaanites right just like saul king saul failed the vision he didn't obey samuel's vision so the kingdom of god was taken from him i'm sorry the the the kingdom of israel was taken from him sorry and so samuel said you would have ruled forever had you just obeyed the vision amen so there's so much different now with brother branham because we have all these audio recordings of him we have no other prophet like that not martin luther or of course he had the gift of prophecy but he wasn't a prophet john wesley paul we don't have their human side so much and so we've really got to be careful as we listen to brother branham and the other example is brother brahm said i don't care if a woman shouts screams speaks in tongues if she cuts her hair she's dead thus saith the lord first corinthians 14 well that's the wrong chapter so there's one breath between thus saith the lord in first corinthians 14 and brother branham flipped from his divine side to his human side in that one breath so that's why we got to be very careful how we listen to every thus at the lord's statement because hair is not in first corinthians 14 hairs in first corinthians 11. but see a lot of people don't study these things maybe they don't hear them maybe they never heard it before so that's why i'm giving the background and if malachi raises up and you know sometimes let's say time goes on god takes me off the scene people got to know how to rightly divide the word of truth right because we don't know how long we're going to be here did brother rams or did all those people following brother brown think we'd be here in 2021 absolutely not we may be here in 2041. we mean we may be here in 2061. we don't know but we want to be faithful and we want to rightly divide the truth while we're here praise god because the danger with this is if if it's applied wrong it becomes legalism where men glory in their flesh or women glory in their flesh rather than glory in the cross of jesus christ that's the danger and that's what i've seen i've seen at least two ministers major on this they major on this and one of them uh he majored on it and he allowed cutting hair makeup and now he's out of the message all he does is attack brother branham now and some of his children don't even believe in god anymore and i know that because i've heard it on the podcast because it was he must have presented the wrong way he must have been presenting william branham instead of jesus christ right so his children never got a real experience with god but we're not going to do that here we're going to present jesus christ first amen yes he had a servant named william branham yes he had a server named john the baptist but we give more honor we give all the worship jesus christ is the one increasing here praise god and of course we read brother bam's quotes we thank god for our prophet we i got the church age books out there the seven seals books all those things but jesus christ is the one increasing that's the one the children need to know most amen brother braham said i may not do it i may not live to see it he said but jesus or this message will introduce jesus christ to the world in other words brother am is not going to be the one introducing the message to the world because he's going to go off the scene so we need somebody else to introduce the message it's living preachers preachers that believe the word of god are sisters with a testimony amen right brothers with a testimony young men not preachers maybe but with a testimony you and i witnessing about jesus christ and then they get to hear what god's done in the past generation praise god because it's no longer in this generation it was a past generation but now we're taking up the mantle by the grace of god okay so brother bram says thus saith the lord all the way through now church if you remember brother ram said the same thing about the church ages and the seven seals at the end of the seals in the seventh seal sermon does anyone remember that he said he said the church ages plus the history plus the seals he says to the best of my ability it's thus saith the lord that's what he says but if you go back and listen were there mistakes on those tapes yes there were some mistakes he said 700 instead of seven thousand okay he also changed the years he said the the ephesian i'm sorry the laodicean church a started in 1900 well then he changed it to 1906. right there's there's numerous things that were changed he didn't mean every word was thus saith the lord he meant the revelations that were backed by the bible those were thus saith the lord and so it is with the marriage and divorce sermon not every word in there is thus saith the lord and the proof is about jacob brother bram said jacob had at least 12 wives but he only had four we'll look at those scriptures later okay so you have to be very careful how we listen to god's prophet because there's the human side now imagine the prophets that wrote the bible amen the church did you ever think about that how long did isaiah have to write to write 66 and listen church not miss one word think about the anointing you'd have to be under co could you and i even write one paragraph and not make a mistake with the word of god it'd be very very hard right because we're not prophets we couldn't do it so see brother ram was not like a writing bible prophet where they got they had to make sure every single word was exactly thus saith the lord now some people might argue the pickup in pen section now that might be i'd have to study more on that but brother brahms every sermon was not that way at brother ham's every sermon was not a chapter in the bible a lot of it was his human understanding right it's human emotion just like brother bram said uh i prayed for billy paul to be fully a prophet did you know that's a quote brother man said i pray billy paul is going to fully be a prophet is he fully a prophet no but brother man prayed and brother man prayed let rebecca lord take my place someday did that happen did rebecca take brother man's place no not in any fashion that i can see so there's so much of it is the human side he says i've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to okay all right so let's just start here let's just go to that jacob one okay go to since i'm already on it here go to genesis 31 and kesha this is where you can put it up there 31 47. i'm gonna need some readers here genesis my voice is definitely shot here but it's better than uh sunday and monday it's malcolm why don't you start from me buddy uh genesis 31 read verses 47 to 55 31 47-55 oh okay thank you sir look jacob swears he makes an oath to god and said i won't marry any other women than your two daughters and then they're concubines so there's no way and if you there's other scriptures too we're not going to read them but for those listening genesis 32 22 genesis 35 22-26 and genesis 46 verses 5-27 show jacob's twelve sons by these four wives and there's no other counts of jacob having at least a dozen wives okay so there's your proof that that statement doesn't mean in marriage and divorce it doesn't mean every word in the sermon was thus saith the lord there's your proof he swears by the living god now if you swear by the living god and then break that then you're in big trouble right so again i offer a friendly challenge can anybody show me where jacob had at least 12 wives at least now that could mean there's 13 14 20 30 40. i know gideon had a lot of wives can anybody show me that in all the years i've shared this with numerous ministers sister and all the years none of them can say one thing against these points that proved it to me along with my own study in god's presence and praying i remember i fasted and prayed to understand this subject i don't know anyone else that's done that no no doubt there probably could be but i have laid on my face praying asking god let me understand this subject and this is where the holy ghost has directed me right to the word okay so i offer that humble challenge and i also say this i don't have any personal agenda on this my wife and i both met the purity requirements when we were married in 2003 by god's grace so this is not a personal vendetta i'm trying to get back at the preachers that don't like me because i don't meet their requirements no i meet their requirements although i don't agree with their requirements because i don't believe it's in the new testament praise god i don't mind saying that because i don't i don't i'm going to stand before god right i want to stand there as an honest man right now there's at least 20 requirements just to be a minister in the new testament there's at least 20 there could be more one of them is related to marriage and that is he's the husband of one wife that's all it says doesn't say anything about a virgin either side male female it just says husband and one wife and brother branham and the bible interprets that for us because adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of god any man preaching with a living spouse who's not his current wife that's adultery that man's disqualified and that would disqualify a lot of men preachers and women preachers if they actually believe the bible okay so let me go over this real briefly there's 20 requirements at least 15 of them are in first timothy three one to seven he's got to be blameless husband and one wife vigilant sober good behavior hospitality given to hospitality rather apt to teach not giving to wine no striker he's not quarrelsome he's not greedy or filthy luker he's patient covetous i'm sorry not covetous rather yeah i'm not covered just sorry not covetous ruling well his own house not a novice and he must have a good rapport of them without there's 15. now there's five more he must be born again brother man tells us you must have a burning bush experience 16. you must be called by god right you gotta have a calling 18 there's three more in the church age book power of spoken and written word i've seen that with my book and i've also spoken to mountains of obstacles and god has moved those mountains i've seen that in my ministry the power of the written word i've written all these brothers about this subject and no one's ever been able to show how it's wrong again that's the power of the written word 19 you've got to have fruit of your ministry the people that are saved and strengthened under your ministry and then six you got to be completely true to the word of god there's 20 requirements to be a preacher one of them is about your marriage it's the husband of one wife okay hopefully that's true and again i'm open to all the correction okay let's go through the six reasons why i believe this doctrine is not scriptural first of all it's based on only one quote there's no quotes before no quotes after let me briefly read the quote uh where brother branham talks about this well first first here let me read the quote from marriage and divorce now brother says now let us in view of these vindicated truths of god search a little further if you want to now this may hurt just a little bit i'm going to skip ahead a little bit there's no minister that can marry a widow do you know that you wanted to read that all right it's he said leviticus 21 7 and ezekiel 44 22 it will show you that the priesthood was not to be was not to marry a woman that's been touched by a man this type is of the virgin bride of jesus christ because they handled the fire of god the priesthood aaron's sons we haven't got time to read it and get out by noon we got 20 minutes yet and them as aaron sons them handled the fire of god so they could not marry a woman that's been touched by another man the unchanging god said so now look at some of these words in here these are really strong powerful words right there's the unchanging god said so but it's not thus saith the lord brother branham church also said the holy spirit i heard the holy spirit say joseph thou art a prophet now you show me any proof no one's been ever been able to show me any proof that man's a prophet but yeah brother brother brahm thought the spirit of god told him that but brother adam also thought the spirit of god gave that woman that dream that showed he was going to be shot upon and die going into a meeting to preach some series of services but the man said the spirit said not now but yet later okay so church we do the same thing sometimes we say we think the holy spirit told us something or and turns out it wasn't that way sometimes we say god did this god did that and turns out it wasn't that way i was just thinking about maybe one i could share here um oh i'm just gonna say this there's a brother in a church that was and i haven't shared this with him i forgot to share it but i'm going to share it with him on sunday hopefully he's watching there's a brother in our church now i was preaching at my house during coven last year and this white thing come up in front of the camera and the brother text me and thought it was the holy spirit well i didn't know what it was it's just this white thing it looked like it was looked like it was something strange well a couple weeks later i was at the house i was in my room and i was i was making the bed from helping my wife and i saw those white things it was a feather for my pillow so there's a wonderful brother in our church and i forgot to tell him that so i'm sorry brother he thought it was the holy spirit but i saw the same thing later it was a feather for my pillow so that's just one simple example right where we we think it's something out of the ordinary we think it's something different it must be god and i didn't know i thought it was god at first i agree with the brother i said praise the lord maybe it's a dove it turned out to be a feather of a bird close but not the dub we were talking about but it looked like that it looked like a fly and the brother set me in slo-mo it looked like a flying bird but it was a feather so we got to be very careful and remember brother man said the unchanging god said so but he also said remember i'm on tape martin luther is going to lead millions into a death trap can you imagine saying that on tape come back and later said i had nothing on the lord from that i nothing on the lord from that he said that's just my opinion see what do we have we have humans who are very strong willed strong opinions and that's fine as long as they're led by the holy spirit with the grace of god to know sometimes they have their own human side and that side may not be god's side or may not line up with god's side i should say now brother brandt mentioned this he later in the sermon he said a priest could only marry a woman that was a virgin now that was true then he says but a priest could not do that because he had he had touched or got a woman to be his wife that was already been some man's wife so that shows the vergency of the church of the lord jesus christ the bride we have to be unadulterated the word not one word missing nowhere now i counted the church brother ma'am spent two minutes and 14 seconds talking about this subject i believe it was over two hours sermon if i'm not mistaken that is a very short time to speak on a subject and then all these people around the world make it a thus saith the lord legalistic doctrine and don't even question it and he even said in there i don't have time to read it he didn't even have time to address it fully okay now church one more thing about that quote a priest could marry a widow if it was the widow of another priest but brother brahm didn't say that so brother brahm left out part of that scripture so even the quote brother branham has a human heir of leaving out part of the scripture he said there's no minister that can marry a widow well that's not true let's read it ezekiel 44 22 it wasn't fully the truth just like the 1977 prediction just wasn't fully the truth it was his own human opinion just like billy paul being his promised joseph that was his own human opinion he thought it was true right he did the best he could ezekiel 44 22. neither shall they take for their wives a widow nor her that is put away but they shall take maidens of the seat of the house of israel or a widow that had a priest before that's the key statement church that's the key statement right there because brother branham said there's no minister that can marry widow well the bible said they could if it was a widow of another priest everybody understand so in other words brother man's quote was incomplete he left this truth out of his quote okay so that's one thing i caught on right away too oh what about that this shows brother man was giving his human side in my humble opinion okay now let me say this church not for everybody but there's some people if you're not born again there's been numerous message ministers that have listened to marriage and divorce and thought brother branham supported polygamy in that sermon brother branham didn't support polygamy in the way they're thinking but if a person is not born again and i know i know people personally that have had this problem people will listen to that sermon and think brother man says it's okay to do polygamy it's not what brother brahm is saying is that the man is the only one who could have a living spouse divorced and married to another if she didn't confess her fornication when they got married but that's very few people it happens to very few people at all it's very rare in the world and the example was joseph and mary joseph thought she'd had fornication unconfessed so she could have or he was thinking about putting her away and get another because it was a un it was an untrue vow it's a false vow but then the holy spirit came down and show joseph the proof praise god or the truth of it okay does that make sense by god's grace that's the only case so that's the only polygamy that would be allowed but that man would still have just one wife that first wife that was put away she couldn't marry again and that man could have no other wives but people that are not born again in countries all over even in america countries all over the world they think that means a man can marry as many women as he wants that's a lie that's from hell but if you're not born again and you don't rightly divide every quote you could come up with that because you're not born again and you've got evil habits you've got evil spirits on you like we preached on on sunday praise god now i hope that's clear i hope everybody can see that by god's grace and like i said if the lord tarries the children got to know this i want them to know this okay now the quote where brother graham is on the other side is from that time 1961 brother man went to a catholic insane institution and he said i talked to a woman and said and she said i started right back drinking and prostitution again and brother bam said you're a beautiful girl you'd make a real sweet heart for some tired little preacher i'm sorry little tired preacher of god's in 1961 praise god four years before marriage and divorce was preached even then he saw how a woman that was immoral physically glory could be forgiven by the blood of jesus christ and develop such a character she could be a wife of a minister amen and the holy spirit didn't correct him at that point because i believe it was right that's what i believe because there's like i said there's six reasons i only got to i'm only on number one right now so that's the quote if people want to look it up well see now look church you got quotes on both sides so which one you gonna take well normally they'll take the marriage and divorce one because it's later but when you go to the scripture you don't find that requirement in the new testament well if that's the case what about deacons because it's not said that about deacons in the new testament either the word virgin is used 14 times in the new testament it's never mentioned in relation to any office in the church it's not even no office all it says is that god would that you would be all sanctified and abstained from fornication that's the perfect will of god god wants everybody to do that but of course not everybody's going to do that but god can still remember in first corinthians 6 the bible said such were some of you you were fornicators adulterers he said such were some of you but now you're washed you're sanctified you're justified by the spirit of the lord god in other words jesus christ blood washes away the stains from your fornication or your adultery or your even homosexuality god washes that away and you become white by in by the blood of jesus christ amen so that's the first reason second reason first reason there's only one quote and you have quotes on both sides second no new testament scripture teaches this doctrine and brother brahm said every doctrine must be genesis the revelation he said or it's not a solid doctrine okay that's a very short one because i've already covered most of that there's 20 new testament requirements for a minister at least and the only one says husband of one wife number three church the levitical priesthood was forever changed so have you got hebrews 7 hebrews 7 11 and 12. verse 11 if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of melchizedek cannot be called after the order of aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law amen so see we're no longer under the aaronic priesthood in fact in the church age book brother branson said be careful of the deeds of nicolaians they're going to bring you back under an aaronic priesthood so that's what i believe the ministers that have made this subject marine version such a legalistic thing they've made themselves another law a man-made law when i forgot to tell you the other preacher that used to really emphasize this well he still does he's still a preacher he's the one in minnesota i was telling you about he's the only one that's ever interrupted me in 17 years of preaching he stood up and said you better be careful preaching that i said sir just give me a moment take a seat and listen please listen to the word of god when i was preaching this very subject in iowa now the preacher is not from iowa where the preachers from minnesota and he still lives in minnesota and i sent him a letter asking all these questions never wrote me back that's what it is they're too scared they're no they don't have the depths of the word of god to even answer a simple question because they're scared god's not scared the bible said be always ready to give an answer for the hope that you have within you praise god always have an answer ready and none of these preachers that i've talked about this none of them have ever been able to show anything against this so that proves again to me that the spirit of truth has directed me to the word of god now if the levitical priesthood has changed then we can't take every word in leviticus 21 as required in the new testament because especially it's verse uh let's see church in verse leviticus 21 what's the verse here let me i'm sorry i skipped it in leviticus 21 verses 18 through 21 the bible said a man can't be a priest if he has a blemish in his eye who had a blemish in his eye in the new testament that was a very important preacher so if you apply that one about marriage why don't you apply the one about the eyes if you do paul is now disqualified well who do we got then who who's the first church age messenger is he even saved you know if if he doesn't meet the requirements of the medical priesthood earlier in the chapter church the bible says in verse 5 and 6 leviticus 21 5-6 if a man makes himself bald he's disqualified what about the preachers that shave their heads how are they going to be a minister if they shave their head the bible said if you make baldness you're disqualified for being a preacher in the old testament so how far do you take it the truth is we're not under the levitical priesthood we're under the priesthood of jesus christ after the order melchizedek all right i'm going to try to keep going here finish up because most of these churches i'm sure you've heard me preach over the years but it's been a long time it's been five years since i preached it um the priesthood is now changed the priesthood has now changed if if you hold up one of them why don't you hold the other ones then paul will be disqualified the fourth reason there's my 45 minutes the fourth reason is there's an obvious double standard against sisters in this doctrine most people only require the sisters to be virgin but the bible said men had to be virgin too because the type brother gives us the type it's christ and the church was christ a whoremonger was christ a fornicator no but i know numerous preachers in the message the men were fornicators but allowed to preach as long as they married a virgin woman that's hypocrisy that's a double standard that doesn't meet the word the very word they say they believe so it's an obvious double standard that targets sisters and it glorifies the flesh of the men right and glorifies the flesh of the sister too it actually forgets the flesh of the men and just focuses glorifying the flesh of the sister now we don't have time to read these but deuteronomy 22 28-30 a man that laid with a woman had to marry her in other words any man that knew a woman could not put her away and marry somebody else he instantly had to marry her in other words he gave that woman his virgin urgency or whatever more virginity and he had to marry that woman so that proves any common jewish man or any priest the woman they knew the first woman they knew they had to marry that person in other words god wanted all jewish men not just priests and high priests all jewish men had to marry the first woman that they knew it just wasn't priests it was all jewish men hallelujah that's deuteronomy 22 28 through 30. also you see the same thing it was death to lay with another man's wife or death to rape a woman if the man just wanted to lay with her then leave he'd be stoned because god said you gotta marry the first one you're with deuteronomy 22 verses 22 through 27. i challenge anybody read that see if it's not right and then levitical the high priest leviticus 21 15 the high priest could not profane their seed okay so there's four does these sound pretty good so far sound pretty biblical do i have scriptures to back them all up yes i do do i have quotes to back them up yes i do number five this is ultimately legalism i'm sorry not always some people make this legalistic which ultimately glorifies the flesh and i already hit on this earlier so i'm not going to spend much time on this i believe this was brother branham's opinion it was men not brother brand brother man didn't make this a legalistic thing men made it a legalistic thing after brother man went off the scene brother bram never preaches after he preached at one time he never made a legalistic thing yeah and i'm i keep getting back to that minnesota brother he's the one that's broken up marriages and then allow people to marry in the church he split churches he does all kinds of evil things he's the one that put on plays he lets him wear makeup i mean it's just it's awful he's one that says you got to contact me before you purchase the car or do anything at all i i choose who you marry it's in america and this is his main thing his main thing is ministers must marry virgin that's his main doctrine and he's the only one that's ever tried to interrupt the holy spirit preaching through me in all these years of preaching 17 years the only one that would do it paul said in galatians 6 13 men brought in circumcision to keep the law that they made glory in your flesh and that's exactly what's happened with this doctrine not circumcision but they're bringing in this doctrine some people are not all they're making it such a huge issue it glo people they're spreading it to try to glory in their flesh because again it's not fair to the uh it's not fair to the sisters they only require the brothers to do it what about this i'm sorry the only cries of the sisters would be virgin not the brothers what about the brothers that proves it's a legalistic idea because you don't find it in the word of god all right sixth and lastly to me this is the most beautiful one here the sixth reason is that the blood of jesus christ washes away all sexual sin i've been hitting on this earlier for his spiritual bride now look at this for a moment how many bride members we got here that love jesus christ and look at this the blood of jesus christ has forgiven you of any natural physical sexual sin and his blood has so washed that away he can still call you a spiritual virgin and even though you've been handled by a man or a woman i'll say it like that for all the men watching if you've been handled by another man or woman jesus christ will still forgive you of that spiritually and you'll just be handled by him for all eternity not only that but we've all been handled by a man's system or the law paul says go to romans 7. i'll prove it to you romans 7 in other words you were all married to someone before christ either the world or the law so in other words everybody's been handled spiritually by some man a man's system or just your own fleshly desires but jesus christ forgives your natural fornications he forgives that still calls you a spiritual virgin now you have to there's going to be consequences to natural sexual sin of course we know that i'm not saying jesus doesn't allow that of course he allows consequences but he looks at your soul and he can still call you a virgin to him praise god oh my that's looking through eternal eyes amen that's looking through real eyes of love hallelujah you can still look at your soul and say you're a virgin to me you've never been handled by a man or woman oh my romans seven one through three maokai i get it can you read it for me roman okay you're not okay okay i got it i just thought you there romans 7 1-3 know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath the husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she should be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she is no adulteress whether she be married to another man now look at verse 4 wherefore my brethren ye also become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye shall be married to another to him who raised is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law now look there's a law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter there it is right there we were all handled by some man's system we're all married to one system either the flesh or the law before we came to christ but then our first husband died even though we were handled right by another man system or the law rehearsed husband died and then later in first corinthians or 2nd corinthians 11 paul says i want to present you as a chaste virgin to jesus christ how could god how could paul call the corinthian church virgin because they were they had adulterers they didn't they didn't mourn over sexual sin in chapter five of book one how can he do that because the blood of jesus christ washed over their souls and their souls cannot sin they now have a new seed that new seed in their soul produces a new life and god only looks at that seed let's say under our feet musician can come now that's a short version but i've never found anyone who's ever able to show me anything different on that i say that love i don't say that arrogantly i say that humbly i just mean it boldly i'm open to all challenges i'm open to anybody all the streamers all the shares whatever no one's ever been able to show anything all they say is i'll take what the quotes say but you have quotes on both sides then you're just cherry-picking how you ever how you ever want to act and believe right and what do you do if you say every word is infallible what do you do with that i don't know what do you do with that that's an awful situation you just say i believe everywhere on the tape that's all i believe right in that blind spiritual state that many people are in but how many know that the bible's right praise god and i don't say this to try to correct but god's prophet as far as that way it was brother ram's opinion and i'm here laying out the true doctrine about ministers marriage requirements and george some people don't remember this brother braham hardly slept any that night before preaching that sermon he was so nervous about preaching that sermon you can listen to i listened to it on saturday that sermon he said i hardly got any sleep he was up all night he was under a lot of pressure he he said i don't have time to teach this doctrine and read all the scriptures and remember we can't find where jacob had at least a dozen wives he swore to god only have four so it takes a lot of humility it takes a lot of prayer it takes the holy spirit to direct us to the word of god and have the true teaching on ministers marriage requirements again i respect both sides but i believe the truth is ministers must only marry a holy ghost-filled woman and have one wife praise god one living spouse i believe that's requirement plus the other 19. let's power our heads forward to prayer now church i knew this would be a very focused subject i knew the sisters maybe they wouldn't maybe understand this or i should understand it but maybe it wouldn't mean much to them but i hope the ending meant something to everybody and even you young malachi i don't even know if it meant much to him but the end should mean everything to you that the blood of jesus christ will call your soul a virgin to him which means you're totally pure in his eyes your soul when the holy ghost is living in there because god's seed remains inside of you and god's seed cannot only want a seed inside your soul praise god a seed that remains and cannot sin that's what i want by god's grace let's pray heavenly father we thank you for tonight lord god thank you for the truth of your word lord i went fast through it but lord i i felt led to do it lord god i've had numerous questions about it it was all in my mind it's all my heart i just feel led to preach it thank you god for giving me the grace to do it i just pray any sincere heart will ask me humble questions in our church or those listening in lord god we just approach it humbly lord and look to the word of god and then like the bible says be ready to always have an answer for those who have a question about the hope that's inside you second peter 3 15 i believe it is lord just let your truth prevail in our lives that the blood of jesus christ separates us from all sin that we can rejoice knowing that lord you see us as virgin lord that you're looking lord for us to be ready so you can come to rescue us away from the great tribulation period which we're honored lord if you do that father we to be eternally honored dear god for the marriage of thy son lord i know this sermon will be controversial no doubt lord i believe it also help many sisters and brothers who've been wounded by preachers who hold legalistic teachings dear god like we mentioned at least two cases i've seen dear god pray your people would be set free your people would hold on to the truth and the truth would make them free father we just worship you tonight we thank you god for this opportunity to be in your house in jesus christ's name and the church said amen praise god thank you jesus for the blood applied can we listen that's what i'm thankful i'm thankful for that tonight i'm thankful i know it's applied to my life praise god i don't got the lyrics [Music] i was lost i was running out of time [Music] of the separated you held me in your sights [Music] for the first time [Music] jesus [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] three days [Music] i am [Music] jesus [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] for

attention my full diligence all my as you said lord my body soul mind is strength god every fiber my being i owe it all to you i give it to you lord for your glory [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i just say this for the children it means so much to me the blood of jesus christ because i can remember saying cuss words i can remember wearing immodest clothes i can remember telling people i hated them i could remember committing all kinds of sins and then jesus will come around and say you're a virgin to me church that makes children you know that makes the blood of jesus christ the most valuable and the most precious thing there could be in this lifetime can everybody say amen to that it's such a paradox how can jesus call me a virgin i like i didn't sin like i didn't do that but yet he does that because i have a new life inside of me i've been given a new start inside of me that's the kind of god i want to serve that's the kind of god i want to be married to for all eternity let's just pray together heavenly father thank you god blessed is the man or woman whom thou will not impute sin to i can remember some of those times i was so mad i said such wicked things i wish people would go to hell i was such an evil person but you could come around and say i forgive you and you're a virgin in my sight only by the grace of god thank you jesus [Music] i wasted 19 years of my life thank you god for giving me these few years to serve you lord i will always rejoice in your mercy to me thank you for the blood that washed my wretched life my wretched sins away father help these children to trust in the blood of jesus christ all the days of their life may they serve us adults lord there's only two of us here tonight help us oh god to devote our entire lives to your service complete submission to jesus christ i owe all to you i will give all to you help me lord to stand among criticism stand if we're the only church that stands for the truth help us to stand dear god i'm sure we're not the only one i pray you bless us and help us now bless us rest of our week lord again we pray for mother william bring him out in jesus christ's name restore my parents marriage i pray in jesus christ a lot of call from here tonight lord i just pray you heal our throats and we can love you and serve you and glorify you and sing the best we can say amen the best we can and never miss the church service help us dear god bless your people help me to be a light as well we'll give you all thanks and praise for the blood of jesus christ the church said amen god bless you
