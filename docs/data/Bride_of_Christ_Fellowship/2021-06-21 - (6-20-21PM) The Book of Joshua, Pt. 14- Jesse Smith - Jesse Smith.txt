========================================

jesus deserves our love of praise i sure appreciate that song all those songs but i really appreciate that one he deserves our loudest praise hallelujah let's go to joshua here we'll go to joshua chapter 8. then we'd like to read our memory verse from isaiah again joshua chapter 8. last sunday we preached i'm sorry it was two sundays ago we preached twice on joshua last sunday we just looked at chapter seven the sin of aitkin and then today we'll look at the conquest of ai we'll try to finish chapter 8 by the grace of the lord so joshua 8 verse one we'll just read verse one and then we'll do the memory verse here tonight uh by god's grace joshua eight verse one let's read that together one two three and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land this was all given to joshua now remember the previous chapter he was all discouraged like why did we lord why'd you even bring us out of the out of the wilderness right we went to god we stayed in the desert but god says no this is yours as we as we'll see god is the god of second chances praise god isaiah 41. the church if we feel like we failed in anything i think that's the main thought from this chapter if you've ever felt like you failed a test you didn't pass a test uh you struggled you felt defeated take courage because god will bring you back to that same place god didn't say forget about ai he said no you got to go deal with the ai but this time you're going in my anointing with all the sin confessed praise god that's the great lesson we learned i'm just going to start with that so you kind of have the understanding it's a beautiful chapter lord willing the holy spirit will help me to bring out a few things that will encourage you in your walk with the lord isaiah 41 verse 10. praise god fear not both these are fear not hallelujah perfect love still casts out all of our fears praise god so before we read that i'm sorry let's read that and then we'll have a word of prayer isaiah 41 verse 10 let's begin on three one two three fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness amen let's bow our heads and word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto the lord uh we had an unspoken request from brother amen we're going to pray for his request there and we'll pray for the same request this morning praise god all things are possible in the name of jesus christ praise god heavenly father we come in that mighty name the name high lifted up the name that's above all names the name of power the name of authority that all demons have to tremble at the mighty name of jesus christ we come in that holy name we worship you tonight holy holy holy is the lord god almighty who was and is and is to come father we've read your word lord i just pray you'll break it to our hearts lord god that it might encourage us on our christian journey lord bring out the thoughts and testimonies that will encourage the people lord and strengthen them that we fear not lord any enemy or any battle lord or any situation that will have perfect love dwelling in our souls and our minds will be transformed to be able to get a victory in every situation for the glory of god and lord i pray a special blessing here lord upon little victoria lord as we go to the waters of baptism that her heart will be completely right with you ready at such a young age lord god to love and serve you and father we again thank you for this opportunity thank you for brother amen being here and sister who are going to get him lord and the wonderful songs god we're just we're so blessed by your presence oh god we never want to take it for granted lord god we just want to thank you for all the gifts in the church all the blessings every each and every person playing their part dear god we thank you for each soul that's pressed their way out to the house of god today and bless our fathers that they can continue to serve another year lord manifesting the love of jesus christ in their positions we pray and father bless us thy reading of thy word in jesus christ's name and the saints said amen god bless you as your being seen and praise god you know each week i try to watch you know the uh the news and everything like that and i didn't see much news this week i looked at you know israel a little bit and and they had a little ceasefire they had those elections right and so the new guy got in there i liked i liked netanyahu but uh he got voted out he thought there was some election fraud which i wouldn't be surprised because we had it in our nation right i wouldn't be surprised if it's the same thing so anyways at least they're on a ceasefire but let's still remember to pray for israel perhaps at the end i'll make a little reminder here to pray for israel as well with their new leadership um i guess this guy that come in he was a protege under netanyahu so netanyahu trained this guy up for numerous years and then he ran against him and won so well apparently well let's pray for israel also i was looking at things with the roman catholic church i didn't see much news this week um did anybody see any news about the catholic church this week okay right i think i saw that too yo then the pope i don't know which side he leaned on i couldn't remember which side he was leaning towards his leftist okay yeah so the bishops were leaning towards right like dedicated the catholic uh catechism and everything but the pope is a little more left uh interesting and then uh oh the other thing the one thing i think we could pray about was i don't know if you saw it but uh senator joe manchin from west virginia he had come out in opposition against hr1 which hr one if it passes it's a federal law that will change voting requirements and mandate voting requirements for every state in other words it'll be total voter fraud would be allowed by democrats if they pass this it could be the beginning of the end at least for america uh because all the states that all the states have vote that have voter fraud like arizona uh georgia they've they've since that election in november they passed laws to stop that from happening but senator joe manchin came out against it well now he's for it so just letting you know something we can pray for uh the voting laws it's called hr1 um now of course if they even if they passed it you know they could sue and take it to the supreme court which could take it down or the supreme court could lately they haven't been ruling many good rulings for uh conservatives but just something to watch there's something to pray about now the reason i bring that up is because the churches have to unite with uh the the politicians in order to bring about the image of the beast program tells us that in the church age book the ecumenical move must come so united the churches and state must unite i don't know i don't know about you but most preachers are leaning towards democratic values right which would be abortion rights and lgbt rights all those things like that so that looks like the way it would go it looked like all the the churches would get behind hr1 in other words allow voting fraud to keep all these liberal people in power that's fine that's fine for them because this this this world is not our kingdom we serve a greater kingdom that cannot be moved praise god by just letting you know if this passes it could be a really awful thing and it could be another sign that we're closer than we think the beginning of the end as far as any fair elections so this would basically turn us into a uh tyrant nation right uh just just so just watch and pray about that i emailed brother joe or not brother i emailed senator manchin saying please don't support this please don't support this you know but we'll see what happens of course they you know it's all in god's hands but anyways we have to uh jesus said you must uh uh jesus told us in the parable he must occupy till i come right aren't you glad george washington occupied we went down to gettysburg last week or two weeks ago i'm glad lincoln occupied i'm glad he occupied in his time and so we've got to occupy in our time in the little testimonies that we have in our lives as we feel that of the lord so let's go to joshua here back to chapter eight i'll try to watch my time a little bit we'll try to do an hour from here lord willing we'll see my finish a little earlier uh so chapter eight now we finished chapter seven uh the last time we looked at this and uh here god is giving joshua a second chance now that sin has been dealt with he's gonna give joshua another chance and he starts off with those beautiful words like all angels start out with fear not fear not neither be thou dismayed don't be discouraged because you had a little setback in your walk with the lord right don't be discouraged everybody has those everybody uh sometimes hides sins right everybody has a little bit of sinfulness you know and uh brother branham lied to the irs right he did some other things that maybe didn't please the lord so much and he said lord you owe me understanding and you know different sins that but the brother branham had we know the same thing paul said there's times i wanted to do right but i did wrong right the things that i hated that's what i did so everybody has shortcomings everybody has failures but we are not a people that give up we're not a people that wallow around in defeat amen we're not a people that let sin lay around the house that's not that's not the joshua army the joshua army cleans it up deals with it and moves on in the name of jesus that's how we always must remember that we're always going to fall short that's why we must always come back to church right we must always read our bibles and pray because we're all going to fall short but we're not the army that gives up and quits and i need a break from god i need a year off from church i need you know we're not that kind of type we're the kind of type that it's time for the next battle praise god all right we've got more we've got more ground to take praise god there's more victories that we must press on towards amen right that that's our attitude that's how joshua's uh attitude was too now remember church that's the difference between the holy ghost filled saint and the sanctified one the holy ghost-filled saint is conquering constantly they're just constantly getting victory over that one over that one over that one it's just victory after victory after victory praise god don't forget that praise god but the sanctified one he's the one out in the wilderness he's kind of complaining he's got easy easy life everything's just handed to him they're just babied right that's what brother i said they're all babied uh but then in the new covenant you got warriors you got the people that battle with the sword they know how to wield the sword of the word amen they know how to cut out victories and and speak the word of god and move on to greater victories and experience the victory of god in their life they're not babies right they don't have to get manna from heaven every day they know how to plant seed amen they know how to trust in the god's timing that that seed planted under the right conditions it will bring forth in its time and season amen that's a real mature christian praise god hallelujah that's a christian they can they can understand god has a time god has a season i don't have to be babied every day i have to see a miracle every day because i know god is in control and my god is the miracle working god amen my great battle right and we would say our great battle is pushing out all the inhabitants of the land right all the inhabitants all the sinful habits and all the sinful desires pushing out those getting victory after victory right from glory to glory from faith to faith shining more and more onto a perfect day where we're warriors every day we get up ready to battle praise god drive out the enemy and see the victories of god in our lives hallelujah so god says fear not arise go up to ai i've given so again he prophesies in verse one right he's saying don't fear he's prophesying and said i've given you uh this land the king the people his city and his land that's about everything right it's about everything i've given it all to you he said arise and go now look notice church he gives specific directions now remember before the men just got together and said oh we can do it we don't we can just we just need three thousand men we can take these guys down look how much different god's plan is than their plan their plan will just go up during the day three thousand it'll be just like jericho will destroy him it failed i failed because they didn't seek god on how to do it praise god so god but now that they got the sin out now they can start listening to the lord again and their their god is talking to them and telling them how to get the victory praise god and verse two and this shalt thou do to ai and her kings as thou listen to jericho her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall you take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind it now look the spoil was all theirs in other words aiken could have taken whatever he wanted had he just been able to wait a little longer church we just got to learn to wait the reward comes later obey the word first reward comes later don't get ahead of god your satan wants to try to get you ahead of god and like like satan tried to get jesus well take your kingdoms now just fall down and worship me he always wants us to try to get ahead of the plan but we got to be more patient we've got to be more humble praise god we've got to trust in the lord and not inject ourselves into something okay he said i'm gonna do an ambush for the city behind it hallelujah so joshua rose and all the people wore verse three to go up against ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand men of valor and sent them away by night this is gonna be a night battle right i'm sorry this is a night ambush rather see they went up during the day god said you gotta go by night totally different than what they thought in verse 4 and he commanded them saying behold he shall lie and wait against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye already and i and all the people that are with thee will approach unto the city and it should come to pass when they come out against us as the first that they will flee before them that we will flee before them for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city for they will say they flee before us as at the first therefore we will flee before them then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand and it shall be when you have taken this city that you shall set the city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall you do see i have commanded you so again ai like jericho god is judging these heathen nations that over 400 years to repent if they haven't repented god was going to destroy them now america's had 250 some years right so we'll see how long america gets some people believe that it's very short other it could be longer right it could be longer we'll see but the bible says we'll know the times and seasons praise god and he says burn it with fire he said i've commanded you see i've commanded you to finish in verse 8 there see i have commanded you now look and joshua therefore sent them forth and they went into lie in ambush in a bow between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua lodged that night among the people so they sent a large group of the people to the west of the city and then joshua was going to come up around the north of this city so this was going to be an ambush and you know military men have studied joshua for years because they learned how to fight battles right there was no general greater than joshua and look where to get this wisdom from the holy spirit if you're going to get a victory god's going to show you how to get the victory through the holy spirit praise god you know i just i just kind of look at like when brother amen and sisterhood came in the lord had me preached that sermon about why we're not a denomination the lord knew what servant needed to be and i remember brother i sat there sister i remember i sat there in my office like wow i have nothing left to preach i was so tired that day i have nothing yet left to preach my only sermon left is this sermon called why we're not denomination why in the world would i preach this and then coo brought about 30 guests that day see god's got a word for every time in season praise god did i just say it like this i had no idea god was going to get the victory through that sermon didn't seem like a very fitting sermon but it was and it's just what the people needed to hear praise god uh you know and who had sat in so many sermons before and i preached and thought oh this is going to help this brother you know i love ku you know we love coop i just thought this was going to help him you know and you know it's just interesting how god brings the word different each time think about what sermon brought you in here serpent seed for me right sir siege show me this message do you remember what message it was i remember brother william you remember what message it was you told me the one that preached your life do you remember what the topic was that's okay yeah he was sharing with me out there that he walked in there and they you know he'd been coming for a while but the minister preached on everything and he thought his friend had told the the preacher all about his life but he had it and the holy spirit had the holy spirit had told the preacher all about brother william's life and he knew the holy ghost was there because he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen praise god and so god knows what god knows how to do the job in other words god knows how to give you the victory we just got to listen until we get the understanding on the victory praise god like who would have thought you know like your dad brother and sister who who would have thought it would have been a prayer cloth like we weren't planning on that it's just what the lord brought right and so not not every one has to be a prayer cloth it don't have to be right but that's what god wanted to use that time and that was the overcoming word for that hour it's just it's awesome to know that the holy we're following the holy spirit just like joshua was that service we were we were just doing exactly what the holy spirit told us to do amen it's not the same right it's different for every person but that was exactly what the holy spirit i preached philippians part 1 i think i preached like 16 sermons on that one i can't remember but that one particular had to be about the prayer class it just it was the word for that day right and so we don't know and we prayed right we prayed and had services before that right nothing changed but we just needed the right word right and then that's what the holy spirit did and so it was an ambush uh he says verse 10 and joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people went up he and the elders of israel before the people of the ai and all the people even the people of the war that are with him went up and drew nine came before the city pitched on the north side of ai now there was a valley between them and ai so there's a perfect spot there for battle so god set it up perfectly he's going to bring joshua from the north josh is going to come down from the north and fight in the valley like they did last time but there's going to be an ambush on the west now this is quite a picture i'd say this must have been a real nimble army because they sat there in the west west of the city and no one detected them that church every or maybe the holy spirit blinded them to see in them praise god like elijah right and all those soldiers they said where's elijah he said let me tell you let me go show you and the bible said they blinded god blinded them to knowing who elijah was until they got in the city and then he said i'm elijah hallelujah and just like god had blinded gerhaza to all the angels right around around him and elijah they were blinded but not not naturally but spiritually amen so see like i was telling the brother brother amen i heard a testimony from brother donny reagan and brother ed biskull when they first took the message in china they drove through the border i forget which country they went into might have been himalayas i can't remember which one it was well when they passed over the borders brother william they had boxes full of message books in the back now that's illegal going into china and the testimony was they got stopped and they said we need to search your car and they said okay search the car and they prayed beforehand that god would give them favor and the and they went back there they lifted up the the uh like the the blanket on the boxes they saw the books flipped through them a little bit close it said okay thanks for stopping you're free to go and that's how the message got to china amen god blinded their eyes because our god is a mighty warrior praise god but you don't have to do it that way every time that's just one way he did it and then afterwards some of them got daddy got arrested for a few days and was in a jail in china so see god let him get in but then there's different battles right there's got to fight a battle here this one they got the victory they might have to fight a battle there but god knows how to do it god knows how to direct his word to your life amen hallelujah god knows how to get a bride ready for the coming of the bridegroom amen that was years ago man because that's why we say always stay with god's word always obey god and god will do signs miracles and wonders to back up his word amen hallelujah that's what i appreciate i like that that's faith right there he said verse 13 and when they had sent the people even all the hosts that was on the north side of the city they're liars away on the west of the city joshua went that night into the midst of the valley that night he sneaks into the valley and it came to pass when the king of ai saw that they hastened and rose up early and the men of city went against israel to battle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plane but he was not that there was liars and ambush against him behind the city so look at the wisdom here look at the wisdom of god god kind of fakes them out right he kind of tricks them oh he makes the enemy think like oh this is going to be another victory just like the last one right we're going to oh it's going to be the same way they're going to come out we're going to go defeat em it's gonna be just like the last time but church anybody knows there's no two battles are the same right like i played football we would play a team and maybe beat them the first time but then maybe lose the second time because every battle's different you gotta approach circumstances are different the next time but see that but god outsmarted the enemy this time god always outsmarts the enemy praise god if you obey the word and if you keep everything under the blood god is going to get the victory praise god hallelujah they just had to obey the word of the lord right they couldn't do it like last time they got to do it a different way now to never break the word right god will never want you to break the word but sometimes you have to do things differently all right okay now verse 15 and joshua israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness so can you imagine joshua acting like he's getting whipped you know he's fighting a little bit ah he's running back and they think oh yeah we're getting the great victory and god knew what was going to happen god knew that they were gonna try to get some false incur false courage and bring all their soldiers out against them right oh my and so that's exactly what happened verse 16 and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursue after them and they pursued after joshua and we're drawn away from the city see god knows how to weaken your enemy think about it who's given you the hardest time who's discouraged you who do you feel like well i just hate being around that person i really don't like that person think about the last time you failed or had a little difficulty god knows how to humble them praise god like i told you that last time i felt like i failed with the dentist remember that the dentist was said oh god doesn't care about healing teeth and i i didn't have the words to say in that hour but i went there the next time praying singing uh bringing out the word and the first thing it was right before easter and he said oh happy easter i said yes happy i was ready i was ready for him right this time i was gonna i was gonna testify and i said yeah i said god healed my mom a cancer when i was in second grade i just get that out right away and sorry he's like wow that's amazing and uh and then he asked me remember he asked me that question i think i told you but he said i've asked so many preachers over the years where did jesus go from the time he was 12 to 30 before his ministry was he out in the wilderness getting revelations from god was he out doing miracles and i said no i said he was being submissive to his mother and father and i said that's the greatest sign of being a love child of god right because he said this is my son in whom i will please if you want to please god submit to your parents amen children if you want to be a real child of god submit to almighty god amen and then as soon as i said that he stuck the thing in there started working again he didn't want to hear that one he was looking for something mysterious but i left out of there and he said have a great easter and i said jesus christ is alive and well he's risen today so that to me that's just a recent example of how i felt like i failed but then the next time i went in it was a little different this time i was ready to testify in other words i was ready to determine what the conversation was going to be about not let's see the first time when they're all fearful oh am i going to have surgery or what's going to be wrong with me do i have problems with my teeth you know i went in there all discouraged see we got to approach situations with faith praise god we got to face our enemies with love and power and be strong and not fear them but fear god amen that's the one we need to fear is god amen and that's just one example and i thought about simon when he witnessed to me and it was his idea to win me to the message was he just gotta listen to serpenty come on jess listen to servancy i'm like okay man we'll do it and then it's like the battle worked perfectly i received it praise god i'm a message believer now cam was not the same way cammy had to battle for a year and they had argument after argument debate after debate the victory didn't come the same way it wasn't as easy as hey brother cam let's just sit down and talk about it it took cam to see to get to go through his denomination and see how they turned down the word turn down the word and then cam finally said i want to come can i come to those saturday night prayer meetings and the the sermons at florida in defiance can i come and then cam comes here's the word they're driving home and he says and the and the revelation struck cam while he's driving home in the car with simon simon's driving home brother brooks had just preached and he said uh and brother simon bill simon said he was ready to battle he's ready to battle cam argue about the sermon right he's in battle mode see it comes different every time this time the holy spirit come down and reveal it to brother cam and he said he said so the name of the father son holy ghost is the lord jesus christ is that right simon was like yeah that's right that's right brother that's right and they drive a little further and say and and simon's like ready to argue and bring out some scriptures and brother cam said oh so there's one name to the father son holy ghost that's lord jesus christ i was like that's right that's right he's ready to fight and cam said i want to be baptized he said what he said don't he said don't don't joke around with me because he was so violent towards the message he said i was backslidden and simon was backslidden and we're all backslidden we're all we're all in the cult and everything like that and now he wants to be in the cult but it's not a cult it's the body of christ amen hallelujah it's the blood wash it's the blood boy church of the living god amen hallelujah totally different this victory came totally different than the previous one some of them are going to be easy some of them are going to have to fight for praise god we have to and how many willing to fight we i thank god for the jericho's where we just sit back and just worship just love god just go through your daily routine it's going to be awesome but there's some that we're going to battle and fight for we've got to be willing to follow the leading of the holy ghost to win those souls praise god and simon said oh yes okay brother cam he said for some reason i just felt led to bring baptismal clothes so simon had see god already prepared the baptism will close for him so they turned around drove an hour back to where they got they where they had the service got baptized and brother brooks had already got the lima he drove an hour back to baptized by the camp and that's real dedication but see the victory comes differently every time it's not always the same so we have to be led to the holy spirit and obey the directions of the holy spirit that's why the bible said come with a leading everybody come with a revelation right a psalm a doctrine like when lydia got her victory there i you know she had that mind battle right we all we thought the victory might come through my prayer right or but it didn't come that way it came through sister naomi's testimony right it always comes different right and so we got to be just willing to follow the leadership of the holy spirit praise god do all that we know how to do but then follow god's leading see how we're led see god will always lead you when he wants you to do something praise god always lead you always be kind of pushing you right and encouraging you like that woman that that prayed for the sick baby and brother branham's meeting remember that oh she thought well brother ram can pray for it brother man can pray no you've got to go pray for it see everybody she so in other words she had a gift of faith praise god or a gift of divine healing and god will lead you to it may god lead us church may we be willing to be led by the holy spirit praise god may we be sensitive enough to sense when god is leading us to do something like go pray for somebody or try to encourage somebody or be a blessing to somebody praise god it may not come the same way every time we got to be willing to do our part praise god those are a few examples i thought of how each time it may come different than it did before it may be a slightly different but we've got to be willing to follow the leadership of the holy spirit huh so verse 17 and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went now not out after israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand and joshua stretch out the spear that he had in his hand toward this city now remember joshua was in the plane he was fighting right but then he's like act god's like act like you're getting defeated so he ran back and then all of a sudden he turned around and he stretched forth his spear just like moses as i was with moses so will i be with you amen moses took the rod stretch it out towards the waters the waters instead of coming flowing they stood up on a heap as long as he stretched out the word of god amen as long as he put his faith out there in action god backed up his faith amen so joshua ran back he finally got under leadership of the holy spirit held out a spear and then the ambush jumps out somehow somehow they were hidden well i think it was like 25 000 men just hidden over there on the west side and they come out and the bible said verse 19 and the ambush rose quickly out of their place and ran as soon as they had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city took it and hastened and set the city on fire and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city and sent it up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers i like that when god gets the devil in a corner right and he kind of squeezes his head in there and he just gets him in a corner i like that praise god amen he thought he was so smart but god shows him god's a smart one praise god god knows how to ambush the city amen he always gets the victory and we gotta let god get the victory so see just like just like david remember church we gotta uh we have to inquire of the lord on every situation for god's timing for god's season praise god this is what they didn't do last time they didn't pray about it they just thought well we'll just get the victory but they went and prayed about it i'm sorry this time they sought the lord they got the directions and the ambush takes the city all right uh verse i'm gonna skip down a little bit for time sake yeah none of them escaped in verse 22 verse 23 and the king of ai they took a life and brought him to joshua and came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying all inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed that all the israelites returned unto the ai and smote it with the edge of the sword and so it was that all that fell that day both men and women and were 12 000 even all the men of ai remember they lost 36 but now they destroyed 12 000. see how god always gets the victory praise god god always gets the victory his victory was much greater than defeat your victories are much greater than your stumblings amen your little defeats are nothing and compared to what god is going to bless you with amen if you just keep god's word amen he's going to give you such great testimonies praise god you know brother bang i've been sharing your dad's testimony with so many people and they'll try to share a testimony with me none although they're good testimonies none of them match your dad's testimony right because our victories are going to be greater than our defeats praise god like i've been talking to people they say well i've just been camping out in my house and with covert i never went anywhere i'm like huh i went everywhere you know i just yeah really you just camped out for a year and a half and i just we didn't live in fear we just chose not to live in fear oh and god provided all your needs that's wonderful god healed a man who was almost dead praise god to god god raised him up you know see some amount of little little losses and things like that but stay true to god god will give you the great victories amen hallelujah that's what i love about the lord amen he's faithful amen so see twelve thousand men lost their lives and now look verse 26 joshua drew not his hand back now it doesn't say he got any help from anybody moses had to have help there when he had the arms up right not joshua that jehovah's our salvation amen the type of the holy ghost he just stands there and holds it the whole time imagine 12 000 people they got to ransack the city 12 000 people he just stands there and holds it like that i don't know about you the other day i tried to hold up my arm for something oh i was just like hanging on our fence i just kind of wanted to see how long i could do it i couldn't last maybe one minute but there's joshua he holds up this spear i wonder how heavy the spear was he holds up the spear this whole time while the victory's going on see he's empowered supernaturally that represented faith is in effect right i'm standing on the word of god amen i'm gonna hold on to god's unchanging hand amen i'm gonna hold on to god until the victory's won amen hallelujah i'm not giving up as long as i stand here and hold god's spear hold god's sword we'll get the victory praise god that's what we need to say too as long as i stand here and hold god's word we're not going to be defeated we are going to get the victory church amen just hold on to god's word amen that's right beautiful picture there of joshua he held it there until they'd utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of a.i in other words just pray until you get the victory hallelujah just keep singing just keep worshiping just keep reading your bible till you get the victory just hold it there just hold steady hold firm and god will back you up with his word jesus had to do that although fasting 40 days he had to do that and he got the victory now look at verse 27 only the cattle and the spoiled that city israel took for a prayer unto themselves according to the word lord which he had commanded joshua and joshua burnt ai and made it in heat forever even a desolation unto this day and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as soon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city and raised there on a great heap of stones that remaineth unto this day look they do the same thing to king ai that they did to aiken in other words both were equal in their wickedness right it's wicked to steal a babylonian garment some shekels and then a bar of gold that's wicked when god said that's all mine right so both men get a heap of stones a heap of judgment upon them right for the wickedness that they did god doesn't like disobedience in fact scofield said this he said the whole cause of christ is injured by the sin neglect or unspirituality of one believer right so both of them get a heap of stones testifying these were wicked men don't follow their example follow the example of joshua that's right hallelujah now look church just look this this enemy they thought was such a big battle turned out to be nothing the one they lost to they defeated easily because they had all the right all the right directions god had given them all the right uh all the right word of the lord and order get the victory so the enemy that joshua thought was so great turned out to be so weak as long as sin was out of the camp praise god see people that we're afraid of or situations we're afraid of if we really just got all the sin and out of the unbelief out of our hearts and and any of the fears if we just got that out we'd see it as this is just another uh this is just another uh i say like this another uh testimony in our testimony in our walk with the lord this is just another uh stepping stone on our way to glory praise god this is another testimony where god's gonna get the glory god's gonna bring us through coronavirus praise god god brought us through the other ones god brought us through each and every battle he's gonna be with us in the future as long as we're staying with god god will stay with us amen he give us a second chance because god is the god of second chances god won't let god won't call you to the baptism of the holy ghost and let you be defeated this is the promised land this is the land of milk and hearty this is the this is the land of victors this is the land of permanent dwellings this is the land of blessings that you you cannot even contain there's such great blessings in the baptism of the holy ghost you can't contain them there's so many blessings ah it's true amen thank god amen so true so many great blessings now look at verse now here 30 the 35 this is the shorter part of the chapter but this is really where i have the majority of the thoughts i'd like to share here so this really was the most important part because we see how any enemy falls when we obey the word of god any obstacle we're facing is little in god's sight it might seem great in our sight we might feel like a failure but he said cheer up he said get up stop groveling around on the ground stop telling god how much of a lazy person you are what a fail you are confess your sins stand up and let's fight this is how god speaks to his army today praise god because remember jesus said be faithful unto death he told the church of fire tear that don't be faithful until no unto right don't fear in other words don't fear death if i've called you to death i'll bring you through that that'll just be a door to the victory to the next dimension amen oh yes lord so see it's a it's a walk it's a diligent walk with god and we just have to confess all of our sin there's that thunder right all right chapter 30 i'm sorry verse 30. sorry then josh will build an altar unto the lord god of israel in the mount ebal and moses the servant of the lord command the children of israel i'm sorry as moses the servant lord had commanded unto the children of israel as is written the book of the law of moses an altar of whole stones over which no man had lift up any iron and they offered their own burnt offerings unto the lord and sacrifice sorry sacrifice peace offerings and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel now what you notice now watch this so joshua is following moses's command he's supposed to take some stones put plaster or some some some say cement uh put cement on these stones and then write out the laws of god on them and all the people are supposed to stand there and watch and listen as he writes them and reads them in other words what would you do right after you got a great victory go back and look at the word rehearse more of the bible right don't get lazy on god go back there and get right back in the word of god right keep your mind meditating upon the word of god because we if we don't church we'll get prideful right if we get a great blessing a great victory and yet we don't devote ourselves to god we're going to get prideful and we're going to lose a victory right we're going to lose a battle because we're thinking we can do it on our own must have been something we did right it must have been just our our charisma what's been our must have been uh our power once man because we're so good no it's because we humbled ourselves and obeyed the word of the lord that's why we got any victory it's because we finally did what god wanted us to do praise god he didn't say go have a vacation don't worry about the word he said get back to the word go rehearse the word of god and he said actually fulfill what i told moses this is actually a fulfillment but let's read verse 33 and all israel the elders and the officers and the judges stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests and the levites which bear the ark of the covenant of the lord as well as a stranger and he that was born among them half of them over against mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses servant lord had commanded before that they should bless the people of israel so god calls him to sacrifice here in a valley and then he's got two mountains on the side and half of the people are on one side of the mountain and the other half are on the other side of the mountain this is what god wanted them to do he told them to do this before they even got in the promised land so go to deuteronomy 27 i'll tell you god is so faithful didn't he say he'd bring all things to our remembrance this is god reminding them of the covenant blessings and curses right after their first real victory where they got to use the sword before they just let the sword sit right there you know as far as the walls falling once they got in yeah they did slay but this one they didn't have any walls fall down this was an ambush right and they had more of a part in this one and god has to remind them you got your first great victory here by your own through your own submission and obedience now remember the promises of god deuteronomy 27 look at verse 2. it should come to pass on the day when you pass over jordan unto the lamb which the lord thy god giveth thee that thou shalt set up the great stones and plaster them with plaster that sound familiar and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over that thou mayest go in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth the lamb with the flow with milk and honey as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee therefore it shall be when ye are gone over jordan that you shall set up these stones which i command you this day and mount ebal and thou shalt plaster them with plaster and there shalt thou build an altar lord thy god an altar of stones thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them so god said i don't want you working on these testimonies i'm gonna i just want these plain testimonies you don't put any of your work on it just find stones and don't don't put any man part in this right this is just gonna be testimonies praise god don't put any work in it just stack them the way i stack them i want you to stack them right don't work on it verse 6 thou shalt build the altar the lord thy god of whole stones and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto lord thy god now look he tells him after you get the victory sacrifice sacrifice but burn offerings and now notice verse seven there's specific offerings churches should give us a good clue what to do once we get a victory verse 7 and thou shalt offer peace offerings and shall eat there and rejoice before the lord thy god and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly they just defeated the ai right and he said come up here all happy over here happy over here we're going to set up an altar and we're going to give peace offerings and burnt offerings and both of those were blood offerings amen in other words blood was going to be shed they were going to remember the power of the blood as soon as they got the victory go back to the blood give a peace offerings and peace offerings were thank offerings in other words get under the anointing of the blood and give god thanksgiving amen if god answers your prayer give a thanks offering give a thanks song special give a thanks shout give a thanks prayer do something to show you thank god for what he's done for you praise god and give a burn offering which is was a total it was a total sacrifice it was a total consuming of yourself give your it was whole devotion to god with the other ones brother william you could eat a little bit of the meat you could eat some of the bread of the of the meal offering you could drink some of the wine in the drink offering but the burnt offering was the only one that nobody ate nobody touched that one that was just god so lord i'm gonna thank you and i'm gonna give myself completely to you amen i'm gonna be completely devoted to you praise god not gonna give anybody any credit it's all going to jesus and make it really plain make it really simple the words of this law so you get a great victory that's time to get back to the scripture that's the time to give god thanks that's time to be more devoted to jesus completely devoted to jesus now what was the word that they were going to read it wasn't the whole new testament it was just deuteronomy 27 and 28. that was all just the blessings and curses now if you read this it's really amazing if you go down to jurong 27 verse 12 these shall stand upon mount gerizim to bless the people so simeon levi judah issachar joseph and benjamin stand on mount gerizim and they ble they say all the blessings they read all the blessings and then the in verse 13 needs to stand on mount ebal to curse reuben gad asher zebul and dan and naphtali and then the levi speak with a loud voice in verse 15 cursed to be any man that then the levites give all these curses and all the people shall answer amen so god just brought them to this mountain to show you listen you're either going to have a mountain of blessings or a mountain of cursing god help us to have mountains of blessings amen hallelujah they'd read the law and everybody on the good side would say hey man can you imagine hundreds of thousands of people or thousands of people shouting amen reading all the blessings of god and on the other side they had to read the curses too if you do this you're cursed and everybody would say amen sounds like a pretty good church service to me praise god like they do that right in africa right sometimes they have brothers on one side and sisters on one side not everywhere in africa but some places they do i've seen it on the live stream you know sometimes or the archive shows of the sermons and so they would read all these curses now in chapter 27 their curse and verse 15 they just read the curses if you have secret idols you're cursed if you dishonor your parents or curse if you steal land you're cursed if you judge uh if you don't judge right you're cursed if you have sexual immorality curse if you fight and kill in verses 24 25 your curse but then in verse 20 eight i'm sorry chapter 28 they start getting into the blessings in verse 2 all the blessings will overtake you if you keep the word of god and all that mountain of garrison would say amen that's what i want to hear i already hear amen all the blessings i'm gonna keep the word of god god's blessings are gonna overtake me they're gonna chase me down amen amen to that moses amen to that joshua praise god let the blessings of god rule my life praise god because i want to keep the word in verse three i'm blessed in the city brother william or i'm blessed in the field either way if i live in the city calgary falls or i live out to the country in those times i'm still blessed but i'm just kind of being silly but you understand no matter where they were as long as they obeyed the word of god god was going to bless them is it raining we have to pray for the rain to stop here but maybe by the time we'll get there it'll stop we'll see the fruit of your body your children are blessed in verse four yeah if you left your windows open you better go close them that's that's all right i might have left actually mine open on the van you know check malachi you go check bud you get my keys out of there or you can borrow mommy's keys i'm thankful my body's blessed we can have children praise god your basket in store in verse five i'm glad my basket and food is blessed whether i come in or go out i'm blessed that's verse seven verse eight whatever you set your hand to whatever you put on your hand it's gonna be blessed and the whole mountain would say amen hallelujah god will command all the blessings on you amen and the people will be afraid of you right so you'll have courage while other people are afraid they'll be scared to talk to you they want to they want to talk about jesus they don't want to talk about that because they're afraid of you they know you're going to try to witness to them and give them a church age book or something they're afraid of you they don't want to hang around you too much in verse 12 i'll bless all the work of your hands you will land and not borrow that's i think one thing in the message where we missed i'm kind of joking here but the amish people have everybody building my house on the day they get married that's a smart thing that's where they they they kind of had a good idea on that one see because we're always going to borrow if we can buy a house we always gotta borrow unless you save up your whole life and then you can get one at the very end of your life i guess i mean it wouldn't really wouldn't matter but that's where this amish had a really good thought there everybody comes together they build this new couple house there's no debt they just they just start off debt free brand new home i'm not saying let's go be amish i'm not saying that verse 13 and the lord makes you the head not the tail oh can you imagine joshua's standing there i'm the head amen i am not the tail i'm not being pulled around and whipped around i am leading this charge praise god by the power of god amen i'm a leader not a follower praise god i'm leading the armies of god hallelujah i'm gonna be pulled around by the devil kicked and was kicked around and messed around and beaten around and abused i'm gonna be the head i'm in i'm in control i'm more than a conqueror in christ jesus if you obey verse 14 if you go not to the right or the left look he was shown him there he showed me either go one way or the other right either blessings or curses now then all the curses if you don't hearken you get all the curses will overtake you i don't want curses running after me i want blessings running after me i want people to run up from behind and catch me and bless me right like we had a guy we went to gettysburg right he's a veteran from vietnam yeah you know he's a tall skinny veteran he just walked remember children he just walked up and he said something like this he said wow are those all your children like yeah yeah i said god give me some arrows you know you give me a full quiver he said oh he said i like your family did he say something like that like i like your family he said you got a beautiful family well he must have overheard us we're going to go get some ice cream right so we're all we we left and everything and we're just going to i'm sorry oh well let's just get some ice cream it's raining he walks up out of nowhere and he hands me a 50 bill he said go get your family some ice cream and i was totally i was totally caught off guard i'm like well thank you sir you know thank you and that's another example of blessings overtaking us right i didn't ask for that we didn't ask them people just look at you and they see the grace of god on you and they just want to bless you praise god and even had nine dollars extra on that one i think we're gonna spend all the money but he's like oh he said i just love you that he's like i'm a grandfather and i don't i'm not gonna retire i'm just gonna keep working i just buy my grandkids everything so i like being a blessing to people i said well god bless you sir thank you for being a blessing to our family he said oh my pleasure i love to help kids i love to you know make kids happy that's just one example of all just these blessings overtaking you the bible said if you don't obey you'll be vexed in verse 20 you'll get pestilences in verse 21. uh you'll be smitten before your enemies verse 25 you get scabs and itches in verse 27 madness a weak heart in verse 28 you will not prosper you'll be oppressed and spoiled in verse 29. verse 35 you'll get sick and not be healed verse 38 you'll plant much seed but gather very little in verse 41 you won't enjoy your children see i want to enjoy my children praise god i have i'm so proud of them all that they do for the lord and for us i'm so proud i've really enjoyed them but see if you don't obey god you won't you won't enjoy your children right because there'll be a hindrance to you now remember verse 47 why did god allow this because thou service not the lord die god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things therefore they'd serve their enemies amen and what did god tell them to do do a thank offering do a peace offer your god rejoice you're a victorious army all the sins out of your camp you're you ought to be happy you ought to be thankful serve god there's more milk and honey on the way there's many battles on the way but my blessings will chase you down praise god just like you're chasing your enemies down hallelujah while you chase them down god will chase you down amen and give you great blessings hallelujah oh that's true i've lived that praise god the more you serve god the more you faithfully obey the lord the more he blesses you so god had josh let's go back to joshua eight and we'll finish here verse 34 8 34. now notice god says do this publicly read all of deuteronomy 27 and 28 publicly so everybody's aware so even so listen even if the adults get weak the children can be an encouragement anyone ever been encouraged by a child before they're just their sincerity or if the brothers get weak got sisters to encourage us if the sisters get weak we got brothers to encourage us or if the young men get weary and faint the older ones can give us the real word of encouragement everybody was going to hear this verse 34 and afterward he read all the words of the law see the blessings and cursings he didn't read the whole book of genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy he just read deuteronomy 27 28 the blessings and curses because look now you're in the land i'm with you you're an invincible army the main thing is don't forget the blessings and curses hallelujah now that you're in stay live in the blessings of god amen have victory constantly living constant victory honor me don't turn to the right hand or left hand honor me with with everything with your entire life and my blessings will rest upon you verse 35 there was not a word so joshua must be interested in every word of god because he said they didn't leave out one word i like that about joshua that's the holy spirit today he's going to preach all the counsel of god then there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshua read not before the congregation of israel with the women see the sisters had to hear it too right because their bodies would bring forth the children right and they didn't want to be anyone they don't want cursings in their bodies they wanted blessed bodies right and the little ones why because they're going to grow up and they're going to have to drive out some enemies pretty soon it was i mean joshua drove out enemies for many many years it just wasn't like a one-year battle for years and years so the little ones had to hear the words of faith just obey god and you'll be blessed you know people say that you know be blessed right they say that be blessed i'm too blessed to be stressed i mean there's some truth to that like if you obey god's word you are going to be blessed yes you're going to fight battles yes you're going to be tested but you're more than a conqueror you're an overcomer you've got the word of god god's behind you you're part of god's army god's favor is with you amen you are going to be blessed praise god because you're in the word of god and you won't surrender to the devil you won't lay on your face and defeat all the time right you'll get up and say i'll make this right and i'm moving forward christ jesus amen see every time we have somebody leave the church i could quit and give up and say well it must be my fault i'm not much of a man of god or maybe i'll preach the wrong thing i just say god i love them help them forgive them and i press on and i preach to one or two like i do to a hundred and it's also written so they got to hear it and read it all ages got to hear it and read it for themselves because everybody was responsible everyone was responsible church let me say like this everyone in this church is responsible to keep the word of god you've all heard it you can all read it right and if i get off the word then brother man say your duty bound to come tell me just give me just give me some mercy right don't call me a son of a satan or anything like that just tell me well brother jesse might have made a mistake here maybe you could fix it i'd be happy to do that but see everybody had to do this everybody was accountable and responsible before god now this remind you pull up first corinthians 11 30 musician you can come sorry about that i should have invited you earlier i'm just going to keep going back to this church brother branham said there are curses in the new testament first corinthians 11 30 and for this cause see not discerning not judging god's body many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep you can stop the livestream i'm just going to say a few things here many are we
