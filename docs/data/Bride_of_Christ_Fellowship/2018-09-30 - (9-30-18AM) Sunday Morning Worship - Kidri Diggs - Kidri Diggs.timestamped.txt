[34:44] letter say Amen
[34:46] amen if you have your Bibles let's turn
[34:48] to Matthew the 16th chapter praise the
[34:54] Lord Amen Matthew 16 some familiar verse
[35:02] of scriptures 16 let's start reading at
[35:06] verse 13 Matthew 16 and 13 if you have a
[35:14] say man the Bible says when Jesus came
[35:18] into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he
[35:20] acts his disciples saying who do men say
[35:24] that I the Son of Man am and they said
[35:29] some say that thou art John the Baptist
[35:31] some Elias and others Jeremias or one of
[35:35] the prophets he saith unto them but whom
[35:39] say ye that I am and Simon Peter axed
[35:44] and said thou art the Christ the Son of
[35:48] the Living God and jesus answered and
[35:53] jesus answered and said unto Him blessed
[35:56] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[35:59] blood have not revealed it unto thee but
[36:04] my father which is in heaven and I say
[36:08] unto thee that thou art Peter and upon
[36:12] this rock I will build my church and the
[36:15] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[36:19] it and I will give unto thee the keys of
[36:24] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[36:26] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[36:29] in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt
[36:32] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[36:35] amen let's go to 2nd Peter chapter 1
[36:48] Peter chapter one I start at verse um
[37:10] it's not at verse 4 whereby given unto
[37:17] you
[37:17] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[37:19] great and precious promises that by
[37:24] these you might be particularly divine
[37:27] nature having escaped the corruption
[37:29] that is in the world through lust and
[37:32] besides this giving all diligence add to
[37:35] your faith virtue and to your virtue
[37:37] knowledge into your knowledge
[37:39] temperature temperance and to your
[37:41] temperance patience and to patience
[37:43] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[37:45] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[37:47] charity for if these things be in you
[37:50] and abound they make you that ye shall
[37:54] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[37:58] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ he
[38:01] made me the Lord of blessing to the
[38:03] reading of his words you can have your
[38:05] seats I mean I want to use for a subject
[38:10] today the foundation of man the
[38:14] foundation of man you know it's uh I
[38:18] believe that we're in very crucial times
[38:21] and I think as a Christian what we need
[38:25] to do is reflect on our foundation you
[38:29] know and and when it comes to God you
[38:32] know when we look at the scriptures
[38:33] especially here in Matthew the 16th
[38:35] chapter you know he asked him a question
[38:38] he says who do men say that I am and
[38:41] some said that he was trying to Baptist
[38:44] and some said that he was Jeremiah or
[38:47] what Elias or one of the prophets you
[38:51] know the the way they thought about
[38:53] Jesus was they compared him to another
[38:56] man you know but when Christ was spawned
[39:00] to them he said all that's fine
[39:01] and he says but who do you say I am
[39:04] because when they responded to Christ
[39:07] you know asking him Who am I
[39:09] all they can do is reflect on what
[39:11] somebody else is saying and in this time
[39:14] we need to be sure
[39:16] hi leah of who we are and who we serve
[39:19] Amy and this is a time where our
[39:22] foundation has to be sturdy amen our
[39:25] foundation has to be solid and we can't
[39:28] build a foundation based upon the merits
[39:32] of mankind hallelujah our foundation has
[39:35] to be on something that's unmovable
[39:38] heylia that's unshakable that's
[39:40] unstoppable hallelujah and the only
[39:43] foundation on the face of the earth like
[39:45] that is the revelation of the Lord Jesus
[39:47] Christ earlier we are building on the
[39:50] flesh of Jesus because the flesh of
[39:52] Jesus was crucified earlier we build it
[39:55] on the revelation of who he is earlier
[39:58] because by revelation the prophet of God
[40:01] say Christ defeated the devil by simply
[40:04] knowing who he was earlier a man think
[40:08] about that trick if we could get a
[40:10] revelation of who we are Satan is
[40:12] defeated in your life hallelujah amen of
[40:16] you could get a revelation of who you
[40:18] serve do we get a revelation of who God
[40:21] is it can change your life this morning
[40:24] because the revelation of Jesus Christ
[40:27] hurry let's think about this foundation
[40:29] but let's go back to the foundation
[40:32] first everything starts with a
[40:34] foundation earlier the best thing you
[40:37] can build a foundation is upon something
[40:40] solid higher yeah and normally you just
[40:43] take a house or let's take this building
[40:45] this building had to be built upon a
[40:48] solid foundation because when winds come
[40:51] when in your case when blizzards come
[40:57] when atmosphere has changed in all these
[41:00] things this building had to be placed
[41:02] upon a foundation that would keep the
[41:05] building standing in perilous times
[41:07] hariya so the building higher you
[41:10] couldn't be resting alone upon sand Oh
[41:14] Oh burn strong open hallelujah would it
[41:17] had to be something that was stronger
[41:20] than all those elements hurry up and
[41:22] once the foundation was in a place to
[41:25] where it was sturdy where it was solid
[41:28] way it was provable that's the thing
[41:32] about it you can't just lay it down it
[41:35] has to be provable hallelujah it has to
[41:38] be able to go through the tests it has
[41:40] to hurry you go through all the tests of
[41:43] the instructor or the inspector haymann
[41:46] and if the foundation is solid then the
[41:49] building can go up oh yeah
[41:52] so what is the foundation of man huh
[41:55] the foundation in which we were built
[41:58] upon jesus said he said Asia and um hey
[42:03] hey man he said haruya it Matthew when
[42:08] he talked about the church you know they
[42:10] say that once a year a John the Baptist
[42:13] would say your lives here Maya you know
[42:15] one of the prophets and and and if we go
[42:18] and we look into those means life we
[42:21] find some kind of error although they
[42:25] were used by God we still find some kind
[42:28] of error earlier there was a time in
[42:30] John the Baptist life where he doubted
[42:32] that Jesus was the Messiah oh yeah so he
[42:36] can't build a church on that earlier on
[42:38] that man although he was you a man we
[42:41] can't build a church only Liza honey
[42:43] there was a point in his life where he
[42:46] was depressed
[42:48] Maria but he start to question how do
[42:51] you a man whether he was a man of God he
[42:54] was sitting up on his his he was
[42:56] sickening the cave and someone just
[42:58] worried about a woman chasing him we
[43:04] can't build a church upon that
[43:06] foundation honey you say Jeremiah we
[43:09] build a church upon Jeremiah well
[43:11] Jeremiah got to a place where Jeremiah
[43:13] say I quit
[43:15] hang creature no more the burden is too
[43:18] much hallelujah but we can't build a
[43:21] charge upon our quitting so we can't
[43:25] build a church upon the men
[43:28] four stations of great men holy and we
[43:32] have a message bosses of the Prophet but
[43:35] we are not built upon the life of
[43:37] William branham's
[43:40] the message hunter is not the life of
[43:43] random the message is the revelation of
[43:46] Jesus Christ that's what we're standing
[43:49] upon dr. foundation the foundation is
[43:52] not Jeffersonville the foundation is the
[43:59] revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[44:02] the foundation is not four walls Hurley
[44:06] the foundation is not a platform or
[44:08] church building Harley or a person for
[44:11] the foundation is the spiritually
[44:14] revealed truth in the heart of the
[44:16] believer Korea so we don't take anything
[44:21] away from great men earlier but we're
[44:25] building this foundation God built this
[44:28] foundation upon something that was
[44:31] unusable that was that will go P every
[44:35] test that we'll go through every child
[44:38] go through every situation and come out
[44:41] like gold that's what we are built upon
[44:48] honey that's what we standing on honey
[44:51] oh my the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[44:56] he said Simon Simon spoke out he said
[45:02] but who do you say I am and Simon said
[45:05] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[45:08] Living God
[45:09] now listen to the response of Christ
[45:11] Christ says Honoria flesh and blood have
[45:15] not revealed that till this revelation
[45:18] that we have earlier didn't come from a
[45:21] prophet
[45:25] Wow also appreciate the prophet of God
[45:30] what's been revealed to me I was built
[45:38] upon the foundation of Jesus Christ
[45:41] hallelujah he said blessed are You Simon
[45:45] bar Jonah for flesh and blood did not
[45:47] reveal this unto you how are you you he
[45:49] said what my father was in heaven
[45:51] revealed this unto you amen the only way
[45:54] hallelujah you could know Jesus I see
[45:56] Jesus is by Christ revealing himself to
[45:59] you no man has anything to do with it
[46:02] and you catch something out of this
[46:04] service today it wasn't me and my gift
[46:06] it's God talking to you it's God
[46:10] revealing himself when it's fake
[46:12] faith is a revelation what is Saint
[46:15] faith is when something is revealed to
[46:17] you oh yeah and the Bible says all I'm
[46:22] going to look too far you got back up
[46:26] higher getting it I'm getting into
[46:29] tonight amen oh yeah but but church you
[46:32] know when we look at this and we see the
[46:35] foundation let's let's let's go back and
[46:38] look at how powerful the foundation of
[46:41] man is I think sometimes as Christians
[46:43] we lightly esteem ourselves we lightly
[46:47] esteem that huh
[46:49] what the word Christian meaning means to
[46:51] be christ-like huh or to be called sons
[46:54] and daughters of God that means honey
[46:56] we're sons and does of God that means
[46:59] that we come from a heritage of God if
[47:04] we have a federal union it'll be filled
[47:07] up with God's in there right in that
[47:13] right when you go to a family unit
[47:15] kinfolk that's how we say back home folk
[47:18] its kinfolk Korea it's people who are
[47:22] related hungry some way down that family
[47:25] tree honey they're connected wholly to
[47:28] the father of that family honey that
[47:30] spread it see earlier and it all traces
[47:33] back earlier to the foundation hurry
[47:37] the chase is our way back to the first
[47:39] man who held that name three and you and
[47:43] i hurry
[47:44] coming from the family tree of Jesus
[47:47] Christ I can say over half is my brother
[47:50] I can say Paul is my brother I can say
[47:55] Astor is my sister Holly Rahab is my
[47:58] sister going because we all come from
[48:01] the same foundation oh yeah when you
[48:07] look at a tree it could produce food for
[48:09] years and years and years hallelujah but
[48:12] it had to start somewhere
[48:14] it started from a foundation it started
[48:17] from what one seed being planted in the
[48:20] ground and God planted one seed the seed
[48:25] of his word the seed of his life hariya
[48:29] and here we are today and that one see
[48:32] that one life has been gone for seven
[48:34] generations
[48:35] or should I say seven Church ages funny
[48:39] he never had to plant another seed or
[48:41] another vine is all coming off that one
[48:43] tree so tree of life oh yeah hey hey
[48:49] look at your foundation church what Paul
[48:54] preached came off the same tree further
[48:58] Hill the life that Moses lived came off
[49:01] the same tree the life that Abraham
[49:04] lived came off the same tree you take
[49:06] the greatest person in the Bible you
[49:08] come off that same tree hey same
[49:14] foundation hey man but you know when we
[49:16] look at it and we think about the
[49:17] foundation of man and just begin to
[49:19] encourage me well I got up this morning
[49:21] I was looking at like oh we're gonna
[49:23] speak on this morning that's just a life
[49:25] of evangelist hey man I wish I could I
[49:27] could sit back and study and everything
[49:29] come together like Jesse Harley I see I
[49:33] see y'all don't understand ministers
[49:35] look at each other and we wish we had
[49:36] the next man's gift but they wish I
[49:41] ain't made long why did you make that I
[49:43] was it long why did you make me like
[49:44] Jesse Bacchus studying and notes and
[49:47] everything come together and just
[49:49] illuminate that's not me
[49:51] you know so I have to come I have to
[49:53] come to place to where I'm confident and
[49:55] how God uses me hallelujah amen
[49:59] and you have to trust God oh yeah you
[50:04] have to trust God save oh yeah st. has
[50:07] an element of trusting but because faith
[50:10] can't see the outcome so in that moment
[50:13] you're trusting God these are the
[50:18] foundations of the man earlier but we
[50:22] look at our foundation I want to show
[50:24] you something so powerful you know you
[50:26] walk out of here today I want you to
[50:28] walk hurry you with your hand up high
[50:32] amen
[50:33] arrogant in the spirit not in a natural
[50:38] in the spirit so when you walk out in
[50:41] the world you walk past these demons
[50:42] these demons of seat you know who you
[50:44] are her the real with a person knows who
[50:48] they are they get treated different look
[50:55] and you know hit too much of this but
[50:58] you know we have all kind of supporters
[51:00] we got Trump supporters Obama supporters
[51:02] all these things but you know one thing
[51:04] that always caught me about Trump came
[51:06] in he was a man of confidence that's why
[51:09] he do what he does he's just a man of
[51:11] confidence and and he he has a certain
[51:14] arrogancy about him so you know always
[51:17] had the question that if he get elected
[51:19] to be President
[51:20] who's gonna tell him what to do and
[51:23] don't we see the results of that because
[51:27] he has he has his own ideas of who he is
[51:31] and nobody can tell him anything other
[51:34] than that and that's a man oh yeah in a
[51:40] natural room what about you and I you
[51:43] know that we are sons and daughters of
[51:45] God hey we ought to be able to walk up
[51:48] in the midst of our trials into
[51:50] relations and say devil
[51:51] I know Lamb
[51:57] Quarry to God I feel resurrection
[51:59] powering in this morning
[52:01] hallelujah glory Church but when God he
[52:05] built the church earlier he didn't he
[52:08] didn't have way doing I mean it wasn't
[52:09] quick fan he didn't build a church hurry
[52:13] or on the shifting sands of time he
[52:17] didn't build a church on the flesh of
[52:19] the ability of a man hey Lia will you go
[52:22] to Genesis wanted to he six he said let
[52:25] us create man in my image in my likeness
[52:29] holy just that's our foundation our
[52:32] foundation is the image and likeness of
[52:35] God you are not to settle for anything
[52:39] else when you go into prayer not to go
[52:42] in not as a sinner but as a god that
[52:48] demanding of God was in God I'm your
[52:50] child
[52:52] I'm your child and I want what you have
[52:56] for me one thing about being a child
[53:03] I'll put you in a spot Jesse one thing
[53:07] about being a child if you're a father I
[53:09] just used Malachi cuz he's the only boy
[53:12] Malachi comes to Jesse he says hey Dad I
[53:15] want a new bike I want the one with the
[53:19] paddles on the side the pedals on the
[53:22] back I want the lights I want the brakes
[53:25] up here and I wanted to be a ten-speed
[53:27] and if Jesse ever since okay son is over
[53:32] in Malachi's mine it's over he's daddy
[53:39] then told him now huh his faith is gonna
[53:42] rest in his father fulfilling that okay
[53:46] oh yeah see the foundation of that son
[53:51] huh is what he believes his father is
[53:57] that's what we're standing on holy we're
[54:00] standing on the revelation that our God
[54:02] created in the world
[54:04] we're standing on the revelation that
[54:06] our God
[54:08] can heal you from cancer amen our
[54:11] witness of that that revelation and God
[54:15] healed me from cancer so I'm here to say
[54:21] that that foundation is true is solid it
[54:24] cannot be moved its unshakable it's been
[54:29] tested it's been proven and it remains
[54:34] the same today oh yeah but you know it
[54:38] doesn't matter
[54:39] oh yeah because this faith is trusting
[54:43] in the revelation of who his father is
[54:46] so he's not gonna come to bring Jesse
[54:49] Hurley and say dad did you get 40 hours
[54:52] this week you're not worried about it
[54:57] my father told me yes close what is he
[55:01] basic his trust on what his father has
[55:04] already done Church to ask and receive
[55:13] is the same thing to do again to ask and
[55:16] receive him and that script has been
[55:18] holier dwelling in my heart he said you
[55:21] asked the father anything in my name he
[55:24] says I will do it what does anything
[55:28] mean without separation anything now
[55:35] that script is like that blow me away
[55:36] you know why because I believe it Kerli
[55:40] see with that those kind of scriptures
[55:42] how do you the devil can't come to you
[55:45] and say see he's not talking about your
[55:46] situation
[55:47] it says anything husband anything wife
[55:53] anything children anything whatsoever
[55:57] you ask he says I will do it and my
[56:04] problem is I'm going to God and prayer
[56:07] and say hey Lord you said yes I'm
[56:10] standing on the foundation these are not
[56:14] the words of any man hug these are not
[56:16] the words of shifting sands but these
[56:19] are the words heard of someone who
[56:21] proving it already like I said like I
[56:27] said Mallika's never come dad did you
[56:29] get it all the time
[56:30] cuz the bike I want it it's really nice
[56:34] you ain't just nice it's nice when I see
[56:39] it huh
[56:40] I see the reflectors and the seat and
[56:42] everything daddy is just nice honey
[56:47] you probably probably seen in a certain
[56:48] store hey Lou you and sister Smith don't
[56:51] realizable and she go to that store
[56:53] Malik I always say mommy cannot come
[56:56] because he want to look at the things
[57:00] his faith is hoping for honey
[57:02] but now holy his fact has the ability to
[57:06] touch it Oh to touch it and make it
[57:10] tangible in his life but he's trusting
[57:13] in his father to connect with his face
[57:16] Hey hellooo yeah that's what a prophet
[57:19] said when - I've never since meet honey
[57:22] the miraculous has to take place what is
[57:25] it is the revelation becoming material
[57:28] to God that's what I want in my life
[57:36] I won't substance me any word just to be
[57:43] faith of his faith is that these hopeful
[57:45] no there's a two parts in that scripture
[57:48] evidence evidence let's go back to the
[57:55] foundation but the foundation of you and
[57:58] I the foundation of us
[58:00] he's built on the image and likeness of
[58:03] God know what you ought to do I do this
[58:08] sometimes I get in the mirror I always
[58:10] say this to people I go to certain
[58:11] churches and you know I'm always running
[58:13] above the speed limit I'm talking
[58:17] spiritually funny I ain't talking about
[58:20] ideal in 77 I'm to my spiritually in the
[58:22] church I'm always going above the speed
[58:24] let me hug everybody else doing the
[58:26] casual you know they they riding in the
[58:28] law you know the law says we can only
[58:31] come to church and be prospective we
[58:33] don't want to be out of order and all
[58:35] these things
[58:35] I'm a law breaker yeah sometimes I like
[58:40] to jump out there and see what I can do
[58:43] hey hey I like to put the horsepower I
[58:46] want to know if this car this vehicle
[58:49] can really do what it's supposed to do
[58:51] we're didn't have a high performance
[58:53] vehicle and you've never tested out you
[58:59] just got something for show earlier but
[59:01] this word holier the lives we have we
[59:04] should be able to test it out we should
[59:07] be read as they got you said hey the
[59:11] foundation we built on you said like a
[59:14] week say on stole you saying that the
[59:16] poorest a rich you said this God and I'm
[59:21] gonna test it out oh yeah that's right
[59:25] when I pray I don't pray for small
[59:27] things I pray for miracles despite what
[59:33] you might be looking at honey my faith
[59:35] honey is the foundation of the building
[59:37] that's why honey
[59:39] second Peter it says honey head to your
[59:41] faith faith is the foundation without
[59:46] faith it is impossible to please the
[59:48] Lord hurry up is that God is the reward
[59:50] of those that diligently seek you
[59:54] so your faith has to be in action honey
[59:57] you know what I'm gonna place now honey
[59:59] well I'm not reasoning anymore with God
[1:00:04] anybody ever prayed in and and I'm sure
[1:00:08] most of all of us we prayed about things
[1:00:11] nothing has happened what do we do we
[1:00:14] say Oh Lord well I guess in a chore
[1:00:17] wheel how do you know that how do you
[1:00:21] know that unless God tell you
[1:00:24] amen when you pray like that and you act
[1:00:27] like that that means you're not standing
[1:00:29] on the foundation because we're standing
[1:00:32] on a solid foundation of children of God
[1:00:36] hey let's realize something
[1:00:39] Adam how you was created in their image
[1:00:42] Adam had constant fellowship with God
[1:00:46] constant fellowship with God now you and
[1:00:49] I
[1:00:49] created in the same image so why should
[1:00:52] we have constant fellowship with God God
[1:00:56] was so mindful of Adam God could look at
[1:00:59] him and say hey Adams lonely Adam didn't
[1:01:04] ask God for anything he was just so
[1:01:06] connected with God God could feel where
[1:01:10] he was going he is that God created me a
[1:01:14] woman now oh yeah
[1:01:15] oh that's on the foundation god knows
[1:01:18] what you're going through
[1:01:23] that's what I want to be change I would
[1:01:25] be so connected with God hallelujah that
[1:01:28] before I can even ask God's putting
[1:01:30] things into motion that's what he did
[1:01:34] but you know you say we're buddies we're
[1:01:37] in a foundation fail
[1:01:40] Adam fail yeah Adam fail man fail but
[1:01:43] not the foundation the foundation stayed
[1:01:47] the same that's why God told him and Eve
[1:01:50] honey to strive to get back to this
[1:01:52] place
[1:01:52] hallelujah hey man he said I'm gonna put
[1:01:55] guards there hey man hallelujah that you
[1:01:57] say you can't just walk back in here
[1:01:59] your life's got to be right you gotta be
[1:02:02] worthy hardly to stand on this
[1:02:04] foundation again this is like I said as
[1:02:07] the president hugly III may not agree
[1:02:10] with a trunk I mean I agree with Trump
[1:02:14] but Trump has a certain platform that I
[1:02:17] can't stand on because of his natural
[1:02:22] position and I have a platform that he
[1:02:26] can't stand on because of my spiritual
[1:02:31] position we have a platform that cannot
[1:02:37] be shaken okay
[1:02:43] he says upon this I will build my church
[1:02:46] clearly not hallelujah the knowledge of
[1:02:50] men but the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] and you look at how each man each
[1:02:57] individual steward on that revelation
[1:03:00] and look at the results they got we take
[1:03:05] somebody like Moses who didn't want to
[1:03:07] be a deliverer but that was a part of
[1:03:09] the platform Moses standing on that
[1:03:16] platform hardly he could go down into
[1:03:19] the kingdom of Egypt and demand liberty
[1:03:23] because he's good on the platform in
[1:03:26] which God made him which was a deliverer
[1:03:31] and now he's standing there on that
[1:03:33] foundation hi Leah and Moses yes all
[1:03:36] these human questions he has all these
[1:03:40] human reasonings like the disciples had
[1:03:42] in Matthew 16 some say now like this
[1:03:45] some say now is that some say some say
[1:03:47] something here's Moses coming to God
[1:03:49] with the saying some Saint well you know
[1:03:51] Lord I can't talk but we know Lord
[1:03:53] they're gonna say this about me and you
[1:03:55] don't know what's you who should I say
[1:03:57] see me and all these things and gauzy
[1:03:58] shut up I'm sorry children you know
[1:04:01] you're not supposed to say that but God
[1:04:06] tells Moses be quiet
[1:04:07] he said who made man's mouth and then
[1:04:13] God puts him back on the platform honey
[1:04:16] he says hey you looking at her own he
[1:04:19] says hey hey
[1:04:20] I want you is that will Aaron to be your
[1:04:23] prospect and you be God to the people so
[1:04:26] he put Moses back color back into what
[1:04:29] he created in Genesis 1:26
[1:04:39] oh my church and that's what he's always
[1:04:43] done when the platform looked like honey
[1:04:46] the platform is the foundation stays
[1:04:48] sturdy but sometimes we get off of it
[1:04:50] and God comes back in hey let me put you
[1:04:53] back where you belong surely he did that
[1:04:56] throughout the times a man remember
[1:04:58] David David David got in trouble and
[1:05:00] David fell God in him but you know God
[1:05:03] constantly pushed him back on the
[1:05:05] platform
[1:05:06] push him back on the foundation
[1:05:08] he said you know what David you're a man
[1:05:11] after my very own heart
[1:05:12] oh yeah and God did that through the
[1:05:15] generations and even like I said when
[1:05:18] John the Baptist got poured of God's
[1:05:19] sake go back and tell John what you see
[1:05:21] he'll put him back on the platform with
[1:05:25] Elijah hallelujah got all messed up he
[1:05:27] was in the cave and all these things oh
[1:05:28] god Ravens and birds and things to
[1:05:31] feed him huh they let him know he was
[1:05:33] with him huh
[1:05:35] but yeah my earlier get all depressed
[1:05:38] and the stars God came down and started
[1:05:40] stirring in his heart then Jeremiah say
[1:05:42] he's like fire shut up in my bones okay
[1:05:46] yeah but stand on this foundation Jesus
[1:05:54] comes to the disciples over me and say
[1:05:55] I'm the Christ he says flesh and blood
[1:05:58] have not revealed this on you Peter he
[1:06:00] says but huh
[1:06:01] my father's in heaven he says and upon
[1:06:03] this rock hurry
[1:06:06] rock me from elationship oh yeah he said
[1:06:09] the Catholic Church says is Peter no it
[1:06:11] can't be Peter how do you know why
[1:06:13] because even after Peter got that
[1:06:15] revelation he had lying in him he had
[1:06:20] cussing in him he had denial in him with
[1:06:25] that revelation of the Christ that's why
[1:06:28] you can't count nobody out this person
[1:06:34] got the message this brother I'll hold
[1:06:36] up let's see if God gonna put them back
[1:06:39] on the platform and see God gonna put
[1:06:42] them back earlier on the foundation
[1:06:44] again honey because the foundation ain't
[1:06:46] going away
[1:06:47] we always need the foundation he was
[1:06:50] just like honey God told holy Santos
[1:06:53] Sampson saying I would give you a vow I
[1:06:56] mean your foundation that lives by her
[1:06:57] don't cut your hair
[1:06:59] stay stay right with your Nazarite
[1:07:01] Philemon now when Samson got thrown out
[1:07:03] hurry
[1:07:04] he left the foundation but the
[1:07:06] foundation was still there while he was
[1:07:08] in prison
[1:07:09] crying in hugs but he's in prison
[1:07:11] working bills latter day the foundation
[1:07:14] stayed the same you know one day he got
[1:07:16] back on the foundation
[1:07:20] he got back on what God created him to
[1:07:23] be huh Leah hey man I deliver I'll
[1:07:26] destroy her foundation didn't move
[1:07:32] stayed the same and the Bible says he
[1:07:35] destroyed more Phyllis ties that day
[1:07:37] then he did the whole time he was with
[1:07:40] it all you got to do is be what God
[1:07:42] wants you to be hallelujah
[1:07:46] but we look and you know we say we're
[1:07:50] standing on the revelation of Jesus
[1:07:51] Christ I want you to think about that
[1:07:53] think about who you serve and why are
[1:07:57] you going through trials and
[1:07:58] tribulations acts yourself is there any
[1:08:01] error in the foundation is there any
[1:08:06] cracks in it is it chipping away no it's
[1:08:12] perfect
[1:08:15] this thing we're standing on is perfect
[1:08:18] the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:08:21] greater than Allah clearer than Buddha
[1:08:25] haruya greater than two fishes or
[1:08:27] whatever other God that they say they
[1:08:29] got the foundation of Jesus Christ is
[1:08:32] unmovable unshakable it's so powerful
[1:08:37] Church that he he wanted to put us on
[1:08:41] the foundation he did it in such a way
[1:08:43] that our era holy wouldn't stop us from
[1:08:46] remaining there because like I said
[1:08:50] Peter lies Peter Peter Peter said all
[1:08:53] kind of things you know he cursed and
[1:08:55] everything and church even in that
[1:08:58] moment when Peter look like he was
[1:09:00] failing God he still was you see my mind
[1:09:09] you see my mama according to God he was
[1:09:12] still in the foundation now peeling
[1:09:14] himself may have saw himself in the
[1:09:16] natural not standing for God but God had
[1:09:19] it all playing out that way and
[1:09:20] something I want to say to you that
[1:09:22] color we see mistakes we see people have
[1:09:24] error and all these things Peter in all
[1:09:26] his error and everything else before he
[1:09:29] got to his error God had already given
[1:09:31] the keys of the key lying had the keys
[1:09:42] cutscene Lena Headey keeps denying Peter
[1:09:47] had the keys
[1:09:49] the foundation is unmovable psycho-boy
[1:09:57] unchangeable and despite what the world
[1:10:00] thought about him he had the key to the
[1:10:02] key he lied he does he thank God I sit
[1:10:10] back saying don't worry I pray for you
[1:10:12] God is in control
[1:10:22] he's in control about the closed church
[1:10:25] but but but we think about Holly was
[1:10:28] standing on the rock who is that rock
[1:10:31] that rock is Jesus Christ under the
[1:10:33] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:34] spiritually revealed truth amen and you
[1:10:37] look at how that truth holier got color
[1:10:40] in the Saints of Oh
[1:10:41] through all their battles because the
[1:10:44] foundation remains the same that's why
[1:10:48] when the Prophet Hurley was like they're
[1:10:50] hunting for squirrels honey he start to
[1:10:53] doubt himself that's why I said we don't
[1:10:54] base hariya
[1:10:56] our livelihood on what honey or who
[1:10:58] brother Branham is no we base it upon
[1:11:02] the word that he brought the word that
[1:11:06] was preached early and I say this to you
[1:11:08] honey that this message is no good to
[1:11:11] you unless you mix it with faith so you
[1:11:19] have to take this message and put it on
[1:11:21] the right foundation it's no good just
[1:11:26] saying brother Branham said cuz that's
[1:11:30] my faith oh you're just in agreeance but
[1:11:34] faith is honey-producing what he said
[1:11:38] manifesting what he said or showing what
[1:11:41] he said in your life
[1:11:44] hey cuz remember Holly Melbourne was a
[1:11:47] man hurry Leah and you can't you know I
[1:11:50] was just preaching the wave offering you
[1:11:52] know a lot of people a lot of people
[1:11:53] saying and believe that they believed
[1:11:56] brother Brennan was out wave offering I
[1:11:57] don't agree with that that's just me
[1:11:59] Hurley because if he was our wave
[1:12:01] offering that means you can lie before
[1:12:03] God and it'll be all right that's the
[1:12:08] kind of thing that we want to say we
[1:12:10] that's kind of free we want to say
[1:12:12] coming out d'Avignon remember he said
[1:12:14] hey tell them I'm not here and he with
[1:12:16] that did it happen
[1:12:22] there was a time in his ministry well he
[1:12:25] got so sick of people rejecting him that
[1:12:28] he started calling people Ricky's and
[1:12:30] Rick Etta and God had to rebuke him is
[1:12:32] that what we're waving before the people
[1:12:37] come on telephone suit of that vineyard
[1:12:41] the foundation has to be Jesus Christ
[1:12:47] cuz there's no era that's why you can
[1:12:50] waive that before the people and say
[1:12:52] everything come out of this vineyard is
[1:12:54] gonna be like that there's a point in
[1:13:01] the province like when he wanted to
[1:13:03] commit suicide not Jesus I I like to
[1:13:10] bring I like for everything we believe
[1:13:12] the tie into this and I'm not saying
[1:13:16] that the proper wasn't a great man honey
[1:13:18] yeah but if I waive him before me I'm
[1:13:20] waiving flesh he went in the Bible says
[1:13:24] honey flesh and blood shall not inherit
[1:13:27] the kingdom of God it has to be a spirit
[1:13:30] and really spirit that came loose earth
[1:13:33] that was perfect was the Lord Jesus
[1:13:35] Christ
[1:13:36] so I'm gonna waive that before me
[1:13:39] hallelujah yeah Lord that's what I would
[1:13:41] love for all the fruits of my life to be
[1:13:43] like
[1:13:47] well you can get tired you say
[1:13:50] nevertheless not my will that I will be
[1:13:52] done
[1:13:53] a man we have to look at the profit and
[1:13:57] see that he was a man honey he got tired
[1:14:01] they meant all the things like we see in
[1:14:03] John the Baptist and Elijah and and and
[1:14:07] the different ones that when they said
[1:14:09] we see huh he said who the men saying
[1:14:13] they say well John you know they say uh
[1:14:16] he lies the only thing brother Brennan
[1:14:17] went through those stages he went
[1:14:20] through stage where he was depressed
[1:14:21] honey he went through stages where he
[1:14:23] quit preachers huh
[1:14:27] he with the stages huh well he ran
[1:14:29] because he got tired of explaining what
[1:14:31] he believed he went through early stages
[1:14:34] but just like Jesus said who do men say
[1:14:37] I am just that's where we are who do men
[1:14:42] say we are Hollow who do mean honey who
[1:14:45] ye honey say these messages hey doctor
[1:14:51] Christ three so when I look at this
[1:14:57] message I see Jesus I don't see a man

[1:15:05] all about and the foundation is
[1:15:08] spiritually revealed truth now what I'm

[1:18:17] begin to examine and examine and examine
[1:18:19] and examine you know what they were
[1:18:21] examining while I was examining him
[1:18:23] there was examining his foundation that
[1:18:32] was something greater than his body

[1:19:15] everybody this family all his friends
[1:19:17] meet all of us we know that he's gone
[1:19:19] because it was his time not because he
[1:19:22] was sick huh because God holy P again
[1:19:28] that the foundation of Isaiah 53 is
[1:19:31] still remaining strong and the gates of
[1:19:37] hell honey in my closing church when
[1:19:47] things are going on in our lives and do
[1:19:49] things let's examine our foundation
[1:19:51] because your foundation is weak the
[1:19:54] building this week Hurricane Florence
[1:19:58] and all these places can come in and he
[1:20:00] can pour and pour and pour a lot of the
[1:20:02] things that we get lasted through the
[1:20:05] flood because the foundation hallelujah
[1:20:09] foundation remain strong a little water
[1:20:12] might get in but the bills are still
[1:20:13] standing
[1:20:16] oh yeah we might have a little struggle
[1:20:20] a little trial a little just a little
[1:20:21] debt but it's the building still
[1:20:23] standing huh if the foundation is still
[1:20:27] strong hallelujah and and we had to ask
[1:20:29] a question when I was standing on such
[1:20:32] I'm even encouraging myself today
[1:20:33] hug hug it then as we go through trials
[1:20:36] and tribulations we have to sit down
[1:20:38] take a deep breath as a thought I'm
[1:20:42] standing on you I'm standing on
[1:20:48] hallelujah
[1:20:49] it doesn't matter what it looked like
[1:20:51] right now huh I'm standing on a
[1:20:52] foundation that cannot be moved you
[1:20:57] think about you know the next storm that
[1:21:00] we may have on or the next trial you may
[1:21:04] have if the foundation is strong
[1:21:06] building ain't going nowhere
[1:21:08] and sometimes you've seen a building get
[1:21:11] tore down but the foundation still stays
[1:21:16] hey hey man so it's all right to get a
[1:21:20] little beat up sometimes the longer the
[1:21:22] foundation is there you can always
[1:21:24] reveal and a lot of times we revealed
[1:21:28] you reveal stronger cream and you reveal
[1:21:33] tough for her and sometimes and then the
[1:21:36] rebuilding process is so good you make
[1:21:38] it bigger you add some things that you
[1:21:43] didn't already have unless they add to
[1:21:45] your faith or your knowledge knowledge
[1:21:48] chipperz chipperz patient hire you add
[1:21:51] to that building
[1:21:53] Kaluga that's what we need to do Church
[1:21:56] as we grow in Christ just remember that
[1:21:58] the foundation and going away in the
[1:22:00] foundation his faith was standing upon
[1:22:03] how God
[1:22:04] Hurley originally created us to be in
[1:22:07] His image and likeness
[1:22:10] that's what we're spending on come on
[1:22:13] brothers are musicians I'm closing amen
[1:22:15] huh and I just love the party says in
[1:22:18] the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[1:22:21] against it now ain't that just a
[1:22:24] wonderful consolation that no matter how
[1:22:27] he'll die he didn't say here won't fight
[1:22:29] he say
[1:22:30] prevail and church I preached the
[1:22:35] message one time call get your mind
[1:22:37] right get your mind right cuz sometimes
[1:22:41] you can be in a battle and you think you
[1:22:44] losing know the battles making you
[1:22:45] stronger that's what the battle is all
[1:22:48] about a person that lives waits they
[1:22:51] don't live wait to get weekly live ways
[1:22:52] to get stronger but you have to the
[1:22:54] process of lifting weights you have the
[1:22:56] channels muscles down and as they build
[1:22:59] back up they get stronger then you can
[1:23:01] lift more weight and that's what God
[1:23:03] does in trials and tribulations we go
[1:23:05] through things that we think oh why am I
[1:23:08] going through this cuz he want to make
[1:23:09] you stronger just standing on the right
[1:23:15] foundation see cuz God he doesn't bring
[1:23:17] tests and trials for failure
[1:23:20] that's not his way what he's trying to
[1:23:23] do is show you what else is on that
[1:23:25] foundation show you what else how do you
[1:23:28] show you what kind of building you can
[1:23:30] be I mean I like brick buildings Carly

[1:23:47] can add that all of us are part of the
[1:23:49] beauty hey man that's what we won't
