========================================

past I've tried to keep it a little shorter on Wednesday night so let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 3 I'd like to preach a part uh S I believe it's either seven or six I kind of forgot but 1 Corinthians 3 ver one we finish chapter 2 on Sunday so I want to pick up here on chapter three 1 Corinthians chapter 3 Hallelujah if you're there say amen amen let's read uh one two and three I'll read one and two then we can all read three together here how many believe every word of this is thus sayith the Lord I believe that I believe the B Bible's the infallible source of of all truth hallelujah verse one says and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ verse two I have fed you with milk and not with meat for wither too ye were not able to Bear it neither yet now are ye able let's read verse three together ready 1 2 3 for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated that's quite a Thanksgiving text isn't it hallelujah hallelujah I'm really not preaching on Thanksgiving today I'm just trying to I've preached on that before over the years I've been preaching from this Pulpit 18 years so not every holiday do I preach a Thanksgiving or Christmas message or uh I always do a Easter and Good Friday but not every other holiday like you know July 4th or something like that uh although we're very thankful for our independence Hallelujah we want to be thankful in all things but I don't really have a Thanksgiving message I mean it may turn out to be that and at the end I may read through that just a short list of some of the testimonies from this year what a blessing uh this year has been by God's grace but I want to um read through a few verses here and uh preach a little bit let me set a timer and I can try to get us out here on a good time the Lord willing as as God would lead us here so praise the Lord so verse one says and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as babes in Christ Hallelujah so I just want to back up real briefly chapter 2 we looked at uh Sunday proclaiming Christ crucified you know when St Paul was preaching to new people especially sinners like in Athens he said he tried to preach Christ and him crucified Paul we saw it on Sunday Paul didn't go into the depths of predestination or even the depths of the godhead or any of the depths of the Jew and Gentile uh dispensation you know the church ages Paul didn't go into any of that he stayed with repentance Hallelujah repentance from sins and knowing that Jesus Christ died was buried resurrected and everyone will stand before the Judgment seat of Christ Hallelujah he kept it very basic uh he said yes you're The Offspring of God he said but you're too superstitious so Paul when he when he preached to to Sinners he told them some of their mistakes not all of them of course you know he didn't have time to do that but he told them some of their mistakes and he said the solution is the Gospel of Jesus Christ the good news Hallelujah so we saw how Paul was so humble uh uh and sometimes there was Miracles when he preached a groups sometimes there wasn't now what's interesting isn't this interesting he was when he was preaching to the Athenians God didn't do any Miracles there because they were so intellectual right the Bible records no Miracles but when he preaches to a bunch of ignoramuses we'd say on the island of Mita God heals every one of them with Supernatural Miracles Hallelujah it just goes to show church sometimes the hardest people to preach to are the intellectual ones they know so much right but they know so much of the wrong thing they've gotten so intellectual that they have no faith in the Living God right but it just goes to show let's be humble who wants childlike Faith here tonight praise God God keep us humble yes there's deep seen things of God we'll get into that tonight there is a time for the Deep things of God but there there's also a time for the elementary things of God as well Hallelujah just when the the timing is right and the holy spirit's leading it Hallelujah so we looked at chapter 2 on Sunday we he proclaimed Christ crucified amongst the the Corinthian Church which was a very intellectual Church they were a very uh large Church uh Jesus said you he said I have much people in this city so this was a large church and remember they had all nine gifts of the holy spirit Paul said you don't lack in any gift they had all nine gifts operating which was amazing you know we've seen all nine operate but they don't all operate you know at the same time it's spread out over numerous years but it seems like the Corinthian Church had all nine of them operating but they also had a lot of carnal things going on right they were suing people they were arguing who is the greatest preacher and who baptized me and who baptized you uh one of the man had a sexual immorality sleeping with his stepmother and wouldn't even repent to the church you had uh just so many awful things going on people getting drunk before communion this was just it was a it was a good church in some ways but a there was a lot of a lot of sin in the church as well and so Paul you know tried to come just in the humility of Christ preaching Christ crucified and then he says the wisdom of the Holy Spirit takes you into the deep things of God and it helps you judge all things the holy spirit will help us tonight by God's grace to look at our lives and judge our lives uh is my life uh as close as I possibly can uh to obeying Jesus Christ is my life does my life glorify Christ as much as it should we're all at different states you know uh in serving the lord you know some of us are more mature than others some of us a little more younger in the faith you know and we just thank God Wherever We Are Tonight we thank God he called us out of the world Hallelujah so we don't compare ourselves with ourselves we compare ourselves to Christ Hallelujah We compare our Christ you know where what does Christ show me uh what truth should I know what should I be living uh God wants us to live what we've heard Hallelujah we've seen it in the Bible God doesn't ask anybody to do anything that that uh that they don't know about right you know God only asked us to live what he showed us hallelujah and so we look here in in in in chapter 3 verse one I'll break into this now here just briefly just a very short introduction um he says you are babes under Christ he can now think about that a prophet of God a a prophet like Paul couldn't preach to their church as spiritual he had to PR preach to them like their spiritual babies What a Sad condition that is and again because they're suing people the rich people think they're better they're getting drunk they're sleeping around sexual immorality they're suing people like this is a very immature church this is not a spiritual church but the opposite is true too if we're not suing each other if we're living sexually pure if we're not getting drunk then we're a mature church amen hallelujah that makes me happy amen because I know we're a mature Church by God's grace it's not judged by how many people are there it's judged by how much you love Jesus because Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my commands so it's the it's not the the size of the church it's how much the church loves Christ and how much the church obeys Christ so you know as we would admit yes there's churches all around us but they're all judged by the word the spirit God says uh the spirit of God judges each person and leads them to judge their life according to the promis is the commands of God is my life obedient to the commands of Christ but he said Paul says you know this Corinthian Church you're carnal he says you're not mature you're babes in Christ and babe means the infant these are baby Christians yet they got tongues they got interpretation they got prophecy they got words of wisdom words of knowledge they got miracles uh they got discernment they got all these things and yet they're babies imagine imagine uh uh uh imagine if if if if in the nursery you know let's say in a little bit you know we have some babies over there imagine if somebody came in there and said let's say we got little uh Adena in there right let's say we got the future baby sarpong in there and then the future baby Smith imagine if I walked in there okay it's time to teach you babies now it's time to preach to you the gospel what could I teach him not much I could teach him you don't want to be around a guy like me you want to be around your mama that's all I could teach him right you don't want to be around a smelly guy guy like me spitting and you know spitting and stuttered all over the place that's all I could teach him and that's what Paul was walking into Paul was walking into a church of babies now what could he teach them not very much right clean up your lives don't live sexual immor immorally you know don't Sue each other don't think you're better than anybody stop arguing about who the greatest preacher is right this is the kind of church he walked into and God again God help us to be a mature Church Hallelujah I'm thankful church I am thankful he they they're they're babies in Christ they're infants they're childish untaught unskilled in the gospel so again whoever that Pastor was of the Corinthian Church I hope he got saved because he sure wasn't very mature if he allowed all these things to happen and he never tried to correct it he never tried to pull people side said listen you shouldn't do this this is a very sinful thing to do Christians shouldn't do this oh what a what a sad condition but again at the beginning he says thank God remember the chapter one he says thank God grace and peace be multiplied to you yet he still was positive with them there's Hope For You Hallelujah There's Hope for little babies right to grow up and be mature someday of course there's hope and so the same thing is spiritual if the natural is true babies in the nursery There's Hope for them to grow up then surely There's Hope for the spiritual babies Hallelujah that they'll grow up so Paul had to talk to them like their babies and uh you we we know churches like that right we know churches like that they might have gifts and shouting and loud music and miracles but if they have sin in their lives and they're not uh they're not getting the sin out of their lives they let the sin continue then they're spiritual babies right and thank God for the gifts right but we we saw the greatest gift you can have is what church love okay couple people remember the sermon from two weeks ago okay glory to God the greatest gift you can have is love love is greater than Faith and Hope Charity is the greatest gift you can have you can speak to Every Mountain in your life every obstacle you can speak to it it'll move Miracle after Miracle every person you lay hands on they're healed you can give all your money away you can do all these things but if you don't do it with love it doesn't profit the church anything it's got to be with the love of God in other words what is love love is interest in the other person's well-being and not your own that's what love must be that's what praying for praying for the sick is giving money away the interest of them not my not my interest but the interest of the other person how can I make their life better that's real Christianity verse two I have fed you with milk so Paul could only preach milk messages which are okay if that's what they need and not with meat for hither to you were not able to Bear it neither yet are yet now are ye able so Paul as a prophet could look at the church and say okay you got all these things going on suing people uh greatest of goat arguments who's the greatest of all time sexual sin okay I'm not able to preach deep things yet till you get your life cleaned up right in other words no matter how deep I could preach or Paul no matter how deep Paul could preach and tell you these mysteries of God which we we know the mysteries of God we've seen them it's not really going to help you unless you have sin out of your life it's not going to encourage you it's not going to strengthen you at all if the man keeps sleeping with his stepmom whe whether he knows about predestination or the godhead or baptism that's not going to help him until he gets the desire for sexual sin out of his heart right he's probably on the way to hell right we don't know I mean only God knows the people's hearts if he doesn't get the sexual sin out or the pride I'm better I'm richer I'm better than these poor people in the church oh it's okay for me to get drunk and it's okay for me to drink alcohol till I'm tipsy until you get the sin out and nothing else that that's important uh that that's a deep mystery of God none of that's going to help you because you're o you're given over to evil spirits everybody see that so that's why Paul says I'm not going to preach these Deep Thoughts like I can do to other churches because there's too much sin in the church so again this might be a Thanksgiving message Hallelujah it might make us thankful that God is cleaning out our lives Hallelujah now the word milk means it's a metaphor uh in the Greek for less difficult Christian truths so Paul you know in this in this book he gets down to it you know he talks about well now if your tongue's interpretation only do it if there's an interpreter in the in the church now he said you can speak in tongues as much as you want at home I never have but I I have numerous friends who have and I'm thankful for that I prayed to God and asked God let me speak in tonu but God won't let me do it that's fine I'll wait maybe later on in life Hallelujah maybe one day uh but he says now now it's less difficult it's very easy just do two at the most three in a church service right he started giving them some simple things okay just three okay don't go 5 10 15 20 30 just go three he's trying slowly brings brings them easy things to fix in the church and remember with this man in sexual sin what'd he say he said don't even let him come in the church kick him out of the church and give him over to Satan that his body might be destroyed so that Satan destroy his health kind of like what happened to job but of course job didn't do anything wrong right he was just being tested but this man who did the sexual sin give him over to Satan let let Satan take his health away so that his soul could be saved that in that in that position of laying in a hos hosital or laying in a whatever a drug house on your back and dying whatever it be in that moment he could repent of his sins and actually get saved Hallelujah Paul wasn't playing games with sin he didn't play games with sin in the church but that that's a it's a less difficult thing than than getting into the deeper things of God with Revelation and the mysteries of God like we've been preaching on the Rapture that's a mystery that's very difficult for many people understand because you have to know know the secrets of God the mystery of the revelation of God you have to know the mind of God the timeline of God the understanding of God's terms and definitions you have to know that it's a deeper thing but why would why would Paul preach about the Rapture if the people are living in sexual sin they're not even ready for the Rapture first they got to get cleaned up so they can be ready for the Rapture so you know there's there's deeper truths of the Christian faith that are hard to understand yet the spirit of God searches the Deep things of God it searches all things so see that's why we got to spend we got to keep spending a lot of time in the word of God right we got to search the scriptures I'm reading through uh Ezekiel it's been a tremendous blessing I'm amazed at all that God had Ezekiel prophesy I just read in chapter 23 uh and and and God said thus sayith the Lord Ezekiel tell them all their Abominations in their sight and so he names uh sexual sin adultery uh abortion basically burning babies is what they did back then they burn the babies as a sacrifice to a false god and he names uh they're taking too much interest on people like all these Abominations he just lays them out and I'm like if that isn't America I don't know what is right right but thank God there's a small Remnant God always protects the remnant praise God that even though most people are giving over to sin that doesn't discourage me because I know God always protects those that want to live holy Hallelujah God will not the suff God will not suffer the righteous to be punished with the the wicked Hallelujah so we're encouraged Hallelujah God sees our our our efforts to please him and love him God sees it Hallelujah and you know uh and brother brandom you know the prophet that we believe God sent to this generation of course passed away in 1965 he said the meat doctrines were like predestination out of Romans chapter 8 speaks of predestination election is a meat Doctrine it's a meat Doctrine it's a very uh thick it's a it's a hard understanding thing to understand takes a lot of chewing a lot of thinking a lot of praying CU we we're either drinking milk or chewing the meat of the word of God also sitting in Heavenly places and all the writings Paul wrote to the Ephesian Church those were deep Mysteries like the mystery of the Jew and Gentile they used to be two separate now they're one church that's a deep that's a deep teaching it's a deep understanding because a lot of people think oh God's just done with Israel and Israel is the synagogue of Satan you know they misunderstand scriptures in the Book of Revelation now most of Israel's lost just like mes most of the Gentiles are lost but Israel will have a a faithful remnant of 144,000 the Bible tells us that in Revelation 7 Hallelujah so again there's a remnant of Israel there's a remnant of the Gentiles there's always a small group that really love God and really want to please him Hallelujah there are deep things of course many deep things uh the the writer of Hebrews the author of Hebrews said the same thing we believe it was likely Paul because he says almost the same thing um he said the Hebrews there couldn't handle the Deep teachings like MDC right that's a deep teaching uh on the godhead and Hebrews 5 and chapter 6 list some Elementary teachings so I would like AAA if you put that up there Hebrews 5:14 up there thank you hun and so Paul We believe this is Paul I'm not going to argue about it with anybody because he doesn't say his name in the letter but uh just it looks like the very same language but strong meat belongeth to them who are full age even those who by reason of their senses are exercised to discern between good and evil so other words a mature Christian in their everyday life they're constantly trying to figure out is this good or is this evil that's a mature Christian but the Christian that just goes headlong into sin that's an immature Christian that's a baby Christian they just think oh it's okay for me to uh get drunk it's okay to me for me to have sexual immorality it's okay for me to think I'm greater and debate who's the greatest preacher forever it's okay for me to sue people I mean that's that's uh immaturity right that that's a that's a baby Christian chapter 6 verse one uh two and three give us six these are baby doctrines here but again I want to remind you this so you can see it six baby doctrines therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works that's the first baby Doctrine you can't be a Christian say well it's okay for me to sin Jesus Loves Me no you have to repent from your dead Works Hallelujah and that's what most churches don't even get that baby Doctrine they let them smoke drink get drunk do drugs adultery marri two three four times you know they just they never get over that they never get over that they let them cuss and swear watch filthy movies uh I mean they just never even get to this Elementary teaching uh Paul said he that names the name of the he that names the name of Christ let him depart from iniquity if you call if you call yourself by Christ's name Christian then leave all sin and the church said a Christian wants to leave all sin because the sin is what had been put on Christ that sin is what caused to be crucified our Lord was bruised because of the sin so so sin breaks our heart and we don't want to sin we don't want to uh we we we don't want to partake in the the works of darkness we want to live a holy life we want to please Jesus Hallelujah second is Faith toward God most people have faith toward their church or faith towards their finances right they trust in their finances most people trust in their finances or their preacher your faith is not in me your faith is not in the song leader or the S you know the musician your faith should be in Jesus Christ Alone hallelujah amen you hang around long enough I'm going to upset you I'm going to uh I'm going to let you down but Jesus Will Never Let You Down Hallelujah and guess what you'll let me down too not just me it works both ways Hallelujah we all fall short of God's Glory Hallelujah that's why our faith must be in Christ yes we honor one another we always give honor but our ultimate faith our trust TR faith is trust or Assurance our Assurance is in Jesus Christ alone that's the second and see that's is elementary and baptism there's at least three baptisms there's the baptism of the mind that's what the Old Testament Saints had the Bible said that they were filled with the spirit in the Old Testament then there's a baptism of the soul in the New Testament and then there's the water baptism there's more than one baptism and most churches don't even know that right they don't even know they're just babes they don't know it doesn't matter if I'm baptized or not doesn't even matter how I'm baptized what does it matter Jesus died for me he loves me that's true but Jesus has Doctrine too Jesus has instruction for you Jesus wants to teach you he said and Jesus said remember in the Great Commission in Matthew 28 he said go teach them to observe all my commands right teach them to observe whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I'm with you even to the end of 2024 hallelujah amen in 2025 if the Lord T see laying on of hands most people don't understand that there is power in laying on your hands for Divine Healing there's power in that because it represents Christ laying his hands on you there's laying on a hands of also of ordaining people that we see that in the Bible they laid their hands on them they ordained the missionaries same thing for pastors and so forth there's power in that but most people don't have that understanding and of resurrection of the Dead most people don't know there's two resurrections there's the resurrection when the dead in Christ rise first and we which are alive meet them they go up first we meet them in the air but then after that is the seven-year tribulation period And then after that is Armageddon the Millennium and after the Millennium in gagam Magog then is the second Resurrection where all the sinners rise so in the first resurrection it's all the Holy Ghost filled Saints rise but it's only for Holy Ghost filled Saints but then there's a resurrection of the the the general Resurrection where everyone who ever lived gets resurrected there I want to be a part the first resurrection Hallelujah that's what I'm living for Hallelujah and then also Eternal judgment now this is what most churches miss most churches think God is going to punish people eternally that's insane it's impossible for someone to be punished for eternally because they don't have eternal life in order to have eternal life You Got to Believe In Christ and if these people are going to hell they don't believe in Christ right they didn't have faith in Christ so they can't be burned eternally the Bible says that no murder hath eternal life therefore the murderer can't burn eternally but see this is and this is baby this is baby Doctrine this is baby think about that most churches you walk in there Mo most churches just uh spiritually they got a baby on this Pew baby on that one b and I'll tell you babies are cute baby here baby there and now think about 400 people or 500 people in the congregation most churches they're just little babies there that's what's the preacher got to give them John 3:16 hey that's good milk that that milk tasted good when I got saved Hallelujah love your neighbor that's real good too The Lord's Prayer that's good I like that's good that's good milk that's that's delicious but that's what but they don't go on to the deeper things of God see we should be thankful that God feeds us meat in the house of the Lord hallelujah because Paul said I can't even preach to you the the the the Deep things of God because you have all this sin in your life a bunch of babies in the church now I'm not saying that in a mean way I'm just saying that they're not growing into into the things of God that they're living in sin when they shouldn't live in sin I'm not trying to be upset here you know what I mean I'm not trying to I'm not trying to be critical is what I'm trying to say because uh remember a lot of these people eventually fall away put up Hebrews 6 verse6 see if if and Paul says if if people don't go if they just stay as babies many of them will fall away if they shall fall away to renew them again to repent seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame so they walk out say I'm a Christian where's my K's light or where's my Bud Light and they get drunk and if they keep going that way they could fall away Hallelujah because they're babies they don't go on you must repent from all the dead Works Hallelujah but see they're not that people aren't taught that preachers are afraid to preach it because they have a small Church like ours well there's some good things about having a small Church Hallelujah God's not always in the big things Hallelujah there's good things about it and Jesus as we we know Jesus even said he said fear not little flock it's your father's Good Will to give you the Kingdom so Jesus tells us plainly a lot of times he gives the kingdom he gives the rulership The Authority the government he gives the the power and the authority of the church to a small little group Hallelujah and when people sin they call themselves Christians and they openly sin in front of everybody I can do this it doesn't hurt me to do this it doesn't well it hurts Christ I know that and it hurts your walk right hurt hurts your testimony a lot of those people eventually fall away that's right I've seen it over the years I've been a Christian since 2000 so I've been a Christian 24 years I've seen a lot of my friends who said they were Christians Fall Away They don't serve God anymore why because they never got past the baby milk they never got past that and grew up and became a real strong Christian God help us to be strong tonight hallelujah amen now verse three First Corinthians 3:3 what a Thanksgiving message here for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envy now here he goes into some specific sins how do you know a church is a a baby church because they Envy one another oh if I wish I could just have what that sister has if I just could have what that brother has and I can't believe they have that position and I want that position right or money or whatever they got or that husband or that wife you know what I mean or that house or that car or that that job my where' they get that job you know anytime there's ening in the church it shows immaturity that's a baby Christian right and strife so actually coming out and debating that word strife means debate or competition well we'll see who's the best piano player Malachi we'll see right now let me show you what I practiced this week I'd never win we know that but competition debating and divisions means dissension or sedition someone uh purposely making this person think bad about that person gossip right this is this is this is not mature Christianity he said are you not carnal and walk as men now see they're not walking as Sons and Daughters of God they're walking as just any other beastly person would or any other human would right second Peter 2:12 says it but these As Natural brute beasts right so Paul says you're walking as men not as Sons and Daughters of God As Natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed now this speaking of evil people but I'm getting the point that Paul I'm sorry this is Peter Peter calls them uh beasts these men and women are beasts because they're not obedient to the spirit of God right there's nothing better there's nothing different between a sinful man a man that'll be a hormonger they go who go sleep with like 10 women in a in a lifetime there's nothing difference between him and any old dirty animal that would sleep around right there's no there's no different they're brute beasts and Paul says you're acting like men you shouldn't act like men or humans you should act like children of God hallelujah amen right children of God hallelujah let's not be divided let's not have strife and debates and envying uh envying is jealousy where's Eden Eden had a good question on that one let's not be jealous let's be thankful for other let's be happy for other people because you know if you're happy for them God's going to bring it around for you Hallelujah right and again even as I said earlier even if God doesn't he still died on the cross for me I'm going to heaven hallelujah what do I to be say about amen what do I to be uh the victim mentality for I'm already saved I'm on my way to heaven I'm shouting the victory Hallelujah that's right verse four 1 Corinthians 3:4 for a while one saith now he says so so you got debate you got Envy you got jealousy and you have this in the church for one says I'm a Paul Paul save Paul preached and I got saved under Paul's Ministry another says I'm of Apollo Apollos was a lot more eloquent remember he was one of the best spoken preachers he was he never stuttered like me he never spit he never forgot verses he just he was El and thank God for people like that thank God we got some good Christian preachers like that I'm thankful Paul said but he Paul said remember he said I come in Weak and trembling in fear so Paul came that way to the Corinthians he was real humble I don't want to say the wrong thing Saints now listen now you got to get this sexual sin out of the church but but Apollo's come up and every word flowed together and it was just beautiful eloquence made you want to say who's that guy up there what a man what a preacher but that was God's way God had these different kinds of gifts in the church but see when you think I'm better because of I'm under this preacher or I got saved on that preacher he says aren't you carnal aren't you just uh I think the word what what was the word for carnal give me another word uh oh yeah yeah animal appetite that's what it is in the Greek the aren't you just an animal right we see the chickens they're always fighting over food right that's what these church members are arguing over who's the who's the best right right hav who's who who's got who's the stronger uh believer who who's got the the more famous preacher amongst them just like a bunch of chickens fighting over some food right right that's what say animal appetites that's what it is right and notice Church they're using their words remember they use their words to debate show their jealousy uh show their envy and now they're using their words I'm a Paul I'm of Apollos and they're using their words to cause divisions we should use our words to bring Unity because remember the power of life and death is in the tongue or I'll say it in the thumbs if you text like this or maybe you're like one of those old time I saw my brother say I'm yesterday he's like because he he's and I'm not making fun of him because he always says that he's he says Jess I don't like to text it took him a while to get a smartphone now he's like I'm like brother speed up man come on let me do it let me text for you no I'm just kidding he's a he's a he's a sweetheart I love my brother Sam what what a good good man there's power in the life I'm sorry there's power of life and death in the tongue or in your text or in your emails or in your YouTube videos or in your Instagram posts or your Tik toks whatever it is there's power and so we must use our power we must use the power of the Holy Spirit to bring life to people verse 5 1 Corinthians 3:5 who then is Paul that's a good question who is Paul who is Apollos put your favorite preacher in there who is does that sound familiar that sounds like when God came down to job and said who is this who is this huh I see God and Paul saying the both both the same thing who are we brother R would say it like this brother said who who are you he said you're a pile of Indiana dust now we're a pile of Ohio dust there's my 30 minutes I'm GNA go a little over 30 today usually go an hour said he said you're just a six you're six feet2 of Ohio dust I'm 5'11 of Ohio dust now we're saying that to be humble who are we I mean what where do we come from are we are we the great ones and that's what Paul's saying why you're arguing about which preacher saved you or not Sav you but preached you so it could be saved Paul says the same thing as God said to Job who is this who who who are they why why are you so concerned about human beings who are they they're servants he says they're ministers by whom you believed who are they they're just God's servants now church I want to bring the balance uh the Bible says give them that labor in the doctrine double honor so see in in a carnal Church he's got to he's got to bring the people down stop magnifying these men but once you get mature then the mature people want to say yes I want to honor brother so and so or sister so and so see what see what I mean it depends where the people are at if they're worshiping if they're worshiping preachers are worshiping their favorite brother or sister then you got to bring them down and say they're they're nobody we're nothing but then when you get mature and you get respectful let's give honor to brother Diggs let's give honor to brother McBride it's not worship it's just we're mature now and we realize they just yield to God and God blesses their sacrifice amen who who are they they're ministers they're servants they're your servants they're the people that serve you but God is the leader God's the sender Hallelujah they're The Messengers God's the sender God is the message the lord gave you servants ministers so he's the great one because for God so loved he gave the giver is the great one Hallelujah God's the great one because God said who is this job who who's this he didn't say job he said who is this Hallelujah The Giver is the great one and it's as true as as as as us as well when we give of ourselves when we sacrifice for others that is great in the eyes of God when we live for other people and we don't live for ourselves Hallelujah that's a good question who is this right who is this like everybody's excited about Trump now who is this God would say who's this he's my servant I mean I'm thankful don't get me wrong I'm super thankful you you know me you know what I voted you know what I prayed you know you see me cry at the altar you see me cry in prayers you know you know me but who is this like it's it's just God's servant and God can use a servant whatever way he wants right I I don't know if he's saved who knows if he's even saved but God's protecting him God's using them verse six I have planted a watered but God gave the increase so see it's okay for preachers to say boy I remember when I preached that and it just sunk right down into Austin's heart about Abraham I remember that brother it just planted it right there in your heart and aw will tell me I remember brother cam preach that restoration message that was just plant it right there in my heart it's okay for preachers to say yes God used me to plant that sermon on the fear of the Lord right or uh God used brother Simon to come around and that watered oh uh that message just watered it just gave me uh life it just refreshed me God used that different preacher to water that seed that was in my soul it's okay to say that because Paul said I did this I planted apilus water but God gives the one God's the one who gives growth the preacher didn't make you grow it's God's spirit that made you grow the Preachers did their component their part of it to either plant or water but God's spirit had to come around and make that thing grow so you could see growth in your life Hallelujah so man just does his part the word grow means to give increase I'm sorry God gave increase it means to grow to grow up to increase to become greater now I'm not calling everybody great here tonight but just you you get uh more like God you become more like God more yielded to God your character is more like Christ means to grow to increase see so it's fine for ministers to say yes the Lord had me preach that message there uh the Lord let a little outpour when I preach that the Lord poured down but then God gave the increase remember the seed is the word Jesus says in Luke chapter 11 the seed is the word so God gives the word to the preacher he preaches it and sometimes it'll get planted right there in your spirit right and then God another preacher come around and water it and then God makes it grow so God alone gives the life God alone gives the growth to the seed that you've heard Hallelujah so we don't give that to credit we don't give credit to anybody oh it was all brother Jesse's uh work that that I'm the Christian I am today it actually was none of mine I I I don't give any increase God gives the increase right Hallelujah so you have to keep the right balance we got to uh keep the right understanding of the placements of the preachers and the placements of every individual gift in the church Hallelujah preachers plant their sermons go down deep in our Spirits another preacher will come down and God will pour out the spirit to give water to that seed God will pour out understanding to you God will pour out wisdom God will pour out knowledge God will pour out faith God will pour out grace through a sermon but God has to make that grow in your life Hallelujah and I'll tell you you'll find out if it grew on Monday or Tuesday morning or definitely by Wednesday definitely you have a battle by Wednesday morning if you if you haven't had by Monday or Tuesday right you'll be tested on what you said to Amen in the church sometimes we're tested on Sunday night right after church right but you'll know oh I over come this time ah God gave me the increase hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah 1 Corinthians 37 and eight so what's Paul's conclusion to these people that argue about who's the greatest preacher and and debating and all these things and jealous and what's his solution so then neither is he that planteth anything that word means certain he's not any certain thing neither he that WTH but God that giveth the increase so God's the special one in all this right the same is true just we know some people had a garden last year right thank God for the people that planted the the uh the seeds thank God for the people that come by a water Caris how many times did you water your garden this summer a lot almost every day now you got a good increase right but you know you could have done you could have done the planting the watering but if God doesn't shine upon that seed if God doesn't give life to that seed does nothing happens right same same thing in the spiritual so really he that plants of waters they're really not anything they're not any certain special thing God has to give life to the seed but we see in verse eight though there is some Unity God there is Unity there is Oneness now he that plants and Waters are one so all these preachers are just the same we're all just servants we're all just ministers we're all doing our part so God can give us life Hallelujah so God can make us grow I Hope Church you come to the end of 2024 and you can say without a shadow of a doubt I've grown in Christ this year if not it's time to receive some water it's time to get some seed planted in your heart Hallelujah if we don't grow it's not God's fault it's our fault Hallelujah I love this now he brings it down to this now he that planteth and WTH that WTH are one so they're unified they they're just they're doing the same work they're working working to get uh to allow God's spirit to fall and God's spirit to give growth and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor so God brings it back down to the individual level preachers are one and we're United in that we we're not anything certainly special right we're not we cannot cause any growth so if people are trusting in a preacher to give them growth it's impossible only God gives growth the preacher can put the seed there the preacher can water right there but God has to shine upon that and God has to cause it to grow Hallelujah only God can cause you to grow only God can give you an increase but you got to have the right conditions of your heart right that's the parable the T the four seeds the four the four sers that's the parable you got you and I got to keep the weeds amen we got to keep the cares of life out of our hearts we got to spiritually weed all the time take anything we're caring about too much things we're thinking about too much that don't apply to God any sins in life we got to root that out and put our hearts in a condition so when the word uh when the spirit and the seed and the water and the light all comes together we have some growth we became better Christians hallelujah amen by the grace of God and then God gets the glory and every man will be rewarded for his own labor hallelujah look at my time here let me every preacher will be rewarded for his own labor so there's individual Rewards Hallelujah like we see in the military you know we see it uh sometimes the president will put a purple medal around people and the Medal of Honor medal of freedom metal all these things there's individual rewards right but then there's group rewards too but here we can see there's individual rewards if we labor honestly if we labor sincerely God will give us a reward for that Hallelujah I just put out a video I'm not I don't have time I I was thought thought I might have time I'm not going to have time uh I put out a video a few weeks ago about the Judgment seat of Christ the Bible Paul says all people will stand before the Judgment seat of Christ to receive what you've done in your body so every person will come up let's say this is the Throne of God every person will call your name called Malachi Smith yes sir here's what you've done in your body right Jesse Smith come before the Throne of God and I'll receive here's what you did in your body and remember they might show us a screen there might be a screen in heaven with all the things that we did and Jesus is going to say either well done or I never knew you so we need to know Christ Hallelujah we need to know him and know his word so well that no man can deceive us hallelujah right he's either going to say Well done you invested your whole life in the word of God or he's going to say depart from me I never knew you because you worked iniquity iniquity is lawlessness in other words nobody could tell you even though the Bible said it you just went ahead and did whatever you want God help us to be obedient Hallelujah CU that's that's the final thing it's either comes down to either you invested in the in the ways of God well done Malachi well done Jesse well done Austin I can name all the brothers here tonight all you do all the sisters next week or depart from me I never knew you those are the worst words we brother man said the best words you want to hear are well done good and faithful servant the worst words would be I never knew you we want to know Jesus in the power of his resurrection now if you're not a preacher it's it's it's simple as well what are you supposed to do as a Christian if you do what you're supposed to do then Jesus will say Well done my good and faithful servant Hallelujah so if you're married what are you supposed to do love your spouse if you're a wife submitting everything as long as it all lines up with the word of God right if you're the man you better love that wife as Christ loved the church don't love yourself love your wife right if you got children train them up in the ways of God hallelujah right whatever whatever God's called you whatever job whatever talents God has placed in your life use it for the glory of God say Lord I did this I did this to glorify you I helped out as many as I could I donated here I I did all these things that remember do it in secret and if you do it the way Jesus tells you he'll say Well done my good and faithful servant you've been Faithful over a few things I'll make you ruler over much we just got to be faithful with a few things in our life Hallelujah but I don't have to time to go that cuz I want to go this way so see there's going to be a uh a reward and now later in this chapter um there's going to be a fire go down to verse 13 Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it be revealed by fire our God is a consuming fire so in the presence of Jesus when you come up to the throne the presence is going to be like a fire right he might have a he might have a theophany body he might look like an Ancient of Days old man with white hair like fire in his eyes there's the fire but the fire of the eyes of Christ you won't be able to lie there you won't be able to hide anything that's why we better confess everything right now by God's grace trust that the blood of Jesus Christ forgives us of all sin now and strive with all we have to live pure before God but see the the fire will declare the eyes of Jesus Will declare Our Lives we won't be able to lie or uh small small white lies we won't be able to do it there's you won't you won't have any opportunity to do that in the presence of Christ everything uh that you've done will be revealed by fire what type of work was it what type of ministry was it what kind of man were you what kind of woman were you there's no other genders whatever you were it'll be revealed by fire because you can't lie to Jesus Christ Hallelujah and so I'm going to bring this down for a little my little testimony I just felt let the Lord to share this here you know uh when I first got saved of course uh I was part of the Assemblies of God Church um but but I I started to finding out right away um do I join this church or not and I found out you have they said you have to speak in tongues to be to be filled with the spirit I was like no the Bible says it right here Pastor he said well that's just what we believe so I said see you later I'm not can't can't be a part of your church that's what the Bible says and then went to the chapel for numerous years that was a great church but then when it come down to this with the godhead and water baptism we disagreed now listen church I'm going to be judged by what I preach right the Bible said it my my preaching my Ministry is going to be judged by fire the fiery eyes of Christ and I'm going to each and each one of you you're going to get a reward for what you've done for Christ so I've had to take a stand you've had to take a stand on certain things in your life and sometimes Jesus even said he said I don't come to bring peace on the earth I come to bring a sword Hallelujah in in Matthew chapter 10 I'll turn your your your mother-in-law against your your your your daughter-in-law I'll turn the the father against the son the brother against the sister I'll turn all these things because I want to see who really loves the truth hallelujah and so this was a thing that separated me from of course the Assemblies of God and when I went to the chapel I still love those people I always love those people but just as a few examples here um you know when I went to these other churches they said God was three persons but the Bible doesn't say God is three persons and then my trinitarian friends said I was a heretic for not believing in the Trinity did you ever ever did I show ever show you this video the godhead is the father son Holy Ghost right ever show that well we know the son we know the son was Jesus right now the Bible said it it pleased the father that in him Jesus should be all the fullness dwell so all that God was was in Christ right and then Colossians 2:9 says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead B so you have two two verses say all that God was was in Christ the Bible never says there's three persons so that means the father had to be in Christ because Jesus said the father is in me and the father that dwelleth in me he does the works so according to Jesus the father's in me is that right well don't the Bible also say the Holy Ghost was in Jes Jesus yes it says the spirit Abode on Jesus and the spirit remained on him and God giveth the spirit unto him well now he's got two persons inside of him is this guy a schizophrenic does he have multiple personality disorder no no the father and the Holy Ghost are the selfs same thing they're it's the eternal spirit of God hallelujah wait did I all I'm sorry I clicked the wrong button sorry I started all over let me fast forward if you put these verses together it's very plain and so I had to take a stand I to see well what am I what what do I believe well the Bible says God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and with power right so the all all of God was in Jesus all of God so did were two other persons inside of a third person no it was the spirit was in the body of Flesh and I had to take a stand on that and I'm going to be judged by what I preached but do I do I have the Bible for that yes look look look at sometime look uh here here here's a concordance here's what I did with my friend I said type three persons into and search the Bible is there any verse that says God is three persons in the Bible no the Bible only has three persons in one verse Jeremiah 5 23 and it says all persons in the 3 and 20 20th year of Nebuchadnezzar that's not even talking about God it's not even talking about God it's not even in the Bible and I'm going to show you the Trinity Doctrine came over 200 years after the last Apostle died it wasn't even preached by the apostles and then my friends called me a heretic because I wouldn't add to the Bible well who's the real heretic those who stay with the Bible or those who added the Bible I heard somebody say adding to the Bible the real heretic is those who add things to the Bible so the Heretics are actually calling me the heretic that's okay I love them always well so the godhead and the Bible said there's one name for the godhead what's the name of God the Lord Jesus Christ that's why every person ever was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so I I don't I don't remember this the father Son and Holy Ghost are all manifested in one body the all of God was in Jesus the Bible says it twice let me show you the uh I I'm I have too many these are old animations I was just playing I was just playing around with him actually just trying to learn how to use animation all those years ago but then if people would understand uh you know my my friends at the chapel and the Assemblies of God said you got to be uh baptized in the titles father and Holy Ghost what that I R read the Bible no 10 days after Jesus said this Peter said baptize in the name of Jesus Christ but this remember this I had to take a stand I was separated I had to se I had to choose do I believe the Bible or do I believe somebody's uh theology degree with a doctorate degree behind it and yet some of those guys smoked cigarettes and some of those guys got drunk and some of those guys were married two three times now it makes it a lot easier to take the stand where I am now and the church said Hallelujah because they had a lot of leav shows their babes in Christ see the Bible also says water baptism was done in the name of the Lord Jesus in Acts 8:16 and then acts uh 10:48 he Peter said we were baptized in the name of the Lord and then Paul said we're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then Paul says we're baptized in the name of the Lord and so by scripture alone what is the name of the father son Holy Ghost it's the Lord Jesus Christ but IAD take a stand and my preaching is going to be go through the fires of Christ well who wrote the Bible Christ amen what's the name for Christ he's the word of God hallelujah amen and if the way I baptize is in the word of God then that's the right way Hallelujah so see my other friends were telling me just do this and ignore all this Ah that's called taking away from the Bible see I can agree with I can agree with all that because 10 days after Jesus said this listen Jesus spirit filled Peter and then Peter said baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and the church said Hallelujah is that right is that right they were filled with the Holy Ghost and he said be baptized repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's right church that's right I I was playing around with these animations you know this was from 2013 that's quite a while ago um there's just another way to look at it and remember church I have uh how many got here 14 I have 14 historical references now in all these I can zoom in I don't know if it'll let me do it here no it won't okay sorry it's just kind of stagnant there I have 14 I went through all these Bible almanacs Chris and I when before we were married we would take dates to the library I talk about a romantic Vagabond you're the most romantic guy I know Jesse yes I take my wife to the library so we can study Bible books maybe I got her supper after that or something like that but look you know all the books say the same thing they all say that water baptism was always done by the apostles in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then a hundred years after that they change it to father son Holy Ghost they all say that and I I I don't have time tonight I I'm already at my hour I could go through all these but see I've I've got a I've got to answer someday for what I preach and I want to preach the truth of God's word okay now I'm going to well I guess I guess that that actually might be helpful here so the the the baptism timeline from uh Resurrection to Pentecost Jesus was resurrected he was seen for 40 days so 40 days later after being seen he ascended and that's when he spoke he said baptize them in the name of the father son Holy Ghost right but 10 days later on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell and then 3,000 were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so there that this means there's one name to the father Son and Holy Ghost that's the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't say baptize them in the names of the Father Son and Holy Ghost because father's not a name son's not a name Holy Ghost is not a name like just like me I'm I'm I'm Haven's dad right I'm a dad I'm Christian's husband I'm your father uh I'm the son of Snookie and Ruby Smith I'm a father son brother husband how many people am I one how many names I got one right I can only sign my check with Jesse Smith I can't sign it with uh father brother husband Pastor teacher so so so so so failure stutterer spitter I can't I can't sign it like that bad joke teller dad bad dad joke teller I can't sound like that the same thing here 10 days later Jesus saying there's one name because remember there's one name the father son Holy Ghost was in one person what was his name Jesus Christ Hallelujah the fullness of godhead was in one man Jesus Christ and it was a mystery the Bible calls it a mystery the mystery of baptism is you baptize in the name of the one crucified amen that's in uh 1 Corinthians chapter one all right I know I'm going long here I'm going try to okay so all those 14 documents call this Lord Jesus Christ they call the apostolic baptism so Peter baptized um in the name of Jesus Christ around is 30 or 33 ad it's there there's just there's actually I personally believe now it's 30 so forgive me I've been growing in my little understanding of history but 26 years later Paul baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so all the apostles baptized the same way according to the Bible now 40 years later the false baptism formula was introduced the Liturgy baptism and the non- apostles so people that didn't know Jesus they start saying father son Holy Ghost because they didn't have the revelation that there's one name to the father Son and Holy Ghost there's only one person the godhead it's God right and he became flesh the word became flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah so so my friend said oh Jesse you need to baptized father and the Holy Ghost well that's not what the apostles did and they had the Holy Ghost these guys it's very questionable if they had the Holy Ghost and the church said right okay so again the apostolic baptism all the baptis in the book of Acts say to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and I've got to take a stand I'm I'm going to be judged by my preaching but see I feel confident over here I feel confident I have all these verses The Eyes Of Fire will will will burn out anything wrong I've done but it'll reveal that I preach the right baptism and the right godhead now is it mysterious yes Austin I we talking about that yes it's very mysterious how can God be one person but manifest in in a thousand way I'm sorry manifest in three ways right it's very mysterious but yet we can't add to the Bible and call God three persons right or else Jesus had was a person who had two people living inside of him well that wouldn't be very good would it to have two people Liv inside of you right just I don't want to be silly but it just doesn't make any sense right but everything we believe lines up with the scripture okay now here uh okay see yeah just again a visual I don't I'm not sure why I did all these I think I was to around now here's what I did today now here's with the word Trinity the word Trinity is not even in the Bible now I understand what it means three as one as long as you say that that's fine but once you say three persons in one now you got a problem because God never says I'm three persons the Bible doesn't say it look it up in the Bible doesn't say three persons and the Bible said don't add one word to the Bible right Jesus saidif you add one word the plagues will be added to you if you take one word away your name will be taken out of the book of life so it's a very serious thing so I I shrunk these down right so now we got 33 we got 100 200 3 325 ad so the the B the apostles kept the baptism until people started interjecting their thoughts their misunderstanding of ma U Matthew 28:19 and then 80 years later theophus called God a Trias or a trinity tulian called him Trinitas in the Latin and then by 3:25 now they add three persons but the writer of our Bible Paul Peter they never called God three persons not one time now who's the heretic now they say Jesse you're the heretic I'm taking my side with the apostles I'm not taking my side with these other guys I'm taking my side with the men that wrote the Bible see that that and that's what people do when they're afraid they call names because they're afraid just like a wounded animal in a corner they're going to fight at you they're going to Claw at you that's what these preachers do when you got them in a corner and they're they know they're wrong well they they start name calling you well you're just a nobody you never went to school it doesn't matter what I went to As Long As I went to the upper room and got the Holy Ghost that's all that matters amen hallelujah and they go to school and they get corrupted and they learn all these lies most schools not every school most school all right I'm a little I'm almost at my hour here of preaching actual preaching see before I say I don't want to go along and then I want a few more minutes why do I keep changing my mind okay um okay now here's another one too you know uh with crossdressing when Chris and I first came uh out of uh Assemblies of God and Chapel we were introduced to how we dress now and the Bible says if you cross dress it's an Abomination that means it's a disgusting thing to God let me show you a more recent one here when we when Chris and I first became Christians we listened to this uh this uh group called cadman's call they were uh they had some really good songs well guess what they did a few years ago the lead singer and they all switched what genders now can anybody look at this and say that looks right in the sight of God doesn't look right now who would who would let that guy lead songs would we let that guy lead songs no he he's got something wrong up here right he doesn't know what he is and God said God said it's it's an Abomination for a man to put on a woman's garment right and so I've got to take a stand who am I going to stand with am i g to stand with the churches or I'm going to stand with Christ I got to stand with Christ now the the shock that we saw especially Chris and I we we liked cadman's call we like some of their songs I used to sing I thought praise the Lord what a great but imagine the shock when we saw this now the shock we saw with this was the same shock in 1930 when Marlene hebburn started wearing men's pants it was a same thing right same thing th these are equal that's equal to that she's wearing men's clothes he's wearing women's clothes and no one here is comfortable with a man dressing in woman's clothes and walking into the women's restroom no one's comfortable with that well then well then why why can she wear that if he can't wear that why can she wear that that's called a double standard and the church said see I had to take a stand my preaching is going to be Tried by fire gonna be Tried by the word of God am I standing on the word of God are we standing on the word of God or are we standing on the society who we trying to please here are we trying to please men or we trying to please God we trying to please God oh that's mine did I have I didn't I want to get a few more I I didn't have time but I'm gonna stop right there let's stand our feet by God's grace Malai is out so oh there he is all right Hallelujah now church I always remember the sermons when I first started hearing this I remember it God used a preacher to plant these truths in my heart and I'm very thankful for it and then God would use another preacher to come down come around and he'd water it oh and I understand this about Marlene hebburn I understand this about cadman's call oh I understand this about history of the godhead God's not three persons I understand now I understand see God planted those things he water them and now God gives me the increase and now I'm not going to let my girls think they're men I'm not going to let my sons think they're women Hallelujah because God has shown us the truth and the truth sets us free how many thankful for Freedom today Hallelujah pull up that song Thank God I'm free but we're going to pray for first by God's grace thank God I'm free Hallelujah these things are more than life to us aren't they Church isn't the truth more than life to you yes we're thankful for Amazing Grace for the of God I'm thankful for what he's shown us I'm thankful that God can plant something so deep in our hearts and then have another uh preacher water it and then God can come around and give an increase and we can grow in the wisdom and knowledge of almighty God hallelujah how you thankful for that tonight let's have a word of prayer now let's pray for our loved ones that are kind of impacted by these things Hallelujah and church after we pray for that let's pray for you let's pray for one another are you grow growing has God given you an increase has God given me an increase that's the question we want to answer tonight we want to pray for others and we also want to pray that we'll get closer to God that we'll use this as a opportunity to let God plant something water something and then God give an increase and we can see oh I grew closer to God through that sermon or that song Or that testimony that that uh that teaching that Doctrine I grew because God gave me an increase and my life has been changed Hallelujah let's not stay the same nobody here wants to stay the same do we we all want to grow closer to God we all want to change for the better don't we H that's why I'm here church that's why you're here let's trust the Lord tonight father God we thank you for the word of God tonight Lord we pray for those affected Lord God by these some of these things Lord I have many friends that are trinitarians I love them but Lord they've called me things Lord Lord we can see tonight as plain that the word of God is true Lord many of my friends are trapped in false teachings like the Trinity of three persons the false baptism not understanding 10 days later Jesus filled Peter he filled him with his spirit and he preached the Lord Jesus Christ's water baptism Hallelujah Lord God lord people not knowing what clothes they should wear which which gender they are Lord God lord to see this happened about a hundred years ago for the female side and now seeing it happened on the mail side Lord

at their lives sincerely are they growing if so Hallelujah may we keep humble may we keep letting the word of God be planted in our heart Hearts but if not Lord God may we examine ourselves tonight Lord God and see if there's any envying jealousy Strife division carnality lust of the flesh lust of the eyes as we saw on Sunday night the pride of life Lord God grant it Lord Jesus if there's any
