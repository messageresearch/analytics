[16:38] there unless everybody wants to have a
[16:41] Wednesday night Christmas service but I
[16:42] thought people would be at their

[35:53] on the fleshly tables or however we're
[35:57] here to worship Jesus Christ he's our
[36:00] Savior he has done everything by the
[36:03] grace of God yes just been battling
[36:11] personally myself the last couple maybe
[36:17] three weeks here just a lot of things
[36:19] have changed or like seeing a lot of
[36:21] wars fatalities serious battles on the
[36:27] homefront we're really coming into some
[36:29] things here and we want to emphasize
[36:35] even at all we're coming into some
[36:39] things and we the devil ain't playing
[36:45] games you know we this is a serious time
[36:47] a real serious matter everyone's
[36:51] fighting for their lives this is
[36:54] literally a life and death this is we're
[36:56] talking rapture those up behind either
[37:01] take the mark of the beast or they
[37:03] died for their faith and they have the
[37:07] courage by their own blood not by the
[37:08] blood of Jesus Christ so we're at a
[37:13] serious time they were going the winds
[37:15] are going to start picking up here the
[37:17] winds of doctrines the winds of evil
[37:20] spirits that were coming like a flood
[37:23] but the Bible says that Jesus would
[37:24] raise up a standard for us so I want to
[37:30] get you up seated here let's see if I
[37:31] can dial this in by the grace of God
[37:34] maybe we'll have a PowerPoint maybe we
[37:35] won't a lot of quotes you know how I
[37:42] just I don't know why I like reading and
[37:44] I like to I'm not uh I talked with the
[37:47] brother and I you know and we're
[37:48] discussing discussing the ministry and
[37:50] there we go and and things of that
[37:52] matter and and I knew he was trying to
[37:56] throw some hints my way and some things
[37:58] and and I you're like Paul said to you
[38:03] he said I am what I am you know I watch
[38:06] his you know brother Jesse became the
[38:08] Brooks my real dear Coast brothers in
[38:12] Christ I say the closest I have and
[38:13] those ministers and I watch how they get
[38:16] under the anointing and they're able
[38:17] just to preach and just catch the
[38:19] inspiration of God and maybe I'm just
[38:21] not there yet as far as that I'm still
[38:23] very young as far as ministering but I
[38:28] this is how I am and revelations 13
[38:34] verse 11 will read this portion right
[38:37] here and I have chosen this subject I we
[38:43] kind of waited I try to wait for
[38:44] something to pop out to preach or teach
[38:46] on and something that happened last week
[38:49] at work and I'm just going to focus on
[38:51] that and we'll go with that by the grace
[38:53] of God in verse 11 and I beheld another
[38:59] beast coming out of the earth and he had
[39:02] two horns like a lamb and he spake as a
[39:04] dragon and he exercises all the power of
[39:09] the first beast before him and caused
[39:12] the earth and them which dwell therein
[39:13] to worship the first beast whose deadly
[39:15] wound was healed
[39:17] HIDA the great wonders so that he maketh
[39:19] Fire come down from heaven on the earth
[39:22] in the sight of men and he deceiveth
[39:26] them that dwell on the earth by the
[39:28] means of those miracles which he had
[39:30] power to do in the sight of the beast we
[39:34] know this is what America this is where
[39:37] we live this is our home country
[39:39] everybody's trying to flee to here but
[39:41] they don't understand they're coming
[39:42] into the greatest trap the greatest
[39:44] deception the world's ever seen and
[39:54] deceive them they had that dwell on the
[39:56] earth by the means of those miracles
[39:57] which he had power to do in the sight of
[40:00] the Beast saying to them that dwell on
[40:01] the earth that they should make an image
[40:04] to the Beast we're at that point right
[40:07] now we're right at where they are going
[40:09] this country is going to push that we
[40:12] need to be governed religiously this is
[40:16] a religious move that they should make
[40:22] an image to the Beast which had the
[40:24] wound by the sword and did live we know
[40:26] that's the Catholic Church and he had
[40:29] power to give life unto the image
[40:30] wouldn't the Catholic Church gave has
[40:32] power to give life to the image of the
[40:35] Beast we know this is the World Council
[40:37] of Churches by the by the prophet right
[40:39] there is a coming and religious uniting
[40:44] should both speak and cause as many as
[40:49] would not worship the image of the Beast
[40:52] should be killed there's going to be
[40:53] laws change there's laws coming up
[40:55] things are changing what was a major law
[40:58] we have recently seen in our in our day
[41:01] before our day but the josè may have
[41:03] seen it abortion now is legal back then
[41:06] God getting kicked out of the schools
[41:09] Pledge of Allegiance those things are
[41:10] getting you brother Jose saw those
[41:12] things now we're to the point in our day
[41:15] where we seen now homosexual marriage
[41:18] legalized now children have rights
[41:24] even in my
[41:26] surrounding his coworkers I work with my
[41:31] the secretary at her shop there's a
[41:33] child in the third grade who's already
[41:35] made a decision to switch why because
[41:41] now that child's parents both switched
[41:43] in Woodville Ohio legal absolutely 100%
[41:52] legal
[41:53] we can even slay your own born child
[41:57] almost now born unborn - just a second
[42:01] before you can you can you can kill that
[42:03] abortion fully legal look how these laws
[42:07] of death are coming in and he had power
[42:14] to give unto the image of the beast
[42:15] that's that that the image we should
[42:17] both speak and cause that as many should
[42:19] would not worship the image of the Beast
[42:21] should be killed and he caused all he
[42:24] caused all both small and great everyone
[42:29] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[42:39] mark in their right hand or in their
[42:44] foreheads
[42:45] what is the saying not everybody's
[42:47] received the whole the mark of the beast
[42:49] check in World International Forum the
[42:54] majority have not decided which way yet
[42:56] they're still lukewarm
[42:58] want to look religious and this or that
[43:01] or however but they've not taken the
[43:02] mark of the beast and then oh man I'm
[43:08] sorry
[43:09] and he calls all small and great rich
[43:11] and poor free and bond to receive a mark
[43:13] in their right hand or in their
[43:15] foreheads and that no man might buy or
[43:17] sell save he that hath had that had the
[43:22] mark or the name of the beast or the
[43:25] number of his name here his wisdom let
[43:26] him that hath understanding count the
[43:28] number of the beast for it is a number
[43:30] of a man and his number is six hundred
[43:32] threescore and six so say a word of
[43:36] Prayer
[43:38] your father Lord Jesus we just love you
[43:41] lo we thank you so much for your grace
[43:42] and for your mercy and O God you've been
[43:46] faithful Lord since day one Lord you
[43:52] were faithful before time even began God
[43:54] and what we know this is just a great
[43:57] story a love story you've written Lord
[44:00] you've written a script Lord and and
[44:03] Lord you've chosen your actors Lord to
[44:05] play out the parts God though many
[44:09] didn't know what they were doing acting
[44:11] or they're just living life Lord but the
[44:13] Bible says Lord even the Old Testament
[44:15] Saints were did things where they were
[44:16] moved by the Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus
[44:19] will we thank you Lord for that
[44:21] predestinated seed God Lord the very
[44:23] life of God Lord they could come and
[44:26] dictate Lord in our lives or our actions
[44:29] or thoughts Lord I know we love you so
[44:32] much
[44:32] or bless the people god lord we don't
[44:34] want to have any part order this little
[44:36] study God Lord we just pray Lord you
[44:37] would take full control over these
[44:39] vessels or whatever you best won't hear
[44:40] God and Lord we rebuke any unclean
[44:43] spirit in the name of Jesus Christ we
[44:45] bind it right now and command it as you
[44:49] were Lord that you would that there's a
[44:50] devil or any demons Lord would flee out
[44:52] of here they're not welcome here this
[44:53] morning and the name of Jesus Christ or
[44:56] we do that Lord by not any power I have
[44:58] it over but we do it by the authority
[44:59] you've given us or I know we just we
[45:02] don't have to yell and shout or we just
[45:04] speak the word god we believe it Lord
[45:07] because faith is here your faith God we
[45:11] love you so much in a name Jesus Christ
[45:12] amen you may have your seats everybody
[45:22] feeling okay this morning and good and
[45:25] we just want the full leadership of the
[45:27] Holy Ghost
[45:28] it may seem all negative this morning
[45:31] but I'm not we're just putting out
[45:34] warning here warnings and warnings and
[45:37] warnings
[45:41] you know we there's something coming you
[45:45] know I can't get over there just there's
[45:47] a lot of things that's happened were
[45:48] going to share some things this morning
[45:51] and because even though we are as a body
[45:56] here a church we are the members right
[45:59] here of the Bride of Christ fellowship
[46:03] but individually we leave here
[46:07] individually in all Ryan's home and this
[46:11] upcoming week we will be faced by
[46:14] decisions individually thoughts will
[46:17] come into each one of your individual
[46:19] minds things will come upon your your
[46:23] hearts and your minds and you will have
[46:25] to weigh what you're going to do it's
[46:29] not what comes into your mind it's the
[46:32] decisions you make from them it's the
[46:34] actions that come forth from those
[46:38] thoughts and we have a decision we have
[46:41] to be we have to either accept those
[46:43] thoughts check those thoughts reiterate
[46:46] them think on them chew them up a little
[46:48] bit pray on them and then we have to
[46:50] make a decision and then by those
[46:52] decisions we have to live with our
[46:57] decisions so this morning I'd like to
[47:00] teach or maybe the the coming deception
[47:05] and if we had a subtitle would be the
[47:07] mark of the beast just the general over
[47:15] looking at the subject and and weighing
[47:17] things and and examining what the
[47:20] Prophet would say about this this topic
[47:23] and and what the scripture has and I'll
[47:28] be honest you know as Jesus said about
[47:31] you know Judas and the losses he said
[47:34] it's better for them to have never even
[47:35] heard the gospel because the damnation
[47:38] would be greater be greatest you know
[47:40] the three realms and hell there's the I
[47:43] believe the regular then there's a CLE
[47:45] sorry then there's a civil the second
[47:49] realm of civil where the leaders the
[47:50] rulers the kings and presidents if they
[47:53] would fail to make heaven the second
[47:56] round was be civil and that's where they
[47:57] would go but the lowest realm I believe
[48:00] is the prophet talk would be the easy
[48:01] class to go around the lowest parts of
[48:03] the hell
[48:04] which was those who heard the gospel
[48:06] those that maybe preach the gospel like
[48:08] Judas would be in the lowest hell the
[48:11] ecclesiastical realm the top realm would
[48:15] be be for people that we drive pass in
[48:17] the cars and they'd be on their
[48:19] motorcycles just the never even the Holy
[48:21] Ghost never came to him even one time
[48:24] and they never even thought about
[48:27] accepting God or rejecting him all's
[48:30] they know is right into heart Harley's
[48:32] and and and doing drugs and drinking
[48:35] alcohol and things like that they don't
[48:37] know anything about religion but today
[48:44] we're going to talk on the coming
[48:46] deception and as we looked at this
[48:47] before there's something coming this is
[48:50] coming there is coming a time very very
[48:53] shortly here and and I'm kind of shaking
[48:57] you know the last week I I'm just I
[48:59] don't even feel like I'm when I'm work I
[49:01] know my ball might the guy I'm working
[49:03] with notices I'm just kind of audit
[49:04] right now just I feel like a first-year
[49:07] apprentice and I'm grabbing things he's
[49:09] know so I get this I'm like oh yeah
[49:10] that's right grab this and I'm just
[49:12] there's many things that have happened
[49:14] and it's I'm worried so worried for the
[49:19] people so I want to read some quotes
[49:20] here by the grace of God and we'll get
[49:22] into some things but as you go through I
[49:25] was like I want to share this little
[49:26] story as we go into life here these next
[49:29] from this point on I want you to I heard
[49:31] this story and believe it or not I got
[49:34] this off Facebook there's a story and
[49:38] there's this farmer the farmer had his
[49:42] prized horse you know and and the horse
[49:44] was in the stable they're in the stable
[49:46] area and maybe let him a smile maybe
[49:48] shared he heard it and there's this
[49:51] farmer head he had this horse you know
[49:53] when he had a son and one day you know
[49:57] the son sure did love that horse and he
[50:00] wrote it and practiced on it and you
[50:02] know that was his prized horse his buddy
[50:05] horse you know that was like it for me
[50:06] would be a dog and well one night you
[50:11] know there was a windstorm kick up or
[50:13] whatever a tornado however in
[50:15] the gate of the horse pasture or the
[50:18] barn whatever blew open and that horse
[50:20] ran out and it got loose it was gone and
[50:24] they woke up the next morning and the
[50:25] Sun ran out dog daddy where's my horse
[50:27] the farmer said wow I don't know and the
[50:30] neighbor said wow this is a terrible
[50:33] thing this could have happened and the
[50:39] father the farmer heard he says it could
[50:41] be bad or it could be good and then
[50:47] after about two or three days sure
[50:49] enough that horse comes back and he had
[50:51] brought with him a whole a herd of wild
[50:54] horses and he made friends this guess
[50:58] you know tame horses making friends
[51:00] these wild horses and Mustangs and sure
[51:02] enough he you know the horse finally got
[51:04] lonely some and I was eating better over
[51:06] there and he this wild horse or this
[51:08] normal horse brought all this wild pack
[51:11] horses back and they right went we let
[51:13] him right into this pasture and the the
[51:15] sun's all rejoicing and they shut the
[51:17] door and they had a whole herd of horses
[51:18] now and the neighbors like this was the
[51:22] greatest thing that's ever happened and
[51:25] the farmer daddy says well this could be
[51:29] bad or it could be good the father
[51:33] didn't make one call either way he's
[51:35] watching things unfold and one day you
[51:38] know the son was writing to his favorite
[51:41] horse you know and he thought well maybe
[51:43] I got to start breaking in these other
[51:44] wild horses and the son gets up one
[51:49] mounts the saddle on it and starts
[51:51] trying to to get this horse you know all
[51:54] broke in you know and ii told bay em and
[51:56] this and that and the wild horse kicked
[51:58] him off and he broke his leg the
[52:02] farmer's son broke his leg and now he
[52:04] had to get his set by the doctor and and
[52:07] the the neighbor come out and said this
[52:11] is the worst thing that's ever happened
[52:15] this is absolutely terrible and the
[52:19] father though the farmer said well it
[52:22] could be bad or it could be really good
[52:24] i guess what the wait and see two weeks
[52:27] later
[52:28] - the boy breaks his leg le blues in a
[52:31] time of the Civil War Revolutionary War
[52:33] whatever here's some soldiers come
[52:36] looking for 18 year olds 19 year olds to
[52:38] recruit to go to war and the father said
[52:42] this was the best thing that ever
[52:44] happened to me so saints of God no
[52:48] matter what's you hear about what you
[52:51] see about and say oh my goodness this is
[52:53] the worst the most horrible they can't
[52:55] get wait and see because the Bible says
[52:58] the footsteps of the righteous are
[53:00] ordered it may look bad but in the end
[53:05] it's gonna turn out for your good a man
[53:09] so let's get into this I just want to
[53:10] share that because way before you speak
[53:13] anything let's just say maybe it is
[53:16] maybe it isn't
[53:17] we'll see what let's see let's let God
[53:19] decide what's going to happen he'll work
[53:22] this out I know he will now look what
[53:25] the look what the look at the Prophet
[53:26] says here he says but Rome is not going
[53:28] in alone he says her daughters are right
[53:31] with her and she will take over absolute
[53:34] authority by the World Council of
[53:36] Churches this may seem far-fetched to
[53:39] some but actually it is a very plain for
[53:41] all to see because right now the
[53:43] churches are controlling the politics
[53:45] why are these things homosexually all
[53:48] being okay and being passed because it's
[53:50] in the churches later controlling
[53:52] politics he says he says and at the
[53:56] opportune time will manifest exactly how
[54:00] great that control is there's no way the
[54:03] churches are gonna you could ask all the
[54:05] streets that the churches will rule the
[54:06] world they the people are laughing your
[54:08] face and kick dust on your shoes and say
[54:09] get out of here you a fanatic they don't
[54:13] understand that this is a religious move
[54:15] coming he says he says this is so
[54:19] because of revelation 17 states at the
[54:22] Mystery Babylon is seated on the
[54:24] Beast she's controlling the last or a
[54:26] fourth system under her Rome will be
[54:29] controlling and this image church system
[54:31] would be obedience Rome because Rome
[54:33] controls the goal of the world thus all
[54:37] the people will have to belong to the
[54:39] world church system or be at the mercy
[54:41] of the elements for they cannot buy or
[54:44] sell without the mark of the beast in
[54:46] the hand or head right this may be just
[54:49] a refresher okay what is the mark in the
[54:53] head and on the floor and then in the
[54:55] hand the mark in the hand means that
[54:58] they will have to take the doctrine of
[55:00] the world church system which is
[55:02] Trinitarian trinitarianism etc and we
[55:06] come out of that we've come out of that
[55:08] but notice notice how the people who
[55:10] come out many have went back in people
[55:14] you would never even think mighty
[55:16] preachers over the pulpit that stood
[55:18] with the word for 30 40 years have now I
[55:21] went back to this take heed and the mark
[55:26] in the hand which which means to do the
[55:28] will of the world Church so there is
[55:32] coming a temptation and we must not be
[55:35] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[55:37] when push comes to shove we will stand
[55:40] on the Word of God we believe that God
[55:43] is the one person we believe in the
[55:44] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:46] Christ we believe Lord I was like this
[55:48] in in the the dot Lee is these true
[55:51] doctors have become we believe in the
[55:53] truth we believe that God is coming the
[55:56] way he said he would come we believe
[55:59] there is a rapture for those that are
[56:00] filled with the oil right of the Holy
[56:02] Ghost he says he says now look the image
[56:06] will try to keep the bride from
[56:08] preaching and teaching etc notice when
[56:12] does the mark come when does this great
[56:16] mark come while the bride is still here
[56:22] because remember the the mystery of
[56:24] iniquity will not we will not see the
[56:25] Antichrist rise up perhaps it will be
[56:28] will be gone before then but we will
[56:30] looks as this as these quotes look as we
[56:33] as we've studied the message it looks
[56:34] like we will see this false thing rise
[56:36] up the image will try to keep the bride
[56:42] from preaching and teaching etc her
[56:45] ministers will be forbidden to give
[56:46] comfort and true to the people who need
[56:49] it but before the Antichrist in person
[56:52] takes over this complete world system of
[56:54] churches
[56:55] the true church will be taken away from
[56:57] this world to be with the Lord God will
[56:59] catch his bride away for the great
[57:01] marriage supper of the lamb right and
[57:06] the reason I i-i've kind of wanted to
[57:09] focus on this this is the only thing the
[57:11] Lord really showed me while I was
[57:12] working and that I was and I'll say like
[57:14] this I was measuring I was putting some
[57:20] sensor Wells into these oil pits and
[57:24] their big vats of pits I'm at the train
[57:26] station here working in Willard Ohio and
[57:28] there's these pits of oil where they
[57:30] separate the water in the oil so it
[57:31] wouldn't go and contaminate the the
[57:33] ground or however and I have to put
[57:34] these 4-inch pipes down in the ground or
[57:37] into the into the well there I had to
[57:38] cut the grading and lower him down
[57:40] anchor him into and then set the little
[57:42] flange here but I needed dimensions I
[57:44] had to figure out how deep it was so I
[57:46] could get the right height for the
[57:47] electrician's at I own for their sensor
[57:49] to go in there right so as I as I take
[57:52] my tape measure out and I'm lowering it
[57:54] down into the oil I hit bottom and ice
[57:57] measure up the top here's and okay I
[57:58] need about 12 foot and I had a 12 foot
[58:00] measurement as I pulled the tape measure
[58:01] up guess where the oil mark was at 666
[58:06] if you know anything about the tape
[58:08] measure there is a portion of that tape
[58:12] measure where it actually has 666 on it
[58:15] and I kind of jump back or like whoa
[58:17] because you know every time that's
[58:19] happened in the job where I've measured
[58:20] over and this this I always move it
[58:23] okay the pipes might not look right this
[58:25] way but you know what I'm moving that's
[58:26] and they may look why did he put it over
[58:29] here well there's a reason why I put it
[58:30] away because we don't want nothing to do
[58:33] with that mark hey man right we want to
[58:35] be what full of the Holy Ghost amen
[58:38] absolutely down not just into the flesh
[58:40] not into the spirit realm also but down
[58:42] into the soul we need the baptism of the
[58:44] Holy Ghost sealed and working its way
[58:47] out pushing into every fiber amen now so
[58:53] as I thought about these things you know
[58:55] I thought about deception and I thought
[58:57] about this thing is coming and the Lord
[58:59] kept showing me that there is a certain
[59:02] blade for a sawzall in the company that
[59:06] come out is called Diablo which is the
[59:09] and in this in this holiday season they
[59:12] had this little sawzall pack I saw this
[59:14] the very next day at Home Depot and in
[59:16] this packet the name was Diablo which we
[59:18] know means devil and Spanish and then in
[59:22] this pack they had three separate
[59:24] compartments and they had six blades of
[59:26] this six blades of that and another six
[59:28] blades of this and I'm thinking I'm
[59:29] looking at something my goodness this
[59:31] thing is coming and then the same day I
[59:33] had this little app on my word and that
[59:34] word for the day was a dilatory saints
[59:38] of God are this thing is like Shiki mean
[59:40] I'm like lord we must be ready we must
[59:47] have the holy the mind of Christ ready
[59:50] to discern the very two spirits within
[59:53] the framework of the church with the
[59:55] spirits out there the spirits out here
[59:57] we must be able I was like this to even
[59:59] discern the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost
[1:00:02] speaking or is it something else
[1:00:05] amen now notice how close let me show
[1:00:09] you like this how even I love how the
[1:00:10] scripture says this then first Kings
[1:00:12] 10:1 says and when the Queen of Sheba
[1:00:14] heard of the fame of Solomon concerning
[1:00:17] the name of the Lord she came to prove
[1:00:20] him with hard questions and she came to
[1:00:25] Jerusalem with the very great train and
[1:00:27] with camels and bear spices and very
[1:00:28] much gold and precious stones and when
[1:00:30] when she had was come to Solomon she
[1:00:33] commune with him all that was in her
[1:00:35] heart and Solomon told all her questions
[1:00:37] and there was not anything hid from the
[1:00:40] king which he told her not you know that
[1:00:45] Queen was pretty sharply she tried to
[1:00:46] deceive the king look at what the
[1:00:51] Prophet said here says and then we come
[1:00:52] down to human life the characteristic
[1:00:55] characteristics between man and woman
[1:00:56] there is a difference he says they're
[1:00:58] both a human being but the
[1:01:00] characteristics of the two sexes detect
[1:01:03] them I was reading some time ago about
[1:01:05] one of the problems that was put to test
[1:01:07] Solomon by the Queen that she had some
[1:01:09] women dressed like men that come with
[1:01:11] her and Solomon head and what Solomon do
[1:01:15] he says let him walk and do things and
[1:01:18] quickly he said those are women
[1:01:20] so even the days of Solomon he had to
[1:01:23] discern between a man and a woman to
[1:01:26] cross-dressing and everything a man and
[1:01:28] here we are today amen
[1:01:31] praise God I go to Thailand and they
[1:01:34] call him at ladyboys and I had the first
[1:01:37] glance I didn't even recognize it and
[1:01:39] brother Ron said brother I go what he
[1:01:44] goes look at the hands here these
[1:01:46] feminine dressed men
[1:01:49] Daud up and this and that but they had
[1:01:51] these big giant hands on not fit for a
[1:01:54] woman and then as I as I saw him was
[1:01:58] like whoa so then I turned to speak to
[1:02:00] one of them for whatever reason and I
[1:02:02] said put your I didn't say this but in
[1:02:05] in in Thai god bless yous put chopped
[1:02:07] pachai way pawn Pichai pawn hello oh and
[1:02:13] the lady spoke with a man's voice oh my
[1:02:17] it's getting close see but God has
[1:02:19] always seen there's nothing new Under
[1:02:21] the Sun Salman was tested by the Queen
[1:02:24] of Sheba absolutely many deceptions
[1:02:28] coming he says now look at the Prophet I
[1:02:31] like to when brother Jesse called for
[1:02:33] those special meetings I liked what he
[1:02:34] was doing there he says now look what
[1:02:37] the Prophet says if you're if you keep
[1:02:38] your emic your stomach empty and the
[1:02:41] blood is at your brain and you must be
[1:02:43] ready when you're full he says that's
[1:02:45] the power of fasting when you're full
[1:02:47] the blood goes to your stomach to digest
[1:02:49] the food you see and then when you're
[1:02:51] empty is it's all those new Bloods up in
[1:02:54] your brain he says so you can just cause
[1:02:56] them to spirits is so close to deceive
[1:02:58] the very elect if possible and many
[1:03:01] times you hear it cry I've heard people
[1:03:03] shout as I've told you I hope God let me
[1:03:07] find favor with you today if you believe
[1:03:09] me I've heard people shout and it wasn't
[1:03:11] gone in church he's not talking about a
[1:03:16] baseball game he's not talking about MLB
[1:03:19] or the NF him he's talking about in
[1:03:22] church he says I've heard people cry and
[1:03:25] it wasn't God see and their sympathy
[1:03:28] sometimes the devil wants to be patted
[1:03:30] and it takes a real sheep razor to
[1:03:34] know the difference between the bleed of
[1:03:35] a goat and of a lamb they're so close
[1:03:37] together you see he says so they're on
[1:03:41] this platform you must be very careful
[1:03:43] can be just one thing as all Satan wants
[1:03:45] to throw out before the public so
[1:03:47] they're therefore I have to be fasting
[1:03:50] prayerful every minute on guard watching
[1:03:52] for something what's the power of
[1:03:55] fasting it gets you out of your flesh
[1:03:57] allows all your blood to your brain and
[1:03:59] that he says even helps you discern the
[1:04:02] spirits with them to frame workers with
[1:04:04] church amen I know I'm full of quotes
[1:04:08] and scriptures but this is how I teach a
[1:04:10] man I don't want you to I'm have nothing
[1:04:16] to do with this I am just reiterating
[1:04:18] what God has brought to us in this day
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:22] sure and once you look here I charge
[1:04:27] thee therefore before God and the Lord
[1:04:28] Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick
[1:04:31] and the dead at his appearing and his
[1:04:33] kingdom why am I reading this preach the
[1:04:36] word be instant in season out of season
[1:04:38] reprove rebuke rebuke exhort with all
[1:04:42] long-suffering and doctrine for the time
[1:04:44] will come when they shall not endure
[1:04:45] sound doctrine
[1:04:47] are we there yes sound doctrine think
[1:04:52] about every crazy doctrine you hear in
[1:04:54] this message where do they get these
[1:04:56] from they're listening to tapes and they
[1:05:00] catch one quote and they take that one
[1:05:03] quote maybe two quotes and they plant it
[1:05:06] they put it to seed they take these
[1:05:10] quotes at ah there it is something new
[1:05:12] something fresh and they planted it
[1:05:14] within their hearts and look what they
[1:05:15] create look what the what the blossoms
[1:05:18] forth and this and that every word on
[1:05:21] the tape says thus saith the Lord no
[1:05:22] it's not did you ever see what he said
[1:05:28] the Prophet said in the seventh seal at
[1:05:29] the end he says don't ever put me in any
[1:05:32] of this I am just a man full of sin he
[1:05:37] said he said say by the grace of Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ full the Holy Ghost obviously he
[1:05:42] says but don't put me into any of it he
[1:05:45] said I have nothing to do
[1:05:49] for the time will come when they not
[1:05:51] endure sound doctrine but after their
[1:05:52] own lust show heap up to themselves
[1:05:54] teachers having itching ears they're
[1:05:56] gonna buy preachers who preach what they
[1:05:58] want to hear and that's it if you don't
[1:06:01] preach what they want to hear you're not
[1:06:03] getting the invite and they shall turn
[1:06:06] away their ears shall turn away their
[1:06:09] ears from the truth and shall be turned
[1:06:11] unto fables you wait till I show you
[1:06:18] some things here anyhow uh some things
[1:06:20] in you he said but watch thou in all
[1:06:24] things endure afflictions do the work of
[1:06:26] the evangelist make full proof of thy
[1:06:28] ministry now some of this part I don't
[1:06:29] understand I'm gonna read this things to
[1:06:31] ya okay just just hang with me there's a
[1:06:32] lot of reading here he says but today
[1:06:34] they don't want to hear a message like
[1:06:36] that and he's blasting uh women leaving
[1:06:39] their wives and wives leaving their
[1:06:40] women he says because when a husband
[1:06:41] wife being married there are one he says
[1:06:43] when a when a husband leaves he says
[1:06:45] they cut the flesh they cook them the
[1:06:47] wife off at the wife leaves he cuts the
[1:06:49] flesh she cuts the flesh off the husband
[1:06:51] off he said but they don't want to hear
[1:06:53] something like that the people don't
[1:06:55] want to hear that they want to be
[1:06:57] tickled in their ears oh my goodness
[1:06:59] what if I only talk good thing is good
[1:07:01] things good things I'm not worried about
[1:07:03] the good things we'll get the good
[1:07:04] things over there hey man you know your
[1:07:08] pride I don't have to tell you Brian you
[1:07:09] should know it by now by the grace of
[1:07:11] God sure do we have battles absolutely
[1:07:13] but we must know within our hearts that
[1:07:15] we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:17] a man yes he said but they want to be
[1:07:21] tickled in the ears exactly what the
[1:07:23] Holy Spirit told me the day I laid the
[1:07:25] cornerstone they're said to preach the
[1:07:30] gospel we're gonna jump down said when
[1:07:35] the vision leaves so he saw a vision the
[1:07:38] day he laid the cornerstone he saw this
[1:07:40] vision and then said you read 2nd
[1:07:42] Timothy 4 so don't forget 2nd Timothy 4
[1:07:46] and then the vision left standing right
[1:07:48] there on the seventh Street a 19 year
[1:07:51] old boy standing there the voice of God
[1:07:52] spoke out in the room and he said 2nd
[1:07:55] Timothy 4 that's exactly what it turned
[1:07:56] to be see the time will they come will
[1:07:58] he not endure sound doctrine
[1:08:00] this planet in where is this vision
[1:08:02] planet in Brenham Tabernacle yes well
[1:08:07] though not endure sound doctrine no he
[1:08:11] says here he says he says but the
[1:08:12] morning that laid that cornerstone
[1:08:14] because if you're the spiritual you'll
[1:08:16] get it because the cry the people if you
[1:08:18] could break out that out or take the
[1:08:21] book and read and said he said do the
[1:08:27] work of the Evangelist don't call me to
[1:08:29] being a he said didn't call me to be
[1:08:31] evangelist but said do the work of the
[1:08:32] evangelist for the time will come with a
[1:08:34] not endure sound doctrine but he did all
[1:08:36] those things he quoted that scripture
[1:08:38] and told me where to find it set up
[1:08:39] three times and I got the Bible and
[1:08:42] turned to where he told me and there it
[1:08:43] was and then you know about - about the
[1:08:46] two buckets of the Pentecostal oneness
[1:08:49] and the Pentecostal Assemblies I never
[1:08:51] crossed them now he's talking about the
[1:08:54] vision he says I planted there I planted
[1:08:56] their own trees right where they was
[1:08:58] because I was thinking though they were
[1:09:00] both wrong but out of it I was at the
[1:09:03] cross at the harvest now do I understand
[1:09:07] this just this vision no cuz he's very
[1:09:10] vague on it he says now here is when I
[1:09:14] run down there and seen them two trees
[1:09:16] he's talking about this vision broke off
[1:09:19] one here
[1:09:20] oneness and Trinity I never crossed them
[1:09:22] I planted them like that then he's seen
[1:09:26] the fruit fault then he's seen the fruit
[1:09:28] fall in my hand and then run me to
[1:09:30] Calvary what is he doing I think my
[1:09:35] thought on this I'm not saying it's a
[1:09:37] dusty look my thought is that God told
[1:09:39] him to go and preach the gospel to
[1:09:41] everybody and let them believe what they
[1:09:44] want to believe but if he's sowed seed
[1:09:46] that he would catch the fruit of it and
[1:09:47] bring it to the gate I'm saved
[1:09:49] he drew a circle around all of them
[1:09:52] because remember what he had to get
[1:09:55] people there was people he would said
[1:09:56] that had the Holy Ghost and he said stay
[1:09:58] in your churches absolutely now
[1:10:03] let's see here and it left me sitting in
[1:10:05] my room might even know I was a vision I
[1:10:07] didn't know what it was called in that
[1:10:08] day and we're back then I was laying the
[1:10:12] cornerstone that day of the foundation
[1:10:13] it's wrote there laying and there in the
[1:10:15] cope the cornerstone now and said he
[1:10:18] goes on to this right okay let's see
[1:10:21] here
[1:10:21] you remember the other night of the
[1:10:23] message that he gave me back there when
[1:10:25] I was laying the cornerstone just
[1:10:27] exactly to do the work said when you
[1:10:29] come out of this vision reading 2nd
[1:10:31] Timothy 4 you know what's laying right
[1:10:33] there in the corner stone 33 years ago
[1:10:36] but remember the other night when I met
[1:10:38] when I never did read the rest of it so
[1:10:41] remember God gave him this vision he saw
[1:10:43] this thing with the two groups she'd up
[1:10:45] be plant trees grab the fruit and
[1:10:46] brought him to Calvary but now he's
[1:10:50] thinking he's thinking he says because
[1:10:52] that scripture only went so far he says
[1:10:55] I often wondered one day till I seen
[1:10:57] Jesus pick up the scroll began to read
[1:11:01] he said a tureen and read half of the
[1:11:05] prophecy and the stopped and said there
[1:11:07] in poker poker poker Neum Capernaum he
[1:11:11] said and this day this prophecy is
[1:11:14] fulfilled why didn't he read the rest of
[1:11:16] it it pertains to a second coming see
[1:11:18] okay everybody follow me I know what
[1:11:21] kind of okay and there I had to read
[1:11:23] that not knowing I picked up there I
[1:11:26] picked up that and there it was right
[1:11:29] before me as Southern Pines now he's
[1:11:30] examining his ministry right he went
[1:11:33] lead the the he had this vision that day
[1:11:35] he saw this this this he then the spirit
[1:11:39] said second Timothy 4 he read it and
[1:11:41] then when he's laying the quarters - he
[1:11:43] stuck that vision in that prophecy in
[1:11:45] there and now it's in a cornerstone in
[1:11:46] jeffersonville right but as his ministry
[1:11:51] went on he couldn't understand things he
[1:11:59] says in there I
[1:12:00] it was right before me at Southern Pines
[1:12:01] South Carolina that morning standing
[1:12:03] right there talking to Joseph Bose a
[1:12:06] leaning up against the sidecar is I
[1:12:08] struck it he's like this he says Paul
[1:12:13] said all men has turned against me
[1:12:15] there's no man with me demas has
[1:12:16] forsaken me loving this present world
[1:12:19] and now I look and the coppersmith done
[1:12:21] done me much harm
[1:12:22] look what Dimas must have thought in
[1:12:26] other words he was preaching to all
[1:12:28] these churches and finally at the end
[1:12:30] what he is fully rejected but he said
[1:12:33] but Lord you said in the vision that I
[1:12:35] would do this and this this but now it's
[1:12:37] all that favor is gone and now he's
[1:12:43] bringing he's reading it further he says
[1:12:46] I don't think Dimas went out into the
[1:12:48] world because Dimas was one of you know
[1:12:49] his history was a big rich family and he
[1:12:52] wanted to go with the rest of the crowd
[1:12:54] now why am I saying that because look at
[1:12:56] the rest of the scripture from where he
[1:12:57] picked up for I am now ready to be
[1:13:00] offered in my time of departure is at
[1:13:02] hand if the Prophet would have continued
[1:13:05] on he would have seen the rest of his
[1:13:07] ministry that he would be taken off the
[1:13:09] scene and that Dimas would forsake him
[1:13:11] he says what I and what the Prophet
[1:13:17] could go home is saying what I have
[1:13:19] fought a good fight I have finished my
[1:13:20] course I have kept the faith
[1:13:22] henceforth there's a lane up for me a
[1:13:24] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[1:13:26] the righteous judge shall give me at
[1:13:28] that day and not me only but unto all
[1:13:30] them that love his appearing do thy
[1:13:32] diligence to come shortly unto me for
[1:13:35] demas heifer shake shake in me having
[1:13:38] loved this present world and where is he
[1:13:41] where did he go
[1:13:42] that's Salonika yeah Thessalonica that's
[1:13:47] the first star that is the firt message
[1:13:50] of the first church age and demas
[1:13:52] forsaken and right and what the
[1:13:54] Thessalonica in the seventh we're to
[1:13:57] demas go he stayed in Laodicea what was
[1:14:01] Paul's 7th Church he wrote to
[1:14:03] Thessalonica in the 7th the 7th letter
[1:14:07] that the first messenger wrote was to
[1:14:11] Thessalonica and that's where demons
[1:14:13] fell
[1:14:13] and Wednesday for shouting whether the
[1:14:17] Dimas of this day would fall a lot in
[1:14:19] the seventh church age as well
[1:14:20] it's a recorder there was a rich city
[1:14:23] full of wealth material goods yeah hey
[1:14:27] man there it is Romans Galatia

[1:14:38] of the others he would fall what in the
[1:14:41] 7th church age in Laodicea of his day he
[1:14:45] men now let's continue on here what I'm
[1:14:51] gonna read to you next I have first-hand
[1:14:54] dealt with I want to tell you how
[1:14:59] serious this is ok yes I had just had
[1:15:05] just have dealt with this I seen there
[1:15:09] was one night there was a boy in a
[1:15:11] monastery in the days of Saint Martin
[1:15:14] that he said the Lord made me an old
[1:15:17] prophet out of the Old Testament did you
[1:15:23] know that while I am here teaching or
[1:15:25] another ministers up here preaching that
[1:15:28] God or I'm sorry that the devil can come
[1:15:32] and put into your minds that you are
[1:15:34] something greater or something more than
[1:15:36] you're not I could be the I could be the
[1:15:41] High Priestess mystic and she can walk
[1:15:44] out here with her golden robe and say
[1:15:45] look I'm from Hong Kong I am your
[1:15:48] ambassador I'm here to lead you as our
[1:15:51] pastor we let us lead and these things
[1:15:54] but the devil could put this in your
[1:15:56] mind that you were more than what you
[1:15:57] are I just dealt with this I learned a
[1:16:04] lot of lessons here this is a serious
[1:16:07] thing this is very very serious like and
[1:16:09] I wish I could say I am one of the old
[1:16:15] prophets well I cannot be I cannot call
[1:16:18] the bishops name there of this old
[1:16:20] little school just a little group out
[1:16:22] there like I cannot tell his name at
[1:16:24] this time but he was trained under
[1:16:25] Martin it didn't sound
[1:16:28] right just so the rest of the brother
[1:16:30] and just let him alone
[1:16:31] hmm just let him alone I guess directly
[1:16:35] he prophesized that tonight God is
[1:16:37] coming down and going to give me a white
[1:16:39] robe to sit among you and you'll know
[1:16:42] that I'm one of the prophets of the Old
[1:16:44] Testament brother surely he's off surely
[1:16:48] this is not going to happen so that
[1:16:52] night 12 o'clock actually it happened
[1:16:55] what would you do I am Simeon one of the
[1:17:02] eldest of the tribes of Israel I'm
[1:17:06] coming back and Here I am in fact I will
[1:17:10] sit in one of the twenty-four Thrones
[1:17:13] around the throne I am one of the four
[1:17:16] and twenty-four elders
[1:17:17] Simeon what if I was to go up here and
[1:17:19] say like that and I said it tonight at
[1:17:22] midnight I'm going to get such-and-such
[1:17:25] and you will see I will have this mantle
[1:17:28] wrapped around me and it happens and I
[1:17:31] could comb and show your pastor brother
[1:17:33] Jesse what if it happened whoa Jess -
[1:17:37] well that's my brother no he should feel
[1:17:40] clear on my face tear me up you're my
[1:17:44] older brother but you're still literal
[1:17:46] little and God Mania small a second
[1:17:48] spank huh he would test it by the word
[1:17:53] of God
[1:17:57] so it actually happened and the boy got
[1:18:01] a robe they said just as white as it
[1:18:04] could be he come out said didn't I tell
[1:18:06] you I prophesied true said now all of
[1:18:13] you take orders from me I'm the Old
[1:18:14] Testament prophet you know they will
[1:18:18] Bishop of that church said well some
[1:18:19] just doesn't seem right here they just
[1:18:21] let alone for a little bit and then the
[1:18:23] inspiration the Holy Ghost came and said
[1:18:24] you know what
[1:18:25] take him before Martin Martin was the
[1:18:27] prophet of the day he was the man of
[1:18:29] that day and they said they grabbed him
[1:18:31] by force now actually it went confront
[1:18:33] him said hey we're gonna bring you to
[1:18:35] Martin he said no I'm not I am
[1:18:36] commissioned not to stand before margins
[1:18:39] well what that does exactly what to do
[1:18:41] that they said that the history says
[1:18:43] that they grabbed the boy and started
[1:18:44] forcing and as soon as I grabbed into
[1:18:46] bringing the margin it disappeared but
[1:18:51] look at the deception
[1:18:52] it was manifested he did not just make a
[1:18:55] claim but what he said come the pass
[1:18:58] it was manifested in the flesh that that
[1:19:02] robe and it was a white hmm deception
[1:19:08] false teaching now what that that first
[1:19:13] instance I just read to you that just
[1:19:15] happened and the second one I'm reading
[1:19:19] to you just happened as well at the same
[1:19:23] time Martin said Satan appeared to at
[1:19:29] one time great golden crown on three or
[1:19:33] four decks of stars on it like this
[1:19:35] glistening beautiful great big fellow
[1:19:38] nice handsome correctly combed and
[1:19:41] groomed the the great beautiful robe on
[1:19:43] and his shoes on his feet was gold walk
[1:19:46] down said Martin do you know me
[1:19:47] this just happened okay this just
[1:19:51] happened I've been acquainted with these
[1:19:55] two things just happening at the exact
[1:19:56] same time this just happened while
[1:20:02] someone was preaching Martin do you know
[1:20:10] me now people that don't see visions
[1:20:12] this might not this might you might not
[1:20:14] understand it see but how things come to
[1:20:17] you in different spirits he says and how
[1:20:19] deceiving
[1:20:20] they are the Bible said they would be
[1:20:24] they were deceived a very elected if it
[1:20:27] was possible see the elected that's
[1:20:29] those that are predestinated born for
[1:20:31] that purpose see see so he come to his
[1:20:34] elected Martin was the elected what
[1:20:36] angel of God for his day he said Martin
[1:20:39] do you know me I am Christ he said will
[1:20:46] you recognize me Martin hesitated could
[1:20:49] be bad it could be good what is
[1:20:52] this what is this seemed strange he
[1:20:57] waited a minute and said again he said
[1:21:00] don't you see me I am Christ do you
[1:21:03] recognize me he said that three or four
[1:21:05] times to him Martin said Satan I know
[1:21:10] you my lord is not crowned yet but his
[1:21:14] Saints will crown him there is a word
[1:21:16] back what if these two things would take
[1:21:24] place in this church right now would you
[1:21:27] be able to discern it because it's
[1:21:31] already happened one time recently weird
[1:21:36] a very deceptive
[1:21:37] age and if you do not know your word if
[1:21:41] you will believe anything that comes
[1:21:46] your path you'll be deceived unless you
[1:21:49] are the elected of God and how many here
[1:21:52] believe they are elected of God we all
[1:21:56] believe that email we believe that Jesus
[1:21:59] Christ is going to keep us as he held
[1:22:02] those seven stars in his right hand he
[1:22:04] is gonna hold you all the way into the
[1:22:06] rapture amen
[1:22:07] praise God we believe that we cannot be
[1:22:10] shaken by that saints of God I believe
[1:22:13] your pastor my Oh pastor has taught us
[1:22:17] good enough to rely on the word and the
[1:22:21] word alone which is also the Holy Ghost
[1:22:23] amen yes
[1:22:26] because Satan will bring the word as
[1:22:28] well but it will take the Holy Ghost to
[1:22:30] discern Amen so I have experience with
[1:22:36] these things right here and it's very
[1:22:39] dangerous now looking for
[1:22:47] for one I just want to read this because
[1:22:49] it's very this is very bad
[1:22:52] I just you know first John just
[1:22:53] beautiful I in fact when I was at a time
[1:22:55] in my life where I was really low I
[1:22:56] something had happened tremendous and I
[1:22:58] could not sleep I'm an Janette and I
[1:23:02] went downstairs I read first John and it
[1:23:04] comforted me so much first time for one
[1:23:09] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[1:23:13] the spirits you're gonna have more than
[1:23:15] one battle oh yeah everyday everyday
[1:23:19] whether they are of God because many
[1:23:22] false prophets are gone out into the
[1:23:25] world hereby know ye the Spirit of God
[1:23:28] every spirit that confesses that Jesus
[1:23:30] Christ is come in the flesh is of God
[1:23:32] and every spirit that confesses not that
[1:23:35] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
[1:23:36] of God what's he talking about and this
[1:23:39] is the spirit of Antichrist where we
[1:23:41] have heard that it should come and even
[1:23:43] now already is is it in the world year
[1:23:47] of God little children and have overcome
[1:23:49] them we're believing that fully because
[1:23:51] greater is He that is in you NAND heat
[1:23:54] is in the world they they are there of
[1:23:57] the world therefore speak they of the
[1:23:59] world in the world hear them we are not
[1:24:01] of God he that knoweth God hears us he
[1:24:08] that is not of God here that's not
[1:24:10] hereby we know the Spirit of Truth and
[1:24:12] the spirit of error our pastor here has
[1:24:18] went on the internet put teaching after
[1:24:20] teaching after teaching after teaching
[1:24:22] the Bible says the words that I speak
[1:24:25] Jesus said what the words I speak are
[1:24:26] spirit and truth and life I'm Adam now
[1:24:32] here's another test you could always use
[1:24:35] we find out that
[1:24:37] Judas Iscariot came right down and went
[1:24:39] on rejoicing and preach the gospel come
[1:24:41] back hollering is shouting and have a
[1:24:43] big time with the rest of the sciples
[1:24:45] Matthew 10 sing Matthew 10 chapter 10 he
[1:24:47] says but he followed the disciples ride
[1:24:49] long yet the incarnated devil and come
[1:24:52] right along as Jesus was incarnated God
[1:24:55] and Cain and Abel from the Garden of
[1:24:57] Eden but when it come time to go to
[1:24:59] Pentecost and get the blessing he showed
[1:25:01] his colors that look the Prophet gives
[1:25:02] another test and when you go to talking
[1:25:05] about being born again hey brother god
[1:25:13] bless you oh praise the Lord good seeing
[1:25:16] you again brother of Allah hey man
[1:25:18] remember when you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:19] this and that and what was a like you
[1:25:21] know when the Holy Ghost this and the
[1:25:23] Holy Ghost adds and man isn't he
[1:25:24] wonderful when he just feels the
[1:25:26] presence of God comes into you and you
[1:25:29] start shouting and you get on the altar
[1:25:31] and you bawl your eyes out and you have
[1:25:33] a new birth and you explain exactly how
[1:25:37] it happened to you what will the other
[1:25:41] person say well he had the exact same
[1:25:42] experience or well he changed the
[1:25:46] subject
[1:25:47] will he dodge it well yeah oh that's
[1:25:50] good brother awesome now remember when I
[1:25:52] was praying on this brother they got
[1:25:53] healed on this net let's focus on the
[1:25:56] baptism the Holy Ghost when you became a
[1:25:58] new creature if you became a new
[1:26:00] creature and you all became new
[1:26:01] creatures and when you go into talking
[1:26:08] about being a born again receiving the
[1:26:10] baptism the Holy Ghost 9 times out of 10
[1:26:12] them spirits will show their colors what
[1:26:15] they are because what that spirit don't
[1:26:18] want to go to Pentecost let alone talk
[1:26:20] about it I like these little nuggets
[1:26:25] that the Prophet goes near ways to ways
[1:26:28] to see you know test the spirits Johnson
[1:26:30] test the spirits try them
[1:26:33] oh you're an apostle okay let's talk a
[1:26:38] little bit you know the pastor before
[1:26:39] invites anyone in it should have a
[1:26:41] little interview with the brother see
[1:26:43] where they're at right amen
[1:26:46] now remember when I was down there
[1:26:50] measuring that oil pit and I pulled it
[1:26:53] up in 666 right there and I was like oh
[1:26:56] god Marcis I wiped it clean and I
[1:26:58] started thought about it Lord what what
[1:27:00] were you trying to show me there what
[1:27:02] were you trying to show me there what
[1:27:03] were you trying to show me there
[1:27:06] according to the scripture when does the
[1:27:08] mark of the beast take place when does
[1:27:14] someone take the mark of the beast why
[1:27:18] is it why is the mark of the beast gonna
[1:27:20] have to become a law why has not
[1:27:26] everyone in the mark of the beast taken
[1:27:27] the mark of beasts yet if they need a
[1:27:29] law if if they have to force everyone to
[1:27:33] make a choice and they've not taken
[1:27:35] their choice yet what must be present
[1:27:39] this is what's coming to me as I'm
[1:27:41] thinking I said Lord why did you show me
[1:27:43] to get nice like Oh God Merson a wipe it
[1:27:44] off things I could because you know we
[1:27:46] don't not to do with that we have to go
[1:27:50] back to the scripture very simple and
[1:27:56] Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived
[1:27:59] and bare Cain and said I have gotten a
[1:28:01] man from the Lord right you know that's
[1:28:05] the second line of Bible and she again
[1:28:07] bare his brother Abel and able to keep
[1:28:09] her the Sheep but came to the till at
[1:28:10] the ground and the process of time it
[1:28:12] came to pass that Cain brought of the
[1:28:14] fruit of the ground an offering unto the
[1:28:16] Lord
[1:28:16] I was just had a when I was preaching in
[1:28:18] the hills of Chiang Mai and the
[1:28:20] mountains there we went to as a special
[1:28:24] celebration of the acha tribe and you
[1:28:27] know it was on their altars fruit and
[1:28:31] vegetables filled the entire altar area
[1:28:35] and I'm sitting there going right it's
[1:28:39] like
[1:28:42] fruits on the altar again for what a
[1:28:46] reason I don't know why why they were
[1:28:48] doing that exactly as I asked around
[1:28:51] they said it was to to celebrate the
[1:28:52] first fruits I don't know if I'd put it
[1:28:55] on the altar oh man because that was to
[1:28:59] scriptural for me to feel good about and
[1:29:06] Abel he also brought the first thing was
[1:29:08] flock and the fat deriving the Lord had
[1:29:10] respect and able into his offering but
[1:29:11] in the cadences offering in that respect
[1:29:13] and Cain was very wroth with his count
[1:29:15] and his countenance fallen and look what
[1:29:18] takes place and the Lord said how would
[1:29:24] the Lord how would the Lord speak to him
[1:29:26] he would have to be he had to have come
[1:29:29] down right if you look at the scripture
[1:29:35] every time someone takes the mark of the
[1:29:38] beast the Holy Ghost was there and the
[1:29:47] Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth
[1:29:49] why is thy countenance fallen in fact
[1:29:53] the Holy Ghost tries to lead him to
[1:29:54] salvation now look what the Prophet said
[1:29:57] he said and he said let them both grow
[1:30:00] together as the church natural begins to
[1:30:02] get formal and ungodly and the church
[1:30:04] spiritual is receiving greater gifts and
[1:30:06] powers from above but they're going
[1:30:09] they're both going into seed and as the
[1:30:12] world gets more wicked the church gets
[1:30:14] more powerful email they cannot be
[1:30:18] deceived their senses exercised to
[1:30:20] discern what's true and what's false a
[1:30:23] man they want more of God to design more
[1:30:26] of the gifts of spirit lying more of God
[1:30:28] himself they met I don't mean all that's
[1:30:32] called church I mean the church the
[1:30:34] born-again believers not by membership
[1:30:36] not by this but by the spirit baptized
[1:30:38] into one body Amen praise be to God and
[1:30:40] now look if thou doest well shalt thou
[1:30:43] not be accepted yes and if this doest
[1:30:48] not well look he gives them Deuteronomy
[1:30:50] obey or disobey
[1:30:53] sin lieth at the door and unto thee
[1:30:55] shall be his desire and thou shalt rule
[1:30:57] over him and Cain talked with Abel his
[1:30:59] brother and it came to pass when they're
[1:31:00] in the field that Cain rose up against
[1:31:02] his brother and slew him and the Lord
[1:31:04] said Akane look he comes God comes down
[1:31:06] again visits him gives him warning
[1:31:10] number one says just do like this and
[1:31:13] you'll be accepted Cain walked away and
[1:31:19] did the opposite
[1:31:21] workers Matthew 7 workers of iniquity
[1:31:25] I wonder why in the seventh chapter 7
[1:31:29] Church age and Cain rose up against his
[1:31:33] brother and slew him and the Lord said
[1:31:35] where is Abel thy brother and he said I
[1:31:36] know not am I my brother's keeper and he
[1:31:40] said where has he said what has thou
[1:31:42] done the voice of thy brother's blood
[1:31:44] crieth up to me from the ground and now
[1:31:46] thou art cursed from the earth right
[1:31:48] here in the presence of God
[1:31:51] he turned God down which has opened her
[1:31:56] mouth to receive thy brother's blood
[1:31:57] from thine hand jump down then to verse
[1:32:00] 15 the Lord said to him therefore
[1:32:01] whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall
[1:32:03] be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord
[1:32:05] sent a mark upon Cain lest any finding
[1:32:08] him should kill him look at verse 16 and
[1:32:10] Cain went out from the presence of the
[1:32:12] Lord and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the
[1:32:15] East of Eden he was in the presence of
[1:32:19] the oil where God comes down and now he
[1:32:26] has to make a choice obey or disobey
[1:32:34] Cain went out from the presence of the
[1:32:36] Lord now watch the first thing he done
[1:32:38] tell me he says so Cain went out from
[1:32:40] the presence of the Lord there he made
[1:32:41] his mistake and there is where you'll
[1:32:43] make your mistake and there is where
[1:32:45] I'll make the mistake ever the very
[1:32:47] minute we walk out of the presence of
[1:32:49] God Cain went from the presence of the
[1:32:53] Lord and twelve the nod the East of Eden
[1:32:55] see how religious it was it went to the
[1:32:58] east side east side remember I taught on
[1:33:00] the East Gate years ago he took the mark
[1:33:05] and
[1:33:06] remained religious he stayed and eating
[1:33:09] on the east side tavern a cold opening
[1:33:15] on the east side hey man laws well
[1:33:20] notice the second the first coming of
[1:33:23] Jesus Christ God the Holy Ghost comes
[1:33:26] down the oil is right there
[1:33:29] he starts preaching eating my flesh
[1:33:31] drink of my blood do these things if you
[1:33:33] don't drink my flesh drink my blood and
[1:33:35] eat my flesh he said there'll be no life
[1:33:37] in you you have no part of me if you
[1:33:41] don't do this did he explain it he never
[1:33:44] explained it and they said what this is
[1:33:46] a hard saying john 6:66
[1:33:54] from that time many of his disciples
[1:33:57] went back and walked no more with him
[1:34:00] the oil was present at the time of the
[1:34:05] mark of the beast the oil God was right
[1:34:12] there where am i leading up to Matthew
[1:34:16] 19 and behold one came came unto him
[1:34:19] saying good Master look at the fruits of
[1:34:21] the spirit sweet and kind to God and
[1:34:25] flesh good Master said you'll rule over
[1:34:28] you're my master what good thing shall I
[1:34:31] do that I may have eternal life and he
[1:34:34] said to Wycoff now me good there is none
[1:34:36] good but one he said that is gone he
[1:34:39] says but if thou will enter into life
[1:34:40] keep the commandments and he said to me
[1:34:42] which Jesus said thou shalt not murder
[1:34:44] thou shall not commit adultery thou
[1:34:46] shall not steal thou shalt not bear
[1:34:46] false witness honor thy father and
[1:34:49] mother mother he says and thou shalt
[1:34:51] love thy neighbor as thyself the young
[1:34:53] man said to him all these things have I
[1:34:55] kept from my youth up what lack I yet he
[1:34:59] realized he had done perfect but
[1:35:02] something within him knew he did not
[1:35:04] have eternal life yet something within
[1:35:07] him said man there was this great
[1:35:09] prophet he's now on the scene and man I
[1:35:11] I've done well have kept myself
[1:35:13] absolutely pure group and what in a good
[1:35:15] home a man did
[1:35:17] on business he wise and although is the
[1:35:19] world to make money he kept in the Bible
[1:35:23] said I'll bless you if you keep my
[1:35:25] Commandments and he's done that God
[1:35:26] blessed him and Jesus said if thou be
[1:35:31] will be perfect go and sell all that
[1:35:34] thou hast and give to the poor and thou
[1:35:36] shalt have treasure in heaven and come
[1:35:37] and follow me and when the young man
[1:35:42] heard that saying he went away sorrowful
[1:35:44] for he had many great possessions he
[1:35:46] went and left the presence of God
[1:35:51] because he could have come and follow me
[1:35:55] he had the option to be one of the
[1:35:58] disciples which what would have been one
[1:36:00] of the twelve Thrones up in heaven or
[1:36:04] even greater he had that option but he
[1:36:06] chose to leave the oil the presence of
[1:36:10] God in that day let me ask you a
[1:36:14] question did his blessing stop did he
[1:36:20] did he have a nervous breakdown fell
[1:36:21] apart and was a beggar on the streets or
[1:36:23] of his rest of his life the Prophet
[1:36:26] picked it up what in the next parable or
[1:36:28] whatever he said he became a very very
[1:36:30] rich man in his crumbs fed Lazarus one
[1:36:33] did God quit blessing him no he didn't
[1:36:38] still had and had the mark of the beast
[1:36:41] and was blessed gain is not godliness
[1:36:53] but godliness with contentment is great
[1:36:56] gain it doesn't matter what your
[1:37:00] financial ticket looks like it doesn't
[1:37:03] look like how you feel physically how
[1:37:05] you're doing right now does not matter
[1:37:07] are you in the Holy Ghost amen
[1:37:09] and is the Holy Ghost in you yes siree
[1:37:13] that's great game absolutely and we're
[1:37:19] all heading that way soon anyhow we're
[1:37:22] gonna be on we're gonna be on the
[1:37:24] streets or however but God will take
[1:37:28] care of us each one
[1:37:30] we will have to walk away from our homes
[1:37:31] we'll have to walk away from this and
[1:37:32] that because we will not take the mark
[1:37:35] of the beast and the Lord I'll say
[1:37:38] latest the Lord made it a little easy
[1:37:40] for me because I already lost a house so
[1:37:41] it's not too hard to walk away it's just
[1:37:44] trust me it's just a house I built that
[1:37:47] thing it took me an entire here but when
[1:37:48] you lose it you realize unless God
[1:37:51] allows you to keep it
[1:37:53] it's not yours in you don't be scared to
[1:37:55] let anything go your material goods mean
[1:37:58] absolutely nothing how happy do they
[1:38:00] really make you
[1:38:01] oh that brand-new car lessness let me
[1:38:05] tell you something ten years that
[1:38:06] thing's gonna be needing some repairs
[1:38:08] and it's gonna cost you in the bills are
[1:38:10] gonna hit at the wrong time at the wrong
[1:38:11] moment and your get this big begging and
[1:38:13] praying and trust me it's better to be
[1:38:16] without and have God forsake everything
[1:38:19] why would you want to keep either war
[1:38:21] when you can lose your soul oh my
[1:38:22] goodness you know we were fully ready to
[1:38:28] go and do whatever God would have us to
[1:38:30] do it by God's grace and you know he
[1:38:32] knows how to work each one of us he'll
[1:38:33] get us there have no don't even worry
[1:38:35] about don't fret just continue or like
[1:38:37] the private said about that persons that
[1:38:39] just continue on maturely go as you will
[1:38:42] and just wait on God it'll come you know
[1:38:44] we'll be all right amen
[1:38:48] now let's continue on here look at
[1:38:51] Steven now starts full the Holy Ghost
[1:38:53] starts preaching to this group here he
[1:38:56] says heaven is my throne he says earth
[1:38:59] is my footstool what house will you
[1:39:00] build me say at the Lord or what is the
[1:39:02] place of my rest hath not my hands made
[1:39:04] all things and then what the Holy Ghost
[1:39:06] kicks in and says you stiff nicht
[1:39:08] stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart
[1:39:10] and ears you do always resist the Holy
[1:39:13] Ghost as your father's did so do ye
[1:39:15] which of the prophets have not your
[1:39:18] father's persecuted and they have they
[1:39:20] have slain them with shoot which shewed
[1:39:22] before the coming of the just one of
[1:39:24] whom you have now been portrays and
[1:39:26] murders he called them out who also
[1:39:29] received the law by dispensation of
[1:39:31] angels and have not kept in all them
[1:39:33] prophets and when they heard these
[1:39:35] things they were cut - they're they're
[1:39:37] hard to the national and with their
[1:39:38] teeth but he being full the Holy Ghost
[1:39:40] looked up steadfastly and heaven saw the
[1:39:42] glory of God in Jesus
[1:39:43] standing on the right hand of God and
[1:39:45] said behold I see heavens open and the
[1:39:47] Son of Man is standing on the right hand
[1:39:48] and then they cried out with a loud
[1:39:49] voice stopped their ears and ran upon
[1:39:53] him with one Accord right there they
[1:39:56] took the mark of the beast in the
[1:39:59] presence what of the holy ghost of a man
[1:40:01] of the Holy Ghost Ananias and Sapphira
[1:40:04] brought someone falls before Peters feet
[1:40:06] he said you're a dead man you're a dead
[1:40:08] woman what they took the mark of the
[1:40:09] beast right in front of the oil amen but
[1:40:16] to reject the truth then the devil seal
[1:40:19] seals the ear faith cometh by what
[1:40:22] hearing and if your ear is sealed sealed
[1:40:25] you don't hear it anymore Oh nonsense I
[1:40:28] don't believe that stuff your pastor he
[1:40:30] never told us that he's got four college
[1:40:32] degrees he's better than these holy
[1:40:33] rollers go on your ears are sealed
[1:40:35] there's many times I've done spiritual
[1:40:38] scriptural batters battles with people
[1:40:40] and God will allow things naturally to
[1:40:42] happen one time I was in going
[1:40:44] toe-to-toe on baptism this and that and
[1:40:47] and I was dealing with an older man and
[1:40:48] this and however and it was in a darker
[1:40:50] room and I started I think we were
[1:40:53] hitting baptism or Godhead or something
[1:40:55] and he grabbed his Bible he said I can't
[1:40:57] see hold on and he went to the corner
[1:41:00] where there was a light he tried to
[1:41:02] check what I was reading was right but
[1:41:03] he said I can't see I said that's and I
[1:41:06] and at that time I just kind of quit the
[1:41:08] argument I said that's okay all's well
[1:41:11] just let him be because I knew exactly
[1:41:15] what he was saying he could not it
[1:41:17] doesn't saints of God I'm learning - you
[1:41:20] hid the gospel one time I just let's see
[1:41:23] what God does if you try to talk anyone
[1:41:25] into it trust me you can talk him out of
[1:41:28] it I've been there done that God had
[1:41:33] mercy now Pope Leo
[1:41:39] great he reigned from 440 to 461 oh he
[1:41:43] thought exact he thought he was doing
[1:41:45] exactly what was right coming to the
[1:41:47] church before him was Victor and he was
[1:41:49] a rat too he's dealing with these Pope's
[1:41:50] and come in there and how he put the
[1:41:53] Christians to death and everything else
[1:41:55] so all these Pope's come and started
[1:41:57] murdering all the Christians and look at
[1:41:59] the prophet and then he started all this
[1:42:03] and then who he says started all this
[1:42:06] putting it legalized murder you who was
[1:42:10] seen Augustine of Hippo that's exactly
[1:42:13] who did it well what's it so important
[1:42:16] st. Augustine had a great opportunity
[1:42:18] once so says the history to become a
[1:42:21] great man and be filled with the Holy
[1:42:23] Ghost he sat in the back of the yard
[1:42:26] there in Lyons France at that grace
[1:42:28] course Iranians had taught he was right
[1:42:31] in the messengers school learning about
[1:42:35] the Holy Ghost learning about the
[1:42:37] mysteries of God learned the truth
[1:42:39] sounds like today yes and them and same
[1:42:44] Arnie sit in the schoolyard and the Holy
[1:42:46] Ghost come to him but he refused to
[1:42:49] accept it
[1:42:51] Holy Ghost comes refused takes the mark
[1:42:55] of the beast and the what the prophets
[1:42:58] say he become true child twofold the
[1:42:59] child of Hell then he was to begin with
[1:43:01] when he come right down the hippo Africa
[1:43:02] where he said in school or is the market
[1:43:06] which take place when the Holy Ghost
[1:43:08] comes down or the present somehow comes
[1:43:12] to an individual Hebrews 10:26 if we sin
[1:43:17] willfully after they received the
[1:43:18] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:43:21] no more sacrifice for sins have not we
[1:43:24] received the truth we have not received
[1:43:28] anything more actually we received
[1:43:30] actually more than what Paul had
[1:43:32] revelation we have the fullness of the
[1:43:35] truth and if we were to reject this
[1:43:37] knowledge after we come to it he says
[1:43:41] there remaineth no more sin sacrifice
[1:43:43] for sins but a certain fearful looking
[1:43:47] for of a judgment of firing a nation
[1:43:49] which shall devour the adversaries he
[1:43:52] that despised Moses law
[1:43:53] died without mercy under two or three
[1:43:55] witnesses of how much sorer punishment
[1:43:57] shall ye which shall be thought worthy
[1:44:00] who have trodden under the foot of the
[1:44:02] Son of God and hath counted the blood of
[1:44:04] the Covenant oh ma where he was
[1:44:07] sanctified an unholy thing into this and
[1:44:09] has done despite unto the spirit of
[1:44:12] grace what you've come to encountered no
[1:44:17] good you've actually done to the Holy
[1:44:18] Ghost the blood of the Covenant
[1:44:22] communion we must come worthily unto the
[1:44:26] communion drink that wine in that
[1:44:28] unleavened bread with sincerity fully
[1:44:31] repented and say Lord keep me I do this
[1:44:35] in remembrance of what you did on
[1:44:37] Calvary when he accepted Jesus Christ
[1:44:41] accepted his destiny to die for our sins
[1:44:47] you know the Holy Ghost would have never
[1:44:49] been sent if he would not have denied we
[1:44:53] would not have eternal life unless he
[1:44:55] would have died if that death would have
[1:44:58] never taken place you could have never
[1:45:00] been Queen of Heaven you'd never been
[1:45:03] the bride but it took one man he had all
[1:45:06] of it within him and he said I must
[1:45:08] release this there God has a plan and
[1:45:12] I've got to release what's in me because
[1:45:14] this is what my children need a man I
[1:45:16] want to start a new race say man I want
[1:45:19] someone not just you and not just man
[1:45:21] but someone with God join with God in
[1:45:23] man hey man somewhat of a new creature a
[1:45:25] man this is if you ever received the
[1:45:29] Holy Ghost you are not who you were hey
[1:45:32] man you better we better realize and
[1:45:34] wake up who we are you are a cold and
[1:45:38] predestinated bride amen yes every time
[1:45:43] the devil comes to you you have the
[1:45:45] right and authority to put him in his
[1:45:47] place you tough you don't feel if you
[1:45:51] feel sick and body said I rebuke this I
[1:45:53] don't have a time for this and I'm
[1:45:55] moving on I meant to do it to myself
[1:45:57] many times get a plane here pain there
[1:46:01] and I'm working shoveling and I'm just
[1:46:02] about can't shovel anymore because the
[1:46:04] pain hurts and I just laid my hands on
[1:46:05] us and I rebuke this devil in the
[1:46:07] name of Jesus Christ I don't have time I
[1:46:10] have to get this job done and I have to
[1:46:11] pay my bills and I kept on going on
[1:46:13] within the day it was gone because you
[1:46:16] have to do what you got to do I don't
[1:46:20] have time to sit in and go to a hospital
[1:46:22] and do this this I have to get healed
[1:46:24] right now and I believe it's going to
[1:46:26] happen whether I feel it or not I am
[1:46:28] healed you have to purpose it determines
[1:46:30] in your heart
[1:46:31] we let the God raise up that faith
[1:46:32] that's that I am healed amen
[1:46:34] I was healed back then and I'll receive
[1:46:38] it now
[1:46:39] hey man praise God
[1:46:43] oh I love that anyhow okay we'll keep
[1:46:47] you much longer here borderline
[1:46:50] believers where did the majority of
[1:46:53] Israel take the mark of the beast'
[1:46:55] Kennish Bernina God said go Moses said
[1:46:59] Oh out at the spies was a 12 spies went
[1:47:03] out there to brought forth good reports
[1:47:05] 10 brought back false and because the
[1:47:09] police the people believed the 10 false
[1:47:12] reports even though they were true it
[1:47:14] was false music as against the scripture
[1:47:17] it absolutely looked true to the natural
[1:47:20] life but if you take the Word of God and
[1:47:22] understand what the Word of God is
[1:47:24] greater than what you see if you had a
[1:47:27] faith and understanding to say hey that
[1:47:29] what God promised in his word is more
[1:47:32] real than what I see that giant right
[1:47:36] there was gonna die just like the rest
[1:47:37] of them cuz the Word of God said so this
[1:47:39] land is ours the only way we could take
[1:47:40] the land is him to go so he's got to go
[1:47:42] somehow and God would do it yes but when
[1:47:47] they received that false report they
[1:47:50] died right there natural spiritually yes
[1:47:53] Jesus Christ said what they're dead
[1:47:54] eternally from there on out
[1:47:58] amen
[1:47:59] now going back to what I taught on a
[1:48:01] couple weeks ago why is this so powerful
[1:48:04] I taught on the days the open book I
[1:48:07] shared this with your pastor earlier and
[1:48:09] brother Jesse I and all administers and
[1:48:13] whoever is to witness whatever and they
[1:48:14] we've used these scriptures for years
[1:48:15] and years and years but I've never
[1:48:19] understood why they were an easy
[1:48:24] therefore say the seed Lord God I will
[1:48:26] even gather you from the people and
[1:48:28] assembly out of the countries where you
[1:48:30] have scattered and now give you the land
[1:48:31] of Israel and they shall come thither
[1:48:34] and they will take away all the
[1:48:36] detestable things where of and all the
[1:48:37] abominations are from thence and I will
[1:48:39] give them one heart and I'll put a new
[1:48:43] spirit within you and we'll take the
[1:48:45] stony heart out of their flesh and we'll
[1:48:47] give them a new heart of flesh is this
[1:48:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:51] no see q18 therefore I will judge you
[1:48:56] out o house of Israel out everyone out
[1:48:58] according to his ways saith the Lord God
[1:49:00] repent and turn yourselves from all your
[1:49:02] transgressions so a nikka we will not be
[1:49:04] your ruin
[1:49:05] cast away from you all your
[1:49:07] transgressions whereby you have
[1:49:08] transgressed and make you a new heart
[1:49:10] and a new spirit why we without die o
[1:49:13] house of Israel if I have no pleasure in
[1:49:15] the death of him that diet saith the
[1:49:17] Lord God
[1:49:17] wherefore turn yourselves and you shall
[1:49:19] live is this the map to the Holy Ghost
[1:49:20] no this is now the baptism the Holy
[1:49:26] Ghost this is the full work of God I
[1:49:31] would take you from among the heathen
[1:49:33] and gather you of all countries and
[1:49:34] bring them into your own land then will
[1:49:36] I sprinkle clean water upon you what was
[1:49:39] that rockbox vision by that sister of
[1:49:41] dream there was a strong man dressed
[1:49:44] like a farmer whoever he's pouring water
[1:49:46] into the rock box and it cleaned the
[1:49:48] mountain off all the dust and debris all
[1:49:51] the filth was and the I believe real
[1:49:53] answer that was him pouring it in their
[1:49:55] clean water what clean Word of God
[1:49:58] showing what pure sanctification and
[1:50:02] from your all your filthiness and from
[1:50:05] all your idols will I cleanse you a new
[1:50:07] heart will I give you in a new spirit
[1:50:09] will I put within you is that new spirit
[1:50:11] the Holy Ghost
[1:50:12] no and I'll take away the stony heart
[1:50:15] out of your flesh and I'll put a new
[1:50:16] heart of flesh and I'll put my spirit
[1:50:18] within you that there is the baptism of
[1:50:22] the Holy Ghost but why is it so
[1:50:24] important why is this brought in the
[1:50:25] days the open book because in the days
[1:50:28] of the open book when all the mysteries
[1:50:30] open it shows the true baptism of the
[1:50:32] Holy Ghost
[1:50:33] it shows you that you must be born again
[1:50:36] it shows you we must have a I was like
[1:50:38] this not a dry eyed confession but
[1:50:40] something where you died out at the
[1:50:43] altar not just a nice not look what he
[1:50:46] says he says now watch his spirit was
[1:50:48] different from your new spirit and many
[1:50:51] people get the new spirit and they think
[1:50:53] they got the Holy Spirit they get a
[1:50:55] feeling happy and jump around and maybe
[1:50:58] they do a couple of things religiously
[1:50:59] and they think they got the Holy Spirit
[1:51:01] though oh no the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit
[1:51:04] makes you act different the Holy Spirit
[1:51:06] makes you think different the Holy
[1:51:08] Spirit was put right in the middle of
[1:51:09] your new spirit building it's the work
[1:51:13] he's building building building you were
[1:51:14] to out the new image he says and your
[1:51:17] spirit was put right in the middle of
[1:51:19] your new heart the new heart the new
[1:51:20] spirit in the middle of the new heart
[1:51:21] God said I'll put my spirit in you but
[1:51:25] he's breaking the difference down
[1:51:26] between the new spirit and his spirit
[1:51:28] that is a very very important revelation
[1:51:32] that's a very important understanding he
[1:51:35] says a new a new heart will I take he
[1:51:37] says there's three of it a new heart
[1:51:39] I'll take away the stony old sterner
[1:51:42] stony heart away that's the old
[1:51:43] different heart you have and I'll give
[1:51:45] you a new spirit now many times there's
[1:51:48] been a terrible mistake the people has
[1:51:50] thought sometimes that that new spirit
[1:51:52] was the Holy Spirit but it isn't it's a
[1:51:54] new spirit God gives you a new why you
[1:51:57] couldn't even get along with yourself
[1:51:59] with your old spirit how are you going
[1:52:01] to get along with the Holy Ghost God had
[1:52:04] to give you a new spirit so he could get
[1:52:05] along with his spirit
[1:52:07] I was working downtown Toledo to
[1:52:11] high-rise and I come up to meet the
[1:52:12] maintenance guys because they're gonna
[1:52:13] show me around all these things and I
[1:52:15] shook on my hands and I said hello and
[1:52:16] he said hello and I thought he's a
[1:52:20] Christian turns out he was a Christian
[1:52:26] but he was a Baptist but he had such a
[1:52:29] sweet spirit around him and I shared the
[1:52:33] word and he's a gone all that now you
[1:52:34] know this man but he had a new spirit
[1:52:37] but many people would say oh my goodness
[1:52:39] he's full the Holy Ghost just feel the
[1:52:41] head thing around him feel the way he
[1:52:43] treats you and how he looks at you and
[1:52:44] listen Ed and how he cares about every
[1:52:46] single thing must be right brother Simon
[1:52:47] okay okay we tackle this toilet up this
[1:52:50] business and he was just really
[1:52:51] particular on how he wanted to help me
[1:52:53] in every kind of way he had a real
[1:52:55] Christian spirit about him but you did
[1:52:57] not have the Holy Ghost because I gave
[1:53:01] him the word test I hid baptism I said
[1:53:04] brother
[1:53:04] oh no you know let's just die you know
[1:53:06] it's okay and but he turned down the
[1:53:08] word absolutely now in closing I don't
[1:53:14] probably been long I want to read you
[1:53:16] something I know the snake this is mark
[1:53:20] of the beast has been kind of negative
[1:53:21] I'm not trying to I'm just there's
[1:53:23] things coming we are really the next
[1:53:26] elections coming up what if Trump
[1:53:28] doesn't get re-elected
[1:53:30] we have what we look at what we had
[1:53:32] before
[1:53:34] Antichrist Antichrist what will be the
[1:53:36] next one what if I heard there's almost
[1:53:42] sexual runnings and I'm a democratic I
[1:53:44] hope there's there's a there's a lot of
[1:53:45] crazy things out there I want to read
[1:53:50] this to you to encourage you at the end
[1:53:53] here this is a testimony of earnest
[1:53:58] family called the high calling of God
[1:54:02] given by brother Brant given by for the
[1:54:04] RAM to Ernest brother Ernest family the
[1:54:07] RAM told her and family to write a book
[1:54:09] of his life story which you can now read
[1:54:11] below in his exhortation ok this is just
[1:54:12] a this is just a couple paragraphs here
[1:54:15] but I want to I want you to read this I
[1:54:17] want you to soak this in this is
[1:54:23] beautiful if God has called you this is
[1:54:27] his testimony if God has called you to
[1:54:30] be really like Jesus in in all your
[1:54:34] spirit he will draw you into a life of
[1:54:37] crucifixion and humility
[1:54:42] he will put you on such demands of
[1:54:45] obedience that he will not allow you to
[1:54:48] follow other Christians and in many ways
[1:54:52] he will seem to let other good people do
[1:54:55] things which he will not let you do can
[1:54:59] you identify who praise God other
[1:55:05] Christians and ministers who seem very
[1:55:08] religious and useful may push themselves
[1:55:11] pull wires and work schemes to carry out
[1:55:14] their plans but you cannot do it if you
[1:55:18] attempt it you will meet you will meet
[1:55:20] with such failure and rebuke from the
[1:55:22] Lord as it will make you make you sorely
[1:55:25] penitent others can brag about
[1:55:28] themselves ministries in their work
[1:55:32] their success or their writings but the
[1:55:36] Holy Spirit will not allow you to do any
[1:55:38] such thing if you begin to he will
[1:55:42] leading you into such deep mortification
[1:55:44] that will make you despair it despise
[1:55:47] yourself and all your good works man
[1:55:53] this is encouraging I'm a complete
[1:55:58] failure thank God I am so thankful for
[1:56:04] the blood of Jesus Christ I am so
[1:56:06] thankful for him dying and coming him
[1:56:08] down and raising again and filling us
[1:56:10] with the Holy Ghost that is the only
[1:56:12] thing I can glory in it's what he did
[1:56:18] others will be allowed to succeed and
[1:56:21] making great sums of money or having a
[1:56:24] legacy left to them or in having
[1:56:28] luxuries but God may supply you daily
[1:56:31] because he wants you to have something
[1:56:33] far better than gold and that is a
[1:56:36] helpless dependence on him that he may
[1:56:40] have the privilege of providing your
[1:56:42] needs day by day out of the unseen
[1:56:44] Treasury let me tell you something I am
[1:56:49] a professional union plumber journeyman
[1:56:53] and if you would talk in private
[1:56:59] honestly with my boss and my other form
[1:57:02] in there and say hey how could a plumber
[1:57:04] side and if they're honest they will
[1:57:09] tell you the guy can't remember anything
[1:57:13] the guy's not that large
[1:57:16] he works hard but he works hard I am NOT
[1:57:23] being humble I'm being honest and
[1:57:26] factual I am NOT putting myself I am
[1:57:32] being honest and factual I am depending
[1:57:35] on Jesus Christ to get me through every
[1:57:36] day of plumbing because I'm just not
[1:57:38] that smart I'm being honest and that's
[1:57:47] why I'm telling you this because I can
[1:57:49] only be transparent but God may supply
[1:57:52] your daily you daily because he wants
[1:57:55] you to have something far better than
[1:57:57] gold and that is a helpless dependence
[1:57:59] on him that he may have the privilege of
[1:58:02] providing your needs
[1:58:03] day by day out of the unseen treasury
[1:58:05] the Lord may let others be honored and
[1:58:09] put forward but keeps you hidden away in
[1:58:17] obscurity because he wants to produce
[1:58:20] some choice fragrant fruit for his
[1:58:23] coming glory which can only produced be
[1:58:27] produced in the shade
[1:58:32] how many shade dwellers do we have here
[1:58:35] nothing big nothing famous nothing this
[1:58:38] is nothing that but you stays out of
[1:58:40] everything just God keeps him right out
[1:58:42] of protected God will let others be
[1:58:48] great but keep you small he will let
[1:58:54] others do a work for him and get the
[1:58:56] credit for it but he will make you work
[1:58:59] and toil without knowing much without
[1:59:01] much knowing much how much you are doing
[1:59:06] then to make your work still more
[1:59:08] precious you will that others get the
[1:59:10] credit for the work which you have done
[1:59:11] and this will make your award ten times
[1:59:15] greater when Jesus comes where the RAM
[1:59:18] told us me on the right these
[1:59:19] testimonies be content godliness with
[1:59:24] contentment is great gain as my as your
[1:59:29] pastor my old pastor brother Jesse said

[2:00:42] your mind that God is an infinite Savior
[2:00:44] I'm sorry it's been a sovereign and has
[2:00:47] a right to do as he pleases with his own
[2:00:50] he will not explain to you a thousand
[2:00:53] things which may puzzle your reason in
[2:00:54] his dealings with you and the other on
[2:00:57] your unanswered questions here Lord why
[2:01:00] is my life like this why Lord why am I
[2:01:02] going through this he may never even
[2:01:04] tell you but he wants to magnify himself

[2:01:18] cheer up my brother and my sister he

[2:01:34] yourself to be his slave just die out
[2:01:39] what do you only do today Lord he will
[2:01:43] wrap you up in a jealous love and let
[2:01:45] others people say and do many things
[2:01:46] that you cannot do or say settle it
[2:01:49] forever that you are to deal directly
[2:01:51] with the Holy Spirit also that he is to
[2:01:56] have the privilege of tying your tongue
[2:01:59] or chaining your hand or closing your
[2:02:01] eyes in the ways that others are not
[2:02:03] dealt with God granted now when you are
[2:02:09] so possessed with the loving God that
[2:02:12] that you are in your secret heart
[2:02:15] pleased now when you are so possessed
[2:02:18] with the loving God that you are in your
[2:02:21] secret heart pleased and delighted over
[2:02:23] this particular personal private jealous
[2:02:25] guardianship and management over the
[2:02:27] Holy Spirit over your life you will have
[2:02:30] found the vestibule of heaven if you
[2:02:34] willfully died out to yourselves and him
[2:02:40] put him number one he will keep you in
[2:02:44] such a place you will be his little
[2:02:47] secret love
[2:02:49] totally only sold out to him you have
[2:02:53] eyes for no one else and he will love
[2:02:55] you just accordingly if you look at a
[2:03:03] child a father and a father over his
[2:03:06] child a son or daughter if that father
[2:03:09] really loves that child I'll say this
[2:03:12] maybe it's a special child or or however
[2:03:15] that father will hover over that child
[2:03:18] and be very militant look very harsh
[2:03:23] well how come he is
[2:03:25] this and and and and dad you're making
[2:03:27] me do this well he gets to do this like
[2:03:28] I said you do this and you do that
[2:03:33] accordingly he's my son as well or he's
[2:03:36] my daughter as well but you are a little
[2:03:39] I want you to keep you here special from
[2:03:42] me
[2:03:44] maybe this great one over here doesn't
[2:03:47] get as much communion with God as you
[2:03:49] might get with him
[2:03:51] maybe this great one isn't giving God
[2:03:53] any time and maybe says maybe he wants
[2:03:55] communion with you someone that was
[2:03:58] willing to spend hours and hours in the
[2:04:01] prayer closet yes
[2:04:03] you make Stan saints of God I know I'm a
[2:04:09] slow teacher and I'm a little how I
[2:04:15] can't you know how I am I thought many
[2:04:17] times but I hope this was a defining to
[2:04:19] you to keep in mind great battles ahead
[2:04:23] remember if that mark of the beast is
[2:04:25] going to become a law and the majority
[2:04:29] of the world will take the mark of the
[2:04:30] beast at that time remember the Prophet
[2:04:34] said said that he that that that counsel
[2:04:37] that image will try to stop the bride
[2:04:42] what does that say about the bride the
[2:04:48] fullness of the Holy Ghost will be in
[2:04:49] her midst it will be God on earth one
[2:04:55] more time in bride form and only at that
[2:05:00] time can the mark of the beast come amen
[2:05:08] you Jesus Christ is not gonna be silent
[2:05:11] forever he's going to roar and blast and
[2:05:16] he's going to announce his coming to you
[2:05:19] no one knows the day that knows the day
[2:05:21] nor the hour but we will know the season
[2:05:23] the saints of God we are seeing things
[2:05:25] coming now
[2:05:27] some of these stories I shared through
[2:05:29] Martin have just happened
[2:05:32] I've experienced them the devil is
[2:05:35] roaring he is fighting to to nail
[2:05:38] we can cast them out daily but I'm
[2:05:41] telling you what he's coming back he is
[2:05:43] not going to quit I'm telling you right
[2:05:45] now he's not gonna quit but neither are
[2:05:47] we the Bible says that we put our face
[2:05:51] like a flint an adamant stone fearless
[2:05:54] and if we cast the devil out he don't
[2:05:58] move we cast it out again and we hold by
[2:06:00] faith and he will move I don't know when
[2:06:02] but he will move the devil cannot stop
[2:06:06] this move of Jesus Christ this next book
[2:06:09] of Acts is going to be unstoppable
[2:06:13] God has gone to take her off the scene
[2:06:15] because she would take over
[2:06:17] remember if God is in the bride what did
[2:06:21] Jesus Christ do when he came down he
[2:06:23] destroyed the devil's kingdom what are
[2:06:24] those in the book of Acts do they
[2:06:25] destroy to keep Devils Kingdom and if we
[2:06:27] produced that same Viet that that if
[2:06:30] that branch comes out again and we
[2:06:31] produced another book of Acts it will
[2:06:33] destroy the devil's kingdom again so
[2:06:37] Lord will have to swoop down and take us
[2:06:38] before we produced the Millenium
[2:06:42] premature let's bow our heads do you
[2:06:47] believe that you're the bride if there's
[2:06:50] anything on your heart if you need
[2:06:51] prayer for anything just raise your
[2:06:54] hands acknowledge it before the Lord
[2:06:56] speak to him real quick here
[2:06:59] anything wrong we've done just say Lord
[2:07:01] forgive us he's that quick he's he's a
[2:07:04] long-suffering God if he can put up with
[2:07:07] 40 years of the Israelites murmuring
[2:07:11] complaining and they didn't have 200
[2:07:14] extra million demons on them
[2:07:16] didn't have to go out in the world and
[2:07:18] hear rock and roll every day and cuss
[2:07:20] words and filth and they didn't have to
[2:07:22] see billboards and all those things
[2:07:24] surely God can forgive us let's bow our
[2:07:28] heads your other father Lord Jesus we
[2:07:30] just love you and though we just pray
[2:07:32] Lord you had your way you said
[2:07:34] everything you wanted to say and Lord
[2:07:38] Jesus Lord we are going to be patient
[2:07:39] over there
[2:07:40] my pastor backhauling been going through
[2:07:42] the statue of a perfect man when he had
[2:07:44] patience and he really really reiterated
[2:07:47] some of the things that the Prophet is
[2:07:48] through a prophet and said Lord and you
[2:07:51] know that the if you could sum up
[2:07:52] patience in one word or two or three
[2:07:55] words it would be just have patience
[2:07:58] with Jesus Christ and Lord all we would
[2:08:01] want your kingdom come now and though
[2:08:04] we'd want to be the rapture right now
[2:08:06] and though we want to be have that
[2:08:08] refilling in that ladder ain't right now
[2:08:10] Lord we are gonna wait on you but we
[2:08:14] have full confidence Lord and your being
[2:08:16] we know that you are in full control we
[2:08:20] know that you know everything is going
[2:08:21] to happen and Lord we take full
[2:08:24] consolation God the Lord you have
[2:08:26] something good plan for each one of
[2:08:28] their lives here Lord and Lord you have
[2:08:30] something good and not evil for them nor
[2:08:32] do you have a perfect way Lord and great
[2:08:35] blessings at the end of the road know
[2:08:37] what I pray you you would deal with each
[2:08:39] one Lord just like Ernest family Lord
[2:08:41] make each one Lord a little love same of
[2:08:43] yours got an order set aside just for
[2:08:46] you boy if we're not given the spotlight
[2:08:49] or me we just you just keep us happy and
[2:08:52] joyful Lord for the Holy Ghost in the
[2:08:54] shade who loved you so much
