[5:25] familiar faces and maybe some new ones
[5:27] that i hadn't seen before i don't know
[5:28] my memory is not always that good but
[5:31] uh we're grateful to be here by the
[5:32] grace of god i know
[5:34] last time it was we definitely fought a
[5:36] lot of battles when we were here last
[5:38] time but you know what we're still
[5:39] pressing the battle for overcoming
[5:41] you know we overcome
[5:43] by the testimony of jesus christ and by
[5:45] the blood of the lamb
[5:47] and we're still to see soldiers of
[5:48] christ still here standing and
[5:50] fighting and it's encouraging to me you
[5:53] know good to see sister christian again
[5:55] i'm going to get to see you last time
[5:57] and the the new addition to the family
[5:59] and i remember last time when i was here
[6:01] we were talking just about the he was
[6:03] the the the name that he was gonna have
[6:05] and good to see that the lord made good
[6:07] on his promises that he's here and
[6:09] looking strong and
[6:10] just good to see all those things i'm uh
[6:13] encouraged it encourages me and
[6:15] um
[6:17] i just want pray
[6:19] by his grace to be a blessing
[6:22] we'll just go right into the word
[6:24] if we can
[6:26] maybe we'll sing some songs
[6:29] after service or tomorrow or some of the
[6:31] other services but we'll just go right
[6:32] into the word this evening you just pray
[6:34] for me
[6:36] uh you know
[6:38] the more you serve the lord the more
[6:39] real the more you realize that you're
[6:41] nothing without him
[6:43] you know i think about how brother
[6:44] branham would be up on the up on the
[6:46] platform and they say what are you
[6:47] waiting for brother brandon saying i'm
[6:48] waiting for him
[6:50] because he can't do anything without him
[6:52] and that's who we're trusting this
[6:53] evening you know we can do nothing
[6:54] without him
[6:56] so if we could let's just turn in our
[6:58] bibles
[7:00] to philippians
[7:01] chapter 2 verse 5.
[7:04] and also
[7:06] we'll be going to isaiah chapter 55.
[7:15] we'll start in
[7:20] the book of philippians chapter 2 verse
[7:22] 5.
[7:25] familiar passage of scripture
[7:28] just want to share some things that have
[7:30] been on my heart
[7:32] you know if the lord would be gracious
[7:34] to us just to help express it the way he
[7:36] shows it to me in the way
[7:38] you know he's revealed it unto me and
[7:40] words can't you know it's amazing
[7:42] because the scripture says that he chose
[7:43] the foolishness of preaching and it
[7:46] truly is in a way foolish if you think
[7:48] about it because how could natural words
[7:50] really express the supernatural things
[7:52] of god
[7:53] but by he he does that you know to show
[7:57] that it's it's not by power it's not by
[7:59] might it's not by man's ability it's not
[8:02] by my ability as a speaker or your
[8:05] ability even as a hearer to understand
[8:07] but it's by his spirit saith the lord
[8:10] and so we're relying on that holy ghost
[8:12] that's among us right now
[8:14] you know we we know by his promises
[8:16] where two or three are gathered he would
[8:17] be there in the midst doesn't matter if
[8:19] you feel him it doesn't matter if you
[8:21] don't feel him doesn't matter if you
[8:23] feel good doesn't matter if you feel bad
[8:26] it doesn't matter what you can see with
[8:27] your eyes or what you can think with
[8:29] your mind or understand
[8:32] it's what he said
[8:34] and when we come to if we could boil it
[8:36] down to the simplicity of the word of
[8:38] god to just trust what he said
[8:40] that he will be here
[8:44] i could speak all i want to
[8:46] and no matter how much i would want you
[8:48] to understand the things that the lord
[8:50] has shown me i could never do it
[8:52] could how many of us maybe have loved
[8:54] ones that we would love i i expressed
[8:56] this at the church there how you've been
[8:57] preaching but this isn't maybe the
[8:59] direction i want to go but just uh
[9:01] before we even get into the word to
[9:03] understand how simple it is really
[9:06] how many loved ones we would have we
[9:08] would love to just grab them and shake
[9:10] them and just force the word into their
[9:12] hearts and say just take it because it's
[9:14] life but no matter how much that would
[9:16] be our desire a good desire it is to
[9:18] have we desire that
[9:20] it's only it's only god himself that can
[9:22] break it to that heart
[9:24] it's only god himself that could reveal
[9:27] it to an individual you know as much as
[9:29] our desires would be to that it's in his
[9:32] time and it's for his glory
[9:34] you know we want to give all glory to
[9:36] god
[9:37] you know i always appreciate brother
[9:38] jesse you know because
[9:41] his emphasis i have always seen has been
[9:42] upon jesus christ
[9:44] it's not upon any man it's not upon any
[9:46] movement
[9:47] it's not nothing no man but jesus christ
[9:50] no movement but the movement of the
[9:51] spirit of god is what we want to see why
[9:53] because if i could say anything i say
[9:55] lord if there's any mighty thing done
[9:57] while i'm here may it just be because
[10:00] lord you gave me grace just to be here
[10:02] while you did it that's all i want
[10:06] and if i'm not there when he did it i'll
[10:07] rejoice in the testimony of those that
[10:09] were able to be there when he did it
[10:10] that's all we want because whether it be
[10:13] you know done through us or through
[10:15] someone else or the lord whatever vessel
[10:17] he says it's god that gets the glory so
[10:19] that's who we're here to glorify i never
[10:21] want to glorify anything but the name of
[10:23] the lord jesus christ
[10:26] amen so in philippians chapter two verse
[10:29] five
[10:32] scripture we know this and we'll read a
[10:33] couple verses it says let this mind be
[10:35] in you
[10:37] which was also in christ jesus
[10:40] who being in the form of god thought it
[10:42] not robbery to be equal with god
[10:44] but made himself of no reputation and
[10:46] took upon him the form of a servant and
[10:49] was made in the likeness of men
[10:51] and being found in fashion as a man he
[10:54] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[10:57] death even the death of the cross
[11:01] wherefore god also hath highly exalted
[11:04] him and given him a name which is above
[11:06] every name
[11:07] that at the name of jesus every knee
[11:09] should bow of things in heaven and
[11:11] things and earth and things under the
[11:12] earth and that every tongue should
[11:15] confess that jesus christ is lord to the
[11:17] glory of god the father
[11:19] amen and we'll turn to isaiah chapter
[11:21] 55.
[11:39] uh
[11:43] we'll start at verse 6
[11:47] seek ye the lord while he may be found
[11:50] call ye upon him while he is near
[11:52] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[11:54] unrighteous man his thoughts
[11:56] and let him return unto the lord and he
[11:59] will have mercy upon him
[12:01] and to our god for he will abundantly
[12:03] pardon
[12:05] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[12:08] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[12:10] lord for as the heavens are higher than
[12:12] the earth so are my ways higher than
[12:14] your ways and my thoughts than your
[12:17] thoughts
[12:18] for as the rain cometh down
[12:20] and the snow from heaven and returneth
[12:22] not thither but water at the earth and
[12:23] maketh that bring forth and bud that it
[12:26] may give seed to the sower and bread to
[12:27] the eater so shall my word be that goes
[12:30] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[12:32] return unto me void but it shall
[12:34] accomplish that which i please and it
[12:36] shall prosper in the thing whereto i
[12:39] sent it
[12:41] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[12:43] of prayer heavenly father lord jesus
[12:47] lord we're but a humble simple people oh
[12:49] god
[12:50] lord you said even in your word that
[12:53] not many mighty not many
[12:56] rich of the world's goods or
[12:58] intelligent maybe in mind according to
[13:01] the flesh and all these mighty things
[13:02] were called according to the world but
[13:04] you chose the humble things yes lord you
[13:07] chose the the base things of this world
[13:09] lord lord because you get glory in those
[13:12] things oh god
[13:14] lord for you said in
[13:17] in our weakness
[13:20] your strength was made perfect lord
[13:22] lord we even
[13:24] your your servant paul said he said i
[13:27] came not in excellency of speech
[13:29] but in power and demonstration he said i
[13:32] didn't come in
[13:33] carnal strength but in fear and in much
[13:36] trembling
[13:38] and lord how i even feel that way this
[13:40] evening lord knowing that i'm nothing
[13:43] lord but it's fallen my lot lord to
[13:45] stand behind the sacred desk oh god
[13:48] knowing the responsibility that it is oh
[13:50] god to speak to your bride
[13:52] to speak to your people oh god and i
[13:54] would be
[13:55] lord i would be
[13:57] an arrogant individual to think that i
[13:58] could just take my own thoughts
[14:01] and pass them off as your own
[14:03] but lord i believe you've given me
[14:05] an unction lord a thought that's in your
[14:07] word oh god to bring forth to your
[14:09] people lord
[14:10] and far be it for me to express my own
[14:12] ideas or thoughts oh god but may we just
[14:14] take the words that have been spoken oh
[14:16] god and the unction of the spirit and go
[14:18] forth oh god to speak to your people
[14:20] may they receive with open hearts as we
[14:23] even sing the song lord may we have open
[14:25] hearts to receive your word oh god
[14:28] lord and if there be anything that would
[14:29] be spoken oh god that would be of my own
[14:31] mind lord will you forgive me
[14:33] lord may the the hearers spit out the
[14:35] seeds as we heard you're even your
[14:37] prophet say
[14:38] lord we don't want any of those things
[14:39] oh god but just the pure unadulterated
[14:42] word of god for this hour may we just
[14:44] lord just rejoice in that lord knowing
[14:47] that lord you do all things well
[14:50] lord and you said you would be with your
[14:51] people and we just committed now
[14:53] lord that
[14:54] lord we can read the words but only your
[14:56] spirit lord can reveal it to the heart
[14:58] of the believer
[15:00] we commit it right now into your hands
[15:01] we just ask that your perfect will be
[15:03] done in the name of jesus christ we pray
[15:05] amen
[15:06] amen you may be seated
[15:09] i just you know i often maybe sometimes
[15:12] seem like i'm rambling at the beginning
[15:13] of a service but i just feel you know
[15:14] kind of almost in a way like the prophet
[15:16] i know i can't do anything until he
[15:18] would give the inspiration
[15:20] i certainly don't have that kind of gift
[15:22] but
[15:22] i i know that until until the lord
[15:25] really gives the utterance you know i'm
[15:26] not
[15:28] my wife would tell you i'm not uh i'm
[15:30] not very good at
[15:31] you know studying as much as others do i
[15:34] just kind of
[15:35] meditate upon the word of god and try to
[15:37] listen to the word of god listen you
[15:40] know to the messenger and try to
[15:41] understand and let the lord drop
[15:43] thoughts in there but then i always find
[15:44] when the lord will give me thoughts to
[15:46] put it down to paper to maybe have notes
[15:48] to have things organized that just fails
[15:50] me
[15:51] so i have to i just i i admit that fault
[15:54] before you because if it seems broken up
[15:56] it's because i i know i have to rely
[15:58] fully upon god
[15:59] to give the inspiration
[16:02] because he didn't give me that gift
[16:03] maybe to be very organized in my
[16:05] thoughts but you know i find you know it
[16:07] helps me to lean upon his arm
[16:10] lean upon his inspiration
[16:12] and you know i i find in our our the
[16:15] time just the thought and i
[16:17] had uh such a
[16:19] even this trip so far has been a
[16:20] blessing to me even though i just got in
[16:22] town yesterday i flew into detroit and
[16:25] and uh was a little far away but the
[16:27] flights were a little bit cheaper and
[16:28] the rental cars were a little bit
[16:30] cheaper and found out that rental cars
[16:31] are in short supply and
[16:33] and you just uh you know you forgive me
[16:35] i maybe if you saw that fancy sports car
[16:38] out there it's not because i wanted it i
[16:40] was supposed to drive a toyota corolla
[16:42] but when they
[16:43] when they when i got to there they said
[16:44] they didn't really have anything so they
[16:46] upgraded me to a fancy ford mustang so
[16:49] it's not that i'm getting puffed up in
[16:51] my flesh and wanting to drive a fancy
[16:52] sports car the lord saw fit to to give
[16:55] me uh you know i thought about it i said
[16:57] well isn't it fitting you know remember
[16:59] we understand a a beast is a power
[17:02] and it's like kind of like i you know
[17:05] and it say the the devil's like well
[17:07] it's just like a red horse you're just
[17:08] riding a red horse like a red horse
[17:09] rider i said you know i said this is a
[17:11] little bit different because i said this
[17:13] one's just covered in the blood of jesus
[17:14] christ
[17:16] and i said i said just like that
[17:17] brother's dream i think that brother
[17:18] brady said i'm riding on it i'm just
[17:20] gonna ride on that on that blood-covered
[17:23] that blood-covered horse all the way
[17:25] into
[17:25] in into eternity so i said you know what
[17:28] lord have your way i didn't i wasn't
[17:30] asking for it i feel a little bit almost
[17:32] ashamed to drive it but
[17:34] you know but the the lord you know the
[17:36] lord knows what he's doing he knows how
[17:38] to humble his people but i had a chance
[17:40] i had a chance to express it to brother
[17:42] jesse
[17:43] you know i had a chance to fellowship
[17:44] with my grandfather and the lord even
[17:47] blessed in that i i dropped by this
[17:49] little hamburger place that i really
[17:50] like to go to that's near where my
[17:52] relatives live up there and i always
[17:55] like to go there because they have
[17:56] really greasy delicious little
[17:57] hamburgers and it's just like a little
[17:59] hole in the wall you know place and i
[18:01] went and got some of those and my plan
[18:03] my initial plan was to go pick up these
[18:05] hamburgers and then go drop by my
[18:07] grandfather's house and surprise him and
[18:09] and so you know like oh let's have lunch
[18:11] together and and everything and i showed
[18:13] up and he wasn't there
[18:14] and i was like well i didn't want to
[18:16] call him because i really i i don't know
[18:18] just it's my heart i always like to show
[18:19] up and just be a surprise i i kind of
[18:22] like doing that i thought it was if i
[18:23] called him it kind of ruined the
[18:24] surprise so i called brother jesse i was
[18:26] like well i'm just going to eat these
[18:27] hamburgers i guess and wait
[18:28] i got the hamburgers i might as well eat
[18:30] them so
[18:31] i started eating the hamburgers and i
[18:32] was like well i i got halfway through
[18:35] it's like well i'll call brother jesse
[18:36] and just let them know i'll come out a
[18:37] little bit earlier than i thought
[18:39] and and weird's like well when we just
[18:41] have some fellowship afterwards i was
[18:42] like well hopefully be there around 6 30
[18:44] and i hung up and i was eating the last
[18:46] hamburger and within
[18:47] probably not even with a minute of
[18:49] hanging up a brother jesse i was eating
[18:51] the last hamburger and my grandpa pulled
[18:53] up and so i quickly scrambled to call
[18:54] for brother jesse it's like change of
[18:56] plans again
[18:57] and uh but you know brother jesse's
[18:58] always gracious you know in those things
[19:00] and he just said well the lord you know
[19:02] fellowship with your grandfather had a
[19:04] chance to talk with him a few hours
[19:06] which is really nice to see him then i
[19:08] just test to find jesse you know he's
[19:10] he's going to be 84 years old in october
[19:14] and he is like a caleb i mean he lives
[19:16] by himself
[19:18] you know and he's just as sharp and is
[19:20] on the ball mentally as anybody you i
[19:22] mean you wouldn't be able to tell the
[19:23] difference of anybody else you'd meet i
[19:25] mean he can he can talk your ear off
[19:27] he's got you know it's just and he works
[19:29] on other people's houses he's got a
[19:30] truck and he goes and does handyman work
[19:32] for people he he was just telling me
[19:34] when he when he when he came back he
[19:36] said i was just over his neighbor's
[19:38] house they'd been running all these fans
[19:40] and the circuit breaker kept going off
[19:42] and so he went and put in a new circuit
[19:44] breaker for him and was running wire and
[19:46] i i pull up to his house and he's got
[19:48] he's got a two-story house and there's a
[19:50] ladder on the side of the house going
[19:51] all the way up to the roof he climbs
[19:52] he's 84 years old climbs up on the roof
[19:55] of his house and throws branches off
[19:56] when they fall off the trees and i just
[19:58] say i said praise the lord you know and
[20:01] and
[20:02] and uh you know and he serves the lord
[20:04] you know the the best that he can and
[20:06] and he and he was just kind of
[20:08] testifying to me about you know he about
[20:10] the coming of the lord and he said and
[20:12] he said his one he said my one prayer to
[20:14] god was that if i'm gonna see the coming
[20:17] of the lord or be around at the end time
[20:19] he said i just want to be healthy
[20:21] you know and he's healthy the lord has
[20:23] honored that because we know we're at
[20:25] the coming of the lord i believe with
[20:27] all my heart that we're we're on the
[20:28] precipice of
[20:30] of the catching of the
[20:32] catching away of the bride you know i
[20:34] believe it's just over that next bend i
[20:36] don't know how it's going to come or or
[20:38] the timing exactly but i really believe
[20:41] we're right there
[20:43] and uh and i was just encouraged to see
[20:45] that the lord even honored his prayer
[20:47] because he's you know i'm sure he has
[20:48] his aches and pains i mean as you get
[20:50] older that's just part of you know the
[20:52] the breaking down of this vessel of clay
[20:54] that we have but to see him i mean he i
[20:56] remember when i was a child probably at
[20:59] least 20 years ago he had major open
[21:01] heart surgery i think he had like a
[21:02] triple or quadruple bypass and i think
[21:05] they put a pacemaker in and that was
[21:06] when he was in his 50s and now he's 84
[21:08] and still going
[21:10] i was like lord if you can do that for
[21:12] him and just to see to see that if you
[21:14] can do that for this old broken down
[21:16] flesh how much more can you do it for
[21:18] the spirit man
[21:19] for the for the spirit we don't we don't
[21:21] we rejoice over those things but we're
[21:23] looking for a a rejoicing of the inward
[21:25] man you know we're not looking to exalt
[21:28] the the flesh because that's gotta pass
[21:29] away we're gonna drop this away and pick
[21:32] up a a redeemed body but we're looking
[21:34] for something we're looking for a city
[21:36] whose builder and maker is god
[21:38] so you know i was just greatly grateful
[21:40] for that it encouraged me
[21:42] you know i really you know try to drop
[21:45] in a few things here and there as much
[21:46] as i can you know to maybe push like
[21:49] there's something a little bit more than
[21:50] you know with the message of the hour to
[21:52] try to push to that and we're just
[21:53] planting seeds and you know and trusting
[21:56] that the lord would bring that to
[21:57] fruitfulness and we left from there and
[22:00] i talked to my wife when i was driving i
[22:01] was planning on just coming right out
[22:03] here and getting to the hotel at about
[22:05] 10 30 or so and and then i just kind of
[22:07] thought well i was thinking because i
[22:09] know brother simon was initially going
[22:11] to come out with us and join us and he
[22:12] wasn't able to
[22:14] and uh and i was thinking about calling
[22:16] brother cam but i know he's kind of on
[22:18] his little kind of a mini vacation out
[22:19] there and i was like well i don't really
[22:20] want to bother him i was like i'll just
[22:22] call brother simon and say hello since
[22:24] we're not going to get a chance to see
[22:25] each other
[22:26] and uh wouldn't you know it you were
[22:27] eating they were eating dinner
[22:29] in uh in in toledo and it was maybe just
[22:32] 10
[22:33] 15 minutes off the path or so that i was
[22:35] driving and he's like we're at texas
[22:37] roadhouse he's like do you want
[22:38] something you know brother simon he's
[22:39] just like you want something i was like
[22:41] i was like you know what brother order
[22:43] me a steak so i had to order me a steak
[22:44] and and i just went off there and was
[22:47] able to fellowship with him we had a
[22:48] wonderful time and it's just the lord
[22:50] knows how to to just you know he he i
[22:53] even when we read the scripture he can
[22:55] you know
[22:56] in ephesians that says we'll read that
[22:57] scripture maybe later it says he'll do
[22:59] abundantly even about what you can ask
[23:01] or think you know and the lord knew the
[23:02] desire of my heart maybe that we didn't
[23:04] get to see each other but we just gave a
[23:06] little taste you know a fellowship that
[23:08] we might not have been able to have
[23:09] otherwise and and by the grace of god i
[23:11] got that bill from brother simon and he
[23:13] didn't even know it and if anybody you
[23:15] know brother simon he he
[23:17] you got to get up pretty early in the
[23:19] morning to get a bill on brother simon
[23:21] but uh
[23:23] i was so i was rejoicing in that so
[23:26] i was grateful i i told brother simon i
[23:28] i went in there and i was kind of
[23:30] surveying the land i felt like the spies
[23:31] and you know the spies going over the
[23:33] promised lane i went into the texas
[23:35] roadhouse and i was kind of looking
[23:36] around and i didn't see him in the front
[23:38] half of the the building and i was kind
[23:40] of scanning and i looked out and he was
[23:42] at a table like all the way at the other
[23:44] end straight through and i saw him and i
[23:46] kind of backed off a little bit and i
[23:48] found a waitress and flagged her down
[23:49] and i was like i was like do you see
[23:51] that guy over there in the glasses
[23:53] over there
[23:54] and and she's like i can't really see
[23:56] him because i don't have my glasses on
[23:57] and i kind of we leaned over there to
[23:59] kind of look and he looked right at me
[24:01] all the way across he looked right at me
[24:03] but he didn't recognize me for as i said
[24:05] his eyes were where his eyes didn't
[24:08] didn't behold me at the time the lord
[24:10] kind of laid it on there and we were
[24:11] able to track down the waitress and i
[24:13] gave her my credit card i said i don't
[24:14] care what this guy says i said you pay
[24:17] for the meal with this card and so we
[24:19] were able to do that and that was a
[24:20] blessing but to have the the fellowship
[24:22] and everything so i just
[24:24] i appreciate
[24:25] the little things that the lord does for
[24:27] us you know so many times we're looking
[24:29] for all these great major things and
[24:31] surely we get those too
[24:33] and sometimes we look we don't look
[24:35] enough to those things but i i certainly
[24:37] don't want to ever overlook you know the
[24:39] little things that who has despised the
[24:41] day of small things you know and he does
[24:43] because he's mindful if he's mindful the
[24:44] big things he's mindful of the little
[24:46] things
[24:47] you know i i i you think about the fact
[24:49] that the lord cared so much that
[24:52] he made food that you would like to eat
[24:54] that you would enjoy he made he made uh
[24:57] places that you would like to go and
[24:59] behold beauty and you could see that he
[25:01] thought about you when he made those
[25:02] things
[25:03] he wasn't just making it for himself he
[25:05] was designing it i believe even brother
[25:07] branham in some ways talked about you
[25:09] know for for a man getting married to a
[25:11] wife and how he would want to know all
[25:13] the things in the way she liked it in
[25:15] such a way to design it a certain way so
[25:17] that she could enjoy it and god has done
[25:20] that in this life for us you know he
[25:22] knew that i would like the color blue
[25:23] and and brother jesse just do because
[25:25] he's wearing a blue suit and we're all a
[25:27] lot of us wearing blue this evening and
[25:28] i'd say you know praise the lord for
[25:30] that because you know the lord doesn't
[25:32] he doesn't do anything without a purpose
[25:35] you know he doesn't he didn't make steak
[25:39] it's where i would love it the way i do
[25:41] if it wasn't for the fact that i believe
[25:43] he had me in mind when he made it you
[25:45] know i and that's maybe a little thing
[25:46] but i rejoice when i get to enjoy those
[25:49] things because you know god thought
[25:51] about me when he did that
[25:53] and he thought about you when he made
[25:54] the things that he allowed you to enjoy
[25:56] even though they may be little and and
[25:58] he thought about you when he brought the
[26:00] atmosphere of the holy ghost that we
[26:01] could enjoy and rejoice in his presence
[26:04] you know it's not we realize worship
[26:06] worship isn't even just about us but
[26:08] it's about him but it's not even just
[26:10] about him but it's about us to come into
[26:13] fellowship with him to because he knows
[26:15] that the only place we could be complete
[26:17] is in his presence
[26:20] because the only place he could be
[26:21] complete is when we're with him
[26:27] and so he designed these things in such
[26:29] a way so i just say all that is just a
[26:31] little testimony even since i've been
[26:33] here you know i i i've asked the lord
[26:36] many times like lord don't let me
[26:38] go over the top of these things and miss
[26:40] the little things that you're doing
[26:42] because i wanna those are testimonies to
[26:43] me maybe it seems little to you but i
[26:46] see something along the lines of you
[26:48] know within a minute or it might have
[26:50] even been less than a minute of hanging
[26:51] up with brother jesse the lord knew my
[26:53] heart's desire was to flush with my
[26:55] grandfather and he pulls up there right
[26:57] when you know he knew my heart's desire
[26:59] that's not a small god doesn't do
[27:00] anything by accident
[27:03] the world likes to pawn everything off
[27:05] of even very creation is just an
[27:07] accident of happenstance and things just
[27:09] happened and you're an accident and here
[27:11] you are because primordial goo mutated
[27:14] over the course of billions and billions
[27:15] of years you're not an accident god has
[27:18] you right here
[27:19] at bride of christ fellowship
[27:21] on this evening i don't know what the
[27:23] date is today on friday the 13th the
[27:25] world calls it a spooky thing you know
[27:27] it's a superstitious day but god has you
[27:30] here and it's not a superstition
[27:32] but it's the power of god to bring you
[27:35] here on this evening to hear the word of
[27:37] god
[27:39] god doesn't do anything by accident he
[27:42] doesn't make mistakes our god is perfect
[27:45] and holy
[27:47] we don't give him enough glory we don't
[27:49] rejoice in him enough many times because
[27:51] we think woe is me and and i'm not even
[27:54] going anywhere i was thinking in the in
[27:56] there but
[27:57] we'll get into the word here in a second
[28:00] but he'll often times what would be and
[28:02] why is this happening you're right where
[28:03] god needs to be
[28:06] even if you made a mistake
[28:09] yeah you may have made mistakes and put
[28:10] yourself in situations and in the improv
[28:13] in the permissive will of god but if but
[28:16] god our prophet told us god has a way to
[28:18] take that even and turn it to his
[28:20] perfect will
[28:23] you know to our brother austin that i
[28:24] heard brother jesse talking about god at
[28:27] this moment he he put it on your heart
[28:29] to come back to him for such a time as
[28:32] this
[28:33] it's not an accident
[28:37] yeah many times we suffer things we
[28:39] didn't need to suffer because we didn't
[28:40] listen to his voice because we didn't
[28:43] hearken into his words and we suffered
[28:45] things we didn't have to
[28:46] and we put ourselves in bad positions
[28:49] but that's why paul said forgetting
[28:51] those things that are behind
[28:52] i press towards the mark of the high
[28:54] calling
[28:56] i don't know whether or not it was god's
[28:58] perfect will that paul stood there at
[29:01] the stoning of stephen but i do know
[29:03] that our prophet said that god used that
[29:06] to drive paul to never make those
[29:08] mistakes again so even in that he could
[29:11] rejoice
[29:13] so don't let the devil make you think
[29:15] that any mistakes that happen or
[29:17] anything that god can't you yes we we
[29:20] ought to repent of those things we ought
[29:21] to actually have a godly sorrow i don't
[29:23] think we saw her enough sometimes
[29:25] because sometimes we get so
[29:26] predestinated we just relax the days ago
[29:29] we turned the grace of god to
[29:30] lasciviousness
[29:32] oh well god you must have predestinated
[29:34] that i was actually talking to to
[29:36] brother brooks uh brother isaiah brooks
[29:38] uh yesterday when i was flying and he
[29:40] kind of made that same statement that
[29:41] just stuck with that struck me he said
[29:43] so many times we get so predestinated to
[29:46] where we think oh god you must have seen
[29:48] that mistake that must have been your
[29:50] will no it wasn't god's will that it
[29:51] would happen
[29:53] but he knew that it would
[29:55] and he provided a sacrifice to cover
[29:57] that mistake
[30:00] we don't rejoice in the mistake but we
[30:02] rejoice in a god who can use us in spite
[30:05] of our mistakes who can cover up he said
[30:08] it's a it's a it's a it's a greater
[30:11] thing to cover a thing
[30:13] to cover a multitude of sins love covers
[30:16] a multitude of sins
[30:20] love hides the issue god's love his
[30:23] blood hides our iniquities and our sins
[30:26] that we go through every single day
[30:32] praise the lord for that because if it
[30:33] wasn't i wouldn't be here right now all
[30:35] the mistakes i've made in the last month
[30:38] in the last week and the last day
[30:42] and the hour man
[30:44] but praise god there is a blood
[30:47] praise god there is a holy ghost praise
[30:50] god there is a land that was slain
[30:52] before the foundation of the world for
[30:54] my iniquity for your iniquity
[30:58] and what i kind of want to talk about
[30:59] this evening
[31:01] that's just really been on my heart if i
[31:02] would give a title to the message
[31:04] this evening i would just say
[31:06] what are we expecting
[31:11] i find it kind of a it's kind of a
[31:15] i've really had another thing that's
[31:17] really been on my heart and i've
[31:18] listened to the message a couple of
[31:20] couple of them here recently of a
[31:21] paradox
[31:24] and brother bram talks about how a
[31:25] paradox is something that's incredible
[31:27] yet it's true
[31:28] another another uh another definition
[31:31] you could also give for a paradox is
[31:33] something that happens even though
[31:35] there's an apparent contradiction
[31:38] you know in the scientific realm they
[31:40] talk about paradoxes and different
[31:41] things you know they i always i've
[31:44] always been interested in science you
[31:46] know the world worships it now you know
[31:48] but god created science
[31:50] god created the atoms and the molecules
[31:52] and i believe that god can use science
[31:54] for his glory if you would if people
[31:55] would allow it
[31:56] but we see even our prophet seen years
[32:00] and years ago all those years ago he
[32:02] could see that seed
[32:03] of of a religious fervor that would be
[32:06] upon science and how they would man
[32:07] would worship it and become a worshiper
[32:10] of science and what do we see now
[32:11] everywhere science science science if
[32:14] you don't believe this you don't believe
[32:15] in science if you don't do this if you
[32:17] don't believe in god you don't believe
[32:19] in science
[32:23] science tries to disprove god but i'll
[32:25] tell you what god is the only one that
[32:27] can prove science
[32:30] because the things that are made are
[32:32] made of the things that do not appear
[32:34] god said let there be and those little
[32:36] atoms burst into existence
[32:40] you know the scripture says it would be
[32:42] in that day he said there'd be
[32:43] accusations of science falsely so-called
[32:47] they're calling it science and it's just
[32:49] nothing but their their feeble attempt
[32:51] to prove god wrong but that's all right
[32:53] we know where we stand
[32:55] but i thought about i thought about
[32:56] these things and
[32:58] you know a paradox seems to be an
[32:59] apparent contradiction
[33:01] of something that could happen
[33:03] and i i and i just talking about the
[33:05] scientific aspect of it you know
[33:07] i think about they uh i've always
[33:10] interested i know it maybe and lord
[33:12] forgive me if it's a foolish thing to
[33:14] think about i've always found time
[33:15] travel
[33:17] interesting like because it's such a
[33:19] it's kind of uh i guess the way they'd
[33:21] say now it's a mind bender like if you
[33:23] were to do certain things it could
[33:24] change things and and obviously we don't
[33:26] necessarily believe that
[33:28] in the sense and i don't know what the
[33:29] lord would do any other way but they
[33:31] they have this thing in science i just
[33:33] using this in this illustration they
[33:34] call it the grandfather paradox where if
[33:37] you were to go back in time
[33:40] and and maybe like
[33:42] kill your grandfather somehow
[33:45] well then how could that happen because
[33:46] if you did that then you would never be
[33:48] born to be able to go back to do it
[33:50] so it's called a paradox it's a
[33:52] contradiction
[33:53] and so i i i as i read in in
[33:57] the book of philippians here
[34:00] how
[34:02] god it's god works in paradoxes
[34:05] he works in ways that seem to contradict
[34:07] themselves
[34:08] and not in the way that we would think
[34:10] that he would say one thing and do
[34:11] another
[34:12] but i say in paradox if i can say it's a
[34:15] paradox to our natural mind
[34:18] because the scripture says that the
[34:20] carnal mind is enmity with god
[34:22] the carnal mind cannot understand the
[34:24] things of god
[34:26] and and i find
[34:28] the as i meditate upon the word of god
[34:31] and think about the the situations that
[34:33] we're in in life and even in our
[34:35] churches and the and as we're coming to
[34:37] the coming of the lord i feel as though
[34:39] we've just gotten maybe a little too
[34:41] arnold
[34:42] in our thought processes
[34:44] and we're looking at things because
[34:46] scripture says let this mind be in you
[34:49] that was also in christ jesus
[34:52] but then it also goes in
[34:55] in the book of isaiah and he says but my
[34:57] thoughts are above your thoughts and my
[34:58] ways are past your ways
[35:00] so how can this mind be in you
[35:04] see because in one place
[35:06] i believe the lord's talking about our
[35:08] carnal thoughts in our carnal minds
[35:11] his thoughts and his and his holiness
[35:14] and and his purity and his perfection is
[35:17] so far beyond what our carnal mind can
[35:20] comprehend
[35:22] that the only way to get to that is to
[35:24] is to be baptized into that body
[35:26] yourself
[35:28] it's like
[35:30] it's like uh he said he said we saw
[35:32] through a glass darkly but now we see
[35:33] face to face see there was a time in
[35:36] your life before you received this life
[35:41] before you received this host where you
[35:43] looked upon the things of god and it was
[35:45] as it was one of those foggy glasses
[35:48] that that you could see something on the
[35:50] other side but you couldn't make it out
[35:52] it was blurry it didn't make any sense
[35:54] and it doesn't matter how hard you
[35:56] looked at it it wouldn't matter how how
[35:59] much you you you studied that that image
[36:02] in that class
[36:04] you would never be able to make out what
[36:05] was on the other side
[36:07] you would never be able to do it because
[36:10] there's a there's a barrier that was
[36:11] there
[36:12] there there was a sin barrier that that
[36:15] blocked us from being able to truly see
[36:18] the nature of god himself
[36:22] and no matter how much you'd look at it
[36:24] the the prophets in the old testament
[36:26] would try to write it
[36:28] and they wrote as much as as the natural
[36:32] could write down
[36:34] and talked about beasts with their wings
[36:36] and and having seven eyes and and eyes
[36:39] full of eyes round about and things that
[36:41] aren't carnal mind but if we try to
[36:43] conceive it carnally it makes no sense
[36:48] and that's our problem so many times
[36:51] it's where even as believers we're
[36:53] approaching him in a carnal manner and
[36:56] we don't even know it
[36:58] why because the question i have for you
[37:00] this evening is what are you expecting
[37:05] because what you receive
[37:07] is going to be based upon your
[37:09] expectation
[37:10] [Music]
[37:13] we understand that through the message
[37:14] that our prophet preached to us
[37:17] you are going to get what you expect
[37:22] this is why in the world that we're
[37:23] living in now
[37:24] the world is expecting strife on every
[37:27] hand
[37:28] they're exp their expectation
[37:31] is fear
[37:32] their expectation is for destruction
[37:36] and for nothing because that's exactly
[37:38] the anointing that's on them and they
[37:41] will get what they expect
[37:45] but you will get what you expect
[37:50] and the problem i find
[37:52] that's just been impressed upon my heart
[37:54] here recently
[37:56] is brothers and sisters and i don't mean
[37:58] this in a condemnation way i hope we
[38:00] take nothing that said it's condemnation
[38:02] but but maybe as a challenge to get us
[38:05] into a place we need to get we've got to
[38:08] come up higher amen uh uh
[38:11] the hour is too late
[38:15] for us to be playing games with god
[38:18] and to be stuck in a carnal conception
[38:22] of this message that we've received
[38:25] we have received a message from god in
[38:28] our hour
[38:30] brought to us by a vindicated prophet
[38:33] and we've and what we've done i fear
[38:37] is so much of what we've done is try to
[38:39] dissect it with carnal minds
[38:43] we've tried to figure it out we've
[38:46] approached the message
[38:48] in a scientific
[38:50] manner
[38:52] we want to break it down to the atoms
[38:55] and the molecules and what did he say
[38:57] here what did the prophet mean here what
[39:00] did these things mean there and you
[39:02] cannot get it carnally
[39:05] it's got to take the holy ghost
[39:09] supernatural things
[39:11] cannot be understood by the natural
[39:17] did not paul say that he said
[39:20] comparing spiritual and spiritual
[39:22] he said because the the things of god
[39:25] are spiritually discerned
[39:28] but the carnal man is comparing trying
[39:30] to compare them carnally
[39:33] trying to figure out god how are you
[39:35] going to do this oh god what is this
[39:37] going to be exactly what is that going
[39:40] to be exactly and if you approach god
[39:43] that way
[39:44] you'll miss it a mile
[39:47] because instead
[39:49] see god requires
[39:51] simplicity
[39:54] he hid it in simplicity
[39:58] when all the world
[40:00] knew that there was a work of god to
[40:02] come
[40:04] god sent a man named john the baptist
[40:09] come out of the wilderness
[40:11] no education
[40:14] wrapped in skins
[40:17] look like a wild man
[40:19] eating a diet that didn't look normal
[40:21] locust and wild honey
[40:24] and he was born
[40:26] into a family
[40:29] that he should have been well educated
[40:31] but he looked like a black sheep
[40:35] because god had a greater calling for
[40:37] him than just a priesthood
[40:41] and what happened
[40:43] the whole world
[40:45] the world that claimed to be spiritual
[40:47] the church world
[40:49] they knew something was on the horizon
[40:52] to come
[40:54] why because the pharisees
[40:57] the sadducees
[40:58] they were looking for something
[41:01] but what had they done
[41:03] they had formed a carnal interpretation
[41:08] a carnal expectation
[41:11] of what this messiah was to be
[41:15] they had had decided it was going to be
[41:17] this way
[41:19] that god
[41:20] would come in a mighty fashion
[41:22] with the trumpets of heaven sounding
[41:26] right not with a twenty thousand angel
[41:28] salute
[41:30] right
[41:32] but what was it
[41:33] did you know he did that
[41:39] he did it
[41:41] why because
[41:42] they came to shepherds by night one time
[41:46] see the world misses
[41:49] because they're looking for it to come
[41:51] carnally
[41:54] they think they're going to come to the
[41:56] mighty man that they call mighty
[41:58] but what god calls mighty
[42:00] man calls mighty god calls foolish
[42:04] when man calls wise god calls foolish
[42:07] when man comes strong god comes weak
[42:14] i'm coming to a place brothers and
[42:16] sisters
[42:17] i can't
[42:18] we cannot have any pride about us
[42:21] we all want to look like we got it all
[42:23] together
[42:24] we all want to look like we got a we got
[42:26] a full grasp on all this stuff and we
[42:29] just got everything under our thumb
[42:31] i'm going to tell you right now brothers
[42:33] and sisters i am not that way
[42:36] i fight battles
[42:38] i have my ups and i have my downs
[42:40] i have my backwardses and my forwardses
[42:42] and my turnings around and i have my
[42:44] frustrations and my sorrows but i also
[42:47] have my
[42:48] my eyes and won't become human
[42:53] and the problem is
[42:55] just like the world
[42:57] had a conception of what a prophet would
[43:00] be in our day and when a simple man from
[43:03] kentucky
[43:04] who people couldn't see could speak
[43:06] right
[43:06] seemed to say certain things that didn't
[43:08] make sense and didn't match what their
[43:11] idea their cartel mind in person
[43:14] their interpretation of a prophet would
[43:17] be
[43:18] they missed it a million miles
[43:20] just like they always do
[43:24] and if we're not careful we'll get swept
[43:26] into the same thing and not even know it
[43:28] right
[43:29] why you say why do you say that brother
[43:31] i i'll say exactly why i say it because
[43:34] and i am speaking to myself so if this
[43:35] doesn't apply to you well praise be to
[43:37] god
[43:38] but i can tell you right now too many
[43:40] times my my mind
[43:42] gets caught up
[43:44] in trying to understand the how
[43:48] and what exactly it's going to look like
[43:51] instead of just trusting
[43:52] that god said it
[43:54] it will happen
[43:56] and because he's called me to receive it
[43:58] i will be a beneficiary of it
[44:02] because they're all trying to figure it
[44:04] out
[44:05] the pharisees no doubt had their
[44:07] conventions
[44:08] the you see no doubt had the big they're
[44:11] big torah gatherings
[44:14] let us dissect brothers the the writings
[44:17] of the prophet isaiah
[44:19] and let us go through line by line by
[44:21] line and try to figure it out
[44:25] but what were they doing they were for
[44:27] and there's not even necessarily
[44:29] anything wrong with those things
[44:31] to to read the word of god to even talk
[44:34] to each other about it and discuss we
[44:36] should fellowship around the world
[44:39] i don't think there's any problem with
[44:41] asking questions and and maybe even
[44:43] pondering upon lord because we
[44:46] understand remember when jesus came on
[44:48] the scene there were two instances where
[44:52] god came and said this is how it's going
[44:55] to be
[44:56] when my when i am when my son is born
[45:00] one was to marry
[45:03] and the other one i can't remember the
[45:04] name now what was to the to the man uh
[45:07] elizabeth's husband i believe
[45:10] and i my mind fails me for the name
[45:13] but what happened
[45:15] god comes and says this is going to
[45:17] happen and
[45:18] and the man who ought to have known
[45:21] better
[45:22] he served god in the temple and all
[45:24] these things had an attitude about it
[45:27] and he wondered how is this going to be
[45:29] there's no way
[45:32] and lord said because you don't believe
[45:34] it
[45:35] you're going to be dumb for a season
[45:40] why that was whatever
[45:42] angel says now you're going to conceive
[45:44] and have a son and you'll name his name
[45:46] jesus
[45:48] and they and what did she she asked the
[45:50] same question
[45:51] she said how is that gonna happen
[45:54] but see she had a different attitude
[45:56] why because she expressed he said be it
[45:58] so unto me lord according to thy word
[46:01] why she may not have understood it
[46:04] and no doubt she would have loved to
[46:06] understand
[46:08] and maybe really be able to break it
[46:10] down
[46:11] but what was the difference she chose to
[46:13] believe it
[46:15] she there was something in here that
[46:16] said lord i don't know what it looks
[46:18] like it doesn't matter i i just but i
[46:20] believe your word
[46:22] and that's all i can stand on
[46:24] so is it with the believers of this day
[46:27] brothers and sisters i don't know
[46:29] how the rapture
[46:31] is going to change us in the moment of a
[46:33] twinkling of an eye
[46:35] but i do know that i've been called to
[46:36] receive it amen i do know that i've
[46:39] received an earnest of that inheritance
[46:42] that burns within me
[46:44] that can't help but say amen to the word
[46:47] of god amen
[46:49] and lord help me but i don't want to get
[46:52] to a place where where i'm stuck trying
[46:55] to think about it and understand figure
[46:57] it out carnally
[47:00] because you won't do it
[47:02] you can't do it
[47:04] you will run yourself in circles you run
[47:06] yourself onto all kinds of doctrines
[47:08] you'll you'll be looking over here and
[47:11] god will be working over there
[47:15] why
[47:16] because they're people they're in
[47:17] expectation but what are you expecting
[47:22] have you formed in your mind
[47:24] without even knowing it is there and you
[47:27] formed in your mind like lord
[47:29] it's got to be this way
[47:31] i just don't i don't see how it could be
[47:33] any other way and many times without
[47:35] even knowing it we get caught into that
[47:37] because what just something as simple as
[47:39] healing
[47:41] how many times have you gone to the lord
[47:44] and said lord i believe you've healed me
[47:46] i i believe it because your word says by
[47:48] his stripes we were healed
[47:51] it's finished it's a finished work
[47:54] and then the lord may come along with
[47:55] the medicine but because you were
[47:57] expecting a miracle you didn't take the
[47:59] medicine
[48:03] why because you formed in your mind a
[48:05] carnal expectation and you boxed in
[48:09] deciding for god how he was going to
[48:11] perform his word
[48:14] god will perform his word the way he
[48:16] chooses to perform his word
[48:18] it's not subject to our whims and our
[48:21] wishes
[48:23] the lord doesn't come the way you watch
[48:26] him and always in the time you want him
[48:28] what does the song say he may not come
[48:29] when you want him but he'll be there
[48:31] right on time why because he's never out
[48:34] of cater
[48:36] he's never off time
[48:39] it's just that we don't get into his
[48:41] time
[48:43] we wonder lord why is this happening to
[48:46] me lord why is this situation the way it
[48:48] is lord why aren't why haven't i been
[48:50] healed of this yet or why isn't this
[48:52] deliverance specific there's nothing
[48:55] wrong with the word of god
[48:57] your deliverance is paid for your
[48:59] healing is paid for your salvation is
[49:02] paid for the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:04] is yours to receive he the prophet said
[49:06] god wants to heal you more than you want
[49:08] to be healed he wants to feel you more
[49:10] than you want to be filled so if you're
[49:12] not filled if you're not healed if
[49:14] you're not delivered who's whose fault
[49:17] is it
[49:19] it's not god's
[49:21] because when he was on the cross he said
[49:23] it is finished
[49:26] and he doesn't lie
[49:28] the words the scripture says the works
[49:30] were finished before the foundation of
[49:32] the world
[49:35] so it's about time we realize that the
[49:38] problem always lies here
[49:43] we've got to get out of our mind and get
[49:46] into his
[49:48] we have to
[49:49] there's no other way to do it
[49:52] that's why the pharisees missed it
[49:54] because they had a carnal conception
[49:56] of how the messiah was to come
[49:59] isn't that what the prophet said he said
[50:01] they said surely he'd have to come from
[50:03] our schools
[50:04] he'd have to come through our
[50:06] organization
[50:07] he'd have to come through our line of
[50:08] thinking and he came to a stable
[50:13] near a pile of manure
[50:16] no place to lay his head
[50:19] a bad name to the natural
[50:21] because they thought he was illegitimate
[50:24] that's the god of heaven
[50:27] revealed in flesh
[50:29] so as it was then so will it be now
[50:33] because god does not change his ways
[50:39] the rest of the world may look at you as
[50:41] illegitimate they may look at you like
[50:43] you're a dung pile
[50:44] they may look at you like you have
[50:46] nothing but if you got the seed of god
[50:48] in you
[50:49] if you've been baptized with the spirit
[50:51] of god and you've been received into
[50:52] that family remember that glass that you
[50:55] can't see through the only way to see
[50:57] what's on the other side is to come
[50:58] inside brothers and sisters is to be
[51:01] born into that spirit forward into that
[51:03] body have that life
[51:06] because the carnal mind cannot receive
[51:08] it
[51:09] it will not receive it
[51:16] we've got to get out of our ideas
[51:18] god doesn't want your ideas
[51:22] well what did brother branham say about
[51:23] he always talked about
[51:25] about god being god he said he said god
[51:28] has to do it right the first time or he
[51:30] wasn't god
[51:32] if he could change his mind because he
[51:34] said he had a better idea that means his
[51:36] first idea wasn't good enough that means
[51:38] he's not god
[51:40] so why do we
[51:41] always try to change god's mind
[51:44] about what he wants
[51:47] because of our carnal desires because
[51:50] we're
[51:51] like so many times when we are to be
[51:52] maturing
[51:54] when we are to be mature christians
[51:57] able to uh able to take no for an answer
[52:02] what's that uh sister kristen i'm sure
[52:04] can attest what's one of the first
[52:06] things when that child does not like to
[52:08] learn how to take response to no
[52:12] because when they're a baby
[52:15] they don't you the parent knows they
[52:17] don't know any better
[52:18] they have no other choice but to cry for
[52:21] what they desire
[52:22] and then what does mama do mama gives
[52:24] them what they need all the time
[52:26] that's why they call it babying
[52:30] you ever heard of i'm being babied
[52:32] that means you're getting whatever you
[52:33] want
[52:34] that means you throw a fit and you get a
[52:36] pacifier you get a bottle of milk you
[52:39] get a pat on the bum
[52:41] you know you get whatever you need
[52:43] you get pampered you get rocked to sleep
[52:46] and as as babes in christ that's how god
[52:49] does it so many times
[52:52] how many remember
[52:55] and this is just fresh to me and if it
[52:57] doesn't make sense i pray brother jesse
[52:59] forgive me and you don't have to have me
[53:00] back brother
[53:02] but i how many remember i i feel like
[53:05] because i feel like i always
[53:07] and maybe this is just the way the lord
[53:09] showed it to me right now but it seems
[53:11] like when you first come to christ
[53:13] there's so many miraculous things
[53:15] that'll happen it seems like in that
[53:17] first period it's fresh your faith is
[53:19] high what is it god's taking that
[53:21] newborn babe and he's babying you
[53:24] he's given you all the things that you
[53:27] need to grow strong he's giving you that
[53:29] sincere milk of the word
[53:31] he when you're crying he's right there
[53:33] to answer right away why because you're
[53:34] a babe
[53:36] because he knows he needs but what did
[53:37] brother braham say there's comes a point
[53:39] where we can't be hot house plants
[53:41] anymore
[53:43] it's time to mature
[53:45] when you pray and god says no like he
[53:48] did to paul
[53:49] you say you don't throw a fit and say
[53:51] lord you said i was healed
[53:54] paul knew
[53:55] that by his strengths he was healed
[53:58] did he try to throw the word back in
[53:59] god's face
[54:01] when god said my grace is sufficient for
[54:03] me for my strength is made perfect in
[54:04] weakness
[54:05] no he said rather i will rejoice in my
[54:09] infirmities that the power of god may
[54:11] rest upon me
[54:13] oh that's a mature christian brothers
[54:15] and sisters
[54:17] when your father can look at you after
[54:19] you begged him for something he says no
[54:22] and you say even so lord be it unto me
[54:24] according to thy word
[54:26] did not jesus do the same thing in the
[54:29] garden of gethsemane lord i would that
[54:31] this cup passed from me
[54:34] you know why we didn't have to hear his
[54:36] answer because jesus already knew the
[54:37] answer was no
[54:39] because he was the word
[54:41] so he didn't have to wait
[54:43] for god to come back and say no because
[54:44] he knew the answer was no so he says
[54:48] nevertheless
[54:50] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[54:53] done oh that's a mature christian
[54:58] that is what we're coming to brothers
[54:59] and sisters i don't care you may not
[55:01] think it right now that's coming
[55:05] paul said endure hardness
[55:08] that's hard living
[55:09] hard situations hard circumstances
[55:12] endure hardness as a good soldier
[55:15] those soldiers when they're out there
[55:17] fighting the battles
[55:18] eight eight it ain't beds of feather
[55:20] beds
[55:22] and comfy pillows and good meals
[55:25] no sir they're laying on the rocks just
[55:27] like just like i think it was uh jacob
[55:30] he had a stone for a pillow
[55:35] blankets maybe a sheepskin or something
[55:38] whenever you can find them
[55:40] but they're soldiers
[55:42] they're pressing on they're fighting
[55:44] battles
[55:46] we can't live in a carnal expectation
[55:50] why because that's a layout to see in
[55:52] spirit
[55:54] it's a layout to see in spirit
[55:56] our right to everything
[55:59] don't you see the spirit of laodicea now
[56:02] i don't know about you but i can see it
[56:04] creeping through the churches too
[56:05] message churches
[56:07] people get that spirit on them what did
[56:09] brother branham say that laocia stood
[56:11] for people's rights
[56:13] and what are we living in now well i
[56:15] have a right to this i have a right to
[56:16] that i have a right to this this is mine
[56:20] that's mine
[56:22] i don't own anything i don't have
[56:24] nothing why because i gave up my rights
[56:27] i gave everything that i was to him
[56:29] i want to give all that i am to him i
[56:31] don't want my own thoughts i don't want
[56:33] my own desires i lived for myself for 18
[56:37] years
[56:38] before and i tried to serve the lord a
[56:40] little bit in denomination and the lord
[56:42] helped me at least to know a little bit
[56:44] about god
[56:46] i praise the lord that i grew up with
[56:47] that knowledge
[56:49] you know he saved me from a lot of
[56:50] things
[56:52] but it was 18 years plus living for
[56:55] myself
[56:57] i can tell you one thing it's true
[56:59] not one of my decisions
[57:02] benefited me in any eternal way
[57:07] all of my thinking that i had i could do
[57:09] this and i can do that and i want this
[57:11] and i want that did nothing but bring
[57:14] sorrow
[57:15] pain frustration
[57:17] and it'll do the same to you
[57:19] even now if we try to we think see we
[57:22] take things carnally because our prophet
[57:24] told us when you get saved god gives you
[57:26] a checkbook signed with jesus christ's
[57:28] name on it whatever you have need of
[57:31] but see people forget that brother
[57:33] branham also came back and said when you
[57:35] need something from god you got to have
[57:36] the right motive you got to have the
[57:38] right objective it's got to be the right
[57:40] place it's got to be the right time it's
[57:43] got to be the right move
[57:46] but we ignore that part of it and we say
[57:48] give it to me now
[57:50] i want this i want that
[57:53] spoiled children
[57:57] sounds more like grandchildren
[57:59] right because that's what they do what
[58:01] isn't that what when you're a child when
[58:03] i was a child that's what you go to your
[58:04] grandparents for your grandparents
[58:06] weren't there for discipline your
[58:08] grandparents weren't there for anything
[58:10] else but to give you candy and give your
[58:12] toys and your birthdays and stuff
[58:15] why because that's the grandparent
[58:17] mentality but god doesn't have
[58:19] grandchildren
[58:21] he's only got sons and daughters
[58:23] and unfortunately if you want to look at
[58:25] it like this the parents part of the
[58:27] responsibility is to chastise is to keep
[58:30] those children in line is to make sure
[58:33] they're on the right path
[58:36] it's to school them
[58:38] is to teach them
[58:40] now some of you
[58:41] children
[58:43] may not be like me and maybe you love
[58:45] school
[58:46] i didn't like school
[58:48] it wasn't pleasurable to me
[58:50] some people enjoy it praise the lord
[58:53] that's a gift
[58:55] that's a gift to enjoy it
[58:57] you know i believe that
[58:59] but just like the scripture says the the
[59:01] chastisement all these things are not
[59:03] pleasurable in the season but it
[59:05] bringeth forth fruits
[59:08] you train up a child and the way it
[59:09] should go and when they are old they
[59:11] won't depart from it it doesn't mean
[59:12] you're not going to have trials and
[59:14] tribulations it doesn't mean you're not
[59:15] going to have sorrows and troubles and
[59:17] and things you're going to go through
[59:19] but it does mean that if you follow that
[59:21] word god will be there at the end to
[59:24] greet you
[59:28] we've got to get out of our own carnal
[59:30] ideas of things
[59:34] we've got to
[59:35] come up higher into his mind
[59:40] how many times
[59:42] you know
[59:43] the pharisees were in that mode right we
[59:45] were just talking about that
[59:47] they had this idea of how god would come
[59:48] when he came on the scene and then they
[59:50] totally missed him by a million miles
[59:52] but there was a little woman at the well
[59:55] you see she wasn't educated
[59:58] she wasn't educated enough to have all
[1:00:00] of her own theories
[1:00:02] to have all of her own ideas
[1:00:04] to have all of her own assumptions
[1:00:06] of how the messiah would come
[1:00:09] so
[1:00:10] unlike the pharisee who was up there
[1:00:12] just completely sure of the way he
[1:00:14] thought because he was so educated
[1:00:17] he was so sure of himself
[1:00:19] well surely god would have to come this
[1:00:21] way because of this and this and he
[1:00:23] could just name it and name it a
[1:00:24] neighbor to name it
[1:00:25] but see that little woman at the well
[1:00:28] see she knew enough to know that she
[1:00:29] didn't know
[1:00:31] i i was like i was i always made a
[1:00:33] little saying to myself i said a smart
[1:00:35] person knows enough to know that they
[1:00:37] don't know enough
[1:00:38] yes
[1:00:40] and as christians i believe we ought to
[1:00:42] be we ought to be so humble
[1:00:45] we need to humble our we've been given
[1:00:47] such great revelation
[1:00:49] we've been given such great things in
[1:00:50] this hour
[1:00:51] but we've got to be careful even paul he
[1:00:54] said he said les by the abundance of
[1:00:56] revelations i'd be puffed up
[1:00:59] and then what happens
[1:01:01] that is where a denominational mindset
[1:01:03] starts to come in
[1:01:05] you start to think well except god come
[1:01:07] this way because this is the way i
[1:01:09] understand it
[1:01:10] then it can't be any other way than this
[1:01:13] that's where the pharisees and sadducees
[1:01:14] went off that's where the denominations
[1:01:16] went off
[1:01:17] and that's where a lot of people now are
[1:01:19] starting to drift off because they say
[1:01:21] well surely it's got to be this way
[1:01:23] surely
[1:01:24] this and this has got to happen because
[1:01:26] of this thing and this thing and they
[1:01:27] start trying to put it together brother
[1:01:29] i know enough to know that i don't know
[1:01:32] i don't know how it will happen
[1:01:35] but i want to be like that woman at the
[1:01:36] well
[1:01:37] the only thing she knew
[1:01:39] what did she tell what did she tell the
[1:01:41] lord jesus he said we know
[1:01:43] what was the thing that she knew she
[1:01:44] said when messiah cometh he'll be able
[1:01:45] to do these things
[1:01:46] that's all i know
[1:01:49] that's all i know
[1:01:50] is that when messiah cometh
[1:01:53] he'll do these things
[1:01:54] and you know what that was a heart that
[1:01:56] jesus could speak to
[1:01:58] not that pharisee
[1:01:59] he could perform the same miracles
[1:02:04] why because the scripture said he talked
[1:02:05] to those pharisees and he said he'd
[1:02:07] perceive their minds he could perceive
[1:02:09] the thoughts of their heart and he would
[1:02:11] speak right to the heart of the issue
[1:02:14] and it'd go right over them
[1:02:16] but to that little woman at the well who
[1:02:19] had a seat in there
[1:02:21] who had no expectation
[1:02:24] she didn't have a plan worked out in her
[1:02:27] mind of how the messiah was going to
[1:02:29] come
[1:02:30] she could only say what the word said
[1:02:33] she said i don't know i just know sir i
[1:02:36] perceive you're a prophet
[1:02:38] i i kind of know that because you're
[1:02:40] telling me things
[1:02:41] that you should know that you know
[1:02:44] he said well i do know
[1:02:46] that when the messiah comes he'll do
[1:02:48] these things too
[1:02:49] i don't know anything else
[1:02:51] i don't have the knowledge
[1:02:53] that these great men have
[1:02:55] i don't have the name
[1:02:56] that these great men have
[1:02:58] i have a bad name
[1:03:00] i look bad to the world
[1:03:02] but but there's something in here that
[1:03:04] was greater
[1:03:06] than all the educational pharisees
[1:03:09] then all their theories and theological
[1:03:11] ideas and discussions
[1:03:13] it was a simple
[1:03:15] she had an expectation too
[1:03:17] but she was just expecting god to move
[1:03:21] she didn't try to cage it up into her
[1:03:23] own carnal
[1:03:24] ideas
[1:03:25] she didn't try to cage it up and try to
[1:03:28] try to move put god almost like in a
[1:03:30] many times it's almost like mentally in
[1:03:32] our the way we are expecting we try to
[1:03:34] put god almost like in a rat maze
[1:03:37] all we care we we we we know the cheese
[1:03:40] is over here and so we're going to force
[1:03:42] god to get to the cheese in the way that
[1:03:45] we think he ought to go
[1:03:47] not so
[1:03:48] god god is sovereign
[1:03:50] the only thing he doesn't do is he
[1:03:52] doesn't work outside his word
[1:03:56] and if we'd stop trying to box them into
[1:03:58] our our solutions our ideas our
[1:04:01] mentalities because that just gets you
[1:04:03] into trouble
[1:04:05] it won't do anything it got even into
[1:04:06] trouble
[1:04:09] it got even in trouble brother branham
[1:04:10] said i believe it was in satan's eden
[1:04:13] he said he said what did eve do eve
[1:04:15] lusted for knowledge
[1:04:17] she wanted to know things
[1:04:20] i fear
[1:04:21] that in in our in many times because of
[1:04:25] the age we live in the scientific age
[1:04:27] that we're in
[1:04:28] many times we get we can get sucked into
[1:04:30] that lord i just want to know this and i
[1:04:32] want to know that and i want to and
[1:04:34] don't get me wrong god wants to give us
[1:04:36] understanding
[1:04:37] he wants us to to have knowledge of him
[1:04:39] and knowledge of his word
[1:04:41] but why are we seeking these things are
[1:04:43] we doing it just so we could know more
[1:04:44] than this other brother
[1:04:46] are we doing it just so we could prove a
[1:04:48] point to someone else
[1:04:49] to oh i got him there they thought it
[1:04:51] was this way but oh i got it because i
[1:04:53] showed him it was that way that's not
[1:04:55] the spirit of god
[1:04:57] that's the kind of thing that breaks up
[1:04:58] fellowship
[1:05:00] because people want to go you'd see the
[1:05:01] way brother branham would humble himself
[1:05:04] down when people would talk bad about
[1:05:06] him
[1:05:07] people would talk behind his back he
[1:05:09] knew what they were talking about him
[1:05:11] but what did he do he humbled himself
[1:05:13] jesus the very god of heaven let this
[1:05:16] mind be in you that was also in christ
[1:05:17] jesus he said who who being in the who
[1:05:20] being in the likeness he didn't think it
[1:05:22] even robber to be equal with god but
[1:05:25] what did he do
[1:05:26] he humbled himself
[1:05:28] he came in the form of a servant
[1:05:31] that's why they couldn't see it
[1:05:33] because god defied
[1:05:35] all their carnal expectations
[1:05:39] he's going to do it again
[1:05:41] he's doing it right now
[1:05:44] he's doing it right now and i'm not
[1:05:45] saying this just to puff up brother
[1:05:46] jesse or even the church in general here
[1:05:49] but he's doing it in this congregation
[1:05:51] now
[1:05:52] why because the rest of the world would
[1:05:54] look at a little congregation like this
[1:05:56] they'd say it's not much
[1:05:58] but to god it's the apple of his eye
[1:06:01] to god it's more precious than gold to
[1:06:04] god it is eternal life right here right
[1:06:08] now why because it's not about numbers
[1:06:11] it's not about how much people can shout
[1:06:13] at how much noise you can make by your
[1:06:15] song services
[1:06:17] god wants quality not quantity
[1:06:21] and what will anybody tell you about any
[1:06:23] process that distills something down to
[1:06:25] its purest form as it gets smaller and
[1:06:28] smaller and smaller and smaller as it
[1:06:31] goes
[1:06:34] so don't be discouraged when you say oh
[1:06:36] why aren't we growing why aren't there
[1:06:38] so many more people in here why do
[1:06:40] people seem to go away and not come in
[1:06:42] because the hour's late
[1:06:45] hour's late
[1:06:47] there's not much left
[1:06:49] there's nothing that brother branham
[1:06:51] back then called him cannon fodder
[1:06:53] how much more now
[1:06:56] but we're seeking out those seeds
[1:06:59] we get one here
[1:07:00] we get one there
[1:07:02] the lord encourages his people who has
[1:07:04] despised the day of small things
[1:07:08] who has despised that and again i don't
[1:07:10] even say this to to uplift just a church
[1:07:13] this is just for you in general too to
[1:07:15] you specifically you think you're small
[1:07:17] and insignificant
[1:07:19] you think that you don't mean anything
[1:07:20] because of this reason or that oh i'm
[1:07:23] not i'm not this i'm not a preacher i'm
[1:07:25] not a great teacher
[1:07:26] i can't sing or i can't speak really
[1:07:29] well or i'm not really
[1:07:31] the most personable person who could
[1:07:32] just go out there and talk to people
[1:07:34] that means nothing
[1:07:36] the the value that you hold is deeper
[1:07:39] than that brothers and sisters
[1:07:41] the value you hold is a seed that was
[1:07:44] planted in you before the foundation of
[1:07:46] the world that cries out i have a father
[1:07:48] to that word of god
[1:07:51] more valuable than ten thousand worlds
[1:07:55] and satan would try to try to make us
[1:07:57] the scripture said that they they would
[1:07:59] we would compare ourselves by ourselves
[1:08:01] but it's foolishness
[1:08:04] why because
[1:08:06] you can compare yourself brother amen
[1:08:08] would say maybe he's a song leader so he
[1:08:10] may go to another church and the devil
[1:08:11] would try to put something on him well
[1:08:13] you're not like that song leader yeah
[1:08:15] but that song leader wouldn't be able to
[1:08:17] exist here because that's not their
[1:08:18] position
[1:08:20] but a brother amen's position is to be
[1:08:22] here
[1:08:23] why and nobody else can fill that spot
[1:08:25] just like that temple
[1:08:27] they were hewn stones
[1:08:29] lively stones that are being carved and
[1:08:32] chiseled out and placed into their
[1:08:33] position and there's no other stone that
[1:08:35] could take that place
[1:08:38] so if you think the devil tries to make
[1:08:40] you feel insignificant make you feel not
[1:08:42] valuable
[1:08:43] there is nobody that can take your place
[1:08:46] there is nobody who possesses the value
[1:08:49] to the body of bride of christ
[1:08:51] fellowship or even to the bride as a
[1:08:53] whole there's nobody that possesses that
[1:08:55] besides you
[1:08:57] why because
[1:08:58] god paid the same price for you
[1:09:01] that he prayed for william branham
[1:09:04] he paid the same price for you that he
[1:09:06] prayed for brother jesse
[1:09:08] that he paid for martin luther and all
[1:09:10] these things that we would call great
[1:09:12] men
[1:09:13] and you know what they were they were
[1:09:14] tools in the hand of god to fit their
[1:09:17] position just like you are
[1:09:20] oh god i wish i could be this and i wish
[1:09:22] i could be that and i wish i could see
[1:09:24] this
[1:09:26] check your motives check your objectives
[1:09:29] and then check your mind
[1:09:31] and put it in line with the word of god
[1:09:34] because god doesn't want to work by your
[1:09:36] carnal expectations what are you
[1:09:38] expecting
[1:09:40] see are we and the thing that really if
[1:09:42] i could say i don't want to hold i don't
[1:09:43] even know what time it is
[1:09:45] i don't want to hold us too long but the
[1:09:48] thing that really if i could say this
[1:09:50] that got me really thinking along this
[1:09:51] line is i started thinking about this
[1:09:53] rapture
[1:09:55] and this rapture whether you realize it
[1:09:56] or not is happening right now
[1:09:59] your faith
[1:10:00] when you receive this word right now as
[1:10:02] it's being spoken has nothing to do with
[1:10:04] me
[1:10:04] why because i can't do anything for you
[1:10:06] i would love to do it for you but i
[1:10:08] can't
[1:10:10] it just happens to be that it's my lot
[1:10:13] to be by his grace if he would allow it
[1:10:15] a vessel that he could speak through if
[1:10:17] i could if i could find the grace in his
[1:10:19] sight to get myself out of the way
[1:10:20] because you don't want to hear me speak
[1:10:22] it would do you no good to hear me speak
[1:10:25] because i do not have the words of life
[1:10:28] he alone has the words of life
[1:10:32] if we can look beyond this veil look
[1:10:33] beyond brother randy whoever's up your
[1:10:35] brother jesse whoever it might be and
[1:10:37] realize that it's god if it be this word
[1:10:40] now yeah now it doesn't cope with the
[1:10:42] word then you better check it but if it
[1:10:44] be this word then it's god to you
[1:10:47] it's god speaking to you
[1:10:50] right and what is that that is nothing
[1:10:52] but the master's hammer
[1:10:53] right now you don't feel it because
[1:10:55] feelings don't matter
[1:10:57] you may not see it because sight doesn't
[1:10:59] matter i had this thought that really
[1:11:00] struck me i was watching a video
[1:11:03] uh
[1:11:04] my wife is really into plants right now
[1:11:06] she's just she wants to be the greenest
[1:11:08] thumb and our house is slowly turning
[1:11:09] into a jungle
[1:11:11] and
[1:11:12] i i saw but the thing that kind of got
[1:11:14] me is i saw this video and you know how
[1:11:16] they do the time lapses of a of a seed
[1:11:18] and then they'll grow up
[1:11:21] you realize that when you see that and
[1:11:23] it looks so fast it's like oh ah that's
[1:11:25] amazing that took
[1:11:27] six
[1:11:28] eight
[1:11:29] ten
[1:11:30] twelve months to happen
[1:11:33] if you sat there and stared at that
[1:11:35] you'd go dead with boredom
[1:11:37] to see it grow
[1:11:39] and that's the problem that satan gets
[1:11:41] us with is
[1:11:42] right now you are growing
[1:11:45] why because what did we do we came in
[1:11:48] we opened our hearts to the word when we
[1:11:50] even sing the song we open our hearts to
[1:11:52] him to the word and now the word of god
[1:11:55] the washing of the water of the word
[1:11:57] what is it it's just like the the you i
[1:11:59] had this now maybe you may have all had
[1:12:02] this this revelation before i did
[1:12:04] but i had a to me i was a mighty
[1:12:06] revelation i thought oh my goodness this
[1:12:07] is so good because we're typed as trees
[1:12:10] and plants in the garden of god right
[1:12:13] well there's a reason why
[1:12:15] that the man the one who tends the
[1:12:17] plants is called a husband men
[1:12:20] and he is our husband even according to
[1:12:23] the spiritual it never struck me before
[1:12:25] quite like that but i just i rejoiced in
[1:12:27] that i said my even the lord even uses
[1:12:30] language to glorify himself
[1:12:32] i love it
[1:12:33] like even in the language it's a
[1:12:35] revelation
[1:12:36] how he's a husband the husbandman broods
[1:12:39] over the
[1:12:40] the flowers in the garden and and grooms
[1:12:43] them and waters them and feeds so does
[1:12:45] our husband
[1:12:47] right now if you can accept it he's he's
[1:12:50] feeding you
[1:12:51] spiritual vitamins into your soil
[1:12:54] he's sprinkling you with with the water
[1:12:57] the washing of the water of the word to
[1:12:59] soak that soil so he could break up the
[1:13:01] fallow ground
[1:13:03] so you can grow yeah you may not see it
[1:13:05] right away just like the plant
[1:13:07] that plant may grow a tenth of a
[1:13:09] millimeter a day
[1:13:11] but who has despised the day of small
[1:13:13] things i'm really that scripture's just
[1:13:15] been speaking to me because
[1:13:17] it's it's the little things
[1:13:20] god will take care of the big things
[1:13:23] but it's the little foxes that spoil the
[1:13:25] vine
[1:13:26] it's the little omissions and
[1:13:28] commissions that we make every day
[1:13:30] it's the little things when god speaks
[1:13:32] to your heart say hey
[1:13:34] you know instead of
[1:13:35] going to this place today maybe you just
[1:13:37] take it take ten minutes and just get in
[1:13:39] prayer for five ten minutes and your
[1:13:41] carnal mind is well what's five minutes
[1:13:43] gonna do it's not even about the time
[1:13:45] it's about the obedience
[1:13:48] god is looking for for sons and
[1:13:51] daughters who at the very least of his
[1:13:54] will is their greatest desire to fulfill
[1:13:57] that's the character he's looking for
[1:13:59] because jesus came and what did he say
[1:14:01] he said i do nothing except the father
[1:14:03] shows me first that's the character he's
[1:14:05] looking for we look at it and say oh
[1:14:07] lord that couldn't have been you because
[1:14:09] it was so little
[1:14:10] it's because it was so little that it
[1:14:12] was him
[1:14:14] because what did brother branham say he
[1:14:16] said god's so great because he became so
[1:14:19] long
[1:14:20] but see what our current expectations
[1:14:23] we've almost turned in carnal minds
[1:14:26] we've almost come pharisees in some ways
[1:14:29] see
[1:14:30] brother i
[1:14:31] brother jesse i had this thought this is
[1:14:33] what just really kind of spurred on this
[1:14:35] whole this whole thought process here
[1:14:40] you think about this rapture
[1:14:42] and brother jesse you know you know
[1:14:44] we've all had fellowship around it and
[1:14:46] things we've talked about oh you know
[1:14:47] because brother branham said it and i
[1:14:48] believe it
[1:14:50] he said you know missing limbs would be
[1:14:51] restored
[1:14:53] creative power would happen
[1:14:55] and all these things and and you know
[1:14:56] what happens your carnal mind starts to
[1:14:58] get rolling
[1:15:00] and you've already created in your mind
[1:15:03] a a movie or if you could say a little a
[1:15:06] little mental film
[1:15:07] of what that what we call it a squeeze
[1:15:09] or what that time right before the
[1:15:11] rapture is going to be like we're going
[1:15:12] to be walking speaking things into
[1:15:14] existence and things are going to be
[1:15:15] poof in here and clouds of smoke over
[1:15:18] there god never said that
[1:15:21] you know what actually he said he said
[1:15:22] he said the tent vision he said this
[1:15:24] will be the third poll he said and no
[1:15:25] one will know anything about it
[1:15:28] brother branham said it would be so
[1:15:30] humble
[1:15:31] that it'll come and go and you didn't
[1:15:33] even know what happened
[1:15:35] just like john the baptist
[1:15:36] why said the scripture that elisha
[1:15:39] elijah would come he said he already
[1:15:40] came and he didn't even know him
[1:15:43] so humble
[1:15:45] so small
[1:15:46] so little
[1:15:49] the rapture brothers and sisters it's
[1:15:51] happening right now
[1:15:55] and i'm i'm i fear in some ways that so
[1:15:58] many of us maybe not even here but i
[1:16:00] feel all over and i say this just in
[1:16:02] general we're missing it because we fall
[1:16:04] into the trap brother branham warned us
[1:16:06] about he said you always remember what
[1:16:08] god did
[1:16:09] we rejoice in the things that god did
[1:16:10] through brother branham
[1:16:12] we're looking forward to what he will do
[1:16:13] all that latter rain oh those great and
[1:16:16] powerful manifestations that are going
[1:16:18] to happen and we're ignoring what he's
[1:16:20] doing right now
[1:16:22] god is revealing his word little by
[1:16:24] little every day
[1:16:26] he's he's perfecting you little by
[1:16:28] little every day if you really thought
[1:16:30] about it maybe sit before the lord and
[1:16:33] start to think and meditate and say lord
[1:16:35] reveal to me how you've changed me
[1:16:38] because those changes many times happen
[1:16:40] so little you know if we didn't have
[1:16:43] if we didn't have photographs
[1:16:45] when you were children you wouldn't even
[1:16:47] remember what you looked like when you
[1:16:48] were a child
[1:16:49] you wouldn't even remember it why
[1:16:51] because you don't have a reference
[1:16:53] and that's how that's one of the
[1:16:54] greatest tricks the devil does to us is
[1:16:56] because many our memories i preached on
[1:16:59] that last time i was here about those
[1:17:00] five inlets the memory and conscious
[1:17:02] affection reason and we talked about
[1:17:03] those and clearing those channels out
[1:17:05] right and what does it do satan will use
[1:17:07] those memories and all of a sudden the
[1:17:09] only things we see it's almost like a
[1:17:11] photograph right
[1:17:13] what are they having a photograph a
[1:17:14] negative we look back and all we see is
[1:17:16] the negative
[1:17:17] we don't see that developed picture we
[1:17:19] don't see what god was doing and how far
[1:17:22] we've come
[1:17:24] think about the things that you used to
[1:17:26] allow in your life
[1:17:28] that now all of a sudden you said
[1:17:30] lord i can't do that anymore
[1:17:32] maybe maybe you felt pretty confident in
[1:17:34] it at one time
[1:17:36] and for that season it was okay but now
[1:17:37] the lord said now it's time to come up a
[1:17:39] little higher
[1:17:40] there's a there's a little more holiness
[1:17:41] i've got for you there's a there's a
[1:17:43] little bit deeper of a walk that i want
[1:17:45] to have but i can't have it while you're
[1:17:46] down there you need to come up a little
[1:17:48] higher you have to remove this out of
[1:17:49] your life
[1:17:50] that you once allowed and you thought it
[1:17:52] was okay and may have been lawful but
[1:17:54] the lord says but it's not expedient
[1:17:57] it's not something you can keep doing
[1:17:59] and you say oh why why why do i feel
[1:18:01] that way that's god working on you
[1:18:04] and you don't even know it because god
[1:18:06] or the god is working so slowly
[1:18:10] he's taken that fine sandpaper and just
[1:18:12] rubbing off these little sharp edges
[1:18:14] that you used to have
[1:18:16] you know when you first become a
[1:18:17] christian god takes the hammer to you
[1:18:19] and he's knocking off
[1:18:21] you know sitting off sin after sin he's
[1:18:24] knocking off smoking he's knocking off
[1:18:26] drinking he's knocking off all these
[1:18:28] things that you used to enjoy and
[1:18:29] they're really big and it's easy to see
[1:18:32] but then the master starts to go in and
[1:18:34] fine-tune the details
[1:18:36] and you know what about it is
[1:18:38] it takes a long time
[1:18:40] it takes a lot of work
[1:18:42] it takes it takes a lot of rubbing on
[1:18:44] one another there's a lot of rubbing
[1:18:46] going on he's pulling out the sandpaper
[1:18:48] and what if you ever seen him do that
[1:18:50] there's a lot of water involved a lot of
[1:18:52] that word's got to come in there to
[1:18:54] provide that grit for that sandpaper to
[1:18:56] get in there to smooth it out
[1:18:58] but he's doing it little by little by
[1:19:00] little
[1:19:01] but the thing i i got off track again
[1:19:03] but
[1:19:04] i wanted to focus on this and when it
[1:19:06] will close
[1:19:07] the thing that really struck me on this
[1:19:08] was we start to think about this rapture
[1:19:10] and it's this great event and this great
[1:19:11] event in this great event but i've just
[1:19:13] it's been in my mind so much that god
[1:19:15] works in simplicity
[1:19:17] and it's always the opposite
[1:19:20] of what the carnal mind is expecting
[1:19:23] the scripture says
[1:19:26] and we don't we don't have to turn there
[1:19:27] but you can you can write it down and
[1:19:28] read it later isaiah chapter 40 talks
[1:19:30] about john the baptist
[1:19:33] and it says they said it the valleys
[1:19:35] would be exalted
[1:19:37] the mountains would be made low
[1:19:39] the the the rough places would become
[1:19:42] smooth and he'd the crooked places be
[1:19:44] made straight
[1:19:46] and that was john the baptist
[1:19:48] a man
[1:19:49] who didn't have nothing but a fuel
[1:19:50] handful of converts
[1:19:54] and then here we are
[1:19:56] and then jesus had to come and tell them
[1:19:57] about it
[1:19:58] why does the scripture say this and why
[1:20:01] do they say elijah has to come he
[1:20:02] already came and he didn't even know it
[1:20:05] see we're thinking then the carnal mind
[1:20:07] no doubt those pharisees and said she's
[1:20:08] read those scriptures all the time
[1:20:11] they said oh my
[1:20:12] this is going to be a great thing and it
[1:20:14] was a great thing it just wasn't a great
[1:20:16] thing in the way they thought it would
[1:20:18] be
[1:20:18] they said oh sure you know no doubt they
[1:20:21] had their theories just like we theorize
[1:20:24] you know we have our theories we see
[1:20:26] things happening in the world and we try
[1:20:27] to match it to the word and and i don't
[1:20:29] doubt that it's with good and i do it i
[1:20:32] no doubt brother amen you do it too i
[1:20:34] see i was just talking to brother simon
[1:20:36] last night and i and i'm just gonna say
[1:20:38] this is as an ex uh just in uh
[1:20:42] an admission of it even we all do it but
[1:20:44] we have to understand
[1:20:46] that
[1:20:47] god isn't obligated to work by our
[1:20:49] thoughts about it right we're obligated
[1:20:52] to submit to his thoughts about it but i
[1:20:54] we were even talking about these things
[1:20:56] with i don't know if you saw the thing
[1:20:57] about the cows with the sevens on them
[1:20:59] and all the things that were happening
[1:21:00] and different things and we were talking
[1:21:02] about this last night i'm like my
[1:21:03] goodness these things could be happening
[1:21:04] here and happening there and then
[1:21:06] the thing i was just kind of thinking
[1:21:07] they just had the olympics
[1:21:09] and then there was over in tokyo in
[1:21:11] japan and what is that remember the
[1:21:12] gospel moves east to west
[1:21:14] and this is i'm just i'm using this as
[1:21:16] an example to admit that this is how as
[1:21:18] humans we think
[1:21:20] but if we're not careful we'll cling to
[1:21:22] it so much that we can't see what god's
[1:21:24] doing so i want you to take what i'm
[1:21:25] saying now with what it's worth you know
[1:21:27] like they say my advice is worth what
[1:21:29] you're paying for which is nothing so
[1:21:32] you take it for what it is but this is
[1:21:34] just my example i'm using as an example
[1:21:36] so i and i started thinking i was like
[1:21:38] wow the gospel moves east to west and it
[1:21:40] started in the these olympics were in
[1:21:42] tokyo
[1:21:43] and then in 2024 they're going to be in
[1:21:46] paris france
[1:21:48] and then 2028 they're going to be in los
[1:21:50] angeles california
[1:21:51] you know what brother branham said about
[1:21:53] paris he said that used to be the
[1:21:54] headquarters of the devil he said then
[1:21:56] he moved to hollywood in los angeles he
[1:21:58] said he even found the quote he said he
[1:22:00] moved he moved his headquarters from
[1:22:01] paris to los angeles i thought my i said
[1:22:05] the just like that oh it's almost like
[1:22:06] the only who knows maybe 2028's got
[1:22:08] something you know but but i think you
[1:22:10] think those ways right and there i don't
[1:22:12] think there's necessarily a problem with
[1:22:14] that because it shows that your mind is
[1:22:15] on on him and we want our desire is to
[1:22:18] understand
[1:22:19] but if we're not careful you get into
[1:22:22] that pharisee mindset where it's got to
[1:22:23] be this way because i just understand so
[1:22:25] much i know so much and it's got to be
[1:22:27] this way but i started thinking
[1:22:30] if it was that way at the coming of
[1:22:32] christ
[1:22:34] where the scripture said these flowery
[1:22:36] words because god was using it this way
[1:22:39] the the high places would be made low
[1:22:41] and the low places would be exalted and
[1:22:43] the crooked made straight and the rough
[1:22:45] place is made plain a voice of one
[1:22:47] crying in the wilderness
[1:22:49] and then god comes through a simple man
[1:22:50] like john the baptist
[1:22:52] and then in our minds we've got all
[1:22:54] these ideas of what this rapture is
[1:22:56] going to be and and how we're going to
[1:22:58] just you know we talk about we're going
[1:22:59] to we we're leaping over a wall and
[1:23:01] we're running through a troop and these
[1:23:03] things are going to happen and i thought
[1:23:05] my lord have we become so carnal
[1:23:09] that we've fallen into that trap to not
[1:23:10] realize that he's doing it right now
[1:23:13] that it's a spiritual happening
[1:23:15] right now
[1:23:18] brother branham said i believe in the
[1:23:19] seals those two hundred thousand
[1:23:21] thousand demons released out of
[1:23:23] euphrates
[1:23:24] trained right brother's bride to like i
[1:23:27] think he called them anti-diluvian
[1:23:28] demons
[1:23:29] ancient devils
[1:23:32] and those are just fighting the people
[1:23:33] of god
[1:23:34] you don't even realize right now
[1:23:37] every day that you live for christ
[1:23:39] you're running through a troop brothers
[1:23:40] and sisters you don't see it
[1:23:42] you're leaping over walls that the
[1:23:44] devil's trying to set up for you every
[1:23:45] day
[1:23:46] you're fighting devil's left and right
[1:23:48] and you don't even know it why the grace
[1:23:49] of god is upon you amen
[1:23:51] that holy ghost is leading you he puts a
[1:23:53] he puts a shield between you and him you
[1:23:56] got the armor of god and you're pressing
[1:23:58] the battles
[1:23:59] and we don't even realize what's
[1:24:00] happening
[1:24:01] just like the disciples didn't realize
[1:24:03] what was happening
[1:24:05] but it was happening all around them
[1:24:06] nonetheless
[1:24:08] i say lord
[1:24:09] remove all of our carnal thinking all of
[1:24:13] our carnal expectations
[1:24:15] of how we think you're supposed to move
[1:24:18] and lord let us get into that channel
[1:24:20] where lord i don't know how you're going
[1:24:22] to do it
[1:24:23] but i'm looking for it
[1:24:25] and lord give me the grace that when it
[1:24:27] comes i can just jump right in with it
[1:24:29] and jump right in that channel and go
[1:24:31] right with it because i i that's it
[1:24:33] because it was that simple for a rapture
[1:24:35] for enoch
[1:24:36] he walked with god and he was not
[1:24:39] for god took him
[1:24:41] and we've complicated things we've made
[1:24:44] it we've made it so complicated you must
[1:24:46] understand this and you must know this
[1:24:49] and you've got to do this and this and
[1:24:51] this is going to happen and yes there
[1:24:52] are going to happen
[1:24:54] i don't know how though so lord let me
[1:24:56] be
[1:24:57] in your mind
[1:24:59] let me be one with you
[1:25:01] let me get rid of all my thoughts
[1:25:03] all of my ideas
[1:25:05] all of my desires
[1:25:08] your desires don't have any place in
[1:25:09] this
[1:25:11] you've got to get rid of your desires
[1:25:13] you've got to replace them with his
[1:25:14] desires you got to get rid of your wants
[1:25:17] and replace them with his wants you've
[1:25:19] got to get rid of your expectation and
[1:25:21] put his expectation there there cannot
[1:25:23] be one speck of you left
[1:25:27] if i'm gonna make a rapture and i will
[1:25:29] because he promised me there can't be
[1:25:31] one speck of randall verton left
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:35] because randall verton won't go in the
[1:25:37] rapture but jesus christ is
[1:25:39] and he resides in randolph hurt and
[1:25:41] we're becoming one
[1:25:44] but he can't accept anything that's not
[1:25:46] him
[1:25:48] and we're trying we try to force god
[1:25:49] into to match our mold and that's
[1:25:51] nothing but a denominational spirit
[1:25:54] that's the evil of denomination
[1:25:56] is that where they would take god's word
[1:25:58] and try to mold it and twist it and
[1:26:00] contort it and pervert it to fit what
[1:26:02] their ideas are
[1:26:04] and it was it was funny because i happen
[1:26:07] to be just talking to my grandfather
[1:26:08] about that he talked about how he would
[1:26:10] listen to this guy that does bible
[1:26:11] studies and he and he believed in the
[1:26:13] whole doctrine once saved always saved
[1:26:15] the baptist mentality just it once
[1:26:17] you're done you're all done it's all
[1:26:18] good and in a way that is true but they
[1:26:20] pervert it because if you truly were
[1:26:22] saved then you always were that's true
[1:26:24] but then if you truly were then you
[1:26:26] can't not fall away i mean you can't
[1:26:28] fall away at that point
[1:26:30] but it'll manifest itself by the life
[1:26:32] that you live and the spirit that you
[1:26:33] have
[1:26:35] it's isn't it amazing how the devil
[1:26:36] would just take it and he'll take a
[1:26:38] truth and then pervert it to mean
[1:26:39] something totally different
[1:26:42] it's amazing how we'll do that but we're
[1:26:43] discussing this and and he said he said
[1:26:45] my and my grandpa doesn't believe in
[1:26:47] that he says once they don't light say i
[1:26:49] don't believe in that that's not he said
[1:26:50] but this this teacher i don't even know
[1:26:52] who it was but this teacher would never
[1:26:55] touch it
[1:26:56] because he said he just said well i
[1:26:58] can't reconcile it with the way i
[1:27:00] believe
[1:27:02] and even my grandfather who who who sits
[1:27:05] there and and my grandfather sat there
[1:27:07] and said well if you can't reconcile it
[1:27:09] with your beliefs then maybe your
[1:27:11] beliefs are wrong
[1:27:14] such a simple idea but that's what
[1:27:16] denomination does is they say well if i
[1:27:18] can't reconcile with the way i want to
[1:27:20] believe it
[1:27:21] then it must be something different
[1:27:23] no sir it's not god's word that's got to
[1:27:26] change it's us that has to change
[1:27:29] be not conformed to the image of this
[1:27:30] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:27:32] of your mind
[1:27:34] we've got we've done so much you know we
[1:27:37] because we've come so far in god he's
[1:27:40] revealed to us so much he's shown us so
[1:27:42] much and we've got to be careful we
[1:27:44] don't get puffed up in ourselves
[1:27:47] and we do it and we don't realize it
[1:27:49] because we start to think that god's got
[1:27:50] to work on our schedule
[1:27:52] that god's got to work in the way we
[1:27:54] anticipate he will do it
[1:27:56] no sir
[1:27:58] far be it from god to do that
[1:28:02] we've got to conform to his will we've
[1:28:04] got to conform to his desires
[1:28:06] oh my when when brother branham i think
[1:28:09] had prayed for that one and she died and
[1:28:11] god said you owe me an explanation he
[1:28:13] said god didn't talk to him for a long
[1:28:15] time i think it might have been a couple
[1:28:16] months
[1:28:18] he said god don't owe you nothing
[1:28:22] he owes you nothing
[1:28:24] he's already given you everything
[1:28:27] so how could he owe you anything
[1:28:30] he said yeah we we owe it to god
[1:28:33] to give ourselves a living sacrifice he
[1:28:35] said that is your reasonable service
[1:28:38] and what is the sacrifice the sacrifice
[1:28:40] is obedience
[1:28:42] why
[1:28:42] samuel said he said obedience is greater
[1:28:44] than sacrifice why obedience is a
[1:28:47] sacrifice it's when you sacrifice your
[1:28:50] will upon the altar
[1:28:52] you don't realize it people we make it
[1:28:54] out to be so difficult
[1:28:57] but god says it you do it
[1:29:00] god says it i will do it
[1:29:02] i don't understand it i don't always
[1:29:04] understand it but i and if i don't
[1:29:06] understand it i'm still going to believe
[1:29:07] it
[1:29:08] and i'm not going to try to figure it
[1:29:09] out until he shows it to me
[1:29:11] and he will reveal it at the time
[1:29:13] just like that he said unless you eat
[1:29:14] the flesh of the son of man and drink
[1:29:16] his blood you have no life in you
[1:29:17] if i was there i would have been what
[1:29:21] i wouldn't have understood it right the
[1:29:23] disciples didn't understand it
[1:29:26] and so and and the lord knows how to do
[1:29:28] it because he said if this is going to
[1:29:29] stumble you then watch this what would
[1:29:31] you say if you see the son of man coming
[1:29:33] to where he came from and they said okay
[1:29:34] now we can't take it and they left
[1:29:37] and that's exactly what they do today
[1:29:39] when it doesn't cope with what they
[1:29:40] think they start to run away from it
[1:29:43] why because
[1:29:44] they become their own god
[1:29:47] they don't realize it but they
[1:29:48] that's
[1:29:49] that's the garden of eden
[1:29:51] that's exactly what it was because eve
[1:29:53] wanted that knowledge
[1:29:55] right
[1:29:56] what what did satan promise eve he said
[1:29:58] he said god doth know that in the day
[1:30:00] you eat thereof you shall be as gods
[1:30:02] knowing good and evil
[1:30:06] did you know
[1:30:08] if she could have stepped back for a
[1:30:09] second she would realize what we know
[1:30:11] now
[1:30:12] they already were his gods
[1:30:14] right
[1:30:15] they were the gods of the earth that's
[1:30:16] right not only that they already knew
[1:30:19] good from evil
[1:30:20] to do god's word was good and to not do
[1:30:22] it was evil
[1:30:24] see but she got away what did she get
[1:30:26] away with simplicity
[1:30:28] that's what we do right we we weasel our
[1:30:31] way around it mentally we do mental
[1:30:33] gymnastics tie ourselves and not to
[1:30:35] excuse ourselves
[1:30:38] doesn't the scripture say that they said
[1:30:39] they'll explain
[1:30:41] excuses themselves
[1:30:44] they come up with ideas i remember
[1:30:45] listening to a thing about about even
[1:30:47] the catholic church and the jesuits how
[1:30:49] they they train themselves to do that
[1:30:52] they train themselves in self-deception
[1:30:55] because their mentality and their
[1:30:56] teachings for the jesuits is that if you
[1:30:58] can believe it you can say whatever you
[1:31:00] want as long as you can get yourself to
[1:31:02] believe it
[1:31:04] that's exactly what they do
[1:31:06] and so many times we fall into that trap
[1:31:07] and don't even know it because you say
[1:31:09] oh it couldn't have been this way
[1:31:10] because of this and this and this and
[1:31:11] all of a sudden we're doing this big
[1:31:13] roundabout maze to get to the end of the
[1:31:15] truth was that you were wrong or i was
[1:31:17] wrong you know i i've done it
[1:31:19] i've tried to make excuses for my
[1:31:20] mistakes when god just wants you to say
[1:31:24] i was wrong
[1:31:25] i was wrong to go against your word lord
[1:31:28] and you know what he'll accept that a
[1:31:30] humble and contrite heart he won't
[1:31:31] despise that
[1:31:33] god resisted the problem but he gives
[1:31:34] grace to the humble and when we're not
[1:31:36] willing see because we've been told so
[1:31:38] much that we're the bride
[1:31:40] we're the bride
[1:31:42] we're spotless and sinless and we are
[1:31:44] because he made us so yes
[1:31:47] but we've got oh have we gotten away
[1:31:49] from confessing our faults one to
[1:31:50] another
[1:31:51] have we gotten away from realizing that
[1:31:53] we have struggles
[1:31:55] but we won't admit it
[1:31:57] we'll deceive ourselves
[1:31:59] and we call it faith
[1:32:02] but it's just whistling through the
[1:32:04] graveyard
[1:32:05] because we know god's word's true
[1:32:07] i don't i believe all of us here know
[1:32:08] god's word is true
[1:32:10] and we know that that's the amen that's
[1:32:12] the end-all be-all but then when we
[1:32:14] don't toe up to it and we see that we
[1:32:16] don't tow up to it we try to make
[1:32:17] excuses for it
[1:32:19] oh well if it wouldn't have been this
[1:32:20] way i might have done this or lord i was
[1:32:22] i guess i was just made that way yeah
[1:32:24] that's why you need the transforming
[1:32:26] power of the holy ghost to change you
[1:32:29] that's why you need to surrender that
[1:32:30] thing to him and admit to god that
[1:32:33] you've got a problem here or a problem
[1:32:34] there the devil doesn't like it
[1:32:37] when you speak that thing and say lord i
[1:32:39] have this problem i have struggled with
[1:32:42] this or lord i have seen this in my life
[1:32:44] and i don't like it
[1:32:46] and i don't want to be that way anymore
[1:32:48] and i'm being honest with you lord i
[1:32:50] don't i don't want to be this way
[1:32:52] anymore but forgive me and help me
[1:32:55] but i will say well i'm the bride i've
[1:32:56] been i've been cleansed and all that
[1:32:58] stuff yes we have but he also wants you
[1:33:00] to break up that fallow ground
[1:33:04] but eve didn't know she was already as a
[1:33:06] god
[1:33:07] she was or she already knew good from
[1:33:09] evil
[1:33:10] god's word is good and to not do it was
[1:33:12] evil
[1:33:13] and i brother i believe we're coming
[1:33:15] back to that hour now
[1:33:16] of that simplicity
[1:33:19] we're trying to dissect it we try to
[1:33:20] make laws for everything so that way we
[1:33:22] can needle it down to to make a man
[1:33:26] version of do this and don't do that and
[1:33:29] we've turned it into law again
[1:33:32] and god just wants to say my word is
[1:33:34] truth
[1:33:36] work that's that's all you have to do is
[1:33:38] the word
[1:33:39] but we've we've turned it into
[1:33:41] we've tried to make a formula out of it
[1:33:44] and i don't even know why i went this
[1:33:45] direction it just kind of i hope this is
[1:33:48] okay
[1:33:49] i don't again i don't i hope nobody
[1:33:51] takes this condemnation i want to me i'm
[1:33:53] telling myself all the time i said lord
[1:33:56] if i've had certain expectations about
[1:33:58] the way i think my life should be
[1:34:00] get those out of my mind
[1:34:03] you know i i if if i've had expectations
[1:34:05] of you know when i was younger i had i
[1:34:07] had expectations i thought i was going
[1:34:09] to be a fighter pilot and do this and do
[1:34:10] that and god had to come across and slam
[1:34:12] the whole thing down to the ground to
[1:34:14] show me that there was something greater
[1:34:16] he had in store
[1:34:18] at the time i didn't see it and many
[1:34:20] times even now i still don't see it you
[1:34:23] know because you look at yourself you're
[1:34:24] your own worst critic
[1:34:26] you know
[1:34:27] if you're really truly looking at the
[1:34:29] mirror of god's word
[1:34:31] then you'll see how short you fall
[1:34:33] of the of the thing if you find yourself
[1:34:35] thinking oh i'm doing pretty good then
[1:34:37] you might want to check what measuring
[1:34:38] stick you're using
[1:34:41] because if you find i'm doing all right
[1:34:44] then you're probably measuring yourself
[1:34:46] off of somebody else
[1:34:47] and you're not measuring yourself off of
[1:34:48] jesus christ who's the measuring stick
[1:34:52] i think i always i think about that the
[1:34:54] dream that that the the man had that he
[1:34:56] went up and he was going to that bright
[1:34:57] light
[1:34:58] he's going to he was going to the white
[1:35:00] throne judgment he's going to heaven or
[1:35:02] and all these things and all of a sudden
[1:35:03] he said he felt really good about it and
[1:35:05] as he got close to that light all the
[1:35:06] things that he thought were okay started
[1:35:08] to get darker and darker
[1:35:10] and he got close to that light he
[1:35:11] started thinking about the shady deals
[1:35:13] he had pulled that they were okay in the
[1:35:14] moment that he thought was okay
[1:35:16] but what is it
[1:35:18] when you realize the holiness of god
[1:35:20] that the angels are filthy in his sight
[1:35:23] oh my
[1:35:25] and we think we're just gonna get by
[1:35:26] with our own carnal conception to what
[1:35:28] god's going to do no sir
[1:35:30] or carnal minds
[1:35:32] it's enmity it can't do anything with
[1:35:34] the word of your carnal mind can't do
[1:35:36] anything
[1:35:37] right that's why god wants you to accept
[1:35:39] it by faith without faith it's
[1:35:40] impossible to please him
[1:35:42] you've got to accept this and realize
[1:35:45] lord i know i can't do it but i'm
[1:35:47] accepting your sacrifice
[1:35:49] i'm accepting your propitiation that you
[1:35:51] provided i'm accepting that all my ways
[1:35:54] are no good but your ways are perfect
[1:35:58] not my will but thine be done lord if my
[1:36:01] will is getting in the way if my will
[1:36:03] has exalted itself that's of the devil
[1:36:06] that's what the devil did he said i will
[1:36:09] i will i will
[1:36:11] i was expressing to the church there in
[1:36:13] texas that you know under armour that's
[1:36:15] their big push right now their big
[1:36:17] slogan you know nike has that slogan
[1:36:19] just do it
[1:36:20] under armoured slogan that they've had i
[1:36:22] think over the last couple years one of
[1:36:23] their big ones is i will
[1:36:25] i will and for them they're trying to
[1:36:27] express this thing i will i you know
[1:36:29] i'll press through and do an extra
[1:36:30] workout and i'll do this drill and get
[1:36:32] better at my sport whatever they're
[1:36:34] doing but all it is is expressing the
[1:36:36] the nature of this hour that satanic
[1:36:41] nature of i will do this and i will do
[1:36:43] that and i will do this and then then
[1:36:45] the lord say don't even say tomorrow
[1:36:47] i'll do this or tomorrow i'll do that he
[1:36:49] said but if the lord will
[1:36:52] what are we doing where what are we
[1:36:53] doing we're paying respects
[1:36:56] to god
[1:36:58] lord
[1:36:59] i have this desire maybe you have a
[1:37:00] desire lord
[1:37:02] i i want to maybe i wanted to go my
[1:37:05] desire was to have my wife come out here
[1:37:07] and visit with with us and her desire
[1:37:09] was to come out here but the lord had
[1:37:11] other plans
[1:37:13] and i was frustrated when it happened i
[1:37:15] can admit that i was frustrated when
[1:37:17] circumstances came about that she wasn't
[1:37:19] able to come but then the lord
[1:37:22] in my heart i could i could tell it was
[1:37:24] god
[1:37:25] i said but don't you see some of these
[1:37:26] other circumstances that came up you
[1:37:28] know brother simon wasn't able to be
[1:37:30] here and it might have been a little bit
[1:37:31] more now you have a little bit more of a
[1:37:34] of a burden not to say it's a burden
[1:37:35] brother jesse not to say it that way but
[1:37:37] maybe more labor to partake of that you
[1:37:39] need to have more focus on the word and
[1:37:41] maybe not as much on fellowship this
[1:37:43] time so if you bring your wife you're
[1:37:44] going to be pulled to do more fellowship
[1:37:46] and you want to really i want to give
[1:37:47] god first place so brother jesse forgive
[1:37:50] me if maybe i'm not fellowshipping so
[1:37:51] much until after the service on sunday
[1:37:53] but i just feel in my heart that if i'm
[1:37:55] going to do the word of god the will of
[1:37:57] god i've got to set that aside i've got
[1:38:00] to put him first
[1:38:03] because it wouldn't profit anything if i
[1:38:05] just come up and and and i haven't been
[1:38:07] in the atmosphere if i'm not in the
[1:38:09] right the the frame of mind and in the
[1:38:11] right spiritual condition to be able to
[1:38:13] come up and hopefully by his grace yield
[1:38:15] myself to him
[1:38:17] but it was my desire for that but the
[1:38:19] lord had other plans and i have to say
[1:38:20] lord not my will but the earth be done
[1:38:23] lord it's my desire that that you know
[1:38:26] even
[1:38:27] it would be my desire that this would
[1:38:29] happen or this would happen but lord not
[1:38:30] my will but yours be done lord my
[1:38:33] expectations are this maybe you have
[1:38:35] expectations in your life of the way you
[1:38:37] think things are going to go but say
[1:38:39] lord even though i expect it maybe this
[1:38:42] way lord if that's wrong
[1:38:44] change my expectations to yours
[1:38:47] change what i'm looking for to be let me
[1:38:50] not see with my own eyes but let me see
[1:38:52] what your eyes
[1:38:54] let me not see with my own desires but
[1:38:56] let me use your desires to be manifested
[1:38:59] so that way i can see what you see so
[1:39:01] that way when this word when this word
[1:39:03] comes when it's when this event comes
[1:39:05] and that changing of the body that
[1:39:07] rapture's happening the changing of the
[1:39:09] body is just a culmination of it
[1:39:11] but their rapture is happening right now
[1:39:13] and i say lord if i'm looking for the
[1:39:15] wrong things if i've had this
[1:39:17] expectation of my mind of the way it
[1:39:18] ought to be lord change my expectation
[1:39:21] lord if i've been looking at it a
[1:39:22] certain way change my perspective that's
[1:39:25] what he did with the what do you think
[1:39:26] with brother brandon with that cloud he
[1:39:28] said you said you have to change your
[1:39:29] perspective to see what that cloud was
[1:39:31] showing
[1:39:32] you had to change your perspective
[1:39:35] it's not it's not the it's not the photo
[1:39:37] that changed it's that you had to change
[1:39:40] it's not the word that has to change but
[1:39:42] our perspective on it has to change what
[1:39:44] our expectations are has to change uh
[1:39:47] when our when our love for him has to
[1:39:50] change and come up higher
[1:39:55] i want to see
[1:39:57] i want to see exactly what god wants me
[1:39:59] to see
[1:40:02] i want to see what he wants me to see i
[1:40:05] want to get my that's the crux of all of
[1:40:07] it and just i guess as we're opening up
[1:40:09] these services that we're kind of doing
[1:40:10] this weekend and having just a couple
[1:40:12] services i'm no great preacher i i i'm
[1:40:15] the least of all of them i promise you
[1:40:16] that i promise you that when it comes to
[1:40:19] that because i know i can't do anything
[1:40:21] i'm just uh i'm just a dumb person who
[1:40:24] who's you know by his grace i'm trying
[1:40:26] to do my best and i pray that all of my
[1:40:29] shortcomings i know i believe that the
[1:40:31] grace of god will be there to fill the
[1:40:33] gaps
[1:40:34] for all my shortcomings and he'll bridge
[1:40:36] those gaps and be able to speak to you
[1:40:38] what he needs to speak to you because i
[1:40:40] know i can't do it
[1:40:42] you know i i know i have no ability but
[1:40:44] i'm trusting him and so as we're that's
[1:40:46] i just wanted to i felt led to maybe
[1:40:48] start off on this foot with these little
[1:40:50] meetings that we're having i don't know
[1:40:52] don't come in here with your own
[1:40:53] expectation of i have this need and
[1:40:55] god's gonna answer it this way
[1:40:57] just say lord i have needs
[1:41:00] however you would speak to me
[1:41:02] i believe that you will
[1:41:04] how you do it i don't know
[1:41:06] how you'll manifest it i don't know
[1:41:09] but i have expectation that you will
[1:41:11] that's what god wants he doesn't know
[1:41:13] what he don't want you to expect it in a
[1:41:15] certain way he just wants you to expect
[1:41:17] it
[1:41:19] say lord i if you have need of healing
[1:41:21] say lord i know my healing's finished
[1:41:24] and i'm going to wait here at
[1:41:25] expectation how you choose to manifest
[1:41:27] it lord i don't care
[1:41:29] as long as you do because you promised
[1:41:31] you would
[1:41:32] lord if i if you need a deliverance you
[1:41:34] say lord i i'm expecting deliverance
[1:41:38] i don't know how it will come
[1:41:40] i don't know when it might come but i'm
[1:41:43] gonna wait here and expectation
[1:41:45] with a heart that's open to receive it
[1:41:49] and lord if i'm thinking in the wrong
[1:41:51] way put me in the channel so that when
[1:41:53] you do pass by
[1:41:55] i can see it and i can recognize it i
[1:41:58] can recognize my moment i can recognize
[1:42:00] the presence of god i can recognize that
[1:42:03] he's passing by
[1:42:06] you got to have the right approach
[1:42:09] you have to come the right way yes
[1:42:11] remember what he said blind bartimaeus
[1:42:14] thou son of david have mercy on me thou
[1:42:16] son of david have mercy on me and god
[1:42:18] could respect that
[1:42:21] but then with the other woman
[1:42:23] and said
[1:42:24] said oh son of david said that she
[1:42:26] wasn't son sending david to her
[1:42:29] why she maybe had her own approach
[1:42:32] that oh maybe maybe she even heard blind
[1:42:34] bartimaeus at one point i don't know i
[1:42:35] can't remember where it is
[1:42:36] chronologically maybe she heard that or
[1:42:38] heard a testimony
[1:42:40] and so she thought well maybe those are
[1:42:41] the magic words
[1:42:43] you know how we think
[1:42:45] that's the carnal mind
[1:42:47] i'm not too proud to admit that i've
[1:42:48] thought that before lord if i could just
[1:42:50] say it a certain way or
[1:42:52] you know maybe as a preacher maybe you
[1:42:55] think if i could just preach it this way
[1:42:56] it would be more effective
[1:42:59] no but it's got to be the way he decides
[1:43:01] he made me the way he made me
[1:43:03] he made brother jesse to preach the way
[1:43:05] he does he made brother amen to sing
[1:43:07] songs and you to you know no one can sit
[1:43:09] in a pew or a chair like you can
[1:43:12] because god made you that way
[1:43:14] nobody can pull on the word of god the
[1:43:16] way you can for your position because he
[1:43:18] made you unique yes
[1:43:21] and so she called out son of david said
[1:43:24] but she wasn't that to her
[1:43:26] but when she called out lord see there
[1:43:28] was a faith there
[1:43:30] she had the faith
[1:43:32] because god responded to it but her
[1:43:34] approach was wrong
[1:43:36] but when she could change her approach
[1:43:39] the faith manifested itself
[1:43:42] so maybe if we're seeing that we're not
[1:43:44] seeing manifestation
[1:43:46] the way we think we ought to
[1:43:48] and i believe we could all say that to
[1:43:50] an extent i don't see god manifested in
[1:43:53] my life the way i want to
[1:43:54] the way i know this word says it ought
[1:43:56] to be
[1:43:57] i fall short
[1:43:59] so lord made me change my approach
[1:44:01] change the way i'm looking at it
[1:44:03] change my perspective
[1:44:05] because i know the word's perfect yes i
[1:44:07] know this message we've received is
[1:44:09] perfect
[1:44:10] because we've received a word in our
[1:44:12] hour
[1:44:12] that's for us
[1:44:14] this book this bible has made a new book
[1:44:17] we're able to see things that the world
[1:44:19] knows nothing about
[1:44:22] but we still have to approach it the
[1:44:23] right way
[1:44:24] see isn't that funny that that woman
[1:44:28] knew
[1:44:29] that that was god and that she could be
[1:44:30] touched by it
[1:44:32] she had the faith for it yes
[1:44:34] but what was her only problem her
[1:44:36] approach was wrong
[1:44:39] so
[1:44:40] we know that this word is true we know
[1:44:42] we've received a message for our day we
[1:44:44] know we've received those things we've
[1:44:46] talked about it
[1:44:47] i say ad nauseum or without end and we
[1:44:50] can talk about it more and it's
[1:44:51] wonderful and we rejoice in it the fact
[1:44:52] that god chose you to hear it to accept
[1:44:55] it and believe it
[1:44:56] but now we say lord now we got to see it
[1:44:58] work
[1:44:59] we got to see it work we got to have the
[1:45:01] right approach
[1:45:02] lord if i'm approaching it from the
[1:45:03] wrong angle
[1:45:05] if i'm approaching it the wrong way lord
[1:45:07] i believe that you've instilled to put a
[1:45:09] faith in me to receive it
[1:45:12] i've seen it in my life i believe you've
[1:45:14] seen it in your life i i've been through
[1:45:16] the trials and tribulations and i've had
[1:45:18] my struggles and for whatever reason god
[1:45:20] holds on to me
[1:45:22] praise the lord
[1:45:24] praise the lord jesus for holding on to
[1:45:25] you
[1:45:26] for holding on to me but now it's time
[1:45:28] for us to come up higher
[1:45:30] it's time for us to adjust our
[1:45:32] expectations focus the looking glass and
[1:45:35] see with his eyes
[1:45:39] bring those two into perfect harmony to
[1:45:42] where we can see it clearly to where we
[1:45:44] can see the right approach and if i if
[1:45:46] we go with that right approach he
[1:45:48] responds
[1:45:50] because as soon as she cried out lord
[1:45:53] lord
[1:45:54] he responded
[1:45:57] lord help us to look the right way
[1:46:00] help us to respond
[1:46:01] with that that right attitude the right
[1:46:04] approach and and as we're just beginning
[1:46:06] these little meetings maybe we could go
[1:46:08] in with that that challenge
[1:46:11] you know maybe you had an expectation of
[1:46:13] oh brother preaches this way or we're
[1:46:15] maybe expecting it this certain way
[1:46:16] don't look at it like that
[1:46:18] but just say lord
[1:46:20] the only things that i know remember
[1:46:22] what the woman at the well oh i know i
[1:46:24] don't know anything else except when the
[1:46:26] messiah comes he'll do these things
[1:46:29] she didn't know much
[1:46:31] but what did she do she didn't cage god
[1:46:35] by what she thought she knew
[1:46:38] she just knew that it was truth
[1:46:41] and she didn't expect it to manifest in
[1:46:43] any particular way she said lord just
[1:46:45] i believe there was a cry in her heart
[1:46:47] said lord i believe your messiah is
[1:46:49] coming
[1:46:50] and if you would just show them to me
[1:46:51] i'll follow
[1:46:53] i don't know how he's going to come see
[1:46:54] how much greater is that than that
[1:46:56] pharisee who'd say lord we know your
[1:46:59] messiah comes
[1:47:01] true
[1:47:02] but he will come this way
[1:47:04] wrong
[1:47:06] see how that see how the attitude's
[1:47:08] different
[1:47:09] so let's have let's have that attitude
[1:47:11] of the woman at the well say lord
[1:47:13] i know
[1:47:14] i know that maybe brother randy preaches
[1:47:16] this way or maybe you don't even think
[1:47:18] i'm a good preacher and that's fine
[1:47:19] because i'm not
[1:47:20] that's fine i'm nobody i don't care
[1:47:22] about that because i'm not looking for a
[1:47:23] reputation
[1:47:25] maybe you've had all these ideas in your
[1:47:27] head of what the services would be
[1:47:29] or what's going to happen over the next
[1:47:31] couple days
[1:47:32] as a as a minister
[1:47:34] you even get trapped in those lord
[1:47:37] you've given me these a certain thought
[1:47:39] and this and this is just the way it's
[1:47:40] going to go brother how often does it
[1:47:42] actually happen the way you think it's
[1:47:43] going to go i would venture to say
[1:47:45] basically 0.00
[1:47:48] it almost never seems to go the way you
[1:47:49] thought it was going to go
[1:47:51] why because
[1:47:52] our carnal expectations
[1:47:54] are are so far outside he said my
[1:47:56] thoughts are above your thoughts
[1:47:58] and my ways are above your ways the
[1:48:01] scripture says in ephesians he says to
[1:48:03] him who can do exceedingly and
[1:48:04] abundantly above what you can ask or
[1:48:07] think
[1:48:08] so think about that think about all the
[1:48:10] things that you can think and all the
[1:48:12] things that you can ask he's going to do
[1:48:14] above that
[1:48:17] it doesn't mean he's going to do
[1:48:19] above in the sense he's just going to do
[1:48:20] more he's going to give you other things
[1:48:22] that you thought and he's going to do
[1:48:23] more he's going to do it above that
[1:48:24] though
[1:48:25] he wants you to come up higher
[1:48:27] he wants you to come beyond we can't if
[1:48:30] i can say it this way without sounding
[1:48:31] like we're be you know because sometimes
[1:48:33] i feel like we almost come off elitist
[1:48:35] in a way you know what i mean oh we're
[1:48:36] the bride and this and that no by his
[1:48:38] grace
[1:48:39] he's allowed us to see
[1:48:42] oh my goodness
[1:48:43] he's given us something i didn't just i
[1:48:46] was not even looking for this message
[1:48:49] and he dropped it by my way
[1:48:51] oh praise be to god
[1:48:54] i still don't deserve it i fail him so
[1:48:56] much
[1:48:57] but he's
[1:48:58] faithful amen he made me a promise
[1:49:01] that's all i can hold i say lord i don't
[1:49:03] know how you're going to make it happen
[1:49:04] but i do know you promised me so let's
[1:49:07] come with that expectation that type of
[1:49:08] expectation lord i don't know how these
[1:49:10] will go
[1:49:11] i don't know how the meetings will go
[1:49:13] but i do know one thing your word
[1:49:14] promise where two or three are gathered
[1:49:16] you be in the midst
[1:49:17] lord you said you hear the cries of your
[1:49:19] people
[1:49:20] and i have a need
[1:49:22] and lord your your word says that you've
[1:49:24] already supplied that need
[1:49:26] lord i don't know how you'll do it but
[1:49:28] lord let my expectation
[1:49:31] match how you will deliver it
[1:49:34] if those two can match up
[1:49:36] that's when the miraculous are happening
[1:49:37] brothers and sisters
[1:49:39] it's when it's when you're over here
[1:49:41] thinking oh god surely got to come this
[1:49:43] way and he comes this way
[1:49:46] that's where we get in trouble but let's
[1:49:48] just be simple
[1:49:50] let's just be humble
[1:49:52] let's just go before the lord
[1:49:54] not with their own thoughts lord you owe
[1:49:56] me this and i'm the bride so we got to
[1:49:58] do it this way no
[1:50:00] without him or nothing
[1:50:01] yeah
[1:50:02] lord nothing
[1:50:04] nothing in my arms i bring only to your
[1:50:06] cross i claim amen
[1:50:09] what whom have i on earth beside thee
[1:50:11] whom in heaven but thee
[1:50:13] my thoughts won't do me any good they
[1:50:14] never did me any good before
[1:50:17] they certainly won't do any good now
[1:50:23] his thoughts are above our thoughts
[1:50:24] his ways are above our ways he can do
[1:50:27] exceedingly abundantly above all you can
[1:50:28] ask or think
[1:50:30] so let's have that mind of christ
[1:50:33] to and what is it what's the first part
[1:50:35] of the mind of christ he humbled himself
[1:50:39] humility
[1:50:41] you can't have humility
[1:50:44] without humiliation
[1:50:49] when you just let it all out
[1:50:52] let yourself be bare before him
[1:50:55] he sees it anyway amen you ain't hot
[1:50:58] you're not hiding anything from god
[1:51:00] so don't try to make it make yourself
[1:51:02] out to be
[1:51:03] something else or this or that or try to
[1:51:05] convince yourself be honest with god
[1:51:07] let's be honest with god
[1:51:09] and then say lord maybe i've had i've
[1:51:11] wanted it a certain way lord if if my
[1:51:14] motives were wrong if my objectives were
[1:51:15] wrong lord tune those to your word
[1:51:19] let my motives and objectives match your
[1:51:21] word let my expectation match your word
[1:51:24] let's all stand
[1:51:26] that's so i just that's i have it on my
[1:51:27] heart let's just approach god in this
[1:51:29] little week and i don't know what the
[1:51:30] word will do
[1:51:32] but i do know what he said in that word
[1:51:34] we just read he'll do a seatedly and
[1:51:35] abundantly above what you can ask or
[1:51:37] think
[1:51:38] so everything that you can think he can
[1:51:40] do above that
[1:51:43] so let's have expectation for that
[1:51:45] not that lord it has to come a certain
[1:51:47] way
[1:51:49] the only way i will say lord is it has
[1:51:50] to come by is it's got to come by his
[1:51:52] word
[1:51:53] because that's what he said
[1:51:55] but other than that i say lord you know
[1:51:57] just because i don't understand it
[1:51:58] doesn't mean it isn't so because there's
[1:52:00] a lot of things i don't understand
[1:52:02] but it doesn't mean it's not so
[1:52:04] so let's humble ourselves
[1:52:07] we ought to be of all people the most
[1:52:08] humble
[1:52:10] meek and lowly
[1:52:12] serving one another preferring our
[1:52:14] brothers and sisters
[1:52:16] preferring you know even the people you
[1:52:18] work with preferring them over yourself
[1:52:20] and
[1:52:21] and just love and humility and
[1:52:23] compassion and and just you know that's
[1:52:26] eternal life
[1:52:27] is living for others
[1:52:29] pouring yourself out for others
[1:52:31] preferring one another but you know
[1:52:34] before each other right before i think
[1:52:35] it was in i think it might have been in
[1:52:37] ephesians or
[1:52:39] i may be misremembering but he says
[1:52:42] looking not onto our own things but each
[1:52:45] one unto the things of others
[1:52:47] and what is that that doesn't mean oh
[1:52:49] well brother amen's got this so i'm
[1:52:50] going to look at his stuff because i
[1:52:51] really want it it's not a covetous
[1:52:53] looking
[1:52:54] but it's a it's a it's a protecting it's
[1:52:56] a it's a guarding it's a watching it's a
[1:52:58] it's a being a watchful person and hey
[1:53:01] brother you know being look at brother
[1:53:02] amen man maybe he looked a little down
[1:53:04] today so i'm going to go to prayer for
[1:53:05] him
[1:53:06] i'm going to look upon the things of
[1:53:07] others that's why brother branham would
[1:53:09] say so many times and i know i'm using
[1:53:11] that a lot about what brother branham
[1:53:12] said but see he was teaching us well a
[1:53:14] lot of times we're looking at these very
[1:53:16] specific things and trying to understand
[1:53:18] but he was trying to show us the nature
[1:53:21] of god
[1:53:23] the nature that's why he'd say don't
[1:53:25] pray for yourself but pray for one
[1:53:26] another
[1:53:27] and you'll see things happen in your own
[1:53:29] life why because that was what god did
[1:53:31] god didn't come to sadness jesus didn't
[1:53:33] come to satisfy himself
[1:53:36] but he came to save
[1:53:38] he came he came to redeem his bride back
[1:53:40] to himself
[1:53:43] he brother branham what did he say he
[1:53:44] said he could have had a wife could have
[1:53:46] had children could have had a life
[1:53:48] but he sacrificed it all
[1:53:50] he said he just despising you know he
[1:53:53] took the cross despising the shame you
[1:53:55] know he looked past those things
[1:53:57] for the glory
[1:53:59] that was waiting for him
[1:54:02] so let's have that same mind
[1:54:05] you know you say oh we don't you know
[1:54:07] many times where
[1:54:08] we don't think it but we want glory on
[1:54:10] this side we want to see these great
[1:54:12] miraculous things happen because we want
[1:54:14] vindication for ourselves
[1:54:16] as a minister many times you'd get
[1:54:18] trapped thinking well if we didn't have
[1:54:19] this certain response that i was
[1:54:21] expecting well certainly
[1:54:23] then
[1:54:24] god didn't work
[1:54:25] but then i have to be reminded
[1:54:27] again of what the prophet said the
[1:54:29] greatest anointing
[1:54:31] when he sat in the temple and he said
[1:54:32] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:54:35] there wasn't no screaming and shouting
[1:54:37] and jumping and hollering there
[1:54:40] but it just said precious words flowed
[1:54:42] from him and he and he talked to people
[1:54:44] and and that was one of the greatest
[1:54:46] anointing
[1:54:47] when he sat there and said this day this
[1:54:49] scripture is fulfilled
[1:54:51] see our expectations have to die
[1:54:54] lord let us have your expectations lord
[1:54:57] let us have your mind
[1:54:59] lord let us look for the things that you
[1:55:01] look for
[1:55:02] oh lord we
[1:55:04] i confess to you
[1:55:06] for my own self confess your false one
[1:55:08] to another i'll confess you right now
[1:55:10] i've been too carnal in my expectations
[1:55:13] i've looked for things
[1:55:15] in ways that i thought i expected them
[1:55:16] to come because i had it in my mind it
[1:55:18] would come that way
[1:55:20] and i say lord forgive me
[1:55:23] i let's just bow our heads and say maybe
[1:55:25] you could raise your hand too and think
[1:55:27] of places in your in your life where you
[1:55:29] say lord forgive me i've looked
[1:55:32] and i've had carnal expectations
[1:55:35] i've had thoughts in my own mind
[1:55:37] of it lord it's got to be this way
[1:55:39] because of this and because of that
[1:55:41] because i'm
[1:55:42] for
[1:55:43] approaching you in a carnal manner and
[1:55:44] thinking lord lord it's got to be this
[1:55:46] way or it's got to be that way lord
[1:55:48] lord because i'm even reminded now of
[1:55:50] abraham when he listened and hearkened
[1:55:52] to the voice of his wife she had a
[1:55:54] carnal reasoning she had a carnal
[1:55:56] expectation of how the word would be
[1:55:58] fulfilled in her
[1:56:00] and lord what did it produce but just a
[1:56:02] wild man
[1:56:03] and what have we done in our lives lord
[1:56:05] will produce wild men
[1:56:08] we produce wild doctrines
[1:56:10] we produce wild people
[1:56:12] who just go out after anything because
[1:56:15] they're not anchored in the word lord
[1:56:16] because we've we've tried to come up
[1:56:18] with a carnal explanation for why things
[1:56:21] have to be a certain way
[1:56:23] lord take all the carnality out of us
[1:56:28] help us to come up higher
[1:56:30] help us to be mature christians
[1:56:32] lord when we could go before you lord
[1:56:34] not with a a baby-like mentality of lord
[1:56:37] do this and lord do that because i want
[1:56:39] this and i want that but like a a mature
[1:56:42] adult could say lord if it would be your
[1:56:44] will
[1:56:45] could this be so
[1:56:47] and lord if you were to answer us like
[1:56:49] you answered paul and say no
[1:56:52] not this time my child
[1:56:54] but my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:56:56] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:56:58] weakness lord we wouldn't rail like a
[1:57:00] little child would throw a fit and fuss
[1:57:02] and stew and and throw our hands up say
[1:57:04] oh god why did you do this and why did
[1:57:07] you have this happen lord you you
[1:57:09] promise that you're a healer but you
[1:57:10] won't do it for me right now and this
[1:57:12] and that
[1:57:13] but lord we could say like paul like a
[1:57:15] mature christian he was
[1:57:17] and say rather than i'll glorif glory in
[1:57:19] my infirmities
[1:57:21] that the power of god may rest upon me
[1:57:24] oh my lord that's a mature christian
[1:57:27] lord that's a that's a believer that
[1:57:29] doesn't have to be coddled
[1:57:30] that doesn't have to be babied and
[1:57:33] fed a bunch of cookies and and junk
[1:57:35] spiritual junk food where we just had to
[1:57:39] take all the sweet things
[1:57:41] lord but when when john ate that book it
[1:57:43] was sweet in his mouth but it made his
[1:57:44] belly bitter
[1:57:45] but it was still life to him
[1:57:48] lord if we have to take a bitter pill to
[1:57:49] swallow when you have to correct us lord
[1:57:52] and we can rejoice lord even to the
[1:57:54] bitter things
[1:57:56] but lord it would still rejoice in the
[1:57:57] sweet things when you provide lord i
[1:57:59] think of how you allowed me to
[1:58:00] fellowship with my grandfather and
[1:58:02] fellowship with brother simon lord you
[1:58:04] didn't have to do that but lord you
[1:58:06] allowed a little thing like that and i
[1:58:08] rejoice in that but lord i i just pray
[1:58:11] that even if you had said no just like
[1:58:13] you said no to bring my wife out here
[1:58:15] with me though it was my desire
[1:58:17] lord
[1:58:18] like a child i started to get frustrated
[1:58:21] but then i say lord not my will but
[1:58:23] yours be done
[1:58:24] lord because you do all things well
[1:58:27] you do all things well lord
[1:58:29] if i don't understand it you do all
[1:58:31] things well
[1:58:34] lord and maybe i don't understand well
[1:58:36] all the time
[1:58:38] lord maybe we don't accept your will
[1:58:39] right all the time
[1:58:41] but lord let us come up higher
[1:58:44] lord maybe we've been i think of how
[1:58:45] i've been looking at this rapture for so
[1:58:47] many years in a certain way but lord i
[1:58:49] can feel that just like the prophet took
[1:58:52] that picture and started to turn it lord
[1:58:54] i can feel my perspective beginning to
[1:58:55] turn
[1:58:57] lord who has despised the day of small
[1:58:59] things
[1:59:00] lord you're looking for truth in the
[1:59:02] inward parts
[1:59:03] lord you're looking for honest and see
[1:59:06] your hearts lord that could be honest
[1:59:08] with ourselves and say lord we haven't
[1:59:10] surrendered the way we ought to
[1:59:12] lord we haven't humbled ourselves the
[1:59:14] way we ought to lord we've been looking
[1:59:17] at things the way maybe we shouldn't
[1:59:18] have lord we haven't stepped back and
[1:59:20] really thought say lord how do you look
[1:59:23] at this
[1:59:24] help us to see with your eyes lord help
[1:59:27] us to hear with your ears
[1:59:28] lord help us to speak with your lips
[1:59:31] well help it to only be the word i'm
[1:59:33] reminded of even when we were here last
[1:59:35] time speaking on those different senses
[1:59:37] lord help us to to have memories of the
[1:59:40] memories you have of us
[1:59:42] help us to see each other with the eyes
[1:59:44] that you see i believe lord your prophet
[1:59:46] said you don't see that sinful nature
[1:59:48] anymore but you see a finished work
[1:59:51] lord you saw the end from the beginning
[1:59:54] that's why you could come back in the
[1:59:56] book of hebrews in chapter 11
[1:59:58] and put we call it a hall of fame lord
[2:00:01] of all the great exploits that were done
[2:00:04] lord it is not a negative thing spoken
[2:00:06] why because you didn't see the negative
[2:00:08] because it was cast in the sea of
[2:00:09] forgetfulness
[2:00:12] but lord help us to see with your eyes
[2:00:14] here with your ears
[2:00:15] speak with your lips
[2:00:17] touch with your hands
[2:00:19] lord and
[2:00:21] lord we'll just give it all to you we
[2:00:22] want to surrender every fiber of our
[2:00:24] being we surrender our understanding to
[2:00:27] you
[2:00:28] we surrender our thoughts to you
[2:00:31] we surrender our emotions to you our
[2:00:33] wants and desires
[2:00:36] lord
[2:00:37] lord maybe things that we think that we
[2:00:40] have need of lord do we actually need it
[2:00:42] or we as
[2:00:43] i believe it was james you have not
[2:00:45] because you asked not and then you have
[2:00:47] not because you desire so you can
[2:00:48] consume it upon your lusts
[2:00:50] lord have we been lusting for things
[2:00:51] that we just want to have to make our
[2:00:53] lives easier
[2:00:54] or our lord are we looking for the
[2:00:56] things that would bring us into deeper
[2:00:58] fellowship with you
[2:01:00] lord it is not even lord that a a you
[2:01:03] know a delicious meal as we spoke of
[2:01:04] wouldn't be a bad thing in and of itself
[2:01:07] but lord is that our focus
[2:01:09] lord is our is or is our focus to serve
[2:01:12] you
[2:01:13] lord maybe it sounds fanatical lord but
[2:01:15] i want to be so sold out to you
[2:01:17] till every fiber of my being lord i
[2:01:19] could that my our hearts i believe all
[2:01:21] of our hearts would like to say as jesus
[2:01:23] said i do nothing except the father
[2:01:25] shows me
[2:01:27] oh lord in our in my carnal mind even
[2:01:29] now it seems like such a goal that would
[2:01:31] be impossible
[2:01:33] the devil would be right there to say oh
[2:01:34] you're not a prophet you don't see
[2:01:36] visions like they saw so how could you
[2:01:38] know the mind of god
[2:01:39] lord i don't understand how you're gonna
[2:01:41] do it lord but i believe that you will
[2:01:43] and lord i'm not gonna
[2:01:45] bind you up with my carnal expectations
[2:01:47] lord but i'm gonna believe your word
[2:01:49] because you said you would do it
[2:01:52] but we just commit these services as
[2:01:54] we're gathered here the next couple of
[2:01:56] days
[2:01:57] lord i want to be totally out of the way
[2:02:00] lord i want i i just want you to move
[2:02:03] lord i'm not sufficient to do it more
[2:02:05] but we place that on the altar now
[2:02:09] lord because we know that you're able
[2:02:11] we're not resting in our own strength
[2:02:13] anyhow lord but we're resting in you
[2:02:16] lord let us do as much as we can
[2:02:18] and then we've come when we've come to
[2:02:20] the end of what we can do lord let us
[2:02:21] step out by faith
[2:02:24] and trust in you
[2:02:26] lord we just place it into your hands
[2:02:28] lord you know the hearts and needs of
[2:02:30] your
[2:02:30] people though we know that you're going
[2:02:32] to do
[2:02:34] exceedingly and abundantly above what we
[2:02:36] ask or think
[2:02:38] lord why because it's what you promised
[2:02:41] and we're expectation for that lord
[2:02:44] we commit these services now we commit
[2:02:46] the rest of this evening into your hands
[2:02:48] lord may you just receive our praises
[2:02:51] lord may they be from honest sincere
[2:02:53] hearts
[2:02:55] lord from lips that have been touched by
[2:02:56] the colds from the altar
[2:02:59] lord we just
[2:03:00] give it all to you now in the name of
[2:03:02] the lord jesus christ we pray
[2:03:04] amen amen
[2:03:07] amen let's just keep that in our hearts
[2:03:09] i hope that's okay to say i just that
[2:03:11] was my my real sincere desire lord you
[2:03:14] know we have expectations we want
[2:03:16] expectations yes but let us
[2:03:19] not put a period at that expectation
[2:03:21] lord you'll do it this way but just say
[2:03:22] lord i know you'll do it
[2:03:24] but fulfill it however you will
[2:03:27] and for whatever i have need of lord
[2:03:28] however your desire is to fulfill that
[2:03:31] need
[2:03:32] i say you know if i can say it this way
[2:03:34] without sounding like i'm being in this
[2:03:36] i feel a moment of sincerity but i feel
[2:03:38] like this is a really good example you
[2:03:40] know i order something off of amazon
[2:03:42] we make these orders i don't care if it
[2:03:45] comes by ups i don't care if it comes by
[2:03:48] the usps or fedex
[2:03:50] the only thing that i care is that the
[2:03:51] package is delivered
[2:03:53] let us have that mindset with god lord
[2:03:56] lord as we've sent those messages to him
[2:03:58] he'll perform what he promised lord i
[2:04:00] don't care if it i don't care if it
[2:04:02] comes through this ministry of mine that
[2:04:04] he's given to me this little ministry
[2:04:05] that i have i don't care if it comes
[2:04:07] that way i don't care if it comes a year
[2:04:09] from now if we tarry that long and
[2:04:11] another minister comes by why because he
[2:04:13] said one plants one waters but god gives
[2:04:16] the increase
[2:04:17] and lord even if we don't see anything
[2:04:19] right now naturally may it be as that
[2:04:21] seed that's planted and it comes and
[2:04:23] grows and and brings forth a hundredfold
[2:04:27] not have carnal expectations for it
[2:04:31] but that farmer that that sower sows
[2:04:34] with an eager expectation of the law of
[2:04:37] god that what he plan
[2:04:38] will bring forth
[2:04:40] we're planting seeds right now
[2:04:42] god is planting seeds continually
[2:04:45] that preaching of the word is going
[2:04:46] forth he's planted in your heart i
[2:04:49] believe right now
[2:04:50] so not just continue to water it say
[2:04:52] lord i don't know what season it's going
[2:04:54] to bring its fruit i don't know when
[2:04:56] it's going to bring its fruit or even
[2:04:57] what that fruit exactly is going to look
[2:04:59] like when it manifests
[2:05:01] but lord let it be according to your
[2:05:03] word let it court according to your will
[2:05:05] can we all approach him in that way with
[2:05:07] that simplicity
[2:05:10] amen if anybody has a desire a prayer
[2:05:12] we'll be happy to pray for you
[2:05:14] but you know you can you can accept it
[2:05:16] right where you're at now
[2:05:18] but if you have a desire to do you laid
[2:05:20] out you know that's in the word that's
[2:05:22] what i love about the lord even in our
[2:05:24] our
[2:05:25] feebleness in many ways sometimes you
[2:05:27] say lord i don't think i can accept it
[2:05:29] just by faith right now he says well
[2:05:31] then call the elders of the church and
[2:05:33] have them lay their hands on you and the
[2:05:35] prayer of faith shall save
[2:05:37] the sick even he is so merciful and
[2:05:40] sometimes he'll give you multiple
[2:05:41] avenues
[2:05:42] to come by why because he's merciful to
[2:05:45] us
[2:05:46] but one thing that they all have in
[2:05:48] common is it'll come by the word
[2:05:50] so i appreciate that so if you have
[2:05:52] desire a prayer we'll pray for you
[2:05:55] why because that's the word of god
[2:05:57] but if you want to accept it right where
[2:05:59] he at you can do that too and you can go
[2:06:01] rejoicing why because he said he would
[2:06:03] fulfill it
[2:06:06] so however you decide
[2:06:08] and however the lord decides to fulfill
[2:06:10] it
[2:06:11] can we all agree on one thing let's all
[2:06:13] just accept it
[2:06:15] that we can agree on that
[2:06:17] no i don't know how and i don't know how
[2:06:19] it's going to happen but i accept it
[2:06:23] amen can we just let's just say that
[2:06:24] lord i accept it
[2:06:26] [Music]
[2:06:28] lord i accept what you have for me
[2:06:32] amen in whatever way you want to bring
[2:06:34] it
[2:06:36] amen to that i say amen to that
[2:06:39] that's the kind of thing that'll bring
[2:06:41] you a woman at the well experience
[2:06:44] she didn't know but she was willing to
[2:06:45] accept however it came
[2:06:48] and because of that she was able to save
[2:06:50] a whole city
[2:06:51] and said all they all came out and saw
[2:06:54] some some see a man who told me all the
[2:06:56] things i ever did amen
[2:06:59] so let's just we can go before the the
[2:07:01] lord and maybe sing a couple songs uh i
[2:07:04] guess brother i don't know brother jesse
[2:07:05] if you would like to come up you can i
[2:07:06] don't know how you like to do the
[2:07:08] service or uh we'll have brother jesse
[2:07:10] come up and and maybe just dismiss the
[2:07:12] service and then i know we'll have
[2:07:13] brother amen sing a few songs here in
[2:07:15] dismissal i know it's late i probably
[2:07:18] kept you way too long
[2:07:20] love the lord yeah you want to fatigue
[2:07:22] out too early
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:24] but you know maybe maybe that's just the
[2:07:26] type we're passing from time to eternity
[2:07:28] but we don't want to do it all in one
[2:07:30] night so we'll have a brother jesse come
[2:07:32] brother jesse i just want to say again i
[2:07:33] just i i've expressed it before i want
[2:07:35] to express it again i'm just humbled by
[2:07:37] the opportunity to come out
[2:07:38] you know
[2:07:39] i i love the people of god amen you know
[2:07:43] that's why i said what i said and i and
[2:07:44] i know you weren't in the room at the
[2:07:45] time but i know you heard it's not about
[2:07:47] puffing anybody up because it's not
[2:07:49] about sizes of churches
[2:07:51] god is not a respecter of persons
[2:07:55] god can touch you just as much here as
[2:07:57] you could at a camp meeting
[2:07:59] or at a huge thousand-person assembly of
[2:08:01] believers
[2:08:03] he can touch you right here
[2:08:04] why because he's the same yesterday
[2:08:06] today and forever he's the same god
[2:08:09] let's just get our expectation in line
[2:08:11] with what he wants to do
[2:08:13] amen brother jesse comes
[2:08:15] god bless you
[2:08:19] god bless you love you guys

[2:09:12] praise god let's make sure there's
[2:09:14] nothing in our hearts
