[0:17] part to play
[0:19] in our humble little lives here on this
[0:21] earth

[0:25] any time
[0:26] but thank god he gave us this life he
[0:29] showed us so much grace and so much love
[0:31] and he's just sort of showed us so much
[0:33] in the short little life that we have
[0:36] that it's worth just spending every
[0:37] moment every every time we have to be in
[0:39] the house of lord to worship god and
[0:41] sing his praises
[0:42] it's worth it because we get to be with
[0:45] him all throughout eternity
[0:47] whatever we have to sacrifice here
[0:49] whatever to miss out on what would seem
[0:50] like a missing out on

[8:23] of his word
[8:24] you may be seated praise god
[8:29] okay so we're going to try to pick up
[8:30] lord willing where we left off last week
[8:32] uh with uh the the challenges and
[8:35] blessings of transitioning into one body
[8:38] we'll look at that here i'm gonna i
[8:39] gotta skip ahead
[8:41] uh to where my place is here
[8:47] remember last week we were looking at
[8:49] all the challenges you know uh with
[8:51] circumcision and
[8:52] uh fellowshipping with people that maybe
[8:55] seem uh
[8:56] you know unclean to us right and uh
[9:00] as we uh as we think about our lives you
[9:02] know these some of these things don't
[9:03] affect us very much as far as like the
[9:05] jew and gentile it's more of the
[9:07] rich and poor right and the uh and the
[9:10] the nicely dressed and they're not
[9:11] so nicely dressed or people that take
[9:13] care of themselves and people that don't
[9:15] but it's still something we have to uh
[9:18] grow in as far as the love of god should
[9:20] be constantly growing in our hearts
[9:22] right and we should
[9:23] we should be tender hearted the bible
[9:24] says one toward another
[9:26] forgiving one another as christ forgave
[9:28] us and
[9:29] and so we're grateful that god has given
[9:31] us such a wonderful church you know and
[9:33] and people that we love and uh the
[9:35] saints of god that we we love to come
[9:37] and be with
[9:38] we should just fall more in love with
[9:39] each other as the years go by
[9:41] i found that to be true you know uh here
[9:44] at our church and then you know the
[9:45] saints that we fellowship with in
[9:47] different churches
[9:48] we just we love them more we look
[9:50] forward to them coming more
[9:51] praise god and i asked by us brother cam
[9:53] if he'd maybe come out in july for us so
[9:55] we're going to talk
[9:56] we'll be praying about that and i'm
[9:57] going to come out have some meetings i
[9:59] told brother brooks i was texting
[10:00] brother brooks today about coming out
[10:01] and him coming out i may have him come
[10:03] with brother randy i thought about that
[10:04] because
[10:05] they're a pretty good dude though they
[10:06] used to go to church together they're a
[10:08] really good team
[10:10] so i i may do that instead because i
[10:12] really i really like to have more
[10:13] services
[10:14] with brother cam's ministry there kind
[10:16] of feeling led to do that
[10:18] uh maybe i have three with him by god's
[10:20] grace but just kind of
[10:21] just praying and waiting on that so
[10:23] let's look at this uh
[10:24] thought here you know we saw how this
[10:26] impacts us we got to be very careful
[10:29] um our attitude towards others
[10:32] right we've all seen church splits right
[10:34] we've all seen uh
[10:36] uh church problems and people leave
[10:38] churches and many times it's because
[10:40] there's just a lack of love
[10:42] right people just don't have enough love
[10:43] for one another or their disfellowship
[10:46] with certain people
[10:47] instead of like making things right
[10:49] instead of trying to solve the problem
[10:51] they'll run away from the problem
[10:53] and that's a form of uh that's a form of
[10:56] fear right like we saw with peter he had
[10:58] fear
[10:58] he feared the jewish preacher so he
[11:00] didn't eat with the gentiles and
[11:02] so anytime fear is in a situation we've
[11:04] got to overcome that
[11:06] right because the holy spirit doesn't
[11:07] bring fear of man it brings fear of god
[11:10] right and i've always liked that saying
[11:13] i've always liked
[11:14] i fear god too much not to make things
[11:17] right with other people
[11:18] right i don't want to fear people and
[11:20] not witness to them and
[11:22] i i've been guilty of that right i've
[11:23] asked god to forgive me times when i
[11:24] didn't witness when i should have
[11:26] but what's always helped me is
[11:28] remembering i fear god more than i fear
[11:30] that person's reaction
[11:32] right and that's how it's attitude i
[11:34] want to have i want to fear god and
[11:36] with so much love for god that that
[11:38] motivates me
[11:39] to not fear the individual because this
[11:41] is not a flesh and blood affair praise
[11:43] god
[11:44] right we're wrestling against spiritual
[11:45] powers and wickedness in high places
[11:48] and if we just pray up right if we just
[11:49] listen to a sermon if we just
[11:51] sing a few songs then the fear of god
[11:53] will come upon us the love of god will
[11:54] come upon us and we won't be afraid of
[11:57] that person anymore
[11:59] right and so that's a great uh
[12:02] promise that we have now i want to look
[12:04] at some of the blessings here
[12:05] as they transition into one body first
[12:08] philippi i'm just going to briefly go
[12:11] over these and then we're going to get
[12:12] into some
[12:13] uh some timelines here uh for the jew
[12:15] gentile church
[12:17] uh remember philippi we preached on the
[12:19] book of philippians last year and into
[12:21] the beginning of this year
[12:23] it was paul's first european church that
[12:25] he started
[12:26] on his second missionary journey and
[12:28] this was probably his most
[12:29] warmest and most personal book right
[12:32] because in chapter one he thanked god
[12:34] every time he remembered this church oh
[12:36] thank god for the saints in akron right
[12:37] that's how we should
[12:38] thank god we have a church in akron
[12:40] right and he he was convinced that god
[12:42] would finish
[12:43] the good work that he started right and
[12:45] they had a place in paul's heart
[12:47] he eagerly longed to see them again he
[12:49] said i greatly long
[12:51] to see you their loyalty the philippian
[12:54] loyalty was above all the other churches
[12:56] at least to this point
[12:57] because he said all other churches have
[12:59] not ministered to my needs
[13:01] except your church what a what a
[13:04] testimony
[13:05] that uh of when when the prophet was
[13:07] getting forsaken and
[13:08] when the prophet's needs weren't being
[13:10] met one church stepped up
[13:11] and it was the philippian church one
[13:14] church stood with the prophet i want to
[13:15] be that church praise god
[13:17] i i believe there will be more than one
[13:19] church standing with god's prophet
[13:20] but i want to be a real church that
[13:22] stands for god's prophet
[13:24] praise god the word of god that he
[13:26] pointed us to
[13:28] and you know the other side i was
[13:30] looking at a few websites at branham
[13:31] tabernacle this week
[13:32] the other side did just keep going
[13:33] further and further like this week they
[13:35] had an article that said
[13:36] oh we're just willing to die for every
[13:38] word on the tape you imagine
[13:40] that hang their souls and they said
[13:42] we're willing to die for every word on
[13:44] the tape i'm like i'm not
[13:46] because not every word on the tape is
[13:48] thus saith the lord
[13:50] just just to think about saying things
[13:52] like that it's so far
[13:54] uh beyond of what uh uh a person with
[13:57] discernment should should say anyone
[14:00] with discernment would know a man's not
[14:02] infallible outside of christ
[14:04] christ is the only infallible man
[14:06] because if a man's infallible then he's
[14:08] perfect
[14:08] he's god he needs to be worshipped but
[14:10] that man is jesus
[14:12] that's one spot's taken is we're not
[14:14] reserved for anybody else praise god
[14:17] but just you know i'm so thankful to be
[14:18] on this side praise god
[14:20] we're really standing with god's prophet
[14:22] amen amen right we really
[14:24] are while others pretend to be or maybe
[14:27] think they are
[14:28] they're deceived into it but we're one
[14:30] of the few churches that are standing
[14:32] with the word of god amen
[14:34] we won't exalt brother brahm said you
[14:36] know brother man said
[14:37] the seventh church age messenger
[14:38] deserves no greater honor than john the
[14:40] baptist
[14:42] right he was a forerunner we thank god
[14:44] for the forerunner but his whole mission
[14:46] was to point us to christ
[14:47] amen that's what we are we're being
[14:50] pointed to christ amen
[14:52] we never forget god's forerunner we
[14:54] thank god for god's foreign but he had
[14:56] his part
[14:56] moses my servant is dead he said but now
[14:59] he said i'll be with you
[15:01] as i was with moses amen so see it but
[15:04] it's hard for people to hear that
[15:05] it's because they don't have faith and
[15:06] they're not born again
[15:08] praise god remember joshua had another
[15:11] spirit praise god that's what made him
[15:12] different amen
[15:14] him and caleb had a different spirit
[15:15] they were like those old fighters right
[15:17] there one to worship moses or
[15:19] or anything like that they had a their
[15:20] their their own spirit the holy spirit
[15:23] and they wanted to possess god's
[15:24] promises for their day
[15:26] i don't want to die and start a
[15:27] denomination in akron
[15:29] i want to be a living breathing organism
[15:32] amen
[15:32] the living breathing temple of god
[15:35] lively sown
[15:36] a living body praise god where christ
[15:38] dwells where's the
[15:40] tabernacle of the living god amen
[15:42] hallelujah i don't want to start a
[15:44] denomination and die
[15:45] i want to be a part of the living body
[15:46] of jesus christ amen
[15:48] so you can always speak his word to us
[15:50] and and
[15:51] and guide us here to the future as long
[15:54] as we'll be here
[15:55] to guide our steps give us vision for
[15:57] without a vision that people perish we
[15:59] don't want to perish
[16:00] we want to be rescued we want to be
[16:02] saved we want to be delivered
[16:03] we want to go in the meeting in the air
[16:05] in the rapture praise god
[16:07] we want to get married in the wedding
[16:08] praise god amen
[16:10] hallelujah
[16:13] but they were this was the loyal church
[16:15] the philippians
[16:17] they were stood the heretics right and
[16:19] the legalists
[16:20] in the last chapter paul says they're
[16:23] the only ones that met the need
[16:24] and he said you'll have a great heavenly
[16:27] reward
[16:28] for meeting the prophet's needs i like
[16:31] that
[16:32] now this thing about that that's the
[16:33] kind of relationship a jew preacher
[16:36] and gentiles that's what the body of
[16:39] christ does it makes
[16:40] such loyalty between different
[16:42] nationalities
[16:44] right different blood right different
[16:47] i'm sorry all one blood
[16:48] i mean different nations that's what i
[16:49] mean different nations
[16:51] can all be united because they're united
[16:54] by the spirit
[16:55] praise god not the flesh or not anything
[16:58] else
[16:59] they're united by the holy spirit praise
[17:01] god it's the holy spirit that brings
[17:03] unity amen
[17:05] that's what paul said a jew preaching a
[17:07] bunch of gentiles he said
[17:08] he said we're you're loyal and you've
[17:11] you've met my needs and god's gonna
[17:12] reward you
[17:13] my god shall supply all your needs
[17:16] hallelujah next was the thessalonians
[17:19] paul wrote two letters to them
[17:21] they had a deep emotional bond paul
[17:23] really loved these churches that
[17:24] god had him start he really even though
[17:27] this
[17:28] this stay was very short and lord
[17:30] willing i'd like to preach this in the
[17:31] future of the lord
[17:32] jerry's preacher the whole book this was
[17:34] also started during a second missionary
[17:36] trip
[17:38] paul thanked god because of their
[17:39] unceasing work of faith
[17:41] and labor of love despite persecutions
[17:45] he said he was like a gentle nurse i
[17:47] read that this morning actually it was
[17:48] in chapter two
[17:49] paul said we're like a nurse among you
[17:53] now could you imagine many message
[17:55] preachers like nurses
[17:56] brother william
[18:00] that's what paul says we were very
[18:01] careful how we behaved amongst you
[18:05] church can i help you anybody need any
[18:07] help today
[18:08] can i uh can i give you anything can i
[18:11] help you out you know how a nurse comes
[18:12] in and you're
[18:13] wanted to treat you nice you're in pain
[18:15] and you want a nurse to
[18:16] be real kind you don't want a nurse to
[18:18] ball you out while you're sick
[18:20] that no preacher sometimes have to do
[18:22] that by the holy spirit but but paul
[18:24] said we didn't when we came
[18:25] we worked for ourselves we supplied our
[18:28] own needs
[18:29] right and we were gently said like a
[18:31] nurse among you
[18:33] and you know how we behave so godly
[18:35] among you
[18:37] right he was and he had such a love for
[18:40] them he said i took nothing of yours
[18:42] but giving out love only he said
[18:46] no he even comforted them he said you
[18:49] know the in chapter 4 where he talked
[18:51] about the rapture
[18:52] he gave them the rapture because they
[18:54] were worried about their loved ones he
[18:55] told them about the rapture because of
[18:56] that
[18:57] he said don't fret he said let me give
[18:59] you some words of comfort
[19:00] they which are alive and remain the dead
[19:03] in christ he said to rise first your
[19:04] loved ones that have died
[19:06] they'll rise first praise god and the
[19:08] dead in christ will meet the living
[19:10] saints and you'll meet the lord in the
[19:11] air
[19:12] he said comfort one another with these
[19:14] words amen
[19:16] you'll see your loved ones again you'll
[19:17] see those message believers that are
[19:19] passed on
[19:19] you'll see them again praise god we'll
[19:21] see samson day again amen
[19:24] we'll see these saints that have died
[19:25] and gone on if the lord willing we'll
[19:28] see them alive
[19:29] by god's grace before the rapture if not
[19:31] we'll definitely see him in the rapture
[19:33] praise god
[19:34] paul was trying to comfort them be
[19:36] encouraged the dead in christ will rise
[19:38] amen
[19:40] and he talked about the future meeting
[19:42] in the in the air praise god
[19:45] now the second letter he had to ball out
[19:47] lazy brother that didn't want to work
[19:48] right
[19:49] and he had to give correction and you
[19:51] had to correct them against the
[19:52] antichrist spirit
[19:54] that would try to come in the church but
[19:55] paul said i love this paul said
[19:57] my converts you are my heavenly crown
[20:00] you're my glory
[20:02] and joy praise god so see how
[20:05] how this love between a gen a jew a jew
[20:08] preacher
[20:09] the gentiles before they were despised
[20:11] but now you're my crown
[20:13] before you were dirty and filthy and i
[20:16] don't want nothing new with you but now
[20:18] your your life for jesus christ that's
[20:20] my joy
[20:22] before you were my thing i hated you
[20:24] know
[20:25] but now you're my joy that's what the
[20:27] love of jesus does amen
[20:29] and make an enemy your best friend i
[20:32] didn't hear
[20:32] your enemies become your family praise
[20:34] god that's a great testimony
[20:37] to what jesus christ did when he broke
[20:39] down that middle wall
[20:40] partition or part partition praise god
[20:43] and made one body
[20:44] one church one temple praise god by the
[20:47] power of the holy ghost now
[20:49] let's go to acts 20 i want to read this
[20:50] because this is this is one of the most
[20:52] touching
[20:53] scriptures i think in the new testament
[20:56] of course outside of christ
[20:57] maybe i'll just say it one of the most
[20:58] touching in paul's life because that'd
[21:00] be a better way to say it
[21:03] because nothing could be more suitable
[21:05] than jesus christ nothing could be more
[21:06] lovable
[21:07] or memorable than the lord jesus but i
[21:10] would say
[21:10] one of the most touching scenes is acts
[21:12] chapter 20.
[21:14] now i don't know if you knew this but
[21:15] paul's longest missionary stay in any
[21:18] location was ephesus
[21:21] that's why i think he wrote such a
[21:22] masterful letter of the ephesians the
[21:23] book of ephesians
[21:25] where he talks about you were before the
[21:26] foundation of the world chosen in christ
[21:29] all spiritual blessings and marriage and
[21:31] divorce and
[21:32] the armor of god and everything and oh
[21:34] my
[21:35] such a powerful letter uh
[21:39] but this was his longest day three years
[21:42] according to acts 20 verse 31
[21:46] yeah that's right verse 31 says that
[21:50] three years and notice the whole time he
[21:52] was teaching them but also warning them
[21:54] that wolves would come in
[21:56] not sparing the flock and you know the
[21:57] history ephesus
[21:59] the whole church with uh the history
[22:01] says jesus said i'm gonna take the
[22:02] candlestick out of the church if they
[22:03] didn't repent well they didn't repent
[22:05] so the church of ephesus was gone by i
[22:07] think like 110 a.d or something like
[22:09] that
[22:09] it was totally gone so paul was right
[22:12] under the holy spirit to warn them for
[22:14] three years
[22:16] uh remember it was through paul's
[22:18] ministry 12 of them
[22:19] initially got the baptism of the holy
[22:21] ghost this was a church paul
[22:23] it's like paul birthed them as little
[22:25] babies
[22:26] right well it's like paul had 12 little
[22:28] babies there
[22:30] apollos was out of town he prayed for
[22:31] them they only knew john's baptism
[22:33] 12 little babies born in the kingdom of
[22:35] god he stayed there for three years
[22:37] training them up teaching them up he
[22:39] said i've given you
[22:40] the whole counsel of god right so we
[22:44] have a scriptural
[22:45] uh principle that you can teach the
[22:47] whole council of god within three years
[22:49] right at least that means you know the
[22:52] antichrist mark of the beast seal of god
[22:55] uh the church ages you could preach all
[22:56] of it at least within three years
[22:57] probably sooner
[22:59] if you really if you preach all night
[23:00] like paul did i remember paul to preach
[23:02] all night sometimes
[23:04] people fall out of the upper floors and
[23:06] everything
[23:08] but notice his fair rep farewell starts
[23:10] in verse 17.
[23:11] this is a very touching and emotional
[23:14] scene i just want to read this here
[23:16] this is the kind of a bond that the holy
[23:18] ghost gives us
[23:20] and from melitus he sent to ephesus and
[23:22] called the elders of the church
[23:23] and whether come to him he sent them you
[23:24] know from the first day that i came into
[23:26] asia after what manner i have been with
[23:27] you at all seasons you see
[23:29] there are seasons of life you see within
[23:32] three years you can go through numerous
[23:34] seasons of life
[23:35] so no doubt they saw paul when he had a
[23:37] lot of things they probably saw paul
[23:39] like the philippians when he didn't have
[23:40] much
[23:41] they probably saw him when he was on
[23:43] cloud nine fired up all the time they
[23:45] probably saw when he was battling things
[23:47] right because he said i do
[23:48] sometimes i do sins i shouldn't do right
[23:50] paul said i do that
[23:52] i'm sorry the things that i hate those
[23:53] things i do so in all seasons of life
[23:56] they've been around him for three years
[23:58] and they could see the highs and lows of
[24:00] his life so some of you
[24:01] i've seen some of the highs of your life
[24:03] i've also seen some of the lows of your
[24:05] life
[24:06] you've probably seen some of the highs
[24:07] in my life some of the lows in my life
[24:09] times i was really discouraged or time i
[24:11] was really going through tough times
[24:14] right but through it all we've sucked
[24:16] together
[24:17] praise god through it all because we're
[24:19] all glued together by one thing that's
[24:22] god's love amen
[24:24] the bond of perfectness amen love amen
[24:27] we are we can't help it we're glued
[24:29] together we got the love of jesus amen
[24:32] hallelujah so he was there three years
[24:38] he said now in verse 19 serving the lord
[24:39] with all humility
[24:41] of mine and with many tears and
[24:42] temptations which
[24:44] befell me by lying in weight of the jew
[24:46] yeah i love it when people cry here
[24:48] i love it when we get to share some of
[24:49] those touching times together
[24:52] or you're shouting or you're so i love
[24:54] that come to church when you're sad we
[24:55] can pray together we'll cry together
[24:58] we're your real family anyway praise god
[24:59] right by the blood of jesus christ
[25:02] you know so they experienced the highs
[25:04] and lows of life within three years
[25:07] tears temptations trials
[25:11] now look at that lying away to the jews
[25:13] people are lying waiting around waiting
[25:14] to jump out and devour us
[25:17] yet we stood together praise god when
[25:19] the enemy tried to come in we just stuck
[25:21] that much more closer together
[25:24] people were lying in wait trying to take
[25:26] the liberty from our church or the joy
[25:28] from our church
[25:29] yet we stood together praise god
[25:32] people tried to discourage us or bring
[25:34] false doctrine in we just stood that
[25:36] much more closely together
[25:37] like a united family praise god he said
[25:40] this is what we've done we've stuck
[25:42] together
[25:43] verse 20 and how i kept back nothing
[25:45] that was profitable unto you
[25:46] but have shown you and taught you
[25:48] publicly and from house to house
[25:53] now of course you know in those days
[25:54] they didn't have big churches right so
[25:56] they had to have services from house to
[25:58] house
[25:58] right we're thankful we have a little
[26:00] house or a little place here we can come
[26:01] together
[26:03] but he didn't keep back anything church
[26:06] and i tried to do the same thing i've
[26:08] not kept back anything from this church
[26:10] that i think would help them the thing
[26:11] that i think is going to help you the
[26:12] most is be born again
[26:15] because if you got if you get born again
[26:17] then you've got christ in you praise god
[26:20] i've got christ in me then we've all got
[26:22] christ praise god amen that's the most
[26:24] important thing we can give you praise
[26:26] god
[26:27] but not for me like if there's something
[26:29] i could preach on that would help you
[26:30] let me know we'll do another questions
[26:32] and answers
[26:33] sir series and we can do that it's been
[26:34] a couple years since we've done that
[26:36] i'd be happy to any question about the
[26:38] message i'll be happy to answer any
[26:40] questions
[26:40] i may not put it on the live stream you
[26:42] know because some people some questions
[26:44] are kind of personal
[26:45] when i tell personal stories i cut off
[26:47] the live stream but i'm trying not to
[26:49] get back anything
[26:50] that's profitable for the people because
[26:53] i want them to know the truth about
[26:55] god's word
[26:57] verse 21 testifying both to the jews and
[26:59] also the greeks repentance toward god
[27:00] now this is
[27:01] see the main thing is repent right have
[27:04] faith toward
[27:04] our lord jesus christ that's the trouble
[27:06] a lot of people go down the water
[27:08] a sinner they come up out of the water a
[27:10] sinner right paul
[27:11] look at this paul recognizes the main
[27:13] problem here is people don't repent
[27:15] praise god
[27:16] right they go through the motions they
[27:18] go through water baptism but they don't
[27:20] really repent all the way that's what we
[27:21] got to make sure we repent of
[27:23] all things that remember we have
[27:25] evil we make up for our sins and we
[27:28] change our mind about our sinful lives
[27:30] praise god
[27:31] we've got to be fully convinced brother
[27:33] ram says when you're convinced and
[27:34] you're concerned amen
[27:36] i think but you've got to be convinced
[27:38] right like that story i was telling you
[27:39] some you know sisters have left our
[27:41] church and they always kept pants in
[27:42] their closet well
[27:43] they weren't convinced it was
[27:44] cross-dressing they weren't convinced it
[27:46] was abomination
[27:48] because if i was convinced something was
[27:49] abomination i'd get it out of my house
[27:52] because i don't want curses in my house
[27:53] right if you're convinced
[27:56] i'm sure then you'll be concerned praise
[27:58] god
[27:59] and paul says i taught you to repent
[28:01] i've taught you to love the lord jesus
[28:03] have faith
[28:04] in jesus amen have faith that he's with
[28:07] you
[28:07] have faith that he's for you that faith
[28:09] that he'll provide all your needs if you
[28:11] forsake the world
[28:12] he won't forsake you praise god
[28:16] verse 22 and now behold i go bound
[28:19] in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing
[28:21] the things that shall befall me there
[28:25] remember the holy spirit when the holy
[28:27] spirit first called paul
[28:28] remember what do you tell ananias he
[28:30] said he told ananias he said
[28:34] i am going to i am going to use paul as
[28:36] a light to the gentiles
[28:37] and i'm going to show him how much
[28:39] things he must suffer
[28:42] for my name's sake how'd you like that
[28:44] if
[28:45] that was your calling gotta suffer a lot
[28:49] how many of us would say oh sign me up
[28:50] brother but paul
[28:52] he did because remember he was there the
[28:53] bible said he consented unto
[28:55] unto numerous deaths not just stephen i
[28:57] read that a few weeks ago i was shocked
[28:59] i'm like oh i forgot about that
[29:01] he consented to numerous christians
[29:03] dying
[29:04] and so when christ called him he had
[29:06] mercy forgave his sins the bible said
[29:08] they washed away his sins
[29:09] when his water baptism got jesus washed
[29:11] away his sins
[29:12] that he was willing to suffer because he
[29:14] knew how he'd hurt the church of christ
[29:16] so much
[29:17] right he knew how he kicked against the
[29:19] pricks remember that he said
[29:20] like the goad he knew he kicked against
[29:23] that he'd hurt the body of christ right
[29:24] he was trying to hurt them
[29:26] so he was willing to suffer because of
[29:28] how much suffering he calls the church
[29:29] of god
[29:31] why what is what a servant paul was
[29:35] he says i'm so i'm going bound in the
[29:37] spirit to jerusalem
[29:39] verse 23 say that the holy ghost
[29:40] witnessed in every city
[29:42] saying that bonds and afflictions abide
[29:44] look at that every city he visited the
[29:46] holy spirit said you got to go and
[29:47] suffer got to go and suffer
[29:49] talk about a talk about a meeting that
[29:52] would have been
[29:53] right preaching and worshiping the god
[29:54] all of a sudden a
[29:56] tongue's interpretation break out they
[29:58] wouldn't wait they wait for the
[29:59] interpretation
[30:00] it's thus saith the lord my servant paul
[30:02] you're going to suffer in rome
[30:04] thus saith the lord you think everybody
[30:06] would clap after that
[30:09] do you think they would clap i don't
[30:12] think so
[30:12] i think they probably started crying
[30:14] wouldn't you
[30:16] if you knew that was coming for you you
[30:18] probably started crying
[30:20] that's how it was for paul every city
[30:23] you visited
[30:24] the holy spirit was saying you've got to
[30:25] suffer you've got to suffer now watch
[30:27] how the sermons come across
[30:29] now this is a season where god has
[30:30] blessed us right we didn't suffer during
[30:32] coven can you say amen today
[30:34] we really didn't suffer we've had a lot
[30:36] of blessings during copenhagen
[30:38] i was telling the church and you know
[30:39] deploying all the blessings we've had
[30:41] we had blessing after blessing after
[30:43] blessing they just come upon us they've
[30:45] just been rolling out to us
[30:46] i thank the lord for that praise god
[30:50] but watch the word watch the word of the
[30:52] holy spirit as it comes
[30:54] you'll see it come in the times and
[30:55] seasons the word is coming forth
[30:58] it'll feed the flock of god but also
[31:00] prepare us for things to come that's
[31:04] what it did for paul the word prepared
[31:05] him
[31:06] for the things to come
[31:09] look at this he says in verse 24 but
[31:10] none of these things move me neither
[31:12] count i my life
[31:13] dear unto myself so that i might finish
[31:15] my course with joy yet he's going to
[31:17] suffer
[31:19] he's going to have joy despite knowing
[31:21] he's going to rome to suffer
[31:23] he's going to choose joy instead of
[31:25] depression oh the church said
[31:27] god help us to do that let's choose joy
[31:30] in the midst of trials praise god
[31:32] i'm going to finish my course with joy i
[31:34] know i'm going to suffer and be a martyr
[31:36] give my life for christ but i'm going to
[31:38] choose to do it with joy
[31:40] that's a real servant so okay
[31:44] and the ministry which i have received
[31:46] of the lord jesus
[31:47] to testify the gospel of the grace of
[31:49] god
[31:51] and now behold i know that ye all among
[31:53] whom i have gone preaching the kingdom
[31:55] of god
[31:56] shall see my face no more
[32:01] now look at this he knows this is the
[32:03] last time i'm going to be with you
[32:04] imagine having a saint like that a
[32:06] prophet who saw visions
[32:08] oh my goodness he'd be breaking in and
[32:10] out of visions and tell you thus saith
[32:12] the lord
[32:12] you had you had him for three years but
[32:14] then he says this is the last time
[32:15] you're gonna see my face on this earth
[32:18] now remember these are previously dirty
[32:20] people but now the blood of christ has
[32:22] made them one
[32:25] oh such a beautiful story wherefore i
[32:27] take you to record this day
[32:29] that i am pure from the blood of all men
[32:31] why for i have not shunned to declare
[32:33] unto you
[32:34] all the counsel of god that's that's i
[32:36] want to preach myself right
[32:38] that's how brother adam preached he
[32:39] declared the whole council of god he
[32:41] blasted denomination
[32:42] you know worldliness he just laid it all
[32:44] out there right
[32:45] he just blasted everything that was sin
[32:47] and raised our faith on all the things
[32:49] that were right praise god
[32:52] just preach the whole council of god let
[32:54] ever let as we say
[32:55] let the chips fall where that where they
[32:57] may praise god that whoever wants to go
[32:59] go
[32:59] all those who want to stay let them stay
[33:01] just preach the word
[33:03] he said preach the word in season in
[33:05] season out of season he said
[33:07] he said rebuke comfort uh
[33:10] uh just just preach the whole counsel of
[33:12] god i'm kind of forget what he said to
[33:13] timothy there but
[33:14] you understand what he's saying he said
[33:16] fight the good fight of faith praise god
[33:17] lay a hold
[33:18] on eternal life amen hallelujah
[33:24] now does that make sense if the holy
[33:25] spirit said you got to go suffer got to
[33:27] go suffer
[33:28] you're not going to get more popular
[33:29] you're going to get more rejected
[33:30] wouldn't that make sense if we would be
[33:32] a small church
[33:33] and god would keep us small would that
[33:35] wouldn't that fit the pattern
[33:37] right god god god's not letting us get
[33:39] prideful he's keeping us humble
[33:42] wouldn't that fit the same pattern a
[33:44] harder way
[33:45] compared to an easier way i just found a
[33:48] quote today where brother
[33:49] said that he said he's talking about
[33:51] abraham and lot and how lot
[33:53] chose the easy way abraham let lot have
[33:56] the choice and then he took the harder
[33:57] way
[33:58] and brother adam said see god's not
[33:59] always on the easy road
[34:01] he says sometimes you find him on the
[34:02] hard road
[34:06] but lot went to the easy road where to
[34:07] lead him to a very a very awful end
[34:09] for his family right so it's not always
[34:12] in the easy road
[34:14] there may be times we have easy roads
[34:16] but here paul
[34:18] saying you won't see me no more i've
[34:20] declared the whole council of god now
[34:21] verse 28
[34:22] what would be your last words if you're
[34:24] gonna leave somebody
[34:26] what would that what what would be a
[34:28] preacher's fitting last words we got
[34:30] them right here
[34:31] oh i'm glad to see him what would a holy
[34:34] ghost anoint the prophet of god say
[34:37] the first church age messenger what
[34:38] would he say in his last words well we
[34:40] got him right here
[34:41] oh i love that don't you sometimes i
[34:43] just like to cuddle up to that don't you
[34:45] it's just oh wow we we know what he
[34:47] would say
[34:49] if he could give us any last words we
[34:50] know what brother brown would say
[34:52] if he could give us some last words if
[34:53] we could break behind that curtain of
[34:55] time
[34:56] we know what he'd say praise god
[34:59] amen like he heard keep pressing
[35:02] keep pressing uh it was not much longer
[35:04] to go praise god
[35:06] the victory's right ahead amen don't get
[35:08] weary
[35:09] keep pressing forward toward the mark of
[35:10] the high calling forget those things in
[35:12] the past
[35:13] press forward to the high calling of god
[35:15] in christ jesus
[35:17] don't quit don't give up don't be
[35:18] fearful do
[35:20] uh uh do do not to despise the trials
[35:23] approach them with joy praise god run
[35:26] your course finish your course with joy
[35:28] hallelujah
[35:30] here's these last words verse 28 take ye
[35:34] therefore unto yourselves
[35:35] so don't get loose take heed to
[35:38] yourselves
[35:41] and to all the flock of god see we have
[35:43] to care about the whole church
[35:45] we should be interested in everybody in
[35:47] the church to try to care for them the
[35:49] best we can
[35:50] we got to look at each other like we're
[35:51] a little sheep right
[35:54] and we've got to take care of course
[35:55] he's talking to the preachers here but
[35:56] you understand
[35:57] everybody should care for everybody
[35:58] right to all the flock
[36:01] over which the holy ghost have made you
[36:03] overseers
[36:04] to feed the church of god
[36:08] what is it what are the last words build
[36:10] a big church
[36:11] right that might be fine sometimes
[36:14] make sure everybody you know has you
[36:16] know whatever they need i mean that's of
[36:18] course important you know we must
[36:20] remember the poor
[36:20] but he says these last words he said
[36:23] feed the flock of god
[36:24] feed them what the word of god but i
[36:28] thought you already preached the whole
[36:29] council of god
[36:29] well the holy ghost is going to guide us
[36:31] into more truth
[36:33] right you got the main principles i
[36:34] preach the main counsel of god
[36:36] but we still need more feeding on those
[36:39] same things to go deeper in the things
[36:41] of god amen
[36:42] the bible says the holy spirit searches
[36:44] the deep things yay the deep things of
[36:46] god amen
[36:47] hallelujah the holy spirit always wants
[36:49] to take us a little deeper praise god
[36:54] thank the lord
[36:58] i like this look which he made you
[36:59] overseers see that's all i am
[37:01] as a preacher i'm an overseer i'm just
[37:03] trying to oversee just watch the flock
[37:05] and
[37:05] the bible said warn them and watch for
[37:07] their souls
[37:08] so what's the soul the soul is the
[37:10] nature right so i have to make sure your
[37:12] nature
[37:13] your soul is pointed toward christ
[37:16] right and you have a soul thirst my main
[37:18] desire is to make sure you're
[37:20] you're you're you're satisfying that
[37:22] holy thirst with the holy word of god
[37:25] which means come to church hear the word
[37:28] that's my main thing to make sure
[37:29] invite people back to church please come
[37:31] to church make sure in the house of god
[37:33] because i'm watching over your soul
[37:36] right judgment begins where
[37:37] at the house of god praise god your soul
[37:40] is going to be judged right or wrong
[37:42] based upon how you act and how you
[37:43] respond to the word of god
[37:45] what you're being fed in the house of
[37:47] god oh we should
[37:48] we should be thankful if we're still in
[37:50] the house of god being cleaned out by
[37:52] the holy spirit
[37:52] being fed on the good food of god's word
[37:55] amen
[37:56] those without the bible says scarcely
[37:58] will anyone be saved outside the house
[38:00] of god
[38:03] what amen warning from the holy spirit
[38:06] last words
[38:09] his last words are take heed to yourself
[38:12] all the church
[38:13] feed the church of god feed them with
[38:16] what milk well to the ones that need
[38:18] milk remember we looked at that a few
[38:19] weeks ago
[38:19] some of them need milk you know laying
[38:22] on of hands eternal judgment
[38:23] the baptisms right hebrews chapter six
[38:26] some people need that
[38:27] he said but the real me is judging
[38:30] between good and evil
[38:32] so on a weekly basis presenting uh
[38:35] questions and presenting doctrines and
[38:38] and looking at
[38:39] uh looking at topics where we have to
[38:41] discern in our current lives
[38:43] are we judging things as good or evil
[38:45] right now
[38:46] that's the real meat of god's word see
[38:49] just preaching god sent a prophet god
[38:51] sent a prophet that's not meat anymore
[38:52] because we already know god sent a
[38:54] prophet
[38:55] that might have been meat in one day but
[38:57] we proved it to you by acts 3
[38:59] 21 by malachi 4 5 and 6 matthew 17
[39:03] 11. right we proved it that's proof
[39:07] you you can judge that now you know but
[39:09] now it's time to move on and make sure
[39:11] we're keeping all the sin out of our
[39:12] lives now praise god
[39:15] that was needful for a season now that's
[39:16] going to be needful for mj i'm going to
[39:18] have to revisit i did revisit that a
[39:19] little bit
[39:20] i may go further on that as uh the lord
[39:22] would lead me
[39:24] but see we need the me of god's word is
[39:28] in our daily lives now
[39:30] to discern good and evil is this the
[39:33] right step
[39:34] or is this the wrong step that's why i
[39:36] see that's why you should come to the
[39:37] that's why we should come to church and
[39:39] just be hungry for the word lord speak
[39:40] to me today
[39:41] i've got this question i've got that
[39:43] question speak to me today that i can
[39:44] stay
[39:45] pure with the word of god that i'll i'll
[39:47] judge things the right way
[39:49] i'll judge this situation my family the
[39:51] right way i'll judge this situation the
[39:53] church the right way
[39:54] i'll judge this thing in my personal
[39:55] life i'll judge it the right way i won't
[39:57] let evil in
[39:58] but i'll overcome evil with good amen
[40:01] hallelujah we know god sent a prophet
[40:05] thank god for that
[40:07] we thank the lord for all the blessings
[40:10] but we need meat and he said feed the
[40:11] church of god
[40:13] with meat praise the lord amen
[40:17] now go to verse now here it is 29.
[40:25] i'm gonna look something up real quick
[40:35] 29 for i know this that after my
[40:36] departing shall grievous wolves enter in
[40:38] among you
[40:39] not sparing the flock so you better
[40:42] watch over them because wolves are going
[40:43] to come in
[40:45] right and they won't spare the flock
[40:47] they'll go right after the church
[40:50] see how wolves will do that many times
[40:52] they'll try to get to the preachers
[40:53] because they
[40:53] if they can get to the preacher then
[40:54] that would defile the whole congregation
[40:56] but in this case he said they're coming
[40:58] after everybody
[40:59] the flock as well
[41:03] i thank god when just someone with a
[41:04] false doctrine like we talked about on
[41:06] sunday
[41:07] a brother we had a false doctrine i
[41:08] thank god he didn't come in to get
[41:10] anybody else
[41:10] he tried to get some of us on texts he
[41:13] tried to get the flack on texts
[41:15] but i thank god that the lord just
[41:16] allowed him to come to me when we talked
[41:17] about it
[41:19] because that kind of kept all of you out
[41:20] of it right i thank the lord for that
[41:24] because would you like somebody texting
[41:25] you all the time and say oh you need
[41:27] this is fault you're
[41:28] you're preaching false doctrine oh your
[41:30] church does that make you feel good or
[41:32] bad when people do that
[41:33] bad oh you're there's no way you're born
[41:36] again and you're failing in this or that
[41:38] you like getting texts like that
[41:39] that's a wolf that's a wolf trying to
[41:41] take your joy
[41:43] right that's a wolf trying to uh
[41:46] devour your spiritual life and make you
[41:48] nervous and put a spirit of fear on you
[41:50] just cast that wolf down in jesus
[41:51] christ's name amen
[41:54] just rebuke him fight him off with the
[41:55] sword of the word of god amen
[41:57] say there's no condemnation to me i'm in
[41:59] christ jesus amen
[42:01] and who are you to judge me hallelujah
[42:05] now look verse 30 also of your own
[42:09] selves shall men arise speaking perverse
[42:11] things
[42:12] to draw away disciples after them see
[42:14] why did preachers do that many times
[42:16] brother william's probably seen it a
[42:17] preacher will get this false doctrine
[42:19] and he'll draw he'll split the church
[42:21] right and try to draw people after his
[42:24] to make him the pastor right usually
[42:26] usually it's money based
[42:29] usually they're after the ties every
[42:31] time so preacher's got to be careful who
[42:33] invites to the pulpit right
[42:35] uh but also watch the watch the parking
[42:38] lot preachers too
[42:40] we haven't had many of those thank god
[42:41] by god's grace
[42:43] but see they want to they want to draw
[42:45] people away after themselves
[42:48] with perverse preach with perverse
[42:50] doctrines
[42:52] verse 31 and therefore watch and
[42:54] remember that by the space of
[42:56] three years i cease not to warn everyone
[42:58] night and day with tears
[43:02] and now brethren i commend you to god so
[43:05] i'm committing you to god i'm i'm
[43:07] uh i'm not gonna be able to watch over
[43:08] you so i'm gonna have god i'm ask god to
[43:10] watch over you
[43:12] right i'm sure parents when parents when
[43:15] when their adult children leave the
[43:16] house
[43:16] you got to commit them to god right
[43:18] brother we're not there yet so let's
[43:19] hang around a few more years
[43:22] many more we'll see what the lord does
[43:26] but see at some point paul says i've got
[43:28] to commit you to god because i can't be
[43:29] here anymore
[43:31] i'm placing you in god's hands now let
[43:33] me tell you there's no better hands than
[43:34] those
[43:36] those nail scarred heads oh they just
[43:39] got a way of providing everything we
[43:41] ever need of amen
[43:42] hallelujah they just got a way to do it
[43:45] it's about those special hands those
[43:47] nails scarred him they just care so much
[43:49] praise god they're so strong amen
[43:51] so faithful praise god so big amen
[43:54] those wonderful powerful hands of christ
[43:56] jesus
[44:00] he says i commend you to god and to the
[44:02] word of his grace i'm committing you to
[44:04] the word of grace
[44:05] these are gentiles which is able to
[44:08] build you up so
[44:08] the prophet's going to leave but you can
[44:11] you can still get bigger hey
[44:13] you can still be stronger even though
[44:14] the prophet's going to physically leave
[44:16] you
[44:16] oh can we see it tonight church we can
[44:19] still grow stronger we can be built up
[44:22] because the holy ghost is here amen the
[44:24] prophet might not be here
[44:26] but the word of grace is able to build
[44:28] us up amen
[44:29] hallelujah we don't have to be afraid we
[44:31] have to be discouraged
[44:33] god knows how to build up his church
[44:35] amen
[44:36] he knows how to feed the flock of god if
[44:38] the people come
[44:39] hungry and thirsty they'll receive from
[44:41] christ amen
[44:43] that's beautiful i didn't even see that
[44:47] huh you're able to be built up when
[44:48] there's no profit yeah you can still do
[44:50] that
[44:51] because the holy ghost will never
[44:52] forsake his people
[44:54] right he'll lead his sheep to green uh
[44:56] pastures and still
[44:58] waters like we had a cat our cat was
[45:00] stuck in the
[45:01] up in the tree the last week right this
[45:04] is kind of a silly story
[45:05] but they finally got the cat down in
[45:08] case you helped get the cat down
[45:09] and you know you know the first thing he
[45:11] did after two to two nights in the tree
[45:13] he running eight grass i just thought
[45:16] that's so
[45:17] that's so weird you'd be up in a tree
[45:19] two days you haven't eaten nothing
[45:20] the first thing you do is go eat grass i
[45:22] thought that reminded me of a little
[45:23] lamb
[45:25] what's the first thing you go feast on
[45:27] the good grass of god
[45:30] yo you're all alone you're all isolated
[45:32] the devil's got you up in a tree
[45:34] what's the first thing you do when you
[45:35] get down have a nice meal right
[45:38] a nice green healthy meal that's what
[45:40] the cat did
[45:41] right and so here paul says feed them uh
[45:44] and they'll be able to be
[45:45] built up and overcome these wolves if
[45:48] you just feed these sheep
[45:49] the preachers will protect you you'll be
[45:51] strong enough you'll be able to overcome
[45:53] these wolves
[45:54] you'll be more than conquerors sheep
[45:56] that are more than conquerors
[45:57] sheep that defeat the wolves amen
[45:59] because the great shepherd's on your
[46:01] side
[46:03] hallelujah just feed just feast right
[46:05] satan wants you not to feast on the word
[46:07] he wants you to get skinny and weak
[46:08] right i didn't enjoy that sermon nothing
[46:10] in that sermon well you didn't pull hard
[46:12] enough
[46:13] you really if you really want something
[46:14] you say amen you poor you get focused
[46:17] you get spiritually minded praise god
[46:19] and god will pour out blessings upon us
[46:21] amen
[46:22] but the people got a poll too right they
[46:24] have to have faith faith comes by
[46:26] hearing hearing by the word of god
[46:28] amen
[46:31] he said the word of grace was able to
[46:33] build you up finishing verse 32 and to
[46:35] give you inheritance among all them
[46:37] which are sanctified hallelujah
[46:41] god is going to give you an inheritance
[46:43] among the sanctified ones the separated
[46:46] ones
[46:47] what a blessing look at verse 33
[46:50] i've covered in no man's silver or gold
[46:53] or apparel
[46:54] hey brother amen can i borrow 500 buddy
[46:57] okay
[46:58] but william can i borrow about 600 after
[47:00] church

[47:06] good
[47:06] can i borrow that that's a nice fleece
[47:08] brother can i borrow that
[47:10] man see a real man of god doesn't behave
[47:13] himself like that
[47:15] he's not interested in the outward he's
[47:17] not interested in the natural
[47:18] he's interested in the soul
[47:21] make sure that soul is fed the word of
[47:23] god
[47:24] praise god and i've covered in no man's
[47:27] silver gold or apparel
[47:30] hallelujah i said i love this because it
[47:32] reminds me of myself
[47:33] i gotta i gotta be faithful to my
[47:34] ministry praise god yay verse 34 ye
[47:37] yourselves know that these hands have
[47:39] ministered under my necessities
[47:40] and to them that were with me
[47:44] well church can you give take up a
[47:46] little extra offering to feed my family
[47:48] have i ever
[47:49] ever done that in 15 years of preaching
[47:51] i never did that
[47:52] my hands are ministered to my own needs
[47:55] well i appreciate the lord for that
[47:58] verse 35
[47:59] i've showed you all things how that so
[48:01] laboring you ought to support
[48:03] the weak so we work hard
[48:07] to help out those who are weak among us
[48:11] that's why i tell them about the amen on
[48:12] sunday i said i don't you guys remember
[48:14] when i used some of my ties a few years
[48:15] ago to buy brother austin a car a used
[48:17] car it was a really
[48:18] old car and i got some i got people
[48:20] criticizing me for that
[48:22] but i'm like it's my money i can do
[48:24] whatever i want with my money do i tell
[48:26] you how to spend your money
[48:28] right and then i thought about the book
[48:30] of acts in the book of acts they made
[48:32] sure everybody had it all the same
[48:34] well i could have a i and the brother i
[48:36] had to drive the brother to work
[48:38] i'd drive into the mall to go work at
[48:39] the shoe store for the austin
[48:41] after a while i just kind of got tired
[48:42] of him like can i find a cheap car
[48:44] around here
[48:45] can i and jose help me find it i mean it
[48:47] was all directed to the lord we were
[48:48] able to get the title fixed on one night
[48:50] it just worked out beautifully but i got
[48:51] criticized for that
[48:52] and i realized now i was just doing the
[48:54] book of acts job there
[48:57] just found something real cheap because
[48:59] everybody should have everything in
[49:00] common
[49:03] right now other people have tests over
[49:06] here we have different people come in
[49:07] they don't have a car i've given them a
[49:09] bus pass just to see if they'll come to
[49:10] church
[49:11] because i knew some of their family and
[49:12] friends wouldn't come to church no
[49:14] matter how much you give them
[49:16] you get my bus pass i gave them a 50 bus
[49:18] pass they come to church one time
[49:20] but that bus runs all seven days of the
[49:22] week
[49:23] so they miss sunday night miss wednesday
[49:25] night they come one time
[49:27] i gave them a 50 bus pass do you think
[49:28] they really want to come to church
[49:31] they don't want to come to church now
[49:33] that brother austin you come to you come
[49:34] faithfully you all saw it come
[49:35] faithfully so you have that little
[49:37] trouble there
[49:39] but you know i thought that was i get
[49:41] criticized for that
[49:43] but see i'm here as a shepherd i'm here
[49:45] to provide for the sheep
[49:48] and that brother we had met numerous
[49:50] prayer meetings where he was crying and
[49:51] remember god healed him he had uh
[49:53] he first come in to our message and he
[49:56] had a
[49:57] migraine a really bad migraine he said
[49:58] lord if you're real heal me god healed
[50:00] him that one night
[50:01] can you imagine that i've never had that
[50:03] where i was at a migraine and god healed
[50:05] me
[50:06] he said at that instant god healed him
[50:08] and he was very faithful for
[50:10] about a year there or so but see people
[50:13] are going to criticize you
[50:14] no matter what you do in fact the last
[50:17] the biggest critics of me
[50:18] over the years have been those that
[50:19] criticize me how i handle the money of
[50:21] the church
[50:24] and again they don't they have no
[50:26] business to tell me what to do with the
[50:27] money
[50:28] i'm just trying to help out god's sheep
[50:30] most of the ties
[50:32] allow you to have that chair you're
[50:33] sitting on right there but
[50:35] most of those ties allow you to have
[50:37] that air conditioning coming right
[50:38] through there right i don't need it
[50:40] i don't need all of it i'm happy to do
[50:43] that
[50:44] i just want god's sheep to feast on
[50:46] god's grass
[50:48] and drink god's water amen praise god i
[50:51] want their souls watched over amen
[50:54] so they're ready for the coming of the
[50:56] lord amen
[50:58] they're they they can they don't have to
[51:00] worry about those natural things they
[51:01] can watch and pray
[51:02] looking for the coming of christ jesus
[51:04] amen
[51:06] hallelujah that's okay but ram said
[51:09] jesus was a man who lived in another
[51:10] dimension brother william
[51:13] the one thing about him he knew how to
[51:14] live above all the criticism amen
[51:17] hallelujah god help us to live above all
[51:20] the critics and liars amen
[51:23] some of you get light on we talked about
[51:24] that i've been light on numerous times
[51:26] let them lie we'll live above it praise
[51:28] god that's all they can do that's their
[51:30] only
[51:30] argument that they have that's the only
[51:32] weapon they have is argument
[51:34] and lies in debate but we got greater
[51:36] weapons than that we've got the truth
[51:38] we've got the word
[51:39] we've got the power of god we've got the
[51:41] love of god we got christ amen
[51:44] we've got honesty sincerity we got
[51:46] purity things they know nothing about
[51:50] that's right so what would your last
[51:52] words be if you left the church and you
[51:53] had to move
[51:54] overseas he said feed the flock of god
[51:59] make sure those saints are feasting on
[52:01] the word of god
[52:03] because there's going to be there's
[52:04] going to be wolves come in and try to
[52:06] separate the flock
[52:08] he said watch and remember the warnings
[52:10] that i've given you
[52:13] he said in other words work for your own
[52:15] needs
[52:16] right don't be a beggar right verse 35
[52:20] i have showed you all things how that's
[52:22] so laboring you ought to support the
[52:24] weak and to remember the words
[52:25] of the lord jesus how he said it is more
[52:27] blessed
[52:28] to give than receive
[52:32] i told you how we had uh uh did i tell
[52:35] you how that company
[52:36] we had a company help us out in our
[52:37] kitchen upstairs i tell you that in
[52:38] january
[52:40] so this company gave us like a a huge
[52:42] discount just because
[52:44] and the the owner's a christian they did
[52:46] this construction for us at a
[52:48] huge discount and when i talked to him
[52:52] he said the lord told him
[52:55] to give our family that discount as love
[52:58] and brother there's no way i could have
[53:00] paid for this there's no way i could
[53:00] have paid for this maybe five or six ten
[53:02] years down the road i never could afford
[53:04] it because i don't make a lot of money
[53:06] and all the money i do make i got to pay
[53:07] the bills you know uh
[53:09] i mean we have everything we need we're
[53:11] very very thankful for everything
[53:12] but i never could afford this
[53:16] and the man said while he was doing our
[53:18] job in january at this reduced rate it
[53:21] was just labor
[53:22] he said god gave him five jobs
[53:25] five contracts plus the biggest contract
[53:28] they'd ever have
[53:29] and now they're so big we just talked to
[53:30] them last night now they're so big
[53:32] the the husband and wife are owners now
[53:34] they've hired
[53:36] they didn't have any employees like uh
[53:38] to do all the work for them now they
[53:39] have
[53:39] numerous employees now you know why
[53:42] because
[53:43] god loves a cheerful giver
[53:48] jesus said it's more blessed to give
[53:51] than receive
[53:54] hallelujah that's why i want to share
[53:56] that with you because just just a
[53:57] reminder
[53:58] god loves when you give cheerfully i'm
[54:00] not talking to the church i'm just
[54:01] talking about
[54:02] you give to people you give it up to the
[54:04] church we're gonna we're good at the
[54:05] church you know
[54:06] we're good but give to others that
[54:10] you may see need things right it's more
[54:13] blessed to give
[54:14] than receive so feed the flock stay with
[54:17] the word watch out for wolves
[54:19] make sure you give to people because god
[54:21] will bless you
[54:23] remember the last words when paul and
[54:25] and peter were there in jerusalem and
[54:27] james remember the last words
[54:29] some of the last words they said were
[54:30] remember the poor
[54:33] that were some of the last words in
[54:34] galatians 2 and then they left and
[54:36] parted
[54:37] what would be the last thing you'd say
[54:38] to a prophet of god don't forget to
[54:40] paint pray for the poor people
[54:41] make sure you give food to the poor
[54:43] people okay see you later
[54:46] like that would we would think it'd be
[54:47] some revelation like let me tell you
[54:49] about these
[54:50] different mysteries and let me tell you
[54:51] i saw this i saw this these seven
[54:53] thunders in the book of psalms you know
[54:55] which there are seven letters in the
[54:56] book of zombies that's still a mystery i
[54:58] don't know that mystery
[55:00] but you would think it'd be something
[55:01] deep like that there's seven thunders in
[55:03] the psalms there is
[55:05] and they said remember the to support
[55:07] the poor
[55:09] don't forget the poor now we need that
[55:11] thunders yeah we do
[55:12] but we can't forget to be like christ
[55:16] right who said blessed are the merciful
[55:19] for they shall
[55:20] obtain mercy blessed are the pure in
[55:23] heart
[55:24] that they shall see god i don't want to
[55:26] fall in the trap of message churches
[55:29] like i see a lot of them they just
[55:30] denominate they only care about
[55:32] themselves
[55:33] they're not interested in outreach or
[55:34] anything like that they just want to
[55:36] make themselves richer all the time
[55:37] they're not even looking for the coming
[55:38] of the lord
[55:39] i showed brother william that quote last
[55:40] week brother mann said if i had 100
[55:42] million dollars
[55:43] he said i would start a campaign to go
[55:45] around the country
[55:46] to get the bride ready for the rapture
[55:49] he would go out in evangelism
[55:50] if he had 100 million dollars he'd just
[55:52] go from city to city preach in the word
[55:54] let people come let people come
[55:56] get the people ready what gets the
[55:57] people ready feeding on the
[55:59] word get the people ready amen feeding
[56:02] the flock of god will get them ready for
[56:04] the rapture praise god
[56:06] amen i've always said that if i could
[56:07] retire i just want to travel around and
[56:09] preach everywhere
[56:10] trying to go to visit churches try to
[56:11] help them out can i help you out in any
[56:13] way brother you need me to preach of
[56:15] course most preachers won't like that
[56:17] you know
[56:17] but i would hope that somebody could
[56:19] sense the holy spirit on me that i want
[56:21] to do it for the right reasons
[56:22] to point them to the word of god
[56:26] okay so church that was the last word
[56:29] remember the words his last words were
[56:32] it's more blessed to give
[56:35] than receive now let's look how the jew
[56:39] and gentile let's see how they part
[56:41] their ways when he had thus spoken he
[56:45] kneeled down
[56:46] and prayed with them all huh like
[56:48] kneeled down
[56:50] remember i remember i had to kneel on
[56:51] sunday was that sunday morning or sunday
[56:53] night i had all the church kneel down
[56:54] i want to spend sunday morning cause i
[56:55] don't think you're here but you're
[56:56] singing that song about we
[56:57] about we bow down we lay our crowns
[57:00] every knee will about the name of jesus
[57:01] well when they left the last time they
[57:03] got they bowed down
[57:04] and they they got a group hug and cried
[57:07] and wept together read the next one
[57:10] and they all wept sore and fell upon
[57:12] paul's neck
[57:13] and kissed him sorry most of all for the
[57:17] words which he spake
[57:18] that they should see his face no more
[57:22] and they accompanied him under the ship
[57:24] imagine what it's like when the ships
[57:26] roll
[57:26] sailing away hi paul see all the tears
[57:30] rolling down
[57:31] thank you sir for three years of
[57:33] ministry we'll keep preaching the truth
[57:35] paul
[57:36] paul sailed away i imagine his last
[57:38] words preach the word
[57:40] be instant in season out of season
[57:42] rebuking exhorting it with all
[57:44] longsuffering and doctrine
[57:46] for time will come when they will not
[57:48] endure sound doctrine
[57:50] and they're all crying and weeping and
[57:51] praising the lord this jew and gentile
[57:53] used to be enemies
[57:55] but christ's love has united them so
[57:57] much
[57:58] he said i preached so i preached
[58:00] everything everything that i thought
[58:02] would profit you
[58:03] i preached you sometimes past midnight
[58:06] and i've never kept you guys past
[58:07] midnight i don't think i could do it
[58:09] myself actually
[58:11] before i pass out at the pulpit that's
[58:13] not the way i want to pass out
[58:16] but these are his la his last words were
[58:18] more blessed to give
[58:21] be a giver so simple
[58:25] don't be a taker be a giver be like
[58:29] christ
[58:30] be like your heavenly father who sends
[58:32] rain on the just
[58:34] and what would the prophet's last words
[58:36] be to us
[58:38] remember the words of the lord jesus
[58:40] it's more blessed to give
[58:42] than receive
[58:46] so here are the blessings of jew and
[58:48] gentile coming together
[58:50] brothers that hug each other and cries
[58:52] i'm going to miss you brother
[58:55] you weren't there they weren't going to
[58:56] see them again these are real tears
[58:59] brothers that would hug and weep and cry
[59:04] they want to have a hug fest they want
[59:07] to greet one another with a holy kiss
[59:11] so i've visited some churches lately and
[59:13] when i used to go they would kiss me on
[59:15] the neck and everything like that
[59:17] i didn't get that recently and both
[59:20] and some of these churches some of the
[59:21] churches i've visited they the pastors
[59:23] and preachers have told me
[59:24] they're really cold on god
[59:27] how do you know if someone's on fire
[59:29] they love one another
[59:32] they're more interested in giving than
[59:35] receiving
[59:38] i went to the one church recently and a
[59:40] little kid he was
[59:41] his name is derek he come he was the
[59:43] only one nobody else i
[59:45] want come walking the fellowship the
[59:46] only one that coming was this little kid
[59:48] this
[59:48] he's like the amen coroner kid you know
[59:51] he's around him he's like hey brother
[59:52] jesse
[59:53] and he about knocks me over like well
[59:55] thank you buddy thank you for that kind
[59:57] of love
[59:58] everybody else they're just kind of
[59:59] walking by hey brother hey bro
[1:00:01] they haven't seen me for a year or two
[1:00:03] hey brother how are you doing sir
[1:00:05] and they used to come up and kiss me on
[1:00:07] the neck
[1:00:09] now see and i was nervous too now i
[1:00:12] should have kissed them on the neck
[1:00:13] right i should have with someone
[1:00:14] full of love right i'm not criticizing
[1:00:17] other churches but you know what i'm
[1:00:18] saying
[1:00:18] we all we all go through seasons like
[1:00:20] paul said i've been with you in the good
[1:00:22] seasons
[1:00:23] i've been with you in the hard seasons
[1:00:25] but what keeps us together
[1:00:26] the love of god the love of god
[1:00:30] so prophet's last word would be that i'm
[1:00:32] gonna close here
[1:00:34] it's okay too because i don't uh the
[1:00:37] time limit's on this anyway like
[1:00:40] i can't i can't use it because i set a
[1:00:42] certain time limit he can't use it after
[1:00:43] a certain time
[1:00:46] i'm just kind of preaching off my my
[1:00:47] memory right now
[1:00:50] but it's going good by god's grace the
[1:00:51] holy spirit always shows up and helps us
[1:00:53] out
[1:00:55] so what would a prophet's last words be
[1:00:57] feed on the word
[1:01:00] what's going to keep what's going to
[1:01:02] keep our church together if we're here
[1:01:04] we've been here 15 years
[1:01:07] bang and i my wife only ones left from
[1:01:09] the beginning
[1:01:11] we've been here 50 years what has kept
[1:01:12] us 15 years three services a week most
[1:01:15] message churches don't do three services
[1:01:17] a week
[1:01:17] in america brother it's a lot it's a lot
[1:01:20] more lacks
[1:01:21] most churches don't even do two on
[1:01:22] sunday because they're too tired
[1:01:26] brother brahms example was two on sunday
[1:01:29] i'm not criticizing i'm just saying the
[1:01:32] bible says gather more that
[1:01:33] you see that day approaching i don't
[1:01:36] want to get called on god
[1:01:37] i want to stay hot on fire for god i
[1:01:39] can't get enough of the word
[1:01:41] i can't get enough of the worship and
[1:01:42] the singing i can't get enough of the
[1:01:44] fellowship
[1:01:45] now i get tired too just like we get
[1:01:46] tired right we we all need a nap
[1:01:48] but i gotta go home eventually eat and
[1:01:50] get but there's nothing better than
[1:01:52] being with god's people
[1:01:57] now we've had different people leave
[1:01:59] like remember when brother john left i
[1:02:00] was weeping and crying remember when
[1:02:01] wendy left i was crying
[1:02:04] i can relate to that right can you
[1:02:05] relate to that
[1:02:08] austin now austin says he's going to
[1:02:10] come back next next month i think
[1:02:11] next month or august i don't know if he
[1:02:13] will church how would we act if he come
[1:02:15] back
[1:02:17] we'd all be crying and say praise the
[1:02:19] lord
[1:02:21] him and his girlfriend watched our
[1:02:22] service a couple weeks ago he said oh
[1:02:23] that was a great sermon you preached on
[1:02:25] it's a sunday night
[1:02:26] sir i can't remember what it was oh
[1:02:28] joshua the walls of jericho he said
[1:02:30] he said my girlfriend and i we really
[1:02:32] enjoyed that sermon he still texts me a
[1:02:34] little sometimes
[1:02:35] but george this is the love we should
[1:02:36] have one for another
[1:02:38] right when we leave each other we should
[1:02:40] cry
[1:02:41] right because we're laboring together
[1:02:44] brother john did so much for me and that
[1:02:46] man i mean
[1:02:47] he'd unclog my toilets if they got
[1:02:48] clogged up
[1:02:50] that man taught me about finances he
[1:02:52] made uh
[1:02:53] computer spreadsheets for me that man
[1:02:56] fixed them on my vehicle so many times
[1:02:59] how could i not weep and cry the man
[1:03:01] prayed for me
[1:03:03] he preached when i passed out i don't
[1:03:04] know where you guys were there
[1:03:07] i passed out one time i tried to i tried
[1:03:09] to rebuke a
[1:03:11] a strep throat brother i all night i was
[1:03:13] up all night rebuking the strep throat
[1:03:15] help me jesus i want to see angels help
[1:03:16] me
[1:03:16] i'm going to preach anyway i go to and i
[1:03:18] passed out right before the service they
[1:03:20] had to call 9-1-1
[1:03:22] i had to go home that was a couple years
[1:03:24] ago at the other waterloo
[1:03:26] so john stepped up and he preached with
[1:03:28] no uh
[1:03:30] with no notice just right there to post
[1:03:33] a duty how can i
[1:03:33] not love people like that
[1:03:39] so what would your work last words be
[1:03:43] don't worry don't worry about taking
[1:03:45] from people
[1:03:46] give to people see how much you can give
[1:03:50] to people
[1:03:51] remember john wesley said that see how
[1:03:52] much you can save see how much you can
[1:03:54] give
[1:03:56] right that was his wisdom a prophet of
[1:03:58] god right not a prophet but a messenger
[1:03:59] of god
[1:04:01] see what we can give yeah let's say to
[1:04:04] our feet
[1:04:11] take heed to one another church take you
[1:04:13] to our lives
[1:04:16] make sure we're feeding on the word of
[1:04:18] god
[1:04:19] watch and pray know that this word this
[1:04:22] message is able to build us up think how
[1:04:26] much stronger brother william is over
[1:04:27] all these years

[1:04:32] 96 2006 2016 over 40 years
[1:04:37] 45 years and i wonder
[1:04:41] i know if he was if he could look at his
[1:04:44] life what kind of person was i just
[1:04:45] 20 years ago i'm a stronger person today
[1:04:49] because this word of this grace has been
[1:04:51] able to build me up he might not be
[1:04:54] bigger physically none of us will be
[1:04:57] right
[1:04:58] probably not but he'll be bigger
[1:05:00] spiritually
[1:05:02] more faith more confidence more patience
[1:05:04] in the in the mighty god
[1:05:07] musicians can come you can stop the live
[1:05:09] stream here i don't
[1:05:10] really plan on saying anything else but
[1:05:12] you can stop it god bless the live
[1:05:15] streamers
