[3:52] Lord so God bless each one of you um
[3:55] let's go in our in our Bibles um if you
[3:57] will let's go to Hebrews chapter
[4:00] 12 starting at verse
[4:09] 14 Hebrews chapter 12 starting at verse
[4:23] 14 it says follow peace with all men it
[4:27] says and
[4:28] Holiness with without which no man shall
[4:31] see the Lord looking diligently lest any
[4:35] man fail of the grace of God lest any
[4:38] root of bitterness springing up trouble
[4:41] you and thereby many be
[4:44] defiled Colossians chapter
[4:47] 3 we want to come down to verse
[4:53] 12 Colossians chapter 3 starting at
[4:57] verse 12
[5:11] it says put on therefore as the elect of
[5:14] God holy and beloved bows of mercies
[5:18] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[5:22] longsuffering verse 13 says forbearing
[5:25] one another and forgiving one another
[5:28] amen If any man have a quarrel against
[5:30] any even as Christ forgave you so also
[5:34] do ye and above all these things put on
[5:38] charity he says which is the bond of
[5:41] perfectness and let the peace of God
[5:44] rule in your hearts to the which also ye
[5:48] are called in one body he says and be ye
[5:52] thankful may the Lord bless his word
[5:54] Saints you may be seated
[6:06] praise the Lord okay so there are some
[6:09] new faces that I'm seeing this morning
[6:12] so just as an introduction I'm brother
[6:14] Dennis McBride from uh Columbia South
[6:17] Carolina and uh by God's grace I've been
[6:22] ministering since around about
[6:25] 2000
[6:27] um It's been a
[6:30] a good experience a wonderful experience
[6:33] overall because I my upbringing I I
[6:36] didn't I wasn't brought up in a
[6:38] Christian
[6:39] environment um I was brought up in in a
[6:43] a real worldly environment um I was
[6:46] surrounded by an atmosphere that
[6:50] uh it's just the grace of God that I am
[6:52] who I am right um CU it it wasn't a good
[6:57] atmosphere at all uh but
[7:00] regardless of my
[7:03] surroundings um God was with me the
[7:05] whole
[7:07] time and I believe we've come to
[7:09] understand that now that even when you
[7:11] didn't know him he already knew you and
[7:14] he was actually with you he was keeping
[7:18] you I can remember situations that I was
[7:21] in and as now that I look back from from
[7:23] where I am now looking back in
[7:25] retrospect I can just see his hand all
[7:28] along the way
[7:31] um I won't go into any details of
[7:34] anything but I'm just I'm
[7:36] grateful I'm grateful
[7:38] so I want to I want to do something very
[7:42] quickly uh from last night we were
[7:44] dealing with the spirit of a tail
[7:47] Bearer and I just kind of feel L to kind
[7:51] of just start off with this because when
[7:54] it comes to Satan and the whole realm of
[7:58] evil spirits we deal with spirits on a
[8:01] daily basis we're dealing with them
[8:03] right now in this
[8:06] service just because we're in church
[8:08] that doesn't mean it's just all God
[8:10] that's here even though he's present
[8:13] evil spirits are just as present and
[8:15] they want to do what they want to for
[8:17] one they want to hinder you and I from
[8:19] getting any closer to God right he want
[8:22] that they want to hinder you and I from
[8:24] being able to become
[8:26] engaged right so they try to bring
[8:28] distraction to our minds to cause our
[8:31] thoughts to drift off on on whatever it
[8:34] can uh just to get us to uh uh not be
[8:38] able to be
[8:39] attentive to whatever the Holy Spirit
[8:42] wants to say to us but that's their
[8:44] objective they want to they want to keep
[8:46] our minds so far away from God and and
[8:49] and hold it there right but also uh the
[8:53] scripture says that uh Satan has many
[8:56] objectives or what have you but the
[8:58] Bible says that he comes to steal kill
[9:00] and
[9:02] destroy right so that's his objective
[9:05] and no matter how he tries to come into
[9:07] a person's life he wants to if if he can
[9:10] take that person all the way out and
[9:12] listen it's a physical death and it's a
[9:14] spiritual
[9:15] death right the Bible says a woman that
[9:18] lives in pleasure is dead while she's
[9:21] living right so Satan want to sweep
[9:23] people off into you know entertainments
[9:25] into the pleasures of his life cuz he
[9:28] knows that he will'll render that person
[9:30] you know spiritually dead right because
[9:33] that becomes a
[9:35] God right a person that continue to give
[9:38] themselves over to those things and give
[9:40] God less and less and less whatever we
[9:42] allow to be exalted above God in our Liv
[9:46] Saints to God is an idol yes
[9:50] sir praise the Lord so as we go over
[9:53] these lessons and what have you there is
[9:56] no way that we can really gain the
[9:58] victory in enter into a place to where
[10:01] we can effectively resist the devil
[10:05] unless we actually have for one the
[10:08] baptism of the Holy
[10:10] Ghost and even if you have the baptism
[10:13] of the Holy Ghost you have to stay in a
[10:16] consecrated
[10:17] place because if you don't stay in a
[10:20] consecrated Place listen even with the
[10:23] Holy Ghost you can slip into a natural
[10:26] carnal frame of mind and you can
[10:28] actually Walk In the Flesh that's right
[10:32] you understand what I'm saying meaning
[10:34] you're not walking according to the
[10:35] dictates of the spirit you're not
[10:38] looking at life right you know and and
[10:40] we hit those snags sometimes right but
[10:43] we thank God for his precious Holy
[10:46] Spirit we thank God for his love right
[10:48] because he comes and he begins to call
[10:50] us from those places because we're his
[10:54] child and we don't belong there right so
[10:58] God is you know he'll come to us and
[10:59] he'll he'll that small still voice will
[11:02] begin to speak to us and say now you
[11:04] need to
[11:06] stop you remember David David said as I
[11:10] thought on my
[11:12] ways that means that he had
[11:15] drifted yes amen but because he was
[11:18] God's child God saw him drifting but he
[11:22] said okay now you've come to your
[11:24] stopping point and the Holy Spirit begin
[11:26] to deal with David's heart and it made
[11:29] David stop and consider his
[11:32] ways when the Holy Spirit is dealing
[11:35] with your life that's what he does he
[11:37] makes you stop and he makes you consider
[11:39] all the things that's contrary to him
[11:42] that might be present in your life and
[11:44] as David stopped to think on his ways
[11:47] God convinced him and he says now I'mma
[11:50] turn my feet back to his
[11:53] testimonies that mean I'mma go back into
[11:55] the way I'mma
[11:56] repent right you're going in one
[11:59] Direction but when you repent you stop
[12:01] and go back in the right direction
[12:03] praise God Amen and when that happens
[12:06] Saints now you're able to come into a
[12:08] restoration you're able to come into a
[12:11] refreshing Glory I don't know about you
[12:14] but I do know about you because we kind
[12:15] of are like light CU I believe you the
[12:18] children of God too right amen when when
[12:20] you when when when you are out of the
[12:22] way or when when the enemy has somehow
[12:24] allow or caused you to drift you feel
[12:27] like a fish out of water yes yes it
[12:30] don't feel right and it'll never feel
[12:32] right because you weren't made to live
[12:34] like that think like that or be like
[12:36] that you can't be
[12:40] comfortable that's a blessing to be able
[12:43] to feel like that because then you know
[12:45] I mean that that's a confirmation to you
[12:47] that you don't belong out there so you
[12:49] must belong with God so let me get back
[12:52] to where I'm comfortable at where I feel
[12:56] my best
[12:57] at praise God
[12:59] amen so we were dealing with the spirit
[13:01] of a tail Bearer on last night and and
[13:04] and and a tail bearing Spirit it it it
[13:08] comes because another part of the
[13:10] characteristics that that that comes
[13:12] from the works of Satan is to divide and
[13:15] to
[13:16] conquer so Satan wants
[13:20] to to each individual he wants to break
[13:23] the individual
[13:25] down we ended on the little foxes
[13:28] spoiling Divine on last night amen those
[13:32] little things Satan comes and injects in
[13:34] a person's life and when you and when
[13:37] you're not obessed when you're not
[13:39] informed about certain things you don't
[13:41] you're not able to readily identify what
[13:43] it is unless the Holy Spirit just really
[13:46] helps you to see it you don't know what
[13:48] you're getting into or you don't know
[13:49] what you're opening yourself up to but
[13:52] that Spirit wants to come in and it
[13:54] wants to wean you away from God and the
[13:57] things of God right and and ultimately
[14:00] it wants to be able to use each
[14:02] individual as a tool to bring A
[14:05] disruption to somebody else's
[14:08] life so these evil spirits are just
[14:11] tools of the devil to bring about
[14:15] division because the Bible plainly says
[14:18] and I'll end scriptural wise on this
[14:20] right here the Bible plainly says that
[14:22] where is no where where where no tail
[14:24] Bearer is that's a person that spreads
[14:27] rumors and Gossel
[14:29] about somebody where there is no tail
[14:32] Bearer The Bible says Strife it ends
[14:35] right there because you don't have
[14:37] nobody that's going about to bring about
[14:40] division amongst the people that's being
[14:42] used by the enemy in that kind of
[14:45] away but I want to leave you with this
[14:48] because this is very important
[14:54] right cuz we're living in the world the
[14:58] spirits are just
[15:00] there and we're all able to be anointed
[15:04] by these Spirits yes but it's one thing
[15:07] that I believe God wants us to keep in
[15:09] mind remember when he was on Calvary
[15:12] when Christ was on the cross what's the
[15:14] most notable thing he said while he was
[15:16] on that cross
[15:18] Saints he said father forgive them for
[15:22] they know not what they
[15:25] do isn't that a blessing
[15:27] Saints amen and when he comes inside of
[15:30] us he's able to help us to gain that
[15:33] same perspective so the prophet brought
[15:35] this out and why are we not a
[15:37] denomination he says and now I've went
[15:39] to everybody that I know it of because
[15:41] in his own church the enemy had come in
[15:45] and he began to bring about disputes and
[15:47] disruptions and arguments and
[15:49] disagreements and differences amongst
[15:52] the homes of the
[15:53] Saints and when he's able to affect
[15:56] homes and individuals you know what else
[15:57] that affects it fects churches right cuz
[16:01] even though you come together you you
[16:02] know you know you're supposed to go to
[16:04] church and whatever but if you come
[16:06] together and people have wrong spirits
[16:08] on them amen it disrupts the atmosphere
[16:12] it hinders the flowing of the
[16:17] spirit he says and now I've went to
[16:20] everybody that I know of brother brother
[16:22] brandom understood the importance of
[16:25] getting differences
[16:27] settled amen he understood the the
[16:30] magnitude of how could it affect the
[16:32] actual Ministry and the church itself he
[16:35] says he says they had little a little
[16:38] something you know he was talking about
[16:39] being against one another he said if
[16:41] there's anything out of the way now you
[16:44] remember I told you a long time ago we
[16:47] was going to get it straightened up and
[16:49] I know that you know there's a different
[16:52] Spirit here than there was before so
[16:55] when all the quarreling and the fussing
[16:57] and the differences and whatever form
[16:59] that might have been in was present it
[17:01] was affecting the atmosphere of the
[17:03] church that's right right and the Holy
[17:05] Spirit had the prophet hone in on that
[17:08] and say we got to get this atmosphere
[17:10] back right again cuz God needs to have
[17:14] freedom Amen to be able to move freely
[17:17] amongst the Saints because every one of
[17:19] us have real needs and we need a real
[17:22] living God to come down in our midst and
[17:25] help to quench everything that we stand
[17:27] in need of
[17:29] but the enemy don't want that that's why
[17:31] he moves in these very slick and subtle
[17:34] ways but the Holy Spirit had the prophet
[17:37] dialed right in on it he says and I know
[17:39] that you know there's a different Spirit
[17:41] here than there was before he says see
[17:44] that's right now don't let it leave no
[17:47] more you be very attentive to how you
[17:50] allow yourself to think and how you
[17:53] allow yourself to operate and how you
[17:55] allow yourself to speak amen cuz we
[17:58] don't want to let the enemy come in no
[17:59] more in the same ways that he was able
[18:02] to do it before
[18:04] Hallelujah watch he says I charge you
[18:07] before Jesus Christ don't let it leave
[18:10] stay right here with it see just keep
[18:13] everything iron he says iron right down
[18:17] and move right on he says you are
[18:19] Brethren it's coming to the Very Special
[18:21] Part here he says it's never your
[18:25] brother or sister right
[18:30] when situations disputes disagreements
[18:33] and things of that nature come about the
[18:36] enemy wants us to focus in on the
[18:40] person and then you start having
[18:42] feelings toward a person you start not
[18:46] wanting to be around the
[18:48] person you understand and that's the
[18:51] very thing that hurts God because we're
[18:54] his family and God don't want any
[18:57] divisions amongst his family but the
[18:59] devil does so he's he's warning us he
[19:02] says it's never your brother or sister
[19:05] he says that does anything wrong can we
[19:07] say Amen to that whenever somebody when
[19:11] whenever you feel like somebody has done
[19:13] you wrong please by the grace of May the
[19:15] Lord help this to come back to your
[19:17] minds it ain't my brother it ain't my
[19:19] sister so I'm not going to look at them
[19:21] and allow myself to get upset with them
[19:23] I'mma pray that this Spirit be cast out
[19:27] from among us and that my brother be
[19:30] reconciled amen back to the presence of
[19:33] God again that we might be able to move
[19:35] forward in a Christian
[19:40] character now you talking about maturity
[19:43] amen God is grooming us Saints to be
[19:46] that church that he had in his
[19:50] mind Lord have mercy he says it start he
[19:53] says he said it's that Spirit of the
[19:56] devil gets in there see he goes RS
[19:59] around he says and just feel sorry for
[20:01] the brother or sister and know it's
[20:04] Satan getting between and if you have
[20:06] some feeling about it meaning you're
[20:09] affected you feeling strange about it he
[20:12] says you get that out of you right quick
[20:14] you see cuz it'll caner
[20:18] you that means it'll come in and it'll
[20:21] begin to work and as you allow it to sit
[20:24] it'll begin to break you down
[20:26] spiritually it'll bring you into frame
[20:28] of minds and cycles of thoughts amen you
[20:31] don't realize if it'll be grieving the
[20:33] Holy Spirit right away from yes sir he
[20:37] said if you continue in this way he said
[20:39] you will hurt your pastor and he said
[20:41] you will cause the spirit of Christ to
[20:43] have to depart meaning his anointing
[20:46] won't be able to abide because he's not
[20:49] welcomed in those atmospheres and that's
[20:52] individually or as a group as a family
[20:56] no matter where you put it at
[21:00] yes everybody
[21:03] understand so now we're going to go into
[21:05] the lesson for the
[21:07] day praise God I just kind of wanted to
[21:09] touch on those things but the lesson for
[21:11] the Day Ties back into that as well
[21:15] okay and what I want to do by the grace
[21:19] of
[21:20] God I'mma go back to Hebrews chapter
[21:24] 12 because this actually ties into the
[21:27] scripture from last night I I believe it
[21:29] was last
[21:31] night it might have been Friday night
[21:34] where Jesus made the statement Jesus
[21:36] said that which goes inside of a man
[21:39] that doesn't defile a man he said but
[21:42] what comes out of a man meaning what
[21:46] comes from the heart spoken by the mouth
[21:48] in
[21:49] words those words have an anointing with
[21:52] it there's a source there's there
[21:55] there's a either an upward Source
[21:57] meaning it's coming from from above cuz
[21:59] the Bible talks about the wisdom that
[22:02] descended right but then there's also
[22:04] another wisdom that comes from the Dark
[22:07] World right and you can tell it by its
[22:12] characteristics you understand and
[22:15] everybody as the prophet said we're
[22:16] we're Mortals living in the first the
[22:19] these three dimensions light time and
[22:21] matter isn't that right brother all
[22:23] right and then we have above us
[22:24] dimensions and that's normally where the
[22:27] the the good things are the Heavenly
[22:29] things all right but then you have also
[22:31] dimensions and I'm saying up and down
[22:33] but just in respect to Good and Evil
[22:36] right so you have other dimensions where
[22:38] demons work you have Dimensions where
[22:41] people that have died that don't know
[22:43] God that didn't know God refuse them
[22:44] they were ordained to it they're being
[22:46] held you know in that Dimension and you
[22:49] have the prophet allow I mean God
[22:51] allowed the prophet to see beyond the
[22:53] curtain of time right and he saw where
[22:55] the saints that went on before us are
[22:57] waiting
[22:59] right wait waiting wait waiting for that
[23:01] rapturing day right but now we're in
[23:04] here in between that and this this
[23:06] Mortal realm and he says you're
[23:08] influenced either from from either
[23:12] side right so your thoughts your words
[23:16] your actions your music what you watch
[23:19] all of that is being
[23:21] influenced you understand what I'm
[23:23] saying and I'm just going to tell you my
[23:26] my personal testimony right this is
[23:28] brother
[23:30] McBride I never the Lord by his grace he
[23:34] took T
[23:36] he I'm not I I've not been bound by
[23:39] television for for many
[23:42] years I have no need neither any
[23:45] dependency upon Television right but
[23:49] we're not talking about just the actual
[23:52] material that is made out of but it's
[23:55] what projected on it right but I don't
[23:58] even want to make that a focal point
[24:01] because anybody that has a phone you
[24:04] might not have a
[24:06] TV but you got access at the swipe of a
[24:10] thumb to everything
[24:13] plus you understand what I'm saying so
[24:16] the Lord has been dealing with me on
[24:18] these things right because it matters to
[24:21] God how much time you
[24:24] pour into things brother bradam he said
[24:27] you don't he you know he he spoke in one
[24:29] wise about a you know a woman that goes
[24:32] and prostitutes herself out right she
[24:35] goes and sells her body to other men and
[24:37] whatever for you know carnal Pleasures
[24:39] or whatever and to receive gain or
[24:41] whatever but he made this statement that
[24:43] always stood out to me he says
[24:46] prostitution is on a higher
[24:48] level he said you can prostitute your
[24:55] time that means that time that could be
[24:58] given to God in prayer and in the
[25:00] reading of his word and listening to the
[25:02] word that he s in this hour it's being
[25:06] neglected or giving a minimal space to
[25:10] have your attention amen but then you
[25:12] know when it comes to our phones and
[25:14] things of that nature look how much time
[25:16] can be given some people spend time they
[25:19] spend hours yes sir the phone has become
[25:22] so addictive until whenever somebody has
[25:25] a break in time they want to pull the
[25:27] phone out and give get on it to be able
[25:29] to see what's
[25:30] there so in a in in a in in a in a in a
[25:34] a a Time range of one day you know how
[25:36] much time people spend on their
[25:40] phones and now okay what are you looking
[25:45] at those algorithms are like
[25:50] demons cuz demons study us right yes sir
[25:54] and they they they they see what you
[25:55] give your attention to they they they
[25:57] they see what you pause
[25:59] yes yes you know for a woman or a man or
[26:02] whatever you know there there are
[26:04] certain things that are attractive and
[26:06] there are certain things that'll never
[26:07] be attractive you know it can be men or
[26:10] other men or women or it can just be
[26:12] things in the earth I've never had an
[26:14] issue with
[26:16] smoking right now it's only by the grace
[26:19] of God now okay I wasn't keep him
[26:23] myself I tried marijuana one time I said
[26:27] I don't know what in the world people do
[26:28] this
[26:31] stuff I tried alcohol coming up I drunk
[26:35] alcohol and you know I'm with my
[26:37] so-called friends I ain't know that they
[26:39] weren friends at that time I thought
[26:40] they was friends but now now now I give
[26:43] my life to Christ I said man that was
[26:45] working for the enemy you know but I I I
[26:48] tried drinking beer and and I tried but
[26:51] it was just so nasty to me I said man
[26:54] how people drink this stuff and eat
[26:57] their food together it make me
[27:00] vomit and I tried hard they call I guess
[27:03] hard liquor or whatever I tried that
[27:05] stuff too but then what cured me from
[27:09] that I was in a Marine Corps and I was
[27:12] at a certain plon or base and a Gunnery
[27:16] Sergeant one of my superiors gave me a
[27:18] little
[27:19] bit and I drunk that stuff man and I had
[27:22] to walk across the parking lot to get to
[27:25] my squad Bay and I couldn't hardly walk
[27:28] across the parking lot I kind of buckled
[27:32] halfway through and when I got to the
[27:34] bay and got in bed I was just so it made
[27:37] me so sick that was the last time that
[27:42] was the grace of God he knew what he had
[27:45] in store for me in the further part of
[27:47] my life and I didn't know that right but
[27:50] he was just protecting me and helping me
[27:52] not to become
[27:53] engulfed you know in those habits and
[27:56] what have you you understand so it
[27:58] wouldn't be too much of a battle for me
[28:00] but I'm I'm saying that everybody have
[28:02] different
[28:04] weaknesses and Satan studies that so
[28:06] when you're on your phone there's things
[28:09] you will pause on that somebody else
[28:11] won't pause on but when you pause that
[28:13] thing is tracking the time that you take
[28:16] to get beyond that particular
[28:18] page and whatever you spend that extra
[28:21] two or three or four seconds on that
[28:23] begins to FL it begin to pick up more of
[28:26] that content and pull it into your page
[28:29] it says this is where their interest is
[28:30] right here and that's what demons do
[28:34] they throw baits out there to see what
[28:36] they can catch your attention by and
[28:38] whatever you pause on the longest
[28:42] time that's the thing it begins to bring
[28:44] more by your way right Hallelujah and if
[28:48] you pay attention to it if you pause the
[28:50] spirit that's behind it when you give
[28:52] your attention to it now think about
[28:55] this eve listen to was
[28:59] serpent
[29:01] right she was
[29:04] perfect fortified behind God's word but
[29:08] when that serpent began to talk to her
[29:10] what did she do she stopped for a moment
[29:13] brother brandom said that's where she
[29:15] made her mistake she stopped just to
[29:18] consider what it was
[29:20] saying and when she stopped listen
[29:25] now that's the that's the real thing God
[29:27] was trying to protect us from when he
[29:29] when it comes to television as well as
[29:32] songs whatever you give attention to the
[29:35] spirit that's inspiring that that brings
[29:38] that song Or that show or whatever about
[29:41] that Spirit comes directly in you right
[29:47] then and that's the thing that pulls
[29:49] people and makes them begin to become
[29:51] addicted I got to look at this I got to
[29:54] listen to this and they can't let it go
[29:56] it's because they've given an open door
[29:58] to that devil yes sir not realizing it
[30:01] so when you're scrolling through your
[30:03] phones those Spirits are ready to
[30:06] transfer amen and get inside of a person
[30:09] because once you're bound by it you
[30:11] can't get away from it it's something
[30:13] that pulls you and and when Eve got
[30:16] anointed by that Spirit by the reception
[30:18] of the word it changed her
[30:21] perspective now what God Said was damned
[30:23] and wrong now she looked at it and said
[30:25] it was good it was that bad it don't
[30:29] bother me to watch this or to listen to
[30:31] this it's that Spirit bringing a
[30:33] deception about that's right G glory to
[30:37] God I don't mean to yell forgive me I
[30:42] just get caught away sometimes but you
[30:46] understand what I'm saying this is what
[30:48] you and I battle with on a daily basis
[30:52] yes sir now if you want this is I'm
[30:54] telling you what the Lord has been
[30:55] dealing you don't need none of that
[30:58] Hallelujah we become accustomed to
[31:00] things we become dependent upon certain
[31:03] things but listen I'm telling you you
[31:05] don't even need
[31:07] it if you got stranded on an island for
[31:10] a whole
[31:11] year no phone no
[31:14] nothing your habits will
[31:16] change once you come back into
[31:18] civilization you ain't a't going you
[31:20] ain't going to be looking for a TV or
[31:22] phone or whatever you would have been
[31:24] without it you would have gone through
[31:25] the withdrawal
[31:29] right all the crying and oh I can't
[31:33] watch my I got my phone oh you cleared
[31:36] up all that be done cleared up now you
[31:38] you normal
[31:42] now but Saints we don't need these
[31:44] things amen this Society has impressed
[31:47] these things upon us but you know what
[31:49] it's done it's weakened
[31:52] us
[31:54] hallelujah how did Paul come to the
[31:57] lifestyle that he
[31:58] did
[32:01] yes that brother said I stay under my
[32:05] body that I might bring it into
[32:08] subjection no distractions no
[32:10] worldliness he had it all around him but
[32:13] the Holy Spirit had him isolated tucked
[32:15] away in that secret place of his
[32:18] soul glory to God he was being control
[32:21] he said I became a
[32:24] prisoner brother brandham said God want
[32:26] prisoners
[32:30] that mean you can't go where you want to
[32:32] go you can't do what you want to do you
[32:35] can only move as God allow you to
[32:38] move you might have a desire well I want
[32:41] to go here and the Holy Spirit check you
[32:43] and say no glory to God Amen that's the
[32:46] place Saints that's where we belong amen
[32:49] that's where Sons and Daughters of God
[32:51] are their best
[32:53] at now you talking about seeing God in a
[32:56] greater way let us eliminate these
[32:58] worldly distractions and allow the Holy
[33:01] Spirit to have more
[33:03] time amen and you talking about seeing
[33:06] another book of Acts amen God moving in
[33:09] his church having his way flowing
[33:17] freely all
[33:19] right brother M Bri you ain't gave us
[33:22] your title Yet
[33:26] brother but the grace of God Saints I
[33:28] want to deal for a brief moment on
[33:34] resentment
[33:37] resentment what does the word resent
[33:40] mean and I want to say this right off
[33:43] Saints none of us are exempt from this
[33:46] and to a to a large degree I believe
[33:49] each one of us have been have been
[33:51] affected by it you might even be
[33:52] affected by it right
[33:54] now right
[33:59] the word resentment it means a it says
[34:01] it's a complex multi-layered emotion
[34:04] that has been described as a mixture of
[34:08] disappointment
[34:10] disgust or
[34:13] anger now resent the word resent it says
[34:18] it's a feeling of
[34:19] bitterness or
[34:21] anger or
[34:25] annoyance provoked by what is
[34:28] perceived as unfair
[34:31] treatment at a
[34:33] circumstance action or
[34:44] person so I want to set the
[34:48] tone with
[34:53] uh something from the message here
[34:58] so like I
[35:00] said when we're in our homes living Our
[35:04] Lives there's a lot of things that go on
[35:08] Saints offenses
[35:10] come life life life within life you just
[35:15] come in contact with so
[35:17] much but because you are a child of God
[35:21] Satan is always looking for a way to
[35:23] pull you down bind you
[35:25] up right and his most successful to or
[35:28] other
[35:30] people that's the one that's able to get
[35:33] at you the
[35:34] most right you can have a flat tire you
[35:37] know you'll be oh man I got a flat tire
[35:39] depending on if you're trying to get to
[35:41] work or not you'll get a little upset
[35:42] you know it'll make you a
[35:44] little irritated frustrated or whatever
[35:47] you get over that quick but whenever you
[35:50] have issues with other
[35:53] people those things are able to affect
[35:56] you very deeply
[35:58] yes sir if you feel like you've been
[36:01] done
[36:03] wrong and you maybe you may have been
[36:06] done
[36:07] wrong
[36:09] right but the enemy want to take that
[36:11] and he want to pervert that and take it
[36:15] somewhere that it should not
[36:17] go now he wants you to
[36:21] Harbor hard feelings now toward an
[36:26] individual right
[36:28] notice what the prophet says here now
[36:31] this is how this this this is how
[36:33] important this is is this is how
[36:35] important this is for you and I to
[36:36] remain free from these
[36:39] things he says in the message called the
[36:41] 10 virgins and the 144,000 Jews he said
[36:45] see if you got a resenting
[36:48] audience he said the Holy Spirit won't
[36:51] even
[36:54] reveal the minister has been praying
[36:57] he's been fasting laying before God it
[37:01] goes for the ministry too now the
[37:02] ministry ain't free from this
[37:05] right because Ministry I mean I'm a man
[37:07] and human I'm subject to everything just
[37:10] like everybody else so sometimes the
[37:12] hindrance is in the pits that's right
[37:15] yes things that people have encountered
[37:18] battles that people have encountered and
[37:20] they were severely hurt by certain
[37:23] situations uh that involve other people
[37:26] and they really having gotten over it
[37:28] yet amen and they're still going through
[37:31] the
[37:32] motions amen because they know that
[37:34] they're the ministry or whatever they
[37:35] come up behind the pullit and they try
[37:37] to deliver a message or whatever the
[37:39] case might be right but the Holy Spirit
[37:41] listen now the holy spirit is
[37:44] bound yes sir because that hurt has
[37:48] moved over into a perverted a form amen
[37:53] and now it becomes a root of
[37:55] bitterness you understand what I'm
[37:57] saying because they were done wrong they
[37:59] were talked about they were hurt by
[38:03] somebody all it takes is for one person
[38:08] Saints huh listen to what he says the
[38:11] Holy Spirit won't even reveal he says
[38:14] you got to have something that work
[38:16] that's working together he says they are
[38:18] in one place and in one Accord and then
[38:21] there came a sound from heaven like a
[38:24] mighty rushing wind
[38:28] huh so just by resentment being present
[38:32] within a
[38:38] group and there is a
[38:42] refusal to Humble themselves to God's
[38:46] word to get it right that's one side of
[38:49] it and sometimes they might just be
[38:51] ignorant of what's really dealing with
[38:55] them the Holy Spirit that's
[38:58] that's his breeding grounds right
[39:01] there we come together we
[39:04] smile right we say praise the lord we
[39:07] sing songs together and whatever but
[39:10] there is real healing that needs to take
[39:13] place within the depths of people's
[39:16] hearts there are certain people you can
[39:19] think about and when you think about
[39:21] them the hurt becomes so
[39:24] fresh until you're reliving that moment
[39:26] all over over again
[39:29] amen those are the things we need to go
[39:32] before God with in prayer and say Lord
[39:35] please help me because I'm not over this
[39:37] yet I can tell father I'm still hurt by
[39:43] it why do you think when the Holy Spirit
[39:47] In The Prophet's Ministry when the
[39:49] prayer lines and things was being called
[39:51] glory to God Amen what was happening
[39:54] Saints people had had issues many times
[39:58] that were a c that was caused by things
[40:00] that was way
[40:03] back and the Holy Spirit attract that
[40:06] thing back and pinpoint it and bring it
[40:09] up and in the cases that of things that
[40:12] dealt with human relations and things of
[40:15] that nature he'll call it
[40:17] out this is why you're like this because
[40:20] you had this situation going
[40:24] on what does the Holy Spirit what what
[40:27] does the Holy Spirit do Among Us Saints
[40:29] he Pro he promotes making things
[40:33] right
[40:34] amen when we get into that
[40:37] atmosphere it kind of it it melts us
[40:41] down to that place to where we lose all
[40:45] Pride you understand what I'm saying
[40:48] Pride it brings
[40:51] contention when a person refus I mean
[40:53] listen and even the Bible goes further
[40:56] it says that if if if your brother or
[40:59] your sister have a fault against you
[41:01] meaning you've you you've not done
[41:03] anything wrong so much so but they they
[41:05] actually have something against you God
[41:07] said you lay your gifts down and you go
[41:10] and you make things right with that
[41:12] individual sir yes sir that's how much
[41:16] together God want his body to be amen I
[41:19] don't want no lingering feelings of of
[41:22] of of of of of of of hurt and resentment
[41:24] or whatever to be abiding amongst my
[41:28] family that's why the Bible says if any
[41:31] man have a quarrel against any he said
[41:33] we must forbear one another and forgive
[41:36] one another we went over it last night
[41:39] as we was closing out when you stand
[41:41] praying God said you better
[41:43] forgive cuz if you don't forgive listen
[41:46] as I forgiving you freely God is say I
[41:49] want you to forgive also it don't matter
[41:52] what somebody has done to you or how
[41:54] badly you feel like how badly it's
[41:56] affected you God said I want you to
[41:59] forgive and you know what he does
[42:01] remember now Lord have
[42:04] mercy the prophet walked into that
[42:07] Cafe he saw that prostitute looking
[42:09] woman in there and he was like Lord why
[42:12] does my children have to grow up with
[42:14] people like Adam and Earth and he just
[42:17] came to such a
[42:19] disregard why don't you just wipe such
[42:23] off you want to know how the Holy Spirit
[42:25] cured him of that self righteous
[42:27] critical frame of mind you know how the
[42:30] Holy Spirit healed him of that brought
[42:32] him out of that anointing delivered him
[42:34] cast that devil out you know how he did
[42:36] his Saints he showed him
[42:40] himself he showed him his sins and what
[42:44] he had
[42:45] done can we say praise the Lord and he
[42:49] showed him how he forgave him he saw
[42:53] Christ reaching inside his and writing
[42:56] pardon with his own blood over his
[43:00] sins and then he turned around to
[43:03] brother Bram in that Vision he says now
[43:05] I forgiven you but you want to condemn
[43:08] her
[43:11] right the Bible says and if you see a
[43:14] brother overcoming a
[43:16] fault he said we to go to that
[43:19] individual in the spirit of
[43:22] meekness right and with humility
[43:28] why because it says plainly he says
[43:31] considering
[43:36] yourself so God don't want us to you
[43:39] know that's why we were dealing with
[43:40] that Spirit of a tail Bearer on last
[43:42] night you know they want to dig up
[43:44] faults on people and they want to begin
[43:46] to spread rumors about people amen and
[43:50] listen now they're deceived because they
[43:52] are the main culprit their lives might
[43:54] be riddled with sin
[43:58] but they want to find time to talk about
[44:00] somebody else's life and spread rumors
[44:02] and hurtful things about somebody else's
[44:04] life but one characteristic about a tail
[44:07] Bearer they'll never go tell anything on
[44:10] themselves that's right man they'll talk
[44:13] about somebody else all day long but
[44:15] when it come to them oh the Lord he's
[44:17] delivered me everything is fine with me
[44:20] I'm walking in
[44:24] Perfection sometime yeah by chance you
[44:27] come in contact with a tail Bearer and
[44:30] you see that there're running somebody
[44:32] else down in a way that God now is
[44:35] informing You Is Wrong you might just
[44:38] pause and ask them the question can you
[44:40] tell me a little bit about your
[44:44] faults that'll be the exit to the
[44:47] conversation oh I got to go
[44:50] now I got something on the
[44:53] stove you understand amen God I believe
[44:56] God God has taking the time to free us
[44:59] in our minds and me and brother Jesse
[45:01] was talking you know last night because
[45:03] there was a part that we dealt with
[45:04] where God has called he he he pretty
[45:07] much said he's giving us preventative
[45:11] measures and as I was considering what
[45:14] he said you know and how we talked about
[45:16] it you know when when when when when you
[45:17] take
[45:18] vitamins how many take
[45:21] zinc especially when y'all living in
[45:23] this cold country up here you know
[45:27] before the winter come you want to get
[45:29] your body stacked up with the right
[45:31] nutrients right so when those germs
[45:34] begin to
[45:35] fly right you will have a
[45:39] fortification on the inside that'll kind
[45:42] of help you to be able to
[45:44] resist those germs from amen
[45:47] infiltrating your body and bringing you
[45:49] down into a sickness and that's what God
[45:51] does God gives us the vitamins of his
[45:53] word amen amen that we might be
[45:56] fortified against the germs of that evil
[45:59] World evil spirits when they come God
[46:02] will have you so full with of the right
[46:04] things it'll repair those demons they
[46:07] won't be able to come in and abide
[46:10] something that's already on the inside
[46:11] of you will fight them
[46:13] off praise
[46:16] God
[46:19] okay oh
[46:25] my I want to go back back to
[46:30] numbers Numbers chapter
[46:35] 16 we read it on last
[46:39] night but I want to take it from this
[46:41] particular scripture and make a pivot
[46:43] with it by the grace of God number 16
[46:47] starting at verse
[46:50] one amen it says now Kora the son of
[46:53] isar the son of kab the son of Levi and
[46:57] Dayan and Abraham the sons of eliab and
[47:00] an the son of P sons of Ruben took men
[47:04] and they rose up before Moses with
[47:06] certain of the children of Israel 250
[47:08] princes of the assembly famous in the
[47:10] congregation men of renowned and they
[47:13] gathered themselves together against
[47:15] Moses against Aaron and said unto them
[47:18] ye take too much upon you seeing all the
[47:21] congregation Are Holy every one of them
[47:23] and the Lord is among them wherefore
[47:26] then lift ye up yourselves above the
[47:28] congregation of the Lord and verse four
[47:30] says and when Moses heard it he fell
[47:32] upon his face so last night we we
[47:35] identified clearly that it was a spirit
[47:37] of tail bearing that was working amongst
[47:40] them they even bring this
[47:42] about but I want you to understand also
[47:44] that
[47:47] resentment was within this as
[47:52] well and again resentment means a
[47:55] feeling of bitterness or anger or
[47:58] annoyance provoked by what is perceived
[48:01] as unfair treatment at a circumstance
[48:04] action or
[48:06] person right the the devil was
[48:10] successfully able to paint a picture
[48:12] within their minds that Moses had done
[48:14] something wrong and they were annoyed by
[48:19] that right but now notice when this
[48:22] Spirit was able to control them and
[48:25] bring them into this action
[48:28] what was the result of them yielding
[48:30] themselves to this spirit and its ways
[48:33] of
[48:33] thinking it ended their lives on the
[48:38] earth so when it comes to resentment
[48:43] Saints God he's very serious about
[48:47] that and he will allow lives to be taken
[48:52] if need
[48:54] be based upon that
[48:57] now I want to give you an example of
[48:59] this in our
[49:01] day some of you are well aware of this
[49:04] particular
[49:05] account but this is from the message of
[49:08] the voice of the
[49:09] sign is mentioned in several other
[49:12] places brother branon begins to say here
[49:14] about two months ago in my church one
[49:17] Sunday morning there was something Satan
[49:20] doing something to attract the attention
[49:22] of the people he says there was an
[49:24] Englishman there by the name of way he
[49:27] says he lives he says you want his
[49:29] address or we can have you to write he
[49:31] says he sends tapes of the meetings from
[49:34] overseas and the man resented what I
[49:37] said heartily watch this now and I
[49:40] looked down and I seen he says that
[49:43] horrible Spirit upon
[49:47] him so whenever there's resentment now
[49:50] listen the prophet was in the
[49:53] spirit and he looked down at a flesh and
[49:56] blood LED man and he said I could see
[49:59] that horrible Spirit the spirit that
[50:02] brings resentment I can see that
[50:04] horrible Spirit upon
[50:06] him he says I had now the only thing
[50:09] brother brandom said and this is how
[50:11] this Spirit works when it anoints
[50:14] somebody it causes that person to become
[50:18] highly agitated by someone
[50:22] else this brother had real problems he
[50:26] had a heart murmur right he asked
[50:29] brother brandom for an
[50:31] interview brother brandom allows him to
[50:34] have the interview the Lord comes down
[50:37] and discerns the man's situation he
[50:40] tells the man look brother you have a
[50:42] heart murmur now this is God himself
[50:46] revealing you understand the unknown by
[50:49] natural man right and in the presence of
[50:52] the Lord that demon had that brother so
[50:55] possessed until when God was speaking to
[50:58] him out of brother brandom's mouth
[50:59] brother brandham said he resented
[51:01] everything I said he didn't know that he
[51:05] was resenting
[51:11] God he goes on to say he says I had him
[51:14] on a private interview I said Mr way you
[51:17] have a heart trouble he even resented
[51:19] that I said why did you come to me for
[51:21] then he say so about a month after that
[51:24] he went to the doctor and the doctor
[51:26] said the doctor said he had a very bad
[51:29] heart he say so he come to the meeting
[51:32] that morning and something was said he
[51:34] says he's a real hot-headed
[51:37] Englishman now everybody don't have the
[51:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't know
[51:42] if brother way is elect or not because
[51:45] even though he had this instance amen
[51:47] the Lord dealt with him now and we don't
[51:49] know what happened with his life beyond
[51:51] that point at least I haven't come
[51:53] across it right so just because he had
[51:56] this instant that don't mean me he
[51:58] wasn't elect he just had to go on with
[52:00] the Lord so real change can be brought
[52:02] about in his life right but notice this
[52:06] now he says he's a real hot-headed
[52:08] Englishman you know he resented that he
[52:11] says his wife a Wonder a wonderful nor
[52:14] region woman a nurse he says uh and was
[52:16] sitting there with him the thing he
[52:19] resented is brother brandom talked about
[52:22] complexes and he said brother he said
[52:24] how many in here have dealt with complex
[52:26] Le before I don't know how many people
[52:29] but a number of people raised their
[52:30] hands he say see brother way we all deal
[52:33] with complexes I deal with complexes but
[52:36] because that horrible Spirit was on him
[52:39] it made him resent what brother brandham
[52:41] even said there and he turned to his
[52:45] wife and he said to her I resent
[52:48] that now this is how serious this is
[52:51] Saints not only does it in hinder the
[52:53] move of God in an assembly or in a
[52:56] family and within an individual it can
[52:59] call god listen it watch
[53:03] this and I said something and he
[53:05] resented it right quick you know and
[53:07] when he did he was standing to his feet
[53:10] and they were singing and when he did he
[53:13] turned to his wife and said what he said
[53:16] his head went back his eyes just flipped
[53:19] right straight back his feet turned re
[53:22] his face turned real dark red like that
[53:25] desk there and he fell dead to the
[53:30] floor what caused him to
[53:33] die
[53:38] resentment
[53:43] resentment but because brother brandham
[53:45] had the Holy Ghost remember when Moses
[53:47] was being resented the Bible says he
[53:50] fell down on his face before the
[53:53] Lord amen that brother had it because
[53:56] Christ Christ was in not as the Holy
[53:58] Ghost he didn't have the baptism of the
[53:59] Holy Ghost but he was so anointed by the
[54:01] spirit of God until even though they
[54:04] came to him and he was perfectly
[54:06] innocent he went to go and stand in the
[54:11] Gap Lord have
[54:16] mercy brother brandham when when that
[54:19] man fell dead I said now we don't know
[54:23] what the heavenly father is going to do
[54:26] and I said maybe he did it for a purpose
[54:28] I said brother way was resenting said he
[54:31] whispered to me his wife said he
[54:33] whispered to me that he was resenting
[54:35] what you said and I said he ought to
[54:38] have done that he says I said Heavenly
[54:40] Father forgive brother way for his error
[54:43] and I called for his Spirit to return He
[54:45] said brother brandom and there he was
[54:48] alive again standing among us
[54:51] see so God let the man's life be
[54:54] taken because of
[54:57] resentment I want to go to another
[55:00] example here because the Bible lets us
[55:03] know that when Jesus was in his own
[55:06] Hometown the Bible says that they were
[55:08] offended in
[55:10] him and because they were offended in
[55:13] him the Bible says many mighty Works he
[55:16] could not
[55:18] do and you know he's the reveal
[55:22] word so an individual's mind toward the
[55:25] message of the
[55:27] hour cuz many people make complaints how
[55:29] come we don't see God moving like he
[55:31] used to move that we know or in the way
[55:34] that we know he can move or whatever
[55:36] amen could you very well be the
[55:39] problem you're complaining about not
[55:42] seeing God move what is your mind toward
[55:44] the message of the hour what's your mind
[55:46] toward your brother or your sister you
[55:49] could be the very hindrance of the
[55:51] moving of God in your midst
[55:57] can we say praise the Lord
[55:59] Saints
[56:01] amen but I'm I'mma share with you this
[56:05] particular situation here Saints and I'm
[56:07] going end with this by the grace of
[56:11] God there was a service blind bmus blind
[56:15] bmus was the service
[56:18] itself and brother brandham talked about
[56:21] this couple that came inside of the
[56:23] service he says and there was a man and
[56:26] his wife first time they was ever in one
[56:28] of my meetings they were sitting in the
[56:31] audience a lady come in and sat down by
[56:34] the side of them and the and the little
[56:36] lady resented it so notice it was a
[56:38] couple that had come in now this couple
[56:40] had a need they both had
[56:44] illnesses they both needed to be dealt
[56:46] with by God in their bodies but then
[56:49] this little lady came in because it was
[56:51] a packed service she looked for a seat
[56:53] to sit in so she went and found a seat
[56:56] that happened to be by the woman and the
[56:59] man but I guess the woman wanted to have
[57:01] her
[57:02] space this is how this is how the enemy
[57:05] is able to slip in the little foxes come
[57:07] in to spoil the vine Saints I guess the
[57:10] woman wanted to have her space you know
[57:12] she ain't wanted to be too tightly in
[57:14] between maybe she was claustrophobic I
[57:16] don't know but she a't want to be too
[57:18] tightly in between people so when a
[57:20] woman came and took her seat the the
[57:22] prophet said here the woman that was
[57:25] sitting there already she resented the
[57:28] lady she became annoyed by her why she
[57:31] didn't go and sit somewhere
[57:34] else he says the lady was setting close
[57:37] he says cuz she was was was she was in
[57:40] her way and the woman that got annoyed
[57:42] by the woman taking a seat by her she
[57:44] made the woman move
[57:49] back now she had a
[57:51] need and the devil knew she had a need
[57:55] and he was trying trying to block her
[57:57] from receiving the healing that she
[57:59] needed to
[58:02] receive so she got annoyed with the lady
[58:04] and she asked the lady could you move
[58:06] back
[58:07] please and the woman kindly did it
[58:10] because they were in a church service
[58:12] but now the woman that was resenting
[58:14] that Spirit came on the woman that had
[58:16] done no
[58:17] wrong now that's the worst thing we can
[58:20] do when you see when you come in contact
[58:23] with somebody that might be resenting
[58:25] you
[58:27] amen you want to pray and ask God to
[58:29] keep you in the right Spirit sir cuz
[58:32] just in a matter of seconds that Spirit
[58:35] transferred from that woman that it
[58:37] initially anointed and moved upon the
[58:40] woman that had done no wrong but because
[58:43] of how she was addressed by the woman of
[58:45] course if somebody talked to you wrong
[58:47] in in a manner that you know with an
[58:49] attitude how is it going to make you
[58:52] feel any one of us if somebody come to
[58:55] us and in a real mean tone or whatever
[58:57] speak to us in a certain way it'll catch
[58:59] you off guard it'll make you feel in a
[59:01] certain way and the Lord has to help you
[59:03] to catch
[59:05] yourself if not you will get annoyed you
[59:07] will get upset or whatever the situation
[59:09] seemingly is provoking you to do so this
[59:12] woman has done no wrong and this woman
[59:14] is talking to her in this mean way and
[59:16] the B not the Bible but the prophet said
[59:18] she be to resent also now watch
[59:23] this the lady was set in close she was
[59:26] in her way made her move back after a
[59:30] while the little lady made her move back
[59:32] he says and this woman that had to move
[59:35] back she resented the woman resenting
[59:37] her so she got she got to
[59:41] praying the woman that did no wrong that
[59:44] was asked to move back she started
[59:46] praying because obviously the Holy
[59:48] Spirit convicted her
[59:50] heart amen watch this now so she started
[59:54] praying she said Lord I oughtn't to have
[59:57] done that forgive me I didn't mean it
[1:00:01] isn't that the place we want to be in
[1:00:03] Saints she couldn't help the initial
[1:00:06] reaction and feeling that she had but
[1:00:09] because she had a walk with
[1:00:11] God Amen the Holy Spirit wouldn't let
[1:00:15] that Spirit of resenting rest on her
[1:00:19] that's where you and I want to be at
[1:00:20] Saints we're going to come in contact
[1:00:22] with things but Lord help us to be so
[1:00:25] fortified
[1:00:26] that the spirit that tries to anoint us
[1:00:29] won't be able to stay upon
[1:00:35] us and by doing so because now she had
[1:00:40] obviously she you know she she probably
[1:00:42] was praying before she came to the
[1:00:44] service and she was sensitive she
[1:00:47] couldn't help the thing that CAU her by
[1:00:49] surprise but the anointing of God
[1:00:51] obviously was with her and that's the
[1:00:53] thing that brought her into check amen
[1:00:56] now watch because of the anointing that
[1:00:58] was upon her now just like that evil
[1:01:01] spirit listen to this Saints just like
[1:01:03] that evil spirit transferred from the
[1:01:06] woman that it initially moved upon to
[1:01:08] the woman had that had done no wrong now
[1:01:11] the right Spirit the right anointing is
[1:01:13] going to move from the woman that then
[1:01:15] begin to go to the Lord in prayer and
[1:01:17] it's going to transfer to that woman
[1:01:19] that initially got offended watch this
[1:01:23] he says and then the lady that was in
[1:01:25] front the one that told her to move back
[1:01:28] the lady that was in front of her that
[1:01:30] told her to move back um that had
[1:01:33] resented her she turned around and said
[1:01:35] because now God's presence was there she
[1:01:38] turned around and said sister I'm
[1:01:43] sorry you see that praise God she was
[1:01:48] the initial one that was anointed by
[1:01:50] that spirit that got annoyed with that
[1:01:51] woman and made her move back but when
[1:01:54] this woman allowed herself to be humbled
[1:01:57] in the presence of God and she begin to
[1:01:59] pray and ask God for forgiveness God
[1:02:01] begin to deal with the woman who
[1:02:03] initiated it and brought her heart right
[1:02:06] into a place listen because she needed
[1:02:10] healing the Holy Spirit was trying to
[1:02:13] block her from receiving her heal when
[1:02:16] you have resentment in your life you
[1:02:19] block the move of God in your own
[1:02:23] life this is going to prove it right
[1:02:26] here cuz when that woman now was touched
[1:02:28] by the spirit of God cuz the devil ain't
[1:02:30] going to make you apologize for nothing
[1:02:33] right that was the Holy Ghost sister I'm
[1:02:36] sorry I didn't mean to do that amen
[1:02:39] listen now and the two the husband and
[1:02:42] the wife were
[1:02:44] sick and oh watch this just a little bit
[1:02:48] after that was done so after the woman
[1:02:52] prayed and asked God to forgive her then
[1:02:55] the Holy Spirit touched the woman that
[1:02:57] was really sick that was the first one
[1:02:59] to be offended and resenting and told a
[1:03:01] woman to get back but as soon as she
[1:03:03] made it right brother brandom says just
[1:03:05] a little bit after that I seen the angel
[1:03:09] of the Lord standing over
[1:03:12] them as soon as the woman was able to be
[1:03:16] freed from that resenting Spirit the
[1:03:19] spirit of God was drawn to her because
[1:03:21] they needed
[1:03:23] healing but as long as that resented
[1:03:26] Spirit wasn't there the Holy Ghost
[1:03:27] stayed away right but it was just
[1:03:31] waiting for it listen how how much time
[1:03:33] you think it took for them to make that
[1:03:36] right a few minutes amen as soon as they
[1:03:40] made it right all of a sudden the
[1:03:42] prophet saw the angel of the Lord go and
[1:03:44] stand right over the woman that had just
[1:03:46] humbled herself to the word of God Amen
[1:03:49] that was anointing her to make things
[1:03:52] right and when that resentment left her
[1:03:54] now she was open to be a recipient of
[1:03:56] healing
[1:03:58] Hallelujah glory to God he says I seen
[1:04:01] the angel of the Lord standing over them
[1:04:03] called them by name and healed them both
[1:04:06] and sent them back to their
[1:04:11] home so when you got a
[1:04:13] resenting Spirit upon you it can keep
[1:04:17] you from natural healing and spiritual
[1:04:22] healing so how many want to stay free
[1:04:25] from the spirit Spirit of
[1:04:27] resentment I need the power of God I
[1:04:31] need the help of God I need the Holy
[1:04:33] Spirit to be able to come and rest on me
[1:04:37] amen Lord let me be so anointed until
[1:04:39] I'm able to respond to offenses just
[1:04:42] like this Lord amen you might you know
[1:04:45] man we human some people are a little
[1:04:48] quick tempered and things of that nature
[1:04:49] you know amen you can pray and say Lord
[1:04:51] help me be help me to be delivered from
[1:04:53] this I don't want to be quick tempered
[1:04:55] Lord
[1:04:56] this thing is trying to get me in
[1:04:57] trouble the devil is using this against
[1:04:59] me Lord I need your Holy Spirit I need
[1:05:02] to be filled with your Holy Spirit Lord
[1:05:04] that all these things can be flushed
[1:05:10] out so as we stand together
[1:05:20] Saints right
[1:05:24] now search your own Hearts your own
[1:05:29] lives if there's anything or
[1:05:32] anyone that has hurt you and has done
[1:05:36] you wrong and you hadn't been able to
[1:05:38] get over that for one just understand
[1:05:40] regardless of how they've done you you
[1:05:42] are never justified in the sight of God
[1:05:45] withholding grudges or being bitter
[1:05:47] towards
[1:05:52] somebody remember God said L the root of
[1:05:55] of bitterness springing up defile
[1:06:00] you the word defile here with a word
[1:06:03] bitter it means difficult to accept
[1:06:05] admit or bear proceeding from strong
[1:06:08] animosity resulting from severe grief
[1:06:11] anguish or
[1:06:13] disappointment defile means to lower in
[1:06:16] character quality or value the pess or
[1:06:20] Excellency the Excellency of it says to
[1:06:23] make unclean or unfit for ceremonial
[1:06:28] use huh when you have a spirit of
[1:06:32] bitterness a spirit that brings about a
[1:06:35] a root of bitterness in your heart
[1:06:36] towards somebody or
[1:06:39] something you make
[1:06:41] yourself
[1:06:42] unusable by the Holy
[1:06:45] Spirit that's what the devil want he
[1:06:48] want to hinder the body he want to
[1:06:50] divide the body he want to have us
[1:06:52] divided and all kind of anger and all
[1:06:55] kind of just evil dark Spirits just able
[1:06:58] to have their way freely among us but
[1:07:01] the light of God comes down to cast The
[1:07:04] Darkness out and fill the body with
[1:07:08] light that's what he's here to do right
[1:07:10] now so as our heads are bowed and our
[1:07:12] eyes are
[1:07:13] closed if you need to forgive anybody if
[1:07:17] you've been having a difficult time
[1:07:19] letting a particular situation go no
[1:07:21] matter how far go it's happened or what
[1:07:24] have you and and you found yourself uh
[1:07:27] avoiding people because of how badly
[1:07:30] they've hurt you or how they've treated
[1:07:32] you they might be absolutely wrong but
[1:07:35] you don't have to be a wrong you don't
[1:07:37] have to be wrong along with
