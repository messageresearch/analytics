[0:00] I asked them before they started. I
[0:01] said, "Did anybody hear a good sermon on
[0:03] Leodysia lately?" And nobody raised
[0:05] their hand. So I thought, "Well, that's
[0:06] good." And then uh I said, "How many
[0:09] have read the church age book?" And only
[0:11] one person raised their hand. I thought,
[0:12] "Oh my, I hope our church has read the
[0:15] church age book." Hallelujah.
[0:17] Hallelujah. If you haven't, please do.
[0:19] It'd be a a tremendous strength to you,
[0:21] tremendous help uh by God's grace. But
[0:24] Revelation 3 14, we'll just read that
[0:27] one verse.
[0:30] Then just have your Bibles handy. We'll
[0:32] start with a number of uh simple verses
[0:34] here just to kind of lay a a groundwork.
[0:39] So, Revelation 3:14. If you're there,
[0:41] say, "Amen."
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Let's read this together. Ready? 1 2 3.
[0:45] And unto the angel of the church of the
[0:48] Leodysans, write these things, saith the
[0:51] Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
[0:55] beginning of the creation of God. May
[0:57] God add his blessing to the ring of his
[0:58] word. You can be seated here tonight uh
[1:00] by God's grace.
[1:03] Now, I'll just do a basic overview here.
[1:05] Kind of what I preached there. And um
[1:09] if you have your Bibles, you can go to
[1:10] Ephesians chapter 2:7. Uh just let just
[1:14] lay this fact again. You know, if you if
[1:16] you listen to people Well, Sister Lena
[1:17] and Brother Austin here tonight. God
[1:18] bless you. We were just praying for you,
[1:20] sister. Hallelujah. So, God bless you.
[1:24] Kind of surprised. Amen. Glad you're
[1:26] here. Amen.
[1:28] Ephesians 2:7. Uh, if you ever get any
[1:31] push back on church ages, it's because
[1:33] people don't read the Bible or they got
[1:34] a bad Bible translation. Uh, just
[1:37] because, let's just review this real
[1:38] quick. Ephesians 2:7, that in the ages
[1:41] to come, he might show the exceeding
[1:44] riches of his grace in his kindness
[1:46] toward us through Christ Jesus. So, this
[1:48] verse speaks of future ages. Actually,
[1:51] this would probably be in the future
[1:52] home, New Jerusalem, where God will take
[1:55] one age. and he'll show us all of his
[1:57] kindness for we'd say the Ephesian
[1:58] church age. Or maybe we'll start maybe
[2:00] he'll start with the Old Testament
[2:01] saints and he'll take a whole and he'll
[2:03] show all look at all this kindness to
[2:04] Enoch and Noah and Seth. Look at all and
[2:07] we'll just rejoice and be like, "Praise
[2:09] God, brother Chris. Look what God did
[2:10] for these people who didn't even own a
[2:12] Bible." All right? They they didn't even
[2:14] have a Bible, right? But then we'll get
[2:16] to our age and church. That'll be the
[2:17] time where we'll see the angels were
[2:19] encamped around us. It was the most
[2:21] deceptive time there ever was. And yet
[2:23] the Holy Ghost was here to keep us from
[2:25] falling. Praise God. Amen. As we see
[2:28] with all the uh persecution on
[2:30] Christians, we'll say, "Thank God. Look
[2:31] at the angel of the Lord protecting all
[2:33] of us." How many glad he protects us?
[2:35] Hallelujah. So thankful for it. So this
[2:37] is speaking of future ages. Now the next
[2:39] chapter, chapter 3:5,
[2:42] which in other ages was not made known
[2:45] unto the sons of men, as it is now
[2:47] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[2:50] prophets by the spirit.
[2:53] Okay? So, uh, this is speaking of past
[2:55] ages. Now, this this chapter three is
[2:58] speaking of the mystery of the Jew and
[3:00] Gentile church as one body. That's okay,
[3:03] buddy. Can you keep that on there? Thank
[3:06] you, sir. No problem. was probably just
[3:08] a habit. Is this a Christmas service?
[3:10] Amen.
[3:12] Hallelujah.
[3:14] Amen. Well, you know, we had the
[3:15] thunder. We have thunder sometimes and
[3:17] all kinds of things. That that wouldn't
[3:19] be no problem at all just to preach. As
[3:20] long as I got a battery here, I can see
[3:22] my notes.
[3:25] So, in other ages was not was not made
[3:27] known unto the sons of men as is now
[3:29] revealed unto his holy pro apostles and
[3:31] prophets by the spirit. So, this is
[3:32] speaking of past ages. So, we have
[3:34] future ages, past ages. say in that same
[3:36] chapter 3 chapter or chapter 3 verse 21
[3:40] unto him be glory in the church by Jesus
[3:42] Christ throughout all ages world without
[3:44] end. So remember, even after the
[3:46] tribulation and the the millennium and
[3:47] the future home, this world will never
[3:50] be destroyed. It'll just be renovated
[3:52] and then given some type of eternal
[3:53] quality, right? Because the Bible says
[3:56] the world will have no end. Now, that's
[3:59] hard for us to understand, right? Uh but
[4:01] perhaps maybe like brother said, maybe
[4:03] we'll go create another uh planet and go
[4:05] live on it somewhere down the line. Who
[4:07] knows? I mean, the the possibilities are
[4:09] endless, right? With eternal life,
[4:11] they're they're endless. literally
[4:13] endless. Uh, and then Colossians 1:26.
[4:17] So, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.
[4:19] So, just turn a few pages there. These
[4:21] are short books. So, Brother Chris, if
[4:24] anybody would say, "Oh, there's no ages
[4:25] in the Bible." You just haven't read the
[4:27] right Bible version, right? That's what
[4:29] you would say because the Bible says
[4:30] there's past ages, there's future ages.
[4:33] Well, that must mean there's ages now
[4:35] because there's no verse that says,
[4:37] "Well, there'll be no ages during the
[4:38] church ages." There's no verse that says
[4:40] that. Okay? It'd be foolish to say that.
[4:43] Okay. Colossians 1:26. Even the mystery
[4:46] which has been hid from ages and from
[4:48] generations, but is now made manifest to
[4:50] his saints. This is speaking of the
[4:51] mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[4:52] Ghost, Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[4:56] Okay. Now, if you got your Bible, go to
[4:58] Revelation 3. Let's preach down through
[4:59] this. Now, what I did, uh, I basically,
[5:01] uh, just preach every verse,
[5:04] and I'll I'll tell you which ones I
[5:06] spent the most time on here, uh, by
[5:08] God's grace. I think I preach about hour
[5:10] and a half. I have to check. I did
[5:12] upload the sermon. If anybody wants to
[5:13] listen to it, let me know. But I just
[5:14] made it unlisted because before I preach
[5:17] there or before I post something there,
[5:18] I like to go through and take out
[5:20] anything personal that I don't want the
[5:21] whole internet to hear because believe
[5:23] me, I'm going to hear from people if I
[5:25] say something personal just because
[5:26] there's a lot of It's just sad. Some
[5:28] haters just watch our services just to
[5:30] criticize me or just to email me or text
[5:33] me. But that just kind of goes along
[5:35] with it. Uh and it's very small
[5:37] persecution, right? Which nothing like
[5:39] other people are going through. But just
[5:40] it's just one of those things I just
[5:42] like to take out personal things. So I
[5:45] haven't had the chance to do that. Uh
[5:46] verse 14. And unto the angel of the
[5:48] church of Leodysans, write. Okay. Now
[5:51] this was a literal letter John wrote to
[5:54] a pastor in Leodysia, but it had a
[5:57] prophetic meaning that this angel was
[6:00] not just a pastor or bishop in the city
[6:02] of Leodysia, but this was also spoken to
[6:05] God's prophet, brother William Brandom.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. This was a a letter. This was a a
[6:10] scripture he would pick up and he would
[6:12] give the revelation of it with thus
[6:14] sayeth the Lord.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh it's amazing to think
[6:18] about that. Um and of course this angel
[6:20] is not a heavenly angel. Why would God
[6:22] tell John to write an angel that lives
[6:24] in the city of Leodysia? That makes no
[6:27] sense. So this angel has to be a man.
[6:30] Hallelujah. Uh because God doesn't save
[6:33] uh men by angel preaching. He saves it
[6:36] by men preaching. But then he calls them
[6:38] angels at times. Hallelujah. So unto the
[6:42] church, I'm sorry, unto the angel of the
[6:43] church of Leoans, right? Faithful, I'm
[6:46] sorry. Say these things sayith the amen.
[6:48] Now, now and this, as brother Simon
[6:49] preached to us wonderfully a couple
[6:51] weeks ago, Jesus gives his deity in this
[6:54] verse. This is the final description of
[6:56] his deity. And this lines up with what
[6:58] he said, excuse me, in Revelation
[7:00] chapter 1.
[7:02] He's called the amen. Now, the amen is
[7:04] the stamp. It's the approval. It's the
[7:06] so be it. Whatever was said before this,
[7:09] whatever was sung before that, amen says
[7:11] let it happen. In other words, I agree.
[7:14] So Jesus is letting them know I'm the
[7:16] amen. I give the final approval. If
[7:19] anything said before this and and I say
[7:22] amen, whatever God says amen to, it's
[7:24] going to happen.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; That's deity. Amen. Deity is the only
[7:27] one that can say amen. Hallelujah.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. In other words, men and
[7:31] women, they can boast about tomorrow.
[7:33] They can boast about this or that. But
[7:34] no man knows the day or the hour of the
[7:36] coming of the Lord. Do you see that
[7:37] preacher in South Africa who missed the
[7:39] rapture again? I told these people, I
[7:41] said, "Don't think anything of it." Now,
[7:44] do I get nervous when that happens? Of
[7:45] course, because I don't want to miss the
[7:46] rapture. But when I stop and think about
[7:48] like, I've seen so many people miss
[7:49] this, right? It's just complete
[7:51] nonsense. And what do they do? They just
[7:53] move the goalpost and they're going to
[7:54] miss that one. They're going to move the
[7:56] goalpost and it just becomes a bunch of
[7:58] uh guessing. It it's a it's a fear uh
[8:01] factor or it's a it's an expression of
[8:03] pride. This person is trying to be
[8:04] prideful. Brother Chris, did you have a
[8:05] question?
[8:09] &gt;&gt; October.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; Yep. Right. Right. But he didn't say
[8:13] that before. Before. Right. Right. You
[8:14] know what I'm talking about. So, I'm
[8:16] talking I'm just criticizing him. I'm
[8:17] not criticizing you. He was just saying,
[8:19] "Thank you. I didn't I want you to feel
[8:20] bad. I'm not criticizing." U But that's
[8:23] that's the thing with false prophets.
[8:25] Now, they move the goalpost. Before
[8:27] Before it was the God Lord God Almighty
[8:29] told me September 23rd or 24th. Now, I
[8:32] could get the dates wrong, but I'm just
[8:33] trying to quote and remember what he
[8:34] said. So, they're liars. The Bible said
[8:37] they're not prophets. They're speaking
[8:39] of their own imagination. God never
[8:41] talked to him.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; So, he said he saw Jesus. He didn't. He
[8:45] saw Satan m uh disguised as Jesus
[8:48] because Jesus doesn't lie.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Right? We've seen it. Like I told you
[8:51] that story. Remember I told you that
[8:52] story? It was 2011. I walk into my
[8:55] office. I'm a teacher on a Friday
[8:56] afternoon and my principal is sitting
[8:58] there at the secretary's desk. He's a
[9:00] homosexual. And he's sitting there and
[9:02] he he didn't even look at me. He's just
[9:03] staring at the screen. He said, "Well,
[9:04] the rapture is supposed to be tomorrow."
[9:06] And I wasn't ready for this. But I just
[9:08] looked at him and said, "Oh, no. No.
[9:09] That guy's hero camping. He's a false
[9:11] prophet." Jesus said, "No man knows the
[9:13] day or the hour." I said, "You don't
[9:14] have to worry about that."
[9:17] Right? And who was right, Harold Camping
[9:19] or Brother Jesse?
[9:21] Well, Brother Jesse because he wasn't
[9:23] given the dates. But I knew liars like
[9:26] that always, they're always wrong.
[9:28] They're always going to be ashamed and
[9:30] uh disappointed, right? Disappointing
[9:33] people. People sold their homes. People
[9:34] sold their cars. Uh people left things
[9:38] for, you know, their loved ones. Do this
[9:40] during the tribulation. All these
[9:41] things. It's church. It's called the
[9:43] blind leading the blind. And church,
[9:45] that's why I'm so happy I can stand back
[9:47] and say I I'm not just guessing. I've
[9:49] got thus sayeth the Lord from a real
[9:51] prophet of God. as far as the age we're
[9:53] living in, the time we're living in, and
[9:55] even about uh date setting, and
[9:57] everything like that, we've got thus
[9:59] sayeth the word of God. Hallelujah. And
[10:00] how many times did Brother Ram say 1977,
[10:03] I have nothing on it from the Lord. It's
[10:04] just my thought. And and then he showed
[10:06] us his math in Daniel 70 weeks, 1961. He
[10:09] just showed us his math. But then
[10:11] there's quotes after that. He says, I
[10:12] could be 50 years off. He said a 100. He
[10:14] said, "I could be 500 years off
[10:17] &gt;&gt; because no man knows the day or the
[10:19] hour."
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Right? Just the humility uh of brother
[10:23] random. But these false prophets, the
[10:24] Bible said they'll be all exposed in
[10:26] their own folly, their own shame and
[10:28] folly will make them exposed. Okay. Now,
[10:31] so we see the angel to our church age
[10:33] was William Brandon. But Jesus says he's
[10:36] the amen. He's the faithful and true
[10:38] witness. Hallelujah.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; He's faithful because everything he was
[10:42] told by God, he preached it. He said,
[10:45] "My doctrine is not my own. I got my
[10:47] doctrine from my father." Amen.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's faithful witness. He
[10:51] went He was He started in heaven. Glory.
[10:54] He came down to earth. He went down to
[10:56] hell and he defeated hell and he
[10:57] ascended on high. And he went back to
[10:59] heaven. He's a witness who's been to
[11:01] heaven, hell, and earth. And he
[11:03] conquered death, hell, and the grave.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; That's a witness we can trust.
[11:07] Hallelujah. And demons tremble at the
[11:09] name of Jesus Christ.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; When it's spoken with faith. Hallelujah.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. So, he's the
[11:16] faithful and true witness. He witnessed
[11:18] all these things. He was there when the
[11:19] earth was founded. Amen. Hallelujah. He
[11:21] was there before Lucifer was there.
[11:23] Hallelujah. He'll be there after Lucifer
[11:25] is gone. Amen.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. He's the faithful witness.
[11:29] And brother Ram uses this the final
[11:31] thing. The beginning of the creation of
[11:32] God. This final detail, brother Ram says
[11:35] there's two parts to it. Jesus was the
[11:37] creation of the logos. So the light that
[11:40] came out of the invisible one, that was
[11:42] Jesus as creation, right? Because a son
[11:44] came out of the father. He said, "But
[11:46] also when when the Holy Ghost
[11:48] overshadowed the womb of Mary and
[11:50] created a new human race, hallelujah, a
[11:53] sinless race, amen, a super race."
[11:56] Hallelujah.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; And so that was the beginning of a new
[11:59] creation, a God man. Thank Thank the
[12:02] Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. A God man, the
[12:04] only God man. Hallelujah. The Lord Jesus
[12:07] Christ. Now, we'll be given, of course,
[12:10] glorified bodies. We'll be given we got
[12:12] the we got a portion of that now the
[12:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost. But we'll
[12:16] always remember we sinned. But Jesus
[12:19] never sinned. Hallelujah.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; That's why we'll all even in heaven with
[12:23] their theophony bodies, the theophony
[12:25] body never sin. Think about that. The
[12:27] theophony body never sinned. Yet the
[12:28] Bible said the 24 elders remember that
[12:31] they were redeemed.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; So they remember I was I was a sinner at
[12:36] some point, but now I'm a saint.
[12:37] Hallelujah. and now I've got a theophony
[12:40] body and now I'll never sin again and
[12:42] they fall on their faces thanking God
[12:44] that Jesus redeemed them from their
[12:47] sinful lives.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Now the reason I preach that church is
[12:50] because they're believe it or not there
[12:51] are message preachers. I've seen them
[12:53] online. They say that Jesus second
[12:55] coming uh is greater than his first
[12:58] coming. Now there I don't have any
[13:00] quotes from brother Brandham on that.
[13:02] But church think what they're saying.
[13:04] They're saying the God in us, the Holy
[13:06] Ghost as a portion in us is greater than
[13:09] when Jesus came. Now imagine that. Now,
[13:12] to me, that's a foolish thing to say.
[13:14] They're basically saying we're greater
[13:16] than Jesus. That to me, that's what
[13:17] they're saying. Friends, we have the
[13:20] Holy Ghost, and yes, the pillar of fire
[13:21] might come among us and do mighty things
[13:23] and wonderful things, but church, we've
[13:26] all sinned.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came the first time, there
[13:30] was no sin. And the church said,
[13:33] &gt;&gt; "But see that's and that's what
[13:34] preachers, message preachers are trying
[13:36] to uh elevate the people." Well, you're
[13:38] uh you're this is a greater coming
[13:40] because God's in you and God Yes, God's
[13:43] in us to a measure, but God was in
[13:46] Christ in the fullness of God.
[13:48] Hallelujah.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; And Jesus never sinned. And Jesus only
[13:52] did that which pleased the father.
[13:54] Hallelujah. Amen.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised how many people
[13:58] standing up in me churches shouting,
[14:00] rejoicing, and then what what does it
[14:02] produce? Pride. That's what it produces.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; A prideful attitude.
[14:07] And I don't doubt the second coming is
[14:09] going to be amazing. Look at I mean, how
[14:11] many people around the world people
[14:12] around the world will be changed in a
[14:14] moment, Twink and I? But we're still
[14:16] sinners saved by grace.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; And we still can't do it by on our own.
[14:20] There's nothing great about us. It's the
[14:22] great God that we serve. Hallelujah.
[14:24] But to make it somehow that this coming
[14:26] is greater than that one, friends, you
[14:28] got to you got to do some mental
[14:29] gymnastics.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; You got to do some sinful gymnastics.
[14:32] I'll say it like that. Brother Ram said
[14:35] the greatest message ever was he said it
[14:37] twice was the shepherd saying Emmanuel's
[14:40] here. Brother Ram said there's the
[14:41] greatest message ever. And then he said
[14:43] the greatest message that ever could be
[14:45] was the message on the day of the
[14:46] resurrection. He is risen. Hallelujah.
[14:51] Amen. Jesus defeated death and hell and
[14:54] he rose and that proved death could not
[14:57] hold him. And if that's the case, then
[14:59] death can't hold us. Hallelujah.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; But he was the one who started. He's the
[15:04] first fruits. Amen. He's God in flesh
[15:07] and we're not even close to his level.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; We're infinitely below his level.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Good. I like those amens. Thank you. If
[15:15] not, I was going to say, church, are we
[15:16] prideful here tonight or something? Do I
[15:18] need to preach on pride tonight?
[15:20] Hallelujah. Thank God. Amen. I'm not
[15:22] going to be deceived by these liars.
[15:24] Amen. Now, they might not do it on
[15:26] purpose. I don't know. But I'm not going
[15:28] to take a lie like that. Now, that's
[15:31] just verse 14. Now, 15. I know thy works
[15:34] that thou art neither hot nor cold. I
[15:36] would thou were cold or hot.
[15:40] Okay, so the works of Leodysia.
[15:43] Uh now remember, he's talking to both
[15:45] churches during the the these letters.
[15:47] Jesus speaks to the false vine and the
[15:50] true vine.
[15:52] Now, when he says this, he's not
[15:54] speaking to the true vine. He's speaking
[15:57] to the uh he's speaking to the false
[16:00] vine, right?
[16:03] See, he's not speaking because uh can
[16:05] you imagine, brother Brandham, would he
[16:07] be called lukewarm? No, of course not.
[16:10] How about these brothers and sisters
[16:11] that have hazarded their lives for the
[16:13] Holy Ghost, put their lives, been
[16:14] arrested, put in jail for the baptism of
[16:16] the Holy Ghost in this in these last 125
[16:19] years or so since the church age has
[16:21] been going on. People that have
[16:23] sacrificed so much. Of course, they're
[16:26] not uh lukewarm. He's speaking to the
[16:28] false vine here. Now, look at verse 16.
[16:31] Now, before I say that, brother Random
[16:33] said Jesus had no compliment for this
[16:36] church age. In other words, the majority
[16:38] of people are lukewarm or cold in this
[16:40] church age.
[16:42] This is not the age of the open door. So
[16:44] if you just look previous in the
[16:49] look look in uh chapter 3:8, it says, "I
[16:52] know thy works. Behold, I've set the
[16:54] open door." That was the missionary age
[16:55] of the Leoian church age. And no man
[16:57] could shut it for thou hast a little
[16:59] strength. Now look at the nice words
[17:00] Jesus says to Philadelphia. You have a
[17:02] little strength
[17:04] and has kept my word and has not denied
[17:06] my name. Church, does he say that about
[17:08] Leodysia? Let's read our Bible. Does
[17:10] Jesus give any compliment to Leodysia?
[17:12] Church, that proves very few people are
[17:15] going to be hot and on fire. Let's make
[17:17] sure we're one of them.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; That's why I wanted Brother Rod. I know
[17:20] he's not a message believer, but he he
[17:22] loves Brother Random, but that's why I
[17:24] wanted him to testify to show that's how
[17:25] he got his work stirred up, and that's
[17:27] how he keeps his life on fire. keeps his
[17:29] life pure for five decades
[17:33] because he prays, fasts, prays extra on
[17:36] the weekend,
[17:38] &gt;&gt; right? Reads extra on the weekend and
[17:40] will get up at 3:50 to go into work at
[17:43] six o'clock. That's dedication, church.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; That's spiritual uh that's spiritual
[17:48] warfare. Taking his life seriously
[17:50] before God. Now again, we know it's not
[17:53] by works, but I'm telling you I what I
[17:55] want I want to learn from that and I
[17:57] want you to learn from that is that we
[17:58] need to go to greater lengths to get
[18:00] spiritual victories.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Does that sound okay?
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Any false doctrine in there?
[18:08] Now, I want you to see that. Remember
[18:10] friends, brother Brandham even had Lee
[18:12] Vale preach at his church even before he
[18:14] baptized him. It's on tape. and and
[18:17] brother Neville if I'm not mistaken
[18:19] because brother Ram saw something in
[18:21] them right so what do I see in brother
[18:22] Rod a love for holiness
[18:25] everybody see that cousin Adam not a
[18:28] preacher but what do I see in him I see
[18:30] victory
[18:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[18:33] amen
[18:35] I gave everybody our chance to we gave
[18:38] almost everybody a chance to do the
[18:39] podcast right so I think we we might
[18:41] want to do a couple more I don't know if
[18:42] Zer wants to do one or brother Chris or
[18:44] but we can definitely talk about that I
[18:45] I beg sister Beatress, I begged her. I'm
[18:49] just kidding. Try to make you laugh.
[18:52] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, look, Jesus don't
[18:55] give one compliment. And brother says,
[18:58] uh, Jesus has nothing good to say about
[18:59] this church age as a whole. Now, as a
[19:01] whole,
[19:03] but don't think, brother Bam wasn't on
[19:04] fire. No, he was hot and on fire. And
[19:06] now, church, one of these Sundays, I
[19:08] want to bring out all these quotes.
[19:09] Brother Bram says, "I need a revival in
[19:11] my life. I'm struggling. I need a
[19:14] revival." I want to bring these quotes
[19:15] out here pretty soon, Lord willing. I
[19:17] want you to see that he went through
[19:19] things just like you and I go through
[19:20] things. In fact, one of the sisters come
[19:23] up for prayer on Sunday and I'll just
[19:25] remind you. Um she come up and said,
[19:28] "Brother Jesse, I feel lukewarm." I
[19:29] said, "Okay, sister." She's crying. I
[19:31] said, "That's understandable." I said,
[19:32] "Now, let me ask you, are you baptized
[19:34] with the Holy Ghost?" And she said,
[19:35] "Yes, I believe I am." I said, "Well,
[19:37] then let me go get my Bible." So, I went
[19:39] and got my Bible and I showed her the
[19:41] verse. If the seed of God is in you,
[19:43] what what does it do with sin? Does it
[19:44] sin or not sin? The seed of God cannot
[19:49] sin.
[19:50] The soul that's baptized with the Holy
[19:52] Ghost can never sin. So I showed her,
[19:55] "Your soul can never sin. Your soul can
[19:58] never be lukewarm." I preached that to
[19:59] you maybe, I think two years ago, I
[20:00] think, if I'm not mistaken. And she
[20:02] started crying, rejoicing, and praising
[20:03] God. I said, "What you need to do is
[20:05] transform your mind. That's where you
[20:08] need a revival." We all get though
[20:10] tired. We all get lukewarm in our minds.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; So, I thought that was a great reminder.
[20:14] I thought the Holy Spirit kind of
[20:16] quickened that to me to answer her
[20:17] question on the lukewarm. I hadn't
[20:19] thought about that for months, maybe a
[20:20] year or two. Uh, but I felt that was a
[20:23] good inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
[20:25] Now, look at verse 15. He don't say
[20:27] nothing good. He said, I just wish you
[20:29] were hot or cold. Verse 16. So then,
[20:32] because thou are lukewarm and neither
[20:33] cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my
[20:35] mouth. So, not even a little strength in
[20:37] the ley and church age. And these
[20:39] brothers call themselves the greatest of
[20:40] all time.
[20:42] Think about that, Sister Beatric. They
[20:44] call themselves the greatest preachers
[20:45] of all time. They just said it again
[20:47] last Sunday. I heard it. I recorded it
[20:49] again. And Jesus don't have one thing
[20:51] good to say about this church age.
[20:56] I'm like, what message are you listening
[20:57] to that I don't know? That's right.
[20:59] That's not on tape. You must be just
[21:01] creating that in your own mind
[21:04] because I never found that.
[21:07] Now I will spew thee out of my mouth. So
[21:11] Jesus says in this church age most of
[21:14] the churches are going to get spewed out
[21:16] of his mouth. Now what does that mean?
[21:18] Rejected from his body. And brother Ram
[21:20] specifically says they're no longer the
[21:21] mouthpiece of God. Brother Chris
[21:27] Exactly. Yep. Give them two class. Yep.
[21:29] Exactly. Yes. Exactly. There. See,
[21:32] they're rejected from the body just like
[21:34] their worship makes that that uh
[21:36] iniquity makes Jesus sick to his
[21:37] stomach. Brother Ram says as like a a
[21:40] parable. Great, brother. Great. But now
[21:43] what I showed now, what I spent most of
[21:45] my time, I'm not going to be able to do
[21:46] it here tonight, but what I spent most
[21:47] of my time on uh Sunday or part of my
[21:50] time was saying, did this ever happen
[21:52] before? Did God ever spew
[21:55] uh something out of his mouth before?
[21:57] And the answer is yes.
[22:00] The answer is yes. He does this before.
[22:02] Luke 18:27 if you got your Bible. Uh 27
[22:04] and 28 in case you I'm probably not
[22:06] going to be able to turn there. Have to
[22:08] go kind of fast.
[22:10] Sorry, not Luke. Leviticus. Sorry.
[22:12] Forgive me. Mercy, Lord. Let me slow
[22:15] down, Lord. I'm always in a hurry. I'm
[22:16] always Leviticus 18:27 and 28.
[22:21] There it is. Thank you. For all these
[22:22] abominations have the men of the land
[22:25] done which were before you, and the land
[22:27] is defiled. Now speaking of this is
[22:28] speaking of adultery, abortion,
[22:31] drunkenness, idol worship, child
[22:34] sacrifice that the land spew not you out
[22:39] also when you defile it as it spewed out
[22:42] of the nations that were before you. And
[22:44] the turf said, now the land represents
[22:47] Christ, right? Because remember Israel
[22:50] was uh out of Egypt, wilderness,
[22:53] promised land. So what does that
[22:54] represent? Justification, sanification,
[22:56] baptism, Holy Ghost. When you get the
[22:57] Holy Ghost, you're a part of Christ.
[22:59] Amen. You're a part of the family.
[23:01] Hallelujah. But see, this this was a
[23:04] foreshadow. You This land will spew you
[23:07] out. The promised land. Amen. The
[23:09] promised land will spew you out if you
[23:11] don't keep the word of God. And that's
[23:14] exactly what happened in Leodysia.
[23:16] God spews Methodists, Baptist,
[23:19] Presbyterian, and even some message
[23:21] churches, right? He spews them out of
[23:22] his mouth because of their defilement of
[23:25] the name of Christ.
[23:27] They defile the holy, the precious name
[23:30] of Jesus Christ. But we don't defile. We
[23:33] love it. Hallelujah. Amen. We honor with
[23:35] our lives. We give Jesus the glory with
[23:38] our lives.
[23:39] We live pure lives. How many live pure
[23:41] lives for the glory of God? Amen.
[23:46] That's right. Now, the other one uh is
[23:48] Isaiah 28. Now, I'm gonna have to give
[23:51] you the
[23:54] the verse. I think it's 288, but I could
[23:58] be wrong.
[23:59] That one I forgot to write down when I
[24:01] was studying today.
[24:03] I know where it is, of course.
[24:07] Now, it's verse 8. Yeah. 288. For all
[24:09] the tables are full of vomit and
[24:10] filthiness, so that there is no place
[24:12] clean. Now, this was written by Isaiah,
[24:16] and it was rebuking pride. So, that's
[24:18] why these brothers that call themselves
[24:19] greatest of all time, I just got I don't
[24:21] know if they're born again or not. That
[24:23] that'll be up to God. But surely pride
[24:26] goes before a fall. Surely without a
[24:29] doubt. But look at verse one. Woe unto
[24:31] the crown of pride to the drunkers of
[24:33] Ephraim. Look at verse three. The crown
[24:35] of pride. The drunkards of Ephraim shall
[24:37] be trotten under feet.
[24:39] Okay, so pride. Look at verse seven. But
[24:42] they also have through wine through
[24:43] strong drink are out of the way. The
[24:45] priest and the prophet have through the
[24:47] strong drink. They're swallowed up wine.
[24:49] They are out of the way through strong
[24:51] drink. They heir in vision. They stumble
[24:53] in judgment. They don't judge things
[24:55] right. You would think, oh well, they
[24:56] would judge this right. This is easy to
[24:58] see. But they miss that. They get it
[24:59] wrong. They judge a situation the wrong
[25:01] way because of pride.
[25:04] Right? Now, also this was written in the
[25:06] days of uh numerous kings. I want to go
[25:09] through that so you can see it uh by
[25:11] God's grace.
[25:13] Remember during this time Isaiah's
[25:15] prophecy, there was two parts to the
[25:16] king. There was northern Israel,
[25:18] southern Israel. Everybody say amen.
[25:20] Okay. Now in northern Israel, all the
[25:22] kings rejected this. It was Jeroboam II,
[25:24] Zechariah, Shalom, Menahhem, Peekaniah
[25:28] or Peekah, Epic, and Hosa. All there was
[25:32] never a good northern king because they
[25:35] didn't have Jerusalem. They didn't have
[25:37] the temple of God, right? God's provided
[25:39] place of worship. Amen. Hallelujah. They
[25:41] didn't have they didn't have the place
[25:42] where God put his put his name there.
[25:44] God only put his name in the temple in
[25:47] Solomon's day. And God only put his name
[25:49] today in Jesus Christ.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:53] Now, but there were some kings of the
[25:55] southern uh part J Judah or Judea and
[25:58] they accepted this word. The first was
[26:01] Uzziah. He was good just to the end
[26:02] where he got that leprosy tried to be a
[26:04] priest. Okay. Uh and then Jotham was an
[26:08] average king. He was okay. Ahaz was a
[26:12] very bad king. But then Hezekiah was a
[26:15] great king. Not the best, but one of the
[26:17] one of the best. So when Isaiah's letter
[26:20] went out, it was a rebuke. All these uh
[26:23] all these kings with these false
[26:25] prophets and lie and pride all their
[26:28] spiritual tables were like vomit to God.
[26:30] Think of that.
[26:33] Imagine church when we come up. Imagine
[26:35] I think we have the Lord's supper next
[26:37] month. Imagine if it was covered. Now
[26:39] just imagine if it was covered in such
[26:41] filth as that. Would you want to drink
[26:43] from that table? But God said that's
[26:46] what it's like now church. That's what
[26:48] it's like. You've been there. That's
[26:50] what it's like spiritually today in many
[26:51] denominational churches where they let
[26:54] women preach, right? Or they let
[26:55] homosexuals be ministers and all these
[26:57] things. It's as if when they come for
[26:58] the communion, there's vomit all over.
[27:02] Just think of that thought for a moment.
[27:04] And then we ought to be so thankful if
[27:06] we can come to church and we have a
[27:07] clean communion table. Praise God. I'm
[27:09] talking spiritually. Praise God.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. I try to wipe that off and try to
[27:13] prepare it. I try to wash the cup and
[27:15] everything. We try to do uh get the wine
[27:17] prepared and everything, but what we
[27:19] want is a spiritually clean table
[27:22] because there's going to be very few of
[27:24] them.
[27:26] Right now, for time sake,
[27:31] um
[27:33] the vomit group, I'll just say like
[27:35] that. Vomit group is like the Judas's
[27:36] scar group, right? Or the group in
[27:38] Matthew 7, uh the workers of iniquity.
[27:41] That's the That's the vomit group or
[27:43] that's the uh lukewarm group.
[27:46] Uh now what what's interesting though is
[27:48] that foolish virgins can still be saved,
[27:51] right?
[27:53] Uh but we would say they're not born
[27:55] again,
[27:56] right? They're not born again. So I
[27:58] don't know if they're in the body of
[27:59] Christ. U now but certainly they can
[28:01] witness and people can get saved, right?
[28:04] So so life does pass through them. So,
[28:06] I'm just letting you know I'm not I'm
[28:08] not certain on the foolish virgin in
[28:10] this uh in this portion here. I'm not
[28:12] sure where they would stand, right? We
[28:14] know they're not hot, but at the same
[28:17] time, we know they're we know most of
[28:18] their churches are spewed out like
[28:20] they're most of their churches are in
[28:22] bad shape, but yet then it would seem
[28:24] like on an individual level, they still
[28:26] are getting people saved. How do I know?
[28:28] Because I was saved in a denomination
[28:30] before I received the message. I was
[28:32] saved. I was living a brand new life.
[28:35] Hallelujah.
[28:36] I felt like I'd gone from death to life.
[28:38] I didn't even know there was all this
[28:40] holiness still left for me. Praise God.
[28:42] Hallelujah. I was pretty happy with no
[28:44] more Snoop Dogg and no more Metallica,
[28:45] Brother Austin, you know, no more
[28:48] cigarettes. You I thought it was pretty
[28:49] good by God's grace. But there was so
[28:51] much more. God was looking for a pure
[28:53] heart as well. Hallelujah.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Not just clean lungs, but a pure heart.
[28:57] Hallelujah.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; There was so much more. Now, for time
[29:04] sake, I'm going to skip ahead here. Now,
[29:06] verse, let's go back to Revelation.
[29:09] Well, yeah. Yeah. Let me just read this
[29:11] because I always struggle on Wednesday,
[29:13] didn't I? Um, go back to Revelation. But
[29:15] the book of Isaiah shows Isaiah's time
[29:18] period was a perfect type of Leodysa. In
[29:20] Isaiah 2:7, the Bible said they were
[29:22] full of silver and gold and idols. So,
[29:26] rich and increased with goods, full of
[29:28] silver and gold.
[29:30] the the time of Israel. They were rich
[29:32] in that time. And yet the tables on most
[29:34] of them were full of vomit.
[29:39] Remember Isaiah 3, those women had 21
[29:41] accessories. Man, they had high heels.
[29:43] They had this. They had that. They got
[29:45] they got everything. I mean, they got
[29:47] they got everything all the way down. 21
[29:49] different accessories.
[29:52] Brother made a joke. It's he said it's
[29:53] kind of like they went into the
[29:54] 10-centent store with magnets on and
[29:55] they just got all the They got all like
[29:58] everything just stuck to them. It's a
[30:00] little joke. It's a little crude, but
[30:01] it's it's about right. Right. That's
[30:03] about how deep spiritually they were.
[30:05] Right. I just put on in anything that
[30:07] makes me look different. Anything that
[30:08] will draw attention to me. You don't
[30:09] want your attention on yourself. You
[30:11] want your attention on Christ.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. In Isaiah 589, the Bible
[30:17] said they went, they were joining house
[30:18] to house. In other words, they were land
[30:20] grabbing. They were trying to get their
[30:22] land and then by the next neighbor's
[30:23] land, the next neighbor's land, they
[30:24] were trying to house grab rich and
[30:26] increase with goods.
[30:29] Now, uh, rich and increases with goods.
[30:30] Now, let me read these facts. I'm about
[30:32] ready to, uh, tell you some fresh stats
[30:36] from the internet. Okay, chat. GTP, help
[30:38] me out here. What was the average life
[30:41] expectancy around 1900? So, the church
[30:43] age started in 1906. The average in the
[30:46] world was 32 years old. That was the
[30:48] average length of a life. In America
[30:52] though, in 1900, it was 47.
[30:55] in 1950. 50 years later, the worldwide
[30:58] average was 46. So it went up 14 years.
[31:01] Now the worldwide average
[31:04] uh is 73.
[31:07] So since 1900, it's more than doubled.
[31:10] Think about that. Rich and increase with
[31:13] goods. In the year two in the year 1900,
[31:16] based upon today's inflation, each
[31:18] person the average income per person was
[31:19] either two or $3,000. That's how much
[31:22] they made the whole year in 1900. In
[31:25] 1950, they made it up. They doubled it
[31:26] to about five grand. That's how much he
[31:29] remember sister Hattie, right? Brother
[31:31] Ram said she just made $200 a year
[31:34] selling her vegetables.
[31:36] $200 a year.
[31:40] And then yet God let her speak the word
[31:44] and let her children, her boys be saved
[31:46] right there with brother Brandham. $200
[31:49] off of farming. That's what she got. And
[31:51] she lived off it. So, she was well below
[31:54] the average. The average for 1950 was
[31:56] five grand. Well below.
[31:59] In 2024, the worldwide average was
[32:01] $17,000.
[32:04] Church, we're living large over here,
[32:07] right? So, we got to live more humble,
[32:08] right? So, in in roughly 124 years, uh
[32:13] the income multiplied almost nine times.
[32:16] And the Bible said this would be the age
[32:18] that's rich and increase with goods and
[32:21] has need of nothing.
[32:23] Hallelujah.
[32:27] All right. Revelation 3.
[32:31] Hope hopefully those facts uh there by
[32:33] God's grace, hopefully they expand your
[32:35] thinking a little bit like and hopefully
[32:36] the people listening too, especially the
[32:37] critics that they'll realize that that
[32:40] this has to be the Leosian church age.
[32:43] Hopefully, but probably just get
[32:44] criticism.
[32:47] Verse 17. Because thou sayest, I'm rich
[32:49] and increase with goods, and have need
[32:51] of nothing, and knowest not that thou
[32:52] art wretched and miserable, poor, blind,
[32:55] and naked.
[32:57] Think about that. And this is what I
[32:58] really dealt with the church there, too.
[33:00] Did you come here to church tonight
[33:02] saying, "I need something." Was that
[33:04] your attitude? Or it's like, "Well, I
[33:06] better come or else Brother Jesse's
[33:07] going to text me." Right. Or think I'm
[33:09] backslid or something like that. Right.
[33:11] Right. Or he's going to email me or he's
[33:13] going to call me after church if I don't
[33:14] come tonight. Why did you come tonight?
[33:17] The whole idea of Leo is we don't need
[33:20] more of God. We've got enough. But see,
[33:23] a person who's hot and on fire realizes,
[33:25] I need more of God.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Even after a long day of work, and the
[33:29] church said, even after a long week,
[33:32] even after lots of trials, even after
[33:34] lots of sicknesses, that's why I
[33:36] appreciate you coming tonight, brother
[33:37] and sister. Even after being sick all
[33:40] week, you can still go to the house of
[33:41] God said, "I need to hear God's word."
[33:43] Hallelujah. I want to worship the Lord.
[33:46] But the majority of the people say,
[33:48] "Well, I've got enough. I'm happy with
[33:50] that." So that's what I challenge the
[33:51] the Junction City Saints. Did you come
[33:53] here to church wanting something or you
[33:55] just come in here for spiritual duty?
[33:58] Brother Ram said, "If you just come for
[33:59] spiritual duty, it's time to go up to
[34:01] the altar." Right? It's time to repent.
[34:05] The Ram said, "As soon as you're doing
[34:07] something, just so people don't think
[34:08] you're backslid," he said, "you are
[34:09] backslid."
[34:11] I I can find the quote, but I don't have
[34:12] it in front of me. Now, of course, we
[34:15] want I want to live higher for brother
[34:16] Austin. I want to live higher for
[34:17] brother Chris and you all want to live
[34:18] higher for me. Right? So, we think about
[34:20] each other. I want to live higher for
[34:21] each and every all the sisters. We do,
[34:24] right? But we confess our sins and we
[34:26] ask God to give us strength for a new
[34:28] day. Hallelujah. And say, God, I need
[34:30] you today. I've got to read my Bible and
[34:32] pray today. As brother Rod said, I've
[34:34] got to find a day to fast this week
[34:36] &gt;&gt; so I can seek God and get more of God in
[34:38] my life.
[34:40] because I have need of God. The leosina
[34:42] attitude says I don't need anymore. I've
[34:44] got enough.
[34:46] As long as I got as long as I'm rich,
[34:48] increase with goods, I'm good. Now
[34:51] remember, who remembers what are the
[34:53] three what are the three evidences
[34:54] brother Ram says you're hot and on fire
[34:56] for Jesus? A fervent desire to please
[34:59] him, a passion to know his word, and a
[35:03] reaching out in the spirit
[35:07] that proves you're on fire. I've got a
[35:09] fervent desire. I want to please God. I
[35:11] want to know more of his word and I want
[35:13] to reach out and ask the Holy Spirit,
[35:14] move, Holy Spirit. Praise God.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; I'm aware of that. I want the spirit of
[35:19] God to move in my life. Move in the
[35:20] church. Move for my brothers. Move for
[35:22] my sisters. That's a good sign you're
[35:24] hot and on fire for Jesus.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't that beautiful? Oh my.
[35:29] I love how brother Am just breaks it
[35:30] down so simply.
[35:34] So, so Jesus says, "You're the one
[35:37] saying, "I'm rich and increased with
[35:38] goods. I don't have need of God." That's
[35:40] why he spewed them out of his mouth.
[35:42] They they they said, "Well, I've got all
[35:44] these things. I've got I don't need
[35:46] more. I don't have to go to the Bible
[35:48] study with Brother Jesse, right? I don't
[35:50] have to go to that message church." I'm
[35:51] talking about people that don't come
[35:52] here, you know? Oh, I so that's why I
[35:55] really respect some of my colleagues
[35:56] have come to church here before and I
[35:58] really respect them that'll actually
[35:59] make the effort to do it because most
[36:01] people say, "Well, I don't need more of
[36:02] that." Now, you keep praying for
[36:04] Brennan. I talked to Brennon this week.
[36:05] He said he wants to come back and Zion
[36:07] invited him back to church. You invited
[36:09] him last night. Remember Zion? You said,
[36:11] remember you told Brennan, you said,
[36:12] "You need to come back to church
[36:14] sometime." You remember that?
[36:16] Hallelujah. Amen. Little missionary.
[36:22] Hallelujah. Just keep praying for
[36:24] people. Hallelujah.
[36:26] So Jesus said because of your words. Now
[36:28] not definitely not going to be able to
[36:29] finish this. Now verse 18. Now here's
[36:32] the main point I want to get to. I'll
[36:33] probably just close with this here.
[36:36] Jesus says I counsel. So Jesus wants to
[36:39] give us some counseling here. Can I say
[36:42] it like this? Some marriage counseling.
[36:43] Because we're married to Christ. How
[36:44] many know that?
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus wants to give us some marriage
[36:47] counseling. Having any marriage trouble
[36:49] with your husband, Jesus? Time for some
[36:52] counseling. Hallelujah.
[36:55] He said, he said he can give you three
[36:57] things that will help you be hot and on
[36:59] fire. Right? Now, we gave the three
[37:01] descriptions, but these are three truths
[37:03] right here in the Bible.
[37:06] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[37:09] in the fire. Brother Ram says, "Gold is
[37:12] time-tested, Christlike character." Put
[37:14] up 1 Peter 1:7. I preached this
[37:17] recently. You'll be familiar with this.
[37:18] So Jesus says, "I want you to buy some
[37:20] gold that the trial your faith being
[37:23] more precious than that of gold that
[37:26] perishes though it's tried with fire."
[37:28] So when you go through a very difficult
[37:30] trial, saints, and you come out on the
[37:31] other side and you're still standing,
[37:33] now you've got some gold. Hallelujah.
[37:36] Amen. I didn't I didn't quit during this
[37:38] trial. This trial didn't just didn't end
[37:40] me. I came through this and now I've got
[37:42] a better understanding. Now I've got a
[37:44] more pure heart to serve God. Satan
[37:47] tried to take me down, but he couldn't
[37:49] because God was fighting for me.
[37:50] Hallelujah.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now I've been tested. I've
[37:55] been tested beyond what I could think.
[37:56] And by God's grace, he brought me
[37:58] through. And I've got gold. I've got
[38:01] character like Christ.
[38:06] The next one, I counsel thee to buy me
[38:08] white raignment that thou mayest be
[38:10] clothed. White raignment is uh
[38:12] Revelation 19.
[38:14] And I don't have the verse. I didn't
[38:15] write that one down.
[38:18] And this connects to the breastplate of
[38:19] righteousness as we preached last month
[38:22] as well because now we're in October.
[38:25] Revelation 19 might be verse nine. Let's
[38:28] see.
[38:30] Nope, it's verse eight.
[38:33] And to her, speaking of the the bride,
[38:35] the wife of the lamb, was granted that
[38:37] she should be arrayed in fine linen,
[38:38] clean and white. For the fine linen is
[38:41] the righteousness of saints.
[38:44] Hallelujah. So Jesus said, "Come to me
[38:46] and you can buy gold. I'll let you I'll
[38:49] sell you gold." Oh, the Lord's selling.
[38:52] The Lord's got a store. I want to be the
[38:53] first one there. Praise God. If they
[38:55] line up for iPhones, well, I really want
[38:57] to line up for some gold from Jesus.
[38:59] They used to line up around the corner.
[39:00] They don't do that anymore. Right. Jesus
[39:03] has a store and Jesus selling gold and
[39:06] he's selling white raignment. The white
[39:09] raignment is actually his righteousness
[39:11] that he gives to the believer.
[39:14] Hallelujah. Remember the breastplate of
[39:16] righteousness. So that protects your
[39:19] heart, right? Protects your feelings,
[39:21] your emotions. So other words, Jesus
[39:23] Jesus's uh righteousness protects your
[39:26] unrighteousness.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, I criticize you.
[39:30] You're guilty of that. You shouldn't
[39:32] have done that all those years ago. That
[39:33] can't strike my heart." Because Jesus
[39:35] righteousness forgave all that.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; His righteousness protects mine.
[39:40] Unrighteousness. I'll say it like that.
[39:42] Hallelujah. Praise God. I'm protected by
[39:44] the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He
[39:47] took on my sin. I became his
[39:50] righteousness.
[39:51] Right? Second Corinthians 5. Now, last
[39:53] one is the uh Isa.
[39:57] He says, "And anoint thine eyes with
[39:59] eyes that thou mayest see."
[40:03] Okay, now this is back in uh Ephesians.
[40:06] Go back to Ephesians.
[40:09] I got to look this one. I thought for
[40:10] sure I had
[40:13] written that down, but I must not.
[40:16] Ephesians 1:18. Sorry.
[40:20] Now, church, how many know the Bible has
[40:22] to interpret the Bible? So, these three
[40:25] things, gold, white linen, and uh is
[40:29] they have to be somewhere in the Bible,
[40:30] right? What does this mean? This is what
[40:32] it means. You have Christlike character.
[40:35] You have Jesus's own righteousness
[40:37] covering your unrighteousness. You're
[40:39] not dressed in your garments. You're
[40:41] dressed in his garments.
[40:43] And your eyes now have eyes on them.
[40:46] This morning I woke up with all that
[40:47] matter in my eyes. Right? That's what
[40:49] brother told the story about when he had
[40:50] matter in his eyes and his mom had to
[40:53] put grease on there. Raccoon
[40:55] grease. I'm talking about
[40:58] first. We're blessed. We're blessed.
[41:00] Nobody's put raccoon grease on me.
[41:03] And the eyes of your understanding being
[41:05] enlightened. So what does this mean? My
[41:07] eyes are light to do what? That you may
[41:09] know what is the hope of his calling. In
[41:11] other words, when your eyes are open,
[41:13] you see. You see what God is promising.
[41:16] You see the promises before you. And it
[41:18] gives you hope. Praise God. We're not
[41:20] wandering blindly in darkness. Our eyes
[41:23] have eyes out. We can see. Our hope is
[41:25] the rapture. Amen. Hallelujah. Whether
[41:28] we live to to get our body changed and
[41:30] meet him in the air or we go to the
[41:31] grave, we'll be the dead in Christ
[41:33] rising first. Praise God.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we die, we actually get a a
[41:37] greater blessing. We get to rise first.
[41:39] Amen. We get to see Jesus first.
[41:41] Hallelujah.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; And meet Jesus in the air. Praise God.
[41:48] That you may know the hope of his
[41:49] calling and the riches of the glory,
[41:52] hallelujah, of his inheritance in the
[41:54] saints. So now that your eyes are open,
[41:56] now I know I know the hope of being a
[41:58] Holy Ghost fil. And I've got a I got an
[42:01] understanding. Wow, we have such rich
[42:02] inheritance waiting for us.
[42:05] Hallelujah.
[42:08] Amen.
[42:13] Hallelujah. So, you buy these three
[42:14] things.
[42:17] Now, how do you buy? First Peter, I'm
[42:19] closing with this because I got about
[42:20] five minutes. First Peter, uh, 56 and 7.
[42:22] Pull up there. You've been a good
[42:24] audience tonight by God's grace. Love
[42:26] you. God bless you. Appreciate
[42:28] everybody's paying attention.
[42:30] I had to ask him Sunday about three
[42:31] times, did I say anything wrong? Can I
[42:33] get somebody to smile out there? That's
[42:35] when you know the church is really
[42:36] struggling when they can't even smile.
[42:38] But by the end, they were smiling. So,
[42:39] they're must be going through trials.
[42:41] So, let's pray for our our brothers and
[42:42] sisters.
[42:45] I was like, did I say something? I can't
[42:46] even get one amen.
[42:48] Lord, help me. But by the end, it was
[42:51] all good by the grace of the Lord. Amen.
[42:52] People crying, like I said, people
[42:54] coming up for prayer. Good time in the
[42:56] Lord.
[43:00] 1 Peter 567. Humbleelves therefore under
[43:03] the mighty hand of God that he may he
[43:05] may exalt you in due time casting all
[43:07] your care on him for he cares for you. I
[43:12] want to buy how many want to buy from
[43:13] Jesus. Here's how you buy. First you got
[43:16] to give him not money. You got to give
[43:18] him all your cares.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. Well, I I
[43:23] didn't get paid yet. I can't get the
[43:24] gold from Jesus. He don't want your
[43:26] money. Now he wants your ties,
[43:29] right? But he he's not asking for well I
[43:32] I given this to buy something. It's a
[43:34] spiritual transaction.
[43:36] I'm going to give you all my care
[43:38] especially in Leodosia rich and increase
[43:39] with goods. I don't have enough money. I
[43:40] don't have enough goods. Cast that on
[43:42] the Lord and then what does he give you?
[43:44] He gives you gold.
[43:46] He gives you white raignment.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; He gives you is. So now I can see wow I
[43:51] have great inheritance in heaven. I'm
[43:54] going to get really no inheritance on
[43:55] this earth but I got great inheritance
[43:56] in heaven. Praise God.
[43:59] Hallelujah.
[44:02] And church, we still got more good news.
[44:03] I got more good news for you. Praise
[44:05] God. Now, we know the good news is Jesus
[44:07] died for sinners, saves us from uh hell,
[44:10] right? By the blood of Jesus Christ,
[44:11] saved by grace, not by works. We know
[44:13] that good news. But I got some more good
[44:14] news for you. Isaiah 55:1 and2.
[44:18] Hallelujah.
[44:20] He says, "Ho, everyone that thirsts,
[44:22] come to me. I'm sorry. Come ye to the
[44:24] waters and he that hath no money." So
[44:26] see when Jesus has a store, you don't
[44:28] need money.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; You just got to come to the store.
[44:31] Praise God.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; And buy and eat. Yay. Come buy wine and
[44:36] milk without money and price. Wherefore
[44:38] do you spend money for that which is not
[44:40] bread, and your labor for that which
[44:42] satisfaithth not. Hearken diligy unto
[44:45] me, and eat that which is good, and let
[44:47] your soul delight itself with fatness.
[44:49] Church, every billionaire never has
[44:51] enough money. Every millionaire doesn't
[44:53] get enough money. It'll never satisfy
[44:55] you. So God says, "Come and buy
[44:57] something that will satisfy you."
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The gold will satisfy you.
[45:03] You see, you've got faith that stands
[45:05] the test. The white raignment, the
[45:06] righteousness of Christ, not trusting in
[45:08] your own works, but trusting in the
[45:10] blood of Christ. And the church said,
[45:12] &gt;&gt; "And the hope of his calling eyes." So
[45:14] you can see, wow, I have a great hope in
[45:17] heaven. I'm promised eternal life in
[45:19] heaven, and I've got an inheritance with
[45:21] Jesus.
[45:24] Come buy some of that. Uh, where's the
[45:27] store? Is it open 247, church? It's open
[45:29] 247. It doesn't close, brother Chris.
[45:33] Hallelujah. Right. Right, Caris. It's
[45:36] open 247.
[45:38] Jesus's store where he's selling these
[45:40] three things, it's open. Think about
[45:42] that. You have a such a great store, you
[45:43] only have to sell three things. That's a
[45:46] good store. Praise God. Hallelujah. And
[45:49] that's for this church age,
[45:51] &gt;&gt; right? You don't see this in any other
[45:53] church age. This is for our church age.
[45:55] This church age that's the worst of all
[45:57] as far as the most deceptive,
[46:00] right? Nothing, not one good thing to
[46:02] say about this church age as a whole. So
[46:04] that means very few people will actually
[46:06] go to that store and buy what Jesus is
[46:08] selling. Proverbs 23:23. I'm almost
[46:12] done.
[46:16] Here's what you're really trying to buy,
[46:18] church. So another word for all these
[46:21] things, another word for Isel, another
[46:23] word for gold, another word for white
[46:25] raignment is the truth. Wisdom says buy
[46:30] the truth and sell it not. Don't sell
[46:33] out to the world and take their lies.
[46:36] Believe the truth of the Bible. Buy
[46:39] that. Don't sell it.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; So see this is this proves Judas could
[46:43] sell out. And the church said,
[46:45] &gt;&gt; "See, you can have the truth, but then
[46:47] sell it out later."
[46:49] &gt;&gt; That proves it. Buy the truth, don't
[46:52] sell it out. Hang your soul on the
[46:55] truth. Hold on to the truth more than
[46:57] anything else. Hallelujah.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Than any relationship, any amount of
[47:00] money, any opportunity. You hold on to
[47:02] the truth with everything you've got.
[47:04] Don't sell it out. Hallelujah.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; If you ever got something from Jesus,
[47:08] hold on to it. It'll be the greatest
[47:10] gift you ever got. Hallelujah.
[47:12] You'll never want to give it away. You
[47:14] always keep these three gifts that Jesus
[47:16] gives in the Leodysian church age.
[47:22] Hallelujah.
[47:26] I'll close with this one here. Yeah, I
[47:28] got lots of, but I better uh close it up
[47:30] here.
[47:33] Let's do uh Matthew 13. Now, I'm going
[47:36] to turn there. 44. This is the parable
[47:39] of the pearl of great price.
[47:45] How many enjoying the word tonight? You
[47:47] enjoying it? Did you have needs when you
[47:48] came here tonight? Hallelujah. Good.
[47:51] Hallelujah. I did, too.
[47:55] I feel better. I came in tired, but I'm
[47:56] feeling a lot more energetic now. 13:44.
[48:01] Actually, let's go to 45 because Yeah,
[48:03] that's a different parable. That's the
[48:04] hid treasure. 45 is the pearl again. The
[48:07] kingdom of heaven is like unto a
[48:09] merchant man seeking goodly pearls. Who
[48:12] when he found one pearl of great price,
[48:14] he went and sold all that he had and
[48:17] bought it. This is a beautiful parable,
[48:21] right?
[48:22] He's seeking all these, you know, we are
[48:25] seeking all these blessings, all these
[48:26] pearls, but once we find the one pearl
[48:28] that's greater than all, we sell out
[48:30] everything we have. In other words, we
[48:32] cast all of our cares on Jesus for the
[48:35] pearl of greater price.
[48:38] Church, what's more valuable? The gold
[48:41] of Jesus or continuing to worry about
[48:44] all your problems? What's what's more
[48:45] valuable?
[48:48] How about worrying about persecution?
[48:50] Uh, what's more valuable? Trusting in
[48:52] Jesus righteousness or worrying about
[48:55] the rise of Christian persecution in
[48:57] America?
[48:59] The righteous.
[49:01] And that that's that's what this tells
[49:02] us. We've got to go to Jesus and sell
[49:04] out everything. Lord, I'm casting all
[49:06] this on you. And I want the pearl of
[49:08] great price. I want the truth. There it
[49:10] is. Amen. The truth. Hallelujah. The one
[49:13] pearl. Give me the one truth. Give me
[49:15] thus sayith the word of God. That's what
[49:17] I want. And I'm willing
[49:20] to sell all that I have. I'm willing to
[49:22] cast everything I have and make the
[49:24] exchange so I can have the truth of
[49:26] God's word. How many want the truth of
[49:28] God's word tonight? Let's stand to our
[49:29] feet. musicians can come.
[49:35] Well, I made it about halfway through.
[49:37] How many enjoyed that tonight? Praise
[49:38] God. Amen. Hallelujah. The Leodysian
[49:41] church age. See, I never seen it like
[49:43] that, you know, with the uh the
[49:45] different scriptures I talked about with
[49:47] spewing. I never seen it like that where
[49:49] it was foreshadowed at least in two
[49:51] places. And then I'd not put all those
[49:54] together about spiritual buying, casting
[49:56] everything on the Lord, selling out
[49:59] lies, selling out unbelief, selling out
[50:01] whatever we're struggling with, and then
[50:03] buying the truth, hanging on to it with
[50:06] all we got.
[50:08] Is there a truth tonight that you need
[50:10] to hang on to, church?
[50:12] Hallelujah. For each one of us, there
[50:14] could be something we're struggling
[50:16] with, something bothering us, something
[50:18] we're fighting. But there in all that,
[50:21] there's got to be a truth that we could
[50:22] sell out in order to receive. I'm sorry.
[50:26] There's got to be something we can sell
[50:28] out all of our battles and take the
[50:30] truth of God's word. Sorry, I said that
[50:32] wrong. So, let's bow our heads. Let's
[50:34] pray about that by God's grace.
[50:40] Heavenly Father, we thank you for the
[50:42] word of God tonight. Lord God, this is a
[50:44] beautiful text. Not because I preach it,
[50:46] because it's in the Bible. I'm nothing.
[50:48] I got enough sense. You gave me enough
[50:49] grace to know I'm nothing. But Lord,
[50:51] this blessed me so much on Sunday. I saw
[50:53] it bless three or four people that come
[50:54] up for prayer. Lord, I trust your people
[50:57] received it here tonight. Lord God, we
[51:00] want to be more spiritual. Lord, that's
[51:02] why we listen to a testimony about
[51:04] prayer and fasting, getting up early,
[51:06] fighting spiritual warfare. Lord, not
[51:09] just talking about it, but getting up
[51:10] early to do it, Lord God. Or for some,
[51:13] it might be staying up later to do it.
[51:17] Well, Lord, we just don't want to talk
[51:18] about being hot. We want to be hot.
[51:20] Hallelujah. We want a fervent desire to
[51:22] please you, a passion to know the word
[51:24] and a reaching out in the spirit.
[51:26] Hallelujah. We want Christlike
[51:28] character. We want the righteousness of
[51:30] Jesus covering our unrighteousness.
[51:34] And with the Isowl that gives us an eyes
[51:36] of understanding that we can understand
[51:38] the hope of the calling and the glorious
[51:41] riches of our eternal inheritance.
[51:50] So we thank you Lord for tonight Lord
[51:51] God. Lord if your people Lord here
[51:54] tonight need a transaction I pray
[51:56] they'll do it Lord. If they've been
[51:58] holding on to something like anxiety
[52:01] like anger a root of bitterness,
[52:05] discouragement,
[52:07] guilt, shame,
[52:09] lust,
[52:10] [Music]
[52:12] whatever it may be. Lord, may I pray
[52:15] that they the Lord God make a spiritual
[52:17] transaction tonight. They'll cast that
[52:20] care upon the Lord.
[52:22] They'll confess that care. And Lord,
[52:25] surely you'll give them what they came
[52:27] to buy, the truth. You'll give them the
[52:30] truth tonight, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[52:33] Lord, some of us need that gold. We just
[52:35] need to get through this trial we're
[52:36] going through, Lord. May the people make
[52:38] the exchange and buy some gold tonight
[52:40] from you, Lord God. Hallelujah. Other
[52:43] people struggle. Am I righteous enough?
[52:45] Am I good enough for heaven? Lord, may
[52:46] they make the exchange and realize only
[52:48] Jesus's righteousness is good enough for
[52:51] heaven.
[52:54] And Lord, to those eyes that have been
[52:56] kind of dimmed over and they can't even
[52:58] uh think about the heaven or the hope of
[53:00] their calling or their inheritance,
[53:02] Lord, I pray they'd exchange, Lord,
[53:04] their short-term thinking for eternal
[53:06] perspectives. Dear God, grant it. Lord
[53:09] Jesus,
[53:12] help your people here tonight. Lord, I
[53:13] trust somebody was blessed here by the
[53:15] power of God, by the Holy Ghost. Lord
[53:17] God, draw your people to you closer
[53:20] tonight. I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[53:24] And the saints said,
[53:26] "Hallelujah. blessing in the presence of
[53:28] Jehovah.
