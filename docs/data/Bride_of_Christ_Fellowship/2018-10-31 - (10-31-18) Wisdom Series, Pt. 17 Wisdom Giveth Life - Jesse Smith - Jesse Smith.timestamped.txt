[34:18] verse 12 together one two three four
[34:21] wisdom is a defence and money is a
[34:25] defense but the excellency of knowledge
[34:28] is that wisdom giveth life to them that
[34:31] habit so what's more important money or
[34:34] wisdom we you have to say wisdom and
[34:37] remember wisdom is life and the Bible
[34:40] said God is life God is light God is
[34:43] love so wisdom is the Holy Ghost
[34:46] that's just bow our heads for word of
[34:48] Prayer I want to labor on that just for
[34:49] a few minutes before I get in the
[34:51] message you have a need on your heart

[35:45] need tonight Loren minister at every
[35:46] heart I pray Lord I'm at my post of duty
[35:49] Lord here I stand Lord anoint me anoint
[35:52] your people in Jesus Christ name and the
[35:54] church said Amen God best use me and see
[35:56] their praise God I want to take about
[36:00] five minutes just to kind of review a
[36:02] few things here and then I want to get
[36:04] to the rest of this by God's grace I'm
[36:11] gonna set my timer here so I'd keep my
[36:13] body healthy alright so I want to look
[36:20] at this thought here and recall or help
[36:23] everybody recall here that wisdom is the
[36:26] Holy Ghost when we read the book of
[36:29] Ecclesiastes or proverbs we are reading
[36:32] about God's Spirit giving us skill to
[36:35] live our lives you know in any
[36:38] profession you want to be skilful
[36:40] whether you're a security guard right so
[36:42] you want to be a skilful security guard
[36:44] what if you were an unskilful security
[36:46] guard but what if I was an unskilful
[36:49] teacher what would they do they would
[36:51] they would they would go through all the
[36:53] all the all the mandates I miss and they
[36:56] would try to correct me and if that was
[36:58] still unskillful they would have rights
[36:59] to fire me and we know every job
[37:03] requires skill I can't really think of
[37:04] any job that
[37:06] it doesn't require skill if you work at
[37:08] McDonald's or Burger King you've got to
[37:10] cook that Burger with skill every every
[37:14] every job requires some level of skill
[37:18] and so for us we know skill a skillful
[37:22] life is living in such a way where we we
[37:25] live to please God where we do what God
[37:28] has called us to do the word wisdom of
[37:31] course means skill so it's the it's
[37:34] making the right choice by the
[37:35] leadership of the Holy Spirit now I want
[37:38] to read a few things here
[37:40] remember proverbs chapter 8 if you have
[37:42] your Bibles and liddy you can put it up
[37:44] here proverbs 8 22 recall that wisdom is
[37:48] the Holy Ghost it's just another name
[37:52] for it's a it's another synonymous term
[37:55] for wisdom is the Holy Ghost
[37:58] so proverbs 8:20 to the Lord possessed
[38:01] me in the beginning of his way before
[38:02] his works of old I was set up from
[38:04] everlasting from the beginning or ever
[38:06] the earth was so before the world was
[38:09] there was wisdom so it has to be God
[38:12] because the only thing before God or
[38:15] before the earth had to been the creator
[38:17] of the earth wisdom verse 24 when there
[38:21] was no depth I was brought forth when
[38:23] there was no Fountains abounding with
[38:25] water before the mountains were settled
[38:27] before the hills was I brought forth
[38:30] well as yet he had not made the earth
[38:32] nor the fields or the highest part of
[38:34] the dust of the world when he prepared
[38:37] the heavens I was there when he said a
[38:39] compass upon the face of the earth when
[38:41] he established the clouds above when he
[38:43] strengthened the Fountains of the deep
[38:44] when he gave to the sea his decree that
[38:47] the water should not pass his
[38:48] commandment when he appointed the
[38:50] foundations of the earth then I was by
[38:52] him as one brought up with him and I was
[38:55] daily his delight rejoicing always
[38:58] before him amen
[39:02] now let's look at go down a little bit
[39:05] here to skip a few verses here verse 33
[39:07] here instruction and be wise it refused
[39:10] it not blessed is the man that heareth
[39:12] me watching daily at my gates waiting at
[39:14] the posts of my doors whoso findeth me
[39:17] fines wears that word
[39:19] life amen and shouting in faith sinneth
[39:25] against me wisdom wrong with his own
[39:27] soul all they that hate me love death so
[39:30] we either love death tonight or we love
[39:33] life I know you love life that's why
[39:35] you're here that's why I'm here when you
[39:37] find the wisdom of God you found life
[39:40] because wisdom is the Holy Ghost and God
[39:43] is life God his light God is love God is
[39:46] all these things praise God
[39:48] now I want to remind you to if you
[39:51] forgot brother random says the greatest
[39:53] of all gifts is love he also says wisdom
[39:58] that's okay he says both I was gonna I
[40:00] was gonna show how wisdom in love and
[40:02] wisdom is the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[40:04] Ghost is love I was gonna show how
[40:06] they're the same aim ahead because
[40:08] brother man says both he says the
[40:10] greatest gift of all is love and then he
[40:12] says the greatest gift of all is wisdom
[40:13] and if you go back to the scripture
[40:15] wisdom was here before the earth was so
[40:19] wisdom has to be the Holy Spirit and the
[40:21] Holy Spirit has to be loved so there
[40:23] there's there one the same just like
[40:25] Holy Spirit and God the Father they
[40:27] can't be two separate they have to be
[40:29] one amen and so wisdom of course is just
[40:32] the expression of God's mind the
[40:34] expression of God's heart and that
[40:36] expression has to be the Holy Spirit the
[40:38] anointing of the Holy Spirit so program
[40:40] tells us that and here you him 1956 he
[40:44] says the greatest of all gifts is wisdom
[40:45] the second is knowledge he says if you
[40:48] haven't got wisdom how can you control
[40:50] your knowledge what good is your
[40:51] knowledge going to do see what I mean
[40:53] seek the first things first so see
[40:57] wisdom is the greatest gift because it
[40:59] is God's love it is God's skill to know
[41:03] what to do now
[41:06] program said that he said that's the
[41:08] reason God cannot trust too many
[41:10] spiritual gifts with people they don't
[41:13] know how to control them that's the
[41:15] matter today the reason we don't have
[41:16] more than we do so God looks down at
[41:19] church members and he sees well I can't
[41:21] trust this one so I can't give them a
[41:23] gift I can't trust that one so I can't
[41:25] give them a gift because I know they
[41:26] don't know how to control it and who
[41:29] knows how to control the gift of God the
[41:31] only way to control gift of God
[41:32] is through prayer and self-sacrifice
[41:36] right because if we walk in the flesh
[41:38] God can't trust us with a gift but if we
[41:41] walk in the spirit now God can trust us
[41:43] with a gift amen that's the only way so
[41:46] if we were God to be able to trust us
[41:48] with a gift we've got to be more self
[41:50] sacrificial we've got to get more of our
[41:52] time more of our thoughts of the word
[41:54] we've got to be more prayer for
[41:55] prayerful we got to crucify the flesh
[41:58] you walk in the spirit it's really very
[42:00] simple that's our program tells us the
[42:02] reason there's not more gifts is because
[42:05] you can't trust people with them they
[42:07] won't keep it control for example if
[42:09] someone has a gift of will just say gift
[42:12] of knowledge they if they get upset with
[42:14] somebody else in the church they might
[42:15] say well the Holy Spirit tells me this
[42:18] about your life and or well let's say
[42:20] discernment well the Holy Spirit gave me
[42:22] you know they're just mad at somebody
[42:23] the church and they'll say well the Holy
[42:25] Spirit discerning that you're lying
[42:26] about this and you're lying about that
[42:28] and they may accuse somebody falsely
[42:30] saying it's a gift of God doing it and
[42:33] so see God couldn't trust somebody like
[42:35] that with to get to discernment God
[42:37] would rather have somebody wait upon the
[42:38] Lord pray and and seek his face and wait
[42:42] until they're sure they've got a word
[42:44] from the Lord and then they can take it
[42:46] to that person amen
[42:48] so God cannot trust he says many people
[42:51] with gifts that's why there's not as
[42:54] many gifts in churches today who do you
[42:59] know or which searches you know that are
[43:00] so loyal to prayer so loyal to faithful
[43:03] being faithful to God that they have all
[43:05] nine gifts of the Holy Spirit now I know
[43:07] we got quite a few at our church whether
[43:08] you believe it or not I know we've got
[43:11] quite a few I know we got wisdom healing
[43:13] I know we got tongues sister know we
[43:15] speaks in tongues right I've prayed for
[43:17] people we pray for people this last two
[43:19] months that we've seen healings praise
[43:20] God amen hallelujah
[43:22] you know we we have many of these gifts
[43:25] in here and if God's given us a gift
[43:27] that we just got to be more diligent we
[43:30] got to be more faithful with it amen
[43:32] well I want to see all nine operate
[43:35] praise God don't you we want to see all
[43:37] nine operate so we got to be more loyal
[43:39] we got to be more under the control of
[43:42] the Holy Spirit he said
[43:46] says if we're expecting Christ to pull
[43:49] out all nine gifts of the Spirit he said
[43:51] how can he do it when he can't even
[43:53] trust you with church membership so
[43:56] people would jump from church to church
[43:57] how is God gonna pour out all the night
[44:00] gifts when he can't even trust you to be
[44:01] faithful to one church so see if you've
[44:04] been faithful to one church then God can
[44:06] trust you with a gift that's the beauty
[44:09] of that one so we got if brother Rams
[44:11] you know rebuking people for not being
[44:13] papal to church and they don't get gifts
[44:15] then with we're faithful to church then
[44:17] God can trust us with a gift Amen it's
[44:20] the compare and contrast if you know if
[44:22] programs contrasting well God can't
[44:26] throw us people because they're not
[44:27] purchase if we're faithful to church
[44:29] then God should be able to trust us with
[44:30] the gift amen hallelujah so I want to
[44:35] make sure we go over those that the
[44:36] wisdom has to be the Holy Spirit a
[44:39] church what separates the wise version
[44:41] from the foolish version what's the only
[44:42] thing that separates them the oil and
[44:45] what is the oil the Holy Ghost and what
[44:49] makes the wise virgin holy ghost feel
[44:51] they're wise so see wisdom wisdom has to
[44:55] be the Holy Ghost because that's the
[44:57] very name of the people with the oil the
[45:00] wise virgins so the Holy Ghost is wisdom
[45:03] praise God the foolish virgins are
[45:05] version they're just like the the wise
[45:07] but the only thing they're lacking is
[45:09] the Holy Ghost so I hope you can see it
[45:12] tonight that the Holy Ghost is wisdom
[45:15] can you see it tonight by God's grace
[45:17] all right so I hope I proved that to
[45:20] your Thoroughly wisdom was with God
[45:22] before the world was even founded wisdom
[45:25] is the Holy Ghost now remember the
[45:29] scriptures I'm not going to read them
[45:30] but remember proverbs says wisdom is the
[45:33] principal thing he the Bible says withal
[45:36] and get wisdom so with all of our
[45:39] efforts that's why we came to church
[45:41] tonight lord give me more wisdom
[45:43] give me more skill and living my life
[45:44] that I can live more in the spirit and
[45:47] not in the flesh I trust that's why you
[45:49] came to church tonight praise God that
[45:51] is the principal thing and remember the
[45:53] Bible said nothing on earth can be
[45:56] compared to the value of wisdom amen
[45:59] nothing so you know we take a little Tex
[46:01] tonight we read out of ecclesiastes some
[46:03] people might say now I know not and I
[46:05] know not you but some people I say we're
[46:08] just reading out of the Old Testament
[46:09] and yet they would be so foolish that
[46:11] would be so foolish because they don't
[46:13] they they forget that the wisdom of God
[46:15] is contained in this book of
[46:17] ecclesiastes they men the wisdom of God
[46:20] is contained in the book of Proverbs and
[46:23] that wisdom is the principal thing it's
[46:25] the most valuable thing we can do is
[46:28] learn on how to live the right way
[46:30] in other words prayut or writers
[46:33] prioritize our lives so that Christ gets
[46:36] first place in our life that's what real
[46:38] skill is is putting Christ first place
[46:41] in our lives
[46:42] amen yes that's exactly right nothing is
[46:45] more valuable than wisdom choosing that
[46:49] will put God's way God's will God's will
[46:52] above everything else that's wisdom
[46:55] hallelujah now let's go to 2nd Timothy 3
[46:59] here just briefly well we're almost done
[47:01] reviewing here
[47:07] what was your going there 2nd Timothy
[47:09] chapter 3
[47:09] liddie you can skip ahead to 12
[47:14] second Timothy 3:12 remember why your
[47:18] turn there though the very climax of the
[47:21] book of Proverbs is a wise woman at the
[47:24] end of the book after 30 after 30
[47:27] chapters the Holy Spirit inspired
[47:29] Solomon to but that 31st chapter as a
[47:32] wise woman the very climax
[47:34] what does wisdom produce it produces a
[47:36] very valuable faithful obedient woman
[47:39] that's what Jesus wants to marry a man
[47:42] is a very valuable faithful diligent
[47:44] hard-working woman and that's what we've
[47:46] got to be as the bride of Jesus Christ
[47:48] amen
[47:49] the very highlight of Proverbs is a wise
[47:52] woman and that's what Jesus is exalting
[47:54] today
[47:55] now we're not supposed to exert
[47:56] ourselves we're supposed to let Jesus
[47:58] exalt ourselves
[47:59] amen we're supposed to that Jesus say in
[48:01] other words let Jesus brag on us not us
[48:04] bragging on ourselves not say we're the
[48:06] bride look how great we are but live
[48:08] such a holy life til people look at your
[48:10] life and say if the I ever saw a
[48:12] Christian if
[48:13] ever saw a wise virgin it was that
[48:15] person Amen that's the lesson that's the
[48:19] praise of God when other people praise
[48:21] you for being a Christian that's how you
[48:23] know you're getting closer to God amen
[48:26] that's exactly right we don't brag and
[48:28] beat ourselves on the back and say look
[48:30] at me look how holy I am but we let God
[48:32] praise us through the words of other
[48:34] people so people can see the glory of
[48:37] God in our lives right
[48:39] verse 12 now remember in this context
[48:42] church this was Paul's last letter
[48:46] before he was martyred before his head
[48:48] was cut off in Rome this is Paul's last
[48:50] letter and in context this chapters
[48:55] about the last days remember in the last
[48:57] days perilous times shall come if you
[48:59] read verse one we're not going to read
[49:00] it lover the men will be lovers of
[49:02] themselves lovers of pleasures more than
[49:03] lovers of God covetous trucebreakers
[49:05] false accusers incontinent despisers of
[49:08] those who love the message amen now look
[49:12] at verse 12
[49:12] yea and all that will live godly in
[49:15] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[49:17] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[49:19] worse and worse deceiving and being
[49:21] deceived but continue thou in the things
[49:24] which thou has learned it has been
[49:26] assured of knowing of whom thou learned
[49:28] them and that from a child thou hast
[49:30] known the Holy Scriptures which are able
[49:32] to make thee wise unto salvation through
[49:35] faith which is in Christ Jesus all
[49:38] Scripture is given by inspiration of God
[49:40] and is profitable for doctrine for
[49:43] reproof for correction for instruction
[49:46] in righteousness that the man of God may
[49:49] be thoroughly or may be perfect rather
[49:51] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[49:54] so the last of Paul's written words now
[49:58] we don't have one more chapter he talks
[49:59] about fighting the good fight of faith
[50:00] but some of his last words are
[50:03] encouraging all the believers to
[50:06] remember the Holy Scriptures amen
[50:08] all scripture let's can we all spell the
[50:12] word all real quick Hey ll-let smelled
[50:15] again a ll all Scripture is given by
[50:19] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[50:22] your earthly life on this side
[50:25] the Bible said it's profitable for
[50:26] doctrine and remember we preach on that
[50:28] how you cannot even get say without
[50:30] doctrine we preach on that a few weeks
[50:33] ago doctrine is instruction teaching or
[50:35] learning reproof so this is what we can
[50:39] get from the book of Ecclesiastes we get
[50:41] doctrine we can learn tonight we can get
[50:43] reproof which is conviction or evidence
[50:45] God can convict our hearts and say oh I
[50:48] was wrong here or I was wrong there we
[50:52] can get correction which is
[50:53] straightening up or Reformation and we
[50:56] can get instruction in righteousness
[50:57] that we may be perfect or complete we
[51:01] can be thoroughly furnished or fully
[51:03] equipped unto all good works
[51:05] amen just by reading the Old Testament
[51:09] and so that's where we like to do now we
[51:11] like to go back to Cleese ask these five
[51:13] so let's go back to Cleese Assis Chapter
[51:15] five I know we started in Chapter seven
[51:17] but I want to build up to chapter seven
[51:19] by God's grace now with that in mind
[51:24] let's see if the Holy Spirit doesn't
[51:27] give us doctrine tonight reproof
[51:29] correction or instruction and
[51:31] righteousness fully a quick equipping us
[51:34] unto all good works let's see if you
[51:35] don't do it I believe he will by God's
[51:37] grace
[51:38] now we've read through all chapters one
[51:41] two three and four and now we're
[51:44] starting chapter five I'm gonna start
[51:45] reading verses one to seven and that
[51:47] won't stop and make some comments here
[51:51] keep thy foot when thou goes to the
[51:53] house of God and be more ready to hear
[51:56] than to give the sacrifice of fools for
[52:01] they consider not that they do evil all
[52:04] right so what must we do when we go to
[52:07] church we must be ready to listen and
[52:09] not go to church like a fool a fool just
[52:13] wants to give a sacrifice but a wise
[52:15] Christian goes to church
[52:17] ready to hear and listen consider you
[52:21] have to consider that I may have sinned
[52:22] this week right if we come in here
[52:25] thinking well I haven't done I've lived
[52:27] better than most of the people I know or
[52:29] I'm pretty good about being piling the
[52:31] message you know then we the Bible says
[52:33] we come to church as a fool we've got to
[52:36] remember we came to church
[52:38] to worship we came to here we came to
[52:41] here brother man says you come to church
[52:42] to hear about your short places amen
[52:45] verse to be not rash with thy mouth and
[52:49] let not thine heart be hasty to any I'm
[52:52] sorry to utter anything before God for
[52:55] God is in heaven and now upon the earth
[52:58] therefore let thy words be few so let's
[53:02] not make let's not try to make God a
[53:04] promise that we aren't sure we're going
[53:06] to keep like we'll get to a little bit
[53:09] let's be careful what we say with our
[53:12] mouth verse three for a dream coming
[53:15] through the multitude of business and a
[53:17] fools voice is known by multitude of
[53:19] words now how many remember that I
[53:21] remember that the reason you have so
[53:23] many dreams is because you're so busy I
[53:25] don't remember that I've been having
[53:27] crazy dreams lately it seems like when I
[53:29] go to sleep I'm just dreaming the whole
[53:31] time and that's because I'm really busy
[53:34] with all the work demands all these
[53:35] deadlines I got to meet with with you
[53:37] know great guards and and all these
[53:39] things that I have to take care of but a
[53:42] fool is known because of their multitude
[53:45] of words there's a spewing out stuff
[53:47] just speaking too much too much saying
[53:49] too much look at verse 4 when thou foul
[53:53] us the vow unto God defer not to pay it
[53:56] make sure you pay your vow to God for he
[53:59] hath no pleasure in fools pay that which
[54:01] thou hast vow'd recently well a couple
[54:05] years ago I was told I told my person
[54:07] they said I promise I'll be there on
[54:09] Wednesday I promise I'll lead songs for
[54:11] you and the person maybe came to church
[54:13] once or twice she's just making foolish
[54:16] promises and I never asked the person
[54:19] lead songs they they just said they
[54:21] would do it I never asked them I just
[54:23] kinda nod my head and said okay you know
[54:25] ho-ho see about that and of course that
[54:27] shows their foolish right when you make
[54:30] a promise you better keep your promise
[54:33] God says it's foolish to not keep your
[54:36] promise verse 5 better is it that thou
[54:39] shouldest not vow then that that should
[54:41] have ow and not pay suffer not thy mouth
[54:45] to cause thy flesh to sin neither say
[54:48] thou before the angel that it was an air
[54:50] that wherefore should God be angry
[54:52] voice and destroy the work of thine
[54:54] hands see we don't want to get God angry
[54:56] at us for making promises that we can't
[54:58] keep amen so we see here we must be
[55:07] careful what we say verse 7 for the
[55:11] multitude of dreams and many words there
[55:13] are also diverse vanities but fear thou
[55:15] God so if we really fear God if we
[55:19] really want to hate sin if we really
[55:21] want to keep ourselves pure we'll be
[55:23] careful how many words we say amen
[55:28] it's not the person who's talks the most
[55:31] that's the most spiritual it's the
[55:32] person who says the wisest things that's
[55:35] the most spiritual and usually it's a
[55:37] person who says the least amount of
[55:39] words watch it watch it amongst these
[55:42] church members here on Sunday you know
[55:43] watch watch who's saying the least
[55:47] amount of things not the person who can
[55:50] spew off and make everybody laugh the
[55:52] most that's good it's good to make
[55:54] people laugh it's good to laugh the
[55:56] pressure it's good to have nice times
[55:58] but really watch the people who are most
[56:01] careful with their words those that are
[56:03] really aware that God is keeping track
[56:05] of what you're saying amen you won't
[56:12] hear that preached in very many churches
[56:14] but it's the truth it's the truth the
[56:17] most spiritual people are the ones who
[56:20] Troy's trying to create that atmosphere
[56:21] Amen not just in church but everywhere
[56:24] they go praise God
[56:25] they want to create a godly atmosphere
[56:28] wherever they are amen verse eight well
[56:35] I'll just say like this out I'll just
[56:36] give a little testimony I was uh I was
[56:38] at work yesterday we were at we were not
[56:40] in school we're actually out of training
[56:42] and I was just keeping quiet because all
[56:43] these all these teachers are rounding
[56:45] off all these sins and evil things like
[56:47] that and that and they after about an
[56:49] hour and a half they say well what's
[56:50] what's wrong why are you so quiet and
[56:52] they didn't even realize that the reason
[56:55] I'm being quiet so I don't sin against
[56:57] God a fool will utter things and they
[57:02] just keep talking talking talking but a
[57:04] wise Christian is careful
[57:06] they don't want to join in and they
[57:07] don't want those frolicking spirits to
[57:10] jump on them so they keep their mouths
[57:12] closed and they only say that which
[57:14] pleases God amen it's exactly right
[57:18] that's just how I can see this apply to
[57:20] my life at the church and it's and at
[57:23] work we were the ones that should say
[57:25] very few were the ones that should say
[57:27] only what God would have us to say amen
[57:30] because the Bible says if you do that
[57:32] you fear God hey men Liz Leah verse 8 if
[57:38] thou see us the oppression of the poor
[57:40] and the violent perverting of judgment
[57:42] and justice and a Providence Marvel not
[57:44] the matter for he that is higher than
[57:46] the highest regardeth and there be
[57:48] higher than they so this is why we can
[57:51] be confident when we hear things on the
[57:54] news like the you know the Jews getting
[57:55] shot you know there are last week so
[57:58] it's so awful in Pittsburgh some of
[58:00] these awful things if we're not careful
[58:02] we can let that discourage us so much
[58:05] that we lose the joy of the Lord and
[58:07] don't get me wrong the Bible said we
[58:09] should more with those who mourn but
[58:11] here solomon gives us this wisdom we
[58:14] have to be confident that God will work
[58:17] for the people who are oppressed amen we
[58:22] can't let ourselves get overly
[58:24] discouraged and feel like oh there's no
[58:26] reason for me to even go on or I'm
[58:28] giving up hope or where was God when
[58:30] these people got shot God was there
[58:33] where was God when Jesus was crucified
[58:36] he was right there right here we know he
[58:38] had to turn his back on and yet the
[58:41] Bible says it pleased God to bruise him
[58:43] so see we have to we have to have more
[58:47] fear for God we have to have more
[58:49] understanding that God's divine love is
[58:51] different than our human compassion amen
[58:54] and Solomon tells us we cannot get
[58:58] overly sad about oppressions and
[59:01] persecutions and people being mistreated
[59:03] now of course if we can help them out
[59:04] let's help them out many times we can't
[59:07] because they live so far away but the
[59:09] one thing we can do is we can pray for
[59:11] them and then we can say God I'm gonna
[59:13] trust you I'm confident that you will
[59:16] work on their behalf amen God will bring
[59:19] these sin
[59:20] the judgment how we know that weather on
[59:22] this side or on the on the next side God
[59:25] will bring them to judgment somehow amen
[59:28] verse nine moreover the prophet of the
[59:32] earth is for all the king himself is
[59:34] served by the field to see the profit of
[59:37] the earth is for everybody the Solomon
[59:39] just lays this in here that God blesses
[59:41] everybody with the labors of all the
[59:43] workers of the earth
[59:44] look at verse 10 he that loveth silver
[59:47] shall not be satisfied with silver does
[59:49] that help people Laodicea it ought to
[59:53] write if you love money you're never
[59:55] going to be satisfied with money he that
[59:58] loveth abundance with increase this is
[1:00:00] also vanity so in other words if you
[1:00:03] really love money you'll never have
[1:00:05] enough money in your savings account if
[1:00:08] you love money it'll never be enough
[1:00:10] what does the Bible say godliness with
[1:00:13] contentment is great gain that's the
[1:00:16] spiritual bank account hallelujah if you
[1:00:20] could you can no iton tonight where do I
[1:00:23] love money more to write to have more
[1:00:25] trust in God because if you love money
[1:00:28] more you never have enough money you
[1:00:30] never have enough but if you love God
[1:00:33] more then you've got all that you need
[1:00:35] tonight Amen amen
[1:00:38] not that it's a bad idea to save it's a
[1:00:40] good idea to save but the the sin of
[1:00:43] this is this insatiable greed this
[1:00:46] insatiable lust for money right it's the
[1:00:49] it's the pride of life or it's the love
[1:00:52] of it's the lust of the eyes lust of the
[1:00:54] flesh if our confidence is in those
[1:00:57] things that were actually in love with
[1:00:59] the wrong thing we got to be in love
[1:01:00] with Jesus Christ
[1:01:01] praise God that's riches so see but let
[1:01:11] me say
[1:01:11] this if you love Jesus you'll be
[1:01:13] satisfied with Jesus amen if you love
[1:01:17] silver you won't be satisfied with
[1:01:19] silver but if you love Jesus you will be
[1:01:21] satisfied with Jesus take that right
[1:01:24] here yeah that's right verse 11 when
[1:01:26] goods increase they are increased and
[1:01:28] eat them right so when you got lots of
[1:01:31] stuff well now you got to help more
[1:01:32] people and what good is there to the
[1:01:36] owners there of saving the beholding of
[1:01:37] them with their eyes the sleep of a
[1:01:40] laboring man is sweet whether he even
[1:01:41] little or much but the abundance of the
[1:01:43] rich will not suffer him to sleep how
[1:01:46] many could have a good night's rest
[1:01:47] because you know you worked hard at work
[1:01:48] you worked hard serving your family all
[1:01:50] day the kids got fed the kids got a bath
[1:01:52] the kids got their faces washed you did
[1:01:55] a good job working amen you can sleep at
[1:01:59] night saying thank you lord I've done
[1:02:00] all the work I've had to do today that's
[1:02:03] right there's a sore evil verse 13 which
[1:02:07] I have seen under the sun namely riches
[1:02:09] kept for their owners thereof to their
[1:02:11] hurt but those riches perished by evil
[1:02:14] travail and he began at the Sun and
[1:02:16] there's nothing in his hand as he come
[1:02:18] forth of his mother's womb naked shall
[1:02:20] he return to go as he came and shall
[1:02:22] take nothing of his labor which he may
[1:02:24] carry away in his hand and this also is
[1:02:27] a sore evil that in all points as he
[1:02:29] came so shall he go and what prophet
[1:02:31] hath he that laboured for the wind not
[1:02:34] all his days also he eateth in darkness
[1:02:37] and he hath much sorrow and wrath with
[1:02:41] the sickness behold that which I've seen
[1:02:44] it is good and calmly for one to eat and
[1:02:46] drink now here it is here's the good
[1:02:48] part about working right here and to
[1:02:50] enjoy the good of all his labor that he
[1:02:52] taketh Under the Sun all the days of his
[1:02:54] life which God give it to him for it is
[1:02:57] his portion how many had supper tonight
[1:03:00] with your family I know my family did
[1:03:05] you know having
[1:03:07] Supper having something to eat and drink
[1:03:08] the Bible said God gave you that supper
[1:03:11] tonight that's a gift from God I know I
[1:03:15] had supper at the table last night with
[1:03:17] my family that was a gift of God those
[1:03:19] are very fleeting and they're very
[1:03:21] precious moments are they not be with
[1:03:24] your dad twice a week right like you
[1:03:25] said those are precious moments cuz one
[1:03:27] day if God dairies dad won't be there
[1:03:28] right this is the gift of God and so
[1:03:33] we've got the sosamma saying we've got
[1:03:34] to learn to enjoy what's really most
[1:03:36] important the time that we have with our
[1:03:39] loved ones
[1:03:40] amen not seeing how much money and
[1:03:44] trying to be satisfied with with earning
[1:03:46] enough money but being satisfied with
[1:03:49] the loved ones that he gives us this is
[1:03:50] Solomon's wisdom huh me know it would
[1:03:53] help America if America you could use
[1:03:54] this wisdom today huh me know it helped
[1:03:57] the bride of Jesus Christ you amen
[1:04:01] that's true verse 19 every man also
[1:04:04] doomed God have given riches and wealth
[1:04:06] and have given him power to eat thereof
[1:04:09] and to take his portion and to rejoice
[1:04:11] in his labor this is the gift of God how
[1:04:14] many know that God gave you Holy Ghost
[1:04:16] power to go to work today or was it
[1:04:18] yesterday
[1:04:18] God gave me Holy Ghost power God gave me
[1:04:21] the strength and the power to go be a
[1:04:23] Christian at work today
[1:04:24] Amen that according to God is a gift of
[1:04:29] God that we have strength the Bible said
[1:04:32] it's strike power to eat thereof God
[1:04:35] gave me that ability God anointed me to
[1:04:38] go be a Christian today amen and that is
[1:04:42] the gift or the blessing of God upon my
[1:04:45] life hallelujah
[1:04:49] verse 24 he shall not remember I'm sure
[1:04:52] he shall not much remember the days of
[1:04:54] his life because God anthers him in the
[1:04:57] joy of his heart praise God it is
[1:05:04] far better to get by in life with less
[1:05:06] but be able to enjoy life the little
[1:05:10] things and the moments that God gives us
[1:05:12] with our family and friends that is the
[1:05:14] gift of God you're gonna forget can you
[1:05:17] remember what you did last week at work
[1:05:18] I can't can you remember exactly what
[1:05:22] you did on this certain day at work
[1:05:23] you won't remember that but you want to
[1:05:26] remember that God has given you the gift
[1:05:28] to be with your family the gift to be
[1:05:30] with their friends and I'll say like
[1:05:31] this the gift to be with this church
[1:05:33] it's a gift from God because remember
[1:05:37] what the Bible say the Bible says that
[1:05:39] we should have treasures are our
[1:05:41] chambers in our home should be filled
[1:05:44] with treasures and that's not money and
[1:05:46] that's not Cocoa Krispies and that's not
[1:05:49] ribs and steak what that is that's the
[1:05:51] love of God amen amen
[1:05:54] when your house and churches fill with
[1:05:56] the love of God now you know you've got
[1:05:58] treasures of God amen
[1:05:59] ha ha nore and what is it these all
[1:06:04] these preachers come in lately and what
[1:06:06] do they tell me they tell me all your

[1:06:10] easy to talk to your people are so easy
[1:06:12] to preach you what do we got here we got
[1:06:14] the treasures of God in our midst we get
[1:06:17] our eyes off that like our brother
[1:06:19] sounds Sunday we'll start sinking down
[1:06:20] we forget to look at Jesus and there's
[1:06:23] treasures that he gives us the
[1:06:24] fellowship that we have with one another
[1:06:26] just the sweetness of our fellowship the
[1:06:29] sweetness of how we love and treat one
[1:06:31] another that's a treasure from God amen
[1:06:35] that's exactly right
[1:06:38] even this like even the fellowship that
[1:06:41] we have I've had people tell me their
[1:06:42] pastor what won't even shake their hand
[1:06:44] or their pastor doesn't even spend time
[1:06:46] with them their pastor can't even sit
[1:06:47] down and talk with them or can't answer
[1:06:49] it too busy answer any of their
[1:06:50] questions but yet I've got enough time I
[1:06:53] can shake your hand I can chat with you
[1:06:55] you have a question let me know I mean
[1:06:57] how many times I stay after church and I
[1:06:59] love to answer people's questions that's
[1:07:01] that's a gift of God brother Aaron
[1:07:03] bringing food on a Wednesday night for
[1:07:05] all those wednesdays in a row just to
[1:07:07] have people fellowship and love people
[1:07:08] that's a gift from God amen you don't
[1:07:11] have that in many churches that love and
[1:07:14] the fellowship that we have for one
[1:07:16] another oh my
[1:07:17] this is a gift of God this is God's
[1:07:19] power here this is God's love and we are
[1:07:23] experiencing it and we have to admit
[1:07:25] it's a treasure that he's given to us Oh
[1:07:28] hallelujah I feel like it is at least I
[1:07:31] know I think you do too this is a
[1:07:33] treasure it's the little things that God
[1:07:36] gives us the treasures remember church
[1:07:40] this is a man who had limitless money
[1:07:42] limitless women or his sexual desires
[1:07:45] were limitless as far as that's
[1:07:47] concerned power he could do anything he
[1:07:50] could do anything in the whole nation he
[1:07:51] could order anybody to do anything that
[1:07:53] he wanted them to do and he says these
[1:07:56] small things are the gifts of God amen
[1:08:01] that's why I put that Facebook post last
[1:08:03] night thank God for my children they're
[1:08:05] all healthy they all love the Lord many
[1:08:07] of them most of them been baptized
[1:08:09] most of them smile at me most of them
[1:08:11] give me a good night's kiss you know the
[1:08:14] little ones begged me to sleep with him
[1:08:15] every night when I can't hardly do that
[1:08:16] you know because there's not enough room
[1:08:18] into bed for five people but that's a
[1:08:21] gift of God after remember that is a
[1:08:26] power to have a new feed the children to
[1:08:28] have time to spend time with them to
[1:08:30] hear them sing and new specials and
[1:08:31] playing the piano it and work here at
[1:08:33] the church that's God's gift to us we
[1:08:35] must enjoy God's gifts
[1:08:37] amen that's the end of chapter 5 chapter
[1:08:42] 6 now chapter 6 rather short now verses
[1:08:45] 1 & 2 have a subject verses 3 & 8 verses
[1:08:48] 9 to 12 so let's start with 1 & 2
[1:08:50] chapter 6 there's an evil which I've
[1:08:53] seen under the Sun and it is common
[1:08:54] among men a man whom God has given
[1:08:57] riches wealth and honor so that he
[1:08:58] wanted nothing for so loved all that he
[1:09:00] desireth
[1:09:00] yet God giveth him not power to eat
[1:09:02] thereof but a stranger eateth it
[1:09:04] this is vanity and it is an evil disease
[1:09:09] so here see this is Salman says this is
[1:09:13] something common he's seen the evil of
[1:09:16] having blessings but not having the
[1:09:18] chance to enjoy them this is what saw
[1:09:23] people that have blessings but can never
[1:09:26] enjoy them amen now we're
[1:09:31] got to make sure that we don't make
[1:09:32] ourselves too busy where we can't enjoy
[1:09:34] time with our family we can't even take
[1:09:37] a Saturday we can't take a Friday night
[1:09:38] and go spend time with our family right
[1:09:42] that's why I have to that's why I built
[1:09:43] in a date night with my wife so I make
[1:09:45] sure I always enjoy that time with her
[1:09:47] and I we've got to keep our marriage
[1:09:49] strong I can't let myself get too busy
[1:09:51] that I don't take the time to tell my
[1:09:53] wife how much I love her take her out
[1:09:55] for a coffee
[1:09:55] you know when it's warm I can go hold
[1:09:57] her hand and go for a little walk at the
[1:09:59] park you know I've got to take time to
[1:10:01] enjoy our our loved ones because Solomon
[1:10:06] said I see this all the time
[1:10:07] people that are so busy we're working
[1:10:09] getting rich doing it you're doing all
[1:10:11] they can and they don't even enjoy the
[1:10:12] little things in life and that's why I
[1:10:15] preached on Christmas last week what
[1:10:17] good is it to work my tail off work hard
[1:10:20] as I can and not give my children a nice
[1:10:22] gift in it just to remember Jesus to see
[1:10:27] them get happy and open up a book and
[1:10:29] say oh I love this book open up a toy
[1:10:31] and say oh I've always run this toy
[1:10:33] right or oh this is a beautiful new
[1:10:36] dresser oh this is a nice tires Malc I
[1:10:38] might say or whatever he likes you know
[1:10:40] what good is it to work my tail off and
[1:10:44] mate run myself down and wear myself out
[1:10:46] if I don't enjoy the blessings of God
[1:10:49] what good is it
[1:10:52] and Solomon says this is a common thing
[1:10:54] I see people that work work work and
[1:10:57] they never enjoy life at all they never
[1:11:00] try to make life better for somebody oh
[1:11:02] my what good is that he says verse three
[1:11:07] now verse three to eight is a is a
[1:11:09] another scripture about enjoying
[1:11:11] blessings of God if a man beget a
[1:11:14] hundred children and live many years
[1:11:16] well I've got seven so I'm on that way
[1:11:19] glory and live many years so that the
[1:11:22] days of his years be many and his soul
[1:11:24] be not filled with good but also that he
[1:11:26] had no burial I say that an untimely
[1:11:28] birth is better than he so you can have
[1:11:32] a hundred children but your soul is not
[1:11:34] filled with good you don't even enjoy
[1:11:36] God don't even enjoy your life and then
[1:11:38] you don't even have a funeral or burial
[1:11:40] what good is that you don't have a timer
[1:11:43] people can can all cry let's age let's
[1:11:46] say this is the casket you know people
[1:11:48] are they can't even cry Chirk ask and
[1:11:49] say oh oh I remember brother so-and-so
[1:11:51] what a wonderful brother thank God for
[1:11:53] the life that he lived and we're gonna
[1:11:55] miss him so much what good is it to have
[1:11:58] all the money in a big family and all
[1:12:00] these things that people aren't even
[1:12:02] there to appreciate you if they're not
[1:12:04] even there if you don't even live and
[1:12:07] make your soul happy serving God what
[1:12:09] good is it he says it's no good
[1:12:12] look at verse 4 for he cometh in with
[1:12:15] vanity and he parted and darkness and
[1:12:17] his name shall be covered with darkness
[1:12:19] moreover he hath not seen the Sun nor
[1:12:21] known anything this hath more rest than
[1:12:24] the other yea though he live a thousand
[1:12:28] years twice old yet I see no good do not
[1:12:31] all go to one place see we want good
[1:12:34] things in our lives we want to see good
[1:12:36] things and there's nothing good there's
[1:12:38] nothing more good than to see Jesus in
[1:12:40] your life and to see Jesus in your
[1:12:42] family amen
[1:12:43] remember Hattie Wright brother Ram said
[1:12:46] you can ask for money you're poor you
[1:12:47] can ask for the healing of your parents
[1:12:49] you can ask for the healing of your
[1:12:51] sister but brother Ram said no she asked
[1:12:53] for something that was eternal amen she
[1:12:56] asked for the salvation of her two boys
[1:12:58] praise God and she saw good in her days
[1:13:02] on this life amen and because she asked
[1:13:05] for something eternal
[1:13:06] I believe she's enjoying the turtle
[1:13:07] benefits of it right now amen she saw
[1:13:10] good in her lifetime she was poor she
[1:13:13] only made $20 a year can you imagine
[1:13:14] that $20 a year she said but I said she
[1:13:18] farmed on her Hill she would plant crops
[1:13:21] on her Hill and then go sell them and
[1:13:24] brother Branham said she gave $20 in the
[1:13:27] offering all the money she made from
[1:13:28] there and he was on his way he said to
[1:13:31] give that money back to her and then
[1:13:33] when he see when he was at her house
[1:13:34] that's when she said that she's the
[1:13:37] third pole operated and brother Ram said
[1:13:39] whatever you say you'll have it he was
[1:13:42] he had the $20 in his pocket to give
[1:13:44] back to the woman but God didn't let him
[1:13:46] give it back and said God gave her what
[1:13:49] she really desired to see her boy say
[1:13:51] amen glory so what's more valuable
[1:13:55] having 20 men
[1:13:57] dollars or having two boys that are
[1:13:59] saved amen
[1:14:02] what's more valuable having $7000 or
[1:14:05] having seven children saved amen it's
[1:14:09] trying to get them saved
[1:14:10] that's what's more valuable that's the
[1:14:13] gift of God we all go to one place we
[1:14:16] want to see good during our life and
[1:14:18] there's nothing good but God amen look
[1:14:26] at that verse seven all the labor of man
[1:14:29] is for his mouth and yet the appetite is
[1:14:31] not filled see we should do more work
[1:14:35] than just to feed our bellies there's
[1:14:37] more to work than just feeding our
[1:14:38] bellies we're to be at work to be a
[1:14:40] light for Jesus verse 8 for what hath
[1:14:43] the wise more than the fool what hath
[1:14:45] the poor that knoweth to walk before the
[1:14:48] living amen
[1:14:49] to see we have to have more to work than
[1:14:52] just to feed our bellies we got to work
[1:14:54] for Jesus amen
[1:14:55] now verses 9 to 12 we'll finish chapter
[1:14:58] 6 here briefly
[1:15:01] 6:9 chapter 6 verse 9 better is the
[1:15:05] sight of the eyes than the wandering of
[1:15:07] the desire this is also vanity and
[1:15:10] vexation of spirit now this means be
[1:15:13] certain that your desires do not wander
[1:15:15] away from the best things amen make sure
[1:15:19] that we don't look at things that that
[1:15:21] change our desires well first I want to
[1:15:23] do this and now I want to do that like I
[1:15:27] was thinking on Sunday you know I was
[1:15:29] gonna go up for prayer for some things
[1:15:30] but I was thinking like what's more
[1:15:32] valuable to pray for you know we should
[1:15:35] we pray for material blessings or should
[1:15:38] we pray to read our Bibles more or pray
[1:15:41] to pray to pray more or pray to help
[1:15:45] more people on our job or to help more
[1:15:47] people in our neighborhood what's most
[1:15:50] important what's most important is
[1:15:52] living for other people praise God amen
[1:15:57] so don't let your eyes wander away from
[1:15:59] what's really most valuable living for
[1:16:02] other people like verse 9 says this is
[1:16:04] also vanity and vexation of spirit so
[1:16:06] you don't let your desires wonder well I
[1:16:09] does the desire to
[1:16:11] God more but but now I think I'll do
[1:16:13] this oh my verse then that which has
[1:16:17] been nay that hath been is named already
[1:16:20] and is known that it is man neither may
[1:16:22] he contend with him that is mightier
[1:16:24] than he seeing that there be many things
[1:16:27] that increase vanity what is man the
[1:16:30] better right there's so many things that
[1:16:32] just make us go after vain things right
[1:16:36] oh we don't want to we don't to go up
[1:16:38] there vain things we don't want to spend
[1:16:39] our time on vain things we want to spend
[1:16:41] our time on what's most important amen
[1:16:44] verse 12 for who knoweth what is good
[1:16:47] for a man in this life all the days of
[1:16:50] his vain life which he spent it as a
[1:16:51] shadow who can tell a man what shall be
[1:16:54] after him Under the Sun
[1:16:57] praise God none of us can predict the
[1:17:01] future so we must do things that are
[1:17:03] lasting we must not do vain things or
[1:17:06] fleeting things we must do things that
[1:17:09] will impact eternity amen
[1:17:12] we must in other words we must store up
[1:17:14] treasures in heaven amen
[1:17:16] hallelujah remember Jesus said great is
[1:17:20] your reward in heaven
[1:17:21] when you live for the kingdom of God
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:24] great is your treasure in heaven how
[1:17:26] many won great treasures in heaven amen
[1:17:29] that we must live for the things of God
[1:17:32] praise the Lord alright Chapter seven I
[1:17:36] want to just finish chapter 7 if I can
[1:17:38] finish chapter 7 I'll feel good about
[1:17:40] tonight by God's grace because I studied
[1:17:42] and prayed on these and I prepared
[1:17:44] things I want to make sure I get this
[1:17:45] done here I want to finish the series by
[1:17:47] the grace of the Lord how many love the
[1:17:49] wisdom of God it's life amen
[1:17:51] it's life I trust so far you've received
[1:17:55] something that's life to you amen that's
[1:17:57] a reminder to live this life do do what
[1:18:01] the Holy Spirit has you to do praise God
[1:18:03] please ask these seven verse one we'll
[1:18:09] start with verses 1 to 4 a good
[1:18:15] better than precious ointment and the
[1:18:18] day of death then the day of one's birth
[1:18:22] hey man look at verse two it is better
[1:18:25] to go to the house of mourning than to
[1:18:27] go to the house of feasting for that is
[1:18:30] the end of all men and the living will
[1:18:33] lay it to his heart sorrow is better
[1:18:35] than laughter and for by the sadness of
[1:18:37] the countenance the heart is made better
[1:18:39] the heart of the wise is in the house of
[1:18:42] mourning but the heart of fools is in
[1:18:44] the house of mirth there's a lot in
[1:18:47] those verses right there you know that's
[1:18:52] that's exactly right the day of your
[1:18:55] death is better than the day of your
[1:18:57] birth doesn't the Bible say that
[1:19:01] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[1:19:03] death of his Saints it's precious the
[1:19:06] day a man or woman dies the Bible said
[1:19:09] in the eyes of God it's precious oh my
[1:19:13] did anybody remember what happened on
[1:19:17] the day Stephen died on the day Stephen
[1:19:19] died the Bible said Jesus Christ was
[1:19:21] standing ready to receive Stephen on the
[1:19:24] day that he was in my heart
[1:19:25] hey amen the Bible said the day of your
[1:19:29] death is better than the day of your
[1:19:31] birth aim ahead Oh amen on the day of
[1:19:36] your birth your mom receives you but on
[1:19:38] the day of your death the Holy Spirit
[1:19:40] Jesus receives you amen
[1:19:42] what's better well I think the Holy
[1:19:45] Spirit don't you don't you think Jesus
[1:19:47] receiving you is a little bit better
[1:19:48] than mama although we love mama we want
[1:19:51] mama to be saved we want mama to feel
[1:19:53] the Holy Ghost but we know we can't have
[1:19:55] that without Jesus Christ amen
[1:19:57] that's exactly right the Bible said if
[1:20:02] you go to the house of mourning like a
[1:20:04] funeral it's better than going to a
[1:20:06] party because you'll lay mortality to
[1:20:10] heart can you remember the last funeral
[1:20:12] you're at that was better according the
[1:20:15] Bible that was more beneficial to you
[1:20:17] than the last party you went to the last
[1:20:22] celebration because at a funeral you
[1:20:26] have to examine your life right
[1:20:29] you have to think mine what are these
[1:20:31] days that's that may be me if the
[1:20:33] rapture don't come and the Bible sets
[1:20:36] better to be mourning or sad than it is
[1:20:40] to be celebrate celebratory I'm just
[1:20:43] talking like like a birthday party or
[1:20:44] something like that yeah well we're
[1:20:46] thank God for another birthday we thank
[1:20:48] God for another day right another year
[1:20:50] but the Bible said you're more benefited
[1:20:52] by thinking about your mortality than
[1:20:55] you are about just being frivolous right
[1:20:57] happy and and and frolicking and things
[1:21:00] like that remember the Bible said where
[1:21:04] David David said Lord teach me to number
[1:21:07] my days that I apply my heart to wisdom
[1:21:09] amen teach me to number my days help me
[1:21:15] to remember I don't have forever to live
[1:21:18] at some point I've got to give up the
[1:21:20] ghost if God doesn't come back if Jesus
[1:21:22] doesn't split the skies during my
[1:21:24] lifetime I've got to go to the grave so
[1:21:27] it's better to go to a house of mourning
[1:21:30] than it is to a house of laughter
[1:21:32] there's my 45 minutes so let me try to
[1:21:35] find a place to close here how many one
[1:21:44] a better heart how much your heart to be
[1:21:47] in better condition amen it's good to
[1:21:50] think about death it's good to think
[1:21:51] about people passing away it's good to
[1:21:55] remember grandma or pass away or grandpa
[1:21:57] or great grandma or grandpa it's good to
[1:21:59] think at their pictures and say mine
[1:22:01] were they ready when they went Lord
[1:22:03] helped me to be ready praise God
[1:22:06] verse six or five I'm sorry it is better
[1:22:12] to hear the rebuke of the wise then for
[1:22:13] a man to hear the song of fools for as
[1:22:18] the crackling of thorns under a pot so
[1:22:19] is the laughter of the fool
[1:22:21] this is also vanity what would you
[1:22:25] rather hear a joke a smart out joke or
[1:22:27] somebody rebuking you for doing
[1:22:29] something wrong the Bible said you
[1:22:31] should enjoy rebukes more than silly
[1:22:33] nonsense and jokes and stuff like that
[1:22:35] it's better to do that amen
[1:22:40] look at verse 7
[1:22:41] then surely oppression make of the wise
[1:22:44] man mad and a gift destroys the heart
[1:22:48] that's a bribery bribery destroys the
[1:22:51] heart better is the end of a thing than
[1:22:54] the beginning thereof and the patient
[1:22:56] and spear is better than the proud and
[1:22:58] spirit praise God be not hasty a nice
[1:23:03] spirit to be angry for anger resteth in
[1:23:06] the bosom of fools so slow yourself down
[1:23:10] if you feel yourself getting angry slow
[1:23:12] yourself down and try not to get angry
[1:23:14] too fast because you can do a lot of
[1:23:16] hastiness with anger verse 10 say not
[1:23:21] now what is the cause that the former
[1:23:23] days were better than these for thou
[1:23:26] does not inquire wisely concerning to
[1:23:29] this okay so we should have looked at
[1:23:31] our lives as a mine my life was so much
[1:23:33] better five years ago boy last year was
[1:23:36] so much better than this year church we
[1:23:38] never want to complain because we got to
[1:23:40] remember before anything can happen to
[1:23:42] our life God had to approve it just like
[1:23:45] with Joe before that could happen God
[1:23:47] had to say okay and if God says it's
[1:23:50] okay
[1:23:51] that you and I should be thankful in all
[1:23:52] things amen it's an evil thing it's a
[1:23:57] wrong thing to say boy I wish this I
[1:23:59] wish it I wish we are living through
[1:24:01] last year more than that then this year
[1:24:03] why is this your such a hard year that's
[1:24:07] not a wise thing to say according to the
[1:24:11] scripture that's what the scripture says
[1:24:12] there verse 11 wisdom is good with an
[1:24:15] inheritance here's where our text books
[1:24:17] and buy it there's profit to them that
[1:24:20] see the Sun see we got to have money and
[1:24:24] there's profit to having money but look
[1:24:28] at verse 12 for wisdom is a defense
[1:24:30] so if wisdom protects you you don't do
[1:24:32] foolish things it protects you and but
[1:24:37] the excellency of knowledge is that
[1:24:40] wisdom giveth life to them that have it
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:44] help me know that wisdom gives life
[1:24:47] praise God
[1:24:48] wisdom gives life think about all
[1:24:52] times where people in the Bible were
[1:24:55] spared because wisdom operated amen
[1:25:00] think about that little baby remember
[1:25:02] Solomon with the two mothers think about
[1:25:04] the baby the baby was going to be cut in
[1:25:07] half but what gave it life wisdom gave
[1:25:09] it life wisdom found out who the true
[1:25:12] mother is who really cares about the
[1:25:14] life of this child because of wisdom
[1:25:17] life was spared amen
[1:25:20] hallelujah think of the two spies in the
[1:25:24] days of Rahab the Rhea have had to hide
[1:25:26] them right in the bushes on the roof
[1:25:29] what saved their life wisdom so Rahab
[1:25:33] lie normally lying is an evil thing
[1:25:35] right but God gave her wisdom in order
[1:25:38] to hide them right now that's the Old
[1:25:43] Testament right we're we're we have more
[1:25:45] power in the New Testament our Amen but
[1:25:48] wisdom gave her of the ability to save
[1:25:52] their lives and because she did that she
[1:25:56] told the devil where she told them well
[1:25:58] they went out this way and she lied but
[1:26:01] it's a there to life and they said
[1:26:03] because you saved our lives if you put
[1:26:05] up a token your life will be saved amen
[1:26:08] in other words because she hidden the
[1:26:10] Word of God
[1:26:11] she had life amen and that's what you
[1:26:14] and I do if we hide the Word of God in
[1:26:16] our hearts will not sin against God amen
[1:26:19] I don't know your wisdom give it life so
[1:26:24] wisdom is high Word of God in your heart
[1:26:26] that you don't sin against God yeah
[1:26:29] that's what that's that's what that
[1:26:30] Rahab type is she hid the Word of God in
[1:26:33] her heart and Satan couldn't get into
[1:26:35] her heart hey man hey man I don't know
[1:26:39] yeah
[1:26:39] how many hiding God's word in your heart
[1:26:40] tonight don't let say don't let don't
[1:26:43] tell the devil your secret member of our
[1:26:45] hams are likes I like Samson don't tell
[1:26:47] the devil your secret but the man said
[1:26:49] your secret is your prayer life amen
[1:26:52] that's about I've said about Samson
[1:26:54] Samson gave his secret to Delilah he
[1:26:58] told her where the power rested and RAM
[1:27:00] said the church has told say in their
[1:27:03] secrets
[1:27:04] the prayer meetings the
[1:27:05] praying with God Almighty that's your
[1:27:08] power I hope somebody's hearing me

[1:27:41] right
[1:27:43] wisdom gives life its life to us praise
[1:27:48] God

[1:27:51] life even though he's cast into the den
[1:27:53] of lions he wisdom gave him life wisdom
[1:27:56] told them it's better to pray to God
[1:27:58] than not pray to God it's better to pray
[1:28:03] to God than for 30 days and I have a
[1:28:05] prayer life I hope I hope that's not our
[1:28:07] church I hope our church says well I'll
[1:28:09] give up a month of Prayer cuz I'm so
[1:28:10] busy I hope we don't give up prayer time
[1:28:12] I hope we pray no matter what it costs
[1:28:14] us no matter how tired we get no matter
[1:28:17] to the trials we go through I trust the
[1:28:20] church will continue to get on its knees
[1:28:21] in prayer amen
[1:28:23] don't let Satan take your life but
[1:28:26] because he had wisdom to know I must
[1:28:28] always pray because he had wisdom to
[1:28:31] know that God spared his life amen
[1:28:33] just like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:28:36] wisdom gave them life wisdom told them
[1:28:39] I'll never bow to a prophet or an image
[1:28:42] of a prophet and worship a prophet amen
[1:28:44] and neither will we will never bow and
[1:28:47] worship a man what the wisdom tells us
[1:28:50] that and no matter how much money you
[1:28:52] would make us or how popular we'd be or
[1:28:54] how much the church would grow will
[1:28:56] never bow down to any sin and that
[1:28:58] wisdom will give us life amen
[1:29:01] hallelujah that's beautiful wisdom gives
[1:29:07] life praise God

[1:29:24] something real quick to you how many
[1:29:26] enjoyed the services on Sunday let me
[1:29:30] read some to you know that you said Amen

[1:29:45] the church said this is why we got to go
[1:29:49] back to this that wisdom gives you life
[1:29:51] I found these quotes brother have said
[1:29:54] listen brother you never saved by a sign
[1:29:56] you're never saved by a sensation you're
[1:29:59] saved when you meet God's condition of
[1:30:02] his word and nothing else are you saved
[1:30:04] by that's right
[1:30:05] God's Word has made a way you're not
[1:30:08] saved because you feel like you're
[1:30:10] saying I'll be honest we haven't got a
[1:30:15] great time Sunday but I was worn out on
[1:30:17] Monday and Tuesday there's times I
[1:30:18] didn't feel real good spiritually
[1:30:21] brother Adam said you are not saved
[1:30:23] because you feel like it
[1:30:25] he said you're saved because you met
[1:30:27] God's requirement in other words you
[1:30:30] kept the Word of God you repented you
[1:30:32] were baptized in Jesus Christ then you
[1:30:35] were filled with the Holy Ghost that
[1:30:37] proves you're saved not based on how you
[1:30:39] feel on Monday or Tuesday or even
[1:30:41] Wednesday night
[1:30:42] but it's what God's Word said did you
[1:30:44] meet God's requirements yes or no if you
[1:30:47] did you can say thank God I'm saved look
[1:30:51] what he says brother Branham says I'm
[1:30:53] not saved because I feel like I'm safe
[1:30:56] because a lot of times I don't feel that
[1:31:00] way glory amen hallelujah brother
[1:31:05] Branham said I don't feel like I'm saved
[1:31:07] many times and yet how many times does
[1:31:10] he see the angel Lord you can call him
[1:31:12] how many times did he see Jesus Christ
[1:31:14] twice a man that seen Jesus Christ by
[1:31:19] vision a man that had so many miracles
[1:31:21] he said a lot of times I don't feel that
[1:31:27] I'm saved that's why we got
[1:31:30] keep coming to church that's why you got
[1:31:32] it while the words being preached you
[1:31:34] got to say Amen and you need to smile
[1:31:35] and you need to be happy because wisdom
[1:31:38] gives life if you're receiving wisdom
[1:31:42] you should be receiving life tonight
[1:31:46] Larry that's why I like brother Aaron
[1:31:49] says you know he notices when I worship
[1:31:50] I just get a big smile on my face well
[1:31:52] I'll be honest by there when I come to
[1:31:54] church many times they don't feel like
[1:31:55] that I feel more nervous like help me
[1:31:57] Laura I got all this to do but once I
[1:31:59] started singing once I started thinking
[1:32:01] about Jesus once I start thinking about
[1:32:02] how he died to save a wretch like me I
[1:32:04] can't help but feel happy in his
[1:32:07] presence because the wisdom of God gives
[1:32:09] me life hallelujah and because I feel so
[1:32:14] good tonight I'll feel even better
[1:32:16] tomorrow by God's grace that's exactly
[1:32:19] right your prophet said a lot of times I
[1:32:22] don't even feel like I'm saved
[1:32:23] Oh God
[1:32:28] he was a burning fireball star a burning
[1:32:32] fire ball of gas in the hand of Jesus he
[1:32:35] was a real star of God how many believe
[1:32:37] that oh I believe with all my heart
[1:32:39] brother Aaron said but I'm saved because
[1:32:42] God gave the promised glory
[1:32:48] Lydia's save tonight Malachi saved
[1:32:51] tonight
[1:32:51] Haven is saved tonight because God gave
[1:32:54] the promise not how they feel but
[1:32:56] because God gave the promise God said
[1:33:01] repent be baptized and you shall be
[1:33:03] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:33:04] he gave the promise you're saved
[1:33:09] hallelujah buh-bam said I met God's
[1:33:14] conditions he says now listen and upon
[1:33:18] God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven
[1:33:22] days a week is night because it's God's
[1:33:26] Word
[1:33:27] amen you can beat Satan seven days a
[1:33:30] week because you've got God's Word
[1:33:33] you've got God's promise how many got
[1:33:35] God's promise tonight how many got the
[1:33:37] strong hand of faith holding God's
[1:33:38] promise tonight you can defeat state in
[1:33:41] seven days a week with God's promise
[1:33:44] oh I love that amen hallelujah thank you
[1:33:50] Jesus let me let me close here we need
[1:33:56] money we have to have food and shelter
[1:33:58] but it's not money that gives life it's
[1:34:01] wisdom that gives life where we at verse
[1:34:07] 12 write verse 13 consider the work of
[1:34:09] God for who can make that straight which
[1:34:11] he hath made crooked if something went
[1:34:14] really awful in your life who can
[1:34:16] straighten that out nobody can
[1:34:17] straighten it out you only have to learn
[1:34:19] how to live with it
[1:34:20] right if something went crooked and my
[1:34:22] this was an awful decision there's no
[1:34:24] one that can straighten it out except
[1:34:25] God God is the only one so why worry
[1:34:30] about it why fuss and stew about why
[1:34:32] should we worry about it when we can we
[1:34:35] instead of choosing death we should
[1:34:37] choose the wisdom of God choose life try
[1:34:40] to see God you allow this this crooked
[1:34:43] path you allow this wrong decision you
[1:34:45] allowed me to walk in the permissive
[1:34:47] will that I might learn from it and now
[1:34:50] walk in the perfect will of God
[1:34:52] wisdom gives life look at verse 14 in
[1:34:59] the day of prosperity be joyful but in
[1:35:03] the day of adversity consider God also
[1:35:05] has set the one against the other to the
[1:35:08] end that man should find nothing after
[1:35:10] him praise God so consider church that
[1:35:16] God orders our paths God allows us to go
[1:35:19] through prosperous times everything's
[1:35:20] going good boy everything's going good
[1:35:23] everything's wonderful everything in the
[1:35:25] church is fantastic everything at home
[1:35:27] is good the job is going good health is
[1:35:29] going good everything's going good with
[1:35:31] the bottles that remember the same guy
[1:35:32] that made good times also made the bad
[1:35:34] times like Jose sang on Sunday but the
[1:35:37] guy the mountains he still got in the
[1:35:39] valleys praise God that's where we get
[1:35:41] this stuff from the Word of God all
[1:35:46] things
[1:35:47] fifteen have I seen in the days of my
[1:35:49] vanity there's a just man that perishes
[1:35:51] in his righteousness and there's a
[1:35:52] wicked man that prolonged with his life
[1:35:54] in his wickedness so Solomon had seen
[1:35:59] both Solomon's had seen a godly man die
[1:36:01] early and he see a unjust man lived to a
[1:36:05] very long life see because none of us
[1:36:09] really can understand everything that
[1:36:11] happens in our life we all have to
[1:36:13] understand that God orders our steps in
[1:36:16] our past praise God hallelujah God sets
[1:36:23] the good ones in order against the bad
[1:36:25] ones God ordains the seasons and times
[1:36:27] of our life remember life is fleeting
[1:36:32] proverbs are not guarantees but proverbs
[1:36:35] are possibilities they're likely they're
[1:36:37] probabilities this will probably happen
[1:36:39] if you do this look at verse 16 be not
[1:36:47] righteous over much neither make thyself
[1:36:49] over wise why should us thou destroy
[1:36:54] thyself oh my the Bible
[1:37:00] in other words don't be overzealous and
[1:37:01] destroy yourself do not destroy yourself
[1:37:05] because if you're foolish you could die
[1:37:07] early like it says yeah let's keep going
[1:37:08] there verse verse seventeen be not over
[1:37:11] much wicked neither be thou foolish why
[1:37:14] should us now die before thy time verse
[1:37:18] eighteen it is good that thou should us
[1:37:20] take hold of this yeh also from this
[1:37:22] withdraw not thine hand for he that fear
[1:37:24] with God shall come forth of them all
[1:37:26] amen see don't work yourself to death or
[1:37:31] done you know just don't don't harm
[1:37:33] yourself don't don't work yourself to
[1:37:35] death at all these things find a balance
[1:37:37] in your life
[1:37:38] but the main thing as he says at the
[1:37:40] very end of the book the main thing is
[1:37:42] to fear God keep his commands and hate
[1:37:45] evil praise God that's the main thing we
[1:37:47] see here look at verse 19 here it is
[1:37:53] right here I hope you're leaving church
[1:37:55] tonight stronger than you were when you
[1:37:56] came in wisdom strengthens the wise more
[1:38:00] than 10 mighty men which are in the city
[1:38:03] for there is not a just man upon earth
[1:38:05] that doeth good and sinneth not verse 21
[1:38:10] also take no heed unto all the words
[1:38:13] that are spoken lest thou hear thy
[1:38:15] servant curse thee for oftentimes also
[1:38:17] that own heart knoweth that thou thyself
[1:38:20] likewise has cursed others in that
[1:38:27] striking so you'll be stronger tonight
[1:38:31] by hearing the word of wisdom more than
[1:38:34] ten people who are working out at Planet
[1:38:37] Fitness tonight right anybody ever have
[1:38:41] them gym membership before I said when I
[1:38:43] first got out of college I used to go
[1:38:44] back to the College to work out and I
[1:38:47] tried to get all strong and try to stay
[1:38:49] strong I could never get it strong again
[1:38:50] because I didn't work out very hard but
[1:38:54] the Bible said you tonight are getting
[1:38:56] stronger by the wisdom of God then all
[1:38:58] those people at Planet Fitness who are
[1:39:01] working out sweating tonight over there
[1:39:03] wiping their faces lifting heavy weights
[1:39:06] lifted all this you should be stronger
[1:39:08] by the wisdom of God hey man that's
[1:39:13] exactly
[1:39:13] right right maokai they had a black belt
[1:39:18] practice tonight you had a chance to be
[1:39:21] stronger at the practice tonight
[1:39:22] physically or you could have got
[1:39:24] stronger spiritually well daddy chose it
[1:39:25] for you but I know when you're older
[1:39:27] you'll choose the same be stronger
[1:39:29] spiritually don't worry so much about
[1:39:31] physical if you got a chance try to be
[1:39:34] stronger spiritually amen
[1:39:37] lay these things to heart lay the late a
[1:39:41] heart that immortal I'm gonna die I've
[1:39:43] got it I've got to put the first things
[1:39:45] first if I don't have tomorrow what
[1:39:47] would I do tonight I'd be at the house
[1:39:49] of God amen brother Anderson if I knew
[1:39:51] the rapture was coming this week he said
[1:39:53] I'd be in the church preaching today
[1:39:54] because this is my post of duty this is
[1:39:57] what God called me to do this is my
[1:39:59] position on earth this is what I was
[1:40:01] born for amen
[1:40:02] I would do exactly what I was doing all
[1:40:04] the time because I always put God first
[1:40:06] I always give God first place God is
[1:40:09] always my highest priority I always do
[1:40:11] which the father pleases amen ha amen
[1:40:15] the man said I would not be on the
[1:40:17] street trying to warm people to get to
[1:40:18] heaven
[1:40:19] I'd be preaching if I knew the rapture
[1:40:21] was going to come tomorrow because
[1:40:24] that's what God has called me to do amen
[1:40:27] Church do we know what God has called us
[1:40:29] to do we want to know what God has
[1:40:32] called us to do hallelujah hey man thank
[1:40:36] you lord amen I knew he's coming
[1:40:39] tomorrow
[1:40:39] be right here preaching tonight that's
[1:40:42] that right because I know I know all
[1:40:44] that the father has given me will come
[1:40:46] to me and the Bible said forsake not the
[1:40:50] assembling of yourselves together for
[1:40:52] these meetings are what edify the body
[1:40:54] of Christ that's exactly right
[1:40:57] I better stop right there let's see
[1:41:03] verse 23 all this have I proved by
[1:41:08] wisdom I said I will be wise but it was
[1:41:10] far from me that which is far off an
[1:41:13] exceeding deep who can find it out
[1:41:15] let's stand our feet here now we're
[1:41:17] standing Lydia bring up Hebrews chapter
[1:41:18] 10 verse 20
[1:41:21] verse 22 let's do Hebrews 10:22
[1:41:30] Hebrews 10:22 actions go to verse 19
[1:41:41] let's go to verse 99 now how many
[1:41:48] believe it's so important that you were
[1:41:49] here in church tonight how did he was
[1:41:52] more important to be here tonight than
[1:41:54] at Planet Fitness or at home you know
[1:41:57] sweep in like I need to go sweep at home
[1:41:59] sometimes there's places I want to sweep
[1:42:01] and clean you know there's some things I
[1:42:04] like I like to clean off the garage I
[1:42:05] need to do that I got a lot of things I
[1:42:07] liked it you know I could do but I know
[1:42:10] church on you knows well it's more
[1:42:12] beneficial that we're here than doing
[1:42:15] other things that are just vanity things
[1:42:19] because look at verse 19 now that you
[1:42:23] come to the piano having therefore
[1:42:24] brethren boldness to enter in the hoist
[1:42:26] by the blood of Jesus by a new and
[1:42:31] living way which he hath consecrated for
[1:42:32] us through the veil that is to say his
[1:42:34] flesh having a high priest over the
[1:42:38] house of God who's over this church
[1:42:41] tonight Jesus we're supposed to have
[1:42:45] boldness to come to the high priest
[1:42:47] tonight
[1:42:48] verse 22 let us draw near let us to see
[1:42:51] we do it together let Christians draw
[1:42:53] near with a true heart in full assurance
[1:42:55] of faith having our hearts sprinkled
[1:42:57] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[1:42:59] washed with pure water so is that how
[1:43:04] your heart feels tonight is your heart
[1:43:06] feel sprinkled with I know I got a clean
[1:43:08] conscious Lord I've tried to confess
[1:43:10] every wrong I've done how many have a
[1:43:11] clear conscience amen
[1:43:12] we're supposed to draw near to God as a
[1:43:15] body we're supposed to draw near with
[1:43:17] bonus and in the high priest with a
[1:43:19] clear conscience
[1:43:20] nothing sin during my walk with God I've
[1:43:22] tried that I've tried to repent of
[1:43:25] everything I know that's wrong I've
[1:43:26] tried to worship and love God all week
[1:43:28] and I've drawn into God's presence here
[1:43:30] tonight
[1:43:32] verse 23 let us hold fast the profession
[1:43:36] of our faith without wavering for he is
[1:43:38] faithful that
[1:43:40] promised amen we had such a good time on
[1:43:44] Sunday but we can't wave or we can't we
[1:43:46] can't lose that shrink that we had on
[1:43:48] Sunday we've got to keep strong together
[1:43:50] amen
[1:43:51] we can't waver and say well I don't know
[1:43:53] if I can do this any longer I don't know
[1:43:56] if God's gonna work this out I don't
[1:43:58] know if I can keep this up we've got a
[1:44:00] we cannot retreat we got to refuse from
[1:44:03] giving up praise God yes why because God
[1:44:07] is faithful if God promised you
[1:44:10] something God's gonna give it to you if
[1:44:12] he promised it amen
[1:44:14] and we know his word is a promise let's
[1:44:18] keep going verse 24 and let us consider
[1:44:23] one another to provoke unto love and to
[1:44:26] good works now provoke means it stir up
[1:44:30] the Bible said we should consider each
[1:44:33] one to provoke unto love and to do good
[1:44:37] works so our our thought tonight is what
[1:44:42] can I do to stir up brother Aaron and
[1:44:45] the sisters what can I do to make them
[1:44:48] love Jesus more that should be what
[1:44:50] that's what the Bible says we're
[1:44:51] considering to provoke stir them up unto
[1:44:53] love and good works what can I say
[1:44:55] tonight that was my prayer tonight when
[1:44:59] I was praying here before service how
[1:45:02] can i stir the Saints up to do good
[1:45:04] works unto God I think this doesn't this
[1:45:08] book of Ecclesiastes help us want to do
[1:45:10] good works right it makes us want to
[1:45:13] enjoy our family time it makes us want
[1:45:15] to enjoy the little things and not get
[1:45:17] caught not get trying to satisfy with
[1:45:18] riches but to be satisfied with Jesus
[1:45:21] right let us consider one other and you
[1:45:27] should have thought how can i stir up
[1:45:29] brother Jesse to love God more how can I
[1:45:32] provoke brother Jesse to do more good
[1:45:34] things for God that's what the Bible
[1:45:37] says let us consider one another so we
[1:45:43] should come to
[1:45:43] ready to say my god bless you brother
[1:45:46] how you doing and try to say something
[1:45:48] to stir somebody up glory and now look
[1:45:56] at verse 25 here's the scripture we know
[1:45:59] that commands us humming over command to
[1:46:01] go to church this is the YouTube video
[1:46:04] I'm working on right now I'm about
[1:46:05] halfway done not forsaking so we still
[1:46:09] we provoke each other not forsaking the
[1:46:11] assembling of ourselves together as the
[1:46:12] manner of some is so some people will
[1:46:15] just abandon each other and they won't
[1:46:16] they won't try to stir each other up but
[1:46:19] we're supposed to gather get her to stir
[1:46:21] each other up but exhorting that means
[1:46:25] strengthening one another and so much
[1:46:29] the more as you see that Day approaching
[1:46:31] so we're supposed to gather more to stir
[1:46:35] each other up as we see the rapture
[1:46:38] approaching praise the Lord amen we're
[1:46:44] supposed to go before the high priest
[1:46:45] we're supposed to have boldness before
[1:46:47] before Jesus Christ and we're supposed
[1:46:50] to come here and say lord help me to
[1:46:53] consider how can i stir up my brother
[1:46:55] and sister in the Lord how can I help
[1:46:58] them love God more how can I help them
[1:47:01] do more good works for God amen oh
[1:47:05] that's beautiful isn't it good to go
[1:47:09] through the scriptures kind of slow
[1:47:11] sometimes we just read through those so
[1:47:13] fast you don't even realize what we're
[1:47:15] reading and so much the more as you see
[1:47:21] that day approaching praise God now how

[1:47:36] love each other more and to do good
[1:47:38] works praise God amen like I can feel
[1:47:46] the love of sister Beatrice when she
[1:47:48] picks up that broom in there it makes me
[1:47:51] want to pick up a broom it makes me
[1:47:53] wanna do something you know it does when
[1:47:55] I see Naomi wipe the table or something
[1:47:57] like that when I see brother Aaron bring
[1:48:00] that in the food in there it makes me
[1:48:02] you want to do something for God because
[1:48:04] it serves me up it makes my how can I be
[1:48:07] a blessing to somebody as well amen
[1:48:13] that's what the curse that's what

[1:48:16] and we try to provoke people to love God
[1:48:19] more praise God I want to provoke people
[1:48:26] to do good more good works unto Jesus
[1:48:29] Christ so much the more as you see that

[1:49:26] can stir each other up what what good
[1:49:29] thing can we do when we gather this is
